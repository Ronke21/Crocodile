<text>Toledo ( ; ) is a city and municipality of Spain, the capital of the province of Toledo and the &quot;de jure&quot; seat of the government and parliament of the autonomous community of Castilla–La Mancha.

Toledo is primarily located on the right (north) bank of the Tagus in central Iberia, nestled in a bend of the river. It is known as the &quot;City of the Three Cultures&quot; for the cultural influences of Christians, Muslims, and Jews throughout its history. It was the capital, from 542 to 725 CE, of the Visigothic kingdom and was the venue for the Councils of Toledo. The city, seat of a powerful archdiocese for much of its history, has a Gothic Cathedral, and a long history in the production of bladed weapons, which are now common souvenirs of the city. Toledo was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1986 for its extensive monumental and cultural heritage.

, the municipality had a population of 83,226. The municipality has an area of .

==Coat of arms==

The town was granted arms in the 16th century, which were based on the coat of arms of the King of Spain by special royal privilege.

==History==

===Roman era and late antiquity===

Toledo () is described by the Roman historian Livy (ca. 59 BCE – 17 CE) as &quot;urbs parva, sed loco munita&quot; (&quot;a small city, but fortified by location&quot;). Roman general Marcus Fulvius Nobilior fought a battle near the city in 193 BCE against a confederation of Celtic tribes, defeating them and capturing a king called Hilermus. At that time, Toletum was a city of the Carpetani tribe in the region of Carpetania. It was incorporated into the Roman Empire as a &quot;civitas stipendiaria&quot;, (a tributary city of non-citizens) and later a municipium. With this status, city officials obtained Roman citizenship for public service, and the forms of Roman law and politics were increasingly adopted. At approximately this time, a Roman circus, city walls, public baths, and a municipal water supply and storage system were constructed in Toletum.

The Roman circus in Toledo was one of the largest in Hispania. The circus could hold up to 15,000 spectators. A fragmentary stone inscription records circus games paid for by a citizen of unknown name to celebrate his achieving the sevirate, a kind of priesthood conferring high status. Games were held in the circus late into the 4th and early 5th centuries, an indication of active city life and ongoing patronage by wealthy elites. 

Toledo started to gain importance in late antiquity. There are indications that large private houses (&quot;domus&quot;) within the city walls were enlarged, while several large villas were built north of the city through the 3rd and 4th centuries. Church councils were held in Toledo in the years 400 and 527 to discuss the conflict with Priscillianism. In 546 (or possibly earlier), Visigoth rulers installed the capital of their kingdom in Toledo. King Theudis was in Toledo in 546, where he promulgated the only law of which records remain from the period, known from a single manuscript.

Throughout the 7th century, a series of further church councils—the so-called Councils of Toledo—attempted to reconcile differing theological views and enacted anti-Jewish laws. By the end of the 7th century, the bishop of Toledo was the leader of all other bishops in Hispania, a situation unusual in Europe. The city was also unmatched as a symbolic center of monarchy.

When internal divisions developed under the Visigothic nobles, Tariq bin Ziyad captured Toledo in 711 or 712 on behalf of the Umayyad Caliphate of Damascus as part of the Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula. Tariq&#x27;s superior, Governor Musa, disembarked in Cádiz and proceeded to Toledo, where he executed the Visigothic nobles, destroying much of the existing power structure.

===Middle Ages===

Following the Umayyad conquest, invaders were ethnically diverse, and available evidence suggests that in the area of Toledo (locally known as under Islamic rule), Berber settlement predominated over Arab. In 742, the Berbers in Al-Andalus rebelled against the Arab Umayyad governors. They took control of the north and unsuccessfully laid siege to the city.

The city retained its importance as a literary and ecclesiastical centre well into the mid-8th century, as the Chronicle of 754 demonstrated. During this period, several letters show of the primacy that the church of Toledo held.

Under the Umayyad Emirate of Cordoba, Toledo was the centre of numerous insurrections against the Cordobese government from 761 to 857. Girbib ibn-Abdallah, a poet from Toledo, wrote verses against the Umayyads, helping to inspire a revolt in the city against the new emir in 797. By the end of the 8th century, the Umayyads had made Toledo the administrative center of the Central March of Al-Andalus. In 852, a new revolt broke out in Toledo. The Umayyad governor was held hostage to secure the return of Toledan hostages held in Córdoba. In reprisal for a prior attack by Toledans, emir Muhammad I sent an army to attack them, but was defeated. Toledo allied with King Ordoño I of Asturias. They fought together at the Battle of Guadacelete but lost. Later in 857, the Toledans attacked Talavera but were again defeated. In 859, Muhammad I negotiated a truce with Toledo. Though locked in conflict with neighboring cities, the city became virtually independent for twenty years. Cordobese authorities re-asserted control over Toledo in 873, after the successful Umayyad siege on the city, which forced defenders to submit. The Banu Qasi gained nominal control of Toledo until 920. A new period of unruliness followed in the 920 and 930s, until Caliph Abd-ar-Rahman III captured the city in 932 after an extensive siege.

In the wake of the early 11th-century Fitna of al-Andalus, Toledo became the centre of an independent polity, the so-called Taifa of Toledo, under the rule of the Dhu l-Nunids. The population of Toledo at this time was about 28,000, including a Jewish population of 4,000. The Mozarab community had its own Christian bishop. The &quot;taifa&quot; was centered on the Tagus and bordered Sierra de Guadarrama, Guadalajara, Medinaceli, the Taifa of Valencia and the Mountains of Toledo.

The taifa, however, fell into political disarray, owing to the economic draining caused by the &quot;parias&quot; (tributes) imposed by the Kingdom of León as well as territorial mutilations, and so a revolt erupted in 1079, which was followed by the Aftasid ruler of Badajoz taking control of the city.

On 25 May 1085, Alfonso VI of León took Toledo and established direct personal control over the city from which he had been exacting tribute. Around that time, the city&#x27;s demographics featured a heterogeneous composition, with Mozarabs, Muslims, and Jews, to which incoming Christians from northern Iberia and Frankish elements were added. Initially, therefore, different &quot;fueros&quot; were simultaneously in force for each community. After the Christian conquest, the city&#x27;s Mozarab community grew by immigration from the Muslim south.

Toledo preserved its status as a cultural centre. A tag-team translation centre was established in which books in Arabic or Hebrew would be translated into Castilian by Muslim and Jewish scholars, and from Castilian into Latin by Castilian scholars, thus letting long-lost knowledge spread through Christian Europe again. Under the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toledo, multiple persecutions (633, 653, 693) and stake burnings of Jews (638) occurred; the Kingdom of Toledo followed up on this tradition with forced conversions and mass murder (1368, 1391, 1449, 1486–1490) and rioting and bloodbath against the Jews of Toledo (1212).

A major popular revolt erupted in 1449, with elements of tax mutiny, anti-Jewish and anti-converso sentiment, and appeals to the civic community, eventually expanding from an urban revolt to anti-seigneurial riots in countryside settlements outside the city.

===Modern era===

During the persecution of the Jews in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, members of the local Jewish community produced texts on their long history in Toledo.

After the crushing of the Revolt of the Comuneros, Charles V&#x27;s court was installed in Toledo, with the monarch choosing the city as his residence at least 15 times from 1525 on. Charles granted the city a coat of arms. From 1528 to 1561 the population increased from 31,930 to 56,270. In 1561, during the first years of his son Philip II&#x27;s reign, the royal court was moved to Madrid.

The archbishops of Toledo remained powerful brokers in the political and religious affairs of Spain for the rest of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;, also owning large amounts of seigneurial land across most of the southern half of the Inner Plateau and some nearby territories.
The mass arrival of deported unruly Moriscos from Granada (&#x27;moriscos nuevos&#x27;) in Toledo and its lands (6,000 arrived to the city only, at least temporarily) in the wake of the Alpujarras rebellion posed a formidable logistic challenge, and the uneasy preexisting system of social relations between the &quot;moros viejos&quot; (&#x27;old Moors&#x27;) and the Old Christians was disrupted. By and large, Granadan new Moriscos were subject to xenophobic abuse and became stigmatised as bloodthirsty and sacrilegious.

The city excelled in silk manufacturing during the early modern period. The silk industry reached a peak in the 16th century, entering a protracted decline in the later years of that century and ultimately disappearing by the turn of the 19th century.
The Peninsular War affected the city in a very negative way. Over the 19th century, Toledo underwent a progressive change from a convent city to a bureaucratic city. The city being quite impervious to external influence at the time, the bourgeoisie exerted a limited influence.

Following the exclusion of Toledo from the railway to the Portuguese border in the 1850s, the construction of a rail connection from Castillejo to Toledo promoted by the Marquis of Salamanca was approved in June 1856. The line was opened on 12 June 1858. Tourism fostered by the arrival of rail contributed to the development of the hospitality industry in the late 19th century. By the turn of the 20th century, Toledo&#x27;s population stood at about 23,000. The neighborhood of Santa Bárbara came into existence after the arrival of rail.

Following the July 1936 coup d&#x27;etat in Spain, the acting military commander in Toledo, José Moscardó, refused to provide weapons to Madrid and hid instead in the Alcázar with a garrison of about 1,000 rebels, food, ammunition and some hostages. After 21 July, they became subject to an unsuccessful siege by forces loyal to the Republic during the early stages of the Spanish Civil War. Leading rebel general (and soon-to-be &quot;caudillo&quot;) Francisco Franco and his Army of Africa took a detour from their advance towards Madrid (which gave the Republicans time to build up the defenses in Madrid and receive early foreign support) and lifted the siege of the Alcázar in late September 1936. The two months of resistance of the garrisoned rebel military would become a core symbol of the mythology built around the Francoist regime and its ideology.

In October 1940, Heinrich Himmler, leading Nazi and Chief of German Police, visited Spain on the invitation extended by Director General of Security José Finat y Escrivá de Romaní. The main purpose of the visit was to inspect the Spanish security forces, discuss Spanish-German police cooperation, and prepare for the planned meeting at Hendaye between Franco and Hitler. During his trip, Himmler visited the ruins of the Alcázar. 

By 1950, the population was around 40,243. Urban planning vis-à-vis the development of the neighborhoods of Palomarejos and Polígono ensued in the second half of the 20th century.

In the 1980s, in the context of the creation of the autonomous communities in Spain, Toledo became the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the autonomous community of Castilla–La Mancha, hosting the seat of the Cortes of Castilla–La Mancha (the regional legislature) and the presidency of the regional government (the executive).

Toledo continues to be a major tourist destination, attracting visitors from around the world who come to see historic landmarks, such as the Toledo Cathedral, the Alcázar, and the many synagogues and mosques that reflect its diverse cultural past.

Toledo hosts numerous cultural events and festivals, such as Semana Santa (Holy Week) processions and the Corpus Christi festival, which draw large crowds and celebrate Castilian Spanish religious and cultural traditions.

==Climate==
Toledo has a typical cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;). Winters are cool, while summers are hot and dry. Precipitation is low and mainly concentrated in the period between mid-autumn and mid-spring. The highest temperature ever recorded in Toledo was on 13 August 2021; the lowest was on 12 January 2021.
== Demographics ==
==Economy==

The metal-working industry has historically been Toledo&#x27;s economic base, with a great tradition in the manufacturing of swords and knives and a significant production of razor blades, medical devices, and electrical products. (&quot;The Toledo Blade&quot;, the American newspaper in Toledo&#x27;s Ohio namesake city, is named in honor of the sword-making tradition.) Soap and toothpaste industries, flour milling, glass, and ceramics have also been important.

The manufacture of swords in the city of Toledo goes back to Roman times, but it was under Moorish rule and during the Reconquista that Toledo and its guild of swordsmiths played a key role. Between the 15th and 17th centuries, the Toledo sword-making industry enjoyed a great boom, to the point where Toledo steel came to be regarded as the best in Europe. Swords and daggers were made by individual craftsmen, although the sword-makers guild oversaw their quality. In the late 17th and early 18th century, production began to decline, prompting the creation of the Royal Arms Factory in 1761 by order of King Charles III. The Royal Factory brought together all the sword-makers&#x27; guilds of the city and was located in the former mint. In 1777, recognizing the need to expand the space, Charles commissioned the architect Sabatini to construct a new building on the outskirts of the city. This was the beginning of several phases of expansion. Its importance was such that it eventually developed into a city within the city of Toledo.

In the 20th century, the production of knives and swords for the army was reduced to cavalry weapons only, and, after the Spanish Civil War, to the supply of swords to the officers and NCOs of the various military units. Following the closure of the factory in the 1980s, the building was renovated to house the campus of the Technological University of Castilla–La Mancha in Toledo. According to the Statistical Institute of Castilla–La Mancha, in 2007 the share of employment by sector was as follows: 86.5% of the population engaged in the services, 6.6% in construction, 5.4% in industry and 1.5% in agriculture and livestock.

===Unemployment===
In the decade up to 2008, unemployment in absolute terms remained fairly stable in the city of Toledo, but in 2009 this figure increased significantly: nearly 62% higher than 2008, with the number of unemployed rising from 2,515 to 4,074 (figures at 31 March each year), according to the Junta de Comunidades de Castilla La Mancha. Of this 62%, one-third of the increase took place in the first quarter.

According to other statistics from the same source, almost half the unemployed in the city of Toledo (1,970 persons) are among those whose education does not go beyond the compulsory secondary level. However, there are groups whose level of studies is such that they have not been registered as unemployed, including those who have completed class 1 professional training, or those with virtually nonexistent unemployment rates (less than 0.1%), which is the case of the unemployed with high school degrees or professional expertise.

The largest group among the unemployed is those who have no qualifications (27.27%).

==Politics==
Toledo has a 25-member City Council, elected by closed lists every four years. The 2023 election saw a pact between the 9 members of the People&#x27;s Party and the 4 members of Vox, allowing Carlos Velázquez of the PP to become mayor, a position which had been held by the Socialists since 2007.

==Culture==
The old city is located on a mountaintop with a 150-degree view, surrounded on three sides by a bend in the Tagus River, and contains many historical sites, including the Alcázar, the cathedral (the primate church of Spain), and the Zocodover, a central market place.

From the 4th century to the 16th century, about thirty synods were held at Toledo. The earliest, directed against Priscillian, was assembled in 400. At the synod of 589, the Visigothic king Reccared declared his conversion from Arianism to Catholicism; the synod of 633 decreed uniformity of Catholic liturgy throughout the Visigothic Kingdom and took stringent measures against baptized Jews who had relapsed into their former faith. Other councils forbade circumcision, Jewish rites, and observance of the Sabbath and festivals. Throughout the seventh century, Jews were flogged, executed, had their property confiscated, were subjected to ruinous taxes, forbidden to trade, and, at times, dragged to the baptismal font. The council of 681 assured to the archbishop of Toledo the primacy of Spain. At Guadamur, very close to Toledo, the Treasure of Guarrazar was excavated in 1858, the best example of Visigothic art in Spain.

As nearly one hundred early canons of Toledo found a place in the &quot;Decretum Gratiani&quot;, they exerted an important influence on the development of ecclesiastical law. The synod of 1565–1566 concerned itself with the execution of the decrees of the Council of Trent, and the last council held at Toledo, 1582–1583, was guided in detail by Philip II.

Toledo had large communities of Muslims and Jews until they were expelled from Spain in 1492 (Jews) and 1502 (Mudéjars). Today&#x27;s city contains the religious monuments the Synagogue of Santa María la Blanca, the Synagogue of El Tránsito, the Mosque of Cristo de la Luz and the Church of San Sebastián dating from before the expulsion, still maintained in good condition. Among Ladino-speaking Sephardi Jews, in their various diasporas, the family name Toledano is still prevalent, indicating ancestry from the city (the name is also attested among non-Jews in various Spanish-speaking countries).

In the 13th century, Toledo was a major cultural centre under the guidance of Alfonso X, known as &quot;El Sabio&quot; (&quot;the Wise&quot;) for his love of learning. The Toledo School of Translators, established under Archbishop Raymond of Toledo, continued to bring vast stores of knowledge to Europe by rendering great academic and philosophical works in Arabic into Latin. The Palacio de Galiana, built in the Mudéjar style, is one of the monuments remaining from that period.

The Cathedral of Toledo (&quot;Catedral de Toledo&quot;) was built between 1226 and 1493 and modeled after Bourges Cathedral, though it also combines some characteristics of the Mudéjar style. It is remarkable for its incorporation of light and features a Baroque altar called &quot;El Transparente&quot;, several storeys high, with fantastic figures of stucco, paintings, bronze castings, and several colors of marble, a masterpiece of medieval mixed media by Narciso Tomé. For a few minutes every day, a shaft of light shines through, from which this feature of the cathedral derives its name. The Mozarabic Chapel in the Toledo Cathedral still uses the Mozarabic Rite and music. Two notable bridges secured access to Toledo across the Tagus, the Alcántara bridge and the later built San Martín bridge.

The Monasterio de San Juan de los Reyes is a Franciscan monastery, built 1477–1504, in a remarkable combination of Gothic-Spanish-Flemish style with Mudéjar ornamentation.

Toledo was home to El Greco for the latter part of his life, and is the subject of some of his most famous paintings, including &quot;The Burial of the Count of Orgaz&quot;, exhibited in the Church of Santo Tomé.

When Philip II moved the royal court from Toledo to Madrid in 1561, the old city went into a slow decline from which it never recovered.

===Toledo steel===

Toledo has been a traditional sword-making, steel-working centre since about 500 BCE, and came to the attention of Rome when used by Hannibal in the Punic Wars. Soon, it became a standard source of weaponry for Roman legions.

Toledo steel was famed for its very high quality alloy, whereas Damascene steel, a competitor from the Middle Ages on, was also famed for a specific metal-working technique.

Today there is a significant trade, and many shops offer all kinds of swords to their customers, whether historical or modern swords used in films, as well as armor from the medieval period and other times, which are also exported to other countries.

===Gastronomy===

Some of the local specialties include lamb roast or stew, &quot;cochifrito&quot;, &quot;alubias con perdiz&quot; (beans with partridge) and &quot;perdiz estofoda&quot; (partridge stew), &quot;carcamusa&quot;, &quot;migas&quot;, &quot;gachas manchegas&quot;, and &quot;tortilla a la magra&quot;. In addition, there are local versions of dishes from the nearby capital of Spain, Madrid, as is the case of the &quot;cocido toledano&quot;. Two of the city&#x27;s most famous food products are Manchego cheese and marzipan, which has a Protected Geographical Indication (&quot;mazapán de Toledo&quot;).
===Holidays===

The Virgen del Valle pilgrimage is celebrated on May 1 at the Ermita de la Virgen del Valle, a popular spot for visitors. Holy Week, which has been declared of National Tourist Interest, is marked in spring with various processions (including several on Good Friday) and religious and cultural events. The has held the status of celebration of International Tourist Interest since 1980. It was conventionally celebrated 60 days after Resurrection Sunday. The celebration of Catholic feasts had its heyday during the Baroque, post-Trent period. A processional cortege travels around of streets and richly decorated awnings. The Virgen del Sagrario is celebrated on 15 August, featuring a procession inside the Cathedral and drinking water of the Virgin from jars. Labour Day celebrations begin on the night of April 30.

To mark the fourth centenary of the publication of the first part of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, the Council of Communities of Castilla–La Mancha designed a series of routes through the region crossing various points cited in the novel. Known as the Route of Don Quixote, two of the designated pathways, sections 1 and 8, are based in Toledo; those linking the Castillian city with La Mancha and the Toledo Mountains take advantage of the natural route that passes through the Cigarrales and heads to Cobisa, Burguillos of Toledo and Nambroca, where it takes the Camino Real of Sevilla to suddenly turn towards Mascaraque Almonacid de Toledo, near Mora in La Mancha.

The Mascaraque-Toledo stretch of the Route of Don Quixote has recently been officially included in the Camino de Levante branch of the Camino de Santiago, starting in Valencia and passing through Alicante and Cartagena. Both routes on this stretch have been declared European Cultural Routes.

==Transport==
Toledo has long been an obligatory stop in the centre of the peninsula. The roads leading to historic Toledo are still used and in many cases have provided the basis for existing roads leading into the city.

===Roads===
From Toledo, the N-400 links the city with Cuenca via Ocaña and Tarancón. It is currently in the process of transformation into the future A-40 Castilla–La Mancha motorway, which will link Maqueda (where it joins the Extremadura motorway), Toledo, Ocaña (where it attaches to the Motorway of Andalusia), Tarancón (where it connects with the Levante motorway), Cuenca and Teruel.

The old 401 National Road (Madrid-Toledo-Ciudad Real) was transformed in the late 1980s into the current A-42 as a result of splitting and removing the road that the various crossings included (Illescas, Yuncos, etc.).

The split path extends up to south of Toledo, towards Ciudad Real, where it continues as a conventional road. At this point, the A-42 connects with the Highway of the Vineyard that goes as far as Tomelloso. There are plans to extend the A-42, by a toll road, to Ciudad Real and Jaén.

In the early twenty-first century, the toll motorway AP-41 was built, in order to reduce traffic congestion between Toledo and Madrid.

Toledo is also part of the N-403, Toledo–Maqueda–Ávila–Adanero State Highway Network. Part of the route of this road will be replaced by that of the aforementioned Castilla–La Mancha Highway.

In addition to these roads, several regional and provincial roads link the city with the regions of Montes de Toledo, La Jara, and La Mancha.

===Rail===

In the mid-nineteenth century, Toledo was one of the first Spanish cities to receive rail service, with the arrival of the Madrid – Aranjuez line, which was inaugurated by Isabella II on June 12, 1858. The current Toledo Railway Station, (built in Neo-Mudéjar style), was opened on April 24, 1919.

The line suffered some technical issues and service disruptions but continued to serve as the main intercity route until the early twenty-first century. On July 2, 2003, the last conventional train service between the two capitals ended and work began on a high-speed link to Madrid, which entered service on November 15 2005. The new line reduced the travel time to Madrid to just under 30 minutes.

==Health==
In the early 1960s, construction of the &quot;Virgen de la Salud&quot; Social Security Health Residence began. The original building still remains in use, although successive extensions were added (maternity, outpatient clinics, operating rooms, etc.) to the existing complex. The complex was also extended to move the clinic to a new nearby building, now converted into the San Ildefonso Specialty Centre.
The , inaugurated on 7 October 1974, became a national centre for the treatment of spinal cord injuries. It also focuses on the social integration of patients.

The devolution of healthcare responsibilities to the Junta de Comunidades de Castilla–La Mancha gave new impetus to the health infrastructure, demonstrated in 2007 when construction began on the new General Hospital of Toledo in Santa María de Benquerencia. The different parts of the relevant health centres were also provided.

The Toledo Hospital Complex also features the integrated Geriatric Hospital Virgen del Valle, a result of reform and modernization of the old tuberculosis hospital built in the mid-twentieth century. The centre is located outside the city, near the Parador Nacional de Turismo Conde de Orgaz.

The city also has several private health centers, including Hospital de las Tres Culturas and Clínica Nuestra Señora del Rosario.

==Sport==
Toledo suffered from a shortage of sports facilities. Much of this problem was resolved when the Central School of Physical Education of the Army moved its headquarters to the premises of the Infantry Academy. In the 1990s, the city council took over the old facilities of the military centre, which now include an athletics track, Olympic swimming pool and an indoor sports hall, numerous outdoor courts built in the area of the former runway, having been demolished, and the old gym complex pools (indoor and outdoor).

Besides these facilities, the city of Toledo has sports pavilions in the districts of Santa María de Benquerencia, Santa Bárbara, San Antón (Complejo Deportivo), outdoor pools in Azucaica, Palomarejos, Santa María de Benquerencia, Santa Barbara and Santa Teresa and indoor swimming pools in the gardens of the Alcázar (old town), Santa María de Benquerencia and San Antonio.

Toledo has a football team, CD Toledo, founded on 24 April 1928. Their home turf is the Estadio Salto del Caballo, inaugurated on 23 November 1973. The team played for 7 seasons in the Segunda División, during which it reached the play-off final for promotion to La Liga at the end of the 1993–94 season, losing 4–1 on aggregate to Real Valladolid. Toledo players have included Abel Resino, Luis Garcia, former Arsenal coach Unai Emery, Rufete and Casquero. In the 2024–25 season, CD Toledo will play in the Tercera Federación, the fifth tier of Spanish football.

Toledo has two basketball teams: CB CEI Toledo, with a long history of mixed success in both regional and national leagues (EBA) and has just been promoted to 1st Autonomic, and CB Polígono, whose male team was promoted to the EBA League for the 2009/10 season, seven years after relegation. This club is based in the Santa María de Benquerencia district and has one of the largest youth systems in Castilla–La Mancha.

Toledo has been represented in athletics since 2 April 1979 by the Toledo Athletic Club, which is characterised mainly by its success in cross-country, winning a large number of medals in the Spanish championships, in addition to its (male and female) athletes who competed in the 1st division of the national track league in the late 1990s. Among the athletes who have passed through its lanes are Julio Rey, Roberto Parra, Chema Martinez and Julia Lobato.

Since the victory of Federico Bahamontes, &#x27;The Eagle of Toledo&#x27;, in the 1959 Tour de France, cycling has been one of the most popular sports in the city. At present, however, no school in Santa María de Benquerencia has a velodrome. Other leading professional cyclists from the city include Nemesio Jiménez, who competed at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, and Ángel de las Heras.

The volleyball club Voleibol Asociación Toledo plays in the National First Division, while the popular Toledo Rugby Club competes in the Madrid league system.

At the individual level, the swimmer Javier Noriega and the marathon runner Julio Rey competed in both 2004 Athens Olympics and 2008 Beijing Olympics. Rey, the current Spanish marathon record holder (2 hours, 6 minutes, and 52 seconds) announced his retirement in October 2009.

==Media==

<text>Tristan da Cunha (), colloquially Tristan, is a remote group of volcanic islands in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is one of three constituent parts of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, with its own constitution.

The territory consists of the inhabited island Tristan da Cunha, which has a diameter of roughly and an area of ; the wildlife reserves of Gough Island and Inaccessible Island; and the smaller, uninhabited Nightingale Islands. , the main island had 250 permanent inhabitants, who all carry British Overseas Territories citizenship. The other islands are uninhabited, except for the South African personnel of a weather station on Gough Island.

There is no airstrip on the main island; the only way of travelling to or from Tristan is by ship, a six-day trip from South Africa.

==History==
===Discovery===
The islands were first recorded as sighted in 1506 by Portuguese explorer Tristão da Cunha, though rough seas prevented a landing. He believed them to be uninhabited, and named the main island after himself, . It was later anglicised from its earliest mention on British Admiralty charts to Tristan da Cunha Island. Some sources state that the Portuguese made the first landing in 1520, when &quot;Lás Rafael&quot;, captained by Ruy Vaz Pereira, called at Tristan for water.

The first undisputed landing was made on 7 February 1643 by the crew of the Dutch East India Company ship &quot;Heemstede,&quot; captained by Claes Gerritsz Bierenbroodspot. The Dutch stopped at the island four more times in the next 25years, and in 1656 created the first rough charts of the archipelago.

The first full survey of the archipelago was made by the crew of the French corvette &quot;Heure du Berger&quot; in 1767. The first scientific exploration was conducted by French naturalist Louis-Marie Aubert du Petit-Thouars, who stayed on the island for three days in January 1793, during a French mercantile expedition from Brest, France, to Mauritius. Thouars made botanical collections and reported traces of human habitation, including fireplaces and overgrown gardens, probably left by Dutch explorers in the 17th century.

On his voyage out from Europe to East Africa and India in command of the Imperial Asiatic Company of Trieste and Antwerp ship, &quot;Joseph and Theresa&quot;, William Bolts sighted Tristan da Cunha, put a landing party ashore on 2 February 1777 and hoisted the Imperial flag, naming it and its neighbouring islets the Brabant Islands. However, no settlement or facilities were ever set up there by the company.

After the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War halted penal transportation to the Thirteen Colonies, British prisons started to overcrowd. As several stopgap measures proved to be ineffective, the British Government announced in December 1785 that it would proceed with the settlement of New South Wales. In September 1786 Alexander Dalrymple, presumably goaded by Bolts&#x27;s actions, published a pamphlet with an alternative proposal of his own for settlements on Tristan da Cunha, St. Paul and Amsterdam islands in the Southern Ocean.

Captain John Blankett, R.N., also suggested independently to his superiors in August 1786 that convicts be used to establish a British settlement on Tristan. In consequence, the Admiralty received orders from the government in October 1789 to examine the island as part of a general survey of the South Atlantic and the coasts of southern Africa. That did not happen, but an investigation of Tristan, Amsterdam and St. Paul was undertaken in December 1792 and January 1793 by George Macartney, Britain&#x27;s first ambassador to China. During his voyage to China, he established that none of the islands were suitable for settlement.

===19th century===
The first permanent settler was Jonathan Lambert of Salem, Massachusetts, United States, who moved to the island in December 1810 with two other men, to be joined later by a fourth. Lambert publicly declared the islands his property and named them the Islands of Refreshment. Three of the four men died in 1812 and Thomas Currie (Tommaso Corri, from Livorno, Italy), one of the original three, remained as a farmer on the island.

On 14 August 1816, the United Kingdom annexed the islands by sending a garrison to secure possession, and making them a dependency of the Cape Colony in South Africa. This was explained as a measure to prevent the islands&#x27; use as a base for any attempt to free Napoleon Bonaparte from his prison on Saint Helena. The occupation also prevented the United States from using Tristan da Cunha as a base for naval cruisers, as it had during the War of 1812. The garrison left the islands in November 1817, although some members of the garrison, notably William Glass, stayed and formed the nucleus of a permanent population.

The artist Augustus Earle spent eight months stranded there in 1824. He had been on the aging ship &quot;Duke of Gloucester&quot;, bound for Calcutta, which had anchored there for three days due to a storm. Earle and a crew member were left when the &quot;Gloucester&quot; unexpectedly sailed. Earle tutored several children and painted until his supplies ran out. He was rescued in late November by the ship on its way to Hobart.

The islands were occupied by a garrison of British Marines, and a civilian population gradually grew. stopped there on 25 March 1824 and reported that it had a population of twenty-two men and three women. The barque &quot;South Australia&quot; stayed there on 18–20 February 1836 when a certain Glass was governor, as reported in a chapter on the island by W. H. Leigh. Also in 1836, the schooner &quot;Emily&quot; ran aground with the Dutch fisherman Pieter Groen from Katwijk. He stayed, married there, changed his name to Peter Green and in 1865 became spokesman/governor of the community. In 1856, there were already 97 people living there.

A parson arrived in February 1851, the Bishop of Cape Town visited in March 1856 and the island was included within the diocese of Cape Town.

In 1867, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh and second son of Queen Victoria, visited the islands. The only settlement, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, was named in honour of his visit. On 15 October 1873, the Royal Navy scientific survey vessel HMS &quot;Challenger&quot; docked at Tristan to conduct geographic and zoological surveys on Tristan, Inaccessible Island and the Nightingale Islands. In his log, Captain George Nares recorded a total of fifteen families and eighty-six individuals living on the island. Tristan became a dependency of the British Crown in October 1875.

Whalers set up bases on the islands for operations in the Southern Atlantic. However, the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, together with the gradual transition from sailing ships to coal-fired steam ships, increased the isolation of the islands, which were no longer needed as a stopping port for lengthy sail voyages, or for shelter for journeys from Europe to East Asia.

On 27 November 1885, the island suffered one of its worst tragedies after an iron barque named &quot;West Riding&quot; approached the island, whilst en route to Sydney, Australia, from Bristol. Due to the loss of regular trading opportunities, almost all of the island&#x27;s able-bodied men approached the ship in a lifeboat attempting to trade with the passing vessel. The boat, recently donated by the British government, sailed despite rough waters and, although the lifeboat was spotted sailing alongside the ship for some time, it never returned. Various reports were given following the event, with rumours ranging from the men drowning, to reports of them being taken to Australia and sold as slaves. In total, 15 men were lost, leaving behind an island of widows. A plaque at St. Mary&#x27;s Church commemorates the lost men.

===20th century===

====Hard winter of 1906====
After years of hardship since the 1880s and an especially difficult winter in 1906, the British government offered to evacuate the island in 1907. The Tristanians held a meeting and decided to refuse, despite the government&#x27;s warning that it could not promise further help in the future.

====Occasional pre-war visits====
No ships called at the islands from 1909 until 1919, when HMS &quot;Yarmouth&quot; stopped to inform the islanders of the outcome of World War I.

The Shackleton–Rowett Expedition stopped in Tristan for five days in May 1922, collecting geological and botanical samples before returning to Cape Town. Among the few ships that visited in the coming years were the RMS &quot;Asturias&quot;, a Royal Mail Steam Packet Company passenger liner, in 1927, and the Canadian Pacific ocean liners RMS &quot;Empress of France&quot; in 1928, in 1929, and RMS &quot;Empress of Australia&quot; in 1935.

In 1936, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; of London reported that the population of the island was 167 people, with 185 cattle and 42 horses.

From December 1937 to March 1938, a Norwegian party made a dedicated scientific expedition to Tristan da Cunha, and sociologist Peter A. Munch extensively documented island culture; he visited the island again in 1964–1965. The island was also visited in 1938 by W. Robert Foran, reporting for the National Geographic Society. His account was published that same year.

On 12 January 1938 by letters patent, Britain declared the islands a dependency of Saint Helena, creating the British Crown Colony of Saint Helena and Dependencies, which also included Ascension Island.

====World War II military development====
During the Second World War, Tristan was commissioned by the Royal Navy as the so-called &quot;stone frigate&quot; and used as a secret signals intelligence station, to monitor German U-boats (which were required to maintain radio contact) and shipping in the South Atlantic Ocean. The weather and radio stations led to extensive new infrastructure being built on the island, including a school, a hospital, and a cash-based general store.

The first colonial official sent to rule the island was Sir Hugh Elliott in the rank of administrator (because the settlement was too small to merit a governor) 1950–1953. Development continued as the island&#x27;s first canning factory expanded paid employment in 1949.

====Rare post-war ship visits====
Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen&#x27;s consort, visited the islands in 1957 as part of a world tour on board the royal yacht HMY &quot;Britannia&quot;.

On 2 January 1954, Tristan da Cunha was visited by the Dutch ship &quot;Willem Ruys&quot;, a passenger-cargo liner, carrying science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein, his wife Ginny and other passengers. The &quot;Ruys&quot; was travelling from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Cape Town, South Africa. The visit is described in Heinlein&#x27;s book &quot;Tramp Royale&quot;. The captain told Heinlein the island was the most isolated inhabited spot on Earth and ships rarely visited. Heinlein mailed a letter from there to L. Ron Hubbard, a friend who also liked to travel, &quot;for the curiosity value of the postmark&quot;. Biographer William H. Patterson Jr. in his two volume &quot;Robert A. Heinlein In Dialogue with his Century&quot;, wrote that lack of &quot;cultural context&quot; made it &quot;nearly impossible to converse&quot; with the islanders, &quot;a stark contrast with the way they had managed to chat with strangers&quot; while travelling in South America. Members of the crew bought penguins during their brief visit to the island.

====1961 eruption of Queen Mary&#x27;s Peak====
On 10 October 1961, the eruption of a parasitic cone of Queen Mary&#x27;s Peak, very close to Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, forced evacuation of all 264 people. The evacuees took to the water in open boats, taken by the local lobster-fishing boats &quot;Tristania&quot; and &quot;Frances Repetto&quot; to uninhabited Nightingale Island.

The next day, they were picked up by the diverted Dutch passenger ship &quot;Tjisadane&quot; that took them to Cape Town. The islanders later arrived in the U.K. aboard the liner M.V. &quot;Stirling Castle&quot; to a big press reception and, after a short period at Pendell Army Camp in Merstham, Surrey, were settled in an old Royal Air Force camp near Calshot, Hampshire.

The following year, a Royal Society expedition reported that Edinburgh of the Seven Seas had survived. Most families returned in 1963.

====Gough and Inaccessible Islands wildlife reserves====
Gough Island was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995 as Gough Island Wildlife Reserve. This was further extended in 2004 as Gough and Inaccessible Islands, with its marine zone extended from 3 to 12 nautical miles.

These islands have been Ramsar sites – wetlands of international importance – since 20 November 2008.

===21st century===
On 23 May 2001, the islands were hit by an extratropical cyclone that generated winds up to . A number of structures were severely damaged, and numerous cattle were killed, prompting emergency aid provided by the British government.
In 2005, the islands were given a United Kingdom post code (TDCU 1ZZ), to make it easier for the residents to order goods online.

On 13 February 2008, a fire destroyed the island&#x27;s four power generators and fish canning factory, severely disrupting the economy. On 14 March 2008, new generators were installed and power restored, and a new factory opened in July 2009. While the replacement factory was built, M/V &quot;Kelso&quot; came to the island as a factory ship. The St. Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha Constitution Order 2009 reorganized Tristan da Cunha as a constituent of the new British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, giving Tristan and Ascension equal status with Saint Helena.

On 16 March 2011, the freighter ran aground on Nightingale Island, spilling tons of heavy fuel oil into the ocean. The resulting oil slick threatened the island&#x27;s population of rockhopper penguins. Nightingale Island has no fresh water, so the penguins were transported to Tristan da Cunha for cleaning.

On 13 November 2020 it was announced that the of the waters surrounding the islands will become a Marine Protection Zone. The move will make the zone the largest no-take zone in the Atlantic and the fourth largest on the planet. The move follows 20 years of conservation work by the RSPB and the island government and five years of the UK government&#x27;s Blue Belt programme support.

A total solar eclipse will pass over the island on 5 December 2048. The island is calculated to be on the centre line of the umbra&#x27;s path for nearly three and a half minutes of totality.


==Geography==

Tristan da Cunha is thought to have been formed by a long-lived centre of upwelling mantle called the Tristan hotspot. Tristan da Cunha is the main island of the Tristan da Cunha archipelago, which consists of the following islands:

* Tristan da Cunha, the main and largest island, area: ()
* Inaccessible Island, area: 
* Nightingale Islands, area: 
** Nightingale Island, area: 
** Middle Island, area: 
** Stoltenhoff Island, area: 
* Gough Island (&quot;Diego Alvarez&quot;), area: 

Inaccessible Island and the Nightingale Islands are SW by W and SSW away from the main island, respectively, whereas Gough Island is SSE.
The main island is generally mountainous. The only flat area is on the north-west coast, which is the location of the only settlement, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, and the agricultural area of Potato Patches. The highest point is the summit of a volcano called Queen Mary&#x27;s Peak at an elevation of , high enough to develop snow cover in winter. The other islands of the group are uninhabited, except for a weather station with a staff of six on Gough Island, which has been operated by South Africa since 1956 and has been at its present location at Transvaal Bay on the southeast coast since 1963.
===Climate===
The archipelago has a Cfb, wet oceanic climate, under the Köppen system, with mild temperatures and very limited sunshine but consistent moderate-to-heavy rainfall due to the persistent westerly winds. Under the Trewartha classification, Tristan da Cunha has a humid subtropical climate due to the lack of cold weather. The number of rainy days is comparable to the Aleutian Islands at a much higher latitude in the northern hemisphere, while sunshine hours are comparable to Juneau, Alaska, 20° farther from the equator. Frost is unknown below elevations of , and summer temperatures are similarly mild, never reaching . Sandy Point on the east coast is reputed to be the warmest and driest place on the island, being in the lee of the prevailing winds.

==Geology==
Tristan, along with its neighbouring islands, lies about 400 km east of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The volcanic activity is unrelated to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge; rather, it is due to a hotspot.
The steep central cone (The Peak) predominantly is composed of pyroclastic deposits erupted from the central vent. The Base and Main Cliffs are composed mainly of thin basaltic lava flows, commonly separated by thin pyroclastic layers. There are over 30 cinder cones on the flanks of the main volcano, many of which have produced small lava flows. The October 1961 eruption was preceded by earthquake swarms and rock falls from the Main Cliffs, then lava was erupted on the plain immediately east of the settlement. The growing lava mound breached and lava flows were erupted toward the coast. As the eruption waned, an elongate lava dome grew and sealed the vent.

Inaccessible Island, 35 km southwest of Tristan, is the relic of an older volcanic cone. Most of the island is composed of basaltic lava flows, but the southwestern part of Inaccessible has numerous trachyte domes and flows.
Nightingale Island, and nearby Middle and Stoltenhoff Islands, are 34 km south-southwest of Tristan. Nightingale mostly is composed of trachyte domes and flows, with some pyroclastic deposits. Middle Island is entirely composed of pyroclastic deposits (intruded by dykes), whereas Stoltenhoff Island is entirely composed of trachyte.

===Volcanoes===
Tristan da Cunha has two volcanoes: Queen Mary&#x27;s Peak on the main island and Edinburgh Peak on Gough Island. Queen Mary&#x27;s Peak () has a height of and remains active, with its last eruption reported to have occurred in 1961. Edinburgh Peak () has a height of and is classified as extinct.

==Geochemistry and tectonic significance==
The volcanic rocks range from ankaramitic basanite through tephrite to phonolite and some have ultra-potassic compositions, which is unusual for rocks that erupted close to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. They exemplify the EM1 pole in compilations of isotopic compositions of mantle-derived rocks. The unusual composition is explained by the presence of enriched material in the plume source, either recycled sediments or metasomatized lithosphere. The origin of the islands is commonly attributed to partial melting in a mantle plume. The islands are located at the western end of the Walvis Ridge, which links the islands to the Etendeka large igneous province. This association has been cited as an example of plume head and tail hypothesis, but the geochemical characteristics of Tristan lavas differ from those of the Etendeka province, which suggests that the plume was heterogeneous.

==Flora and fauna==

Many of the flora and fauna of the archipelago have a broad circumpolar distribution in the South Atlantic and South Pacific Oceans. For example, the plant species &quot;Nertera granadensis&quot; was first collected in Tristan da Cunha, but has since been recorded as far away as New Zealand.

=== Invasive species ===
The islands of Tristan da Cunha have a high significance of global biodiversity: two of them, Gough and Inaccessible, form a UNESCO natural World Heritage Site. This designation is largely due to the seabird population found there. The biodiversity of the island is vulnerable to introduction of invasive species. Due to Tristan da Cunha&#x27;s isolated archipelago ecology, and increase of tourism with cruise ships and research vessels, invasive species are a particular concern for Tristan da Cunha. The islands&#x27; vegetation and mammal species are not equipped to defend against or control introduced species, increasing island vulnerability, due to lack of defensive behavioural mechanisms and slow generational output rates. Efforts to decrease and eradicate invasive flora, fauna, and marine species have been undertaken, including a programme aimed at eradicating predatory invasive mice on Gough Island. The following described invasive species have been known to have harmful effects on the islands&#x27; vegetation and native species.

Invasive house mice on these islands have adapted to be 50% larger than average house mice. They are thought to have been accidentally introduced by 19th-century seal hunters who would dock on the islands. These mice have adapted by consuming sea bird eggs and chicks (as they nest on the ground). Gathering at night in groups of 9 or 10, the mice gather at the bird&#x27;s nest to feast. With no natural predators, the invasive mice population is able to expand by producing new generations twice a year.

In order to prevent the growth of the invasive mice population and extinction of the Albatross bird species, a 2019 Gough Island mouse eradication project was announced (Grundy, 2018). The RSPB and Tristan da Cunha Government have partnered to spread cereal pellets with rodenticide bait across Gough Island, in hopes to eradicate the invasive mice population. The goal of this operation is to restore Tristan da Cunha to its natural state, ensuring it will still be one of the world&#x27;s most important seabird nesting sites.

===Flora===

====Native plants ====


A combination of the list on Kew&#x27;s &quot;Plants of the World Online&quot; site with information from a paper by Wace and Holdgate yields the following list (by no means exhaustive) of plant species recorded as native to Tristan da Cunha.

; Eudicots :
; Commelinids :
; Ferns, mosses and clubmosses :
====Introduced plants====

Tristan da Cunha acquired an estimated 137 non-native vascular plants that can be categorized into four species types; weeds (trees, shrubs, agricultural weeds), grassland species (grasses), garden escapes (vegetables), and other ruderal species. Vascular plants were accidentally introduced in a variety of ways including: impurities in flower or vegetable seeds; seeds or plant fragments from other imported plants; and in soil, attached to containers, cars or people. The majority of invasive weed species that have been introduced to the island are spread by seed and cover 50% of arable land in widely distributed patches. These species include prickly sow-thistle (&quot;Sonchus asper&quot;), smooth sow-thistle (&quot;Sonchus oleraceus&quot;), smooth hawksbeard (&quot;Crepis capillaris&quot;), scrambling fumitory (&quot;Fumaria muralis&quot;), green field speedwell (&quot;Veronica agrestis&quot;), groundsel (&quot;Senecio vulgaris&quot;), and nutgrass (&quot;Cyperus esculentus&quot;). Other invasive weed species that have a more localized distribution in plots include prickly sow-thistle (&quot;Sonchus asper&quot;), smooth sow-thistle (&quot;Sonchus oleraceus&quot;), smooth hawksbeard (&quot;Crepis capillaris&quot;), and groundsel (&quot;Senecio vulgaris&quot;). Whether a species is distributed locally or widely depends on the seed&#x27;s dispersal mechanisms; larger seeds that have not adapted to wind dispersal will be distributed locally, while smaller seeds that have adapted to wind dispersal will be widely distributed.

The invasive plants have had several negative impacts on native island plant species, including the competitive exclusion of many such species. The out-competition can and will alter the structure of plant communities and the quality of the islands&#x27; soil. Introduced vegetation has altered long-term carbon storage as well as the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere. Native plants such as fern bushes, &quot;Phylica&quot; bushes, fern brakes, mires, and bogs, contain high organic content matter which functions as storage for carbon. With the introduction of harmful species, the islands will see a decrease in carbon storage of both the soil and vegetation. With multiple changes occurring within the soil due to invasive plant species, the nutrient cycle is bound to be negatively influenced. Invasive plants are also affecting the human population of Tristan da Cunha by being disease carriers and becoming agricultural pests in gardens and pastures.

The alien plants are able to survive and continue to grow and spread successfully on the islands because they have the ability to naturalize in temperate regions and have limited necessities needed to survive. The islands&#x27; isolation increases archipelago ecology uniqueness, which increases susceptibility to foreign invaders. A small human population with minimal development encourages flora and fauna development within a limited food web, which increases the invasive species&#x27; abilities for self-defense.

Plants are being controlled by taking surveys of the invasive species, evaluating their impact on biodiversity, and evaluating the feasibility of their eradication. It would be nearly impossible to try and eradicate all invasive plant species, so scientists are narrowing down to control particular species based on their impact and feasibility to eradicate. Mitigation plans that are taking place on Tristan are time-consuming and labor-intensive that will take several years using mechanical and chemical procedures.

===Fauna===

====Land====
Tristan is primarily known for its wildlife. The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because there are 13 known species of breeding seabirds on the island and two species of resident land birds. The seabirds include northern rockhopper penguins, Atlantic yellow-nosed albatrosses, sooty albatrosses, Atlantic petrels, great-winged petrels, soft-plumaged petrels, broad-billed prions, grey petrels, great shearwaters, sooty shearwaters, Tristan skuas, Antarctic terns and brown noddies. Tristan and Gough Islands are the only known breeding sites in the world for the Atlantic petrel. Inaccessible Island is also the only known breeding ground of the spectacled petrel. The Tristan albatross is known to breed only on Gough and Inaccessible Islands: all nest on Gough, except for one or two pairs which nest on Inaccessible Island.

The endemic Tristan thrush, also known as the &quot;starchy&quot;, occurs on all of the northern islands and each has its own subspecies, with Tristan birds being slightly smaller and duller than those on Nightingale and Inaccessible. The endemic Inaccessible Island rail, the smallest extant flightless bird in the world, is found only on Inaccessible Island. In 1956, eight Gough moorhens were released at Sandy Point on Tristan and have subsequently colonised the island.

====Marine====
The largest no take zone in the Atlantic, and at , the fourth largest in the world, was designated on 13 November 2020. The Marine Protected Area bans mining and fishing (except the local lobster fishery), with enforcement the responsibility of the UK government via satellite surveillance. According to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), the islands and surrounding ocean is one of the most pristine temperate ecosystems on the planet.

Various species of whales and dolphins can be seen around Tristan from time to time with increasing sighting rates, although recovery of baleen whales, especially the southern right whale, were severely hindered by illegal whaling by the Soviet Union in the aftermath of the 1960 volcanic eruption. The subantarctic fur seal (&quot;Arctophoca tropicalis&quot;) can also be found in the Tristan archipelago, mostly on Gough Island.

The biodiversity of marine life is limited given the islands&#x27; isolation, making identifying the impacts of invasion difficult. While much of the marine life is unknown, there has been an invasive species identified in the waters around the islands. This species is the South American silver porgy (&quot;Diplodus argenteus argenteus&quot;), which is thought to have sought refuge in the area due to the wreck of an oil platform off the coast of Tristan in 2006. The silver porgy is omnivorous, but is not linked to the consumption of the valued lobster populations that the islanders fish. The silver porgy is however suspected to be consuming components of the islands&#x27; fragile kelp forest. The giant kelp forests of &quot;Macrocystis pyrifera&quot; are extremely limited in biodiversity and have a simple, short-chain food web. While this species is considered non-native and invasive, removal efforts are currently not prioritized. Continued monitoring is suggested, and expedition research for all invasive marine species is ongoing.

==Economy==
The island has a unique social and economic structure in which all resident families farm and all land is communally owned. Outsiders are prohibited from buying land or settling on Tristan. Besides subsistence agriculture, major industries are commercial fishing and government. Major export industries are the Tristan rock lobster (&quot;Jasus&quot;) fishery, the sale of the island&#x27;s postage stamps and coins, and limited tourism. Like most British Overseas Territories, it was never a part of the European Union, but was a member of the EU&#x27;s Overseas Countries and Territories Association.

The Bank of Saint Helena was established on Saint Helena and Ascension Island in 2004. This bank does not have a physical presence on Tristan da Cunha, but residents of Tristan are entitled to its services. Although Tristan da Cunha is part of the same overseas territory as Saint Helena, it does not use the local Saint Helena pound; sterling is used directly instead.

The island is located in the South Atlantic Anomaly, an area of the Earth with an abnormally weak magnetic field. On 14 November 2008 a geomagnetic observatory was inaugurated on the island as part of a joint venture between the Danish Meteorological Institute and DTU Space.

===Transport===

The remote location of the islands makes transport to the outside world difficult. Tristan da Cunha has no airstrip and is not generally accessible to air travel, though the wider territory is served by Saint Helena Airport and RAF Ascension Island. Fishing boats from South Africa provide transport service to the islands eight or nine times per year.

The RMS &quot;St Helena&quot; used to connect the main island to St Helena and South Africa once each year during its January voyage, but has done so only a few times in the last years – in 2006, in 2011, and most recently in 2018. In the same year the RMS &quot;St Helena&quot; was withdrawn from service. Three ships, the MV &quot;Lance&quot;, the MFV &quot;Edinburgh&quot;, and the SA &quot;Agulhas II&quot;, regularly service Tristan da Cunha from Cape Town, with typically fewer than a dozen visits a year. Other vessels may occasionally visit the island. The harbour at Edinburgh of the Seven Seas is called Calshot Harbour, named after the place in Hampshire, England, where the islanders temporarily stayed during the 1961–1963 Queen Mary&#x27;s Peak volcanic eruption.

=== Tourism ===
Unlike Saint Helena with its airport, hotels, and restaurants, due to its remoteness, Tristan da Cunha has a very small tourism industry. As the island can only be reached from Cape Town in rough seas on vessels with limited vacancies, a trip must be planned months in advance, and only after a visit request is approved by the Island Council.

Occasional boats or cruises may include a short visit to the island in their itinerary; but as there is no deep harbour, setting ashore is highly dependent on the maritime conditions. All visitors staying on Tristan must have a confirmed and fully paid return ticket, health insurance to include cover in case of medical evacuation to Cape Town, and sufficient funds to cover their entire stay. There are no hotels on the island. A visitor can rent a guest house (catered or self-catering) or stay in a private home on a full-board basis. There is a Tourism Post Office that sells souvenirs that might take months to arrive if ordered online.

The Tristan Government, along with the Tristan Association, set up a public website in 2017. The website has many pages, which include an online shop, a list of recent news about and on the island, and a simple online tour.

===Communications===
==== Telecommunication ====

The ITU has assigned telephone country code +290 for Tristan da Cunha; however, residents have access to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Telecommunications Network, provided by Global Crossing. This service uses a London 020 numbering range, meaning that numbers are accessed via the UK telephone numbering plan. Satellite-delivered internet access arrived in Tristan da Cunha in 1998, but its high cost initially made it almost unaffordable for the local population, who primarily used it only to send e‑mail. The connection was also extremely unreliable, connecting through a 64 kbit/s satellite phone connection provided by Inmarsat. On 16 September 2024, satellite internet via StarLink was made available on the island, offering much higher speeds than previously available.

Since 2006, a very-small-aperture terminal has provided bandwidth for government purposes that is also made available via an internet café and (after office hours) via Wi-Fi to island homes. , there is not yet any mobile telephone coverage on the islands.

The Government and Tristan da Cunha Association jointly run the island official website with all practical information, news, and facts about the island. While the site is updated from mainland UK, due to slow internet, the photos taken and uploaded from Tristan da Cunha are all in low resolution, which allows online navigation in the territory with acceptable speed.

====Amateur radio====
Amateur radio operator groups sometimes conduct DX-peditions on the island. One group operated as station ZD9ZS in September–October 2014.

==Government==

There are no political parties or trade unions on Tristan. Executive authority is vested in the King, who is represented in the territory by the governor of Tristan da Cunha. Prior to 2009, Tristan da Cunha was a dependency of Saint Helena, and therefore directly represented by the governor of Saint Helena. The &quot;St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha Constitution Order 2009&quot; made Saint Helena, Ascension Island, and Tristan da Cunha equal constituent parts of the territory with their own governments, and established the position of Governor of Tristan da Cunha. Per Section 208 of the Constitution Order, the person appointed as Governor of Saint Helena is &quot;ex officio&quot; Governor of Tristan da Cunha. However, as Tristan da Cunha is away from Saint Helena, an Administrator of Tristan da Cunha is appointed to act as the governor&#x27;s representative on the island.

This arrangement predates the current constitutional structure, and the first administrator was appointed in the 1940s. Previously, the administrator also acted as the local magistrate, but the appointment is to be transferred to a non-member of the executive or legislative branches of government. The administrator is a career civil servant in the Foreign Office, selected by London, who acts as the local head of government and takes advice from the Tristan da Cunha Island Council. Since 1998, each administrator has usually served a three-year term (which begins in September, upon arrival of the supply ship from Cape Town). Fiona Kilpatrick and Stephen Townsend were exceptions to this rule, having taken up their job-share office in January 2020.

The Administrator and Island Council work from the Government Building, which is the only two-story building on the island. The building is sometimes referred to as &quot;Whitehall&quot; or the &quot;H&#x27;admin Building&quot; and contains the Administrator&#x27;s Office, Treasury Department, Administration Offices, and the Council Chamber where Island Council meetings are held. Policing is undertaken by one full-time police inspector and three special constables. Tristan da Cunha has some legislation of its own, but the law of Saint Helena applies generally to the extent that it is not inconsistent with local law, insofar as it is suitable for local circumstances and subject to such modifications as local circumstances make necessary.

===Chief Islander===
The Island Council is made up of eight elected and three appointed members, who serve a three-year term beginning in February or March. A separate but simultaneous vote is held to select the Chief Islander, who is the community&#x27;s political leader. James Glass was re-elected to the position in March 2022 to a record-breaking fifth term in the role.

==Demographics==
Tristan da Cunha recorded a population of 243 in the June 2021 census. The only settlement is Edinburgh of the Seven Seas (known locally as &quot;The Settlement&quot;). The current residents are thought to have descended from fifteen outside ancestors, eight male and seven female, who arrived on the island at various dates between 1816 and 1908. The men were European, and the women were mixed race. Now all of the population has mixed ancestry. In addition, a male contributor of eastern European / Russian descent arrived in the early 1900s. In 1963, when families returned after the evacuation due to the 1961 volcanic eruption, the 200 settlers included four Tristan da Cunha women who brought with them new English husbands.
 

The female descendants have been traced by genetic study to five female founders, believed to be mixed-race (African, Asian, and European descent) and from Saint Helena. The historical data recounted that there were two pairs of sisters, but the mtDNA evidence showed only one pair of sisters.

The early male founders originated from Scotland, England, the Netherlands, the United States, and Italy, who belonged to three Y-haplogroups: I (M170), R-SRY10831.2, and R (M207) (xSRY10831.2). The male founders shared seven surnames: Glass, Green, Hagan, Lavarello, Repetto, Rogers, and Swain. The surnames Collins, Squibb, and Patterson were brought to the island by Tristanian women, returning with their English husbands from the evacuation of the early 1960s. The surnames Collins and Squibb continue to be used on the island. In addition, a new haplotype was found that is associated with men from Eastern Europe and Russia. It entered the population in the early 1900s, at a time when the island was visited by Russian sailing ships. There is &quot;evidence for the contribution of a hidden ancestor who left his genes, but not his name, on the island.&quot; Another four instances of non-paternity were found among male descendants, but researchers believed their fathers were probably among the early island population.


There are eighty families on the island. Like many remote island communities, Tristan da Cunha has a shrinking, ageing population. In the past, Tristan da Cunha mothers had to travel to Cape Town to give birth, but since the opening of the Camogli Healthcare Centre in 2017 have been able to give birth on the island.

==Language==
===Phonetics and phonology===
Tristan da Cunha English, also locally called Tristanian, is spoken on the isolated island in the South Atlantic. It is the smallest and most isolated native-speaker community of English. It is a form of South Atlantic English, and shares similarities with Saint Helenian English. Tristanian has several notable unique phonetic and phonological characteristics, such as the following.
* The vowel in words like &quot;face&quot; is non-diphthongized, pronounced as [fe:s].
* Stops, such as the medial consonants in &quot;button&quot;, &quot;bottle&quot;, and &quot;people&quot;, are glottalized.
* Extensive insertion of the sound [h] occurs in words like &quot;happle&quot; and &quot;hafter&quot;, merging the pronunciation of &quot;island&quot; with &quot;highland&quot;.
* Devoicing of the medial -z- and -zh- sounds is common, resulting in pronunciations like &quot;sea[s]on&quot; and &quot;televi[sh]ion&quot; with [s] and [sh] respectively.
* Tristan da Cunha English is non-rhotic, with linking and intrusive [r] sounds.

=== Grammar ===
Tristan da Cunha English shares non-standard grammatical features with other English varieties in the Falkland Islands and St. Helena. Among its features:
* Plural marking after numbers is absent, as seen in constructions like &quot;five pound&quot;.
* Distinct second person plural pronouns are used, such as &quot;y&#x27;all&quot; and &quot;you&#x27;s&quot;.
* Verbal inflectional morphology is simplified, as in &quot;She sing real good&quot; and &quot;They never eat much them days.&quot;
* The pronoun &quot;them&quot; is used to mark definite noun phrases, as seen in sentences like &quot;They never eat much them days.&quot;
* Expressiveness drives peculiarities in Tristan da Cunha English, including double comparatives (e.g., &quot;I like that more better&quot;) and double negation (e.g., &quot;nobody never come out or nothing&quot;).
* In questions, inversion is not used, as in constructions like &quot;Where they is?&quot;

== Education ==

Children leave school at age 16, and although they can take GCSEs, few do. The school on the island is St. Mary&#x27;s School, which serves children from ages 4 to 16. The Naval Station had established a school building during World War II. The current facility opened in 1975 and has five classrooms, a kitchen, a stage, a computer room, and a craft and science room. Tristan students doing post-16 education receive assistance from the Tristan da Cunha Association Education Trust Fund and typically do so in the United Kingdom and South Africa.

The Tristan Song Project was a collaboration between St. Mary&#x27;s School and amateur composers in Britain, led by music teacher Tony Triggs. It began in 2010 and involved St. Mary&#x27;s pupils writing poems and Triggs providing musical settings by himself and his pupils. A desktop publication entitled &quot;Rockhopper Penguins and Other Songs&quot; (2010) embraced most of the songs completed that year and funded a consignment of guitars to the school. In February 2013, the Tristan Post Office issued a set of four Song Project stamps featuring island musical instruments and lyrics from Song Project songs about Tristan&#x27;s volcano and wildlife. In 2014, the project broadened its scope and continues as the International Song Project.

== Religion ==
Approximately 80% of the population is Anglican, and 20% is Roman Catholic. The Roman Catholic population is served by the Mission &quot;sui iuris&quot; of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, which is administratively a part of the Apostolic Prefecture of the Falkland Islands. Edwin Dodgson, youngest brother of Lewis Carroll, spent several years as a missionary on the island in the nineteenth century.

== Health ==
Healthcare is funded by the government, undertaken at most times by one resident doctor. Surgery or facilities for complex childbirth are therefore limited, and emergencies can necessitate communicating with passing fishing vessels so the injured person can be ferried to Cape Town.

As of late 2007, IBM and Beacon Equity Partners, co-operating with Medweb, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and the island&#x27;s government on &quot;Project Tristan&quot;, had supplied the island&#x27;s doctor with access to long distance tele-medical help, making it possible to send EKG and X-ray pictures to doctors in other countries for instant consultation.

The Camogli Healthcare Centre, usually referred to as &quot;the hospital&quot;, was built and equipped in 2016–2017 to the latest UK National Health Service (NHS) standards and was officially opened on 7 June 2017. It is located in the southwestern corner of the settlement below the previous hospital (built in 1971), which is now used by the veterinarians, and for general storage. The new hospital was funded by the UK Department for International Development with the intention that the improved facilities would allow more procedures to be performed locally by visiting specialists, and therefore reduce the need for expensive referrals to Cape Town.

There are normally two expatriate doctors on the island, who provide 24-hour cover. There are also normally two expatriate and four local nurses, as well as two dental technicians, a hospital manager, and ancillary staff. The medical staff deal with day-to-day medical matters, handle emergency cases, and undertake minor surgery. More complex and serious cases are transported to Cape Town for treatment, as were all expectant mothers for their deliveries until the Camogli Healthcare Centre was completed in 2017 and new medical facilities enabled local mothers to give birth on the island. As of 2022, five babies had been born in the island&#x27;s Camogli Healthcare Centre.

There are instances of health problems attributed to endogamy, including glaucoma. In addition, there is a very high (42%) incidence of asthma among the population, and research by Noe Zamel of the University of Toronto has led to discoveries about the genetic nature of the disease. Three of the original settlers of the island had asthma.

==Culture==

=== Music and traditional dance ===
Tristan residents Mary Swain and Percy Lavarello were recorded in 1962 whilst evacuated in Calshot, Hampshire, by Maud Karpeles and Peter Kennedy singing traditional songs and discussing the culture of the island, mainly music and dance; the full recording (split between seven tapes and also including other Tristan residents) can be heard on the British Library Sound Archive website. On these tapes, Mary Swain sings traditional English folk songs learnt from her mother, including seventeenth-century Child Ballads such as &quot;Barbara Allen&quot; and &quot;The Golden Vanity&quot;. She also describes how dance was an important element of life on Tristan; well-known dances such as step dances, waltzes, polkas, mazurkas and schottisches were common, as well as many unique traditional dances such as &quot;The Donkey Dance&quot;, &quot;The Pillow Dance&quot;, &quot;The Chair Dance&quot; and something called &quot;Tabby Oaker&#x27;s Big Toe&quot; which involved displaying one&#x27;s feet. It seems that the music and dance of Tristan was ultimately derived from English traditions, but various peculiarities had developed.


===Crime===
Between 1988 and 2010, no one was arrested for crime by the single policeman on the island.

===Radio and television===
Local television began in 1984 using taped programming on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday evenings. Live television did not arrive on the island until 2001, with the introduction of the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS TV), which now provides six channels: BBC One, BBC Two, ITV, Channel 4, Sky News and BFBS Extra, relayed to islanders via local transmitters. Recently the service was upgraded to digital, most TV screens are modern and DTV while some older analogue CRT equipments still are in use with digital boxes connected and there is at least one TV set per house. BFBS Radio 2 is the locally available radio station.

=== Newspapers ===
The &quot;Tristan Times&quot; was an online newspaper for the island published from 2003 to 2019. The island government also posts news announcements on its website, which is maintained by the UK-based Tristan da Cunha Association.

===Holidays and holiday traditions===
The island holds an annual break from government and factory work, which begins before Christmas and lasts for three weeks. The beginning of the holiday, called Break-Up Day, is usually marked with parties and celebrations. The islanders would traditionally have parties on Boxing Day, but not on Christmas Day.

Traditionally, on &quot;Old Year&#x27;s Day/Night&quot; (meaning &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot;), the islanders would conceal their identities with masks or blackface and the men would wear women&#x27;s clothing; everyone would celebrate anonymously moving between households, singing songs, dancing, shouting, playing instruments and firing guns. At the stroke of midnight, a bell would announce the new year. On New Year&#x27;s Day, the islanders would play cricket and football, and once again party later in the day. The disguises sometimes recall English Border Morris dancers.

=== Sport ===
Football, cricket and baseball were all historically played on the island.

It has been reported that football was introduced to the locals in the 1920s by Rev. Henry Rogers, and it remains the island&#x27;s favourite sport. Rose, Henry&#x27;s wife, wrote about informal kick-abouts continuing for years, and these fast became a part of Tristanian culture. The islanders would split themselves into two teams and play friendly matches, especially on dates of special occasions, such as weddings, christenings etc.

In 1940 Tristan da Cunha&#x27;s footballers played their first &quot;international&quot; game against the crew of a Norwegian ship. No record remains of the score. In the ensuing years, the game flourished, with the islanders playing matches against crews from vessels of various nationalities, including ships from the Royal Navy.

With live transmissions of televised football, the sport regained its former popularity. Tristan da Cunha FC was formed in 2002. A local fishing company bought them a kit (white shirts and blue shorts). They had a very basic pitch on American Field, named in recognition of the American forces stationed there during World War II. However, opponents were in short supply. It was a case of waiting for visiting opponents, and sometimes years might go by without any opportunities to play foreign opposition. Their first match was against a South African fishing vessel and they lost 10–6. The remoteness of Tristan da Cunha makes it virtually impossible for the team to travel abroad to play against foreign opposition. In recent times, the club&#x27;s numbers have dropped to a level where only 5-a-side matches are being played.

== Notable people ==

<text>Thomas Riley Marshall (March 14, 1854 – June 1, 1925) was an American politician who served as the 28th vice president of the United States from 1913 to 1921 under President Woodrow Wilson. A prominent lawyer in Indiana, he became an active and well known member of the Democratic Party by stumping across the state for other candidates and organizing party rallies that later helped him win election as the 27th governor of Indiana. In office, he attempted to implement changes from his progressive agenda to the Constitution of Indiana, but his efforts proved controversial and were blocked by the Indiana Supreme Court.

Marshall&#x27;s popularity as Indiana governor, and the state&#x27;s status as a critical swing state, helped him secure the Democratic vice presidential nomination on a ticket with Wilson in 1912 and win the subsequent general election. An ideological rift developed between the two men during their first term leading Wilson to limit Marshall&#x27;s influence in the administration. Marshall&#x27;s brand of humor caused Wilson to move his office away from the White House, further isolating him. Marshall was targeted in an assassination attempt in 1915 for supporting intervention in World War I. During Marshall&#x27;s second term he delivered morale-boosting speeches across the nation during the war and became the first U.S. vice president to hold cabinet meetings, which he did while Wilson was in Europe during peace negotiations. As he was president of the United States Senate, a small number of anti-war Senators kept it deadlocked by refusing to end debate. To enable critical wartime legislation to be passed, Marshall had the body adopt its first procedural rule allowing filibusters to be ended by a two-thirds majority vote—a variation of this rule remains in effect.

Marshall&#x27;s vice presidency is most remembered for a leadership crisis following a stroke that incapacitated Wilson in October 1919. Because of their personal dislike for Marshall, Wilson&#x27;s advisers and wife Edith sought to keep him uninformed about the president&#x27;s condition to prevent him from assuming presidential powers and duties. Many people, including cabinet officials and congressional leaders, urged Marshall to become acting president, but he refused to forcibly assume Wilson&#x27;s powers, not wanting to set a standard of doing so. Without strong leadership in the executive branch, the administration&#x27;s opponents defeated the ratification of the League of Nations treaty and returned the United States to an isolationist foreign policy. Marshall ended his time in office as the first vice president since Daniel D. Tompkins, nearly a century earlier, to serve two full terms, and the first vice president re-elected, since John C. Calhoun.

Marshall was known for his wit and sense of humor. One of his most enduring jokes provoked widespread laughter from his Senate colleagues during a floor debate. Responding to Senator Joseph Bristow&#x27;s catalog of the nation&#x27;s needs, Marshall quipped that, &quot;What this country needs is a really good five-cent cigar.&quot; After his terms as vice president, he opened an Indianapolis law practice where he authored several legal books and his memoir, &quot;Recollections&quot;. He continued to travel and speak publicly. In 1925, Marshall died following a heart attack while on a trip to Washington, D.C.

Marshall&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Riley Marshall, immigrated to Indiana in 1817 and settled on a farm in present-day Whitley County. He became wealthy when a moderate deposit of oil and natural gas was discovered on his farm; when he sold the property in 1827 it earned $25,000, $ in 2015 chained dollars. The money allowed him to purchase a modest estate and spend the rest of his life as an active member of the Indiana Democratic Party, serving as an Indiana State Senator, party chairman, and financial contributor. He was also able to send his only child, Daniel, to medical school.

Marshall&#x27;s mother, Martha Patterson, was orphaned at age thirteen while living in Ohio and moved to Indiana to live with her sister on a farm near the Marshalls&#x27; home. Martha was known for her wit and humor, as her son later would be. Martha and Daniel met and married in 1848.

Thomas Riley Marshall was born in North Manchester, Indiana, on March 14, 1854. Two years later, a sister was born, but she died in infancy. Martha had contracted tuberculosis, which Daniel believed to be the cause of their infant daughter&#x27;s poor health. While Marshall was still a young boy, his family moved several times searching a good climate for Daniel to attempt different &quot;outdoor cures&quot; on Martha. They moved first to Quincy, Illinois in 1857. While the family was living in Illinois, Daniel Marshall, a supporter of the American Union and a staunch Democrat, took his four-year-old son, Thomas, to the Lincoln and Douglas debate in Freeport in 1858. Marshall later recalled that during the rally he sat on the laps of Stephen Douglas and Abraham Lincoln, alternating between the two candidates when they were not speaking, and remembered it as one of his earliest and most cherished memories.

The family moved to Osawatomie, Kansas, in 1859, but the frontier violence caused them to move to Missouri in 1860. Eventually, Daniel succeeded in curing Martha&#x27;s disease. As the American Civil War neared, violence spread into Missouri during the Bleeding Kansas incidents. In October 1860 several men led by Duff Green demanded that Daniel Marshall provide medical assistance to the pro-slavery faction, but he refused, and the men left. When the Marshalls&#x27; neighbors warned that Green was planning to return and murder them, the family quickly packed their belongings and escaped by steamboat to Illinois. The Marshalls remained in Illinois only briefly, before relocating to Indiana, which was even farther from the volatile border region.

===Education===
On settling in Pierceton, Indiana, Marshall began to attend public school. His father and grandfather became embroiled in a dispute with their Methodist minister when they refused to vote Republican in the 1862 election. The minister threatened to expel them from the church, to which Marshall&#x27;s grandfather replied that he would &quot;take his risk on hell, but not the Republican Party&quot;. The dispute prompted the family to move again, to Fort Wayne, and convert to the Presbyterian church. In Fort Wayne, Marshall attended high school, graduating in 1869. At age fifteen his parents sent him to Wabash College, in Crawfordsville, where he received a classical education. His father advised him to study medicine or become a minister, but neither interested him; he entered the school without knowing which profession he would take upon graduation.

During college Marshall joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, participated in literary and debating societies, and founded a Democratic Club. He secured a position on the staff of the college newspaper, the &quot;Geyser&quot;, and began writing political columns defending Democratic policies. In 1872 he wrote an unfavorable column about a female lecturer at the school, accusing her of &quot;seeking liberties&quot; with the young boys in their boarding house. She hired lawyer Lew Wallace, the author of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, and filed a suit demanding that Marshall pay her $20,000 for libel. Marshall traveled to Indianapolis to find a defense lawyer and employed future United States President Benjamin Harrison, then a prominent Indianapolis lawyer. Harrison had the suit dropped by showing that the charges made by Marshall were probably true. In Marshall&#x27;s memoir, he wrote that when he approached Harrison to pay his bill, his lawyer informed him that he would not charge him for the service, but instead gave him a lecture on the ethics of making such charges public. Marshall later recalled that he took the advice to heart, and was never again accused of making comments that could be considered libelous.

Marshall was elected to Phi Beta Kappa during his final year at college. He graduated in June 1873, receiving the top grade in fourteen of his thirty-six courses in a class of twenty-one students. Because of his libel case, he had become increasingly interested in law and began seeking someone to teach him. At that time, a common way to become a lawyer was to apprentice under a practicing attorney. Marshall&#x27;s great-uncle Woodson Marshall began to help him, but the younger Marshall soon moved to Columbia City, Indiana, to live with his parents. Marshall read law in the Columbia City law office of Walter Olds, a future member of the Indiana Supreme Court, for more than a year and was admitted to the bar on April 26, 1875.

===Law practice===

Marshall opened a law practice in Columbia City in 1876, taking on many minor cases. After gaining prominence, he accepted William F. McNagny as a partner in 1879 and began taking many criminal defense cases. The two men functioned well as partners. McNagny was better educated in law and worked out their legal arguments. Marshall, the superior orator, argued the cases before the judge and jury. Their firm became well known in the region after they handled a number of high-profile cases. In 1880 Marshall ran for public office for the first time as the Democratic candidate for his district&#x27;s prosecuting attorney. The district was a Republican stronghold, and he was defeated. About the same time, he met and began to court Kate Hooper, and the two became engaged to marry. Kate died of an illness in 1882, one day before they were to be wed. Her death was a major emotional blow to Marshall, leading him to become an alcoholic.

Marshall lived with his parents into his thirties. His father died in the late 1880s and his mother died in 1894, leaving him with the family estate and business. In 1895, while working on a case, Marshall met Lois Kimsey who was working as a clerk in her father&#x27;s law firm. Despite their nineteen-year age difference, the couple fell in love and married on October 2. The Marshalls had a close marriage and were nearly inseparable, and spent only two nights apart during their nearly thirty-year marriage.

Marshall&#x27;s alcoholism had begun to interfere with his busy life before his marriage. He arrived at court hung-over on several occasions and was unable to keep his addiction secret in his small hometown. His wife helped him to overcome his drinking problem and give up liquor after she locked him in their home for two weeks to undergo a treatment regimen. Thereafter, he became active in temperance organizations and delivered several speeches about the dangers of liquor. Although he had stopped drinking, his past alcoholism was later raised by opponents during his gubernatorial election campaign.

Marshall remained active in the Democratic party after his 1880 defeat and began stumping for other candidates and helping to organize party rallies across the state. His speeches were noted for their partisanship, but his rhetoric gradually shifted away from a conservative viewpoint in the 1890s as he began to identify himself with the growing progressive movement. He became a member of the state Democratic Central Committee in 1904, a position that raised his popularity and influence in the party.

Marshall and his wife were involved in several private organizations. He was active in the Presbyterian Church, taught Sunday school, and served on the county fair board. As he grew wealthy from his law firm he became involved in local charities. An enthusiastic Mason in Columbia City Lodge No. 189 in the Grand Lodge of Indiana, he was a governing member of the state&#x27;s York Rite bodies, awarded the thirty-third degree of the Scottish Rite in 1898, and became an Active member of the Supreme Council, Scottish Rite, Northern Jurisdiction in 1911. He remained a passionate Freemason until his death and served on several Masonic charitable boards. After his death, the $25,000 cost of erecting his mausoleum in Indianapolis&#x27; Crown Hill Cemetery was gratefully paid for by the Scottish Rite NMJ Supreme Council.

==Governorship (1909–1913)==

===Campaign===

In 1906, Marshall declined his party&#x27;s nomination to run for Congress. He hinted, however, to state party leaders that he would be interested in running for Indiana governor in the 1908 election. He soon gained the support of several key labor unions, and was endorsed by Louis Ludlow, a reporter for the &quot;Indianapolis Star&quot;. Despite this support, Marshall was a dark horse candidate at the state convention. Initially, Thomas Taggart, Indiana Democratic Party boss, did not support him because of Marshall&#x27;s support of prohibition. Taggart wanted the party to nominate anti-prohibitionist Samuel Ralston, but the prohibitionist and anti-Taggart factions united with Marshall&#x27;s supporters. To oppose L. Ert Slack, a temperance candidate, Taggart persuaded Ralston&#x27;s delegates to support Marshall and give him the votes he needed to win the nomination.

Marshall&#x27;s opponent in the general election was Republican Congressman James E. Watson, and the campaign focused on temperance and prohibition. Just as it began, the Republican-controlled state government passed a local-option law that allowed counties to ban the sale of liquor. The law became the central point of debate between the parties and their gubernatorial candidates. The Democrats proposed that the local-option law be changed so that the decision to ban liquor sales could be made at the city and township level. This drew support from anti-prohibitionists, who saw it as an opportunity to roll back prohibition in some areas, and as the only alternative available to the total prohibition which the Republican Party advocated. The Democratic position also helped to retain prohibitionists&#x27; support by allowing prohibition to remain enacted in communities where a majority supported it. The Republican Party was in the midst of a period of instability, splitting along progressive and conservative lines. Their internal problems proved to be the deciding factor in the election, giving Marshall a narrow victory: he received 48.1 percent of the vote to Watson&#x27;s 48.0 percent. Democrats also came to power in the Indiana House of Representatives by a small margin, though Republicans retained control of the Indiana Senate.

===Progressive agenda===
Marshall was inaugurated as Governor of Indiana on January 11, 1909. Since his party had been out of power for many years, its initial objective was to appoint as many Democrats as possible to patronage positions. Marshall tried to avoid becoming directly involved in the patronage system. He allowed the party&#x27;s different factions to have positions and appointed very few of his own choices. He allowed Taggart to manage the process and pick the candidates, but signed off on the official appointments. Although his position on patronage kept peace in his party, it prevented him from building a strong political base.

During his term, Marshall focused primarily on advancing the progressive agenda. He successfully advocated the passage of a child labor law and anti-corruption legislation. He supported popular election of U.S. Senators, and the constitutional amendment to allow it was ratified by the Indiana General Assembly during his term. He also overhauled the state auditing agencies and claimed to have saved the government millions of dollars. Various measures aimed at improving working conditions were also approved, together with a bill that sought to improve tenement housing conditions in Indiana&#x27;s two largest cities. He was unsuccessful in passing the rest of the progressive platform agenda items or persuading the legislature to call a convention to rewrite the state constitution to expand the government&#x27;s regulatory powers.

Marshall was a strong opponent of Indiana&#x27;s recently passed eugenics and sterilization laws, and ordered state institutions not to follow them. He was an early, high-profile opponent of eugenics laws, and he carried his opposition into the vice-presidency. His governorship was the first in which no state executions took place, due to his opposition to capital punishment and his practice of pardoning and commuting the sentences of people condemned to execution. He regularly attacked corporations and used recently created antitrust laws to attempt to break several large businesses. He participated in a number of ceremonial events, including laying the final golden brick to complete the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1909.

Democratic Party campaign literature emphasized Marshall&#x27;s record as governor, with one Democratic textbook from 1912 listing various laws enacted during his time in office by his instance. These included acts to investigate industrial and agricultural education; to permit night schools In cities; to prevent traffic in white slaves; to establish uniform weights and measures; to provide police court matrons; to protect against loan sharks; to strengthen the pure food act; to establish public play grounds; to provide free treatment for hydrophobia; to regulate the sale of cocaine and other drugs; to prevent blindness at birth; to require hygienic schoolhouses to permit medical examination of school children; to regulate the sale of cold storage products; to curtail child labor; and to “require medical supplies as part of a train equipment, etc.” The textbook also listed various laws “intended to protect the toilers” that were also championed by Marshall. These included laws to require storm windows for locomotives; to require full switching crews; to require standard cabooses; to require inspection of locomotive boilers; to provide efficient headlights on locomotives; to require safety devices on switch engines; to require full train crews; to establish free employment agencies; to create a bureau of inspection for factories, workshops, mines and boilers; and to “provide a weekly wage; etc.”

===Marshall&#x27;s constitution===

Rewriting the state constitution became Marshall&#x27;s central focus as governor, and after the General Assembly refused to call a constitutional convention he sought other ways to have a new constitution adopted. He and Jacob Piatt Dunn, a close friend and civic leader, wrote a new constitution that increased the state&#x27;s regulatory powers considerably, set minimum wages, and gave constitutional protections to unions. Many of these reforms were also in the Socialist Party platform under its leader, Terre Haute native Eugene V. Debs. Republicans believed Marshall&#x27;s constitution was an attempt to win over Debs&#x27; supporters, who had a strong presence in Indiana. The constitution also allowed direct-democracy initiatives and referendums to be held. The Democratic controlled assembly agreed to the request and put the measure on the ballot. His opponents attacked the direct-democracy provisions, claiming they were a violation of the United States Constitution, which required states to operate republican forms of government. The 1910 midterm elections gave the Democrats control of the Indiana Senate, increasing the constitution&#x27;s chances of adoption. Marshall presented it to the General Assembly in 1911 and recommended that they submit it to voters in the 1912 election.

Republicans opposed the ratification process, and were infuriated that the Democrats were attempting to revise the entire constitution without calling a constitutional convention, as had been called for in the state&#x27;s two previous constitutions. Marshall argued that no convention was needed because the existing constitution did not call for one. Republicans took the issue to court and the Marion County Circuit Court granted an injunction removing the constitution from the 1912 ballot. Marshall appealed, but the Indiana Supreme Court upheld the decision in a judgment which stated that the Constitution of Indiana could not be replaced in total without a constitutional convention, based on the precedent set by Indiana&#x27;s first two constitutions. Marshall was angry with the decision and delivered a speech attacking the court and accusing it of overstepping its authority. He launched a final appeal to the United States Supreme Court but left office in January 1913 while the case was still pending. Later that year, the court declined the appeal, finding that the issue was within the sole jurisdiction of the state courts. Marshall was disappointed with the outcome. Subsequent scholars such as Linda Gugin and legal expert James St. Claire have called the process and the document &quot;seriously flawed&quot; and argued that had the constitution been adopted, large parts would probably have been ruled unconstitutional by the federal courts.

==Vice presidency (1913–1921)==
===Election===
The Indiana constitution prevented Marshall from serving a consecutive term as governor. He made plans to run for a United States Senate seat after his term ended, but another opportunity presented itself during his last months as governor. Although he did not attend the 1912 Democratic National Convention in Baltimore, his name was put forward as Indiana&#x27;s choice for president. He was suggested as a compromise nominee, but William Jennings Bryan and his delegates endorsed Woodrow Wilson over Champ Clark, securing the nomination for Wilson. Indiana&#x27;s delegates lobbied to have Marshall named the vice presidential candidate in exchange for supporting Wilson. Indiana was an important swing state, and Wilson hoped that Marshall&#x27;s popularity would help him carry it in the general election. He had his delegates support Marshall, giving him the vice presidential nomination. Marshall privately turned down the nomination, assuming the job would be boring given its limited role. He changed his mind after Wilson assured him that he would be given plenty of responsibilities. During the campaign, Marshall traveled across the United States delivering speeches. The Wilson–Marshall ticket easily won the 1912 election because of the division between the Republican Party and the Progressive Party.

Marshall was not fond of Wilson, as he disagreed with him on a number of issues. Although Wilson invited Marshall to cabinet meetings, Marshall&#x27;s ideas were rarely considered for implementation, and Marshall eventually stopped attending them regularly. In 1913, Wilson broke with longstanding tradition and met with senators to discuss policy. Previous presidents had used the vice president as an intermediary, but Wilson did not trust Marshall with delicate business. In his memoir, Marshall&#x27;s only negative comment towards Wilson was, &quot;I have sometimes thought that great men are the bane of civilization, they are the real cause of all the bitterness and contention which amounts to anything in the world&quot;. Their relationship was described as one of &quot;functioning animosity&quot;.

===Senate developments===

Marshall was not offended by Wilson&#x27;s lack of interest in his ideas, and considered his primary constitutional duty to be in the Senate. He viewed the vice presidency as a legislative role, not an executive one. When he presided over the Senate, emotions sometimes ran high. During a debate on the Mexican border crisis in 1916, Marshall threatened to expel certain senators from the chamber for their raucous behavior, but did not carry through on the threat. On several occasions, he ordered the Senate gallery cleared. He voted eight times to break tie votes.

In the debates leading up to World War I, a number of isolationist senators filibustered bills that Wilson considered important. The filibusters lasted for weeks and twice lasted for over three months. Wilson and the bills&#x27; supporters requested that Marshall put a gag-order in place to cut off debate, but he refused on ethical grounds, allowing a number of bills to be defeated in hopes that opposition would eventually end their filibuster. Among the defeated bills was one allowing merchant ships to arm themselves, and another allowing the US government to make direct arms sales to the Allies. Despite their victories, the small group of senators continued to lock up the Senate to prevent any pro-war legislation from passing. In response, Marshall led the Senate to adopt a new rule on March 8, 1917, allowing filibusters to be broken by two-thirds of voting Senators. This replaced the previous rule that allowed any senator to prolong debate as long as he desired. The rule has been modified several times, most prominently that the current rule requires three-fifths of &quot;all&quot; Senators, not only the ones voting.

As Marshall made little news and was viewed as a somewhat comic figure in Washington because of his sense of humor, a number of Democratic party leaders wanted him removed from the 1916 reelection ticket. Wilson, after deliberating, decided keeping Marshall on would demonstrate party unity; thus in 1916 Wilson won reelection over the still divided Republican Party. Marshall became the first vice president re-elected since John C. Calhoun in 1828. Wilson and Marshall were the first president and vice president team to be re-elected since Monroe and Tompkins in 1820.

===Assassination attempt===
On the evening of July 2, 1915, Eric Muenter, a one time German professor at Harvard and Cornell universities, who opposed American support of the Allied war effort, broke into the U.S. Senate and, finding the door to the Senate chamber locked, laid dynamite outside the reception room, which happened to be next to Marshall&#x27;s office door. Although the bomb was set with a timer, it exploded prematurely just before midnight, while no one was in the office. 

On July 3, Muenter (who went under the pseudonym Frank Holt) burst into the Glen Cove, New York home of Jack Morgan, son of financier J. P. Morgan, demanding that he stop the sale of weapons to the Allies. Morgan told the man he was in no position to comply with his demand; Muenter shot him twice non-fatally and escaped. Muenter was later apprehended and confessed to attempted assassination of the vice president. Marshall was offered a personal security detachment after the incident, but declined it. Marshall had been receiving written death threats from numerous &quot;cranks&quot; for several weeks. &quot;Some of them were signed,&quot; Marshall told the press, &quot;but most were anonymous. I threw them all into the waste basket.&quot; Marshall added that he was &quot;more or less a fatalist&quot; and did not notify the Secret Service about the letters, &quot;but that he naturally was startled when he heard of the explosion at the Capitol.&quot;

===World War I===

During Marshall&#x27;s second term, the United States entered World War I. Marshall was a reluctant supporter of the war, believing the country to be unprepared and feared it would be necessary to enact conscription. He was pleased with Wilson&#x27;s strategy to begin a military buildup before the declaration of war, and fully supported the war effort once it had begun. Shortly after the first troops began to assemble for transport to Europe, Wilson and Marshall hosted a delegation from the United Kingdom in which Marshall became privy to the primary war strategy. However, he was largely excluded from war planning and rarely received official updates on the progress of military campaigns. He usually received news of the war through the newspapers.

Wilson sent Marshall around the nation to deliver morale-boosting speeches and encourage Americans to buy Liberty Bonds to support the war effort. Marshall was well suited for the job, as he had been earning extra money as a public speaker while vice president, and gladly accepted the responsibility. In his speeches, he cast the war as a &quot;moral crusade to preserve the dignity of the state for the rights of individuals&quot;. In his memoir, he recalled that the war seemed to drag on &quot;with leaden feet&quot;, and that he was relieved when it finally ended. As the war neared its end, Marshall became the first vice president to conduct cabinet meetings; Wilson left him with this responsibility while traveling in Europe to sign the Versailles treaty and to work on gathering support for his League of Nations idea. Wilson became the first president to deliver a treaty to the Senate in person when he presented it to Marshall during a morning session.

===Morrison===

Marshall&#x27;s wife, Lois, was heavily involved in charitable activities in Washington and spent considerable time working at the Diet Kitchen Welfare Center providing free meals to impoverished children. In 1917 she became acquainted with a mother of newborn twins, one of whom was chronically ill. The child&#x27;s parents were unable to get adequate treatment for their son&#x27;s condition. Lois formed a close bond with the baby, named Clarence Ignatius Morrison, and offered to take him and help him find treatment. She and Marshall were unable to have children, and when she brought the baby home, Marshall told her that she could &quot;keep him, provided he did not squall&quot;. Marshall grew to love the boy and wrote that he &quot;never walked the streets of Washington with as sure a certainty as he walked into my heart&quot;, and, as the boy grew older, that he was &quot;beautiful as an angel; brilliant beyond his years; lovable from every standpoint&quot;.

The Marshalls never officially adopted Morrison because they believed that to go through the procedure while his parents were still living would appear unusual to the public. Wanting to keep the situation private, they instead made a special arrangement with his parents. President Wilson felt obliged to acknowledge the boy as theirs and sent the couple a note that simply said, &quot;With congratulations to the baby. Wilson&quot;. Morrison lived with the Marshalls for the rest of his life. In correspondence they referred to him as Morrison Marshall, but in person they called him Izzy. Lois took him to see many doctors and spent all her available time trying to nurse him back to health, but his condition worsened and he died in February 1920, just before his fourth birthday. His death devastated Marshall, who wrote in his memoir that Izzy &quot;was and is and ever will be so sacred to me&quot;.

===Succession crisis===

President Wilson experienced a mild stroke in September 1919. On October 2, he was struck by a much more severe stroke that left him partially paralyzed and almost certainly incapacitated. Wilson&#x27;s closest adviser, Joseph Tumulty, did not believe Marshall would be a suitable acting president and took precautions to prevent him from assuming presidential powers and duties. Wilson&#x27;s wife Edith strongly disliked Marshall because of what she called his &quot;uncouthed&quot; disposition, and also opposed his assumption of presidential powers and duties. Tumulty and the First Lady believed that an official communication from Wilson&#x27;s staff on his condition would allow Marshall to trigger the constitutional mechanism allowing him to become acting president, and made sure no such communication occurred. After Marshall demanded to know Wilson&#x27;s status so that he could prepare for the possibility of becoming president, they had a reporter from &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; brief Marshall and inform him that Wilson was near death. Marshall later said that &quot;it was the first great shock of my life&quot;, but without an official communication on Wilson&#x27;s condition, he didn&#x27;t believe he could constitutionally assume presidential powers and duties.

On October 5, Secretary of State Robert Lansing was the first official to propose that Marshall forcibly assume presidential powers and duties. Other cabinet secretaries backed Lansing&#x27;s request. Congressional leaders of both parties also sent private communications to Marshall, who was cautious in accepting their support. After consulting with his wife and his long-time personal adviser, Mark Thistlethwaite, he privately refused to assume Wilson&#x27;s duties and become acting president. The process for declaring a president incapacitated was unclear at that time, and he feared the precedent that might be set if he forcibly removed Wilson from his powers and duties. Marshall wanted the president to voluntarily allow his powers to devolve to the vice president, but that was impossible given his condition and unlikely given Wilson&#x27;s dislike for Marshall. The vice president informed the cabinet that he would assume Wilson&#x27;s powers and duties only in response to a joint resolution of Congress calling on him to do so or an official communication from Wilson or his staff asserting his inability to perform his duties.

Wilson was kept secluded by his wife and personal physician and only his close advisers were allowed to see him; none would divulge official information on his condition. Although Marshall sought to meet with Wilson to determine his condition, he was unable to do so. He instead relied on vague updates received through bulletins published by Wilson&#x27;s physician. Believing that Wilson and his advisers would not voluntarily transfer power to the vice president, a group of congressional leaders initiated Marshall&#x27;s requested joint resolution. However, senators opposed to the League of Nations treaty blocked the joint resolution in hopes of preventing the treaty&#x27;s ratification. These senators believed that as acting president Marshall would make several key concessions that would allow the treaty to win ratification. Wilson, in his present condition, was either unwilling or unable to make the concessions, and debate on the bill had resulted in a deadlock.

On December 4, Lansing announced in a Senate committee hearing that no one in the cabinet had spoken with or seen Wilson in over sixty days. The senators seeking to elevate Marshall requested that a committee be sent to check on Wilson&#x27;s condition, hoping to gain evidence to support their cause. Dubbed the &quot;smelling committee&quot; by several newspapers, the group discovered Wilson was in very poor health, but seemed to have recovered enough of his faculties to make decisions. Their report ended the perceived need for the joint resolution.

At a Sunday church service in mid-December, in what Marshall believed was an attempt by other officials to force him to assume the presidency, a courier brought a message informing him that Wilson had died. Marshall was shocked, and rose to announce the news to the congregation. The ministers held a prayer, the congregation began singing hymns, and many people wept. Marshall and his wife exited the building, and made a call to the White House to determine his next course of action, only to find that he had been the victim of a hoax, and that Wilson was still alive.

Marshall performed a few ceremonial functions for the remainder of Wilson&#x27;s term, such as hosting foreign dignitaries. Among these was Albert I, King of the Belgians, the first European monarch to visit the United States. Edward, Prince of Wales, the future monarch of the United Kingdom, spent two days with Marshall and received a personal tour of Washington from him. First Lady Edith Wilson performed most routine duties of government. She reviewed Wilson&#x27;s communications and decided what to share with him and what to delegate to others. The resulting lack of leadership allowed the administration&#x27;s opponents to prevent ratification of the League of Nations treaty. They attacked the treaty&#x27;s tenth article, which they believed would allow the United States to be bound in an alliance to European countries that could force the country to return to war without an act of Congress. Marshall personally supported the treaty&#x27;s adoption, but recommended several changes, including the requirement that all parties to it acknowledge the Monroe Doctrine and the United States&#x27; sphere of influence, and that the tenth article be made non-binding.

Wilson began to recover by the end of 1919, but remained secluded for the remainder of his term, steadfast in his refusal or inability to accept changes to the treaty. Marshall was prevented from meeting with him to ascertain his true condition until his final day in office. It remains unclear who made executive decisions during Wilson&#x27;s incapacity, but it was likely the first lady with the help of the presidential advisers.

==Post-vice presidency (1921–1925)==

Marshall had his name entered as a candidate for the presidential nomination at the 1920 Democratic National Convention. He made arrangements with Thomas Taggart to have a delegation sent from Indiana to support his bid, but was unable to garner support outside of the Hoosier delegation. Ultimately he endorsed the Democratic nominees, James M. Cox for president and Franklin D. Roosevelt for vice president, but they were defeated by the Republican ticket of Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge. On their election, Marshall sent a note to Coolidge offering him his &quot;sincere condolences&quot; for his misfortune of having been elected vice president. During his retirement, Marshall gravitated towards conservatism; declaring his opposition to various progressive measures such as the fixing of minimum wages.

Marshall considered returning to Columbia City after leaving office, but instead bought a home and opened a law practice in Indianapolis, where he believed there would be better business opportunities. Harding nominated him to serve on the Lincoln Memorial Commission in 1921, and then to a more lucrative position on the Federal Coal Commission in 1922; Marshall resigned from both commissions in 1923. He spent over a year writing books on the law and his &quot;Recollections&quot;, a humorous memoir. The latter book was completed in May 1925 and subsequent historians have noted it as unusual, even for its time, for not disclosing any secrets or attacking any of Marshall&#x27;s enemies. Marshall remained a popular public speaker, and continued to travel to give speeches. The last he delivered was to high school students in the town of his birth.

=== Death ===

On June 1, 1925, Marshall and his wife were on a trip to Washington, D.C., when he died suddenly from a heart attack at his room at the Willard Hotel, while reading his Bible in bed. He had been unwell for several days, and a nurse had accompanied them on the trip, but Marshall had already died by the time his wife could summon help. He was 71. 

A service and viewing was held in Washington two days later and was attended by many dignitaries. Marshall&#x27;s remains were returned to Indianapolis, where he lay in state for two days; thousands visited his bier. His funeral service was held June 9, and he was interred in Crown Hill Cemetery, next to the grave of his &quot;adopted&quot; son Morrison &quot;Izzy&quot; Marshall. Lois Marshall moved to Arizona and remained widowed the rest of her life, living on her husband&#x27;s pension and the $50,000 she earned by selling his memoir to the Bobbs-Merrill publishing company. She died in 1958 and was interred next to her husband.

==Humor==

Marshall was known for his quick wit and good sense of humor. On hearing of his nomination as vice president, he announced that he was not surprised, as &quot;Indiana is the mother of Vice Presidents; home of more second-class men than any other state&quot;. One of his favorite jokes, which he delivered in a speech before his departure for Washington, D.C., to become vice president, recounted a story of a man with two sons. One of the sons went to sea and drowned and the other was elected vice president; neither son was ever heard from again. On his election as vice president, he sent Woodrow Wilson a book, inscribed &quot;From your only Vice.&quot;

Marshall&#x27;s humor caused him trouble during his time in Washington. He was known to greet citizens walking by his office on the White House tour by saying to them, &quot;If you look on me as a wild animal, be kind enough to throw peanuts at me.&quot; This prompted Wilson to move Marshall&#x27;s office to the Senate Office building, where the Vice President would not be disturbed by visitors. In response to Alexander Graham Bell&#x27;s proposal to the board of the Smithsonian Institution to send a team to excavate for ruins in Guatemala, Marshall suggested that the team instead excavate around Washington. When asked why, he replied that, judging by the looks of the people walking on the street, they should be able to find buried cave-men no more than six feet down. The joke was not well received, and he was shut out of board meetings for nearly a year.

Marshall&#x27;s wit is best remembered for a phrase he introduced to the American lexicon. While presiding over a Senate session in 1914, Marshall responded to earlier comments from Senator Joseph L. Bristow that provided a long list of what he felt the country needed. Marshall reportedly leaned over and muttered to one of his clerks, &quot;What this country needs is more of this; what this country needs is more of that&quot; and quipped loudly enough for others to overhear, &quot;What this country needs is a really good five-cent cigar.&quot; Marshall&#x27;s remark was popularized and widely circulated among a network of newspapers. Other accounts later embellished the story, including the exact situation that prompted his comment. In 1922 Marshall explained that the five-cent cigar was a metaphor for simpler times and &quot;buckling down to thrift and work&quot;.

==Legacy==

The situation that arose after the incapacity of Wilson, for which Marshall&#x27;s vice-presidency is most remembered, revived the national debate on the process of presidential succession. The topic was already being discussed when Wilson left for Europe, which influenced him to allow Marshall to conduct cabinet meetings in his absence. Wilson&#x27;s incapacity during 1919 and the lack of action by Marshall made it a major issue. The lack of a clear process for presidential succession had first become an issue when President William Henry Harrison died in office in 1841, but little progress had been made passing a constitutional amendment to remedy the problem. Nearly fifty years later, after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed, allowing the vice president to assume the presidential powers and duties any time the president was rendered incapable of carrying out the powers and duties of the office.

Historians have varied interpretations of Marshall&#x27;s vice presidency. Claire Suddath rated Marshall as one of the worst vice presidents in American history in a 2008 &quot;Time&quot; magazine article. Samuel Eliot Morison wrote that had Marshall carried out his constitutional duties, assumed the presidential powers and duties, and made the concessions necessary for the passage of the League of Nations treaty in late 1920, the United States would have been much more involved in European affairs and could have helped prevent the rise of Adolf Hitler, which began in the following year. Morison and a number of other historians claim that Marshall&#x27;s decision was an indirect cause of the Second World War. Charles Thomas, one of Marshall&#x27;s biographers, wrote that although Marshall&#x27;s assumption of presidential powers and duties would have made World War II much less likely, modern hypothetical speculation on the subject was unfair to Marshall, who made the correct decision in not forcibly removing Wilson from his duties, even temporarily.

<doc id="31364" wikidata="Q1233377" url="?curid=31364" title="Physiologus">
<text>The Physiologus () is a didactic Christian text written or compiled in Greek by an unknown author in Alexandria. Its composition has been traditionally dated to the 2nd century AD by readers who saw parallels with writings of Clement of Alexandria, who is asserted to have known the text, though Alan Scott has made a case for a date at the end of the 3rd or in the 4th century. The &quot;Physiologus&quot; consists of descriptions of animals, birds, and fantastic creatures, sometimes stones and plants, provided with moral content. Each animal is described, and an anecdote follows, from which the moral and symbolic qualities of the animal are derived. Manuscripts are often, but not always, given illustrations, often lavish.

The book was translated into Armenian in 5th century, into Latin by the early 6th century or possibly even by the mid-4th century and into Ethiopic and Syriac, then into many European and Middle-Eastern languages, and many illuminated manuscript copies such as the Bern Physiologus survive. It retained its influence over ideas of the &quot;meaning&quot; of animals in Europe for over a thousand years. It was a predecessor of bestiaries (books of beasts). Medieval poetical literature is full of allusions that can be traced to the &quot;Physiologus&quot; tradition; the text also exerted great influence on the symbolism of medieval ecclesiastical art: symbols like those of the phoenix rising from its ashes and the pelican feeding her young with her own blood are still well-known.

==Allegorical stories==
The story is told of the lion whose cubs are born dead and receive life when the old lion breathes upon them, and of the phoenix which burns itself to death and rises on the third day from the ashes; both are taken as types of Christ. The unicorn also which only permits itself to be captured in the lap of a pure virgin is a type of the Incarnation; the pelican that sheds its own blood in order to sprinkle its dead young, so that they may live again, is a type of the salvation of mankind by the death of Christ on the Cross. This motif is known as the Pelican in her Piety.

Some allegories set forth the deceptive enticements of the Devil and his defeat by Christ; others present qualities as examples to be imitated or avoided.

==Attributions==
The conventional title &quot;Physiologus&quot; was because the author introduces his stories from natural history with the phrase: &quot;the physiologus says&quot;, that is, &quot;the naturalist says&quot;, &quot;the natural philosophers, the authorities for natural history say&quot;, a term derived from Greek φύσις (&quot;physis&quot;, &quot;nature&quot;) and λόγος (&quot;logos&quot;, “word”).

In later centuries it was ascribed to various celebrated Fathers, especially Epiphanius, Basil of Caesarea, and St. Peter of Alexandria. 

The assertion that the method of the &quot;Physiologus&quot; presupposes the allegorical exegesis developed by Origen is not correct; the so-called &quot;Letter of Barnabas&quot; offers, before Origen, a sufficient model, not only for the general character of the &quot;Physiologus&quot; but also for many of its details. It can hardly be asserted that the later recensions, in which the Greek text has been preserved, present even in the best and oldest manuscripts a perfectly reliable transcription of the original, especially as this was an anonymous and popular treatise.

==Early history==
About the year 400 the &quot;Physiologus&quot; was translated into Latin; from Greek, the original language that it was written in. In the 5th century into Ethiopic [edited by Fritz Hommel with a German translation (Leipzig, 1877), revised German translation in &quot;Romanische Forschungen&quot;, V, 13-36]; into Armenian [edited by Pitra in &quot;Spicilegium Solesmense&quot;, III, 374–90; French translation by Cahier in &quot;Nouveaux Mélanges d&#x27;archéologie, d&#x27;histoire et de littérature&quot; (Paris, 1874)] (see also the recent edition: Gohar Muradyan, Physiologus. The Greek And Armenian Versions With a Study of Translation Technique, Leuven–Dudley MA: Peeters, 2005 [Hebrew University Armenian Studies 6]); into Syriac [edited by Tychsen, &quot;Physiologus Syrus&quot; (Rostock, 1795), a later Syriac and an Arabic version edited by Land in &quot;Anecdota Syriaca&quot;, IV (Leyden, 1875)]. An Old Slavic (Old Bulgarian) translation was made in the 10th century [edited by Karneyev, , Sankt Peterburg, 1890].

Epiphanius used &quot;Physiologus&quot; in his &quot;Panarion&quot; and from his time numerous further quotations and references to the &quot;Physiologus&quot; in the Greek and the Latin Church fathers show that it was one of the most generally known works of Christian Late Antiquity. Various translations and revisions were current in the Middle Ages. The earliest translation into Latin was followed by various recensions, among them the &quot;Sayings of St. John Chrysostom on the natures of beasts&quot;, A metrical Latin &quot;Physiologus&quot; was written in the 11th century by a certain Theobaldus, and printed by Morris in &quot;An Old English Miscellany&quot; (1872), 201 sqq.; it also appears among the works of Hildebertus Cenomanensis in &quot;Pat.Lat.&quot;, CLXXI, 1217–24. To these should be added the literature of the bestiaries, in which the material of the &quot;Physiologus&quot; was used; the &quot;Tractatus de bestiis et alius rebus&quot;, often misattributed to Hugo of St. Victor, and the &quot;Speculum naturale&quot; of Vincent of Beauvais.

==Translations==
The &quot;Physiologus&quot; had an impact on neighboring literatures: medieval translations into Latin, Armenian, Georgian, Slavic, Syriac, Coptic, and Ethiopic are known.

Translations and adaptations from the Latin introduced the &quot;Physiologus&quot; into almost all the languages of Western Europe. An Old High German (Alemannic) translation was written in Hirsau in c. 1070 (ed. Müllenhoff and Scherer in &quot;Denkmäler deutscher Poesie und Prosa&quot; No. LXXXI); a later translation (12th century) has been edited by in &quot;Geschichte des Physiologus&quot; (pp. 280–99); and a rhymed version appears in Karajan, &quot;Deutsche Sprachdenkmale des XII. Jahrhunderts&quot; (pp. 73–106), both based on the Latin text known as &quot;Dicta Chrysostomi.&quot; Fragments of a 9th-century metrical Anglo-Saxon &quot;Physiologus&quot; are extant (ed. Thorpe in &quot;Codex Exoniensis&quot; pp. 335–67, Grein in &quot;Bibliothek der angelsächsischen Poesie&quot; I, 223-8).

About the middle of the 13th century there appeared a Middle English metrical &quot;Bestiary&quot;, an adaptation of the Latin &quot;Physiologus Theobaldi&quot;; this has been edited by Wright and Halliwell in &quot;Reliquiæ antiquæ&quot; (I, 208-27), also by Morris in &quot;An Old English Miscellany&quot; (1-25). There is an &quot;Icelandic&quot; &quot;Physiologus&quot; preserved in two fragmentary redactions from around 1200.

In the 12th and 13th centuries there appeared the &quot;Bestiaires&quot; of Philippe de Thaun, a metrical Old French version, edited by Thomas Wright in &quot;Popular Treatises on Science Written during the Middle Ages&quot; (74-131), and by Walberg (Lund and Paris, 1900); that by Guillaume, clerk of Normandy, called &quot;Bestiare divin&quot;, and edited by Cahier in his &quot;Mélanges d&#x27;archéologie&quot; (II-IV), also edited by Hippeau (Caen, 1852), and by Reinsch (Leipzig, 1890); the &quot;&quot;, edited by Paul Meyer in &quot;Romania&quot; (I, 420-42); the &quot;Bestiare&quot; in prose of Pierre le Picard, edited by Cahier in &quot;Mélanges&quot; (II-IV).

An adaptation is found in the old Waldensian literature, and has been edited by Alfons Mayer in &quot;Romanische Forschungen&quot; (V, 392 sqq.). As to the Italian bestiaries, a Tuscan-Venetian &quot;Bestiarius&quot; has been edited (Goldstaub and Wendriner, &quot;Ein tosco-venezianischer Bestiarius&quot;, Halle, 1892). Extracts from the &quot;Physiologus&quot; in Provençal have been edited by Bartsch, &quot;Provenzalisches Lesebuch&quot; (162-66). The &quot;Physiologus&quot; survived in the literatures of Eastern Europe in books on animals written in Middle Greek, among the Slavs to whom it came from the Byzantine (translations of the so-called Byzantinian redaction were made in Middle Bulgarian in the 13th-14th century; they were edited in 2011 by Ana Stoykova in an electronic edition, see reference), and in a Romanian translation from a Slavic original (edited by Moses Gaster with an Italian translation in &quot;Archivio glottologico italiano&quot;, X, 273-304).

==The manuscript tradition==
Modern study of &quot;Physiologus&quot; can be said to have begun with Francesco Sbordone&#x27;s edition, 1936, which established three traditions in the surviving manuscripts of the text, a &quot;primitive&quot; tradition, a Byzantine one and a pseudo-Basil tradition. Ben Perry showed that a manuscript Sbordone had missed, at the Morgan Library, was the oldest extant Greek version, a late 10th-century manuscript from Grottaferrata. Anna Dorofeeva has argued that the numerous early Latin Physiologus manuscripts can be seen as evidence for an &#x27;encyclopedic drive&#x27; amongst early medieval monastic writing centres.

<text>The New Yorker is an American magazine featuring journalism, commentary, criticism, essays, fiction, satire, cartoons, and poetry. It was founded on February 21, 1925, by Harold Ross and his wife Jane Grant, a reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Together with entrepreneur Raoul H. Fleischmann, they established the F-R Publishing Company and set up the magazine&#x27;s first office in Manhattan. Ross remained the editor until his death in 1951, shaping the magazine&#x27;s editorial tone and standards. According to media scholar, Sarah Cain, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s fact checking operation is legendary, intensive, and, deservedly, perhaps the most respected in publishing.

Although its reviews and events listings often focused on the cultural life of New York City, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; gained a reputation for publishing serious essays, and long form journalism, well regarded fiction, and humor for a national and international audience, including featuring works by notable authors such as Truman Capote, Vladimir Nabokov, and Alice Munro. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; adapted to the digital era, maintaining its traditional print operations while expanding its online presence, including making its archives available on the Internet and introducing a digital version of the magazine. David Remnick has been the editor of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; since 1998. Starting in 2004, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; has published endorsements in U.S. presidential elections.

&quot;The New Yorker&quot; is published 47 times annually, with five of these issues covering two-week spans. It is well known for its illustrated and often topical covers, such as &quot;View of the World from 9th Avenue&quot;, its commentaries on popular culture and eccentric American culture, its attention to modern fiction by the inclusion of short stories and literary reviews, its rigorous fact checking and copy editing, its investigative journalism and reporting on politics and social issues, and its single-panel cartoons reproduced throughout each issue. According to a 2012 Pew Research Center study, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, along with &quot;The Atlantic&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, ranked highest in college-educated readership among major American media outlets. It has won eight Pulitzer Prizes since 2014, the first year magazines became eligible for the prize.

== Overview and history ==

&quot;The New Yorker&quot; was founded by Harold Ross (1892–1951) and his wife Jane Grant (1892–1972), a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter, and debuted on February 21, 1925. Ross wanted to create a sophisticated humor magazine that would be different from perceivably &quot;corny&quot; humor publications such as &quot;Judge&quot;, where he had worked, or the old &quot;Life&quot;. Ross partnered with entrepreneur Raoul H. Fleischmann (who founded the General Baking Company) to establish the F-R Publishing Company. The magazine&#x27;s first offices were at 25 West 45th Street in Manhattan. Ross edited the magazine until his death in 1951. During the early, occasionally precarious years of its existence, the magazine prided itself on its cosmopolitan sophistication. Ross declared in a 1925 prospectus for the magazine: &quot;It has announced that it is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque&quot;.

Although the magazine never lost its touches of humor, it soon established itself as a preeminent forum for serious fiction, essays and journalism. Shortly after the end of World War II, John Hersey&#x27;s essay &quot;Hiroshima&quot; filled an entire issue. The magazine has published short stories by many of the most respected writers of the 20th and 21st centuries, including Ann Beattie, Sally Benson, Maeve Brennan, Truman Capote, Rachel Carson, John Cheever, Roald Dahl, Mavis Gallant, Geoffrey Hellman, Ernest Hemingway, Stephen King, Ruth McKenney, John McNulty, Joseph Mitchell, Lorrie Moore, Alice Munro, Haruki Murakami, Vladimir Nabokov, John O&#x27;Hara, Dorothy Parker, S.J. Perelman, Philip Roth, George Saunders, J. D. Salinger, Irwin Shaw, James Thurber, John Updike, Eudora Welty, and E. B. White. Publication of Shirley Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lottery&quot; drew more mail than any other story in the magazine&#x27;s history. In its early decades, the magazine sometimes published two or even three short stories in an issue, but in later years the pace has remained steady at one story per issue.

The nonfiction feature articles (usually the bulk of an issue) cover an eclectic array of topics. Subjects have included eccentric evangelist Creflo Dollar, the different ways in which humans perceive the passage of time, and Münchausen syndrome by proxy.

The magazine is known for its editorial traditions. Under the rubric &quot;Profiles&quot;, it has published articles about prominent people such as Ernest Hemingway, Henry R. Luce, Marlon Brando, Hollywood restaurateur Michael Romanoff, magician Ricky Jay, and mathematicians David and Gregory Chudnovsky. Other enduring features have been &quot;Goings on About Town&quot;, a listing of cultural and entertainment events in New York, and &quot;The Talk of the Town&quot;, a feuilleton or miscellany of brief pieces—frequently humorous, whimsical, or eccentric vignettes of life in New York—in a breezily light style, although latterly the section often begins with a serious commentary. For many years, newspaper snippets containing amusing errors, unintended meanings or badly mixed metaphors (&quot;Block That Metaphor&quot;) have been used as filler items, accompanied by a witty retort. There is no masthead listing the editors and staff. Despite some changes, the magazine has kept much of its traditional appearance over the decades in typography, layout, covers, and artwork. The magazine was acquired by Advance Publications, the media company owned by Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr, in 1985, for $200 million when it was earning less than $6 million a year.

Ross was succeeded as editor by William Shawn (1951–1987), followed by Robert Gottlieb (1987–1992) and Tina Brown (1992–1998). The current editor of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; is David Remnick, who succeeded Brown in July 1998.

Among the important nonfiction authors who began writing for the magazine during Shawn&#x27;s editorship were Dwight Macdonald, Kenneth Tynan, and Hannah Arendt, whose &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot; reportage appeared in the magazine, before it was published as a book.

Brown&#x27;s tenure attracted more controversy than Gottlieb&#x27;s or even Shawn&#x27;s, due to her high profile (Shawn, by contrast, had been an extremely shy, introverted figure), and to the changes she made to a magazine with a similar look for the previous half-century. She introduced color to the editorial pages (several years before &quot;The New York Times&quot;) and included photography, with less type on each page and a generally more modern layout. More substantively, she increased the coverage of current events and topics such as celebrities and business tycoons, and placed short pieces throughout &quot;Goings on About Town&quot;, including a racy column about nightlife in Manhattan. A letters-to-the-editor page was introduced, and authors&#x27; bylines were added to their &quot;Talk of the Town&quot; pieces.

Since the late 1990s, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; has used the Internet to publish current and archived material, and maintains a website with some content from the current issue (plus exclusive web-only content). Subscribers have access to the full current issue online and a complete archive of back issues viewable as they were originally printed. In addition, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s cartoons are available for purchase online. A digital archive of back issues from 1925 to April 2008 (representing more than 4,000 issues and half a million pages) was also issued on DVD-ROMs and on a small portable hard drive. More recently, an iPad version of the current issue has been released. In 2014, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; opened up online access to its archive, expanded its plans to run an ambitious website, and launched a paywalled subscription model. Web editor Nicholas Thompson said, &quot;What we&#x27;re trying to do is to make a website that is to the Internet what the magazine is to all other magazines&quot;.

The magazine&#x27;s editorial staff unionized in 2018 and The New Yorker Union signed its first collective bargaining agreement in 2021.

=== Influence and significance ===
&quot;The New Yorker&quot; influenced a number of similar magazines, including &quot;The Brooklynite&quot; (1926 to 1930), &quot;The Chicagoan&quot; (1926 to 1935), and Paris&#x27;s &quot;The Boulevardier&quot; (1927 to 1932).

Kurt Vonnegut said that &quot;The New Yorker&quot; has been an effective instrument for getting a large audience to appreciate modern literature. Tom Wolfe wrote of the magazine: &quot;The &quot;New Yorker&quot; style was one of leisurely meandering understatement, droll when in the humorous mode, tautological and litotical when in the serious mode, constantly amplified, qualified, adumbrated upon, nuanced and renuanced, until the magazine&#x27;s pale-gray pages became High Baroque triumphs of the relative clause and appository modifier&quot;.

Joseph Rosenblum, reviewing Ben Yagoda&#x27;s &quot;About Town&quot;, a history of the magazine from 1925 to 1985, wrote, &quot;&quot;The New Yorker&quot; did create its own universe. As one longtime reader wrote to Yagoda, this was a place &#x27;where Peter DeVries ... was forever lifting a glass of Piesporter, where Niccolò Tucci (in a plum velvet dinner jacket) flirted in Italian with Muriel Spark, where Nabokov sipped tawny port from a prismatic goblet (while a Red Admirable perched on his pinky), and where John Updike tripped over the master&#x27;s Swiss shoes, excusing himself charmingly.

=== Cinema ===
&quot;New Yorker&quot; articles have been regular sources for motion pictures. Both fiction and nonfiction pieces have been adapted for the big screen, including the unreleased &quot;Coyote vs. Acme&quot;, based on Ian Frazier&#x27;s article of the same name; &quot;Spiderhead&quot; (2022), based on George Saunders&#x27;s story &quot;Escape from Spiderhead&quot;; &quot;Flash of Genius&quot; (2008), based on a true account of the invention of the intermittent windshield wiper by John Seabrook; &quot;Away from Her&quot;, adapted from Alice Munro&#x27;s short story &quot;The Bear Came over the Mountain&quot;, which debuted at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival; &quot;The Namesake&quot; (2007), similarly based on Jhumpa Lahiri&#x27;s novel, which originated as a short story in the magazine; &quot;The Bridge&quot; (2006), based on Tad Friend&#x27;s 2003 nonfiction piece &quot;Jumpers&quot;; &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; (2005), an adaptation of the short story by Annie Proulx that appeared in the October 13, 1997, issue; Jonathan Safran Foer&#x27;s 2001 debut in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, which later came to theaters in Liev Schreiber&#x27;s debut as both screenwriter and director, &quot;Everything Is Illuminated&quot; (2005); Michael Cunningham&#x27;s&quot; The Hours&quot;, which appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; before becoming the film that garnered the 2002 Best Actress Academy Award for Nicole Kidman; &quot;Adaptation&quot; (2002), which Charlie Kaufman based on Susan Orlean&#x27;s &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot;, written for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;; Frank McCourt&#x27;s &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot; (1999), which also appeared, in part, in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; before its film adaptation was released in 1999; &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1991) and its sequel, &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; (1993), both inspired by the work of &quot;New Yorker&quot; cartoonist Charles Addams; Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;Casualties of War&quot; (1989), which began as a &quot;New Yorker&quot; article by Daniel Lang; &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; (1999), starring Hilary Swank, which began as an article in the magazine; &quot;Iris&quot; (2001), about the life of Iris Murdoch and John Bayley, the article written by Bayley for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; before he completed his full memoir, the film starring Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent; &quot;The Swimmer&quot; (1968), starring Burt Lancaster, based on a John Cheever short story from &quot;The New Yorker&quot;; &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; (1967), the widely nominated adaptation of the 1965 nonfiction serial written for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; by Truman Capote; &quot;Pal Joey&quot; (1957), based on a series of stories by John O&#x27;Hara; &quot;Mister 880&quot; (1950), starring Edmund Gwenn, based on a story by longtime editor St. Clair McKelway; &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot; (1947), which began as a story by longtime &quot;New Yorker&quot; contributor James Thurber; and &quot;Junior Miss&quot; (1941) and &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; (1944), both adapted from Sally Benson&#x27;s short stories.

===United States presidential election endorsements===
In its November 1, 2004, issue, the magazine endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time, choosing Democratic nominee John Kerry over incumbent Republican George W. Bush.

== Cartoons ==
&quot;The New Yorker&quot; has featured cartoons (usually gag cartoons) since it began publication in 1925. For years, its cartoon editor was Lee Lorenz, who first began cartooning in 1956 and became a &quot;New Yorker&quot; contract contributor in 1958. After serving as the magazine&#x27;s art editor from 1973 to 1993 (when he was replaced by Françoise Mouly), he continued in the position of cartoon editor until 1998. His book &quot;The Art of the New Yorker: 1925–1995&quot; (Knopf, 1995) was the first comprehensive survey of all aspects of the magazine&#x27;s graphics. In 1998, Robert Mankoff took over as cartoon editor and edited at least 14 collections of &quot;New Yorker&quot; cartoons. Mankoff also usually contributed a short article to each book, describing some aspect of the cartooning process or the methods used to select cartoons for the magazine. He left the magazine in 2017.

&quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s stable of cartoonists has included many important talents in American humor, including Charles Addams, Peter Arno, Charles Barsotti, George Booth, Roz Chast, Tom Cheney, Sam Cobean, Leo Cullum, Richard Decker, Pia Guerra, J. B. Handelsman, Helen E. Hokinson, Pete Holmes, Ed Koren, Reginald Marsh, Mary Petty, George Price, Charles Saxon, Burr Shafer, Otto Soglow, William Steig, Saul Steinberg, James Stevenson, James Thurber, and Gahan Wilson.

Many early &quot;New Yorker&quot; cartoonists did not caption their cartoons. In his book &quot;The Years with Ross&quot;, Thurber describes the newspaper&#x27;s weekly art meeting, where cartoons submitted over the previous week were brought up from the mail room to be looked over by Ross, the editorial department, and a number of staff writers. Cartoons were often rejected or sent back to artists with requested amendments, while others were accepted and captions were written for them. Some artists hired their own writers; Hokinson hired James Reid Parker in 1931. Brendan Gill relates in his book &quot;Here at The New Yorker&quot; that at one point in the early 1940s, the quality of the artwork submitted to the magazine seemed to improve. It later was found out that the office boy (a teenaged Truman Capote) had been acting as a volunteer art editor, dropping pieces he did not like down the far end of his desk.

Several of the magazine&#x27;s cartoons have reached a higher plateau of fame. One 1928 cartoon drawn by Carl Rose and captioned by E. B. White shows a mother telling her daughter, &quot;It&#x27;s broccoli, dear&quot;. The daughter responds, &quot;I say it&#x27;s spinach and I say the hell with it&quot;. The phrase &quot;I say it&#x27;s spinach&quot; entered the vernacular, and three years later, the Broadway musical &quot;Face the Music&quot; included Irving Berlin&#x27;s song &quot;I Say It&#x27;s Spinach (And the Hell with It)&quot;. The catchphrase &quot;&quot; originated with the 1941 Peter Arno cartoon showing an engineer walking away from a crashed plane, saying, &quot;Well, back to the old drawing board&quot;.

The most reprinted is Peter Steiner&#x27;s 1993 drawing of two dogs at a computer, with one saying, &quot;On the Internet, nobody knows you&#x27;re a dog&quot;. According to Mankoff, Steiner and the magazine have split more than $100,000 in fees paid for the licensing and reprinting of this single cartoon, with more than half going to Steiner.

Over seven decades, many hardcover compilations of &quot;New Yorker&quot; cartoons have been published, and in 2004, Mankoff edited &quot;The Complete Cartoons of The New Yorker&quot;, a 656-page collection with 2,004 of the magazine&#x27;s best cartoons published during 80 years, plus a double CD set with all 68,647 cartoons ever published in the magazine. This features a search function allowing readers to search for cartoons by cartoonist&#x27;s name or year of publication. The newer group of cartoonists in recent years includes Pat Byrnes, J. C. Duffy, Liana Finck, Emily Flake, Robert Leighton, Michael Maslin, Julia Suits, and P. C. Vey. Will McPhail cited his beginnings as &quot;just ripping off &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, Bill Watterson, and doing little dot eyes&quot;. The notion that some &quot;New Yorker&quot; cartoons have punchlines so oblique as to be impenetrable became a subplot in the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Cartoon&quot;, as well as a playful jab in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Sweetest Apu&quot;.

In April 2005, the magazine began using the last page of each issue for &quot;The New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest&quot;. Captionless cartoons by &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s regular cartoonists are printed each week. Captions are submitted by readers, and three are chosen as finalists. Readers then vote on the winner. Anyone age 13 or older can enter or vote. Each contest winner receives a print of the cartoon (with the winning caption) signed by the artist who drew the cartoon. In 2017, after Bob Mankoff left the magazine, Emma Allen became the youngest and first female cartoon editor in the magazine&#x27;s history. 

=== Comics journalism ===
Since 1993, the magazine has published occasional stories of comics journalism (alternately called &quot;sketchbook reports&quot;) by such cartoonists as Marisa Acocella Marchetto, Barry Blitt, Sue Coe, Robert Crumb and Aline Kominsky-Crumb, Jules Feiffer, Ben Katchor, Carol Lay, Gary Panter, Art Spiegelman, Mark Alan Stamaty, and Ronald Wimberly.

== Crosswords and puzzles ==
In April 2018, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; launched a crossword puzzle series with a weekday crossword published every Monday. Subsequently, it launched a second, weekend crossword that appears on Fridays and relaunched cryptic puzzles that were run in the magazine in the late 1990s. In June 2021, it began publishing new cryptics weekly. In July 2021, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; introduced Name Drop, a trivia game, which is posted online weekdays. In March 2022, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; moved to publishing online crosswords every weekday, with decreasing difficulty Monday through Thursday and themed puzzles on Fridays. The puzzles are written by a rotating stable of 13 constructors. They integrate cartoons into the solving experience. The Christmas 2019 issue featured a crossword puzzle by Patrick Berry that had cartoons as clues, with the answers being captions for the cartoons. In December 2019, Liz Maynes-Aminzade was named &quot;The New Yorker&quot; first puzzles and games editor.

== Eustace Tilley ==

The magazine&#x27;s first cover illustration, a dandy peering at a butterfly through a monocle, was drawn by Rea Irvin, the magazine&#x27;s first art editor, based on an 1834 caricature of the then Count d&#x27;Orsay that appeared as an illustration in the 11th edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. The gentleman on the original cover, now known as Eustace Tilley, is a character created for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; by Corey Ford. The hero of a series titled &quot;The Making of a Magazine&quot;, which began on the inside front cover of the August 8 issue that first summer, Tilley was a younger man than the figure on the original cover. His top hat was of a newer style, without the curved brim. He wore a morning coat and striped formal trousers. Ford borrowed Eustace Tilley&#x27;s last name from an aunt—he had always found it vaguely humorous. &quot;Eustace&quot; was selected by Ford for euphony.

The character has become a kind of mascot for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, frequently appearing in its pages and on promotional materials. Traditionally, Irvin&#x27;s original Tilley cover illustration is used every year on the issue closest to the anniversary date of February 21, though on several occasions a newly drawn variation has been substituted.

== Covers ==

The magazine is known for its illustrated and often topical covers.

=== &quot;View of the World&quot; cover ===

Saul Steinberg created 85 covers and 642 internal drawings and illustrations for the magazine. His most famous work is probably its March 29, 1976, cover, an illustration most often called &quot;View of the World from 9th Avenue&quot; and sometimes called &quot;A Parochial New Yorker&#x27;s View of the World&quot; or &quot;A New Yorker&#x27;s View of the World&quot;, which depicts a map of the world as seen by self-absorbed New Yorkers.

The illustration is split in two, with the bottom half of the image showing Manhattan&#x27;s 9th Avenue, 10th Avenue, and the Hudson River (appropriately labeled), and the top half depicting the rest of the world. The rest of the United States is the size of the three New York City blocks and is drawn as a square, with a thin brown strip along the Hudson representing &quot;Jersey&quot;, the names of five cities (Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.; Las Vegas; Kansas City; and Chicago) and three states (Texas, Utah, and Nebraska) scattered among a few rocks for the U.S. beyond New Jersey. The Pacific Ocean, perhaps half again as wide as the Hudson, separates the U.S. from three flattened land masses labeled China, Japan and Russia.

The illustration—humorously depicting New Yorkers&#x27; self-image of their place in the world, or perhaps outsiders&#x27; view of New Yorkers&#x27; self-image—inspired many similar works, including the poster for the 1984 film &quot;Moscow on the Hudson&quot;; that movie poster led to a lawsuit, &quot;Steinberg v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.&quot;, 663 F. Supp. 706 (S.D.N.Y. 1987), which held that Columbia Pictures violated the copyright that Steinberg held on his work.

The cover was later satirized by Barry Blitt for the cover of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on October 6, 2008. The cover featured Sarah Palin looking out of her window seeing only Alaska, with Russia in the far background.

The March 21, 2009, cover of &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;How China sees the World&quot;, is also an homage to the original image, depicting the viewpoint from Beijing&#x27;s Chang&#x27;an Avenue instead of Manhattan.

=== 9/11 ===
Hired by Tina Brown in 1992, Art Spiegelman worked for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; for ten years but resigned a few months after the September 11 terrorist attacks. The cover created by Spiegelman and Françoise Mouly for the September 24, 2001, issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; received wide acclaim and was voted as being among the top ten magazine covers of the past 40 years by the American Society of Magazine Editors, which commented:

At first glance, the cover appears to be totally black, but upon close examination it reveals the silhouettes of the World Trade Center towers in a slightly darker shade of black. In some situations, the ghost images become visible only when the magazine is tilted toward a light source. In September 2004, Spiegelman reprised the image on the cover of his book &quot;In the Shadow of No Towers&quot;, in which he relates his experience of the Twin Towers attack and its psychological aftereffects.

=== &quot;New Yorkistan&quot; ===
In the December 2001 issue, the magazine printed a cover by Maira Kalman and Rick Meyerowitz showing a map of New York in which various neighborhoods were labeled with humorous names reminiscent of Middle Eastern and Central Asian place names and referencing the neighborhood&#x27;s real name or characteristics (e.g., &quot;Fuhgeddabouditstan&quot;, &quot;Botoxia&quot;). The cover had some cultural resonance in the wake of September 11, and became a popular print and poster.

=== Controversial covers ===
==== Crown Heights in 1993 ====
For the 1993 Valentine&#x27;s Day issue, the magazine cover by Art Spiegelman depicted a black woman and a Hasidic Jewish man kissing, referencing the Crown Heights riot of 1991. The cover was criticized by both black and Jewish observers. Jack Salzman and Cornel West called the reaction to the cover the magazine&#x27;s &quot;first national controversy&quot;.

==== 2008 Obama cover satire and controversy ====

&quot;The Politics of Fear&quot;, a cartoon by Barry Blitt featured on the cover of the July 21, 2008, issue, depicts then presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama in the turban and shalwar kameez typical of many Muslims, fist bumping with his wife, Michelle, portrayed with an Afro and wearing camouflage trousers with an assault rifle slung over her back. They are standing in the Oval Office, with a portrait of Osama bin Laden hanging on the wall and an American flag burning in the fireplace in the background.

Many &quot;New Yorker&quot; readers saw the image as a lampoon of &quot;The Politics of Fear&quot;, as was its title. Some Obama supporters, as well as his presumptive Republican opponent, John McCain, accused the magazine of publishing an incendiary cartoon whose irony could be lost on some readers. Editor David Remnick felt the image&#x27;s obvious excesses rebuffed the concern that it could be misunderstood, even by those unfamiliar with the magazine. &quot;The intent of the cover&quot;, he said, &quot;is to satirize the vicious and racist attacks and rumors and misconceptions about the Obamas that have been floating around in the blogosphere and are reflected in public opinion polls. What we set out to do was to throw all these images together, which are all over the top and to shine a kind of harsh light on them, to satirize them.&quot;

In an interview on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; shortly after the magazine issue began circulating, Obama said, &quot;Well, I know it was &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s attempt at satire... I don&#x27;t think they were entirely successful with it&quot;. Obama also pointed to his own efforts to debunk the allegations the cover depicted through a website his campaign set up, saying that the allegations were &quot;actually an insult against Muslim-Americans&quot;.

Later that week, &quot;The Daily Show&quot;″s Jon Stewart continued &quot;The New Yorker&quot; cover&#x27;s argument about Obama stereotypes with a piece showcasing a montage of clips containing such stereotypes culled from various legitimate news sources. Stewart and Stephen Colbert parodied &quot;The New Yorker&quot; Obama cover on the October 3, 2008, cover of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine, with Stewart as Barack and Colbert as Michelle, photographed for the magazine in New York City on September 18.

&quot;New Yorker&quot; covers are sometimes unrelated to the contents of the magazine or only tangentially related. The article about Obama in the July 21, 2008, issue did not discuss the attacks and rumors but rather Obama&#x27;s political career. The magazine later endorsed Obama for president.

This parody was most likely inspired by Fox News host E. D. Hill&#x27;s paraphrasing of an anonymous internet comment in asking whether a gesture made by Obama and his wife Michelle was a &quot;terrorist fist jab&quot;. Later, Hill&#x27;s contract was not renewed.

==== 2013 Bert and Ernie cover ====
&quot;The New Yorker&quot; chose an image of Bert and Ernie by artist Jack Hunter, titled &quot;Moment of Joy&quot;, as the cover of the July 8, 2013, issue, which covered the Supreme Court decisions on the Defense of Marriage Act and California Proposition 8. The &quot;Sesame Street&quot; characters have long been rumored in urban legend to be homosexual partners, though Sesame Workshop has repeatedly denied this, saying they are merely &quot;puppets&quot; and have no sexual orientation. Reaction was mixed. Online magazine &quot;Slate&quot; criticized the cover, which shows Ernie leaning on Bert&#x27;s shoulder as they watch a television with the Supreme Court justices on the screen, saying, &quot;it&#x27;s a terrible way to commemorate a major civil-rights victory for gay and lesbian couples&quot;. &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, meanwhile, said it was &quot;one of [the magazine&#x27;s] most awesome covers of all time&quot;.

==== 2023 &quot;Race for Office&quot; cover ====
The cover of the October 2, 2023, issue, titled &quot;The Race for Office&quot;, depicts several top U.S. politicians—Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, Nancy Pelosi, and Joe Biden—running the titular race for office with walkers. Many have questioned the mental and physical states of these and other older politicians, particularly those who have decided to run for reelection. While many acknowledged the cover as satirizing this issue, others criticized the &quot;ableism and ageism&quot; of mocking older people and people who use walkers. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said the cover &quot;portrays the irony and absurdity of the advanced-age politicians currently vying for our top offices&quot;.

== Style ==
&quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s signature display typeface, used for its nameplate and headlines and the masthead above &quot;The Talk of the Town&quot; section, is Irvin, named after its creator, the designer-illustrator Rea Irvin. The body text of all articles in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; is set in Adobe Caslon.

One uncommonly formal feature of the magazine&#x27;s in-house style is the placement of diaeresis marks in words with repeating vowels—such as &quot;reëlected&quot;, &quot;preëminent&quot;, and &quot;coöperate&quot;—in which the two vowel letters indicate separate vowel sounds. The magazine also continues to use a few spellings that are otherwise little used in American English, such as &quot;fuelled&quot;, &quot;focussed&quot;, &quot;venders&quot;, &quot;teen-ager&quot;, &quot;traveller&quot;, &quot;marvellous&quot;, &quot;carrousel&quot;, and &quot;cannister&quot;.

The magazine also spells out the names of numerical amounts, such as &quot;two million three hundred thousand dollars&quot; instead of &quot;$2.3 million,&quot; even for very large figures.

== Fact-checking ==
In 1927, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; ran an article about Edna St. Vincent Millay that contained multiple factual errors, and her mother threatened to sue the publication for libel. Consequently, the magazine developed extensive fact-checking procedures, which became integral to its reputation as early as the 1940s. In 2019, the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; said that &quot;no publication has been more consistently identified with its rigorous fact-checking.&quot; About 30 people work in the fact-checking department, as of 2025.

At least two defamation lawsuits have been filed over articles published in the magazine, though neither were won by the plaintiff. Two 1983 articles by Janet Malcolm about Sigmund Freud&#x27;s legacy led to a lawsuit from writer Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, who claimed that Malcolm had fabricated quotes attributed to him. After years of proceedings and appeals, a jury found in Malcolm&#x27;s favor in 1994. In 2010, David Grann wrote an article for the magazine about art expert Peter Paul Biro that scrutinized and expressed skepticism about Biro&#x27;s stated methods to identify forgeries. Biro sued &quot;The New Yorker&quot; for defamation, alongside multiple other news outlets that reported on the article, but the case was summarily dismissed.

== Readership ==
Despite its title, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; is read nationwide, with 53 percent of its circulation in the top 10 U.S. metropolitan areas. According to Mediamark Research Inc., the average age of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; readers in 2009 was 47 (compared to 43 in 1980 and 46 in 1990). The average household income of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; readers in 2009 was $109,877 (the average income in 1980 was $62,788 and the average income in 1990 was $70,233).

Politically, the magazine&#x27;s readership holds generally liberal views. According to a 2014 Pew Research Center survey, 77% of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s readers have left-of-center political values, and 52% of them hold &quot;consistently liberal&quot; political values.

== Films about &quot;The New Yorker&quot; ==
In &quot;Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle&quot;, a film about the Algonquin Round Table starring Jennifer Jason Leigh as Dorothy Parker, Sam Robards portrays founding editor Harold Ross trying to drum up support for his fledgling publication.

The magazine&#x27;s former editor, William Shawn, is portrayed in &quot;Capote&quot; (2005), &quot;Infamous&quot; (2006), and &quot;Hannah Arendt&quot; (2012).

The 2015 documentary &quot;Very Semi-Serious&quot;, directed by Leah Wolchok and produced by Wolchok and Davina Pardo (Redora Films), presents a behind-the-scenes look at the cartoons of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

<text>Terence Hanbury &quot;Tim&quot; White (29 May 1906 – 17 January 1964) was an English writer. He is best known for his Arthurian novels, which were published together in 1958 as &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;. One of his best known is the first of the series, &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;, which was published as a stand-alone book in 1938.

==Early life==
White was born in Bombay, British India, to Garrick Hanbury White, a superintendent in the Indian police, and Constance Edith Southcote Aston. White had a troubled childhood, with an alcoholic father and an emotionally cold mother, and his parents separated when he was 14.

==Education and teaching==
White went to Cheltenham College in Gloucestershire, a public school, and Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, where he was tutored by the scholar and occasional author L. J. Potts, who became a lifelong friend and correspondent. White later referred to him as &quot;the great literary influence in my life.&quot; While at Queens&#x27; College, White wrote a thesis on Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, and graduated in 1928 with a first-class degree in English.

White then taught at Stowe School in Buckinghamshire for four years. In 1936 he published &quot;England Have My Bones&quot;, a well-received memoir about a year spent in England. The same year, he left Stowe School and lived in a workman&#x27;s cottage nearby, where he wrote and &quot;revert[ed] to a feral state&quot;, engaging in falconry, hunting, and fishing. White also became interested in aviation, partly to conquer his fear of heights.

==Writing==
White&#x27;s novel &quot;Earth Stopped&quot; (1934) and its sequel &quot;Gone to Ground&quot; (1935) are science fiction novels about a disaster that devastates the world. &quot;Gone to Ground&quot; contains several fantasy stories told by the survivors that were later reprinted in &quot;The Maharajah and Other Stories&quot;.

White wrote to a friend that, in autumn 1937, &quot;I got desperate among my books and picked [Malory] up in lack of anything else. Then I was thrilled and astonished to find that (a) The thing was a perfect tragedy, with a beginning, a middle and an end implicit in the beginning and (b) the characters were real people with recognizable reactions which could be forecast. ... Anyway, I somehow started writing a book.&quot;

The novel, which White described as &quot;a preface to Malory&quot;, was titled &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; and published in 1938, telling the story of the boyhood of King Arthur. White was also influenced by Freudian psychology and his own lifelong involvement in natural history. &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; was critically well-received and was a Book of the Month Club selection in 1939.

In February 1939, White moved to Doolistown in County Meath, Ireland, where he lived out the Second World War as a &quot;de facto&quot; conscientious objector. In Ireland, he wrote most of what became &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;: &quot;The Witch in the Wood&quot; (later cut and rewritten as &quot;The Queen of Air and Darkness&quot;) in 1939, and &quot;The Ill-Made Knight&quot; in 1940. The version of &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; included in &quot;The Once and Future King&quot; differs from the earlier version; it is darker, and some critics prefer the earlier version.

==Later life==
In 1946, White settled in Alderney, the third-largest Channel Island, where he lived for the rest of his life. The same year, he published &quot;Mistress Masham&#x27;s Repose&quot;, a children&#x27;s book in which a young girl discovers a group of Lilliputians (the tiny people in Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;) living near her house. &quot;Mistress Masham&#x27;s Repose&quot; was influenced by John Masefield&#x27;s book &quot;The Midnight Folk&quot;. In 1947, he published &quot;The Elephant and the Kangaroo&quot;, a novel in which a repetition of Noah&#x27;s Flood occurs in Ireland.

In the early 1950s, he published two non-fiction books. &quot;The Age of Scandal&quot; (1950) is a collection of essays about 18th-century England. &quot;The Goshawk&quot; (1951) is an account of his attempt to train a northern goshawk using traditional rather than modern falconry techniques. He wrote it at his cottage in the mid-1930s, but he did not publish it until his agent David Garnett discovered it and insisted that it be published. In 1954, White translated and edited &quot;The Book of Beasts&quot;, an English translation of a medieval bestiary written in Latin.

In 1958, White completed the fourth book of &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;, &quot;The Candle in the Wind&quot;, which was first published with the other three parts and has never been published separately. White lived to see his Arthurian work adapted as the Broadway musical &quot;Camelot&quot; (1960) and the animated film &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; (1963).

==Death==
White died of heart failure on 17 January 1964 aboard ship in Piraeus, Athens, Greece, en route to Alderney from a lecture tour in the United States. He is buried in the First Cemetery of Athens. &quot;The Book of Merlyn&quot; was published posthumously in 1977 as a conclusion to &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;. His papers are held by the University of Texas at Austin.

==Personal life==
According to Sylvia Townsend Warner&#x27;s 1967 biography, White was &quot;a homosexual and a sado-masochist.&quot; He came close to marrying several times but had no enduring romantic relationships. In his diaries of Zed, a young boy, he wrote: &quot;I have fallen in love with Zed ... the whole situation is an impossible one. All I can do is behave like a gentleman. It has been my hideous fate to be born with an infinite capacity for love and joy with no hope of using them.&quot;

Robert Robinson published an account of a conversation with White in which White claimed to be attracted to women. Robinson concluded that this was a cover for homosexuality. Julie Andrews wrote in her autobiography, &quot;I believe Tim may have been an unfulfilled homosexual, and he suffered a lot because of it.&quot;

However, White&#x27;s long-time friend and literary agent David Higham wrote, &quot;Tim was no homosexual, though I think at one time he had feared he was (and in his ethos fear would have been the word).&quot; Higham gave Sylvia Townsend Warner the address of one of White&#x27;s lovers &quot;so that she could get in touch with someone so important in Tim&#x27;s story. But she never, the girl told me, took that step. So she was able to present Tim in such a light that a reviewer could call him a raging homosexual. Perhaps a heterosexual affair would have made her blush.&quot;

Lin Carter portrays White in &quot;Imaginary Worlds&quot; as a man who felt deeply but was unable to form close human relationships because of his unfortunate childhood. &quot;He was a man with an enormous capacity for loving. It shows in his prodigious correspondence and in his affection for dogs, and in the bewildered and inarticulate loves his characters experience in his books; but he had few close friends, and no genuine relationship with a woman.&quot;

White was agnostic and a heavy drinker towards the end of his life. Warner wrote of him, &quot;Notably free from fearing God, he was basically afraid of the human race.&quot;

==Influence==
Fantasy writer Michael Moorcock enjoyed White&#x27;s &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;, and was especially influenced by the underpinnings of realism in his work. Moorcock eventually engaged in a &quot;wonderful correspondence&quot; with White, and later recalled that White gave him &quot;some very good advice on how to write&quot;.

J. K. Rowling has said that White&#x27;s writing strongly influenced the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books; several critics have compared Rowling&#x27;s character Albus Dumbledore to White&#x27;s absent-minded Merlyn, and Rowling herself has described White&#x27;s Wart as &quot;Harry&#x27;s spiritual ancestor.&quot; Author Neil Gaiman was asked about the similarities between Harry Potter and Gaiman&#x27;s character Timothy Hunter, and he stated that he did not think Rowling had based her character on Hunter. &quot;I said to [the reporter] that I thought we were both just stealing from T. H. White: very straightforward.&quot;

Gregory Maguire was influenced by &quot;White&#x27;s ability to be intellectually broadminded, to be comic, to be poetic, and to be fantastic&quot; in the writing of his 1995 novel &quot;Wicked&quot;, and crime fiction writer Ed McBain also cited White as an influence.

White features extensively in Helen Macdonald&#x27;s &quot;H is for Hawk&quot;, winner of the 2014 Samuel Johnson Prize for non-fiction. One of the components of the book is a biographical account of White and also &quot;The Goshawk&quot;, an account of his own attempt to train a hawk.

<doc id="31369" wikidata="Q602760" url="?curid=31369" title="The Lizard">
<text>The Lizard () is a peninsula in southern Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The southernmost point of the British mainland is near Lizard Point at SW 701115; Lizard village, also known as the Lizard, is the most southerly on the British mainland, and is in the civil parish of Landewednack, the most southerly parish. The valleys of the river Helford and Loe Pool form the northern boundary, with the rest of the peninsula surrounded by sea. The area measures about . The Lizard is one of England&#x27;s natural regions and has been designated as a National Character Area 157 by Natural England. The peninsula is known for its geology and for its rare plants and lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

The Lizard&#x27;s coast is particularly hazardous to shipping and the seaways round the peninsula were historically known as the &quot;Graveyard of Ships&quot;. The Lizard Lighthouse was built at Lizard Point in 1752 and the RNLI operates the Lizard lifeboat station.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Lizard&quot; is most probably a corruption of the Cornish name &quot;Lys Ardh&quot;, meaning &quot;high court&quot;; it is purely coincidental that much of the peninsula is composed of serpentinite-bearing rock. The peninsula&#x27;s original name may have been the Celtic &quot;Bridanoc&quot;, from &quot;Britannakon&quot; (&quot;the &quot;British one&quot;), preserved in the name of the former village of Predannack, now site of Predannack Airfield.

==History==
There is evidence of early habitation with several burial mounds and stones. Part of the peninsula is known as the Meneage (land of the monks).

Helston, the nearest town to the Lizard peninsula, is said to have once headed the estuary of the River Cober, before it was cut off from the sea by Loe Bar in the 13th century. It is speculated that Helston was once a port, but no records exist. Geomorphologists believe the bar was most likely formed by rising sea levels, after the last ice age, blocking the river and creating a barrier beach. The beach is formed mostly of flint and the nearest source is found offshore under the drowned terraces of the former river that flowed between England and France, and now under the English Channel. The medieval port of Helston was at Gweek, possibly from around 1260 onward, on the Helford river which exported tin and copper. Helston was believed to be in existence in the sixth century, around the River Cober (&quot;Dowr Kohar&quot;).
The name comes from the Cornish &quot;hen lis&quot; or &quot;old court&quot; and &quot;ton&quot; added later to denote a Saxon manor; the Domesday Book refers to it as Henliston (which survives as the name of a road in the town). It was granted its charter by King John in 1201. It was here that tin ingots were weighed to determine the duty due to the Duke of Cornwall when a number of stannary towns were authorised by royal decree.

The royal manor of Winnianton, which was held by King William I at the time of the Domesday Book (1086), was also the head manor of the hundred of Kerrier and the largest estate in Cornwall. It was assessed as having fifteen hides before 1066. At the time of Domesday there was land for sixty ploughs, but in the lord&#x27;s land there were two ploughs and in the lands held by villeins twenty-four ploughs. There were twenty-four villeins, forty-one freedmen, thirty-three smallholders and fourteen slaves. There was , eight square leagues of pasture and half a square league of woodland. The livestock was fourteen unbroken mares, three cattle and one hundred and twenty-eight sheep (in total 145 beasts); its value was £12 annually. 11 of the hides were held by the Count of Mortain and there is more arable and pasture and 13 more persons are recorded: Rinsey, Trelowarren, Mawgan-in-Meneage and seventeen other lands are also recorded under Winnianton.

Mullion has the 15th century church of St Mellanus, and the Old Inn from the 16th century. The harbour was completed in 1895 and financed by Lord Robartes of Lanhydrock as a recompense to the fishermen for several disastrous pilchard seasons.

The small church of St Peter in Coverack, built in 1885 for £500, has a serpentinite pulpit.

The Great Western Railway operated a road motor service to the Lizard from Helston railway station. Commencing on 17 August 1903, it was the first successful British railway-run bus service and was initially provided as a cheaper alternative to a proposed light railway.

The Solar eclipse of 11 August 1999 departed the UK mainland from the Lizard.

The transatlantic record run of the unaccompanied one hand sailor Thomas Coville within less than 5 days in his sailboat &quot;Sodebo Ultim&quot; from New York to Europe landed here on 15 July 2017.

===Nautical===

The Lizard has been the site of many maritime disasters. It forms a natural obstacle to entry and exit of Falmouth and its naturally deep estuary.
At Lizard Point stands the Lizard Lighthouse, where a light was erected by Sir John Killigrew at his own expense. It was built at the cost of &quot;20 nobles a year&quot; for 30 years, and caused many problems over the following years, as King James I considered charging vessels to pass. Thus, the lighthouse was demolished. It was rebuilt in 1751 by order of Thomas Fonnereau and remains almost unchanged today. Further east lie The Manacles, near Porthoustock: of jagged rocks just beneath the waves.

* In 1721 the &quot;Royal Anne Galley&quot;, an oared frigate, was wrecked at Lizard Point. Of a crew of 185 only three survived; lost was Lord Belhaven who was en route to take up the Governorship of Barbados.
* A 44-gun frigate, , was wrecked at Loe Bar in 1807. Although it wrecked close to shore, many lost their lives in the storm. This inspired Henry Trengrouse to invent the rocket-fired line, later to become the Breeches buoy.
* The transport ship &quot;Dispatch&quot; ran aground on the Manacles in 1809 on its return from the Peninsular War, losing 104 men from the 7th Hussars. The following day, with local villagers still attempting a rescue, the hit the northern end of these rocks. The only survivor of its 126 officers, men and boys was a drummer boy.
* 5 Sept 1856 the Cherubim and Ocean Home collided off Lizard Point 
* The , a passenger liner, also hit the Manacles in 1898 with the loss of 106 lives.
* The American passenger liner &quot;Paris&quot; was stranded on the Manacles in 1899, with no loss of life.

The biggest rescue in the RNLI&#x27;s history was 17 March 1907 when the 12,000-tonne liner hit the Maenheere Reef near Lizard Point in Cornwall. In a strong gale and dense fog RNLI lifeboat volunteers rescued 456 passengers, including 70 babies. Crews from the Lizard, Cadgwith, Coverack and Porthleven rowed out repeatedly for 16 hours to rescue all of the people on board. Six silver RNLI medals were later awarded, two to &quot;Suevic&quot; crew members.

The Battle at the Lizard, a naval battle, took place off the Lizard on 21 October 1707.

Smuggling was a regular, and often necessary, way of life in these parts, despite the efforts of coastguards or &quot;Preventive men&quot;. In 1801, the king&#x27;s pardon was offered to any smuggler giving information on the Mullion musket men involved in a gunfight with the crew of HM Gun Vessel &quot;Hecate&quot;.

===Aeronautical===
In the First World War a Naval Air Station was established at Bonython, flying mainly blimps used for spotting U-boats. One was sunk and several probably damaged by bombs dropped by the blimps. The airfield site is now occupied by the wind farm.

RAF Predannack Down (see Predannack Airfield) was a Second World War airbase, from which Coastal Command squadrons flew anti-submarine sorties into the Bay of Biscay as well as convoy support in the western English Channel. The runways still exist and the site is used by a local Air Cadet Volunteergliding Squadron 626VGS and as an emergency/relief base for RNAS &quot;Culdrose&quot; (HMS &quot;Seahawk&quot;).

RNAS Culdrose is Europe&#x27;s largest helicopter base, and currently hosts the Training and Operational Conversion Unit operating the EH101 &quot;Merlin&quot; helicopter. It is also the home base for Merlin Squadrons embarked upon Royal Navy warships, the Westland Sea King airborne early warning (AEW) variant helicopter, a Search And Rescue (Sea King, again) helicopter flight, and some BAe Hawk T.1 trainer jets used for training purposes by the Royal Navy. The base also operates some other types of fixed wing aircraft for calibration and other training purposes. As befits the base&#x27;s name, a non-flying example of a Hawker Sea Hawk forms the main gate guardian static display. RNAS Culdrose is a major contributor to the economy of the Lizard area.

===Political===

The Lizard peninsula is in the St Ives parliamentary constituency, which comprises the whole of the former district of Penwith and the southern part of the former district of Kerrier). The parishes northeast of the river Helford are in Camborne and Redruth parliamentary constituency

To the north, the Lizard peninsula is bordered by the civil parishes of Breage, Porthleven, Sithney, Helston, Wendron, Gweek and – across the Helford River – by Constantine, Kerrier and Mawnan.

The parishes on the peninsula proper are (west to east):
* &quot;Northern parishes:&quot;
** Gunwalloe
** Cury
** Mawgan-in-Meneage
** St Martin-in-Meneage
** Manaccan
** St Anthony-in-Meneage
* &quot;Southern parishes:&quot;
** Mullion
** Grade-Ruan
** St Keverne
** Landewednack

The Lizard&#x27;s political history includes the 1497 Cornish rebellion which began in St Keverne. The village blacksmith Michael Joseph (Michael &quot;An Gof&quot; in Cornish, meaning blacksmith) led the uprising, protesting against the punitive taxes levied by Henry VII to pay for the war against the Scots. The uprising was routed on its march to London and the two leaders, Michael Joseph and Thomas Flamank, were subsequently hanged, drawn and quartered.

===Technological===
Titanium was discovered here by the Reverend William Gregor in 1791.

In 1869, John Pender formed the Falmouth Gibraltar and Malta Telegraph company, intending to connect India to England with an undersea cable. Although intended to land at Falmouth, the final landing point was Porthcurno near Land&#x27;s End.

In 1900 Guglielmo Marconi stayed the Housel Bay Hotel in his quest to locate a coastal radio station to receive signals from ships equipped with his apparatus. He leased a plot &quot;in the wheat field adjoining the hotel&quot; where the Lizard Wireless Telegraph Station still stands today. Recently restored by the National Trust, it looks as it did in January 1901, when Marconi received the distance record signals of from his transmitter station at Niton, Isle of Wight. The Lizard Wireless Station is the oldest Marconi station to survive in its original state, and is located to the west of the Lloyds Signal Station in what appears to be a wooden hut. On 12 December 1901 Poldhu Point was the site of the first trans Atlantic, wireless signal radio communication when Marconi sent a signal to St John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. The technology is one of the key advances to the development of radio, television, satellites and the internet.

A radar station called RAF Dry Tree was built during World War II. The site was later chosen for the Telstar project in 1962; its rocky foundations, clear atmosphere and extreme southerly location being uniquely suitable. This became the Goonhilly satellite earth station, now owned by Goonhilly Earth Station Ltd. Some important developments in television satellite transmission were made at Goonhilly station.
A wind farm exists near to the Goonhilly station site.

==Geology==

Known as the Lizard Complex, the peninsula&#x27;s geology is the best preserved example of an exposed ophiolite in the United Kingdom.

An ophiolite is a suite of geological formations which represent a slice through a section of ocean crust (including the upper level of the mantle) thrust onto the continental crust.

The Lizard formations comprise three main units; the serpentinites, the &quot;oceanic complex&quot; and the metamorphic basement. The serpentinite contains significant samples of the serpentine polymorph lizardite, which were named after the Lizard complex in 1955.

==Ecology==
Several nature sites exist on the Lizard Peninsula; Predannack nature reserve, Mullion Island, Goonhilly Downs, and the Cornish Seal Sanctuary at Gweek. An area of the Lizard covering is designated a national nature reserve because of its coastal grasslands and heaths and inland heaths. The peninsula contains 3 main Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), both noted for their endangered insects and plants, as well as their geology. The first is East Lizard Heathlands SSSI, the second is &quot;Caerthillian to Kennack SSSI&quot; and the third is West Lizard SSSI, of which the important wetland, Hayle Kimbro Pool, forms a part of.

The area is also home to one of England&#x27;s rarest breeding birds — the Cornish chough. This species of corvid is distinctive due to its red beak and legs and haunting &quot;chee-aw&quot; call. Choughs were extinct in Cornwall but returned naturally in 2001 and began breeding on Lizard in 2002 following a concerted effort by the National Trust, English Nature and the RSPB.

The Lizard contains some of the most specialised flora of any area in Britain, including many Red Data Book plant species. Of particular note is the Cornish heath, &quot;Erica vagans&quot;, that occurs in abundance here, but which is found nowhere else in Britain. There are more than 600 species of flowering plants on the Lizard, nearly a quarter of all UK species. The reason for this richness is partly because of the many different and unusual Lizard rocks on the Lizard Peninsula. But above all, it is a coming together of multiple factors: a very mild maritime climate, but one prone to gales and salt winds; waterlogged and boggy soils, but ones that often parch and dry out in the summer; soils of greatly contrasting fertility and pH; and lastly man&#x27;s influence. Any single factor taken on its own would influence the flora; taken together, they combine, overlap and interact. Contrasting plant communities grow side-by-side in a mosaic that changes within a few metres but also changes markedly over time with the cycle of heath fires. It&#x27;s not so much that conditions are ideal for growth, but that there is such a variety of different, difficult conditions. Each habitat, with its own combination of factors, attracts its own specialist plants. It is also one of the few places where the rare formicine ant, &quot;Formica exsecta&quot;, (the narrow-headed ant), can be found.

==In pop culture==
Daphne du Maurier based many novels on this part of Cornwall, including &quot;Frenchman&#x27;s Creek&quot;.

The Lizard was featured on the BBC television programme &quot;Seven Natural Wonders&quot; as one of the wonders of the South West, and on the BBC series &quot;Coast&quot;.

In James Clavell&#x27;s novel &quot;Shōgun&quot;, ship&#x27;s pilot Vasco Rodrigues challenges John Blackthorne to recite the latitude of the Lizard to verify that Blackthorne is the Pilot of the Dutch vessel &quot;Erasmus&quot;.

The Jennifer McQuiston 2015 novel &quot;The Spinster&#x27;s Guide to Scandalous Behavior&quot; is set primarily in the fictional village Lizard Bay on the Lizard in the mid-nineteenth century.

In the television adaptation of &quot;Horatio Hornblower&quot;, an order is given to &quot;Weather the Lizard&quot; in the episode &quot;Hornblower:Mutiny&quot;.

&quot;Lizard Point&quot; is also a track on the 1982 album &quot;Ambient 4: On Land&quot; released by Brian Eno.

The book series &quot;Fenton House&quot; by Ben Cheetham is set on the Lizard Peninsula.

<doc id="31371" wikidata="Q189540" url="?curid=31371" title="Seven Samurai">
<text>is a 1954 Japanese epic samurai action film directed by Akira Kurosawa from a screenplay co-written with Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni. Taking place in 1586 in the Sengoku period of Japanese history, it follows the story of a village of desperate farmers who seek to hire samurai to combat bandits who will return after the harvest to steal their crops.

At the time, the film was the most expensive film made in Japan. It took a year to shoot and faced many difficulties. It was the second-highest-grossing domestic film in Japan in 1954. Many reviews compared the film to westerns.

&quot;Seven Samurai&quot; is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films in cinema history. Since its release, it has consistently ranked highly in critics&#x27; lists of greatest films, such as the BFI&#x27;s &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; and Rotten Tomatoes polls. It was also voted the greatest foreign-language film of all time in the BBC&#x27;s 2018 international critics&#x27; poll. It is regarded as one of the most &quot;remade, reworked, and referenced&quot; films in cinema.

==Plot==

In 1586, a bandit gang discusses raiding a mountain village, but their chief decides to wait until after the harvest for a better haul. The villagers overhear this and turn to Gisaku, the village elder and miller. Because the local magistrate is useless, Gisaku plans to hire samurai to protect the village. Since they have no money and can only offer food as payment, Gisaku advises the villagers to find &quot;hungry&quot; samurai.

Traveling to a nearby town, the villagers find Kambei, an aging but experienced rōnin, whom they see rescuing a young boy from a thief. A young samurai named Katsushirō asks to become Kambei’s disciple. The villagers ask for Kambei’s help, and he reluctantly agrees. He then recruits his old comrade-in-arms Shichirōji, along with Gorobei, Heihachi, and Kyūzō, a taciturn master swordsman whom Katsushirō regards with awe. Kikuchiyo, a wild and eccentric samurai-poser, is eventually accepted as well after attempts to drive him away fail.

Arriving at the village, the samurai and farmers slowly begin to trust each other. Katsushirō meets Shino, a farmer&#x27;s daughter disguised as a boy by her father, and begins a relationship with her despite knowing the difference in their social classes prohibits it. Later, the samurai are angered when Kikuchiyo brings them armor and weapons, which the villagers acquired by killing other samurai injured or fleeing from battle. Kikuchiyo angrily retorts that samurai are responsible for much of the suffering farmers endure, revealing he is an orphaned farmer&#x27;s son. The samurai&#x27;s anger turns to shame.

Kambei arms the villagers with bamboo spears, organizes them into squads, and trains them. Three bandit scouts are spotted; two are killed, while the last reveals their camp&#x27;s location before the villagers execute him. The samurai burn down the camp in a pre-emptive strike. Rikichi, a troubled villager aiding the samurai, breaks down when he sees his wife, who was kidnapped and made a concubine during a previous raid. Upon seeing Rikichi, she runs back into a burning hut to her death. Heihachi is killed by a gunshot while trying to stop Rikichi from pursuing her. At Heihachi&#x27;s funeral, the saddened villagers are inspired by Kikuchiyo, who raises a banner Heihachi made to represent the six samurai, Kikuchiyo, and the village.

When the bandits finally arrive, they are confounded by the new fortifications, which include a moat and high wooden fences. They burn the village&#x27;s outlying houses, including Gisaku&#x27;s mill. Gisaku&#x27;s family tries to save him when he refuses to abandon it, but all perish except a baby rescued by Kikuchiyo. The bandits then besiege the village, but many are killed as the defenders thwart every attack.

The bandits possess three matchlock muskets. Kyūzō ventures out alone and captures one; an envious Kikuchiyo abandons his squad to bring back another. However, Kikuchiyo&#x27;s absence allows a handful of bandits to infiltrate his post and kill several farmers, and Gorobei is slain defending his position. That night, Kambei predicts that the bandits will make one final assault due to their dwindling numbers.

Meanwhile, Katsushirō and Shino&#x27;s relationship is discovered by her father, who is enraged that her virginity has been taken and beats her. Kambei and the villagers intervene; Shichirōji reasons that such behavior is normal before battle and that the couple should be forgiven.

The next morning, the defenders allow the remaining bandits to enter the village and ambush them. As the battle nears its end, the bandit chief hides in the women&#x27;s hut and shoots Kyūzō dead with his musket. An enraged Kikuchiyo charges in and is shot as well, but kills the chief before dying. The remaining outlaws are slain.

Afterward, Kambei, Katsushirō and Shichirōji stand in front of the funeral mounds of their comrades, watching the joyful villagers sing while planting their crops. Katsushirō and Shino meet one last time, but Shino walks past him to join in the planting while Katsushiro despondently watches her. Kambei declares to Shichirōji that it is another pyrrhic victory for the samurai: &quot;The victory belongs to those peasants. Not to us.&quot;

==Production==
===Writing===
Akira Kurosawa had originally wanted to direct a film about a single day in the life of a samurai. Later, in the course of his research, he discovered a story about samurai defending farmers. According to actor Toshiro Mifune, the film was originally going to be called &quot;Six Samurai&quot;, with Mifune playing the role of Kyūzō. During the six-week scriptwriting process, Kurosawa and his screenwriters realized that &quot;six sober samurai were a bore—they needed a character that was more off-the-wall&quot;. Kurosawa recast Mifune as Kikuchiyo and gave him creative license to improvise in his performance. During the six-week scriptwriting process, the screenwriters were not allowed visitors or phone calls.

Kurosawa and the writers were innovative in refining the theme of the assembly of heroic characters to perform a mission. According to Michael Jeck&#x27;s DVD commentary, &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; was among the first films to use the now-common plot element of the recruiting and gathering of heroes into a team to accomplish a specific goal, a device used in later films such as &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;, &quot;Sholay&quot;, the western remake &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, and Pixar&#x27;s animated film &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;. Film critic Roger Ebert speculates in his review that the sequence introducing the leader Kambei (in which the samurai shaves off his topknot, a sign of honor among samurai, in order to pose as a monk to rescue a boy from a kidnapper) could be the origin of the practice, now common in action movies, of introducing the main hero with an undertaking unrelated to the main plot.

Other plot devices such as the reluctant hero, romance between a local woman and the youngest hero, and the nervousness of the common citizenry, had appeared in other films before this, but were combined in this film.

===Set design===
Kurosawa refused to shoot the peasant village at Toho Studios and had a complete set constructed at Tagata on the Izu Peninsula, Shizuoka. Although the studio protested against the increased production costs, Kurosawa was adamant that &quot;the quality of the set influences the quality of the actors&#x27; performances... For this reason, I have the sets made exactly like the real thing. It restricts the shooting but encourages that feeling of authenticity.&quot;
He also spoke of the &quot;intense labour&quot; of making the film: &quot;It rained all the time; we didn&#x27;t have enough horses. It was just the kind of picture that is impossible to make in this country.&quot;

===Filming===
Long before it was released, the film had already become a topic of wide discussion. After three months of pre-production, it had 148 shooting days spread out over a year—four times the span covered in the original budget, which eventually came to almost half a million dollars. Toho Studios closed down production at least twice. Each time, Kurosawa calmly went fishing, reasoning that the studio had already heavily invested in the production and would allow him to complete the picture. The film&#x27;s final battle scene, originally scheduled to be shot at the end of summer, was shot in February in near-freezing temperatures. Mifune later recalled that he had never been so cold in his life.

During filming for the scene where the samurai arrive at the village, Kurosawa set up a shot at the top of the mountain from which the village could be seen in the valley. In order for this to work as an evening shot, the crew spent the entire day setting up for the single shot, but camerman Asakazu Nakai and Kurosawa ended up debating when to start shooting the scene by looking at the light through the camera&#x27;s viewfinder. Despite spending the entire day preparing, Nakai&#x27;s hesitation to start shooting caused the sun to set and the scene wasn&#x27;t shot.

Through the creative freedom provided by the studio, Kurosawa made use of telephoto lenses, which were rare in 1954, as well as multiple cameras which allowed the action to fill the screen and place the audience right in the middle of it. &quot;If I had filmed it in the traditional shot-by-shot method, there was no guarantee that any action could be repeated in exactly the same way twice.&quot; He found it to be very effective and he later used it in movies that were less action-oriented. His method was to put one camera in the most orthodox shooting position, another camera for quick shots and a third camera &quot;as a kind of guerrilla unit&quot;. This method made for very complicated shoots, for which Kurosawa choreographed the movement of all three cameras by using diagrams.

The martial arts choreography for the film was led by Yoshio Sugino of the Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū. Initially Junzo Sasamori of the Ono-ha Itto-ryu worked with Sugino, but he was asked by the Ministry of Education to teach in Europe during production.

===Editing===
During filming, Kurosawa quickly earned a reputation with his crew as the &quot;world&#x27;s greatest editor&quot; because of his practice of editing late at night throughout the shooting. He described this as a practical necessity that is incomprehensible to most directors, who on major productions spent at least several months with their editors assembling and cutting the film after shooting is completed.

===Soundtrack===
Kurosawa had a heightened interest in the soundtracks of his films. For &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, he collaborated for the seventh and penultimate time with friend and composer Fumio Hayasaka. Hayasaka was already seriously ill when Kurosawa visited him during the filming of &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; and he died of tuberculosis on October 15, 1955, at the age of 41, while Kurosawa was filming &quot;I Live in Fear&quot;, his next film, which Hayasaka was unable to complete.

== Themes ==
In analyzing the film&#x27;s accuracy to sixteenth century Japan, Philip Kemp discusses the similarities between the samurai and the bandits.

Kenneth Turan notes that the long runtime &quot;reflects the entirety of the agricultural year, from planting to gorgeous blossoming to harvesting.&quot; Historian David Conrad notes that at the time of the movie&#x27;s release, nearly half of the Japanese population was still employed in agriculture. Although farm incomes were already rising as part of the Japanese economic miracle that would transform rural and urban lives in the 1950s and 60s, many of the village conditions depicted in the movie were still familiar to audiences in 1954.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
At 207 minutes, including a five-minute intermission with music, &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; was the longest film of Kurosawa&#x27;s career. Fearing that international audiences would be unwilling to sit through the entire picture, Toho Studios, alongside Kurosawa himself, originally removed 50 minutes from the film for international distribution &amp; reshowing in Japan. This &quot;General Release&quot; cut distributed around the world until the 1990s; since then, the complete version is usually seen.

The film was released in the United States in 1955, initially under the title &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;. Following the 1960 release of the American remake &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, the Japanese film&#x27;s title reverted to its original &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; in the United States.

===Home media===
Prior to the advent of DVD, various edited versions were distributed on video, but most DVDs and Blu-rays contain Kurosawa&#x27;s complete original version, including its five-minute intermission. Since 2006, the Criterion Collection&#x27;s US releases have featured their own exclusive 2K restoration, whereas most others, including all non-US Blu-rays, have an older HD transfer from Toho in Japan.

===4K restoration===
In 2016, Toho carried out a six-month-long 4K restoration, along with Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Ikiru&quot; (1952). As the whereabouts of &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;&#x27;s original negative are unknown, second-generation fine-grain positive and third-generation duplicate negative elements were used. It is available as a Digital Cinema Package from the British Film Institute. This version was first released on 4K Blu-ray in Japan as standard-dynamic-range video in June 2023 and was released on home video by the British Film Institute .

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Seven Samurai&quot; was well received by Japanese audiences, earning a distribution rental income of , within the first twelve months of its release. It was Japan&#x27;s third-highest-grossing film of 1954, out-grossing &quot;Godzilla&quot;, which had sold tickets and grossed an inflation-adjusted equivalent of or by 1998.

Overseas, the box-office income for the film&#x27;s 1956 North American release is currently unknown. The film&#x27;s 2002 re-release grossed $271,841 in the United States and $4,124 in France. At the 2002 Kurosawa &amp; Mifune Festival in the United States, the film grossed $561,692. This adds up to at least $833,533 grossed in the United States. Other European re-releases between 1997-2018 sold 27,627 tickets.

===Critical response===
&quot;Seven Samurai&quot; was released to broadly positive reviews in the west, but film scholar Stuart Galbraith IV has noted it received &quot;praise from American critics, but praise tainted by cultural condescension&quot; for its perceived similarities to the American Western; nevertheless, it is now considered one of the greatest films in history. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a perfect approval rating of based on 95 reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Arguably Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s masterpiece, &quot;The Seven Samurai&quot; is an epic adventure classic with an engrossing story, memorable characters, and stunning action sequences that make it one of the most influential films ever made&quot;. It currently ranks 18th on their action/adventure voting list, and third on their top 100 art house and international films. On Metacritic, it received a 98 out of 100 based on 7 critic reviews. On Sensacine, the film received a 4.3 out of 5 based on 3 critic reviews.

Upon its initial US release as &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, film critic Wanda Hale reviewed the film in &quot;New York Daily News&quot; and rated it four stars. She noted it was very different from Kurosawa&#x27;s previous film &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1950) in that it was &quot;an action picture&quot; but Kurosawa &quot;has exceeded himself&quot;. She praised Kurosawa&#x27;s storytelling for &quot;his deep perception of human nature&quot; and &quot;awareness that no two people are alike,&quot; his &quot;sensitive, knowing direction&quot; that &quot;never lets audiences lose interest&quot; in the plot, his talent for making the battle scenes and violent action &quot;terrifically exciting to audiences&quot; and his ability to naturally weave humor and romance between the serious action. She praised the &quot;inspired performances&quot; of the cast, including Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune, among other actors.

Many critics outside of Japan have compared the film to westerns. Bosley Crowther, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, compared it to &quot;High Noon&quot; Film historian Peter Cowie quoted Kurosawa as saying, &quot;Good westerns are liked by everyone. Since humans are weak, they want to see good people and great heroes. Westerns have been done over and over again, and in the process, a kind of grammar has evolved. I have learned from this grammar of the western.&quot; Cowie continues this thought by saying, &quot;That &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; can be so seamlessly transposed to an American setting underlines how carefully Kurosawa had assimilated this grammar.&quot;

In 1982, it was voted third in the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll of greatest films. In the 2002 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll the film was ranked 11th. In the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; directors&#x27; poll, it was voted 10th in 1992 and number nine in 2002. It ranked 17th on the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll, in both cases being tied with Kurosawa&#x27;s own &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1950). It ranked 17th in 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; directors&#x27; poll.

In 1998, the film was ranked 5th in &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine&#x27;s Top 100 Films (Centenary). &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; voted it the 12th greatest film of all time in 1999. In 2000, the film was ranked at No.23 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s 100 Greatest Films list. In January 2002, the film was voted at No. 81 on the list of the &quot;Top 100 Essential Films of All Time&quot; by the National Society of Film Critics.

In 2007, the film was ranked at No. 3 by &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s readers&#x27; poll on its list of &quot;40 greatest foreign films of all time&quot;. The film was voted at No. 57 on the list of &quot;100 Greatest Films&quot; by the prominent French magazine &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; in 2008. In 2009 the film was voted at No. 2 on the list of &quot;The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time&quot; by Japanese film magazine &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot;. &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; was ranked number one on &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2010.

Film critic Roger Ebert added it to his list of Great Movies in 2001. Martin Scorsese included it on a list of &quot;39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker.&quot; It was also listed by Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky as one of his top ten favorite films.

Kurosawa both directed and edited many of his films, including &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;. In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; as the 33rd-best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its members. It was voted the greatest foreign-language film of all time in BBC&#x27;s 2018 poll of 209 critics in 43 countries. In 2019, when &quot;Time Out&quot; polled film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors, &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; was voted the second-best action film of all time. In 2021, the film was ranked at number 7 on &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 Best Movies of All Time&quot;.

===Home media===
As of 2017, &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; is the best-selling home video title ever released by the British Film Institute.

==Legacy and cultural impact==
&quot;Seven Samurai&quot; was a technical and creative watershed that became Japan&#x27;s highest-grossing movie and set a new standard for the industry. It has remained highly influential, often seen as one of the most &quot;remade, reworked, referenced&quot; films in cinema.

There have been pachinko machines based on &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; in Japan. &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; pachinko machines have sold 94,000 units in Japan , equivalent to an estimated in gross revenue.

=== Remakes ===
Its influence can be most strongly felt in the Western &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (1960), a film specifically adapted from &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;. Director John Sturges took &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; and adapted it to the Old West, with the samurai replaced by gunslingers. Many of &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;″s scenes mirror those of &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;. The film&#x27;s title itself comes from the US localized title of &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, which was initially released under the title &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; in the United States in 1955. However, in an interview with R. B. Gadi, Kurosawa expressed how &quot;the American copy of &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; is a disappointment, although entertaining. It is not a version of &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;&quot;. Stephen Prince argues that considering samurai films and Westerns respond to different cultures and contexts, what Kurosawa found useful was not their content but rather he was inspired by their levels of syntactic movement, framing, form and grammar.

&quot;The Invincible Six&quot; (1970), an American action film directed by Jean Negulesco, has been described as &quot;a knockoff of the &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;/&quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; genre set in 1960s Iran.&quot;

&quot;Battle Beyond the Stars&quot; (1980) is an American science fiction film directed by Jimmy T. Murakami and produced by Roger Corman. The film, intended as a &quot;&quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; in outer space&quot;, is based on the plots of &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; and &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;. The movie acknowledges its debt to &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; by calling the protagonist&#x27;s homeworld &quot;Akir&quot; and its inhabitants the &quot;Akira&quot;.

Some film critics have noted similarities between Pixar&#x27;s &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; (1998) and &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;.

Several elements from &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; are also argued to have been adapted for &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977). Plot elements of &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; are also used in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Anthology film &quot;Rogue One&quot; (2016). The &quot;Clone Wars&quot; episode &quot;Bounty Hunters&quot; (2008) pays direct homage to Akira Kurosawa by adapting the film&#x27;s plot, as does &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; episode &quot;Chapter 4: Sanctuary&quot; (2019).

Director Zack Snyder credited &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; as being an inspiration for his 2023 space opera film &quot;Rebel Moon&quot;, which shares the plot element of villagers assembling a team of warriors to defend their farming settlement. Snyder has described the movie as &quot;Seven Samurai in space.&quot;

&quot;Marauders&quot;, the sixth episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; (2002), is based on &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;.

===Cultural impact===
&quot;Seven Samurai&quot; is largely touted as what made the &quot;assembling the team&quot; trope popular in movies and other media. This has since become a common trope in many action movies and heist films. &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; spawned its own subgenre of &quot;men-on-a-mission&quot; films, also known as the &quot;&quot;Seven Samurai&quot; formula&quot; where &quot;a team of disparate characters are grouped to undertake a specific mission.&quot; The formula has been widely adopted by many films and other media. Along with remakes already listed above, other examples of the &quot;&quot;Seven Samurai&quot; formula&quot; can be seen in films such as &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998), &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; (1967), &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), &quot;The Savage Seven&quot; (1968), &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot; (1999), &quot;The Expendables&quot;, and &quot;Avengers&quot;, as well as television series such as &quot;The A-Team&quot; and &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;.

According to Stephen Prince, the film&#x27;s &quot;racing, powerful narrative engine, breathtaking pacing, and sense-assaulting visual style&quot; (what he calls a &quot;kinesthetic cinema&quot; approach to &quot;action filmmaking and exciting visual design&quot;) was &quot;the clearest precursor&quot; and became &quot;the model for&quot; the Hollywood blockbuster &quot;brand of moviemaking&quot; that emerged in the 1970s. The visuals, plot, dialogue and film techniques of &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; inspired a wide range of filmmakers, ranging from Steven Spielberg and George Lucas to Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino. According to Prince, Kurosawa was &quot;a mentor figure&quot; to an emerging generation of American filmmakers, such as Spielberg and Lucas, who went on to develop the Hollywood blockbuster format in the 1970s.

Elements from &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; have been borrowed by many films. Examples include plot elements in films such as &quot;Three Amigos&quot; (1986) by John Landis, borrowed scenes in George Miller&#x27;s &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; (2015), and various elements (including visual elements and the way the action, suspense and movement are presented) in the large-scale battle scenes of films such as &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; (2002), &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; (2003) and numerous Marvel Studios films. The opening action scene (where the hero is introduced in an action scenario unrelated to the rest of the plot) later seen in many action films (such as the pre-title scenes in &quot;James Bond&quot; films) has origins in &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, whose first action scene has Kambei posing as a monk to save a boy from a kidnapper. A visual element from &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; that has inspired a number of films is the use of rain to set the tone for action scenes; examples of this include &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;, and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;. &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;&#x27;s film editing technique of cutting on motion and the mentor–student dynamics in the plot (also seen in other Kurosawa films) have also been widely adopted by Hollywood blockbusters (such as Marvel films).

&quot;Sholay&quot; (1975), a &quot;Curry Western&quot; Indian film written by Salim–Javed (Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar) and directed by Ramesh Sippy, has a plot that was loosely styled after &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;. &quot;Sholay&quot; became the most commercially successful Indian film and revolutionized Hindi cinema. Later Indian films inspired by &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; include Mani Ratnam&#x27;s &quot;Thalapathi&quot; (1991) and the Hindi film &quot;China Gate&quot; (1998).

Director Zack Snyder said, &quot;Bruce [Wayne] is having to go out and sort of &#x27;Seven Samurai&#x27; the Justice League together” in the 2021 film &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot;. According to Bryan Young of &quot;Syfy Wire&quot;, the Marvel Cinematic Universe films &quot;The Avengers&quot; (2012) and &quot;&quot; (2018) also owe &quot;a great debt to&quot; &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, noting a number of similar plot and visual elements. Other examples of films that reference &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; include the Australian science fiction film &quot;Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior&quot; (1981), the American comedy film &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; (1999), and the 2016 remake of &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;.

American author Helen DeWitt&#x27;s debut novel &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; heavily features &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; as the title is a reference to the movie and characters within the novel watch and respond to the movie throughout the book.

<text>Theodosius Grigorievich Dobzhansky (; ; January 25, 1900 – December 18, 1975) was an American geneticist and evolutionary biologist. He was a central figure in the field of evolutionary biology for his work in shaping the modern synthesis and also popular for his support and promotion of theistic evolution as a practicing Christian. Born in the Russian Empire, Dobzhansky immigrated to the United States in 1927, aged 27.

His 1937 work &quot;Genetics and the Origin of Species&quot; became a major influence on the modern synthesis. He was awarded the U.S. National Medal of Science in 1964 and the Franklin Medal in 1973.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Dobzhansky was born on January 25, 1900, in Nemirov, Russian Empire (now Nemyriv, Ukraine), the only child of Grigory Dobzhansky, a mathematics teacher, and Sophia Voinarsky. He was given an unusual name, Theodosius, because he was born after his middle-aged parents prayed for a child to St. Theodosius of Chernigov. In 1910 the family moved to Kiev.

At high school, Dobzhansky collected butterflies and decided to become a biologist. In 1915, he met Victor Luchnik who convinced him to specialize in beetles instead. Dobzhansky attended the University of Kiev, where he then studied until 1924 specializing in entomology. He then moved to Leningrad (today St. Petersburg) to study under Yuri Filipchenko, where a &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; laboratory had been established.

On August 8, 1924, Dobzhansky married geneticist Natalia &quot;Natasha&quot; Sivertzeva, who was working with Ivan Schmalhausen in Kiev. The Dobzhanskys had one daughter, known under her married name as Sophie Coe, an anthropologist, food historian, and author, primarily known for her work on the history of chocolate.

Before immigrating to the United States, Dobzhansky published 35 scientific works on entomology and genetics.

===America===
Dobzhansky immigrated to the United States in 1927 on a work–study scholarship from the International Education Board of the Rockefeller Foundation. Upon arriving in New York City on December 27, he joined the &quot;Drosophila&quot; Group at Columbia University working alongside Thomas Hunt Morgan and Alfred Sturtevant. Their work provided crucial information on Drosophila cytogenetics. Additionally, Dobzhansky and his team helped establish &quot;Drosophila pseudoobscura&quot;, within the genus &quot;Drosophila&quot;, as a favorable model organism in evolutionary-biological studies ever since they published their influential works. Dobzhansky&#x27;s original mindset (after studying alongside Yuri Filipchenko), was that there were serious doubts on using data obtained from phenomena happening in local populations (microevolution) and phenomena happening on a global scale (macroevolution). Filipchenko also believed that there were only two types of inheritance: Mendelian inheritance of variation within species, and Non-Mendelian inheritance of variation in a macroevolutionary sense. Dobzhansky later stated that Filipchenko &quot;bet on the wrong horse&quot;.

He followed Morgan to the California Institute of Technology from 1930 to 1940. On the basis of his experiments, he articulated the idea that reproductive isolation can be caused by differences in presence of microbial symbionts between populations. In 1937, he published one of the major works of the modern evolutionary synthesis, the synthesis of evolutionary biology with genetics, titled &quot;Genetics and the Origin of Species&quot;, which amongst other things, defined evolution as &quot;a change in the frequency of an allele within a gene pool&quot;. Dobzhansky&#x27;s work was instrumental in spreading the idea that it is through mutations in genes that natural selection takes place. Also in 1937, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. During this time, he had a very public falling out with one of his &quot;Drosophila&quot; collaborators, Alfred Sturtevant, based primarily in professional competition.

He returned to Columbia University from 1940 to 1962. Among his students was geneticist Bruce Wallace. In 1941, Dobzhansky was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences, of which he was also a member. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1942. In 1943, the University of São Paulo awarded him an honorary doctorate. He was one of the signatories of the 1950 UNESCO statement &quot;The Race Question&quot;. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1953. He then moved to the Rockefeller Institute (shortly to become Rockefeller University) until his retirement in 1971. In 1972 he was elected the founding president of the Behavior Genetics Association, and was recognized by the society for his role in behavior genetics, and the founding of the society by the creation of the Dobzhansky Award (for a lifetime of outstanding scholarship in behavior genetics).

Dobzhansky&#x27;s work in the field of evolutionary genetics, with the help of Sewall Wright, integrated standards of the theoretical, natural historical, and experimental work.

Dobzhansky was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1965. In 1970, he published &quot;Genetics of the evolutionary process&quot;.

Dobzhansky was renowned as the president of the Genetics Society of America in 1941, president of the American Society of Naturalists in 1950, president of the Society for the Study of Evolution in 1951, president of the American Society of Zoologists in 1963, a member of the board of directors of the American Eugenics Society in 1964, and president of the American Teilhard de Chardin Association in 1969.

Dobzhansky&#x27;s research and studies allowed him to travel the world and receive honorary degrees in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, England, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Sweden.

=== &quot;Genetics and the Origin of Species&quot; ===
Theodosius Dobzhansky published three editions of his book &quot;Genetics and the Origin of Species&quot;. Although the book was meant for people with a background in biology, it was easily understood. In the fields of genetics and evolution, Dobzhansky&#x27;s book is acknowledged as one of the most important books ever written. With each revision of &quot;Genetics and the Origin of Species&quot;, Dobzhansky added new material on crucial, up to date topics, and removed material he deemed to be no longer crucial. His book sparked trends in genetic research and theory.

The first edition of &quot;Genetics and the Origin of Species&quot; (1937) highlighted the most recent discoveries in genetics and how they applied to the concept of evolution. The book starts by addressing the problem of evolution and how modern discoveries in genetics could help find a solution. The book covers the chromosomal basis of Mendelian Inheritance, how the effects from changes in chromosomes greater than gene mutations are common and acceptable, and how mutations form racial and specific differences. Dobzhansky explained how three levels could describe the processes of evolutionary population genetics: (1) the origin of raw materials by mutations of genes and chromosomes, (2) the changes in populations by changes in frequencies and combinations of mutations, (3) the fixation of changes by reproductive isolation. To support his writing and research, the bibliography was twenty-eight pages long with around six hundred sources.

In Dobzhansky&#x27;s second edition of &quot;Genetics and the Origin of Species&quot; (1941), four years had gone by and he was able to add more research and advancements made in genetics. Around half of the new research he found was added to the last two chapters in his book: Patterns of Evolution, and Species as Natural Units. In the second to last chapter, Patterns of Evolution, Dobzhansky explained how on the path to a new adaptation, a method could be used to where a species could go through a less adaptive stage. The last chapter, Species as Natural Units, Dobzhansky explained some of the contributions made in genetics to what was called &quot;the new systematics&quot;. Dobzhansky&#x27;s second edition of the book also had twice as many sources in the bibliography than the first edition.

In the third revision of &quot;Genetics and the Origin of Species&quot; (1951), Dobzhansky rewrote all ten chapters on: Isolating Mechanisms, Mutation in Populations, Organic Diversity, Heredity and Mutation, Race Formation, Selection, Adaptive Polymorphism, Hybrid Sterility, Species as Natural Units, and Patterns of Evolution. Dobzhansky decided to remove the chapter on Polyploidy in the third edition. The new chapter on Adaptive Polymorphism highlighted Dobzhansky&#x27;s research since the second edition. He included precise, quantitative evidence on effective natural selection in laboratory and free populations.

=== Debate about race ===
Theodosius Dobzhansky and Ashley Montagu debated the use and validity of the term &quot;race&quot; over a period of many years without reaching an agreement. Montagu argued that &quot;race&quot; was so laden with toxic associations that it was a word best eliminated from science completely. Dobzhansky argued that science should not give in to the misuses to which it had been subjected, and that the concept of animal and plant races has been important in biology; the modern synthesis used the concept for describing the diverging biological populations differing in gene frequencies. This was done in hopes that its foundation in population genetics would undermine the deeply ingrained social prejudices associated with &quot;race&quot;.

His concern with the interface between humans and biology may have come from different factors. The main factor would be the race prejudice that contributed in Europe that triggered WWII. His concern also dealt with religion in human life which he speaks about in his book &quot;The Biology of Ultimate Concern&quot; in 1967. &quot;The pervasiveness of genetic variation provides the biological foundation of human individuality&quot;. Dobzhansky talks about in great detail that &quot;human nature has 2 dimensions: the biological, which mankind shares with the rest of life, and the cultural, which is exclusive to humans.&quot; Both of these are believed to have come from &quot;biological evolution and cultural evolution&quot;.

Dobzhansky sought to put an end to the pseudoscience that purports genetic makeup to determine race, and thus rank in society. Harrison E. Salisbury wrote in a New York Times review of Dobzhansky&#x27;s book &quot;Heredity and the Future of Man&quot; that Dobzhansky could not, together with other scientists, agree upon what defines a race. Dobzhansky stated that a true bloodline for man could not be identified. He did not believe that a person&#x27;s genetic makeup decided whether or not he would be a great man but rather that man &quot;has the rare opportunity &#x27;to direct his evolution&#x27;&quot;.

===Final illness and the &quot;Light of Evolution&quot;===
Dobzhansky&#x27;s wife Natasha died of coronary thrombosis on February 22, 1969. Earlier (on June 1, 1968), Theodosius had been diagnosed with lymphocytic leukemia (a chronic form of leukemia), and had been given a few months to a few years to live. He retired in 1971, moving to the University of California, Davis where his student Francisco J. Ayala had been made assistant professor, and where he continued working as an emeritus professor. He published one of his most famous essays &quot;Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution&quot; in 1973, influenced by the paleontologist and priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.

By 1975, his leukemia had become more severe, and on November 11 he traveled to San Jacinto, California, for treatment and care. Working until his last day as a professor of genetics, Dobzhansky died (from heart failure) on December 18, 1975, in Davis, California. He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered in the Californian wilderness.

===Evolution and God===
Theodosius Dobzhansky believed that God and science can be reconciled through the idea that the Creator brought about his plan through the processes of evolution. He described his beliefs as &quot;Evolution is God&#x27;s, or Nature&#x27;s, method of Creation.&quot;

===Recensions===
* Dobzhansky, Th. Wrote a recension of &quot;The origin of races&quot; by the anthropologist Carleton S. Coon. Dobzhansky rejected Coon&#x27;s theory of independent origin of identical mutations, but he did agree that selection favored a sapiens-like genotype in all proto-human populations, and expressed the theory that all sapiens-alleles existed at a low frequency in all erectus-populations, and that the statistical composition of the gene pool shifted from erectus to sapiens in multiple populations independently.

<text>A tor, which is also known by geomorphologists as either a castle koppie or kopje, is a large, free-standing rock outcrop that rises abruptly from the surrounding smooth and gentle slopes of a rounded hill summit or ridge crest. In the South West of England, the term is commonly also used for the hills themselves – particularly the high points of Dartmoor in Devon and Bodmin Moor in Cornwall.

==Etymology==
Although English topographical names often have a Celtic etymology, the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; lists no cognates to the Old English word in either the Breton or Cornish languages (the Scottish Gaelic is thought to derive from the Old English word). It is therefore accepted that the English word &quot;Tor&quot; derives from the Old Welsh word or , meaning a cluster or heap.

==Formation==

Tors are landforms created by the erosion and weathering of rock; most commonly granites, but also schists, dacites, dolerites, ignimbrites, coarse sandstones and others. Tors are mostly less than high. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain their origin and this remains a topic of discussion among geologists and geomorphologists, and physical geographers. It is considered likely that tors were created by geomorphic processes that differed widely in type and duration according to regional and local differences in climate and rock types.

For example, the Dartmoor granite was emplaced around 280 million years ago. When the cover rocks eroded away it was exposed to chemical and physical weathering processes. Where joints are closely spaced, the large crystals in the granite readily disintegrate to form a sandy regolith known locally as &quot;growan&quot;. This is readily stripped off by solifluction or surface wash when not protected by vegetation, notably during prolonged cold phases during the Quaternary ice ages – periglaciation.

Where joints happen to be unusually widely spaced, core blocks can survive and remain above the weathering surface, developing into tors. These can be monolithic, as at Haytor and Blackingstone Rock, but are more usually subdivided into stacks, often arranged in avenues. Each stack may include several tiers or &quot;pillows&quot;, which may become separated: rocking pillows are called logan stones. These stacks are vulnerable to frost action and often collapse leaving trails of blocks down the slopes called &quot;clitter&quot; or &quot;clatter&quot;. Weathering has also given rise to circular &quot;rock basins&quot; formed by the accumulation of water and repeated freezing and thawing. An example is found at Kes Tor on Dartmoor.

Dating of 28 tors on Dartmoor showed that most are surprisingly young, less than 100,000 years of surface exposure, with none over 200,000 years old. They probably emerged at the start of the last major ice age (Devensian). By contrast the Scottish Cairngorms, which is the other classic granite tor concentration in Britain, the oldest tors dated are between 200 and 675 thousand years of exposure, with even glacially-modified ones having dates of 100–150,000 years.

<text>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, sometimes shortened to Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, is a six-volume work by the English historian Edward Gibbon. The six volumes cover, from 98 to 1590, the peak of the Roman Empire, the history of early Christianity and its emergence as the Roman state religion, the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, the rise of Genghis Khan and Tamerlane and the fall of Byzantium, as well as discussions on the ruins of Ancient Rome.

Volume I was published in 1776 and went through six printings. Volumes II and III were published in 1781; volumes IV, V, and VI in 1788–1789. The original volumes were published in quarto sections, a common publishing practice of the time.

== Conception and writing ==

Gibbon&#x27;s initial plan was to write a history &quot;&quot;of the decline and fall of the &quot;city&quot; of Rome&quot;&quot;, and only later expanded his scope to the whole Roman Empire.

Although he published other books, Gibbon devoted much of his life to this one work (1772–1789). His autobiography &quot;Memoirs of My Life and Writings&quot; is devoted largely to his reflections on how the book virtually &quot;became&quot; his life. He compared the publication of each succeeding volume to a newborn child.

As for sources more recent than the ancients, Gibbon drew on Montesquieu&#x27;s &quot;Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline&quot; (1734), Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Essay on Universal History&quot; (1756), and Bossuet&#x27;s &quot;Discourse on Universal History&quot; (1681).

== Contents ==
== Thesis ==

Gibbon offers an explanation for the fall of the Roman Empire, a task made difficult by a lack of comprehensive written sources.

According to Gibbon, the Roman Empire succumbed to barbarian invasions in large part due to the gradual loss of civic virtue among its citizens. 
He began an ongoing controversy about the role of Christianity, but he gave great weight to other causes of internal decline and to attacks from outside the Empire.

Like other Enlightenment thinkers and British citizens of the age steeped in institutional anti-Catholicism, Gibbon held in contempt the Middle Ages as a priest-ridden, superstitious Dark Age. It was not until his own era, the &quot;Age of Reason&quot;, with its emphasis on rational thought, he believed, that human history could resume its progress.

== Style ==
Gibbon&#x27;s tone was detached, dispassionate, and yet critical. He was noted as occasionally lapsing into moralisation and aphorism.

==Editions==
Gibbon continued to revise and change his work even after publication. The complexities of the problem are addressed in Womersley&#x27;s introduction and appendices to his complete edition.

==Criticism==
Numerous tracts were published criticising his work. In response, Gibbon defended his work with the 1779 publication of &quot;A Vindication ... of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;. 

Gibbon&#x27;s central thesis in his explanation of how the Roman Empire fell, that it was due to embracing Christianity, is not widely accepted by scholars today. Gibbon argued that with the empire&#x27;s new Christian character, large sums of wealth that would have otherwise been used in secular affairs in promoting the state were transferred to promoting the activities of the Church. However, the pre-Christian empire also spent large financial sums on religion and it is unclear whether or not the change of religion increased the amount of resources the empire spent on it. Gibbon further argued that new attitudes in Christianity caused many Christians of wealth to renounce their lifestyles and enter a monastic lifestyle, and so stop participating in the support of the empire. However, while many Christians of wealth did become monastics, this paled in comparison to the participants in the imperial bureaucracy. Although Gibbon further pointed out that the importance Christianity placed on peace caused a decline in the number of people serving the military, the decline was so small as to be negligible for the army&#x27;s overall effectiveness.

John Julius Norwich, despite his admiration for Gibbon&#x27;s furthering of historical methodology, considered his hostile views on the Byzantine Empire flawed, and blamed him somewhat for the lack of interest shown in the subject throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. Gibbon prefaced subsequent editions to note that discussion of Byzantium was not his interest in writing the book. However, the Yugoslavian historian George Ostrogorsky wrote, &quot;Gibbon and Lebeau were genuine historians – and Gibbon a very great one – and their works, in spite of factual inadequacy, rank high for their presentation of their material.&quot;

Gibbon challenged Church history by estimating far smaller numbers of Christian martyrs than had been traditionally accepted. The Church&#x27;s version of its early history had rarely been questioned before. Gibbon, however, said that modern Church writings were secondary sources, and he shunned them in favour of primary sources.

Historian S. P. Foster says that Gibbon &quot;blamed the otherworldly preoccupations of Christianity for the decline of the Roman empire, heaped scorn and abuse on the church, and sneered at the entirety of monasticism as a dreary, superstition-ridden enterprise&quot;.

Gibbon&#x27;s work was originally published in sections, as was common for large works at the time. The first two volumes were well-received and widely praised, but with the publication of volume 3, Gibbon was attacked by some as a &quot;paganist&quot; because he argued that Christianity (or at least the abuse of it by some of the clergy and its followers) had hastened the fall of the Roman Empire.

Voltaire was deemed to have influenced Gibbon&#x27;s claim that Christianity was a contributor to the fall of the Roman Empire.

Gibbon has been criticized for his portrayal of Paganism as tolerant and Christianity as intolerant.

== Legacy ==
Many writers have used variations on the series title (including using &quot;Rise and Fall&quot; in place of &quot;Decline and Fall&quot;), especially when dealing with a large polity that has imperial characteristics. Notable examples include Jefferson Davis&#x27; &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government&quot;, William Shirer&#x27;s &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot;, and David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot;. 

The title and author have also been referenced in poems such as Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;I Went to a Marvellous Party&quot; (&quot;If you have any mind at all, / Gibbon&#x27;s divine &quot;Decline and Fall&quot;, / Seems pretty flimsy, / No more than a whimsy...&quot;) and Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;The Foundation of S.F. Success&quot;, in which Asimov admits his &quot;Foundation&quot; series (about the fall and rebuilding of a galactic empire) was written &quot;with a tiny bit of cribbin&#x27; / from the works of Edward Gibbon&quot;.

Piers Brendon, who wrote &quot;The Decline and Fall of the British Empire, 1781–1997&quot;, claimed that Gibbon&#x27;s work &quot;became the essential guide for Britons anxious to plot their own imperial trajectory. They found the key to understanding the British Empire in the ruins of Rome.&quot;

In 1995, an established journal of classical scholarship, &quot;Classics Ireland&quot;, published punk musician Iggy Pop&#x27;s reflections on the applicability of &quot;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; to the modern world in a short article, &quot;Caesar Lives&quot;, (vol. 2, 1995) in which he asserted:America is Rome. Of course, why shouldn&#x27;t it be? We are all Roman children, for better or worse ... I learn much about the way our society really works, because the system-origins – military, religious, political, colonial, agricultural, financial – are all there to be scrutinised in their infancy. I have gained perspective.

<text>&#x27; (The Ring of the Nibelung), WWV 86, is a cycle of four German-language epic music dramas composed by Richard Wagner. The works are based loosely on characters from Germanic heroic legend, namely Norse legendary sagas and the . The composer termed the cycle a &quot;&quot; (stage festival play), structured in three days preceded by a (&quot;preliminary evening&quot;). It is often referred to as the Ring&quot; cycle,Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring, or simply The Ring&quot;&quot;&#x27;.

Wagner wrote the libretto and music over the course of about twenty-six years, from 1848 to 1874. The four parts that constitute the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle are, in sequence:
* &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; (&quot;The Rhinegold&quot;)
* &quot;Die Walküre&quot; (&quot;The Valkyrie&quot;)
* &quot;Siegfried&quot;
* &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; (&quot;Twilight of the Gods&quot;)
Individual works of the sequence are often performed separately, and indeed the operas contain dialogues that mention events in the previous operas, so that a viewer could watch any of them without having watched the previous parts and still understand the plot. However, Wagner intended them to be performed in series. The first performance as a cycle opened the first Bayreuth Festival in 1876, beginning with &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; on 13 August and ending with &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; on 17 August. Opera stage director Anthony Freud stated that &quot;marks the high-water mark of our art form, the most massive challenge any opera company can undertake.&quot;

==Title==
Wagner&#x27;s title is most literally rendered in English as &quot;The Ring of the Nibelung&quot;. The Nibelung of the title is the dwarf Alberich, and the ring in question is the one he fashions from the Rhinegold. The title therefore denotes &quot;Alberich&#x27;s Ring&quot;.

==Content==
The cycle is a work of extraordinary scale. A full performance of the cycle takes place over four nights at the opera, with a total playing time of about 15 hours, depending on the conductor&#x27;s pacing. The first and shortest work, &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, has no interval and is one continuous piece of music typically lasting around two and a half hours, while the final and longest, &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;, takes up to five hours, excluding intervals. The cycle is modelled after ancient Greek dramas that were presented as three tragedies and one satyr play. The &quot;Ring&quot; proper begins with &quot;Die Walküre&quot; and ends with &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;, with &quot;Rheingold&quot; as a prelude. Wagner called &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; a &quot;Vorabend&quot; or &quot;Preliminary Evening&quot;, and &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, &quot;Siegfried&quot; and &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; were subtitled First Day, Second Day and Third Day, respectively, of the trilogy proper.

The scale and scope of the story is epic. It follows the struggles of gods, heroes, and several mythical creatures over the eponymous magic ring that grants domination over the entire world. The drama and intrigue continue through three generations of protagonists, until the final cataclysm at the end of &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;.

The music of the cycle is thick and richly textured, and grows in complexity as the cycle proceeds. Wagner wrote for an orchestra of gargantuan proportions, including a greatly enlarged brass section with new instruments such as the Wagner tuba, bass trumpet and contrabass trombone. Remarkably, he uses a chorus only relatively briefly, in acts 2 and 3 of &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;, and then mostly of men with just a few women. He eventually had a purpose-built theatre constructed, the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, in which to perform this work. The theatre has a special stage that blends the huge orchestra with the singers&#x27; voices, allowing them to sing at a natural volume. The result was that the singers did not have to strain themselves vocally during the long performances.

== Story ==

The plot revolves around a magic ring that grants the power to rule the world, forged by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich from gold he stole from the Rhine maidens in the river Rhine. With the assistance of the god Loge, Wotan – the chief of the gods – steals the ring from Alberich, but is forced to hand it over to the giants Fafner and Fasolt in payment for building the home of the gods, Valhalla, or they will take Freia, who provides the gods with the golden apples that keep them young. Wotan&#x27;s schemes to regain the ring, spanning generations, drive much of the action in the story. His grandson, the mortal Siegfried, wins the ring by slaying Fafner (who slew Fasolt for the ring) – as Wotan intended – but is eventually betrayed and slain as a result of the intrigues of Alberich&#x27;s son Hagen, who wants the ring for himself. Finally, the Valkyrie Brünnhilde – Siegfried&#x27;s lover and Wotan&#x27;s daughter who lost her immortality for defying her father in an attempt to save Siegfried&#x27;s father Sigmund – returns the ring to the Rhine maidens as she commits suicide on Siegfried&#x27;s funeral pyre. Hagen is drowned as he attempts to recover the ring. In the process, the gods and Valhalla are destroyed.

Wagner created the story of the &quot;Ring&quot; by fusing elements from many German and Scandinavian myths and folk-tales. The Old Norse &quot;Edda&quot; supplied much of the material for &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, while &quot;Die Walküre&quot; was largely based on the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;. &quot;Siegfried&quot; contains elements from the Eddur, the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; and &quot;Thidrekssaga&quot;. The final &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; draws from the 12th-century German poem, the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, which appears to have been the original inspiration for the &quot;Ring&quot;.

&quot;The Ring&quot; has been the subject of myriad interpretations. For example, George Bernard Shaw, in &quot;The Perfect Wagnerite&quot;, argues for a view of &quot;The Ring&quot; as an essentially socialist critique of industrial society and its abuses. Robert Donington in &quot;Wagner&#x27;s Ring And Its Symbols&quot; interprets it in terms of Jungian psychology, as an account of the development of unconscious archetypes in the mind, leading towards individuation.

==Concept==
In his earlier operas (up to and including &quot;Lohengrin&quot;) Wagner&#x27;s style had been based, rather than on the Italian style of opera, on the German style as developed by Carl Maria von Weber, with elements of the grand opera style of Giacomo Meyerbeer. However he came to be dissatisfied with such a format as a means of artistic expression. He expressed this clearly in his essay &quot;A Communication to My Friends&quot; (1851), in which he condemned the majority of modern artists, in painting and in music, as &quot;feminine ... the world of art close fenced from Life, in which Art plays with herself.&#x27; Where however the impressions of Life produce an overwhelming &#x27;poetic force&#x27;, we find the &#x27;masculine, the generative path of Art&#x27;.

Wagner unfortunately found that his audiences were not willing to follow where he led them:

Finally Wagner announces:
This is his first public announcement of the form of what would become the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle.

In accordance with the ideas expressed in his essays of the period 1849–51 (including the &quot;Communication&quot; but also &quot;Opera and Drama&quot; and &quot;The Artwork of the Future&quot;), the four parts of the &quot;Ring&quot; were originally conceived by Wagner to be free of the traditional operatic concepts of aria and operatic chorus. The Wagner scholar Curt von Westernhagen identified three important problems discussed in &quot;Opera and Drama&quot; which were particularly relevant to the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle: the problem of unifying verse stress with melody; the disjunctions caused by formal arias in dramatic structure and the way in which opera music could be organised on a different basis of organic growth and modulation; and the function of musical motifs in linking elements of the plot whose connections might otherwise be inexplicit. This became known as the leitmotif technique (see below), although Wagner himself did not use this word.

However, Wagner relaxed some aspects of his self-imposed restrictions somewhat as the work progressed. As George Bernard Shaw sardonically (and slightly unfairly) noted of the last opera &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;:
==Music==
===Leitmotifs===
As a significant element in the &quot;Ring&quot; and his subsequent works, Wagner adopted the use of leitmotifs, which are recurring themes or harmonic progressions. They musically denote an action, object, emotion, character, or other subject mentioned in the text or presented onstage. Wagner referred to them in &quot;Opera and Drama&quot; as &quot;guides-to-feeling&quot;, describing how they could be used to inform the listener of a musical or dramatic subtext to the action onstage in the same way as a Greek chorus did for the theatre of ancient Greece.

===Instrumentation===
Wagner made significant innovations in orchestration in this work. He wrote for a very large orchestra, using the whole range of instruments used singly or in combination to express the great range of emotion and events of the drama. Wagner even commissioned the production of new instruments, including the Wagner tuba, invented to fill a gap he found between the tone qualities of the horn and the trombone, as well as variations of existing instruments, such as the bass trumpet and a contrabass trombone with a double slide. He also developed the &quot;Wagner bell&quot;, enabling the bassoon to reach the low A-natural, whereas normally B-flat is the instrument&#x27;s lowest note. If such a bell is not to be used, then a contrabassoon should be employed.

All four parts have a very similar instrumentation. The core ensemble of instruments are one piccolo, three flutes (third doubling second piccolo), three oboes, cor anglais (doubling fourth oboe), three soprano clarinets, one bass clarinet, three bassoons; eight horns (fifth through eighth doubling Wagner tubas), three trumpets, one bass trumpet, three tenor trombones, one contrabass trombone (doubling bass trombone), one contrabass tuba; a percussion section with 4 timpani (requiring two players), triangle, cymbals, tam-tam; six harps and a string section consisting of 16 first and 16 second violins, 12 violas, 12 cellos and 8 double basses.

&quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, one offstage harp and 18 offstage anvils. &quot;Die Walküre&quot; requires one snare drum, one D clarinet (played by the third clarinettist) and an on-stage steerhorn. &quot;Siegfried&quot; requires one onstage cor anglais and one onstage horn. &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; requires a tenor drum, as well as five onstage horns and four onstage steerhorns, one of them to be blown by Hagen.

===Tonality===
Much of the &quot;Ring&quot;, especially from &quot;Siegfried&quot; act 3 onwards, cannot be said to be in traditional, clearly defined keys for long stretches, but rather in &#x27;key regions&#x27;, each of which flows smoothly into the following. This fluidity avoided the musical equivalent of clearly defined musical paragraphs and assisted Wagner in building the work&#x27;s huge structures. Tonal indeterminacy was heightened by the increased freedom with which he used dissonance and chromaticism. Chromatically altered chords are used very liberally in the &quot;Ring&quot; and this feature, which is also prominent in &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, is often cited as a milestone on the way to Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s revolutionary break with the traditional concept of key and his dissolution of consonance as the basis of an organising principle in music.

==Composition==
===The text===

In summer 1848 Wagner wrote &quot;The Nibelung Myth as Sketch for a Drama&quot;, combining the medieval sources previously mentioned into a single narrative, very similar to the plot of the eventual &quot;Ring&quot; cycle, but nevertheless with substantial differences. Later that year he began writing a libretto entitled &quot;Siegfrieds Tod&quot; (&quot;Siegfried&#x27;s Death&quot;). He was possibly stimulated by a series of articles in the &quot;Neue Zeitschrift für Musik&quot;, inviting composers to write a &#x27;national opera&#x27; based on the Nibelungenlied, a 12th-century High German poem which, since its rediscovery in 1755, had been hailed by the German Romantics as the &quot;German national epic&quot;. &quot;Siegfrieds Tod&quot; dealt with the death of Siegfried, the central heroic figure of the Nibelungenlied. The idea had occurred to others – the correspondence of Fanny and Felix Mendelssohn in 1840/41 reveals that they were both outlining scenarios on the subject: Fanny wrote &#x27;The hunt with Siegfried&#x27;s death provides a splendid finale to the second act&#x27;.

By 1850, Wagner had completed a musical sketch (which he abandoned) for &quot;Siegfrieds Tod&quot;. He now felt that he needed a preliminary opera, &quot;Der junge Siegfried&quot; (&quot;The Young Siegfried&quot;, later renamed to &quot;Siegfried&quot;), to explain the events in &quot;Siegfrieds Tod&quot; and his verse draft of this was completed in May 1851. By October, he had made the momentous decision to embark on a cycle of four operas, to be played over four nights: &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, &quot;Der Junge Siegfried&quot; and &quot;Siegfrieds Tod&quot;; the text for all four parts was completed in December 1852 and privately published in February 1853.

===The music===

In November 1853, Wagner began the composition draft of &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;. Unlike the verses, which were written as it were in reverse order, the music would be composed in the same order as the narrative. Composition proceeded until 1857, when the final score up to the end of act 2 of &quot;Siegfried&quot; was completed. Wagner then laid the work aside for twelve years, during which he wrote &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; and &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;.

By 1869, Wagner was living at Tribschen on Lake Lucerne, sponsored by King Ludwig II of Bavaria. He returned to &quot;Siegfried&quot; and, remarkably, was able to pick up where he left off. In October, he completed the final work in the cycle. He chose the title &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; instead of &quot;Siegfrieds Tod&quot;. In the completed work the gods are destroyed in accordance with the new pessimistic thrust of the cycle, not redeemed as in the more optimistic originally planned ending. Wagner also decided to show onstage the events of &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; and &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, which had hitherto only been presented as back-narration in the other two parts. These changes resulted in some discrepancies in the cycle, but these do not diminish the value of the work.

==Performances==

===First productions===

On King Ludwig&#x27;s insistence, and over Wagner&#x27;s objections, &quot;special previews&quot; of &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; and &quot;Die Walküre&quot; were given at the National Theatre in Munich, before the rest of the &quot;Ring&quot;. Thus, &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; premiered on 22 September 1869 and &quot;Die Walküre&quot; on 26 June 1870. Wagner subsequently delayed announcing his completion of &quot;Siegfried&quot; to prevent this work also being premiered against his wishes.

Wagner had long desired to have a special festival opera house, designed by himself, for the performance of the &quot;Ring&quot;. In 1871, he decided on a location in the Bavarian town of Bayreuth. In 1872, he moved to Bayreuth and the foundation stone was laid. Wagner would spend the next two years attempting to raise capital for the construction, with scant success; King Ludwig finally rescued the project in 1874 by donating the needed funds. The Bayreuth Festspielhaus opened in 1876 with the first complete performance of the &quot;Ring&quot;, which took place from 13 to 17 August.

In 1882, London impresario Alfred Schulz-Curtius organized the first staging in the United Kingdom of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle, conducted by Anton Seidl and directed by Angelo Neumann.

The first production of the &quot;Ring&quot; in Italy was in Venice (the place where Wagner died), just two months after his 1883 death, at La Fenice.

The first Australian &quot;Ring&quot; (and &quot;The Mastersingers of Nuremberg&quot;) was presented in an English-language production by the British travelling Quinlan Opera Company, in conjunction with J. C. Williamson&#x27;s, in Melbourne and Sydney in 1913.

===Modern productions===
The &quot;Ring&quot; is a major undertaking for any opera company: staging four interlinked operas requires a huge commitment both artistically and financially; hence, in most opera houses, production of a new &quot;Ring&quot; cycle will happen over a number of years, with one or two operas in the cycle being added each year. The Bayreuth Festival, where the complete cycle is performed most years, is unusual in that a new cycle is almost always created within a single year.

Early productions of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle stayed close to Wagner&#x27;s original Bayreuth staging. Trends set at Bayreuth have continued to be influential. Following the closure of the Festspielhaus during the Second World War, the 1950s saw productions by Wagner&#x27;s grandsons Wieland and Wolfgang Wagner (known as the &quot;New Bayreuth&quot; style), which emphasised the human aspects of the drama in a more abstract setting.

Perhaps the most famous modern production was the centennial production of 1976, the &quot;Jahrhundertring&quot;, directed by Patrice Chéreau and conducted by Pierre Boulez. Set in the Industrial Revolution, it replaced the depths of the Rhine with a hydroelectric power dam and featured grimy sets populated by men and gods in 19th and 20th century business suits. This drew heavily on the reading of the &quot;Ring&quot; as a revolutionary drama and critique of the modern world, famously expounded by George Bernard Shaw in &quot;The Perfect Wagnerite&quot;. Early performances were booed but the audience of 1980 gave it a 45-minute ovation in its final year.

Seattle Opera has created three different productions of the tetralogy: &quot;Ring 1&quot;, 1975 to 1984: Originally directed by George London, with designs by John Naccarato following the famous illustrations by Arthur Rackham. It was performed twice each summer, once in German, once in Andrew Porter&#x27;s English adaptation. Henry Holt conducted all performances. &quot;Ring 2&quot;, 1985–1995: Directed by Francois Rochaix, with sets and costumes designed by Robert Israel, lighting by Joan Sullivan and supertitles (the first ever created for the &quot;Ring&quot;) by Sonya Friedman. The production set the action in a world of nineteenth-century theatricality; it was initially controversial in 1985, it sold out its final performances in 1995. Conductors included Armin Jordan (&quot;Die Walküre&quot; in 1985), Manuel Rosenthal (1986) and Hermann Michael (1987, 1991 and 1995). &quot;Ring 3&quot;, 2000–2013: the production, which became known as the &quot;Green&quot; &quot;Ring&quot;, was in part inspired by the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest. Directed by Stephen Wadsworth, set designer Thomas Lynch, costume designer Martin Pakledinaz, lighting designer Peter Kaczorowski; Armin Jordan conducted in 2000, Franz Vote in 2001 and Robert Spano in 2005 and 2009. The 2013 performances, conducted by Asher Fisch, were released as a commercial recording on compact disc and on iTunes.

In 2003 the first production of the cycle in Russia in modern times was conducted by Valery Gergiev at the Mariinsky Opera, Saint Petersburg, designed by George Tsypin. The production drew parallels with Ossetian mythology.

The Royal Danish Opera performed a complete &quot;Ring&quot; cycle in May 2006 in its new waterfront home, the Copenhagen Opera House. This version of the &quot;Ring&quot; tells the story from the viewpoint of Brünnhilde and has a distinct feminist angle. For example, in a key scene in &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, it is Sieglinde and not Siegmund who manages to pull the sword Nothung out of a tree. At the end of the cycle, Brünnhilde does not die, but instead gives birth to Siegfried&#x27;s child.

San Francisco Opera and Washington National Opera began a co-production of a new cycle in 2006 directed by Francesca Zambello. The production uses imagery from various eras of American history and has a feminist and environmentalist viewpoint. Recent performances of this production took place at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C. in April/May 2016, featuring Catherine Foster and Nina Stemme as Brünnhilde, Daniel Brenna as Siegfried and Alan Held as Wotan.

Los Angeles Opera presented its first &quot;Ring&quot; cycle in 2010 directed by Achim Freyer. Freyer staged an abstract production that was praised by many critics but criticized by some of its own stars. The production featured a raked stage, flying props, screen projections and special effects.

The Metropolitan Opera began a new &quot;Ring&quot; cycle directed by French-Canadian theater director Robert Lepage in 2010. Premiering with &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; on opening night of the 2010/2011 Season conducted by James Levine with Bryn Terfel as Wotan. This was followed by &quot;Die Walküre&quot; in April 2011 starring Deborah Voigt. The 2011/12 season introduced &quot;Siegfried&quot; and &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; with Voigt, Terfel and Jay Hunter Morris before the entire cycle was given in the Spring of 2012 conducted by Fabio Luisi (who stepped in for Levine due to health issues). Lepage&#x27;s staging was dominated by a 90,000 pound (40 tonne) structure which consisted of 24 identical aluminium planks able to rotate independently on a horizontal axis across the stage, providing level, sloping, angled or moving surfaces facing the audience. Bubbles, falling stones and fire were projected on to these surfaces, linked by computer with the music and movement of the characters. The subsequent HD recordings in 2013 won the Met&#x27;s orchestra and chorus the Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording for their performance. In 2019, the Metropolitan Opera revived the Lepage staging for the first time since 2013 with Philippe Jordan conducting, Greer Grimsley and Michael Volle rotating as Wotan, and Andreas Schager rotating as Siegfried and Met homegrown Christine Goerke as Brünnhilde. Lepage&#x27;s &quot;Machine&quot;, as it affectionately became known, underwent major reconfiguration for the revival in order to dampen the creaking that it had produced in the past (to the annoyance of audience members and critics) and to improve its reliability, as it had been known to break down during earlier runs including on the opening night of &quot;Rheingold&quot;. Unlike its beloved predecessor directed by Viennese opera director Otto Schenk which played at the house over 22 years, the Met has confirmed that this controversial and expensive production will not return again, having lasted just shy of ten years at the house with only three complete cycles having been given. They announced it would be replaced by a new production in 2025, however though originally in partnership with the English National Opera the future of that partnership is uncertain due to budgetary cuts and poor audience response. Other options are being explored.

The Lyric Opera of Chicago has staged three complete Ring Cycles in the past four decades, with a cycle in the 1990s, the 2000s, and in the late 2010s.

The mid-1990s production by August Everding with choreography by Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s Debra Brown was conducted by Zubin Mehta, with James Morris a Wotan and Eva Marton as Brünnhilde, Siegfried Jerusalem as Siegmund, and Tina Kiberg as Sieglinde.

The 2000s Ring cast included &quot;James Morris as Wotan, Jane Eaglen as Brünnhilde, Plácido Domingo as Siegmund, and Michelle DeYoung as Sieglinde.&quot; Lyric music director Andrew Davis conduct[ed]. The company ... revived the August Everding production that it presented nine years [earlier], restaged by Herbert Kellner with minor changes ... The bungee-jumping Rhinemaidens and the Valkyries on trampolines from the original production, choreographed by Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s Debra Brown ... returned. Sets and costumes [were] by John Conklin; lighting [was] by Duane Schuler.&quot;

The most recent production&#x27;s Das Rheingold premiered in 2016, with subsequent Ring operas Die Walküre, Siegfried, and Götterdämmerung staged between 2017 and 2019. The subsequent &quot;full Ring&quot; performances in the spring of 2020 were cancelled due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and has never been staged at the Lyric as the complete cycle. This production was an &quot;Inviting and imaginative production&quot; that returned the narrative to its theatrical roots that a Chicago Sun-Times reviewer of Das Rheingold called &quot;eye-popping&quot; The new production was &quot;created by Sir David Pountney, with original set designs by ... Johan Engels overseen by Robert Innes Hopkins, costumes designed by Marie-Jeanne Lecca, lighting by Fabrice Kebour, and choreography by Denni Sayers.&quot; The production starred &quot;Christine Goerke as Brünnhilde, Burkhard Fritz as Siegfried, Eric Owens as Wotan and the Wanderer, Samuel Youn as Alberich, Tanja Ariane Baumgartner as Fricka and Waltraute, Elisabet Strid ... and Laura Wilde ... as Sieglinde, Brandon Jovanovich as Froh/Siegmund, Stephen Milling as Hunding/Hagen, Ronnita Miller as Erda/First Norn, Stefan Margita ... and Robert Brubaker ... as Loge, Matthias Klink as Mime, Soloman Howard as Fafner, Henning von Schulman as Fasolt.&quot; Audio for the complete opera Die Walküre is available on YouTube Music, Amazon Music, SoundCloud, Deezer, and Spotify.

Opera Australia presented the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle at the State Theatre in Melbourne, Australia, in November 2013, directed by Neil Armfield and conducted by Pietari Inkinen. &quot;Classical Voice America&quot; heralded the production as &quot;one of the best Rings anywhere in a long time.&quot; The production was presented again in Melbourne from 21 November to 16 December 2016 starring Lise Lindstrom, Stefan Vinke, Amber Wagner and Jacqueline Dark.

It is possible to perform &quot;The Ring&quot; with fewer resources than usual. In 1990, the City of Birmingham Touring Opera (now Birmingham Opera Company), presented a two-evening adaptation (by Jonathan Dove) for a limited number of solo singers, each doubling several roles and 18 orchestral players. This version was subsequently given productions in the USA. A heavily cut-down version (7 hours plus intervals) was performed at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires on 26 November 2012 to mark the 200th anniversary of Wagner&#x27;s birth.

In a different approach, &quot;Der Ring in Minden&quot; staged the cycle on the small stage of the Stadttheater Minden, beginning in 2015 with &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, followed by the other parts in the succeeding years and culminating with the complete cycle performed twice in 2019. The stage director was Gerd Heinz, and Frank Beermann conducted the Nordwestdeutsche Philharmonie, playing at the back of the stage. The singers acted in front of the orchestra, making an intimate approach to the dramatic situations possible. The project received international recognition.

==Recordings of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle==
==Other treatments of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle==
Orchestral versions of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle, summarizing the work in a single movement of an hour or so, have been made by Leopold Stokowski, Lorin Maazel (&quot;Der Ring ohne Worte&quot;) (1988) and Henk de Vlieger (&quot;The Ring: An Orchestral Adventure&quot;), (1991).

English-Canadian comedian and singer Anna Russell recorded a twenty-two-minute version of the &quot;Ring&quot; for her album &quot;Anna Russell Sings! Again?&quot; in 1953, characterized by camp humour and sharp wit.

Produced by the Ridiculous Theatrical Company, Charles Ludlam&#x27;s 1977 play &quot;Der Ring Gott Farblonjet&quot; was a spoof of Wagner&#x27;s operas. The show received a well-reviewed 1990 revival in New York at the Lucille Lortel Theatre.

In 1991, Seattle Opera premiered a musical comedy parody of the Ring Cycle called Das Barbecü, with book and lyrics by Jim Luigs and music by Scott Warrender. It follows the outline of the cycle&#x27;s plot but shifts the setting to Texas ranch country. It was later produced off-broadway and elsewhere around the world.

The German two-part television movie &quot;Dark Kingdom: The Dragon King&quot; (2004, also known as &quot;Ring of the Nibelungs&quot;, &quot;Die Nibelungen&quot;, &quot;Curse of the Ring&quot; and &quot;Sword of Xanten&quot;), is based in some of the same material Richard Wagner used for his music dramas &quot;Siegfried&quot; and &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;.

An adaptation of Wagner&#x27;s storyline was published as a graphic novel in 2018 by P. Craig Russell.

<text>True BASIC is a variant of the BASIC programming language descended from Dartmouth BASIC—the original BASIC. Both were created by college professors John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz.

==History==
True BASIC traces its history to an offshoot of Dartmouth BASIC called Structured BASIC, or SBASIC for short. This was released sometime in 1975 or 1976, but was not installed as the mainline version of BASIC on the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System (DTSS) that supported the campus. Shortly after, Kemeny became involved in an effort to produce an ANSI standard BASIC in an attempt to bring together the many small variations of the language that had developed through the late 1960s and early 1970s. This effort initially focused on a system known as Minimal BASIC that was similar to earliest versions of Dartmouth BASIC, while later work was aimed at a Full BASIC that was essentially SBASIC with various extensions.

By the early 1980s, tens of millions of home computers were running some variation of Microsoft BASIC, which had become the &quot;de facto&quot; standard. The ANSI efforts eventually became pointless, as it became clear that these versions were not going to have any market impact in a world dominated by Microsoft. Both versions were eventually ratified but saw little or no adoption and the standards were later withdrawn. Kemeny and Kurtz, however, decided to continue their efforts to introduce the concepts from SBASIC and the ANSI Standard BASIC efforts. This became True BASIC.

Initially based on Dartmouth BASIC 7, True BASIC was introduced in 1985. There are versions of the True BASIC compiler for MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, and Classic Mac OS. At one time, versions for TRS-80 Color Computer, Amiga and Atari ST computers were offered, as well as a UNIX command-line compiler.

==Features==
Being a structured programming implementation of the language, it dispenses with the need for line numbers and codice_1 statements, although these can still be used.

True BASIC provides statements for matrix arithmetic, a feature that had been present in Dartmouth BASIC since early times, but had been dropped in almost all microcomputer versions of BASIC interpreters. It implements global and local variables which make it possible to write recursive functions and subroutines.

The designers wanted to make the language hardware-independent, so True BASIC source code would run equally well on any version of their compiler. For the most part, they succeed in this endeavor. The drawback for users was that direct access to some features of their machines was not available, but this could be remedied with callable functions and subroutines specially written in assembly language.

Using newer versions of True BASIC, some of the older functions are blocked out. An example of the recent code would be more like this:
RANDOMIZE
SET WINDOW 0,20,0,20
SET COLOR 5 !Set the pen and text colour to 5 as true basic has 0-15 colours
PRINT &quot;Welcome To ...&quot; !Print &quot;Welcome To ...&quot; on the user&#x27;s screen.
DO !Begin the loop
 LET x=rnd*20 !Let the value &#x27;x&#x27; equal a random number between &#x27;0&#x27; and &#x27;20&#x27;
 LET y=rnd*20 !Let the value &#x27;y&#x27; equal a random number between &#x27;0&#x27; and &#x27;20&#x27;
 Pause .1 !Waits 1/10 of a second
 PLOT TEXT, at x, y: &quot;Fabulous Wikipedia!&quot; !Plot &#x27;Fabulous Wikipedia!&#x27; at coordinates &#x27;x&#x27; and &#x27;y&#x27;
LOOP !End the loop
END !End the program
This simple program plots the text &quot;Welcome To ...&quot; at the top left-hand corner of the screen, and then continues into a never-ending loop plotting &quot;Fabulous Wikipedia!&quot; at random coordinates.

An example of simple animation could be like this:
!Draw the Car
SET WINDOW 0,20,0,20
SET COLOR 5
BOX AREA 2,6,2,3
BOX AREA 9,13,2,3
BOX AREA 16,20,2,3
SET COLOR 249
PLOT LINES :0,5;20,5
FLOOD 10,1
BOX KEEP 0,20,0,5 IN road$
BOX CIRCLE 2,3,5,6
FLOOD 2.5,5.5
BOX CIRCLE 5,6,5,6
FLOOD 5.5,5.5
SET COLOR 35
PLOT LINES :2.5,6;5.5,6
PLOT LINES :5,6;8,6;8,8;6,8;6,10;2,10;2,8;0,8;0,6;3,6
FLOOD 4,8
SET COLOR 248
BOX AREA 4,5,8,9
BOX KEEP 0,8,5,10 IN car$ !Save the car in &#x27;car$&#x27;
FOR x=1 TO 20 STEP 1 !Create a &#x27;for&#x27; loop
 BOX SHOW road$ AT 0,0
 BOX SHOW car$ AT x,5 
 PAUSE .1
 CLEAR
NEXT x !End the &#x27;for&#x27; loop
END !End the programs
==Reception==
Jerry Pournelle in 1985 asked, &quot;why do we need True BASIC at all? [It] doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything regular BASIC doesn&#x27;t do, and what it does do isn&#x27;t attacked in a logical or intuitive manner.&quot; He criticized the lack of output when encountering an error, preventing interactive debugging by &quot;inserting print statements as diagnostics&quot;. Pournelle concluded, &quot;I think I&#x27;ll pass up the opportunity to become a born-again True BASIC believer. I&#x27;ll enjoy my Microsoft and CBASIC heresies.&quot;

Some users have complained about their programs and the editor using up 100% of their CPU (or core). This appears to be caused by the editor and user&#x27;s programs using a loop which constantly polls the keyboard and mouse for events. The problem has been known since at least the end of 2010, yet as of early 2014 is still being worked on.

<doc id="31383" wikidata="Q193135" url="?curid=31383" title="Osmotic pressure">
<text>Osmotic pressure is the minimum pressure which needs to be applied to a solution to prevent the inward flow of its pure solvent across a semipermeable membrane.
It is also defined as the measure of the tendency of a solution to take in its pure solvent by osmosis. Potential osmotic pressure is the maximum osmotic pressure that could develop in a solution if it were separated from its pure solvent by a semipermeable membrane.

Osmosis occurs when two solutions containing different concentrations of solute are separated by a selectively permeable membrane. Solvent molecules pass preferentially through the membrane from the low-concentration solution to the solution with higher solute concentration. The transfer of solvent molecules will continue until equilibrium is attained.
==Theory and measurement==
Jacobus van &#x27;t Hoff found a quantitative relationship between osmotic pressure and solute concentration, expressed in the following equation:
:formula_1
where formula_2 is osmotic pressure, &quot;i&quot; is the dimensionless van &#x27;t Hoff index, &quot;c&quot; is the molar concentration of solute, &quot;R&quot; is the ideal gas constant, and &quot;T&quot; is the absolute temperature (usually in kelvins). This formula applies when the solute concentration is sufficiently low that the solution can be treated as an ideal solution. The proportionality to concentration means that osmotic pressure is a colligative property. Note the similarity of this formula to the ideal gas law in the form formula_3 where is the total number of moles of gas molecules in the volume &quot;V&quot;, and &quot;n&quot;/&quot;V&quot; is the molar concentration of gas molecules. Harmon Northrop Morse and Frazer showed that the equation applied to more concentrated solutions if the unit of concentration was molal rather than molar; so when the molality is used this equation has been called the Morse equation.

For more concentrated solutions the van &#x27;t Hoff equation can be extended as a power series in solute concentration, &quot;c&quot;. To a first approximation,

:formula_4

where formula_5 is the ideal pressure and &quot;A&quot; is an empirical parameter. The value of the parameter &quot;A&quot; (and of parameters from higher-order approximations) can be used to calculate Pitzer parameters. Empirical parameters are used to quantify the behavior of solutions of ionic and non-ionic solutes which are not ideal solutions in the thermodynamic sense.

The Pfeffer cell was developed for the measurement of osmotic pressure.

== Applications ==

Osmotic pressure measurement may be used for the determination of molecular weights.

Osmotic pressure is an important factor affecting biological cells. Osmoregulation is the homeostasis mechanism of an organism to reach balance in osmotic pressure.

*Hypertonicity is the presence of a solution that causes cells to shrink.
*Hypotonicity is the presence of a solution that causes cells to swell.
*Isotonicity is the presence of a solution that produces no change in cell volume.

When a biological cell is in a hypotonic environment, the cell interior accumulates water, water flows across the cell membrane into the cell, causing it to expand. In plant cells, the cell wall restricts the expansion, resulting in pressure on the cell wall from within called turgor pressure. Turgor pressure allows herbaceous plants to stand upright. It is also the determining factor for how plants regulate the aperture of their stomata. In animal cells excessive osmotic pressure can result in cytolysis due to the absence of a cell wall.

Osmotic pressure is the basis of filtering (&quot;reverse osmosis&quot;), a process commonly used in water purification. The water to be purified is placed in a chamber and put under an amount of pressure greater than the osmotic pressure exerted by the water and the solutes dissolved in it. Part of the chamber opens to a differentially permeable membrane that lets water molecules through, but not the solute particles. The osmotic pressure of ocean water is approximately 27 atm. Reverse osmosis desalinates fresh water from ocean salt water and is applied globally on a very large scale.

== Derivation of the van &#x27;t Hoff formula ==
Consider the system at the point when it has reached equilibrium. The condition for this is that the chemical potential of the &quot;solvent&quot; (since only it is free to flow toward equilibrium) on both sides of the membrane is equal. The compartment containing the pure solvent has a chemical potential of formula_6, where formula_7 is the pressure. On the other side, in the compartment containing the solute, the chemical potential of the solvent depends on the mole fraction of the solvent, formula_8. Besides, this compartment can assume a different pressure, formula_9. We can therefore write the chemical potential of the solvent as formula_10. If we write formula_11, the balance of the chemical potential is therefore:

:formula_12

Here, the difference in pressure of the two compartments formula_13 is defined as the osmotic pressure exerted by the solutes. Holding the pressure, the addition of solute decreases the chemical potential (an entropic effect). Thus, the pressure of the solution has to be increased in an effort to compensate the loss of the chemical potential.

In order to find formula_2, the osmotic pressure, we consider equilibrium between a solution containing solute and pure water.
:formula_15

We can write the left hand side as:
:formula_16,
where formula_17 is the activity coefficient of the solvent. The product formula_18 is also known as the activity of the solvent, which for water is the water activity formula_19. The addition to the pressure is expressed through the expression for the energy of expansion:
:formula_20
where formula_21 is the molar volume (m³/mol). Inserting the expression presented above into the chemical potential equation for the entire system and rearranging will arrive at:
:formula_22

If the liquid is incompressible the molar volume is constant, formula_23, and the integral becomes formula_24. Thus, we get
:formula_25

The activity coefficient is a function of concentration and temperature, but in the case of dilute mixtures, it is often very close to 1.0, so
:formula_26

The mole fraction of solute, formula_27, is formula_28, so formula_29 can be replaced with formula_30, which, when formula_27 is small, can be approximated by formula_32.

:formula_33

The mole fraction formula_27 is formula_35. When formula_27 is small, it may be approximated by formula_37. Also, the molar volume formula_21 may be written as volume per mole, formula_39. Combining these gives the following.

:formula_40

For aqueous solutions of salts, ionisation must be taken into account. For example, 1 mole of NaCl ionises to 2 moles of ions.

<text>Technical and further education or simply TAFE () is the common name in Australia for vocational education, as a subset of tertiary education. TAFE institutions provide a wide range of predominantly vocational courses. Colloquially also known as &quot;Tech&quot;. 

Individual TAFE institutions (usually with numerous campuses) are known as either colleges or institutes, depending on the state or territory. 

In Australia, where the term TAFE originated, institutions usually host qualifying courses, under the National Training System/Australian Qualifications Framework/VET Quality Framework. Fields covered include business, finance, hospitality, tourism, construction, engineering, visual arts, information technology and community work. TAFE colleges are owned, operated and financed by the various state/territory governments.

==Qualifications awarded by TAFE colleges==
TAFE colleges award Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) qualifications accredited in the Vocational Education and Training (VET) sector that align to Certificate I, Certificate II, Certificate III, Certificate IV, Diploma, Advanced Diploma, Graduate Certificate and Graduate Diploma qualifications. In many instances, TAFE study at a Diploma or above level can be used as partial credit towards bachelor&#x27;s degree-level university programs.

From 2002 the TAFE education sector has been able to offer bachelor&#x27;s degrees and post-graduate diploma courses to fill niche areas, particularly vocationally focused areas of study based on industry needs. As of June 2009, ten TAFE colleges (mainly in New South Wales and Victoria, but also Western Australia, ACT, and Queensland) now confer their own degree-level awards and post graduate diplomas, though initially not beyond the level of bachelor&#x27;s degree. However Melbourne Polytechnic was accredited in 2015 to offer two master&#x27;s degree courses. Similarly, some universities (e.g., Charles Darwin University and Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) offer vocational education courses (traditionally the domain of TAFE); these are funded by the local state and territory governments. Some high schools also deliver courses developed and accredited by TAFEs.
Students who enrol in these undergraduate degree courses at TAFE are required to pay full fees and are not entitled to Commonwealth Government supported student fee loans, known as HECS loans, but may access a FEE-HELP loan scheme. While Universities have the ability and power to design and offer their own degree courses, each TAFE degree course must be assessed and approved by the Higher Education Accreditation Committee (HEAC).

TAFEs in some states can also teach senior high school qualifications, like the Victorian Certificate of Education, Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning, and the Higher School Certificate. Some universities, e.g. Charles Darwin University and Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, offer TAFE courses; these are funded by the local state and territory governments. Some high schools also deliver courses developed and accredited by TAFEs.

Some private institutions also offer courses from TAFEs, however they more commonly offer other vocational education and training courses. Many Australians refer to all sub-degree courses as &quot;TAFE&quot; courses, no matter what institution creates or delivers the course. Before the 1990s, the TAFEs had a near monopoly in the sector. TAFE courses provide students an opportunity for certificate, diploma, and advanced diploma qualifications in a wide range of areas.

==TAFE colleges by state/territory==

In most cases, TAFE campuses are grouped into TAFE institutions or &quot;institutes&quot; along geographic lines. Most TAFEs are given a locally recognised region of the country where they exclusively operate covering a wide range of subjects.

A few TAFEs specialise in a single area of study. These are usually found near the middle of the capital cities, and they service the whole state or territory. For example, the Trade and Technician Skills Institute in Brisbane, from 1 July 2006, has specialised in automotive, building and construction, manufacturing and engineering, and electrical/electronic studies for students throughout Queensland and the William Angliss Institute of TAFE in Melbourne has specialised in food, hospitality and tourism courses for Victoria.

<doc id="31388" wikidata="Q122371" url="?curid=31388" title="Treaty of Brest-Litovsk">
<text>The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was a separate peace treaty signed on 3 March 1918 between Soviet Russia and the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria), by which Russia withdrew from World War I. The treaty, which followed months of negotiations after the armistice on the Eastern Front in December 1917, was signed at Brest-Litovsk (now Brest, Belarus).

The Soviet delegation was initially headed by Adolph Joffe, and key figures from the Central Powers included Max Hoffmann and Richard von Kühlmann of Germany, Ottokar Czernin of Austria-Hungary, and Talaat Pasha of the Ottoman Empire. In January 1918, the Central Powers demanded secession of all occupied territories of the former Russian Empire. The Soviets sent a new peace delegation led by Leon Trotsky, which aimed to stall the negotiations while awaiting revolutions in Central Europe. A renewed Central Powers offensive launched on February 18 captured large territories in the Baltic region, Belarus, and Ukraine and forced the Soviet side to sue for peace.

Under the terms of the treaty, Russia lost control of Ukraine, Poland, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, and its Caucasus provinces of Kars and Batum. The lands comprised 34% of the former empire&#x27;s population, 54% of its industrial land, 89% of its coalfields, and 26% of its railways. The Soviet government also confirmed the independence of Finland, which it had recognized in January 1918, and pledged to end its war with the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, which the Central Powers had recognized under the prior Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (9 February 1918). A supplementary protocol signed in August 1918 required Russia to pay Germany war reparations of six billion marks. The treaty was controversial in Russia, giving a unifying cause to the White movement and opening a rift between the Bolsheviks and the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, whose representatives withdrew from the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars after its signing and later rebelled in the Left SR Uprising.

The treaty was annulled by the Armistice of 11 November 1918, in which Germany surrendered to the western Allied Powers. Subsequent attempts by the Soviets to restore power in the lost territories during the Russian Civil War (1917–1922) had mixed results, with the Red Army being defeated in the independence wars of the three Baltic countries and in the Polish–Soviet War, but achieving victory in its invasions of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia and in the Ukrainian–Soviet War. The border with Turkey established by the treaty was largely affirmed by the Treaty of Kars (1921). Under the Treaty of Rapallo (1922), Russia and Germany renounced all territorial and financial claims against each other.

The Russian borders established by the treaty bear an almost exact similarity to the post-1991 borders established after the fall of the Soviet Union.

==Background==
By 1917, Germany and Russia were stuck in a stalemate on the Eastern Front of World War I and the Russian economy had nearly collapsed under the strain of the war effort. The large numbers of war casualties and persistent food shortages in the major urban centers brought about civil unrest, known as the February Revolution, that forced Tsar Nicholas II to abdicate. The Russian Provisional Government that replaced the Tsar in early 1917 continued the war. Foreign Minister Pavel Milyukov sent the Entente Powers a telegram, known as the Milyukov note, affirming to them that the Provisional Government would continue the war with the same war aims that the former Russian Empire had. The pro-war Provisional Government was opposed by the self-proclaimed Petrograd Soviet of Workers&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Deputies, dominated by leftist parties. Its Order No. 1 called for an overriding mandate to soldier committees rather than army officers. The Soviet started to form its own paramilitary power, the Red Guards, in March 1917.

The continuing war led the German Government to agree to a suggestion that they should favour the opposition Communist Party (Bolsheviks), who were proponents of Russia&#x27;s withdrawal from the war. Therefore, in April 1917, Germany transported Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin and thirty-one supporters in a sealed train from exile in Switzerland to Finland Station, Petrograd. Upon his arrival in Petrograd, Lenin proclaimed his April Theses, which included a call for turning all political power over to workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; soviets (councils) and an immediate withdrawal of Russia from the war. At around the same time, the United States entered the war, potentially shifting the balance of the war against the Central Powers. Throughout 1917, Bolsheviks called for the overthrow of the Provisional Government and an end to the war. Following the disastrous failure of the Kerensky offensive, discipline in the Russian army deteriorated completely. Soldiers would disobey orders, often under the influence of Bolshevik agitation, and set up soldiers&#x27; committees to take control of their units after deposing the officers.

The defeat and ongoing hardships of war led to anti-government riots in Petrograd, the &quot;July Days&quot; of 1917. Several months later, on 7 November old style), Red Guards seized the Winter Palace and arrested the Provisional Government in what is known as the October Revolution.

A top priority of the newly established Soviet government was to end the war. On 8 November 1917 (26 October 1917 O.S) Vladimir Lenin signed the Decree on Peace, which was approved by the Second Congress of the Soviet of Workers&#x27;, Soldiers&#x27;, and Peasants&#x27; Deputies. The Decree called &quot;upon all the belligerent nations and their governments to start immediate negotiations for peace&quot; and proposed an immediate withdrawal of Russia from . Leon Trotsky was appointed Commissar of Foreign Affairs in the new Bolshevik government. In preparation for peace talks with the representatives of the German government and the representatives of the other Central Powers, Leon Trotsky appointed his good friend Adolph Joffe to represent the Bolsheviks at the peace conference.

==Peace negotiations==

On 15 December 1917, an armistice between Soviet Russia and the Central Powers was concluded. On , peace negotiations began in Brest-Litovsk.

Arrangements for the conference were the responsibility of General Max Hoffmann, the chief of staff of the Central Powers&#x27; forces on the Eastern Front (&quot;Oberkommando-Ostfront, Ober Ost&quot;). The delegations that had negotiated the armistice were made stronger. Prominent additions on the Central Powers&#x27; side were the foreign ministers of Germany, Richard von Kühlmann, and Austria-Hungary, Count Ottokar Czernin, both the Ottoman grand vizier Talaat Pasha and Foreign Minister Nassimy Bey. The Bulgarians were headed by Minister of Justice Popoff, who was later joined by Prime Minister Vasil Radoslavov.

The Soviet delegation was led by Adolph Joffe, who had already led their armistice negotiators, but his group was made more cohesive by eliminating most of the representatives of social groups, like peasants and sailors, and the addition of tsarist general Aleksandr Samoilo and the noted Marxist historian Mikhail Pokrovsky. It still included Anastasia Bitsenko, a former assassin, representing the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries who were at odds with the Bolsheviks. Again, the negotiators met in the fortress in Brest-Litovsk, and the delegates were housed in temporary wooden structures in its courtyards because the city had been burnt to the ground in 1915 by the retreating Russian army. They were cordially welcomed by the German commander of the Eastern Front, Prince Leopold of Bavaria, who sat with Joffe on the head table at the opening banquet with one hundred guests. As they had during the armistice negotiations, both sides continued to eat dinner and supper together amicably intermingled in the officers&#x27; mess.

When the conference convened Kühlmann asked Joffe to present the Russian conditions for peace. He made six points, all variations of the Bolshevik slogan of peace with &quot;no annexations or indemnities&quot;. The Central Powers accepted the principles &quot;but only in case all belligerents [including the nations of the Entente] without exception pledge themselves to do the same&quot;. They did not intend to annex territories occupied by force. Joffe telegraphed the marvelous news to Petrograd. Thanks to informal chatting in the mess, one of Hoffmann&#x27;s aides, Colonel Friedrich Brinckmann, realized that the Russians had optimistically misinterpreted the Central Powers&#x27; meaning. It fell to Hoffmann to set matters straight at dinner on 27 December: Poland, Lithuania and Courland, already occupied by the Central Powers, were determined to separate from Russia on the principle of self-determination that the Bolsheviks themselves espoused. Joffe &quot;looked as if he had received a blow on the head&quot;. Pokrovsky wept as he asked how they could speak of &quot;peace without annexations when Germany was tearing eighteen provinces away from the Russian state&quot;. The Germans and the Austro-Hungarians planned to annex slices of Polish territory and to set up a rump Polish state with what remained. The Baltic governorates were to become client states ruled by German princes. Czernin was beside himself that this hitch that was slowing the negotiations; self-determination was anathema to his government and they urgently needed grain from the east because Vienna was on the verge of starvation. He proposed to make a separate peace. Kühlmann warned that if they negotiated separately, Germany would immediately withdraw all its divisions from the Austrian front; Czernin dropped that threat. The food crisis in Vienna was eventually eased by &quot;forced drafts of grain from Hungary, Poland, and Romania and by a last moment contribution from Germany of 450 truck-loads of flour&quot;. At Russian request, they agreed to recess the talks for twelve days.
The Soviets&#x27; only hopes were that time would make their allies agree to join the negotiations or that the western European proletariat would revolt and so their best strategy was to prolong the negotiations. As Foreign Minister Leon Trotsky wrote, &quot;To delay negotiations, there must be someone to do the delaying&quot;. Therefore, Trotsky replaced Joffe as the leader.

On the other side were significant political realignments. On New Year&#x27;s Day in Berlin, the Kaiser insisted that Hoffmann reveal his views on the future German-Polish border. He advocated taking a small slice of Poland; Hindenburg and Ludendorff wanted much more. They were furious with Hoffmann for breaching the chain of command and wanted him to be dismissed and sent to command a division. The Kaiser refused, but Ludendorff no longer spoke with Hoffmann on the telephone since the communication was now through an intermediary.

The German Supreme Commanders were also furious at ruling out of annexations, contending that the peace &quot;must increase Germany&#x27;s material power&quot;. They denigrated Kühlmann and pressed for additional territorial acquisitions. When Hindenburg was asked why they needed the Baltic provinces he replied, &quot;To secure my left flank for when the next war happens.&quot; However, the most profound transformation was that a delegation from the Ukrainian Rada, which had declared independence from Russia, had arrived at Brest-Litovsk. They would make peace if they were given the Polish city of Cholm and its surroundings, and they would provide desperately needed grain. Czernin no longer was desperate for a prompt settlement with the Russians.
When they reconvened, Trotsky declined the invitation to meet Prince Leopold and terminated shared meals and other sociable interactions with the representatives of the Central Powers. Day after day, Trotsky &quot;engaged Kühlmann in debate, rising to subtle discussion of first principles that ranged far beyond the concrete territorial issues that divided them&quot;. The Central Powers signed a peace treaty with Ukraine during the night of 8–9 February even though the Russians had retaken Kiev. German and Austro-Hungarian troops entered Ukraine to prop up the Rada. Finally, Hoffmann broke the impasse with the Russians by focusing the discussion on maps of the future boundaries. Trotsky summarised their situation &quot;Germany and Austria-Hungary are cutting off from the domains of the former Russian Empire territories more than 150,000 square kilometers in size&quot;. He was granted a nine-day recess for the Russians to decide whether to sign.
In Petrograd, Trotsky argued passionately against signing and proposed that instead, &quot;they should announce the termination of the war and demobilization without signing any peace.&quot; Privately, in correspondence with Count Otto von Czernin, Trotsky had expressed his willingness to relent to peace terms upon the resumption of a German offensive although with moral dissent. Lenin was for signing rather than having an even more ruinous treaty forced on them after a few more weeks of military humiliation. The &quot;Left Communists&quot;, led by Nikolai Bukharin and Karl Radek, were sure that Germany, Austria, Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria were all on the verge of revolution. They wanted to continue the war with a newly raised revolutionary force while awaiting these upheavals. Consequently, Lenin agreed to Trotsky&#x27;s formula – a position summed up as &quot;no war – no peace&quot; – which was announced when the negotiators reconvened on 10 February 1918. The Soviets thought that their stalling was succeeding until 16 February when Hoffmann notified them that the war would resume in two days, when fifty-three divisions advanced against the near-empty Soviet trenches. On the night of 18 February, the Central Committee supported Lenin&#x27;s resolution that they sign the treaty by a margin of seven to five. Hoffmann kept advancing until 23 February when he presented new terms that included the withdrawal of all Soviet troops from Ukraine and Finland. The Soviets were given 48 hours to open negotiations with the Germans, and another 72 to conclude them. Lenin told the Central Committee that &quot;you must sign this shameful peace in order to save the world revolution&quot;. If they did not agree, he would resign. He was supported by six Central Committee members, opposed by three, with Trotsky and three others abstaining. Debate in the All-Russian Central Executive Committee was intense, with Left SRs jeering Lenin as a traitor. The measure passed 116 to 85.

Trotsky resigned as foreign minister and was replaced by Georgy Chicherin.

When Sokolnikov arrived at Brest-Litovsk, he declared &quot;we are going to sign immediately the treaty presented to us as an ultimatum but at the same time refuse to enter into any discussion of its terms&quot;. The treaty was signed at 17:50 on 3 March 1918.

==Terms==
===Signing===

The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed on 3 March 1918. The signatories were Soviet Russia signed by Grigori Sokolnikov on the one side and the German Empire, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Ottoman Empire on the other.

The treaty marked Russia&#x27;s final withdrawal from World War I as an enemy of her co-signatories, on severe terms. In all, the treaty took away territory that included a quarter of the population and the industry of the former Russian Empire and nine tenths of its coal mines.

===Territorial cessions in eastern Europe===

Russia renounced all territorial claims in Finland (whose independence it had already recognized), Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, most of Belarus, and Ukraine. The territory of the Kingdom of Poland was not mentioned in the treaty, as the Germans refused to recognize the existence of any Polish representatives, which in turn led to Polish protests. The treaty stated that &quot;Germany and Austria-Hungary intend to determine the future fate of these territories in agreement with their populations.&quot; Most of the territories were in effect ceded to Germany, which intended to have them become economic and political dependencies, where the local German-speaking minority would be the ruling elite. New monarchies were to be created in Lithuania and the proposed &quot;United Baltic Duchy&quot; (which was planned to comprise Latvia and Estonia). Later in 1918, German aristocrats Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach (for Lithuania), and Adolf Friedrich, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (for the planned United Baltic Duchy), were nominally appointed, but in reality never became, rulers of these envisaged new pro-German countries.

This plan was detailed by German Colonel General Erich Ludendorff, who wrote, &quot;German prestige demands that we should hold a strong protecting hand, not only over German citizens, but over all Germans.&quot;

The occupation of the western part of the former Russian Empire ultimately proved a costly blunder for Berlin, as over one million German troops lay sprawled out from Poland nearly to the Caspian Sea, all idle and depriving Germany of badly needed manpower in France. The hopes of using Ukraine&#x27;s grain and coal proved abortive; in addition, the local population became increasingly hostile to the occupation. Revolts and guerrilla warfare began breaking out all over the occupied territory, many of them inspired by Bolshevik agents. German troops also had to intervene in the Finnish Civil War, and Ludendorff became increasingly concerned that his troops were being affected by propaganda emanating from Moscow, which was one of the reasons he was reluctant to transfer divisions to the Western Front. The attempt at establishing an independent Ukrainian state under German guidance was unsuccessful as well. However, Ludendorff completely ruled out the idea of marching on Moscow and Petrograd to remove the Bolshevik government from power.

Germany transferred hundreds of thousands of veteran troops to the Western Front for the 1918 Spring Offensive, which shocked the Allied Powers but ultimately failed. Some Germans later blamed the occupation for significantly weakening the Spring Offensive. The Germans began slowly but steadily withdrawing personnel from the occupied territories from east to west as the troop transfers to the Western Front continued throughout 1918. Local independence movements, particularly those based in what is now Belarus and Ukraine, moved in to fill the void the Germans left behind and established themselves in the newly freed territories.

Belarus and Ukraine became independent, while Poland, Estonia, Livonia, and Courland become protectorates of the German Empire. Later, Bessarabia united with Romania.

Russia lost 34% of its population, 54% of its industrial land, 89% of its coalfields, and 26% of its railways. Russia was also fined 6 billion marks.

===Territorial cessions in the Caucasus===
At the insistence of Talaat Pasha, the treaty declared that the territory Russia took from the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), specifically Ardahan, Kars, and Batumi, were to be returned. At the time of the treaty, this territory was under the effective control of Armenian and Georgian forces.

Paragraph 3 of Article IV of the treaty stated that:
Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia rejected the treaty and instead declared independence. They formed the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic.

===Soviet-German financial agreement of August 1918===

In the wake of Soviet repudiation of Tsarist bonds, the nationalisation of foreign-owned property and confiscation of foreign assets, and Entente forces landing on Russian territory, the Soviets and Germany signed an additional agreement on 27 August 1918. The Soviets agreed to pay six billion marks in compensation for German losses.

The amount was equal to 300 million rubles. The Soviets additionally agreed to sell Germany 25% of the output of the Baku oil fields.
Three secret clauses provided for German military action against Entente forces on Russian soil, as well as the expulsion of British troops from Baku.

==Lasting effects==

The treaty freed up a million German soldiers for the Western Front and allowed Germany to use &quot;much of Russia&#x27;s food supply, industrial base, fuel supplies, and communications with Western Europe&quot; According to historian Spencer Tucker, the Allied Powers felt thatThe treaty was the ultimate betrayal of the Allied cause and sowed the seeds for the Cold War. With Brest-Litovsk, the spectre of German domination in Eastern Europe threatened to become reality, and the Allies now began to think seriously about military intervention [in Russia].For the Western Allied Powers, the terms that Germany had imposed on Russia were interpreted as a warning of what to expect if the Central Powers won the war. Between Brest-Litovsk and the point when the situation in the Western Front became dire, some officials in the German government and the high command began to favour offering more lenient terms to the Allied Powers in exchange for their recognition of German gains in the east.

The treaty marked a significant contraction of the territory controlled by the Bolsheviks or that they could lay claim to as effective successors of the Russian Empire. While the independence of Poland was already accepted by them in principle, and Lenin had signed a document accepting the Finnish independence, the loss of Ukraine and the Baltics created, from the Bolshevik perspective, dangerous bases of anti-Bolshevik military activity in the subsequent Russian Civil War (1917–1923). However, Bolshevik control of Ukraine and Transcaucasia was, at the time, fragile or non-existent.

Many Russian nationalists and some revolutionaries were furious at the Bolsheviks&#x27; acceptance of the treaty and joined forces to fight them. Non-Russians who inhabited the lands lost by Bolshevik Russia in the treaty saw the changes as an opportunity to set up independent states.

Immediately after the signing of the treaty, Lenin moved the Soviet government from Petrograd to Moscow to prevent Germany from capturing the Russian capital in the event of an invasion. Trotsky blamed the peace treaty on the bourgeoisie, the social revolutionaries, Tsarist diplomats, Tsarist bureaucrats, &quot;the Kerenskys, Tseretelis and Chernovs&quot;, the Tsarist regime, and the &quot;petty-bourgeois compromisers&quot;.

The treaty opened a permanent rift between the Bolsheviks and Left Socialist Revolutionaries. In July 1918 the Left SRs assassinated German Ambassador Wilhelm von Mirbach in the hopes that it would induce Germany to annul the treaty, leading to the Left SR Uprising.

Relations between Russia and the Central Powers did not go smoothly. The Ottoman Empire broke the treaty by invading the newly created First Republic of Armenia in May 1918. Joffe became the Russian ambassador to Germany. His priority was distributing propaganda to trigger the German revolution. On 4 November 1918, &quot;the Soviet courier&#x27;s packing-case had &#x27;come to pieces in a Berlin railway station; it was filled with insurrectionary documents. Joffe and his staff were ejected from Germany in a sealed train on 5 November 1918. In the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended World War I, one clause abrogated the Brest-Litovsk treaty. Next, the Bolshevik legislature (VTsIK) annulled the treaty on 13 November 1918, and the text of the VTsIK Decision was printed in the newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot; the next day.

In the year after the armistice following a timetable set by the victors, the German Army withdrew its occupying forces from the lands gained in Brest-Litovsk. However, relations between Russia and the Allied Powers were also bad due to the Allied Powers&#x27; intervention in the Russian Civil War against the Soviet government of Russia and its allies. The fate of the region, and the location of the eventual western border of the Soviet Union, was settled in violent and chaotic struggles over the course of the next three and a half years. The Polish–Soviet War was particularly bitter; it ended with the Treaty of Riga in 1921. Although most of Ukraine and Belarus fell under Bolshevik control and eventually became two of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union, Poland and the Baltic states re-emerged as independent nations. In the Treaty of Rapallo, concluded in April 1922, Germany accepted the Treaty&#x27;s nullification, and the two powers agreed to abandon all war-related territorial and financial claims against each other.

This state of affairs lasted until 1939, when after signing the secret protocol to the Nazi-Soviet pact, the Soviet Union was able to advance its borders westward by invading Poland in September 1939, by conquering parts of eastern Finland in the 1939–1940 Winter War, and by invading and occupying Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and parts of Romania (Bessarabia and northern Bukovina) in 1940. During World War II the Soviet leadership was thus able to overturn the majority of the territorial losses incurred at Brest-Litovsk, except for the larger part of Finland, western Congress Poland, and Western Armenia.

==Portraits==
Emil Orlik, the Viennese Secessionist artist, attended the conference, at the invitation of Richard von Kühlmann. He drew portraits of all the participants, along with a series of smaller caricatures. These were gathered together into a book, &quot;Brest-Litovsk,&quot; a copy of which was given to each of the participants.

<text>Times Square is a major commercial intersection, tourist destination, entertainment hub, and neighborhood in the Midtown Manhattan section of New York City. It is formed by the junction of Broadway, Seventh Avenue, and 42nd Street. Together with adjacent Duffy Square, Times Square is a bowtie-shaped plaza five blocks long between 42nd and 47th Streets.

Times Square is brightly lit by numerous digital billboards and advertisements as well as businesses offering 24/7 service. One of the world&#x27;s busiest pedestrian areas, it is also the hub of the Broadway Theater District and a major center of the world&#x27;s entertainment industry. Times Square is one of the world&#x27;s most visited tourist attractions, drawing an estimated 50 million visitors annually. Approximately 330,000 people pass through Times Square daily, many of them tourists, while over 460,000 pedestrians walk through Times Square on its busiest days. The and stations have consistently ranked as the busiest in the New York City Subway system, transporting more than 200,000 passengers daily.

Formerly known as Longacre Square, Times Square was renamed in 1904 after &quot;The New York Times&quot; moved its headquarters to the then newly erected Times Building, now One Times Square. It is the site of the annual New Year&#x27;s Eve ball drop, which began on December 31, 1907, and continues to attract over a million visitors to Times Square every year, in addition to a worldwide audience of one billion or more on various digital media platforms.

Times Square, specifically the intersection of Broadway and 42nd Street, is the eastern terminus of the Lincoln Highway, the first road across the United States for motorized vehicles. Times Square is sometimes referred to as &quot;the Crossroads of the World&quot; and &quot;the heart of the Great White Way&quot;.

==Geography==
Times Square functions as a town square, but is not geometrically a square. It is closer in shape to a bowtie, with two triangles emanating roughly north and south from 45th Street, where Seventh Avenue intersects Broadway. Broadway similarly intersects other north–south avenues at Union Square, Madison Square, Herald Square, and Verdi Square, none of which are squares. The area is bounded by West 42nd Street, West 47th Street, 7th Avenue, and Broadway. Broadway runs diagonally, crossing through the horizontal and vertical street grid of Manhattan laid down by the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, and that intersection creates the &quot;bowtie&quot; shape of Times Square.

Times Square is the official name of the southern triangle, below 45th Street. The northern triangle is officially known as Duffy Square and was dedicated in June 1939 to honor World War I chaplain Father Francis P. Duffy of the 69th New York Infantry Regiment. A statue by Charles Keck was dedicated in May 1937 as a memorial to Duffy. There is also a statue of composer and entertainer George M. Cohan, and the TKTS discount ticket booth for same-day Broadway and off-Broadway theaters that has been at the site since June 1973.

==History==

===Early history===
When Manhattan Island was first settled by the Dutch colonists, three small streams united near what is now the intersection of 10th Avenue and 40th Street. These three streams formed the &quot;Great Kill&quot; (Dutch: &quot;Grote Kil&quot;). From there the Great Kill wound through the low-lying Reed Valley, known for fish and waterfowl, and emptied into a deep bay in the Hudson River at the present 42nd Street. The name was retained in a tiny hamlet, Great Kill, that became a center for carriage-making, as the upland to the south and east became known as Longacre.

Before and after the American Revolution, the area belonged to John Morin Scott, a general of the New York militia, in which he served under George Washington. Scott&#x27;s manor house was at what is currently 43rd Street, surrounded by countryside used for farming and breeding horses. In the first half of the 19th century, it became one of the prized possessions of John Jacob Astor, who made a second fortune selling off lots to hotels and other real estate concerns as the city rapidly spread uptown.

By 1872, the area had become the center of New York&#x27;s horse carriage industry. The locality had not previously been given a name, and city authorities called it Longacre Square after Long Acre in London, where the horse and carriage trade was centered in that city. William Henry Vanderbilt owned and ran the American Horse Exchange there. In 1910, it became the Winter Garden Theatre.

As more profitable commerce and industrialization of Lower Manhattan pushed homes, theaters, and prostitution northward from the Tenderloin District, Longacre Square became nicknamed the &quot;Thieves Lair&quot; for its rollicking reputation as a low entertainment district. The first theater on the square, the Olympia, was built by cigar manufacturer and impresario Oscar Hammerstein I. According to &quot;Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898&quot;, &quot;By the early 1890s this once sparsely settled stretch of Broadway was ablaze with electric light and thronged by crowds of middle- and upper-class theatre, restaurant and cafe patrons.&quot;

===1900s–1930s===
In 1904, &quot;New York Times&quot; publisher Adolph S. Ochs moved the newspaper&#x27;s operations to a new skyscraper on 42nd Street at Longacre Square, on the site of the former Pabst Hotel, which had existed on the site for less than a decade since it opened in November 1899. Ochs persuaded Mayor George B. McClellan Jr. to construct a subway station there, and the area was renamed &quot;Times Square&quot; on April 8, 1904. Just three weeks later, the first electrified advertisement appeared on the side of a bank at the corner of 46th Street and Broadway. The north end later became Duffy Square, and the former Horse Exchange became the Winter Garden Theatre, constructed in 1911.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; moved to more spacious offices one block west of the square in 1913 and sold the building in 1961. The old Times Building was later named the Allied Chemical Building in 1963. Now known simply as One Times Square, it is famed for the Times Square Ball drop on its roof every New Year&#x27;s Eve.

In 1913, the Lincoln Highway Association, headed by entrepreneur Carl G. Fisher, chose the intersection of 42nd Street and Broadway (at the southeast corner of Times Square) to be the Eastern Terminus of the Lincoln Highway. This was the first road across the United States, which originally ran coast to coast through 13 states to its western terminus in Lincoln Park in San Francisco.

Times Square grew dramatically after World War I. It became a cultural hub full of theatres, music halls, and upscale hotels.

Advertising also grew significantly in the 1920s, growing from $25 million to $85 million over the decade. For example, the Wrigley Spearmint Gum sign, possibly the biggest electric sign &quot;in the world,&quot; cost $9,000 per month to rent. Some contemporary critics, such as Thorstein Veblen and G. K. Chesterton, disliked the advertising at Times Square. Fritz Lang, after seeing Times Square in 1923, used it as inspiration for his dark industrial film &quot;Metropolis&quot;.

Entertainment icons such as Irving Berlin, Charlie Chaplin, and Fred Astaire were closely associated with Times Square in the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s. However, it was also during this period that the area began to be besieged by crime and corruption, in the form of gambling and prostitution; one case that garnered huge attention was the arrest and subsequent execution of police officer Charles Becker.

=== 1930s–1950s ===

The general atmosphere of Times Square changed with the onset of the Great Depression in the early 1930s. City residents moved uptown to cheaper neighborhoods, and many popular theaters closed, replaced by saloons, brothels, &quot;burlesque halls, vaudeville stages, and dime houses&quot;. The area acquired a reputation as a dangerous and seedy neighborhood in the following decades.

Nevertheless, Times Square continued to be the site of the annual ball drop on New Year&#x27;s Eve. The ball drop was placed on hiatus for New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1942 and 1943 due to lighting restrictions during World War II, replaced by a moment of silence that was observed at midnight in Times Square, accompanied by the sound of chimes played from sound trucks.

On May 8, 1945, a massive crowd celebrated Victory in Europe Day in Times Square; and on August 15, 1945, the largest crowd in the history of Times Square gathered to celebrate Victory over Japan Day, reaching an estimated two million. The victory itself was announced by a headline on the &quot;zipper&quot; news ticker at One Times Square, which read &quot;OFFICIAL ***TRUMAN ANNOUNCES JAPANESE SURRENDER ***&quot;.

=== 1960s–1990s ===

==== Decline ====
From the 1960s to the early 1990s, the seediness of the area, especially due to its go-go bars, sex shops, peep shows, and adult theaters, became an infamous symbol of the city&#x27;s decline. As early as 1960, 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth avenues was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;the &#x27;worst&#x27; [block] in town&quot;. Later that decade, Times Square was depicted in &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; as gritty, depraved, and desperate. Conditions only worsened in the 1970s and 1980s, as did the crime in the rest of the city, with a 1981 article in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine calling 42nd Street in Times Square the &quot;sleaziest block in America&quot;. In the mid-1980s, the area bounded by 40th and 50th Streets and Seventh and Ninth Avenues saw over 15,000 crime complaints per year. The block of 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth avenues had 2,300 crimes per year in 1984, of which 20% were felonies.

Times Square was known in the 1970s-80s as the most notorious area for prostitution. In this era, formerly elegant movie theaters began to show x-rated films, and peep shows hustlers were common. In 1984, the area was so derelict and dilapidated, that the entire Times Square area paid the city only $6 million in property taxes (equivalent to $ million in ).

==== 1980s building boom ====

In the 1980s, a commercial building boom began in the western parts of Midtown as part of a long-term development plan developed under mayors Ed Koch and David Dinkins. These included office buildings such as 1540 Broadway, 1585 Broadway, and 750 Seventh Avenue, as well as hotels such as the Macklowe Hotel, Marriott Marquis, Crowne Plaza, and DoubleTree Suites. By 1986, New York City Planning Commission (CPC) was considering enacting regulations that would have forced new buildings along Times Square to include bright signage as well as deep setbacks. The CPC adopted a planning regulation in 1987, which required large new developments in Times Square to set aside about 5 percent of their space for &quot;entertainment uses&quot;. The regulation also required new buildings on Times Square to include large, bright signs.
The buildings at 1540 Broadway, 1585 Broadway, and 750 Seventh Avenue were completed at the beginning of the early 1990s recession, when 14.5 percent of Manhattan office space was vacant. Furthermore, some of office space in the western section of Midtown had been developed in the 1980s, of which only half had been leased. Consequently, 1540 Broadway was completely empty, while 1585 Broadway and 750 Seventh Avenue had one tenant each, despite the buildings having over of office space between them. Entertainment conglomerate Bertelsmann bought 1540 Broadway in 1992, spurring a revival of Times Square in the early 1990s. This was hastened when financial firm Morgan Stanley bought 1585 Broadway in 1993, followed by 750 Seventh Avenue in 1994.

==== 42nd Street Redevelopment, further revitalization ====

The Empire State Development Corporation (ESDC), an agency of the New York state government, had proposed redeveloping the area around a portion of West 42nd Street in 1981. Four towers designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee were to be built around 42nd Street&#x27;s intersections with Broadway and Seventh Avenue. These towers would have been redeveloped by George Klein of Park Tower Realty, though the Prudential Insurance Company of America joined the project in 1986. Furthermore, as part of the West Midtown special zoning district created in 1982, the New York City government had allowed new buildings in Times Square to be developed with an increased floor area ratio. To ensure the area would not be darkened at nightfall, the city passed zoning regulations that encouraged developers to add large, bright signs on their buildings.

In 1990, the State of New York took possession of six of the nine historic theaters on 42nd Street, and the New 42nd Street non-profit organization was appointed to oversee their restoration and maintenance. The theaters underwent renovation for Broadway shows, conversion for commercial purposes, or demolition. Opposition to the towers on Times Square, along with Prudential and Park Tower&#x27;s inability to secure tenants for the proposed buildings, led government officials to allow Prudential and Park Tower to postpone the project in 1992. By then, Prudential had spent $300 million on condemning the sites through eminent domain. The partners retained the right to develop the sites in the future, and the ESDC&#x27;s zoning guidelines remained in effect. In exchange for being permitted to delay construction of the sites until 2002, Prudential and Park Tower were compelled to add stores and install large signage on the existing buildings.

In 1992, the Times Square Alliance (formerly the Times Square Business Improvement District, or &quot;BID&quot; for short), a coalition of city government and local businesses dedicated to improving the quality of commerce and cleanliness in the district, started operations in the area. In 1998, the alliance opened a tourist information center in the former Embassy Theatre at 1560 Broadway; the information center operated until 2014.

In the mid-1990s, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani led an effort to clean up the area, an effort that is described by Steve Macek in &quot;Urban Nightmares: The Media, the Right, and the Moral Panic Over the City&quot;: Security was increased, pornographic theatres were closed, and &quot;undesirable&quot; low-rent residents were pressured to relocate, and then more tourist-friendly attractions and upscale establishments were opened. Advocates of the remodeling claim that the neighborhood is safer and cleaner. Detractors have countered that the changes have homogenized or &quot;Disneyfied&quot; the character of Times Square and have unfairly targeted lower-income New Yorkers from nearby neighborhoods such as Hell&#x27;s Kitchen. The changes were shaped in large part by the actions of The Walt Disney Company, which bought and restored the New Amsterdam Theatre after several attempts at redevelopment had failed. As part of a contract with Disney, officials from the city and state evicted the pornographic theaters and contracted with Madame Tussauds and AMC Theatres to move onto 42nd Street. This spurred the construction of new office towers, hotels, and tourist attractions in the area.

Prudential and Klein dissolved their partnership for the four office-building sites at Times Square&#x27;s southern end in 1996. The same year, Douglas Durst acquired the site at the northeast corner of Broadway and 42nd Street, and he developed 4 Times Square there. The northwest corner of Seventh Avenue and 42nd Street was taken by Reuters, which enlisted Rudin Management as its development partner and built 3 Times Square on that corner; that building opened in 2001. In 1998, a joint venture of Klein, The Blackstone Group, and Boston Properties won the right to acquire the sites at the southwest and southeast corners of 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue for $330 million. 5 Times Square was completed on the southwest-corner site in 2002, and Times Square Tower opened on the southeast-corner site in 2004.

==== Effects ====
Times Square now boasts attractions such as ABC&#x27;s Times Square Studios, where &quot;Good Morning America&quot; is broadcast live; competing Hershey&#x27;s and M&amp;M&#x27;s stores across the street from each other, and multiple multiplex movie theaters. Additionally, the area contains restaurants such as the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, a seafood establishment; Planet Hollywood Restaurant and Bar, a theme restaurant; and Carmine&#x27;s, serving Italian cuisine. It has also attracted several large financial, publishing, and media firms to set up headquarters in the area. A larger presence of police has improved the safety of the area.

The theatres of Broadway and the huge number of animated neon and LED signs have been one of New York&#x27;s iconic images as well as a symbol of the intensely urban aspects of Manhattan. Since 1987 such signage has been mandated by zoning ordinances that require building owners to display illuminated signs, the only district in New York City with this requirement. The neighborhood has a minimum limit for lighting instead of the standard maximum limit. The density of illuminated signs in Times Square rivals that in Las Vegas. Officially, signs in Times Square are called &quot;spectaculars&quot;, and the largest of them are called &quot;jumbotrons&quot;. This signage ordinance was implemented in accordance with guidelines set in a revitalization program that New York Governor Mario Cuomo implemented in 1993.
Notable signage includes the Toshiba billboard directly under the NYE ball drop, the curved seven-story NASDAQ sign at the NASDAQ MarketSite at 4 Times Square on 43rd Street, and the curved Coca-Cola sign located underneath another large LED display owned and operated by Samsung. Both the Coca-Cola sign and Samsung LED displays were built by LED display manufacturer Daktronics. Times Square&#x27;s first environmentally friendly billboard powered by wind and solar energy was first lit on December 4, 2008. The new 20 Times Square development hosts the largest LED signage in Times Square at 18,000 square feet. The display is 1,000 square feet larger than the Times Square Walgreens display and one of the largest video-capable screens in the world.

===2000s–present===
In 2002, New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani administered the oath of office to the city&#x27;s next mayor, Michael Bloomberg, at Times Square after midnight on January 1 as part of the 2001–02 New Year&#x27;s celebration. Approximately 500,000 revelers attended. Security was high following the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, with more than 7,000 New York City police officers on duty in the Square, twice the number for an ordinary year.
Times Square started hosting other major annual events in the 2000s. Since 2002, the summer solstice has been marked by &quot;Mind over Madness&quot;, a mass yoga event involving up to 15,000 people. Tim Tompkins, a co-founder of the event, said part of its appeal was &quot;finding stillness and calm amid the city rush on the longest day of the year&quot;. Architect Mark Foster Gage proposed and designed the original Times Square Valentine&#x27;s Day heart in 2009. Since then, designing the heart has become an annual competition.

In February 2011, Times Square became smoke-free as New York extended the outdoors smoking ban to the area. The measure imposed a $50 fine for any person caught smoking within the area. From January 29 to February 1, 2014, a &quot;Super Bowl Boulevard&quot; was held on Broadway, especially in Times Square, between 34th and 47th Streets, as part of Super Bowl XLVIII. The boulevard contained activities such as autographs, a -high toboggan run, and photographs with the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The area was under increased security and witnessed over 400,000 people during the period.

In October 2022, casino operator Caesars Entertainment and commercial property developer SL Green submitted a joint proposal to open a casino at 1515 Broadway, along Times Square. The New York state government has yet to act on the proposal.

====Pedestrian plaza====
On February 26, 2009, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that traffic lanes along Broadway from 42nd Street to 47th Street would be de-mapped starting Memorial Day 2009 and transformed into pedestrian plazas as a trial until at least the end of the year. The same was done in Herald Square from 33rd to 35th Street. The results were to be closely monitored to determine if the project was successful and should be extended. Bloomberg also stated that he believed the street shutdown would make New York more livable by reducing pollution, cutting down on pedestrian-vehicle accidents, and helping traffic flow more smoothly through the Midtown street grid.

The pedestrian plaza project was originally opposed by local businesses, who thought that closing the street to cars would hurt business. The original seats put out for pedestrians were inexpensive multicolored plastic lawn chairs, a source of amusement to many New Yorkers; they lasted from the onset of the plaza transformation until August 14, 2009, when they were ceremoniously bundled together in an installation christened &quot;Now You See It, Now You Don&#x27;t&quot; by the artist Jason Peters, and shortly afterward were replaced by sturdier metal furniture. Although the plaza had mixed results on traffic in the area, injuries to motorists and pedestrians decreased, fewer pedestrians were walking in the road, and the number of pedestrians in Times Square increased. On February 11, 2010, Bloomberg announced that the pedestrian plazas would become permanent.

The city started rebuilding the plaza in 2010, hiring the design and landscaping firm Snøhetta to permanently replace Broadway&#x27;s roadway with custom-made granite pavers and benches. By December 2013, the first phase of the Times Square pedestrian plaza had been completed at the southern end of the square in time for the Times Square Ball drop on New Year&#x27;s Eve. The project was originally intended to be completed by the end of 2015. The entire project was finally completed just before New Year&#x27;s Eve 2016. Some safety bollards were also installed as part of the renovation to prevent vehicular attacks or collisions on the sidewalk. After a 2017 vehicle-ramming attack, there were calls to install more bollards along Times Square.

Times Square&#x27;s pedestrian plaza is frequented by topless women (with painted breasts) called &quot;desnudas&quot;, as well as costumed characters, who typically panhandle for tips. The pedestrian plaza became a source of controversy in the summer of 2015 because of a large number of complaints about the topless women and panhandling characters. Although neither of these activities are illegal, opponents believed that the panhandlers&#x27; presence was detrimental to the quality of life in the area. There were calls from Police Commissioner Bratton and Mayor Bill de Blasio to remove the plaza, although Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer opposed the proposal. In June 2016, work started on &quot;pedestrian flow zones&quot; where no one was allowed to loiter, as well as &quot;activity zones&quot; where costumed characters were allowed to perform.

=== Incidents ===
There have been several incidents in Times Square:
* On the morning of March 6, 2008, a small bomb caused minor damage, but there were no reported injuries.
* On May 1, 2010, Times Square was evacuated from 43rd to 46th Streets following the discovery of a car bomb. It was found to be a failed bombing.
* On May 18, 2017, a vehicle-ramming attack at Times Square killed one person and injured 22 others.

==Number of visitors==
Times Square is the most visited place globally with 360,000 pedestrian visitors a day, amounting to over 131 million a year. , it had a greater attendance than each of the Disney theme parks worldwide, with 128,794,000 visitors between March 2012 and February 2013, versus 126,479,000 for the Walt Disney World theme parks in Bay Lake, Florida, in 2012. Even excluding residents from the visitor count, Times Square is the world&#x27;s second most visited tourist attraction, behind the Las Vegas Strip. The high level of pedestrian traffic has resulted in $4.8 billion in annual retail, entertainment, and hotel sales, with 22 cents out of every dollar spent by visitors in New York City being spent within Times Square.

===New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations===

Times Square is the site of the annual New Year&#x27;s Eve ball drop. About one million revelers crowd Times Square for the New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations, more than twice the usual number of visitors the area usually receives daily. However, for the millennium celebration on December 31, 1999, published reports stated approximately two million people overflowed Times Square, flowing from Sixth Avenue to Eighth Avenue and back on Broadway and Seventh Avenue to 59th Street, making it the largest gathering in Times Square since August 1945 during celebrations marking the end of World War II.

On December 31, 1907, a ball signifying New Year&#x27;s Day was first dropped at Times Square, and the Square has held the main New Year&#x27;s celebration in New York City ever since. On that night, hundreds of thousands of people congregate to watch the Waterford Crystal ball being lowered on a pole atop the building, marking the start of the new year. It replaced a lavish fireworks display from the top of the building that was held from 1904 to 1906 but stopped by city officials because of the danger of fire. Beginning in 1908, and for more than eighty years thereafter, Times Square sign maker Artkraft Strauss was responsible for the ball-lowering. During World War II, a minute of silence, followed by a recording of church bells pealing, replaced the ball drop because of wartime blackout restrictions. Today, Countdown Entertainment and One Times Square handle the New Year&#x27;s Eve event in conjunction with the Times Square Alliance. A new energy-efficient LED ball debuted for the arrival of 2008, which was the centennial of the Times Square ball drop. The 2008–09 ball is larger and has become a permanent installation as a year-round attraction, being used for celebrations on days such as Valentine&#x27;s Day and Halloween.

The New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations are usually overseen by thousands of police officers. Aluminum barriers are erected to accommodate spectators; for the 2020 celebration, attended by a million people, barriers were erected from 38th to 59th Street and from Sixth to Eighth Avenue. Typically, the celebrations create large amounts of waste. The waste includes the 3,000 pounds of biodegradable confetti dropped at midnight, a tradition of which started in 1992. The New York City Department of Sanitation estimated that by 8 a.m. on New Year&#x27;s Day 2014, it had cleared over of trash from the New Year&#x27;s celebration, using 190 workers from their crews and the Times Square Alliance.

===Impact of COVID-19===

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City during 2020 reduced the number of people traveling to Times Square. About 108,000 pedestrians visited Times Square each day in late 2020 compared to the 380,000 before the pandemic. From March to October 2020, 26 of the area&#x27;s 46 hotels closed, as well as 39 of 151 stores and 84 of 162 restaurants. Times Square was closed to the public for New Year&#x27;s Day 2021 and observers were dispersed into enclosures measuring .

==In popular culture==

An immediately recognizable location, Times Square has been featured countless times in literature, films, video games, music videos, and on television.

The seediness of the area was featured prominently in such films as &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (1969), &quot;Born to Win&quot; (1971), and &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976). The area was shown in the 1980 film &quot;Times Square&quot;, which featured a punk rock/new wave soundtrack. It was also depicted in the 2011 movie &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot;. The area also appeared on &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; as the starting location in a race around the world in the first episode of the show&#x27;s 25th season, as well as on the sixth season of the Israeli edition of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; with teams finishing their second leg in Times Square.

Times Square has been fictionally attacked and destroyed in several movies, including &quot;Knowing&quot;, when a solar flare destroys New York City; &quot;Deep Impact&quot;, when a tsunami created from a meteor impact destroys New York City; the 1998 film &quot;Godzilla&quot;, where Godzilla is chased through Times Square; the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; movies; Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Stand&quot;, where the intersection is overcome by total anarchy; &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs&quot;. It was also seen in the festival battle scene in the 2002 film &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, and a stand-off in the later film &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot;.

Films and TV shows have also employed the opposite tactic, depicting the typically bustling area as eerily still, such as in &quot;Vanilla Sky,&quot; as well as the post-apocalyptic &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, in which Will Smith and his dog go hunting for deer in the deserted urban canyon. In the pilot episode of the TV series &quot;Blindspot&quot;, Times Square is completely emptied due to an abandoned bag being suspected to be a bomb.

Times Square also has featured prominently in video games. For instance, in &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;, a recreation of the Times Square area referred to in-game as &quot;Star Junction&quot;, is included in the game&#x27;s fictional &quot;Liberty City&quot; setting. Times Square is also shown in &quot;Battlefield 3&quot;, where the final fight with the main antagonist takes place, where the player must stop him from detonating a nuclear bomb in the square; and &quot;Crysis 2&quot;, in which player must fight off attacking alien forces to assist U.S. Marines in evacuating the area. &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot; also features Times Square both as a photo spot and as a part of the New York city circuit which also includes Central Park.

<text>Terrence Mitchell Riley (born June 24, 1935) is an American composer and performing musician best known as a pioneer of the minimalist school of composition. Influenced by jazz and Indian classical music, his work became notable for its innovative use of repetition, tape music techniques, improvisation, and delay systems. His best known works are the 1964 composition &quot;In C&quot; and the 1969 album &quot;A Rainbow in Curved Air&quot;, both considered landmarks of minimalism and important influences on experimental music, rock, and contemporary electronic music. Subsequent works such as &quot;Shri Camel&quot; (1980) explored just intonation.

Raised in Redding, California, Riley began studying composition and performing solo piano in the 1950s. He befriended and collaborated with composer La Monte Young, and later became involved with both the San Francisco Tape Music Center and Young&#x27;s New York collective, the Theatre of Eternal Music. A three-record deal with CBS in the late 1960s brought his work to wider audiences. In 1970, he began intensive studies under Hindustani singer Pandit Pran Nath, whom he often accompanied in performance. He has collaborated frequently throughout his career, most extensively with chamber ensemble the Kronos Quartet and his son, guitarist Gyan Riley.

==Life==
Riley was born in Colfax, California on June 24, 1935, and grew up in Redding, California. In the 1950s, he began performing as a solo pianist and studied composition at San Francisco State University, the San Francisco Conservatory, and the University of California, Berkeley, studying with Seymour Shifrin and Robert Erickson. He befriended composer La Monte Young, whose earliest minimalist compositions using sustained tones were an influence; together, Young and Riley performed Riley&#x27;s improvisatory composition &quot;Concert for Two Pianists and Tape Recorders&quot; in 1959–60. Riley later became involved in the experimental San Francisco Tape Music Center, working with Morton Subotnick, Steve Reich, Pauline Oliveros, and Ramon Sender. Throughout the 1960s, he also traveled frequently in Europe, taking in musical influences and supporting himself by playing in piano bars. He also performed briefly with the Theatre of Eternal Music in New York in 1965-1966.

His most influential teacher was Pandit Pran Nath (1918–1996), a master of Indian classical voice who also taught La Monte Young, Marian Zazeela, and Michael Harrison. Riley made numerous trips to India over the course of their association to study and accompany him on tabla, tambura, and voice. In 1971 he joined the Mills College faculty to teach Indian classical music. Riley also cites John Cage and &quot;the really great chamber music groups of John Coltrane and Miles Davis, Charles Mingus, Bill Evans, and Gil Evans&quot; as influences on his work. He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate Degree in Music at Chapman University in 2007.

Around 1980, Riley began his long-lasting association with the Kronos Quartet when he met their founder David Harrington while at Mills. Throughout his career, Riley composed 13 string quartets for the ensemble, in addition to other works. He wrote his first orchestral piece, &quot;Jade Palace&quot;, in 1991, and has continued to pursue that avenue, with several commissioned orchestral compositions following. He is also currently performing and teaching both as an Indian raga vocalist and as a solo pianist.

Riley continues to perform live, and was part of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in May 2011.
==Techniques==
Riley&#x27;s music is usually based on improvising through a series of modal figures of different lengths. Works such as &quot;In C&quot; (1964) and the &quot;Keyboard Studies&quot; (1964–1966) demonstrate this technique. The first performance of &quot;In C&quot; was given by Steve Reich, Jon Gibson, Pauline Oliveros and Morton Subotnick. Its form was an innovation: The piece consists of 53 separate modules of roughly one measure apiece, each containing a different musical pattern but each, as the title implies, in the key of C. One performer beats a steady pulse of &quot;C&quot;s on the piano to keep tempo. The others, in any number and on any instrument, perform these musical modules following a few loose guidelines, with the different musical modules interlocking in various ways as time goes on.

In the 1950s Riley was already working with tape loops, a technology still in its infancy at the time; he would later, with the help of a sound engineer, create what he called a &quot;time-lag accumulator&quot;. He has continued manipulating tapes to musical effect, in the studio and in live performances throughout his career. An early tape loop piece titled &quot;Music for the Gift&quot; (1963) featured the trumpet playing of Chet Baker. It was during Riley&#x27;s time in Paris, while composing this piece, that he conceived of and created the time-lag accumulator technique. Premiered in 1968 in the Magic Theatre Exhibition at the Nelson Atkins Gallery in Kansas City, a new version of the installation was commissioned three decades later by Lille 2004-European Capital of Culture and purchased by the Museum of Contemporary Art of Lyon. A third version was built and presented by the Schauspielhaus in Bochum in 2019. He has composed using just intonation as well as microtones. In New York City in the mid-1960s he played with his longtime friend La Monte Young, as well as with John Cale and tabla player Angus MacLise, who were founding members of The Velvet Underground. Riley is credited as inspiring Cale&#x27;s keyboard part on Lou Reed&#x27;s composition &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot;, which was sung by German actress Nico and included on the album &quot;The Velvet Underground and Nico&quot;, recorded in 1966.

Riley&#x27;s famous overdubbed electronic album &quot;A Rainbow in Curved Air&quot; (recorded 1968, released 1969) inspired many later developments in electronic music. These include Pete Townshend&#x27;s organ parts on The Who&#x27;s &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot; and &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;, the latter named in tribute to Riley as well as to Meher Baba. Charles Hazlewood, in his BBC documentary on Minimalism (Part 1) suggests that the album &#x27;Tubular Bells&#x27; by Mike Oldfield was also inspired by Riley&#x27;s example. The English progressive rock group Curved Air, formed in 1970, took its name from the album.

Riley&#x27;s collaborators have included the Rova Saxophone Quartet, Pauline Oliveros, the ARTE Quartett, and, as mentioned, the Kronos Quartet. His 1995 &quot;Lisbon Concert&quot; recording features him in a solo piano format, improvising on his own works. In the liner notes Riley cites Art Tatum, Bud Powell and Bill Evans as his piano &quot;heroes&quot;, illustrating the importance of jazz to his conceptions.

==Personal life==
He has three children: one daughter, Colleen, and two sons, Gyan, who is a guitarist, and Shahn. He was married to Ann Riley until her death in 2015.

<text>The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) (palawa kani: purinina) is a carnivorous marsupial of the family Dasyuridae. It was formerly present across mainland Australia, but became extinct there around 3,500 years ago; it is now confined to the island of Tasmania. The size of a small dog, the Tasmanian devil became the largest carnivorous marsupial in the world following the extinction of the thylacine in 1936. It is related to quolls, and distantly related to the thylacine. It is characterised by its stocky and muscular build, black fur, pungent odour, extremely loud and disturbing screech, keen sense of smell, and ferocity when feeding. The Tasmanian devil&#x27;s large head and neck allow it to generate among the strongest bites per unit body mass of any extant predatory land mammal. It hunts prey and scavenges on carrion.

Although devils are usually solitary, they sometimes eat and defecate together in a communal location. Unlike most other dasyurids, the devil thermoregulates effectively, and is active during the middle of the day without overheating. Despite its rotund appearance, it is capable of surprising speed and endurance, and can climb trees and swim across rivers. Devils are not monogamous. Males fight one another for females, and guard their partners to prevent female infidelity. Females can ovulate three times in as many weeks during the mating season, and 80% of two-year-old females are seen to be pregnant during the annual mating season.

Females average four breeding seasons in their life, and give birth to 20 to 30 live young after three weeks&#x27; gestation. The newborn are pink, lack fur, have indistinct facial features, and weigh around at birth. As there are only four nipples in the pouch, competition is fierce, and few newborns survive. The young grow rapidly, and are ejected from the pouch after around 100 days, weighing roughly . The young become independent after around nine months.

In 1941, devils became officially protected. Since the late 1990s, the devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) has drastically reduced the population and now threatens the survival of the species, which in 2008 was declared to be endangered. Starting in 2013, Tasmanian devils are again being sent to zoos around the world as part of the Australian government&#x27;s Save the Tasmanian Devil Program. The devil is an iconic symbol of Tasmania and many organisations, groups and products associated with the state use the animal in their logos. It is seen as an important attractor of tourists to Tasmania and has come to worldwide attention through the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; character of the same name.

==Taxonomy==
Believing it to be a type of opossum, naturalist George Harris wrote the first published description of the Tasmanian devil in 1807, naming it &quot;Didelphis ursina&quot;, due to its bearlike characteristics such as the round ear. He had earlier made a presentation on the topic at the Zoological Society of London. However, that particular binomial name had been given to the common wombat (later reclassified as &quot;Vombatus ursinus&quot;) by George Shaw in 1800, and was hence unavailable. In 1838, a specimen was named &quot;Dasyurus laniarius&quot; by Richard Owen, but by 1877 he had relegated it to &quot;Sarcophilus&quot;. The modern Tasmanian devil was named &quot;Sarcophilus harrisii&quot; (&quot;Harris&#x27;s flesh-lover&quot;) by French naturalist Pierre Boitard in 1841.

A later revision of the devil&#x27;s taxonomy, published in 1987, attempted to change the species name to &quot;Sarcophilus laniarius&quot; based on mainland fossil records of only a few animals. However, this was not accepted by the taxonomic community at large; the name &quot;S. harrisii&quot; has been retained and &quot;S. laniarius&quot; relegated to a fossil species. &quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s pup&quot; was an early vernacular name given to it by the explorers of Tasmania, in reference to a religious figure who is a prince of hell and an assistant of Satan; the explorers first encountered the animal by hearing its far-reaching vocalisations at night. Related names that were used in the 19th century were &quot;Sarcophilus satanicus&quot; (&quot;Satanic flesh-lover&quot;) and &quot;Diabolus ursinus&quot; (&quot;bear devil&quot;), all due to early misconceptions of the species as implacably vicious. The Tasmanian devil (&quot;Sarcophilus harrisii&quot;) belongs to the family Dasyuridae. The genus &quot;Sarcophilus&quot; contains two other species, known only from Pleistocene fossils: &quot;S. laniarius&quot; and &quot;S. moomaensis&quot;. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the Tasmanian devil is most closely related to quolls.

According to Pemberton, the possible ancestors of the devil may have needed to climb trees to acquire food, leading to a growth in size and the hopping gait of many marsupials. He speculated that these adaptations may have caused the contemporary devil&#x27;s peculiar gait. The specific lineage of the Tasmanian devil is theorised to have emerged during the Miocene, molecular evidence suggesting a split from the ancestors of quolls between 10 and 15 million years ago, when severe climate change came to bear in Australia, transforming the climate from warm and moist to an arid, dry ice age, resulting in mass extinctions. As most of their prey died of the cold, only a few carnivores survived, including the ancestors of the quoll and thylacine. It is speculated that the devil lineage may have arisen at this time to fill a niche in the ecosystem, as a scavenger that disposed of carrion left behind by the selective-eating thylacine. The extinct &quot;Glaucodon ballaratensis&quot; of the Pliocene age has been dubbed an intermediate species between the quoll and devil. Fossil deposits in limestone caves at Naracoorte, South Australia, dating to the Miocene include specimens of &quot;S. laniarius&quot;, which were around 15% larger and 50% heavier than modern devils. Older specimens believed to be 50–70,000 years old were found in Darling Downs in Queensland and in Western Australia. It is not clear whether the modern devil evolved from &quot;S. laniarius&quot;, or whether they coexisted at the time. Richard Owen argued for the latter hypothesis in the 19th century, based on fossils found in 1877 in New South Wales. Large bones attributed to &quot;S. moornaensis&quot; have been found in New South Wales, and it has been conjectured that these two extinct larger species may have hunted and scavenged. It is known that there were several genera of thylacine millions of years ago, and that they ranged in size, the smaller being more reliant on foraging. As the devil and thylacine are similar, the extinction of the co-existing thylacine genera has been cited as evidence for an analogous history for the devils. It has been speculated that the smaller size of &quot;S. laniarius&quot; and &quot;S. moornaensis&quot; allowed them to adapt to the changing conditions more effectively and survive longer than the corresponding thylacines. As the extinction of these two species came at a similar time to human habitation of Australia, hunting by humans and land clearance have been mooted as possible causes. Critics of this theory point out that as indigenous Australians only developed boomerangs and spears for hunting around 10,000 years ago, a critical fall in numbers due to systematic hunting is unlikely. They also point out that caves inhabited by Aborigines have a low proportion of bones and rock paintings of devils, and suggest that this is an indication that it was not a large part of indigenous lifestyle. A scientific report in 1910 claimed that Aborigines preferred the meat of herbivores rather than carnivores. The other main theory for the extinction was that it was due to the climate change brought on by the most recent ice age.

===Genetics===

The Tasmanian devil&#x27;s genome was sequenced in 2010 by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Like all dasyurids, the devil has 14 chromosomes. Devils have a low genetic diversity compared to other Australian marsupials and placental carnivores; this is consistent with a founder effect as allelic size ranges were low and nearly continuous throughout all subpopulations measured. Allelic diversity was measured at 2.7–3.3 in the subpopulations sampled, and heterozygosity was in the range 0.386–0.467. According to a study by Menna Jones, &quot;gene flow appears extensive up to &quot;, meaning a high assignment rate to source or close neighbour populations &quot;in agreement with movement data. At larger scales (), gene flow is reduced but there is no evidence for isolation by distance&quot;. Island effects may also have contributed to their low genetic diversity. Periods of low population density may also have created moderate population bottlenecks, reducing genetic diversity. Low genetic diversity is thought to have been a feature in the Tasmanian devil population since the mid-Holocene. Outbreaks of devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) cause an increase in inbreeding. A sub-population of devils in the north-west of the state is genetically distinct from other devils, but there is some exchange between the two groups.

One strand conformation polymorphism analysis (OSCP) on the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I domain taken from various locations across Tasmania showed 25 different types, and showed a different pattern of MHC types in north-western Tasmania to eastern Tasmania. Those devils in the east of the state have less MHC diversity; 30% are of the same type as the tumour (type 1), and 24% are of type A. Seven of every ten devils in the east are of type A, D, G or 1, which are linked to DFTD; whereas only 55% of the western devils fall into these MHC categories. Of the 25 MHC types, 40% are exclusive to the western devils. Although the north-west population is less genetically diverse overall, it has higher MHC gene diversity, which allows them to mount an immune response to DFTD. According to this research, mixing the devils may increase the chance of disease. Of the fifteen different regions in Tasmania surveyed in this research, six were in the eastern half of the island. In the eastern half, Epping Forest had only two different types, 75% being type O. In the Buckland-Nugent area, only three types were present, and there were an average of 5.33 different types per location. In contrast, in the west, Cape Sorell yielded three types, and Togari North-Christmas Hills yielded six, but the other seven sites all had at least eight MHC types, and West Pencil Pine had 15 types. There was an average of 10.11 MHC types per site in the west. Recent research has suggested that the wild population of devils are rapidly evolving a resistance to DFTD.

==Description==
The Tasmanian devil is the largest surviving carnivorous marsupial. It has a squat, thick build, with a large head and a tail which is about half its body length. Unusually for a marsupial, its forelegs are slightly longer than its hind legs, and devils can run up to for short distances. The fur is usually black, often with irregular white patches on the chest and rump (although approximately 16% of wild devils do not have white patches). These markings suggest that the devil is most active at dawn and dusk, and they are thought to draw biting attacks toward less important areas of the body, as fighting between devils often leads to a concentration of scars in that region. Males are usually larger than females, having an average head and body length of , a tail and an average weight of . Females have an average head and body length of , a tail and an average weight of , although devils in western Tasmania tend to be smaller. Devils have five long toes on their forefeet, four pointing to the front and one coming out from the side, which gives the devil the ability to hold food. The hind feet have four toes, and the devils have non-retractable claws. The stocky devils have a relatively low centre of mass.

Devils are fully grown at two years of age, and few devils live longer than five years in the wild. Possibly the longest-lived Tasmanian devil recorded was Coolah, a male devil which lived in captivity for more than seven years. Born in January 1997 at the Cincinnati Zoo, Coolah died in May 2004 at the Fort Wayne Children&#x27;s Zoo. The devil stores body fat in its tail, and healthy devils have fat tails. The tail is largely non-prehensile and is important to its physiology, social behaviour and locomotion. It acts as a counterbalance to aid stability when the devil is moving quickly. An ano-genital scent gland at the base of its tail is used to mark the ground behind the animal with its strong, pungent scent. The male has external testes in a pouch-like structure formed by lateral ventrocrural folds of the abdomen, which partially hides and protects them. The testes are subovoid in shape and the mean dimensions of 30 testes of adult males was . The female&#x27;s pouch opens backwards, and is present throughout its life, unlike some other dasyurids.
The Tasmanian devil has the most powerful bite relative to body size of any living mammalian carnivore, with a Bite Force Quotient of 181 and exerting a canine bite force of . The jaw can open to 75–80 degrees, allowing the devil to generate the large amount of power to tear meat and crush bones—sufficient force to allow it to bite through thick metal wire. The power of the jaws is in part due to its comparatively large head. The teeth and jaws of Tasmanian devils resemble those of hyenas, an example of convergent evolution. Dasyurid teeth resemble those of primitive marsupials. Like all dasyurids, the devil has prominent canines and cheek teeth. It has three pairs of lower incisors and four pairs of upper incisors. These are located at the top of the front of the devil&#x27;s mouth. Like dogs, it has 42 teeth, however, unlike dogs, its teeth are not replaced after birth but grow continuously throughout life at a slow rate. It has a &quot;highly carnivorous dentition and adaptations for bone consumption&quot;. The devil has long claws that allow it to dig burrows and seek subterranean food easily and grip prey or mates strongly. The teeth and claw strength allow the devil to attack wombats up to in weight. The large neck and forebody that give the devil its strength also cause this strength to be biased towards the front half of the body; the lopsided, awkward, shuffling gait of the devil is attributed to this.

The devil has long whiskers on its face and in clumps on the top of the head. These help the devil locate prey when foraging in the dark, and aid in detecting when other devils are close during feeding. The whiskers can extend from the tip of the chin to the rear of the jaw and can cover the span of its shoulder. Hearing is its dominant sense, and it also has an excellent sense of smell, which has a range of . The devil, unlike other marsupials, has a &quot;well-defined, saddle-shaped ectotympanic&quot;. Since devils hunt at night, their vision seems to be strongest in black and white. In these conditions they can detect moving objects readily, but have difficulty seeing stationary objects.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Tasmanian devil was formerly present across mainland Australia, but became extinct there 3,500 years ago, co-incident with the extinction of the Thylacine from the region. A number of causal factors for the extinction have been proposed, including the introduction of the dingo, intensification of human activity, as well as climatic change.

Devils are found in all habitats on the island of Tasmania, including the outskirts of urban areas, and are distributed throughout the Tasmanian mainland and on Robbins Island (which is connected to mainland Tasmania at low tide). The north-western population is located west of the Forth River and as far south as Macquarie Heads. Previously, they were present on Bruny Island from the 19th century, but there have been no records of them after 1900. They were illegally introduced to Badger Island in the mid-1990s but were removed by the Tasmanian government by 2007. Although the Badger Island population was free from DFTD, the removed individuals were returned to the Tasmanian mainland, some to infected areas. A study has modelled the reintroduction of DFTD-free Tasmanian devils to the Australian mainland in areas where dingoes are sparse. It is proposed that devils would have fewer impacts on both livestock and native fauna than dingoes, and that the mainland population could act as an additional insurance population. In September 2015, 20 immunised captive-bred devils were released into Narawntapu National Park, Tasmania. Two later died from being hit by cars.

The &quot;core habitat&quot; of the devils is considered to be within the &quot;low to moderate annual rainfall zone of eastern and north-western Tasmania&quot;. Tasmanian devils particularly like dry sclerophyll forests and coastal woodlands. Although they are not found at the highest altitudes of Tasmania, and their population density is low in the button grass plains in the south-west of the state, their population is high in dry or mixed sclerophyll forests and coastal heaths. Devils prefer open forest to tall forest, and dry rather than wet forests. They are also found near roads where roadkill is prevalent, although the devils themselves are often killed by vehicles while retrieving the carrion. According to the Threatened Species Scientific Committee, their versatility means that habitat modification from destruction is not seen as a major threat to the species.

The devil is directly linked to the &quot;Dasyurotaenia robusta&quot;, a tapeworm which is classified as Rare under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. This tapeworm is found only in devils.

In late 2020, Tasmanian devils were reintroduced to mainland Australia in a sanctuary run by Aussie Ark in the Barrington Tops area of New South Wales. This was the first time devils had lived on the Australian mainland in over 3,000 years. 26 adult devils were released into the protected area, and by late April 2021, seven joeys had been born, with up to 20 expected by the end of the year.

==Ecology and behaviour==
The Tasmanian devil is a keystone species in the ecosystem of Tasmania. It is a nocturnal and crepuscular hunter, spending the days in dense bush or in a hole. It has been speculated that nocturnalism may have been adopted to avoid predation by eagles and humans. Young devils are predominantly crepuscular. There is no evidence of torpor.

Young devils can climb trees, but this becomes more difficult as they grow larger. Devils can scale trees of trunk diameter larger than , which tend to have no small side branches to hang onto, up to a height of around . Devils that are yet to reach maturity can climb shrubs to a height of , and can climb a tree to if it is not vertical. Adult devils may eat young devils if they are very hungry, so this climbing behaviour may be an adaptation to allow young devils to escape. Devils can also swim and have been observed crossing rivers that are in width, including icy cold waterways, apparently enthusiastically.

Tasmanian devils do not form packs, but rather spend most of their time alone once weaned. Classically considered as solitary animals, their social interactions were poorly understood. However, a field study published in 2009 shed some light on this. Tasmanian devils in Narawntapu National Park were fitted with proximity sensing radio collars which recorded their interactions with other devils over several months from February to June 2006. This revealed that all devils were part of a single huge contact network, characterised by male-female interactions during mating season, while female–female interactions were the most common at other times, although frequency and patterns of contact did not vary markedly between seasons. Previously thought to fight over food, males only rarely interacted with other males. Hence, all devils in a region are part of a single social network. They are considered to be non-territorial in general, but females are territorial around their dens. This allows a higher total mass of devils to occupy a given area than territorial animals, without conflict. Tasmanian devils instead occupy a home range. In a period of between two and four weeks, devils&#x27; home ranges are estimated to vary between , with an average of . The location and geometry of these areas depend on the distribution of food, particularly wallabies and pademelons nearby.

Devils use three or four dens regularly. Dens formerly owned by wombats are especially prized as maternity dens because of their security. Dense vegetation near creeks, thick grass tussocks, and caves are also used as dens. Adult devils use the same dens for life. It is believed that, as a secure den is highly prized, some may have been used for several centuries by generations of animals. Studies have suggested that food security is less important than den security, as habitat destruction that affects the latter has had more effect on mortality rates. Young pups remain in one den with their mother, and other devils are mobile, changing dens every 1–3 days and travelling a mean distance of every night. However, there are also reports that an upper bound can be per night. They choose to travel through lowlands, saddles and along the banks of creeks, particularly preferring carved-out tracks and livestock paths and eschewing steep slopes and rocky terrain. The amount of movement is believed to be similar throughout the year, except for mothers who have given birth recently. The similarity in travel distances for males and females is unusual for sexually dimorphic, solitary carnivores. As a male needs more food, he will spend more time eating than travelling. Devils typically make circuits of their home range during their hunts. In areas near human habitation, they are known to steal clothes, blankets and pillows and take them for use in dens in wooden buildings.

While the dasyurids have similar diet and anatomy, differing body sizes affect thermoregulation and thus behaviour. In ambient temperatures between , the devil was able to maintain a body temperature between . When the temperature was raised to , and the humidity to 50%, the devil&#x27;s body temperature spiked upwards by within 60 minutes, but then steadily decreased back to the starting temperature after a further two hours, and remained there for two more hours. During this time, the devil drank water and showed no visible signs of discomfort, leading scientists to believe that sweating and evaporative cooling is its primary means of heat dissipation. A later study found that devils pant but do not sweat to release heat. In contrast, many other marsupials were unable to keep their body temperatures down. As the smaller animals have to live in hotter and more arid conditions to which they are less well-adapted, they take up a nocturnal lifestyle and drop their body temperatures during the day, whereas the devil is active in the day and its body temperature varies by from its minimum at night to the maximum in the middle of the day.

The standard metabolic rate of a Tasmanian devil is 141 kJ/kg (15.3 kcal/lb) per day, many times lower than smaller marsupials. A devil uses per day. The field metabolic rate is 407 kJ/kg (44.1 kcal/lb). Along with quolls, Tasmanian devils have a metabolic rate comparable to non-carnivorous marsupials of a similar size. This differs from placental carnivores, which have comparatively high basal metabolic rates. A study of devils showed a loss of weight from from summer to winter, but in the same time, daily energy consumption increased from . This is equivalent to an increase in food consumption from . The diet is protein-based with 70% water content. For every of insects consumed, of energy are produced, while a corresponding amount of wallaby meat generated . In terms of its body mass, the devil eats only a quarter of the eastern quoll&#x27;s intake, allowing it to survive longer during food shortages.

===Feeding===

Tasmanian devils can take prey up to the size of a small kangaroo, but in practice they are opportunistic and eat carrion more often than they hunt live prey. Although the devil favours wombats because of the ease of predation and high fat content, it will eat all small native mammals such as wallabies, bettong and potoroos, domestic mammals (including sheep and rabbits), birds (including penguins), fish, fruit, vegetable matter, insects, tadpoles, frogs and reptiles. Their diet is widely varied and depends on the food available. Before the extinction of the thylacine, the Tasmanian devil ate thylacine joeys left alone in dens when their parents were away. This may have helped to hasten the extinction of the thylacine, which also ate devils. They are known to hunt water rats by the sea and forage on dead fish that have been washed ashore. Near human habitation, they can also steal shoes and chew on them, and eat the legs of otherwise robust sheep that have slipped in wooden shearing sheds, leaving their legs dangling below. Other unusual matter observed in devil scats includes collars and tags of devoured animals, intact echidna spines, pencil, plastic and jeans. Devils can bite through metal traps, and tend to reserve their strong jaws for escaping captivity rather than breaking into food storage. Due to their relative lack of speed, they cannot run down a wallaby or a rabbit, but they can attack animals that have become slow due to illness. They survey flocks of sheep by sniffing them from away and attack if the prey is ill. The sheep stamp their feet in a show of strength.

Despite their lack of extreme speed, there have been reports that devils can run at for , and it has been conjectured that, before European immigration and the introduction of livestock, vehicles and roadkill, they would have had to chase other native animals at a reasonable pace to find food. Pemberton has reported that they can average for &quot;extended periods&quot; on several nights per week, and that they run for long distances before sitting still for up to half an hour, something that has been interpreted as evidence of ambush predation.

Devils can dig to forage corpses, in one case digging down to eat the corpse of a buried horse that had died due to illness. They are known to eat animal cadavers by first ripping out the digestive system, which is the softest part of the anatomy, and they often reside in the resulting cavity while they are eating.

On average, devils eat about 15% of their body weight each day, although they can eat up to 40% of their body weight in 30 minutes if the opportunity arises. This means they can become very heavy and lethargic after a large meal; in this state they tend to waddle away slowly and lie down, becoming easy to approach. This has led to a belief that such eating habits became possible due to the lack of a predator to attack such bloated individuals.

Tasmanian devils can eliminate all traces of a carcass of a smaller animal, devouring the bones and fur if desired. In this respect, devils have earned the gratitude of Tasmanian farmers, as the speed at which they clean a carcass helps prevent the spread of insects that might otherwise harm livestock. Some of these dead animals are disposed of when the devils haul off the excess feed back to their residence to continue eating at a later time.

The diet of a devil can vary substantially for males and females, and seasonally, according to studies at Cradle Mountain. In winter, males prefer medium mammals over larger ones, with a ratio of 4:5, but in summer, they prefer larger prey in a 7:2 ratio. These two categories accounted for more than 95% of the diet. Females are less inclined to target large prey, but have the same seasonal bias. In winter, large and medium mammals account for 25% and 58% each, with 7% small mammals and 10% birds. In summer, the first two categories account for 61% and 37% respectively.

Juvenile devils are sometimes known to climb trees; in addition to small vertebrates and invertebrates, juveniles climb trees to eat grubs and birds&#x27; eggs. Juveniles have also been observed climbing into nests and capturing birds. Throughout the year, adult devils derive 16.2% of their biomass intake from arboreal species, almost all of which is possum meat, just 1.0% being large birds. From February to July, subadult devils derive 35.8% of their biomass intake from arboreal life, 12.2% being small birds and 23.2% being possums. Female devils in winter source 40.0% of their intake from arboreal species, including 26.7% from possums and 8.9% from various birds. Not all of these animals were caught while they were in trees, but this high figure for females, which is higher than for male spotted-tailed quolls during the same season, is unusual, as the devil has inferior tree climbing skills.
Although they hunt alone, there have been unsubstantiated claims of communal hunting, where one devil drives prey out of its habitat and an accomplice attacks. Eating is a social event for the Tasmanian devil. This combination of a solitary animal that eats communally makes the devil unique among carnivores. Much of the noise attributed to the animal is a result of raucous communal eating, at which up to 12 individuals can gather, although groups of two to five are common; it can often be heard several kilometres away. This has been interpreted as notifications to colleagues to share in the meal, so that food is not wasted by rot and energy is saved. The amount of noise is correlated to the size of the carcass. The devils eat in accordance with a system. Juveniles are active at dusk, so they tend to reach the source before the adults. Typically, the dominant animal eats until it is satiated and leaves, fighting off any challengers in the meantime. Defeated animals run into the bush with their hair and tail erect, their conqueror in pursuit and biting their victim&#x27;s rear where possible. Disputes are less common as the food source increases as the motive appears to be getting sufficient food rather than oppressing other devils. When quolls are eating a carcass, devils will tend to chase them away. This is a substantial problem for spotted-tailed quolls, as they kill relatively large possums and cannot finish their meal before devils arrive. In contrast, the smaller eastern quolls prey on much smaller victims, and can complete feeding before devils turn up. This is seen as a possible reason for the relatively small population of spotted-tailed quolls.

A study of feeding devils identified twenty physical postures, including their characteristic vicious yawn, and eleven different vocal sounds, including clicks, shrieks and various types of growls, that devils use to communicate as they feed. They usually establish dominance by sound and physical posturing, although fighting does occur. The white patches on the devil are visible to the night-vision of its colleagues. Chemical gestures are also used. Adult males are the most aggressive, and scarring is common. They can also stand on their hind legs and push each other&#x27;s shoulders with their front legs and heads, similar to sumo wrestling. Torn flesh around the mouth and teeth, as well as punctures in the rump, can sometimes be observed, although these can also be inflicted during breeding fights.

Digestion is very fast in dasyurids and, for the Tasmanian devil, the few hours taken for food to pass through the small gut is a long period in comparison to some other dasyuridae. Devils are known to return to the same places to defecate, and to do so at a communal location, called a &quot;devil latrine&quot;. It is believed that the communal defecation may be a means of communication that is not well understood. Devil scats are very large compared to body size; they are on average long, but there have been samples that are in length. They are characteristically grey in colour due to digested bones, or have bone fragments included.

Owen and Pemberton believe that the relationship between Tasmanian devils and thylacines was &quot;close and complex&quot;, as they competed directly for prey and probably also for shelter. The thylacines preyed on the devils, the devils scavenged from the thylacine&#x27;s kills, and the devils ate thylacine young. Menna Jones hypothesises that the two species shared the role of apex predator in Tasmania. Wedge-tailed eagles have a similar carrion-based diet to the devils and are regarded as competitors. Quolls and devils are also seen as being in direct competition in Tasmania. Jones believed that the quoll has evolved into its current state in just 100–200 generations of around two years as determined by the equal spacing effect on the devil, the largest species, the spotted-tail quoll, and the smallest species, the eastern quoll. Both the Tasmanian devil and the quolls appears to have evolved up to 50 times faster than the average evolutionary rate amongst mammals.

===Reproduction===

Females start to breed when they reach sexual maturity, typically in their second year. At this point, they become fertile once a year, producing multiple ova while in heat. As prey is most abundant in spring and early summer, the devil&#x27;s reproductive cycle starts in March or April so that the end of the weaning period coincides with the maximisation of food supplies in the wild for the newly roaming young devils.

Occurring in March, mating takes places in sheltered locations during both day and night. Males fight over females in the breeding season, and female devils will mate with the dominant male. Females can ovulate up to three times in a 21-day period, and copulation can take five days; one instance of a couple being in the mating den for eight days has been recorded. Devils are not monogamous, and females will mate with several males if not guarded after mating; males also reproduce with several females during a season. Females have been shown to be selective in an attempt to ensure the best genetic offspring, for example, fighting off the advances of smaller males. Males often keep their mates in custody in the den, or take them along if they need to drink, lest they engage in infidelity.

Males can produce up to 16 offspring over their lifetime, while females average four mating seasons and 12 offspring. Theoretically this means that a devil population can double on an annual basis and make the species insulated against high mortality. The pregnancy rate is high; 80% of two-year-old females were observed with newborns in their pouches during the mating season. More recent studies of breeding place the mating season between February and June, as opposed to between February and March.

Gestation lasts 21 days, and devils give birth to 20–30 young standing up, each weighing approximately . Embryonic diapause does not occur. At birth, the front limb has well-developed digits with claws; unlike many marsupials, the claws of baby devils are not deciduous. As with most other marsupials, the forelimb is longer () than the rear limb (), the eyes are spots, and the body is pink. There are no external ears or openings. Unusually, the sex can be determined at birth, with an external scrotum present.

Tasmanian devil young are variously called &quot;pups&quot;, &quot;joeys&quot;, or &quot;imps&quot;. When the young are born, competition is fierce as they move from the vagina in a sticky flow of mucus to the pouch. Once inside the pouch, they each remain attached to a nipple for the next 100 days. The female Tasmanian devil&#x27;s pouch, like that of the wombat, opens to the rear, so it is physically difficult for the female to interact with young inside the pouch. Despite the large litter at birth, the female has only four nipples, so there are never more than four babies nursing in the pouch, and the older a female devil gets, the smaller her litters will become. Once the young have made contact with the nipple, it expands, resulting in the oversized nipple being firmly clamped inside the newborn and ensuring that the newborn does not fall out of the pouch. On average, more females survive than males, and up to 60% of young do not survive to maturity. Milk replacements are often used for devils that have been bred in captivity, for orphaned devils or young who are born to diseased mothers. Little is known about the composition of the devil&#x27;s milk compared to other marsupials.

Inside the pouch, the nourished young develop quickly. In the second week, the rhinarium becomes distinctive and heavily pigmented. At 15 days, the external parts of the ear are visible, although these are attached to the head and do not open out until the devil is around 10 weeks old. The ear begins blackening after around 40 days, when it is less than long, and by the time the ear becomes erect, it is between . Eyelids are apparent at 16 days, whiskers at 17 days, and the lips at 20 days. The devils can make squeaking noises after eight weeks, and after around 10–11 weeks, the lips can open. Despite the formation of eyelids, they do not open for three months, although eyelashes form at around 50 days. The young—up to this point they are pink—start to grow fur at 49 days and have a full coat by 90 days. The fur growing process starts at the snout and proceeds back through the body, although the tail attains fur before the rump, which is the last part of the body to become covered. Just before the start of the furring process, the colour of the bare devil&#x27;s skin will darken and become black or dark grey in the tail.
The devils have a complete set of facial vibrissae and ulnar carpels, although it is devoid of vibrissae. During the third week, the and ulnarcarpals are the first to form. Subsequently, the , interramal, and submental vibrissae form. The last four typically occur between the 26th and 39th day. Their eyes open shortly after their fur coat develops—between 87 and 93 days—and their mouths can relax their hold of the nipple at 100 days. They leave the pouch 105 days after birth, appearing as small copies of the parent and weighing around . Zoologist Eric Guiler recorded its size at this time as follows: a crown-snout length of , tail length of , pes length , manus , shank , forearm and crown-rump length is . During this period, the devils lengthen at a roughly linear rate.

After being ejected, the devils stay outside the pouch, but they remain in the den for around another three months, first venturing outside the den between October and December before becoming independent in January. During this transitional phase out of the pouch, the young devils are relatively safe from predation as they are generally accompanied. When the mother is hunting they can stay inside a shelter or come along, often riding on their mother&#x27;s back. During this time they continue to drink their mother&#x27;s milk. Female devils are occupied with raising their young for all but approximately six weeks of the year. The milk contains a higher amount of iron than the milk of placental mammals. In Guiler&#x27;s 1970 study, no females died while rearing their offspring in the pouch. After leaving the pouch, the devils grow by around a month until they are six months old. While most pups will survive to be weaned, Guiler reported that up to three fifths of devils do not reach maturity. As juveniles are more crepuscular than adults, their appearance in the open during summer gives the impression to humans of a population boom. A study into the success of translocated devils that were orphaned and raised in captivity found that young devils who had consistently engaged with new experiences while they were in captivity survived better than young who had not.

==Conservation status==

The cause of the devil&#x27;s disappearance from the mainland is unclear, but their decline seems to coincide with an abrupt change in climate and the expansion across the mainland of indigenous Australians and dingoes. However, whether it was direct hunting by people, competition with dingoes, changes brought about by the increasing human population, who by 3000 years ago were using all habitat types across the continent, or a combination of all three, is unknown; devils had coexisted with dingoes on the mainland for around 3000 years. Brown has also proposed that the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) grew stronger during the Holocene, and that the devil, as a scavenger with a short life span, was highly sensitive to this. In dingo-free Tasmania, carnivorous marsupials were still active when Europeans arrived. The extermination of the thylacine after the arrival of the Europeans is well known, but the Tasmanian devil was threatened as well.

Habitat disruption can expose dens where mothers raise their young. This increases mortality, as the mother leaves the disturbed den with her pups clinging to her back, making them more vulnerable. Cancer in general is a common cause of death in devils. In 2008, high levels of potentially carcinogenic flame retardant chemicals were found in Tasmanian devils. Preliminary results of tests ordered by the Tasmanian government on chemicals found in fat tissue from 16 devils have revealed high levels of hexabromobiphenyl (BB153) and &quot;reasonably high&quot; levels of decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE209). The Save the Tasmanian Devil Appeal is the official fundraising entity for the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program. The priority is to ensure the survival of the Tasmanian devil in the wild.

===Population declines===
At least two major population declines, possibly due to disease epidemics, have occurred in recorded history: in 1909 and 1950. The devil was also reported as scarce in the 1850s. It is difficult to estimate the size of the devil population. In the mid-1990s, the population was estimated at 130,000–150,000 animals, but this is likely to have been an overestimate. The Tasmanian devil&#x27;s population has been calculated in 2008 by Tasmania&#x27;s Department of Primary Industries and Water as being in the range of 10,000 to 100,000 individuals, with 20,000 to 50,000 mature individuals being likely. Experts estimate that the devil has suffered a more than 80% decline in its population since the mid-1990s and that only around 10,000–15,000 remain in the wild as of 2008.

The species was listed as vulnerable under the Tasmanian &quot;Threatened Species Protection Act 1995&quot; in 2005 and the Australian &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot; in 2006, which means that it is at risk of extinction in the &quot;medium term&quot;. The IUCN classified the Tasmanian devil in the lower risk/least concern category in 1996, but in 2009 they reclassified it as endangered. Appropriate wildlife refuges such as Savage River National Park in North West Tasmania provide hope for their survival.

===Culling===
The first European Tasmanian settlers ate Tasmanian devil, which they described as tasting like veal. As it was believed devils would hunt and kill livestock, possibly due to strong imagery of packs of devils eating weak sheep, a bounty scheme to remove the devil from rural properties was introduced as early as 1830. However, Guiler&#x27;s research contended that the real cause of livestock losses was poor land management policies and feral dogs. In areas where the devil is now absent, poultry has continued to be killed by quolls. In earlier times, hunting possums and wallabies for fur was a big business—more than 900,000 animals were hunted in 1923—and this resulted in a continuation of bounty hunting of devils as they were thought to be a major threat to the fur industry, even though quolls were more adept at hunting the animals in question. Over the next 100 years, trapping and poisoning brought them to the brink of extinction.

After the death of the last thylacine in 1936, the Tasmanian devil was protected by law in June 1941 and the population slowly recovered. In the 1950s, with reports of increasing numbers, some permits to capture devils were granted after complaints of livestock damage. In 1966, poisoning permits were issued although attempts to have the animal unprotected failed. During this time environmentalists also became more outspoken, particularly as scientific studies provided new data suggesting the threat of devils to livestock had been vastly exaggerated. Numbers may have peaked in the early 1970s after a population boom; in 1975 they were reported to be lower, possibly due to overpopulation and consequent lack of food. Another report of overpopulation and livestock damage was reported in 1987. The following year, &quot;Trichinella spiralis&quot;, a parasite which kills animals and can infect humans, was found in devils and minor panic broke out before scientists assured the public that 30% of devils had it but that they could not transmit it to other species. Control permits were ended in the 1990s, but illegal killing continues to a limited extent, albeit &quot;locally intense&quot;. This is not considered a substantial problem for the survival of the devil. Approximately 10,000 devils were killed per year in the mid-1990s. A selective culling program has taken place to remove individuals affected with DFTD, and has been shown to not slow the rate of disease progression or reduced the number of animals dying. A model has been tested to find out whether culling devils infected with DFTD would assist in the survival of the species, and it has found that culling would not be a suitable strategy to employ.

===Road mortality===

Motor vehicles are a threat to localised populations of non-abundant Tasmanian mammals, and a 2010 study showed that devils were particularly vulnerable. A study of nine species, mostly marsupials of a similar size, showed that devils were more difficult for drivers to detect and avoid. At high beam, devils had the lowest detection distance, 40% closer than the median. This requires a 20% reduction in speed for a motorist to avoid the devil. For low beam, the devils had the second shortest detection distance, 16% below the median. For avoidance of roadkill to be feasible, motorists would have to drive at around half the current speed limit in rural areas. A study in the 1990s on a localised population of devils in a national park in Tasmania recorded a halving of the population after a hitherto gravel access road was upgraded, surfaced with bitumen and widened. At the same time, there was a large increase in deaths caused by vehicles along the new road; there had been none in the preceding six months.

The vast majority of deaths occurred in the sealed portion of the road, believed to be due to an increase in speeds. It was also conjectured that the animals were harder to see against the dark bitumen instead of the light gravel. The devil and quoll are especially vulnerable as they often try to retrieve roadkill for food and travel along the road. To alleviate the problem, traffic slowing measures, man-made pathways that offer alternative routes for devils, education campaigns, and the installation of light reflectors to indicate oncoming vehicles have been implemented. They are credited with decreases in roadkill. Devils have often been victims of roadkill when they are retrieving other roadkill. Work by scientist Menna Jones and a group of conservation volunteers to remove dead animals from the road resulted in a significant reduction in devil traffic deaths. It was estimated that 3,392 devils, or 3.8–5.7% of the population, were being killed annually by vehicles in 2001–2004. In 2009, the Save the Tasmanian Devil group launched the &quot;Roadkill Project&quot;, which allowed members of the public to report sightings of devils which had been killed on the road. On 25 September 2015, 20 immunised devils were microchipped and released in Narawntapu National Park. By 5 October four had been hit by cars, prompting Samantha Fox, leader of Save the Tasmanian Devil, to describe roadkill as being the biggest threat to the Tasmanian devil after DFTD. A series of solar-powered alarms have been trialled that make noises and flash lights when cars are approaching, warning the animals. The trial ran for 18 months and the trial area had two-thirds less deaths than the control.

===Devil facial tumour disease===
First seen in 1996 in Mount William in northeastern Tasmania, devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) has ravaged Tasmania&#x27;s wild devils, and estimates of the impact range from 20% to as much as an 80% decline in the devil population, with over 65% of the state affected. The state&#x27;s west coast area and far north-west are the only places where devils are tumour free. Individual devils die within months of infection. The disease is an example of transmissible cancer, which means that it is contagious and passed from one animal to another. This tumour is able to pass between hosts without inducing a response from the host&#x27;s immune system. Dominant devils who engage in more biting behaviour are more exposed to the disease.

Wild Tasmanian devil populations are being monitored to track the spread of the disease and to identify changes in disease prevalence. Field monitoring involves trapping devils within a defined area to check for the presence of the disease and determine the number of affected animals. The same area is visited repeatedly to characterise the spread of the disease over time. So far, it has been established that the short-term effects of the disease in an area can be severe. Long-term monitoring at replicated sites will be essential to assess whether these effects remain, or whether populations can recover. Field workers are also testing the effectiveness of disease suppression by trapping and removing diseased devils. It is hoped that the removal of diseased devils from wild populations should decrease disease prevalence and allow more devils to survive beyond their juvenile years and breed. In March 2017, scientists at the University of Tasmania presented an apparent first report of having successfully treated Tasmanian devils with the disease. Live cancer cells that were treated with IFN-γ to restore MHC-I expression, were injected into the infected devils to stimulate their immune system to recognise and fight the disease. In 2020 it was reported that one of the last DFTD-free wild population of Tasmanian devils was suffering from inbreeding depression and has undergone a significant decline in reproductive success in recent years.

==Relationship with humans==
At Lake Nitchie in western New South Wales in 1970, a male human skeleton wearing a necklace of 178 teeth from 49 different devils was found. The skeleton is estimated to be 7000 years old, and the necklace is believed to be much older than the skeleton. Archaeologist Josephine Flood believes the devil was hunted for its teeth and that this contributed to its extinction on mainland Australia. Owen and Pemberton note that few such necklaces have been found. Middens that contain devil bones are rare—two notable examples are Devil&#x27;s Lair in the south-western part of Western Australia and Tower Hill in Victoria. In Tasmania, local Indigenous Australians and devils sheltered in the same caves. Tasmanian Aboriginal names for the devil recorded by Europeans include &quot;tarrabah&quot;, &quot;poirinnah&quot;, and &quot;par-loo-mer-rer&quot;. Variations also exist, such as &quot;Taraba&quot; and &quot;purinina&quot;.

It is a common belief that devils will eat humans. While they are known to eat dead bodies, there are prevalent myths that they eat living humans who wander into the bush. Despite outdated beliefs and exaggerations regarding their disposition, many, although not all, devils will remain still when in the presence of a human; some will also shake nervously. They can bite and scratch out of fear when held by a human, but a firm grip will cause them to remain still. Although they can be tamed, they are asocial, and are not considered appropriate as pets; they have an unpleasant odour, and neither demonstrate nor respond to affection.

Until recently, the devil was not studied much by academics and naturalists. At the start of the 20th century, Hobart zoo operator Mary Roberts, who was not a trained scientist, was credited for changing people&#x27;s attitudes and encouraging scientific interest in native animals (such as the devil) that were seen as fearsome and abhorrent, and the human perception of the animal changed. Theodore Thomson Flynn was the first professor of biology in Tasmania, and carried out some research during the period around World War I. In the mid-1960s, Professor Guiler assembled a team of researchers and started a decade of systematic fieldwork on the devil. This is seen as the start of modern scientific study of it. However, the devil was still negatively depicted, including in tourism material. The first doctorate awarded for research into the devil came in 1991.

===In captivity===

Early attempts to breed Tasmanian devils in captivity had limited success. Mary Roberts bred a pair at Beaumaris Zoo (which she named Billy and Truganini) in 1913. However, although advised to remove Billy, Roberts found Truganini too distressed by his absence, and returned him. The first litter was presumed eaten by Billy, but a second litter in 1914 survived, after Billy was removed. Roberts wrote an article on keeping and breeding the devils for the London Zoological Society. Even by 1934, successful breeding of the devil was rare. In a study on the growth of young devils in captivity, some developmental stages were very different from those reported by Guiler. The pinnae were free on day 36, and eyes opened later, on days 115–121. In general, females tend to retain more stress after being taken into captivity than males.

Tasmanian devils were displayed in various zoos around the world from the 1850s onwards. In the 1950s several animals were given to European zoos. In October 2005 the Tasmanian government sent four devils, two male and two female, to the Copenhagen Zoo, following the birth of the first son of King Frederik X of Denmark and his Tasmanian-born wife Mary. Due to restrictions on their export by the Australian government, at the time these were the only devils known to be living outside Australia. In June 2013, due to the successes of the insurance population program, it was planned to send devils to other zoos around the world in a pilot program. San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance and Albuquerque Biopark were selected to participate in the program, and Wellington Zoo and Auckland Zoo soon followed. In the United States, four additional zoos have since been selected as part of the Australian government&#x27;s Save the Tasmanian Devil program, the zoos selected were: the Fort Wayne Children&#x27;s Zoo, the Los Angeles Zoo, the Saint Louis Zoo, and the Toledo Zoo. Captive devils are usually forced to stay awake during the day to cater to visitors, rather than following their natural nocturnal style.

===In popular culture===

The devil is an iconic animal within Australia, and particularly associated with Tasmania. The animal is used as the emblem of the Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Service, and the former Tasmanian Australian rules football team which played in the Victorian Football League was known as the Devils. The Hobart Devils were once part of the National Basketball League. The devil has appeared on several commemorative coins in Australia over the years. Cascade Brewery in Tasmania sells a ginger beer with a Tasmanian devil on the label. In 2015, the Tasmanian devil was chosen as Tasmania&#x27;s state emblem.

Tasmanian devils are popular with tourists, and the director of the Tasmanian Devil Conservation Park has described their possible extinction as &quot;a really significant blow for Australian and Tasmanian tourism&quot;. There has also been a multimillion-dollar proposal to build a giant 19 m-high, 35 m-long devil in Launceston in northern Tasmania as a tourist attraction. Devils began to be used as ecotourism in the 1970s, when studies showed that the animals were often the only things known about Tasmania overseas, and suggested that they should therefore be the centrepiece of marketing efforts, resulting in some devils being taken on promotional tours.

The Tasmanian devil is probably best known internationally as the inspiration for the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon character the Tasmanian Devil, or &quot;Taz&quot; in 1954. Little known at the time, the loud hyperactive cartoon character has little in common with the real life animal. After a few shorts between 1957 and 1964, the character was retired until the 1990s, when he gained his own show, &quot;Taz-Mania&quot;, and again became popular. In 1997, a newspaper report noted that Warner Bros. had &quot;trademarked the character and registered the name Tasmanian Devil&quot;, and that this trademark &quot;was policed&quot;, including an eight-year legal case to allow a Tasmanian company to call a fishing lure &quot;Tasmanian Devil&quot;. Debate followed, and a delegation from the Tasmanian government met with Warner Bros. Ray Groom, the Tourism Minister, later announced that a &quot;verbal agreement&quot; had been reached. An annual fee would be paid to Warner Bros. in return for the Government of Tasmania being able to use the image of Taz for &quot;marketing purposes&quot;. This agreement later disappeared. In 2006, Warner Bros. permitted the Government of Tasmania to sell stuffed toys of Taz with profits funnelled into research on DFTD.

<text>In Christian eschatology, the Great Tribulation () is a period mentioned by Jesus in the Olivet Discourse as a sign that would occur in the time of the end.

At , &quot;the Great Tribulation&quot; () is used to indicate the period spoken of by Jesus. uses &quot;tribulation&quot; (θλίβω) in a context denoting afflictions of those hard-pressed by siege and the calamities of war.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;Great Tribulation&quot; occurs four times in the New Testament: , , , and . Some take the words of Jesus in Matthew 24:21 to be describing a period of intense persecution and tribulation at the end of the age, prior to Jesus&#x27;s return.

==Views==
Christians disagree over whether the Tribulation will be a relatively short period of great hardship before the end of the world and Second Coming of Christ (a school of thought sometimes called &quot;Futurism&quot;); or has already occurred, having happened in AD 70 when Roman legions laid siege to Jerusalem and destroyed its temple (sometimes called Preterism); or began in 538 AD when papal Rome came to power—popes being anti-Christs—and will intensify shortly before the end of the world, (sometimes called &quot;Historicism&quot;).

===Futurism===
In the futurist view of Christian eschatology, the Great Tribulation is a relatively short period of time where everyone will experience worldwide hardships, persecution, disasters, famine, war, pain, and suffering, which will affect all of creation, and precede judgment of all when the Second Coming takes place. Some pretribulationists believe that those who choose to follow God will be raptured before the tribulation, and thus escape it. On the other hand, posttribulationists believe Christians who are alive at the time of the Great Tribulation must endure the Great Tribulation and will receive great blessings.

According to dispensationalists, the Tribulation is thought to occur before the Second Coming of Jesus and during the End Times. In this view, the Tribulation will last seven prophetic Hebrew years (lasting 360 days each) in all, but the Great Tribulation will be the second half of the Tribulation period.

In this view, this seven-year period is considered to be the final week of Daniel&#x27;s Prophecy of Seventy Weeks, found in Daniel chapter 9. It is theorized that each week represents seven years, with the timetable beginning from Artaxerxes&#x27; order to rebuild the Second Temple in Jerusalem. After seven weeks and 62 weeks, the prophecy says that the messiah will be &quot;cut off&quot;, which is taken to correspond to the death of Christ. This is seen as creating a break of indeterminate length in the timeline, with one week remaining to be fulfilled.

The time period for these beliefs is also based on other passages: in the Book of Daniel, &quot;time, times, and half a time&quot;, interpreted as &quot;three and a half years,&quot; and the Book of Revelation, &quot;a thousand two hundred and threescore days&quot; and &quot;forty and two months&quot; (the prophetic month averaging 30 days, hence 1260/30 = 42 months or 3.5 years). The 1290 days of , (rather than the 1260 days of ), is thought to be the result of either a simple intercalary leap month adjustment, or due to further calculations related to the prophecy, or due to an intermediate stage of time that is to prepare the world for the beginning of the millennial reign.

====Events====
Among Futurists there are differing views about what will happen to Christians during the Tribulation:
* Pretribulationists believe that all righteous Christians (deceased and living) will be taken bodily up to Heaven (called the Rapture) before the Tribulation begins. According to this belief, every true Christian that has ever existed throughout the course of the entire Christian era will be instantaneously transformed into a perfect resurrected body, and will thus escape the trials of the Tribulation. Those who become Christians after the rapture will live through (or perish during) the Tribulation. After the Tribulation, Christ will return to establish his Millennial Kingdom.
* Prewrathers believe the rapture will occur during the Tribulation, at some unknown time in the second half of the 70th week of Daniel, but before the seven trumpets and seven bowls of the wrath of God. Thus the rapture cuts short the Tribulation and initiates the wrath of God.
* Midtribulationists believe that the rapture will occur halfway through the Tribulation, but before the worst part of it occurs. The seven-year period is divided into halves—the &quot;beginning of sorrows&quot; and the &quot;Great Tribulation&quot;.
* Posttribulationists believe that Christians will not be taken up into Heaven for eternity, but will be received or gathered in the air by Christ, to descend together to establish the Kingdom of God on earth at the end of the Tribulation.

In pretribulationism and midtribulationism, the rapture and the Second Coming of Christ are separate events, while in post-tribulationism the two events are identical or simultaneous. Another feature of the pre- and mid-tribulation beliefs is the idea that after the rapture, Christ will return for a third time (when also counting the first coming) to set up his kingdom on the earth.

The Catholic Church teaches that there will be a &quot;final Passover&quot; or last &quot;purgatory&quot; before the final parousia (Second Coming), in which the church will &quot;pass through a final fire that will shake the faith of many&quot;. Generally neither the Catholic Church, the various Orthodox and Anglican communions, nor the older Protestant denominations use the term &quot;rapture&quot;, and tend toward amillennialism. In this view, the millennium is regarded as the initial period of Christ&#x27;s reign (manifested in the life and activity of the church) that began with the Pentecost and will lead up to the messiah&#x27;s eventual return, with the outcome being a single and permanent event at the end of present time.

===Preterism===
In the Preterist view, the Tribulation took place in the past when Roman legions destroyed Jerusalem and its temple in AD 70 during the end stages of the First Jewish–Roman War, and it only affected the Jewish people rather than all mankind.

Christian preterists believe that the Tribulation was a divine judgment visited upon the Jews for their sins, including rejection of Jesus as the promised Messiah. It occurred entirely in the past, around AD 70 when the armed forces of the Roman Empire destroyed Jerusalem and its temple.

A preterist discussion of the Tribulation has its focus on the Gospels, in particular the prophetic passages in Matthew 24, Mark 13 and Luke 21, rather than on the Apocalypse or Book of Revelation. (Preterists apply much of the symbolism in the Revelation to Rome, the Cæsars, and their persecution of Christians, rather than to the Tribulation upon the Jews.)

Jesus&#x27; warning in Matthew 24:34 that &quot;this generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled&quot; is tied back to his similar warning to the Scribes and the Pharisees that their judgment would &quot;come upon this generation&quot;, that is, during the first century rather than at a future time long after the Scribes and Pharisees had died. The destruction in AD 70 occurred within a 40-year generation from the time when Jesus gave that discourse.

The judgment on the Jewish nation was executed by the Roman legions, &quot;the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet.&quot;

Since Matthew 24 begins with Jesus visiting the Jerusalem Temple and pronouncing that &quot;there shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down&quot; (vs. 3), preterists see nothing in Scripture to indicate that another Jewish temple will ever be built. The prophecies were all fulfilled on the then-existing temple that Jesus spoke about and that was subsequently destroyed within that generation.

===Historicism===
The Historicist view applies Tribulation to the period known as &quot;persecution of the saints&quot; (Daniel 7, Revelation 13). This is believed to have begun with the period after the &quot;falling away&quot; when papal Rome came to power for 1260 years from 538 to 1798 (using the day-year principle). They believe that the Tribulation is not a future event, but it intensifies right at the end to a time such as never before. Matthew&#x27;s reference to &quot;Great Tribulation&quot; as parallel to Revelation 6:12-13, will reach a point that if it was not shortened even the just would not survive.

Historicists are prone to see prophecy fulfilled down through the centuries and rather than a single Antichrist to rule the earth during a future Tribulation period, Martin Luther, John Calvin and the other Protestant Reformers saw the Antichrist as fulfilled in the papacy. The reformers like Martin Luther, John Calvin and others saw the papacy&#x27;s claim of temporal power over all secular governments and the autocratic character of the papal office as the falling away from the original faith founded by Jesus and the apostles, and challenged papal authority as it had deviated from scripture with its tradition and was a corruption from the early church.

Similarly, some modern historicists see the Tribulation on the Jews as beginning in AD 70 and continuing for centuries, covering the same time span as &quot;the times of the Gentiles&quot; during which &quot;Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gentiles.&quot; This view would have it encompass not only the death of a million Jews at the hands of the Roman legions, but also the death of six million Jews in the Holocaust.

<text>Tantra (; ) is an yogic tradition that developed on the Indian subcontinent from the middle of the 1st millennium CE onwards in both Hinduism and Buddhism. 

The term &quot;tantra&quot;, in the Indian traditions, also means any systematic broadly applicable &quot;text, theory, system, method, instrument, technique or practice&quot;. A key feature of these traditions is the use of mantras, and thus they are commonly referred to as Mantramārga (&quot;Path of Mantra&quot;) in Hinduism or Mantrayāna (&quot;Mantra Vehicle&quot;) and Guhyamantra (&quot;Secret Mantra&quot;) in Buddhism.

In Buddhism, the Vajrayana traditions are known for tantric ideas and practices, which are based on Indian Buddhist Tantras. They include Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, Chinese Esoteric Buddhism, Japanese Shingon Buddhism and Nepalese Newar Buddhism. Although Southern Esoteric Buddhism does not directly reference the tantras, its practices and ideas parallel them. In Buddhism, tantra has influenced the art and iconography of Tibetan and East Asian Buddhism, as well as historic cave temples of India and the art of Southeast Asia.

Tantric Hindu and Buddhist traditions have also influenced other Eastern religious traditions such as Jainism, the Tibetan Bön tradition, Daoism, and the Japanese Shintō tradition. Certain modes of non-Vedic worship such as Puja are considered tantric in their conception and rituals. Hindu temple building also generally conforms to the iconography of tantra. Hindu texts describing these topics are called Tantras, Āgamas or Samhitās. 

==Etymology==
Tantra () literally means &quot;loom, warp, weave&quot;. According to Padoux, the verbal root Tan means: &quot;to extend&quot;, &quot;to spread&quot;, &quot;to spin out&quot;, &quot;weave&quot;, &quot;display&quot;, &quot;put forth&quot;, and &quot;compose&quot;. Therefore, by extension, it can also mean &quot;system&quot;, &quot;doctrine&quot;, or &quot;work&quot;.

The connotation of the word &quot;tantra&quot; to mean an esoteric practice or religious ritualism is a colonial era European invention. This term is based on the metaphor of weaving, states Ron Barrett, where the Sanskrit root &quot;tan&quot; means the warping of threads on a loom. It implies &quot;interweaving of traditions and teachings as threads&quot; into a text, technique or practice.

The word appears in the hymns of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; such as in 10.71, with the meaning of &quot;warp (weaving)&quot;. It is found in many other Vedic era texts, such as in section 10.7.42 of the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot; and many Brahmanas. In these and post-Vedic texts, the contextual meaning of &quot;Tantra&quot; is that which is &quot;principal or essential part, main point, model, framework, feature&quot;. In the Smritis and epics of Hinduism (and Jainism), the term means &quot;doctrine, rule, theory, method, technique or chapter&quot; and the word appears both as a separate word and as a common suffix, such as &quot;atma-tantra&quot; meaning &quot;doctrine or theory of Atman (Self)&quot;.

The term &quot;Tantra&quot; after about 500 BCE, in Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism is a bibliographic category, just like the word Sutra (which means &quot;sewing together&quot;, mirroring the metaphor of &quot;weaving together&quot; in &quot;Tantra&quot;). The same Buddhist texts are sometimes referred to as tantra or sutra; for example, &quot;Vairocabhisambodhi-tantra&quot; is also referred to as &quot;Vairocabhisambodhi-sutra&quot;. The various contextual meanings of the word Tantra vary with the Indian text and are summarized in the appended table.
==Definition==
===Ancient and medieval era===
The 5th-century BCE scholar Pāṇini in his Sutra 1.4.54–55 of Sanskrit grammar, cryptically explains tantra through the example of &quot;Sva-tantra&quot; (Sanskrit: स्वतन्त्र), which he states means &quot;independent&quot; or a person who is his own &quot;warp, cloth, weaver, promoter, karta (actor)&quot;. Patanjali in his &quot;Mahābhāṣya&quot; quotes and accepts Panini&#x27;s definition, then discusses or mentions it at a greater length, in 18 instances, stating that its metaphorical definition of &quot;warp (weaving), extended cloth&quot; is relevant to many contexts. The word &quot;tantra&quot;, states Patanjali, means &quot;principal, main&quot;.

He uses the same example of &quot;svatantra&quot; as a composite word of &quot;sva&quot; (self) and tantra, then stating &quot;svatantra&quot; means &quot;one who is self-dependent, one who is his own master, the principal thing for whom is himself&quot;, thereby interpreting the definition of tantra. Patanjali also offers a semantic definition of Tantra, stating that it is structural rules, standard procedures, centralized guide or knowledge in any field that applies to many elements.

Starting in the early centuries of the common era, newly revealed Tantras centering on Vishnu, Shiva or Shakti emerged. There are tantric lineages in all main forms of modern Hinduism, such as the Shaiva Siddhanta tradition, the Shakta sect of Shri Vidya, the Kaula, and Kashmir Shaivism.

The ancient Mimamsa school of Hinduism uses the term tantra extensively, and its scholars offer various definitions. For example:

Medieval texts present their own definitions of Tantra. &quot;&quot;, for example, gives the following explanation of the term &quot;tantra&quot;:
===Modern era===

The occultist and businessman Pierre Bernard (1875–1955) is widely credited with introducing the philosophy and practices of tantra to the American people, at the same time creating a somewhat misleading impression of its connection to sex. That popular sexualization is more accurately regarded as the western &quot;Neo-Tantra&quot; movement.

In modern scholarship, Tantra has been studied as an esoteric practice and ritualistic religion, sometimes referred to as Tantrism. There is a wide gap between what Tantra means to its followers, and the way Tantra has been represented or perceived since colonial era writers began commenting on it. 

Many definitions of Tantra have been proposed since, and there is no universally accepted definition. André Padoux, in his review of Tantra definitions offers two, then rejects both. One definition, according to Padoux, is found among Tantra practitioners – it is any &quot;system of observances&quot; about the vision of man and the cosmos where correspondences between the inner world of the person and the macrocosmic reality play an essential role. Another definition, more common among observers and non-practitioners, is some &quot;set of mechanistic rituals, omitting entirely the ideological side&quot;.

Tantric traditions have been studied mostly from textual and historical perspectives. Anthropological work on living Tantric tradition is scarce, and ethnography has rarely engaged with the study of Tantra. This is arguably a result of the modern construction of Tantrism as occult, esoteric and secret. Some scholars have tried to demystify the myth of secrecy in contemporary Tantric traditions, suggesting new methodological avenues to overcome the ethical and epistemological problems in the study of living Tantric traditions.

According to David N. Lorenzen, two different kinds of definitions of Tantra exist, narrow and broad. According to the narrow definition, Tantrism, or &quot;Tantric religion&quot;, is the elite traditions directly based on the Sanskrit texts called the Tantras, Samhitas, and Agamas. Lorenzen&#x27;s &quot;broad definition&quot; extends this by including a broad range of &quot;magical beliefs and practices&quot; such as Yoga and Shaktism. 

The term &quot;yoga&quot; is broadly attributed to many traditions and practices, including the western assumption that yoga is synonymous with physical stretching and little more. The &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patanjali&quot; define yoga as &quot;the stilling of the disturbances of the mind&quot;. Richard Payne states that Tantra has been commonly but incorrectly associated with sex, given popular culture&#x27;s prurient obsession with intimacy. Tantra has been labelled as the &quot;yoga of ecstasy&quot;, driven by senseless ritualistic libertinism. This is far from the diverse and complex understanding of what Tantra means to those Buddhists, Hindu and Jains who practice it.

David Gray disagrees with broad generalizations and states that defining Tantra is a difficult task because &quot;Tantra traditions are manifold, spanning several religious traditions and cultural worlds. As a result they are also diverse, which makes it a significant challenge to come up with an adequate definition&quot;. The challenge of defining Tantra is compounded by the fact that it has been a historically significant part of major Indian religions, including Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, both in and outside South Asia and East Asia. To its practitioners, Tantra is defined as a combination of texts, techniques, rituals, monastic practices, meditation, yoga, and ideology.

According to Georg Feuerstein,

Hindu puja, temples and iconography all show tantric influence. These texts, states Gavin Flood, contain representation of &quot;the body in philosophy, in ritual and in art&quot;, which are linked to &quot;techniques of the body, methods or technologies developed within the tantric traditions intended to transform body and self&quot;.

====Tantrism====
The term &quot;tantrism&quot; is a 19th-century European invention not present in any Asian language; compare &quot;Sufism&quot;, of similar Orientalist origin. According to Padoux, &quot;Tantrism&quot; is a Western term and notion, not a category that is used by Tantrikas themselves. The term was introduced by 19th-century Indologists, with limited knowledge of India and in whose view Tantrism was a particular, unusual and minority practice in contrast to Indian traditions they believed to be mainstream.

Robert Brown similarly notes that &quot;tantrism&quot; is a construct of Western scholarship, not a concept of the religious system itself. He defines Tantrism as an apologetic label of Westerners for a system that they little understand that is &quot;not coherent&quot; and which is &quot;an accumulated set of practices and ideas from various sources, that has varied between its practitioners within a group, varied across groups, across geography and over its history&quot;. It is a system, adds Brown, that gives each follower the freedom to mix Tantric elements with non-Tantric aspects, to challenge and transgress any and all norms, experiment with &quot;the mundane to reach the supramundane&quot;.

Teun Goudriaan in his 1981 review of Hindu Tantrism, states that Tantrism usually means a &quot;systematic quest for salvation or spiritual excellence&quot; by realizing and fostering the divine within one&#x27;s own body, one that is simultaneous union of the masculine-feminine and spirit-matter, and has the ultimate goal of realizing the &quot;primal blissful state of non-duality&quot;. It is typically a methodically striven system, consisting of voluntarily chosen specific practices which may include Tantric items such as mantras (&quot;bijas&quot;), geometric patterns and symbols (&quot;mandala&quot;), gestures (&quot;mudra&quot;), mapping of the microcosm within one&#x27;s body to the macrocosmic elements outside as the subtle body (&quot;kundalini yoga&quot;), assignments of icons and sounds (&quot;nyasa&quot;), meditation (&quot;dhyana&quot;), ritual worship (&quot;puja&quot;), initiation (&quot;diksha&quot;) and others. Tantrism, adds Goudriaan, is a living system that is decidedly monistic, but with wide variations, and it is impossible to be dogmatic about a simple or fixed definition.

Tantrism is an overarching term for &quot;Tantric traditions&quot;, states David Gray in a 2016 review, that combine Vedic, yogic and meditative traditions from 5th-century Hinduism as well as rival Buddhist and Jain traditions. it is a neologism of western scholars and does not reflect the self-understanding of any particular tantric tradition. While Goudriaan&#x27;s description is useful, adds Gray, there is no single defining universal characteristic common to all Tantra traditions, being an open evolving system. Tantrism, whether Buddhist or Hindu, can best be characterized as practices, a set of techniques, with a strong focus on rituals and meditation, by those who believe that it is a path to liberation that is characterized by both knowledge and freedom.

====Tantrika====

According to Padoux, the term &quot;Tantrika&quot; is based on a comment by Kulluka Bhatta on &quot;Manava Dharmasastra 2.1&quot;, who contrasted &quot;vaidika&quot; and &quot;tantrika&quot; forms of Śruti (canonical texts). The Tantrika, to Bhatta, is that literature which forms a parallel part of the Hindu tradition, independent of the Vedic corpus. The Vedic and non-Vedic (Tantric) paths are seen as two different approaches to ultimate reality, the Vedic approach based on Brahman, and Tantrika being based on the non-Vedic Āgama texts. Despite Bhatta attempt to clarify, states Padoux, in reality Hindus and Buddhists have historically felt free to borrow and blend ideas from all sources, Vedic, non-Vedic and in the case of Buddhism, its own canonical works.

One of the key differences between the Tantric and non-Tantric traditions – whether it be orthodox Buddhism, Hinduism or Jainism – is their assumptions about the need for monastic or ascetic life. Non-Tantrika, or orthodox traditions in all three major ancient Indian religions, hold that the worldly life of a householder is one driven by desires and greeds which are a serious impediment to spiritual liberation (&quot;moksha&quot;, &quot;nirvana&quot;, &quot;kaivalya&quot;). These orthodox traditions teach renunciation of householder life, a mendicant&#x27;s life of simplicity and leaving all attachments to become a monk or nun. In contrast, the Tantrika traditions hold, states Robert Brown, that &quot;both enlightenment and worldly success&quot; are achievable, and that &quot;this world need not be shunned to achieve enlightenment&quot;. Yet, even this supposed categorical divergence is debatable, e.g. Bhagavad Gita v.2:48–53, including: &quot;Yoga is skill in [the performance of] actions.&quot;

==History==
===Proto-Tantric elements in Vedic religion===

The Keśin hymn of the &quot;Rig Veda&quot; (10.136) describes the &quot;wild loner&quot; who, states Karel Werner, &quot;carrying within oneself fire and poison, heaven and earth, ranging from enthusiasm and creativity to depression and agony, from the heights of spiritual bliss to the heaviness of earth-bound labor&quot;. The Rigveda uses words of admiration for these loners, and whether it is related to Tantra or not, has been variously interpreted. According to David Lorenzen, it describes &quot;munis&quot; (sages) experiencing Tantra-like &quot;ecstatic, altered states of consciousness&quot; and gaining the ability &quot;to fly on the wind&quot;. In contrast, Werner suggests that these are early Yoga pioneers and accomplished yogis of the ancient pre-Buddhist Indian tradition, and that this Vedic hymn is speaking of those &quot;lost in thoughts&quot; whose &quot;personalities are not bound to earth, for they follow the path of the mysterious wind&quot;.

The two oldest Upanishadic scriptures of Hinduism, the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; in section 4.2 and &quot;Chandogya Upanishad&quot; in section 8.6, refer to nadis (&quot;hati&quot;) in presenting their theory on how the Atman (Self) and the body are connected and interdependent through energy carrying arteries when one is awake or sleeping, but they do not mention anything related to Tantric practices. The &quot;Shvetashvatara Upanishad&quot; describes breath control that became a standard part of Yoga, but Tantric practices do not appear in it. Likewise, the &quot;Taittiriya Upanishad&quot; discusses a central channel running through the body and various Vedic texts mention the bodily pranas (vital breaths) that move around in the body and animate it. However, the idea of consciously moving the bodily pranas through yoga is not found in these sources. According to Lorenzen, Vedic ideas related to the body later diversified into the &quot;mystical anatomy&quot; of &quot;nadis&quot; and &quot;chakras&quot; found in Tantra. The yogic component of Tantrism appears clearly in Bāṇabhaṭṭa&#x27;s &quot;Harshacharita&quot; and Daṇḍin&#x27;s &quot;Dashakumaracharita&quot;. In contrast to this theory of Lorenzen, other scholars such as Mircea Eliade consider Yoga and the evolution of Yogic practices to be separate and distinct from the evolution of Tantra and Tantric practices.

According to Geoffrey Samuel, the inner development of a spiritual energy called tapas becomes a central element of Vedic religion in the Brahmanas and Srauta texts. In these texts, ascetic practices allow a holy man to build up tapas, a kind of magical inner heat, which allows them to perform all sorts of magical feats as well as granting visions and divine revelations. Samuel also notes that in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, one of the commonest use of the term &quot;yoga&quot; refers to &quot;a dying warrior transferring himself at death to the sphere of the sun through yoga, a practice that links up with Upanisadic references to the channel to the crown of the head as the pathway by which one can travel through the solar orb to the World of Brahman.&quot; This practice of transferring one&#x27;s consciousness at death is still an important practice in Tibetan Buddhism. Samuel also notes that sexual rituals and a spiritualized sexuality are mentioned in the late Upanishads. According to Samuel, &quot;late Vedic texts treat sexual intercourse as symbolically equivalent to the Vedic sacrifice, and ejaculation of semen as the offering.&quot; This theme can be found in the &quot;Jaiminiya Brahmana&quot;, the &quot;Chandogya Upanisad&quot;, and the &quot;Brhadaranyaka Upanisad&quot;. The &quot;Brhadaranyaka&quot; contains various sexual rituals and practices which are mostly aimed at obtaining a child which are concerned with the loss of male virility and power.

David Gordon White views Yogini cults as foundational to early tantra but disagrees with scholars who maintain that the roots of such cults lie in an &quot;autochthonous non-Vedic source&quot; such as indigenous tribes or the Indus Valley civilization. Instead, White suggests Vedic Srauta texts mention offerings to goddesses Rākā, Sinīvālī, and Kuhū in a manner similar to a tantric ritual. Frederick Smith – a professor of Sanskrit and Classical Indian Religions, considers Tantra to be a religious movement parallel to the Bhakti movement of the 1st millennium AD. Tantra along with Ayurveda, states Smith, has traditionally been attributed to &quot;Atharvaveda&quot;, but this attribution is one of respect not of historicity. Ayurveda has primarily been an empirical practice with Vedic roots, but Tantra has been an esoteric, folk movement without grounding that can be traced to anything in &quot;Atharvaveda&quot; or any other vedic text.

===Proto-Tantric elements in Buddhism===

Pre-tantric Buddhism contains elements which could be seen as proto-tantric, and which may have influenced the development of the Buddhist Tantric tradition. The use of magical chants or incantations can be found in the early Buddhist texts as well as in some Mahayana sutras. These magical spells or chants were used for various reasons, such as for protection, and for the generation of auspiciousness. Mahayana incantations are called dhāraṇīs. Some Mahayana sutras incorporate the use of mantras, a central feature of tantric practice.

According to Geoffrey Samuel, sramana groups like the Buddhists and Jains were associated with the dead. Samuel notes that they &quot;frequently settled at sites associated with the dead and seem to have taken over a significant role in relation to the spirits of the dead.&quot; To step into this realm required entering a dangerous and impure supernatural realm from the Indian perspective. This association with death remains a feature of modern Buddhism, and in Buddhist countries today, Buddhist monks and other ritual specialists are in charge of the dead. Thus, the association of tantric practitioners with charnel grounds and death imagery is preceded by early Buddhist contact with these sites of the dead.

Some scholars think that the development of tantra may have been influenced by the cults of nature spirit-deities like Yakṣas and Nagas. Yakṣa cults were an important part of early Buddhism. Yakṣas are powerful nature spirits which were sometimes seen as guardians or protectors. Yakṣas like Kubera are also associated with magical incantations. Kubera is said to have provided the Buddhist sangha with protection spells in the &quot;Āṭānāṭiya Sutta&quot;. These spirit deities also included numerous female deities (yakṣiṇī) that can be found depicted in major Buddhist sites like Sanchi and Bharhut. In early Buddhist texts there is also mention of fierce demon like deities called rākṣasa and rākṣasī, like the children-eating Hārītī. They are also present in Mahayana texts, such as in Chapter 26 of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; which includes a dialogue between the Buddha and a group of rākṣasīs, who swear to uphold and protect the sutra. These figures also teach magical dhāraṇīs to protect followers of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;.

A key element of Buddhist Tantric practice is the visualization of deities in meditation. This practice is actually found in pre-tantric Buddhist texts as well. In Mahayana sutras like the &quot;Pratyutpanna Samādhi&quot; and the three Amitabha Pure land sutras. There are other Mahāyāna sutras which contain what may be called &quot;proto-tantric&quot; material such as the &quot;Gandavyuha&quot; and the &quot;Dasabhumika&quot; which might have served as a source for the imagery found in later Tantric texts. According to Samuel, the &quot;Golden Light Sutra&quot; (c. 5th century at the latest) contains what could be seen as a proto-mandala. In the second chapter, a bodhisattva has a vision of &quot;a vast building made of beryl and with divine jewels and celestial perfumes. Four lotus-seats appear in the four directions, with four Buddhas seated upon them: Aksobhya in the East, Ratnaketu in the South, Amitayus in the West and Dundubhīśvara in the North.&quot;

A series of artwork discovered in Gandhara, in modern-day Pakistan, dating from about the 1st century CE, show Buddhist and Hindu monks holding skulls. The legend corresponding to these artworks is found in Buddhist texts, and describes monks &quot;who tap skulls and forecast the future rebirths of the person to whom that skull belonged&quot;. According to Robert Brown, these Buddhist skull-tapping reliefs suggest that tantric practices may have been in vogue by the 1st century CE.

===Proto-Tantric elements in Shaktism and Shaivism===
The &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the &quot;Harivamsa&quot;, and the &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot; in the &quot;Markandeya Purana&quot; all mention the fierce, demon-killing manifestations of the Great Goddess, Mahishamardini, identified with Durga-Parvati. These suggest that Shaktism, reverence and worship for the Goddess in Indian culture, was an established tradition by the early centuries of the 1st millennium. Padoux mentions an inscription from 423 to 424 CE which mentions the founding of a temple to terrifying deities called &quot;the mothers&quot;. However, this does not mean Tantric rituals and practices were as yet a part of either Hindu or Buddhist traditions. &quot;Apart from the somewhat dubious reference to Tantra in the Gangadhar inscription of 423 CE&quot;, states David Lorenzen, it is only 7th-century Banabhatta&#x27;s &quot;Kadambari&quot; which provide convincing proof of Tantra and Tantric texts.

Shaivite ascetics seem to have been involved in the initial development of Tantra, particularly the transgressive elements dealing with the charnel ground. According to Samuel, one group of Shaiva ascetics, the Pasupatas, practiced a form of spirituality that made use of shocking and disreputable behavior later found in a tantric context, such as dancing, singing, and smearing themselves with ashes.

Early Tantric practices are sometimes attributed to Shaiva ascetics associated with Bhairava, the Kapalikas (&quot;skull men&quot;, also called &quot;Somasiddhatins&quot; or &quot;Mahavartins&quot;). Besides the shocking fact that they frequented cremation grounds and carried human skulls, little is known about them, and there is a paucity of primary sources on the Kapalikas. Samuel also states that the sources depict them as using alcohol and sex freely, that they were associated with terrfying female spirit-deities called yoginis and dakinis, and that they were believed to possess magical powers, such as flight.

Kapalikas are depicted in fictional works and also widely disparaged in Buddhist, Hindu and Jain texts of the 1st millennium CE. In Hāla&#x27;s &quot;Gatha-saptasati&quot; (composed by the 5th century AD), for example, the story calls a female character Kapalika, whose lover dies, he is cremated, she takes his cremation ashes and smears her body with it. The 6th-century Varāhamihira mentions Kapalikas in his literary works. Some of the Kāpālika practices mentioned in these texts are those found in Shaiva Hinduism and Vajrayana Buddhism, and scholars disagree on who influenced whom.

These early historical mentions are in passing and appear to be Tantra-like practices, they are not detailed nor comprehensive presentation of Tantric beliefs and practices. Epigraphic references to the &quot;Kaulas&quot; Tantric practices are rare. Reference is made in the early 9th century to &quot;vama&quot; (left-hand) Tantras of the Kaulas. Literary evidence suggests Tantric Buddhism was probably flourishing by the 7th century. Matrikas, or fierce mother goddesses that later are closely linked to Tantra practices, appear both in Buddhist and Hindu arts and literature between the 7th and 10th centuries.

===Rise and development===



According to Gavin Flood, the earliest date for the Tantra texts related to Tantric practices is 600 CE, though most of them were probably composed after the 8th century onwards. According to Flood, very little is known about who created the Tantras, nor much is known about the social status of these and medieval era Tantrikas.

Flood states that the pioneers of Tantra may have been ascetics who lived at the cremation grounds, possibly from &quot;above low-caste groups&quot;, and were probably non-Brahmanical and possibly part of an ancient tradition. By the early medieval times, their practices may have included the imitation of deities such as Kali and Bhairava, with offerings of non-vegetarian food, alcohol and sexual substances. According to this theory, these practitioners would have invited their deities to enter them, then reverted the role in order to control that deity and gain its power. These ascetics would have been supported by low castes living at the cremation places.

Samuel states that and antinomian tantric practices developed in both Buddhist and Brahmanical (mainly Śaiva ascetics like the Kapalikas) contexts and that &quot;Śaivas and Buddhists borrowed extensively from each other, with varying degrees of acknowledgement.&quot; According to Samuel, these deliberately transgressive practices included, &quot;night time orgies in charnel grounds, involving the eating of human flesh, the use of ornaments, bowls and musical instruments made from human bones, sexual relations while seated on corpses, and the like.&quot;

According to Samuel, another key element of in the development of tantra was &quot;the gradual transformation of local and regional deity cults through which fierce male and, particularly, female deities came to take a leading role in the place of the yaksa deities.&quot; Samuel states that this took place between the fifth to eighth centuries CE. According to Samuel, there are two main scholarly opinions on these terrifying goddesses which became incorporated into Śaiva and Buddhist Tantra. The first view is that they originate out of a pan-Indian religious substrate that was not Vedic. Another opinion is to see these fierce goddesses as developing out of the Vedic religion.

Alexis Sanderson has argued that tantric practices originally developed in a Śaiva milieu and was later adopted by Buddhists. He cites numerous elements that are found in the Śaiva &quot;Vidyapitha&quot; literature, including whole passages and lists of pithas, that seem to have been directly borrowed by Vajrayana texts. This has been criticized by Ronald M. Davidson however, due to the uncertain date of the &quot;Vidyapitha&quot; texts. Davidson argues that the pithas seem to have been neither uniquely Buddhist nor Śaiva, but frequented by both groups. He also states that the Śaiva tradition was also involved in the appropriation of local deities and that tantra may have been influenced by tribal Indian religions and their deities. Samuel writes that &quot;the female divinities may well best be understood in terms of a distinct Śākta milieu from which both Śaivas and Buddhists were borrowing&quot;, but that other elements, like the Kapalika style practices, are more clearly derived from a Śaiva tradition.

Samuel writes that the Saiva Tantra tradition appears to have originated as ritual sorcery carried out by hereditary caste groups (kulas) and associated with sex, death and fierce goddesses. The initiation rituals involved the consumption of the mixed sexual secretions (the clan essence) of a male guru and his consort. These practices were adopted by Kapalika styled ascetics and influenced the early Nath siddhas. Over time, the more extreme external elements were replaced by internalized yogas that make use of the subtle body. Sexual ritual became a way to reach the liberating wisdom taught in the tradition.

The Buddhists developed their own corpus of Tantras, which also drew on various Mahayana doctrines and practices, as well as on elements of the fierce goddess tradition and also on elements from the Śaiva traditions (such as deities like Bhairava, which were seen as having been subjugated and converted to Buddhism). Some Buddhist tantras (sometimes called &quot;lower&quot; or &quot;outer&quot; tantras) which are earlier works, do not make use of transgression, sex and fierce deities. These earlier Buddhist tantras mainly reflect a development of Mahayana theory and practice (like deity visualization) and a focus on ritual and purity. Between the eighth and tenth centuries, new tantras emerged which included fierce deities, kula style sexual initiations, subtle body practices and sexual yoga. The later Buddhist tantras are known as the &quot;inner&quot; or &quot;unsurpassed yoga&quot; (&quot;Anuttarayoga&quot; or &quot;Yogini&quot;) tantras. According to Samuel, it seems that these sexual practices were not initially practiced by Buddhist monastics and instead developed outside of the monastic establishments among traveling siddhas.

Tantric practices also included secret initiation ceremonies in which individuals would enter the tantric family (kula) and receive the secret mantras of the tantric deities. These initiations included the consumption of the sexual substances (semen and female sexual secretions) produced through ritual sex between the guru and his consort. These substances were seen as spiritually powerful and were also used as offerings for tantric deities. For both Śaivas and Buddhists, tantric practices often took place at important sacred sites (pithas) associated with fierce goddesses. Samuel writes that &quot;we do not have a clear picture of how this network of pilgrimage sites arose.&quot; Whatever the case, it seems that it was in these ritual spaces visited by both Buddhists and Śaivas that the practice of Kaula and Anuttarayoga Tantra developed during the eighth and ninth centuries. Besides the practices outlined above, these sites also saw the practice of animal sacrifice as blood offerings to Śākta goddesses like Kamakhya. This practice is mentioned in Śākta texts like the &quot;Kālikāpurāṇa&quot; and the &quot;Yoginītantra.&quot; In some of these sites, such as Kamakhya Pitha, animal sacrifice is still widely practiced by Śāktas.

Another key and innovative feature of medieval tantric systems was the development of internal yogas based on elements of the subtle body (&quot;sūkṣma śarīra&quot;). This subtle anatomy held that there were channels in the body (&quot;nadis&quot;) through which certain substances or energies (such as vayu, prana, kundalini, and shakti) flowed. These yogas involved moving these energies through the body to clear out certain knots or blockages (&quot;granthi&quot;) and to direct the energies to the central channel (&quot;avadhuti, sushumna&quot;). These yogic practices are also closely related to the practice of sexual yoga, since sexual intercourse was seen as being involved in the stimulation of the flow of these energies. Samuel thinks that these subtle body practices may have been influenced by Chinese Daoist practices.

One of the earliest mentions of sexual yoga practice is in the Buddhist &quot;Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra&quot; of Asanga (c. 5th century), which states &quot;Supreme self-control is achieved in the reversal of sexual intercourse in the blissful Buddha-poise and the untrammelled vision of one&#x27;s spouse.&quot; According to David Snellgrove, the text&#x27;s mention of a &#x27;reversal of sexual intercourse&#x27; might indicate the practice of withholding ejaculation. Snellgrove states that it is possible that sexual yoga was already being practiced in Buddhist circles at this time, and that Asanga saw it as a valid practice. Likewise, Samuel thinks that there is a possibility that sexual yoga existed in the fourth or fifth centuries (though not in the same transgressive tantric contexts where it was later practiced).

It is only in the seventh and eighth centuries however that we find substantial evidence for these sexual yogas. Unlike previous Upanishadic sexual rituals however, which seem to have been associated with Vedic sacrifice and mundane ends like childbirth, these sexual yogas were associated with the movement of subtle body energies (like Kundalini and Chandali, which were also seen as goddesses), and also with spiritual ends. These practices seemed to have developed at around the same time in both Saiva and Buddhist circles, and are associated with figures such as Tirumülar, Gorakhnath, Virupa, Naropa. The tantric mahasiddhas developed yogic systems with subtle body and sexual elements which could lead to magical powers (siddhis), immortality, as well as spiritual liberation (moksha, nirvana). Sexual yoga was seen as one way of producing a blissful expansion of consciousness that could lead to liberation.

According to Jacob Dalton, ritualized sexual yoga (along with the sexual elements of the tantric initiation ritual, like the consumption of sexual fluids) first appears in Buddhist works called Mahayoga tantras (which include the &quot;Guhyagarbha&quot; and &quot;Guhyasamaja&quot;). These texts &quot;focused on the body&#x27;s interior, on the anatomical details of the male and female sexual organs and the pleasure generated through sexual union.&quot; In these texts, sexual energy was also seen as a powerful force that could be harnessed for spiritual practice and according to Samuel &quot;perhaps create the state of bliss and loss of personal identity which is homologised with liberating insight.&quot; These sexual yogas continued to develop further into more complex systems which are found in texts dating from about the ninth or tenth century, including the Saiva &quot;Kaulajñānanirṇaya&quot; and &quot;Kubjikātantra&quot; as well as the Buddhist &quot;Hevajra&quot;, and &quot;Cakrasamvara&quot; tantras which make use of charnel ground symbolism and fierce goddesses. Samuel writes that these later texts also combine the sexual yoga with a system of controlling the energies of the subtle body.

There is considerable evidence that the &quot;Hevajra&quot; and &quot;Cakrasamvara&quot; tantras borrow significant portions from Saiva sources. The text &quot;Cakrasamvara&quot; and its commentaries have revealed numerous attempts by the Buddhists to enlarge and modify it, both to remove references to Saiva deities and to add more Buddhist technical terminology.

===Tantric age===


From the 8th to the 14th century, Tantric traditions rose to prominence and flourished throughout India and beyond. By the 10th century, the main elements of tantric practice had reached maturity and were being practiced in Saiva and Buddhist contexts. This period has been referred to as the &#x27;Tantric Age&#x27; by some scholars due to prevalence of Tantra. Also by the 10th century, numerous tantric texts (variously called Agamas, Samhitas and Tantras) had been written, particularly in Kashmir, Nepal and Bengal. By this time, Tantric texts had also been translated into regional languages such as Tamil, and Tantric practices had spread across South Asia. Tantra also spread into Tibet, Indonesia and China. Gavin Flood describes the Tantric age as follows:

Though the whole northern and Himalayan part of India was involved in the development of tantra, Kashmir was a particularly important center, both Saiva and Buddhist and numerous key tantric texts were written there according to Padoux. According to Alexis Sanderson, the Śaiva Tantra traditions of medieval Kashmir were mainly divided between the dualistic Śaiva Siddhanta and the non-dualist theology found in Śakta lineages like the Trika, Krama and Kaula. The non-dualists generally accepted and made use of sexual and transgressive practices, while the dualists mostly rejected them. Saiva tantra was especially successful because it managed to forge strong ties with South Asian kings who valued the power (shakti) of fierce deities like the warrior goddess Durga as a way to increase their own royal power. These kings took part in royal rituals led by Saiva &quot;royal gurus&quot; in which they were symbolically married to tantric deities and thus became the earthly representative of male gods like Shiva. Saiva tantra could also employ a variety of protection and destruction rituals which could be used for the benefit of the kingdom and the king. Tantric Shaivism was adopted by the kings of Kashmir, as well as by the Somavamshis of Odisha, the Kalachuris, and the Chandelas of Jejakabhukti (in Bundelkhand). There is also evidence of state support from the Cambodian Khmer Empire. As noted by Samuel, in spite of the increased depiction of female goddesses, these tantric traditions all seemed to have been mostly &quot;male-directed and male-controlled.&quot;

During the Tantric Age, Buddhist Tantra was embraced by the Mahayana Buddhist mainstream and was studied at the great universities such as Nalanda and Vikramashila, from which it spread to Tibet and to the East Asian states of China, Korea, and Japan. This new Tantric Buddhism was supported by the Pala Dynasty (8th–12th century) which supported these centers of learning and also built grand tantric temples and monasteries such as Somapura Mahavihara and Odantapuri while establishing good relations with the Tibetan Empire and Srivijaya Empire where the Buddhist Mahasiddhas of the Vajrayana tradition spread their influence via songs of realization like those collected in the Charyapada which were orally transmitted in various lineages and translated into many different languages over time. The later Khmer kings and the Indonesian Srivijaya kingdom also supported tantric Buddhism. According to Samuel, while the sexual and transgressive practices were mostly undertaken in symbolic form (or through visualization) in later Tibetan Buddhist monastic contexts, it seems that in the eighth to tenth century Indian context, they were actually performed.

In the 10th and 11th centuries, both Shaiva and Buddhist tantra evolved into more tame, philosophical, and liberation-oriented religions. This transformation saw a move from external and transgressive rituals towards a more internalized yogic practice focused on attaining spiritual insight. This recasting also made tantric religions much less open to attack by other groups. In Shaivism, this development is often associated with the Kashmiri master Abhinavagupta (c. 950 – 1016 CE) and his followers, as well the movements which were influenced by their work, like the Sri Vidya tradition (which spread as far as South India, and has been referred to as &quot;high&quot; tantra).

In Buddhism, this taming of tantra is associated with the adoption of tantra by Buddhist monastics who sought to incorporate it within the Buddhist Mahayana scholastic framework. Buddhist tantras were written down and scholars like Abhayakaragupta wrote commentaries on them. Another important figure, the Bengali teacher Atisha, wrote a treatise which placed tantra as the culmination of a graduated Mahayana path to awakening, the &quot;Bodhipathapradīpa&quot;. In his view, one needed to first begin practicing non-tantric Mahayana, and then later one might be ready for tantra. This system became the model for tantric practice among some Tibetan Buddhist schools, like the Gelug. In Tibet, the transgressive and sexual practices of tantra became much less central and tantric practice was seen as suitable only for a small elite group. New tantras continued to be composed during this later period as well, such as the Kalachakra (c. 11th century), which seems to be concerned with converting Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike, and uniting them together against Islam. The Kalachakra teaches sexual yoga, but also warns not to introduce the practice of ingesting impure substances to beginners, since this is only for advanced yogis. This tantra also seems to want to minimize the impact of the transgressive practices, since it advises tantrikas to outwardly follow the customs of their country.

Another influential development during this period was the codification of tantric yogic techniques that would later become the separate movement known as Hatha Yoga. According to James Mallinson, the original &quot;source text&quot; for Hatha Yoga is the Vajrayana Buddhist &quot;Amṛtasiddhi&quot; (11th century CE) attributed to the mahasiddha Virupa. This text was later adopted by Saiva yogic traditions (such as the Naths) and is quoted in their texts.

Another tradition of Hindu Tantra developed among the Vaishnavas, this was called the Pāñcarātra Agama tradition. This tradition avoided the transgressive and sexual elements that were embraced by the Saivas and the Buddhists. There is also a smaller tantric tradition associated with Surya, the sun god. Jainism also seems to have developed a substantial Tantra corpus based on the Saura tradition, with rituals based on yakshas and yakshinis. However, this Jain tantrism was mainly used for pragmatic purposes like protection, and was not used to attain liberation. Complete manuscripts of these Jain tantras have not survived. The Jains also seem to have adopted some of the subtle body practices of tantra, but not sexual yoga. The Svetambara thinker Hemacandra (c. 1089–1172) discusses tantric practices extensively, such as internal meditations on chakras, which betray Kaula and Nath influences.

=== Reception and later developments ===
There seems to have been some debate regarding the appropriateness of tantra. Among the Hindus, those belonging to the more orthodox Vedic traditions rejected the Tantras. Meanwhile, tantrikas incorporated Vedic ideas within their own systems, while considering the Tantras as the higher, more refined understanding. Meanwhile, some Tantrikas considered the Tantras to be superior to the Vedas, while others considered them complementary such as Umapati, who is quoted as stating: &quot;The Veda is the cow, the true Agama its milk.&quot;

According to Samuel, the great Advaita philosopher Shankara (9th century) &quot;is portrayed in his biography, the &quot;Sankaravijaya&quot;, as condemning the approaches of various kinds of Tantric practitioners and defeating them through argument or spiritual power.&quot; He also is said to have encouraged the replacement of fierce goddesses with benign female deities, and thus to have promoted the Sri Vidya tradition (which worships a peaceful and sweet goddess, Tripura Sundari). Though it is far from certain that Shankara actually campaigned against tantra, he is traditionally seen as someone who purified Hinduism from transgressive and antinomian tantric practices.

The 14th-century Indian scholar Mādhavācārya (in Sarva-Darsana-Sangraha) wrote copious commentaries on then existing major schools of Indian philosophies and practices, and cited the works of the 10th century Abhinavagupta, who was considered a major and influential Tantra scholar. However, Madhavacarya does not mention Tantra as a separate, distinct religious or ritual-driven practice. The early 20th-century Indian scholar Pandurang Vaman Kane conjectured that Madhavacharya ignored Tantra because it may have been considered scandalous. In contrast, Padoux suggests that Tantra may have been so pervasive by the 13th century that &quot;it was not regarded as being a distinct system.&quot;

Hindu tantra, while practiced by some of the general lay population, was eventually overshadowed by the more popular Bhakti movements that swept throughout India from the 15th century onwards. According to Samuel, &quot;these new devotional styles of religion, with their emphasis on emotional submission to a supreme saviour-deity, whether Saivite or Vaisnavite, were better adapted, perhaps, to the subaltern role of non-Muslim groups under Muslim rule.&quot; Saiva tantra did remain an important practice among most Saiva ascetics however. Tantric traditions also survived in certain regions, such as among the Naths of Rajasthan, in the Sri Vidya tradition of South India and in the Bengali Bauls.

In Buddhism, while tantra became accepted in the great Mahayana establishments of Nalanda and Vikramashila and spread to the Himalayan regions, it also experienced serious setbacks in other regions, particularly Southeast Asia. In Burma, for example, King Anawratha (1044–1077) is said to have disbanded tantric &quot;Ari&quot; monks. As Theravada Buddhism became dominant in South East Asian states, tantric religions became marginalised in those regions. In Sri Lanka, tantric Buddhism also suffered debilitating setbacks. Initially the large Abhayagiri Monastery was a place where the practice of Vajrayana seems to have flourished during the 8th century. However, Abhayagiri was disbanded and forced to convert to the orthodox Mahāvihāra sect during the reign of Parakramabahu I (1153–1186).

Regarding the reception of tantra during the period of Hindu modernism in the 19th and 20th centuries, Samuel writes that this period saw &quot;a radical reframing of yogic practices away from the Tantric context.&quot; Samuel notes that while Hindu Hatha yoga had its origins in a Saiva tantric context,

Given the extremely negative views of Tantra and its sexual and magical practices which prevailed in middle-class India in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and still largely prevail today, this was an embarrassing heritage. Much effort was given by people such as Swami Vivekananda into reconstructing yoga, generally in terms of a selective Vedantic reading of Patañjali&#x27;s Yogasutra (de Michelis 2004). The effort was largely successful, and many modern Western practitioners of yoga for health and relaxation have little or no knowledge of its original function as a preparation for the internal sexual practices of the Nath tradition.

Buddhist tantra has survived in modern Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, in various Japanese traditions such as Shingon, and in the Newar Buddhism of the Kathmandu Valley. There are also magical quasi-tantric traditions in Southeast Asia, sometimes termed Esoteric Southern Buddhism, though they are not called &quot;tantric&quot; and have been marginalised by state supported modernist forms of Theravada Buddhism.

==Tantric traditions==

=== Hindu tantra ===
Within Hinduism, the word tantra often refers to a text, which may or may not be &quot;tantric.&quot; Conversely, various tantric texts are actually not always called tantras (instead they may be called &quot;āgama, jñāna&quot;, &quot;saṃhitā, siddhānta, vidyā&quot;). There are also tantric Upanishads, which are late Upanishads as well as tantric Puranas (and Puranas influenced by tantric ideas). Besides these types of texts, there are also various types of tantric &quot;śastras&quot; (treatises) which may be &quot;commentaries, digests, compilations, monographs, collections of hymns or of names of deities, and mantras and works on mantras.&quot; Though much of this vast body of tantric literature is in Sanskrit, others have also been written in Indian vernacular languages. As noted by Padoux, the largest portion of these tantric works are Shaiva texts.

Tantric texts and practitioners (&quot;tantrikas&quot; and &quot;tantrinis&quot;) are often contrasted with Vedic texts and those who practice Vedic religion (&quot;Vaidikas&quot;). This non-Vedic path was often termed Mantramarga (&quot;The way of mantras&quot;) or Tantrasastra (&quot;Tantra teaching&quot;). One of the most well known comments on this dichotomy is Kulluka Bhatta&#x27;s statement in his 15th-century commentary to the Manusmriti which states that revelation (sruti) is twofold – Vedic and Tantric. Hindu tantric teachings are generally seen as revelations from a divine being (such as Śiva, or the Goddess) which are considered by tantrikas to be superior to the Vedas in leading beings to liberation. They are also considered to be more effective during the Kali Yuga, a time of much passion (kama). However, tantric thinkers like Abhinavagupta, while considering tantra as superior, do not totally reject Vedic teachings, and instead consider them valid on a lower level since they also derive from the same source, the supreme Godhead.

There are various Hindu tantric traditions within Shaivism, Shaktism and Vaishnavism. There are numerous tantric texts for these different traditions with different philosophical points of view, ranging from theistic dualism to absolute monism. According to David B. Gray, &quot;one of the most important tropes in the history of the dissemination of tantric traditions is that of lineage, the transmission of teachings along an uninterrupted lineage, from master to disciple, the so-called &quot;guruparaṃparā&quot;.&quot; These various traditions also differ among themselves on how heterodox and transgressive they are (vis a vis the Vedic tradition). Since tantric rituals became so widespread, certain forms of tantra were eventually accepted by many orthodox Vedic thinkers such as Jayanta Bhatta and Yamunacarya as long as they did not contradict Vedic teaching and social rules. Tantric scriptures such as the Kali centered &quot;Jayadrathayamala&quot; also state that tantrikas can follow the Vedic social rules out of convenience and for the benefit of their clan and guru. However, not all Vedic thinkers accepted tantra. For example, Kumarila Bhatta wrote that one should have no contact with tantrikas nor speak to them.

==== Śaiva and Śākta tantra ====


Śaiva Tantra is called the Mantramārga, and is often seen as being a separate teaching than the ascetic &quot;Atimārga&quot; tradition (which includes the Pāśupatas and Kāpālikas). There are various doctrines, textual classes and schools of Shaiva Tantra, which often overlap with the Shakta tradition in different ways.

The Śaiva Siddhānta tradition is the earliest Śaiva Tantra school and was characterized by public rituals performed by priests. Some of their texts, like the &quot;Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā&quot; have been dated to the fifth century. Their scriptures (the Śaiva Agamas) and basic doctrines are also shared by the other traditions as a common Śaiva doctrine and many of their rites are also used in other schools of Shaiva Tantra. The prescriptions and rituals of the Śaiva Siddhānta Agamas are generally followed by Śaiva temples in South India and they are mostly compatible with orthodox Brahmanism, lacking terrifying deities and animal sacrifice.

The Mantrapīṭha tradition on the other hand, worships Svacchanda Bhairava, a terrifying form of Shiva also known as &quot;Aghora&quot; (&quot;not fearsome&quot;). This tradition promotes the Skull observance (&quot;Kapalavrata&quot;), that is, carrying a skull, a skull staff (khatavanga) and worshipping in cremation grounds. One contemporary group of Kapalika ascetics are the Aghoris.

There are also various traditions who are classified as &quot;Vidyāpīṭha&quot;. The texts of this tradition focus on worshipping goddesses known as Yoginīs or Ḍākinīs and include antinomian practices dealing with charnel grounds and sexuality. These goddess centered traditions of the Śākta tantras are mostly of the &quot;left&quot; current (vamachara) and are thus considered more heterodox.

There are various Vidyāpīṭha traditions, which focus on a bipolar, bisexual divinity that is equal parts male and female, Śaiva and Śākta. The &quot;Yamalatantras&quot; worship Bhairava along with Kapalini, the goddess of the skull. The Goddess centered traditions are known as the Kulamārga (Path of the Clans), referring to the clans of the goddesses and their &quot;Shakti tantras&quot;, which may have been established around the 9th century. It includes sexual rituals, sanguinary practices, the ritual consumption of liquor and the importance of spirit possession. It includes various sub-traditions the developed in different regions of India, such as the Trika lineage (which worships a trio of deities: Parā, Parāparā, and Aparā), the tradition of the fierce goddess Guhyakālī, Krama tradition, focusing on the goddess Kālī, the Kubjikā cult, and the southern tradition which worships the beautiful goddess Kāmeśvarī or Tripurasundarī.

During the 10th century, the syncretic nondual tradition of Kashmir Śaivism developed. According to Alexis Sanderson, this tradition arose out of the confrontation between the dualistic and more orthodox Śaiva Siddhānta and the nondual transgressive traditions of the Trika and Krama. According to David B. Gray, this school integrated elements from both of these traditions, &quot;the end result was a nondualistic system in which the transgressive elements were internalized and hence rendered less offensive to the orthodox.&quot;

The philosophers of Kashmir Śaivism, especially Abhinavagupta (&quot;c&quot;. 975–1025 ce) and his student Jayaratha, are some of the most influential philosophers who wrote on Hindu tantra. These thinkers synthesized the various goddess and Śaiva lineages and philosophies into a comprehensive and influential religious system. According to David White, Abhinavagupta &quot;sublimates, cosmeticizes, and semanticizes many of its practices into a type of meditative asceticism whose aim is to realize a transcendent subjectivity&quot;. Thus, his work domesticated the radically antinomian practices of Vidyāpīṭha lineages into meditative exercises.

In Nepal, the Sarvamnaya tantra system evolved as a tantrik tradition which drew upon the āmnāya system. Amnaya is often translated as &#x27;transmission&#x27;. This system serves as the guiding source for the tradition of worship of deities that emanate from the five different aspects of Lord Śiva. At its core, the concept of Āmnāya revolves around the idea that Śiva, with his five faces, (referred to as Sadashiva), imparts the secret Tantric teachings to the goddess through her corresponding five emanations. Scholarly work on Sarvamnaya can be found in the article, &quot;The transmission of all powers: Sarvāmnāya Śākta Tantra and the semiotics of power in Nepāla-maṇḍala&quot; by Jeffrey S. Lidke.

The last major Śaiva tantric tradition is that of the Nāth or &quot;Split-Ear&quot; Kānphaṭa tradition, which emerged in the 12th or 13th century. They produced various Haṭhayoga texts which draw on tantric yogas.

While the Śākta traditions continued to develop in different ways, sometimes in a more popular and devotional direction, many of them retain various tantric elements today. The two most important and popular Śākta tantra traditions today are the Southern Kaula transmission, which focus on the beautiful goddess Śrī (&quot;śrīkula&quot;) or Lalitā Tripurasundarī and the Northern and Eastern transmission, focusing on the ferocious goddess Kālī (&quot;kālīkula&quot;). The southern transmission gave rise to the Śrī Vidyā tradition, an important tantric religion in South India. Though it takes much of its philosophical and doctrinal system from Kashmir Shaivism, it generally avoids the transgressive elements and is orthodox or &quot;right handed&quot;. Bhaskararaya (18th century) is considered a key thinker of this tradition. The Kālīkula tradition is particularly important in East and South India and Kālī remains a popular goddess in India, a focus of much devotion.

==== Vaiṣṇava ====

The main Vaiṣṇava tradition that is associated with tantra is the Pañcharatra. This tradition produced a number of tantric texts including Lakshmi tantra, but most of the other tantras are lost. However, this sect does not identify itself as &quot;tantric&quot;. The worship and ritual of most of the Vaiṣṇava temples in South India follow this tradition, which is ritually similar to the Shaiva Siddhanta. According to Padoux, &quot;from the doctrinal point of view, they are nearer to brahmanical orthodoxy (proudly asserted by some of their affiliates) and their mantras are indeed often Vedic.&quot;

According to David B. Gray,

During the medieval period another tantric Vaiṣṇava tradition emerged in Bengal. Known as the Sahajiyā tradition, it flourished in Bengal around the 16th through 19th centuries. It taught that each individual is a divinity, embodying the divine couple Kṛṣṇa and his consort Rādhā. This tradition integrated earlier Hindu and Buddhist tantric practices within a Vaiṣṇava theological framework.

===Buddhist tantra===

There are various Buddhist tantric traditions with the goal of attaining Enlightenment which are called by different names such as Vajrayana, Secret Mantra, Mantrayana and so on. The Indo-Tibetan Buddhist tradition has been dominant in Tibet and the Himalayan regions. It first spread to Tibet in the 8th century and quickly rose to prominence. The Tibetan Buddhist tantric teachings have recently been spread to the Western world by the Tibetan diaspora. Nepalese Newar Buddhism meanwhile is still practiced in the Kathmandu Valley by the Newar people. The tradition maintains a canon of Sanskrit texts, the only Buddhist tantric tradition to still do so.

Buddhist Tantric practices and texts which developed from the 5th to the 8th centuries were translated into Chinese and are preserved in the Chinese Buddhist canon as well as in the Dunhuang manuscripts. Tantric materials involving the use of mantras and dharanis began to appear in China during the fifth century period, and Buddhist masters such as Zhiyi developed proto-tantric rituals based on esoteric texts. Chinese Esoteric Buddhism became especially influential in China in the Tang dynasty period with the arrival of esoteric masters such as Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra to the capital city of Chang&#x27;an. The succeeding Song dynasty saw an influx of new esoteric texts being transmitted by monks from Central Asia. Chinese Esoteric Buddhist rituals were also noted to be particularly popular in the Liao dynasty, which contended with the Song for control of northern China. Due to the highly eclectic nature of Chinese Buddhism where sectarian denominations were not strictly drawn between the various Buddhist schools (even during the Tang dynasty), and where most Buddhist masters mixed practices from the different traditions, Chinese Esoteric Buddhist practices were absorbed by lineages from the other Buddhist traditions such as Chan and Tiantai. For example, the Northern School of Chan even became known for its esoteric practices of dhāraṇīs and mantras. During the Yuan and Ming dynasty periods, certain esoteric elements from Tibetan Buddhism were also adapted and incorporated into general Chinese Buddhist practices and rituals. In modern Chinese Buddhism, the esoteric traditions continue to be passed on and practiced through numerous tantric rituals such as the Liberation Rite of Water and Land and the Universal Crossing (普渡 Pǔdù) rites for Hungry Ghosts which involve practices like deity yoga and mandala offerings, as well as the recitation of tantric mantras such as the Cundī Dhāraṇī, the Hundred Syllable Mantra of Vajrasattva, the Mahācakravidyārāja Dhāraṇī and the Shurangama Mantra. Esoteric practices also spread to Korea and to Japan, where it exists as an independent tradition called Shingon.

===Other religions===
The Hindu and Buddhist Tantric traditions significantly influenced other religions such as Jainism, Sikhism, the Tibetan Bön tradition, Daoism, Shintō, Sufi Islam, and the Western New Age movement.

In the Sikh literature, the ideas related to Shakti and goddess reverence attributed to Guru Gobind Singh, particularly in the &quot;Dasam Granth&quot;, are related to tantra ideas found in Buddhism and Hinduism.

The Jain worship methods, states Ellen Gough, were likely influenced by Shaktism ideas, and this is attested by the tantric diagrams of the &quot;Rishi-mandala&quot; where the Tirthankaras are portrayed. The Tantric traditions within Jainism use verbal spells or mantra, and rituals that are believed to accrue merit for rebirth realms.

== Practices==
One of the main elements of the Tantric literature is ritual. Rather than one coherent system, Tantra is an accumulation of practices and ideas from different sources. As Samuel writes, the tantric traditions are &quot;a confluence of a variety of different factors and components.&quot; These elements include: mandalas, mantras, internal sexual yogic practices, fierce male and female deities, cremation ground symbolism, as well as concepts from Indian Philosophy.

André Padoux notes that there is no consensus among scholars as to which elements are characteristic for Tantra, nor is there any text that contains all those elements. Also, most of those elements can also be found in non-Tantric traditions. Because of the wide range of communities covered by the term, it is problematic to describe tantric practices definitively. However, there are sets of practices and elements which are shared by numerous tantric traditions, and thus a family resemblance relationship can be established among them.

Different scholars give different main features of tantra. For example, David N. Lorenzen writes that tantra shares various &quot;shamanic and yogic&quot; practices, worship of goddesses, association with specific schools like the Kaulas and Kapalikas, as well as tantric texts. Christopher Wallis meanwhile, basing himself on the definition given the tantric scholar Rāmakaṇṭha, gives four main features of tantra: &quot;1) concern with ritual modes of manipulation (of the environment or one&#x27;s own awareness), 2) requirement for esoteric initiation (to receive access to the scriptural teachings and practices), 3) a twofold goal of practice: the soteriological and supramundane one of liberation (variously conceived) and/or the mundane one of extraordinary power over other beings and one&#x27;s environment, and 4) the claim that these three are explicated in scriptures that are the word of God (&quot;āgama&quot;) or the Buddha (&quot;buddhavacana&quot;).&quot;

According to Anthony Tribe, a scholar of Buddhist Tantra, Tantra has the following defining features:

# Centrality of ritual, especially the worship of deities
# Centrality of mantras
# Visualisation of and identification with a deity
# Need for initiation, esotericism and secrecy
# Importance of a teacher (guru, &quot;acharya&quot;)
# Ritual use of mandalas (&quot;maṇḍala&quot;)
# Transgressive or antinomian acts
# Revaluation of the body
# Revaluation of the status and role of women
# Analogical thinking (including microcosmic or macrocosmic correlation)
# Revaluation of negative mental states

There are a wide array of Tantric techniques or spiritual practices (sadhana) such as:
* Dakshina: Donation or gift to one&#x27;s teacher
* Diksha or Abhiseka: Initiation ritual which may include shaktipat
* Ganachakra: A ritual feast during which a sacramental meal is offered
* Guru yoga and Guru devotion (bhakti)
* Mandalas and Yantras, symbolic diagrams of forces at work in the universe
* Mantras: reciting syllables, words, and phrases
* Mudras, or hand gestures
* Nyasa, installing mantras on the body
* Prāyaścitta - an expiation ritual performed if a puja has been performed wrongly
*Puja (worship ritual) and other forms of bhakti
* Ritual music and dance
* Ritual purification (of idols, of one&#x27;s body, etc.)
* Ritual sacrifice, including animal sacrifice
* Singing of hymns of praise (&quot;stava&quot;)
* Sexual yoga: ritual sexual union (with an actual physical consort or an imagined deity)
* The acquisition and use of siddhis or supernormal powers. Associated with &quot;vamachara&quot; (&#x27;left-hand path&#x27;)
* Use of taboo substances such as alcohol, cannabis, meat and other entheogens.
* Visualization of deities and Identification these deities in meditation (deity yoga)
* Vrata and Samaya: vows or pledges, sometimes to do ascetic practices like fasting
* Yatra: pilgrimage, processions
* Yoga, including breathing techniques (&quot;pranayama&quot;) and postures (&quot;asana&quot;), is employed to balance the energies in the body/mind.

=== Worship and ritual ===

Worship or puja in Hindu Tantra differs from Vedic forms somewhat. While in the Vedic practice of yajna there are no idols, shrines, and symbolic art, in tantra they are important means of worship.

Rituals are particularly important in the dualistic Śaiva Siddhānta which according to Padoux &quot;is typically characterized by an overabundance of rituals, which are necessarily accompanied by mantras. These rituals are not so much a succession of actions as a play of mentally visualized and experienced images, a situation common to all Tantric traditions, where rites, meditation, and yoga are exercises in creative identifying imagination.&quot; The theory behind these rituals is the idea that all humans have a fundamental impurity (mala) that binds them to rebirth. This impurity can be removed by ritual action (along with proper knowledge). The initial step in this path is the ritual of initiation (diksa), which opens to door to future liberation at death.

In the non-dualistic and transgressive (or &quot;left hand&quot;) traditions like the Kali cults and the Trika school, rituals and pujas can include certain left hand path elements that are not found in the more orthodox traditions. These transgressive elements include the use of skulls and other human bone implements (as part of the Kapalika vow), fierce deities like Bhairava, Kubjika and Kali which were used as part of meditative visualizations, ritual possession by the deities (avesa), sexual rites and offering the deity (as well as consuming) certain impure substances like meat, alcohol and sexual fluids. Padoux explains the transgressive practices as follows:On the ritual and mental plane, transgression was an essential trait by which the nondualistic Tantric traditions set themselves apart from other traditions – so much so that they used the term &quot;nondualistic practice&quot; (advaitacara) to refer to the Kaula transgressive practices as a rejection of the duality (dvaita) of pure and impure in brahmanical society. Let us also note that for the nondualistic Saiva systems, the Yoginis were not active merely in the world of spirits; they were also powers present in humans – mistresses of their senses, governing their affects, which acquired an intensity and super-natural dimension through this divinization. This led adepts to an identification of their individual consciousness with the infinite divine Consciousness, thus also helping them transcend the sexual plane.In both the Buddhist and Saiva contexts, the sexual practices are often seen as a way to expand one&#x27;s consciousness through the use of bliss.

There is also a fundamental philosophical disagreement between Śaiva Siddhānta and the non-dualistic schools like the Trika regarding ritual. In Śaiva Siddhānta, only ritual can do away with &quot;innate impurities&quot; (&quot;anavamala&quot;) that bind individual Selfs, though the ritual must be performed with an understanding of their nature and purpose as well as with devotion. In the view of the Trika school (especially in the work of Abhinavagupta), only knowledge (&quot;jñana&quot;) which is a &quot;recognition&quot; (&quot;pratyabhijña&quot;) of our true nature, leads to liberation. According to Padoux, &quot;this is also, with nuances, the position of the Pñcaratra and of other Vaisnava Tantric traditions.&quot;

=== Yoga, mantra, meditation===

Tantric yoga is first and foremost an embodied practice, which is seen as having a divine esoteric structure. As noted by Padoux, tantric yoga makes use of a &quot;mystic physiology&quot; which includes various psychosomatic elements known as the subtle body. This imaginary inner structure includes chakras (&quot;wheels&quot;), nadis (&quot;channels&quot;), and energies (like Kundalini, Chandali, different pranas and vital winds, etc.). The tantric body is also held to be a microcosmic reflection of the universe, and is thus seen as containing gods and goddesses. According to Padoux, the &quot;internalized image of the yogic body&quot; is a fundamental element for nearly all meditative and tantric ritual practices.

The use of mantras is one of the most common and widespread elements of tantric practice. They are used in rituals as well as during various meditative and yogic practices. Mantra recitation (japa) is often practiced along with nyasa (&quot;depositing&quot; the mantra), mudras (&quot;seals&quot;, i.e. hand gestures) and complex visualizations involving divine symbols, mandalas and deities. Nyasa involves touching various parts of the body while reciting mantra, which is thought to connect the deity with the yogis body and transform the body into that of the deity.

Mantras are also often visualized as being located within the yogi&#x27;s body as part of tantric meditations. For example, in the &quot;Yogini Heart&quot; tantra, a Śrī Vidyā text, the yogi is instructed to imagine the five syllables (HA SA KA LA HRIM) of the deity&#x27;s mantra in the muladhara chakra. The next set of five syllables (HA SA KA HA LA HRIM) is visualized in the heart chakra and the third cluster (SA KA LA HRIM) in the cakra between the eyebrows. The yogi is further instructed to lengthen the enunciation of the M sound at the end of the HRIM syllable, a practice called nada (phonic vibration). This practice goes through various increasingly subtle stages until it dissolves into the silence of the Absolute.

Another common element found in tantric yoga is the use of visionary meditations in which tantrikas focus on a vision or image of the deity (or deities), and in some cases imagine themselves as being the deity and their own body as the body of the deity. The practitioner may use visualizations, identifying with a deity to the degree that the aspirant becomes the &quot;Ishta-deva&quot; (or meditational deity). In other meditations, the deities are visualized as being inside the tantrika&#x27;s body. For example, in Abhinavagupta&#x27;s &quot;Tantraloka&quot; (chapter 15), the Trika trinity of goddesses (Parā, Parāparā, and Aparā) are visualized on the ends of the three prongs of a trident (located above the head). The rest of the trident is imagined positioned along the central axis of the yogi&#x27;s body, with the blazing corpse of Shiva visualized in the head.

===Mandalas and yantras===
Yantra are mystical diagrams which are used in tantric meditation and ritual. They are usually associated with specific Hindu deities such as Shiva, Shakti, or Kali. Similarly, a &quot;puja&quot; may involve focusing on a &quot;yantra&quot; or &quot;mandala&quot; associated with a deity.

According to David Gordon White, geometrical mandalas are a key element of Tantra. They are used to represent numerous tantric ideas and concepts as well as used for meditative focus. Mandalas symbolically communicate the correspondences between the &quot;transcendent-yet-immanent&quot; macrocosm and the microcosm of mundane human experience. The godhead (or principal Buddha) is often depicted at the center of the mandala, while all other beings, including the practitioner, are located at various distances from this center. Mandalas also reflected the medieval feudal system, with the king at its centre.

Mandalas and Yantras may be depicted in various ways, on paintings, cloth, in three dimensional form, made out of colored sand or powders, etc. Tantric yoga also often involves the mental visualization of a mandala or yantra. This is usually combined with mantra recitation and other ritual actions as part of a tantric sadhana (practice).

=== Sex and eroticism ===
While tantra involves a wide range of ideas and practices which are not always of a sexual nature, Flood and Padoux both note that in the West, Tantra is most often thought of as a kind of ritualized sex or a spiritualized yogic sexuality. According to Padoux, &quot;this is a misunderstanding, for though the place of sex in Tantra is ideologically essential, it is not always so in action and ritual.&quot; Padoux further notes that while sexual practices do exist and were used by certain tantric groups, they &quot;lost their prevalence when Tantra spread to other larger social groups.&quot;

In the tantric traditions which do use sex as part of spiritual practice (this refers mainly to the Kaulas, and also Tibetan Buddhism), sex and desire are often seen as a means of transcendence that is used to reach the Absolute. Thus, sex and desire are not seen as ends in themselves. Because these practices transgress orthodox Hindu ideas of ritual purity, they have often given tantra a bad image in India, where it is often condemned by the orthodox. According to Padoux, even among the traditions which accept these practices, they are far from prominent and practiced only by a &quot;few initiated and fully qualified adepts&quot;.

==Western scholarly research==


===John Woodroffe===

The first Western scholar to seriously study Tantra was John Woodroffe (1865–1936), who wrote about Tantra under the pen name Arthur Avalon and is known as the &quot;founding father of Tantric studies&quot;. Unlike previous Western scholars Woodroffe advocated for Tantra, defending and presenting it as an ethical and philosophical system in accord with the Vedas and Vedanta. Woodroffe practised Tantra and, while trying to maintain scholastic objectivity, was a student of Hindu Tantra (the &quot;Shiva-Shakta&quot; tradition).

===Further development===

Following Woodroffe, a number of scholars began investigating Tantric teachings, including scholars of comparative religion and Indology such as Agehananda Bharati, Mircea Eliade, Julius Evola, Carl Jung, Alexandra David-Néel, Giuseppe Tucci and Heinrich Zimmer. According to Hugh Urban, Zimmer, Evola and Eliade viewed Tantra as &quot;the culmination of all Indian thought: the most radical form of spirituality and the archaic heart of aboriginal India&quot;, regarding it as the ideal religion for the modern era. All three saw Tantra as &quot;the most transgressive and violent path to the sacred&quot;.

<text>Twelve-step programs are international mutual aid programs supporting recovery from substance s, behavioral addictions and compulsions. Developed in the 1930s, the first twelve-step program, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), founded by Bill Wilson and Bob Smith, aided its membership to overcome alcoholism. Since that time dozens of other organizations have been derived from AA&#x27;s approach to address problems as varied as drug addiction, compulsive gambling, sex, and overeating. All twelve-step programs utilize a version of AA&#x27;s suggested twelve steps first published in the 1939 book &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism.&quot;

As summarized by the American Psychological Association (APA), the process involves the following:
* admitting that one cannot control one&#x27;s alcoholism, addiction, or compulsion;
* coming to believe in a Higher Power that can give strength;
* examining past errors with the help of a sponsor (experienced member);
* making amends for these errors;
* learning to live a new life with a new code of behavior;
* helping others who suffer from the same alcoholism, addictions, or compulsions.

==Overview==
Twelve-step methods have been adapted to address a wide range of alcoholism, substance abuse, and dependency problems. Over 200 mutual aid organizations—often known as fellowships—with a worldwide membership of millions have adopted and adapted AA’s 12 Steps and 12 Traditions for recovery. Narcotics Anonymous was formed by addicts who did not relate to the specifics of alcohol dependency.

Demographic preferences related to the addicts&#x27; drug of choice has led to the creation of Cocaine Anonymous, Crystal Meth Anonymous and Marijuana Anonymous. Behavioral issues such as compulsion for or addiction to gambling, crime, food, sex, hoarding, getting into debt and work are addressed in fellowships such as Gamblers Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Sexaholics Anonymous and Debtors Anonymous.

Auxiliary groups such as Al-Anon and Nar-Anon, for friends and family members of alcoholics and addicts, respectively, are part of a response to treating addiction as a disease that is enabled by family systems. Adult Children of Alcoholics (ACA or ACOA) addresses the effects of growing up in an alcoholic or otherwise dysfunctional family. Co-Dependents Anonymous () addresses compulsions related to relationships, referred to as codependency.

==History==
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), the first twelve-step fellowship, was founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Robert Holbrook Smith, known to AA members as &quot;Bill W.&quot; and &quot;Dr. Bob&quot;, in Akron, Ohio. In 1946 they formally established the twelve traditions to help deal with the issues of how various groups could relate and function as membership grew. The practice of remaining anonymous (using only one&#x27;s first names) when interacting with the general public was published in the first edition of the AA Big Book.

As AA chapters were increasing in number during the 1930s and 1940s, the guiding principles were gradually defined as the Twelve Traditions. A singleness of purpose emerged as Tradition Five: &quot;Each group has but one primary purpose—to carry its message to the alcoholic who still suffers&quot;. Consequently, drug addicts who do not suffer from the specifics of alcoholism involved in AA hoping for recovery technically are not welcome in &quot;closed&quot; meetings unless they have a desire to stop drinking alcohol.

The principles of AA have been used to form numerous other fellowships specifically designed for those recovering from various pathologies; each emphasizes recovery from the specific malady which brought the sufferer into the fellowship.

==Twelve Steps==


The following are the twelve steps as published in 2001 by Alcoholics Anonymous:
# We admitted we were powerless over alcohol—that our lives had become unmanageable.
# Came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.
# Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God, &quot;as we understood Him&quot;
# Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.
# Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.
# Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.
# Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.
# Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make to them all.
# Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.
# Continued to take personal inventory, and when we were wrong, promptly admitted it.
# Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.
# Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs.

Where other twelve-step groups have adapted the AA steps as guiding principles, step one is generally updated to reflect the focus of recovery. For example, in Overeaters Anonymous, the first step reads, &quot;We admitted we were powerless over compulsive overeating—that our lives had become unmanageable.&quot; Variations in the languaging of the third step (which once spoke of making &quot;a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understand Him&quot;)
sometimes occur
to avoid gender-specific pronouns or to accommodate non-theistic beliefs.
Some Twelve-steppers may adapt references to &quot;God&quot; to refer to a &quot;higher power&quot; or to &quot;HP&quot;.

==Twelve Traditions==

The Twelve Traditions accompany the Twelve Steps. The Traditions provide guidelines for group governance. They were developed in AA in order to help resolve conflicts in the areas of publicity, politics, religion, and finances. Alcoholics Anonymous&#x27; Twelve Traditions are:
# Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon AA unity.
# For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority—a loving God as He may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do not govern.
# The only requirement for AA membership is a desire to stop drinking.
# Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups or AA as a whole.
# Each group has but one primary purpose—to carry its message to the alcoholic who still suffers.
# An AA group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the AA name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property, and prestige divert us from our primary purpose.
# Every AA group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions.
# Alcoholics Anonymous should remain forever non-professional, but our service centers may employ special workers.
# AA, as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service boards or committees directly responsible to those they serve.
# Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the AA name ought never be drawn into public controversy.
# Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we need always to maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio, and films.
# Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.

==Process==
In the twelve-step program, the human structure is symbolically represented in three dimensions: physical, mental, and spiritual. The problems the groups deal with are understood to manifest themselves in each dimension. For addicts and alcoholics, the physical dimension is best described by the allergy-like bodily reaction resulting in the compulsion to continue using substances even when it&#x27;s harmful or the addict wants to quit. The statement in the First Step that the individual is &quot;powerless&quot; over the substance-abuse related behavior at issue refers to the lack of control over this compulsion, which persists despite any negative consequences that may be endured as a result.

The mental obsession is described as the cognitive processes that cause the individual to repeat the compulsive behavior after some period of abstinence, either knowing that the result will be an inability to stop or operating under the delusion that the result will be different. The description in the First Step of the life of the alcoholic or addict as &quot;unmanageable&quot; refers to the lack of choice that the mind of the addict or alcoholic affords concerning whether to drink or use again.
The illness of the spiritual dimension, or &quot;spiritual malady,&quot; is considered in all twelve-step groups to be self-centeredness. The process of working the steps is intended to replace self-centeredness with a growing moral consciousness and a willingness for self-sacrifice and unselfish constructive action. In twelve-step groups, this is known as a &quot;spiritual awakening.&quot; This should not be confused with abreaction, which produces dramatic, but temporary, changes. As a rule, in twelve-step fellowships, spiritual awakening occurs slowly over a period of time, although there are exceptions where members experience a sudden spiritual awakening.

In accordance with the First Step, twelve-step groups emphasize self-admission by members of the problem they are recovering from. It is in this spirit that members often identify themselves along with an admission of their problem, often as &quot;Hi, I’m , and I’m an alcoholic&quot;.

==Sponsorship==
A sponsor is a more experienced person in recovery who guides the less-experienced aspirant (&quot;sponsee&quot;) through the program&#x27;s twelve steps. New members in twelve-step programs are encouraged to secure a relationship with at least one sponsor who both has a sponsor and has taken the twelve steps themselves. Publications from twelve-step fellowships emphasize that sponsorship is a &quot;one on one&quot; nonhierarchical relationship of shared experiences focused on working the Twelve Steps. According to Narcotics Anonymous:

Sponsors share their experience, strength, and hope with their sponsees... A sponsor&#x27;s role is not that of a legal adviser, a banker, a parent, a marriage counselor, or a social worker. Nor is a sponsor a therapist offering some sort of professional advice. A sponsor is simply another addict in recovery who is willing to share his or her journey through the Twelve Steps.

Sponsors and sponsees participate in activities that lead to spiritual growth. Experiences in the program are often shared by outgoing members with incoming members. This rotation of experience is often considered to have a great spiritual reward. These may include practices such as literature discussion and study, meditation, and writing. Completing the program usually implies competency to guide newcomers which is often encouraged. Sponsees typically do their Fifth Step, review their moral inventory written as part of the Fourth Step, with their sponsor. The Fifth Step, as well as the Ninth Step, have been compared to confession and penitence. Michel Foucault, a French philosopher, noted such practices produce intrinsic modifications in the person—exonerating, redeeming and purifying them; relieves them of their burden of wrong, liberating them and promising salvation.

The personal nature of the behavioral issues that lead to seeking help in twelve-step fellowships results in a strong relationship between sponsee and sponsor. As the relationship is based on spiritual principles, it is unique and not generally characterized as &quot;friendship&quot;. Fundamentally, the sponsor has the single purpose of helping the sponsee recover from the behavioral problem that brought the sufferer into twelve-step work, which reflexively helps the sponsor recover.

A study of sponsorship as practiced in Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous found that providing direction and support to other alcoholics and addicts is associated with sustained abstinence for the sponsor, but suggested that there were few short-term benefits for the sponsee&#x27;s one-year sustained abstinence rate.

==Effectiveness==
Alcoholics Anonymous is the largest of all of the twelve-step programs (from which all other twelve-step programs are derived), followed by Narcotics Anonymous; the majority of twelve-step members are recovering from addiction to alcohol or other drugs. The majority of twelve-step programs, however, address illnesses other than substance addiction. For example, the third-largest twelve-step program, Al-Anon, assists family members and friends of people who have alcoholism and other addictions. About twenty percent of twelve-step programs are for substance addiction recovery, the other eighty percent address a variety of problems from debt to depression. It would be an error to assume the effectiveness of twelve-step methods at treating problems in one domain translates to all or to another domain.

A 2020 Cochrane review of Alcoholics Anonymous showed that participation in AA resulted in more alcoholics being abstinent from alcohol and for longer periods of time than cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational enhancement therapy, and as effective as these in other measures. The 2020 review did not compare twelve step programs to the use of disulfiram or naltrexone, though some patients did receive these medications. These medications are considered the standard of care in alcohol use disorder treatment among medical experts and have demonstrated efficacy in randomized-controlled trials in promoting alcohol abstinence. A systematic review published in 2017 found that twelve-step programs for reducing illicit drug use are neither better nor worse than other interventions, though the researchers behind the review noted the weakness of most of the studies analyzed, which may lead to interpretations of their results that did not accurately reflect the actual picture.

==Criticism==
Some medical professionals have criticized twelve-step programs as &quot;a cult that relies on God as the mechanism of action&quot; and as lacking any experimental evidence in favor of its efficacy. Ethical and operational issues had prevented robust randomized controlled trials from being conducted comparing twelve-step programs directly to other approaches. More recent studies employing non-randomized and quasi-experimental studies have shown twelve-step programs provide similar benefit compared to motivational enhancement therapy (MET) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and were more effective in producing continuous abstinence and remission compared to these approaches.

===Confidentiality===
The Twelve Traditions encourage members to practice the spiritual principle of anonymity in the public media and members are also asked to respect each other&#x27;s confidentiality. This is a group norm, however, and not legally mandated; there are no legal consequences to discourage those attending twelve-step groups from revealing information disclosed during meetings. Statutes on group therapy do not encompass those associations that lack a professional therapist or clergyman to whom confidentiality and privilege might apply. Professionals and paraprofessionals who refer patients to these groups, to avoid both civil liability and licensure problems, have been advised that they should alert their patients that, at any time, their statements made in meetings may be disclosed.

===Cultural identity===
One review warned of detrimental iatrogenic effects of twelve-step philosophy and labeled the organizations as cults, while another review asserts that these programs bore little semblance to religious cults and that the techniques used appeared beneficial to some. Another study found that a twelve-step program&#x27;s focus on self-admission of having a problem increases deviant stigma and strips members of their previous cultural identity, replacing it with the deviant identity. Another study asserts that the prior cultural identity may not be replaced entirely, but rather members found adapted a bicultural identity.

<text>The Washington Times is an American conservative daily newspaper published in Washington, D.C. It covers general interest topics with an emphasis on national politics. Its broadsheet daily edition is distributed throughout Washington, D.C. and the greater Washington metropolitan area, including suburban Maryland and Northern Virginia. It also publishes a subscription-based weekly tabloid edition aimed at a national audience.

The first edition of &quot;The Washington Times&quot; was published on May 17, 1982. The newspaper was founded by Unification Church leader Sun Myung Moon, and it was owned until 2010 by News World Communications, an international media conglomerate founded by Moon. It is currently owned by Operations Holdings, which is a part of the Unification Church movement.

&quot;The Washington Times&quot; has been known for its conservative political stance, often supporting the policies of Republican presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump.

&quot;The Washington Times&quot; has published columns contradicting scientific consensus on multiple environmental and health issues. It has drawn controversy by publishing conspiracy theories about U.S. president Barack Obama and supporting neo-confederate historical revisionism.

==History==
===1980s===

&quot;The Washington Times&quot; was founded May 17, 1982, by News World Communications, a New York City-based international media conglomerate associated with the Unification Church, which also owns United Press International (UPI) and newspapers in Japan, South America, and South Korea.

Bo Hi Pak, chief aide to Unification Church founder and leader Sun Myung Moon, was the founding president and founding chairman of the board. Moon asked Richard L. Rubenstein, a rabbi and college professor who had written on the Holocaust, to serve on the board of directors. The newspaper&#x27;s first editor and publisher was James R. Whelan.

&quot;The Washington Times&quot; was founded one year after &quot;The Washington Star&quot;, a Washington, D.C. daily newspaper, went out of business, leaving the city with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as its only daily newspaper. A large percentage of the newspaper&#x27;s news staff came from the &quot;Star&quot;.

Unusual among daily newspapers when &quot;The Washington Times&quot; was founded, the newspaper published full color front pages in all its sections and color elements throughout. It also used ink that it advertised as being less likely to come off on the reader&#x27;s hands than the type used by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. At its start, it had 125 reporters, 25 percent of whom were members of the Unification Church of the United States.

President Ronald Reagan read &quot;The Washington Times&quot; every day during his presidency. In 1997, he said: &quot;The American people know the truth. You, my friends at &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, have told it to them. It wasn&#x27;t always the popular thing to do. But you were a loud and powerful voice. Like me, you arrived in Washington at the beginning of the most momentous decade of the century. Together, we rolled up our sleeves and got to work. And—oh, yes—we won the Cold War.&quot;

After a brief editorship under Smith Hempstone, Arnaud de Borchgrave, a former UPI and &quot;Newsweek&quot; reporter, became executive editor, serving from 1985 to 1991. Borchgrave was credited with encouraging energetic reporting by staff but was known to make unorthodox journalistic decisions. During his tenure, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; mounted a fundraising drive for Contra rebels in Nicaragua and offered rewards for information leading to the arrest of Nazi war criminals.

From 1985 to 2008, News World published a weekly news magazine called &quot;Insight on the News&quot;, also called just &quot;Insight&quot;, as a companion to &quot;The Washington Times&quot;. &quot;Insight&quot;″s reporting sometimes resulted in journalistic controversy.

===1990s===

In 1991, Moon said he had spent between $900 million and $1 billion on &quot;The Washington Times&quot;. By 2002, Moon had spent between $1.7 billion and $2 billion, according to different estimates.

Wesley Pruden, previously a correspondent and then a managing editor of &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, was named executive editor in 1991. During his editorship, the paper took a strongly conservative and nativist editorial stance.

In 1992, North Korean leader Kim Il Sung gave his first and only interview with the Western news media to &quot;The Washington Times&quot; reporter Josette Sheeran, who later became executive director of the United Nations World Food Programme. 

In 1992, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; had one-eighth the circulation of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; (100,000 compared to 800,000) and two-thirds of its subscribers subscribed to both papers. In 1994, it introduced a weekly national edition, which was published in a tabloid format and distributed nationally. U.S. President George H. W. Bush encouraged the political influence of &quot;The Washington Times&quot; and other Unification Church movement activism in support of American foreign policy. 

In 1997, the &quot;Washington Report on Middle East Affairs,&quot; which is critical of U.S. and Israeli policies, praised &quot;The Washington Times&quot; and its sister publication, &quot;The Middle East Times&quot;, for what it called their objective and informative coverage of Islam and the Middle East, while criticizing &quot;The Washington Times&quot; for its generally pro-Israel editorial positions. The &quot;Report&quot; suggested that these newspapers and &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, each owned by religious institutions, were less influenced by pro-Israel pressure groups than corporate-owned newspapers.

===2000s===

In 2002, at an event held to celebrate &quot;The Washington Times&quot;″ 20th anniversary, Moon said, &quot;&quot;The Washington Times&quot; is responsible to let the American people know about God&quot; and &quot;&quot;The Washington Times&quot; will become the instrument in spreading the truth about God to the world.&quot;

In 2004, David Ignatius, a correspondent for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, reported that Chung Hwan Kwak, a leader in the Unification Church, wanted &quot;The Washington Times&quot; to &quot;support international organizations such as the United Nations and to campaign for world peace and interfaith understanding.&quot; This, Ignatius wrote, created difficulties for Pruden and some of &quot;The Washington Times&quot;″ columnists. Ignatius also mentioned the Unification Church movement&#x27;s reconciliatory attitude towards North Korea, which at the time included joint business ventures, and Kwak&#x27;s advocacy for greater understanding between the U.S. and the Islamic world as issues of contention. Ignatius predicted that conservatives in Congress and the George W. Bush administration would support Pruden&#x27;s position over Kwak&#x27;s.

In 2006, Moon&#x27;s son, Hyun Jin Moon, president and CEO of News World Communications, dismissed managing editor Francis &quot;Fran&quot; Coombs following accusations of racist editorializing. Coombs had made some racist and sexist comments, for which he was sued by other employees at &quot;The Washington Times&quot;.

In January 2008, Pruden retired, and John F. Solomon, who worked with the Associated Press and had most recently been head of investigative reporting and mixed media development at &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, was appointed executive editor.

A month later, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; changed some of its style guide to conform more to what was becoming mainstream media usage. It announced that it would no longer use words like &quot;illegal aliens&quot; and &quot;homosexual&quot; and, in most cases, opt for &quot;more neutral terminology&quot; like &quot;illegal immigrants&quot; and &quot;gay&quot;, respectively. It also decided to stop using &quot;Hillary&quot; when referring to then U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton, and the word &quot;marriage&quot; in the expression &quot;gay marriage&quot; would no longer appear in quotes in the newspaper. These policy changes drew criticism from some conservatives. &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine attributed &quot;The Washington Times&quot;″ apparent political moderation to differences of opinion over the United Nations and North Korea, and wrote, &quot;The Republican right may be losing its most devoted media ally.&quot;

In November 2009, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;The Washington Times&quot; would no longer be receiving funds from the Unification Church movement and might have to cease publication or become an online publication only. Later that year, it dismissed 40 percent of its 370 employees and stopped its subscription service, instead distributing the paper free in some areas of the Washington metropolitan area, including federal government departments and agencies. However, a subscription website owned by the paper, theconservatives.com, and the &quot;Times&quot;″ three-hour radio program, &quot;America&#x27;s Morning News&quot;, both continued. The paper also announced that it would cease publication of its Sunday edition, along with other changes, partly in order to end its reliance on subsidies from the Unification Church.

On December 31, 2009, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; announced that it would no longer be a full-service newspaper, eliminating its metropolitan news and sports sections.

===2010s===

In July 2010, the Unification Church issued a letter protesting the direction &quot;The Washington Times&quot; was taking and urging closer ties with it. In August 2010, a deal was made to sell it to a group more closely related to the movement. Editor-in-chief Sam Dealey said that this was a welcome development among the &quot;Times&quot;″ staff.

In November 2010, Moon and a group of former editors purchased &quot;The Washington Times&quot; from News World Communications for $1. This ended a conflict within the Moon family that had been threatening to shut down the paper completely. In June 2011, Ed Kelley, formerly of &quot;The Oklahoman&quot;, was hired as editor overseeing both news and opinion content.

In March 2011, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; announced that some former staffers would be rehired and that the paper would bring back its sports, metro, and life sections.

In 2012, Douglas D. M. Joo stepped down as senior executive, president, and chairman. &quot;Times&quot; president Tom McDevitt took his place as chairman, and Larry Beasley was hired as the company&#x27;s new president and chief executive officer.

In March 2013, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; partnered with Herring Networks to create a new conservative cable news channel, One America News Network (OAN), which began broadcasting in mid‑2013.

In July 2013, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; hired David Keene, former president of the National Rifle Association and chairman of the American Conservative Union, to serve as its opinion editor.

In September 2013, Solomon returned as editor and vice president of content and business development. Solomon&#x27;s tenure was marked by a focus on profitability.

In September 2015, the newspaper had its first profitable month, ending a streak of monthly financial losses over the paper&#x27;s first 33 years. In December 2015, Solomon left for &quot;Circa News&quot;.

&quot;The Washington Times&quot; opinion editor Charles Hurt was one of Trump&#x27;s earliest supporters in Washington, D.C.
During the 2016 presidential election, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; did not endorse a presidential candidate, but it endorsed Trump for reelection in the 2020 presidential election.

===2020s===
In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; received between $1 million and $2 million in federal-backed small business loans from Citibank as related of the Paycheck Protection Program. The Washington Times which it said helped retain of its 91 employees. During the 2024 presidential election, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; endorsed Trump for election.

==Reactions==
In the 1980s, reporters for &quot;The Washington Times&quot; visited imprisoned then South African activist Nelson Mandela, who wrote about the newspaper in his autobiography, &quot;Long Walk to Freedom&quot;. He said, &quot;They seemed less intent on finding out my views than on proving that I was a Communist and a terrorist. All of their questions were slanted in that direction, and when I reiterated that I was neither a Communist nor a terrorist, they attempted to show that I was not a Christian either by asserting that the Reverend Martin Luther King never resorted to violence.&quot;

&quot;The Washington Times&quot; holds a conservative political stance. In 1995, the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; wrote that &quot;The Washington Times&quot; &quot;is like no major city daily in America in the way that it wears its political heart on its sleeve. No major paper in America would dare be so partisan.&quot; In 2002, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the newspaper &quot;was established by Moon to combat communism and be a conservative alternative to what Moon perceived as the liberal leanings of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Since then, the paper has fought to prove its editorial independence, trying to demonstrate that it is neither a &quot;Moonie paper&quot; nor a booster of the political right but rather a fair and balanced reporter of the news.&quot;

In October 2002, veteran &quot;Washington Post&quot; editor Ben Bradlee complimented &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, saying, &quot;I see them get some local stories that I think the &quot;Post&quot; doesn&#x27;t have and should have had.&quot; In 2007, &quot;Mother Jones&quot; reported that &quot;The Washington Times&quot; had become &quot;essential reading for political news junkies&quot; soon after its founding, and described it as a &quot;conservative newspaper with close ties to every Republican administration since Reagan.&quot;

In August 2008, in a &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; essay, American historian Thomas Frank linked &quot;The Washington Times&quot; to the modern American conservative movement, saying: &quot;There is even a daily newspaper—&quot;The Washington Times&quot;—published strictly for the movement&#x27;s benefit, a propaganda sheet whose distortions are so obvious and so alien that it puts one in mind of those official party organs one encounters when traveling in authoritarian countries.&quot;

In January 2011, conservative commentator Paul Weyrich said, &quot;&quot;The Washington Post&quot; became very arrogant and they just decided that they would determine what was news and what wasn&#x27;t news and they wouldn&#x27;t cover a lot of things that went on. And &quot;The Washington Times&quot; has forced the &quot;Post&quot; to cover a lot of things that they wouldn&#x27;t cover if the &quot;Times&quot; wasn&#x27;t in existence.&quot;

In December 2012, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;The Washington Times&quot; had become &quot;a crucial training ground for many rising conservative journalists and a must-read for those in the movement. A veritable who&#x27;s who of conservatives—Tony Blankley, Frank J. Gaffney Jr., Larry Kudlow, John Podhoretz and Tony Snow—has churned out copy for its pages.&quot; The &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; noted that reporters for &quot;The Washington Times&quot; had used it as a springboard to other mainstream news outlets.

==Controversies==
=== General controversies ===
Some former employees, including Whelan, have insisted that &quot;The Washington Times&quot; was always under Moon&#x27;s control. Whelan, whose contract guaranteed editorial autonomy, left the paper in 1984 when the owners refused to renew his contract. Three years later, editorial page editor William P. Cheshire and four of his staff resigned, charging that, at the explicit direction of Sang Kook Han, a top official of the Unification Church, executive editor Arnaud de Borchgrave had stifled editorial criticism of political repression in South Korea under President Chun Doo-hwan.

In 1982, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; refused to publish film critic Scott Sublett&#x27;s negative review of the movie &quot;Inchon&quot;, which was also sponsored by the Unification Church.

In 1988, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; published a misleading story suggesting that Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis had sought psychiatric help, and included a quote from Dukakis&#x27; sister-in-law saying &quot;it is possible&quot; he visited a psychiatrist. However, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; misleadingly clipped the full quote by the sister-in-law, which was: &quot;It&#x27;s possible, but I doubt it.&quot;

Reporter Peggy Weyrich quit in 1991 after one of her articles about Anita Hill&#x27;s testimony in the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nominee hearings was rewritten to depict Hill as a &quot;fantasizer&quot;.

During the presidency of Bill Clinton &quot;The Washington Times&quot; reporting on his alleged sex scandals was often picked up by other, more respected, news media which contributed to enhanced public awareness of the topic, and eventually to Clinton&#x27;s impeachment. In 1999 the Senate voted to acquit Clinton, allowing him to complete his second term as president.

In a 1997 column in &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, Frank Gaffney falsely alleged that a seismic incident in Russia was a nuclear detonation at that nation&#x27;s Novaya Zemlya test site, which would have meant that Russia had violated the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTB). Subsequent scientific analysis of the Novaya Zemlya event showed that it was a routine earthquake. Reporting on the allegation, the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; observed that following its publication: &quot;fax machines around Washington, D.C. and across the country poured out pages detailing Russian duplicity. They came from Frank Gaffney.&quot;

In 2002, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; published a story accusing the National Educational Association (NEA), the largest teachers&#x27; union in the United States, of teaching students that the policies of the U.S. government were partly responsible for the 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. The NEA responded to the story by denying all of its accusations. Brendan Nyhan, later a political science professor at the University of Michigan, wrote that &quot;The Washington Times&quot; story was a lie and a myth.

In 2018, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; published a commentary piece by retired U.S. Navy admiral James A. Lyons which promoted conspiracy theories about the murder of Seth Rich. Lyon wrote that it was &quot;well known in intelligence circles that Seth Rich and his brother, Aaron Rich, downloaded the DNC emails and was paid by WikiLeaks for that information.&quot; The piece cited no evidence for the assertion. Aaron Rich filed a lawsuit against &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, saying that it acted with &quot;reckless disregard for the truth&quot; and that it did not retract or remove the piece after &quot;receiving notice of the falsity of the statements about Aaron after the publication&quot;. Rich and &quot;The Washington Times&quot; settled their lawsuit, and the paper issued an unusually robust retraction.

On January 6, 2021, after violent pro-Trump rioters attacked the United States Capitol, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; published a false story quoting an unidentified retired military officer claiming that the facial recognition system company XRVision had used its technology and identified two members of antifa amid the mob. XRVision quickly denied this, sending a cease and desist to &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, and issued a statement saying that its technology had actually identified two Neo-Nazis and a believer in the QAnon conspiracy theory and that it had not done any detection work for a retired military officer authorized to share that information. On January 7, the article was removed from the website and replaced with a corrected version. Before the correction, Representative Matt Gaetz cited the original story as proof that antifa were partially responsible for the attack in the floor debate of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count, and it was widely shared on social media.

&quot;The Washington Times&quot; has twice published articles, one written by the ambassador of Turkey to the United States and one by an attorney and lobbyist for the Turkish government, that featured Armenian genocide denial.

=== Science coverage ===
==== Climate change denial ====
&quot;The Washington Times&quot; has promoted climate change denial. Michael E. Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, characterizes &quot;The Washington Times&quot; as a prominent outlet that propagates &quot;climate change disinformation&quot;. Naomi Oreskes, Professor of the History of Science at Harvard University, and Erik M. Conway, historian of science at NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, wrote in their 2010 book &quot;Merchants of Doubt&quot; that &quot;The Washington Times&quot; has given the public a false sense that the science of anthropogenic climate change was in dispute by giving disproportionate coverage of fringe viewpoints and by preventing scientists from rebutting coverage in &quot;The Washingon Times&quot;. &quot;The Washington Times&quot; reprinted a column by Steve Milloy criticizing research of climate change in the Arctic without disclosing Milloy&#x27;s financial ties to the fossil fuel industry.

During the Climatic Research Unit email controversy (also known as &quot;Climategate&quot;) in 2009 in the lead-up to the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; wrote in an editorial: &quot;these revelations of fudged science should have a cooling effect on global-warming hysteria and the panicked policies that are being pushed forward to address the unproven theory.&quot; Eight committees investigated the controversy and found no evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct. In 2010, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; published an article claiming that February 2010 snow storms &quot;Undermin[e] The Case For Global Warming One Flake At A Time&quot;. A 2014 &quot;The Washington Times&quot; editorial mocked the &quot;global warming scam&quot; and asserted: &quot;The planetary thermometer hasn&#x27;t budged in 15 years. Wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes and other &#x27;extreme&#x27; weather events are at normal or below-normal levels. Pacific islands aren&#x27;t submerged. There&#x27;s so much ice the polar bears are celebrating.&quot; &quot;The Washington Times&quot; cited a blog post in support of these claims; PolitiFact fact-checked the claims in the blog post and concluded it was &quot;pants-on-fire&quot; false. &quot;The Washington Times&quot; later said that a NASA scientist claimed that global warming was on a &quot;hiatus&quot; and that NASA had found evidence of global cooling; Rebecca Leber of &quot;The New Republic&quot; said that the NASA scientist in question said the opposite of what &quot;The Washington Times&quot; claimed.

In 2015, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; published a column by Republican Texas congressman Lamar Smith in which he argued that the work of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was &quot;not good science, [but] science fiction.&quot; The American Association for the Advancement of Science and six other scientific organizations objected to Smith&#x27;s politicalisation of scientific research saying: &quot;Scientists should not be subjected to fraud investigations or harassment simply for providing scientific results that some may see as politically controversial. Science cannot thrive when policymakers—regardless of party affiliation—use policy disagreements as a pretext to attack scientific conclusions.&quot;

In 1993, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; published articles purporting to debunk climate change. It headlined its story about the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on climate change: &quot;Under the deal, the use of coal, oil and other fossil fuel in the United States would be cut by more than one-third by 2002, resulting in lower standards of living for consumers and a long-term reduction in economic growth.&quot;

In November 2021, a study by the Center for Countering Digital Hate described &quot;The Washington Times&quot; as being among &quot;ten fringe publishers&quot; that together were responsible for nearly 70 percent of Facebook user interactions with content that denied climate change. Facebook disputed the study&#x27;s methodology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porterfield_11/2/2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Toxic_Ten_11/2/2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ozone depletion denial====
In the 1990s, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; published columns which cast doubt on the scientific consensus on the causes of ozone depletion (which had led to the &quot;ozone hole&quot;). It published columns disputing the science as late as 2000. In 1991, NASA scientists warned of the potential of a major Arctic ozone hole developing in the spring of 1992 due to elevated levels of chlorine monoxide in the Arctic stratosphere. However, as the Arctic winter was unusually warm, the chemical reactions needed for ozone depletion did not occur. Even though the science was not incorrect, &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, along with other conservative media, subsequently created a &quot;crying wolf&quot; narrative, where scientists were portrayed as political activists who were following an environmental agenda rather than the science. In 1992, it published an editorial saying: &quot;This is not the disinterested, objective, just-the-facts tone one ordinarily expects from scientists... This is the cry of the apocalyptic, laying the groundwork for a decidedly non-scientific end: public policy... it would be nice if the next time NASA cries &#x27;wolf,&#x27; fewer journalists, politicians and citizens heed the warning like sheep.&quot;

==== Second-hand smoke denial====
In 1995, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; published a column by Fred Singer, who is known for promoting views contrary to mainstream science on a number of issues, where Singer referred to the science on the adverse health impact of second-hand smoke as the &quot;second-hand smoke scare&quot; and accused the Environmental Protection Agency of distorting data when it classified second-hand smoke as harmful. Singer&#x27;s column also denied the scientific consensus on climate change and on the health risks of exposure to environmental radiation. In 1995, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; published an editorial titled &quot;How not to spend science dollars&quot; condemning a grant to the National Cancer Institute to study how political contributions from tobacco companies shape policy-making and the voting behavior of politicians.

====Controversial reporting on the COVID-19 pandemic====
In January 2020, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; published two articles about the COVID-19 pandemic that suggested that the virus was created by the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China as a biological weapon. One article quoted a former Israeli intelligence officer as a source. The two articles were shared on hundreds of social media sites, potentially reaching an audience of millions.

=== Allegations of racism===
Under Pruden&#x27;s editorship (1992–2008), &quot;The Washington Times&quot; regularly printed excerpts from racist hard-right publications including VDARE and &quot;American Renaissance&quot;, and from Bill White, leader of the American National Socialist Workers&#x27; Party, in its Culture Briefs section.

In 2013, &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; reported that under Pruden&#x27;s editorship &quot;The Washington Times&quot; was: &quot;a forum for the racialist hard right, including white nationalists, neo-Confederates, and anti-immigrant scare mongers.&quot; Between 1998 and 2004, the &quot;Times&quot; covered every biennial &quot;American Renaissance&quot; conference, hosted by the white supremacist New Century Foundation. According to the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;, &quot;the paper&#x27;s coverage of these events—which are hotbeds for holocaust deniers, neo-Nazis, and eugenicists—was stunningly one sided&quot;, and favorably depicted the conference and attendees. In 2009, journalist David Neiwert wrote that it championed, &quot;various white-nationalist causes emanating from the neo-Confederate movement (with which, until a recent housecleaning, two senior editors had long associations.)&quot;

A page in &quot;The Washington Times&quot;″ Sunday edition was devoted to the American Civil War, on which the Confederacy was several times described with admiration. In 1993, Pruden gave an interview to the neo-Confederate magazine &quot;Southern Partisan&quot;, which has been called &quot;arguably the most important neo-Confederate periodical&quot; by the Southern Poverty Law Center, where he said: &quot;Every year I make sure that we have a story in the paper about any observance of Robert E. Lee&#x27;s birthday.&quot; Pruden said, &quot;And the fact that it falls around Martin Luther King&#x27;s birthday,&quot; to which a &quot;Southern Partisan&quot; interviewer interjected, &quot;Makes it all the better,&quot; with Pruden finishing, &quot;I make sure we have a story. Oh, yes.&quot;

==== Sam Francis controversy ====

&quot;The Washington Times&quot; employed Sam Francis, a white nationalist, as a columnist and editor, beginning in 1991 after he was chosen by Pat Buchanan to take over his column.

In 1995, Francis resigned or was forced out after Dinesh D&#x27;Souza reported on racist comments that Francis made at a conference hosted by &quot;American Renaissance&quot; the previous year. At the conference, Francis called on whites to: &quot;reassert our identity and our solidarity, and we must do so in explicitly racial terms through the articulation of a racial consciousness as whites... The civilization that we as whites created in Europe and America could not have developed apart from the genetic endowments of the creating people.&quot;

Francis was an aide to Republican senator John East of North Carolina before joining the editorial staff of &quot;The Washington Times&quot; in 1986. Five years later, he became a columnist for the newspaper, and his column became syndicated. In addition to his journalistic career, Francis was an adjunct scholar at the Ludwig von Mises Institute of Auburn, Alabama.

In June 1995, editor-in-chief Wesley Pruden &quot;had cut back on Francis&#x27; column&quot; after &quot;The Washington Times&quot; ran his essay criticizing the Southern Baptist Convention for its approval of a resolution which apologized for slavery. In the piece, Francis asserted that &quot;The contrition of the Southern Baptists for slavery and racism is a bit more than a politically fashionable gesture intended to massage race relations&quot; and that &quot;Neither slavery&#x27; nor racism&#x27; as an institution is a sin.&quot;

In September 1995, Pruden dismissed Francis from &quot;The Washington Times&quot; after conservative journalist Dinesh D&#x27;Souza, in a column in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, described Francis&#x27;s appearance at the 1994 &quot;American Renaissance&quot; conference:

A lively controversialist, Francis began with some largely valid complaints about how the Southern heritage is demonized in mainstream culture. He went on, however, to attack the liberal principles of humanism and universalism for facilitating &quot;the war against the white race&quot;. At one point he described country music megastar Garth Brooks as &quot;repulsive&quot; because &quot;he has that stupid universalist song &quot;(We Shall Be Free)&quot;, in which we all intermarry.&quot;

After D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s column was published, Pruden &quot;decided he did not want the &quot;Times&quot; associated with such views after looking into other Francis writings, in which he advocated the possible deportation of legal immigrants and forced birth control for welfare mothers.&quot;

When Francis died in 2005, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; wrote a &quot;glowing&quot; obituary that omitted his racist beliefs and his firing from the paper, and described him as a &quot;scholarly, challenging and sometimes pungent writer&quot;; in response, editor David Mastio of the conservative &quot;Washington Examiner&quot; wrote in an obituary: &quot;Sam Francis was merely a racist and doesn&#x27;t deserve to be remembered as anything less.&quot; Mastio added that Francis: &quot;led a double life by day he served up conservative, red meat that was strong but never quite out of bounds by mainstream standards; by night, unbeknownst to the &quot;Times&quot; or his syndicate, he pushed white supremacist ideas.&quot;

==== Southern Poverty Law Center report ====
The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) noted that &quot;The Washington Times&quot; had, by 2005, published at least 35 articles by Marian Kester Coombs, who was married to managing editor Francis Coombs. She had a record of racially incendiary rhetoric and had written for the white nationalist magazine &quot;The Occidental Quarterly&quot;, which has been described as a &quot;stalwart&quot; of the alt-right movement in the United States and as a &quot;far-right, racially obsessed US magazine&quot;. The SPLC highlighted columns written by Marian Kester Coombs in &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, in which she asserted that the whole of human history was &quot;the struggle of ... races&quot;; that non-white immigration is the &quot;importing [of] poverty and revolution&quot; that will end in &quot;the eventual loss of sovereign American territory&quot;; and that Muslims in England &quot;are turning life in this once pleasant land into a misery for its native inhabitants.&quot;

=== Coverage of Barack Obama ===
In 2007 &quot;The Washington Times&quot;″ companion news magazine &quot;Insight on the News&quot;, also called just &quot;Insight&quot;, published a story which claimed that someone on the campaign staff of American presidential candidate Senator Hillary Clinton had leaked a report to one of &quot;Insight&#x27;s&quot; reporters which said that Obama had &quot;spent at least four years in a so-called madrassa, or Muslim seminary, in Indonesia&quot;. &quot;Insight&#x27;s&quot; editor, Jeff Kuhner, also claimed that the source said that the Clinton campaign was &quot;preparing an accusation that her rival Senator Barack Obama had covered up a brief period he had spent in an Islamic religious school in Indonesia when he was six.&quot; Clinton denied the allegations. When interviewed by the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Kuhner refused to name the person said to be the reporter&#x27;s source to the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

&quot;Insight&#x27;s&quot; story was reported on first by conservative talk radio and &quot;Fox News Channel&quot;, and then by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other major newspapers. CNN reporter John Vause visited State Elementary School Menteng 01, a secular public school which Obama had attended for one year after attending a Roman Catholic school for three, and found that each student received two hours of religious instruction per week in his or her own faith. He was told by Hardi Priyono, deputy headmaster of the school, &quot;This is a public school. We don&#x27;t focus on religion. In our daily lives, we try to respect religion, but we don&#x27;t give preferential treatment.&quot; Students at Besuki wore Western clothing, and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; described the school as &quot;so progressive that teachers wore miniskirts and all students were encouraged to celebrate Christmas&quot;. Interviews by Nedra Pickler of the Associated Press found that students of all faiths have been welcome there since before Obama&#x27;s attendance. Akmad Solichin, the vice principal of the school, told Pickler: &quot;The allegations are completely baseless. Yes, most of our students are Muslim, but there are Christians as well. Everyone&#x27;s welcome here ... it&#x27;s a public school.&quot;

In 2008, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; published a column by Frank Gaffney that promoted the false conspiracy theories which asserted that President Barack Obama was born in Kenya and was courting the &quot;jihadist vote&quot;. Gaffney also published pieces in 2009 and 2010 promoting the false assertion that Obama is a Muslim.

In a 2009 column entitled Inner Muslim&#x27; at work in Cairo&quot;, Pruden wrote that President Obama was the: &quot;first president without an instinctive appreciation of the culture, history, tradition, common law and literature whence America sprang. The genetic imprint writ large in his 43 predecessors is missing from the Obama DNA.&quot; In another 2009 column, Pruden wrote that Obama had &quot;no natural instinct or blood impulse&quot; for what America was about because he was &quot;sired by a Kenyan father&quot; and &quot;born to a mother attracted to men of the Third World.&quot; Pruden&#x27;s columns stirred rudeness and controversy, leading &quot;The Washington Times&quot; to assign David Mastio, its deputy editor, to edit his work.

In 2016, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; claimed that $3.6 million in federal funds were spent on a 2013 golf outing for President Obama and pro-golfer Tiger Woods which was widely reported on by the American news media in 2013. &quot;Snopes&quot; rated the article &quot;mostly false&quot;, because the estimated cost included both official presidential travel and a brief vacation in Florida. The online article contained hyperlinks to other, unrelated, stories from &quot;The Washington Times&quot;. These links&#x27; appearance were not readily distinguishable from the citation links sometimes used to support or substantiate reporting. Not included in &quot;The Washington Times&quot; the article were any links to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report of expenditure for the 2013 trip, which included a detailed overview of President Obama&#x27;s activities of February 15 to 18, 2013.

===Islamophobia and anti-Muslim===
Gaffney, known for his &quot;long history of pushing extreme anti-Muslim views&quot;, wrote weekly columns for &quot;The Washington Times&quot; from the late 1990s to 2016. According to John Esposito, a Professor of Religion and International Affairs and of Islamic Studies at Georgetown University, Gaffney&#x27;s &quot;editorial track record in the &quot;Washington Times&quot; is long on accusation and short on supportive evidence.&quot; In columns for the &quot;Times&quot;, Gaffney helped to popularize conspiracy theories that Islamic terrorists were infiltrating the Bush administration, the conservative movement and the Obama administration. In 2015, the &quot;Times&quot; published a column describing refugees fleeing the Syrian Civil War as an &quot;Islamic Trojan Horse&quot; conducting a &quot;&#x27;jihad&#x27; by another name&quot;.

The Muslim advocacy group Council on American–Islamic Relations listed &quot;The Washington Times&quot; among media outlets it said &quot;regularly demonstrates or supports Islamophobic themes.&quot; In 1998, the Egyptian newspaper &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; wrote that &quot;The Washington Times&quot; its editorial policy was &quot;rabidly anti-Arab, anti-Muslim and pro-Israel.&quot;

<text>In topology, the [[Heinrich Tietze|Tietze]] extension theorem (also known as the Tietze–[[Pavel Urysohn|Urysohn]]–[[L. E. J. Brouwer|Brouwer]] extension theorem or Urysohn-Brouwer lemma) states that any real-valued, continuous function on a closed subset of a normal topological space can be extended to the entire space, preserving boundedness if necessary.

==Formal statement==
If formula_1 is a normal space and
formula_2
is a continuous map from a closed subset formula_3 of formula_1 into the real numbers formula_5 carrying the standard topology, then there exists a of formula_6 to formula_7 that is, there exists a map
formula_8
continuous on all of formula_1 with formula_10 for all formula_11 Moreover, formula_12 may be chosen such that 
formula_13
that is, if formula_6 is bounded then formula_12 may be chosen to be bounded (with the same bound as formula_6).

==Proof==
The function formula_12 is constructed iteratively. Firstly, we define
formula_18
Observe that formula_19 and formula_20 are closed and disjoint subsets of formula_3. By taking a linear combination of the function obtained from the proof of Urysohn&#x27;s lemma, there exists a continuous function formula_22 such that
formula_23
and furthermore 
formula_24
on formula_1. In particular, it follows that 
formula_26
on formula_3. We now use induction to construct a sequence of continuous functions formula_28 such that 
formula_29
We&#x27;ve shown that this holds for formula_30 and assume that formula_31 have been constructed. Define
formula_32
and repeat the above argument replacing formula_33 with formula_34 and replacing formula_6 with formula_36. Then we find that there exists a continuous function formula_37 such that 
formula_38
By the inductive hypothesis, formula_39 hence we obtain the required identities and the induction is complete. Now, we define a continuous function formula_40 as 
formula_41
Given formula_42,
formula_43
Therefore, the sequence formula_44 is Cauchy. Since the space of continuous functions on formula_1 together with the sup norm is a complete metric space, it follows that there exists a continuous function formula_46 such that formula_47 converges uniformly to formula_12. Since 
formula_49
on formula_3, it follows that formula_51 on formula_3. Finally, we observe that 
formula_53
hence formula_12 is bounded and has the same bound as formula_6. formula_56

==History==
L. E. J. Brouwer and Henri Lebesgue proved a special case of the theorem, when formula_1 is a finite-dimensional real vector space. Heinrich Tietze extended it to all metric spaces, and Pavel Urysohn proved the theorem as stated here, for normal topological spaces.

==Equivalent statements==
This theorem is equivalent to Urysohn&#x27;s lemma (which is also equivalent to the normality of the space) and is widely applicable, since all metric spaces and all compact Hausdorff spaces are normal. It can be generalized by replacing formula_5 with formula_59 for some indexing set formula_60 any retract of formula_61 or any normal absolute retract whatsoever.

==Variations==
If formula_1 is a metric space, formula_3 a non-empty subset of formula_1 and formula_65 is a Lipschitz continuous function with Lipschitz constant formula_66 then formula_6 can be extended to a Lipschitz continuous function formula_68 with same constant formula_69
This theorem is also valid for Hölder continuous functions, that is, if formula_65 is Hölder continuous function with constant less than or equal to formula_71 then formula_6 can be extended to a Hölder continuous function formula_68 with the same constant.

Another variant (in fact, generalization) of Tietze&#x27;s theorem is due to H.Tong and Z. Ercan:
Let formula_3 be a closed subset of a normal topological space formula_75 If formula_76 is an upper semicontinuous function, formula_77 a lower semicontinuous function, and formula_78 a continuous function such that formula_79 for each formula_80 and formula_81 for each formula_82, then there is a continuous
extension formula_83 of formula_84 such that formula_85 for each formula_86 
This theorem is also valid with some additional hypothesis if formula_5 is replaced by a general locally solid Riesz space.

Dugundji (1951) extends the theorem as follows: If formula_1 is a metric space, formula_89 is a locally convex topological vector space, formula_3 is a closed subset of formula_1 and formula_92 is continuous, then it could be extended to a continuous function formula_93 defined on all of formula_1. Moreover, the extension could be chosen such that formula_95
