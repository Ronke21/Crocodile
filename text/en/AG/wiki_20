<text>A stellarator confines plasma using external magnets. Scientists aim to use stellarators to generate fusion power. It is one of many types of magnetic confinement fusion devices. The name &quot;stellarator&quot; refers to stars because fusion mostly occurs in stars such as the Sun. It is one of the earliest human-designed fusion power devices.

The stellarator was invented by American scientist Lyman Spitzer in 1951. Much of its early development was carried out by Spitzer&#x27;s team at what became the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL). Spitzer&#x27;s Model A began operation in 1953 and demonstrated plasma confinement. Larger models followed, but demonstrated poor performance, losing plasma at rates far worse than theoretical predictions. By the early 1960s, hopes of producing a commercial machine faded, and attention turned to studying fundamental theory. By the mid-1960s, Spitzer was convinced that the stellarator was matching the Bohm diffusion rate, which suggested it would never be a practical fusion device.

The release of information on the USSR&#x27;s tokamak design in 1968 indicated a leap in performance. After debate within the US industry, PPPL converted the Model C stellarator to the Symmetrical Tokamak (ST) as a way to confirm or deny these results. ST confirmed them, and large-scale work on the stellarator concept ended in the US replaced by tokamaks. Research continued in Germany and Japan, where several new designs were built.

The tokamak ultimately proved to have problems similar to the stellarators, but for different reasons. Since the 1990s, the stellarator design has seen renewed interest. New methods of construction have increased the quality and power of the magnetic fields, improving performance. A number of new devices have been built to test these concepts. 

== History ==
=== Previous work ===
In 1934, Mark Oliphant, Paul Harteck and Ernest Rutherford were the first to achieve fusion on Earth, using a particle accelerator to shoot deuterium nuclei into a metal foil containing deuterium, lithium or other elements. These experiments allowed them to measure the nuclear cross section of various reactions of fusion between nuclei, and determined that the tritium–deuterium reaction occurred at a lower energy than any other fuel, peaking at about 100,000 electronvolts (100 keV).

100 keV corresponds to a temperature of about a billion kelvins. Due to the Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics, a bulk gas at a much lower temperature will still contain some particles at these much higher energies. Because the fusion reactions release so much energy, even a small number of these reactions can release enough energy to keep the gas at the required temperature. In 1944, Enrico Fermi demonstrated that this would occur at a bulk temperature of about 50 million Celsius, still very hot but within the range of existing experimental systems. The key problem was &quot;confining&quot; such a plasma; no material container could withstand those temperatures. But because plasmas are electrically conductive, they are subject to electric and magnetic fields which provide a number of solutions.

In a magnetic field, the electrons and nuclei of the plasma circle the magnetic lines of force. One way to provide some confinement would be to place a tube of fuel inside the open core of a solenoid. A solenoid creates magnetic lines running down its center, and fuel would be held away from the walls by orbiting these lines of force. But such an arrangement does not confine the plasma along the length of the tube. The obvious solution is to bend the tube around into a torus (donut) shape, so that any one line forms a circle, and the particles can circle forever.

However, this solution does not actually work. For purely geometric reasons, the magnets ringing the torus are closer together on the inside curve, inside the &quot;donut hole&quot;. Fermi noted this would cause the electrons to drift away from the nuclei, eventually causing them to separate and cause large voltages to develop. The resulting electric field would cause the plasma ring inside the torus to expand until it hit the walls of the reactor.

=== Stellarator ===
After World War II, a number of researchers began considering different ways to confine a plasma. George Paget Thomson of Imperial College London proposed a system now known as z-pinch, which runs a current through the plasma. Due to the Lorentz force, this current creates a magnetic field that pulls the plasma in on itself, keeping it away from the walls of the reactor. This eliminates the need for magnets on the outside, avoiding the problem Fermi noted. Various teams in the UK had built a number of small experimental devices using this technique by the late 1940s.

Another person working on controlled fusion reactors was Ronald Richter, a German scientist who moved to Argentina after the war. His &quot;thermotron&quot; used a system of electrical arcs and mechanical compression (sound waves) for heating and confinement. He convinced Juan Perón to fund development of an experimental reactor on an isolated island near the Chilean border. Known as the Huemul Project, this was completed in 1951. Richter soon convinced himself fusion had been achieved in spite of other people working on the project disagreeing. The &quot;success&quot; was announced by Perón on 24 March 1951, becoming the topic of newspaper stories around the world.

While preparing for a ski trip to Aspen, Lyman Spitzer received a telephone call from his father, who mentioned an article on Huemul in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Looking over the description in the article, Spitzer concluded it could not possibly work; the system simply could not provide enough energy to heat the fuel to fusion temperatures. But the idea stuck with him, and he began considering systems that would work. While riding the ski lift, he hit upon the stellarator concept.

The basic concept was a way to modify the torus layout so that it addressed Fermi&#x27;s concerns through the device&#x27;s geometry. By twisting one end of the torus compared to the other, forming a figure-8 layout instead of a circle, the magnetic lines no longer travelled around the tube at a constant radius, instead they moved closer and further from the torus&#x27; center. A particle orbiting these lines would find itself constantly moving in and out across the minor axis of the torus. The drift upward while it travelled through one section of the reactor would be reversed after half an orbit and it would drift downward again. The cancellation was not perfect, but it appeared this would so greatly reduce the net drift rates that the fuel would remain trapped long enough to heat it to the required temperatures.

His 1958 description was simple and direct:
=== Matterhorn ===
While working at Los Alamos in 1950, John Wheeler suggested setting up a secret research lab at Princeton University that would carry on theoretical work on H-bombs after he returned to the university in 1951. Spitzer was invited to join this program, given his previous research in interstellar plasmas.

But by the time of his trip to Aspen, Spitzer had lost interest in bomb design, and upon his return, he turned his attention full-time to fusion as a power source. Over the next few months, Spitzer produced a series of reports outlining the conceptual basis for the stellarator, as well as potential problems. The series is notable for its depth; it not only included a detailed analysis of the mathematics of the plasma and stability but also outlined a number of additional problems like heating the plasma and dealing with impurities.

With this work in hand, Spitzer began to lobby the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) for funding to develop the system. He outlined a plan involving three stages. The first would see the construction of a Model A, whose purpose was to demonstrate that a plasma could be created and that its confinement time was better than a torus. If the A model was successful, the B model would attempt to heat the plasma to fusion temperatures. This would be followed by a C model, which would attempt to actually create fusion reactions at a large scale. This entire series was expected to take about a decade.

Around the same time, Jim Tuck had been introduced to the pinch concept while working at Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford University. He was offered a job in the US and eventually ended up at Los Alamos, where he acquainted the other researchers with the concept. When he heard Spitzer was promoting the stellarator, he also travelled to Washington to propose building a pinch device. He considered Spitzer&#x27;s plans &quot;incredibly ambitious&quot;. Nevertheless, Spitzer was successful in gaining $50,000 in funding from the AEC, while Tuck received nothing.

The Princeton program was officially created on 1 July 1951. Spitzer, an avid mountain climber, proposed the name &quot;Project Matterhorn&quot; because he felt that &quot;the work at hand seemed difficult, like the ascent of a mountain&quot;. Two sections were initially set up, S Section working on the stellarator under Spitzer, and B Section working on bomb design under Wheeler. Matterhorn was set up at Princeton&#x27;s new Forrestal Campus, a plot of land the University purchased from the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research when Rockefeller relocated to Manhattan. The land was located about from the main Princeton campus and already had sixteen laboratory buildings. Spitzer set up the top-secret S Section in a former rabbit hutch.

It was not long before the other labs began agitating for their own funding. Tuck had managed to arrange some funding for his Perhapsatron through some discretionary budgets at LANL, but other teams at LANL, Berkeley and Oak Ridge (ORNL) also presented their ideas. The AEC eventually organized a new department for all of these projects, becoming &quot;Project Sherwood&quot;.

=== Early devices ===
With the funding from the AEC, Spitzer began work by inviting James Van Allen to join the group and set up an experimental program. Allen suggested starting with a small &quot;tabletop&quot; device. This led to the Model A design, which began construction in 1952. It was made from pyrex tubes about in total length, and magnets capable of about 1,000 gauss. The machine began operations in early 1953 and clearly demonstrated improved confinement over the simple torus.

This led to the construction of the Model B, which had the problem that the magnets were not well mounted and tended to move around when they were powered to their maximum capacity of 50,000 gauss. A second design also failed for the same reason, but this machine demonstrated several-hundred-kilovolt X-rays that suggested good confinement. The lessons from these two designs led to the B-1, which used ohmic heating (see below) to reach plasma temperatures around 100,000 degrees. This machine demonstrated that impurities in the plasma caused large x-ray emissions that rapidly cooled the plasma. In 1956, B-1 was rebuilt with an ultra-high vacuum system to reduce the impurities but found that even at smaller quantities they were still a serious problem. Another effect noticed in the B-1 was that during the heating process, the particles would remain confined for only a few tenths of a millisecond, while once the field was turned off, any remaining particles were confined for as long as 10 milliseconds. This appeared to be due to &quot;cooperative effects&quot; within the plasma.

Meanwhile, a second machine known as B-2 was being built. This was similar to the B-1 machine but used pulsed power to allow it to reach higher magnetic energy and included a second heating system known as magnetic pumping. This machine was also modified to add an ultra-high vacuum system. Unfortunately, B-2 demonstrated little heating from the magnetic pumping, which was not entirely unexpected because this mechanism required longer confinement times, and this was not being achieved. As it appeared that little could be learned from this system in its current form, in 1958 it was sent to the Atoms for Peace show in Geneva. However, when the heating system was modified, the coupling increased dramatically, demonstrating temperatures within the heating section as high as .

Two additional machines were built to study pulsed operation. B-64 was completed in 1955, essentially a larger version of the B-1 machine but powered by pulses of current that produced up to 15,000 gauss. This machine included a divertor, which removed impurities from the plasma, greatly reducing the x-ray cooling effect seen on earlier machines. B-64 included straight sections in the curved ends which gave it a squared-off appearance. This appearance led to its name, it was a &quot;figure-8, squared&quot;, or 8 squared, or 64. This led to experiments in 1956 where the machine was re-assembled without the twist in the tubes, allowing the particles to travel without rotation.

B-65, completed in 1957, was built using the new &quot;racetrack&quot; layout. This was the result of the observation that adding helical coils to the curved portions of the device produced a field that introduced the rotation purely through the resulting magnetic fields. This had the added advantage that the magnetic field included &quot;shear&quot;, which was known to improve stability. B-3, also completed in 1957, was a greatly enlarged B-2 machine with ultra-high vacuum and pulsed confinement up to 50,000 gauss and projected confinement times as long as 0.01 second. The last of the B-series machines was the B-66, completed in 1958, which was essentially a combination of the racetrack layout from B-65 with the larger size and energy of the B-3.

Unfortunately, all of these larger machines demonstrated a problem that came to be known as &quot;pump out&quot;. This effect was causing plasma drift rates that were not only higher than classical theory suggested but also much higher than the Bohm rates. B-3&#x27;s drift rate was a full three times that of the worst-case Bohm predictions, and failed to maintain confinement for more than a few tens of microseconds.

=== Model C ===
As early as 1954, as research continued on the B-series machines, the design of the Model C device was becoming more defined. It emerged as a large racetrack-layout machine with multiple heating sources and a divertor, essentially an even larger B-66. Construction began in 1958 and was completed in 1961. It could be adjusted to allow a plasma minor axis between and was in length. The toroidal field coils normally operated at 35,000 gauss.

By the time Model C began operations, information collected from previous machines was making it clear that it would not be able to produce large-scale fusion. Ion transport across the magnetic field lines was much higher than classical theory suggested. Greatly increased magnetic fields of the later machines did little to address this, and confinement times simply were not improving. Attention began to turn to a much greater emphasis on the theoretical understanding of the plasma. In 1961, Melvin B. Gottlieb took over the Matterhorn Project from Spitzer, and on 1 February the project was renamed as the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL).

Continual modification and experimentation on the Model C slowly improved its operation, and the confinement times eventually increased to match that of Bohm predictions. New versions of the heating systems were used that slowly increased the temperatures. Notable among these was the 1964 addition of a small particle accelerator to accelerate fuel ions to high enough energy to cross the magnetic fields, depositing energy within the reactor when they collided with other ions already inside. This method of heating, now known as neutral beam injection, has since become almost universal on magnetic confinement fusion machines.

Model C spent most of its history involved in studies of ion transport. Through continual tuning of the magnetic system and the addition of the new heating methods, in 1969, Model C eventually reached electron temperatures of 400 eV.

=== Other approaches ===
Through this period, a number of new potential stellarator designs emerged, which featured a simplified magnetic layout. The Model C used separate confinement and helical coils, as this was an evolutionary process from the original design which had only the confinement coils. Other researchers, notably in Germany, noted that the same overall magnetic field configuration could be achieved with a much simpler arrangement. This led to the torsatron or heliotron layout.

In these designs, the primary field is produced by a single helical magnet, similar to one of the helical windings of the &quot;classical&quot; stellarator. In contrast to those systems, only a single magnet is needed, and it is much larger than those in the stellarators. To produce the net field, a second set of coils running poloidally around the outside of the helical magnet produces a second vertical field that mixes with the helical one. The result is a much simpler layout, as the poloidal magnets are generally much smaller and there is ample room between them to reach the interior, whereas in the original layout the toroidal confinement magnets are relatively large and leave little room between them.

A further update emerged from the realization that the total field could be produced through a series of independent magnets shaped like the local field. This results in a series of complex magnets that are arranged like the toroidal coils of the original layout. The advantage of this design is that the magnets are entirely independent; if one is damaged it can be individually replaced without affecting the rest of the system. Additionally, one can re-arrange the overall field layout by replacing the elements. These &quot;modular coils&quot; are now a major part of ongoing research.

=== Tokamak stampede ===
In 1968, scientists in the Soviet Union released the results of their tokamak machines, notably their newest example, T-3. The results were so startling that there was widespread scepticism. To address this, the Soviets invited a team of experts from the United Kingdom to test the machines for themselves. Their tests, made using a laser-based system developed for the ZETA reactor in England, verified the Soviet claims of electron temperatures of 1,000 eV. What followed was a &quot;veritable stampede&quot; of tokamak construction worldwide.

At first the US labs ignored the tokamak; Spitzer himself dismissed it out of hand as experimental error. However, as new results came in, especially the UK reports, Princeton found itself in the position of trying to defend the stellarator as a useful experimental machine while other groups from around the US were clamoring for funds to build tokamaks. In July 1969 Gottlieb had a change of heart, offering to convert the Model C to a tokamak layout. In December it was shut down and reopened in May as the Symmetric Tokamak (ST).

The ST immediately matched the performance being seen in the Soviet machines, besting the Model C&#x27;s results by over ten times. From that point, PPPL was the primary developer of the tokamak approach in the US, introducing a series of machines to test various designs and modifications. The Princeton Large Torus of 1975 quickly hit several performance numbers that were required for a commercial machine, and it was widely believed the critical threshold of breakeven would be reached in the early 1980s. What was needed was larger machines and more powerful systems to heat the plasma to fusion temperatures.

Tokamaks are a type of pinch machine, differing from earlier designs primarily in the amount of current in the plasma: above a certain threshold known as the &quot;safety factor&quot;, or &quot;q&quot;, the plasma is much more stable. ZETA ran at a &quot;q&quot; around , while experiments on tokamaks demonstrated it needs to be at least 1. Machines following this rule showed dramatically improved performance. However, by the mid-1980s the easy path to fusion disappeared; as the amount of current in the new machines began to increase, a new set of instabilities in the plasma appeared. These could be addressed, but only by greatly increasing the power of the magnetic fields, requiring superconducting magnets and huge confinement volumes. The cost of such a machine was such that the involved parties banded together to begin the ITER project.

=== Stellarator returns ===
As the problems with the tokamak approach grew, interest in the stellarator approach reemerged. This coincided with the development of advanced computer aided planning tools that allowed the construction of complex magnets that were previously known but considered too difficult to design and build.

New materials and construction methods have increased the quality and power of the magnetic fields, improving performance. New devices have been built to test these concepts. Major examples include Wendelstein 7-X in Germany, the Helically Symmetric Experiment (HSX) in the US, and the Large Helical Device in Japan. W7X and LHD use superconducting magnetic coils.
The lack of an internal current eliminates some of the instabilities of the tokamak, meaning the stellarator should be more stable at similar operating conditions. On the downside, since it lacks the confinement provided by the current found in a tokamak, the stellarator requires more powerful magnets to reach any given confinement. The stellarator is an inherently steady-state machine, which has several engineering advantages.

In 2023 PPPL built an experimental device using mainly commercial components at a cost of $640,000. Its core is a glass vacuum chamber surrounded by a 3D-printed nylon shell that anchors 9,920 permanent magnets. Sixteen electromagnets wrap the shell.

=== Private sector stellarators ===
As part of a renewed push for fusion power from around 2018, private sector stellarator projects have emerged and in number compete with, though are much less developed than, tokamak projects, such as Renaissance Fusion and Proxima Fusion, a Munich-based spin-off from the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, which steered the W7-X experiment.

== Underlying concepts ==
=== Requirements for fusion ===
Heating a gas increases the energy of the particles within it, so by heating a gas into hundreds of millions of degrees, the majority of the particles within it reach the energy required to fuse. According to the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, some of the particles will reach the required energies at much lower average temperatures. Because the energy released by the fusion reaction is much greater than what it takes to start it, even a small number of reactions can heat surrounding fuel until it fuses as well. In 1944, Enrico Fermi calculated the D–T reaction would be self-sustaining at about .

Materials heated beyond a few tens of thousand degrees ionize into their electrons and nuclei, producing a gas-like state of matter known as plasma. According to the ideal gas law, like any hot gas, plasma has an internal pressure and thus wants to expand. For a fusion reactor, the challenge is to keep the plasma contained. In a magnetic field, the electrons and nuclei orbit around the magnetic field lines, confining them to the area defined by the field.

=== Magnetic confinement ===
A simple confinement system can be made by placing a tube inside the open core of a solenoid. The tube can be evacuated and then filled with the requisite gas and heated until it becomes a plasma. The plasma naturally wants to expand outwards to the walls of the tube, as well as move along it, towards the ends. The solenoid creates magnetic field lines running down the center of the tube, and the plasma particles orbit these lines, preventing their motion towards the sides. Unfortunately, this arrangement would not confine the plasma along the &quot;length&quot; of the tube, and the plasma would be free to flow out the ends.

The obvious solution to this problem is to bend the tube around into a torus (a ring or donut) shape. Motion towards the sides remains constrained as before, and while the particles remain free to move along the lines, in this case, they will simply circulate around the long axis of the tube. But, as Fermi pointed out, when the solenoid is bent into a ring, the electrical windings would be closer together on the inside than the outside. This would lead to an uneven field across the tube, and the fuel will slowly drift out of the center. Since the electrons and ions would drift in opposite directions, this would lead to a charge separation and electrostatic forces that would eventually overwhelm the magnetic force. Some additional force needs to counteract this drift, providing long-term &quot;confinement&quot;.

=== Stellarator concept ===
Spitzer&#x27;s key concept in the stellarator design is that the drift that Fermi noted could be canceled out through the physical arrangement of the vacuum tube. In a torus, particles on the inside edge of the tube, where the field was stronger, would drift up, while those on the outside would drift down (or vice versa). However, if the particle were made to alternate between the inside and outside of the tube, the drifts would alternate between up and down and would cancel out. The cancellation is not perfect, leaving some net drift, but basic calculations suggested drift would be lowered enough to confine plasma long enough to heat it sufficiently.

Spitzer&#x27;s suggestion for doing this was simple. Instead of a normal torus, the device would essentially be cut in half to produce two half-tori. They would then be joined with two straight sections between the open ends. The key was that they were connected to alternate ends so that the right half of one of the tori was connected to the left of the other. The resulting design resembled a figure-8 when viewed from above. Because the straight tubes could not pass through each other, the design did not lie flat, the tori at either end had to be tilted. This meant the drift cancellation was further reduced, but again, calculations suggested the system would work.

To understand how the system works to counteract drift, consider the path of a single particle in the system starting in one of the straight sections. If that particle is perfectly centered in the tube, it will travel down the center into one of the half-tori, exit into the center of the next tube, and so on. This particle will complete a loop around the entire reactor without leaving the center. Now consider another particle traveling parallel to the first, but initially located near the inside wall of the tube. In this case, it will enter the &quot;outside&quot; edge of the half-torus and begin to drift down. It exits that section and enters the second straight section, still on the outside edge of that tube. However, because the tubes are crossed, when it reaches the second half-torus it enters it on the &quot;inside&quot; edge. As it travels through this section it drifts back up.

This effect would reduce one of the primary causes of drift in the machine, but there were others to consider as well. Although the ions and electrons in the plasma would both circle the magnetic lines, they would do so in opposite directions, and at very high rotational speeds. This leads to the possibility of collisions between particles circling different lines of force as they circulate through the reactor, which due to purely geometric reasons, causes the fuel to slowly drift outward. This process eventually causes the fuel to either collide with the structure or cause a large charge separation between the ions and electrons. Spitzer introduced the concept of a &quot;divertor&quot;, a magnet placed around the tube that pulled off the very outer layer of the plasma. This would remove the ions before they drifted too far and hit the walls. It would also remove any heavier elements in the plasma.

Using classical calculations the rate of diffusion through collisions was low enough that it would be much lower than the drift due to uneven fields in a normal toroid. But earlier studies of magnetically confined plasmas in 1949 demonstrated much higher losses and became known as Bohm diffusion. Spitzer spent considerable effort considering this issue and concluded that the anomalous rate being seen by Bohm was due to instability in the plasma, which he believed could be addressed.

=== Alternative designs ===
One of the major concerns for the original stellarator concept is that the magnetic fields in the system will only properly confine a particle of a given mass traveling at a given speed. Particles traveling faster or slower will not circulate in the desired fashion. Particles with very low speeds (corresponding to low temperatures) are not confined and can drift out to the tube walls. Those with too much energy may hit the outside walls of the curved sections. To address these concerns, Spitzer introduced the concept of a &quot;divertor&quot; that would connect to one of the straight sections. This was essentially a mass spectrometer that would remove particles that were moving too fast or too slow for proper confinement.

The physical limitation that the two straight sections cannot intersect means that the rotational transform within the loop is not a perfect 180 degrees, but typically closer to 135 degrees. This led to alternate designs in an effort to get the angle closer to 180. An early attempt was built into the Stellarator B-2, which placed both curved sections flat in relation to the ground, but at different heights. The formerly straight sections had additional curves inserted, two sections of about 45 degrees, so they now formed extended S-shapes. This allowed them to route around each other while being perfectly symmetrical in terms of angles.

A better solution to the need to rotate the particles was introduced in the Stellarator B-64 and B-65. These eliminated the cross-over and flattened the device into an oval, or as they referred to it, a racetrack. The rotation of the particles was introduced by placing a new set of magnetic coils on the half-torus on either end, the &quot;corkscrew windings&quot;. The field from these coils mixes with the original confinement fields to produce a mixed field that rotates the lines of force through 180 degrees. This made the mechanical design of the reactor much simpler, but in practice, it was found that the mixed field was very difficult to produce in a perfectly symmetrical fashion.

Modern stellarator designs generally use a more complex series of magnets to produce a single shaped field. This generally looks like a twisted ribbon. Differences between the designs generally come down to how the magnets are arranged to produce the field, and the exact arrangement of the resulting field. A wide variety of layouts have been designed and some of these have been tested.

=== Heating ===
Unlike the z-pinch or tokamak, the stellarator has no induced electrical current within the plasma – at a macroscopic level, the plasma is neutral and unmoving, in spite of the individual particles within it rapidly circulating. In pinch machines, the current itself is one of the primary methods of heating the plasma. In the stellarator, no such natural heating source is present.

Early stellarator designs used a system similar to those in the pinch devices to provide the initial heating to bring the gas to plasma temperatures. This consisted of a single set of windings from a transformer, with the plasma itself forming the secondary set. When energized with a pulse of current, the particles in the region are rapidly energized and begin to move. This brings additional gas into the region, quickly ionizing the entire mass of gas. This concept was referred to as &quot;ohmic heating&quot; because it relied on the resistance of the gas to create heat, in a fashion not unlike a conventional resistance heater. As the temperature of the gas increases, the conductivity of the plasma improves. This makes the ohmic heating process less and less effective, and this system is limited to temperatures of about 1 million kelvins.

To heat the plasma to higher temperatures, Spitzer proposed a second heat source, the &quot;magnetic pumping&quot; system. This consisted of radio-frequency source fed through a coil spread along the vacuum chamber. The frequency is chosen to be similar to the natural frequency of the particles around the magnetic lines of force, the &quot;cyclotron frequency&quot;. This causes the particles in the area to gain energy, which causes them to orbit in a wider radius. Since other particles are orbiting their own lines nearby, at a macroscopic level, this change in energy appears as an increase in pressure. According to the ideal gas law, this results in an increase in temperature. Like ohmic heating, this process also becomes less efficient as the temperature increases, but is still capable of creating very high temperatures. When the frequency is deliberately set close to that of the ion circulation, this is known as &quot;ion-cyclotron resonance heating&quot;, although this term was not widely used at the time.

=== Inherent problems ===
Work on the then-new tokamak concept in the early 1970s, notably by Tihiro Ohkawa at General Atomics, suggested that toroids with smaller &quot;aspect ratios&quot; and non-circular plasmas would have much-improved performance. The aspect ratio is the comparison of the radius of the device as a whole to the radius of the cross-section of the vacuum tube. An ideal reactor would have no hole in the center, minimizing the aspect ratio. The modern spherical tokamak takes this to its practical limit, reducing the center hole to a single metal post, elongating the cross-section of the tubing vertically, producing an overall shape that is nearly spherical and has a ratio less than 2. The MAST device in the UK, among the most powerful of these designs, has a ratio of 1.3.

Stellarators generally require complex magnets to generate the desired field. In early examples, this was often in the form of several different sets of magnets stacked. While modern designs combine these together, the resulting designs often require significant room around them. This limits the size of the inner radius to something much larger than seen in modern tokamaks, so they have relatively large aspect ratios. For instance, W7-X has an aspect ratio of 10, which leads to a very large overall size. There are some new layouts that aim to reduce the aspect ratio, but these remain untested and the reduction is still nowhere near the level seen in modern tokamaks.

In a production design, the magnets would need to be protected from the 14.1 MeV neutrons being produced by the fusion reactions. This is normally accomplished through the use of a breeding blanket, a layer of material containing large amounts of lithium. In order to capture most of the neutrons, the blanket has to be about 1 to 1.5 meters thick, which moves the magnets away from the plasma and therefore requires them to be more powerful than those on experimental machines where they line the outside of the vacuum chamber directly. This is normally addressed by scaling the machine up to extremely large sizes, such that the ~10 centimetre separation found in smaller machines is linearly scaled to about 1 meter. This has the effect of making the machine much larger, growing to impractical sizes. Designs with smaller aspect ratios, which scale more rapidly, would address this effect to some degree, but designs of such systems, like ARIES-CS, are enormous, about 8 meters in radius with a relatively high aspect ratio of about 4.6.

The stellarator&#x27;s complex magnets combine together to produce the desired field shape. This demands extremely tight positioning tolerances which drive up construction costs. It was this problem that led to the cancellation of the US&#x27;s National Compact Stellarator Experiment, or NCSX, which was an experimental low-aspect design with a ratio of 4.4. To work properly, the maximum deviation in placement across the entire machine was . As it was assembled this was found to be impossible to achieve, even the natural sagging of the components over time was more than the allowed limit. Construction was cancelled in 2008, throwing the future of the PPPL into doubt.

Finally, stellarator designs are expected to leak around 5% of the generated alpha particles, increasing stress on the plasma-facing components of a reactor.

== Plasma heating ==
There are several ways to heat the plasma (which must be done before ignition can occur).

; Current heating : The plasma is electrically conductive, and heats up when a current is passed through it (due to electrical resistance). Only used for initial heating, as the resistance is inversely proportional to the plasma temperature.
; High-frequency electromagnetic waves : The plasma absorbs energy when electromagnetic waves are applied to it (in the same manner as food in a microwave).
; Heating by neutral particles : A neutral particle beam injector makes ions and accelerates them with an electric field. To avoid being affected by the Stellarator&#x27;s magnetic field, the ions must be neutralised. Neutralised ions are then injected into the plasma. Their high kinetic energy is transferred to the plasma particles by collisions, heating them.

== Configurations ==

Several different configurations of stellarator exist, including:
; Spatial stellarator : The Princeton Model A stellarator is based on the 1953&#x27;s figure-eight design. It achieved a rotational transform using torsion of the magnetic axis. This is a helix configuration.
; Classical stellarator : Also known as Princeton Model C, this stellarator generates a magnetic field by connecting the plasma poloidally and toroidally through helical coils. Stellarators with this helitron configuration were only operational until the late 1960s due to issues with particle confinement.

; Torsatron : A torsatron is a type of stellarator that uses external, continuously wound helical coils to generate the magnetic field. The helical coils that wrap around the torus simplifies the coils structure, which can potentially improve the stability of the plasma. An example of a torsatron is the Compact Toroidal Hybrid (CTH).
; Heliotron : The heliotron is a stellarator designed in Japan that uses a helical coil is used to confine the plasma and a pair of poloidal field coils to generate a vertical field. Helical and toroidal coils work together to generate the magnetic field. Its simplified coil structure makes manufacturing easier, while its modular coil system offers more flexibility in manipulating the magnetic field. The Large Helical Device in Japan is an example of this configuration.
; Modular stellarator : A stellarator with a set of modular (separated) coils and a twisted toroidal coil. e.g. Helically Symmetric Experiment (HSX) (and Helias (below))

; Heliac : A &quot;helical axis stellarator&quot;, in which the magnetic axis (and plasma) follows a helical path to form a toroidal helix rather than a simple ring shape. The twisted plasma induces twist in the magnetic field lines to effect drift cancellation, and typically can provide more twist than the Torsatron or Heliotron, especially near the centre of the plasma (magnetic axis). The original Heliac consists only of circular coils, and the flexible heliac (H-1NF, TJ-II, TU-Heliac) adds a small helical coil to allow the twist to be varied by a factor of up to 2.
; Helias : A &quot;helical advanced stellarator&quot;, using an optimized modular coil set designed to simultaneously achieve high plasma, low Pfirsch–Schluter currents and good confinement of energetic particles; i.e., alpha particles for reactor scenarios. The Helias has been proposed to be the most promising stellarator concept for a power plant, with a modular engineering design and optimised plasma, MHD and magnetic field properties. The Wendelstein 7-X device is based on a five field-period Helias configuration.

=== Optimization to reduce transport losses ===
The goal of magnetic confinement devices is to minimise energy transport across a magnetic field. Toroidal devices are relatively successful because the magnetic properties seen by the particles are averaged as they travel around the torus. The strength of the field seen by a particle, however, generally varies, so that some particles will be trapped by the mirror effect. These particles will not be able to average the magnetic properties so effectively, which will result in increased energy transport. In most stellarators, these changes in field strength are greater than in tokamaks, which is a major reason that transport in stellarators tends to be higher than in tokamaks.

University of Wisconsin electrical engineering Professor David Anderson and research assistant John Canik proved in 2007 that the Helically Symmetric eXperiment (HSX) can overcome this major barrier in plasma research. The HSX is the first stellarator to use a quasisymmetric magnetic field. The team designed and built the HSX with the prediction that quasisymmetry would reduce energy transport. As the team&#x27;s latest research showed, that is exactly what it does. &quot;This is the first demonstration that quasisymmetry works, and you can actually measure the reduction in transport that you get&quot;, said Canik.

The newer Wendelstein 7-X in Germany was designed to be close to omnigeneity (a property of the magnetic field such that the mean radial drift is zero), which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for quasisymmetry; that is, all quasisymmetric magnetic fields are omnigenous, but not all omnigenous magnetic fields are quasisymmetric. Experiments at the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator have revealed turbulence-induced anomalous diffusion. The optimized magnetic field of W7-X showed effective control of bootstrap current and reduced neoclassical energy transport, enabling high-temperature plasma conditions and record fusion values but also longer impurity confinement times during turbulence-suppressed phases. These findings highlight the success of magnetic field optimization in stellarators.

=== Proof of divertor concepts ===

At Wendelstein 7-X, the island divertor has been successful in stabilizing detached plasma scenarios and reducing the heat fluxes on divertor targets. This topology has multiple adjacent counter-streaming flow regions that can reduce the flow speed parallel to magnetic field lines, leading to substantial heat flux mitigation. Radiative power exhaust by impurity seeding has been demonstrated in island divertor configurations, resulting in stable plasma operation and reduced divertor heat loads. This makes the island divertor a promising solution for future detachment control in high-performance scenarios and upgrades towards a metal divertor. The edge magnetic structure in quasi-omnigenous and helically symmetric stellarators, like W7-X and HSX, has a significant impact on particle fueling and exhaust. It has been shown that the magnetic island chain can be used to control plasma fueling from the recycling source and active gas injection.

=== MUSE ===
The MUSE device at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory uses primarily off-the-shelf parts such as 10000 permanent magnets to build a stellarator for use in research. The magnets are embedded in a 3D printed nylon matrix. It adopted the magnetic surface charge method. Peak internal stress was found to be less than 7 MPa. It is the first quasi-axisymmetric experiment.

<text>SYSTRAN, founded by Dr. Peter Toma in 1968, is one of the oldest machine translation companies. SYSTRAN has done extensive work for the United States Department of Defense and the European Commission.

SYSTRAN provided the technology for Yahoo! Babel Fish until May 30, 2012, among others. It was used by Google&#x27;s language tools until 2007. SYSTRAN is used by the Dashboard Translation widget in macOS.

Commercial versions of SYSTRAN can run on Microsoft Windows (including Windows Mobile), Linux, and Solaris. Historically, SYSTRAN systems used rule-based machine translation (RbMT) technology. With the release of SYSTRAN Server 7 in 2010, SYSTRAN implemented a hybrid rule-based/statistical machine translation (SMT) technology which was the first of its kind in the marketplace.

, the company had 59 employees of whom 26 are computational experts and 15 computational linguists. The number of employees decreased from 70 in 2006 to 59 in 2008.

==History==
With its origin in the Georgetown machine translation effort, SYSTRAN was one of the few machine translation systems to survive the major decrease of funding after the ALPAC Report of the mid-1960s. The company was established in La Jolla in California to work on translation of Russian to English text for the United States Air Force during the Cold War. Large numbers of Russian scientific and technical documents were translated using SYSTRAN under the auspices of the USAF Foreign Technology Division (later the National Air and Space Intelligence Center) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. The quality of the translations, although only approximate, was usually adequate for understanding content.

The company headquarters is in Paris, while its U.S. headquarters is in San Diego, CA.

During the dot-com boom, the international language industry started a new era, and SYSTRAN entered into agreements with a number of translation integrators, the most successful of these being WorldLingo.

In 2016, the Harvard NLP group and SYSTRAN founded OpenNMT, an open source ecosystem for neural machine translation and neural sequence learning. This has enabled machine translation software with learning capabilities, dramatically increasing MT translation quality. The project has since been used in several research and industry applications, and its open source ecosystem is currently maintained by SYSTRAN and Ubiqus.

== Business situation ==
Most of SYSTRAN&#x27;s revenue comes from a few customers. 57.1% comes from the 10 main customers and the three largest customers account for 10.9%, 8.9%, and 8.9% of its revenues, respectively. Revenues had been declining in the early 2000s: 10.2 million euros in 2004, 10.1 million euros in 2005, 9.3 million euros in 2006, 8.8 million euros in 2007, and 7.6 million euros in 2008, before seeing a rebound in 2009 with 8.6 million euros.

<text>Stephen I, also known as King Saint Stephen ( ; ; ; 975 – 15 August 1038), was the last grand prince of the Hungarians between 997 and 1000 or 1001, and the first king of Hungary from 1000 or 1001 until his death in 1038. The year of his birth is uncertain, but many details of his life suggest that he was born in, or after, 975, in Esztergom. He was given the pagan name Vajk at birth, but the date of his baptism is unknown. He was the only son of Grand Prince Géza and his wife, Sarolt, who was descended from a prominent family of &quot;gyulas&quot;. Although both of his parents were baptized, Stephen was the first member of his family to become a devout Christian. He married Gisela of Bavaria, a scion of the imperial Ottonian dynasty.

After succeeding his father in 997, Stephen had to fight for the throne against his relative, Koppány, who was supported by large numbers of pagan warriors. He defeated Koppány with the assistance of foreign knights including Vecelin, Hont and Pázmány, and native lords. He was crowned on 25 December 1000 or 1 January 1001 with a crown sent by Pope Sylvester II. In a series of wars against semi-independent tribes and chieftainsincluding the Black Hungarians and his uncle, Gyula the Youngerhe unified the Carpathian Basin. He protected the independence of his kingdom by forcing the invading troops of Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor, to withdraw from Hungary in 1030.

Stephen established at least one archbishopric, six bishoprics and three Benedictine monasteries, leading the Church in Hungary to develop independently from the archbishops of the Holy Roman Empire. He encouraged the spread of Christianity by meting out severe punishments for ignoring Christian customs. His system of local administration was based on counties organized around fortresses and administered by royal officials. Hungary enjoyed a lasting period of peace during his reign and became a preferred route for pilgrims and merchants traveling between Western Europe, the Holy Land and Constantinople.

Stephen survived all of his children, dying on 15 August 1038, aged 62 or 63. He was buried in his new basilica, built in Székesfehérvár and dedicated to the Holy Virgin. His death was followed by civil wars which lasted for decades. He was canonized by Pope Gregory VII, together with his son Emeric and Bishop Gerard of Csanád, in 1083. Stephen is a popular saint in Hungary and neighboring territories. In Hungary, his feast day (celebrated on 20 August) is also a public holiday commemorating the foundation of the state, known as State Foundation Day.

== Early years ( 975–997) ==

Stephen&#x27;s birth date is uncertain as it was not recorded in contemporaneous documents. Hungarian and Polish chronicles written centuries later give three different years: 967, 969 and 975. The unanimous testimony of his three late 11th-century or early 12th-century hagiographies and other Hungarian sources, which state that Stephen was &quot;still an adolescent&quot; in 997, substantiate the reliability of the latest year (975). Stephen&#x27;s &quot;Lesser Legend&quot; adds that he was born in Esztergom, which implies that he was born after 972 because his father, Géza, Grand Prince of the Hungarians, chose Esztergom as royal residence around that year. Géza promoted the spread of Christianity among his subjects by force, but never ceased worshipping pagan gods. Both his son&#x27;s &quot;Greater Legend&quot; and the nearly contemporaneous Thietmar of Merseburg described Géza as a cruel monarch, suggesting that he was a despot who mercilessly consolidated his authority over the rebellious Hungarian lords.

Hungarian chronicles agree that Stephen&#x27;s mother was Sarolt, daughter of Gyula, a Hungarian chieftain with jurisdiction either in Transylvania or in the wider region of the confluence of the rivers Tisza and Maros. Many historiansincluding Pál Engel and Gyula Kristópropose that her father was identical with &quot;Gylas&quot;, who had been baptized in Constantinople around 952 and &quot;remained faithful to Christianity&quot;, according to Byzantine chronicler John Skylitzes. However, this identification is not unanimously accepted; historian György Györffy states that it was not Sarolt&#x27;s father, but his younger brother, who was baptized in the Byzantine capital. In contrast with all Hungarian sources, the &quot;Polish-Hungarian Chronicle&quot; and later Polish sources state that Stephen&#x27;s mother was Adelhaid, an otherwise unknown sister of Duke Mieszko I of Poland, but the reliability of this report is not accepted by modern historians.

Stephen was born as Vajk, a name derived from the Turkic word &quot;baj&quot;, meaning &quot;hero&quot;, &quot;master&quot;, &quot;prince&quot; or &quot;rich&quot;. Stephen&#x27;s &quot;Greater Legend&quot; narrates that he was baptized by the saintly Bishop Adalbert of Prague, who stayed in Géza&#x27;s court several times between 983 and 994. However, Saint Adalbert&#x27;s nearly contemporaneous &quot;Legend&quot;, written by Bruno of Querfurt, does not mention this event. Accordingly, the date of Stephen&#x27;s baptism is unknown: Györffy argues that he was baptized soon after birth, while Kristó proposes that he only received baptism just before his father&#x27;s death in 997.

Stephen&#x27;s official hagiography, written by Bishop Hartvic and sanctioned by Pope Innocent III, narrates that he &quot;was fully instructed in the knowledge of the grammatical art&quot; in his childhood. This implies that he studied Latin, though some scepticism is warranted as few kings of this era were able to write. His two other late 11th-century hagiographies do not mention any grammatical studies, stating only that he &quot;was brought up by receiving an education appropriate for a little prince&quot;. Kristó says that the latter remark only refers to Stephen&#x27;s physical training, including his participation in hunts and military actions. According to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;, one of his tutors was a Count Deodatus from Italy, who later founded a monastery in Tata.

According to Stephen&#x27;s legends, Grand Prince Géza convoked an assembly of the Hungarian chieftains and warriors when Stephen &quot;ascended to the first stage of adolescence&quot;, at the age of 14 or 15. Géza nominated Stephen as his successor and all those present took an oath of loyalty to the young prince. Györffy writes, without identifying his source, that Géza appointed his son to rule the &quot;Nyitra ducate&quot; around that time. Slovak historians, including Ján Steinhübel and Ján Lukačka, accept Györffy&#x27;s view and propose that Stephen administered Nyitra (now Nitra, Slovakia) from around 995.

Géza arranged Stephen&#x27;s marriage to Gisela, daughter of Henry II, Duke of Bavaria, in or after 995. This marriage established the first family link between a Hungarian ruler and a Western European ruling house, as Gisela was closely related to the Ottonian dynasty of Holy Roman Emperors. According to popular tradition preserved in the Scheyern Abbey in Bavaria, the ceremony took place at the Scheyern castle and was celebrated by Saint Adalbert. Gisela was accompanied to her new home by Bavarian knights, many of whom received land grants from her husband and settled in Hungary, helping to strengthen Stephen&#x27;s military position. According to Györffy, Stephen and his wife &quot;presumably&quot; settled in Nyitra after their marriage.

== Reign (997–1038) ==

=== Grand Prince (997–1000) ===

Grand Prince Géza died in 997. Stephen convoked an assembly at Esztergom where his supporters declared him grand prince. Initially, he only controlled the northwestern regions of the Carpathian Basin; the rest of the territory was still dominated by tribal chieftains. Stephen&#x27;s ascension to the throne was in line with the principle of primogeniture, which prescribed that a father was succeeded by his son. On the other hand, it contradicted the traditional idea of seniority, according to which Géza should have been succeeded by the most senior member of the Árpád dynasty, which was Koppány at that time. Koppány, who held the title Duke of Somogy, had for many years administered the regions of Transdanubia south of Lake Balaton.

Koppány proposed to Géza&#x27;s widow, Sarolt, in accordance with the pagan custom of levirate marriage. He also announced his claim to the throne. Although it is not impossible that Koppány had already been baptized, in 972, most of his supporters were pagans, opponents of the Christianity represented by Stephen and his predominantly German retinue. A charter of 1002 for the Pannonhalma Archabbey writes of a war between &quot;the Germans and the Hungarians&quot; when referring to the armed conflicts between Stephen and Koppány. Even so, Györffy says that &quot;Oszlar&quot; (&quot;Alan&quot;), &quot;Besenyő&quot; (&quot;Pecheneg&quot;), &quot;Kér&quot; and other place names, referring to ethnic groups or Hungarian tribes in Transdanubia around the supposed borders of Koppány&#x27;s duchy, suggest that significant auxiliary units and groups of Hungarian warriorswho had been settled there by Grand Prince Gézafought in Stephen&#x27;s army.

Kristó states that the entire conflict between Stephen and Koppány was only a feud between two members of the Árpád dynasty, with no effect on other Hungarian tribal leaders. Koppány and his troops invaded the northern regions of Transdanubia, took many of Stephen&#x27;s forts and plundered his lands. Stephen, who, according to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;, &quot;was for the first time girded with his sword&quot;, placed the brothers Hont and Pázmány at the head of his own guard and nominated Vecelin to lead the royal army. The last was a German knight who had come to Hungary in the reign of Géza. Hont and Pázmány were, according to Simon of Kéza&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum&quot; and the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;, &quot;knights of Swabian origin&quot; who settled in Hungary either under Géza or in the first years of Stephen&#x27;s reign. On the other hand, Lukačka and other Slovak historians say that Hont and Pázmány were &quot;Slovak&quot; noblemen who had joined Stephen during his rule in Nyitra.

Koppány was besieging Veszprém when he was informed of the arrival of Stephen&#x27;s army. In the ensuing battle, Stephen won a decisive victory over his enemies. Koppány was killed on the battlefield. His body was quartered and its parts were displayed at the gates of the forts of Esztergom, Győr, Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia, Romania) and Veszprém in order to threaten all of those who were conspiring against the young monarch.

Stephen occupied Koppány&#x27;s duchy and granted large estates to his own partisans. He also prescribed that Koppány&#x27;s former subjects were to pay tithes to the Pannonhalma Archabbey, according to the deed of the foundation of this monastery which has been preserved in a manuscript containing interpolations. The same document declares that &quot;there were no other bishoprics and monasteries in Hungary&quot; at that time. On the other hand, the nearly contemporary Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg stated that Stephen &quot;established bishoprics in his kingdom&quot; before being crowned king. If the latter report is valid, the dioceses of Veszprém and Győr are the most probable candidates, according to historian Gábor Thoroczkay.

=== Coronation (1000–1001) ===
By ordering the display of one part of Koppány&#x27;s quartered corpse in Gyulafehérvár, the seat of his maternal uncle, Gyula the Younger, Stephen asserted his claim to rule all lands dominated by Hungarian lords. He also decided to strengthen his international status by adopting the title of king. However, the exact circumstances of his coronation and its political consequences are subject to scholarly debate.

Thietmar of Merseburg writes that Stephen received the crown &quot;with the favour and urging&quot; of Emperor Otto III (r. 996–1002), implying that Stephen accepted the Emperor&#x27;s suzerainty before his coronation. On the other hand, all of Stephen&#x27;s legends emphasize that he received his crown from Pope Sylvester II (r. 999–1003). Kristó and other historians point out that Pope Sylvester and Emperor Otto were close allies, which implies that both reports are valid: Stephen &quot;received the crown and consecration&quot; from the Pope, but not without the Emperor&#x27;s consent. Around 75 years after the coronation, Pope Gregory VII (r. 1075–1085), who claimed suzerainty over Hungary, declared that Stephen had &quot;offered and devotedly surrendered&quot; Hungary &quot;to Saint Peter&quot; (that is, to the Holy See). In a contrasting report, Stephen&#x27;s &quot;Greater Legend&quot; states that the King offered Hungary to the Virgin Mary. Modern historiansincluding Pál Engel, and Miklós Molnárwrite that Stephen always asserted his sovereignty and never accepted papal or imperial suzerainty. For instance, none of his charters were dated according to the years of the reign of the contemporary emperors, which would have been the case if he had been their vassal. Furthermore, Stephen declared in the preamble to his &quot;First Book of Laws&quot; that he governed his realm &quot;by the will of God&quot;.

The exact date of Stephen&#x27;s coronation is unknown. According to later Hungarian tradition, he was crowned on the first day of the second millennium, which may refer either to 25 December 1000 or to 1 January 1001. Details of Stephen&#x27;s coronation preserved in his &quot;Greater Legend&quot; suggest that the ceremony, which took place in Esztergom or Székesfehérvár followed the rite of the coronation of the German kings. Accordingly, Stephen was anointed with consecrated oil during the ceremony. Stephen&#x27;s portrait, preserved on his royal cloak from 1031, shows that his crown, like the Holy Roman Emperor&#x27;s diadem, was a hoop crown decorated with gemstones.

Besides his crown, Stephen regarded a spear with a flag as an important symbol of his sovereignty. For instance, his first coins bear the inscription LANCEA REGIS (&quot;the king&#x27;s spear&quot;) and depict an arm holding a spear with flag. According to the contemporaneous Adémar de Chabannes, a spear had been given to Stephen&#x27;s father by Emperor Otto III as a token of Géza&#x27;s right to &quot;enjoy the most freedom in the possession of his country&quot;. Stephen is styled in various ways&quot;Ungarorum rex&quot; (&quot;king of the Hungarians&quot;), &quot;Pannoniorum rex&quot; (&quot;king of the Pannonians&quot;) or &quot;Hungarie rex&quot; (&quot;king of Hungary&quot;)in his charters.

=== Consolidation (1001– 1009) ===
Although Stephen&#x27;s power did not rely on his coronation, the ceremony granted him the internationally accepted legitimacy of a Christian monarch who ruled his realm &quot;by the Grace of God&quot;. All his legends testify that he established an archbishopric with its see in Esztergom shortly after his coronation. This act ensured that the Church in Hungary became independent of the prelates of the Holy Roman Empire. The earliest reference to an archbishop of Esztergom, named Domokos, has been preserved in the deed of foundation of the Pannonhalma Archabbey from 1002. According to historian Gábor Thoroczkay, Stephen also established the Diocese of Kalocsa in 1001. Stephen invited foreign priests to Hungary to evangelize his kingdom. Associates of the late Adalbert of Prague, including Radla and Astrik, arrived in Hungary in the first years of his reign. The presence of an unnamed &quot;Archbishop of the Hungarians&quot; at the synod of 1007 of Frankfurt and the consecration of an altar in Bamberg in 1012 by Archbishop Astrik show that Stephen&#x27;s prelates maintained a good relationship with the clergy of the Holy Roman Empire.

The transformation of Hungary into a Christian state was one of Stephen&#x27;s principal concerns throughout his reign. Although the Hungarians&#x27; conversion had already begun in his father&#x27;s reign, it was only Stephen who systematically forced his subjects to give up their pagan rituals. His legislative activity was closely connected with Christianity. For example, his &quot;First Book of Laws&quot; from the first years of his reign includes several provisions prescribing the observance of feast days and the confession before death. His other laws protected property rights and the interests of widows and orphans, or regulated the status of serfs.


Many Hungarian lords refused to accept Stephen&#x27;s suzerainty even after his coronation. The new King first turned against his own uncle, Gyula the Younger, whose realm &quot;was most wide and rich&quot;, according to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;. Stephen invaded Transylvania and seized Gyula and his family around 1002 or in 1003. The contemporary &quot;Annals of Hildesheim&quot; adds that Stephen converted his uncle&#x27;s &quot;country to the Christian faith by force&quot; after its conquest. Accordingly, historians date the establishment of the Diocese of Transylvania to this period. If the identification, proposed by Kristó, Györffy and other Hungarian historians, of Gyula with one Prokuiwho was Stephen&#x27;s uncle according to Thietmar of Merseburgis valid, Gyula later escaped from captivity and fled to Bolesław I the Brave, Duke of Poland (r. 992–1025).

About a hundred years later, the chronicler Gallus Anonymus also made mention of armed conflicts between Stephen and Boleslav, stating that the latter &quot;defeated the Hungarians in battle and made himself master of all their lands as far as the Danube&quot;. Györffy says that the chronicler&#x27;s report refers to the occupation of the valley of the river Moravaa tributary of the Danubeby the Poles in the 1010s. On the other hand, the &quot;Polish-Hungarian Chronicle&quot; states that the Polish duke occupied large territories north of the Danube and east of the Morava as far as Esztergom in the early 11th century. According to Steinhübel, the latter source proves that a significant part of the lands that now form Slovakia were under Polish rule between 1002 and 1030. In contrast with the Slovak historian, Györffy writes that this late chronicle &quot;in which one absurdity follows another&quot; contradicts all facts known from 11th-century sources.

The &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; narrates that Stephen &quot;led his army against Kean, Duke of the Bulgarians and Slavs whose lands are by their natural position most strongly fortified&quot; following the occupation of Gyula&#x27;s country. According to a number of historians, including Zoltán Lenkey and Gábor Thoroczkay, Kean was the head of a small state located in the southern parts of Transylvania and Stephen occupied his country around 1003. Other historians, including Györffy, say that the chronicle&#x27;s report preserved the memory of Stephen&#x27;s campaign against Bulgaria in the late 1010s.

Likewise, the identification of the &quot;Black Hungarians&quot;who were mentioned by Bruno of Querfurt and Adémar de Chabannes among the opponents of Stephen&#x27;s proselytizing policyis uncertain. Györffy locates their lands to the east of the river Tisza; while Thoroczkay says they live in the southern parts of Transdanubia. Bruno of Querfurt&#x27;s report of the Black Hungarians&#x27; conversion by force suggests that Stephen conquered their lands at the latest in 1009 when &quot;the first mission of Saint Peter&quot;a papal legate, Cardinal Azoarrived in Hungary. The latter attended the meeting in Győr where the royal charter determining the borders of the newly established Bishopric of Pécs was issued on 23 August 1009.

The Diocese of Eger was also set up around 1009. According to Thoroczkay, &quot;it is very probable&quot; that the bishopric&#x27;s establishment was connected with the conversion of the Kabarsan ethnic group of Khazar origin and their chieftain. The head of the Kabarswho was either Samuel Aba or his father married Stephen&#x27;s unnamed younger sister on this occasion. The Aba clan was the most powerful among the native families who joined Stephen and supported him in his efforts to establish a Christian monarchy. The reports by Anonymus, Simon of Kéza and other Hungarian chroniclers of the Bár-Kalán, Csák and other 13th-century noble families descending from Hungarian chieftains suggest that other native families were also involved in the process.

Stephen set up a territory-based administrative system, establishing counties. Each county, headed by a royal official known as a count or &quot;ispán&quot;, was an administrative unit organized around a royal fortress. Most fortresses were earthworks in this period, but the castles at Esztergom, Székesfehérvár and Veszprém were built of stone. Forts serving as county seats also became the nuclei of Church organization. The settlements developing around them, where markets were held on each Sunday, were important local economic centers.

=== Wars with Poland and Bulgaria ( 1009–1018) ===

Stephen&#x27;s brother-in-law, Henry II, became King of Germany in 1002 and Holy Roman Emperor in 1013. Their friendly relationship ensured that the western borders of Hungary experienced a period of peace in the first decades of the 11th century. Even when Henry II&#x27;s discontented brother, Bruno, sought refuge in Hungary in 1004, Stephen preserved the peace with Germany and negotiated a settlement between his two brothers-in-law. Around 1009, he gave his younger sister in marriage to Otto Orseolo, Doge of Venice (r. 1008–1026), a close ally of the Byzantine Emperor, Basil II (r. 976–1025), which suggests that Hungary&#x27;s relationship with the Byzantine Empire was also peaceful. On the other hand, the alliance between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire brought her into a war with Poland lasting from around 1014 until 1018. The Poles occupied the Hungarian posts along the river Morava. Györffy and Kristó write that a Pecheneg incursion into Transylvania, the memory of which has been preserved in Stephen&#x27;s legends, also took place in this period, because the Pechenegs were close allies of the Polish duke&#x27;s brother-in-law, Grand Prince Sviatopolk I of Kiev (r. 1015–1019).

Poland and the Holy Roman Empire concluded the Peace of Bautzen in January 1018. Later in the same year, 500 Hungarian horsemen accompanied Boleslav of Poland to Kyiv, suggesting that Hungary had been included in the peace treaty. The historian Ferenc Makk says that the Peace of Bautzen obliged Boleslav to hand over all the territories he had occupied in the Morava valley to Stephen. According to Leodvin, the first known Bishop of Bihar (r. 1050 – 1060), Stephen allied with the Byzantines and led a military expedition to assist them against &quot;barbarians&quot; in the Balkan Peninsula. The Byzantine and Hungarian troops jointly took &quot;Cesaries&quot; which Györffy identifies as the present-day town of Ohrid. Leodvin&#x27;s report suggests that Stephen joined the Byzantines in the war ending with their conquest of Bulgaria in 1018. However, the exact date of his expedition is uncertain. Györffy argues that it was only in the last year of the war that Stephen led his troops against the Bulgarians.

=== Domestic policies (1018–1024) ===


Bishop Leodvin wrote that Stephen collected relics of a number of saints in &quot;Cesaries&quot; during his campaign in the Balkans, including Saint George and Saint Nicholas. He donated them to his new triple-naved basilica dedicated to the Holy Virgin in Székesfehérvár, where he also set up a cathedral chapter and his new capital. His decision was influenced by the opening, in 1018 or 1019, of a new pilgrimage route that bypassed his old capital, Esztergom. The new route connected Western Europe and the Holy Land through Hungary. Stephen often met the pilgrims, contributing to the spread of his fame throughout Europe. Abbot Odilo of Cluny, for example, wrote in a letter to Stephen that &quot;those who have returned from the shrine of our Lord&quot; testify to the king&#x27;s passion &quot;towards the honour of our divine religion&quot;. Stephen also established four hostels for pilgrims in Constantinople, Jerusalem, Ravenna and Rome.

In addition to pilgrims, merchants often used the safe route across Hungary when travelling between Constantinople and Western Europe. Stephen&#x27;s legends refer to 60 wealthy Pechenegs who travelled to Hungary, but were attacked by Hungarian border guards. The king sentenced his soldiers to death in order to demonstrate his determination to preserve internal peace. Regular minting of coinage began in Hungary in the 1020s. His silver dinars bearing the inscriptions STEPHANUS REX (&quot;King Stephen&quot;) and REGIA CIVITAS (&quot;royal city&quot;) were popular in contemporary Europe, as demonstrated by counterfeited copies unearthed in Sweden.

Stephen convinced some pilgrims and merchants to settle in Hungary. Gerard, a Benedictine monk who arrived in Hungary from the Republic of Venice between 1020 and 1026, initially planned to continue his journey to the Holy Land, but decided to stay in the country after his meeting with the king. Stephen also established a number of Benedictine monasteriesincluding the abbeys at Pécsvárad, Zalavár and Bakonybélin this period.

The &quot;Long Life of Saint Gerard&quot; mentions Stephen&#x27;s conflict with Ajtony, a chieftain in the region of the river Maros. Many historians date their clash to the end of the 1020s, although Györffy and other scholars put it at least a decade earlier. The conflict arose when Ajtony, who &quot;had taken his power from the Greeks&quot;, according to Saint Gerard&#x27;s legend, levied tax on the salt transported to Stephen on the river. The king sent a large army led by Csanád against Ajtony, who was killed in battle. His lands were transformed into a Hungarian county and the king set up a new bishopric at Csanád (Cenad, Romania), Ajtony&#x27;s former capital, which was renamed after the commander of the royal army. According to the &quot;Annales Posonienses&quot;, the Venetian Gerard was consecrated as the first bishop of the new diocese in 1030.

=== Conflicts with the Holy Roman Empire (1024–1031) ===

Stephen&#x27;s brother-in-law, Emperor Henry, died on 13 July 1024. He was succeeded by a distant relative, Conrad II (r. 1024–1039), who adopted an offensive foreign policy. Conrad II expelled Doge Otto Orseolothe husband of Stephen&#x27;s sisterfrom Venice in 1026. He also persuaded the Bavarians to proclaim his own son, Henry, as their duke in 1027, although Stephen&#x27;s son Emeric had a strong claim to the Duchy of Bavaria through his mother. Emperor Conrad planned a marriage alliance with the Byzantine Empire and dispatched one of his advisors, Bishop Werner of Strasbourg, to Constantinople. In the autumn of 1027, the bishop seemingly travelled as a pilgrim, but Stephen, who had been informed of his actual purpose, refused to let him enter into his country. Conrad II&#x27;s biographer Wipo of Burgundy narrated that the Bavarians incited skirmishes along the common borders of Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire in 1029, causing a rapid deterioration in relations between the two countries.

Emperor Conrad personally led his armies to Hungary in June 1030 and plundered the lands west of the River Rába. However, according to the &quot;Annals of Niederalteich&quot;, the emperor, suffering from consequences of the scorched earth tactics used by the Hungarian army, returned to Germany &quot;without an army and without achieving anything, because the army was threatened by starvation and was captured by the Hungarians at Vienna&quot;. Peace was restored after Conrad had ceded the lands between the rivers Lajta and Fischa to Hungary in the summer of 1031.

=== Last years (1031–1038) ===

Stephen&#x27;s biographer, Hartvic, narrates that the King, whose children died one by one in infancy, &quot;restrained the grief over their death by the solace on account of the love of his surviving son&quot;, Emeric. However, Emeric was wounded in a hunting accident and died in 1031. After the death of his son, the elderly King could never &quot;fully regain his former health&quot;, according to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;. Kristó writes that the picture, which has been preserved in Stephen&#x27;s legends, of the king keeping the vigils and washing the feet of paupers, is connected with Stephen&#x27;s last years, following the death of his son.

Emeric&#x27;s death jeopardized his father&#x27;s achievements in establishing a Christian state, because Stephen&#x27;s cousin, Vazulwho had the strongest claim to succeed himwas suspected of an inclination towards paganism. According to the &quot;Annals of Altaich&quot; Stephen disregarded his cousin&#x27;s claim and nominated his sister&#x27;s son, the Venetian Peter Orseolo, as his heir. The same source adds that Vazul was captured and blinded, and his three sons, Levente, Andrew and Béla, were expelled from Hungary. Stephen&#x27;s legends refer to an unsuccessful attempt upon the elderly king&#x27;s life by members of his court. According to Kristó, the legends refer to a plot in which Vazul participated and his mutilation was a punishment for this act. That Vazul&#x27;s ears were filled with molten lead was only recorded in later sources, including the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;.

In the view of some historians, provisions in Stephen&#x27;s &quot;Second Book of Laws&quot; on the &quot;conspiracy against the king and the kingdom&quot; imply that the book was promulgated after Vazul&#x27;s unsuccessful plot against Stephen. However, this view has not been universally accepted. Györffy states that the law book was issued, not after 1031, but around 1009. Likewise, the authenticity of the decree on tithes is debated: according to Györffy, it was issued during Stephen&#x27;s reign, but Berend, Laszlovszky and Szakács argue that it &quot;might be a later addition&quot;.

Stephen died on 15 August 1038. He was buried in the basilica of Székesfehérvár. His reign was followed by a long period of civil wars, pagan uprisings and foreign invasions. The instability ended in 1077 when Ladislaus, a grandson of Vazul, ascended the throne.

== Family ==
Stephen married Gisela, a daughter of Duke Henry the Wrangler of Bavaria, who was a nephew of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor. Gisela&#x27;s mother was Gisela of Burgundy, a member of the Welf dynasty. Born around 985, Gisela was younger than her husband, whom she survived. She left Hungary in 1045 and died as Abbess of the Niedernburg Abbey in Passau in Bavaria around 1060.

Although the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; states that Stephen &quot;begot many sons&quot;, only two of them, Otto and Emeric, are known by name. Otto, who was named after Otto III, seems to have been born before 1002. He died as a child.

Emeric, who received the name of his maternal uncle, Emperor Henry II, was born around 1007. His &quot;Legend&quot; from the early 12th century describes him as a saintly prince who preserved his chastity even during his marriage. According to Györffy, Emeric&#x27;s wife was a kinswoman of the Byzantine Emperor Basil II. His premature death led to the series of conflicts leading to Vazul&#x27;s blinding and civil wars.

The following family tree presents Stephen&#x27;s ancestors and his relatives who are mentioned in the article.





&quot;*A Khazar, Pecheneg or Volga Bulgarian lady.&quot;&quot;**Györffy writes that she may have been a member of the Bulgarian Cometopuli dynasty.&quot;&quot;***Samuel Aba might have been the son of Stephen&#x27;s sister instead of her husband.&quot;

== Legacy ==

=== Founder of Hungary ===
Stephen has always been considered one of the most important statesmen in the history of Hungary. His main achievement was the establishment of a Christian state that ensured that the Hungarians survived in the Carpathian Basin, in contrast to the Huns, Avars and other peoples who had previously controlled the same territory. As Bryan Cartledge emphasizes, Stephen also gave his kingdom &quot;forty years of relative peace and sound but unspectacular rule&quot;.

His successors, including those descended from Vazul, were eager to emphasize their devotion to Stephen&#x27;s achievements. Although Vazul&#x27;s son, Andrew I of Hungary, secured the throne due to a pagan uprising, he prohibited pagan rites and declared that his subjects should &quot;live in all things according to the law which King St. Stephen had taught them&quot;, according to the 14th-century &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;. In medieval Hungary, communities that claimed a privileged status or attempted to preserve their own &quot;liberties&quot; often declared that the origin of their special status was to be attributed to King Saint Stephen. An example is a 1347 letter from the people of Táp telling the king about their grievances against the Pannonhalma Archabbey and stating that the taxes levied upon them by the abbot contradicted &quot;the liberty granted to them in the time of King Saint Stephen&quot;.

=== Sainthood ===

Stephen&#x27;s cult emerged after the long period of anarchy characterizing the rule of his immediate successors. However, there is no evidence that Stephen became an object of veneration before his canonization. For instance, the first member of the royal family to be named after him, Stephen II, was born in the early 12th century.

Stephen&#x27;s canonization was initiated by Vazul&#x27;s grandson, King Ladislaus I of Hungary, who had consolidated his authority by capturing and imprisoning his cousin, Solomon. According to Bishop Hartvic, the canonization was &quot;decreed by apostolic letter, by order of the Roman see&quot;, suggesting that the ceremony was permitted by Pope Gregory VII. The ceremony started at Stephen&#x27;s tomb, where on 15 August 1083 masses of believers began three days of fasting and praying. Legend tells that Stephen&#x27;s coffin could not be opened until King Ladislaus held Solomon in captivity at Visegrád. The opening of Stephen&#x27;s tomb was followed by the occurrence of healing miracles, according to Stephen&#x27;s legends. Historian Kristó attributes the healings either to mass psychosis or deception. Stephen&#x27;s legends also say that his &quot;balsam-scented&quot; remains were elevated from the coffin, which was filled with &quot;rose-colored water&quot;, on 20 August. On the same day, Stephen&#x27;s son, Emeric, and the bishop of Csanád, Gerard, were also canonized.

Stephen&#x27;s first legend, the so-called &quot;Greater Legend&quot;, was written between 1077 and 1083. It provided an idealized portrait of the king, one who dedicated himself and his kingdom to the Virgin Mary. However, Stephen&#x27;s &quot;Lesser Legend&quot;composed around 1100, under King Colomanemphasized Stephen&#x27;s severity. A third legend, also composed during King Coloman&#x27;s reign by Bishop Hartvic, was based on the two existing legends. Sanctioned in 1201 by Pope Innocent III, Hartvic&#x27;s work served as Stephen&#x27;s official legend. Gábor Klaniczay wrote that Stephen&#x27;s legends &quot;opened a new chapter in the legends of holy rulers as a genre&quot;, suggesting that a monarch can achieve sainthood through actively using his royal powers. Stephen was the first triumphant &quot;miles Christi&quot; (&quot;Christ&#x27;s soldier&quot;) among the canonized monarchs. He was also a &quot;confessor king&quot;, one who had not suffered martyrdom, whose cult was sanctioned, in contrast with earlier holy monarchs.

Stephen&#x27;s cult spread beyond the borders of Hungary. Initially, he was primarily venerated in Scheyern and Bamberg, in Bavaria, but his relics were also taken to Aachen, Cologne, Montecassino and Namur. Upon the liberation of Buda from the Ottoman Turks, Pope Innocent XI expanded King Saint Stephen&#x27;s cult to the entire Roman Catholic Church in 1686, and declared 2 September his feast day. As the feast of Saint Joachim was moved, in 1969, from 16 August, the day immediately following the day of Stephen&#x27;s death, Stephen&#x27;s feast was moved to that date. Stephen is venerated as the patron saint of Hungary, and regarded as the protector of kings, masons, stonecutters, stonemasons and bricklayers, and also of children suffering from severe illnesses. His canonization was recognized by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople in 2000. In the calendar of the Hungarian Catholic Church, Stephen&#x27;s feast is observed on 20 August, the day on which his relics were translated. In addition, a separate feast day (30 May) is dedicated to his &quot;Holy Dexter&quot;.

=== Holy Dexter ===

Stephen&#x27;s intact dexter, or right hand (), became the subject of a cult. A cleric named Mercurius stole it, but it was discovered on 30 May 1084 in Bihar County. The theft of sacred relics, or &quot;furta sacra&quot;, had by that time become a popular topic of saints&#x27; biographies. Bishop Hartvic described the discovery of Stephen&#x27;s right hand in accordance with this tradition, referring to adventures and visions. An abbey erected in Bihar County (now Sâniob, Romania) was named after and dedicated to the veneration of the Holy Dexter.

The Holy Dexter was kept for centuries in the Szentjobb Abbey, except during the Mongol invasion of 1241 and 1242, when it was transferred to Ragusa (now Dubrovnik, Croatia). The relic was then taken to Székesfehérvár around 1420. Following the Ottoman occupation of the central territories of the Kingdom of Hungary in the mid-16th century, it was guarded in many places, including Bosnia, Ragusa and Vienna. It was returned to Hungary in 1771, when Queen Maria Theresa donated it to the cloister of the Sisters of Loreto in Buda. It was kept in Buda Castle&#x27;s St. Sigismund Chapel between around 1900 and 1944, in a cave near Salzburg in 1944 and 1945, and again by the Sisters of Loreto in Buda, between 1945 and 1950. Finally, since 1950, the Holy Dexter has been in St. Stephen&#x27;s Basilica in Budapest. An annual procession celebrating the relic was instituted in 1938, and continued until 1950, when the procession was forbidden by the Communist government. It was resumed in 1988.

=== &quot;Admonitions&quot; ===

According to Stephen&#x27;s &quot;Greater Legend&quot;, the king &quot;himself compiled a book for his son on moral education&quot;. This work, now known as &quot;Admonitions&quot; or &quot;De institutione morum&quot;, was preserved in manuscripts written in the Late Middle Ages. Although scholars debate whether it can actually be attributed to the king or a cleric, most of them agree that it was composed in the first decades of the 11th century.

The &quot;Admonitions&quot; argues that kingship is inseparably connected with the Catholic faith. Its author emphasized that a monarch is required to make donations to the Church and regularly consult his prelates, but is entitled to punish clergymen who do wrong. One of its basic ideas was that a sovereign has to cooperate with the &quot;pillars of his rule&quot;, meaning the prelates, aristocrats, &quot;ispáns&quot; and warriors.

=== In arts ===
King St Stephen has been a popular theme in Hungarian poetry since the end of the 13th century. The earliest poems were religious hymns which portrayed the holy king as the apostle of the Hungarians. Secular poetry, especially poems written for his feast day, followed a similar pattern, emphasizing Stephen&#x27;s role as the first king of Hungary. Poets described Stephen as the symbol of national identity and independence and of the ability of the Hungarian nation to survive historical cataclysms during the Communist regime between 1949 and 1989.

A popular hymn, still sung in the churches, was first recorded in the late . It hails King St. Stephen as &quot;radiant star of Hungarians&quot;. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his &quot;King Stephen Overture&quot; for the inauguration of the Hungarian theatre in Pest in 1812. According to musician James M. Keller, &quot;[t]he descending unisons that open the &quot;King Stephen Overture&quot; would seem to prefigure the opening of the &quot;Ninth Symphony&quot; [a]nd then a later theme, introduced by flutes and clarinets, seems almost to be a of the famous &quot;Ode &#x27;To Joy&quot;&#x27; melody of the Ninth Symphony&#x27;s finale&quot;. Hungarian composer Ferenc Erkel named his last complete opera from 1885, &quot;István király&quot; (&quot;King Stephen&quot;), after him. In 1938, Zoltán Kodály wrote a choral piece titled &quot;Ének Szent István Királyhoz&quot; (&quot;Hymn to King Stephen&quot;). In 1983, Levente Szörényi and János Bródy composed a rock opera—&quot;István, a király&quot; (&quot;Stephen, the King&quot;)—about the early years of his reign. Seventeen years later, in 2000, Szörényi composed a sequel called &quot;Veled, Uram!&quot; (&quot;You, Sir&quot;).

<text>San Giovanni di Posada (Latin: Portus Luguidonis or Portus Liquidonis) is a &quot;frazione&quot; and small village in Sardinia, Italy, on the Tyrrhenian coast of the island, in the territory of the &quot;comune&quot; of Posada.

Formerly known as Marina di Posada, it underwent rebuilding in the 1970s as an residential village for tourism.

Its history goes back to the Roman harbour (named &quot;Portus Luguidonis&quot; - presumably located in the little bay in front of the ancient church of St. John), from where the Romans entered inner Sardinia. Through this harbour passed all the goods to or from Rome, but all the cargo was carried by small and light ships directed to Olbia (some 50km north), where bigger ships would have trafficked with Ostia. Traffic was supposedly intense, Sardinia bearing the &quot;sobriquet&quot; &quot;the granary of Rome&quot;.

In the immediate surroundings, it is supposed there was a temple in honour of Feronia, an Etruscan deity, goddess of the waters; this would prove the presence of Etruscans in this area at the time of Nuragici people. A similar cult of Feronia is reported on the Italian mainland at least in two places: in Fiano Romano (near Rome), and in Terracina, some 120km south of Rome.

It is one of the main tourist destinations of Sardinia, has a long beach (more than 15km of white sand) and a system of rivers of biological importance. A part of this territory is going to be formally protected in the near future with the creation of a nature park (&quot;Parco Fluviale&quot;).

<text>Scott Joplin (November 24, 1868 – April 1, 1917) was an American composer and pianist. Dubbed the &quot;King of Ragtime&quot;, he composed more than 40 ragtime pieces, one ragtime ballet, and two operas. One of his first and most popular pieces, the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot;, became the genre&#x27;s first and most influential hit, later being recognized as the quintessential rag. Joplin considered ragtime to be a form of classical music meant to be played in concert halls and largely disdained the performance of ragtime as honky tonk music most common in saloons.

Joplin grew up in a musical family of railway laborers in Texarkana, Texas. During the late 1880s, he traveled the American South as a musician. He went to Chicago for the World&#x27;s Fair of 1893, which helped make ragtime a national craze by 1897. Joplin moved to Sedalia, Missouri, in 1894 and worked as a piano teacher. He began publishing music in 1895, and his &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; in 1899 brought him fame and a steady income. In 1901, Joplin moved to St. Louis and two years later scored his first opera, &quot;A Guest of Honor&quot;. It was confiscated—along with his belongings—for non-payment of bills and is now considered lost. In 1907, Joplin moved to New York City to (unsuccessfully) find a producer for a new opera. In 1916, Joplin descended into dementia from neurosyphilis. His 1917 death marks the end of the ragtime era. 

Joplin&#x27;s music was rediscovered and returned to popularity in the early 1970s with the release of a million-selling album recorded by Joshua Rifkin. This was followed by the Academy Award–winning 1973 film &quot;The Sting&quot;, which featured several of Joplin&#x27;s compositions. &quot;Treemonisha&quot;, his second opera, was produced in 1972 and in 1976 Joplin was awarded a Pulitzer Prize.
==Early life==
Joplin was the second of six children born to Giles Joplin, a former slave from North Carolina, and Florence Givens, a freeborn African-American woman from Kentucky. His birth date was accepted by early biographers Rudi Blesh and James Haskins as November 24, 1868, although later biographer Edward A. Berlin showed this was most likely incorrect. It is generally accepted he was born between the summer of 1867 and January 1868. There is disagreement over his exact place of birth in Texas, with Blesh identifying Texarkana, and Berlin showing the earliest record of Joplin being the June 1870 census which locates him as a two-year-old in Linden (about 40 miles from Texarkana). 

By 1880, the Joplins had moved to Texarkana, Arkansas, where Giles worked as a railroad laborer and Florence as a cleaner. As Joplin&#x27;s father had played the violin for plantation parties in North Carolina and his mother sang and played the banjo, Joplin was given a rudimentary musical education by his family, and from the age of seven he was allowed to play the piano while his mother cleaned.

At some point in the early 1880s, Giles Joplin left the family for another woman and Florence struggled to support her children through domestic work. Biographer Susan Curtis speculates that Florence&#x27;s support of her son&#x27;s musical education was a critical factor behind her separation from Giles, who wanted the boy to pursue practical employment that would supplement the family income.

At 16, Joplin performed in a vocal quartet with three other boys in and around Texarkana, also playing piano. He also taught guitar and mandolin. According to a family friend, the young Joplin was serious and ambitious in studying music and playing the piano after school. While a few local teachers aided him, he received most of his musical education from Julius Weiss, a German-born American Jewish music professor who had immigrated to Texas in the late 1860s and was employed as music tutor by a prominent local business family. Weiss, as described by &quot;San Diego Jewish World&quot; writer Eric George Tauber, &quot;was no stranger to [receiving] race hatred ... As a Jew in Germany, he was often slapped and called a &#x27;Christ-killer. Weiss had studied music at a German university and was listed in town records as a professor of music. Impressed by Joplin&#x27;s talent, and realizing the Joplin family&#x27;s dire straits, Weiss taught him free of charge. While tutoring Joplin from the ages of 11 to 16, Weiss introduced him to folk and classical music, including opera. Weiss helped Joplin appreciate music as an &quot;art as well as an entertainment&quot; and helped Florence acquire a used piano. According to Joplin&#x27;s widow Lottie, Joplin never forgot Weiss. In his later years, after achieving fame as a composer, Joplin sent his former teacher &quot;gifts of money when he was old and ill&quot; until Weiss died.

==Life in the Southern states and Chicago==
In the late 1880s, having performed at various local events as a teenager, Joplin gave up his job as a railroad laborer and left Texarkana to become a traveling musician. Little is known about his movements at this time, although he is recorded in Texarkana in July 1891 as a member of the Texarkana Minstrels, who were raising money for a monument to Jefferson Davis, president of the former Confederate States of America. However, Joplin soon learned that there were few opportunities for black pianists. Churches and brothels were among the few options for steady work. Joplin played pre-ragtime &quot;jig-piano&quot; in various red-light districts throughout the mid-South, and some claim he was in Sedalia and St. Louis, Missouri, during this time.

In 1893, while in Chicago for the World&#x27;s Fair, Joplin formed a band in which he played cornet and also arranged the band&#x27;s music. Although the World&#x27;s Fair minimized the involvement of African Americans, black performers still came to the saloons, cafés, and brothels that lined the fair. The exposition was attended by 27 million visitors and had a profound effect on many areas of American cultural life, including ragtime. Although specific information is sparse, numerous sources have credited the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair with spreading the popularity of ragtime. Joplin found that his music, as well as that of other black performers, was popular with visitors. By 1897, ragtime had become a national craze in U.S. cities and was described by the &quot;St. Louis Dispatch&quot; as &quot;a veritable call of the wild, which mightily stirred the pulses of city-bred people&quot;.

==Life in Missouri==

In 1894, Joplin arrived in Sedalia, Missouri. At first, Joplin stayed with the family of Arthur Marshall, a 13-year-old boy who later became one of Joplin&#x27;s students and a ragtime composer in his own right. There is no record of Joplin having a residence in the town until 1904, as Joplin was making a living as a touring musician.

There is little precise evidence known about Joplin&#x27;s activities at this time, although he performed as a solo musician at dances and at the major black clubs in Sedalia, the Black 400 Club and the Maple Leaf Club. He performed in the Queen City Cornet Band and his own six-piece dance orchestra. A tour with his own singing group, the Texas Medley Quartet, gave him his first opportunity to publish his own compositions, and it is known that he went to Syracuse, New York, and Texas. Three businessmen from Syracuse (M. L. Mantell and the Leiter brothers) published Joplin&#x27;s first two works, the songs &quot;Please Say You Will&quot; and &quot;A Picture of Her Face&quot;, in 1895. Joplin&#x27;s visit to Temple, Texas, enabled him to have three pieces published there in 1896, including the &quot;Great Crush Collision March&quot;, which commemorated a planned train crash on the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad on September 15 that he may have witnessed. The march was described by one of Joplin&#x27;s biographers as a &quot;special ... early essay in ragtime.&quot; While in Sedalia, Joplin taught piano to students who included future ragtime composers Arthur Marshall, Brun Campbell and Scott Hayden. Joplin enrolled at the George R. Smith College, where he apparently studied &quot;advanced harmony and composition.&quot; The college&#x27;s records were destroyed in a fire in 1925, and biographer Edward A. Berlin notes that it was unlikely that a small college for African-Americans would be able to provide such a course.

Although there were hundreds of rags in print by the time the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; was published, Joplin was not far behind. He completed his first published rag, &quot;Original Rags&quot; in 1897, the same year that the first ragtime work appeared in print, the &quot;Mississippi Rag&quot; by William Krell. The &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; was likely to have been known in Sedalia before its publication in 1899; Brun Campbell claimed to have seen the manuscript of the work in around 1898. The exact circumstances that led to the publication of the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; are unknown and a number of versions of the event contradict each other. After several unsuccessful approaches to publishers, Joplin signed a contract on August 10, 1899, with John Stillwell Stark, a retailer of musical instruments who became his most important publisher. The contract stipulated that Joplin would receive a 1% royalty on all sales of the rag, with a minimum sales price of 25 cents. With the inscription &quot;To the Maple Leaf Club&quot; prominently visible along the top of at least some editions, it is likely that the rag was named after the Maple Leaf Club, although there is no direct evidence to prove the link, and there were many other possible sources for the name in and around Sedalia at the time.

There have been many claims about the sales of the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot;, one being that Joplin was the first musician to sell 1 million copies of a piece of instrumental music. Joplin&#x27;s first biographer, Rudi Blesh, wrote that during its first six months the piece sold 75,000 copies and became &quot;the first great instrumental sheet music hit in America.&quot; However, research by Joplin&#x27;s later biographer Edward A. Berlin demonstrated that this was not the case; the initial print-run of 400 took one year to sell, and, under the terms of Joplin&#x27;s contract with a 1% royalty, would have given Joplin an income of $4 (or approximately $ at current prices). Later sales were steady and would have given Joplin an income that would have covered his expenses. In 1909, estimated sales would have given him an income of $600 annually (approximately $16,968 in current prices).

The &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; did serve as a model for the hundreds of rags to come from future composers, especially in the development of classic ragtime. After the publication of the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot;, Joplin was soon being described as &quot;King of rag time writers&quot;, not least by himself on the covers of his own work, such as &quot;The Easy Winners&quot; and &quot;Elite Syncopations&quot;.

During his time in St. Louis, Joplin collaborated with Scott Hayden in the composition of four rags. It was in St. Louis that Joplin produced some of his best-known works, including &quot;The Entertainer&quot;, &quot;March Majestic&quot;, and the short theatrical work &quot;The Ragtime Dance&quot;. In 1901, Joplin married his first wife Belle Jones (1875–1903) a sister-in-law of Scott Hayden. By 1903, the Joplins had moved to a 13-room house, renting some of the rooms to lodgers, who included pianist-composers Arthur Marshall and Scott Hayden. Joplin did not work as a pianist in the saloons in St Louis, which was usually a major source of income for musicians, as he was &quot;probably outclassed by the competition&quot; and was, according to Stark&#x27;s son, &quot;a mediocre pianist&quot;. Biographer Berlin speculated that by 1903 Joplin was already showing early signs of syphilis, which reduced his coordination and &quot;pianistic skills&quot;. In 1903, Joplin&#x27;s only child—a daughter—died. After returning to Arkansas, Joplin and his first wife drifted apart, ending their marriage.

In June 1904, Joplin married Freddie Alexander of Little Rock, Arkansas, the young woman to whom he had dedicated &quot;The Chrysanthemum&quot;. She died on September 10, 1904, of complications resulting from a cold, ten weeks after their wedding. &quot;Bethena&quot;, Joplin&#x27;s first work copyrighted after Freddie&#x27;s death, was described by one biographer as &quot;an enchantingly beautiful piece that is among the greatest of ragtime waltzes&quot;.

During this time, Joplin created an opera company of 30 people and produced his first opera &quot;A Guest of Honor&quot; for a national tour. It is not certain how many productions were staged, or even whether this was an all-black show or a racially mixed production. During the tour, either in Springfield, Illinois, or Pittsburg, Kansas, someone associated with the company stole the box office receipts. Joplin could not meet the company&#x27;s payroll or pay for its lodgings at a theatrical boarding house. It is believed that the score for &quot;A Guest of Honor&quot; was lost and perhaps destroyed because of non-payment of the company&#x27;s boarding house bill.

==Later years and death==
In 1907, Joplin moved to New York City, which he believed was the best place to find a producer for a new opera. After his move to New York, Joplin met Lottie Stokes, whom he married in 1909. In 1911, unable to find a publisher, Joplin undertook the financial burden of publishing &quot;Treemonisha&quot; himself in piano-vocal format. In 1915, as a last-ditch effort to see it performed, he invited a small audience to hear it at a rehearsal hall in Harlem. Poorly staged and with only Joplin on piano accompaniment, it was &quot;a miserable failure&quot; to a public not ready for &quot;crude&quot; black musical forms—so different from the European grand opera of that time. The audience, including potential backers, was indifferent and walked out. Scott writes that &quot;after a disastrous single performance...Joplin suffered a breakdown. He was bankrupt, discouraged, and worn out.&quot; He concludes that few American artists of his generation faced such obstacles: &quot;&quot;Treemonisha&quot; went unnoticed and unreviewed, largely because Joplin had abandoned commercial music in favor of art music, a field closed to African Americans.&quot; It was not until the 1970s that the opera received a full theatrical staging.

In 1914, Joplin and Lottie self-published his &quot;Magnetic Rag&quot; as the Scott Joplin Music Company, which he had formed the previous December. Biographer Vera Brodsky Lawrence speculates that Joplin was aware of his advancing deterioration due to syphilis and was &quot;consciously racing against time.&quot; In her sleeve notes on the 1992 Deutsche Grammophon release of &quot;Treemonisha&quot;, she notes that he &quot;plunged feverishly into the task of orchestrating his opera, day and night, with his friend Sam Patterson standing by to copy out the parts, page by page, as each page of the full score was completed.&quot;

By 1916, Joplin had developed tertiary syphilis, but more specifically it was likely neurosyphilis. On February 2, 1917, he was admitted to Manhattan State Hospital, a mental institution. The &quot;King of Ragtime&quot; died there on April 1 of syphilitic dementia at the age of 48 and was buried in a pauper&#x27;s grave that remained unmarked for 57 years. His grave, located at St. Michael&#x27;s Cemetery in East Elmhurst was finally given a marker in 1974, the year &quot;The Sting&quot;, which showcased his music, won Best Picture at the Oscars.

==Works==

The combination of classical music, the musical atmosphere present around Texarkana (including work songs, gospel hymns, spirituals and dance music), and Joplin&#x27;s natural ability have been cited as contributing to the invention of ragtime: a new style that blended African-American musical styles with European forms and melodies and first became celebrated in the 1890s .

When Joplin was learning the piano, serious musical circles condemned ragtime because of its association with the vulgar and inane songs &quot;cranked out by the tune-smiths of Tin Pan Alley.&quot; As a composer, Joplin refined ragtime, elevating it above the low and unrefined form played by the &quot;wandering honky-tonk pianists ... playing mere dance music&quot; of popular imagination. This new art form, the classic rag, combined Afro-American folk music&#x27;s syncopation and 19th-century European romanticism, with its harmonic schemes and its march-like tempos. In the words of one critic: &quot;Ragtime was basically...an Afro-American version of the polka, or its analog, the Sousa-style march.&quot; With this as a foundation, Joplin intended his compositions to be played exactly as he wrote them—without improvisation. Joplin wrote his rags as &quot;classical&quot; music in miniature form in order to raise ragtime above its &quot;cheap bordello&quot; origins and produced work that opera historian Elise Kirk described as &quot;more tuneful, contrapuntal, infectious, and harmonically colorful than any others of his era.&quot;

Some speculate that Joplin&#x27;s achievements were influenced by his classically trained German music teacher Julius Weiss, who may have brought a polka rhythmic sensibility from the old country to the 11-year old Joplin. As Curtis put it, &quot;The educated German could open up the door to a world of learning and music of which young Joplin was largely unaware.&quot;

Joplin&#x27;s first and most significant hit, the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot;, was described as the archetype of the classic rag and influenced subsequent rag composers for at least 12 years after its initial publication, thanks to its rhythmic patterns, melody lines, and harmony, though with the exception of Joseph Lamb and James Scott, they generally failed to enlarge upon it. Joplin used the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; as inspiration for subsequent works, such as &quot;The Cascades&quot; in 1903, &quot;Leola&quot; in 1905, &quot;Gladiolus Rag&quot; in 1907, and &quot;Sugar Cane Rag&quot; in 1908. While he used similar harmonic and melodic patterns, the later compositions were not simple copies but were distinctly new works, which used dissonance, chromatic sections and the blues third.

===&quot;Treemonisha&quot;===

The opera&#x27;s setting is a former slave community in an isolated forest near Joplin&#x27;s childhood town Texarkana in September 1884. The plot centers on an 18-year-old woman Treemonisha who is taught to read by a white woman and then leads her community against the influence of conjurers who prey on ignorance and superstition. Treemonisha is abducted and is about to be thrown into a wasps&#x27; nest when her friend Remus rescues her. The community realizes the value of education and the liability of their ignorance before choosing her as their teacher and leader.

Joplin wrote both the score and the libretto for the opera, which largely follows the form of European opera with many conventional arias, ensembles and choruses. In addition, the themes of superstition and mysticism evident in &quot;Treemonisha&quot; are common in the operatic tradition, and certain aspects of the plot echo devices in the work of the German composer Richard Wagner (of which Joplin was aware). A sacred tree that Treemonisha sits beneath recalls the tree that Siegmund takes his enchanted sword from in &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, and the retelling of the heroine&#x27;s origins echos aspects of the opera &quot;Siegfried&quot;. In addition, African-American folk tales also influence the story—the wasp nest incident is similar to the story of Br&#x27;er Rabbit and the briar patch.

&quot;Treemonisha&quot; is not a ragtime opera—because Joplin employed the styles of ragtime and other black music sparingly, using them to convey &quot;racial character&quot; and to celebrate the music of his childhood at the end of the 19th century. The opera has been seen as a valuable record of rural black music from late 19th century, re-created by a &quot;skilled and sensitive participant.&quot;

Berlin speculates about parallels between the plot and Joplin&#x27;s own life. He notes that Lottie Joplin (the composer&#x27;s third wife) saw a connection between the character Treemonisha&#x27;s wish to lead her people out of ignorance and a similar desire in the composer. In addition, it has been speculated that Treemonisha represents Freddie, Joplin&#x27;s second wife, because the date of the opera&#x27;s setting was likely to have been the month of her birth.

At the time of the opera&#x27;s publication in 1911, the &quot;American Musician and Art Journal&quot; praised it as &quot;an entirely new form of operatic art&quot;. Later critics have also praised the opera as occupying a special place in American history, with its heroine &quot;a startlingly early voice for modern civil rights causes, notably the importance of education and knowledge to African American advancement.&quot; Curtis&#x27;s conclusion is similar: &quot;In the end, &quot;Treemonisha&quot; offered a celebration of literacy, learning, hard work, and community solidarity as the best formula for advancing the race.&quot; Berlin describes it as a &quot;fine opera, certainly more interesting than most operas then being written in the United States,&quot; but later states that Joplin&#x27;s own libretto showed the composer &quot;was not a competent dramatist,&quot; with the book not up to the quality of the music.

As Rick Benjamin, the founder and director of the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra, found out, Joplin succeeded in performing &quot;Treemonisha&quot; for paying audiences in Bayonne, New Jersey, in 1913.

===Performance skills===
Joplin&#x27;s skills as a pianist were described in glowing terms by a Sedalia newspaper in 1898, and fellow ragtime composers Arthur Marshall and Joe Jordan both said that he played the instrument well. However, the son of publisher John Stark stated that Joplin was a rather mediocre pianist and that he composed on paper, rather than at the piano. Artie Matthews recalled the &quot;delight&quot; the St. Louis players took in outplaying Joplin.

While Joplin never made an audio recording, his playing is preserved on seven piano rolls for use in mechanical player pianos. All seven were made in 1916. Of these, the six released under the Connorized label show evidence of editing to correct the performance to strict rhythm and add embellishments, probably by the staff musicians at Connorized. Berlin theorizes that by the time Joplin reached St. Louis, he may have experienced discoordination of the fingers, tremors, and an inability to speak clearly—all symptoms of the syphilis that killed him in 1917. Biographer Blesh described the second roll recording of &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; on the UniRecord label from June 1916 as &quot;shocking...disorganized and completely distressing to hear.&quot; While there is disagreement among piano-roll experts as to how much of this is due to the relatively primitive recording and production techniques of the time, Berlin notes that the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; roll was likely to be the truest record of Joplin&#x27;s playing at the time. The roll, however, may not reflect his abilities earlier in life.

==Legacy==
Joplin and his fellow ragtime composers rejuvenated American popular music, fostering an appreciation for African American music among European Americans by creating exhilarating and liberating dance tunes. &quot;Its syncopation and rhythmic drive gave it a vitality and freshness attractive to young urban audiences indifferent to Victorian proprieties...Joplin&#x27;s ragtime expressed the intensity and energy of a modern urban America.&quot;

Joshua Rifkin, a leading Joplin recording artist, wrote, &quot;A pervasive sense of lyricism infuses his work, and even at his most high-spirited, he cannot repress a hint of melancholy or adversity...He had little in common with the fast and flashy school of ragtime that grew up after him.&quot; Joplin historian Bill Ryerson adds that &quot;In the hands of authentic practitioners like Joplin, ragtime was a disciplined form capable of astonishing variety and subtlety...Joplin did for the rag what Chopin did for the mazurka. His style ranged from tones of torment to stunning serenades that incorporated the bolero and the tango.&quot; Biographer Susan Curtis wrote that Joplin&#x27;s music had helped to &quot;revolutionise American music and culture&quot; by removing Victorian restraint.

Composer and actor Max Morath found it striking that the vast majority of Joplin&#x27;s work did not enjoy the popularity of the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot;, because while the compositions were of increasing lyrical beauty and delicate syncopation, they remained obscure and unheralded during his life. According to music historian Ian Whitcomb, Joplin apparently realized that his music was ahead of its time:

Just over thirty years later he was recognized, and later historian Rudi Blesh wrote a large book about ragtime, which he dedicated to the memory of Joplin.

Although he was penniless and disappointed at the end of his life, Joplin set the standard for ragtime compositions and played a key role in the development of ragtime music. While ragtime&#x27;s popularity faded around then, New Orleans jazz, stride, and novelty piano subsequently adopted many of its traits. And as a pioneer composer and performer, he helped pave the way for young black artists to reach American audiences of all races. After his death, jazz historian Floyd Levin noted: &quot;Those few who realized his greatness bowed their heads in sorrow. This was the passing of the king of all ragtime writers, the man who gave America a genuine native music.&quot; 

==Revival==
Recordings of Joplin compositions were released by Tommy Dorsey in 1936, Jelly Roll Morton in 1939, and J. Russel Robinson in 1947. &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; was the Joplin piece found most often on 78 rpm records.

In the 1960s, a small-scale reawakening of interest in classical ragtime was underway among some American music scholars, such as Trebor Tichenor, William Bolcom, William Albright, and Rudi Blesh. Audiophile Records released a two-record set, &quot;The Complete Piano Works of Scott Joplin, The Greatest of Ragtime Composers&quot;, performed by Knocky Parker, in 1970.

In 1968, Bolcom and Albright interested Joshua Rifkin, a young musicologist, in the body of Joplin&#x27;s work. Together, they hosted an occasional ragtime-and-early-jazz evening on WBAI radio. In November 1970, Rifkin released a recording called &quot;Scott Joplin: Piano Rags&quot; on the classical label Nonesuch. It sold 100,000 copies in its first year and eventually became Nonesuch&#x27;s first million-selling record. The &quot;Billboard&quot; Best-Selling Classical LPs chart for September 28, 1974, has the record at number 5, with the follow-up &quot;Volume 2&quot; at number 4, and a combined set of both volumes at number 3. Separately, both volumes had been on the chart for 64 weeks. In the top seven spots on that chart, six of the entries were recordings of Joplin&#x27;s work, three of which were Rifkin&#x27;s. Record stores found themselves for the first time putting ragtime in the classical music section. The album was nominated in 1971 for two Grammy Award categories: Best Album Notes and Best Instrumental Soloist Performance (without orchestra). Rifkin was also under consideration for a third Grammy for a recording not related to Joplin, but at the ceremony on March 14, 1972, Rifkin did not win in any category. He did a tour in 1974, which included appearances on BBC Television and a sell-out concert at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall. In 1979, Alan Rich wrote in the magazine &quot;New York&quot; that by giving artists like Rifkin the opportunity to put Joplin&#x27;s music on disc, Nonesuch Records &quot;created, almost alone, the Scott Joplin revival.&quot;

In January 1971, Harold C. Schonberg, music critic at &quot;The New York Times&quot;, having just heard the Rifkin album, wrote a featured Sunday edition article titled &quot;Scholars, Get Busy on Scott Joplin!&quot; Schonberg&#x27;s call to action has been described as the catalyst for classical music scholars, the sort of people Joplin had battled all his life, to conclude that Joplin was a genius. Vera Brodsky Lawrence of the New York Public Library published a two-volume set of Joplin works in June 1971, titled &quot;The Collected Works of Scott Joplin&quot;, stimulating a wider interest in the performance of Joplin&#x27;s music.

In mid-February 1973 under the direction of Gunther Schuller, the New England Conservatory Ragtime Ensemble recorded an album of Joplin&#x27;s rags taken from the period collection &quot;Standard High-Class Rags&quot; titled &quot;Joplin: The Red Back Book&quot;. The album won a Grammy Award as Best Chamber Music Performance in that year and became &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Top Classical Album of 1974. The group subsequently recorded two more albums for Golden Crest Records: &quot;More Scott Joplin Rags&quot; in 1974 and &quot;The Road From Rags To Jazz&quot; in 1975.
In 1973, film producer George Roy Hill contacted Schuller and Rifkin separately, asking both men to write the score for a film project he was working on: &quot;The Sting&quot;. Both men turned down the request because of previous commitments. Instead, Hill found Marvin Hamlisch available and brought him into the project as composer. Hamlisch lightly adapted Joplin&#x27;s music for &quot;The Sting&quot;, for which he won an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and Adaptation on April 2, 1974. His version of &quot;The Entertainer&quot; reached number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and the American Top 40 music chart on May 18, 1974, prompting &quot;The New York Times&quot; to write, &quot;The whole nation has begun to take notice.&quot; Because of the film and its score, Joplin&#x27;s work became appreciated in both the popular and classical music world, becoming (in the words of music magazine &quot;Record World&quot;) the &quot;classical phenomenon of the decade.&quot; Rifkin later said of the film soundtrack that Hamlisch lifted his piano adaptations directly from Rifkin&#x27;s style and his band adaptations from Schuller&#x27;s style. Schuller said Hamlisch &quot;got the Oscar for music he didn&#x27;t write (since it is by Joplin) and arrangements he didn&#x27;t write, and &#x27;editions&#x27; he didn&#x27;t make. A lot of people were upset by that, but that&#x27;s show biz!&quot;

On October 22, 1971, excerpts from &quot;Treemonisha&quot; were presented in concert form at Lincoln Center, with musical performances by Bolcom, Rifkin and Mary Lou Williams supporting a group of singers. Finally, on January 28, 1972, T.J. Anderson&#x27;s orchestration of &quot;Treemonisha&quot; was staged for two consecutive nights, sponsored by the Afro-American Music Workshop of Morehouse College in Atlanta, with singers accompanied by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Robert Shaw, and choreography by Katherine Dunham. Schonberg remarked in February 1972 that the &quot;Scott Joplin Renaissance&quot; was in full swing and still growing. In May 1975, &quot;Treemonisha&quot; was staged in a full opera production by the Houston Grand Opera. The company toured briefly, then settled into an eight-week run in New York on Broadway at the Palace Theatre in October and November. This appearance was directed by Gunther Schuller, and soprano Carmen Balthrop alternated with Kathleen Battle as the title character. An &quot;original Broadway cast&quot; recording was produced. Because of the lack of national exposure given to the brief Morehouse College staging of the opera in 1972, many Joplin scholars wrote that the Houston Grand Opera&#x27;s 1975 show was the first full production.

1974 saw the Birmingham Royal Ballet under director Kenneth MacMillan create &quot;Elite Syncopations&quot;, a ballet based on tunes by Joplin and other composers of the era. That year also brought the premiere by the Los Angeles Ballet of &quot;Red Back Book&quot;, choreographed by John Clifford to Joplin rags from the collection of the same name, including both solo piano performances and arrangements for full orchestra.

Copyright attorney Alvin Deutsch worked with Vera Brodsky Lawrence to make sure the Joplin estate owned the rights to his work. Deutsch negotiated with New York Public Library to get Treemonisha copyright and got the Joplin estate $60,000 in the 1970s when someone infringed on that copyright. Their work helped to mount the show &quot;Treemonisha&quot; via Dramatic Publishing.

==Museum==
The home Joplin rented in St. Louis from 1900 to 1903 was recognized as a National Historic Landmark in 1976 and was saved from destruction by the local African American community. In 1983, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources made it the first state historic site in Missouri dedicated to African American heritage. At first it focused entirely on Joplin and ragtime music, ignoring the urban milieu which shaped his musical compositions. A newer heritage project has expanded coverage to include the more complex social history of black urban migration and the transformation of a multi-ethnic neighborhood to the contemporary community. Part of this diverse narrative now includes coverage of uncomfortable topics of racial oppression, poverty, sanitation, prostitution, and sexually transmitted diseases.

<doc id="29605" wikidata="Q319526" url="?curid=29605" title="Syncopation">
<text>In music, syncopation is a variety of rhythms played together to make a piece of music, making part or all of a tune or piece of music off-beat. More simply, syncopation is &quot;a disturbance or interruption of the regular flow of rhythm&quot;: a &quot;placement of rhythmic stresses or accents where they wouldn&#x27;t normally occur&quot;. It is the correlation of at least two sets of time intervals.

Syncopation is used in many musical styles, such as electronic dance music. According to music producer Rick Snoman, “All dance music makes use of syncopation, and it’s often a vital element that helps tie the whole track together”.

Syncopation can also occur when a strong harmony is simultaneous with a weak beat, for instance, when a 7th-chord is played on the second beat of a measure or a dominant chord is played at the fourth beat of a measure. The latter occurs frequently in tonal cadences for 18th- and early-19th-century music and is the usual conclusion of any section.

A hemiola (the equivalent Latin term is sesquialtera) can also be considered as one straight measure in three with one long chord and one short chord and a syncope in the measure thereafter, with one short chord and one long chord. Usually, the last chord in a hemiola is a (bi-)dominant, and as such a strong harmony on a weak beat, hence a syncope.

==Types of syncopation==
Technically, &quot;syncopation occurs when a temporary displacement of the regular metrical accent occurs, causing the emphasis to shift from a strong accent to a weak accent&quot;. &quot;Syncopation is very simply, a deliberate disruption of the two- or three-beat stress pattern, most often by stressing an off-beat, or a note that is not on the beat.&quot;

===Suspension===
For the following example, there are two points of syncopation where the third beats are sustained from the second beats. In the same way, the first beat of the second bar is sustained from the fourth beat of the first bar.

Though syncopation may be very complex, dense or complex-looking rhythms often contain no syncopation. The following rhythm, though dense, stresses the regular downbeats, 1 and 4 (in ):

However, whether it is a placed rest or an accented note, any point in a piece of music that changes the listener&#x27;s sense of the downbeat is a point of syncopation because it shifts where the strong and weak accents are built.

===Off-beat syncopation===
The stress can shift by less than a whole beat, so it occurs on an offbeat, as in the following example, where the stress in the first bar is shifted back by an eighth note (or quaver):

Note how in the sound bite, the piano&#x27;s notes do not happen at the same time as the drum beat that simply keeps a regular rhythm. In contrast, a standard-rhythm piece would have the notes occur &quot;on&quot; the beat:

Playing a note ever so slightly before, or after, a beat is another form of syncopation because this produces an unexpected accent:

It can be helpful to think of a rhythm in eighth notes and count it as &quot;1-and-2-and-3-and-4-and&quot;. In general, emphasizing the &quot;and&quot; would be considered the off-beat (syncopated), whereas having the emphasis on the numbers is on-beat.

===Anticipated bass===
Anticipated bass is a bass tone that comes syncopated shortly before the downbeat, which is used in Son montuno Cuban dance music. Timing can vary, but it usually occurs on the 2+ and the 4 of the time, thus anticipating the third and first beats. This pattern is known commonly as the Afro-Cuban bass tumbao.

==Transformation==
Richard Middleton suggests adding the concept of transformation to Narmour&#x27;s prosodic rules which create rhythmic successions in order to explain or generate syncopations. &quot;The syncopated pattern is heard &#x27;with reference to&#x27;, &#x27;in light of&#x27;, as a remapping of, its partner.&quot; He gives examples of various types of syncopation: Latin, backbeat, and before-the-beat. First however, one may listen to the audio example of stress on the &quot;strong&quot; beats, where expected: 

===Latin equivalent of simple ===
In the example below, for the first two measures an unsyncopated rhythm is shown in the first measure. The third measure has a syncopated rhythm in which the first and fourth beat are provided as expected, but the accent occurs unexpectedly in between the second and third beats, creating a familiar &quot;Latin rhythm&quot; known as tresillo.

===Backbeat transformation of simple ===
The accent may be shifted from the first to the second beat in duple meter (and the third to fourth in quadruple), creating the backbeat rhythm:

Different crowds will &quot;clap along&quot; at concerts either on 1 and 3 or on 2 and 4, as above.

===&quot;Satisfaction&quot; example===
The phrasing of the Rolling Stones&#x27; song &quot;Satisfaction&quot; is a good example of syncopation. It is derived here from its theoretic unsyncopated form, a repeated trochee (¯ ˘ ¯ ˘). A backbeat transformation is applied to &quot;I&quot; and &quot;can&#x27;t&quot;, and then a before-the-beat transformation is applied to &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;no&quot;.

 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp;
 Repeated trochee: ¯ ˘ ¯ ˘
 I can&#x27;t get no – o
 Backbeat trans.: ¯ ˘ ¯ ˘
 I can&#x27;t get no – o
 Before-the-beat: ¯ ˘ ¯ ˘
 I can&#x27;t get no – o
This demonstrates how each syncopated pattern may be heard as a remapping, &quot;with reference to&quot; or &quot;in light of&quot;, an unsyncopated pattern.

==History==
Syncopation has been an important element of European musical composition since at least the Middle Ages. Many Italian and French compositions of the music of the 14th-century Trecento use syncopation, as in of the following madrigal by Giovanni da Firenze. (See also hocket.)

The refrain &quot;Deo Gratias&quot; from the 15th-century anonymous English &quot;Agincourt Carol&quot; is also characterised by lively syncopation:
According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, &quot;[t]he 15th-century carol repertory is one of the most substantial monuments of English medieval music... The early carols are rhythmically straightforward, in modern time; later the basic rhythm is in , with many cross-rhythms... as in the famous Agincourt carol &#x27;Deo gratias Anglia&#x27;. As in other music of the period, the emphasis is not on harmony, but on melody and rhythm.&quot;

Composers of the musical High Renaissance Venetian School, such as Giovanni Gabrieli (1557–1612), exploited syncopation for both their secular madrigals and instrumental pieces and also in their choral sacred works, such as the motet &quot;Domine, Dominus noster&quot;:
Denis Arnold says: &quot;the syncopations of this passage are of a kind which is almost a Gabrieli fingerprint, and they are typical of a general liveliness of rhythm common to Venetian music&quot;. The composer Igor Stravinsky, no stranger to syncopation himself, spoke of &quot;those marvellous rhythmic inventions&quot; that feature in Gabrieli&#x27;s music.

J. S. Bach and George Handel used syncopated rhythms as an inherent part of their compositions. One of the best-known examples of syncopation in music from the Baroque era was the &quot;Hornpipe&quot; from Handel&#x27;s &quot;Water Music&quot; (1733).
Christopher Hogwood (2005, p. 37) describes the Hornpipe as “possibly the most memorable movement in the collection, combining instrumental brilliance and rhythmic vitality… Woven amongst the running quavers are the insistent off-beat syncopations that symbolise confidence for Handel.” Bach&#x27;s Brandenburg Concerto No. 4 features striking deviations from the established rhythmic norm in its first and third movements. According to Malcolm Boyd, each ritornello section of the first movement, &quot;is clinched with an &quot;Epilog&quot; of syncopated antiphony&quot;:
Boyd also hears the coda to the third movement as &quot;remarkable... for the way the rhythm of the initial phrase of the fugue subject is expressed... with the accent thrown on to the second of the two minims (now staccato)&quot;:

Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert used syncopation to create variety especially in their symphonies. The beginning movement of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Eroica&quot; Symphony No. 3 exemplifies powerfully the uses of syncopation in a piece in triple time. After producing a pattern of three beats to a bar at the outset, Beethoven disrupts it through syncopation in a number of ways:

(1) By displacing the rhythmic emphasis to a weak part of the beat, as in the first violin part in bars 7–9:

Richard Taruskin describes here how &quot;the first violins, entering immediately after the C sharp, are made palpably to totter for two bars&quot;.

(2) By placing accents on normally weak beats, as in bars 25–26 and 28–35:
This &quot;long sequence of syncopated sforzandi&quot; recurs later during the development section of this movement, in a passage that Antony Hopkins describes as &quot;a rhythmic pattern that rides roughshod over the properties of a normal three-in-a bar&quot;.

(3) By inserting silences (rests) at points where a listener might expect strong beats, in the words of George Grove, &quot;nine bars of discords given fortissimo on the weak beats of the bar&quot;:

<doc id="29607" wikidata="Q185451" url="?curid=29607" title="Strategy">
<text>Strategy (from Greek στρατηγία &quot;stratēgia&quot;, &quot;troop leadership; office of general, command, generalship&quot;) is a general plan to achieve one or more long-term or overall goals under conditions of uncertainty. In the sense of the &quot;art of the general&quot;, which included several subsets of skills including military tactics, siegecraft, logistics etc., the term came into use in the 6th century C.E. in Eastern Roman terminology, and was translated into Western vernacular languages only in the 18th century. From then until the 20th century, the word &quot;strategy&quot; came to denote &quot;a comprehensive way to try to pursue political ends, including the threat or actual use of force, in a dialectic of wills&quot; in a military conflict, in which both adversaries interact.

Strategy is important because the resources available to achieve goals are usually limited. Strategy generally involves setting goals and priorities, determining actions to achieve the goals, and mobilizing resources to execute the actions. A strategy describes how the ends (goals) will be achieved by the means (resources). Strategy can be intended or can emerge as a pattern of activity as the organization adapts to its environment or competes. It involves activities such as strategic planning and strategic thinking.

Henry Mintzberg from McGill University defined strategy as a pattern in a stream of decisions to contrast with a view of strategy as planning. while Max McKeown (2011) argues that &quot;strategy is about shaping the future&quot; and is the human attempt to get to &quot;desirable ends with available means&quot;. Vladimir Kvint defines strategy as &quot;a system of finding, formulating, and developing a doctrine that will ensure long-term success if followed faithfully.&quot; 

==Military theory==

In military theory, strategy is &quot;the utilization during both peace and war, of all of the nation&#x27;s forces, through large scale, long-range planning and development, to ensure security and victory&quot; (&quot;Random House Dictionary&quot;).

The father of Western modern strategic study, Carl von Clausewitz, defined military strategy as &quot;the employment of battles to gain the end of war.&quot; B. H. Liddell Hart&#x27;s definition put less emphasis on battles, defining strategy as &quot;the art of distributing and applying military means to fulfill the ends of policy&quot;. Hence, both gave the pre-eminence to political aims over military goals. U.S. Naval War College instructor Andrew Wilson defined strategy as the &quot;process by which political purpose is translated into military action.&quot; Lawrence Freedman defined strategy as the &quot;art of creating power.&quot;

Eastern military philosophy dates back much further, with examples such as &quot;The Art of War&quot; by Sun Tzu dated around 500 B.C.

=== Counterterrorism Strategy ===
Because counterterrorism involves the synchronized efforts of numerous competing bureaucratic entities, national governments frequently create overarching counterterrorism strategies at the national level. A national counterterrorism strategy is a government&#x27;s plan to use the instruments of national power to neutralize terrorists, their organizations, and their networks in order to render them incapable of using violence to instill fear and to coerce the government or its citizens to react in accordance with the terrorists&#x27; goals. The United States has had several such strategies in the past, including the &quot;United States National Strategy for Counterterrorism&quot; (2018); the Obama-era &quot;National Strategy for Counterterrorism&quot; (2011); and the &quot;National Strategy for Combatting Terrorism&quot; (2003). There have also been a number of ancillary or supporting plans, such as the 2014 &quot;Strategy to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant&quot;, and the 2016 &quot;Strategic Implementation Plan for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States&quot;. Similarly, the United Kingdom&#x27;s counterterrorism strategy, CONTEST, seeks &quot;to reduce the risk to the UK and its citizens and interests overseas from terrorism so that people can go about their lives freely and with confidence.&quot;

==Management theory==

Modern business strategy emerged as a field of study and practice in the 1960s; prior to that time, the words &quot;strategy&quot; and &quot;competition&quot; rarely appeared in the most prominent management literature.
Alfred Chandler wrote in 1962 that: &quot;Strategy is the determination of the basic long-term goals of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses of action and the allocation of resources necessary for carrying out these goals.&quot; Michael Porter defined strategy in 1980 as the &quot;...broad formula for how a business is going to compete, what its goals should be, and what policies will be needed to carry out those goals&quot; and the &quot;...combination of the &quot;ends&quot; (goals) for which the firm is striving and the &quot;means&quot; (policies) by which it is seeking to get there.&quot;

===Definition===

Henry Mintzberg described five definitions of strategy in 1998:
* Strategy as plan – a directed course of action to achieve an &quot;intended&quot; set of goals; similar to the strategic planning concept;
* Strategy as pattern – a consistent pattern of past behavior, with a strategy &quot;realized&quot; over time rather than planned or &quot;intended&quot;. Where the realized pattern was different from the intent, he referred to the strategy as &quot;emergent&quot;;
* Strategy as position – locating brands, products, or companies within the market, based on the conceptual framework of consumers or other stakeholders; a strategy determined primarily by factors outside the firm;
* Strategy as ploy – a specific maneuver intended to outwit a competitor; and
* Strategy as perspective – executing strategy based on a &quot;theory of the business&quot; or natural extension of the mindset or ideological perspective of the organization.

Complexity theorists define strategy as the unfolding of the internal and external aspects of the organization that results in actions in a socio-economic context.

===Strategic Problem===

In 1998, Crouch defined the strategic problem as maintaining flexible relationships that can range from intense competition to harmonious cooperation among different players in a dynamic market. While Crouch was open to the idea of cooperation between players, his approach still emphasized that strategy is shaped by market conditions and organizational structure. This view aligns with the definitions of strategy proposed by Porter and Mintzberg.

In contrast, Burnett regards strategy as a plan formulated through methodology in which strategic problem encompasses six tasks: goal formulation, environmental analysis, strategy formulation, strategy evaluation, strategy implementation, and strategy control.

The literature identifies two main sources for defining a strategic problem. The first is related to environmental factors, and the second focuses on the organizational context (Mukherji and Hurtado, 2001). These two sources summarize three dimensions originally proposed by Ansoff and Hayes (1981). According to them, a strategic problem arises from analysis of internal and external issues, the processes to solve them, and the variables involved.

In Terra and Passador&#x27;s view, organizations and the systems around them are tightly connected, so they rely on each other to survive. This means a strategy should balance being proactive and reactive. This involvers recognizing the organization’s impact on the environment and acting to minimize harm while adapting to new demands. The strategy should also align internal and external aspects of the organization and include all related entities. This helps build a complex socio-economic system where the organization is part of a sustainable ecosystem.

===Complexity theory===

Complexity science, as articulated by R. D. Stacey, represents a conceptual framework capable of harmonizing emergent and deliberate strategies. Within complexity approaches, the term &quot;strategy&quot; is intricately linked to action but contrasts programmed action. Complexity theorists view programs merely as predetermined sequences effective in highly ordered and less chaotic environments. Conversely, strategy emerges from a simultaneous examination of determined conditions (order) and uncertainties (disorder) that drive action. Complexity theory posits that strategy involves execution, encompasses control and emergence, scrutinizes both internal and external organizational aspects, and can take the form of maneuvers or any other act or process.

The works of Stacey stand as pioneering efforts in applying complexity principles to the field of strategy. This author applied self-organization and chaos principles to describe strategy, organizational change dynamics, and learning. Their propositions advocate for strategy approached through choices and the evolutionary process of competitive selection. In this context, corrections of anomalies occur through actions involving negative feedback, while innovation and continuous change stem from actions guided by positive feedback.

Dynamically, complexity in strategic management can be elucidated through the model of &quot;Symbiotic Dynamics&quot; by Terra and Passador. This model conceives the social organization of production as an interplay between two distinct systems existing in a symbiotic relationship while interconnected with the external environment. The organization&#x27;s social network acts as a self-referential entity controlling the organization&#x27;s life, while its technical structure resembles a purposeful &quot;machine&quot; supplying the social system by processing resources. These intertwined structures exchange disturbances and residues while interacting with the external world through their openness. Essentially, as the organization produces itself, it also hetero-produces, surviving through energy and resource flows across its subsystems.

This dynamic has strategic implications, governing organizational dynamics through a set of attraction basins establishing operational and regenerative capabilities. Hence, one of the primary roles of strategists is to identify &quot;human attractors&quot; and assess their impacts on organizational dynamics. According to the theory of Symbiotic Dynamics, both leaders and the technical system can act as attractors, directly influencing organizational dynamics and responses to external disruptions. Terra and Passador further assert that while producing, organizations contribute to environmental entropy, potentially leading to abrupt ruptures and collapses within their subsystems, even within the organizations themselves. Given this issue, the authors conclude that organizations intervening to maintain the environment&#x27;s stability within suitable parameters for survival tend to exhibit greater longevity.

The theory of Symbiotic Dynamics posits that organizations must acknowledge their impact on the external environment (markets, society, and the environment) and act systematically to reduce their degradation while adapting to the demands arising from these interactions. To achieve this, organizations need to incorporate all interconnected systems into their decision-making processes, enabling the envisioning of complex socio-economic systems where they integrate in a stable and sustainable manner. This blend of proactivity and reactivity is fundamental to ensuring the survival of the organization itself.

===Components===
Professor Richard P. Rumelt described strategy as a type of problem solving in 2011. He wrote that good strategy has an underlying structure he called a &quot;kernel&quot;. The kernel has three parts: 1) A &quot;diagnosis&quot; that defines or explains the nature of the challenge; 2) A &quot;guiding policy&quot; for dealing with the challenge; and 3) Coherent &quot;actions&quot; designed to carry out the guiding policy.
President Kennedy illustrated these three elements of strategy in his Cuban Missile Crisis Address to the Nation of 22 October 1962:
# Diagnosis: &quot;This Government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet military buildup on the island of Cuba. Within the past week, unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites are now in preparation on that imprisoned island. The purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the Western Hemisphere.&quot;
# Guiding Policy: &quot;Our unswerving objective, therefore, must be to prevent the use of these missiles against this or any other country, and to secure their withdrawal or elimination from the Western Hemisphere.&quot;
# Action Plans: First among seven numbered steps was the following: &quot;To halt this offensive buildup a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any kind bound for Cuba from whatever nation or port will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back.&quot;

Rumelt wrote in 2011 that three important aspects of strategy include &quot;premeditation, the anticipation of others&#x27; behavior, and the purposeful design of coordinated actions.&quot; He described strategy as solving a design problem, with trade-offs among various elements that must be arranged, adjusted and coordinated, rather than a plan or choice.

===Formulation and implementation===
Strategy typically involves two major processes: &quot;formulation&quot; and &quot;implementation&quot;. &quot;Formulation&quot; involves analyzing the environment or situation, making a diagnosis, and developing guiding policies. It includes such activities as strategic planning and strategic thinking. &quot;Implementation&quot; refers to the action plans taken to achieve the goals established by the guiding policy.

Bruce Henderson wrote in 1981 that: &quot;Strategy depends upon the ability to foresee future consequences of present initiatives.&quot; He wrote that the basic requirements for strategy development include, among other factors: 1) extensive knowledge about the environment, market and competitors;
2) ability to examine this knowledge as an interactive dynamic system; and
3) the imagination and logic to choose between specific alternatives. Henderson wrote that strategy was valuable because of: &quot;finite resources, uncertainty about an adversary&#x27;s capability and intentions; the irreversible commitment of resources; necessity of coordinating action over time and distance; uncertainty about control of the initiative; and the nature of adversaries&#x27; mutual perceptions of each other.&quot;

==Game theory==

In game theory, a player&#x27;s strategy is any of the options that the player would choose in a specific setting. Any optimal outcomes they receive depend not only on their actions but also, the actions of other players.

<doc id="29608" wikidata="Q3050406" url="?curid=29608" title="Saeed al-Ghamdi">
<text>Saeed Abdullah Ali Sulayman al-Ghamdi (; 21 November 1979 11 September 2001) was a Saudi terrorist hijacker. He was one of four terrorist hijackers of United Airlines Flight 93 as part of the 11 September attacks. Despite his name, he was not related to the brothers Hamza al-Ghamdi or Ahmed al-Ghamdi who were part of the team that hijacked United Airlines Flight 175.

Born in Saudi Arabia, al-Ghamdi left his home to fight in Chechnya after dropping out of college, but was reported to have diverted to Afghanistan to train in an al-Qaeda camp. It was reported he was chosen by Osama bin Laden to participate in terrorist attacks in the United States and arrived in the U.S. in June 2001. During his stay in the U.S., he quietly settled in Florida, planning out how the attacks would commence and training on flight simulators.

On 11 September 2001, he boarded United 93 and assisted in the hijacking of the plane, which was diverted toward Washington D.C. under the control of lead hijacker and trained pilot Ziad Jarrah so that Jarrah could crash the plane into the U.S. Capitol as part of the coordinated attacks. The plane instead crashed into a field in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, after the passengers attempted to retake control of the plane in an uprising.

==Early life and education==
Saeed al-Ghamdi was from the al-Bahah Province of Saudi Arabia, and shared the same tribal affiliation with fellow hijackers Ahmed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, and Ahmed al-Haznawi, although he was not related to either al-Ghamdi. He may have been in contact with the two al-Ghamdi&#x27;s and al-Haznawi as early as 1999. This group is noted as being some of the more religiously observant of the hijackers. al-Ghamdi spent time in al Qasim province, Saudi Arabia where he transferred to college but soon dropped out and ceased contact with his family. While there he probably associated with the radical Saudi cleric named Sulayman al-Alwan as several other future hijackers had.

Al-Ghamdi later headed to Chechnya to participate in the conflict against the Russians. At this time, Chechen fighters were turning away additional foreigners, many of whom ended up in al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan to train and await entry to Chechnya. Saeed ended up at the Al Farouq training camp, where he met Ahmed al-Nami, and the brothers Wail and Waleed al-Shehri. The four reportedly pledged themselves to Jihad in the Spring of 2000, in a ceremony presided over by Wail Al-Shehri—who had dubbed himself &quot;Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi&quot; after one of Muhammad&#x27;s companions.

Saeed Al-Ghamdi was known to Tawfiq bin Attash who is thought to have convinced him to become a martyr. Al-Ghamdi was at that time working as a security guard at Kandahar airport along with Waleed al-Shehri.

Some time late in 2000, al-Ghamdi traveled to the United Arab Emirates, where he purchased traveler&#x27;s cheques presumed to have been paid for by Mustafa al-Hawsawi. Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased travellers cheques, including Majed Moqed, Wail al-Shehri, Hamza al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi and Ahmed al-Nami.

On 13 November 2000, another Saeed al-Ghamdi tried to obtain a visa to enter the United States, but was declined. Although the 9/11 Commission makes mention of him, there is no evidence he was associated with the hijackers.

In March 2001, al-Ghamdi was filmed in a farewell video that was later aired on al-Jazeera. In the video, many future 9/11 hijackers swear to become martyrs, although no details of the plot are revealed. al-Ghamdi referred to America as &quot;the enemy&quot;, and is seen studying maps and flight manuals.

==In the United States==

On 12 June 2001, Saeed al-Ghamdi applied for and received a second two-year US B-1/B-2 (tourist/business) visa in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. His application was submitted by a local travel agency and processed through Visa Express, a controversial US visa program in Saudi Arabia which was discontinued the following year.

Arriving in the U.S. on 27 June 2001, with Fayez Banihammad, Saeed shared an apartment with Ahmed al-Nami in Delray Beach, Florida. Oddly, he listed the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida, as his permanent address on his driver&#x27;s license. He was one of 9 hijackers to open a SunTrust bank account with a cash deposit around June 2001.

According to al-Jazeera reporter Yosri Fouda&#x27;s documentary &quot;Top Secret: The Road to September 11&quot;, three weeks prior to the attacks, Saeed is believed to have used the name &#x27;Abdul Rahman&#x27; to send a message to Ramzi bin al-Shibh (who was posing as a girlfriend) online, in which he wrote

On 7 September, all four Flight 93 hijackers flew from Fort Lauderdale to Newark International Airport aboard Spirit Airlines.

==Attacks==

On the morning of 11 September 2001, al-Ghamdi boarded United Airlines Flight 93 without incident. Due to the flight&#x27;s delay, the pilot and crew were notified of the previous hijackings that day, and were told to be on the alert. Within minutes, Flight 93 was hijacked as well.

At least two of the cell phone calls made by passengers indicate that the hijackers were wearing red bandanas. The calls also indicated that one had tied a box around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside.

The flight transcript suggests that three hijackers were in the cockpit. Ziad Jarrah was identified as the pilot and is heard calling the other hijacker &quot;Saeed&quot;, indicating that al-Ghamdi, who also trained in flight simulators, was helping Jarrah with the controls.

Passengers on the plane heard through phone calls the fates of the other hijacked planes. A passenger uprising resulted in the plane crashing into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing everyone aboard.

==Mistaken identity allegations==
On 23 September 2001, before the FBI had released the pictures of the hijackers, the BBC and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that a Saudi Airlines pilot named Saeed al-Ghamdi was furious that a name on the hijacker&#x27;s list released by the FBI matched his own. CNN also showed a picture of the &quot;living&quot; al-Ghamdi as the hijacker. The man claimed CNN likely got his picture from a Flight Safety flying school in Florida he attended. &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; later investigated the claims of &quot;living&quot; hijackers by the BBC and discovered them to be cases of mistaken identity.

In June 2005 the Saudi government released a list (see al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) of 36 wanted (and alive) terrorists, one of whom was Salih Saeed Al Batih al-Ghamdi. 9/11 conspiracy theorists quickly confused him with the hijacker Saeed al-Ghamdi.

== In popular culture ==
*He has been portrayed by Iraqi actor Lewis Alsamari in &quot;United 93&quot; and Canadian actor Shawn Ahmed in &quot;Flight 93&quot;.
*Television film &quot;The Flight That Fought Back&quot; (2005) portrays the passenger uprising inside the hijacked United Airlines 93, with Indian actor Ankur Bhatt portraying Saeed al-Ghamdi.

<doc id="29612" wikidata="Q172904" url="?curid=29612" title="Syncretism">
<text>Syncretism () is the practice of combining different beliefs and various schools of thought. Syncretism involves the merging or assimilation of several originally discrete traditions, especially in the theology and mythology of religion, thus asserting an underlying unity and allowing for an inclusive approach to other faiths. While syncretism in art and culture is sometimes likened to eclecticism, in the realm of religion, it specifically denotes a more integrated merging of beliefs into a unified system, distinct from eclecticism, which implies a selective adoption of elements from different traditions without necessarily blending them into a new, cohesive belief system.

The English word is first attested in the early 17th century. It is from Modern Latin , drawing on the (), supposedly meaning &quot;Cretan federation.&quot; However, this is a spurious etymology derived from the naive idea in Plutarch&#x27;s 1st-century AD essay on &quot;Fraternal Love (Peri Philadelphias)&quot; in his collection &quot;Moralia&quot;. He cites the example of the Cretans, who compromised and reconciled their differences and came together in alliance when faced with external dangers. &quot;And that is their so-called &quot;Syncretism&quot; [Union of Cretans].&quot; A more likely etymology is from &quot;sun-&quot; (&quot;with&quot;) plus &quot;kerannumi&quot; (&quot;mix&quot;) and its related noun, &quot;krasis&quot; (&quot;mixture&quot;).

== Social and political roles ==

Overt syncretism in folk belief may show cultural acceptance of an alien or previous tradition, but the &quot;other&quot; cult may survive or infiltrate without authorized &quot;syncresis&quot;. For example, some conversos developed a sort of cult for martyr-victims of the Spanish Inquisition, thus incorporating elements of Catholicism while resisting it.

The Kushite kings who ruled Upper Egypt for approximately a century and the whole of Egypt for approximately 57 years, from 721 to 664 BCE, constituting the Twenty-fifth Dynasty in Manetho&#x27;s &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;, developed a syncretic worship identifying their own god Dedun with the Egyptian Osiris. They maintained that worship even after they had been driven out of Egypt. A temple dedicated to this syncretic god, built by the Kushite ruler Atlanersa, was unearthed at Jebel Barkal.

Syncretism was common during the Hellenistic period, with rulers regularly identifying local deities in various parts of their domains with the relevant god or goddess of the Greek Pantheon as a means of increasing the cohesion of their kingdom. This practice was accepted in most locations but vehemently rejected by the Jews, who considered the identification of Yahweh with the Greek Zeus as the worst of blasphemy.

The Roman Empire continued the practice, first by the identification of traditional Roman deities with Greek ones, producing a single Greco-Roman pantheon, and then identifying members of that pantheon with the local deities of various Roman provinces. 

Some religious movements have embraced overt syncretism, such as the case of melding Shintō beliefs into Buddhism or the amalgamation of Germanic and Celtic pagan views into Christianity during its spread into Gaul, Ireland, Britain, Germany and Scandinavia. In later times, Christian missionaries in North America identified Manitou, the spiritual and fundamental life force in the traditional beliefs of the Algonquian groups, with the God of Christianity. Similar identifications were made by missionaries at other locations in the Americas and Africa who encountered a local belief in a Supreme God or Supreme Spirit of some kind. 

Indian influences are seen in the practice of Shi&#x27;i Islam in Trinidad. Others have strongly rejected it as devaluing and compromising precious and genuine distinctions; examples include post-Exile Second Temple Judaism, Islam, and most of Protestant Christianity.

Syncretism tends to facilitate coexistence and unity between otherwise different cultures and world views (intercultural competence), a factor that has recommended it to rulers of multiethnic realms. Conversely, the rejection of syncretism, usually in the name of &quot;piety&quot; and &quot;orthodoxy&quot;, may help to generate, bolster or authenticate a sense of uncompromised cultural unity in a well-defined minority or majority.

All major religious conversions of populations have had elements from prior religious traditions incorporated into legends or doctrine that endure with the newly converted laity.

== Religious syncretism ==


Religious syncretism is the blending of two or more religious belief systems into a new system, or the incorporation into a religious tradition of beliefs from unrelated traditions. This can occur for many reasons, and the latter scenario happens quite commonly in areas where multiple religious traditions exist in proximity and function actively in a culture, or when a culture is conquered, and the conquerors bring their religious beliefs with them, but do not succeed in entirely eradicating the old beliefs or (especially) practices.

Religions may have syncretic elements to their beliefs or history, but adherents of so-labeled systems often frown on applying the label, especially adherents who belong to &quot;revealed&quot; religious systems, such as the Abrahamic religions, or any system that exhibits an exclusivist approach. Such adherents sometimes see syncretism as a betrayal of their pure truth. By this reasoning, adding an incompatible belief corrupts the original religion, rendering it no longer true. Indeed, critics of a syncretistic trend may use the word or its variants as a disparaging epithet, as a charge implying that those who seek to incorporate a new view, belief, or practice into a religious system pervert the original faith. Non-exclusivist systems of belief, on the other hand, may feel quite free to incorporate other traditions into their own. Keith Ferdinando notes that the term &quot;syncretism&quot; is an elusive one, and can refer to substitution or modification of the central elements of a religion by beliefs or practices introduced from elsewhere. The consequence under such a definition, according to Ferdinando, can lead to a fatal &quot;compromise&quot; of the original religion&#x27;s &quot;integrity&quot;.

In modern secular society, religious innovators sometimes construct new faiths or key tenets syncretically, with the added benefit or aim of reducing inter-religious discord. Such chapters often have a side-effect of arousing jealousy and suspicion among authorities and ardent adherents of the pre-existing religion. Such religions tend to inherently appeal to an inclusive, diverse audience. Sometimes the state itself sponsored such new movements, such as the Living Church founded in Soviet Russia and the German Evangelical Church in Nazi Germany, chiefly to stem all outside influences.

== Cultures and societies ==

According to some authors, &quot;Syncretism is often used to describe the product of the large-scale imposition of one alien culture, religion, or body of practices over another that is already present.&quot; Others such as Jerry H. Bentley, however, have argued that syncretism has also helped to create cultural compromise. It provides an opportunity to bring beliefs, values, and customs from one cultural tradition into contact with, and to engage different cultural traditions. Such a migration of ideas is generally successful only when there is a resonance between both traditions. While, as Bentley has argued, there are numerous cases where expansive traditions have won popular support in foreign lands, this is not always so.

===Din-i Ilahi===
In the 16th century, the Mughal emperor Akbar proposed a new religion called the Din-i Ilahi (&quot;Divine Faith&quot;). Sources disagree with respect to whether it was one of many Sufi orders or merged some of the elements of the various religions of his empire. Din-i Ilahi drew elements primarily from Islam and Hinduism but also from Christianity, Jainism, and Zoroastrianism. More resembling a personality cult than a religion, it had no sacred scriptures, no priestly hierarchy, and fewer than 20 disciples, all hand-picked by Akbar himself. It is also accepted that the policy of &quot;sulh-i-kul&quot;, which formed the essence of the Dīn-i Ilāhī, was adopted by Akbar as a part of general imperial administrative policy. &quot;Sulh-i-kul&quot; means &quot;universal peace&quot;.

=== Enlightenment ===
The syncretic deism of Matthew Tindal undermined Christianity&#x27;s claim to uniqueness. The modern, rational, non-pejorative connotations of syncretism arguably date from Denis Diderot&#x27;s articles &quot;Eclecticisme&quot; and &quot;Syncrétistes, Hénotiques, ou Conciliateurs&quot;. Diderot portrayed syncretism as the concordance of eclectic sources. Scientific or legalistic approaches of subjecting all claims to critical thinking prompted at this time much literature in Europe and the Americas studying non-European religions such as Edward Moor&#x27;s &quot;The Hindu Pantheon&quot; of 1810, much of which was almost evangelistically appreciative by embracing spirituality and creating the space and tolerance in particular disestablishment of religion (or its stronger form, official secularisation as in France) whereby believers of spiritualism, agnosticism, atheists and in many cases more innovative or pre-Abrahimic based religions could promote and spread their belief system, whether in the family or beyond.

<text>The S7G reactor was a prototype naval reactor designed for the United States Navy to provide electricity generation and propulsion on warships. The S7G designation stands for:

* S = Submarine platform
* 7 = Seventh reactor designed by the contractor
* G = General Electric was the contracted designer

This prototype design was a land-based nuclear reactor that did not use control rods. It was tested in the late 1970s and early 1980s at the Modifications and Additions to a Reactor Facility (MARF) plant located at the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory&#x27;s Kesselring Site in Ballston Spa, New York. It consisted of an experimental reactor core installed in a modified S5W reactor plant.

==Design and operation==
Instead of the movable hafnium-based control rods used in all of the other United States Naval reactors, reactivity in the S7G core was controlled by stationary gadolinium-clad tubes partially filled with water. Water could be pumped from the portion of the tube inside the core up to a reservoir above the core, or allowed to flow back down into the tube. A higher water level in the tube slowed more neutrons in the core, causing more neutron capture by the gadolinium tube cladding rather than by the uranium fuel, thus lowering the power level.

The system was configured with the pump running continually to keep the water level low; on loss of electrical power, all of the water would flow back into the tube, shutting down the reactor. As with all small pressurized water reactors, the design also had the advantage of negative feedback: an increase in reactor power caused the water to expand, leading to reduced thermalization of neutrons and lowering absorption by the fuel, therefore lowering the power. Thus, changes in the average coolant temperature, notably from the steam demand of engine throttles, naturally maintains reactor power without intervention from a reactor operator.

The S7G reactor was never used on a ship. In the late 1980s the S7G core was replaced with the experimental DMC (Developmental Materials Core)</text><links>

<doc id="29617" wikidata="Q651641" url="?curid=29617" title="Subject–verb–object word order">
<text>In linguistic typology, subject–verb–object (SVO) is a sentence structure where the subject comes first, the verb second, and the object third. Languages may be classified according to the dominant sequence of these elements in unmarked sentences (i.e., sentences in which an unusual word order is not used for emphasis). English is included in this group. An example is &quot;Sam ate apples.&quot; 

SVO is the second-most common order by number of known languages, after SOV. Together, SVO and SOV account for more than 87% of the world&#x27;s languages.
The label SVO often includes ergative languages although they do not have nominative subjects.
== Properties ==
Subject–verb–object languages almost always place relative clauses after the nouns which they modify and adverbial subordinators before the clause modified, with varieties of Chinese being notable exceptions.

Although some subject–verb–object languages in West Africa, the best known being Ewe, use postpositions in noun phrases, the vast majority of them, such as English, have prepositions. Most subject–verb–object languages place genitives after the noun, but a significant minority, including the postpositional SVO languages of West Africa, the Hmong–Mien languages, some Sino-Tibetan languages, and European languages like Swedish, Danish, Lithuanian and Latvian have &quot;prenominal&quot; genitives (as would be expected in an SOV language).

Non-European SVO languages usually have a strong tendency to place adjectives, demonstratives and numerals after the nouns that they modify, but Chinese, Vietnamese, Malaysian and Indonesian place numerals before nouns, as in English. Some linguists have come to view the numeral as the head in the relationship to fit the rigid right-branching of these languages.

There is a strong tendency, as in English, for main verbs to be preceded by auxiliaries: &quot;I am thinking. He should reconsider.&quot;

== Language differences and variation ==

An example of SVO order in English is:
:&quot;Andy ate cereal.&quot;
In an analytic language such as English, subject–verb–object order is relatively inflexible because it identifies which part of the sentence is the subject and which one is the object. (&quot;The dog bit Andy&quot; and &quot;Andy bit the dog&quot; mean two completely different things, while, in case of &quot;Bit Andy the dog&quot;, it may be difficult to determine whether it is a complete sentence or a fragment, with &quot;Andy the dog&quot; the object and an omitted/implied subject.) 

The situation is more complex in languages that have no strict order of V and O imposed by their grammar. e.g. Russian, Finnish, Ukrainian, or Hungarian. Here, the ordering is rather governed by emphasis. 

Russian allows the use of subject, verb, and object in any order and &quot;shuffles&quot; parts to bring up a slightly different contextual meaning each time. E.g. &quot;любит она его&quot; (loves she him) may be used to point out &quot;she acts this way because she LOVES him&quot;, or &quot;его она любит&quot; (him she loves) is used in the context &quot;if you pay attention, you&#x27;ll see that HE is the one she truly loves&quot;, or &quot;его любит она&quot; (him loves she) may appear along the lines &quot;I agree that cat is a disaster, but since my wife adores it and I adore her...&quot;. Regardless of order, it is clear that &quot;его&quot; is the object because it is in the accusative case. 

In Polish, SVO order is basic in an affirmative sentence, and a different order is used to either emphasize some part of it or to adapt it to a broader context logic. For example, (I won&#x27;t buy you &quot;a bicycle&quot;), (I&#x27;ve been waiting &quot;since five&quot;).

In Turkish, it is normal to use SOV, but SVO may be used sometimes to emphasize the verb. For example, &quot;John terk etti Mary&#x27;yi&quot; (Lit. &quot;John/left/Mary&quot;: John left Mary) is the answer to the question &quot;What did John do with Mary?&quot; instead of the regular [SOV] sentence &quot;John Mary&#x27;yi terk etti&quot; (Lit. &quot;John/Mary/left&quot;).

German, Dutch, and Kashmiri display the order subject-verb-object in some, especially main clauses, but really are verb-second languages, not SVO languages in the sense of a word order type. They have SOV in subordinate clauses, as given in Example 1 below. Example 2 shows the effect of verb second order: the first element in the clause that comes before the V need not be the subject. In Kashmiri, the word order in embedded clauses is conditioned by the category of the subordinating conjunction, as in Example 3. 
# (German &amp; Dutch respectively: &quot;He knows that I wash the car each Sunday&quot;, lit. &quot;He knows that I each Sunday the car wash&quot;.) Cf. the simple sentence , &quot;I wash the car each Sunday.&quot;
#&quot;Jeden Sonntag wasche ich das Auto.&quot;/&quot;Elke zondag was ik de auto.&quot; (German &amp; Dutch respectively: &quot;Each Sunday I wash the car.&quot;, lit. &quot;Each Sunday wash I the car.&quot;). &quot;Ich wasche das Auto jeden Sonntag&quot;/&quot;Ik was de auto elke zondag&quot; translates perfectly into English &quot;I wash the car each Sunday&quot;, but preposing the adverbial results in a structure that is different from the English one.
#Kashmiri:

::If the embedded clause is introduced by the transparent conjunction &quot;zyi&quot; the SOV order changes to SVO. &quot;mye ees phyikyir (zyi) tsi maa dyikh temyis ciThy&quot;.

English developed from such a reordering language and still bears traces of this word order, for example in locative inversion (&quot;In the garden sat a cat.&quot;) and some clauses beginning with negative expressions: &quot;only&quot; (&quot;Only then do we find X.&quot;), &quot;not only&quot; (&quot;Not only did he storm away but also slammed the door.&quot;), &quot;under no circumstances&quot; (&quot;under no circumstances are the students allowed to use a mobile phone&quot;), &quot;never&quot; (&quot;Never have I done that.&quot;), &quot;on no account&quot; and the like. In such cases, &quot;do&quot;-support is sometimes required, depending on the construction.

<text>Skopje ( , ; ; , ) is the capital and largest city of North Macedonia. It is the country&#x27;s political, cultural, economic, and academic centre. Skopje lies in the Skopje Basin.

Scupi is attested for the first time in the second century AD as a city in Roman Dardania. When the Roman Empire was divided into eastern and western halves in AD 395, Scupi came under Byzantine rule from Constantinople. During much of the early medieval period, the town was contested between the Byzantines and the Bulgarian Empire, whose capital it was between 972 and 992. In 1004, when it was again seized by the Byzantine Empire, the city became a centre of a new province called Bulgaria. From 1282, the town was part of the Serbian Empire, of which it was the capital from 1346 to 1371.

In 1392, Skopje was conquered by the Ottoman Empire, who called it (). The town stayed under Ottoman control for over 500 years, serving as the capital of the pashasanjak of and later the Vilayet of Kosovo. Its central position in the Ottoman Balkans made it a significant centre of commerce and administration during the Ottoman era. In 1912, it was annexed by the Kingdom of Serbia during the Balkan Wars.

During World War I the city was seized by the Kingdom of Bulgaria, and, after the war, it became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Yugoslavia as the capital of Vardarska Banovina. In World War II, the city was again captured by Bulgaria and in 1945 became the capital of SR Macedonia, a federated state within Yugoslavia. The city developed rapidly, but this was interrupted in 1963 when it was hit by a disastrous earthquake.

Skopje is located on the upper course of the Vardar River and on a major north–south Balkan route between Belgrade and Athens. It is a centre for the chemical, timber, textile, leather, printing, and metal-processing industries. Industrial development of the city has been accompanied by development of the trade, logistics, and banking sectors, as well as an emphasis on the fields of transportation, culture and sport. According to the last official census from 2021, Skopje had a population of 526,502 inhabitants.

== Name ==

The city is attested for the first name in &quot;Geography&quot; by Ptolemy as one of the cities of Roman Dardania. Ptolemy describes the city in Latin as and ancient Greek as . The toponym likely belongs to a group of similar Illyrian toponyms which have been transmitted to Slavic languages in the same way as the modern Macedonian toponym &quot;Skopje&quot;: and in Bosnia, in Dalmatia (Croatia).

&#x27;, the name of the city in Albanian, developed directly from Roman-era &#x27; in agreement with the Albanian phonological development, the basis of evidence of an earlier Albanian settlement in the area. &#x27; is the definite form of &#x27; in Albanian. &quot;Skopje&quot;, the name of the city during the Middle Ages, is the local Slavic (Macedonian) rendition of &quot;Scupi&quot;. The Ottoman Turkish rendition of the city&#x27;s name is () and it was adapted in Western languages in &quot;Uskub&quot; or &quot;Uskup&quot;, and these two appellations were used in the Western world until 1912. Some Western sources also cite &quot;Scopia&quot; and &quot;Skopia&quot;. is the name of the city in Aromanian.

When Vardar Macedonia was annexed by the Kingdom of Serbia in 1912, the city officially became () and many languages adopted this name. To reflect local pronunciation, the city&#x27;s name was eventually spelled as () after the Second World War, when standard Macedonian became the official language of the new Socialist Republic of Macedonia.

== Geography ==

=== Topography ===

Skopje is in the north of the country, in the centre of the Balkan peninsula, and approximately halfway between Belgrade and Athens. The city was built in the Skopje Valley, oriented on a west–east axis, along the course of the Vardar river, which flows into the Aegean Sea in Greece. The valley is approximately wide and it is limited by several mountain ranges to the north and south. These ranges limit the urban expansion of Skopje, which spreads along the Vardar and the , a small river which comes from the north. In its administrative boundaries, the City of Skopje stretches for more than , but it is only wide.

Skopje is approximately 245 m above sea level and covers 571.46 km2. The urbanised area only covers 337 km2, with a density of 65 inhabitants per hectare. Skopje, in its administrative limits, encompasses many villages and other settlements, including Dračevo, Gorno Nerezi and Bardovci. According to the 2021 census, the City of Skopje had 526,502 inhabitants.

The City of Skopje reaches the Kosovo border to the north-east. Clockwise, it is also bordered by the municipalities of Čučer-Sandevo, Lipkovo, Aračinovo, Ilinden, Studeničani, Sopište, Želino and Jegunovce.

=== Hydrography ===

The Vardar river, which flows through Skopje, is at approximately from its source near Gostivar. In Skopje, its average discharge is 51 m3/s, with a wide amplitude depending on seasons, between 99.6 m3/s in May and 18.7 m3/s in July. The water temperature is between 4.6 °C in January and 18.1 °C in July.

Several rivers meet the Vardar within the city boundaries. The largest is the Treska, which is long. It crosses the Matka Canyon before reaching the Vardar on the western extremity of the City of Skopje. The Lepenac, coming from Kosovo, flows into the Vardar on the north-western end of the urban area. The Serava, also coming from the north, had flowed through the Old Bazaar until the 1960s when it was diverted towards the west because its waters were very polluted. Originally, it met the Vardar close to the seat of the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Nowadays, it flows into the Vardar near the ruins of Scupi. Markova Reka, which originates in Mount Vodno, meets the Vardar at the eastern extremity of the city. These three rivers are less than long.

The City of Skopje incorporates two artificial lakes, on the Treska. Lake Matka is the result of the construction of a dam in Matka Canyon in the 1930s, and the Treska lake was dug for leisurely purposes in 1978. Three small natural lakes can be found near Smilkovci, on the north-eastern edge of the urban area.

The river Vardar historically caused many floods, such as in 1962, when its outflow reached 1110 m3/s−1. Several works have been carried out since Byzantine times to limit the risks, and since the construction of the Kozjak dam on the Treska in 1994, the flood risk is close to zero.

The subsoil contains a large water table which is alimented by the Vardar and functions as an underground river. Under the table lies an aquifer contained in marl. The water table is 4 to 12 m under the ground and 4 to 144 m deep. Several wells collect its waters but most of the drinking water used in Skopje comes from a karstic spring in Rašče, west of the city.

=== Geology ===

The Skopje valley is bordered on the west by the Šar Mountains, on the South by the Jakupica range, on the east by hills belonging to the Osogovo range, and on the north by the Skopska Crna Gora. Mount Vodno, the highest point inside the city limits, is 1066 m high and is part of the Jakupica range.

Although Skopje is built on the foot of Mount Vodno, the urban area is mostly flat. It comprises several minor hills, generally covered with woods and parks, such as Gazi Baba hill (325 m), Zajčev Rid (327 m), the foothills of Mount Vodno (the smallest are between 350 and 400 m high) and the promontory on which Skopje Fortress is built.

The Skopje valley is near a seismic fault between the African and Eurasian tectonic plates and experiences regular seismic activity. This activity in enhanced by the porous structure of the subsoil. Large earthquakes occurred in Skopje in 518, 1555 and 1963.

The Skopje valley belongs to the Vardar geotectonic region, the subsoil of which is formed of Neogene and Quaternary deposits. The substratum is made of Pliocene deposits including sandstone, marl, and various conglomerates. It is covered by a first layer of Quaternary sands and silt, which is between 70 and 90 m deep. The layer is topped by a much smaller layer of clay, sand, silt, and gravel, carried by the Vardar river. It is between 1.5 and 5.2 m deep.

In some areas, the subsoil is karstic. It led to the formation of canyons, such as the Matka Canyon, which is surrounded by ten caves. They are between 20 and 176 m deep.

=== Climate ===

Skopje has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;), bordering on a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfa&quot;) with a mean annual temperature of . Precipitation is relatively low due to the pronounced rain shadow of the Accursed Mountains to the north-west, being significantly less than what is received on the Adriatic Sea coast at the same latitude. The summers are long, hot and relatively dry with low humidity. Skopje&#x27;s average July high is . On average Skopje experiences 88 days above each year, and 10.2 days above every year.

Winters are short, relatively cold and wet. Snowfalls are common in the winter period, but heavy snow accumulation is rare and the snowcover lasts only for a few hours or a few days if heavy. In summer, temperatures are usually above and sometimes above . In spring and autumn, the temperatures range from . In winter, the day temperatures are roughly in the range from , but at nights they often fall below and sometimes below . Typically, temperatures throughout one year range from −13 °C to 39 °C. Occurrences of precipitation are evenly distributed throughout the year, being heaviest from October to December, and from April to June.
=== Environment ===
The City of Skopje encompasses various natural environments, having diverse fauna and flora. However, it is threatened by the intensification of agriculture and urban extension. The largest protected area within the city limits is Mount Vodno, which is a popular leisure destination. A cable car connects its peak to the downtown, and many pedestrian paths run through its woods. Other large natural spots include the Matka Canyon.

The city itself comprises several parks and gardens amounting to 4,361 hectares. Amongst these are the , built by the Ottoman Turks at the beginning of the 20th century; Žena Borec Park, in front of the Parliament; the university arboretum; and Gazi Baba forest. Many streets and boulevards are planted with trees.

Steel processing—a crucial activity for the local economy—is responsible for soil pollution with heavy metals such as lead, zinc and cadmium, and air pollution with nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide. Vehicle traffic and district heating plants are also responsible for air pollution.

Water treatment plants are being built, but much of the polluted water is still being discharged untreated into the Vardar. Waste is disposed of in the open-air municipal landfill site, north of the city. Every day, it receives 1,500 m3 of domestic waste and 400 m3 of industrial waste. Health levels are better in Skopje than in the rest of North Macedonia, and no link has been found between the low environmental quality and the health of the residents.
== Urbanism ==

=== Urban morphology ===
The urban morphology of Skopje was deeply impacted by the 1963 earthquake, which destroyed 80% of the city, and by its subsequent reconstruction. For instance, neighbourhoods were rebuilt in such a way that the demographic density remains low to limit the impact of potential future earthquakes.

Reconstruction following the 1963 earthquake was mainly conducted by the Polish architect Adolf Ciborowski, who had already planned the reconstruction of Warsaw after World War II. Ciborowski divided the city into blocks dedicated to specific activities. The banks of the Vardar river became natural areas and parks, areas between the main boulevards were built with high-rise housing and shopping centres, and the suburbs were left to individual housing and industry. Reconstruction had to be quick to relocate families and to relaunch the local economy. To stimulate economic development, the number of thoroughfares was increased and future urban extension was anticipated.
The south bank of the Vardar river generally comprises high-rise tower blocks, including the vast Karpoš neighbourhood which was built in the 1970s west of the centre. Towards the east, the new municipality of Aerodrom was planned in the 1980s to house 80,000 inhabitants on the site of the old airport. Between Karpoš and Aerodrom lies the city centre, rebuilt according to plans by Japanese architect Kenzo Tange. The centre is surrounded by a row of long buildings suggesting a wall ().

On the north bank, where the most ancient parts of the city lie, the Old Bazaar was restored and its surroundings were rebuilt with low-rise buildings, so as not to spoil views of the Skopje Fortress. Several institutions, including the university and the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, were also relocated to the north bank to reduce borders between the ethnic communities. The north bank is mostly inhabited by Muslim Albanians, Turks, and Roma, whereas Christian ethnic Macedonians predominantly reside on the south bank.

The earthquake left the city with few historical monuments, apart from the Ottoman-era Old Bazaar, and the reconstruction, conducted between the 1960s and 1980s, turned Skopje into a modernist city. At the end of the 2000s, the city centre experienced profound changes. A highly controversial urban project, Skopje 2014, was adopted by the municipal authorities to give the city a more monumental and historical aspect, and thus to transform it into a proper national capital. Several neoclassical buildings destroyed in the 1963 earthquake were rebuilt, including the national theatre, and streets and squares were refurbished. Many other elements were also built, including fountains, statues, hotels, government buildings and bridges. The project has been criticised because of its cost and its historicist aesthetics. The large Albanian minority felt it was not represented in the new monuments, and launched side projects, including a new square over the boulevard that separates the city centre from the Old Bazaar.

=== Urban sociology ===
Skopje is an ethnically diverse city, and its urban sociology primarily depends on ethnic and religious affiliation. Macedonians form 66% of the city population, whilst Albanians and Roma account respectively for 20% and 6%. Each ethnic group generally self-segregates itself to certain areas of the city. Macedonians live south of the Vardar in areas massively rebuilt after 1963, whilst Muslims live on the northern side, in the oldest neighbourhoods of the city. These neighbourhoods are considered more traditional, whereas the south side evokes modernity to Macedonians.

The northern areas are the poorest; this is especially true for Topaana, in Čair municipality, and for Šuto Orizari municipality, which are the two main Roma neighbourhoods. They are made of many illegal constructions not connected to the electric grid nor water supply, which are passed from one generation to another. Topaana, close to the Old Bazaar, is a very old area: it was first mentioned as a Roma neighbourhood in the beginning of the 14th century. It has between 3,000 and 5,000 inhabitants. Šuto Orizari, on the northern edge of the city, is a municipality of its own, with Romani as its local official language. It was developed after the 1963 earthquake to accommodate Roma who had lost their homes.

The population density varies greatly from one area to another. So does the size of the living area per person. The city average was at per person , but at in Centar on the south bank, and only in Čair on the north bank. In Šuto Orizari, the average was at .

=== Localities and villages ===
Outside of the urban area, the City of Skopje encompasses many small settlements. Some of them are becoming outer suburbs, such as Čento, on the road to Belgrade, which has more than 23,000 inhabitants, and Dračevo, which has almost 20,000 inhabitants. Other large settlements are north of the city, such as Radišani, with 9,000 inhabitants, whereas smaller villages can be found on Mount Vodno or in Saraj municipality, which is the most rural of the ten municipalities that form the City of Skopje.

Some localities outside the city limits are also becoming outer suburbs, particularly in Ilinden and Petrovec municipality. They benefit from the presence of major roads, railways, and the airport, Skopje International, in Petrovec.

=== Pollution ===
Air pollution is a serious problem in Skopje, especially in winter. Concentrations of certain types of particulate matter (PM2 and PM10) are regularly over twelve times the WHO-recommended maximum levels. In winter, smoke regularly obscures vision and can lead to problems for motorists. Together with Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia has the most polluted urban areas in Europe.

Skopje&#x27;s high levels of pollution are caused by a combination of smoke from houses, emissions from the industry, public and private transport, and a general lack of interest in caring for the environment. Central heating is often not affordable, and so households often burn firewood, as well as used car tyres, plastic waste, petroleum, and other possibly flammable waste, which emits toxic chemicals harmful to the population, especially to children and the elderly.

The city&#x27;s smog has reduced its air quality and affected the health of many of its citizens, many of whom have died from pollution-related illnesses.

An application called &quot;AirCare&quot; () has been launched by local eco-activist Gorjan Jovanovski to help citizens track pollution levels. It uses a traffic light system, with purple for heavily polluted air, red for high levels detected, amber for moderate levels detected, and green for when the air is safe to inhale. The application relies on both government and volunteer sensors to track hourly air pollution. Unfortunately, government sensors are frequently inoperable and malfunctioning, causing the need for more low-cost, but less accurate, volunteer sensors to be put up by citizens. Faults on government sensors are especially frequent when the pollution is measured is extremely high, according to the AQILHC (Air Quality Index Levels of Health Concern).

Skopje topped the ranks in December 2017 as one of the most polluted cities in the world. In 2017, as part of the city&#x27;s efforts to reduce pollution, a CityTree was installed, and promoted by German ambassador .

On 29 November 2019, a march, organised by the Skopje Smog Alarm activist community, attracted thousands of people who opposed the government&#x27;s lack of action in dealing with the city&#x27;s pollution, which has worsened since 2017, contributing to around 1300 deaths annually.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

The rocky promontory on which Skopje Fortress stands was the first site to be settled in Skopje. The earliest vestiges of human inhabitance found on this site date from the Chalcolithic (4th millennium BC).

Although the Chalcolithic settlement must have been of some significance, it declined during the Bronze Age. Archeological research suggests that the settlement always belonged to the same culture, which progressively evolved due to contacts with Balkan and Danube cultures, and later with the Aegean. The locality eventually disappeared during the Iron Age when Scupi emerged on Zajčev Rid hill, some west of the fortress promontory. At the centre of the Balkan peninsula and on the road between the Danube and Aegean Sea, it was a prosperous locality, although its history is not well known.

During the Iron Age, the area of Skopje was inhabited by the Dardani. Illyrian tribes lived in most of the area west of Skopje and Thracian groups (Maedi) to the east, whilst Paeonians lived to the south of Skopje. The Dardanians had remained independent after the Roman conquest of Macedon, and it seems most likely that Dardania lost its independence in 28 BC.

=== Roman Scupi ===
Roman expansion east brought Scupi under Roman rule as a colony of legionaries, mainly veterans of the Legio VII Claudia during the reign of Emperor Domitian (AD 81–96). However, several legions from the Roman province of Macedonia of Crassus&#x27; army may already have been stationed there around 29–28 BC before the official imperial command was instituted. The first mention of the city was made at that period by Livy, who died in AD 17. Scupi first served as a military base to maintain peace in the region and was officially named &quot;, &quot; being the name of the emperor&#x27;s dynasty. Shortly afterwards it became part of the province of Moesia during Augustus&#x27;s rule. After the division of the province by Domitian in AD 86, Scupi was elevated to colonial status and became a seat of government within the new province of Moesia Superior. The district called Dardania (within Moesia Superior) was formed into a special province by Emperor Diocletian, with the capital at Naissus. In Roman times the eastern part of Dardania, from Scupi to Naissus, remained inhabited mostly by a local population, mainly of Thracian origin.

The city&#x27;s population was very diverse. Engravings on tombstones suggest that only a minority of the population came from Italia, whilst many veterans were from Dalmatia, southern Gaul and Syria. Because of the ethnic diversity of the population, Latin maintained itself as the main language in the city at the expense of Greek, which was spoken in most of the Moesian and Macedonian cities. During the following centuries, Scupi experienced prosperity. The period from the end of the 3rd century to the end of the 4th century was particularly flourishing. The first church was founded under the reign of Emperor Constantine the Great and Scupi became the seat of a diocese. In 395, following the division of the Roman Empire into two, Scupi became part of the Eastern Roman Empire.

An ancient funeral inscription of the Illyrian tribe Albanoi was found in Scupi.

In its zenith, Scupi covered 40 hectares and was closed by a wide wall. It had many monuments, including four necropoles, a theatre, thermae, and a large Christian basilica.

=== Middle Ages ===
In 518, Scupi was destroyed by a violent earthquake, possibly the most devastating the town had ever experienced. At that time, the region was threatened by Barbarian invasions, and the city inhabitants had already fled to the forests and mountains before the disaster occurred. The city was eventually rebuilt by Justinian I. During his reign, many Byzantine towns were relocated on hills and other easily defendable places to face invasions. It was thus transferred to another site: the promontory on which Skopje Fortress stands. Despite this, Scupi was sacked by Slavs at the end of the 6th century and the city seems to have fallen under Slavic rule in 595. The Slavic tribe which sacked Scupi was probably the Berziti, who had invaded the entire Vardar Valley. However, the Slavs did not settle permanently in the region, which had been already plundered and depopulated, but continued south to the Mediterranean coast. After the Slavic invasion it was deserted for some time and is not mentioned during the following centuries. Perhaps in the late 7th or the early 8th century the Byzantines again settled at this strategic location. Along with the rest of the Upper Vardar valley it became part of the expanding Bulgarian Empire in the 830s.
Starting from the end of the 10th century Skopje experienced a period of wars and political troubles. It served as the Bulgarian capital from 972 to 992, and Tsar Samuel ruled it from 976 until 1004, when its governor surrendered it to Byzantine Emperor Basil the Bulgar Slayer in 1004 in exchange for the titles of &quot;patrikios&quot; and &quot;strategos&quot;. It became a centre of a new Byzantine province called Bulgaria. Later Skopje was briefly seized twice by Slavic insurgents who wanted to restore the Bulgarian state. At first in 1040 under Peter Delyan&#x27;s command, and in 1072 under the orders of Georgi Voyteh. In 1081, Skopje was captured by Norman troops led by Robert Guiscard and the city remained in their hands until 1088. Skopje was subsequently conquered by the Serbian Grand Prince Vukan in 1093, and again by the Normans four years later. However, because of epidemics and food shortage, Normans quickly surrendered to the Byzantines.

During the 12th and 13th centuries, Bulgarians and Serbs took advantage of Byzantine decline to create large kingdoms stretching from the Danube to the Aegean Sea. Kaloyan brought Skopje back into the re-established Second Bulgarian Empire in 1203 until his nephew Strez declared autonomy along the Upper Vardar with Serbian aid only five years later. In 1209, Strez switched allegiances and recognised Boril of Bulgaria with whom he led a successful joint campaign against Serbia&#x27;s first internationally recognised King Stefan Nemanjić. From 1214 to 1230, Skopje was a part of the Byzantine successor state of Epirus before being recaptured by Ivan Asen II and held by Bulgaria until 1246 when the Upper Vardar valley was incorporated once more into another Byzantine rump state – the Empire of Nicaea. Byzantine conquest was briefly reversed in 1255 by the regents of the young Michael Asen I of Bulgaria. Meanwhile, in the parallel civil war for the Crown in Tarnovo, the Skopje boyar and grandson of Stefan Nemanja Constantine Tikh gained the upper hand and ruled until the Uprising of Ivaylo, Europe&#x27;s only successful peasant revolt, led to his deposition from power.

In 1282, Skopje was captured by Serbian King Stefan Milutin. Under the political stability of the Nemanjić rule, settlement has spread outside the walls of the fortress, towards Gazi Baba hill. Churches, monasteries and markets were built and tradesmen from the Republic of Venice and Dubrovnik opened shops. The town greatly benefited from its location near European, Middle Eastern, and African markets. In the 14th century, Skopje became such an important city that King Stefan Dušan made it the capital of the Serbian Empire. In 1346, he was crowned as Emperor of the Serbs and Greeks in Skopje. After his death the Serbian Empire collapsed into several principalities which were unable to defend themselves against the Ottoman Turks. Skopje was first inherited by the Lordship of Prilep and finally taken by Vuk Branković in the wake of the Battle of Maritsa (1371) before becoming part of the Ottoman Empire in 1392.

In 1330, Serbian King Stefan Dečanski mentioned Albanians as being in the district of Skopje and regularly going to the Fair of Saint George which convened near the city.

=== Ottoman period ===
The Ottomans stayed in Skopje for over 520 years and the city&#x27;s economic life greatly benefited from its position in the middle of Rumelia, the European province of the Ottomans. The Stone Bridge, &quot;one of the most imposing stone bridges to be found in Yugoslavia&quot;, was reconstructed under the patronage of Sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror between 1451 and 1469. The Ottomans drastically changed the appearance of the city. They organised the Bazaar with its caravanserais, mosques and baths.

In the cadastral register of 1451–52, the Skopje neighborhood &#x27; (), is mentioned, being named after the medieval Albanian Gjini family. The neighbourhood displayed mixed Christian Albanian anthroponymy with cases of Slavicisation present (e.g. ; &#x27; + Slavic suffix &quot;ić&quot;). During this time period, a number of timariots of the city are recorded as bearing the name (meaning Albanian) alongside a Muslim name, i.e. &quot;, , &quot;. Another group bore Slavic Christian names, whilst also carrying bearing the surname /&#x27;, i.e. &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, etc. These individuals are not noted as having the Slavic appellatives &#x27;, &#x27; or &#x27;, which were given by Ottoman authorities to new settlers of a given region, likely indicating they were locals. In the year 1451 or 1453 a neighborhood was registered bearing an Aromanian name, . Amongst the 45 family heads of this neighborhood, Christian Slavic and Albanian anthroponyms were recorded (, son of , &quot;Koljko Bibani&quot;, &#x27;, son of &#x27;, etc.), whilst a sizeable number of individuals bearing mixed Slavic-Vlach anthroponyms are also registered, such as: &#x27;, son of Vllah (&quot;Iflak&quot;), &#x27;, son of &#x27;, &#x27;, , , etc.

In the mahallah in the year 1451 or 1453, a head of the family from the noble Albanian Muzaka family, who had converted to Islam, was re-registered amongst the Muslim heads of the family. In the other register of 1467/68, now in the Christian mahallah named , amongst the 29 heads of families with Slavic Christian anthroponyms, a number also carried Albanian anthroponyms. In the neighborhood of , amongst the residents with Muslim names, the head of the family was registered only with the surname &quot;Zenebishi&quot;, without mentioning his social position or his profession, indicating a higher social status. This may suggest a relation to Hasan Bey Zenebishi, a descendant of the Zenebishi family and the Soubashi of the Nahiyah of Kalkandelen. Individuals bearing Albanian anthroponyms, be they in conjunction with Islamic, Slavic or Christian ones, also appear in the neighbourhoods of &quot;Kasim Fakih&quot;, &quot;Dursun Saraç&quot;, &quot;Kujumxhi Mentesheli&quot;, &quot;Çerep, Jandro, Stanimir, Vllah Dançu&quot; and &quot;Rela&quot;. A number of Sipahis were also of Albanian origin, with these individuals holding timars in areas which had a Christian Albanian symbiosis with Slavic anthroponyms in the vicinity of Skopje. The defters noted that these were old sipahis, likely having been landowners. These individual Sipahis were closely related by descent and blood, and taking account kinship ties, even though they had heterogeneous, Christian, Slavic and Oriental names, they appear to have been Albanians. Some have names indicating their origin, such as &quot;Shimerd Vardarli&quot; from Skopje, making it likely these timariotes were locals.
Around 1529, the Christians of Skopje were mostly non-converted Slavs and Albanians, but also Ragusan and Armenian tradesmen. Mustafa Pasha Mosque, built in 1492, is reputed to be &quot;one of the most resplendent sacral Islamic buildings in the Balkans.&quot; In 1535 all churches were demolished by decree of the Ottoman governor. In 1555, the city was hit by another severe earthquake, collapsing much of the city. The Old Bazaar of Skopje, the columns of the Stone Bridge, and the murals in the upper parts of the Church of Saint Panteleimon, Gorno Nerezi were all severely damaged. Some modern sources estimate this earthquake to have been a Category XII (Extreme) on the Modified Mercalli intensity scale, although others believe this is an overestimate.

In 1623–1624, Pjeter Mazreku, a Roman Catholic prelate, reported the town was inhabited by &quot;Turks (Muslims), the majority of them being Albanians, the rest are of Asiatic origin&quot;, Mazreku further wrote, &quot;there are also Jews, Serbs and some Greeks in the town&quot;. In the Ottoman period, &quot;Turk&quot; was used within Christian writings as a name for a Muslim or for Islamised Albanians. Sources from the years of 1689–1690 considered the town of Shkupi (Skopje) during those periods as part of Albania.

Until the 17th century, Skopje experienced a long golden age. Around 1650, the number of inhabitants in Skopje was between 30,000 and 60,000, and the city contained more than 10,000 houses. It was then one of the only big cities on the territory of future Yugoslavia, together with Belgrade and Sarajevo. At that time, Dubrovnik, which was a busy harbour, had not even had 7,000 inhabitants. The city severely suffered from the Great Turkish War at the end of the 17th century and consequently experienced recession until the 19th century. In 1689, the Habsburgs seized Skopje which was already weakened by a cholera epidemic. The same day, general Silvio Piccolomini began the Skopje fire of 1689, attempting to end the epidemic. It is however possible that he wanted to avenge damages that the Ottomans caused in the Battle of Vienna in 1683. Skopje burned for two days but the general himself perished of the plague and his leaderless army was routed. The Austrian presence in Macedonia motivated Slav uprisings. Nevertheless, the Austrians left the country within the year and the Hajduks, the leaders of the uprisings, had to follow them in their retreat north of the Balkans. Some were arrested by the Ottomans, such as Petar Karposh, who was impaled on Skopje&#x27;s Stone Bridge.

After the war, Skopje was in ruins. Most of the official buildings were restored or rebuilt, but the city experienced new plague and cholera epidemics and many inhabitants emigrated. Ottoman Empire as a whole entered in recession and political decline. Many rebellions and pillages occurred in Macedonia during the 18th century, either led by Ottoman outlaws, Janissaries or Hajduks. An estimation conducted by French officers around 1836 revealed that at that time Skopje only had around 10,000 inhabitants. It was surpassed by two other towns of present-day North Macedonia: Bitola (40,000) and Štip (15–20,000).

Skopje began to recover from decades of decline after 1850. At that time, the city experienced a slow but steady demographic growth, mainly due to the rural exodus of Slavic Macedonians. It was also fuelled by the exodus of Muslims from the Principalities of Serbia and Bulgaria, which were gaining autonomy and independence from the Empire at that time. During the Tanzimat reforms, nationalism arose in the Ottoman Empire and in 1870 a new Bulgarian Exarchate was established and its separate diocese was created, based on ethnic identity, rather than religious principles. The Slavic population of the bishopric of Skopje voted in 1874 overwhelmingly, by 91% in favour of joining the Exarchate and became part of the Bulgarian Millet. Economic growth was permitted by the construction of the Skopje-Salonica railway in 1873. The train station was built south of the Vardar and this contributed to the relocation of economic activities on that side of the river, which had never been urbanised before. Because of the rural exodus, the share of Christians in the city population increased. Some of the newcomers became part of the local elite and helped to spread nationalist ideas In 1877, Skopje was chosen as the capital city of the new Kosovo Vilayet, which encompassed present-day Kosovo, north-western Macedonia and the Sanjak of Novi Pazar.

In statistics gathered by Bulgarian ethnographer Vasil Kanchov in 1900, the City of Skopje was inhabited by 31,900 people, of whom 15,000 were Turks, 13,000 Christian Bulgarians, 1,920 Romani, 800 Jews, 450 Vlachs, 150 Christian Albanians, 50 Christian Greeks, 30 Circassians and 500 inhabitants of various other ethnicities. Kanchov wrote in the same year that many Albanians declared themselves as Turks. In Skopje, the population that declared itself Turkish &quot;was of Albanian blood&quot;, but it &quot;had been Turkified after the Ottoman invasion, including Skanderbeg&quot;, referring to Islamisation. Bulgarian literary historian Yordan Ivanov wrote in 1915 that Albanians, since they did not have their own alphabet, due to a lack of consolidated national consciousness and influenced by foreign propaganda, declared themselves as Turks, Greeks and Bulgarians, depending on which religion they belonged to. Albanians were losing their mother tongue in Skopje. German linguist Gustav Weigand described that Skopje&#x27;s Muslim population of &quot;Turks&quot; or &quot;Ottomans&quot; during the late Ottoman period were mainly Albanians who spoke Turkish in public and Albanian at home. In 1905, the city had 32,000 inhabitants, making it the largest of the vilayet, although closely followed by Prizren with its 30,000 inhabitants. At the beginning of the 20th century, local economy was focused on dyeing, weaving, tanning, ironworks and wine and flour processing.

Skopje was one of the five main centres of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation when it organised the 1903 Ilinden uprising. Its revolutionary network in the region led by Nikola Pushkarov was not well-developed and the lack of weapons was a serious problem. At the outbreak of the uprising, the rebel forces derailed a military train. On 3 and 5 August respectively, they attacked an Ottoman unit guarding the bridge on the Vardar river and gave a battle in the &quot;St. Jovan&quot; monastery. In the next few days, the band was pursued by numerous Bashibozuks and moved to Bulgaria.

Following the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, the Ottoman Empire experienced democracy and several political parties were created. However, some of the policies implemented by the Young Turks, such as a tax rise and the interdiction of ethnic-based political parties, discontented minorities. Albanians opposed the nationalist character of the movement and led local uprisings in 1910 and 1912. During the latter, they managed to seize most of Kosovo and took Skopje on 11 August. On 18 August, the insurgents signed the Üsküb agreement which provided for the creation of an autonomous Albanian province and they were amnestied the day later.

=== Balkan Wars to present day ===

Following an alliance contracted in 1912, Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia declared war on the Ottoman Empire. Their goal was to definitively expel the Ottomans from Europe. The First Balkan War started on 8 October 1912 and lasted six weeks. Serbians reached Skopje on 26 October. Ottoman forces had left the city the day before. During the conflict, Chetniks, a Serb irregular force razed the Albanian quarter of Skopje and killed numerous Albanian inhabitants from the city. The Serbian annexation led to the exodus of 725 Muslim families which left the city on 27 January 1913. The same year, the city population was evaluated at 37,000 by the Serbian authorities.
In 1915, during the First World War, Serbian Macedonia was invaded by Bulgaria, which captured Skopje on 22 October 1915. Serbia, allied to the Triple Entente, was helped by France, Britain, Greece, and Italy, which formed the Macedonian front. Following a great Allied offensive in 1918, the Armée française d&#x27;Orient reached Skopje 29 September and took the city by surprise. After the end of the World War, Vardar Macedonia became part of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which became &quot;Kingdom of Yugoslavia&quot; in 1929. A mostly foreign ethnic Serb ruling class gained control, imposing large-scale repression. The policies of de-Bulgarisation and assimilation were pursued. At that time part of the young locals, repressed by the Serbs, tried to find a separate way of ethnic Macedonian development. In 1931, in a move to formally decentralise the country, Skopje was named the capital of the Vardar Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Until the Second World War, Skopje experienced strong economic growth, and its population increased. The city had 41,066 inhabitants in 1921, 64,807 in 1931, and 80,000 in 1941. Although in an underdeveloped region, it attracted wealthy Serbs who opened businesses and contributed to the modernisation of the city. In 1941, Skopje had 45 factories, half of the industry in the whole of Socialist Macedonia.
In 1941, during the Second World War, Yugoslavia was invaded by Nazi Germany. Germans seized Skopje on 8 April and left it to their Bulgarian allies on 22 April 1941. To ensure the Bulgarisation of the society, authorities closed Serbian schools and churches, opening new schools and a higher education institute, the King Boris University. The 4,000 Jews of Skopje were all deported in 1943 to the Treblinka extermination camp where almost all of them were killed.
Skopje was liberated on 13 November 1944 by units of the Bulgarian People&#x27;s Army (Bulgaria having switched sides in the war in September) aided by Yugoslav Partisans of the Macedonian National Liberation Army. Skopje became the capital city of the newly proclaimed Democratic Federal Macedonia as set up by the ASNOM on 2 August 1944 in the Bulgarian occupation zone in Yugoslavia.

After World War II, Skopje greatly benefited from Socialist Yugoslav policies which encouraged industry and the development of Macedonian cultural institutions. Consequently, Skopje became home to a national library, a philharmonic orchestra, a university, and the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts. However, its post-war development was altered by the 1963 earthquake which occurred on 26 July. Although relatively weak in magnitude, it caused enormous damage in the city and can be compared to the 1960 Agadir earthquake. The disaster killed 1,070 people, injuring 3,300 others. 16,000 people were buried alive in ruins and 70% of the population lost their home. Many educational facilities, factories and historical buildings were destroyed.


After the earthquake, reconstruction was quick. It had a deep psychological impact on the population because neighbourhoods were split and people were relocated to new houses and buildings they were not familiar with. Many Albanians, some from Kosovo participated in the reconstruction effort. Reconstruction was finished by 1980, even if many elements were never built because funds were exhausted. Skopje cityscape was drastically changed and the city became a true example of modernist architecture. Demographic growth was very important after 1963, and Skopje had 408,100 inhabitants in 1981. After 1963, rural youth migrated to Skopje and were involved in the reconstruction process resulting in a large growth of the urban Macedonian population. The Albanian population of Skopje also increased as people from the northern villages migrated to the city and others came from Kosovo either to provide manpower for reconstruction or fled the deteriorating political situation, especially during the 1990s. However, during the 1980s and the 1990s, the country experienced inflation and recession and the local economy heavily suffered. The situation became better during the 2000s thanks to new investments. Many landmarks were restored and the &quot;Skopje 2014&quot; project renewed the appearance of the city centre.

==Emblems==

The Flag of Skopje is a red banner in proportions 1:2 with a gold-coloured coat of arms of the city positioned in the upper-left corner. It is either vertical or horizontal, but the vertical version was the first to be used.

The coat of arms of the city was adopted in the 1950s. It depicts the Stone Bridge with the Vardar river, the Kale Fortress and the snow-capped peaks of the Šar mountains.

==Administration==

===Status===

Being the capital and largest city of North Macedonia, Skopje enjoys a particular status granted by law. The last revision of its status was made in 2004. Since then, the City of Skopje has been divided into 10 municipalities which all have a council and a mayor, like all of the country&#x27;s municipalities. Municipalities only deal with matters specific of their territory, and the City of Skopje deals with matters that concern all of them, or that cannot be divided between two or more municipalities.

The City of Skopje is part of the Skopje Statistical Region, which has no political or administrative power.

===City Council===
The City Council consists of 45 members who serve a four-year term. It primarily deals with budget, global orientations and relations between the city and the government. Several commissions exist to treat more specific topics, such as urbanism, finances, environment of local development. The President of the council is elected by the Council Members. Since 2021 the president has been Trajko Slaveski, member of VMRO-DPMNE.

Following the 2021 local elections, the City Council is constituted as follows:
===Mayor===

The Mayor of Skopje is elected every four years.
The mayor represents the City of Skopje and can submit ideas to the council, manages the administrative bodies and their officials.

===Municipalities===
Skopje was first divided into administrative units in 1945, but the first municipalities were created in 1976. They were five: Centar, Čair, Karpoš, Gazi Baba and Kisela Voda. After the 1991 independence of the country, power was centralised and municipalities lost much of their competences. A 1996 law restored them and created two new municipalities: Ǵorče Petrov and Šuto Orizari. After the insurgency between Albanian rebels and Macedonian forces in 2001, a new law was enacted in 2004 to incorporate Saraj Municipality into the City of Skopje. Saraj is mostly populated by Albanians and, since then, Albanians represent more than 20% of the city population. Thus Albanian became the second official language of the city administration, something which was one of the claims of the Albanian rebels. The same year, Aerodrom Municipality separated itself from Kisela Voda, and Butel Municipality from Čair.

Municipalities are administered by a council of 23 members elected every four years. They also have a mayor and several departments (education, culture, finances...). The mayor primarily deals with these departments.
==Economy==

===Economic weight===

Skopje is a medium city at the European level. Being the capital and largest city of North Macedonia, Skopje concentrates a large share of the national economy. The Skopje Statistical Region, which encompasses the City of Skopje and some neighbouring municipalities, produces 45.5% of the Macedonian GDP. In 2009, the regional GDP per capita amounted to US$6,565, or 155% of the Macedonian GDP per capita. This figure is, however, smaller than the one of neighboring Sofia (US$10,106), Sarajevo (US$10,048) or Belgrade (US$7,983), but higher than the one of Tirana (US$4,126).

Because there are no other large cities in the country, and because of political and economic centralisation, a large number of Macedonians living outside of Skopje work in the capital city. The dynamism of the city also encourages rural exodus, not only from North Macedonia, but also from Kosovo, Albania and Southern Serbia.

===Firms and activities===

In 2009, Skopje had 26,056 firms but only 145 of them had a large size. The large majority of them are either small (12,017) or very small (13,625). A large share of the firms deal with trade of goods (9,758), 3,839 are specialised in business and real estate, and 2,849 are manufacturers. Although few in number, large firms account for 51% of the local production outside finance.
The city industry is dominated by food processing, textile, printing and metal processing. In 2012, it accounted for 30% of the city&#x27;s GDP. Most of the industrial areas are in Gazi Baba municipality, on the major routes and rail lines to Belgrade and Thessaloniki. Notably, the ArcelorMittal, Makstil steel plants and the Skopje Brewery are there. Other zones are between Aerodrom and Kisela Voda, along the railway to Greece. These zones comprise Alkaloid Skopje (pharmaceuticals), Rade Končar (electrical supplies), Imperial Tobacco, and Ohis (fertilisers). Two special economic zones also exist, around the airport and the Okta refinery. They have attracted several foreign companies, such as Johnson Controls, Johnson Matthey and Van Hool.

As the country&#x27;s financial capital, Skopje is the seat of the Macedonian Stock Exchange, of the National Bank, and of most of the country&#x27;s banking, insurance, and telecommunication companies, such as Makedonski Telekom, Komercijalna banka Skopje and Stopanska Banka. The services sector produces 60% of the city GDP.

Besides many small traditional shops, Skopje has two large markets, the &quot;Zelen Pazar&quot; (green market) and the &quot;Bit Pazar&quot; (flea market). They are both considered local institutions. However, since the 1970s, retailing has largely been modernised and Skopje now has many supermarkets and shopping centres. The largest, Skopje City Mall, opened in 2012. It comprises a Carrefour hypermarket, 130 shops and a cinema, and employs 2,000 people.
===Employment===

51% of the Skopje active population is employed in small firms. 52% of the population work in the services sector, 34% in industry, and the remaining is mainly employed in administration.

The unemployment rate for the Skopje Statistical Region was at 27% in 2009, three points under the national rate (30%). The neighbouring Polog Region had a similar rate, but the less affected region was the South-West, with 22%. Unemployment in Skopje mainly affects men, who represent 56% of job-seekers, people between 25 and 44 years old (45% of job-seekers), and non-qualified people (43%). Unemployment also concerns Roma people, who represent 4.63% of the city population but affects 70% of the active population in the community.

The average net monthly wage in Skopje was at €400 in October 2010, which represented 120% of the national figure. The average wage in Skopje was then lower than in Sarajevo (€522), Sofia (€436), and in Belgrade (€440).

==Demographics==
===Population===

According to the results of the 2021 census, the City of Skopje had 526,502 inhabitants. Skopje&#x27;s employment area covers a large part of the country, including Veles, Kumanovo and Tetovo, and totaling more than one million inhabitants.

Skopje contains roughly a quarter of North Macedonia&#x27;s population. The second most populous municipality, Kumanovo, had 107,632 inhabitants in 2011, and an urban unit of 76,272 inhabitants in 2002.

Before the Austro-Turkish war and the 1689 Great Fire, Skopje was one of the biggest cities in the Balkans, with a population estimated between 30,000 and 60,000 inhabitants. After the fire set by the retreating Austrian forces, it experienced a long period of decline and only had 10,000 inhabitants in 1836. However, the population started to rise again after 1850 and reached 32,000 inhabitants in 1905. In the 20th century, Skopje was one of the fastest-growing cities in Yugoslavia, and it had 448,200 inhabitants in 1981. Since then, the demographic growth has continued at a steady rate.

===Ethnic groups===

Ethnic groups in Greater Skopje consist of the following:

Skopje, just like North Macedonia as a whole, is characterised by a large ethnic diversity. The city is in a region where Macedonians and Albanians meet, and it has had populations of Bulgarians, Romani, Turks, Jews, and Serbs through its history. Skopje was mainly a Muslim city until the 19th century when large numbers of Christians started to settle there. According to the 2021 census, Macedonians were the largest ethnic group in Skopje, with 309,107 inhabitants, or 58.71% of the population. Then came Albanians with 120,293 inhabitants (22.85%), Roma people with 18,498 (3.51%), Serbs (9,478 inhabitants), Turks (8,524), Bosniaks (7,365) and Aromanians (also known as &quot;Vlachs&quot;, 2,778). 6,284 people did not belong to any of these groups.

Macedonians form an overwhelming majority of the population in the municipalities of Aerodrom, Centar, Ǵorče Petrov, Karpoš and Kisela Voda, which are all south of the Vardar. They also form a majority in Butel and Gazi Baba which are north of the river. Albanians form a majority in Čair which roughly corresponds to the Old Bazaar, and in Saraj. They form a large minority in Butel and Gazi Baba. Šuto Orizari, on the northern edge of the city, is predominantly Roma. When an ethnic minority forms at least 20% of the population in a municipality, its language can become official on the local level. Thus, in Čair and Saraj schools and administration use Albanian, and Romani in Šuto Orizari. The latter is the only municipality in the world where Romani is an official language.

Relations between the two largest groups, Macedonians and Albanians, are sometimes difficult, as in the rest of the country. Each group tolerates the other but they tend to avoid each other and live in what can appear as two parallel worlds. Both Macedonians and Albanians view themselves each as the original population of Skopje and the other as newcomers. The Roma minority is on its side very deprived. Its exact size is not known because many Macedonian Roma declare themselves as belonging to other ethnic groups or simply avoid censuses. However, even if official figures are underestimated, Skopje is the city in the world with the largest Roma population.

===Religion===

Religious affiliation is diverse: Macedonians, Serbs, and Aromanians are mainly Orthodox, with the majority affiliated to the Macedonian Orthodox Church; Turks are almost entirely Muslim; those of Albanian ethnicity are largely Muslim, although Skopje also has a sizeable Roman Catholic Albanian minority, into which Mother Teresa was born; the Roma (Gypsies) represent a mixture (in almost equal numbers) of Muslim and Orthodox religious heritage.

According to the 2002 census, 68.5% of the population of Skopje belonged to the Eastern Orthodox Church, whilst 28.6% belonged to Islam. The city also had Catholic (0.5%) and Protestant (0.04%) minorities. The Catholics are served by the Latin bishopric of Skopje, in which is also vested the Byzantine Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Macedonia.
Until World War II, Skopje had a significant Jewish minority which mainly descended from Spanish Sephardis who had escaped the Inquisition. The community comprised 2,424 members in 1939 (representing about 3% of the city population), but most of them were deported and killed by Nazis. After the war, most of the survivors settled in Israel. Today the city has around 200 Jewish inhabitants (about 0.04% of the population).

Because of its 520-year Ottoman past, and the fact that many of its inhabitants today are Muslims, Skopje has more mosques than churches. Religious communities often complain about the lack of infrastructure and new places of worship are often built. Skopje is the seat of many Macedonian religious organisations, such as the Macedonian Orthodox Church and the Islamic Religious Union of Macedonia. It has an Orthodox cathedral and seminary, several madrasahs, a Roman Catholic cathedral and a synagogue.

===Health===
Skopje has several public and private hospitals and specialised medical institutions, such as the Filip II Hospital, a psychiatric hospital, two obstetric hospitals, a gerontology hospital, and institutes for respiratory and ocular diseases. In 2012, Skopje had a ratio of one physician per 251.6 inhabitants, a figure higher than the national ratio (one per 370.9). The ratio of medical specialists was also higher than in the rest of the country. However, the ratio of hospital beds, pharmacists and dentists was lower in Skopje. The population in Skopje enjoys better health standards than other Macedonians. In 2010, the mortality rate was at 8.6‰ in Skopje and 9.3‰ on the national level. The infant mortality rate was at 6.8‰ in Skopje and 7.6‰ in North Macedonia.

===Education===

Skopje&#x27;s citizenry is generally more educated than the rest of the country. 16% of Skopjans have graduated from university in contrast to 10% for the rest of the country. The number of people with a complete lack of education or ones who received a partial education is lower in Skopje at 9% compared to the provincial average of 17%. 80% of Macedonian citizens who hold a PhD take up residence in Skopje.

Skopje has 21 secondary schools; 5 of which serve as general high-school gymnasiums and 16 vocational schools. The city is also host to several higher education institutions, the most notable of which is Ss. Cyril and Methodius University, founded in 1949. The university has 23 departments, 10 research institutes and is attended by an average of 50,000 students. After the country&#x27;s independence in 1991, several private universities were brought into existence. The largest private universities in Skopje are European University Skopje with 7 departments and FON University with 9 departments respectively.

==Media==

Skopje is the largest media centre in North Macedonia. Of the 818 newspapers surveyed in 2000 by the Ministry of Information, over 600 had their headquarters in Skopje. The daily , founded in 1996, with 60 000 runs per day is the most printed in the country. Also based in Skopje, Večer is pulled 50,000 copies and the state owns one-third of its capital, as well as Nova Makedonija, reprinted 20,000 copies. Other major newspapers in Skopje, totally private, are Utrinski Vesnik (30,000 copies), Vest (25,000 copies), and Vreme (15,000 copies). Magazines Fokus (12,000 copies), Start (10,000 copies), and Denes (7,500 copies) also have their headquarters in Skopje.

The city is home of the studios of Macedonian Radio-Television (MRT), the country&#x27;s public radio and television. Founded in 1966, it operates with three national broadcast channels, twenty-four hours a day. The most popular private television stations are Sitel, Kanal 5, Telma, Alfa TV, and AlsatM. MRT also operates radio stations with national coverage, the private station Skopje&#x27;s Kanal 77 is the only one to have such a span. Radio Antenna 5 and Metropolis are two other major private stations that have their headquarters in Skopje.

Also, the city boasts big news agencies in the country, both public, such as the Media Information Agency, and private, such as the Makfax.

==Sports==
As the capital and largest city of North Macedonia, Skopje has many major sporting facilities. The city has three large swimming pools, two of which feature Olympic pools. These pools are particularly relevant to coaching water polo teams. Skopje also boasts many football stadiums, like Ilinden in Čair and Železarnica, which can accommodate between 4,000 and 4,500 spectators. The basketball court Kale can accommodate 2,200 people and the court of Jane Sandanski has a 6,000 seat capacity.

The largest stadium remains Toše Proeski Arena. The stadium, built in 1947 and named until 2008, City Stadium Skopje experienced a total renovation, begun in 2009 to meet the standards of FIFA. Fully renovated the stadium contains 33,460 seats, and a health spa and fitness area. The Boris Trajkovski Sports Center is the largest sports complex in the country with 6,250 seats. It was opened in 2008 and named after former president Boris Trajkovski, who died in 2004. It includes rooms dedicated to handball, basketball, and volleyball, a bowling alley, a fitness area, and an ice hockey court. Its main hall, which regularly hosts concerts, holds around 10,000 people.

FK Vardar and FK Rabotnički are the two most popular football teams in the city. Vardar plays in the second division, whilst Rabotnicki plays in the first division. Their games are held at Toše Proeski Arena, like those of the national team. The city is also home to many smaller football clubs, such as: FK Makedonija Ǵorče Petrov, FK Gorno Lisiče, FK Lokomotiva Skopje, FK Metalurg Skopje, FK Madžari Solidarnost and FK Skopje, who play in first, second or third national league. Another popular sport in North Macedonia is basketball, represented in particular by the teams MZT Skopje and Rabotnički. Handball is illustrated by RK Vardar PRO and RK Metalurg Skopje, also the women&#x27;s team ŽRK Metalurg and ŽRK Vardar. The city co-hosted the 2008 European Women&#x27;s Handball Championship together with Ohrid, and hosted the 2017 UEFA Super Cup, the match between the two giants of the European football Real Madrid and Manchester United

==Transport==

===Main connections===

Skopje is near three other capital cities, Pristina ( away), Tirana (291 km) and Sofia (245 km). Thessaloniki is south and Belgrade is north. Skopje is also at the crossroad of two Pan-European corridors: Corridor X, which runs between Austria and Greece, and Corridor VIII, which runs from the Adriatic in Albania to the Black Sea in Bulgaria. Corridor X links Skopje to Thessaloniki, Belgrade, and Western Europe, whilst Corridor VIII links it with Tirana and Sofia.

Corridor X locally corresponds to the M-1 motorway (E75), which is the longest highway in North Macedonia. It also corresponds to the Tabanovce-Gevgelija railway. Corridor VIII, less developed, corresponds to the M-4 motorway and the Kičevo-Beljakovce railway. Skopje is not quite on the Corridor X and the M-1 does not pass on the city territory. Thus the junction between the M-1 and M-4 is some east, close to the airport. Although Skopje is geographically close to other major cities, movement of people and goods is not optimised, especially with Albania. This is mainly due to poor infrastructure. As a result, 61.8% of Skopjans have never been to Tirana, whilst only 6.7% have never been to Thessaloniki and 0% to Sofia. Furthermore, 26% of Thessalonians, 33% of Sofians and 37% of Tiranans have never been to Skopje.

The first highways were built during the Yugoslav period, when Skopje was linked through the Brotherhood and Unity Highway to, what was then, the Yugoslav capital Belgrade to the North, and the Greek border to the South.

===Rail and coach stations===

The main railway station in Skopje is serviced by the Belgrade-Thessaloniki and Skopje-Pristina international lines. After the completion of the Corridor VIII railway project, currently scheduled for 2030, the city will also be linked to Tirana and Sofia. Daily trains also link Skopje with other towns of North Macedonia, such as Kumanovo, Kičevo, Štip, Bitola or Veles.

Skopje has several minor railway stations but the city does not have its own railway network and they are only serviced by intercity or international lines. On the railway linking the main station to Belgrade and Thessaloniki are Dračevo and Dolno Lisiče stations, and on the railway to Kičevo are Skopje-North, Ǵorče Petrov and Saraj stations. Several other stations are freight-only.

Skopje coach station opened in 2005 and is built right under the main railway station. It can host 450 coaches in a day. Coach connections reach more destinations than train connections, connecting Skopje to many domestic and foreign destinations including Istanbul, Sofia, Prague, Hamburg and Stockholm.

===Public transport===

Skopje has a bus network managed by the city and operated by three companies. The oldest and largest is JSP Skopje, a public company founded in 1948. JSP lost its monopoly on public transport in 1990 and two new companies, Sloboda Prevoz and Mak Ekspres, obtained several lines. However, most of the network is still in the hands of JSP which operates 67 lines out of 80. Only 24 lines are urban, the others serving localities around the city. Many of the JSP vehicles are red Yutong City Master double-decker buses built by Chinese bus manufacturer Yutong and designed to resemble the classic British AEC Routemaster.

A tram network has long been planned in Skopje and the idea was first proposed in the 1980s. The project became real in 2006 when the mayor Trifun Kostovski asked for feasibility studies. His successor Koce Trajanovski launched a call for tenders in 2010 and the first line is scheduled for 2019.

A new network for small buses started to operate in June 2014, not to replace but to decrease the number of big buses in the city centre.

===Airport===
The airport was built in 1928. The first commercial flights in Skopje were introduced in 1929 when the Yugoslav carrier Aeroput introduced a route linking the city with the capital, Belgrade. A year later the route was extended to Thessaloniki in Greece, and further extended to Greek capital Athens in 1933. In 1935 Aeroput linked Skopje with Bitola and Niš, and also operated a longer international route linking Vienna and Thessaloniki through Zagreb, Belgrade and Skopje. After the Second World War, Aeroput was replaced by JAT Yugoslav Airlines, which linked Skopje to a number of domestic and international destinations until the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.

Skopje International Airport is in Petrovec, east of the city. Since 2008, it has been managed by the Turkish TAV Airports Holding and it can accommodate up to four million passengers per year. The annual traffic has constantly risen since 2008, reaching one million passengers in 2014.

Skopje&#x27;s airport has connections to several European cities, including Athens, Vienna, Bratislava, Zürich, Brussels, Oslo, Istanbul, London and Rome. It also maintains a direct connection with Dubai and Doha, Qatar.

==Culture==

===Cultural institutions===

Skopje is home to the largest cultural institutions of the country, such as the National and University Library &quot;St. Kliment of Ohrid&quot;, the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, the National Theatre, the National Philharmonic Orchestra and the Macedonian Opera and Ballet. Amongst the local institutions are the Brothers Miladinov Library which has more than a million documents, the Cultural Information Centre which manages festivals, exhibitions and concerts, and the House of Culture Kočo Racin which is dedicated to contemporary art and young talents.

Skopje has also several foreign cultural centres, such as a , a British Council, an Alliance française, an American Corner.

The city has several theatres and concert halls. The Univerzalna Sala, seating 1,570, was built in 1966 and is used for concerts, fashion shows, and congresses. The Metropolis Arena, designed for large concerts, has 3,546 seats. Other large halls include the Macedonian Opera and Ballet (800 seats), the National Theatre (724), and the Drama Theatre (333). Other smaller venues exist, such as the Albanian Theatre and the Youth Theatre. A Turkish Theatre and a Philharmonic hall are under construction.

===Museums===

The largest museum in Skopje is the Museum of the Republic of North Macedonia which details the history of the country. Its icons and lapidary collections are particularly rich. The Macedonian Archeological Museum, opened in 2014, keeps some of the best archeological finds in North Macedonia, dating from Prehistory to the Ottoman period. The National Gallery of Macedonia exhibits paintings dating from the 14th to the 20th century in two former hammams of the Old Bazaar. The Contemporary Art Museum was built after the 1963 earthquake thanks to international assistance. Its collections include Macedonian and foreign art, with works by Fernand Léger, André Masson, Pablo Picasso, Hans Hartung, Victor Vasarely, Alexander Calder, Pierre Soulages, Alberto Burri and Christo.

The Skopje City Museum is inside the remains of the old railway station, destroyed by the 1963 earthquake. It is dedicated to local history and it has four departments: archeology, ethnology, history, and art history. The Memorial House of Mother Teresa was built in 2009 on the original site of the church in which the nun had been baptised. The Museum of the Macedonian Struggle is dedicated to the modern national history and the struggle of Macedonians for their independence. Nearby is the Holocaust Memorial Center for the Jews of Macedonia. The Macedonian Museum of Natural History showcases some 4,000 items whilst the 12-ha Skopje Zoo is home to 300 animals.

===Architecture===

Although Skopje has been destroyed many times throughout its history, it still has many historical landmarks which reflect the successive occupations of the city. Skopje has one of the biggest Ottoman urban complexes in Europe, with many Ottoman monuments still serving their original purpose. It was also a ground for modernist experiments in the 20th century, following the 1963 earthquake. At the beginning of the 21st century, it is again the subject of massive building campaigns, thanks to the &quot;Skopje 2014&quot; project. Skopje is thus an environment where old, new, progressist, reactionary, eastern and western perspectives coexist.
Skopje has some remains of Prehistorical architecture which can be seen on the Tumba Madžari Neolithic site. On the other side of the city lie the remains of the ancient Scupi, with ruins of a theatre, thermae and a basilica. The Skopje Aqueduct, between Scupi and the city centre, is rather mysterious because its date of construction is unknown. It seems to have been built by the Byzantines or the Turks, but it was already out of use in the 16th century. It consists of 50 arches, worked in cloisonné masonry.
Skopje Fortress was rebuilt several times before it was destroyed by the 1963 earthquake. Since then, it has been restored to its medieval appearance. It is the only medieval monument in Skopje, but several churches around the city illustrate the Vardar architectural school which flourished around 1300. Amongst these churches are the ones around Matka Canyon (St Nicholas, St Andrew and Matka churches). The church of Saint Panteleimon in Gorno Nerezi dates from the 12th century. Its expressive frescoes anticipate the Italian primitives.

Examples of Ottoman architecture are in the Old Bazaar. Mosques in Skopje are usually simple in design, with a square base and a single dome and minaret. Their entrance is usually emphasised by a portico, as on Mustafa Pasha Mosque, dating from the 15th century. Some mosques show some originality in their appearance: Sultan Murad and Yahya Pasha mosques have lost their dome and have a pyramidal roof, whilst Isa Bey mosque has a rectangular base, two domes and two side wings. The Aladža Mosque was originally covered with blue faience, but it disappeared in the 1689 Great Fire. However, some tiles are still visible on the adjoining türbe. Other Ottoman public monuments include the 16th-century clock tower, a bedesten, three caravanserais, two hammams and the Stone Bridge, first mentioned in 1469.

The oldest churches in the city centre, the Ascension and St Dimitri churches, were built in the 18th century, after the 1689 Great Fire. They were both renovated in the 19th century. The Church of the Ascension is particularly small it is half-buried in order not to overlook neighbouring mosques. In the 19th century, several new churches were built, including the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary, which is a large three-nave building designed by Andrey Damyanov.
After 1912, when Skopje was annexed by Serbia, the city was drastically westernised. Wealthy Serbs built mansions and town houses such as the 1926 Ristiḱ Palace. The architecture of that time is very similar to the one of Central Europe, but some buildings are more creative, such as the Neo-Moorish Arab House and the Neo-Byzantine train station, both built in 1938. Modernism appeared as early as 1933 with the former Ethnographic Museum (today the City Gallery), designed by Milan Zloković. However, modernist architecture only fully developed in Skopje after the 1963 earthquake. The reconstruction of the city centre was partially planned by Japanese Kenzo Tange who designed the new train station. Macedonian architects also took part in the reconstruction: Georgi Konstantinovski designed the City Archives building in 1968 and the Hall of residence Goce Delčev in 1975, whilst Janko Konstantinov designed the Telecommunication Centre and the main post office (1974–1989). Slavko Brezovski designed the Church of St. Clement of Ohrid. These two buildings are noted for their originality although they are directly inspired by brutalism.

The reconstruction turned Skopje into a proper modernist city, with large blocks of flats, austere concrete buildings and scattered green spaces. The city centre was considered as a grey and unattractive place when local authorities unveiled the &quot;Skopje 2014&quot; project in 2010. It made plans to erect a large number of statues, fountains, bridges, and museums at a cost of about €500 million.

The project has generated controversy: critics have described the new landmark buildings as signs of reactionary historicist aesthetics. Also, the government has been criticised for its cost and the original lack of representation of national minorities in the coverage of its set of statues and memorials. However, representations of minorities have since been included amongst the monuments. The scheme is accused of turning Skopje to a theme park, which is viewed as nationalistic kitsch, and has made Skopje an example to see how national identities are constructed and how this construction is mirrored in the urban space.
===Festivals===
The Skopje Jazz Festival has been held annually in October since 1981. It is part of the European Jazz Network and the European Forum of World Wide Festivals. The artists&#x27; profiles include fusion, acid jazz, Latin jazz, smooth jazz, and avant-garde jazz. Ray Charles, Tito Puente, Gotan Project, Al Di Meola, Youssou N&#x27;Dour, amongst others, have performed at the festival. Another music festival in Skopje is the Blues and Soul Festival. It is a relatively new event in the Macedonian cultural scene that occurs every summer in early July. Past guests include Larry Coryell, Mick Taylor &amp; the All-Stars Blues Band, Candy Dulfer &amp; Funky Stuff, João Bosco, the Temptations, Tolo Marton Trio, Blues Wire, and Phil Guy.

The Skopje Cultural Summer Festival is a renowned cultural event that takes place in Skopje each year during the summer. The festival is a member of the International Festivals and Events Association (IFEA) and it includes musical concerts, operas, ballets, plays, art and photograph exhibitions, movies, and multimedia projects that gather 2,000 participants from around the world each year including the St Petersburg Theatre, the Chamber Orchestra of the Bolshoi Theatre, Irina Arkhipova, Viktor Tretiakov, The Theatre of Shadows, Michel Dalberto, and David Burgess.

May Opera Evenings is a festival that has occurred annually in Skopje since 1972 and is dedicated to promoting opera amongst the general public. Over the years, it has evolved into a stage on which artists from some 50 countries have performed. There is one other major international theatre festival that takes place each year at the end of September, the Young Open Theater Festival (MOT), which was organised for the first time in May 1976 by the Youth Cultural Center – Skopje. More than 700 theatrical performances have been presented at this festival so far, most of them being alternative, experimental theatre groups engaging young writers and actors. The MOT International Theatre Festival is also a member of the International Network for Contemporary Performing Arts or IETM. Within the framework of the MOT Festival, the Macedonian National Center of the International Theater Institute (ITI) was established, and at the 25th ITI World Congress in Munich in 1993, it became a regular member of this theatre association. The festival has an international character, always representing theatres from all over the world that present and enhance the exchange and circulation of young-fresh-experimental-avant-garde theatrical energy and experience between its participants on one side and the audience on the other.

The Skopje Film Festival is an annual event held in the city every March. Over 50 films are shown at this five-day festival, mostly from North Macedonia and Europe, but also including some non-commercial film productions from all over the world.

===Nightlife===

Skopje has a diverse nightlife. There is a large emphasis on casinos, many of which are associated with hotels. In 2010, the Colosseum club was named fifth on a list of the best clubs in South-eastern Europe. Armin van Buuren, Above and Beyond, The Shapeshifters are just some of the many musicians that have visited the club. Nighttime concerts in local, regional and global music are often held at the Toše Proeski Arena and Boris Trajkovski Sports Center. For middle-aged people, places for having fun are also the &quot;kafeanas&quot; where traditional Macedonian food is served and traditional Macedonian music (&quot;Starogradska muzika&quot;) is played, but music from all the Balkans, particularly Serbian folk music is also popular. Apart from the traditional Macedonian restaurants, there are restaurants featuring international cuisines. The Old Bazaar was a popular nightlife destination in the past. The national government has created a project to revive nightlife in the Old Bazaar. The closing time in shops, cafés and restaurants was extended due to the high attendances recorded. In the bazaar&#x27;s restaurants, along with the traditional Macedonian wine and food, dishes of the Ottoman cuisine are also served.

<text>Speed metal is a subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots. It is described by AllMusic as &quot;extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding&quot; music.

It is usually considered less abrasive and more melodic than thrash metal. However, speed metal is usually faster and more aggressive than traditional heavy metal, also showing more inclination to virtuoso soloing and featuring short instrumental passages between couplets. Speed metal songs frequently make use of highly expressive vocals, but are usually less likely to employ &quot;harsh&quot; vocals than thrash metal songs.

==Origins==

===New wave of British heavy metal===
One of the key influences on the development of speed metal was the new wave of British heavy metal, or NWOBHM. This was a heavy metal movement that started in the late 1970s in Britain and achieved international attention by the early 1980s. NWOBHM bands toned down the blues influences of earlier acts, incorporated elements of punk, increased the tempo, and adopted a &quot;tougher&quot; sound, taking a harder approach to their music.

It was an era directed almost exclusively at heavy metal fans and is considered to be a major foundation stone for the extreme metal genres.

The NWOBHM came to dominate the heavy metal scene of the early-mid-1980s. It was musically characterised by fast upbeat tempo songs, power chords, fast guitar solos and melodic, soaring vocals. Groups such as Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Venom, Saxon and Motörhead as well as many lesser-known ones, became part of the canon that influenced American bands that formed in the early eighties.

===Other metal influences===

Motörhead is often credited as the first band to play speed metal in the mid-1970s. The Sweet released &quot;Sweet F.A.&quot; and &quot;Set Me Free&quot; in April 1974 which heavily influenced speed metal later in the decade. Some of speed metal&#x27;s earlier influences include Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Children of the Grave&quot; and &quot;Symptom of the Universe&quot;, Budgie&#x27;s &quot;Breadfan&quot; and Queen&#x27;s &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; (the latter two were eventually covered by the thrash metal band Metallica), as well as certain Deep Purple songs such as &quot;Speed King&quot;, &quot;Fireball&quot; and &quot;Highway Star&quot;. The latter was called &quot;early speed metal&quot; by Robb Reiner of speed metal band Anvil.

==History==
The origin of the genre&#x27;s name is the aptly named &quot;Speed King&quot; by Deep Purple. Recording on the song started in 1969 making it nearly a full decade ahead of the musical style being recognised. The song is not only very fast and technical but was also extremely loud creating noticeable distortion in the recording process. The title song for the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Fireball&quot;, is a further refinement of the band&#x27;s influence with drummer Ian Paice&#x27;s use of the double bass drum. The way the double bass drum is played in &quot;Fireball&quot;—uptempo &quot;four on the floor&quot;—became a mainstay in many heavy, speed and thrash metal songs in the years that followed.

This is the only Deep Purple song that employs the double bass drum, and the video from the band shows them actually bring out the second bass as needed to play the song. While speedy, technical playing did not dominate Deep Purple&#x27;s music, they clearly were the inventors of rock that was fast, technical and loud. Those characteristics would become the hallmarks of speed metal. The name of the origin song, &quot;Speed King&quot; would have also played a role in the genre&#x27;s naming. At the very least, the band acknowledged what they were doing which was a radical departure from all prior rock music.

Black Sabbath are a British heavy metal band from Birmingham, England, and are often cited as one of the grandfathers of the genre. Though usually known for playing a fairly slow, sludgy tempo, &quot;After Forever&quot; is a very up-tempo song with a much faster pace than other songs in their catalogue. Still in certain other songs such as &quot;Electric Funeral&quot;, &quot;Into the Void&quot; and &quot;Under the Sun (Every Day Comes and Goes)&quot; there is a section in the middle of the song that shifts away from the core music and plays a much faster pace than in the rest of the song, then returns to the original melody. There are those who believe that their song &quot;Symptom of the Universe&quot; from their 1975 release &quot;Sabotage&quot; album is the first true example of a speed metal song.

Judas Priest are a British heavy metal band, also formed in Birmingham, England, that often played faster than most rock groups of the time and brought a more &quot;metallic&quot; sound to the guitars. Some songs, such as 1978&#x27;s &quot;Exciter&quot;, were groundbreaking for their sheer ferocity and speed; few, if any, bands exempting Motörhead played with the same tempo.

Exciter (who took their name from the aforementioned Judas Priest song) is a Canadian speed metal band from Ottawa, Ontario, which was formed in 1978. They are widely considered to be one of the first speed metal bands and a seminal influence of the thrash metal genre. Anvil are another Canadian speed metal band from Toronto, Ontario, who also formed in 1978. To date, the band has released seventeen studio albums, and has been cited as having influenced many notable thrash metal groups, including Metallica, Anthrax, Slayer and Megadeth.

Accept is a German heavy metal band which played an important role in the development of speed and thrash metal, being part of the German heavy metal scene, which emerged in the early to mid-1980s. Of particular importance was their 1982 track &quot;Fast as a Shark&quot;.

Speed metal eventually evolved into thrash metal. Although many tend to equate the two subgenres, others argue that there is a distinct difference between them. In his book &quot;Sound of the Beast: The Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal&quot;, Ian Christe states that &quot;...thrash metal relies more on long, wrenching rhythmic breaks, while speed metal... is a cleaner and more musically intricate subcategory, still loyal to the dueling melodies of classic metal.&quot; However, on the very next page, Christe calls speed metal a &quot;subset of thrash metal&quot; and argues that &quot;There was little intrinsic difference between speed metal and thrash metal. With the sudden boom of fast, raging bands, however, it sometimes helped to distinguish between the throbbing, rhythm-heavy thrash metal and something a bit cleaner and more melodic--dubbed speed metal.&quot;
Some may argue that first wave black metal bands such as Venom, Sodom, and Bathory were speed metal and that black metal evolved as an extreme form of speed metal. Speed metal also played a major role in formation of power metal, with Helloween&#x27;s, one of the &quot;big four&quot; of power metal, first two albums being speed metal, or speed-metal adjacent, in the case of Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I.

==Regional differences==
Speed metal&#x27;s sound varied between various regional scenes. European bands leaned towards the sound of bands like Venom and Motörhead. Japanese bands had a more melodic sound that resembled power metal. North American bands had a faster, more aggressive sound that would later influence the thrash metal movement.

<doc id="29630" wikidata="Q3025760" url="?curid=29630" title="Stan Rogers">
<text>Stanley Allison Rogers (November 29, 1949 – June 2, 1983) was a Canadian folk musician and songwriter who sang traditional-sounding songs frequently inspired by Canadian history and the working people&#x27;s daily lives, especially from the fishing villages of the Maritime provinces and, later, the farms of the Canadian prairies and Great Lakes. He died in a fire aboard Air Canada Flight 797, grounded at the Greater Cincinnati Airport, at the age of 33.

==Early life and musical development==
Rogers was born in Hamilton, Ontario, the eldest son of Nathan Allison Rogers and Valerie (née Bushell) Rogers, two Maritimers who had relocated to Ontario in search of work shortly after their marriage in July 1948. Although Rogers was raised in Binbrook, Ontario, he often spent summers visiting family in Guysborough County, Nova Scotia.

It was there that he became familiar with the way of life in the Maritimes, an influence which was to have a profound impact on his subsequent musical development. He was interested in music from an early age, reportedly beginning to sing shortly after learning to speak. He received his first guitar, a miniature hand-built by his uncle Lee Bushell, when he was five years of age. He was exposed to a variety of music influences, but among the most lasting were the country and western tunes his uncles would sing during family get-togethers. Throughout his childhood, he would practice his singing and playing along with his brother Garnet, six years his junior.

While Rogers was attending Saltfleet High School, Stoney Creek, Ontario, he started to meet other young people interested in folk music, although at this time he was dabbling in rock and roll, singing and playing bass guitar in garage bands such as &quot;Stanley and the Living Stones&quot; and &quot;The Hobbits&quot;. After high school, Rogers briefly attended both McMaster University and Trent University, where he performed in small venues with other student musicians, including Ian Tamblyn, Chris Ward and fellow Hobbit Nigel Russell. Russell wrote the song &quot;White Collar Holler&quot;, which Rogers sang frequently on stage.

Rogers signed with RCA Records in 1970 and recorded two singles: &quot;Here&#x27;s to You Santa Claus&quot; in 1970, and &quot;The Fat Girl Rag&quot; in 1971. In 1973, Rogers recorded three singles for Polygram: &quot;Three Pennies&quot;, &quot;Guysborough Train&quot;, and &quot;Past Fifty.&quot;

In 1976, Rogers recorded his debut album, &quot;Fogarty&#x27;s Cove&quot;, released in 1977 on Barnswallow Records. The album&#x27;s subject matter dealt almost entirely with life in maritime Canada, and was an immediate success. Rogers then formed Fogarty&#x27;s Cove Music, and bought Barnswallow during the production of &quot;Turnaround&quot;, allowing him to release his own albums. Posthumously, additional albums were released.

Sung in his rich baritone, Rogers&#x27; songs are often said to have a &quot;Celtic&quot; feel which is due, in part, to his frequent use of DADGAD guitar tuning. He regularly used his William &#x27;Grit&#x27; Laskin-built 12-string guitar in his performances. His best-known songs include &quot;Northwest Passage&quot;, &quot;Barrett&#x27;s Privateers&quot;, &quot;The Mary Ellen Carter&quot;, &quot;Make and Break Harbour&quot;, &quot;The Idiot&quot;, &quot;Fogarty&#x27;s Cove&quot;, and &quot;White Squall&quot;.

==Death==
Rogers died alongside 22 other passengers most likely of smoke inhalation on June 2, 1983, while travelling on Air Canada Flight 797 (a McDonnell Douglas DC-9) after performing at the Kerrville Folk Festival. The airliner was flying from Dallas, Texas, to Toronto and Montreal when a fire from an unknown ignition source within the vanity or toilet shroud of the aft washroom forced it to make an emergency landing at the Greater Cincinnati Airport in northern Kentucky. There were initially no visible flames, and after attempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful, smoke filled the cabin. Upon landing, the plane&#x27;s doors were opened, allowing the five crew and 18 of the 41 passengers to escape, but approximately 90 seconds into the evacuation the oxygen rushing in from outside caused a flash fire.

Soon after his death, legends began to circulate about Rogers&#x27; final moments. Amber Frost claimed:

These legends are verifiably false, as the National Transportation Safety Board ran a full investigation of the incident and interviewed every single survivor, and there is no firsthand account, official or unofficial, of such an occurrence. Stan Rogers most likely died before the doors were even opened, due to smoke inhalation from the fire. Regardless, the circumstances of Rogers&#x27; death still circulate as folklore. As his official biographer Christopher Gudgeon writes:

His ashes were scattered off the north-eastern shore of Nova Scotia, Canada.

==Legacy==

Rogers&#x27; legacy includes his recordings, songbook, and plays for which he was commissioned to write music. His songs are still frequently covered by other musicians, including children&#x27;s performer Raffi on his 1977 out-of-print album Adult Entertainment, and are perennial favourites at Canadian campfires and song circles. Members of Rogers&#x27; band, including his brother Garnet Rogers, continue to be active performers and form a significant part of the fabric of contemporary Canadian folk music. Following his death, he was nominated for the 1984 Juno Awards in the category for Best Male Vocalist. That same year, he was posthumously awarded the Diplôme d’Honneur of the Canadian Conference of the Arts. In 1994, his posthumous live album &quot;Home in Halifax&quot; was likewise nominated for Best Roots and Traditional Album.

His widow, Ariel, continues to oversee his estate and legacy. His music and lyrics have been featured in numerous written publications and films. For instance, his lyrics have appeared in school poetry books, taking their place alongside acknowledged classics. His song &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; was featured in the last episode of the TV show &quot;Due South&quot;, his songs &quot;Barrett&#x27;s Privateers&quot; and &quot;Watching the Apples Grow&quot; having been previously featured. &quot;Barrett&#x27;s Privateers&quot; has also been used extensively in promotion ads for Alexander Keith&#x27;s ale. In the 2005 CTV made-for-TV movie on the life of Terry Fox, Rogers&#x27; &quot;Turnaround&quot; is the music over the closing shot. As the movie ends, Fox is depicted, alone, striding up a hill, while the lyric &quot;And yours was the open road. The bitter song / The heavy load that I&#x27;ll never share, tho&#x27; the offer&#x27;s still there / Every time you turn around,&quot; forges a link between these Canadian icons. Many of his songs on the albums &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; and &quot;From Fresh Water&quot; refer to events in Canadian history.

Adrienne Clarkson, who, prior to serving as the Governor General of Canada from 1999 to 2005, had worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, highlighted Rogers&#x27; career in a 1989 television documentary called &quot;One Warm Line&quot; on CBC Television; she also quoted Rogers in her investitural address.

When CBC&#x27;s Peter Gzowski asked Canadians to pick an alternate national anthem, &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; was the overwhelming choice.

The Stan Rogers Folk Festival is held every year in Canso, Nova Scotia. In 1995, several artists performed two nights of concerts at Halifax&#x27;s Rebecca Cohn Auditorium, which were released on album that year as &quot;Remembering Stan Rogers&quot;, which peaked at number 36 on the &quot;RPM&quot; Country Albums chart.

Rogers is also a lasting fixture of the Canadian folk festival Summerfolk, held annually in Owen Sound, Ontario, where the main stage and amphitheater are dedicated as the &quot;Stan Rogers Memorial Canopy&quot;. The festival is firmly fixed in tradition, with Rogers&#x27; song &quot;The Mary Ellen Carter&quot; being sung by all involved, including the audience and a medley of acts at the festival.

At The Canmore Folk Festival, Alberta&#x27;s longest running folk music festival, performers take to the Stan Rogers Memorial Stage, which is the festival&#x27;s main stage.

Stan&#x27;s son, Nathan Rogers, is also an established Canadian folk artist with a voice and lyrical acumen similar to his father&#x27;s. He has released two critically acclaimed solo albums and tours internationally as a solo act and in the trio Dry Bones.

On his 2006 album &quot;Writing In The Margins&quot;, American folk musician John Gorka covered Rogers&#x27; song &quot;The Lockkeeper&quot;. &quot;That&#x27;s How Legends Are Made,&quot; a song from Gorka&#x27;s 1990 album &quot;Land of The Bottom Line&quot;, is also a tribute to Rogers.

In 2007, Rogers was recognized posthumously with a National Achievement Award at the annual SOCAN Awards held in Toronto.

Canadian Celtic rock band Enter the Haggis regularly performs a cover of “White Squall” to end their shows, and included it on their 2011 album &quot;Whitelake&quot;.

In 2011, the pirate metal band Alestorm released a cover of Rogers&#x27; song &quot;Barrett&#x27;s Privateers&quot; (Label Napalm Records).

In 2013, Groundwood Books turned Rogers&#x27; song &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; into a children&#x27;s book illustrated by award-winning artist Matt James.

In 2017, Canadian Celtic punk band The Real McKenzies released a cover of Rogers&#x27; &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; on their album &quot;Two Devils Will Talk.&quot;

In 2019, Canadian metal band Unleash the Archers released a cover of Rogers&#x27; &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; on Napalm Records.

In 2019, Canadian folk punk band The Dreadnoughts released a cover of Rogers&#x27; &quot;Northwest Passage&quot;, as well as a commemorative song named &quot;Dear Old Stan&quot;, on Stomp Records.

In 2020, Canadian Premier League soccer club HFX Wanderers FC&#x27;s home kit featured a soundwave image taken from Rogers&#x27; &quot;Barrett&#x27;s Privateers&quot;, inspired in part by the song&#x27;s adoption by Privateers 1882, a supporters group of the Wanderers.

In 2022 , The Longest Johns released a cover of Rogers&#x27; &quot;The Mary Ellen Carter&quot; on their album &quot;Smoke and Oakum&quot;.
In 2023, The Longest Johns and El Pony Pisador released a cover of Rogers&#x27; &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; as part of their collaborative EP &quot;The Longest Pony&quot;.

==Band==
While occasionally performing or recording solo, Rogers typically worked with other musicians. 

Early in his career, he was accompanied live by guitarist Nigel Russell. 

In 1973 his brother, Garnet Rogers, joined as principal sideman and co-arranger. For the next 10 years, they performed live as a trio, joined by a succession of bassists, including Jim Ogilvie, David Woodhead, David Alan Eadie and Jim Morison. 

This live trio was occasionally augmented by other musicians, as at a string of shows recorded for the 1979 live album Between the Breaks ... Live!, and a 1983 CBC radio broadcast (later released as Home in Halifax). 

His studio albums typically featured the live trio augmented by a mix of studio musicians and special guests, with the exception of the 1983 album For the Family, which featured the unaccompanied trio, who also self-produced the album.

<text>Sacramento ( ; ; ) is the capital city of the U.S. state of California and the seat of Sacramento County. Located at the confluence of the Sacramento and American Rivers in Northern California&#x27;s Sacramento Valley, Sacramento&#x27;s 2020 population of 524,943 makes it the fourth-most populous city in Northern California, the sixth-most populous in the state, the ninth-most populous state capital, and the 35th most populous in the United States. Sacramento is the seat of the California Legislature and the governor of California. Sacramento is also the cultural and economic core of the Greater Sacramento area, which at the 2020 census had a population of 2,680,831, the fourth-largest metropolitan area in California.

Before the arrival of the Spanish, the area was inhabited by the Nisenan, Maidu, and other indigenous peoples of California. In 1808, Spanish cavalryman Gabriel Moraga surveyed and named the &quot;Río del Santísimo Sacramento&quot; (Sacramento River), after the Blessed Sacrament. In 1839, Juan Bautista Alvarado, Mexican governor of Alta California, granted the responsibility of colonizing the Sacramento Valley to Swiss-born Mexican citizen John Augustus Sutter, who subsequently established Sutter&#x27;s Fort and the settlement at the &quot;Rancho Nueva Helvetia.&quot; Following the American Conquest of California and the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, the waterfront developed by Sutter began to be developed and incorporated in 1850 as the City of Sacramento. In 1852, the city offered its county courthouse to the state of California to house the state legislature, resulting in the city becoming the permanent state capital in 1854 and ushering in the construction of a new state capitol building which was finished in 1874.

Sacramento is the fastest-growing major city in California, owing to its status as a notable political center on the West Coast and as a major educational hub, home of California State University, Sacramento and UC Davis. Similarly, Sacramento is a major center for the California healthcare industry, as the seat of Sutter Health, UC Davis Medical Center, and the UC Davis School of Medicine. In 2013, the Sacramento Convention and Visitors Bureau stated that the city receives 15.3 million visitors per year, and is home to the California Museum, Crocker Art Museum, California State Railroad Museum, California State Capitol Museum, the Sacramento Convention Center Complex, and Old Sacramento State Historic Park.

== History ==

=== Pre-Columbian period ===

Nisenan (Southern Maidu), Modoc, and Plains Miwok American Indians have lived in the area for perhaps thousands of years. Until the settlers arrived who would eventually make Sacramento their home, these tribes left little evidence of their existence. Their diet was dominated by acorns taken from the plentiful oak trees in the region and by fruits, bulbs, seeds, and roots gathered throughout the year.

=== Spanish period ===
In 1808, the Spanish explorer Gabriel Moraga encountered and named the Sacramento Valley and the Sacramento River. A Spanish writer with the Moraga expedition wrote:

Canopies of oaks and cottonwoods, many festooned with grapevines, overhung both sides of the blue current. Birds chattered in the trees and big fish darted through the pellucid depths. The air was like champagne, and (&quot;the Spaniards)&quot; drank deep of it, drank in the beauty around them. &quot;¡Es como el sagrado sacramento! (It&#x27;s like the Blessed Sacrament.)&quot;

The valley and the river were then christened after the &quot;Most Holy Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ,&quot; referring to the Catholic sacrament of the Eucharist.

=== Mexican period ===
John Sutter Sr. first arrived in the area on August 13, 1839, at the confluence of the American and Sacramento Rivers with a Mexican land grant of . The next year, he and his party established Sutter&#x27;s Fort, a massive adobe structure with walls high and thick.

Representing Mexico, Sutter Sr. called his colony New Helvetia, a Swiss-inspired name, and was the political authority and dispenser of justice in the new settlement. Soon, the colony began to grow as more and more pioneers headed west. Within just a few short years, Sutter Sr. had become a grand success, owning a orchard and a herd of 13,000 cattle. Fort Sutter became a regular stop for the increasing number of immigrants coming through the valley. In 1847, Sutter Sr. received 2,000 fruit trees, which started the agriculture industry in the Sacramento Valley. Later that year, Sutter Sr. hired James Marshall to build a sawmill so he could continue to expand his empire, but unbeknownst to many, Sutter Sr.&#x27;s &quot;empire&quot; had been built on thin margins of credit.

=== American period ===

In 1848, when James W. Marshall discovered gold at Sutter&#x27;s Mill in Coloma (some northeast of the fort), numerous gold-seekers came to the area, increasing the population. In August 1848, Sutter Sr.&#x27;s son, John Sutter Jr., arrived to assist his father in reducing his debt. The Sutters struggled to contain the effects of thousands of new gold miners and prospectors in the area, many of whom squatted on unwatched portions of the vast Sutter lands or stole various unattended Sutter properties or belongings. For Sutter, his employee&#x27;s discovery of gold in the area turned out to be a bane.

By December 1848, John Sutter Jr., in association with Samuel Brannan, began laying out the City of Sacramento, south of his father&#x27;s settlement of New Helvetia. This venture was undertaken against the wishes of Sutter Sr., but the father, being deeply in debt, was unable to stop it. For commercial reasons, the new city was named &quot;Sacramento City&quot; after the Sacramento River. Sutter Jr. and Brannan had United States Army Captain William H. Warner assigned to draft the official layout of the city, which included 26 lettered and 31 numbered streets (today&#x27;s grid from C St. to Broadway and from Front St. to Alhambra Blvd.) Relations between Sutter and his son became embittered after Sacramento became an overnight commercial success. (Sutter&#x27;s Fort, Mill, and the town of Sutterville, all founded by John Sutter Sr., eventually failed).

Residents of Sacramento adopted a city charter in 1849, which was recognized by the state legislature in 1850. Sacramento is the oldest incorporated city in California, incorporated on February 27, 1850.

On January 10, 1850, a flood occurred that devastated the city. The rushing waters uprooted homes and drowned livestock. The city was almost destroyed. Due to the efforts of Hardin Bigelow, Sacramento&#x27;s first elected mayor, the construction of the city&#x27;s first levee was completed in early 1852 (the city became known as &quot;The Levee City&quot;). However, a month after it was completed, it was breached during the first major storm of the season and the city flooded again. A new levee was built for $50,000, but it also broke, causing more flooding of the city. Between October and December 1850, Sacramento was hit with a cholera epidemic that killed 1,000 residents, including Mayor Bigelow and 17 of the city&#x27;s 40 physicians. Up to 80 percent of the populace left town. On November 2, 1852, a fire known as the Great Conflagration burned more than 80 percent of the structures in the city. It is estimated that the total damage was around six million dollars. Within a month 761 structures were re-built, many of them in brick. In spite of all these hardships the new city&#x27;s location just downstream from the Mother Lode in the Sierra Nevada proved irresistible, and it grew rapidly during the early 1850s, attracting a population of 10,000. The Great Flood of 1862 from December 1861 to January 1862 caused the worst flooding in Sacramento&#x27;s history. In 1861, Governor Leland Stanford, who was inaugurated in early January 1862, traveled to his inauguration in a rowboat.

The California State Legislature, with the support of Governor John Bigler, moved to Sacramento in 1854. The capital of California under Spanish (and, subsequently, Mexican) rule had been Monterey, where, in 1849, the first Constitutional Convention and state elections were held. The convention decided San Jose would be the new state&#x27;s capital. From California&#x27;s statehood beginning September 9, 1850 through 1851, the legislature met in San Jose. It moved to Vallejo in 1852 and Benicia in 1853, before ending up in Sacramento in 1854. During the 1850s the city was consolidated with the County of Sacramento. In the Sacramento Constitutional Convention of 1879, Sacramento was named the permanent state capital.

The Classical Revival-style California State Capitol, similar to the national Capitol, was started in 1860 and completed in 1874. In 1861, the legislative session was moved to the Merchants Exchange Building in San Francisco for one session because of the massive flooding in Sacramento. From 1862 to 1868, part of the Leland Stanford Mansion was used for the governor&#x27;s offices during Stanford&#x27;s tenure as the Governor; and the legislature met in the Sacramento County Courthouse. The legislative chambers were first occupied in 1869, while construction continued around them.

With its new status and strategic location, Sacramento quickly prospered. It was designated as the western terminus of the Pony Express. Later it became a terminus of the First transcontinental railroad, which began construction in Sacramento in 1863 and was financed by &quot;The Big Four&quot;—Mark Hopkins, Charles Crocker, Collis P. Huntington, and Leland Stanford. Both the American and especially Sacramento rivers were key elements in the economic success of the city. Sacramento effectively controlled commerce on these rivers, and public works projects were funded through taxes levied on goods unloaded from boats and loaded onto rail cars in the historic Sacramento Rail Yards.

From 1862 until the mid-1870s, Sacramento raised the level of its downtown by building reinforced brick walls on its downtown streets and filling the resulting street walls with dirt. The previous first floors of buildings became basements, with open space between the street and the building, previously the sidewalk, now at the basement level. Over the years, many of these underground spaces have been filled or destroyed by subsequent development. However, it is still possible to view portions of the &quot;Sacramento Underground&quot;.

=== Modern era ===
The city&#x27;s current charter was adopted by voters in 1920. As a charter city, Sacramento is exempt from many laws and regulations passed by the state legislature. The city has expanded continuously over the years. The 1964 merger of the City of North Sacramento with Sacramento substantially increased its population, and large annexations of the Natomas area eventually led to significant population growth throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.

Sacramento County (along with a portion of adjacent Placer County) is served by a customer-owned electric utility, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD). Sacramento voters approved the creation of SMUD in 1923. In April 1946, after 12 years of litigation, a judge ordered Pacific Gas &amp; Electric to transfer the title of Sacramento&#x27;s electric distribution system to SMUD. Today SMUD is the sixth-largest public electric utility in the U.S. and is a leader in innovative programs and services, including the development of clean fuel resources, such as solar power.

The year following the creation of SMUD, 1924, brought several events in Sacramento: Standard Oil executive Verne McGeorge established McGeorge School of Law, American department store Weinstock &amp; Lubin opened a new store at 12th and K street, the US$2 million Senator Hotel was opened, Sacramento&#x27;s drinking water became filtered and treated drinking water, and Sacramento boxer Georgie Lee fought Francisco Guilledo, a Filipino professional boxer known as Pancho Villa, at L Street Auditorium on March 21.

Early in World War II, the Sacramento Assembly Center (also known as the Walerga Assembly Center) was established to house Japanese Americans forcibly &quot;evacuated&quot; from the West Coast under Executive Order 9066. The camp was one of fifteen temporary detention facilities where over 110,000 Japanese Americans, two-thirds of them U.S. citizens, were held while construction on the more permanent War Relocation Authority camps was completed. The assembly center was built on the site of a former migrant labor camp, and inmates began arriving from Sacramento and San Joaquin Counties on May 6, 1942. It closed after only 52 days, on June 26, and the population of 4,739 was transferred to the Tule Lake concentration camp. The site was then turned over to the Army Signal Corps and dedicated as Camp Kohler.

After the war and the end of the incarceration program, returning Japanese Americans were often unable to find housing and so 234 families temporarily lived at the former assembly center. Camp Kohler was destroyed by a fire in December 1947, and the assembly center site is now part of the Foothill Farms-North Highlands subdivision.
The Sacramento-Yolo Port District was created in 1947, and the ground was broken on the Port of Sacramento in 1949.
On June 29, 1963, with 5,000 spectators waiting to welcome her, the Motor Vessel &quot;Taipei Victory&quot; arrived. The Nationalist Chinese flagship docked at the Port of Sacramento, being the first ocean-going vessel in Sacramento since the steamship &quot;Harpoon&quot; in 1934.

In 1967, Ronald Reagan became the last Governor of California to live permanently in the city. The 1980s and 1990s saw the closure of several local military bases: McClellan Air Force Base, Mather Air Force Base, and Sacramento Army Depot. In 1980, there was another flood. Despite military base closures and the decline of agricultural food processing, Sacramento has continued to experience population growth in recent years. Primary sources of population growth are an influx of residents from the nearby San Francisco Bay Area, as well as immigration from Asia and Latin America.

In 1985, Hugh Scrutton, a 38-year-old Sacramento, California, computer store owner, was killed by a nail-and-splinter-loaded bomb placed in the parking lot of his store. In 1996, his death was attributed to the Unabomber, Theodore Kaczynski.

After acquiring the majority stake in the Sacramento Kings, the team&#x27;s new owner, Vivek Ranadivé, with the help of the city, agreed to build a new arena in the downtown area. With a final estimated cost of $558.2 million, Sacramento&#x27;s Golden 1 Center opened on September 30, 2016.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city covers . 97.81% of it is land, and 2.19% of it is water.

Depth to groundwater is typically about . Much of the land to the west of the city (in Yolo County) is permanently reserved for a vast flood control basin (the Yolo Bypass), due to the city&#x27;s historical vulnerability to floods. As a result, the contiguous urban area sprawls only west of downtown (as West Sacramento, California) but northeast and east, into the Sierra Nevada foothills, and to the south into valley farmland.

The city is at the confluence of the Sacramento River and the American River and has a deep-water port connected to the San Francisco Bay by a channel through the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta. It is the shipping and rail center for the Sacramento Valley.

===Trees===
Sacramento has long been known as the &quot;City of Trees&quot; owing to its abundant urban forest. The city has more trees per capita than any other city in the world. The first recorded use of the term was in 1855, and it was popular by the early 20th century. It was not always so: it was at first called the &quot;City of Plains&quot; because of the lack of trees, but soon afterward there were cottonwood trees planted, and eucalyptus varieties were imported to dry out swampland. Later, locust trees, and willows were planted along streets, then elms, then palm trees, then fruit trees in the late 1910s. It was the first US city to be designated a City of Trees by the Arbor Day Foundation in 1978.

In the early 21st century, the tree cover is well above that of the average tree cover of other major cities in the United States and the rest of the world, with the main species being the London plane. Other species are being introduced to increase diversity and to help cope with the effects of climate change on vegetation in the future. Treepedia, a project run by MIT using Google Maps&#x27; street-view data to calculate tree coverage in cities, ranked Sacramento the greenest city of 15 studied in the US, and third globally, after Vancouver and Singapore.

A prominent water tower bore the slogan &quot;City of Trees&quot; until 2017 when it was repainted with the words &quot;America&#x27;s Farm-to-Fork Capital&quot; (referring to the farm-to-fork movement, which promotes the consumption of locally-grown food). After 4,000 displeased citizens signed a petition protesting the change, officials agreed to include both slogans on the water tower.

==== Notable areas ====
=====Capitol Mall===== 
Capitol Mall connects West Sacramento and Downtown Sacramento. Some notable landmarks on this road include the Tower Bridge, Old Sacramento, and the California State Capitol Building. Capitol Mall is considered to be the business district of the city. Skyscrapers such as the Wells Fargo Center and U.S. Bank Tower, two of the tallest buildings in the city, are located on Capitol Mall and are home to several major companies. The street is also home to major festivals such as the annual Farm to Fork Festival.

Sacramento&#x27;s historic Japantown once occupied much of today&#x27;s Capitol Mall, spanning 4th street from K to P streets. The area suffered from the forced eviction of its Japanese residents during WW2 and never recovered, resulting in the remaining properties taken through eminent domain to create the grand promenade of today&#x27;s Capitol Mall. The Nisei Memorial Hall at 4th and Q remains the last remaining property associated with Sacramento&#x27;s former Japantown.

=====Downtown Commons=====
One of the newest districts in the city is Downtown Commons. Formerly home to the Downtown Plaza shopping mall, the district opened in 2016 along with Golden 1 Center. Downtown Commons, otherwise known as DOCO, is home to the Sawyer, a 16-story skyscraper with a 250-room hotel and 45 condominiums, a Macy&#x27;s anchor store, an IMAX theater, and retail space with a variety of restaurants and shops.

In addition, Downtown Sacramento is home to several hotels including the Citizen Hotel, housed in one of the first skyscrapers built in the city.

=====East Sacramento=====

East Sacramento is a neighborhood in between Midtown and Sacramento State. This neighborhood is well known for being home to McKinley Park and Rose Garden and the Fabulous Forties, home to some of the most expensive, largest, and architecturally unique homes in the city. East Sacramento was home to Ronald Reagan during his term as Governor of California and this neighborhood was prominently featured in Greta Gerwig&#x27;s film Lady Bird.

=====Historic Chinatown=====
The Opium Wars of the 1840s and 1850s, along with the California gold rush, brought many Chinese people to California. Most arrived at San Francisco, which was then the largest city in California and known as &quot;Daai Fau&quot; (). Some eventually came to Sacramento, then the second-largest city in California and consequently called &quot;Yee Fow&quot; (). Today the city is known as &quot; () by mainland Chinese and as &quot; &quot;Sāgāmíhndouh&quot; and &quot;Shājiāmiǎnduó&quot; by Cantonese speakers and Taiwanese respectively.Sacramento&#x27;s Chinatown was on &quot;I&quot; Street from Second to Sixth Streets, called the China Slough. At the time, this area of &quot;I&quot; Street was considered a health hazard because, lying within a levee zone, it was lower than other parts of the city, which were situated on higher land. Throughout Sacramento&#x27;s Chinatown history, there were fires, acts of discrimination, and prejudicial legislation such as the Chinese Exclusion Act that was not repealed until 1943. The mysterious fires were thought to be set off by those who resented the Chinese working class. Ordinances on what was viable building material were set into place to try to get the Chinese to move out. Newspapers such as The Sacramento Union wrote stories at the time that portrayed the Chinese in an unfavorable light to inspire ethnic discrimination and drive the Chinese away. While most of Sacramento&#x27;s Chinatown has now been razed, a small Chinatown mall remains as well as a museum dedicated to the history of Sacramento&#x27;s Chinatown.

=====Newton Booth Historic District=====
The Newton Booth Historic District, named for Newton Booth, is located on the southeast corner of Sacramento&#x27;s original 1848 street grid.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityofsacramento.org-Historic-District-Plans/Newton-Booth&quot;&gt;

Buildings have been preserved, restored, or reconstructed, and the district is now a substantial tourist attraction, with rides on steam-powered historic trains and horse-drawn carriages.

=====Poverty Ridge Historic District=====
The Poverty Ridge Historic District is within Sacramento&#x27;s original 1848 street grid and bounded to the west by 21st Street, to the north by S Street, to the east by 23rd Street, to the south by W Street and U.S. Route 50, and includes the block bounded by 20th Street, 21st Street, S Street, and T Street.

The Poverty Ridge Historic District was considered to be Sacramento&#x27;s wealthiest
neighborhood from 1868 to 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityofsacramento.org-Historic-District-Plans/Poverty-Ridge&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>The Sierpiński carpet is a plane fractal first described by Wacław Sierpiński in 1916. The carpet is a generalization of the Cantor set to two dimensions; another such generalization is the Cantor dust.

The technique of subdividing a shape into smaller copies of itself, removing one or more copies, and continuing recursively can be extended to other shapes. For instance, subdividing an equilateral triangle into four equilateral triangles, removing the middle triangle, and recursing leads to the Sierpiński triangle. In three dimensions, a similar construction based on cubes is known as the Menger sponge.

==Construction==
The construction of the Sierpiński carpet begins with a square. The square is cut into 9 congruent subsquares in a 3-by-3 grid, and the central subsquare is removed. The same procedure is then applied recursively to the remaining 8 subsquares, &quot;ad infinitum&quot;. It can be realised as the set of points in the unit square whose coordinates written in base three do not both have a digit &#x27;1&#x27; in the same position, using the infinitesimal number representation of formula_1.

The process of recursively removing squares is an example of a finite subdivision rule.

==Properties==
The area of the carpet is zero (in standard Lebesgue measure).
:Proof: Denote as the area of iteration . Then . So , which tends to 0 as goes to infinity.

The interior of the carpet is empty.
:Proof: Suppose by contradiction that there is a point in the interior of the carpet. Then there is a square centered at which is entirely contained in the carpet. This square contains a smaller square whose coordinates are multiples of for some . But, if this square has not been previously removed, it must have been holed in iteration , so it cannot be contained in the carpet – a contradiction.

The Hausdorff dimension of the carpet is formula_2.

Sierpiński demonstrated that his carpet is a universal plane curve. That is: the Sierpiński carpet is a compact subset of the plane with Lebesgue covering dimension 1, and every subset of the plane with these properties is homeomorphic to some subset of the Sierpiński carpet.

This &quot;universality&quot; of the Sierpiński carpet is not a true universal property in the sense of category theory: it does not uniquely characterize this space up to homeomorphism. For example, the disjoint union of a Sierpiński carpet and a circle is also a universal plane curve. However, in 1958 Gordon Whyburn uniquely characterized the Sierpiński carpet as follows: any curve that is locally connected and has no &#x27;local cut-points&#x27; is homeomorphic to the Sierpiński carpet. Here a local cut-point is a point for which some connected neighborhood of has the property that is not connected. So, for example, any point of the circle is a local cut point.

In the same paper Whyburn gave another characterization of the Sierpiński carpet. Recall that a continuum is a nonempty connected compact metric space. Suppose is a continuum embedded in the plane. Suppose its complement in the plane has countably many connected components and suppose:

* the diameter of goes to zero as ;
* the boundary of and the boundary of are disjoint if ;

==Brownian motion on the Sierpiński carpet==
The topic of Brownian motion on the Sierpiński carpet has attracted interest in recent years. Martin Barlow and Richard Bass have shown that a random walk on the Sierpiński carpet diffuses at a slower rate than an unrestricted random walk in the plane. The latter reaches a mean distance proportional to after steps, but the random walk on the discrete Sierpiński carpet reaches only a mean distance proportional to for some . They also showed that this random walk satisfies stronger large deviation inequalities (so called &quot;sub-Gaussian inequalities&quot;) and that it satisfies the elliptic Harnack inequality without satisfying the parabolic one. The existence of such an example was an open problem for many years.

==Wallis sieve==
A variation of the Sierpiński carpet, called the Wallis sieve, starts in the same way, by subdividing the unit square into nine smaller squares and removing the middle of them. At the next level of subdivision, it subdivides each of the squares into 25 smaller squares and removes the middle one, and it continues at the th step by subdividing each square into (the odd squares) smaller squares and removing the middle one. By the Wallis product, the area of the resulting set is , unlike the standard Sierpiński carpet which has zero limiting area. Although the Wallis sieve has positive Lebesgue measure, no subset that is a Cartesian product of two sets of real numbers has this property, so its Jordan measure is zero.

== Applications ==
Mobile phone and Wi-Fi fractal antennas have been produced in the form of few iterations of the Sierpiński carpet. Due to their self-similarity and scale invariance, they easily accommodate multiple frequencies. They are also easy to fabricate and smaller than conventional antennas of similar performance, thus being optimal for pocket-sized mobile phones.

<text>The Sierpiński triangle, also called the Sierpiński gasket or Sierpiński sieve, is a fractal with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles. Originally constructed as a curve, this is one of the basic examples of self-similar sets—that is, it is a mathematically generated pattern reproducible at any magnification or reduction. It is named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński but appeared as a decorative pattern many centuries before the work of Sierpiński.

== Constructions ==
There are many different ways of constructing the Sierpiński triangle.

=== Removing triangles ===
The Sierpiński triangle may be constructed from an equilateral triangle by repeated removal of triangular subsets:
# Start with an equilateral triangle.
# Subdivide it into four smaller congruent equilateral triangles and remove the central triangle.
# Repeat step 2 with each of the remaining smaller triangles infinitely.
Each removed triangle (a &quot;trema&quot;) is topologically an open set. This process of recursively removing triangles is an example of a finite subdivision rule.

=== Shrinking and duplication ===

The same sequence of shapes, converging to the Sierpiński triangle, can alternatively be generated by the following steps:
#Start with any triangle in a plane (any closed, bounded region in the plane will actually work). The canonical Sierpiński triangle uses an equilateral triangle with a base parallel to the horizontal axis (first image).
#Shrink the triangle to height and width, make three copies, and position the three shrunken triangles so that each triangle touches the two other triangles at a corner (image 2). Note the emergence of the central hole—because the three shrunken triangles can between them cover only of the area of the original. (Holes are an important feature of Sierpiński&#x27;s triangle.)
#Repeat step 2 with each of the smaller triangles (image 3 and so on).

This infinite process is not dependent upon the starting shape being a triangle—it is just clearer that way. The first few steps starting, for example, from a square also tend towards a Sierpiński triangle. Michael Barnsley used an image of a fish to illustrate this in his paper &quot;V-variable fractals and superfractals.&quot;
The actual fractal is what would be obtained after an infinite number of iterations. More formally, one describes it in terms of functions on closed sets of points. If we let &quot;d&quot;A denote the dilation by a factor of about a point A, then the Sierpiński triangle with corners A, B, and C is the fixed set of the transformation .

This is an attractive fixed set, so that when the operation is applied to any other set repeatedly, the images converge on the Sierpiński triangle. This is what is happening with the triangle above, but any other set would suffice.

=== Chaos game ===

If one takes a point and applies each of the transformations &quot;d&quot;A, &quot;d&quot;B, and &quot;d&quot;C to it randomly, the resulting points will be dense in the Sierpiński triangle, so the following algorithm will again generate arbitrarily close approximations to it:

Start by labeling p1, p2 and p3 as the corners of the Sierpiński triangle, and a random point v1. Set , where &quot;rn&quot; is a random number 1, 2 or 3. Draw the points v1 to v∞. If the first point v1 was a point on the Sierpiński triangle, then all the points v&quot;n&quot; lie on the Sierpiński triangle. If the first point v1 to lie within the perimeter of the triangle is not a point on the Sierpiński triangle, none of the points v&quot;n&quot; will lie on the Sierpiński triangle, however they will converge on the triangle. If v1 is outside the triangle, the only way v&quot;n&quot; will land on the actual triangle, is if v&quot;n&quot; is on what would be part of the triangle, if the triangle was infinitely large.

Or more simply:
# Take three points in a plane to form a triangle.
# Randomly select any point inside the triangle and consider that your current position.
# Randomly select any one of the three vertex points.
# Move half the distance from your current position to the selected vertex.
# Plot the current position.
# Repeat from step 3.

This method is also called the chaos game, and is an example of an iterated function system. You can start from any point outside or inside the triangle, and it would eventually form the Sierpiński Gasket with a few leftover points (if the starting point lies on the outline of the triangle, there are no leftover points). With pencil and paper, a brief outline is formed after placing approximately one hundred points, and detail begins to appear after a few hundred.

=== Arrowhead construction of Sierpiński gasket ===

Another construction for the Sierpiński gasket shows that it can be constructed as a curve in the plane. It is formed by a process of repeated modification of simpler curves, analogous to the construction of the Koch snowflake:
# Start with a single line segment in the plane
# Repeatedly replace each line segment of the curve with three shorter segments, forming 120° angles at each junction between two consecutive segments, with the first and last segments of the curve either parallel to the original line segment or forming a 60° angle with it.

At every iteration, this construction gives a continuous curve. In the limit, these approach a curve that traces out the Sierpiński triangle by a single continuous directed (infinitely wiggly) path, which is called the Sierpiński arrowhead. In fact, the aim of Sierpiński&#x27;s original article in 1915 was to show an example of a curve (a Cantorian curve), as the title of the article itself declares.

=== Cellular automata ===
The Sierpiński triangle also appears in certain cellular automata (such as Rule 90), including those relating to Conway&#x27;s Game of Life. For instance, the Life-like cellular automaton B1/S12 when applied to a single cell will generate four approximations of the Sierpiński triangle. A very long, one cell–thick line in standard life will create two mirrored Sierpiński triangles. The time-space diagram of a replicator pattern in a cellular automaton also often resembles a Sierpiński triangle, such as that of the common replicator in HighLife. The Sierpiński triangle can also be found in the Ulam-Warburton automaton and the Hex-Ulam-Warburton automaton.

===Pascal&#x27;s triangle===

If one takes Pascal&#x27;s triangle with formula_1 rows and colors the even numbers white, and the odd numbers black, the result is an approximation to the Sierpiński triangle. More precisely, the limit as approaches infinity of this parity-colored formula_1-row Pascal triangle is the Sierpiński triangle.

As the proportion of black numbers tends to zero with increasing &quot;n&quot;, a corollary is that the proportion of odd binomial coefficients tends to zero as &quot;n&quot; tends to infinity.

===Towers of Hanoi===
The Towers of Hanoi puzzle involves moving disks of different sizes between three pegs, maintaining the property that no disk is ever placed on top of a smaller disk. The states of an -disk puzzle, and the allowable moves from one state to another, form an undirected graph, the Hanoi graph, that can be represented geometrically as the intersection graph of the set of triangles remaining after the th step in the construction of the Sierpiński triangle. Thus, in the limit as goes to infinity, this sequence of graphs can be interpreted as a discrete analogue of the Sierpiński triangle.

==Properties==
For integer number of dimensions formula_3, when doubling a side of an object, formula_4 copies of it are created, i.e. 2 copies for 1-dimensional object, 4 copies for 2-dimensional object and 8 copies for 3-dimensional object. For the Sierpiński triangle, doubling its side creates 3 copies of itself. Thus the Sierpiński triangle has Hausdorff dimension formula_5, which follows from solving formula_6 for formula_3.

The area of a Sierpiński triangle is zero (in Lebesgue measure). The area remaining after each iteration is formula_8 of the area from the previous iteration, and an infinite number of iterations results in an area approaching zero.

The points of a Sierpiński triangle have a simple characterization in barycentric coordinates. If a point has barycentric coordinates formula_9, expressed as binary numerals, then the point is in Sierpiński&#x27;s triangle if and only if formula_10 for 

==Generalization to other moduli==
A generalization of the Sierpiński triangle can also be generated using Pascal&#x27;s triangle if a different modulus formula_11 is used. Iteration formula_12 can be generated by taking a Pascal&#x27;s triangle with formula_13 rows and coloring numbers by their value modulo formula_11. As formula_12 approaches infinity, a fractal is generated.

The same fractal can be achieved by dividing a triangle into a tessellation of formula_16 similar triangles and removing the triangles that are upside-down from the original, then iterating this step with each smaller triangle.

Conversely, the fractal can also be generated by beginning with a triangle and duplicating it and arranging formula_17 of the new figures in the same orientation into a larger similar triangle with the vertices of the previous figures touching, then iterating that step.

==Analogues in higher dimensions==

The Sierpiński tetrahedron or tetrix is the three-dimensional analogue of the Sierpiński triangle, formed by repeatedly shrinking a regular tetrahedron to one half its original height, putting together four copies of this tetrahedron with corners touching, and then repeating the process.

A tetrix constructed from an initial tetrahedron of side-length formula_18 has the property that the total surface area remains constant with each iteration. The initial surface area of the (iteration-0) tetrahedron of side-length formula_18 is formula_20. The next iteration consists of four copies with side length formula_21, so the total area is formula_22 again. Subsequent iterations again quadruple the number of copies and halve the side length, preserving the overall area. Meanwhile, the volume of the construction is halved at every step and therefore approaches zero. The limit of this process has neither volume nor surface but, like the Sierpiński gasket, is an intricately connected curve. Its Hausdorff dimension is formula_23; here &quot;log&quot; denotes the natural logarithm, the numerator is the logarithm of the number of copies of the shape formed from each copy of the previous iteration, and the denominator is the logarithm of the factor by which these copies are scaled down from the previous iteration. If all points are projected onto a plane that is parallel to two of the outer edges, they exactly fill a square of side length formula_24 without overlap.

==History==
Wacław Sierpiński described the Sierpiński triangle in 1915. However, similar patterns appear already as a common motif of 13th-century Cosmatesque inlay stonework.

The Apollonian gasket, named for Apollonius of Perga (3rd century BC), was first described by Gottfried Leibniz (17th century) and is a curved precursor of the 20th-century Sierpiński triangle.

==Etymology==

The usage of the word &quot;gasket&quot; to refer to the Sierpiński triangle refers to gaskets such as are found in motors, and which sometimes feature a series of holes of decreasing size, similar to the fractal; this usage was coined by Benoit Mandelbrot, who thought the fractal looked similar to &quot;the part that prevents leaks in motors&quot;.

<text>Siberia ( ; , ) is an extensive geographical region comprising all of North Asia, from the Ural Mountains in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east. It has formed a part of the sovereign territory of Russia and its predecessor states since the lengthy conquest of Siberia, which began with the fall of the Khanate of Sibir in 1582 and concluded with the annexation of Chukotka in 1778. Siberia is vast and sparsely populated, covering an area of over , but home to roughly a quarter of Russia&#x27;s population. Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk, and Omsk are the largest cities in the area.

Because Siberia is a geographic and historic concept and not a political entity, there is no single precise definition of its territorial borders. Traditionally, Siberia spans the entire expanse of land from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific Ocean, with the Ural River usually forming the southernmost portion of its western boundary, and includes most of the drainage basin of the Arctic Ocean. It is further defined as stretching from the territories within the Arctic Circle in the north to the northern borders of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and China in the south, although the hills of north-central Kazakhstan are also commonly included. The Russian government divides the region into three federal districts (groupings of Russian federal subjects), of which only the central one is officially referred to as &quot;Siberian&quot;; the other two are the Ural and Far Eastern federal districts, named for the Ural and Russian Far East regions that correspond respectively to the western and eastern thirds of Siberia in the broader sense.

Siberia is known for its long, harsh winters, with a January average of −25 °C (−13 °F). Although it is geographically in Asia, Russian sovereignty and colonization since the 16th century has led to perceptions of the region as culturally and ethnically European. Over 85% of its population are of European descent, chiefly Russian (comprising the Siberian sub-ethnic group), and Eastern Slavic cultural influences predominate throughout the region. Nevertheless, there exist sizable ethnic minorities of Asian lineage, including various Turkic communities—many of which, such as the Yakuts, Tuvans, Altai, and Khakas, are Indigenous—along with the Mongolic Buryats, ethnic Koreans, and smaller groups of Samoyedic and Tungusic peoples (several of whom are classified as Indigenous small-numbered peoples by the Russian government), among many others.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name is uncertain. In the Russian language, it was adopted as a toponym through contact with the Khanate of Sibir (Сибирское ханство) since the 15th century. The Russian name &quot;Yugra&quot; was applied to the northern lands east of the Urals, which had been known of since the 11th century or earlier, while the name &quot;Siberia&quot; is first mentioned in Russian chronicles at the start of the 15th century in connection with the death of the khan Tokhtamysh, in &quot;the Siberian land&quot;.

Some sources say that &quot;Siberia&quot; originates from the Siberian Tatar word for &#x27;sleeping land&#x27; (&quot;Sib-ir&quot;), but this discourse does not correspond to the actual Siberian Tatar language. Mongolist György Kara posits that the toponym &quot;Siberia&quot; is derived from a Mongolic word &quot;sibir&quot;, cognate with modern Buryat &quot;sheber&quot; &#x27;dense forest&#x27;. A different hypothesis claims that the region was named after the Sibe people. Another account sees the name as the ancient tribal ethnonym of the Sihirtia or Sirtya (also &quot;Syopyr&quot; [sʲɵpᵻr])), a hypothetical Paleo-Asiatic ethnic group assimilated by the Nenets.

The Polish historian Jan Chyliczkowski has proposed that the name derives from the Proto-Slavic word for &#x27;north&#x27; (cf. Russian север &quot;sever&quot;), as in Severia. Anatole Baikaloff has dismissed this explanation. He said that the neighboring Chinese, Turks, and Mongolians, who have similar names for the region, would not have known Russian. He suggested that the name might be a combination of two words with Turkic origin, &quot;su&quot; &#x27;water&#x27; and &quot;bir&quot; &#x27;wild land&#x27;.

==History==

===Prehistory===
Siberia in Paleozoic times formed the continent of Siberia/Angaraland, which fused to Euramerica during the Late Carboniferous, as part of the formation of Pangea.

The Siberian Traps were formed by one of the largest-known volcanic events of the last 251 million years of Earth&#x27;s geological history. Their activity continued for a million years and some scientists consider it a possible cause of the &quot;Great Dying&quot; about 250 million years ago, – estimated to have killed 90% of species existing at the time.

The region has paleontological significance, as it contains bodies of prehistoric animals from the Pleistocene Epoch, preserved in ice or permafrost. Specimens of Goldfuss cave lion cubs, Yuka the mammoth and another woolly mammoth from Oymyakon, a woolly rhinoceros from the Kolyma, and bison and horses from Yukagir have been found. Remote Wrangel Island and the Taymyr Peninsula are believed to have been the last places on Earth to support woolly mammoths as isolated populations until their extinction around 2000 BC.

At least three species of humans lived in southern Siberia around 40,000 years ago: &quot;H. sapiens&quot;, &quot;H. neanderthalensis&quot;, and the Denisovans.
In 2010, DNA evidence identified the last as a separate species. 

Late Paleolithic southern Siberians appear to be related to Paleolithic Europeans and the paleolithic Jōmon people of Japan. Ancient DNA analysis has revealed that the oldest fossil known to carry the derived KITLG allele, which is responsible for blond hair in modern Europeans, is a 17,000 year old Ancient North Eurasian specimen from Siberia. Ancient North Eurasian populations genetically similar to Mal&#x27;ta–Buret&#x27; culture and Afontova Gora were an important genetic contributor to Native Americans, Europeans, Ancient Central Asians, South Asians, and some East Asian groups (such as the Ainu people). Evidence from full genomic studies suggests that the first people in the Americas diverged from Ancient East Asians about 36,000 years ago and expanded northwards into Siberia, where they encountered and interacted with Ancient North Eurasians, giving rise to both Paleosiberian peoples and Ancient Native Americans, which later migrated towards the Beringian region, became isolated from other populations, and subsequently populated the Americas. 

===Early history===

During past millennia, different groups of nomads – such as the Enets, the Nenets, the Huns, the Xiongnu, the Scythians, and the Yugur – inhabited various parts of Siberia. The Afanasievo and Tashtyk cultures of the Yenisey valley and Altay Mountains are associated with the Indo-European migrations across Eurasia. The proto-Mongol Khitan people also occupied parts of the region.

In the 13th century, during the period of the Mongol Empire, the Mongols conquered a large part of this area. With the breakup of the Golden Horde, the autonomous Khanate of Sibir was formed in the late-15th century. Turkic-speaking Yakut migrated north from the Lake Baikal region under pressure from the Mongol tribes from the 13th to 15th centuries. Siberia remained a sparsely populated area. Historian John F. Richards wrote: &quot;it is doubtful that the total early modern Siberian population exceeded 300,000 persons&quot;.

====Early Russian exploration====

The first mention of Siberia in chronicles is recorded in the year 1032. The city-state of Novgorod established two trade routes to the Ob River, and laid claim to the lands the Russians called &quot;Yugra&quot;. The Russians were attracted by its furs in particular. Novgorod launched military campaigns to extract tribute from the local population, but often met resistance, such as two campaigns in 1187 and 1193 mentioned in chronicles that were defeated. After Novgorod was annexed by Moscow, the newly emerging centralized Russian state also laid claim to the region, with Ivan III of Russia sending expeditionary forces to Siberia in 1483 and 1499–1500. The Russians received tribute, but contact with the tribes ceased after they left.

The growing power of Russia began to undermine the Siberian Khanate in the 16th century. First, groups of traders and Cossacks began to enter the area. The Russian army was directed to establish forts farther and farther east to protect new Russian settlers who migrated from Europe. Towns such as Mangazeya, Tara, Yeniseysk, and Tobolsk developed, the last becoming the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Siberia from 1590. At this time, &quot;Sibir&quot; was the name of a fortress at Qashliq, near Tobolsk. Gerardus Mercator, in a map published in 1595, marks &quot;Sibier&quot; both as the name of a settlement and of the surrounding territory along a left tributary of the Ob. Other sources contend that the Sibe, an Indigenous Tungusic people, offered fierce resistance to Russian expansion beyond the Urals. Some suggest that the term &quot;Siberia&quot; is a russification of their ethnonym.

===Russian Empire===
By the mid-17th century, Russia had established areas of control that extended to the Pacific Ocean. Some 230,000 Russians had settled in Siberia by 1709. Siberia became one of the destinations for sending internal exiles. Exile was the main Russian punitive practice with more than 800,000 people exiled during the nineteenth century.

The first great modern change in Siberia was the Trans-Siberian Railway, constructed during 1891–1916. It linked Siberia more closely to the rapidly industrialising Russia of Nicholas II (). Around seven million Russians moved to Siberia from Europe between 1801 and 1914. Between 1859 and 1917, more than half a million people migrated to the Russian Far East. Siberia has extensive natural resources: during the 20th century, large-scale exploitation of these took place, and industrial towns cropped up throughout the region.

At 7:15 a.m. on 30 June 1908, the Tunguska Event felled millions of trees near the Podkamennaya Tunguska River (Stony Tunguska River) in central Siberia. Most scientists believe this resulted from the air burst of a meteor or a comet. Even though no crater has ever been found, the landscape in the (sparsely inhabited) area still bears the scars of this event.

===Soviet Union===

In the early decades of the Soviet Union (especially in the 1930s and 1940s), the government used the Gulag state agency to administer a system of penal labour camps, replacing the previous katorga system. According to semi-official Soviet estimates, which did not become public until after the fall of the Soviet government in 1991, from 1929 to 1953 more than 14 million people passed through these camps and prisons, many of them in Siberia. Another seven to eight million people were internally deported to remote areas of the Soviet Union (including entire nationalities or ethnicities in several cases).

Half a million (516,841) prisoners died in camps from 1941 to 1943 during World War II. At other periods, mortality was comparatively lower. The size, scope, and scale of the Gulag slave-labour camps remain subjects of much research and debate. Many Gulag camps operated in extremely remote areas of northeastern Siberia. The best-known clusters included &quot;Sevvostlag&quot; (&quot;the North-East Camps&quot;) along the Kolyma and &quot;Norillag&quot; near Norilsk, where 69,000 prisoners lived in 1952. Major industrial cities of Northern Siberia, such as Norilsk and Magadan, developed from camps built by prisoners and run by former prisoners.

==Geography==


Siberia spans an area of , covering the vast majority of Russia&#x27;s total territory, and almost 9% of Earth&#x27;s land surface (). It geographically falls in Asia, but is culturally and politically considered European, since it is a part of Russia. Major geographical zones within Siberia include the West Siberian Plain and the Central Siberian Plateau.

Eastern and central Sakha comprises numerous north–south mountain ranges of various ages. These mountains extend up to almost , but above a few hundred metres they are almost completely devoid of vegetation. The Verkhoyansk Range was extensively glaciated in the Pleistocene, but the climate was too dry for glaciation to extend to low elevations. At these low elevations are numerous valleys, many of them deep and covered with larch forest, except in the extreme north where the tundra dominates. Soils are mainly turbels (a type of gelisol). The active layer tends to be less than one metre deep, except near rivers.

The highest point in Siberia is the active volcano Klyuchevskaya Sopka, on the Kamchatka Peninsula. Its peak reaches .

===Geology===
The West Siberian Plain, consisting mostly of Cenozoic alluvial deposits, is somewhat flat. In the mid-Pleistocene, many deposits on this plain resulted from ice dams which produced a large glacial lake. This mid- to late-Pleistocene lake blocked the northward flow of the Ob and Yenisey rivers, resulting in a redirection southwest into the Caspian and Aral seas via the Turgai Valley. The area is very swampy, and soils are mostly peaty histosols and, in the treeless northern part, histels. In the south of the plain, where permafrost is largely absent, rich grasslands that are an extension of the Kazakh Steppe formed the original vegetation, most of which is no longer visible.
The Central Siberian Plateau is an ancient craton (sometimes named &quot;Angaraland&quot;) that formed an independent continent before the Permian (see the Siberian continent). It is exceptionally rich in minerals, containing large deposits of gold, diamonds, and ores of manganese, lead, zinc, nickel, cobalt, and molybdenum. Much of the area includes the Siberian Traps—a large igneous province. A massive eruptive period approximately coincided with the Permian–Triassic extinction event. The volcanic event is one of the largest known volcanic eruptions in Earth&#x27;s history. Only the extreme northwest was glaciated during the Quaternary, but almost all is under exceptionally deep permafrost, and the only tree that can thrive, despite the warm summers, is the deciduous Siberian Larch (&quot;Larix sibirica&quot;) with its very shallow roots. Outside the extreme northwest, the taiga is dominant, covering a significant fraction of the entirety of Siberia. Soils here are mainly turbels, giving way to spodosols where the active layer becomes thicker and the ice-content lower.

The &quot;Lena-Tunguska petroleum province&quot; includes the Central Siberian platform (some authors refer to it as the &quot;Eastern Siberian platform&quot;), bounded on the northeast and east by the Late Carboniferous through Jurassic Verkhoyansk foldbelt, on the northwest by the Paleozoic Taymr foldbelt, and on the southeast, south and southwest by the Middle Silurian to Middle Devonian Baykalian foldbelt. A regional geologic reconnaissance study begun in 1932 and followed by surface and subsurface mapping revealed the Markova-Angara Arch (anticline). This led to the discovery of the Markovo Oil Field in 1962 with the Markovo—1 well, which produced from the Early Cambrian Osa Horizon bar-sandstone at a depth of . The &quot;Sredne-Botuobin Gas Field&quot; was discovered in 1970, producing from the Osa and the Proterozoic Parfenovo Horizon. The Yaraktin Oil Field was discovered in 1971, producing from the Vendian Yaraktin Horizon at depths of up to , which lies below Permian to Lower Jurassic basalt traps.

===Climate===

The climate of Siberia varies dramatically, but it typically has warm but short summers and long, brutally cold winters. On the north coast, north of the Arctic Circle, there is a very short (about one month long) summer.

Almost all the population lives in the south, along the route of the Trans-Siberian Railway. The climate in this southernmost part is humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa/Dfb&quot; or &quot;Dwa/Dwb&quot;) with cold winters but fairly warm summers lasting at least four months. The annual average temperature is about . January averages about and July about , while daytime temperatures in summer typically exceed . With a reliable growing season, an abundance of sunshine and exceedingly fertile chernozem soils, southern Siberia is good enough for profitable agriculture, as was demonstrated in the early 20th century.

By far the most commonly occurring climate in Siberia is continental subarctic (Koppen &quot;Dfc&quot;, &quot;Dwc&quot;, or &quot;Dsc&quot;), with the annual average temperature about and an average for January of and an average for July of , although this varies considerably, with a July average about in the taiga–tundra ecotone. The business-oriented website and blog &quot;Business Insider&quot; lists Verkhoyansk and Oymyakon, in Siberia&#x27;s Sakha Republic, as being in competition for the title of the Northern Hemisphere&#x27;s &quot;Pole of Cold&quot;. Oymyakon is a village which recorded a temperature of on 6 February 1933. Verkhoyansk, a town further north and further inland, recorded a temperature of for three consecutive nights: 5, 6 and 7 February 1933. Each town is alternately considered the Northern Hemisphere&#x27;s Pole of Cold – the coldest inhabited point in the Northern hemisphere. Each town also frequently reaches in the summer, giving them, and much of the rest of Russian Siberia, the world&#x27;s greatest temperature variation between summer&#x27;s highs and winter&#x27;s lows, often well over between the seasons.

Southwesterly winds bring warm air from Central Asia and the Middle East. The climate in West Siberia (Omsk, or Novosibirsk) is several degrees warmer than in the East (Irkutsk, or Chita) where in the north an extreme winter subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfd&quot;, &quot;Dwd&quot;, or &quot;Dsd&quot;) prevails. But summer temperatures in other regions can reach . In general, Sakha is the coldest Siberian region, and the basin of the Yana has the lowest temperatures of all, with permafrost reaching . Nevertheless, Imperial Russian plans of settlement never viewed cold as an impediment. In the winter, southern Siberia sits near the center of the semi-permanent Siberian High, so winds are usually light in the winter.

Precipitation in Siberia is generally low, exceeding only in Kamchatka, where moist winds flow from the Sea of Okhotsk onto high mountains – producing the region&#x27;s only major glaciers, though volcanic eruptions and low summer temperatures allow only limited forests to grow. Precipitation is high also in most of Primorye in the extreme south, where monsoonal influences can produce quite heavy summer rainfall.

====Global warming====
Researchers, including Sergei Kirpotin at Tomsk State University and Judith Marquand at Oxford University, warn that Western Siberia has begun to thaw as a result of global warming. The frozen peat bogs in this region may hold billions of tons of methane gas, which may be released into the atmosphere. Methane is a greenhouse gas 22 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. In 2008 a research expedition for the American Geophysical Union detected levels of methane up to 100 times above normal in the atmosphere above the Siberian Arctic, likely the result of methane clathrates being released through holes in a frozen &quot;lid&quot; of seabed permafrost around the outfall of the Lena and the area between the Laptev Sea and East Siberian Sea.

Since 1988, experimentation at Pleistocene Park has proposed to restore the grasslands of prehistoric times by conducting research on the effects of large herbivores on permafrost, suggesting that animals, rather than climate, maintained the past ecosystem. The nature reserve park also conducts climatic research on the changes expected from the reintroduction of grazing animals or large herbivores, hypothesizing that a transition from tundra to grassland would lead to a net change in energy emission to absorption ratios.

According to Vasily Kryuchkov, approximately 31,000 square kilometers of the Russian Arctic has been subjected to severe environmental disturbance.

==Borders and administrative division==

The term &quot;Siberia&quot; has both a long history and wide significance, and association. The understanding, and association of &quot;Siberia&quot; have gradually changed during the ages. Historically, Siberia was defined as the whole part of Russia and North Kazakhstan to the east of Ural Mountains, including the Russian Far East. According to this definition, Siberia extended eastward from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific coast, and southward from the Arctic Ocean to the border of Central Asia and the national borders of both Mongolia and China.

Soviet-era sources (&quot;Great Soviet Encyclopedia&quot; and others) and modern Russian ones usually define Siberia as a region extending eastward from the Ural Mountains to the watershed between Pacific and Arctic drainage basins, and southward from the Arctic Ocean to the hills of north-central Kazakhstan and the national borders of both Mongolia and China. By this definition, Siberia includes the federal subjects of the Siberian Federal District, and some of the Ural Federal District, as well as Sakha (Yakutia) Republic, which is a part of the Far Eastern Federal District. Geographically, this definition includes subdivisions of several other subjects of Urals and Far Eastern federal districts, but they are not included administratively. This definition excludes Sverdlovsk Oblast and Chelyabinsk Oblast, both of which are included in some wider definitions of Siberia.

Other sources may use either a somewhat wider definition that states the Pacific coast, not the watershed, is the eastern boundary (thus including the whole Russian Far East), as well as all Northern Kazakhstan is its subregion in the south-west or a somewhat narrower one that limits Siberia to the Siberian Federal District (thus excluding all subjects of other districts). In Russian, &#x27;Siberia&#x27; is commonly used as a substitute for the name of the federal district by those who live in the district itself, but less commonly used to denote the federal district by people residing outside of it. Due to the different interpretations of Siberia, starting from Tyumen, to Chita, the territory generally defined as &#x27;Siberia&#x27;, some people will define themselves as &#x27;Siberian&#x27;, while others not.

A number of factors in recent years, including the fomenting of Siberian separatism have made the definition of the territory of Siberia a potentially controversial subject. In the eastern extent of Siberia there are territories which are not clearly defined as either Siberia or the Far East, making the question of &quot;what is Siberia?&quot; one with no clear answer, and what is a &quot;Siberian&quot;, one of self-identification.



===Major cities===
The most populous city of Siberia, as well as the third most populous city of Russia, is the city of Novosibirsk. Present-day Novosibirsk is an important business, science, manufacturing and cultural center of the Asian part of Russia.

Omsk played an important role in the Russian Civil War serving as a provisional Russian capital, as well in the expansion into and governing of Central Asia. In addition to its cultural status, it has become a major oil-refining, education, transport and agriculture hub.

Other historic cities of Siberia include Tobolsk (the first capital and the only kremlin in Siberia), Tomsk (formerly a wealthy merchant&#x27;s town) and Irkutsk (former seat of Eastern Siberia&#x27;s governor general, near lake Baikal).

Other major cities include: Barnaul, Kemerovo, Krasnoyarsk, Novokuznetsk, Tyumen.

Wider definitions of geographic Siberia also include the cities of: Chelyabinsk and Yekaterinburg in the Urals, Khabarovsk and Vladivostok in the Russian Far East, and even Petropavlovsk in Kazakhstan and Harbin in China.

==Economy==

Novosibirsk is the largest by population and the most important city for the Siberian economy; with an extra boost since 2000 when it was designated a regional center for the executive bureaucracy (Siberian Federal District). Omsk is a historic and currently the second largest city in the region, and since 1950s hosting Russia&#x27;s largest oil refinery, the Omsk Refinery.

Siberia is extraordinarily rich in minerals, containing ores of almost all economically valuable metals. It has some of the world&#x27;s largest deposits of nickel, gold, lead, coal, molybdenum, gypsum, diamonds, diopside, silver and zinc, as well as extensive unexploited resources of oil and natural gas. Around 70% of Russia&#x27;s developed oil fields are in the Khanty-Mansiysk region. Russia contains about 40% of the world&#x27;s known resources of nickel at the Norilsk deposit in Siberia. Norilsk Nickel is the world&#x27;s biggest nickel and palladium producer.

Siberian agriculture is severely restricted by the short growing season of most of the region. However, in the southwest where soils consist of exceedingly fertile black earths and the climate is a little more moderate, there is extensive cropping of wheat, barley, rye and potatoes, along with the grazing of large numbers of sheep and cattle. Elsewhere food production, owing to the poor fertility of the podzolic soils and the extremely short growing seasons, is restricted to the herding of reindeer in the tundra—which has been practiced by natives for over 10,000 years. Siberia has the world&#x27;s largest forests. Timber remains an important source of revenue, even though many forests in the east have been logged much more rapidly than they are able to recover. The Sea of Okhotsk is one of the two or three richest fisheries in the world owing to its cold currents and very large tidal ranges, and thus Siberia produces over 10% of the world&#x27;s annual fish catch, although fishing has declined somewhat since the collapse of the USSR in 1991.

Reported in 2009, the development of renewable energy in Russia is held back by the lack of a conducive government policy framework, , Siberia still offers special opportunities for off-grid renewable energy developments. Remote parts of Siberia are too costly to connect to central electricity and gas grids, and have therefore historically been supplied with costly diesel, sometimes flown in by helicopter. In such cases renewable energy is often cheaper.

==Sport==
The Yenisey Krasnoyarsk basketball team has played in the VTB United League since 2011–12.

Russia&#x27;s third most popular sport, bandy, is important in Siberia. In the 2015–16 Russian Bandy Super League season Yenisey from Krasnoyarsk became champions for the third year in a row by beating Baykal-Energiya from Irkutsk in the final. Two or three more teams (depending on the definition of Siberia) play in the Super League, the 2016–17 champions SKA-Neftyanik from Khabarovsk as well as Kuzbass from Kemerovo and Sibselmash from Novosibirsk. In 2007 Kemerovo got Russia&#x27;s first indoor arena specifically built for bandy. Now Khabarovsk has the world&#x27;s largest indoor arena specifically built for bandy, Arena Yerofey. It was venue for Division A of the 2018 World Championship. In time for the 2020 World Championship, an indoor arena will be ready for use in Irkutsk. That one will also have a speed skating oval. Krasnoyarsk is also one of the centres of Rugby in Russia, with 2 of the largest clubs in the country, STM Enisei and Krasny Yar, are both based in the city.

The 2019 Winter Universiade was hosted by Krasnoyarsk.

==Demographics==

According to the Russian Census of 2010, the Siberian and Far Eastern Federal Districts, located entirely east of the Ural Mountains, together have a population of about 25.6 million. Tyumen and Kurgan Oblasts, which are geographically in Siberia but administratively part of the Urals Federal District, together have a population of about 4.3 million. Thus, the whole region of Siberia (in the broadest usage of the term) is home to approximately 30 million people. It has a population density of about three people per square kilometre.

The largest ethnic group in Siberia is Slavic-origin Russians, including their sub-ethnic group Siberians, and russified Ukrainians. Slavic and other Indo-European ethnicities make up the vast majority (over 85%) of the Siberian population. There are also other groups of Indigenous Siberian and non-Indigenous ethnic origin. A minority of the current population are descendants of Mongol or Turkic people (mainly Buryats, Yakuts, Tuvans, Altai and Khakas) or northern Indigenous people. Slavic-origin Russians outnumber all of the Indigenous peoples combined, except in the Republics of Tuva and Sakha.

According to the 2002 census there are 500,000 Tatars in Siberia, but of these, 300,000 are Volga Tatars who also settled in Siberia during periods of colonization and are thus also non-Indigenous Siberians, in contrast to the 200,000 Siberian Tatars which are Indigenous to Siberia. Of the Indigenous Siberians, the Mongol-speaking Buryats, numbering approximately 500,000, are the most numerous group in Siberia, and they are mainly concentrated in their homeland, the Buryat Republic. According to the 2010 census there were 478,085 indigenous Turkic-speaking Yakuts. Other ethnic groups Indigenous to Siberia include Kets, Evenks, Chukchis, Koryaks, Yupiks, and Yukaghirs.

About seventy percent of Siberia&#x27;s people live in cities, mainly in apartments. Many people also live in rural areas, in simple, spacious, log houses. Novosibirsk is the largest city in Siberia, with a population of about 1.6 million. Tobolsk, Tomsk, Tyumen, Krasnoyarsk, Irkutsk, and Omsk are the older, historical centers.

==Religion==

There are a variety of beliefs throughout Siberia, including Orthodox Christianity, other denominations of Christianity, Tibetan Buddhism and Islam. The Siberian Federal District alone has an estimation of 250,000 Muslims. An estimated 70,000 Jews live in Siberia, some in the Jewish Autonomous Region. The predominant religious group is the Russian Orthodox Church.

Tradition regards Siberia the archetypal home of shamanism, and polytheism is popular. These native sacred practices are considered by the tribes to be very ancient. There are records of Siberian tribal healing practices dating back to the 13th century. The vast territory of Siberia has many different local traditions of gods. These include: Ak Ana, Anapel, Bugady Musun, Kara Khan, Khaltesh-Anki, Kini&#x27;je, Ku&#x27;urkil, Nga, Nu&#x27;tenut, Num-Torum, Pon, Pugu, Todote, Toko&#x27;yoto, Tomam, Xaya Iccita and Zonget. Places with sacred areas include Olkhon, an island in Lake Baikal.

==Transport==
Many cities in northern Siberia, such as Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, cannot be reached by road, as there are virtually none connecting from other major cities in Russia or Asia. Siberia can be reached through the Trans-Siberian Railway. The Trans-Siberian Railway operates from Moscow in the west to Vladivostok in the east. Cities that are located far from the railway are reached by air or by the separate Baikal–Amur Railway (BAM).

==Culture==
===Cuisine===
Stroganina is a raw fish dish of the Indigenous people of northern Arctic Siberia made from raw, thin, long-sliced frozen fish. It is a popular dish with native Siberians. Siberia is also known for its pelmeni dumpling; which in the winter are traditionally frozen and stored outdoors. In addition, there are various berry, nut and mushroom dishes making use of the riches of abundant nature.

<doc id="29640" wikidata="Q7598173" url="?curid=29640" title="Standard Arabic Technical Transliteration System">
<text>The Standard Arabic Technical Transliteration System, commonly referred to by its acronym SATTS, is a system for writing and transmitting Arabic language text using the one-for-one substitution of ASCII-range characters for the letters of the Arabic alphabet. Unlike more common systems for transliterating Arabic, SATTS does not provide the reader with any more phonetic information than standard Arabic orthography does; that is, it provides the bare Arabic alphabetic spelling with no notation of short vowels, doubled consonants, etc. In other words, it is intended as a transliteration tool for Arabic linguists, and is of limited use to those who do not know Arabic.

SATTS, a legacy of Morse and teleprinter systems (see &quot;Background,&quot; below), has historically been employed by military and communications elements of Western countries for handling Arabic text without the need for native fonts or special software. Although its use has decreased in recent years with the demise of Morse code and the obsolescence of the teleprinter, and with the increased availability of native-font software, it is still used for the quick and handy platform-independent recording and transmission of Arabic terms and text.

==Format==
SATTS employs all the Latin alphabetic letters except P, plus four punctuation marks, for a total of 29 symbols (all the letters of the Arabic alphabet, plus the glottal-stop symbol hamzah).

==Table of SATTS equivalents==


In some words, lām &#x27;alif was sent as a single character •—••••— or LA as a single character. The symbol for the glottal stop hamzah (ء) is written following its seat, if it has one. It is omitted when it occurs with an initial &#x27;alif.

==Sample text==
The chief deficiencies of SATTS are that it does not distinguish between hā&#x27; (ه) and tā&#x27; marbūţah (ة), or between final yā&#x27; (ي) and &#x27;alif maksūrah (ى), and it cannot depict an &#x27;alif maddah ( آ ). SATTS also cannot distinguish between a final seated hamza and a final independent hamza, if the word ends in &quot;AE&quot;, &quot;IE&quot;, or &quot;WE&quot;.

==Background==
The Latin alphabetic letter employed for each Arabic letter in the SATTS system is its Morse-code equivalent. For example, Morse code for the Arabic letter ţā&#x27; (ط) is • • — (dit-dit-dah). That same Morse code sequence represents the letter U in the Latin alphabet. Hence the SATTS equivalent for ţā&#x27; is U.

In the Morse-code era, when Arabic language Morse signals were copied down by non-Arab code clerks, the text came out in SATTS. Text in SATTS was also automatically produced when teleprinters reproduced Arabic text, if the technician had failed to replace the printer&#x27;s Latin-character pallet with an Arabic-character one.

<text>In historical linguistics, a sound change is a change in the pronunciation of a language. A sound change can involve the replacement of one speech sound (or, more generally, one phonetic feature value) by a different one (called phonetic change) or a more general change to the speech sounds that exist (&quot;phonological change&quot;), such as the merger of two sounds or the creation of a new sound. A sound change can eliminate the affected sound, or a new sound can be added. Sound changes can be environmentally conditioned if the change occurs in only some sound environments, and not others.

The term &quot;sound change&quot; refers to diachronic changes, which occur in a language&#x27;s sound system. On the other hand, &quot;alternation&quot; refers to changes that happen synchronically (within the language of an individual speaker, depending on the neighbouring sounds) and do not change the language&#x27;s underlying system (for example, the &quot;-s&quot; in the English plural can be pronounced differently depending on the preceding sound, as in &quot;bet&quot;[s], &quot;bed&quot;[z], which is a form of alternation, rather than sound change). Since &quot;sound change&quot; can refer to the historical introduction of an alternation (such as postvocalic /k/ in the Tuscan dialect, which was once [k] as in &quot;di&quot; [k]&quot;arlo&quot; &#x27;of Carlo&#x27; but is now [h] &quot;di&quot; [h]&quot;arlo&quot; and alternates with [k] in other positions: &quot;con&quot; [k]&quot;arlo&quot; &#x27;with Carlo&#x27;), that label is inherently imprecise and must often be clarified as referring to either phonemic change or restructuring.

Research on sound change is usually conducted under the working assumption that it is &quot;regular&quot;, which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors like the meaning of the words that are affected. Apparent exceptions to regular change can occur because of dialect borrowing, grammatical analogy, or other causes known and unknown, and some changes are described as &quot;sporadic&quot; and so they affect only one or a few particular words, without any apparent regularity.

The Neogrammarian linguists of the 19th century introduced the term sound law to refer to rules of regular change, perhaps in imitation of the laws of physics, and the term &quot;law&quot; is still used in referring to specific sound rules that are named after their authors like Grimm&#x27;s law, Grassmann&#x27;s law, etc. Real-world sound laws often admit exceptions, but the expectation of their regularity or absence of exceptions is of great heuristic value by allowing historical linguists to define the notion of &quot;regular correspondence&quot; by the comparative method.

Each sound change is limited in space and time and so it functions in a limited area (within certain dialects) and for a limited period of time. For those and other reasons, the term &quot;sound law&quot; has been criticized for implying a universality that is unrealistic for sound change.

A sound change that affects the phonological system or the number or the distribution of its phonemes is a phonological change.

==Principles==

The following statements are used as heuristics in formulating sound changes as understood within the Neogrammarian model. However, for modern linguistics, they are not taken as inviolable rules but are seen as guidelines.

Sound change has no memory: Sound change does not discriminate between the sources of a sound. If a previous sound change causes X,Y &gt; Y (features X and Y merge as Y), a new one cannot affect only an original X.

Sound change ignores grammar: A sound change can have only phonological constraints, like X &gt; Z in unstressed syllables. For example, it cannot affect only adjectives. The only exception is that a sound change may recognise word boundaries, even when they are unindicated by prosodic clues. Also, sound changes may be regularized in inflectional paradigms (such as verbal inflection), when it is no longer phonological but morphological in nature.

Sound change is exceptionless: If a sound change can happen at a place, it will affect all sounds that meet the criteria for change. Apparent exceptions are possible because of analogy and other regularization processes, another sound change, or an unrecognized conditioning factor. That is the traditional view expressed by the Neogrammarians. In the past decades, however, it has been shown that sound change does not necessarily affect all possible words. However, when a sound change is initiated, it often eventually expands to the whole lexicon. For example, the Spanish fronting of the Vulgar Latin [g] (voiced velar stop) before [i e ɛ] seems to have reached every possible word. By contrast, the voicing of word-initial Latin [k] to [g] occurred in &quot;colaphus&quot; &gt; &quot;golpe&quot; and &quot;cattus&quot; &gt; &quot;gato&quot; but not in &quot;canna&quot; &gt; &quot;caña&quot;. See also lexical diffusion.

Sound change is inevitable: All languages vary from place to place and time to time, and neither writing nor media prevents that change.

==Formal notation==

A statement of the form

is to be read as &quot;Sound A changes into (or is replaced by, is reflected as, etc.) sound B&quot;. Therefore, A belongs to an older stage of the language in question, and B belongs to a more recent stage. The symbol &quot;&gt;&quot; can be reversed, B &lt; A, which also means that the (more recent) B derives from the (older) A&quot;:

::POc. *t &gt; Rot. f

:means that &quot;Proto-Oceanic (POc.) *t is reflected as in Rotuman (Rot.)&quot;.

The two sides of such a statement indicate only the start and the end of the change, but additional intermediate stages may have occurred. The example above is actually a compressed account of a &quot;sequence&quot; of changes: * first changed to (like the initial consonant of English &quot;thin&quot;), which has since yielded and can be represented more fully:

:: t &gt; &gt; f

Unless a change operates unconditionally (in all environments), the context in which it applies must be specified:

::A &gt; B /X__Y

:= &quot;A changes to B when it is preceded by X and followed by Y.&quot;

For example:

::It. b &gt; v /[vowel]__[vowel], which can be simplified to just
::It. b &gt; v /V__V (in which the V stands for any vowel)

:= &quot;Intervocalic [b] (inherited from Latin) became [v] in Italian&quot; (such as in &quot;caballum, dēbet&quot; &gt; &quot;cavallo&quot; &#x27;horse&#x27;, &quot;deve&quot; &#x27;owe (3rd pers. sing.)&#x27;

Here is a second example:

::PIr. [−cont][−voi] &gt; [+cont] /__[C][+cont]

:= &quot;A preconsonantal voiceless non-continuant (voiceless stop) changed into corresponding a voiceless continuant (fricative) in Proto-Iranian (PIr.)&quot; when it was immediately followed by a continuant consonant (a resonant or a fricative): Proto-Indo-Iranian *&quot;pra&quot; &#x27;forth&#x27; &gt; Avestan &quot;fra&quot;; *&quot;trayas&quot; &quot;three&quot; (masc. nom. pl.)&gt; Av. &quot;θrayō&quot;; *&quot;čatwāras&quot; &quot;four&quot; (masc. nom. pl.) &gt; Av. &quot;čaθwārō&quot;; *&quot;pśaws&quot; &quot;of a cow&quot; (nom. *&quot;paśu&quot;) &gt; Av. &quot;fšāoš&quot; (nom. &quot;pasu&quot;). The fricativization did not occur before stops and so *&quot;sapta&quot; &quot;seven&quot; &gt; Av. &quot;hapta&quot;. (However, in the variety of Iranian that led to Old Persian, fricativization occurred in all clusters: Old Persian &quot;hafta&quot; &quot;seven&quot;.)

The symbol &quot;#&quot; stands for a word boundary (initial or final) and so the notation &quot;/__#&quot; means &quot;word-finally&quot;, and &quot;/#__&quot; means &quot;word-initially&quot;:

::Gk. [stop] &gt; ∅ /__#

:= &quot;Word-final stops were deleted in Greek (&quot;Gk.&quot;)&quot;.

That can be simplified to

::Gk. P &gt; ∅ / __#

in which P stands for any plosive.

==Terms for changes in pronunciation==

In historical linguistics, a number of traditional terms designate types of phonetic change, either by nature or result. A number of such types are often (or usually) sporadic, that is, more or less accidents that happen to a specific form. Others affect a whole phonological system. Sound changes that affect a whole phonological system are also classified according to how they affect the overall shape of the system; see &quot;phonological change&quot;.

* Assimilation: One sound becomes more like another, or (much more rarely) two sounds become more like each other. Example: in Latin the prefix *&quot;kom&quot;- becomes &quot;con&quot;- before an apical stop () or : &quot;contactus&quot; &quot;touched&quot;, &quot;condere&quot; &quot;to found, establish&quot;, &quot;connūbium&quot; &quot;legal marriage&quot;. The great majority of assimilations take place between contiguous segments, and the great majority involve the earlier sound becoming more like the later one (e.g. in &quot;connūbium,&quot; &quot;m- + n&quot; becomes &quot;-nn-&quot; rather than &quot;-mm-&quot;). Assimilation between contiguous segments are (diachronically speaking) exceptionless sound laws rather than sporadic, isolated changes.
* Dissimilation: The opposite of assimilation. One sound becomes less like another, or (much more rarely) two sounds become less like each other. Examples: Classical Latin &quot;quīnque&quot; &quot;five&quot; &gt; Vulgar Latin *&quot;kinkʷe&quot; (whence French &quot;cinq&quot;, Italian &quot;cinque&quot;, etc.); Old Spanish &quot;omne&quot; &quot;man&quot; &gt; Spanish &quot;hombre&quot;. The great majority of dissimilations involve segments that are not contiguous, but, as with assimilations, the great majority involve an earlier sound changing with reference to a later one. Dissimilation is usually a sporadic phenomenon, but Grassmann&#x27;s Law (in Sanskrit and Greek) exemplifies a systematic dissimilation. If the change of a sequence of fricatives such that one becomes a stop is dissimilation, then such changes as Proto-Germanic *hs to (spelled &quot;x&quot;) in English would count as a regular sound law: PGmc. *&quot;sehs&quot; &quot;six&quot; &gt; Old English &quot;siex&quot;, etc.
* Metathesis: Two sounds switch places. Example: Old English &quot;thridda&quot; became Middle English &quot;third&quot;. Most such changes are sporadic, but occasionally a sound law is involved, as Romance *&quot;tl&quot; &gt; Spanish &quot;ld&quot;, thus *&quot;kapitlu, *titlu&quot; &quot;chapter (of a cathedral)&quot;, &quot;tittle&quot; &gt; Spanish &quot;cabildo, tilde&quot;. Metathesis can take place between non-contiguous segments, as Greek &quot;amélgō&quot; &quot;I milk&quot; &gt; Modern Greek &quot;armégō.&quot;
* Lenition: &quot;Weakening&quot; of a consonant from one that takes more effort to pronounce (and more constriction in the vocal tract) to one that takes less, e.g. a stop consonant becoming an affricate or fricative.
* Fortition: the opposite of lenition, &quot;strengthening&quot; a consonant, e.g. an approximant becoming an affricate or fricative.
* Reduction: Whereas the weakening of consonants is called &quot;lenition&quot;, the weakening of vowels is called &quot;reduction&quot;. For example, in most varieties of English, unstressed vowels often reduce to a schwa, such as the two a&#x27;s in &quot;arena&quot;.
* Tonogenesis: Syllables come to have distinctive pitch contours.
* Sandhi: Conditioned changes that take place at word-boundaries but not elsewhere. It can be morpheme-specific, as in the loss of the vowel in the enclitic forms of English &quot;is&quot; , with subsequent change of to adjacent to a voiceless consonant &quot;Frank&#x27;s not here&quot; . Or a small class of elements, such as the assimilation of the of English &quot;the, this&quot; and &quot;that&quot; to a preceding (including the of &quot;and&quot; when the is elided) or : &quot;all the&quot; often , &quot;in the&quot; often , and so on. As in these examples, such features are rarely indicated in standard orthography. In a striking exception, Sanskrit orthography reflects a wide variety of such features; thus, &quot;tat&quot; &quot;that&quot; is written &quot;tat&quot;,&quot; tac&quot;,&quot; taj&quot;,&quot; tad&quot;,&quot; &quot;or &quot;tan&quot; depending on what the first sound of the next word is. These are all assimilations, but medial sequences do not assimilate the same way.
* Haplology: The loss of a syllable when an adjacent syllable is similar or (rarely) identical. Example: Old English &quot;Englaland&quot; became Modern English &quot;England&quot;, or the common pronunciation of &quot;probably&quot; as . This change usually affects commonly used words. The word &quot;haplology&quot; itself is sometimes jokingly pronounced &quot;haplogy&quot;.
* Elision, aphaeresis, syncope, and apocope: All are losses of sounds. Elision is the loss of unstressed sounds, aphaeresis the loss of initial sounds, syncope is the loss of medial sounds, and apocope is the loss of final sounds.
** Elision examples: in the southeastern United States, unstressed schwas tend to drop, so &quot;American&quot; is not but . Standard English is &quot;possum&quot; &lt; &quot;opossum&quot;.
** Syncope examples: the Old French word for &quot;state&quot; is &quot;estat&quot;, but the &quot;s&quot; disappeared, yielding &quot;état&quot;. Similarly, the loss of in English &quot;soften, hasten, castle&quot;, etc.
** Apocope examples: the final -&quot;e&quot; in Middle English words was pronounced, but is only retained in spelling as a silent E. In English and were apocopated in final position after nasals: &quot;lamb, long&quot; .
* Epenthesis (also known as anaptyxis): The introduction of a sound between two adjacent sounds. Examples: Latin &quot;humilis&quot; &gt; English &quot;humble&quot;; in Slavic an -l- intrudes between a labial and a following yod, as *&quot;zemya&quot; &quot;land&quot; &gt; Russian &quot;zemlya&quot; (земля). Most commonly, epenthesis is in the nature of a &quot;transitional&quot; consonant, but vowels may be epenthetic: non-standard English &quot;film&quot; in two syllables, &quot;athlete&quot; in three. Epenthesis can be regular, as when the Indo-European &quot;tool&quot; suffix *-&quot;tlom&quot; everywhere becomes Latin -&quot;culum&quot; (so &quot;speculum&quot; &quot;mirror&quot; &lt; *&quot;speḱtlom&quot;, &quot;pōculum&quot; &quot;drinking cup&quot; &lt; *&quot;poH3-tlom&quot;). Some scholars reserve the term &quot;epenthesis&quot; for &quot;intrusive&quot; vowels and use &quot;excrescence&quot; for intrusive consonants.
* Prothesis: The addition of a sound at the beginning of a word. Example: word-initial + stop clusters in Latin gained a preceding in Old Spanish and Old French; hence, the Spanish word for &quot;state&quot; is &quot;estado&quot;, deriving from Latin &quot;status&quot;.
* Nasalization: Vowels followed by nasal consonants can become nasalized. If the nasal consonant is lost but the vowel retains its nasalized pronunciation, nasalization becomes phonemic, that is, distinctive. Example: French &quot;-in&quot; words used to be pronounced , but are now pronounced , and the is no longer pronounced (except in cases of liaison).

<text>Sulpicius Severus (; c. 363 – c. 425) was a Christian writer and native of Aquitania in modern-day France. He is known for his chronicle of sacred history, as well as his biography of Saint Martin of Tours. He is venerated as a Saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

==Life==
Almost all that we know of Severus&#x27; life comes from a few allusions in his own writings, some passages in the letters of his friend Paulinus, bishop of Nola, and a short biography by the historian Gennadius of Massilia.

Born of noble parents in Aquitaine, Severus enjoyed excellent educational advantages. He was imbued with the culture of his time and of his country, a centre of Latin letters and learning. He studied jurisprudence in Burdigala (Modern Bordeaux) and was renowned as an eloquent lawyer; his knowledge of Roman law is reflected in parts of his writings. He married the daughter of a wealthy consular family, who died young, leaving him no children.

At this time Severus came under the powerful influence of Saint Martin, bishop of Tours, by whom he was led to devote his wealth to the Christian poor, and his own powers to a life of good works and the contemplative vision of God. This choice incurred his father&#x27;s displeasure, but he was encouraged in his determination by his mother-in-law. To use the words of his friend Paulinus, he broke with his father, followed Christ, and set the teachings of the &quot;fishermen&quot; far above all his &quot;Tullian learning.&quot; His ordination as a priest is vouched for by Gennadius, but no details of his priestly activity have reached us. He is said to have been led away in his old age by Pelagianism, but to have repented and inflicted long-enduring penance on himself. His time was passed chiefly in the neighbourhood of Toulouse, and such literary efforts as he indulged in were made in the interests of Christianity.

In many respects no two men could be more unlike than Severus, the scholar and orator, well versed in the ways of the world, and Martin, the rough Pannonian bishop, champion of the monastic life, seer and worker of miracles. Yet the spirit of the rugged saint subdued that of the polished scholar, and the works of Severus are important because they reflect the ideas, influence and aspirations of Martin, the foremost ecclesiastic of Gaul.

==Works==
===&quot;Chronicle&quot;===
The chief work of Severus is the &quot;Chronicle&quot; (&quot;Chronica&quot;, &quot;Chronicorum Libri duo&quot; or &quot;Historia sacra&quot;, c. 403), a summary of sacred history from the beginning of the world to his own times, with the omission of the events recorded in the Gospels and the Acts, &quot;lest the form of his brief work should detract from the honour due to those events&quot;. It is a source of primary importance for the history of Priscillianism and contains considerable information respecting the Arian controversy. The book was a textbook, and was used as such in the schools of Europe for about a century and a half after the &quot;editio princeps&quot; was published by Flacius Illyricus in 1556.

Severus nowhere clearly points to the class of readers for whom his book is designed. He disclaims the intention of making his work a substitute for the actual narrative contained in the Bible. &quot;Worldly historians&quot; had been used by him, he says, to make clear the dates and the connexion of events and for supplementing the sacred sources, and with the intent at once to instruct the unlearned and to &quot;convince&quot; the learned. Probably the &quot;unlearned&quot; are the mass of Christians and the learned are the cultivated Christians and pagans alike, to whom the rude language of the sacred texts, whether in Greek or Latin, would be distasteful. The literary structure of the narrative shows that Severus had in his mind principally readers on the same level of culture with himself. He was anxious to show that sacred history might be presented in a form which lovers of Sallust and Tacitus could appreciate and enjoy. The style is lucid, almost classical. In order that his work might fairly stand beside that of the old Latin writers, Severus ignored the allegorical approach to interpreting sacred history that had been favoured by both heretics and the orthodox of his age.

As an authority on the period prior to his own, Severus offers few guarantees and rarely corrects or supplements the historical record transmitted thanks to other sources. Jakob Bernays suggested that he based his narrative of the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus on the account given by Tacitus in his &quot;Histories&quot;, a portion of which has been lost. In his allusions to the Gentile rulers with whom the Jews came into contact from the time of the Maccabees onwards, Severus discloses some points which are not without importance.

The real interest of Severus&#x27; work lies, first, in the incidental glimpses it affords all through of the history of his own time; next and more particularly, in the information he has preserved concerning the struggle over the Priscillianist heresy, which disorganised and degraded the churches of Spain and Gaul, and particularly affected Aquitaine. The sympathies here betrayed by Severus are wholly those of St. Martin. The bishop had withstood Maximus, who ruled for some years a large part of the western portion of the empire, though he never conquered Italy. He had reproached him with attacking and overthrowing his predecessors on the throne, and for his dealings with the church. Severus loses no opportunity for laying stress on the crimes and follies of rulers, and on their cruelty, though he once declares that, cruel as rulers could be, priests could be crueller still. This last statement has reference to the bishops who had left Maximus no peace till he had stained his hands with the blood of Priscillian and his followers. Martin, too, had denounced the worldliness and greed of the Gaulish bishops and clergy. Accordingly, we find that Severus, in narrating the division of Canaan among the tribes, calls the special attention of ecclesiastics to the fact that no portion of the land was assigned to the tribe of Levi, lest they should be hindered in their service of God. &quot;Our clergy seem&quot;, he says, &quot;not merely forgetful of the lesson, but ignorant of it, such a passion for possessions has in our days fastened like a pestilence on their souls.&quot; We here catch a glimpse of the circumstances which were winning over good men to monasticism in the West, though the evidence of an enthusiastic votary of the solitary life, such as Severus was, is probably not free from exaggeration. Severus also fully sympathised with the action of St. Martin touching Priscillianism. This mysterious Western offshoot of Gnosticism had no single feature about it which could soften the hostility of a character such as Martin&#x27;s, but he resisted the introduction of secular punishment for evil doctrine, and withdrew from communion with those bishops in Gaul, a large majority, who invoked the aid of Maximus against their erring brethren. In this connection, the account given by Severus of the Council of Rimini in 359, where the question arose whether the bishops attending the assembly might lawfully receive money from the imperial treasury to recoup their travelling and other expenses, is notable. Severus evidently approved the action of the British and Gaulish bishops, who deemed it unbecoming that they should lie under pecuniary obligation to the emperor. His ideal of the church required that it should stand clear and above the state.

===&quot;Life of St. Martin&quot;, dialogues, and letters===
More popular during the Middle Ages was Severus&#x27; &quot;Life of St. Martin&quot;, as were also the dialogues and letters which relate to the same subject. These works did much to establish the great reputation which that wonder-working saint maintained throughout the Middle Ages. The book is not properly a biography, but a catalogue of miracles, told in all the simplicity of absolute belief. The power to work miraculous signs is assumed to be in direct proportion to holiness, and is by Severus valued merely as an evidence of holiness, which he is persuaded can only be attained through a life of isolation from the world. In the first of his Dialogues (fair models of Cicero), Severus puts into the mouth of an interlocutor (Posthumianus) a pleasing description of the life of coenobites and solitaries in the deserts bordering on Egypt. The main evidence of the virtue attained by them lies in the voluntary subjection to them of the savage beasts among which they lived. But Severus was no indiscriminating adherent of monasticism. The same dialogue shows him to be alive to its dangers and defects. The second dialogue is a large appendix to the Life of Martin, and really supplies more information of his life as bishop and of his views than the work which bears the title &quot;Vita S. Martini&quot;. The two dialogues occasionally make interesting references to personages of the epoch. In Dial. 1, cc. 6, 7, we have a vivid picture of the controversies which raged at Alexandria over the works of Origen. The judgement of Severus himself is no doubt that which he puts in the mouth of his interlocutor Posthumianus: &quot;I am astonished that one and the same man could have so far differed from himself that in the approved portion of his works he has no equal since the apostles, while in that portion for which he is justly blamed it is proved that no man has committed more unseemly errors.&quot; Three Epistles on the death of Martin (ad Eusebium, ad Aurelium diaconum, ad Bassulam) complete the list of Severus&#x27; genuine works. Other letters (to his sister), on the love of God and the renunciation of the world, have not survived.

===Spurious attributions===
Beside the above-mentioned three letters, seven others have been attributed to Severus. These are rejected as spurious by some critics, whilst the genuineness of the first two is admitted, rightly it would seem, by others. The &quot;World Chronicle&quot; of the so-called Sulpicius Severus has nothing to do with the subject of this biography; it was written in Spain in the sixth century.

==Sources==
The text of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; rests on a single 11th century manuscript, one of the Palatine collection now in the Vatican; of the other works manuscripts are abundant, the best being one of the 6th century at Verona. Some spurious letters bear the name of Severus; also in a manuscript at Madrid is a work falsely professing to be an epitome of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; of Severus, and going down to 511. The chief editions of the complete works of Severus are those by De Prato (Verona, 1741) and by Halm (forming volume i. of the &quot;Corpus scriptorum ecclesiasticorum Latinorum&quot;, Vienna, 1866). There is a most admirable monograph on the &quot;Chronicle&quot; by J. Bernays (Berlin, 1861). See also Goelzer, Grammaticae in Sulp. Severum observationes (1884) (thesis).

==Bibliography==
Severus&#x27; works are to be found in P.L. 20, 95-248; later edition by Karl Halm, &quot;Opera&quot;, CSEL 1 (Vienna, 1866) (on Google Books)

<doc id="29645" wikidata="Q1962894" url="?curid=29645" title="Scared to Death (1947 film)">
<text>Scared to Death is a 1947 American gothic thriller film directed by Christy Cabanne and starring Bela Lugosi, George Zucco, Nat Pendleton and Molly Lamont. The picture was filmed in Cinecolor. The film is historically important as the only color film in which Bela Lugosi has a starring role. Lionel Atwill was originally slated to appear in the film, but he was too ill to work, so George Zucco replaced him in the cast. Christy Cabanne completed the film in early 1946, but it wasn&#x27;t screened until 1947.

== Plot ==

The film opens with the disclosure by morgue examiners that a beautiful woman has literally died of fright. The plot reveals how she reached the fatal stage of terror.

The woman is married to the son of a doctor, the proprietor of a private sanatorium, where she is under unwilling treatment. Both the son and the doctor indicate they want the marriage dissolved. Arriving at the scene is a mysterious personage (Bela Lugosi) identified as the doctor&#x27;s cousin who had been a stage magician in Europe. He is accompanied by a threatening dwarf (Angelo Rossitto).

After it is apparent that the wife is terrified of the foreigners, it is disclosed that she is the former wife and stage partner of a Paris magician known as René, who was believed to have been shot by the Nazis. Attempts to draw a confession that she had betrayed her magician husband and had collaborated with the Nazis led to the use of a device employing a death mask of the supposedly dead patriot, which literally frightens her to death.

Although the young newspaperman hero and his sweetheart guess the answer to the story, they allow the diagnosis &quot;scared to death&quot; to stand.

== Cast ==
* Bela Lugosi as Prof. Leonide
* George Zucco as Dr. Joseph Van Ee
* Nat Pendleton as Bill Raymond
* Molly Lamont as Laura Van Ee / Laurette La Valle 
* Joyce Compton as Jane Cornell
* Gladys Blake as Lilybeth
* Roland Varno as Ward Van Ee
* Douglas Fowley as Terry Lee
* Stanley Andrews as Pathologist
* Angelo Rossitto as Indigo
* Lee Bennett as Rene
* Stanley Price as Autopsy Surgeon

== Production ==
The film was based on a one-act play which in turn was based on a 1933 murder case involving Dr. Alice Wynekoop.

The film was announced in March 1946 as &quot;Accent on Horror&quot;. &quot;The Autopsy&quot; was another title that was considered.

==Reviews==
Historian Gary Don Rhodes commented that although the film was in color, &quot;nothing manages to stave off the inevitable boredom. Critics found the film confusing, dull...Very possibly this remains Lugosi&#x27;s worst horror film.&quot;

<text>Stefan Banach ( ; 30 March 1892 – 31 August 1945) was a Polish mathematician who is generally considered one of the 20th century&#x27;s most important and influential mathematicians. He was the founder of modern functional analysis, and an original member of the Lwów School of Mathematics. His major work was the 1932 book, &quot;Théorie des opérations linéaires&quot; (Theory of Linear Operations), the first monograph on the general theory of functional analysis.

Born in Kraków to a family of Goral descent, Banach showed a keen interest in mathematics and engaged in solving mathematical problems during school recess. After completing his secondary education, he befriended Hugo Steinhaus, with whom he established the Polish Mathematical Society in 1919 and later published the scientific journal &quot;Studia Mathematica&quot;. In 1920, he received an assistantship at the Lwów Polytechnic, subsequently becoming a professor in 1922 and a member of the Polish Academy of Learning in 1924. Banach was also a co-founder of the Lwów School of Mathematics, a school of thought comprising some of the most renowned Polish mathematicians of the interwar period (1918–1939).

Some of the notable mathematical concepts that bear Banach&#x27;s name include Banach spaces, Banach algebras, Banach measures, the Banach–Tarski paradox, the Hahn–Banach theorem, the Banach–Steinhaus theorem, the Banach–Mazur game, the Banach–Alaoglu theorem, and the Banach fixed-point theorem.

==Life==

===Early life===
Stefan Banach was born on 30 March 1892 at St. Lazarus General Hospital in Kraków, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, into a Góral Roman Catholic family, and was subsequently baptised by his father. Banach&#x27;s parents were Stefan Greczek and Katarzyna Banach, both natives of the Podhale region. Greczek was a soldier in the Austro-Hungarian Army stationed in Kraków. Little is known about Banach&#x27;s mother. According to his baptismal certificate, she was born in Borówna and worked as a domestic helper.

Unusually, Stefan&#x27;s surname was his mother&#x27;s instead of his father&#x27;s, though he received his father&#x27;s given name, Stefan. Military regulations did not permit soldiers of Stefan Greczek&#x27;s rank to marry; he was a private and as the mother was too poor to support the child, the couple decided that he should be reared by family and friends. Stefan spent the first few years of his life with his grandmother, but when she was taken ill, Greczek arranged for his son to be raised by Franciszka Płowa and her niece Maria Puchalska in Kraków. Young Stefan came to regard Franciszka as his foster mother and Maria as his older sister. In his early years Banach was tutored by Juliusz Mien, a French intellectual and friend of the Płowa family, who had emigrated to Poland and supported himself with photography and translations of Polish literature into French. Mien taught Banach French and most likely encouraged him in his early mathematical pursuits.

In 1902, Banach, aged 10, enrolled in Kraków&#x27;s &quot;IV Gymnasium&quot; (also known as the &quot;Goetz Gymnasium&quot;). While the school specialized in the humanities, Banach and his best friend Witold Wiłkosz (also a future mathematician) spent most of their time working on mathematics problems during breaks and after school. Later in life Banach credited Dr. Kamil Kraft, the mathematics and physics teacher at the school, with kindling his interests in mathematics. While Banach was a diligent student he did, on occasion, receive low grades (he failed Greek during his first semester at the school) and later spoke critically of the school&#x27;s math teachers.

After obtaining his &quot;matura&quot; (high school degree) at age 18 in 1910, Banach moved to Lwów (today called Lviv) with the intention of studying at the Lwów Polytechnic. He initially chose engineering as his field of study since at the time he was convinced that there was nothing new to discover in mathematics. At some point he also attended Jagiellonian University in Kraków on a part-time basis. As Banach had to earn money to support his studies it was not until 1914 that he finally, at age 22, passed his high school graduation exams.

When World War I broke out, Banach was excused from military service due to his left-handedness and poor vision. When the Russian Army opened its offensive toward Lwów, Banach left for Kraków, where he spent the rest of the war. He made his living as a tutor at the local schools, worked in a bookstore and as a foreman of a road building crew. He attended some lectures at the Jagiellonian University at that time, including those of the famous Polish mathematicians Stanisław Zaremba and Kazimierz Żorawski, but little is known of that period of his life.

===Discovery by Steinhaus===

In 1916, in Kraków&#x27;s &quot;Planty&quot; park, Banach encountered Professor Hugo Steinhaus, one of the renowned mathematicians of the time. According to Steinhaus, while he was strolling through the gardens he was surprised to overhear the term &quot;Lebesgue integral&quot; (Lebesgue integration was at the time still a fairly new idea in mathematics) and walked over to investigate. As a result, he met Banach, as well as Otto Nikodym. Steinhaus became fascinated with the self-taught young mathematician. The encounter resulted in a long-lasting collaboration and friendship. In fact, soon after the encounter Steinhaus invited Banach to solve some problems he had been working on but which had proven difficult. Banach solved them within a week and the two soon published their first joint work (&quot;On the Mean Convergence of Fourier Series&quot;). Steinhaus, Banach and Nikodym, along with several other Kraków mathematicians (Władysław Ślebodziński, Leon Chwistek, Alfred Rosenblatt and Włodzimierz Stożek) also established a mathematical society, which eventually became the Polish Mathematical Society. The society was officially founded on 2 April 1919. It was also through Steinhaus that Banach met his future wife, Łucja Braus.

===Interbellum===

Steinhaus introduced Banach to academic circles and substantially accelerated his career. After Poland regained independence in 1918, Banach was given an assistantship at the Lwów Polytechnic. Steinhaus&#x27; backing also allowed him to receive a doctorate without actually graduating from a university. The doctoral thesis, accepted by King John II Casimir University of Lwów in 1920 and published in 1922, included the basic ideas of functional analysis, which was soon to become an entirely new branch of mathematics. In his dissertation, written in 1920, he axiomatically defined what is today called a Banach space. The thesis was widely discussed in academic circles and allowed him in 1922 to become a professor at the Lwów Polytechnic. Initially an assistant to Professor Antoni Łomnicki, in 1927, Banach received his own chair. In 1924 he was accepted as a member of the Polish Academy of Learning. At the same time, from 1922, Banach also headed the second Chair of Mathematics at University of Lwów.

Young and talented, Banach gathered around him a large group of mathematicians. The group, meeting in the Scottish Café, soon gave birth to the &quot;Lwów School of Mathematics&quot;. In 1929 the group began publishing its own journal, &quot;Studia Mathematica&quot;, devoted primarily to Banach&#x27;s field of study—functional analysis. Around that time, Banach also began working on his best-known work, the first monograph on the general theory of linear-metric space. First published in Polish in 1931, the next year it was also translated into French and gained wider recognition in European academic circles. The book was also the first in a long series of mathematics monographs edited by Banach and his circle. On 17 June 1924, Banach become a correspondence member of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Fine Arts in Kraków.

===World War II===

After the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, Lwów came under the control of the Soviet Union for almost two years. Banach, from 1939 a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, and on good terms with Soviet mathematicians, had to promise to learn Ukrainian to be allowed to keep his chair and continue his academic activities. After the German takeover of Lwów in 1941 during Operation Barbarossa, all universities were closed and Banach, along with many colleagues and his son, was employed as a lice feeder at Professor Rudolf Weigl&#x27;s Typhus Research Institute. Employment in Weigl&#x27;s Institute provided many unemployed university professors and their associates protection from random arrest and deportation to Nazi concentration camps.

After the Soviet Red Army recaptured Lviv in the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive of 1944, Banach returned to the university and helped re-establish it after the war years. However, because the Soviets were deporting Poles from annexed formerly Polish eastern territories, Banach began preparing to leave the city and settle in Kraków, Poland, where he had been promised a chair at the Jagiellonian University. He was also considered a candidate for Minister of Education of Poland. In January 1945, he was diagnosed with lung cancer and was permitted to stay in Lwów. He died on 31 August 1945, aged 53. His funeral at the Lychakiv Cemetery (&quot;Cmentarz Łyczakowski&quot;) was attended by hundreds of people.

==Contributions==
Banach&#x27;s dissertation, completed in 1920 and published in 1922, formally axiomatized the concept of a complete normed vector space and laid the foundations for the area of functional analysis. In this work Banach called such spaces &quot;class E-spaces&quot;, but in his 1932 book, &quot;Théorie des opérations linéaires&quot;, he changed terminology and referred to them as &quot;spaces of type B&quot;, which most likely contributed to the subsequent eponymous naming of these spaces after him. The theory of what came to be known as Banach spaces had antecedents in the work of the Hungarian mathematician Frigyes Riesz (published in 1916) and contemporaneous contributions from Hans Hahn and Norbert Wiener. For a brief period in fact, complete normed linear spaces were referred to as &quot;Banach–Wiener&quot; spaces in mathematical literature, based on terminology introduced by Wiener himself. However, because Wiener&#x27;s work on the topic was limited, the established name became just &quot;Banach spaces&quot;.

Likewise, Banach&#x27;s fixed point theorem, based on earlier methods developed by Charles Émile Picard, was included in his dissertation, and was later extended by his students (for example in the Banach–Schauder theorem) and other mathematicians (in particular Brouwer and Poincaré and Birkhoff). The theorem did not require linearity of the space, and applied to any complete Cauchy space (in particular to any complete metric space).
The Hahn–Banach theorem is one of the fundamental theorems of functional analysis. Further theorems related to Banach are:

* Banach–Tarski paradox
* Banach–Steinhaus theorem
* Banach–Alaoglu theorem
* Banach–Stone theorem

==Recognition==
In 1946, the Stefan Banach Prize (Polish: &quot;Nagroda im. Stefana Banacha&quot;) was established by the Polish Mathematical Society. In 1992, the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences established a special Stefan Banach Medal for outstanding achievements in mathematical sciences. Since 2009, the International Stefan Banach Prize has been conferred by the Polish Mathematical Society to mathematicians for best doctoral dissertations in the mathematical sciences with the objective to &quot;promote and financially support the most promising young researchers&quot;.

Stefan Banach is the patron of a number of schools and streets including in Warsaw, Lviv, Świdnica, Toruń and Jarosław.

In 2001, a minor planet 16856 Banach, discovered by Paul Comba in 1997, was named after him.

In 2012, the National Bank of Poland celebrated the mathematician&#x27;s achievements by issuing a series of commemorative coins designed by Robert Kotowicz (golden 200-zloty coin, silver 10-zloty coin and Nordic Gold 2-zloty coin).

In 2016, a commemorative bench featuring Banach and Otto Nikodym was unveiled in Kraków&#x27;s Planty Park on the 100th anniversary of the conversation the two mathematicians held when they first met Hugo Steinhaus, which proved instrumental in the development of his scientific career.

In 2021, one of the episodes of Polish documentary TV series &quot;Geniusze i marzyciele&quot; (Geniuses and Dreamers) aired on TVP1 and TVP Dokument channels was devoted to Stefan Banach.

In 2022, Google Doodle commemorated the 100th anniversary of Banach receiving his title of professor.

<text>A single-lens reflex camera (SLR) is a camera that typically uses a mirror and prism system (hence &quot;reflex&quot; from the mirror&#x27;s reflection) that permits the photographer to view through the lens and see exactly what will be captured. With twin lens reflex and rangefinder cameras, the viewed image could be significantly different from the final image. When the shutter button is pressed on most SLRs, the mirror flips out of the light path, allowing light to pass through to the light receptor and the image to be captured.

== History ==

Until the development of SLR, all cameras with viewfinders had two optical light paths: one through the lens to the film, and another positioned above (TLR or &quot;twin-lens reflex&quot;) or to the side (rangefinder). Because the viewfinder and the film lens cannot share the same optical path, the viewing lens is aimed to intersect with the film lens at a fixed point somewhere in front of the camera. This is not problematic for pictures taken at a middle or longer distance, but parallax causes framing errors in close-up shots. Moreover, it is not easy to focus the lens of a fast reflex camera when it is opened to wider apertures (such as in low light or while using low-speed film).

Most SLR cameras permit upright and laterally correct viewing through use of a roof pentaprism situated in the optical path between the reflex mirror and viewfinder. Light, which comes both horizontally and vertically inverted after passing through the lens, is reflected upwards by the reflex mirror, into the pentaprism where it is reflected twice to correct the inversions caused by the lens, and align the image with the viewfinder. When the shutter is released, the mirror moves out of the light path, and the light shines directly onto the film (or in the case of a DSLR, the CCD or CMOS imaging sensor). Exceptions to the moving mirror system include the Canon Pellix and Sony SLT cameras, along with several special-purpose high-speed cameras (such as the Canon EOS-1N RS), whose mirror was a fixed beamsplitting pellicle.

Focus can be adjusted manually by the photographer or automatically by an autofocus system. The viewfinder can include a matte focusing screen located just above the mirror system to diffuse the light. This permits accurate viewing, composing and focusing, especially useful with interchangeable lenses.

Up until the 1990s, SLR was the most advanced photographic preview system available, but the recent development and refinement of digital imaging technology with an on-camera live LCD preview screen has overshadowed SLR&#x27;s popularity. Nearly all inexpensive compact digital cameras now include an LCD preview screen allowing the photographer to see what the CCD is capturing. However, SLR is still popular in high-end and professional cameras because they are system cameras with interchangeable parts, allowing customization. They also have far less shutter lag, allowing photographs to be timed more precisely. Also the pixel resolution, contrast ratio, refresh rate, and color gamut of an LCD preview screen cannot compete with the clarity and shadow detail of a direct-viewed optical SLR viewfinder.

Large format SLR cameras were probably first marketed with the introduction of C.R. Smith&#x27;s &quot;Monocular Duplex&quot; (U.S., 1884). SLRs for smaller exposure formats were launched in the 1920s by several camera makers. The first 35 mm SLR available to the mass market, Leica&#x27;s PLOOT reflex housing along with a 200 mm f4.5 lens paired to a 35 mm rangefinder camera body, debuted in 1935. The Soviet &quot;Спорт&quot; (“Sport”), also a 24 mm by 36 mm image size, was prototyped in 1934 and went to market in 1937. K. Nüchterlein&#x27;s Kine Exakta (Germany, 1936) was the first integrated 35 mm SLR to enter the market. Additional Exakta models, all with waist-level finders, were produced up to and during World War II. Another ancestor of the modern SLR camera was the Swiss-made Alpa, which was innovative, and influenced the later Japanese cameras. The first eye-level SLR viewfinder was patented in Hungary on August 23, 1943, by Jenő Dulovits, who then designed the first 35 mm camera with one, the Duflex, which used a system of mirrors to provide a laterally correct, upright image in the eye-level viewfinder. The Duflex, which went into serial production in 1948, was also the world&#x27;s first SLR with an instant-return (a.k.a. autoreturn) mirror.

The first commercially produced SLR that employed a roof pentaprism was the Italian Rectaflex A.1000, shown in full working condition on Milan fair April 1948 and produced from September the same year, thus being on the market one year before the east German Zeiss Ikon VEB Contax S, announced on May 20, 1949, produced from September.

The Japanese adopted and further developed the SLR. In 1952, Asahi developed the Asahiflex and in 1954, the Asahiflex IIB. In 1957, the Asahi Pentax combined the fixed pentaprism and the right-hand thumb wind lever. Nikon, Canon and Yashica introduced their first SLRs in 1959 (the F, Canonflex, and Pentamatic, respectively).

== Digital SLRs ==
Canon, Nikon and Pentax have all developed digital SLR cameras (DSLRs) using the same lens mounts as on their respective film SLR cameras. Konica Minolta did the same, and after having bought Konica Minolta&#x27;s camera division in 2006. Sony continues using the Minolta AF lens mount in their DSLRs, including cameras built around a semi-transparent fixed mirror. Samsung builds DSLRs based on the Pentax lens mount. Olympus, on the other hand, chose to create a new digital-only Four Thirds System SLR standard, adopted later by Panasonic and Leica.

Contax came out with a DSLR model, the Contax N-Digital. This model was too late and too expensive to be competitive with other camera manufacturers. The Contax N-digital was the last Contax to use that maker&#x27;s lens system, and the camera, while having impressive features such as a full-frame sensor, was expensive and lacked sufficient write-speed to the memory card for it to be seriously considered by some professional photographers.

The digital single-lens reflex camera have largely replaced film SLRs design in convenience, sales and popularity at the start of the 21st century.

== Optical components ==

A cross-section (&quot;or&quot; &#x27;side-view&#x27;) of the optical components of a typical SLR camera shows how the light passes through the lens assembly, is reflected by the mirror placed at a 45-degree angle, and is projected on the matte focusing screen. Via a condensing lens and internal reflections in the roof pentaprism the image appears in the eyepiece. When an image is taken, the mirror moves upwards from its resting position in the direction of the arrow, the focal plane shutter opens, and the image is projected onto the film or sensor in exactly the same manner as on the focusing screen.

This feature distinguishes SLRs from other cameras as the photographer sees the image composed exactly as it will be captured on the film or sensor.

Most 35 mm SLRs use a roof pentaprism or penta-mirror to direct the light to the eyepiece, first used on the 1948 Duflex constructed by Jenő Dulovits and patented August 1943 (Hungary). With this camera also appeared the first instant-return mirror.
The first Japanese pentaprism SLR was the 1955 Miranda T, followed by the Asahi Pentax, Minolta SR-2, Zunow, Nikon F and the Yashica Pentamatic. Some SLRs offered removable pentaprisms with optional viewfinder capabilities, such as the waist-level finder, the interchangeable sports finders used on the Canon F1 and F1n; the Nikon F, F2, F3, F4 and F5; and the Pentax LX.

Another prism design was the porro prism system used in the Olympus Pen F, the Pen FT, the Pen FV half-frame 35 mm SLR cameras. This was later used on the Olympus EVOLT E-3x0 series, the Leica Digilux 3 and the Panasonic DMC-L1.

A right-angle finder is available that slips onto the eyepiece of most SLRs and D-SLRs and allows viewing through a waist-level viewfinder. There is also a finder that provides EVF remote capability.

== Shutter mechanisms ==
Almost all contemporary SLRs use a focal-plane shutter located in front of the film plane, which prevents the light from reaching the film even if the lens is removed, except when the shutter is actually released during the exposure. There are various designs for focal plane shutters. Early focal-plane shutters designed from the 1930s onwards usually consisted of two curtains that travelled horizontally across the film gate: an opening shutter curtain followed by a closing shutter curtain. During fast shutter speeds, the focal-plane shutter would form a &#x27;slit&#x27; whereby the second shutter curtain was closely following the first opening shutter curtain to produce a narrow, vertical opening, with the shutter slit moving horizontally. The slit would get narrower as shutter speeds were increased. Initially these shutters were made from a cloth material (which was in later years often rubberised), but some manufacturers used other materials instead. Nippon Kōgaku (now Nikon Corporation), for example, used titanium foil shutters for several of their flagship SLR cameras, including the Nikon F, F2, and F3.

Other focal-plane shutter designs, such as the Copal Square, travelled vertically — the shorter travelling distance of 24 millimetres (as opposed to 36 mm horizontally) meant that minimum exposure and flash synchronisation times could be reduced. These shutters are usually manufactured from metal, and use the same moving-slit principle as horizontally travelling shutters. They differ, though, in usually being formed of several slats or blades, rather than single curtains as with horizontal designs, as there is rarely enough room above and below the frame for a one-piece shutter. Vertical shutters became very common in the 1980s (though Konica, Mamiya, and Copal first pioneered their use in the 1950s and 1960s, and are almost exclusively used for new cameras. Nikon used Copal-made vertical plane shutters in their Nikomat/Nikkormat -range, enabling x-sync speeds from to while the only choice for focal plane shutters at that time was . Later, Nikon again pioneered the use of titanium for vertical shutters, using a special honeycomb pattern on the blades to reduce their weight and achieve world-record speeds in 1982 of second for non-sync shooting, and with x-sync. Nowadays most such shutters are manufactured from cheaper aluminium (though some high-end cameras use materials such as carbon-fibre and Kevlar).

Another shutter system is the leaf shutter, whereby the shutter is constructed of diaphragm-like blades and can be situated either between the lens or behind the lens. If the shutter is part of a lens assembly some other mechanism is required to ensure that no light reaches the film between exposures. An example of a behind-the-lens leaf shutter is found in the 35 mm SLRs produced by Kodak, with their Retina Reflex camera line; Topcon, with their Auto 100; and Kowa with their SE-R and SET-R reflexes. A primary example of a medium-format SLR with a between-the-lens leaf shutter system would be Hasselblad, with their 500C, 500 cm, 500 EL-M (a motorized Hasselblad) and other models (producing a 6 cm square negative). Hasselblads use an auxiliary shutter blind situated behind the lens mount and the mirror system to prevent the fogging of film. Other medium-format SLRs also using leaf shutters include the now discontinued Zenza-Bronica camera system lines such as the Bronica ETRs, the ETRs&#x27;i (both producing a 6 × 4.5 cm. image), the SQ and the SQ-AI (producing a 6 × 6 cm image like the Hasselblad), and the Zenza-Bronica G system (6 × 7 cm). Certain Mamiya medium-format SLRs, discontinued camera systems such as the Kowa 6 and a few other camera models also used between-the-lens leaf shutters in their lens systems. Thus, any time a photographer purchased one of these lenses, that lens included a leaf shutter in its lens mount. Because leaf shutters synchronized electronic flash at all shutter speeds especially at fast shutter speeds of of a second or faster, cameras using leaf shutters were more desirable to studio photographers who used sophisticated studio electronic flash systems. Some manufacturers of medium-format 120 film SLR cameras also made leaf-shutter lenses for their focal-plane-shutter models. Rollei made at least two such lenses for their Rolleiflex SL-66 medium format which was a focal-plane shutter SLR. Rollei later switched to a camera system of leaf-shutter design (e.g., the 6006 and 6008 reflexes) and their current medium-format SLRs are now all of the between-the-lens shutter design.

== Further developments ==

Since the technology became widespread in the 1970s, SLRs have become the main photographic instrument used by dedicated amateur photographers and professionals. Some photographers of static subjects (such as architecture, landscape, and some commercial subjects), however, prefer view cameras because of the capability to control perspective. With a triple-extension bellows 4&quot; × 5&quot; camera such as the Linhof SuperTechnika V, the photographer can correct certain distortions such as &quot;keystoning&quot;, where the image &#x27;lines&#x27; converge (i.e., photographing a building by pointing a typical camera upward to include the top of the building). Perspective correction lenses are available in the 35 mm and medium formats to correct this distortion with film cameras, and it can also be corrected after the fact with photo software when using digital cameras. The photographer can also extend the bellows to its full length, tilt the front standard and perform photomacrography (commonly known as &#x27;macro photography&#x27;), producing a sharp image with depth-of-field without stopping down the lens diaphragm.

== Film formats ==
Early SLRs were built for large format photography, but this film format has largely lost favor among professional photographers. SLR film-based cameras have been produced for most film formats as well as for digital formats. These film-based SLRs use the 35 mm format as, this film format offers a variety of emulsions and film sensitivity speeds, usable image quality and a good market cost. 35 mm film comes in a variety of exposure lengths: 20 exposure, 24 exposure and 36 exposure rolls. Medium format SLRs provide a higher-quality image with a negative that can be more easily retouched than the smaller 35 mm negative, when this capability is required.

A small number of SLRs were built for APS such as the Canon IX series and the Nikon Pronea cameras. SLRs were also introduced for film formats as small as Kodak&#x27;s 110, such as the Pentax Auto 110, which had interchangeable lenses.

The Narciss camera is an all-metal 16 mm subminiature single lens reflex camera made by Russian optic firm Krasnogorsky Mekhanichesky Zavod (KMZ) Narciss (Soviet Union; Нарцисс) between 1961 and 1965.

== Common features ==

Other features found on many SLR cameras include through-the-lens (TTL) metering and sophisticated flash control referred to as &quot;dedicated electronic flash&quot;. In a dedicated system, once the dedicated electronic flash is inserted into the camera&#x27;s hot shoe and turned on, there is then communication between camera and flash. The camera&#x27;s synchronization speed is set, along with the aperture. Many camera models measure the light that reflects off of the film plane, which controls the flash duration of the electronic flash. This is denoted TTL flash metering.

Some electronic flash units can send out several short bursts of light to aid the autofocus system or for wireless communication with off-camera flash units. A pre-flash is often used to determine the amount of light that is reflected from the subject, which sets the duration of the main flash at time of exposure. Some cameras also employ automatic fill-flash, where the flash light and the available light are balanced. While these capabilities are not unique to the SLR, manufacturers included them early on in the top models, whereas the best rangefinder cameras adopted such features later.

== Design considerations ==

Many of the advantages of SLR cameras derive from viewing and focusing the image through the attached lens. Most other types of cameras do not have this function; subjects are seen through a viewfinder that is near the lens, making the photographer&#x27;s view different from that of the lens. SLR cameras provide photographers with precision; they provide a viewing image that will be exposed onto the negative exactly as it is seen through the lens. There is no parallax error, and exact focus can be confirmed by eye—especially in macro photography and when photographing using long focus lenses. The depth of field may be seen by stopping down to the attached lens aperture, which is possible on most SLR cameras except for the least expensive models. Because of the SLR&#x27;s versatility, most manufacturers have a vast range of lenses and accessories available for them.

Compared to most fixed-lens compact cameras, the most commonly used and inexpensive SLR lenses offer a wider aperture range and larger maximum aperture (typically to for a 50 mm lens). This allows photographs to be taken in lower light conditions without flash, and allows a narrower depth of field, which is useful for blurring the background behind the subject, making the subject more prominent. &quot;Fast&quot; lenses are commonly used in theater photography, portrait photography, surveillance photography, and all other photography requiring a large maximum aperture.
The variety of lenses also allows for the camera to be used and adapted in many different situations. This provides the photographer with considerably more control (i.e., how the image is viewed and framed) than would be the case with a view camera. In addition, some SLR lenses are manufactured with extremely long focal lengths, allowing a photographer to be a considerable distance away from the subject and yet still expose a sharp, focused image. This is particularly useful if the subject includes dangerous animals (e.g., wildlife); the subject prefers anonymity to being photographed; or else, the photographer&#x27;s presence is unwanted (e.g., celebrity photography or surveillance photography). Practically all SLR and DSLR camera bodies can also be attached to telescopes and microscopes via an adapter tube to further enhance their imaging capabilities.


In most cases, single-lens reflex cameras cannot be made as small or as light as other camera designs—such as rangefinder cameras, autofocus compact cameras and digital cameras with electronic viewfinders (EVF)—owing to the mirror box and pentaprism/pentamirror. The mirror box also prevents lenses with deeply recessed rear elements from being mounted close to the film or sensor unless the camera has a mirror lockup feature; this means that simple designs for wide angle lenses cannot be used. Instead, larger and more complex retrofocus designs are required.

The SLR mirror &#x27;blacks-out&#x27; the viewfinder image during the exposure. In addition, the movement of the reflex mirror takes time, limiting the maximum shooting speed. The mirror system can also cause noise and vibration. Partially reflective (pellicle) fixed mirrors avoid these problems and have been used in a very few designs including the Canon Pellix and the Canon EOS-1N RS, but these designs introduce their own problems. These pellicle mirrors reduce the amount of light travelling to the film plane or sensor and also can distort the light passing through them, resulting in a less-sharp image. To avoid the noise and vibration, many professional cameras offer a mirror lock-up feature, however, this feature totally disables the SLR&#x27;s automatic focusing ability. Electronic viewfinders have the potential to give the &#x27;viewing-experience&#x27; of a DSLR (through-the-lens viewing) without many of the disadvantages. More recently, Sony have resurrected the pellicle mirror concept in their &quot;single-lens translucent&quot; (SLT) range of cameras.

SLRs vary widely in their construction and typically have bodies made of plastic or magnesium. Most manufacturers do not cite durability specifications, but some report shutter life expectancies for professional models. For instance, the Canon EOS 1Ds MkII is rated for 200,000 shutter cycles and the Nikon D3 is rated for 300,000 with its exotic carbon fiber/kevlar shutter. Because many SLRs have interchangeable lenses, there is a tendency for dust, sand and dirt to get into the main body of the camera through the mirror box when the lens is removed, thus dirtying or even jamming the mirror movement mechanism or the shutter curtain mechanism itself. In addition, these particles can also jam or otherwise hinder the focusing feature of a lens if they enter into the focusing helicoid. The problem of sensor cleaning has been somewhat reduced in DSLRs as some cameras have a built-in sensor cleaning unit.

The price of SLRs in general also tends to be somewhat higher than that of other types of cameras, owing to their internal complexity. This is compounded by the expense of additional components, such as flashes or lenses. The initial investment in equipment can be prohibitive enough to keep some casual photographers away from SLRs, although the market for used SLRs has become larger particularly as photographers migrate to digital systems.


== Future ==
The digital single-lens reflex camera has largely replaced the film SLR for its convenience, sales, and popularity at the start of the 21st century. These cameras were the marketing favorite among advanced amateur and professional photographers through the first two decades of the 2000s. Around 2010, the mirrorless technology utilized in point and shoot cameras made the way to the interchangeable lens cameras and slowly replaced DSLR technology.

As of 2022, all the major camera brands (Except Pentax) ceased development and production of DSLRs and moved on to mirrorless systems. These systems offer multiple advantages to the photographer with regards to autofocus systems as well as the ability to update the lens technologies due to the reduced distance between the back of the lens and the sensor resulting from the removal of the mirror. 

Film-based SLRs are still used by a niche market of enthusiasts and format lovers.

<doc id="29652" wikidata="Q1034350" url="?curid=29652" title="Senary">
<text>A senary () numeral system (also known as base-6, heximal, or seximal) has six as its base. It has been adopted independently by a small number of cultures. Like the decimal base 10, the base is a semiprime, though it is unique as the product of the only two consecutive numbers that are both prime (2 and 3). As six is a superior highly composite number, many of the arguments made in favor of the duodecimal system also apply to the senary system.

==Formal definition==
The standard set of digits in the senary system is formula_1, with the linear order formula_2. Let formula_3 be the Kleene closure of formula_4, where formula_5 is the operation of string concatenation for formula_6. The senary number system for natural numbers formula_7 is the quotient set formula_8 equipped with a shortlex order, where the equivalence class formula_9 is formula_10. As formula_7 has a shortlex order, it is isomorphic to the natural numbers formula_12.

==Mathematical properties==
When expressed in senary, all prime numbers other than 2 and 3 have 1 or 5 as the final digit. In senary, the prime numbers are written:

:2, 3, 5, 11, 15, 21, 25, 31, 35, 45, 51, 101, 105, 111, 115, 125, 135, 141, 151, 155, 201, 211, 215, 225, 241, 245, 251, 255, 301, 305, 331, 335, 345, 351, 405, 411, 421, 431, 435, 445, 455, 501, 515, 521, 525, 531, 551, ... 

That is, for every prime number &quot;p&quot; greater than 3, one has the modular arithmetic relations that either &quot;p&quot; ≡ 1 or 5 (mod 6) (that is, 6 divides either &quot;p&quot; − 1 or &quot;p&quot; − 5); the final digit is a 1 or a 5. This is proved by contradiction.

For any integer &quot;n&quot;:
* If &quot;n&quot; ≡ 0 (mod 6), 6 | &quot;n&quot;
* If &quot;n&quot; ≡ 2 (mod 6), 2 | &quot;n&quot;
* If &quot;n&quot; ≡ 3 (mod 6), 3 | &quot;n&quot;
* If &quot;n&quot; ≡ 4 (mod 6), 2 | &quot;n&quot;

Additionally, since the smallest four primes (2, 3, 5, 7) are either divisors or neighbors of 6, senary has simple divisibility tests for many numbers.

Furthermore, all even perfect numbers besides 6 have 44 as the final two digits when expressed in senary, which is proven by the fact that every even perfect number is of the form , where is prime.

Senary is also the largest number base &quot;r&quot; that has no totatives other than 1 and &quot;r&quot; − 1, making its multiplication table highly regular for its size, minimizing the amount of effort required to memorize its table. This property maximizes the probability that the result of an integer multiplication will end in zero, given that neither of its factors do.

If a number is divisible by 2, then the final digit of that number, when expressed in senary, is 0, 2, or 4.
If a number is divisible by 3, then the final digit of that number in senary is 0 or 3.
A number is divisible by 4 if its penultimate digit is odd and its final digit is 2, or its penultimate digit is even and its final digit is 0 or 4.
A number is divisible by 5 if the sum of its senary digits is divisible by 5 (the equivalent of casting out nines in decimal).
If a number is divisible by 6, then the final digit of that number is 0.
To determine whether a number is divisible by 7, one can sum its alternate digits and subtract those sums; if the result is divisible by 7, the number is divisible by 7, similar to the &quot;11&quot; divisibility test in decimal.

==Fractions==
Because six is the product of the first two prime numbers and is adjacent to the next two prime numbers, many senary fractions have simple representations:

==Finger counting==
Each regular human hand may be said to have six unambiguous positions; a fist, one finger extended, two, three, four, and then all five fingers extended.

If the right hand is used to represent a unit (0 to 5), and the left to represent the multiples of 6, then it becomes possible for one person to represent the values from zero to 55senary (35decimal) with their fingers, rather than the usual ten obtained in standard finger counting. e.g. if three fingers are extended on the left hand and four on the right, 34senary is represented. This is equivalent to 3 × 6 + 4, which is 22decimal.

Additionally, this method is the least abstract way to count using two hands that reflects the concept of positional notation, as the movement from one position to the next is done by switching from one hand to another. While most developed cultures count by fingers up to 5 in very similar ways, beyond 5 non-Western cultures deviate from Western methods, such as with Chinese number gestures. As senary finger counting also deviates only beyond 5, this counting method rivals the simplicity of traditional counting methods, a fact which may have implications for the teaching of positional notation to young students.

Which hand is used for the &#x27;sixes&#x27; and which the units is down to preference on the part of the counter; however, when viewed from the counter&#x27;s perspective, using the left hand as the most significant digit correlates with the written representation of the same senary number. Flipping the &#x27;sixes&#x27; hand around to its backside may help to further disambiguate which hand represents the &#x27;sixes&#x27; and which represents the units. The downside to senary counting, however, is that without prior agreement two parties would be unable to utilize this system, being unsure which hand represents sixes and which hand represents ones, whereas decimal-based counting (with numbers beyond 5 being expressed by an open palm and additional fingers) being essentially a unary system only requires the other party to count the number of extended fingers.

In NCAA basketball, the players&#x27; uniform numbers are restricted to be senary numbers of at most two digits, so that the referees can signal which player committed an infraction by using this finger-counting system.

More abstract finger counting systems, such as chisanbop or finger binary, allow counting to 99, 1023, or even higher depending on the method (though not necessarily senary in nature). The English monk and historian Bede, described in the first chapter of his work &quot;De temporum ratione&quot;, (725), titled &quot;&quot;Tractatus de computo, vel loquela per gestum digitorum&quot;,&quot; a system which allowed counting up to 9,999 on two hands.
==Natural languages==
Despite the rarity of cultures that group large quantities by 6, a review of the development of numeral systems suggests a threshold of numerosity at 6 (possibly being conceptualized as &quot;whole&quot;, &quot;fist&quot;, or &quot;beyond five fingers&quot;), with 1–6 often being pure forms, and numerals thereafter being constructed or borrowed.

The Ndom language of Western New Guinea, Indonesia, is reported to have senary numerals. &quot;Mer&quot; means 6, &quot;mer an thef&quot; means 6 × 2 = 12, &quot;nif&quot; means 36, and &quot;nif thef&quot; means 36 × 2 = 72.

Another example from Papua New Guinea are the Yam languages. In these languages, counting is connected to ritualized yam-counting. These languages count from a base six, employing words for the powers of six; running up to 66 for some of the languages. One example is Komnzo with the following numerals: &quot;nibo&quot; (61), &quot;fta&quot; (62 [36]), &quot;taruba&quot; (63 [216]), &quot;damno&quot; (64 [1296]), &quot;wärämäkä&quot; (65 [7776]), &quot;wi&quot; (66 [46656]).

Some Niger–Congo languages have been reported to use a senary number system, usually in addition to another, such as decimal or vigesimal.

Proto-Uralic has also been suspected to have had senary numerals, with a numeral for 7 being borrowed later, though evidence for constructing larger numerals (8 and 9) subtractively from ten suggests that this may not be so.

==Base 36 as senary compression==

For some purposes, senary might be too small a base for convenience. This can be worked around by using its square, base 36 (hexatrigesimal), as then conversion is facilitated by simply making the following replacements:

Thus, the base-36 number WIKI36 is equal to the senary number 523032306. In decimal, it is 1,517,058.

The choice of 36 as a radix is convenient in that the digits can be represented using the Arabic numerals 0–9 and the Latin letters A–Z; this choice is the basis of the base36 encoding scheme. The compression effect of 36 being the square of 6 causes a lot of patterns and representations to be shorter in base 36:

: = 0.046 = 0.436

: = 0.02136 = 0.2936

: = 0.6 = 0.36

: = 0.6 = 0.36

<doc id="29656" wikidata="Q181162" url="?curid=29656" title="Steve Ballmer">
<text>Steven Anthony Ballmer (; March 24, 1956) is an American businessman and investor who served as chief executive officer of Microsoft from 2000 to 2014. He is the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is a co-founder of Ballmer Group, a philanthropic investment company. As of November 2024, &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot; estimates his personal wealth at around $145 billion, making him the 10th-richest person in the world. At the same time &quot;Forbes&quot; ranks him as the eighth-richest person with a net worth of $123 billion.

Ballmer was hired by Bill Gates at Microsoft in 1980, and subsequently left the MBA program at Stanford University. He eventually became president in 1998, and replaced Gates as CEO on January 13, 2000. On February 4, 2014, Ballmer retired as CEO and was replaced by Satya Nadella; Ballmer remained on Microsoft&#x27;s board of directors until August 19, 2014. Under Ballmer&#x27;s leadership, a 14-year period, the company tripled sales and doubled profits, but lost its market dominance and missed out on 21st-century technology trends such as the ascendance of smartphones in the forms of iPhone and Android.

Players and sportswriters generally consider Ballmer&#x27;s ownership of the Clippers as an improvement over previous owner Donald Sterling, citing his willingness to acquire superstar players and finance the construction of Intuit Dome.

==Early life and education==
Steven Anthony Ballmer was born on March 24, 1956, in Detroit, Michigan, as the son of Beatrice Dworkin and Frederic Henry (Fritz Hans) Ballmer, a German born manager at the Ford Motor Company. Frederic (1923–2000) was from Zuchwil, Switzerland, and arrived in the United States in 1948. Through his mother, Ballmer is a second cousin of actress and comedian Gilda Radner. Ballmer grew up in the affluent community of Farmington Hills, Michigan. Ballmer also lived in Brussels from 1964 to 1967, where he attended the International School of Brussels.

In 1973, he attended college prep and engineering classes at Lawrence Technological University. He graduated as valedictorian from Detroit Country Day School, a private college preparatory school in Beverly Hills, Michigan, with a score of 790 on the mathematical section of the SAT and was a National Merit Scholar. 

Ballmer, the first in his family to graduate from college, attended Harvard College, where he was a manager for the Harvard Crimson football team and a member of the Fox Club, worked on &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; newspaper as well as the &quot;Harvard Advocate&quot;, and lived down the hall from fellow sophomore Bill Gates. He scored highly in the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, an exam sponsored by the Mathematical Association of America, scoring higher than Bill Gates. He graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; with a Bachelor of Arts in applied mathematics and economics in 1977.

Ballmer worked as an assistant product manager at Procter &amp; Gamble for two years, where he shared an office with Jeff Immelt, who later became CEO of General Electric. After briefly trying to write screenplays in Hollywood, he started attending the Stanford Graduate School of Business for his MBA (where Mukesh Ambani was his classmate), but dropped out in 1980 to join Microsoft.

==History with Microsoft==
Ballmer joined Microsoft on June 11, 1980, and became Microsoft&#x27;s 30th employee and the first business manager hired by Gates.

Ballmer joined Microsoft with a salary of $50,000 plus 10% of the profit he generated and no equity. However, Ballmer&#x27;s profit-share started to balloon out of control as Microsoft grew. When Dave Marquardt suggested for Microsoft to reorganize as a corporation instead of a private partnership, he proposed that Ballmer own 8% of the company in exchange for cancelling the profit-sharing model. Paul Allen initially disagreed, but Gates and Allen reached an agreement when Gates agreed to fund an outsized majority of Ballmer&#x27;s 8% stake. When Microsoft was incorporated in 1981, Ballmer owned 8% of the company. In 2003, Ballmer sold 39.3 million Microsoft shares for about $955 million, reducing his ownership to 4%. The same year, he replaced Microsoft&#x27;s employee stock options program.

In his first 20 years at the company, Ballmer headed several Microsoft divisions, including operations, operating systems development, and sales and support. In February 1992, he became Executive Vice President for Sales and Support. Ballmer led Microsoft&#x27;s development of the .NET Framework. Ballmer was promoted to President of Microsoft in July 1998, making him the &quot;de facto&quot; number two after the chairman and CEO, Bill Gates.

===Chief executive officer (2000–2014)===
On January 13, 2000, Ballmer was officially named the chief executive officer; he would shed the title of president in February 2001. As CEO, Ballmer handled company finances and daily operations, but Gates remained chairman of the board and still retained control of the &quot;technological vision&quot; as chief software architect. Gates relinquished day-to-day activities when he stepped down as chief software architect in 2006, while staying on as chairman, and that gave Ballmer the autonomy needed to make major management changes at Microsoft.

When Ballmer took over as CEO, the company was fighting an antitrust lawsuit brought on by the U.S. government and 20 states, plus class-action lawsuits and complaints from rival companies. While it was said that Gates would have continued fighting the federal suit, Ballmer sought to settle these, saying: &quot;Being the object of a lawsuit, effectively, or a complaint from your government is a very awkward, uncomfortable position to be in. It just has all downside. People assume if the government brought a complaint that there&#x27;s really a problem, and your ability to say we&#x27;re a good, proper, moral place is tough. It&#x27;s actually tough, even though you feel that way about yourselves.&quot;

Upon becoming CEO, Ballmer required detailed business justification to approve new products, rather than allowing hundreds of products that sounded potentially interesting or trendy. In 2005, he recruited B. Kevin Turner from Walmart, who was the president and CEO of Sam&#x27;s Club, to become Microsoft&#x27;s chief operating officer. Turner was hired at Microsoft to lead the company&#x27;s sales, marketing, and services group and to instill more process and discipline in the company&#x27;s operations and salesforce.

Since Bill Gates&#x27; retirement, Ballmer oversaw a &quot;dramatic shift away from the company&#x27;s PC-first heritage&quot;, replacing most major division heads in order to break down the &quot;talent-hoarding fiefdoms&quot;; in 2012, this led &quot;Businessweek&quot; to say that the company &quot;arguably [had] the best product lineup in its history&quot;. Ballmer drove Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;connected computing&quot; strategy with acquisitions such as Skype.

Under Ballmer&#x27;s tenure as CEO, Microsoft&#x27;s share price stagnated even as the company&#x27;s annual revenue surged from $25 billion to $70 billion, while its net income increased 215% to $23 billion, and its gross profit of 75 cents on every dollar in sales was double that of Google or IBM. With the company&#x27;s total annual profit growth of 16.4%, Ballmer&#x27;s tenure at Microsoft surpassed the performances of other well-known CEOs such as General Electric&#x27;s Jack Welch (11.2%) and IBM&#x27;s Louis V. Gerstner Jr. (2%). These gains came from the existing Windows and Office franchises, with Ballmer maintaining their profitability, fending off threats from competitors such as Linux and other open-source operating systems and Google Docs. Ballmer also built half a dozen new businesses, such as the data centers division and the Xbox entertainment and devices division ($8.9 billion), and oversaw the acquisition of Skype. Ballmer also constructed the company&#x27;s $20 billion Enterprise Business, consisting of new products and services such as Exchange, Windows Server, SQL Server, SharePoint, System Center, and Dynamics CRM, each of which initially faced an uphill battle for acceptance but have emerged as leading or dominant in each category. This diversified product mix helped to offset the company&#x27;s reliance on PCs and mobile computing devices as the company entered the post-PC era; in reporting quarterly results during April 2013, while Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 had not managed to increase their market share above single digits, the company increased its profit 19% over the previous quarter in 2012, as the Microsoft Business Division (including Office 365) and Server and Tools division (cloud services) are each larger than the Windows division.

Ballmer attracted criticism for failing to capitalize on several new consumer technologies, forcing Microsoft to play catch-up in the areas of tablet computing, smartphones and music players with mixed results. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, under Ballmer&#x27;s watch, &quot;In many cases, Microsoft latched onto technologies like smartphones, touchscreens, &#x27;smart&#x27; cars and wristwatches that read sports scores aloud long before Apple or Google did. But it repeatedly killed promising projects if they threatened its cash cows [Windows and Office].&quot; Ballmer was even named one of the worst CEOs of 2013 by the BBC. As a result of these many criticisms, in May 2012, hedge fund manager David Einhorn called on Ballmer to step down as CEO of Microsoft. &quot;His continued presence is the biggest overhang on Microsoft&#x27;s stock,&quot; Einhorn said in reference to Ballmer. In a May 2012 column in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, Adam Hartung described Ballmer as &quot;the worst CEO of a large publicly traded American company&quot;, saying he had &quot;steered Microsoft out of some of the fastest growing and most lucrative tech markets (mobile music, headsets and tablets)&quot;.

In 2009, and for the first time since Bill Gates resigned from day-to-day management at Microsoft, Ballmer delivered the opening keynote at CES.

As part of his plans to expand on hardware, on June 19, 2012, Ballmer revealed Microsoft&#x27;s first ever computer device, a tablet called Microsoft Surface at an event held in Hollywood, Los Angeles. He followed this by announcing the company&#x27;s purchase of Nokia&#x27;s mobile phone division in September 2013, his last major acquisition for Microsoft as CEO.

On August 23, 2013, Microsoft announced that Ballmer would retire within the next 12 months. A special committee that included Bill Gates would decide on the next CEO.

There was a list of potential successors to Ballmer as Microsoft CEO, but all had departed the company: Jim Allchin, Brad Silverberg, Paul Maritz, Nathan Myhrvold, Greg Maffei, Pete Higgins, Jeff Raikes, J. Allard, Robbie Bach, Bill Veghte, Ray Ozzie, Bob Muglia and Steven Sinofsky. B. Kevin Turner, Microsoft&#x27;s Chief Operating Officer (COO), was considered by some to be a &quot;de facto&quot; number two to Ballmer, with Turner having a strong grasp of business and operations but lacking technological vision. On February 4, 2014, Satya Nadella succeeded Ballmer as CEO.

===Public image===
Although as a child he was so shy that he would hyperventilate before Hebrew school, Ballmer is known for his energetic and exuberant personality, which is meant to motivate employees and partners, shouting so much that he needed surgery on his vocal cords.

Ballmer&#x27;s excited stage appearances at Microsoft events were widely circulated on the Internet as viral videos. One of his earliest known viral videos was a parody video, produced for Microsoft employees in 1986, promoting Windows 1.0 in the style of a Crazy Eddie commercial. Ballmer and Brian Valentine later repeated this in a spoof promotion of Windows XP.

A widely circulated video was his entrance on stage at Microsoft&#x27;s 25th anniversary event in September 2000, where Ballmer jumped across the stage and shouted, &quot;I love this company!&quot; Another viral video was captured at a Windows 2000 developers&#x27; conference, featuring a visibly perspiring Ballmer repeatedly chanting the word &quot;developers&quot;.

===Relationship with Bill Gates===
Ballmer was Gates&#x27; best man at his wedding to Melinda French, and the two men described their relationship as a marriage. They were so close for years that another Microsoft executive described it as a mind meld. Combative debates—a part of Microsoft&#x27;s corporate culture—that many observers believed were personal arguments occurred within the relationship; while Gates was glad in 2000 that Ballmer was willing to become CEO so he could focus on technology, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that there was tension surrounding the transition of authority. Things became so bitter that, on one occasion, Gates stormed out of a meeting after a shouting match in which Ballmer jumped to the defense of several colleagues, according to an individual present at the time. After the exchange, Ballmer seemed &quot;remorseful&quot;, the person said. Once Gates leaves, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to need him for anything. That&#x27;s the principle&quot;, Ballmer said. &quot;Use him, yes, need him, no&quot;.

In October 2014, a few months after Ballmer left his post at Microsoft, a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; profile stated that Ballmer and Gates no longer talk to each other due to animosity over Ballmer&#x27;s resignation. In a November 2016 interview, Ballmer said he and Gates have &quot;drifted apart&quot; ever since, saying that they always had a &quot;brotherly relationship&quot; beforehand. He said that his push into the hardware business, specifically smartphones, which Gates did not support, contributed to their relationship breakdown.

===Retirement===
After saying in 2008 that he intended to remain CEO for another decade, Ballmer announced his retirement in 2013, after losing billions of dollars in acquisitions and on the Surface tablet. Microsoft&#x27;s stock price rebounded on the news.

Ballmer says that he regretted the lack of focus on Windows Mobile in the early 2000s, leaving Microsoft a distant third in the smartphone market [in 2013]. Moreover, he attributed the success of the expensively-priced iPhones to carrier subsidies. He went on to say, Ballmer called the acquisition of the mobile phone division of Nokia his &quot;toughest decision&quot; during his tenure.

Ballmer hosted his last company meeting in September 2013, and stepped down from the company&#x27;s board of directors in August 2014.

On December 24, 2014, the &quot;Seattle Times&quot; reported that the IRS sued Ballmer, Craig Mundie, Jeff Raikes, Jim Allchin, Orlando Ayala and David Guenther in an effort to compel them to testify in Microsoft&#x27;s corporate tax audit. The IRS had been looking into how Microsoft and other companies deal with transfer pricing.

In 2015, he and his wife co-founded Ballmer Group, a philanthropic investment company that aims to help children, particularly those in poor families, achieve economic mobility.

In December 2023, &quot;CNN&quot; estimated that Ballmer was set to collect $1 billion in dividends from his ongoing ownership of Microsoft stock, after the company announced an increase in its dividend to $3 per share.

==Other positions==
Ballmer was a director of Accenture and a general partner of Accenture SCA from 2001 to 2006. Details about his remuneration in these positions remain undisclosed.

==On competing companies and software==

===Apple===
In 2007, Ballmer said, &quot;There&#x27;s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance.&quot;

Speaking at a conference in NYC in 2009, Ballmer criticized Apple&#x27;s pricing, saying, &quot;Now I think the tide has turned back the other direction (against Apple). The economy is helpful. Paying an extra $500 for a computer in this environment—same piece of hardware—paying $500 more to get a logo on it? I think that&#x27;s a more challenging proposition for the average person than it used to be.&quot;

In 2015, when Apple had become the world&#x27;s most valuable company, Ballmer called Microsoft&#x27;s decision to invest in Apple to save it from bankruptcy in 1997 as the &quot;craziest thing we ever did&quot;.

In 2016, Ballmer revisited his iPhone statements, saying, &quot;People like to point to this quote...but the reason I said that was [that] the price of $600–$700 was too high&quot;. He said he did not realize that Apple was going to have phone carriers build the cost into the customer&#x27;s monthly bill.

===Free and open source software===

In July 2000, Ballmer called the free software Linux kernel &quot;communism&quot; and further claimed that it infringed with Microsoft&#x27;s intellectual property. In June 2001 he called Linux a &quot;cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches&quot;. Ballmer used the notion of &quot;viral&quot; licensing terms to express his concern over the fact that the GNU General Public License (GPL) employed by such software requires that all derivative software be under the GPL or a compatible license. In April 2003 he even interrupted his skiing holiday in Switzerland to personally plead with the mayor of Munich not to switch to Linux. But he did not succeed with this and Munich switched to LiMux, despite his offering a 35% discount at his lobbying visit.

In March 2016, Ballmer changed his stance on Linux, saying that he supports his successor Satya Nadella&#x27;s open source commitments. He maintained that his comments in 2001 were right at the time but that times have changed.

===Google===
In 2005, Microsoft sued Google for hiring one of its previous vice presidents, Kai-Fu Lee, claiming it was in violation of his one-year non-compete clause in his contract. Mark Lucovsky, who left for Google in 2004, alleged in a sworn statement to a Washington state court that Ballmer became enraged upon hearing that Lucovsky was about to leave Microsoft for Google, picked up his chair, and threw it across his office, and that, referring to then Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt (who had previously worked for competitors Sun and Novell), Ballmer vowed to &quot;kill Google.&quot; Lucovsky reports:

Ballmer then resumed attempting to persuade Lucovsky to stay at Microsoft. Ballmer has described Lucovsky&#x27;s account of the incident as a &quot;gross exaggeration of what actually took place&quot;.

During the 2011 Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco, he said: &quot;You don&#x27;t need to be a computer scientist to use a Windows Phone and you do to use an Android phone ... It is hard for me to be excited about the Android phones.&quot;

In 2013, Ballmer said that Google was a &quot;monopoly&quot; that should be pressured from market competition authorities.

==Sports==
On March 6, 2008, Seattle mayor Greg Nickels announced that a local ownership group involving Ballmer made a &quot;game-changing&quot; commitment to invest $150 million in cash toward a proposed $300 million renovation of KeyArena and were ready to purchase the Seattle SuperSonics from the Professional Basketball Club LLC in order to keep the team in Seattle. However, this initiative failed, and the SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, where they now play as the Oklahoma City Thunder.

In June 2012, Ballmer was an investor in Chris R. Hansen&#x27;s proposal to build a new arena in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle and bring the SuperSonics back to Seattle. On January 9, 2013, Ballmer and Hansen led a group of investors in an attempt to purchase the Sacramento Kings from the Maloof family and relocate them to Seattle for an estimated $650 million. However, this attempt also fell through.

Following the Donald Sterling scandal in May 2014, Ballmer was the highest bidder in an attempt to purchase the Los Angeles Clippers for a reported price of $2 billion, which was then the second-highest bid for a sports franchise in North American sports history (after the $2.15 billion sale of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012). After a California court confirmed the authority of Shelly Sterling to sell the team, it was announced on August 12, 2014, that Ballmer would become the Los Angeles Clippers owner.

On September 25, 2014, Ballmer said he would bar the team from using Apple products such as iPads, and replace them with Microsoft products. It has been reported that he had previously also barred his family from using iPhones.

In March 2020, Ballmer agreed to buy The Forum in Inglewood, California. The purchase would allow him to build Intuit Dome in the nearby area since plans for a new Clippers&#x27; arena were opposed by the former owners of The Forum.

In a survey conducted by &quot;The Athletic&quot; in December 2020, Ballmer was voted the best owner in basketball.

==Wealth and taxes==
In 2021, ProPublica documented how Ballmer is using his ownership of various sports teams as a means to lower his federal income tax to as low as 12%, compared to around 35% for the athletes playing in the team. The report exposes how the Clippers were profitable before their acquisition by Ballmer, but then reported $700 million in losses for tax purposes in following years.

In 2023, ProPublica did another report, about Ballmer&#x27;s usage of wash sales helped by Goldman Sachs, under the label &quot;Tax Advantaged Loss Harvesting&quot;, resulting in tax savings of more than half a billion dollars over 5 years

As of October 2023, &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot; estimates his personal wealth at around $115 billion, making him the fifth-richest person in the world.

On July 1, 2024, Ballmer surpassed Bill Gates to become the sixth-richest person in the world, driven by a 21% rise in Microsoft shares. Ballmer&#x27;s $157.2 billion net worth, mostly in Microsoft stock, exceeded Gates&#x27;s $156.7 billion, which is diversified and heavily donated to philanthropy.

==Philanthropy==
On November 12, 2014, it was announced that Ballmer and his wife Connie donated $50 million to the University of Oregon. Connie Ballmer is a University of Oregon alumna and previously was on the institution&#x27;s board of trustees. The funds will go toward the university&#x27;s $2 billion fundraising effort, and will focus on scholarships, public health research and advocacy, and external branding/communications. On November 13, 2014, it was announced that Ballmer would provide a gift, estimated at $60 million, to Harvard University&#x27;s computer science department. The gift would allow the department to hire new faculty, and hopefully increase the national stature of the program. Ballmer previously donated $10 million to the same department in 1994, in a joint gift with Bill Gates.

In 2022, Ballmer donated $425 million to the University of Oregon to fund a new institute for children&#x27;s behavioral health.

Ballmer is on the World Chairman&#x27;s Council of the Jewish National Fund, which means he has donated US$1 million or more to the JNF.

==USAFacts==
Ballmer launched USAFacts.org in 2017, a not-for-profit organization whose goal is to enable people to understand U.S. government revenue, spending and societal impact. He is reported to have contributed $10 million to fund teams of researchers who populated the website&#x27;s database with official data.

==Personal life==
Ballmer married philanthropist Connie Snyder in 1990, and the couple have three sons.

The Ballmers live primarily in Hunts Point, Washington. They own multiple homes in the Seattle area, and a total of 10 properties near Coupeville, Washington, as of 2024.

<text>Salamanders are a group of amphibians typically characterized by their lizard-like appearance, with slender bodies, blunt snouts, short limbs projecting at right angles to the body, and the presence of a tail in both larvae and adults. All ten extant salamander families are grouped together under the order Urodela from the group Caudata. &quot;Urodela&quot; is a scientific Latin term based on the Ancient Greek : ourà dēlē &quot;conspicuous tail&quot;. &quot;Caudata&quot; is the Latin for &quot;tailed ones&quot;, from : &quot;tail&quot;.

Salamander diversity is highest in eastern North America, especially in the Appalachian Mountains; most species are found in the Holarctic realm, with some species present in the Neotropical realm. Salamanders never have more than four toes on their front legs and five on their rear legs, but some species have fewer digits and others lack hind limbs. Their permeable skin usually makes them reliant on habitats in or near water or other cool, damp places. Some salamander species are fully aquatic throughout their lives, some take to the water intermittently, and others are entirely terrestrial as adults.

This group of amphibians is capable of regenerating lost limbs as well as other damaged parts of their bodies. Researchers hope to reverse engineer the regenerative processes for potential human medical applications, such as brain and spinal cord injury treatment or preventing harmful scarring during heart surgery recovery. The remarkable ability of salamanders to regenerate is not just limited to limbs but extends to vital organs such as the heart, jaw, and parts of the spinal cord, showing their uniqueness compared to different types of vertebrates. ⁤⁤This ability is most remarkable for occurring without any type of scarring. ⁤⁤This has made salamanders an invaluable model organism in scientific research aimed at understanding and achieving regenerative processes for medical advancements in human and animal biology.

Members of the family Salamandridae are mostly known as newts and lack the costal grooves along the sides of their bodies typical of other groups. The skin of some species contains the powerful poison tetrodotoxin; these salamanders tend to be slow-moving and have bright warning coloration to advertise their toxicity. Salamanders typically lay eggs in water and have aquatic larvae, but great variation occurs in their lifecycles. Some species in harsh environments reproduce while still in the larval state.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;salamander&quot; comes from Old French &quot;salamandre&quot; from Latin &quot;salamandra&quot; from Greek : salamándra, of uncertain, possibly, pre-Greek origin. The Greek word is used for the fire salamander.

== Description ==

The skin lacks scales and is moist and smooth to the touch, except in newts of the Salamandridae, which may have velvety or warty skin, wet to the touch. The skin may be drab or brightly colored, exhibiting various patterns of stripes, bars, spots, blotches, or dots. Male newts become dramatically colored during the breeding season. Cave species dwelling in darkness lack pigmentation and have a translucent pink or pearlescent appearance.

Salamanders range in size from the minute salamanders, with a total length of , including the tail, to the Chinese giant salamander which reaches and weighs up to . All the largest species are found in the four families giant salamanders, sirens, Congo eels and Proteidae, who are all aquatic and obligate paedomorphs. Some of the largest terrestrial salamanders, which goes through full metamorphosis, belongs to the family of Pacific giant salamanders, and are much smaller. Most salamanders are between in length.

===Trunk, limbs and tail===
An adult salamander generally resembles a small lizard, having a basal tetrapod body form with a cylindrical trunk, four limbs, and a long tail. Except in the family Salamandridae, the head, body, and tail have a number of vertical depressions in the surface which run from the mid-dorsal region to the ventral area and are known as costal grooves. Their function seems to be to help keep the skin moist by channeling water over the surface of the body.
Some aquatic species, such as sirens and amphiumas, have reduced or absent hind limbs, giving them an eel-like appearance, but in most species, the front and rear limbs are about the same length and project sideward, barely raising the trunk off the ground. The feet are broad with short digits, usually four on the front feet and five on the rear. Salamanders do not have claws, and the shape of the foot varies according to the animal&#x27;s habitat. Climbing species have elongated, square-tipped toes, while rock-dwellers have larger feet with short, blunt toes. The tree-climbing salamander (&quot;Bolitoglossa&quot; sp.) has plate-like webbed feet which adhere to smooth surfaces by suction, while the rock-climbing &quot;Hydromantes&quot; species from California have feet with fleshy webs and short digits and use their tails as an extra limb. When ascending, the tail props up the rear of the body, while one hind foot moves forward and then swings to the other side to provide support as the other hind foot advances.

In larvae and aquatic salamanders, the tail is laterally flattened, has dorsal and ventral fins, and undulates from side to side to propel the animal through the water. In the families Ambystomatidae and Salamandridae, the male&#x27;s tail, which is larger than that of the female, is used during the amplexus embrace to propel the mating couple to a secluded location. In terrestrial species, the tail moves to counterbalance the animal as it runs, while in the arboreal salamander and other tree-climbing species, it is prehensile. The tail is also used by certain plethodontid salamanders that can jump, to help launch themselves into the air. The tail is used in courtship and as a storage organ for proteins and lipids. It also functions as a defense against predation, when it may be lashed at the attacker or autotomised when grabbed. Unlike frogs, an adult salamander is able to regenerate limbs and its tail when these are lost.

===Skin===

The skin of salamanders, in common with other amphibians, is thin, permeable to water, serves as a respiratory membrane, and is well-supplied with glands. It has highly cornified outer layers, renewed periodically through a skin shedding process controlled by hormones from the pituitary and thyroid glands. During moulting, the skin initially breaks around the mouth, and the animal moves forward through the gap to shed the skin. When the front limbs have been worked clear, a series of body ripples pushes the skin toward the rear. The hind limbs are extracted and push the skin farther back, before it is eventually freed by friction as the salamander moves forward with the tail pressed against the ground. The animal often then eats the resulting sloughed skin.

Glands in the skin discharge mucus which keeps the skin moist, an important factor in skin respiration and thermoregulation. The sticky layer helps protect against bacterial infections and molds, reduces friction when swimming, and makes the animal slippery and more difficult for predators to catch. Granular glands scattered on the upper surface, particularly the head, back, and tail, produce repellent or toxic secretions. Some salamander toxins are particularly potent. The rough-skinned newt (&quot;Taricha granulosa&quot;) produces the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin, the most toxic nonprotein substance known. Handling the newts does no harm, but ingestion of even a minute fragment of skin is deadly. In feeding trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds, and mammals were all found to be susceptible.

Mature adults of some salamander species have &quot;nuptial&quot; glandular tissue in their cloacae, at the base of their tails, on their heads or under their chins. Some females release chemical substances, possibly from the ventral cloacal gland, to attract males, but males do not seem to use pheromones for this purpose. In some plethodonts, males have conspicuous mental glands on the chin which are pressed against the females&#x27; nostrils during the courtship ritual. They may function to speed up the mating process, reducing the risk of its being disrupted by a predator or rival male. The gland at the base of the tail in &quot;Plethodon cinereus&quot; is used to mark fecal pellets to proclaim territorial ownership.

===Senses===
====Smell====
Olfaction in salamanders plays a role in territory maintenance, the recognition of predators, and courtship rituals, but is probably secondary to sight during prey selection and feeding. Salamanders have two types of sensory areas that respond to the chemistry of the environment. Olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity picks up airborne and aquatic odors, while adjoining vomeronasal organs detect nonvolatile chemical cues, such as tastes in the mouth. In plethodonts, the sensory epithelium of the vomeronasal organs extends to the nasolabial grooves, which stretch from the nostrils to the corners of the mouth. These extended areas seem to be associated with the identification of prey items, the recognition of conspecifics, and the identification of individuals.

====Vision====
The eyes of most salamanders are adapted primarily for vision at night. In some permanently aquatic species, they are reduced in size and have a simplified retinal structure, and in cave dwellers such as the Georgia blind salamander, they are absent or covered with a layer of skin. In amphibious species, the eyes are a compromise and are nearsighted in air and farsighted in water. Fully terrestrial species such as the fire salamander have a flatter lens which can focus over a much wider range of distances.
To find their prey, salamanders use trichromatic color vision extending into the ultraviolet range, based on three photoreceptor types that are maximally sensitive around 450, 500, and 570 nm. The larvae, and the adults of some highly aquatic species, also have a lateral line organ, similar to that of fish, which can detect changes in water pressure.

====Hearing====
All salamanders lack middle ear cavity, eardrum and eustachian tube, but have an opercularis system like frogs, and are still able to detect airborne sound. The opercularis system consists of two ossicles: the columella (equivalent to the stapes of higher vertebrates) which is fused to the skull, and the operculum. An opercularis muscle connects the latter to the pectoral girdle, and is kept under tension when the animal is alert. The system seems able to detect low-frequency vibrations (500–600 Hz), which may be picked up from the ground by the fore limbs and transmitted to the inner ear. These may serve to warn the animal of an approaching predator.

====Vocalization====
Salamanders are usually considered to have no voice and do not use sound for communication in the way that frogs do. Before mating, they communicate by pheromone signaling; some species make quiet ticking, clicking, squeaks or popping noises, perhaps by the opening and closing of valves in the nose. Most salamanders lack vocal cords, but a larynx is present in the mudpuppy (Necturus) and some other species, and the Pacific giant salamanders and a few others have a large larynx and bands known as plicae vocales. The California giant salamander can produce a bark or rattle, and a few species can squeak by contracting muscles in the throat. The arboreal salamander can squeak using a different mechanism; it retracts its eyes into its head, forcing air out of its mouth. The ensatina salamander occasionally makes a hissing sound, while the sirens sometimes produce quiet clicks, and can resort to faint shrieks if attacked. Similar clicking behaviour was observed in two European newts &quot;Lissotriton vulgaris&quot; and &quot;Ichthyosaura alpestris&quot; in their aquatic phase. Vocalization in salamanders has been little studied and the purpose of these sounds is presumed to be the startling of predators.

===Respiration===
Respiration differs among the different species of salamanders, and can involve gills, lungs, skin, and the membranes of mouth and throat. Larval salamanders breathe primarily by means of gills, which are usually external and feathery in appearance. Water is drawn in through the mouth and flows out through the gill slits. Some neotenic species such as the mudpuppy (&quot;Necturus maculosus&quot;) retain their gills throughout their lives, but most species lose them at metamorphosis. The embryos of some terrestrial lungless salamanders, such as &quot;Ensatina&quot;, that undergo direct development, have large gills that lie close to the egg&#x27;s surface.

When present in adult salamanders, lungs vary greatly among different species in size and structure. In aquatic, cold-water species like the torrent salamanders (&quot;Rhyacotriton&quot;), the lungs are very small with smooth walls, while species living in warm water with little dissolved oxygen, such as the lesser siren (&quot;Siren intermedia&quot;), have large lungs with convoluted surfaces. In the lungless salamanders (family Plethodontidae and the clawed salamanders in the family of Asiatic salamanders), no lungs or gills are present, and gas exchange mostly takes place through the skin, known as cutaneous respiration, supplemented by the tissues lining the mouth. To facilitate this, these salamanders have a dense network of blood vessels just under the skin and in the mouth.

In the amphiumas, metamorphosis is incomplete, and they retain one pair of gill slits as adults, with fully functioning internal lungs. Some species that lack lungs respire through gills. In most cases, these are external gills, visible as tufts on either side of the head. Some terrestrial salamanders have lungs used in respiration, although these are simple and sac-like, unlike the more complex organs found in mammals. Many species, such as the olm, have both lungs and gills as adults.

In the &quot;Necturus&quot;, external gills begin to form as a means of combating hypoxia in the egg as egg yolk is converted into metabolically active tissue. Molecular changes in the mudpuppy during post-embryonic development primarily due to the thyroid gland prevent the internalization of the external gills as seen in most salamanders that undergo metamorphosis. The external gills seen in salamanders differs greatly from that of amphibians with internalized gills. Unlike amphibians with internalized gills which typically rely on the changing of pressures within the buccal and pharyngeal cavities to ensure diffusion of oxygen onto the gill curtain, neotenic salamanders such as Necturus use specified musculature, such as the levatores arcuum, to move external gills to keep the respiratory surfaces constantly in contact with new oxygenated water.

==Feeding and diet==
Salamanders are opportunistic predators. They are generally not restricted to specific foods, but feed on almost any organism of a reasonable size. Large species such as the Japanese giant salamander (&quot;Andrias japonicus&quot;) eat crabs, fish, small mammals, amphibians, and aquatic insects. In a study of smaller dusky salamanders (&quot;Desmognathus&quot;) in the Appalachian Mountains, their diet includes earthworms, flies, beetles, beetle larvae, leafhoppers, springtails, moths, spiders, grasshoppers, and mites. Cannibalism sometimes takes place, especially when resources are short or time is limited. Tiger salamander tadpoles in ephemeral pools sometimes resort to eating each other, and are seemingly able to target unrelated individuals. Adult blackbelly salamanders (&quot;Desmognathus quadramaculatus&quot;) prey on adults and young of other species of salamanders, while their larvae sometimes cannibalise smaller larvae.

Most species of salamander have small teeth in both their upper and lower jaws. Unlike frogs, even the larvae of salamanders possess these teeth. Although larval teeth are shaped like pointed cones, the teeth of adults are adapted to enable them to readily grasp prey. The crown, which has two cusps (bicuspid), is attached to a pedicel by collagenous fibers. The joint formed between the bicuspid and the pedicel is partially flexible, as it can bend inward, but not outward. When struggling prey is advanced into the salamander&#x27;s mouth, the teeth tips relax and bend in the same direction, encouraging movement toward the throat, and resisting the prey&#x27;s escape. Many salamanders have patches of teeth attached to the vomer and the palatine bones in the roof of the mouth, and these help to retain prey. All types of teeth are resorbed and replaced at intervals throughout the animal&#x27;s life.

A terrestrial salamander catches its prey by flicking out its sticky tongue in an action that takes less than half a second. In some species, the tongue is attached anteriorly to the floor of the mouth, while in others, it is mounted on a pedicel. It is rendered sticky by secretions of mucus from glands in its tip and on the roof of the mouth. High-speed cinematography shows how the tiger salamander (&quot;Ambystoma tigrinum&quot;) positions itself with its snout close to its prey. Its mouth then gapes widely, the lower jaw remains stationary, and the tongue bulges and changes shape as it shoots forward. The protruded tongue has a central depression, and the rim of this collapses inward as the target is struck, trapping the prey in a mucus-laden trough. Here it is held while the animal&#x27;s neck is flexed, the tongue retracted and jaws closed. Large or resistant prey is retained by the teeth while repeated protrusions and retractions of the tongue draw it in. Swallowing involves alternate contraction and relaxation of muscles in the throat, assisted by depression of the eyeballs into the roof of the mouth. Many lungless salamanders of the family Plethodontidae have more elaborate feeding methods. Muscles surrounding the hyoid bone contract to store elastic energy in springy connective tissue, and actually &quot;shoot&quot; the hyoid bone out of the mouth, thus elongating the tongue. Muscles that originate in the pelvic region and insert in the tongue are used to reel the tongue and the hyoid back to their original positions.

An aquatic salamander lacks muscles in the tongue, and captures its prey in an entirely different manner. It grabs the food item, grasps it with its teeth, and adopts a kind of inertial feeding. This involves tossing its head about, drawing water sharply in and out of its mouth, and snapping its jaws, all of which tend to tear and macerate the prey, which is then swallowed.

Though frequently feeding on slow-moving animals like snails, shrimps and worms, sirenids are unique among salamanders for having developed herbivory speciations, such as beak-like jaw ends and extensive intestines. They feed on algae and other soft-plants in the wild, and easily eat offered lettuce.

==Defense==

Salamanders have thin skins and soft bodies, move rather slowly and might appear vulnerable to opportunistic predation, but have several effective lines of defense. Mucus coating on damp skin makes them difficult to grasp, and the slimy coating may have an offensive taste or be toxic. When attacked by a predator, a salamander may position itself to make the main poison glands face the aggressor. Often, these are on the tail, which may be waggled or turned up and arched over the animal&#x27;s back. The sacrifice of the tail may be a worthwhile strategy, if the salamander escapes with its life and the predator learns to avoid that species of salamander in the future.

===Aposematism===

Skin secretions of the tiger salamander (&quot;Ambystoma tigrinum&quot;) fed to rats have been shown to produce aversion to the flavor, and the rats avoided the presentational medium when it was offered to them again. The fire salamander (&quot;Salamandra salamandra&quot;) has a ridge of large granular glands down its spine which are able to squirt a fine jet of toxic fluid at its attacker. By angling its body appropriately, it can accurately direct the spray for a distance of up to .

The Iberian ribbed newt (&quot;Pleurodeles waltl&quot;) has another method of deterring aggressors. Its skin exudes a poisonous, viscous fluid and at the same time, the newt rotates its sharply pointed ribs through an angle between 27 and 92°, and adopts an inflated posture. This action causes the ribs to puncture the body wall, each rib protruding through an orange wart arranged in a lateral row. This may provide an aposematic signal that makes the spines more visible. When the danger has passed, the ribs retract and the skin heals.

===Camouflage and mimicry===
Although many salamanders have cryptic colors so as to be unnoticeable, others signal their toxicity by their vivid coloring. Yellow, orange, and red are the colors generally used, often with black for greater contrast. Sometimes, the animal postures if attacked, revealing a flash of warning hue on its underside. The red eft, the brightly colored terrestrial juvenile form of the eastern newt (&quot;Notophthalmus viridescens&quot;), is highly poisonous. It is avoided by birds and snakes, and can survive for up to 30 minutes after being swallowed (later being regurgitated). The red salamander (&quot;Pseudotriton ruber&quot;) is a palatable species with a similar coloring to the red eft. Predators that previously fed on it have been shown to avoid it after encountering red efts, an example of Batesian mimicry. Other species exhibit similar mimicry. In California, the palatable yellow-eyed salamander (&quot;Ensatina eschscholtzii&quot;) closely resembles the toxic California newt (&quot;Taricha torosa&quot;) and the rough-skinned newt (&quot;Taricha granulosa&quot;), whereas in other parts of its range, it is cryptically colored. A correlation exists between the toxicity of Californian salamander species and diurnal habits: relatively harmless species like the California slender salamander (&quot;Batrachoseps attenuatus&quot;) are nocturnal and are eaten by snakes, while the California newt has many large poison glands in its skin, is diurnal, and is avoided by snakes.

===Autotomy===
Some salamander species use tail autotomy to escape predators. The tail drops off and wriggles around for a while after an attack, and the salamander either runs away or stays still enough not to be noticed while the predator is distracted. The tail regrows with time, and salamanders routinely regenerate other complex tissues, including the lens or retina of the eye. Within only a few weeks of losing a piece of a limb, a salamander perfectly reforms the missing structure.

==Distribution and habitat==

Salamanders split off from the other amphibians during the mid- to late Permian, and initially were similar to modern members of the Cryptobranchoidea. Their resemblance to lizards is the result of symplesiomorphy, their common retention of the primitive tetrapod body plan, but they are no more closely related to lizards than they are to mammals. Their nearest relatives are the frogs and toads, within Batrachia. 

The oldest known total-group (Caudata) salamander is &quot;Triassurus&quot; from the Triassic of Kyrgyzstan. Further salamander fossils are known from the Middle Jurassic of England, Scotland, China, and Kazakhstan. The oldest known crown-group salamander (Urodela) remains uncertain but recent analyses suggest it is &quot;Valdotriton&quot; from the Late Jurassic of Spain. 

Salamanders are found only in the Holarctic and Neotropical regions, not reaching south of the Mediterranean Basin, the Himalayas, or in South America the Amazon Basin. They do not extend north of the Arctic tree line, with the northernmost Asian species, &quot;Salamandrella keyserlingii&quot;, which can survive long-term freezing at −55 °C, occurring in the Siberian larch forests of Sakha and the most northerly species in North America, &quot;Ambystoma laterale&quot;, reaching no farther north than Labrador and &quot;Taricha granulosa&quot; not beyond the Alaska Panhandle. They had an exclusively Laurasian distribution until &quot;Bolitoglossa&quot; invaded South America from Central America, probably by the start of the Early Miocene, about 23 million years ago. They also lived on the Caribbean Islands during the early Miocene epoch, confirmed by the discovery of &quot;Palaeoplethodon hispaniolae&quot;, found trapped in amber in the Dominican Republic. Vertebrae fossils recovered from the Murgon fossil site have been tentatively attributed to that of a Salamander, though its true identity is disputed. If the vertebrae truly belong to a Salamander, they would represent the only Salamanders in Australia.

There are about 760 living species of salamander. One-third of the known salamander species are found in North America. The highest concentration of these is found in the Appalachian Mountains region, where the Plethodontidae are thought to have originated in mountain streams. Here, vegetation zones and proximity to water are of greater importance than altitude. Only species that adopted a more terrestrial mode of life have been able to disperse to other localities. The northern slimy salamander (&quot;Plethodon glutinosus&quot;) has a wide range and occupies a habitat similar to that of the southern gray-cheeked salamander (&quot;Plethodon metcalfi&quot;). The latter is restricted to the slightly cooler and wetter conditions in north-facing cove forests in the southern Appalachians, and to higher elevations above 900 m (3,000 ft), while the former is more adaptable, and would be perfectly able to inhabit these locations, but some unknown factor seems to prevent the two species from co-existing.

One species, the Anderson&#x27;s salamander, is one of the few species of living amphibians to occur in brackish or salt water.

==Reproduction and development==

Many salamanders do not use vocalisations, and in most species the sexes look alike, so they use olfactory and tactile cues to identify potential mates, and sexual selection occurs. Pheromones play an important part in the process and may be produced by the abdominal gland in males and by the cloacal glands and skin in both sexes. Males are sometimes to be seen investigating potential mates with their snouts. In Old World newts, &quot;Triturus&quot; spp., the males are sexually dimorphic and display in front of the females. Visual cues are also thought to be important in some &quot;Plethodont&quot; species.

Except for terrestrial species in the three families Plethodontidae, Ambystomatidae, and Salamandridae, salamanders mate in water. The mating varies from courtship between a single male and female to explosive group breeding. In the clade Salamandroidea, which makes up about 90% of all species, fertilization is internal. As a general rule, salamanders with internal fertilization have indirect sperm transfer, but in species like the Sardinian brook salamander, the Corsican brook salamander, the Caucasian salamander and the Pyrenean brook salamander, the male transfer his sperm directly into the female cloaca. For the species with indirect sperm transfer, the male deposits a spermatophore on the ground or in the water according to species, and the female picks this up with her vent. The spermatophore has a packet of sperm supported on a conical gelatinous base, and often an elaborate courtship behavior is involved in its deposition and collection. Once inside the cloaca, the spermatozoa move to the spermatheca, one or more chambers in the roof of the cloaca, where they are stored for sometimes lengthy periods until the eggs are laid. In the Asiatic salamanders, the giant salamanders and Sirenidae, which are the most primitive groups, the fertilization is external. In a reproductive process similar to that of typical frogs, the male releases sperm onto the egg mass. These salamanders also have males that exhibit parental care, which otherwise only occur in females with internal fertilization.

Three different types of egg deposition occur. &quot;Ambystoma&quot; and &quot;Taricha&quot; spp. spawn large numbers of small eggs in quiet ponds where many large predators are unlikely. Most dusky salamanders (&quot;Desmognathus&quot;) and Pacific giant salamanders (&quot;Dicamptodon&quot;) lay smaller batches of medium-sized eggs in a concealed site in flowing water, and these are usually guarded by an adult, normally the female. Many of the tropical climbing salamanders (&quot;Bolitoglossa&quot;) and lungless salamanders (Plethodontinae) lay a small number of large eggs on land in a well-hidden spot, where they are also guarded by the mother. Some species such as the fire salamanders (&quot;Salamandra&quot;) are ovoviviparous, with the female retaining the eggs inside her body until they hatch, either into larvae to be deposited in a water body, or into fully formed juveniles.

In temperate regions, reproduction is usually seasonal and salamanders may migrate to breeding grounds. Males usually arrive first and in some instances set up territories. Typically, a larval stage follows in which the organism is fully aquatic. The tadpole has three pairs of external gills, no eyelids, a long body, a laterally flattened tail with dorsal and ventral fins and in some species limb-buds or limbs. Pond-type larvae may have a pair of rod-like balancers on either side of the head, long gill filaments and broad fins. Stream-type larvae are more slender with short gill filaments—in Rhyacotriton and Onychodactylus, and some species in Batrachuperus, the gills and gill rakers are extremely reduced, narrower fins and no balancers, but instead have hind limbs already developed when they hatch. The tadpoles are carnivorous and the larval stage may last from days to years, depending on species. Sometimes this stage is completely bypassed, and the eggs of most lungless salamanders (Plethodontidae) develop directly into miniature versions of the adult without an intervening larval stage.

By the end of the larval stage, the tadpoles already have limbs and metamorphosis takes place normally. In salamanders, this occurs over a short period of time and involves the closing of the gill slits and the loss of structures such as gills and tail fins that are not required as adults. At the same time, eyelids develop, the mouth becomes wider, a tongue appears, and teeth are formed. The aqueous larva emerges onto land as a terrestrial adult.

Not all species of salamanders follow this path. Neoteny, also known as paedomorphosis, has been observed in all salamander families, and may be universally possible in all salamander species. In this state, an individual may retain gills or other juvenile features while attaining reproductive maturity. The changes that take place at metamorphosis are under the control of thyroid hormones and in obligate neotenes such as the axolotl (&quot;Ambystoma mexicanum&quot;), the tissues are seemingly unresponsive to the hormones. In other species, the changes may not be triggered because of underactivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid mechanism which may occur when conditions in the terrestrial environment are too inhospitable. This may be due to cold or wildly fluctuating temperatures, aridity, lack of food, lack of cover, or insufficient iodine for the formation of thyroid hormones. Genetics may also play a part. The larvae of tiger salamanders (&quot;Ambystoma tigrinum&quot;), for example, develop limbs soon after hatching and in seasonal pools promptly undergo metamorphosis. Other larvae, especially in permanent pools and warmer climates, may not undergo metamorphosis until fully adult in size. Other populations in colder climates may not metamorphose at all, and become sexually mature while in their larval forms. Neoteny allows the species to survive even when the terrestrial environment is too harsh for the adults to thrive on land.

==Conservation==
A general decline in living amphibian species has been linked with the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. A higher proportion of salamander species than of frogs or caecilians are in one of the at-risk categories established by the IUCN. Salamanders showed a significant diminution in numbers in the last few decades of the 20th century, although no direct link between the fungus and the population decline has yet been found. The IUCN made further efforts in 2005 as they established the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan (ACAP), which was subsequently followed by Amphibian Ark (AArk), Amphibian Specialist Group (ASG), and finally the umbrella organization known as the Amphibian Survival Alliance (ASA). Researchers also cite deforestation, resulting in fragmentation of suitable habitats, and climate change as possible contributory factors. Species such as &quot;Pseudoeurycea brunnata&quot; and &quot;Pseudoeurycea goebeli&quot; that had been abundant in the cloud forests of Guatemala and Mexico during the 1970s were found by 2009 to be rare. Few data have been gathered on population sizes over the years and, by intensive surveying of historic and suitable new locations, it has been possible to locate individuals of other species, such as &quot;Parvimolge townsendi&quot;, which had been thought to be extinct. Currently, the major lines of defense for the conservation of Salamanders includes both in situ and ex situ conservation methods. There are efforts in place for certain members of the Salamander family to be conserved under a conservation breeding program (CBP) but there should be research done ahead of time to determine if the Salamander species is actually going to value from the CBP, as researchers have noted that some species of amphibians completely fail in this environment.

Various conservation initiatives are being attempted around the world. The Chinese giant salamander, at 1.8 m (6 ft) the largest amphibian in the world, is critically endangered, as it is collected for food and for use in traditional Chinese medicine. An environmental education programme is being undertaken to encourage sustainable management of wild populations in the Qinling Mountains and captive breeding programmes have been set up. The hellbender is another large, long-lived species with dwindling numbers and fewer juveniles reaching maturity than previously. Another alarming finding is the increase in abnormalities in up to 90% of the hellbender population in the Spring River watershed in Arkansas. Habitat loss, silting of streams, pollution and disease have all been implicated in the decline and a captive breeding programme at Saint Louis Zoo has been successfully established. Of the 20 species of minute salamanders (&quot;Thorius&quot; spp.) in Mexico, half are believed to have become extinct and most of the others are critically endangered. Specific reasons for the decline may include climate change, chytridiomycosis, or volcanic activity, but the main threat is habitat destruction as logging, agricultural activities, and human settlement reduce their often tiny, fragmented ranges. Survey work is being undertaken to assess the status of these salamanders, and to better understand the factors involved in their population declines, with a view to taking action.

&quot;Ambystoma mexicanum&quot;, an aquatic salamander, is a species protected under the Mexican UMA (Unit for Management and conservation of wildlife) as of April 1994. Another detrimental factor is that the axolotl lost their role as a top predator since the introduction of locally exotic species such as Nile tilapia and carp. Tilapia and carp directly compete with axolotls by consuming their eggs, larvae, and juveniles. Climate change has also immensely affected axolotls and their populations throughout the southern Mexico area. Due to its proximity to Mexico City, officials are currently working on programs at Lake Xochimilco to bring in tourism and educate the local population on the restoration of the natural habitat of these creatures. This proximity is a large factor that has impacted the survival of the axolotl, as the city has expanded to take over the Xochimilco region in order to make use of its resources for water and provision and sewage. It is farmed for use in research facilities and so may one day return to its natural habitat. The recent decline in population has substantially impacted genetic diversity among populations, making it difficult to further progress scientifically. Some genetic indiversity due to paedeomorphism in &quot;Ambystoma&quot; species such as the axolotl does not account for the overall lack of diversity. Evidence points toward a historical bottlenecking of &quot;Ambystoma&quot; that contributes to the variation issues and no longer a large genetic pool for it to pull from, thus raising concern for inbreeding due to lack of gene flow. One way researchers are looking into maintaining genetic diversity within the population is via cryopreservation of the spermatophores from the male axolotl. It is a safe and non-invasive method that requires the collection of the spermatophores and places them into a deep freeze for preservation. Most importantly, they have found that there is only limited damage done to the spermatophores upon thawing and thus it is a viable option. As of 2013, it is a method that is being used to save not only the axolotl but also numerous other members of the salamander family.

Research is being done on the environmental cues that have to be replicated before captive animals can be persuaded to breed. Common species such as the tiger salamander and the mudpuppy are being given hormones to stimulate the production of sperm and eggs, and the role of arginine vasotocin in courtship behaviour is being investigated. Another line of research is artificial insemination, either &quot;in vitro&quot; or by inserting spermatophores into the cloacae of females. The results of this research may be used in captive-breeding programmes for endangered species.

== Taxonomy ==
The order name Urodela comes from the name Urodèles given by André Marie Constant Duméril in 1805, it is derived from the Greek words &quot;ourā́&quot; &quot;tail&quot; and &quot;dēlos&quot; &quot;visible, conspicuous&quot; because of their &quot;persistent&quot; tails.

Disagreement exists among different authorities as to the definition of the terms Caudata and Urodela. Some maintain that the Urodela should be restricted to the crown group, with the Caudata being used for the total group. Others restrict the name Caudata to the crown group and use Urodela for the total group. The former approach seems to be most widely adopted and is used in this article.

The ten families belonging to Urodela are divided into three suborders. The clade Neocaudata is often used to separate the Cryptobranchoidea and Salamandroidea from the Sirenoidea.

==Phylogeny and evolution==
The origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians (gymnophionans, urodeles and anurans) is a matter of debate. A 2005 molecular phylogeny, based on rDNA analysis, suggested that the first divergence between these three groups took place soon after they had branched from the lobe-finned fish in the Devonian (around 360 million years ago), and before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea. The briefness of this period, and the speed at which radiation took place, may help to account for the relative scarcity of amphibian fossils that appear to be closely related to lissamphibians. More recent studies generally find more recent (Late Carboniferous to Permian) age for the basalmost divergence among lissamphibians.

The earliest known salamander-line lissamphibian is &quot;Triassurus&quot; from the Middle-Late Triassic of Kyrgyzstan. Other fossil salamanders are known from the Middle-Late Jurassic of Eurasia, including &quot;Kokartus honorarius&quot; from the Middle Jurassic of Kyrgyzstan, two species of the apparently neotenic, aquatic &quot;Marmorerpeton&quot; from the Middle Jurassic of England and Scotland, and &quot;Karaurus&quot; from the Middle-Late Jurassic of Kazakhstan, resembled modern mole salamanders in morphology and probably had a similar burrowing lifestyle. They looked like robust modern salamanders but lacked a number of anatomical features that characterise all modern salamanders.

The two groups of extant salamanders are the Cryptobranchoidea (which includes Asiatic and giant salamanders) and the Salamandroidea (which includes all other living salamanders), also known as Diadectosalamandroidei. Both groups are known from the Middle-Late Jurassic of China. the former being exemplified by &quot;Chunerpeton tianyiensis&quot;, &quot;Pangerpeton sinensis&quot;, &quot;Jeholotriton paradoxus&quot;, &quot;Regalerpeton weichangensis&quot;, &quot;Liaoxitriton daohugouensis&quot; and &quot;Iridotriton hechti&quot;, and the latter by &quot;Beiyanerpeton jianpingensis&quot;. By the Upper Cretaceous, most or all of the living salamander families had probably appeared.

The following cladogram shows the relationships between salamander families based on the molecular analysis of Pyron and Wiens (2011). The position of the Sirenidae is disputed, but the position as sister to the Salamandroidea best fits with the molecular and fossil evidence.

== Genome and genetics ==
Salamanders possess gigantic genomes, spanning the range from 14 Gb to 120 Gb (the human genome is 3.2 Gb long). The genomes of &quot;Pleurodeles waltl&quot; (20 Gb) and &quot;Ambystoma mexicanum&quot; (32 Gb) have been sequenced.

Their giant genomes have strongly affected their physiology. This includes their skeletal and circulatory systems, and have led to a simplified brain, weak heart and slow metabolism. The cell mechanisms that prevents transposons to accumulate seems to be partially defect in salamanders. Some species with the largest genomes have lost the ability to go through metamorphosis. The development of the body is slower than its growth compared to their ancestors, and stops at a certain age, leaving them with embryonic traits. The salamander tissues contain cells that differentiates slowly, weakly, or not at all, due to intron delay, which gives them regenerative properties, which includes regenerating parts of the face and eye, lungs, liver, heart, and even the spinal cord and brain, and they have been described as &quot;walking bags of stem cells&quot;. Research has also shown that they do not develop typical signs of aging and do not accumulate age-related diseases like cancer.

==In human society==

===Myth and legend===

Legends have developed around the salamander over the centuries, many related to fire. This connection likely originates from the tendency of many salamanders to dwell inside rotting logs. When the log was placed into a fire, the salamander would attempt to escape, lending credence to the belief that salamanders were created from flames.

The association of the salamander with fire appeared first in Antiquity with Aristotle (&quot;History of Animals&quot; 5, 17) and with Pliny the Elder writing in his &quot;Natural History &quot; (10, 86) that &quot;A salamander is so cold that it puts out fire on contact. It vomits from its mouth a milky liquid; if this liquid touches any part of the human body, it causes all the hair to fall off, and the skin to change color and break out in a rash.&quot; The ability to put out fire is repeated by Saint Augustine in the fifth century and Isidore of Seville in the seventh century.

The mythical ruler Prester John supposedly had a robe made from alleged salamander hair, in fact asbestos fibre, already known by ancient Greece and Rome (the &quot;linum vivum&quot; of Pliny the Elder &quot;Naturalis historia&quot;, 19, 4). The &quot;Emperor of India&quot; possessed a suit made from a thousand skins; Pope Alexander III had a tunic which he valued highly and William Caxton (1481) wrote: &quot;This Salemandre berithe wulle, of which is made cloth and gyrdles that may not brenne in the fyre.&quot; The salamander was said to be so toxic that by twining around a tree, it could poison the fruit and so kill any who ate them and by falling into a well, could kill all who drank from it.

Wealthy Persians amazed guests by cleaning a cloth by exposing it to fire. For example, according to Tabari, one of the curious items belonging to Khosrow II Parviz, the great Sassanian king (r. 590–628), was a napkin () that he cleaned simply by throwing it into fire. Such cloth is believed to have been made of asbestos imported over the Hindu Kush. According to Biruni in his book &quot;Gems&quot;, any cloths made of asbestos (, &quot;āzarshost&quot;) were called &quot;shostakeh&quot; (). Some Persians believed the fiber was the fur of an animal called the &quot;samandar&quot; (), which lived in fire and died when exposed to water; this may be where the belief originated that the salamander could tolerate fire. Charlemagne, the first Holy Roman Emperor (800–814), is also said to have possessed such a tablecloth.

Marco Polo recounts having been shown, in a place he calls &quot;Ghinghin talas&quot;, &quot;a good vein from which the cloth which we call of salamander, which cannot be burnt if it is thrown into the fire, is made ...&quot;

In his autobiography, Benvenuto Cellini relates:

The Japanese giant salamander has been the subject of legend and artwork in Japan (e.g. the &quot;ukiyo-e&quot; work by Utagawa Kuniyoshi). The well-known Japanese mythological creature known as the &quot;kappa&quot; may be inspired by this salamander.

===Medical research===
Salamanders&#x27; limb regeneration has long been the focus of interest among scientists. The first extensive cell-level study was by Vincenzo Colucci in 1886. Researchers have been trying to find out the conditions required for the growth of new limbs and hope that such regeneration could be replicated in humans using stem cells. Axolotls have been used in research and have been genetically engineered so that a fluorescent protein is present in cells in the leg, enabling the cell division process to be tracked under the microscope. It seems that after the loss of a limb, cells draw together to form a clump known as a blastema. This superficially appears undifferentiated, but cells that originated in the skin later develop into new skin, muscle cells into new muscle and cartilage cells into new cartilage. It is only the cells from just beneath the surface of the skin that are pluripotent and able to develop into any type of cell. Researchers from the Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute have found that when macrophages were removed, salamanders lost their ability to regenerate and instead formed scar tissue. If the processes involved in forming new tissue can be reverse engineered into humans, it may be possible to heal injuries of the spinal cord or brain, repair damaged organs and reduce scarring and fibrosis after surgery.

The spotted salamander (Amblystoma maculatum) lives in a symbiotic relationship with a green algae known as Oophila amblystomatis. The algal cells make their way into tissue cells throughout the embryo&#x27;s body and appears to avoid rejection by activating genes which suppress the embryo&#x27;s immune response. A mechanism that could be used in treatment for autoimmune diseases in humans.

===Brandy===
A 1995 article in the Slovenian weekly magazine &quot;Mladina&quot; publicized salamander brandy, a liquor supposedly indigenous to Slovenia. It was said to combine hallucinogenic with aphrodisiac effects and is made by putting several live salamanders in a barrel of fermenting fruit. Stimulated by the alcohol, they secrete toxic mucus in defense and eventually die. Besides causing hallucinations, the neurotoxins present in the brew were said to cause extreme sexual arousal.

Later research by Slovenian anthropologist Miha Kozorog (University of Ljubljana) paints a very different picture—Salamander in brandy appears to have been traditionally seen as an adulterant, one which caused ill health. It was also used as a term of slander.
