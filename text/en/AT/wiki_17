<text>East Bank is a town in Kanawha County, West Virginia, United States, situated along the Kanawha River. The population was 820 at the 2020 census. East Bank was incorporated in 1889 by special charter enacted by the West Virginia Legislature. It is so named on account of the town&#x27;s location on the east side of the Kanawha River.

East Bank was the site of Cabin Creek District High School, erected in 1912. The first commencement ceremony graduated a class of three. CCDHS was eventually renamed East Bank High School, home of the Pioneers. The school colors were blue &amp; white. A notable graduate was Hercules Renda, who played football at the University of Michigan and had a long career as a high school coach. EBHS also became known for alumnus Jerry West (nicknamed &quot;Zeke from Cabin Creek&quot;), who played basketball there, leading the Pioneers to a state championship in 1956. West went on to play at West Virginia University and for the Los Angeles Lakers. From 1912 until 1969, the school was located on WV Rt. 61 at Walnut Street.

In 1969, a new building was opened along the bank of the Kanawha River, at Brannen Street. The old building continued to stand and served until 1999 as East Bank Junior High School. East Bank High School was consolidated with nearby DuPont High School in 1999 to form Riverside High School at Diamond. Around this same time, Kanawha County Schools converted from the grade 7-9 junior high system to the grade 6-8 middle school system, and the 1969 building now houses East Bank Middle School. 
The original 1912 building was demolished in 2003, but the lintel from the building&#x27;s main entryway has been preserved. East Bank&#x27;s town hall now occupies a separate building, which originally housed the high school &amp; junior high&#x27;s music and art classrooms. A Dollar General store occupies an adjacent portion of the property.

Pioneer Park, administered by Kanawha County Parks and Recreation, is adjacent to East Bank Middle School, and offers an outdoor swimming pool, miniature golf, a snack bar, and picnic shelters.

The John Harriman House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

<text>Glasgow is a town in Kanawha County, West Virginia, United States, situated along the Kanawha River. The population was 708 at the 2020 census. Glasgow was incorporated on June 20, 1920. Folk etymology derives its name from a combination of the word &quot;glass&quot; with the word &quot;company&quot; for a glass factory that was built there many years ago, but the presence of many Scottish immigrants to this part of Appalachia, particularly from the Strathclyde region, indicates that the town was most likely named after the Scottish city of Glasgow in Strathclyde.

The aim was an attempt to free striking miners who had been arrested after the governor declared martial law. This confrontation between armed miners’ and the coal companies&#x27; army constituted the largest pitched battle in the history of the labor movement in the United States and became the largest insurrection on U.S. soil since the American Civil War. The battle only ended after President Harding called in the army to suppress the uprising. Once the military intervened, the miners laid down their weapons and the fighting ended.

<text>Sissonville is a census-designated place (CDP) in Kanawha County, West Virginia, United States, along the Pocatalico River. The population was 4,028 at the 2010 census. Sissonville is located within 14 miles of Charleston, the state capital.

==History==
Sissonville is located in Kanawha County, West Virginia. It was named after an early settler by the name of John Sisson. History shows the first known settler north of Fort Lee (now known as Charleston) was a man named Johnson who built a log cabin near the mouth of Tuppers Creek in 1802 and later built a grist mill in the area. The community was named for John Sisson, who owned the original townsite.

The Sissonville area also includes the areas known as Cicerone, Pocatalico, Millertown, and Guthrie. There are numerous other smaller communities within these including Kanawha Two Mile, Derrick&#x27;s Creek, Second Creek, Allen&#x27;s Fork, and Kelly&#x27;s Creek. The community runs from the city limits of Charleston on the southern end, North to the Jackson County line, East to Roane County, and West to Putnam County. The area covered by the Sissonville Volunteer Fire Department is just over 125 square miles. The fire department was founded in May 1961.

The Sissonville community has an extensive history of experiencing problems with flooding. The community suffered three National Disaster floods in 1998, 1999, and 2000. The flooding in 2000 claimed three lives when a boat belonging to the Charleston Fire Department capsized during a rescue attempt in the 2900 Block of Sissonville Drive. The history of flooding in the area was the impetus for the closing of Bonham Elementary School located along Kanawha Two Mile.

In October 2001, the Katie Sierra free speech case made national news when a Sissonville High School student was reportedly suspended for her activism in opposition to the bombing of Afghanistan. She was actually suspended for distributing flyers for a club against school policy without prior authorization.

== History ==
The town of Rome was founded at the junction of the Little and Big Coal rivers in the 1890s by the Childress family. Soon the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway built a line along the Coal River to transport coal from the coal fields in Boone and Logan counties into the hub in nearby town of St. Albans. The town grew and a town council was formed. The town officially changed its name to &quot;Alum Creek&quot; in 1910. A constable policed the town, although without a vehicle he relied on the generosity of locals to transport him from place to place. In 1922 a set of bridges were constructed across the Big and Little Coal rivers. It was also at approximately this time Union Carbide built Cliffside, a summer camp on the banks of the Coal River. The town flourished for the next half century with most of its residents working in either the mining industries or in chemicals. Two elementary schools were founded in the town, Alum Creek Elementary on the Kanawha County side and Midway Elementary on the Lincoln County side. A high school was also built in the 1930s, named Washington District High School, after the tax district. WDHS was closed in 1980 due to school consolidation. In the mid-1980s U.S. Route 119 was constructed through Alum Creek and brought a host of businesses into Alum Creek; however, this did not help the town out of poverty due to a decline in the coal mining and chemical industries. The town is seeing a comeback due to the expansion of business along Rt 119. Median income is on the rise, and the town has grown to encompass an area of over .

==History==
Harts (town), situated at the mouth of Big Harts Creek, is named for Stephen Hart (Heart), an early settler who once lived in the area, or his father, the latter killed by Native Americans in the vicinity. Richard Elkins was the first permanent settler, arriving in 1807 or 1815. At the time of Elkins&#x27; settlement, depending on which year is accurate, the present-day town was part of Kanawha County or Cabell County. Prominent early families who settled in the present-day town of Harts included the Elkins, Adkins, and Toney families. After 1824, the area became a part of Logan County. Prior to the Civil War, Isaac Adkins (who lived at the present-day site of the Harts Fire Department) operated a large farm at &quot;Harts Bottom.&quot; He was one of the area&#x27;s most prominent landowners; Isaac Adkins Shoals are named for him. In the 1840s, James Toney, a native of present-day Boone County, acquired land from the Elkins settlers at the mouth of Big Harts Creek, just across the Guyandotte from Harts Bottom. During the Civil War, nearly all local men served in the Confederate States Army.

In 1869, the area became part of Lincoln County. In November or December 1870, Henry S. Godby established Hearts Creek Post Office. The Hearts Creek PO was discontinued in 1872. In 1877, merchant William T. &quot;Bill&quot; Fowler established Hart&#x27;s Creek Post Office. This post office was discontinued in 1880. In 1881, Andrew D. Robinson established the Hart Post Office. During the 1880s, the Lincoln County Feud occurred in Harts and garnered headlines in newspapers across the United States. During the 1890s, Al and Hollena Brumfield were the most prominent residents. In 1904, the C&amp;O Railroad passed through town. In 1910, Hart PO was discontinued. In 1916, Lewis Dempsey established Harts Post Office, which continues today. Prominent merchants during this time and in subsequent decades included F.E. Adkins, Herb Adkins, P.B. &quot;Fed&quot; Adkins, Hollena Brumfield, Fisher B. Adkins, Watson Adkins, and L.T. Jones.

The Harts Creek community includes the Harts Creek District of Lincoln County and a portion of Chapmanville District in Logan County. It includes the following communities, many of which once had post offices which are now closed: Atenville, Bulwark, Enzelo, Ferrellsburg, Fourteen, Fry, Gill, Green Shoal, Halcyon, Harts, Leet, Rector, Sand Creek, Shively, Spottswood, Toney, Warren, and Whirlwind. The larger community includes the following watersheds: Big Harts Creek (Lincoln and Logan counties), Big Ugly Creek, Fourteen Mile Creek, a portion of Kiahs Creek, Little Harts Creek, Little Ugly Creek, Sand Creek, Dry Branch, Browns Branch, Swift Shoals Branch, Walker Branch, Fowler Branch, Douglas Branch, Green Shoal Creek, and Abbotts Branch. These various locations were populated by numerous families prior to 1840: Brumfield, Elkins, Gore, Adkins, Fry, Brown, Lucas, Spurlock, Toney, Vance, Workman, Conley, Rowe, Adams, Browning, Collins, Dingess, Dolen, Heart, Johnson, Lambert, Lilly, Perry, Tomblin, Hensley, Butcher, White, Mullins, Dalton, Thompson, Dempsey, Abbott, Blankenship, Butcher, Estep, Farley, Ferrell, Nester, Richards, Spears, Dial, Carter, and Farmer. Most early settlers were of English origin.

===Captain Farley&#x27;s Raid===
Captain Henry Farley, a veteran of the Revolutionary War and resident of Montgomery County, Virginia, was the first known Anglo visitor to present-day Chapmanville. In June 1792, Captain Farley passed through the area while pursuing a Native American war party that had raided Virginia settlements at Bluestone River. By the time he reached what is today Chapmanville, he and his group had already engaged the retreating natives in the headwaters of Coal River and in the Guyandotte River valley some two miles below what is today Logan. Farley pursued the natives to the mouth of the Guyandotte River before returning home.

===Pioneer Settlers===
Chapmanville was settled by the Chapman and Ferrell families. The following families were also important in its early history: Butcher, Conley, Dingess, Godby, and Stollings.

===Civil War===
During the American Civil War, Chapmanville residents overwhelmingly supported the Confederacy. The Battle of Kanawha Gap occurred at Chapmanville on September 25, 1861. A highway historical marker commemorates the battle. An irregular pro-Confederate unit called the Black-Striped Company operated in the vicinity throughout the war. A legend persists that a Union payroll of gold coins is buried on the west side of the river in Chapmanville.

<text>Logan is a city in Logan County, West Virginia, United States, along the Guyandotte River. The population was 1,438 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Logan County.

==History==
What is now Logan was initially called &quot;Islands of the Guyandot&quot; by explorers who identified the site in the 1780s. In 1827, a town was laid out at the site to serve as a county seat for Logan County, which had been established in 1824. The city was initially known as &quot;Lawsonsville&quot; after Anthony Lawson, an early merchant, but was shortened to &quot;Lawnsville.&quot; In the early 1850s, Thomas Dunn English, a poet and future congressman, led efforts to reorganize the town. When the town incorporated in 1853, it was renamed &quot;Aracoma&quot; after the Shawnee chief Cornstalk&#x27;s daughter, who had been killed by settlers in the area in 1780. The city was renamed &quot;Logan&quot; in 1907 after the Mingo leader, Chief Logan.

Logan grew continuously during the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a hub of the regional coal industry. At its height in 1940, the city had a population of over 5,000, and was home to numerous businesses, including furniture stores, hotels, banks, and car dealerships. Logan began to decline following World War II, due in large part to the increased mechanization of the coal industry.

The Chafin House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Logan was home to the Logan Indians, a minor league baseball team, from 1937 to 1942.

==Geography==
Logan is located at the confluence of the Guyandotte River and Island Creek.

<text>Fairmont is a city in and the county seat of Marion County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 18,313 at the 2020 census, making it the eighth-most populous city in the state. It is the principal city of the Fairmont micropolitan area, which includes all of Marion County in North Central West Virginia and had a population of 56,205 in 2020. Fairmont is also a principal city of the larger Morgantown–Fairmont combined statistical area.

==History==
=== Early settlements ===
In the eighteenth century, the earliest development of Fairmont consisted of subsistence farming settlements.

In 1789, Boaz Fleming, a Revolutionary War veteran, migrated to western Virginia and purchased a 254-acre farm from Jonathan Bozarth. In 1808, Fleming made his annual trek to Clarksburg to pay his brother&#x27;s Harrison County taxes. While in Clarksburg, Fleming attended a social gathering that included his cousin Dolley Madison, wife of President James Madison. Fleming complained to Mrs. Madison about having to travel over a hundred miles each year from his home to pay his Monongalia County taxes and his brother&#x27;s Harrison County taxes. Mrs. Madison supposedly suggested that he create his own county to save him all that travel. In 1814, Fleming circulated a petition to do precisely that, naming the proposed county Madison County in honor of Dolley and James Madison.

Milford, now Rivesville, was the only town within the borders of Fleming&#x27;s proposed county, so Fleming decided to make Milford the seat of Madison County. However, Milford&#x27;s citizens preferred to remain part of Monongalia County. As a result, Fleming&#x27;s petition failed to gain sufficient support to be presented to the Virginia General Assembly. Fleming then focused on creating a new town near his farm, which was located on the west side of the Monongahela River. In 1817, Fleming&#x27;s sons—William and David—began to clear land on a part of their father&#x27;s farm to make way for the new town; this part of the farm would later become downtown Fairmont.

=== Modern history ===

In 1819, Fairmont was founded as Middletown, Virginia. It was named Middletown because either it was in the middle of two cities, Morgantown and Clarksburg, or Fleming&#x27;s first wife, Elizabeth Hutchinson, was originally from Middletown, Delaware. That same year, a road was built between those two cities. Fleming&#x27;s new town was about halfway between the two cities, which made it a resting point. The town was incorporated as Middletown on January 19, 1820.

The current borders of Marion County were established in 1842, and Middletown was named the county&#x27;s seat. At that time, William Haymond Jr. suggested that the town&#x27;s name be changed to Fairmont because the town had a beautiful overlook of the Monongahela River, giving it a &quot;fair mount&quot;. The Borough of Fairmont was incorporated in 1843 by the Virginia General Assembly.

In 1863, during the American Civil War, Confederate General William E. Jones and his men raided Fairmont and cut the Union&#x27;s supply lines to take food and horses. They also burned the books from the personal library of Governor Francis Harrison Pierpont.

Many of the first buildings in Fairmont were poorly constructed. By 1852—little more than 30 years after the city&#x27;s founding—a large portion of Fairmont was reported to be run-down and dilapidated. Reports from 1873 indicate that these buildings had continued to fall into disrepair. On April 2, 1876, a fire destroyed a large portion of the city&#x27;s business district, as well as many houses in the area. The continuing dilapidation of the city&#x27;s buildings may have contributed to the fire; the large number of coal mines under Fairmont may have also played a role.
Between 1891 and 1901—in a span of only 10 years—Fairmont&#x27;s population had increased from 1,000 to 7,000. The City of Fairmont was chartered in 1899; as a result of the charter, the city absorbed the surrounding towns of Palatine (also known as East Side) and West Fairmont. By 1901, Fairmont was an important commercial center. Many railroads—including the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad on its way from Cumberland, Maryland to Wheeling—traveled through the city. By this time, Fairmont was also the leading center of the coal trade industry in northern West Virginia, employing some 10,000 workers in the coal mines around Fairmont.

By 1978, an issue with Fairmont&#x27;s land experiencing subsidence appeared because the remains of Fairmont&#x27;s 19th-century coal mines were crumbling. As a result, over the following years, the federal government along with other institutions spent money to fix the subsidence issue to prevent damage to the town.

==Geography==

The Tygart Valley River and the West Fork River join in Fairmont to form the Monongahela River. Buffalo Creek, a tributary of the Monongahela River, flows through the northern part of the city.

===Climate===

However, it is not uncommon during winter for warm air from the Gulf of Mexico to raise temperatures above , which occurs on average six times each January and over eight in December and February. In contrast, when very cold air from Canada moves into West Virginia temperatures can go below , which can be expected during 3.2 mornings each winter, but which occurred on twelve mornings during the extremely cold January 1977, whose average temperature of was the coldest month on record by . Despite the abundant precipitation throughout the year, the relative dryness of cold air means that most precipitation is rain even during the winter: the most snowfall in a month being is November 1950, and the most in a season between July 1950 and June 1951. The least snow in a season has been between July 1918 and June 1919, whilst the wettest calendar year has been 1956 with and the driest – as with all of West Virginia – 1930 with . The hottest temperature has been on August 8, 1918, and the coldest on January 21, 1994.

<text>Farmington is a town in Marion County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 389 at the 2020 census. The small town is situated on Buffalo Creek and the Allegheny Mountains about 6 miles west of Fairmont, Marion County&#x27;s county seat. It is best known for being the site of the 1968 Farmington Mine disaster.

==History==
The community was named for the fact a large share of the first settlers were farmers. The area was first settled by James Goodin in the late 1700s, by Nicholas Wood and family, and by Jacob Straight and family in the 1770s. A later settler, Joseph Morgan, would build a mill here in 1801. The area would later be incorporated in Marion County as the town of Farmington in 1896, but was earlier known as Willeyvile, Willeytown, and Underwood. While it was officially named Farmington in 1896, when the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ran through the town its stations there went under the name Underwood because of there being many towns of the same name. The town was close to mine Number 08 of Jamison Coal and Coke Company. The mine exploded in 1926 and was sealed in the 1940s. The town is also close to mine Number 09 of Consolidated Coal Company, which is the site of the 1968 Farmington Mine disaster that killed 78 people. The mine had previously exploded in 1954 and was eventually sealed in 1978.

==Education==
For public education, the town is part of Marion County Schools, which covers all of Marion County. Preschool through grade three attend Fairview Elementary School and grades four through eight attend Fairview Middle School, both in nearby Fairview, while students in grades nine through twelve attend North Marion High School, which is located approximately east of Farmington on US Route 250 and has a Farmington mailing address. Adjacent to North Marion High School is the Marion County Technical Center, which houses vocational and career tech programs available to high school students from the entire district. 

Prior to 1975, Farmington had its own high school, Farmington High School. Athletic teams were known as the Farmers. It was closed due to structural issues caused by mine subsidence, which affected several other properties in town during the 1970s. North Marion opened four years later as a consolidation of the remaining surrounding high schools.

==Geography==
Farmington is located at (39.512979, -80.252060), along Buffalo Creek.

<text>Grant Town is a town in Marion County, West Virginia, in the eastern United States. The population was 690 at the 2020 census.

The town was formed in 1901 with the opening of the Federal Coal and Coke Company bituminous coal mine, and was named for Robert Grant, vice president of the coal company. The &quot;Federal No. 1&quot; mine remained open for the next 84 years until its closure in 1985. At one point it was the largest underground coal mine in the world in terms of gross production, mining the Pittsburgh coal seam. The town was incorporated as a municipality in 1946.

Grant Town is the site of an 80 Megawatt electrical generation facility, located adjacent to the coal refuse areas above the town. The plant, which was built in the early 1990s is controlled by Edison International and generates electricity using a fluidized bed combustion boiler process burning waste coal.

Grant Town is the location of a number of the stories of the West Virginia ghost story anthology &quot;The Telltale Lilac Bush,&quot; by Fairmont State University professor Ruth Ann Musick. The town, the mine and surrounding farms are prominently featured in a number of the stories. Musick includes a description of the town, circa 1965, in an introduction to a section on mine ghost stories: &quot;The Grant Town Mine, the scene of four of the stories here, is one of the largest in the United States, and possibly in the world. The town itself, with a population of a little over a thousand, is about seven miles northwest of Fairmont. Surrounded by hills, it is a kind of a sunken garden--a well at the bottom of the stairway of hills and highways--so that it seems to be in a world of its own. In a way, perhaps, it is. At least fourteen different European nationalities live in the town and work in the mine.&quot; 

==Notable people==

Notable Grant Town natives include Charles Csuri, a pioneer in the field of computer art, current West Virginia University head football coach Rich Rodriguez, and Tom Wilson, creator of the comic strip &quot;Ziggy&quot;.

==Geography==

<doc id="138480" wikidata="Q1686753" url="?curid=138480" title="Mannington, West Virginia">
<text>Mannington is a city in Marion County, West Virginia, United States, located in the hills of North Central West Virginia. The population was 1,961 at the 2020 census. In its earliest years it was called Forks of Buffalo or Koon Town, but has been called Mannington since 1856.

==History==
===Early history===
At the time of the first settlement, the west fork of Buffalo Creek was known as Warrior&#x27;s Fork, while the North Fork has historically borne the name of Pyle&#x27;s Fork. One of the first settlers in the area was John Ice, who was born in the valley of the South Branch of the Potomac River in what was then Virginia. As a child, Ice and his father searched in vain for his mother, two sisters and brother who had been captured by Native Americans. The mother was never found, although the children ultimately were. Only John&#x27;s brother, known from then on as &quot;Indian Billy&quot; returned to the family. The sisters chose to remain with their one time captors (Prichard 1983).

Native American activity was not uncommon in the area and many settlers and travelers met their fate at the hands of the Native Americans, including John Madison, the cousin of James Madison the future president, who was killed on a surveying trip in the area in 1783. Although not necessarily as a result of this, James Madison did procure, as an investment, some land on Brush Run and Pyles Fork just north of Forks of Buffalo.

The earliest population concentration did not occur in what is now Mannington, but rather approximately two miles west of Dent&#x27;s Run. Most of the land now falling within the city limits, some , was owned by Robert Rutherford, a Revolutionary War financier and an intimate friend of George Washington. In 1799, Rutherford sold his Forks of Buffalo holdings to James Brown of Berkeley County, Virginia, who, after experiencing financial setbacks, eventually sold the property at public sale in 1824 to a group of Baltimore, Maryland, investors which included William Baker. Baker apparently bought out his partners and, in turn, sold the parcel to James Hanway, a surveyor living in Monongalia County, who parceled the land and began selling it. This final transaction occurred in 1840 and it was then that the area now known as Mannington had its genesis.

After the parceling of the land around the Forks of Buffalo, interest in the area increased as did the population. A number of log houses began to be built, with the accompanying entrepreneurial activities that one might expect in an early settlement. By 1850 a tavern owned by George and Samuel Koon appeared in the heart of the burgeoning town. Not long after the tavern was opened, the Forks of Buffalo began to be known as Koon Town. While the local inhabitants may have used the newer name, the United States government failed to do so, in 1850 naming their first postal office in the community the Forks of Buffalo Post Office. It was not until 1856 that the village officially became known as Mannington, named after Charles Manning, a civil engineer with the Baltimore and Ohio (B&amp;O) Railroad. Manning was well liked by the community and the inhabitants were eager to have a more &quot;dignified&quot; name for a growing town on the new railroad line.

The coming of the railroad heralded the introduction of heavier industry in the Mannington area. Logging and coal were two of the obvious industries which were developed along the railroad line, but there were a great many peripheral industries which appeared as well. Tree bark was used by the tanneries, which, in turn, produced a wide range of leather goods. New planing mills, sawmills, and woodworking plants were started, and the availability of transportation also witnessed an increase in cattle, sheep and crop production.

During the American Civil War, the B&amp;O railroad, of vital interest to both of the conflicting sides, sustained more damage than Mannington proper did. While Confederate forces succeeded in burning several of the railroad bridges at the very beginning of the conflict, reinforcements from the Union insured the integrity of the Mannington section of the line for the remainder of the war.

===Oil and gas boom===
A new chapter in Mannington&#x27;s history began in 1889 with the first oil drilling, following recommendations made by Dr. Israel C. White, a well-known geologist who later became West Virginia State Geologist. Although many felt that the area was unfavorable for oil reserves, White persisted and soon gained enough local support to drill. Following the first strike, late in 1889, real estate prices soared 100% in two days in a boom-town mentality. The Mannington field became one of the largest in the state, with the largest well producing about .

Dr. White also pushed for natural gas exploration. It was this venture, more successful than any before or since, that was most responsible for Mannington&#x27;s growth. The population increased from approximately 700 people in the late 19th century to over 4,000 by 1917. By 1900, Mannington was a thriving town, complete with its own trolley system, electricity, theaters, schools, fire department, telephones and other amenities. The Mannington School Building, constructed in 1902–1903, was the pride of both the town and the state. In 1923, Albert Heck began the formation of the first community radio cable system from Mannington to its outlying areas.

===Boom to bust===
The 1929 stock market crash and the Depression severely affected Mannington&#x27;s economy. The trolley ceased operation in 1933, factory workers left as demand for products decreased, and the town&#x27;s population began to decline.

==Geography==
Mannington is located at (39.527340, -80.339742), along Buffalo Creek.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Mannington has a Humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==In popular culture==
Mannington is the model for the fictional town of Grantville in Eric Flint&#x27;s best selling &quot;1632&quot; series of alternate history novels: &quot;1632&quot;, &quot;1633&quot;, &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, &quot;The Grantville Gazette&quot;, and other book-length and shorter works. The &quot;1632 series&quot; has evolved into a large-scale experiment in collaborative fiction and has attracted considerable interest from other best selling writers, including David Weber and Mercedes Lackey. The premise of the series is that, in about April 2000, irresponsible aliens (accidentally) exchanged a sphere with a radius of about centered on Grantville with an equally sized chunk of Thuringia from 1631, plunging the town into the midst of the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

Mannington continues to be used as a detailed model for the series in order to determine realistically what resources and skill sets the town of Grantville would bring to the past. Flint has stated, &quot;The town of Grantville is very closely modeled on the actual town of Mannington. There are rules that I require everyone to follow when they write in the series. One of them is that it if it wasn’t in the town of Mannington in 2000, you can’t have it in Grantville. The one cheat I had to do was that I needed a power plant. The power plant is about 15 miles away, in a town called Granttown, so I just sorta moved it over. That’s the only real cheat.” The fans and writers of the 1632 series have held at least four conventions in Mannington. The fourth was held on August 4–6, 2006.

<doc id="138481" wikidata="Q2731020" url="?curid=138481" title="Monongah, West Virginia">
<text>Monongah is a town in Marion County, West Virginia, United States, situated where Booths Creek flows into the West Fork River. The population was 972 at the 2020 census. Monongah was chartered in 1891. Its name is derived from the nearby Monongahela River.

==History==
The Adena and Hopewell peoples dwelt in what is now northern West Virginia 1,500–2,000+ years ago. By the time of the early European traders and settlers, the native population is thought to have been nil, decimated by the Beaver Wars.

Monongah was known as Briar Town and was part of the Grant Magisterial District in 1886.

It was later known as Camdensburg, named after Johnson N. Camden, United States Senator from West Virginia (1881–1887). The Protestant Episcopal Church at Camdensburg described Camdensburg in 1889 as &quot;a new mining and coking town which promises to be a place of some importance in a few years.&quot;

Monongah was chartered in 1891 under Chapter 47 of West Virginia code, Of Cities, Towns, and Villages, Incorporation of Without Special Charter; Amending Charter Where Population Less Than Two Thousand.

===Monongah mining disaster===

Monongah suffered the loss of all 358 miners underground and an engineer on the surface when Fairmont Coal Company Mines No 6 and No 8 exploded at 10:30 am on December 6, 1907. The dead consisted of 171 Italians, 85 Americans, 52 Hungarians, 31 Russians, 15 Austrians, and 5 Turks. Three more people died in the aftermath, yielding a total of 361 victims. This mining accident left approximately 250 widows and 500 fatherless children.

Mayor W.H. Moore, along with D.F. Morris, William Gaskins, and John Boydoh served on the Monongah Relief Committee, formed soon after to help manage the aid effort. Mayor Moore headed the Monongah Mines Relief Committee after Monongah and Fairmont decided to merge their committees into a joint effort.

Memorials were erected in the center of town to recognize the centennial of the mining disaster on December 7, 2007. One memorial, titled &quot;Monongah Heroine&quot;, consists of a statue of a mother holding a baby with a young child beside her. It is dedicated to the widows and mothers of the miners who died. The inspiration for the statue is reported to have come from Catarina Davia, a woman widowed by the disaster. Feeling betrayed by the coal company for lack of compensation after her husband&#x27;s death she vowed to make the 1.3 mile trek from her home to the mine to steal a satchel of coal every day until she died. She didn&#x27;t only do this once every day but she did it twice. Her house was still standing until an accidental fire burned the house down on September 10, 2010. A second memorial, consisting of an engraved metal bell and plaque, was placed by the Italians to recognize the many victims from Molise in southern Italy.

Father Everett Francis Briggs, a Roman Catholic missionary of the Maryknoll order, oversaw the memorial project and died just a few days after its completion. On February 21, 2002, the West Virginia Legislature (House Concurrent Resolution no. 40) resolved &quot;to name the bridge which traverses the West Fork River in Marion County, located .12 miles west of county route 27/2, the &quot;Father Everett Francis Briggs Bridge&quot;&quot;, in honor of Briggs&#x27; dedication to the forgotten victims of the 1907 tragedy and the mine widows.

==Geography==
Monongah is located at (39.4625, −80.2183).

For such a small community, Monongah consists of many villages or named neighborhoods. These include East Monongah, Brookdale, Traction Park, Thoburn, Tower Hill and West Monongah. Prior to being incorporated and named &quot;Monongah,&quot; the town was called &quot;Briartown.&quot; It is often considered to be the unofficial capital of small coal mining towns.

Not only does the West Fork (of the Monongahela River) run through the middle of Monongah but Booths Creek (named for Continental Army James Booth, who was killed by Native Americans in 1778) joins the West Fork in Monongah.

<text>Richard St John Francis Harris (1 October 1930 – 25 October 2002) was an Irish actor and singer. Having studied at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, he rose to prominence as an icon of the British New Wave. He received numerous accolades including the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor, and a Grammy Award. In 2020, he was listed at number 3 on &quot;The Irish Times&quot;″s list of Ireland&#x27;s greatest film actors.

Harris received two Academy Award for Best Actor nominations for his performances in &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; (1963), and &quot;The Field&quot; (1990). Other notable roles include in &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961), &quot;Red Desert&quot; (1964), &quot;A Man Called Horse&quot; (1970), &quot;Cromwell&quot; (1970), &quot;Unforgiven&quot; (1992), &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000), and &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (2002). He gained cross-generational acclaim for his role as Albus Dumbledore in the first two &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films: &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001) and &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (2002), the latter of which was his final film role.

He portrayed King Arthur in the 1967 film &quot;Camelot&quot; based on the Lerner and Loewe musical of the same name. For his performance, he received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. He reprised the role in the 1981 Broadway musical revival. He received a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor nomination for his role in Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV&quot; (1991).

Harris received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie nomination for his role in &quot;The Snow Goose&quot; (1971). Harris had a number-one singing hit in Australia, Jamaica and Canada, and a top-ten hit in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the United States with his 1968 recording of Jimmy Webb&#x27;s song &quot;MacArthur Park&quot;. He received a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance nomination for the song.

== Early life ==
Harris was born on 1 October 1930, at Overdale, 8 Landsdown Villas, Ennis Road, Limerick, and was the fifth in a family of eight children, (six boys and two girls), to flour merchant Ivan Harris and Mildred (née Harty). Overdale was &quot;a tall, elegant, early 19th-century redbrick&quot; house with nine bedrooms, in a wealthy part of Limerick, the houses &quot;built at the turn of the 20th century for Limerick&#x27;s burgeoning middle class... people who could afford properly grand drawing rooms, a bedroom each for the children and one for the pot, plus space for a few servants&quot;. He was educated by the Jesuits at Crescent College. A talented rugby union player, he appeared on several Munster Junior and Senior Cup teams for Crescent, and played for Garryowen. Harris&#x27;s athletic career was cut short when he caught tuberculosis in his teens. He remained an ardent fan of the Munster Rugby and Young Munster teams until his death, attending many of their matches, and there are numerous stories of japes at rugby matches with actors and fellow rugby fans Peter O&#x27;Toole and Richard Burton.

After recovering from tuberculosis, Harris moved to England, wanting to become a director. He could not find any suitable training courses, and enrolled in the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art to learn acting. He had failed an audition at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and had been rejected by the Central School of Speech and Drama, because they felt he was too old at 24. While still a student, he rented the tiny &quot;off-West End&quot; Irving Theatre, and there directed his production of Clifford Odets&#x27;s play &quot;Winter Journey (The Country Girl)&quot;.

After completing his studies at the academy, he joined Joan Littlewood&#x27;s Theatre Workshop. He began getting roles in West End theatre productions, starting with &quot;The Quare Fellow&quot; in 1956, a transfer from the Theatre Workshop. He spent nearly a decade in obscurity, learning his profession on stages throughout the UK.

== Career ==
=== 1959–1963: Early roles and breakthrough ===
Harris made his film debut in 1959 in the film &quot;Alive and Kicking&quot;, and played the lead role in &quot;The Ginger Man&quot; in the West End in 1959. In his second film, he had a small role as an IRA Volunteer in &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot; (1959), supporting James Cagney. The film was shot in Ireland and directed by Michael Anderson who offered Harris a role in his next movie, &quot;The Wreck of the Mary Deare&quot; (1959), shot in Hollywood.

Harris played another IRA Volunteer in &quot;A Terrible Beauty&quot; (1960), alongside Robert Mitchum. He had a memorable bit part in the film &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961) as a Royal Australian Air Force pilot who reports that blowing up the &quot;bloody guns&quot; of the island of Navarone is impossible by an air raid. He had a larger part in &quot;The Long and the Short and the Tall&quot; (1961), playing a British soldier; Harris clashed with Laurence Harvey and Richard Todd during filming. For his role in the film &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1962), despite being virtually unknown to film audiences, Harris reportedly insisted on third billing, behind Trevor Howard and Marlon Brando, an actor he greatly admired. However, Harris fell out with Brando over the latter&#x27;s behaviour during the film&#x27;s production.

Harris&#x27;s first starring role was in the film &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; (1963), as a bitter young coal miner, Frank Machin, who becomes an acclaimed rugby league football player. It was based on the novel by David Storey and directed by Lindsay Anderson. For his role, Harris won Best Actor in 1963 at the Cannes Film Festival and an Academy Award nomination. Harris followed this with a leading role in the Italian film, Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;Il Deserto Rosso&quot; (&quot;Red Desert&quot;, 1964). This won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.

Harris received an offer to support Kirk Douglas in a British war film, &quot;The Heroes of Telemark&quot; (1965), directed by Anthony Mann, playing a Norwegian resistance leader. He then went to Hollywood to support Charlton Heston in Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;Major Dundee&quot; (1965), as an Irish immigrant who became a Confederate cavalryman during the American Civil War. He played Cain in John Huston&#x27;s film &quot;The Bible: In the Beginning...&quot; (1966). More successful at the box office was &quot;Hawaii&quot; (1966), in which Harris starred alongside Julie Andrews and Max von Sydow.

=== 1967–1971: Rise to prominence ===
As a change of pace, he was the romantic lead in a Doris Day spy spoof comedy, &quot;Caprice&quot; (1967), directed by Frank Tashlin. Harris next performed the role of King Arthur in the film adaptation of the musical play &quot;Camelot&quot; (1967). Critic Roger Ebert described the casting of Harris and Vanessa Redgrave as &quot;about the best King Arthur and Queen Guenevere I can imagine&quot;. Harris revived the role on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theatre from 15 November 1981 to 2 January 1982, and broadcast on HBO a year later. Starring Meg Bussert as Guenevere, Richard Muenz as Lancelot and Thor Fields as Tom of Warwick. Harris, who had starred in the film, and Muenz also took the show on tour nationwide.

In &quot;The Molly Maguires&quot; (1970), he played James McParland, the detective who infiltrates the title organisation, headed by Sean Connery. It was a box office flop. However &quot;A Man Called Horse&quot; (1970), with Harris in the title role, an 1825 English aristocrat who is captured by Native Americans, was a major success. He played the title role in the film &quot;Cromwell&quot; in 1970 opposite Alec Guinness as King Charles I of England. That year British exhibitors voted him the 9th-most popular star at the UK box office.

In 1971 Harris starred in a BBC TV film adaptation &quot;The Snow Goose&quot;, from a screenplay by Paul Gallico. It won a Golden Globe for Best Movie made for TV and was nominated for both a BAFTA and an Emmy. and was shown in the U.S. as part of the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;. He made his directorial debut with &quot;Bloomfield&quot; (1971) and starred in &quot;Man in the Wilderness&quot; (1971), a revisionist Western based on the Hugh Glass story.

=== 1973–1981: Established actor ===

Harris starred in a Western for Samuel Fuller, &quot;Riata&quot;, which stopped production several weeks into filming. The project was re-assembled with a new director and cast, except for Harris, who returned: &quot;The Deadly Trackers&quot; (1973). In 1973, Harris published a book of poetry, &quot;I, In the Membership of My Days&quot;, which was later reissued in part in an audio LP format, augmented by self-penned songs such as &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot;.

Harris starred in two thrillers: &quot;99 and 44/100% Dead&quot; (1974), for John Frankenheimer, and &quot;Juggernaut&quot; (1974), for Richard Lester. In &quot;Echoes of a Summer&quot; (1976) he played the father of a young girl with a terminal illness. He had a cameo as Richard the Lionheart in &quot;Robin and Marian&quot; (1976), for Lester, then was in &quot;The Return of a Man Called Horse&quot; (1976). Harris led the all-star cast in the train disaster film &quot;The Cassandra Crossing&quot; (1976). He played Gulliver in the part-animated &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1977) and was reunited with Michael Anderson in &quot;Orca&quot; (1977), battling a killer whale.

He appeared in another action film, &quot;Golden Rendezvous&quot; (1977), based on a novel by Alistair Maclean, shot in South Africa. Harris was sued by the film&#x27;s producer for his drinking; Harris counter-sued for defamation and the matter was settled out of court. &quot;Golden Rendezvous&quot; was a flop but &quot;The Wild Geese&quot; (1978), where Harris played one of several mercenaries, was a big success outside America. &quot;Ravagers&quot; (1979) was more action, set in a post-apocalyptic world. &quot;Game for Vultures&quot; (1979) was set in Rhodesia and shot in South Africa.

In Hollywood he appeared in &quot;The Last Word&quot; (1979), then supported Bo Derek in &quot;Tarzan, the Ape Man&quot; (1981). He made a film in Canada, &quot;Your Ticket Is No Longer Valid&quot; (1981), a drama about impotence. He followed it with another Canadian film, &quot;Highpoint&quot;, a movie so bad it was not released for several years.

=== 1980–1988: Continued success ===
For a while in the 1980s, Harris went into semi-retirement on Paradise Island, in the Bahamas, where he kicked his drinking habit and embraced a healthier lifestyle. It had a beneficial effect. Harris&#x27;s career was revived by his success on stage in &quot;Camelot&quot;, and powerful performance in the West End run of Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV&quot;.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1990, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel during the curtain call of the Pirandello&#x27;s play &quot;Henry IV&quot; at the Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in London. Over several years in the late 1980s, Harris worked with Irish author Michael Feeney Callan on his biography, which was published by Sidgwick &amp; Jackson in 1990. His film work during this period included: &quot;Triumphs of a Man Called Horse&quot; (1983), &quot;Martin&#x27;s Day&quot; (1985), &quot;Strike Commando 2&quot; (1988), &quot;King of the Wind&quot; (1990) and &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; (1990) (a film version of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; in which he played J.J. Peachum ) plus the TV film version of Maigret, opposite Barbara Shelley. This indicated declining popularity which Harris told his biographer, Michael Feeney Callan, he was &quot;utterly reconciled to&quot;.

=== 1989–2002: Stardom and final roles ===
In June 1989, director Jim Sheridan cast Harris in the lead role in &quot;The Field&quot;, written by the esteemed Irish playwright John B. Keane. The lead role of &quot;Bull&quot; McCabe was to be played by former Abbey Theatre actor Ray McAnally. When McAnally died suddenly on 15 June 1989, Harris was offered the McCabe role. &quot;The Field&quot; was released in 1990 and earned Harris his second Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. He lost to Jeremy Irons for &quot;Reversal of Fortune&quot;. In 1992, Harris had a supporting role in the film &quot;Patriot Games&quot;. He had good roles in &quot;Unforgiven&quot; (1992), &quot;Wrestling Ernest Hemingway&quot; (1993) and &quot;Silent Tongue&quot; (1994). He played the title role in &quot;Abraham&quot; (1994) and had the lead in &quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot; (1995).

A lifelong supporter of Jesuit education principles, Harris established a friendship with University of Scranton President Rev. J. A. Panuska and raised funds for a scholarship for Irish students established in honour of his brother and manager, Dermot, who had died the previous year of a heart attack. He chaired acting workshops and cast the university&#x27;s production of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; in November 1987.

Harris appeared in two films which won the Academy Award for Best Picture: firstly as the gunfighter &quot;English Bob&quot; in the revisionist Western &quot;Unforgiven&quot; (1992); secondly as the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius in Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000). He also played a lead role alongside James Earl Jones in the Darrell Roodt film adaptation of &quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot; (1995). In 1999, Harris starred in the film &quot;To Walk with Lions&quot;. After &quot;Gladiator&quot;, Harris played the supporting role of Albus Dumbledore in the first two of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001) and &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (2002), the latter of which was his final film role. Harris portrayed Abbé Faria in Kevin Reynolds&#x27; film adaptation of &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (2002). The film &quot;&quot; (2003) was dedicated to him posthumously as he had voiced the character Opaz before his death.

Harris hesitated to take the role of Dumbledore in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001) owing to the multi-film commitment and his declining health, but he ultimately accepted because, according to his account of the story, his 11-year-old granddaughter threatened never to speak to him again if he did not take it. In an interview with the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; in 2001, Harris expressed his concern that his association with the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films would outshine the rest of his career. He explained, &quot;Because, you see, I don&#x27;t just want to be remembered for being in those bloody films, and I&#x27;m afraid that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going to happen to me.&quot;

Harris also made part of the Bible TV movie project filmed as a cinema production for the TV, a project produced by Lux Vide Italy with the collaboration of RAI and Channel 5 of France, and premiered in the United States in the channel TNT in the 1990s. He portrayed the main and title character in the production &quot;Abraham&quot; (1993) as well as Saint John of Patmos in the 2000 TV film production &quot;Apocalypse&quot;.

== Singing career ==
Harris recorded several albums of music, one of which, &quot;A Tramp Shining&quot;, included the seven-minute hit song &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; (Harris insisted on singing the lyric as &quot;MacArthur&#x27;s Park&quot;). This song was written by Jimmy Webb, and it reached number 2 on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. It also topped several music sales charts in Europe during the summer of 1968. &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. In 2024, &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; was featured in the wedding sequence of the Tim Burton film &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot;. A second album, also consisting entirely of music composed by Webb, &quot;The Yard Went on Forever&quot;, was released in 1969. In the 1973 TV special &quot;Burt Bacharach in Shangri-La&quot;, after singing Webb&#x27;s &quot;Didn&#x27;t We&quot;, Harris tells Bacharach that since he was not a trained singer he approached songs as an actor concerned with words and emotions, acting the song with the sort of honesty the song is trying to convey. Then he proceeds to sing &quot;If I Could Go Back&quot;, from the &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; soundtrack.

== Personal life ==

In 1957, Harris married Elizabeth Rees-Williams, daughter of David Rees-Williams, 1st Baron Ogmore. They had three children: director Damian Harris, actor Jared Harris and actor Jamie Harris. Harris and Rees-Williams divorced in 1969, after which Elizabeth married Rex Harrison. Harris&#x27;s second marriage was to the American actress Ann Turkel in 1974. They divorced in 1982.

Harris was a member of the Knights of Malta.

Harris paid £75,000 for William Burges&#x27; Tower House in Holland Park in 1968, after discovering that the American entertainer Liberace had arranged to buy the house but had not yet put down a deposit. Harris employed the original decorators, Campbell Smith &amp; Company Ltd., to carry out extensive restoration work on the interior.

Harris was a vocal supporter of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) from 1973 until 1984. In January 1984, remarks he made on the previous month&#x27;s Harrods bombing caused great controversy, after which he discontinued his support for the PIRA.

At the height of his stardom in the 1960s and early 1970s, Harris was almost as well known for his hellraiser lifestyle and heavy drinking as he was for his acting career. He was a longtime alcoholic until he became a teetotaller in 1981. Nevertheless, he did resume drinking Guinness a decade later. He gave up drugs after almost dying from a cocaine overdose in 1978.

== Illness and death ==
Harris was diagnosed with Hodgkin&#x27;s disease in August 2002, reportedly after being hospitalised with pneumonia. He died at University College Hospital in Bloomsbury, London, on 25 October 2002, aged 72. Harris quipped &quot;It was the food!&quot; as he was wheeled out of the Savoy Hotel for the last time. Harris spent his final three days in a coma. Harris&#x27;s body was cremated, and his ashes were scattered in The Bahamas, where he owned a home.

Harris was a lifelong friend of actor Peter O&#x27;Toole, and his family reportedly hoped that O&#x27;Toole would replace Harris as Dumbledore in &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (2004). There were, however, concerns about insuring O&#x27;Toole for the six remaining films in the series. Harris was ultimately succeeded as Dumbledore by Michael Gambon. Chris Columbus, director of the first two &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, had visited Harris during his last days and had promised not to recast Dumbledore, confident of his eventual recovery. In a 2021 interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Columbus revealed that Harris was writing an autobiography during his stay at the hospital, but it has not been published since.

== Memorials and legacy ==

On 30 September 2006, Manuel Di Lucia, of Kilkee, County Clare, a longtime friend, organised the placement in Kilkee of a bronze life-size statue of Richard Harris. It shows Harris at the age of eighteen playing the sport of Racquetball. (He had won the local competition three or four consecutive times during the late 1940s.) The sculptor was Seamus Connolly and the work was unveiled by Russell Crowe. Harris was an accomplished squash racquets player, winning the Tivoli Cup in Kilkee four consecutive years (1948 to 1951), a record unsurpassed to this day.

Another life-size statue of Richard Harris, as King Arthur from his film &quot;Camelot&quot;, has been erected in Bedford Row, in the centre of his home town of Limerick. The sculptor of this statue was the Irish sculptor Jim Connolly, a graduate of the Limerick School of Art and Design.

At the 2009 BAFTAs, Mickey Rourke dedicated his Best Actor award to Harris, calling him a &quot;good friend and great actor&quot;.

In 2013, Rob Gill and Zeb Moore founded the annual Richard Harris International Film Festival.
The Richard Harris Film Festival is one of Ireland&#x27;s fastest-growing film festivals, growing from just ten films in 2013 to over 115 films in 2017. Each year, one of Harris&#x27;s sons attends the festival in Limerick.

In 2015, the Limerick Writers&#x27; Centre unveiled a commemorative plaque outside Charlie St George&#x27;s pub on Parnell Street. The pub was a favourite drinking place of Harris on his visits to Limerick. The plaque, celebrating Harris&#x27;s literary output as part of a Literary Walking Tour of Limerick, was unveiled by his son Jared Harris.

In 1996, Harris was honoured with a commemorative Irish postage stamp for the &quot;Centenary of Irish Cinema&quot;, a four-stamp set featuring twelve Irish actors in four Irish films. He was again honoured in ‘Irish Abroad’ stamps in 2020.

Ridley Scott, who directed Harris in &quot;Gladiator&quot;, would later cast Paul Mescal as Lucius Verus in &quot;Gladiator II&quot; in part because Mescal clocked a resemblance with Harris, who portrayed his character&#x27;s grandfather in the original film.

<text>In mathematics, and especially in category theory, a commutative diagram is a diagram such that all directed paths in the diagram with the same start and endpoints lead to the same result. It is said that commutative diagrams play the role in category theory that equations play in algebra.

==Description==
A commutative diagram often consists of three parts:
* objects (also known as &quot;vertices&quot;) 
* morphisms (also known as &quot;arrows&quot; or &quot;edges&quot;)
* paths or composites
===Arrow symbols===
In algebra texts, the type of morphism can be denoted with different arrow usages: 
* A monomorphism may be labeled with a formula_1 or a formula_2.
* An epimorphism may be labeled with a formula_3.
* An isomorphism may be labeled with a formula_4.
* The dashed arrow typically represents the claim that the indicated morphism exists (whenever the rest of the diagram holds); the arrow may be optionally labeled as formula_5. 
** If the morphism is in addition unique, then the dashed arrow may be labeled formula_6 or formula_7.
*If the morphism acts between two arrows (such as in the case of higher category theory), it&#x27;s called preferably a natural transformation and may be labelled as formula_8 (as seen below in this article).

The meanings of different arrows are not entirely standardized: the arrows used for monomorphisms, epimorphisms, and isomorphisms are also used for injections, surjections, and bijections, as well as the cofibrations, fibrations, and weak equivalences in a model category.

===Verifying commutativity===
Commutativity makes sense for a polygon of any finite number of sides (including just 1 or 2), and a diagram is commutative if every polygonal subdiagram is commutative.

Note that a diagram may be non-commutative, i.e., the composition of different paths in the diagram may not give the same result.

==Examples==
===Example 1===
In the left diagram, which expresses the first isomorphism theorem, commutativity of the triangle means that formula_9. In the right diagram, commutativity of the square means formula_10.
===Example 2===
In order for the diagram below to commute, three equalities must be satisfied:

# formula_11
# formula_12
# formula_13

Here, since the first equality follows from the last two, it suffices to show that (2) and (3) are true in order for the diagram to commute. However, since equality (3) generally does not follow from the other two, it is generally not enough to have only equalities (1) and (2) if one were to show that the diagram commutes.

==Diagram chasing==
Diagram chasing (also called diagrammatic search) is a method of mathematical proof used especially in homological algebra, where one establishes a property of some morphism by tracing the elements of a commutative diagram. A proof by diagram chasing typically involves the formal use of the properties of the diagram, such as injective or surjective maps, or exact sequences. A syllogism is constructed, for which the graphical display of the diagram is just a visual aid. It follows that one ends up &quot;chasing&quot; elements around the diagram, until the desired element or result is constructed or verified.

Examples of proofs by diagram chasing include those typically given for the five lemma, the snake lemma, the zig-zag lemma, and the nine lemma.

== In higher category theory ==
In higher category theory, one considers not only objects and arrows, but arrows between the arrows, arrows between arrows between arrows, and so on . For example, the category of small categories Cat is naturally a 2-category, with functors as its arrows and natural transformations as the arrows between functors. In this setting, commutative diagrams may include these higher arrows as well, which are often depicted in the following style: formula_8. For example, the following (somewhat trivial) diagram depicts two categories &#x27; and &#x27;, together with two functors , : &#x27; → &#x27; and a natural transformation : ⇒ :

There are two kinds of composition in a 2-category (called vertical composition and horizontal composition), and they may also be depicted via pasting diagrams (see 2-category#Definition for examples).

== Diagrams as functors ==
A commutative diagram in a category &quot;C&quot; can be interpreted as a functor from an index category &quot;J&quot; to &quot;C;&quot; one calls the functor a diagram.

More formally, a commutative diagram is a visualization of a diagram indexed by a poset category. Such a diagram typically includes:
* a node for every object in the index category,
* an arrow for a generating set of morphisms (omitting identity maps and morphisms that can be expressed as compositions),
* the commutativity of the diagram (the equality of different compositions of maps between two objects), corresponding to the uniqueness of a map between two objects in a poset category.

Conversely, given a commutative diagram, it defines a poset category, where:
* the objects are the nodes,
* there is a morphism between any two objects if and only if there is a (directed) path between the nodes,
* with the relation that this morphism is unique (any composition of maps is defined by its domain and target: this is the commutativity axiom).

However, not every diagram commutes (the notion of diagram strictly generalizes commutative diagram). As a simple example, the diagram of a single object with an endomorphism (formula_15), or with two parallel arrows (formula_16, that is, formula_17, sometimes called the free quiver), as used in the definition of equalizer need not commute. Further, diagrams may be messy or impossible to draw, when the number of objects or morphisms is large (or even infinite).

==History==

The area was populated by some of the earliest settlers to the area, with the safety of Prickett&#x27;s Fort sitting directly across the Monongahela River. David Morgan (frontiersman) moved there in 1772. That&#x27;s also the location where he saved his family from an attack by Indians in 1778, based on a fevered dream he had, while recuperating from an illness at the fort. The house still stands there in Rivesville. Now known as the Morgan-Gold House, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

Rivesville was platted in 1837, and named after William Cabell Rives.

In 1900, it was a very small town, population 164, growing to 190 in 1910. This was immediately before the development of large-scale coal mining in the area and the subsequent population growth.

In the early 20th century, Rivesville was at the junction between the Pawpaw branch of the B&amp;O Railroad and the Buckhannon &amp; Northern Railroad, a branch of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie a predecessor that was incorporated into the Monongahela Railway formed in 1915.

Rivesville was also served by the Fairmont-Clarksburg Division of the Monongahela-West Pen Railways, originally the Monongahela Power and Railway Company. This electric interurban line ran from Fairmont through Rivesville to the Rivesville Power Station, just north of town.

==Institutions==

===Schools===
The Rivesville Elementary/Middle school, formerly Rivesville High School, is administered by the Marion County Schools. It has 37 teachers and has been affiliated with the West Virginia University Benedum Collaborative as a Professional Development School since 1997. Tyson Furgason is currently principal. Based on 2007 test scores, the school ranked close to average for the state of West Virginia. In 2007, the school enrolled 338 students between kindergarten and grade 8.

===Power plant===
The Rivesville Power Plant was built by Monongahela Power and Railway Company in 1919 and is currently operated by Allegheny Energy. Unit 5, installed in 1944 had a power output of 48 megawatts; Unit 6, installed in 1951, was 94 megawatts. The plant used open loop cooling, drawing up to 69.8 million gallons per day of cooling water from the Monongahela River. The coal stockpile at the plant had a capacity of 50,000 tons, and coal was delivered by barge. Earlier, coal was delivered by rail. The plant was connected to the grid by 138Kv transmission lines. In the mid 1970s, this was the first commercial power plant to use fluidized bed combustion to fire its boilers. , this power plant employed 33 people. New environmental regulations forced the company to shut down the plant in 2012, along with two others elsewhere in the state.

===Coal mining===
About the only area around Rivesville where the coal has not been mined out is directly under the older portion of the town and under the riverbed. Consolidation Coal Company Mine No. 97 was in the Pittsburgh coal seam around 100 feet below the level of the riverbed. This mine operated between 1922 and 1954, with a peak production of 670408 tons per year. The coal seam itself is 6 to 8 feet thick. The number 97 Hoist Shaft was directly west of the westernmost corner of the Power Plant, with the hoisting engines to the north across the tracks. Consol. Mine No. 24 was directly across the river, with its shaft in the company town of Montana Mines, and in 1943, plans were filed to connect these mines with an under-river crossing. In 1934, Consol. No. 97 employed 412 men, all of whom were UMWA members. The daily wage ranged from $6.37 for loaders to $9.29 for cutters.
Other mines in the area exploited the shallower Sewickley Coal Seam, largely above the river level to the north and east. Between 1901 and 1913, for example, the Parker Run Coal and Coke Company operated a mine just east of Rivesville, shipping coal by rail and barge. In 1910, this mine employed 60 miners. In 1913, it employed 10 laborers and 25 miners to take 500 tons of coal a day. The coal in this seam was over 6 feet thick, but higher in sulfur than the Pittsburgh seam. Mines in the Sewickley seam were opened earlier and mined out earlier than the mines in the Pittsburgh Seam.

In 1913, the Monongahela Valley Traction Company had a mine in the even shallower Waynesburg coal seam about a mile southwest of Rivesville near Dakota. This coal seam was about 5 feet thick, including an intermediate shale bed one foot thick. By 1921, Monongahela Traction had opened a second mine in the area near Baxter, about a mile up Paw Paw creek. As of 1921, other mines listed as being in Rivesville included the Rivesville Coal Company&#x27;s Hood Mine, the Winfield Coal Company&#x27;s River Side Mine, and the Virginia &amp; Pittsburgh Coal &amp; Coke Co.&#x27;s Morgan mine.

==Neighborhoods==
Benwood is partitioned into four sections (North Benwood, Center Benwood, South Benwood and Boggs Run) each connected by either Marshall Street or West Virginia Route 2.

North Benwood

North Benwood is the primary commercial area of the small city and contains several businesses and fast food restaurants. While all of Benwood lies in a flood zone, North Benwood tends to be hit hardest by the floods of the Ohio River.

Center Benwood

Slightly to the south lies Center Benwood, which is the primary residential section of the city and contains Saint John Roman Catholic Church, Benwood City Park (established in 1973), the Fourth Street Playground, the city building, the fire, water and police departments, the post office, and the Blake Brothers Post No. 46 American Legion. Center Benwood is laid out in a rectangular grid, approximately 1 mile around divided 4 blocks long and 3 streets wide. Center Benwood used to be hit very hard by the devastating floods of the Ohio River, but a flood wall was constructed along Water Street (the street that runs along the banks of the Ohio River) in 1982, thus protecting that section of Benwood from the river floods seen in the last three decades (1990, 1991, 1996, 2004, 2005 and 2011).

South Benwood

South Benwood lies below Center Benwood and contains the majority of the city&#x27;s industrial developments.

Boggs Run

The Boggs Run area of Benwood contains the land extending from Marshall Street at the mouth of Boggs Run to the confluence of Boggs Run and Browns Run. That portion of land was annexed to the city of Benwood on November 7, 1944. Boggs Run (the creek that runs through the land) is named after John Boggs (1738–1826), who staked his claim to the land surrounding the creek in 1774 and settled there with his family along the creek. In 1798, he sold the land at Boggs Run and moved with most of his family to Pickaway County, Ohio where he lived the remainder of his life. He is buried in the Boggs Family Cemetery (Elmwood Farm) in Logan Elm Village, Pickaway County, Ohio.

Boggs Run has seen many devastating flash floods through the years, but one of the worst in recent history occurred August 31, 1975. Three other significant flash floods in the 20th and 21st Centuries occurred on June 14, 1990, September 17, 2004 and July 28, 2017. In the event of an Ohio River Flood, the mouth of Boggs Run is flooded both by the river and the creek, as the river flood backs up the flow of the creek.

Outlying areas

While the areas of Benwood Hill and a portion of Boggs Run beyond where Browns Run flows into Boggs Run are provided with some services from Benwood&#x27;s public works, they fall outside the city limits and are not directly parts of the city.

Former neighborhoods

Harmony Hill was a residential area of Benwood that was located on the hillside between the mouth of Boggs Run and Schad&#x27;s Crossing (former entrance to the north end of Center Benwood at Fourth Street) along West Virginia Route 2. Kentucky Heights was another residential area located on the hillside along Route 2 between Schad&#x27;s Crossing at Center Benwood and The Bellaire Bridge. The homes and businesses of both areas were all razed to make way for the relocation of West Virginia Route 2 through the construction of the present four-lane highway in 1966.

==Religion==
Benwood was once home to three churches of different religious denominations. Of the three churches, two remain in operation.

Saint John Roman Catholic Church

Saint John Roman Catholic Church, located at 622 Main Street in Center Benwood, was officially established as a parish on August 1, 1875 when the first resident pastor, Rev. Patrick F. McKernan, was appointed to serve the Roman Catholic residents of Benwood. Prior to 1875, the original church, which had been constructed about 1868 and was dedicated to Saint John, was served by visiting priests from surrounding parishes. The original church was damaged in the Ohio River Flood of February 1884. As a result, the church was demolished, and a new church was built on the same site between 1891 and 1892. The cornerstone for the second church was laid on June 28, 1891. The second church served the parish for one hundred and twenty-four years until it was destroyed by a fire on March 30, 2015. The 1891 church, along with the rectory, was demolished between May 2015 and August 2015. Ground was broken for the third Saint John Church on June 28, 2016. The new church was constructed on the same site as the 1891 church. Construction was completed in the summer of 2017. The new church was blessed and dedicated on September 9, 2017. The first regular Sunday Mass was celebrated in the new church on September 17, 2017.

The majority of the parish consists of the descendants of immigrants from several different European ethnic groups (Irish, English, Scottish, Welsh, German, Hungarian, Italian, Croatian, Slovak, Czech, Austrian, Serbian, Slovenian, Romanian, Polish, Lithuanian, Ukrainian and Russian) who settled in Benwood and the outlying areas of Boggs Run and Browns Run in the mid to late 1800s and early 1900s.

Saint John Church is a parish within the Wheeling Vicariate of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston. Since June 20, 1995, Saint John Church and Saint James Roman Catholic Church in the neighboring city of McMechen have been served by the same pastor. On June 15, 2016, the pastor of Saint John Church and Saint James Church was also appointed the pastor of Saint Alphonsus Roman Catholic Church in Wheeling, West Virginia.

Saint Matthew Evangelical Lutheran Church

Saint Matthew Lutheran Church is located in Boggs Run on Boggs Run Road just outside the Benwood city limits. The church was formerly located in what is now the Blake Brothers Post No. 46 American Legion building in Center Benwood on Water Street. It was relocated to the present church built on Boggs Run in 1941.

Benwood Methodist Episcopal Church

A Methodist Episcopal (M.E.) Church was formerly located in Center Benwood. The first structure that housed the church was located on Eighth Street. It was later relocated to a new church built on Main Street in 1900, which was razed in the early 1990s.

==Education==
Benwood was once home to several public schools and two Roman Catholic private schools. Marshall County Schools operates area public schools.

Public Schools

There was a public elementary school in Center Benwood. During the course of its history, three separate buildings housed this school located on Water Street. The first school building was built in the late 1860s and razed to build a larger school in 1873. The second school building was built in 1873 and razed in 1901. The third and final school building was built in 1901. The school closed in 1953, and the building was later razed.

A public elementary school was located in North Benwood and closed in 1953 as well. The Croatian Cultural Club building housed this school.

South Benwood had a public elementary school, but it was destroyed by fire in the early 1910s.

Boggs Run Elementary School is located on Boggs Run Road beyond the Benwood city limits. It was first housed in a wooden structure, but was later replaced with a brick structure on the same site about 1927. The school closed in 1990 at the end of the 1989–1990 school year. The brick school building still stands, and it now houses a Halloween museum.

Union High School, located in South Benwood on Marshall Street, was established in 1913 when Benwood High School was consolidated with McMechen High School. Union operated as a high school (grades 9, 10, 11 and 12) for fifty-five years, from 1913 until the end of the 1967–1968 school year, graduating its last class in 1968. Union High School was consolidated with two other public high schools in Marshall County (Moundsville High School and Sherrard High School, which both became junior high schools and are still in operation) in 1968 to form John Marshall High School in the city of Glen Dale in Marshall County. John Marshall High School opened at the beginning of the 1968–1969 school year and is still in operation. Union then became a junior high school (grades 7, 8 and 9) until it closed in 2003 at the end of the 2002–2003 school year.

Parochial/Private Schools

Saint James and Saint John School was a Roman Catholic elementary and middle school (preschool through eighth grade) that was located on 7th Street in Center Benwood. The origin of Saint John School dated back to 1860. The school, which was connected to the back of Saint John Roman Catholic Church, was housed in several different buildings in the immediate area during the course of its history before the most recent school building was built during 1952–1953 and opened in January 1954. At the end of the 1970–1971 school year, Saint John School in Benwood was consolidated with Saint James School in McMechen, and the school became known as Saint James and Saint John School in 1971. After the fire that destroyed Saint John Church on March 30, 2015, the school was moved to the former Saint Francis Xavier School in Moundsville, West Virginia (closed in 2012) where the students finished the 2014–2015 school year. On May 18, 2015, it was announced by the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston that the school would remain in Moundsville. The school would be renamed All Saints Catholic School. All Saints operated for two school years (2015 - 2016 and 2016 - 2017) and was a Diocesan school rather than a parish school. It was announced on June 22, 2017 that it would close. All Saints Catholic School served the parishioners of Saint John in Benwood, Saint James in McMechen, Saint Jude in Glen Dale, Saint Francis Xavier in Moundsville, Saint Martin of Tours in Cameron and Saint Joseph in Proctor. Saint James and Saint John School was demolished in August 2015.

Saint Catherine School was a Roman Catholic elementary and middle school (first through eighth grade) that was located on Marshall Street in North Benwood. The building, which once stood on the site of the parking lot of the former Pic-way Shoe Store (later the Payless ShoeSource) on Marshall Street, was originally used as a Roman Catholic chapel dedicated to Saint Catherine from 1924 to 1928. It was founded by Croatian immigrants, and it operated as its own parish during those years. In 1929, a school by the same name was opened in the chapel building and continued to operate until Saint Catherine School closed in 1962 at the end of the 1961–1962 school year.

The majority of the students who attended the former Saint John School in Center Benwood (later Saint James and Saint John School) and the former Saint Catherine School in North Benwood went on to attend high school at Bishop Donahue Memorial High School in McMechen, which was founded in 1955. Bishop Donahue High School closed in 2017 at the end of the 2016 - 2017 school year.

<text>Point Pleasant is a city in and the county seat of Mason County, West Virginia, United States, at the confluence of the Ohio and Kanawha Rivers. The population was 4,101 at the 2020 census. It is the principal city of the Point Pleasant micropolitan area extending into Ohio. The town is best known for the Mothman, a purported humanoid creature reportedly sighted in the area that has become a part of West Virginia folklore.

==History==
A Shawnee village known as Upper Shawneetown was established in this area before 1749, which the Shawnees called &quot;Chinoudaista&quot; or &quot;Chinodahichetha.&quot;

=== The Céloron Expedition (1749) ===
In the second half of 1749, the French explorer Pierre Joseph Céloron de Blainville (1693-1759) claimed French sovereignty over the Ohio Valley, burying a lead plaque at the meeting point of the Ohio and Kanawha Rivers.

The text on the plaque is as follows: 
:&quot;L&#x27;AN 1749 DV REGNE DE LOVIS XV ROY DE FRANCE, NOVS CELORON, COMMANDANT D&#x27;VN DETACHEMENT ENVOIE PAR MONSIEVR LE MIS. DE LA GALISSONIERE, COMMANDANT GENERAL DE LA NOUVELLE FRANCE POVR RETABLIR LA TRAN QUILLITE DANS QUELQUES VILLAGES SAUVAGES DE CES CANTONS, AVONS ENTERRE CETTE PLAQUE AU CONFLUENT DE L&#x27;OHIO ET DE TCHADAKOIN CE 29 JVILLET, PRES DE LA RIVIERE OYO AUTREMENT BELLE RIVIERE, POUR MONUMENT DU RENOUVELLEMENT DE POSSESSION QUE NOUS AVONS PRIS DE LA DITTE RIVIERE OYO, ET DE TOUTES CELLE~ QUI Y TOMBENT, ET DE TOUTES LES TERRES DES DEUX COTES JVSQVE AVX SOURCES DES DITTES RIVIERES AINSI QV&#x27;EN ONT JOVY OU DV JOVIR LES PRECEDENTS ROIS DE FRANCE, ET QU&#x27;ILS S&#x27;Y SONT MAINTENVS PAR LES ARMES ET PAR LES TRAIT TES, SPECIALEMENT PAR CEVX DE RISWICK D&#x27;VTRECHT ET D&#x27;AIX LA CHAPELLE.&quot;

:&quot;(In the year 1749, in the reign of King Louis XV, we, Celoron, commander of a detachment sent by Commander de La Galissonière, Commander General of New France, for the restoration of peace in various untamed villages in the region, have buried this plaque at the confluence of the Ohio and Tchadakoin [Rivers] this 29th day of July near the fine river bank, to commemorate the retaking into possession of the afore-mentioned river bank and all the surrounding lands on both river shores back to the river sources, as secured by previous kings of France, and maintained by force of arms and by treaties, specifically the Treaties of Rijswick, of Utrecht and of Aix la Chapelle) &quot;

Céloron&#x27;s expedition was a diplomatic failure since the local tribes remained pro-British, and British representatives refused to leave. This incident was the prelude to conflicts between the French and British in North America that would lead to the outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1754 (as part of the Seven Years&#x27; War) that would lead to the cessation of New France to the British and the ultimate expulsion of France from most of its possessions in North America.

The expedition can nevertheless be seen in more positive terms as a geographical project since the Céloron expedition was the starting point for the first map of the Ohio Valley, which was the work of the Jesuit Joseph Pierre de Bonnecamps.

In 1770, Colonel George Washington visited the confluence that would become Point Pleasant, then proceeded 14 miles up the &quot;Great Kanawha&quot; and later reported that &quot;This Country abounds in Buffalo and Wild game of all kinds as also in all kinds of wild fowl, there being in the Bottoms a great many small grassy Ponds or Lakes which are full of Swans, Geese, and Ducks of different kinds.&quot;

=== The Battle of Point Pleasant (1774) ===

In the Battle of Point Pleasant (October 10, 1774), fought on the future site of the town, over one thousand Virginia militiamen, led by Colonel Andrew Lewis (1720–1781), defeated a roughly equal force of an Algonquin confederation of Shawnee and Mingo warriors led by Shawnee Chief Cornstalk (c. 1720–1777). The event is celebrated locally as the &quot;First Battle of the American Revolutionary War,&quot; and in 1908, the U.S. Senate authorized the erection of a local monument to commemorate it as such. Most historians, however, regard it not as a battle of the Revolution (1775–1783) but as a part of Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War (1774).
===Settlement===
&quot;Camp Point Pleasant&quot; was established by Col. Lewis at the time of the Battle, and the settlement that followed also took that name. Although not certain, Point Pleasant may have been permanently settled by whites as early as 1774. At about that time, a permanent stockade known as Fort Blair was erected there. Before that, hostilities between whites and Native Americans all along the Ohio River Valley probably precluded the possibility of settlement in the absence of a substantial stockade. In 1776, a new fort was built on the site of the earlier fort and named for the recently deceased Virginia official Peyton Randolph (1721–1775). Fort Randolph is best remembered as the place where Chief Cornstalk was murdered in 1777. It withstood an attack by Native Americans the following year but was abandoned in 1779.

George Washington&#x27;s 1770 journey to the Ohio River Valley had been occasioned by military grants that had been awarded by proclamation in 1754 by Governor Dinwiddie to officers and soldiers who had served in the French and Indian War. The resulting survey encompassed 52,302 acres (or 80 square miles). It was subdivided in the 1780s as follows: 9,876 acres — including the present side of Point Pleasant — to Andrew Lewis, 5,000 acres for George Muse, 5,000 acres for Peter Hogg, 8,000 acres for Andrew Stephens, another 3,000 acres for Peter Hogg, another 5,026 acres for George Muse, 3,400 acres for Andrew Waggener, 6,000 acres for John Poulson, 6,000 acres for John West. On the lower side of the Kanawha River, 13,532 acres for Hugh Mercer (see Mercers Bottom) and, finally, 10,990 acres for Washington himself.

Fort Randolph was rebuilt nearby in 1785 after the renewal of hostilities between the United States government and Native Americans, but it saw little action and was eventually abandoned once again. The settlement at Point Pleasant did not receive an official charter until 1794.

===19th century===
Mason County was carved out of Kanawha County in 1804, and Point Pleasant was designated the county seat then. According to historian Virgil A. Lewis, &quot;Point Pleasant did not flourish for many years [after the turn of the century]. There was no church for over fifty years, and society was low. There was a popular superstition that because of the fiendish murder of Cornstalk there in 1777, the place was laid under a curse for a hundred years&quot;. Lewis also relates that a visitor to Point Pleasant in 1810 observed that ... Point Pleasant is pleasantly situated immediately above the mouth of the Great Kanawha, on an extensive and fertile bottom of the Ohio, of which it has a fine prospect up and down that river. It is the seat of justice of Mason county Virginia, and contains about 15 or 20 families, a log courthouse, a log jail and as usual (but unfortunately) in the Virginia towns, a pillory and whipping post. Point Pleasant seems rather on the stand in point of improvement, arising, it is said, from the difficulty in establishing the land titles. It is, however, a considerable place of embarkation for those descending the Ohio from the back and western parts of Virginia. There is one merchant. Mr. William Langtry.

Point Pleasant was incorporated in 1833.

During the American Civil War, the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861, Mason County&#x27;s delegate, lawyer James H. Couch (1821-1899), although an enslaver, voted against declaring secession. Mason County then sent no delegates to the Virginia House of Delegates until West Virginia&#x27;s statehood, which Virginia&#x27;s House of Delegates refused to recognize, thus seating James Hutcheson, who Confederate soldiers had elected in their camp. Meanwhile, William W. Newman claimed to represent Mason and nearby Jackson, Cabell, Wayne, and Wirt counties throughout the war. Mason County sent more than 1000 men to the Union army and one company of 61 men to the Confederate Army (the 37th Virginia Infantry). In March 1863, in the only wartime skirmish in Point Pleasant, during the Jones-Imboden Raid, the 6th Virginia Cavalry and 8th Virginia Cavalry attacked the Mason County Courthouse, where they believed munitions stored, leaving bullet holes in the walls until a replacement was built in 1954.

===20th century===
Point Pleasant was widely noted for the 1967 collapse of the Silver Bridge, which killed 46 people.

On October 10, 1974, Point Pleasant celebrated the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Point Pleasant. A replica of Fort Randolph was built in 1973-74 and dedicated as part of the festivities. The town of Point Pleasant was situated over the site of the fort and so the replica is located at Krodel Park, about one mile away.

===The Mothman===

Paranormal enthusiasts flock to Point Pleasant in search of Mothman, a creature said to be a harbinger of imminent disaster that inhabits an abandoned TNT factory from World War II. John Keel published a book in 1975 entitled &quot;The Mothman Prophecies&quot;, and a film inspired by the novel was released in January 2002. Later, another film, loosely based on the legend, was also released. The town is host to a Mothman Museum, and every year, it holds a Mothman Festival that features tours, pageants, balls, films, music, and other events to celebrate what they consider &quot;one of Point Pleasant&#x27;s largest tourist attractions.&quot; A 12-foot-tall metallic statue of the creature stands in Point Pleasant.

<text>Gary is a city located along the Tug Fork River in McDowell County, West Virginia, United States. According to the 2020 census, the city had a population of 762. It was named for Elbert Henry Gary, one of the founders of U.S. Steel. The former coal towns of Elbert, Filbert, Thorpe, and Wilcoe became part of Gary at the time of its incorporation in 1971.

==History==

In 1902, U.S. Steel began housing people in Gary Hollow for employment at one of the coal town&#x27;s fourteen mines that produced metallurgical coal.

During the early 1940s, Gary Hollow, named for Elbert Henry Gary, produced around a quarter of the amount of coal mined from McDowell County, as well as a quarter of the coal used by U.S. Steel during World War II. At the time, the town boasted a large number of African American miners and began integrating the school system in the 1950s. However, Gary Hollow&#x27;s education system was not completely integrated until 1964.

On July 1, 1971, the city of Gary was incorporated after the city held an election on March 16, 1970. Beginning in the 1970s, Gary&#x27;s unemployment rate began to increase after most of the high-quality metallurgical coal had already been mined. In March 1982 alone, around 550 miners employed by U.S. Steel in the town were laid off. By the end of 1982, all U.S. Steel mines located in Gary were closed. Former mayor, Charles Hodge claimed that U.S. Steel failed to make an effort help the city.

In March 1983, the unemployment rate rose to 90%, the highest of any town in the United States. Four years later, Gary Enterprise reopened one of the mines after purchasing it from U.S. Steel, and other companies arranged sub-leases to mine the remaining coal that was accessible. In 1990, Gary only had 180 mining jobs. Two years later, the now demolished U.S. Coal and Coke Company Store at Ream was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In July 2003, U.S. Steel announced that they sold their remaining assets to PinnOak Resources.

<text>Keystone is a city in McDowell County, West Virginia, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 176. Keystone is one of the few municipalities in West Virginia with an African-American majority, with 65 percent of the residents being black.

The term &quot;Free State of McDowell&quot; was coined by Matthew Thomas Whittico, a local newspaper editor and community leader from Keystone in the early 20th century. Keystone possessed a unique combination of political, social, and economic characteristics that made it an attractive place for African-Americans to migrate to in the late 1800s and early 1900s.

==History==
Keystone was founded in 1892 by the Keystone Coal &amp; Coke Company. Keystone was then incorporated in 1909 by the Circuit Court of McDowell County. Its name is derived from the name of the coal and coke company operating at that point. The city was formerly known as Cassville.

On May 1, 1895, 15,000 union miners (predominantly black) assembled in Keystone and armed themselves, planning to march across the state line to Virginia in order to force the Virginia miners in one bordering mine (also predominantly black) to unionize. The governor of Virginia, Charles O&#x27;Ferrall, ordered an artillery company and six infantry companies to the Virginia border, but West Virginia Governor William MacCorkle refused repeated requests from O&#x27;Ferrall to reciprocate.

This was in response to the N&amp;W Railroad lowering the minimum price guarantee on coal shipped to Tidewater ports. The operators reduced wages by 20% in response and encouraged their miners to strike. By the end of April that year, the mines on the WV side had completely shut down, but a large mine across the state line in Virginia continued to operate.

The strike collapsed by the end of August. The UMWA was a relatively young union, and could not support a strike of this magnitude. In the end, most of the mines resumed operations with mostly imported strikebreakers.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

The town is a railway station on the Norfolk Southern Railway (former Norfolk and Western) network.

<text>Welch is a city in and the county seat of McDowell County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 3,590 at the 2020 census. Welch was incorporated as a city in 1893.

==History==
Welch was incorporated in 1893 and named after Isaiah A. Welch, a former captain in the Confederate States Army who came to the region as a surveyor, and helped establish the plan for the beginning of a new town at the confluence of Tug Fork and Elkhorn Creek.

Welch was made the county seat of McDowell County in an election by county citizens in 1892 even before Welch was incorporated as a city. The previous county seat was in Perryville (now English) on present day West Virginia Route 83 along the Dry Fork. Results of the election were contested, so to avoid violence county records were secretly moved from Perryville to Welch at night in two wagons by James F. Strother and Trigg Tabor. 

On March 2, 1921, the Welch City Council met to discuss impeachment of then Mayor J. H. Whitt. Whitt showed up at the meeting and disrupted the proceedings. The Welch City Council then asked the McDowell Co. Sheriff&#x27;s Dept. to investigate Whitt. Later that same day, Mayor Whitt shot and killed McDowell County Deputy Sheriff William Johnson Tabor who was investigating the matter. Mayor Whitt was arrested and charged with murder but won acquittal at his trial (allegedly based on perjured testimony). Whitt left the area for parts unknown on September 27, 1921.

On August 1, 1921, detectives from the Baldwin–Felts Detective Agency assassinated Matewan Police Chief Sid Hatfield as well as Ed Chambers at the McDowell County Courthouse located in Welch.

In the first half of the 20th century during the opening of railroads and coal mines throughout the region, Welch became a prosperous city: the hub of retail business for a county approaching 100,000 in population, and the location for three hospitals. After the production boom of World War II, oil began to supplant coal in many areas of domestic fuel supply. Mechanization of coal mining reduced the number of laborers needed in coal production. McDowell County&#x27;s population peaked in 1950, and began a decline over decades to follow. In 1960, however, McDowell County still ranked number one in the United States in total coal production. The City of Welch proudly proclaimed itself &quot;The Heart of the Nation&#x27;s Coal Bin&quot;.

When presidential candidate John F. Kennedy visited Welch by automobile caravan in 1960, he saw a city whose businesses were struggling due to a growing poverty rate throughout the county. What Kennedy learned here during his campaign for the 1960 West Virginia primary was believed to be the basis of the aid brought to the Appalachian region by the Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson administrations. During a speech in Canton, Ohio on September 27, 1960, he stated &quot;McDowell County mines more coal than it ever has in its history, probably more coal than any county in the United States and yet there are more people getting surplus food packages in McDowell County than any county in the United States. The reason is that machines are doing the jobs of men, and we have not been able to find jobs for those men.&quot;

The first recipients of modern era food stamps were the Chloe and Alderson Muncy family of Paynesville, McDowell County. Their household included fifteen persons. On May 29, 1961, in the City of Welch, as a crowd of reporters witnessed the proceedings, Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman delivered $95 of federal food stamps to Mr. and Mrs. Muncy. This was the first issuance of federal food stamps under the Kennedy Administration, and it was the beginning of a rapidly expanding program of federal assistance that would be legislated in the &quot;War on Poverty&quot;.

In the 1960s and 1970s, McDowell County coal continued to be a major source of fuel for the steel and electric power generation industries. As United States steel production declined, however, McDowell County suffered further losses. In 1986, the closure of the US Steel mines in nearby Gary led to an immediate loss of more than 1,200 jobs. In the following year alone, personal income in McDowell County decreased dramatically by two-thirds. Real estate values also plummeted. Miners were forced to abandon their homes in search for new beginnings in other regions of the country.

In 2006, the city received national attention when it, along with Police Chief Robert K. Bowman were the defendants in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU after Bowman allegedly prevented rescuers from providing CPR to a gay man suffering cardiac arrest. After the wrongful death claim was allowed to proceed, the lawsuit was settled for an undetermined amount.

Welch has been the celebrated location of an annual Veterans Day Parade that, over the decades, has attracted a distinguished list of speakers, including Presidents Harry S. Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson.

The McDowell County Courthouse and Welch Commercial Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Firsts===

The first public children&#x27;s playground in West Virginia was built in Welch in 1913. It was constructed using private donations and after 1918 was maintained by the Young Women&#x27;s Missionary Society of the Methodist Church. The playground sat across the street from the McDowell County Courthouse until 1930 when it became the site for the United States Post Office.

Welch also built the first municipally owned parking building in the United States, which was opened September 1, 1941. It accommodated 232 cars and showed a profit its first year in operation.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Periodic flooding of the Elkhorn and Tug Fork rivers has plagued the future prosperity of the city. Most notably, the record flooding in 2001 and 2002 nearly destroyed Welch altogether. Flood reduction projects to prevent further destruction in the future are presently in progress.

The town has a railway station on the Norfolk Southern Railway (former Norfolk and Western) network.

<text>Bluefield is a city in Mercer County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 9,658 at the 2020 census. It is the principal city of the Bluefield micropolitan area extending into Virginia, which had a population of 106,363 in 2020.

==History==

The European-American history of Bluefield began in the 18th century, when the Davidson and Bailey families settled in a rugged and remote part of what is now southern West Virginia. Others joined them, and they built a small village with a mill, a church, a one-room schoolhouse, and a fort for defending the settlement against invasions by the Shawnee tribe, which had a village on the banks of the Bluestone River.

In 1882, the descendants of the Davidson and Bailey families sold a portion of their land, when Captain John Fields of the Norfolk and Western Railway pioneered the area and began building a new railroad through the hills of Bluefield. The city is traditionally thought to be named after the chicory flowers in the area, which give the fields a purplish blue hue during the summer. Research has shown that this settlement, also known as Higginbotham&#x27;s Summit in the 1880s, was probably named for the coal fields that were developed in the area of the Bluestone River.

===Coal rush===
Beneath the land of the Davidsons and Baileys lay the largest and richest deposit of bituminous coal in the world. The first seam was discovered in nearby Pocahontas, Virginia in the backyard of Jordan Nelson. President Frederick Kimball of the Norfolk and Western Railway described this as the &quot;most spectacular find on the continent and indeed perhaps of the entire planet.&quot; The coal seam had been mentioned much earlier in Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot;, but it was not mined until 1882. Around that time, coal mines were developed in the area around Harman, Bluefield, War, and Pocahontas, which together were known as the Pocahontas Coal Fields. They helped support the Industrial Revolution in the United States. The development of the coal industry in this area created a boom in the local and national economy and attracted immigrant European workers and migrant African Americans from the Deep South to the mountains in search of industrial work.

In the late 19th century, the Norfolk and Western Railway Company selected Bluefield as the site for a repair center and a major division point, which greatly stimulated the town&#x27;s growth. In the one-year period from 1887 to 1888, passenger travel along the railroad increased 317%. As with the extremely accelerated growth of San Francisco during the gold rush, Bluefield became a city that seemed to spring up &quot;overnight.&quot; Growth far outpaced the existing infrastructure. Urban sprawl and blight were common complaints in the early days, as workers crowded into aging housing.

The growth and decay of the city depended almost entirely upon Norfolk and Western Railroad. A bustling metropolis, it had a nightlife and a personality that was &quot;a little bit Chicago, a little bit New York, and a whole lot of Pittsburgh&quot;—rugged and with steel and coal embedded in its soul.

The coal boom generated a flood of money in the area. Nearby Bramwell, incorporated in 1888, boasted that it was the &quot;Millionaires&#x27; Town&quot; because more millionaires per capita lived there than anywhere in the nation. The city also had more automobiles per capita than any other city in the country. In 1889, the city of Bluefield was officially incorporated.

Bluefield headquartered the Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency who initially worked train crimes but became famous strike breakers and were prominent figures in the Coal Wars, including the Battle of Matewan.

With a strong Black community, Bluefield was the site of the 1895 founding of the Bluefield Colored Institute, an historically black college. It developed as today&#x27;s Bluefield State University. Demographics began to shift with the hiring of its first white President, Dr. Hardway, and his closing of dormitories after the 1968 bombing. It is known as &quot;The Whitest Historically Black College in America&quot;.

===20th century===

During the 1920s, the twelve-story West Virginian Hotel was built. It has been adapted and in the 21st century is operated as the West Virginia Manor and Retirement Home. In 1924, nearby Graham, Virginia decided to rename itself as Bluefield to try to unite the two towns, which had been feuding since the civil war. Nobel Prize-winning economist and mathematician John Forbes Nash was born in Bluefield in 1928. George Marshall Palmer, the well-renowned Purdue University professor of aeronautics and director of the AerospaceSciences Laboratory at Purdue, lead of the invention of the Boeing wind tunnel and a pioneer in the aerodynamic and structural testing of skyscrapers was born in Bluefield in 1921.

The Great Depression was particularly damaging to Bluefield. With the government nearly bankrupt, after a series of devastating structural fires swept through the downtown area, the city was nearly destroyed. It was not until the outbreak of World War II that coal production revived. The strategic importance of the city was so great that Adolf Hitler put Bluefield on his reputed list of German air raid targets in the United States. Air raid practice drills were common in the city during this time.

In 1964 Helen Compton opened the now-demolished Shamrock Bar, the oldest gay bar in WV.

The Interstate Highway System was constructed through East River Mountain on December 20, 1974; for the first time automobile traffic could reach the city without crossing the top of the mountain. The dependence on the railroads waned and restructuring changed the industry. Bluefield lost jobs and population as a result. Its Amtrak station closed in the 1980s. Mercer Mall, the area&#x27;s major shopping mall, opened in 1980.

==Geography==

Bluefield is located in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia across the state border from Bluefield, Virginia.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

Jazz musician Louis Jordan&#x27;s song &quot;Salt Pork, W.Va.&quot; was inspired by his time in a Bluefield jail. The song &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot; was co-written by Maceo Pinkard, a native of Bluefield.

==Sports==
Bluefield was the home of the Appalachian League (rookie) Bluefield Orioles baseball team until 2010. The Orioles have had a team in Bluefield since 1958, which was the longest relationship between a parent club and a town in affiliated baseball. The Toronto Blue Jays replaced Baltimore for the 2011 season with the Bluefield Blue Jays. The team played at Bowen Field (former Orioles stadium) through 2020. In conjunction with a contraction of Minor League Baseball beginning with the 2021 season, the Appalachian League was reorganized as a collegiate summer baseball league, and the Blue Jays were replaced by the Bluefield Ridge Runners, a new franchise in the revamped league designed for rising college freshman and sophomores.

Bluefield High School has 522 state championships in all sports, which is more than any other AA school in the state. Bluefield ranks second (tied with now-closed Ceredo-Kenova) in total football state championships with 11, behind national powerhouse Parkersburg High School (16). Bluefield won the High School State AAA Football Championship in 1959, 1962, 1965, 1967, 1975 and 1984. They won the West Virginia State AA football title in 1997, 2004, 2007, 2009 and 2017. Bluefield High School won the West Virginia AA State Championship in boys basketball in 1995, 1996, 2013 and 2014.

Bluefield is largely a football town and carries on a rivalry between the Bluefield Beavers and their sister city Bluefield, Virginia. The annual Beaver-Graham game is played at Mitchell Stadium, the home field of both schools.

Bluefield is also home to the East River Soccer Complex which has five fields and hosts local high school and college soccer games. The Southern West Virginia King&#x27;s Warriors of the USL PDL began to play their home games at the East River Soccer Complex in 2014 before dissolving in 2017.

<doc id="138513" wikidata="Q2317553" url="?curid=138513" title="Montcalm, West Virginia">
<text>Montcalm is a census-designated place (CDP) in Mercer County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 726 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Bluefield, WV-VA micropolitan area which has a population of 107,342. Residents of Montcalm are called Montcalmers.

== History ==

The first record of continuous European settlement of the Montcalm area is the 1840 census of Mercer County in what was then the state of Virginia. A 700-acre farm, located where Crane Creek joins the Bluestone, was the property of George Bailey. He, his wife, and six children lived on the farm that included a farmhouse, likely located on the lower slopes of Tabernacle Mountain, an orchard and in what would be today&#x27;s Main Street, and a field of timothy grass. About one hundred acres of corn field could be found at the top of a mountain on &quot;the opposite side of the river&quot; (either Methodist Church Hill or Browning Lambert Mountain). The farm also featured a small dam on the Crane Creek that powered a corn grist mill, the only one in the area and the farm&#x27;s most valuable property.

The Bailey family occupied this farm until 1852 when, in preparation for a move to the West, they sold their considerable estate and all of what would one day be the village of Montcalm for $1,500 to Robert Williams, a recently arrived retired sailor from the British Navy.

Williams wrote and published his experiences in Mercer County and in the events that led up to the Civil War in Kansas in a memoir published in 1908 titled &quot;With the Border Ruffians&quot;, which is the earliest narrative of life in Montcalm&#x27;s Bluestone Valley.

Williams wrote about meeting the leaders of the early Mercer County communities, a court day in Princeton, a church camp meeting in what would one day be Glenwood Park, hunting in the hills around the Bluestone, community dances and several threats to his life while homesteading on the former Bailey Farm.

After several legal disputes in which he was largely not at fault, Williams sold the farm for $2,000 to the Herndon family, a slave-holding clan who owned a neighboring farm. According to West Virginia historian Kyle McCormick, descendants of the family lived in Montcalm a century later.

According to local tradition, the name of the town that grew up around the former Bailey Farm was first identified as &quot;Riverside&quot;. As it grew with the coming of first local coal mines and then railway lines, it was decided to place a local post office in the town &quot;circa&quot; 1910. It was then discovered that there was already a town in the state having a post office with the Riverside name and it was necessary to choose a new name. Undocumented tradition states that a group of local schoolchildren, when asked to help select a new town name, selected &quot;Montcalm&quot; as they had just completed their study of the French and Indian War, wherein Louis-Joseph de Montcalm had been the commander of the French forces in North America, and they liked the name.

In 1924 an enormous rainstorm resulted in the collapse of the mountainside along Crane Creek, causing a flash flood to inundate Montcalm and its neighboring town of McComas. An explosion of a mining ash and debris dump was touched off by the storm and began a mudslide that covered the train track in fifteen feet of mud and debris. Eight people were killed in what became known as the Catastrophe of Crane Creek.

At some point in the 19th century the first formal school in the Montcalm area, known as the Mullins School, was established on Browning Lambert Mountain.

Montcalm High School was founded as a junior high in 1931 and converted to a senior high in the 1950s. A new Montcalm High School was completed in 1983.

<text>Princeton is a city in and the county seat of Mercer County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 5,872 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Bluefield micropolitan area. The city hosts the Princeton WhistlePigs baseball club of the Appalachian League.

==History==
===Early history===
Princeton was named after the Battle of Princeton in Princeton, New Jersey, where General Hugh Mercer, the namesake of Mercer County, had died. When the county was formed in 1837, William Smith donated 1.5 acres of land for the county courthouse in what would become Princeton.

Although Princeton did not see any major battles on its soil, there was the Battle of Pigeon Roost, or the Battle of Princeton Courthouse on May 17, 1862, a victory for the Confederates defending the Dublin railroad.

Princeton had been burned a couple of weeks earlier on May 1 under the command of Captain Walter Jenifer, CSA to prevent the Union army from acquiring their supplies. The town was not burned in retaliation or anger toward the residents of Princeton. According to local history, many of the residents of Princeton torched their own homes and moved on from the area. Few structures would remain after the fire. The Robert McNutt house is the only structure that remains in Princeton which, ironically, served as headquarters for the Union army at one time. Princeton and Mercer County would remain supportive of the Confederacy, and was not included in the original counties that made up the new State of Kanawha, ultimately named West Virginia.

By the end of 1865 Judge Nathaniel Harrison was appointed as circuit judge, and Princeton residents shunned him because he was a Confederate turncoat. Princeton slowly rebuilt during Reconstruction, but the railroad would eventually bring significant growth to Princeton.

===Growth of coal industry===

In Southern West Virginia, in the late 19th century, coal mining and transportation by the emerging technology of the railroads combined to form a new industry. Much of the region&#x27;s bituminous coal was sent northwest to the Great Lakes, or northeast to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s coal piers at Baltimore, or to the world&#x27;s greatest ice-free port of Hampton Roads in eastern Virginia.

Princeton&#x27;s location was east of the primary coalfields, and most of the coal mining and railroad activity was initially elsewhere. However, a combination of factors would soon change that, and have profound financial and developmental impact on Princeton.

===Railway development===
In 1896, engineer William Nelson Page developed the Loup Creek and Deepwater Railway, a logging railroad connecting a small sawmill on the old Loup Creek Estate at Robson with the C&amp;O railroad&#x27;s main line at Deepwater on the Kanawha River. In 1898, it was rechartered as the Deepwater Railway, with modest plans to extend to nearby coal mines at Glen Jean. Around 1903, the new town of Page became the location of one of the earliest stations on the expanding Deepwater Railway, as well as home of the Page Coal and Coke Company.

In 1902, William Page enlisted the support of millionaire industrialist Henry H. Rogers as a silent partner to finance the expansion of the Deepwater Railway much further, about 80 miles through Mullens to reach a N&amp;W railroad branch line at Matoaka to open up new territory with untapped deposits of high volatile bituminous coal. Page, Rogers, and other wealthy investors owned much of this land.

However, as construction of the expanded Deepwater Railway line got underway, Page found he was unsuccessful in negotiating fair rates to interchange traffic with either major railroad, nor in interesting them in buying his short line railroad. This was later revealed to be caused by collusion by the leaders of the big railroads, notably Alexander Cassatt, William Kissam Vanderbilt, and Frederick J. Kimball, who sought to control shipping rates and coal prices, and prevent any newcomers from entry. They assumed that any entrepreneurs of modest means, such as William Page appeared to be, would become discouraged and give up. In their experience, building costly enterprises such as railroads customarily meant raising large sums of money through public stock offerings and bonds.

As construction on the Deepwater Railway continued, William Page&#x27;s continued efforts to establish reasonable joint rates with the big railroads continued to prove fruitless. To the puzzlement of the leaders of the big railroads, who were unaware of Rogers&#x27; financial backing, Page (and Rogers) did not give up. Instead, they quietly expanded their plans again to build to the Virginia state line. This expansion brought right-of-way for the planned the Deepwater Railway through Mercer County and Princeton.

====Tidewater Railway====
In Virginia, Page (and Rogers) formed another intrastate railroad, the new Tidewater Railway, which was legally based in Staunton, a city located along the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O). Notwithstanding its corporate location on the C&amp;O, agents for the new Tidewater Railway quietly surveyed and secured rights-of-way many miles away from the C&amp;O across southern Virginia, roughly paralleling the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&amp;W). With the help of Rogers&#x27; fortune, they were successful, even in the City of Roanoke, where the N&amp;W had its corporate headquarters and major shops.

From Roanoke, the new line ran almost due east, missing major cities and towns, to reach Suffolk. With the help of local leaders in Norfolk, (and more funds from Rogers), a route was obtained set which passed around the City of Norfolk (and the N&amp;W) in a wide, 13-mile long circular path through rural Norfolk County to be headed almost due west again when it reached the site for a new coal pier on the harbor at Hampton Roads at Sewell&#x27;s Point.

By the time the leaders of the big railroads finally realized that the Deepwater and Tidewater railroads were related, the rights-of-way were secure, and the new competitor could not be blocked. In 1906, N&amp;W president Lucius E. Johnson was brought to the Standard Oil building at 26 Broadway in New York City by Andrew Carnegie to meet with one of Carnegie&#x27;s old friends: Henry Huttleston Rogers. N&amp;W corporate records only record that the meeting lasted only a few minutes. Thus, the leaders of the big railroads finally learned the source of William Nelson Page&#x27;s deep pockets. Despite their collusion, there would be new player in their games.

====Virginian Railway growth and decline====
In 1907, the Deepwater and Tidewater were combined to become the Virginian Railway (VGN). Victoria, a new town created in Lunenburg County, Virginia, became the Division Headquarters east of Roanoke. Using more modern techniques than had been available to the older major railroads during the 19th century, and the Rogers fortune to build to the highest standards and acquire the finest equipment and rolling stock, it was widely considered an engineering marvel of the times when completed all the way from Deepwater to reach a port near Norfolk, Virginia on Hampton Roads in 1909, a distance of about .Princeton was designated to be the headquarters of the New River Division, extending from Roanoke westward.

The changes from steam to diesel-electric motive power and the mergers and consolidations resulted in elimination of many shops and jobs, aggravated by a reduction in coal mining activity in West Virginia. Eventually, all but a few of these jobs in Princeton were eliminated by the late 20th century. The Norfolk and Western Railroad maintained coal piers and export facilities at a major facility near downtown Norfolk known as Lambert&#x27;s Point. After the 1959 merger, the VGN&#x27;s former coal piers and yards at Sewell&#x27;s Point were redundant with the Lambert&#x27;s Point operations. They were eventually shut down, and the land became part of the massive U.S. Naval Station Norfolk, the largest Navy base in the world.

Most of the unused former VGN Princeton Shops facilities were demolished by 2006. The local residents of Princeton were devastated. However, despite the community&#x27;s loss, a new replica of the VGN&#x27;s two-story Princeton Passenger Station and Offices had been recently built, the largest such effort in the entire state. A modern structure functionally, while appearing like the original built 100 about years earlier, the new Princeton Station Museum should last for future generations. It hosts a museum to the town&#x27;s rich railroading heritage and the Virginian Railway.

== History ==
=== Earliest inhabitants ===
Native Americans were known to have made many incursions into the Patterson Creek Valley in which nestles the quiet village of Fort Ashby. Shawnee warriors claimed sections of the lower valley as choice camping grounds on which they stopped and rested in going to and from their great hunts.

There are at least two distinctly well defined Native American trails leading into the community. One, from the North Branch Potomac River, across the mountain into Short Gap, also used later by George Washington when crossing the mountains, and the other coming in from Dan&#x27;s Run over Valley Ridge.

There are many Native American graves around Fort Ashby in different places where small skirmishes are supposed to have taken place. Native Americans first interred in what is now the Fort Ashby Community Cemetery, or somewhere near. There is scarcely a spot in the community outside the immediate village where some visible trace of the Native American has not been found, and in several places within the limits of the community, darts and arrowheads can be picked up in small quantities.

Native American activities in Fort Ashby seem to have been centered against the early white settlers. Tribal differences of various natures seem to have been few and easily settled so that the combined efforts of all was directed toward keeping out the &#x27;pale face&#x27; who was ruining the hunting ground.

All during the period of agitation between the French and Indian and American Revolutionary Wars the families of Frankfort, as it was then referred, seem to have been jeopardized by the French and Native Americans from the Ohio River Valley.

=== 18th century ===
The first fort at the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers was built by men from Hampshire County, West Virginia. Part of these men came from the Frankfort District along Patterson Creek, likely Frankfort, as it was more thickly settled than any other section at that time. Captain William Trent was in command of the company. He did not finish the fort, however, as the French captured it before completion and named it Fort Duquesne.

Colonel Joshua Fry took command of part of Trent&#x27;s men and came back with them east of Uniontown, Pennsylvania, where they started to build Fort Necessity. After Frye died during the construction, George Washington finished the fort.

About the year 1755 or 1756, the old Native American Chief Killbuck with his warriors from Muskingum River Valley, Ohio, came across the Allegheny Mountains and attacked the settlers in Patterson Creek Valley. It was on this expedition that Killbuck became prominent by his bloody murder of Williams and Wendell Miller. The carrying away of John Casey also occurred at the same time.

In 1755, Colonel George Washington gave orders to build a stockade and fort on the eastern side of Patterson Creek. This was built at the present site of Fort Ashby village and it is now a museum run by Friends of Ashby&#x27;s Fort. Initially, the fort had a garrison of sixty men.

On Christmas Day 1755, Captain Charles Lewis of Fredericksburg took command of the fort and a garrison of twenty-one men. He had orders from Colonel Washington to remain quiet as long as he could and to hold the fort as long as possible, but if necessary rather than surrender it to burn it and try to get to Fort Sellars, located on the east side of the mouth of Patterson Creek, or to Fort Cumberland.

In 1756, Washington ordered Colonel Adam Stephen at Fort Cumberland to keep forts Ashby and Sellars completely supplied with food and ammunition. The only really important battle at Fort Ashby occurred in 1756 when Lieutenant Robert Rutherford and his company of rangers was defeated there by a band of French and Native Americans. After the French had gone from the vicinity the Native Americans remained watching for the inmates of the fort. It was during this siege that Colonel John Ashby, while out of the fort on what is now Cemetery Hill was attacked by the Native Americans and made a most remarkable escape to the fort. It is from this incident that the name of &quot;Ashby&#x27;s Fort&quot; was applied. Colonel Ashby was later put in command of the fort and seems to have remained there until the Revolutionary War or after.

On April 22, 1756, Washington wrote to Ashby that if he was attacked by Native Americans to wait for the cover of darkness then blow up the fort and retreat to Fort Cumberland, taking what ammunition they could.

In the same year he wrote to Lieutenant Governor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia as follows: &quot;The people are all leaving the section around Frankfort in fear of the Indians and fear that in a short time it will be as desolate as all Hampshire County.&quot; Since there is a lapse of about two years for which no records of any kind have been found it is presumed that practically all settlers were driven out of what is now Mineral County except those who were protected by forts Ashby and Sellars.

In a later letter to Lieutenant Governor Dinwiddie, Washington said: &quot;The men I hired to bring intelligence from the South Branch returned last night with letters from Captain Ashby and other parties there. The Indians have gone. It is believed their numbers were, about one hundred and fifty, that about seventy men are killed or missing and that several houses and plantations were destroyed. I shall proceed by quick marches to Fort Cumberland to strengthen the garrison there. Besides this I think it is absolutely necessary to have two or three companies of rangers to guard the Potomac waters. Captain Wagner informs me that it was with difficulty that he passed the Blue Ridge as crowds of people were fleeing as if a lost moment would mean death. He endeavored to stop them, but in vain, as they believed that all homes were in flames.&quot; Captain Wagner was a citizen of Frankfort.

It is really a question as to whether or not the first settlers of Frankfort community may have laid claim to the land of that immediate vicinity even before the Native Americans became much interested in it. It is known that white settlers came into the Patterson Creek Valley around Frankfort between the years 1732 and 1736. The names of Casey, Pancake, Foreman, and Van Meter were familiar before the prominence of George Washington. Following the grant of land, from the British Crown to Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron known as the Northern Neck of Virginia, some settlers may have come to Frankfort as renters. Before Washington&#x27;s survey, however, the immediate land around the village had been taken by people on the grounds of the Tomahawk Claim.

In his journals of &quot;My Journeys Across the Mountain,&quot; Washington said that he stayed all night on March 28, 1748, with Abram Johnson on Patterson Creek, and on the following day, marched to one Solomon Hedges, and when he came to supper, on the table was neither cloth, nor knife, nor fork. Abram Johnson lived a short distance south of Frankfort village.

Up until the time of the American Revolutionary War there does not seem to have been very many new families moving into the lower part of the Valley. The Johnsons and Van Meters seem to have been the leading citizens and largest land owners. Just about the beginning of the War, however, new names became prominent in the community; among them are Tay-lor, Lynn, Williams, and Powell.

We find that history records very little about Frankfort with regard to the American Revolutionary War. That entire section of country bordering on the Potomac and Monongahela rivers was known as the back door of the Revolution. Frankfort was right in the heart of this section. The reason why we see so little mentioned from this section of Virginia in the story of the Revolution is that the men were kept busy watching the Indians.

In 1777, Captain William Foreman gathered together from Hampshire County a company of men to keep down the Native Americans who had been agitated by the British. He marched with them to Wheeling and there met the Native Americans at the McMechen Narrows where he was defeated. A monument now marks the spot where Foreman&#x27;s defeat occurred on WV 28 between Springfield and Romney. Men from Frankfort who were in Foreman&#x27;s Company were Samuel Johnson, John Willison, and William Lynn.

Captain Michael Cresap who lived in Oldtown, Maryland across from Green Spring, came over into Hampshire County during the early part of the Revolution and organized a company of riflemen. They marched to Boston and featured in several small skirmishes there. Cressap returned with them as far as New York where he died and was buried. The men in this company from Frankfort include the names of Johnson, Ashby, Wagoner, Williams, Powell, Pew, Harris, and Miller. Cresaptown, Maryland is named for him.

Immediately after the close of the war, Frankfort seems to have developed rapidly. Many new settlers came, including the names of Keller, Richards, Brockhart, and Daniels. It was about this time that the brick house now occupied by Mrs. Blanche Welker and also the old stone hotel were built. Both buildings were used as hotels, replacing the old roadhouse which was located near where Charles Pyles now lives, and the tavern at Short Gap, to some extent.

=== Establishment of Frankfort ===
Through the influence of several men of the village, particularly Dennis Daniels, one hundred and thirty-nine acres of land belonging to John Kellar was surveyed into town lots with streets and alleys running between. A charter was passed through the Virginia General Assembly on December 5, 1787, a copy of which follows:

1. Be it enacted by the general assembly, that one hundred and thirty-nine acres of land, in the county of Hampshire, the property of John Kellar, and laid off by him into in and out lots, with convenient streets, shall be, and the same is hereby established, a town by the name of Frankfort, and that John Mitchell, Andrew Cooper, Ralph Humphries, John Williams, Sen. James Clark, Richard Stafford, Hezekiah Whiteman, and Jacob Brookhart, gentlemen, be trustees thereof, who, or the major part of them, shall have power, from time to time, to settle and determine all disputes concerning the bounds of said lots, and to establish such rules and regulations for the regular building of houses thereon, as to them shall seem best. In case of the death, resignation, removal out of the county, or other legal disability of one or more of the said trustees, it shall be lawful for the remaining trustees, to supply such vacancy, and the person so chosen shall have the same power as if he had been particularly named in this act.

2. And be it further enacted, that so many of the lots in the said town as are not sold by the said John Kellar are hereby vested in the said trustees, and they, or a majority of them, shall within six months after the passing of this act, sell the lots at public auction, having previously advertised the time and place of such sale at the court house of said county, on three successive court days, and convey the same to the purchaser in fee, subject to the conditions of building a house on each, sixteen feet square, with a brick or stone chimney, to be finished fit for habitation within three years from the date of sale, and pay the money arising from such sale to the said John Kellar, or his legal representatives. So soon as the purchaser of said lots shall have built thereon according to their respective deeds of conveyance, they shall then be entitled to, and have and enjoy all the rights, privileges, and immunities, which the freeholder and inhabitants of other towns in this state, not incorporated, hold and enjoy. If the purchaser of any lot sold by the said trustees shall fail to build thereon within the time limited, it shall be lawful for the said trustees, or a majority of them, to enter into such lot, sell the same again, and apply the money for the benefit of the inhabitants of the said town.

=== Early commerce ===
Some of the lots were sold and built upon according to the provisions of the charter. Many were not sold in the time provided but later were sold at public auction under a deed of trust. They were bought by Joseph Inskeep who still had hopes that the city of Frankfort would mature. Inskeep was so strong in his belief that he donated four lots in the center of the village to be used for the good of the public when the city did develop. This tract is known today, as the Public Square.

From the time of the establishment of the town of Frankfort for many years this was the trading center of the entire country side. Before the completion of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Frankfort was on the direct route from Winchester to Wheeling over which hundreds of tons of merchandise passed monthly. It was the long wagon trains passing over this route that furnished business for two hotels in Frankfort. Many times has the Public Square been crowded overnight with canvas covered wagons loaded with valuable merchandise.

Samuel Brady was probably the first merchant of any importance in Frankfort. He operated a large chain of stores, one of which was located here years before the American Civil War. It is said that almost any article asked for could be bought there. People are known to have traded with him regularly from Keyser and above and also from what is now Ridgeley when the North Branch Potomac River could not be forded to Cumberland.

<text>Keyser () is a city in and the county seat of Mineral County, West Virginia. It is part of the Cumberland, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 4,853 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

Keyser, the county seat of Mineral County, is located on the North Branch of the Potomac River at its juncture with New Creek in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia. Throughout the centuries, the town went through a series of name changes, but was ultimately named after William Keyser, a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad official.

The first local land grant was issued by Lord Fairfax to Christopher Beelor on March 20, 1752. The place was first called Paddy Town, for Patrick McCarty, an Irish immigrant who came to then-Hampshire County, Virginia, sometime after 1740. Eventually, a community developed, which was also known as &quot;the Irish Settlement.&quot; Initially a peaceful village, Paddy Town came under repeated attacks by Native Americans after French and Indian forces defeated Major General Edward Braddock west of Paddy Town in 1755. Patrick McCarty&#x27;s son, Edward McCarty, built an iron furnace and foundry and a salt well, near present-day Armstrong Street.

In the early 19th century, the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (C&amp;O Canal) was constructed alongside the Potomac, from Washington, DC, to Cumberland, Maryland. Originally planned to reach the Ohio River, the canal never reached Paddy Town; after being overtaken by the railroad, the canal stopped as far west as Cumberland. By 1844, Paddy Town fell into decline, which reversed when the town received an economic boost in 1852 when the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, in search of a path through the Alleghenies, arrived. Sometime between 1855 and the start of the Civil War, the townsfolk renamed the village New Creek Station, after the creek that runs by it.

In 1861, the American Civil War came to New Creek Station in then-Hampshire County, Virginia, when the Union established Fort Fuller. The railroad that had been a blessing to the town had turned into a curse, drawing repeated assaults by Confederate forces. Because of its geography, a relatively flat plain in a valley surrounded by mountains and open to many approaches, New Creek was an easy target for Confederates. The area changed hands 14 times during the war due to the importance of the railroad. Complete disaster finally visited New Creek on November 28, 1864, when Fort Fuller was overcome; the Confederates then took over the town, destroying the earthworks and nearly all the buildings. A smaller Confederate force was then sent to Piedmont, where they managed to burn the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s roundhouse, a workshop, and other machinery before they were turned away by Company A Sixth West Virginia Volunteers.

Following the war, the state legislature sent the Hampshire County seat back to Romney and split this northern half away to form Mineral County in 1866, eventually settling on New Creek to become the county seat, with the courthouse completed in 1868. In 1874, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad was looking for a place to set up division headquarters. Thus, on November 16, 1874, the town of Keyser was incorporated, named after William Keyser then the first vice president of the railroad, living in nearby Garrett County, Maryland, and in charge of the headquarters location division. In addition to the headquarters, the renamed town of Keyser received repair shops and a roundhouse, lifting employment and economic activity. Keyser played an early and prominent role in the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, attracting the attention of national news and the involvement of Federal authorities.

Keyser&#x27;s growth accelerated in the 1880s, with the end of the Long Depression, through the turn of the century. Infrastructure improvements attracted more industry, and Keyser&#x27;s private sector began to diversify beyond its sometimes problematic dominant employer, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio. Besides the B&amp;O, railroad workers were now employed by the Western Maryland Railroad and the West Virginia Central Railroad. On February 3, 1913, the West Virginia legislature granted Keyser a charter designating it the &quot;City of Keyser&quot; (though the name was nearly changed during WWI due to the connotations of its pronunciation as &quot;kaiser&quot;). In 1924, Keyser experienced massive flooding of the Potomac River, which brought widespread damage to homes and businesses.

In the 20th century, Keyser&#x27;s economy relied heavily on manufacturing and the railroad. While after WWII, Keyser experienced another boom in industry, the town was hit hard by the economic crises of the 1970s and early 1980s, resulting in numerous industrial closures. Although Keyser&#x27;s fortunes were generally tied to the national economy through the centuries, the town did not experience the 1990s economic boom in the same way as other parts of the country. Since losing much of its manufacturing base, the town found employment via health care, education, and service jobs. Potomac State College has continued to develop and is associated with West Virginia University.

The Thomas R. Carskadon House and Mineral County Courthouse are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. It is situated in a valley on the south side of the North Branch of the Potomac River at its junction with New Creek. New Creek forms most of the eastern boundary of the town. On the immediate eastern bank of New Creek is New Creek Mountain, peaking at 1,552 feet above sea level on the eastern side of Keyser (though the long mountain itself has higher peaks far south of Keyser). On Keyser&#x27;s western edge is the Allegheny Front, rising 2,631 feet above sea level at this point along its range. The northern edge of Keyser is bounded by the North Branch of the Potomac River. Immediately across the river, in McCoole, Maryland, another portion of the New Creek Mountain ridge features a massive outcropping of Oriskany or Ridgeley sandstone known as Queens Point, a popular cliff from which to take in views of Keyser. The cliff is approximately 400 feet above the river. The southern edge of Keyser is not bound by geology, as the valley here stretches farther south than the city limits. Beyond its southern limits is the unincorporated community of New Creek.

Today, Keyser&#x27;s western horizon is dotted with wind turbines. The NedPower Mount Storm Wind Farm began construction in 2006, installing 132 wind turbines atop the Allegheny Front, many of them overlooking Keyser. Eventually, the wind farm reached 162 turbines, making it the largest east of the Mississippi.

Keyser&#x27;s oldest section is its downtown with the 1868 courthouse and two main commercial streets: Main and Armstrong. Armstrong runs parallel to the CSX (formerly B&amp;O) railroad tracks, across which is a neighborhood known as the North End, sandwiched between the tracks and the river, where homes were constructed beginning in the late 1910s. Not far from downtown is Fort Hill, a small hill in the center of the city crowned with the campus of Potomac State College. The south end of Keyser features a relatively newer neighborhood, on the west side of U.S. Route 220, with most of the homes built in the 1960s and 1970s, known as Airport Addition, as it was once the site of a small airfield. An area sandwiched between Airport Addition and Potomac State College is known as &quot;Radical Hill,&quot; which was the name of Thomas Carskadon&#x27;s farm in the same location, so named by Carskadon because of his self-described radical opinions. The most recent commercial development for the city has been south of the city, where shopping centers, a hotel, the new high school, and the new hospital have been constructed in recent years.

The main thoroughfares for the city are U.S. Route 220 and West Virginia Route 46. U.S. Route 220 eventually intersects with U.S. Route 50 south of Keyser. At its north end, 220 crosses the Potomac via the newly reconstructed Memorial Bridge, heading toward Cumberland, Maryland. West Virginia Route 46 enters the east side of Keyser from the direction of Fort Ashby, West Virginia, becoming Armstrong Street and then West Piedmont Street before continuing on to Piedmont, West Virginia.

===Geology===
The type locality of the Silurian/Devonian Keyser Formation, a limestone, is located in a quarry and roadcut east of the town.

==Transportation==

Keyser is served by two primary highways. The most prominent of these is U.S. Route 220. From Keyser, US 220 heads north, crosses the North Branch Potomac River into Allegany County, Maryland, and continues to Cumberland and points north. Heading south, US 220 heads through Moorefield and Petersburg before crossing into Virginia. The other primary highway serving Keyser is West Virginia Route 46. From Keyser, WV 46 heads west to Piedmont and Elk Garden while to the east, WV 46 extends to Fort Ashby.

== Government ==
Keyser&#x27;s government is headed by a mayor and five-member city council. Each serves four-year, staggered terms. The mayor and two council members are elected at one election, with the remaining three council members elected two years later. Elections are held on the second Tuesday in June of even-numbered years. Originally, terms were only two years long, with staggered terms and elections held every June.

Two of Keyser&#x27;s longest serving mayors were John C. Freeland (1894–1967) and Irving T. Athey (1922–1997). Except for a two-year break in the 1950s due to a reelection defeat, Freeland served as mayor from 1937 until 1957. Athey was first elected in 1973 and had stints as mayor until health problems forced him to resign in 1990.

== Economy ==
As of 2016, approximately 11 percent of Keyser&#x27;s workers were employed in manufacturing jobs in or around Keyser. Another 20 percent worked in health care or personal care and service. A little less than 20 percent worked in sales and food service. About 17 percent worked in a combination of education, training, administrative, and social service. The remainder of the workforce was spread across trucking, management, maintenance and repair, and other industries. The poverty rate in Keyser was 27.4 percent. Its median household income was $28,378.

Among the largest companies employing Keyser residents are:

<doc id="138520" wikidata="Q22713" url="?curid=138520" title="Piedmont, West Virginia">
<text>Piedmont is a town in Mineral County, West Virginia, United States. It is part of the Cumberland, MD-WV metropolitan statistical area. The population was 716 at the 2020 census. Piedmont was chartered in 1856 and the town is the subject of &quot;Colored People: A Memoir&quot; by Piedmont native Henry Louis Gates Jr.

== Geography ==
As its name suggests, Piedmont is located at the base of a mountain, in this instance the foot of the Allegheny Front, the eastern edge of the Allegheny Mountains or Appalachian Plateau, on the south (West Virginia) side of the North Branch of the Potomac River.

Piedmont is located at (39.480232, -79.048086). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==Transportation==

The only significant highway directly serving Piedmont is West Virginia Route 46. Route 46 continues west across the North Branch Potomac River into Westernport, Maryland. To the east, Route 46 heads to Keyser, where it has a junction with U.S. Route 220.

== History ==
The Town of Piedmont is situated in the Allegheny Front mountain range along the North Branch of the Potomac River. A century prior to the chartering of Piedmont, the area was opened for European settlement with the creation of Hampshire County in 1754 by the colonial government in Virginia. The region was the scene of hostile interactions between European settlers and pro-French Native Americans during the French and Indian War. Owing to its location and natural resources, the Piedmont area attracted German, Scotch-Irish, Swiss, English, and Italian immigrants, making the region more diverse than the primarily English-American Hampshire County. These cultural differences within the county, as well as growing population in the years leading up to the Civil War would later contribute to the formation of a new county.

The village of Piedmont was settled by people seeking to extract coal from the Allegheny Front mountain range which extends for several miles to the south of the town. Its strategic location at the intersection of George&#x27;s Creek Valley, an industrial center in neighboring Maryland, made Piedmont a desirable location for a depot on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad as it pushed west on its route to Wheeling and the Ohio River. The original main line of the B&amp;O railroad reached the site of Piedmont on July 21, 1851. Two years later in 1853, the railroad reached the Ohio River at Wheeling, connecting Baltimore, Maryland with a direct route leading to the rapidly-growing Northwest Territory states. The line through Piedmont remains a segment of the B&amp;O system, now part of CSX Transportation.

With the arrival of the B&amp;O and the building of a roundhouse and rail yard, the Town of Piedmont was chartered in 1856. During the American Civil War (1861–1865), the town of Piedmont was frequently raided by the McNeill&#x27;s Rangers in an effort by the Confederates to disrupt B&amp;O train service. Despite the interruption of the war, the region continued to develop new industrial and commercial institutions, leading to the creation of Mineral County in 1866 (separated from Hampshire County). Along with neighboring Grant County, these two new counties were the first created in the state of West Virginia which itself was separated from Virginia in 1863. In 1888, William Luke established the West Virginia Paper Company (now Verso Luke Mill) on of Maryland land known as West Piedmont (now Luke, Maryland, adjacent to the larger town of Westernport, Maryland), fueling further development of the region.

Notable residents of Piedmont have included U.S. Senator Henry Gassaway Davis who worked as a storekeeper and railroad agent before opening the region&#x27;s largest coal mines on the &quot;Big Vein&quot; on the Allegheny Front. Leslie Thrasher, a noted illustrator whose work was featured on the covers of Liberty magazine and the Saturday Evening Post was born in Piedmont on September 15, 1889. Jazz musician and composer Don Redman was born in Piedmont on July 29, 1900. Henry Louis Gates, a professor of African-American history at Harvard University, was raised in Piedmont, an experience he described in his 1994 book &quot;Colored People&quot;. Steve Whiteman, lead singer for the glam/rock band Kix was raised in Piedmont and graduated from Piedmont High School.

<text>Ridgeley is a town in Mineral County, West Virginia, United States, and part of the Cumberland Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 590 at the 2020 census.

Ridgeley was initially known as St. Clairsville, named for Sir John St Clair, Lt Colonel and Quartermaster General for the British General Edward Braddock. St Clair accompanied Braddock on his ill-fated march on Fort Duquesne and his disastrous defeat on July 9, 1755. It was incorporated as Ridgeley on November 28, 1914, named for the former owners of the land upon which the town was built.

==Education==
Ridgeley is within the Mineral County Schools district. Frankfort High School is located near Short Gap and contains the grades 9–12.

==History==
The land on which the town is built was originally conveyed from Thomas Lord Fairfax to George Mason in 1749. In 1750, the first frontier fort, Fort Ohio, was built at Ridgeley. It was, at the time, the westernmost outpost of colonial civilization and was most commonly referred to as the &quot;New Store&quot; settlement at the time. The New Store was primarily a trading post created by the Ohio Company which included prominent members including George Mason and Lawrence Washington. Christopher Gist was in charge of construction of &quot;New Store&quot; which was just over what is now the Blue Bridge leading into Ridgeley from Cumberland. The settlement was used as a headquarters for traders and trappers from 1750 and 1763, and also served as a local fort outpost to shelter travelers or workers in the event of an Indian attack. Early Ohio Company residents who worked at the settlement (and who explored the surrounding countryside) included Hugh Parker and Christopher Gist. According to a history of the time, there were no white settlers in the area at this point. Lowdermilk&#x27;s 1878 history reflects that at this point, the area was on the very outside of civilization; in fact, Lowdermilk refers to it as the &quot;very outskirts of civilization. The country beyond was an unbroken and almost pathless wilderness. It was separated by many miles of tortuous mountain roads from the settlements in the east&quot;.

In May 1754, George Washington led a company of troops to meet Joshua Fry at the storehouses at Fort Ohio. Fry was a colonel and commander in the Virginia Militia. He was to take command of the forces sent to the frontier. Fry was thrown from his horse on the way to the fort and died. Washington&#x27;s notes reflected that Fry was carefully tended to but died, and was buried &quot;on the hill&quot;, which is what the area around Fort Ohio (now Ridgeley) was referred to at that time. Washington then took command of the troops, his first military command. Washington staged an attack from Fort Ohio against a French detachment of 40 men that resulted in the death of French diplomat Ensign Joseph Coulon de Jumonville, who had been alleged to be a spy. De Jumonville&#x27;s brother in law confronted Washington, who eventually signed a document asserting that he had &quot;assassinated&quot; du Jumonville. The document was in French, which Washington could not read; eventually Washington stated that he had signed the document to get himself and his troops safely released and out of the terrible weather. The killing of du Jumonville is considered to have been the first shot fired in the French and Indian War.

In spring 1755, Washington returned to the area to prepare for General Edward Braddock&#x27;s attack on Fort Duquesne (commonly referred to as Braddock&#x27;s March). Fort Cumberland was under construction at the time, and was used as the center of planning for the attack, while Fort Ohio was commandeered and used as well. Both a young Daniel Boone (age 21) and Daniel Morgan (age 20) worked in the area to plan and carry out the ill-fated assault.

When Fort Cumberland was all but abandoned in 1763, the Ohio Company reclaimed the land and put it up for sale. Eventually, the land was conveyed to James McCubbin Lingan in 1785, then to Captain George Calmes in 1803. Calmes built a mansion on the property. The land and home passed down through George Calmes&#x27; family through most of the 1800s. Late in that century, portions of the town began to be subdivided for housing and business use. In 1905, a group leased the Calmes Mansion and created the Potomac Club, which operated in Ridgeley as an important tennis and boating club until 1919.

In 1887, the West Virginia Central and Pittsburg Railway built yards and tracks in Ridgeley. In 1904, the West Virginia Central became the Western Maryland Railroad. The town developed as a blue collar community, many of whose residents worked for the railroad. For most of its history, it had been called alternately &quot;St. Clairsville&quot; or &quot;Sinclairsville,&quot; but upon incorporation in 1914, it was renamed Ridgeley after Charles Ridgeley (1822–1897) a prominent early resident and businessman.

The town grew throughout the early part of the 20th century to be a vibrant blue-collar community of schools, churches and businesses. Serious flooding from the Potomac River was a challenge to the town until the Army Corps of Engineers completed a major flood control project in the 1950s. During the 1970s and 1980s, as the Mineral County Schools system consolidated schools in the area, all the in town schools were closed, challenging Ridgeley&#x27;s cohesiveness as a community.

In May 2013 Ridgeley mayor James L. Twigg was indicted on eight felony charges in connection with the alleged misuse of the city&#x27;s purchasing card. He pleaded guilty that October to four misdemeanor counts of failing to perform his duties.

<text>Delbarton is a town in Mingo County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 522 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Delbarton was incorporated September 6, 1946, by the Mingo County Circuit Court.

The name Delbarton comes from the New Jersey country estate of Luther Kountze, a Wall Street financier and part owner of the United Thacker Land Company, a large coal mining company. Currently a Catholic high school with the same moniker, the Delbarton School, is located on this site. The estate and town and school all derive their name from a portmanteau of syllables in the names of Kountze&#x27;s three children (DELancey, BARclay and LivingsTON).

Prior to being incorporated as a town, Delbarton was a coal camp built and owned by the Thacker company. Thacker needed such camps; soon after, in 1909, acting for the company, Luther Kountze arranged the purchase of thousands of acres in the area from Jane Hatfield, a woman widowed by the murder of her husband, Ellison Hatfield in the famed Hatfield-McCoy Feud. Jane required money for herself and her children and sold cheaply, unaware of the fantastic mineral wealth she was losing out on. After this acquisition of land Delbarton, was created for the needed miners who were recruited and brought in to work the soon to be opened coal mines.

The town is located in the heart of the richest coal area of the state, the Williamson Coalfield.

Poverty is endemic in the town of Delbarton, as it is in Mingo County where it is located. US Census Bureau estimates as of 2018 put the residents living below the poverty line percentages at 36.5% for Delbarton and 28.7% for Mingo County. These rates compare to 17.8% for West Virginia and 15% for the USA overall. Economists attribute the most significant cause of this high level of poverty to be the drastic decline in the number of jobs in the local coal mining industry. The loss of such employment which has been going on for several decades is blamed on two factors: the reduction in the amount of coal being extracted in the area and the ever increasing use of less labor intensive removal methods for what coal is still mined.

Some commercial buildings in town, no longer needed for their original purposes of retail or mining administration, are now used to cater to the growing tourist industry.

==History==
&quot;Mate Creek Post Office&quot; was established on February 18, 1875. Early postmasters included Joseph Murphy (February 18, 1875) and Elias Hatfield (January 13, 1882). The latter was a brother to William Anderson &quot;Devil Anse&quot; Hatfield, father to future West Virginia governor Henry Drury Hatfield, and participant in the Hatfield-McCoy Feud.

By 1885, Mate Creek PO was discontinued and replaced by &quot;Sidney Post Office&quot;. Elliot Rutherford, a Logan County sheriff, was postmaster beginning on September 3, 1885.
In 1890, Erskine Hazard, a civil engineer from the Norfolk and Western Railway, laid out the town and drafted the first map of the community. The town was named after Matteawan (now called Beacon), a town in Dutchess County, Upstate New York. Local residents, however, changed the spelling and pronunciation. Early postmasters for Matewan included Elliot Rutherford (January 13, 1893), George R. Buskirk (May 1, 1894), George Bonzo (May 17, 1897), Mary White (December 23, 1904), A.L. Hatfield (January 26, 1915), Emma Chafin (August 2, 1921), Mary White (November 17, 1921), and Neville L. Chancey (June 20, 1930).

Attempts to unionize by coal miners in 1920 led to the Battle of Matewan between miners and Baldwin-Felts detectives, which was the inspiration for the 1987 movie &quot;Matewan&quot;. The town&#x27;s history is on display at the Matewan Depot, which includes a small museum. The West Virginia Mine Wars Museum, housed in a building owned by the United Mine Workers of America, provides history for the mine wars.

==Notable people==
* Sam Church, labor union leader
* John Hendricks, founder and former chairman of Discovery Communications; founder of CuriosityStream
* Sid Hatfield, police chief, famous for supporting miners in the Matewan Massacre

==Attractions==
Because of its rich history (Hatfield-McCoy feud and Matewan Massacre), the center of the town was designated the Matewan Historic District, a National Historic Landmark. Interesting sights and tours can be had while visiting the town.

The Hatfield-McCoy Trails opened a trail head in Matewan. Trail Riders can now easily access the trail system while staying in town.

<text>Williamson is a city in and the county seat of Mingo County, West Virginia, United States, situated along the Tug Fork River. The population was 3,042 at the 2020 census. and is the county&#x27;s largest and most populous city. Williamson is home to Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College. The Tug Fork River separates Williamson from South Williamson, Kentucky.

Williamson is the site of a large rail yard built by the former Norfolk and Western Railroad (now Norfolk Southern Railway), which was built to service the many coal mines of the region. The city is protected by a floodwall, completed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1991 in response to devastating floods along the Tug Fork River in 1977 and again in 1984. The wall incorporates floodgates along major access points which, when locked, form a solid barrier against floodwaters. There have only been two uses of the gates thus far: the first occurring in 2002 during a major flood in the region, and the second occurring in 2003, when only two lower lying gates were closed in anticipation of rising water levels.

The local economy is largely fueled by coal mining, transportation, health care and retail businesses.

<text>Morgantown is a city in and the county seat of Monongalia County, West Virginia, United States, situated along the Monongahela River. The most populous city in North Central West Virginia and the third-most populous city in the state, Morgantown is best known as the home of West Virginia University. The population was 30,347 at the 2020 census. The city serves as the anchor of the Morgantown metropolitan area, which had a population of 138,176 in 2020.

==History==

Morgantown&#x27;s history is closely tied to the Anglo-French struggle for this territory. Until the Treaty of Paris in 1763, what is now known as Morgantown was greatly contested by white settlers and Native Americans, and by British and French soldiers. The treaty decided the issue in favor of the British, but Indian fighting continued almost to the beginning of the American Revolutionary War in 1775.

Zackquill Morgan and David Morgan, sons of Morgan Morgan, entered the area of Virginia that would become Morgantown around 1767, although others, such as Thomas Decker, were recorded as attempting to settle in the area a decade earlier. Zackquill and David lived here for a few years and eventually built Fort Morgan in present-day Downtown Morgantown in 1772. Several forts were built in the area during this time: Fort Pierpont near the Cheat River, in 1769; Fort Coburn, near Dorsey&#x27;s Knob, in 1770. Fort Morgan, at the present site of Morgantown, in 1772; Fort Dinwiddie, north several miles at Stewartstown, in 1772; Fort Martin, several miles north on the Monongahela River, in 1773; Fort Burris in the present-day Suncrest area of Morgantown, in 1774; and Fort Kern in the present-day Greenmont area of Morgantown, in 1774, in addition to other, smaller forts.

Zackquill Morgan settled the area about 1772 by establishing a homestead near present-day Fayette Street and University Avenue. Morgan fought in both the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War, rising to the rank of colonel. By 1783, following his wartime duties, Colonel Morgan commissioned Major William Haymond to survey his land and divide it into streets and lots. Colonel Morgan then received a legal certificate for in the area of his settlement near the mouth of Decker&#x27;s Creek. were appropriated for Morgan&#x27;s Town by the Virginia General Assembly in October 1785. On February 3, 1838, the Virginia General Assembly enacted a municipal charter incorporating the city, now with a population of about 700, as Morgantown, Virginia. The town became part of the newly created state of West Virginia on June 20, 1863, through the Reorganized Government of Virginia.
Notable early structures still standing in Morgantown, include the Old Stone House, built in 1795 by Jacob Nuce on Long Alley (the modern-day Chestnut Street) and the John Rogers family home on Foundry Street, built in 1840 and occupied as of 2011 by the Dering Funeral Home.

During the 1970s, the U.S. Department of Transportation built an experimental driverless personal rapid transit system in the city, citing the area&#x27;s variable seasonal climate and geographic elevations as factors in testing the technology&#x27;s viability. The Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) has been in use since 1975. University students use the system for travel between the campuses.

==Geography==

Morgantown is south of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, west-northwest of Washington, D.C., east of Marietta, Ohio, and northeast of Charleston. Morgantown is just south of the Mason–Dixon line.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Neighborhoods===

Morgantown is made up of several neighborhoods, some of which had been independent towns that were annexed by the city as it continued to grow. Neighborhoods include First Ward, Woodburn, South Park, Jerome Park, South Hills, Second Ward, Greenmont, Suncrest, Evansdale, Wiles Hill, Sunnyside, Sabraton, the Mileground, and North Hills. While some of these, such as the Mileground, Easton, and Sabraton, are in part or entirely outside the city limits, they are still considered part of Morgantown. The City of Morgantown contained just over 30,000 permanent residents in 2020. The city is host to about 30,000 students at West Virginia University.

Sunnyside, just north of downtown Morgantown, is an older neighborhood adjacent to West Virginia University&#x27;s downtown campus. The neighborhood is bounded by University Avenue to the east and Campus Drive to the south. Close to the downtown campus of West Virginia University and for decades known as a neighborhood of student housing, is also the scene of many off-campus parties and post-game celebrations including, until 1995, the unsanctioned annual back-to-school block party that would annually draw upward of 10,000 revelers to celebrate the start of fall classes. The university and city put an end to the tradition that year after two students were shot the previous year. The City of Morgantown and West Virginia University jointly established the Sunnyside Up Project: Campus Neighborhoods Revitalization Corporation, dedicated to the redevelopment of this area. The first step was to create a comprehensive revitalization plan, which was published in fall 2004. The university&#x27;s Summit Hall Dormitory and the Honors Hall Dormitory are in the southern part of the neighborhood.

Woodburn used to be farmland on the hills to the east of downtown Morgantown. The area saw a rapid growth in population at the beginning of the 20th century as home to tinsmiths from Wales who came to work in the tinplate mill that later became the Sterling Faucet Company plant in Sabraton. A trolley line ran the length of Richwood Avenue and originally connected downtown with Sabraton. The Welsh community was active in the Methodist Church at the intersection of High Street and Willey Street, and held picnics in Whitemoore Park, the main green space in Woodburn. Many of these immigrants retained the Welsh language, and as late as the 1930s it was common to hear Welsh spoken on the streets of Woodburn and the community was known for carrying on a traditional eisteddfod every year.

Located in the southeastern part of Morgantown, Sabraton is a former coal town and was previously known as Sturgiss City and Sabraton Station. The community was named after Sabra Vance Sturgiss, the wife of a local judge. Part of Sabraton was home to a tin plate mill, which later become a manufacturing plant for Sterling Faucet. In its early days, Sabraton was connected to downtown Morgantown by a trolley line that ran the length of Richwood Avenue. Its amenities include Marilla Park.

The city is served by Monongalia County Schools. Public elementary schools in Morgantown and its surrounding area include Cheat Lake, North, Brookhaven, Ridgedale, Mountainview, Mylan Park, Skyview, Suncrest Elementary, and Eastwood. There are four middle schools: Mountaineer Middle, South, Westwood, and Suncrest Middle. The city&#x27;s two high schools are University High School, the mascot of which is the Hawks, and Morgantown High School, whose mascot is the Mohigans. The latter&#x27;s name is that of a non-existent Native American tribe whose name is a combination of the words Morgantown (MO) High (HIG) Annual (AN), which was the school&#x27;s yearbook. The Native American mascot and logo were adopted because of the close relation to the name Mohican, a real Native American tribe. Notable Morgantown High School alumni include screenwriter–film director Lawrence Kasdan (class of 1966), actor Don Knotts (class of 1942), college football coach Tommy Bowden (class of 1972), and TV college football analyst Terry Bowden (class of 1974).

In 2004, Suncrest Middle became a National Blue Ribbon School for the No Child Left Behind Act.
===Private schools===
A Roman Catholic elementary school, Saint Francis de Sales, began sometime prior to 1915 as a two-room school in a house on McLane Avenue in the Seneca neighborhood, and run by lay teacher Miss Sterbutsal, who became Sister M. Isabelle of the Sisters of St. Joseph. In October 1915, the pastorate of Father Peter Flynn arranged for Ursuline nuns from Louisville, Kentucky, and in 1918, under principal Sister M. Isadore, the school moved to a new building on Beechurst Avenue, adjacent to St. Theresa&#x27;s Church. On June 9, 1990, the grade school moved into the former St. Francis Central High School building, and eventually into newly built facility at 41 Guthrie Lane. Its mascot is the Trojan.

St. Francis Central High School existed for several decades on Birch Street in the Evansdale neighborhood until that campus was taken over by the elementary school on June 9, 1990. The West Virginia University Foundation purchased its building and land in July 2003, formally selling it to WVU for $11 million in August 2004, with the university then announcing it intended to use the football and adjacent baseball fields as intramural recreation area.

Other private schools include: Morgantown Christian Academy, Maranatha Christian Academy, Covenant Christian School, Trinity Christian School, St. Francis Elementary/Middle School, and the alternative, non-religious Morgantown Learning Academy.

===Early schools===
While informal schools existed from Morgantown&#x27;s earliest days, the town established a one-story, coeducational, Virginia common school in July 1803, that students attended on a tuition basis. On November 29, 1814, the Virginia General Assembly incorporated Monongalia Academy, the county&#x27;s first public school. Supported by obligatory surveyors&#x27; fees, the male-only institution was the equivalent of a modern-day high school. The Academy moved to a new two-story building in 1830, with principal Jonathan Haddock offering courses in geography, surveying, and navigation in addition to traditional subjects. Presbyterian minister Reverend James Robertson Moore was principal during the Academy&#x27;s 1852–1864 heyday, when its enrollment included students from 14 states. In 1867, the Academy closed, and donated its land toward the establishment of West Virginia University.

The Virginia Assembly in March 1831 authorized the creation of the Morgantown Female Academy. Proceeds from the sale of the original Monongalia Academy building funded construction of a two-story school at Bumbo Lane (the modern-day Fayette Street) and Long Alley (the modern-day Chestnut Street). This school opened April 1, 1834. After the Assembly approved a charter change in 1838, the school became known as the Methodist Academy. This prompted local Presbyterians to create the Woodburn Female Seminary, for which the Monongalia Academy&#x27;s Rev. Moore also served as principal. The seminary closed in 1866, and its assets, like those of the Monongalia Academy, were donated toward the future university.

Following the 1863 creation of West Virginia, the new state&#x27;s first legislature created a public-school system. The act provided for the education of &quot;free colored children&quot;, and was adapted three years later to mandate education for all African-American children. However, a two-tier system was created: White children attended a regular term (at the second former Monongalia Academy building, purchased in 1867 from West Virginia Agricultural College, the future West Virginia University), only a short term was provided for African-Americans, who met at St. Paul&#x27;s African Methodist Episcopal Church, on Beechurst Avenue. In the late 19th and early 20th century, rural educational reformer Alexander Wade lived in Morgantown and was involved in establishing a system of graded education for country schools that was later adopted across the rest of the United States.

==Media==

===Print===
Morgantown has two newspapers. &quot;The Dominion Post&quot; is a privately owned newspaper which is published daily. The university-owned and student-run college newspaper, &quot;The Daily Athenaeum&quot;, is published on weekdays while classes are in session, and is provided free of charge on campus and to many businesses around Morgantown.

There are also other local quasi-newspapers such as the &quot;Post Extra&quot; and the &quot;Morgantown Times&quot;, which typically feature a few local news stories and an abundance of advertisements. Both are free of charge and mass-mailed throughout the Morgantown area.

===Television===
Morgantown is part of the Pittsburgh television market. However, stations in the Clarksburg/Weston/Fairmont market claim Morgantown as part of their primary coverage area. Xfinity (formerly Comcast) and its predecessors have supplemented area cable subscribers with stations from both markets since the 1960s.

===Transportation===
====Public transit====

Most of Morgantown is accessible by Mountain Line Transit Authority bus system. Most service operates Monday-Saturday from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. with a very limited service operating on Sunday during the WVU school year. Mountain Line&#x27;s Grey Line bus operates every day of the year between Clarksburg, West Virginia and Pittsburgh International Airport. Morgantown also has the Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) system. The system has five stations (Walnut, Beechurst, Engineering, Towers, and Medical) covering .

Morgantown Municipal Airport is one of West Virginia&#x27;s few commercial airports. It is approximately northeast of the downtown along U.S. Route 119. North Central West Virginia Airport is about away by road, and Pittsburgh International Airport is about away.

====Rail====

The only active rail line near Morgantown is owned by Norfolk Southern with CSX trackage rights and serves a mine northwest of Rivesville, West Virginia. Coal is the major commodity, with a train serving local chemical industries such as Tanner and Addivant (formerly Chemtura) that require tank cars. These are trucked in and then loaded onto high side gondolas or bulkhead flat cars. Conrail was split by Norfolk Southern and CSX in 1999. CSX pays for half of the cost of maintenance for the line. CSX uses it mostly to bring trains from Grafton to load at Consol&#x27;s Bailey Mine and for direct access to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

====River====
Morgantown relies heavily on the Monongahela River for shipping coal and other products. The river is fully navigable from its mouth at the Ohio River in Pittsburgh, past Morgantown upstream to Fairmont. Morgantown Lock and Dam, in the southern part of the city, helps provide a continuous pool heading upstream towards the Hildebrand Lock and Dam. Point Marion Lock and Dam, the next downstream dam, is responsible for most of the river&#x27;s pool in Morgantown.

====Major roadways====
* Interstate 79
* Interstate 68
* U.S. Highway 19
* U.S. Highway 119
* West Virginia Route 7

<text>Star City is a town in Monongalia County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 1,779 at the 2020 census. It is included in the Morgantown metropolitan area.

==History==
Star City was founded in 1907, and took its name from the local Star Glass Company.

===Socialist Party government===
By 1910 the Socialist Party of America had organized a branch in the town and within a year had won four out of five seats in the city council, as part of a wider national political movement of the time.

The Socialist Party would continue to be the dominant party in Star City politics through 1917, when its rival the Citizens&#x27; Party took over municipal government. To avoid un-American connotations that became associated with the name after World War I, the Socialist Party of Star City in 1918 renamed itself the Independent Citizens&#x27; party and won back local government, partly due to its opposition to the regressive &quot;capitation tax&quot; the Citizens&#x27; Party had imposed. However, in 1924, the People&#x27;s party, formed two years earlier and composed largely of former Citizens&#x27; party supporters, took over. Until that time, the Socialists were a mainstay of this working-class town, organizing the Workingmen&#x27;s Co-operative Store and creating community pillars with Local Twenty-six of the American Flint Glass Workers&#x27; Union and the Young People&#x27;s Socialist League.

===Star City Volunteer Fire Department===
The Star City Volunteer Fire Department was founded in the 1939. The department has an all-volunteer firefighting staff and a combination of paid and volunteer EMS staff. The agency responds to approximately 1,200 emergency calls per year and provides Firefighting and Rescue services to the town of Star City and surrounding unincorporated areas. It is designated as the district&#x27;s Company 20 (Fire) and Station 20 (EMS).

<text>Union is a town in Monroe County, West Virginia, United States. Union’s population is 427 as of 2020. It is the county seat of Monroe County.

==History==
Monroe County was established by an act of the Assembly of Virginia on January 14, 1799, occupying land formerly a part of Greenbrier County. Union did not yet exist when the county&#x27;s first court convened in 1799. However, shortly after Monroe County was created, James Alexander offered 25 acres of land, including a lot for a courthouse which in time became the town of Union. On January 6, 1800, the Virginia Assembly passed an act creating the town of Union and naming William Haynes, John Gray, John Byrnside, James Handley, Michael Erskine, John Hutchinson, and Isaac Estill trustees.

By 1810, at least sixteen lots had been sold in the newly laid out town of Union and a courthouse and jail were built at its center. In 1835, Union had 400 inhabitants and supported two hotels, two tanneries, a school, two churches, and two physicians. Union&#x27;s location on stage coach lines which carried settlers across the Allegheny Mountains helped to fuel the region&#x27;s growth, as did the several mineral spring resorts which operated in Monroe County, including Sweet Springs, Red Sulphur Springs, and Salt Sulphur Springs, all within a twenty-five mile radius of Union. Little activity during the American Civil War occurred around Union other than troop movements, especially in 1864 when regiments of the U.S. Army under General Crook encamped near the town. Small skirmishes occurred throughout the war in the vicinity of Union and Monroe County. A majority of the citizens of Union supported the Confederacy and opposed the creation of West Virginia which included Monroe County. Union was incorporated in 1868.

The town of Union retains much of its historic architecture, with many structures dating to the antebellum period when the local economy was thriving from the resort industry. The present Monroe County Courthouse, built in 1881, displays the fashionable Romanesque style of the late-19th century. Historic churches in Union include the Old Baptist Church (1845), Old Methodist Episcopal Church/Ames Clair Hall (1857), All Saints Episcopal Church (1875), Union United Methodist Church (1889), and the Union Presbyterian Church (1922). The Monroe County Historical Society preserves several historic structures in the town, including the Caperton Law Office, Owen Neel House, Clark-Wisemen House, Ames Clair Hall, and the Old Baptist Church. In recognition of the history of Union and the integrity of its preserved streetscape, the Union Historic District was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.
East of Union is Rehoboth Church, built in 1784; it is the oldest existing church building in West Virginia.

<text>Berkeley Springs is the name of the postal area/U.S. Post Office that serves a large portion of Morgan County to include the municipality of the Town of Bath. The town is the county seat of, Morgan County, West Virginia, United States, in the state&#x27;s eastern panhandle. Berkeley Springs is commonly used to refer to the area in and around the Town of Bath. In 1776 more than 200 people residing at the Warm Springs in Berkeley County, Virginia petitioned the Virginia Legislature to establish a town around the springs; however, it was not until after the WV state constitution was drawn up in 1872 that on February 28, the WV legislature amended the original town charter for Bath and established a true town government elected by the residents. Prior to that date the town was managed by a group of appointed Trustees. Since 1802, it has been referred to by the name of its original post office, Berkeley Springs. The population was 758 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Hagerstown–Martinsburg metropolitan area.

The area contains mineral water springs frequented by Native Americans indigenous to the area, possibly for thousands of years. After settlement by Europeans, the mineral springs drew many visitors from urban areas. Notable colonial visitors to the area included George Washington and James Rumsey. Berkeley Springs remained a popular resort area during the United States&#x27; early years. It is the home of the Berkeley Springs International Water Tasting, the longest-running and largest such event in the world. Another local tradition is the famed Apple Butter Festival, started by a group of local business owners in 1974, with overwhelming support from then-Mayor Frank Heiner. The area continues to be a popular resort area, with tourism the primary industry in the county and there being six full-service spas using mineral water.

==History==

During colonial times in 1748, George Washington, then just 16 years old, was part of the team that surveyed the Eastern Panhandle region for Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron. Washington returned several times over the next several years with his half-brother, Lawrence, who was ill, hoping that the warm springs might improve his health. The springs, and their rumored medicinal benefits, attracted numerous Native Americans and Europeans to the area.

While vacationing in the area in 1767, Washington noted how busy the colonial town had become. Lord Fairfax had built a summer home there and a &quot;private bath&quot;, making the area a popular destination for Virginia&#x27;s social elite. With the advent of independence, &quot;An act for establishing a town at the Warm Springs in the county of Berkeley&quot; was adopted by the Virginia General Assembly in December 1776. Officially, the town was named Bath, in honor of England&#x27;s spa city Bath. 

George Washington, his family members, and several colonial elites were among the town&#x27;s first landowners. The town&#x27;s main north-south street was named Washington, and the main east-west street was named Fairfax. Also, four acres were set aside for &quot;suffering humanity.&quot; The area around the springs always was public land known as &quot;The Grove&quot; and overseen by a state-appointed group of Bath Trustees. This would become Berkeley Springs State Park with its springs and bathhouses, which was made part of the West Virginia state park system in 1925. Nearby, Cacapon State Park was opened in 1933. The mountain that gives its name to the park has an elevation of above sea level.

Bath&#x27;s population increased during and immediately after the Revolutionary War as wounded soldiers and others came to the area believing that the warm springs had medicinal qualities.

===Chronology of names===

In 1772, the springs were part of the newly formed Berkeley County, named after its colonial governor, Norborne Berkeley. The waters became known as Berkeley Springs because the existing protocol was to name springs after the colonial Virginia county in which they were located. Previously, the area had been called &quot;Warm Springs&quot; and &quot;Medicinal Springs&quot; among other names.

Bath became known permanently to the world as &quot;Berkeley Springs&quot; in 1802 when the Virginia postal system was established in the new nation, and there already was a Bath, Virginia, in Bath County.

In 1861, many residents of Virginia were opposed to Virginia&#x27;s secession from the United States, some calling the act of secession treasonous. Following the Wheeling Conventions of 1861, a referendum was held in 41 mostly northwestern Virginia counties on whether to secede from Virginia and seek admission to the United States as a new state. An overwhelming majority of voters in these counties voted in favor of the proposal. Confederates commanded by Stonewall Jackson captured Bath during the Romney Expedition in January 1862, and ransacked the homes of local unionists. The United States admitted the State of West Virginia on June 20, 1863. Berkeley Springs remained the conventional name used for the town. Its sister city is Bath, England.

Two main highways serve Berkeley Springs. The most prominent of these is U.S. Route 522. US 522 traverses the region in a general north-northeast to south-southwest direction. To the north, US 522 connects Berkeley Springs to Interstate 70 and Interstate 68 near Hancock, Maryland, while heading south provides a connection to Interstate 81 near Winchester, Virginia. The other primary highway serving Berkeley Springs is West Virginia Route 9, oriented in a general northwest-to-southeast alignment. WV 9 heads westward to Paw Paw and continues east to Martinsburg. The two highways run concurrently for a short stretch along Main Street in Berkeley Springs.

<text>Paw Paw is a town in Morgan County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 410 at the 2020 census. The town is known for the nearby Paw Paw Tunnel. Paw Paw was incorporated by the Circuit Court of Morgan County on April 8, 1891, and named after pawpaw, a wild fruit that grows in abundance throughout this region. On September 14, 2024 a group of local citizens organized by Maria Gloyd hosted the inaugural Pawpaw Festival in the Town Park. Hundreds of people attended the festival to hear lectures on how to grow and cultivate Pawpaw fruit, and listen to Appalachian music performed by the Paw Paw Community Choir, Ben Townsend, the Critton Hollow String Band, and Mary Hott with the Carpenter Ants. Paw Paw is the westernmost incorporated community in Morgan County, and the Hagerstown-Martinsburg, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Paw Paw is located along the section of the Potomac River known as the Paw Paw Bends. The Paw Paw Valley is surrounded by the ridges of Sideling Hill, Green Ridge, Purslane Mountain and Town Hill.

While the town&#x27;s name is usually associated with the nearby Paw Paw Tunnel which was part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, it is more likely the town was named for the Paw Paw Tunnel constructed by the B&amp;O railroad in the 1830&#x27;s through the Paw Paw Ridge east of the town. The construction of the Paw Paw tunnel across the river in Maryland began in 1836 and was completed in 1850, 12 years behind schedule. Today, the tunnel and nearby canal are part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.

== History ==

The earliest human habitation in the upper Potomac River Valley probably dates from 10,000 BC when humans migrated across the Bering Straits into North America. In the 17th century, Europeans began arriving in increasing numbers. As European settlements gradually spread across western Virginia, the tribes were pushed from their villages and fields, which were then claimed and cultivated by the new settlers.

In 1681, England’s King Charles II made the first land grants in what is now the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia. The territory, which includes Morgan County, was eventually inherited by Thomas, sixth Lord Fairfax and became known as the Fairfax Land Grant. In 1746, Thomas Jefferson’s father Peter was part of the survey party that reached the source of the Potomac River and set down the landmark known as the Fairfax Stone, now part of the Fairfax Stone Historical Monument State Park.

The following year, George Washington surveyed the region and later purchased land on the Paw Paw Bends, so named because of the way the Potomac River twists and turns for 31 miles between the towns of Paw Paw and Little Orleans. Washington described the land as being “In the shape of a horseshoe, the river running almost around it—two hundred acres of rich low grounds with a great abundance of walnut trees.”

By 1749, the Potomac River near present-day Paw Paw was being navigated by fur traders of the Ohio Company, while settlers were establishing farms on the surrounding land.

In 1836, the C&amp;O Canal Company began work on a tunnel that was designed to eliminate seven miles of navigation on the river near Paw Paw. Two years later, construction of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad began. Because of its proximity to both the railroad and the river, Paw Paw was considered a place of strategic importance during the American Civil War and was occupied by some 16,000 Union troops, most whom were quartered at Camp Chase (now Camp Hill), located east of Paw Paw, under the command of Brigadier General Frederick W. Lander.

In 1868, J.B. Hoyt and Company of New York established a leather factory in Paw Paw, which provided hundreds of jobs until its closure in 1951. 
Paw Paw also became well-known for its local orchards and fruit packing houses. The Morgan News reported in 1894 &quot;Paw Paw at the present time is more beautiful than in any former time of her history. The streets are superb, plank pavements elegant and her street lights refulgent.&quot; The streets were lit by oil lamps until 1926 when the Paw Paw Electric Company was awarded the franchise to bring electricity to the town. The first public school in Paw Paw started in the early 1870s in a building erected on the grounds of the tannery, but was washed away in the flood of 1877.

In 1893, two years after incorporation, the town constructed its Mayor&#x27;s Office and Jail. The building was used as mayor&#x27;s office, town council chambers and for civil and social functions until 1977. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in November 2023 and was the first entry for Paw Paw on the National Register. The former Saint Charles Catholic Mission Church constructed in 1876 and used by a small number of Catholic families until 1994 was added to the National Register of Historic Places in March 2024. A third building, the 1928 Paw Paw Black School, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in July 2024. The school was in use from 1928 until the end of &quot;separate but equal education&quot; in 1954. A fourth building, the 1909 WV State Senator P. E. Nixon House, home of prominent local businessman and politician P. E. Nixon, was added to the National Register in November 2024. In addition to these four buildings the WV State Historic Preservation Office has determined three additional buildings are also currently eligible based on their historic significance these are: the circa 1882 B&amp;O Train Depot; the 1940 Consolidated Orchard Apple Packing Plant; and the 1942 Consolidated Distributors Headquarters - currently the Paw Paw Town Hall. 
==Transportation==
The C&amp;O Canal and the B&amp;O Railroad both played important roles in the town&#x27;s growth and prosperity. 
The Potomac River was dangerous and difficult to navigate, and the charter to build a canal to create a trade route with western settlements in Ohio and beyond was granted on May 17, 1785, to the Potowmack Company whose investors included George Washington. Three decades later, more than $729,000 had been spent on the project, but navigation on the river was still limited to only 45 days a year. The charter was taken over by the newly formed C&amp;O Canal Company in 1828.

Construction on the Paw Paw Tunnel began in 1836 with a workforce composed largely of English, Welsh, German and Irish laborers. Plagued by accidents, disease, worker riots, and financial woes, the tunnel finally opened in 1850. Six million bricks were used in its construction which required cutting through 3,118 feet through stratified shale with hand tools and black powder charges. A strike in 1922, a flood in 1924, and the decline in demand for coal, which was a major source of freight revenue for the canal, after World War I led to its closure in 1925.

The B&amp;O Railroad began construction after the C&amp;O Canal but reached Cumberland, Maryland, in 1842, eight years ahead of the canal. 
Railroad construction started in Paw Paw in 1838, and over the next half century, the town became an important focal point for trade, bringing jobs and prosperity to the region. In 1905, the Western Maryland Railroad was constructed north of Paw, and in 1914, the B&amp;O built a shortline through Paw Paw, with six local stops each day. The B&amp;O removed the main line track from Paw Paw in 1961, bringing regular passenger service in Paw Paw to an end. The Paw Paw railroad depot, designed by noted B&amp;O architect E. Francis Baldwin and constructed around 1882 replaced an earlier one opened in 1845, was permanently closed in 1961.

In 1928, the first bridge was built over the Potomac River from Paw Paw into Maryland, enabling the completion of a road directly into Cumberland. Previously, a ferry was used to cross the river.

Today, the primary highway into Paw Paw is West Virginia Route 9. WV 9 heads eastward to Berkeley Springs, the county seat, where it connects with U.S. Route 522. WV 9 also continues eastward from Berkeley Springs to Martinsburg. To the west, WV 9 crosses the Potomac River into Allegany County, Maryland, where it becomes Maryland Route 51. MD 51 continues westward to Cumberland, ending at a junction with Interstate 68, U.S. Route 40 and U.S. Route 220.

<doc id="138544" wikidata="Q2321199" url="?curid=138544" title="Richwood, West Virginia">
<text>Richwood is a city in Nicholas County, West Virginia, United States. In 2020, the census showed Richwood with a population of 1,661. During the 19th and early 20th century Richwood was a booming coal and lumber town. Richwood has a very rich history, including the formation of the Cherry River Navy civic organization to draw attention to issues important to the community. Richwood has also become known statewide as the &quot;Ramp Capital of the World&quot;. Each year, in April, the city hosts a large festival that draws visitors from around the country.

== History ==
The area surrounding the forks of the Cherry River has been populated since the late 1700s. During the 19th century, the area was a sparsely settled semi-wilderness of homesteads and subsistence farms. This changed in 1898 when a railroad was extended into the area, then known as Cherry Tree Bottoms. In 1901, the town was incorporated with its present name referencing the abundant hardwood forests in the area. Soon, the area possessed a large sawmill and the world&#x27;s largest clothespin factory.

The town was once home to several large businesses and industries. In addition to the sawmill and the clothespin factory, there were other factories that produced wood-based products such as axe-handles and paper. Coal also came into the industry picture during Richwood&#x27;s boom-era during pre-Depression years. Banking was a white-collar industry that succeeded in the city with the large companies investing into the city&#x27;s financial corporations. Once the large factories closed or relocated, many of the people followed. The final hit was when the coal industry took a downward turn and most of the local coal mines ceased operation.

Richwood now seeks to be reborn as both an artisan community and a technology center. The Downtown Richwood Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

Richwood is the headquarters of the Cherry River Navy community organization. It was founded by John Teets, A.B. Campbell, and Lee Reese to promote the construction of a since-built missing link in West Virginia Route 39 between Richwood and Marlinton.

On June 23, 2016, a historically severe flood impacted portions of West Virginia. Richwood was among the towns most heavily affected. Flood damage resulted in significant damage to area infrastructure and condemnation of the Richwood High School and Richwood Middle School buildings.

In 2021 former Richwood mayor Bob Henry Baber was sentenced to 1–10 years in jail and to pay restitution for defrauding the city after the major flood in 2016. He had pressured a city clerk to write him out a check for volunteer work done after the flood.

==Economy==

While Richwood was the economic center for Nicholas County for most of the 20th century, the county seat of Summersville has come to be the primary retail and business center during the past 25 years. This is mostly due to the improvement of U.S. Route 19 to a four-lane highway and the development of business along the corridor. Richwood, however, is still by default the political and economic center of eastern Nicholas County, as it is the only incorporated city in the immediate area. The city has a small shopping plaza which houses Dollar General.

There have been efforts to attract visitors to the area for the natural environment of the adjacent Monongahela National Forest. The mayor welcomed attendees of the 2005 Rainbow Gathering that was held in the forest and took the opportunity to encourage craftspeople to buy property and set up businesses there.

Richwood operates the small Richwood Municipal Airport, which is located in the nearby unincorporated community of New Hope.

Richwood has suffered from economic decline and a local drug culture.

==Local places of interest==

Richwood has a mountain setting with close proximity to Monongahela National Forest and access to a great number of recreational areas. Three tributaries of the Gauley River (Williams River, Cranberry River, and Cherry River) all flow wild within this portion of the forest. A scenic highway and visitors center also lie at the intersection of WV 39 and WV 150, which is close to the Cranberry Glades Botanical Area and the Cranberry Wilderness. The Cranberry Glades Botanical Area is the southernmost Canadian-style bog in the world. Summit Lake offers the only flat water recreation in the immediate area. Richwood is also home to Cherry Hill Country Club, a nine-hole golf course located on top of Hinkle Mountain.

==Education==
Three schools, operated by the Nicholas County Board of Education, serve Richwood students: Cherry River Elementary, Richwood Middle School, and Richwood High School. In 2005, the girls&#x27; high school softball team won the school its first team state championship in any sport.

Due to flooding on June 23, 2016, both Richwood High School and Richwood Middle School have been temporarily relocated. The Nicholas County Board of Education plans on renovating the Cherry River Elementary site to house all three of Richwood&#x27;s schools.

==Healthcare==
Camden Family Health is the primary healthcare provider within Richwood. It operates a rural health clinic with a full staff including MD, FNP, and RN access. Summersville Regional Medical Center, located in the county seat, offers the nearest emergency room and hospital.

Two hospitals were previously located in Richwood. McClung Hospital was open during the city&#x27;s boom years in the early 1900s. Richwood Area Community Hospital, formerly known as Sacred Heart Hospital, operated from 1954 until June 2008, when it was forced to close due to poor finances.

==Emergency services==
The Richwood Volunteer Fire Department serves as Richwood&#x27;s primary fire and rescue service. They hold an ISO Class rating of 4. They serve the community from their central station located in the middle of town, and provide fire and rescue services to Richwood and surrounding areas.

Richwood Police Department is the city&#x27;s primary police force. They serve the community from their office located in the municipal building. The Nicholas County Sheriff&#x27;s Department and West Virginia State Police, which has a detachment located in the city, also provide police service as needed.

Emergency medical services are provided by Redi-Care Ambulance. They are a private ambulance company with one station located in the east end of town. They typically house one ALS unit and one BLS unit at all times.

==Transportation==
Richwood&#x27;s primary road is a two-lane highway carrying West Virginia Routes 39 and 55. These highways provide access to U.S. Route 19 to the west and U.S. Route 219 to the east. The original construction of the road portion from Marlinton to Richwood through the Monongahela National Forest was spured by the Cherry River Navy civic organization, reducing what was a three-hour drive on indirect alternate routes to a current 45-minute drive. It is considered one of the most scenic drives in West Virginia, providing access to a number of National Forest recreation sites.

In the town&#x27;s early years, the railroad was a popular form of transporting wood, coal, and passengers in and out of Richwood on a daily basis. As time wore on, however, rail traffic decreased. By the early 1980s, trains had been completely replaced by road transportation in the area. The tracks were removed by the end of the decade and the old railroad grade was transformed into a gravel rail-trail for hiking and bicycling.
