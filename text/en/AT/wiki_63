<text>Magical realism, magic realism, or marvelous realism is a style or genre of fiction and art that presents a realistic view of the world while incorporating magical elements, often blurring the lines between speculation and reality. &quot;Magical realism&quot; is the most commonly used of the three terms and refers to literature in particular, with magical or supernatural phenomena presented in an otherwise real-world or mundane setting, and is commonly found in novels and dramatic performances. In his article &quot;Magical Realism in Spanish American Literature&quot;, Luis Leal explains the difference between magic literature and magical realism, stating that, &quot;Magical realism is not magic literature either. Its aim, unlike that of magic, is to express emotions, not to evoke them.&quot; Despite including certain magic elements, it is generally considered to be a different genre from fantasy because magical realism uses a substantial amount of realistic detail and employs magical elements to make a point about reality, while fantasy stories are often separated from reality. The two are also distinguished in that magic realism is closer to literary fiction than to fantasy, which is instead a type of genre fiction. Magical realism is often seen as an amalgamation of real and magical elements that produces a more inclusive writing form than either literary realism or fantasy.

== Description ==
The term &quot;magic realism&quot; is broadly descriptive rather than critically rigorous, and Matthew Strecher (1999) defines it as &quot;what happens when a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe.&quot; The term and its wide definition can often become confused, as many writers are categorized as magical realists. The term was influenced by a German and Italian painting style of the 1920s which were given the same name. In &quot;The Art of Fiction&quot;, British novelist and critic David Lodge defines magic realism: &quot;when marvellous and impossible events occur in what otherwise purports to be a realistic narrative—is an effect especially associated with contemporary Latin American fiction (for example the work of the Colombian novelist Gabriel García Márquez) but it is also encountered in novels from other continents, such as those of Günter Grass, Salman Rushdie and Milan Kundera. All these writers have lived through great historical convulsions and wrenching personal upheavals, which they feel cannot be adequately represented in a discourse of undisturbed realism&quot;, citing Kundera&#x27;s 1979 novel &quot;The Book of Laughter and Forgetting&quot; as an exemplar.&quot; Michiko Kakutani writes that &quot;The transactions between the extraordinary and the mundane that occur in so much Latin American fiction are not merely a literary technique, but also a mirror of a reality in which the fantastic is frequently part of everyday life.&quot; Magical realism often mixes history and fantasy, as in Salman Rushdie&#x27;s &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot;, in which the children born at midnight on August 15, 1947, the moment of India&#x27;s independence, are telepathically linked.

Irene Guenther (1995) tackles the German roots of the term, and how an earlier magic realist art is related to a later magic realist literature; meanwhile, magical realism is often associated with Latin-American literature, including founders of the genre, particularly the authors Gabriel García Márquez, Isabel Allende, Jorge Luis Borges, Juan Rulfo, Miguel Ángel Asturias, Elena Garro, Mireya Robles, Rómulo Gallegos, Alejo Carpentier and Arturo Uslar Pietri. In English literature, its chief exponents include Neil Gaiman, Salman Rushdie, Alice Hoffman, Louis De Bernieres, Nick Joaquin, and Nicola Barker. In Russian literature, key proponents include Mikhail Bulgakov, Soviet dissident Andrei Sinyavsky and the playwright Nina Sadur. In Bengali literature, prominent writers of magic realism include Nabarun Bhattacharya, Akhteruzzaman Elias, Shahidul Zahir, Jibanananda Das and Syed Waliullah. In Kannada literature, the writers Shivaram Karanth and Devanur Mahadeva have infused magical realism in their most prominent works. In Japanese literature, one of the most important authors of this genre is Haruki Murakami. In Chinese literature the best-known writer of the style is Mo Yan, the 2012 Nobel Prize laureate in Literature for his &quot;hallucinatory realism&quot;. In Polish literature, magic realism is represented by Olga Tokarczuk, the 2018 Nobel Prize laureate in Literature.

==Etymology and literary origins==
The term first appeared as the German &quot;magischer Realismus&quot; (&#x27;magical realism&#x27;). In 1925, German art critic Franz Roh used &quot;magischer Realismus&quot; to refer to a painterly style known as &quot;Neue Sachlichkeit&quot; (&#x27;New Objectivity&#x27;), an alternative to expressionism that was championed by German museum director Gustav Hartlaub. Roh identified magic realism&#x27;s accurate detail, smooth photographic clarity, and portrayal of the &#x27;magical&#x27; nature of the rational world; it reflected the uncanniness of people and our modern technological environment. He also believed that magic realism was related to, but distinct from, surrealism, due to magic realism&#x27;s focus on material object and the &quot;actual existence&quot; of things in the world, as opposed to surrealism&#x27;s more abstract, psychological, and subconscious reality.

19th-century Romantic writers such as E. T. A. Hoffmann and Nikolai Gogol, especially in their fairy tales and short stories, have been credited with originating a trend within Romanticism that contained &quot;a European magical realism where the realms of fantasy are continuously encroaching and populating the realms of the real&quot;. In the words of Anatoly Lunacharsky:

Unlike other romantics, Hoffmann was a satirist. He saw the reality surrounding him with unusual keenness, and in this sense he was one of the first and sharpest realists. The smallest details of everyday life, funny features in the people around him with extraordinary honesty were noticed by him. In this sense, his works are a whole mountain of delightfully sketched caricatures of reality. But he was not limited to them. Often he created nightmares similar to Gogol&#x27;s &quot;Portrait&quot;. Gogol is a student of Hoffmann and is extremely dependent on Hoffmann in many works, for example in &quot;Portrait&quot; and &quot;The Nose&quot;. In them, just like Hoffmann, he frightens with a nightmare and contrasts it to a positive beginning ... Hoffmann&#x27;s dream was free, graceful, attractive, cheerful to infinity. Reading his fairy tales, you understand that Hoffmann is, in essence, a kind, clear person, because he could tell a child such things as &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; or &quot;The Royal Bride&quot; – these pearls of human fantasy.

German magic-realist paintings influenced the Italian writer Massimo Bontempelli, who has been called the first to apply magic realism to writing, aiming to capture the fantastic, mysterious nature of reality. In 1926, he founded the magic realist magazine &quot;900.Novecento,&quot; and his writings influenced Belgian magic realist writers Johan Daisne and Hubert Lampo.

Roh&#x27;s magic realism also influenced writers in Hispanic America, where it was translated in 1927 as &quot;realismo mágico&quot;. Venezuelan writer Arturo Uslar-Pietri, who had known Bontempelli, wrote influential magic-realist short stories in the 1920s and 30s that focused on the mystery and reality of how we live. Luis Leal attests that Uslar Pietri seemed to have been the first to use the term &quot;realismo mágico&quot; in literature, in 1948. There is evidence that Mexican writer Elena Garro used the same term to describe the works of E. T. A. Hoffmann, but dismissed her own work as a part of the genre. French-Russian Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier, who rejected Roh&#x27;s magic realism as tiresome pretension, developed his related concept &quot;lo real maravilloso&quot; (&#x27;marvelous realism&#x27;) in 1949. Maggie Ann Bowers writes that marvelous-realist literature and art expresses &quot;the seemingly opposed perspectives of a pragmatic, practical and tangible approach to reality and an acceptance of magic and superstition&quot; within an environment of differing cultures.

Magic realism was later used to describe the uncanny realism by such American painters as Ivan Albright, Peter Blume, Paul Cadmus, Gray Foy, George Tooker, and Viennese-born Henry Koerner, among other artists during the 1940s and 1950s. However, in contrast with its use in literature, magic realist art does not often include overtly fantastic or magical content, but rather, it looks at the mundane through a hyper-realistic and often mysterious lens.

The term &quot;magical realism&quot;, as opposed to &quot;magic realism&quot;, first emerged in the 1955 essay &quot;Magical Realism in Spanish American Fiction&quot; by critic Angel Flores in reference to writing that combines aspects of magic realism and marvelous realism. While Flores named Jorge Luis Borges as the first magical realist, he failed to acknowledge either Carpentier or Uslar Pietri for bringing Roh&#x27;s magic realism to Latin America. Borges is often seen as a predecessor of magical realists, with only Flores considering him a true magical realist. After Flores&#x27;s essay, there was a resurgence of interest in marvelous realism, which, after the Cuban revolution of 1959, led to the term &quot;magical realism&quot; being applied to a new type of literature known for matter-of-fact portrayal of magical events.

Literary magic realism originated in Latin America. Writers often traveled between their home country and European cultural hubs, such as Paris or Berlin, and were influenced by the art movement of the time. Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier and Venezuelan Arturo Uslar-Pietri, for example, were strongly influenced by European artistic movements, such as Surrealism, during their stays in Paris in the 1920s and 1930s. One major event that linked painterly and literary magic realisms was the translation and publication of Franz Roh&#x27;s book into Spanish by Spain&#x27;s &quot;Revista de Occidente&quot; in 1927, headed by major literary figure José Ortega y Gasset. &quot;Within a year, Magic Realism was being applied to the prose of European authors in the literary circles of Buenos Aires.&quot; Jorge Luis Borges inspired and encouraged other Latin American writers in the development of magical realism – particularly with his first magical realist publication, &quot;Historia universal de la infamia&quot; in 1935. Between 1940 and 1950, magical realism in Latin America reached its peak, with prominent writers appearing mainly in Argentina. Alejo Carpentier&#x27;s novel &quot;The Kingdom of This World&quot;, published in 1949, is often characterised as an important harbinger of magic realism, which reached its most canonical incarnation in Gabriel García Marquez&#x27;s novel &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; (1967). García Marquez cited Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; as a formative influence: &quot;The first line almost knocked me out of bed. It begins: &#x27;As Gregor Samsa awoke from uneasy dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect.&#x27; When I read that line I thought to myself I didn&#x27;t know anyone was allowed to write things like that. If I had known, I would have started writing a long time ago.&quot; He also cited the stories told to him by his grandmother: &quot;She told me things that sounded supernatural and fantastic, but she told them with complete naturalness. She did not change her expression at all when telling her stories, and everyone was surprised. In previous attempts to write &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;, I tried to tell the story without believing in it. I discovered that what I had to was believe in them myself and them write them with the same expression with which my grandmother told them: with a brick face.&quot;

The theoretical implications of visual art&#x27;s magic realism greatly influenced European and Latin American literature. Italian Massimo Bontempelli, for instance, claimed that literature could be a means to create a collective consciousness by &quot;opening new mythical and magical perspectives on reality&quot;, and used his writings to inspire an Italian nation governed by Fascism. Uslar Pietri was closely associated with Roh&#x27;s form of magic realism and knew Bontempelli in Paris. Rather than follow Carpentier&#x27;s developing versions of &quot;the (Latin) American marvelous real&quot;, Uslar Pietri&#x27;s writings emphasize &quot;the mystery of human living amongst the reality of life&quot;. He believed magic realism was &quot;a continuation of the vanguardia [or avant-garde] modernist experimental writings of Latin America&quot;.

==Characteristics==
The extent to which the characteristics below apply to a given magic realist text varies. Every text is different and employs a smattering of the qualities listed here. However, they accurately portray what one might expect from a magic realist text.

===Fantastical realism elements===
Magical realism portrays fantastical events in an otherwise realistic tone. It brings fables, folk tales, and myths into contemporary social relevance. Fantasy traits given to characters, such as levitation, telepathy, and telekinesis, help to encompass modern political realities that can be phantasmagorical.

===Real-world setting===
The existence of fantastic elements in the real world provides the basis for magical realism. Writers do not invent new worlds, but rather, they reveal the magical in the existing world, as was done by Gabriel García Márquez, who wrote the seminal work &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;. In the world of magical realism, the supernatural realm blends with the natural, familiar world.

===Authorial reticence===
&quot;Authorial reticence&quot; is the &quot;deliberate withholding of information and explanations about the disconcerting fictitious world&quot;. The narrator is indifferent, a characteristic enhanced by this absence of explanation of fantastic events; the story proceeds with &quot;logical precision&quot; as if nothing extraordinary had taken place. Magical events are presented as ordinary occurrences; therefore, the reader accepts the marvelous as normal and common.

===Plenitude===
In his essay &quot;The Baroque and the Marvelous Real&quot;, Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier defines the baroque by a lack of emptiness, a departure from structure or rules, and an &quot;extraordinary&quot; abundance (&quot;plenitude&quot;) of disorienting detail. (He cites Mondrian as its opposite.) From this angle, Carpentier views the baroque as a layering of elements, which translates easily into the postcolonial or transcultural Latin-American atmosphere that he emphasizes in &quot;The Kingdom of this World&quot;. &quot;America, a continent of symbiosis, mutations ... mestizaje, engenders the baroque&quot;, made explicit by elaborate Aztec temples and associative Nahuatl poetry. These mixing ethnicities grow together with the American baroque; the space in between is where the &quot;marvelous real&quot; is seen. Marvelous: not meaning beautiful and pleasant, but extraordinary, strange, and excellent. Such a complex system of layering—encompassed in the Latin-American &quot;boom&quot; novel, such as &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;—aims towards &quot;translating the scope of America&quot;.

===Hybridity===
Magical realism plot lines characteristically employ hybrid multiple planes of reality that take place in &quot;inharmonious arenas of such opposites as urban and rural, and Western and indigenous&quot;.

===Metafiction===
This trait centers on the reader&#x27;s role in literature. With its multiple realities and specific reference to the reader&#x27;s world, it explores the impact fiction has on reality, reality on fiction, and the reader&#x27;s role in between; as such, it is well suited for drawing attention to social or political criticism. Furthermore, it is the tool paramount in the execution of a related and major magic-realist phenomenon: textualization. This term defines two conditions—first, where a fictitious reader enters the story within a story while reading it, making them self-conscious of their status as readers—and secondly, where the textual world enters into the reader&#x27;s (real) world. Good sense would negate this process, but &quot;magic&quot; is the flexible convention that allows it.

===Heightened awareness of mystery===
Magic realist literature tends to leave out explanation of its magical element or obfuscate elements of the story, creating a sense of confusion and mystery. For example, when reading &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot;, the reader must let go of pre-existing ties to conventional exposition, plot advancement, linear time structure, scientific reason, etc., to strive for a state of heightened awareness of life&#x27;s connectedness or hidden meanings in order for the book to begin to make sense. Luis Leal articulates this feeling as &quot;to seize the mystery that breathes behind things&quot;, and supports the claim by saying a writer must heighten his senses to the point of (&#x27;limit state&#x27; or &#x27;extreme&#x27;) in order to realize all levels of reality, most importantly that of mystery.

===Political critique===
Magic realism contains an &quot;implicit criticism of society, particularly the elite&quot;. Especially with regard to Latin America, the style breaks from the inarguable discourse of &quot;privileged centers of literature&quot;. This is a mode primarily about and for &quot;ex-centrics&quot;: the geographically, socially, and economically marginalized. Therefore, magic realism&#x27;s &quot;alternative world&quot; works to correct the reality of established viewpoints (like realism, naturalism, modernism). Magic-realist texts, under this logic, are subversive texts, revolutionary against socially-dominant forces. Alternatively, the socially-dominant may implement magical realism to disassociate themselves from their &quot;power discourse&quot;. Theo D&#x27;haen calls this change in perspective &quot;decentering&quot;.

In his review of Gabriel Garcia Márquez&#x27;s novel, &quot;Chronicle of a Death Foretold&quot;, Salman Rushdie argues that the formal experiment of magic realism allows political ideas to be expressed in ways that might not be possible through more established literary forms:

==Major topics in criticism==

===Ambiguities in definition===
Mexican critic Luis Leal summed up the difficulty of defining magical realism by writing, &quot;If you can explain it, then it&#x27;s not magical realism.&quot; He offers his own definition by writing, &quot;Without thinking of the concept of magical realism, each writer gives expression to a reality he observes in the people. To me, magical realism is an attitude on the part of the characters in the novel toward the world&quot;, or toward nature.

Leal and Guenther both quote Arturo Uslar-Pietri, who described &quot;man as a mystery surrounded by realistic facts. A poetic prediction or a poetic denial of reality. What for lack of another name could be called a magical realism.&quot;

===Western and native worldviews===
The critical perspective towards magical realism as a conflict between reality and abnormality stems from the Western reader&#x27;s disassociation with mythology, a root of magical realism more easily understood by non-Western cultures. Western confusion regarding magical realism is due to the &quot;conception of the real&quot; created in a magical realist text: rather than explain reality using natural or physical laws, as in typical Western texts, magical realist texts create a reality &quot;in which the relation between incidents, characters, and setting could not be based upon or justified by their status within the physical world or their normal acceptance by bourgeois mentality.&quot;

Guatemalan author William Spindler&#x27;s article, &quot;Magic realism: A Typology&quot;, suggests that there are three kinds of magic realism, which however are by no means incompatible:

* European &quot;metaphysical&quot; magic realism, with its sense of estrangement and the uncanny, exemplified by Kafka&#x27;s fiction;
* &quot;ontological&quot; magical realism, characterized by &quot;matter-of-factness&quot; in relating &quot;inexplicable&quot; events; and
* &quot;anthropological&quot; magical realism, where a Native worldview is set side by side with the Western rational worldview.

Spindler&#x27;s typology of magic realism has been criticized as:

===Lo real maravilloso===
Alejo Carpentier originated the term (roughly &#x27;the marvelous real&#x27;) in the prologue to his novel &quot;The Kingdom of this World&quot; (1949); however, some debate whether he is truly a magical realist writer, or simply a precursor and source of inspiration. Maggie Bowers claims he is widely acknowledged as the originator of Latin American magical realism (as both a novelist and critic); she describes Carpentier&#x27;s conception as a kind of heightened reality where elements of the miraculous can appear while seeming natural and unforced. She suggests that by disassociating himself and his writings from Roh&#x27;s painterly magic realism, Carpentier aimed to show how—by virtue of Latin America&#x27;s varied history, geography, demography, politics, myths, and beliefs—improbable and marvelous things are made possible. Furthermore, Carpentier&#x27;s meaning is that Latin America is a land filled with marvels, and that &quot;writing about this land automatically produces a literature of marvelous reality.&quot;

&quot;The marvelous&quot; may be easily confused with magical realism, as both modes introduce supernatural events without surprising the implied author. In both, these magical events are expected and accepted as everyday occurrences. However, the marvelous world is a unidimensional world. The implied author believes that anything can happen here, as the entire world is filled with supernatural beings and situations to begin with. Fairy tales are a good example of marvelous literature. The important idea in defining the marvelous is that readers understand that this fictional world is different from the world where they live. The &quot;marvelous&quot; one-dimensional world differs from the &quot;bidimensional&quot; world of magical realism because, in the latter, the supernatural realm blends with the natural, familiar world (arriving at the combination of &quot;two&quot; layers of reality: bidimensionality). While some use the terms magical realism and lo real maravilloso interchangeably, the key difference lies in the focus.

Critic Luis Leal attests that Carpentier was an originating pillar of the magical realist style by implicitly referring to the latter&#x27;s critical works, writing that &quot;The existence of the marvelous real is what started magical realist literature, which some critics claim is &quot;the&quot; truly American literature.&quot; It can consequently be drawn that Carpentier&#x27;s is especially distinct from &#x27;magical realism&#x27; by the fact that the former applies specifically to &quot;América&quot; (the American content). On that note, Lee A. Daniel categorizes critics of Carpentier into three groups: those that do not consider him a magical realist whatsoever (Ángel Flores), those that call him &quot;a writer with no mention of his (Gómez Gil, Jean Franco, Carlos Fuentes)&quot;, and those that use the two terms interchangeably (Fernando Alegria, Luis Leal, Emir Rodriguez Monegal).

===Latin American exclusivity===
Ángel Flores states that magical realism is an international commodity but that it has a Hispanic birthplace, writing that &quot;Magical realism is a continuation of the romantic realist tradition of Spanish language literature and its European counterparts.&quot; There is disagreement between those who see magical realism as a Latin American invention and those who see it as the global product of a postmodern world. Guenther concludes, &quot;Conjecture aside, it is in Latin America that [magic realism] was primarily seized by literary criticism and was, through translation and literary appropriation, transformed.&quot; Magic realism has been internationalized: dozens of non-Hispanic writers are categorized as such, and many believe that it truly &quot;is&quot; an international commodity.

===Postmodernism===
Some have argued that connecting magical realism to postmodernism is a logical next step. To further connect the two concepts, there are descriptive commonalities between the two that Belgian critic Theo D&#x27;haen addresses in his essay, &quot;Magical Realism and Postmodernism&quot;. While authors such as Günter Grass, Thomas Bernhard, Peter Handke, Italo Calvino, John Fowles, Angela Carter, John Banville, Michel Tournier, Willem Brakman, and Louis Ferron might be widely considered postmodernist, they can &quot;just as easily be categorized ... magic realist&quot;. A list has been compiled of characteristics one might typically attribute to postmodernism, but that also could describe literary magic realism: &quot;self-reflexiveness, metafiction, eclecticism, redundancy, multiplicity, discontinuity, intertextuality, parody, the dissolution of character and narrative instance, the erasure of boundaries, and the destabilization of the reader&quot;. To further connect the two, magical realism and postmodernism share the themes of post-colonial discourse, in which jumps in time and focus cannot really be explained with scientific but rather with magical reasoning; textualization (of the reader); and metafiction.

Concerning attitude toward audience, the two have, some argue, a lot in common. Magical realist works do not seek to primarily satisfy a popular audience, but instead, a sophisticated audience that must be attuned to noticing textual &quot;subtleties&quot;. While the postmodern writer condemns escapist literature (like fantasy, crime, ghost fiction), he/she is inextricably related to it concerning readership. There are two modes in postmodern literature: one, commercially successful pop fiction, and the other, philosophy, better suited to intellectuals. A singular reading of the first mode will render a distorted or reductive understanding of the text. The fictitious reader—such as Aureliano from &quot;100 Years of Solitude&quot;—is the hostage used to express the writer&#x27;s anxiety on this issue of who is reading the work and to what ends, and of how the writer is forever reliant upon the needs and desires of readers (the market). The magic realist writer with difficulty must reach a balance between saleability and intellectual integrity. Wendy Faris, talking about magic realism as a contemporary phenomenon that leaves modernism for postmodernism, says, &quot;Magic realist fictions do seem more youthful and popular than their modernist predecessors, in that they often (though not always) cater with unidirectional story lines to our basic desire to hear what happens next. Thus they may be more clearly designed for the entertainment of readers.&quot;

==Comparison with related genres==
When attempting to define what something &quot;is&quot;, it is often helpful to define what something is &quot;not&quot;. Many literary critics attempt to classify novels and literary works in only one genre, such as &quot;romantic&quot; or &quot;naturalist&quot;, not always taking into account that many works fall into multiple categories. Much discussion is cited from Maggie Ann Bowers&#x27; book &quot;Magic(al) Realism&quot;, wherein she attempts to delimit the terms magic realism and magical realism by examining the relationships with other genres such as realism, surrealism, fantastic literature, science fiction and its African version, the animist realism.

===Realism===
Realism is an attempt to create a depiction of actual life; a novel does not simply rely on what it presents but &quot;how&quot; it presents it. In this way, a realist narrative acts as framework by which the reader constructs a world using the raw materials of life. Understanding both realism and magical realism within the realm of a narrative mode is key to understanding both terms. Magical realism &quot;relies upon the presentation of real, imagined or magical elements as if they were real. It relies upon realism, but only so that it can stretch what is acceptable as real to its limits.&quot; Literary theorist Kornelije Kvas wrote that &quot;what is created in magic(al) realism works is a fictional world close to reality, marked by a strong presence of the unusual and the fantastic, in order to point out, among other things, the contradictions and shortcomings of society. The presence of the element of the fantastic does not violate the manifest coherence of a work that is characteristic of traditional realist literature. Fantastic (magical) elements appear as part of everyday reality, function as saviors of the human against the onslaught of conformism, evil and totalitarianism. Moreover, in magical realism works we find objective narration characteristic of traditional, 19th-century realism.&quot;

As a simple point of comparison, Roh&#x27;s differentiation between expressionism and post-expressionism as described in &quot;German Art in the 20th Century,&quot; may be applied to magic realism and realism. Realism pertains to the terms &quot;history&quot;, &quot;mimetic&quot;, &quot;familiarization&quot;, &quot;empiricism/logic&quot;, &quot;narration&quot;, &quot;closure-ridden/reductive naturalism&quot;, and &quot;rationalization/cause and effect&quot;. On the other hand, magic realism encompasses the terms &quot;myth/legend&quot;, &quot;fantastic/supplementation&quot;, &quot;defamiliarization&quot;, &quot;mysticism/magic&quot;, &quot;meta-narration&quot;, &quot;open-ended/expansive romanticism&quot;, and &quot;imagination/negative capability&quot;.

===Surrealism===
Surrealism is often confused with magical realism as they both explore illogical or non-realist aspects of humanity and existence. There is a strong historical connection between Franz Roh&#x27;s concept of magic realism and surrealism, as well as the resulting influence on Carpentier&#x27;s marvelous reality; however, important differences remain. Surrealism &quot;is most distanced from magical realism [in that] the aspects that it explores are associated not with material reality but with the imagination and the mind, and in particular it attempts to express the &#x27;inner life&#x27; and psychology of humans through art&quot;. It seeks to express the sub-conscious, unconscious, the repressed and inexpressible. Magical realism, on the other hand, rarely presents the extraordinary in the form of a dream or a &quot;psychological experience&quot;. &quot;To do so&quot;, Bowers writes, &quot;takes the magic of recognizable material reality and places it into the little understood world of the imagination. The ordinariness of magical realism&#x27;s magic relies on its accepted and unquestioned position in tangible and &quot;material reality&quot;.&quot;

===Fabulism===
Fabulism traditionally refers to fables, parables, and myths, and is sometimes used in contemporary contexts for authors whose work falls within or relates to magical realism.

Though often used to refer to works of magical realism, fabulism incorporates fantasy elements into reality, using myths and fables to critique the exterior world and offer direct allegorical interpretations. Austrian-American child psychologist Bruno Bettelheim suggested that fairy tales have psychological merit. They are used to translate trauma into a context that people can more easily understand and help to process difficult truths. Bettelheim posited that the darkness and morality of traditional fairy tales allowed children to grapple with questions of fear through symbolism. Fabulism helped to work through these complexities and, in the words of Bettelheim, &quot;make physical what is otherwise ephemeral or ineffable in an attempt ... of understanding those things that we struggle the most to talk about: loss, love, transition.&quot;

Author Amber Sparks described fabulism as blending fantastical elements into a realistic setting. Crucial to the genre, said Sparks, is that the elements are often borrowed from specific myths, fairy tales, and folktales. Unlike magical realism, it does not just use general magical elements, but directly incorporates details from well known stories. &quot;Our lives are bizarre, meandering, and fantastic&quot;, said Hannah Gilham of the &quot;Washington Square Review&quot; regarding fabulism. &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t our fiction reflect that?&quot;

While magical realism is traditionally used to refer to works that are Latin American in origin, fabulism is not tied to any specific culture. Rather than focusing on political realities, fabulism tends to focus on the entirety of the human experience through the mechanization of fairy tales and myths. This can be seen in the works of C. S. Lewis, whose biographer, A.N. Wilson, referred to him as the greatest fabulist of the 20th century. His 1956 novel &quot;Till We Have Faces&quot; has been referenced as a fabulist retelling. This re-imagining of the story of Cupid and Psyche uses an age-old myth to impart moralistic knowledge on the reader. A Washington Post review of a Lewis biography discusses how his work creates &quot;a fiction&quot; in order to deliver a lesson. Says the Post of Lewis, &quot;The fabulist ... illuminates the nature of things through a tale both he and his auditors, or readers, know to be an ingenious analogical invention.&quot;

Italo Calvino is an example of a writer in the genre who uses the term &quot;fabulist&quot;. Calvino is best known for his book trilogy, &quot;Our Ancestors&quot;, a collection of moral tales told through surrealist fantasy. Like many fabulist collections, his work is often classified as allegories for children. Calvino wanted fiction, like folk tales, to act as a teaching device. &quot;Time and again, Calvino insisted on the &#x27;educational potential&#x27; of the fable and its function as a moral exemplum&quot;, wrote journalist Ian Thomson about the Italian Fabulist.

While reviewing the work of Romanian-born American theater director Andrei Şerban, &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Mel Gussow coined the term &quot;The New Fabulism&quot;. Şerban is famous for his reinventions in the art of staging and directing, known for directing works like &quot;The Stag King&quot; and &quot;The Serpent Woman&quot;, both fables adapted into plays by Carl Gozzi. Gussow defined &quot;The New Fabulism&quot; as &quot;taking ancient myths and turn(ing) them into morality tales&quot;, In Ed Menta&#x27;s book, &quot;The Magic Behind the Curtain&quot;, he explores Şerban&#x27;s work and influence within the context of American theatre. He wrote that the Fabulist style allowed Şerban to neatly combine technical form and his own imagination. Through directing fabulist works, Şerban can inspire an audience with innate goodness and romanticism through the magic of theatre. &quot;The New Fabulism has allowed Şerban to pursue his own ideals of achieving on sage the naivete of a children&#x27;s theater&quot;, wrote Menta. &quot;It is in this simplicity, this innocence, this magic that Şerban finds any hope for contemporary theatre at all.&quot;

===Fantasy===
Fantasy and magic realism are commonly held to be unrelated apart from some shared inspirations in mythology and folklore. Amaryll Beatrice Chanady distinguishes magical realist literature from fantasy literature (&quot;the fantastic&quot;) based on differences between three shared dimensions: the use of antinomy (the simultaneous presence of two conflicting codes), the inclusion of events that cannot be integrated into a logical framework, and the use of authorial reticence. In fantasy, the presence of the supernatural code is perceived as problematic, something that draws special attention—where in magical realism, the presence of the supernatural is accepted. In fantasy, while authorial reticence creates a disturbing effect on the reader, it works to &quot;integrate the supernatural&quot; into the natural framework in magical realism. This integration is made possible in magical realism as the author presents the supernatural as being equally valid to the natural. There is no hierarchy between the two codes. The ghost of Melquíades in Márquez&#x27;s &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; or the baby ghost in Toni Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Beloved&quot; who visit or haunt the inhabitants of their previous residence are both presented by the narrator as ordinary occurrences; the reader, therefore, accepts the marvelous as normal and common.

To Clark Zlotchew, the differentiating factor between the fantastic and magical realism is that in fantastic literature, such as Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;, there is a hesitation experienced by the protagonist, implied author or reader in deciding whether to attribute natural or supernatural causes to an unsettling event, or between rational or irrational explanations. Fantastic literature has also been defined as a piece of narrative in which there is a constant faltering between belief and non-belief in the supernatural or extraordinary event.

In Leal&#x27;s view, writers of fantasy literature, such as Borges, can create &quot;new worlds, perhaps new planets. By contrast, writers like García Márquez, who use magical realism, don&#x27;t create new worlds, but suggest the magical in our world.&quot; In magical realism, the supernatural realm blends with the natural, familiar world. This twofold world of magical realism differs from the onefold world that can be found in fairy-tale and fantasy literature. By contrast, in the series &quot;Sorcerous Stabber Orphen&quot; the laws of natural world become a basis for a naturalistic concept of magic.

Prominent English-language fantasy writers have rejected definitions of &quot;magic realism&quot; as something other than a synonym for fantasy fiction. Gene Wolfe said, &quot;magic realism is fantasy written by people who speak Spanish&quot;, and Terry Pratchett said magic realism &quot;is like a polite way of saying you write fantasy&quot;.

===Animist realism===
&quot;Animist realism&quot; is a term for conceptualizing the African literature that has been written based on the strong presence of the imaginary ancestor, the traditional religion and especially the animism of African cultures. The term was used by Pepetela (1989) and Harry Garuba (2003) to be a new conception of magic realism in African literature.

===Science fiction===
While science fiction and magical realism both bend the notion of what is real, toy with human imagination, and are forms of (often fantastical) fiction, they differ greatly. Bower&#x27;s cites Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot; as a novel that exemplifies the science fiction novel&#x27;s requirement of a &quot;rational, physical explanation for any unusual occurrences&quot;. Huxley portrays a world where the population is highly controlled with mood enhancing drugs, which are controlled by the government. In this world, there is no link between copulation and reproduction. Humans are produced in giant test tubes, where chemical alterations during gestation determine their fates. Bowers argues that &quot;The science fiction narrative&#x27;s distinct difference from magical realism is that it is set in a world different from any known reality and its realism resides in the fact that we can recognize it as a possibility for our future. Unlike magical realism, it does not have a realistic setting that is recognizable in relation to any past or present reality.&quot;

===Major authors and works===

Although critics and writers debate which authors or works fall within the magical realism genre, the following authors represent the narrative mode. Within the Latin American world, the most iconic of magical realist writers are Jorge Luis Borges, Isabel Allende, and Nobel Laureate Gabriel García Márquez, whose novel &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; was an instant worldwide success.

García Márquez confessed: &quot;My most important problem was destroying the line of demarcation that separates what seems real from what seems fantastic.&quot; Allende was the first Latin American woman writer recognized outside the continent. Her best-known novel, &quot;The House of the Spirits&quot;, is arguably similar to García Márquez&#x27;s style of magical realist writing. Another notable novelist is Laura Esquivel, whose &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; tells the story of the domestic life of women living on the margins of their families and society. The novel&#x27;s protagonist, Tita, is kept from happiness and marriage by her mother. &quot;Her unrequited love and ostracism from the family lead her to harness her extraordinary powers of imbuing her emotions to the food she makes. In turn, people who eat her food enact her emotions for her. For example, after eating a wedding cake Tita made while suffering from a forbidden love, the guests all suffer from a wave of longing. The Mexican author Juan Rulfo pioneered the exposition through a non-linear structure with his short novel &quot;Pedro Páramo&quot; that tells the story of Comala both as a lively town in times of the eponymous Pedro Páramo and as a ghost town through the eyes of his son Juan Preciado who returns to Comala to fulfil a promise to his dead mother.

In the Portuguese-speaking world, Jorge Amado and Nobel prize-winning novelist José Saramago are some of the most famous authors of magic realism. Less well-known figures may include Murilo Rubião, playwright Dias Gomes (), and José J. Veiga. , a novel by Erico Verrissimo, is also included, even though the author is not. Amado remains the best known of modern Brazilian writers, with his work having been translated into some 49 languages. He is the most adapted Brazilian author in cinema, theater, and television, notably Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands in 1976 and the American remake &quot;Kiss Me Goodbye&quot; in 1982. Angolan author Ondjaki&#x27;s novel &quot;Transparent City&quot; is an example of magical realism in African literature. &quot;Transparent City&quot; won the José Saramago Prize in 2013.

In the English-speaking world, major authors include: British-Indian writer Salman Rushdie, whose &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot; mixes history and fantasy; African American novelists Toni Morrison (although she has contested this descriptor of her work) and Gloria Naylor; American Latino writers such as Ana Castillo, Rudolfo Anaya, Daniel Olivas, Rudy Ruiz, and Helena Maria Viramontes; Guatemalan author Miguel Ángel Asturias; Native American authors Louise Erdrich and Sherman Alexie; English author Louis de Bernières; and English feminist writer Angela Carter. Perhaps the best known is Rushdie, whose &quot;language form of magical realism straddles both the surrealist tradition of magic realism as it developed in Europe and the mythic tradition of magical realism as it developed in Latin America&quot;. Morrison&#x27;s most notable work, &quot;Beloved&quot;, tells the story of a mother who, haunted by the ghost of her child, learns to cope with memories of her traumatic childhood as an abused slave and the burden of nurturing children into a harsh and brutal society. The Welsh author Glyn Jones&#x27;s novel &quot;The Island of Apples&quot; (1965) is often overlooked, perhaps because it appeared before the term &#x27;magic realism&#x27; was commonly known in English, perhaps because too much was made of the supposed influence of Jones&#x27;s friend Dylan Thomas on his work, but this phantasmagorical blend of reality and myth with a twelve-year-old narrator set in a dreamlike version of the early 20th century clearly merits inclusion in the genre. Jonathan Safran Foer uses magical realism in exploring the history of the stetl and Holocaust in &quot;Everything Is Illuminated&quot;. The South African-Italian author Patricia Schonstein uses magic realism in examining the Holocaust, the Rhodesian War and apartheid in &quot;A Time of Angels&quot; and &quot;A Quilt of Dreams&quot;.

Dino Buzzati&#x27;s novels and short stories are often cited as examples of magic realism in Italian literature.

In Norway, the writers Erik Fosnes Hansen, Jan Kjærstad and the young novelist Rune Salvesen have marked themselves as premier writers of magical realism, something that has been seen as very un-Norwegian.

Dimitris Lyacos&#x27;s Poena Damni trilogy, originally written in Greek, is also seen as displaying characteristics of magic realism in its simultaneous fusion of real and unreal situations in the same narrative context.

In Kannada literature, Shivaram Karanth&#x27;s Jnanpith award winning novel and Devanur Mahadeva&#x27;s Kendra Sahitya Akademi award winning novel are two prominent works that dabbled in magical realism. Both the works are widely read and have been adapted into a movie and a limited TV series, respectively. is a novel that traces the evolution of &#x27;gods&#x27; in a grounded setting via Mookajji&#x27;s (the main character) preternatural ability to touch and see everything an inanimate object has witnessed in its entire existence. The novel blends magical realism and surrealism while telling the story of lives of people from the oppressed castes in rural parts of Karnataka.

===Historical development===


The painterly style began evolving as early as the first decade of the 20th century, but 1925 was when and were officially recognized as major trends. This was the year that Franz Roh published his book on the subject, (&quot;Post-Expressionism, Magical Realism: Problems of the Newest European Painting&quot;) and Gustav Hartlaub curated the seminal exhibition on the theme, entitled simply (translated as &quot;New Objectivity&quot;), at the in Mannheim, Germany. Guenther refers most frequently to the New Objectivity, rather than magical realism, which is attributed to that New objectivity is practical based, referential (to real practicing artists), while the magical realism is theoretical or critic&#x27;s rhetoric. Eventually under Massimo Bontempelli guidance, the term &#x27;magic realism&#x27; was fully embraced by the German as well as in Italian practicing communities.

New Objectivity saw an utter rejection of the preceding impressionist and expressionist movements, and Hartlaub curated his exhibition under the guideline: only those &quot;who have remained true or have returned to a positive, palpable reality in order to reveal the truth of the times&quot; would be included. The style was roughly divided into two subcategories: conservative, (neo-)classicist painting, and generally left-wing, politically motivated Verists. The following quote by Hartlaub distinguishes the two, though mostly with reference to Germany; however, one might apply the logic to all relevant European countries.

Both sides were seen all over Europe during the 1920s and 1930s, ranging from the Netherlands to Austria, France to Russia, with Germany and Italy as centers of growth. Indeed, Italian Giorgio de Chirico, producing works in the late 1910s under the style (translated as &quot;Metaphysical art&quot;), is seen as a precursor and as having an &quot;influence ... greater than any other painter on the artists of New Objectivity.&quot;

Further afield, American painters were later (in the 1940s and 1950s, mostly) coined magical realists; a link between these artists and the Neue Sachlichkeit of the 1920s was explicitly made in the New York Museum of Modern Art exhibition, tellingly titled &quot;American Realists and Magic Realists&quot;. French magical realist Pierre Roy, who worked and showed successfully in the US, is cited as having &quot;helped spread Franz Roh&#x27;s formulations&quot; to the United States.

===Excluding the overtly fantastic===
When art critic Franz Roh applied the term &quot;magic realism&quot; to visual art in 1925, he was designating a style of visual art that brings extreme realism to the depiction of mundane subject matter, revealing an &quot;interior&quot; mystery, rather than imposing external, overtly magical features onto this everyday reality. Roh explains:

In painting, &#x27;magical realism&#x27; is a term often interchanged with post-expressionism, as Ríos also shows, for the very title of Roh&#x27;s 1925 essay was &quot;Post-Expressionism, Magical Realism&quot;. Indeed, as Lois Parkinson Zamora of the University of Houston writes, &quot;Roh, in his 1925 essay, described a group of painters whom we now categorize generally as Post-Expressionists.&quot;

Roh used this term to describe painting that signaled a return to realism after expressionism&#x27;s extravagances, which sought to redesign objects to reveal the spirits of those objects. Magical realism, according to Roh, instead faithfully portrays the exterior of an object, and in doing so the spirit, or magic, of the object reveals itself. One could relate this exterior magic all the way back to the 15th century. Flemish painter Van Eyck (1395–1441) highlights the complexity of a natural landscape by creating illusions of continuous and unseen areas that recede into the background, leaving it to the viewer&#x27;s imagination to fill in those gaps in the image: for instance, in a rolling landscape with river and hills. The magic is contained in the viewer&#x27;s interpretation of those mysterious unseen or hidden parts of the image.
Other important aspects of magical realist painting, according to Roh, include:
* A return to ordinary subjects as opposed to fantastical ones.
* A juxtaposition of forward movement with a sense of distance, as opposed to Expressionism&#x27;s tendency to foreshorten the subject.
* A use of miniature details even in expansive paintings, such as large landscapes.

The pictorial ideals of Roh&#x27;s original magic realism attracted new generations of artists through the latter years of the 20th century and beyond. In a 1991 &quot;New York Times&quot; review, critic Vivien Raynor remarked that &quot;John Stuart Ingle proves that Magic Realism lives&quot; in his &quot;virtuoso&quot; still life watercolors. Ingle&#x27;s approach, as described in his own words, reflects the early inspiration of the magic realism movement as described by Roh; that is, the aim is not to add magical elements to a realistic painting, but to pursue a radically faithful rendering of reality; the &quot;magic&quot; effect on the viewer comes from the intensity of that effort: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to make arbitrary changes in what I see to paint the picture, I want to paint what is given. The whole idea is to take something that&#x27;s given and explore that reality as intensely as I can.&quot;

===Later development: incorporating the fantastic===
While Ingle represents a &quot;magic realism&quot; that harks back to Roh&#x27;s ideas, the term &quot;magic realism&quot; in mid-20th century visual art tends to refer to work that incorporates overtly fantastic elements, somewhat in the manner of its literary counterpart.

Occupying an intermediate place in this line of development, the work of several European and American painters whose most important work dates from the 1930s through to the 1950s, including Bettina Shaw-Lawrence, Paul Cadmus, Ivan Albright, Philip Evergood, George Tooker, Ricco, even Andrew Wyeth, such as in his well-known work Christina&#x27;s World, is designated as &quot;magic realist&quot;. This work departs sharply from Roh&#x27;s definition, in that it (according to &quot;Artcyclopedia&quot;) &quot;is anchored in everyday reality, but has overtones of fantasy or wonder&quot;. In the work of Cadmus, for example, the surreal atmosphere is sometimes achieved via stylized distortions or exaggerations that are not realistic.

Recent &quot;magic realism&quot; has gone beyond mere &quot;overtones&quot; of the fantastic or surreal to depict a frankly magical reality, with an increasingly tenuous anchoring in &quot;everyday reality&quot;. Artists associated with this kind of magic realism include Marcela Donoso and Gregory Gillespie.

Artists such as Peter Doig, Richard T. Scott and Will Teather have become associated with the term in the early 21st century.

==Film and television==

Magical realism is not a clearly defined film genre, but characteristics of magic realism present in literature can also be found in many moving pictures with fantasy elements. These characteristics may be presented matter-of-factly and occur without explanation.

Many films have magical realist narrative and events that contrast between real and magical elements, or different modes of production. This device explores the reality of what exists. Fredric Jameson, in &quot;On Magic Realism in Film&quot;, advances a hypothesis that magical realism in film is a formal mode that is constitutionally dependent on a type of historical raw material in which disjunction is structurally present. &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; (1992) begins and ends with the first person narrative to establish the magical realism storytelling frame. Telling a story from a child&#x27;s point of view, the historical gaps and holes perspective, and with cinematic color heightening the presence, are magical realist tools in films.

A number of films by Woody Allen including &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot; (2011) feature magical realist elements. Most of the films directed by Terry Gilliam are strongly influenced by magic realism; the animated films of Satoshi Kon and Hayao Miyazaki often utilize magic realism; and some of the films of Emir Kusturica contain elements of magical realism, the most notable of which is &quot;Time of the Gypsies&quot; (1988).

==Video games and new media==

In his essay &quot;Half-Real&quot;, MIT professor and ludologist Jesper Juul argues that the intrinsic nature of video games is magic realist. Early video games such as the 1986 text adventure &quot;Trinity&quot; combined elements of science fiction, fantasy and magic realism. Point-and-click adventure games such as &quot;Kentucky Route Zero&quot; (2013) and &quot;Memoranda&quot; (2017) have also embraced the genre. The &quot;Metal Gear&quot; franchise has also frequently been cited as a notable example of magic realism, because of its combination of realistic military fiction with supernatural elements.

In electronic literature, early author Michael Joyce&#x27;s &quot;afternoon, a story&quot; deploys the ambiguity and dubious narrator characteristic of high modernism, along with some suspense and romance elements, in a story whose meaning could change dramatically depending on the path taken through its lexias on each reading.

<text>Penstemon , the beardtongues, is a large genus of roughly 280 species of flowering plants native to North America from northern Canada to Central America. It is the largest genus of flowering plants endemic to North America. As well as being the scientific name, penstemon is also widely used as a common name for all &quot;Penstemon&quot; species alongside beardtongues.

Formerly placed in the family Scrophulariaceae by the Cronquist system, new genetic research has placed it in the vastly expanded family Plantaginaceae. The total number of species is uncertain due to on going research into if some of the named species are actually subspecies or misidentifications of already identified species.

==Description==

They have opposite leaves, partly tube-shaped, and two-lipped flowers and seed capsules. The most distinctive feature of the genus is the prominent staminode, an infertile stamen. The staminode takes a variety of forms in the different species; while it is typically a long straight filament extending to the mouth of the corolla, some are longer and extremely hairy, giving the general appearance of an open mouth with a fuzzy tongue protruding and inspiring the common name of &quot;beardtongue&quot;.

Most penstemons form a durable woody stem (a caudex) and have persistent basal leaves, but some are fully deciduous perennials, the remainder being shrubs or subshrubs. Heights can range from 10 cm to as much as 3 meters. Along with their variable growth forms the penstemons have highly variable leaves, often with different leaf shapes on different parts of the same plant. Some species have highly reduced needle like leaves and others broad and rounded leaves, with their texture also running the range of hairy to smooth/glaborous. In the view of penstemon expert Robert Nold the defining evolutionary characteristic of the genus is adaptation to drought, as demonstrated by their numbers and diversity in the interior west of North America.

The distinctive flowers have fused petals shaped like a funnel or tube. At the opening of the flowers the petals are , with a larger lip with three lobes towards the bottom of the flower and the smaller on the upper side with two lobes. Floral colors are quite varied with white, blue, violet, purple, pink, magenta, and red all being common. Much more rarely they may be yellow, though often only a pale shade of cream or ivory. The most frequent colors are shades of blue. The inside of the flowers and lips are very often marked by nectar guides in a distinctive hue and the interior of the flower may also be a different color than the exterior.

The one Asiatic species previously treated in &quot;Penstemon&quot; is now placed in a separate genus &quot;Pennellianthus&quot;. This leaves &quot;Penstemon&quot; a mostly Nearctic genus, with a few neotropical species. Although widespread across North America, and found in habitats ranging from open desert to moist forests, and up to the alpine zone, they are not typically common within their range.

==Taxonomy==
The &quot;Penstemon&quot; genus is placed in the large plantain family, Plantaginaceae, alongside others in tribe Cheloneae. Prior to 2005 they had usually been included in the figwort family, Scrophulariaceae.

&quot;Penstemon&quot; has been subdivided into six subgenera by using anther dehiscence patterns. Subgenera &quot;Cryptostemon&quot; and &quot;Dissecti&quot; each contain one species. As traditionally defined subgenus &quot;Penstemon&quot; contains about 128 species, subgenus &quot;Habroanthus&quot; contains about 50, subgenus &quot;Saccanthera&quot; has about 28 species, and subgenus &quot;Dasanthera&quot; contains nine. Genetic analysis by Andrea D Wolfe et al. indicates that while some of the previously identified subgenera are natural groupings, many are hopelessly confused. Garden experiments by Glen Moore and other scientists have shown that even very distantly related species in the genus are capable of hybridizing. However, due to geographic isolation and soil preferences keeping species apart hybrids are rare in nature.

===History===
John Mitchell published the first scientific description in 1748; although he only named it as &quot;Penstemon&quot;, researchers David Way, Peter James, and Robert Nold identify it as &quot;Penstemon laevigatus&quot;. Linnaeus then included it in his 1753 publication, as &quot;Chelone pentstemon&quot;, altering the spelling to better correspond to the notion that the name referred to the unusual fifth stamen (Greek &quot;penta-&quot;, five). The botanist Casimir Schmidel published a description of the species in 1763, and for this reason he is given priority in botanical publication. Mitchell&#x27;s work was reprinted in 1769, continuing with his original spelling, and this was ultimately accepted as the official form, although &quot;Pentstemon&quot; continued in use into the 20th century. In addition, a rare spelling of &quot;Pentastemon&quot; is occasionally found in older works.

Although several more species were found in the early 18th century, they continued to be classified in &quot;Chelone&quot; until 1828 in some publications. The period of 1810 to 1850 increased the number of known species from 4 to 63, as expeditions traveled through Mexico and the western United States, followed by another 100 up to 1900, although not all these species remained classified as &quot;Penstemon&quot;.

The American members of the genus were extensively revised by David D. Keck between 1932 and 1957 and Richard Straw did similar work on the Mexican species slightly later. In 1960 the important book &quot;Penstemon Nomenclature&quot; was published by American Penstemon Society president Ralph Bennett with the advice of Keck. This book was updated and republished with the Robin Lodewick in 1980 and continued to be an important source of information about the genus through the year 2000.

Fieldwork in the remote parts of the Great Basin during the 20th century brought the total number of species known to over 270, though some of this total may be errors or now extinct species.

===Species===
There are at least 281 species that are valid according to both World Flora Online (WFO) and Plants of the World Online (POWO) as of 2024. In addition there are at least five naturally occurring hybrids, and seven recognized by POWO. In addition there are five other additional species that are recognized by WFO. Though there is agreement between POWO and WFO on many species, many additional species are considered valid by other sources. For example there are 239 with full descriptions in the Flora of North America alone.

==Distribution==
Penstemon species are found in most of North America. One species, &quot;Penstemon gentianoides&quot;, grows as far south as Guatemala naturally and has been introduced to Costa Rica. Another species, &quot;Penstemon gormanii&quot;, grows in the Northwest Territories of Canada. No members of the genus grow natively in Nunavut, or east of Quebec in Canada. In addition to the same species as found in the Northwest Territories, two others also grow in parts of Alaska, &quot;Penstemon procerus&quot; and &quot;Penstemon serrulatus&quot;. Most of its species are found in the Nearctic botanical realm, but with a few species also found in the North American portion of the Neotropics. There are 70 species found in the state of Utah, more than anywhere else in its range and making this its center of diversity.

==Horticulture==
Although penstemons are native to the Americas, Europe has traditionally been far more active in their hybridization with hundreds of hybrids developed since the early 19th century. The first offer of seeds for sale as by John Fraser in 1813. The earliest development is somewhat shrouded in mystery; for instance Flanagan &amp; Nutting&#x27;s 1835 catalog mentions a &#x27;Penstemon Hybridum&#x27; but does not describe it.

By 1860, a half-dozen French growers are known to have developed hybrids, most notably Victor Lemoine, while in 1857 the German Wilhelm Pfitzer listed 24 varieties. In 1861 the British Royal Horticultural Society held trials in which 78 varieties were entered. The Scottish firm of John Forbes first offered penstemons in 1870, eventually becoming the biggest grower in the world; in 1884 their catalog listed 180 varieties. By 1900 Forbes had offered 550 varieties, while Lemoine had developed nearly 470 by the time of his death in 1911. Few of these have survived to the present day.

A number of different species have been used in the hybridization process, notably &quot;Penstemon cobaea&quot; and &quot;Penstemon hartwegii&quot;.

The American Penstemon Society was formed in 1946 to promote both horticultural and botanical interest, and is now the International Cultivar Registration Authority for the genus.

In North America, penstemons are often used in xeriscape gardening, as many are native to desert or alpine regions and quite hardy.

<doc id="144143" wikidata="Q422819" url="?curid=144143" title="Gallium arsenide">
<text>[[Gallium]] [[arsenide]] (GaAs) is a III-V direct band gap semiconductor with a zinc blende crystal structure.

Gallium arsenide is used in the manufacture of devices such as microwave frequency integrated circuits, monolithic microwave integrated circuits, infrared light-emitting diodes, laser diodes, solar cells and optical windows.

GaAs is often used as a substrate material for the epitaxial growth of other III-V semiconductors, including indium gallium arsenide, aluminum gallium arsenide and others.

== History ==
Gallium arsenide was first synthesized and studied by Victor Goldschmidt in 1926 by passing arsenic vapors mixed with hydrogen over gallium(III) oxide at 600 °C. The semiconductor properties of GaAs and other III-V compounds were patented by Heinrich Welker at Siemens-Schuckert in 1951 and described in a 1952 publication. Commercial production of its monocrystals commenced in 1954, and more studies followed in the 1950s. First infrared LEDs were made in 1962.

==Preparation and chemistry==
In the compound, gallium has a +3 oxidation state. Gallium arsenide single crystals can be prepared by three industrial processes:
* The vertical gradient freeze (VGF) process.
* Crystal growth using a horizontal zone furnace in the Bridgman-Stockbarger technique, in which gallium and arsenic vapors react, and free molecules deposit on a seed crystal at the cooler end of the furnace.
* Liquid encapsulated Czochralski (LEC) growth is used for producing high-purity single crystals that can exhibit semi-insulating characteristics (see below). Most GaAs wafers are produced using this process.

Alternative methods for producing films of GaAs include:
* VPE reaction of gaseous gallium metal and arsenic trichloride: 2 Ga + 2 → 2 GaAs + 3 
* MOCVD reaction of trimethylgallium and arsine: + → GaAs + 3 
* Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) of gallium and arsenic: 4 Ga + → 4 GaAs or 2 Ga + → 2 GaAs

Oxidation of GaAs occurs in air, degrading performance of the semiconductor. The surface can be passivated by depositing a cubic gallium(II) sulfide layer using a tert-butyl gallium sulfide compound such as (.

===Semi-insulating crystals===
In the presence of excess arsenic, GaAs boules grow with crystallographic defects; specifically, arsenic antisite defects (an arsenic atom at a gallium atom site within the crystal lattice). The electronic properties of these defects (interacting with others) cause the Fermi level to be pinned to near the center of the band gap, so that this GaAs crystal has very low concentration of electrons and holes. This low carrier concentration is similar to an intrinsic (perfectly undoped) crystal, but much easier to achieve in practice. These crystals are called &quot;semi-insulating&quot;, reflecting their high resistivity of 107–109 Ω·cm (which is quite high for a semiconductor, but still much lower than a true insulator like glass).

===Etching===
Wet etching of GaAs industrially uses an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide or bromine water, and the same strategy has been described in a patent relating to processing scrap components containing GaAs where the is complexed with a hydroxamic acid (&quot;HA&quot;), for example:
:GaAs + + &quot;HA&quot; → &quot;GaA&quot; complex + + 4 
This reaction produces arsenic acid.

==Electronics==
===GaAs digital logic===
GaAs can be used for various transistor types:
* Metal–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MESFET)
* High-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT)
* Junction field-effect transistor (JFET)
* Heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT)
* Metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET)

The HBT can be used in integrated injection logic (I2L).

The earliest GaAs logic gate used Buffered FET Logic (BFL).

From to 1995 the main logic families used were:
* Source-coupled FET logic (SCFL) fastest and most complex, (used by TriQuint &amp; Vitesse)
* Capacitor–diode FET logic (CDFL) (used by Cray for Cray-3)
* Direct-coupled FET logic (DCFL) simplest and lowest power (used by Vitesse for VLSI gate arrays)

===Comparison with silicon for electronics===
====GaAs advantages====
Some electronic properties of gallium arsenide are superior to those of silicon. It has a higher saturated electron velocity and higher electron mobility, allowing gallium arsenide transistors to function at frequencies in excess of 250 GHz. GaAs devices are relatively insensitive to overheating, owing to their wider energy band gap, and they also tend to create less noise (disturbance in an electrical signal) in electronic circuits than silicon devices, especially at high frequencies. This is a result of higher carrier mobilities and lower resistive device parasitics. These superior properties are compelling reasons to use GaAs circuitry in mobile phones, satellite communications, microwave point-to-point links and higher frequency radar systems. It is also used in the manufacture of Gunn diodes for the generation of microwaves.

Another advantage of GaAs is that it has a direct band gap, which means that it can be used to absorb and emit light efficiently. Silicon has an indirect band gap and so is relatively poor at emitting light.

As a wide direct band gap material with resulting resistance to radiation damage, GaAs is an excellent material for outer space electronics and optical windows in high power applications.

Because of its wide band gap, pure GaAs is highly resistive. Combined with a high dielectric constant, this property makes GaAs a very good substrate for integrated circuits and unlike Si provides natural isolation between devices and circuits. This has made it an ideal material for monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs), where active and essential passive components can readily be produced on a single slice of GaAs.

One of the first GaAs microprocessors was developed in the early 1980s by the RCA Corporation and was considered for the Star Wars program of the United States Department of Defense. These processors were several times faster and several orders of magnitude more radiation resistant than their silicon counterparts, but were more expensive. Other GaAs processors were implemented by the supercomputer vendors Cray Computer Corporation, Convex, and Alliant in an attempt to stay ahead of the ever-improving CMOS microprocessor. Cray eventually built one GaAs-based machine in the early 1990s, the Cray-3, but the effort was not adequately capitalized, and the company filed for bankruptcy in 1995.

Complex layered structures of gallium arsenide in combination with aluminium arsenide (AlAs) or the alloy AlxGa1−xAs can be grown using molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) or using metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE). Because GaAs and AlAs have almost the same lattice constant, the layers have very little induced strain, which allows them to be grown almost arbitrarily thick. This allows extremely high performance and high electron mobility HEMT transistors and other quantum well devices.

GaAs is used for monolithic radar power amplifiers (but GaN can be less susceptible to heat damage).

====Silicon advantages====
Silicon has three major advantages over GaAs for integrated circuit manufacture. First, silicon is abundant and cheap to process in the form of silicate minerals. The economies of scale available to the silicon industry has also hindered the adoption of GaAs.

In addition, a Si crystal has a very stable structure and can be grown to very large diameter boules and processed with very good yields. It is also a fairly good thermal conductor, thus enabling very dense packing of transistors that need to get rid of their heat of operation, all very desirable for design and manufacturing of very large ICs. Such good mechanical characteristics also make it a suitable material for the rapidly developing field of nanoelectronics. Naturally, a GaAs surface cannot withstand the high temperatures needed for diffusion; however a viable and actively pursued alternative as of the 1980s was ion implantation.

The second major advantage of Si is the existence of a native oxide (silicon dioxide, SiO2), which is used as an insulator. Silicon dioxide can be incorporated onto silicon circuits easily, and such layers are adherent to the underlying silicon. SiO2 is not only a good insulator (with a band gap of 8.9 eV), but the Si-SiO2 interface can be easily engineered to have excellent electrical properties, most importantly low density of interface states. GaAs does not have a native oxide, does not easily support a stable adherent insulating layer, and does not possess the dielectric strength or surface passivating qualities of the Si-SiO2.

Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) has been extensively studied as a possible gate oxide for GaAs (as well as InGaAs).

The third advantage of silicon is that it possesses a higher hole mobility compared to GaAs (500 versus 400 cm2V−1s−1). This high mobility allows the fabrication of higher-speed P-channel field-effect transistors, which are required for CMOS logic. Because they lack a fast CMOS structure, GaAs circuits must use logic styles which have much higher power consumption; this has made GaAs logic circuits unable to compete with silicon logic circuits.

For manufacturing solar cells, silicon has relatively low absorptivity for sunlight, meaning about 100 micrometers of Si is needed to absorb most sunlight. Such a layer is relatively robust and easy to handle. In contrast, the absorptivity of GaAs is so high that only a few micrometers of thickness are needed to absorb all of the light. Consequently, GaAs thin films must be supported on a substrate material.

Silicon is a pure element, avoiding the problems of stoichiometric imbalance and thermal unmixing of GaAs.

Silicon has a nearly perfect lattice; impurity density is very low and allows very small structures to be built (down to 5 nm in commercial production as of 2020). In contrast, GaAs has a very high impurity density, which makes it difficult to build integrated circuits with small structures, so the 500 nm process is a common process for GaAs.

Silicon has about three times the thermal conductivity of GaAs, with less risk of local overheating in high power devices.

==Other applications==
===Transistor uses===
Gallium arsenide (GaAs) transistors are used in the RF power amplifiers for cell phones and wireless communicating. GaAs wafers are used in laser diodes, photodetectors, and radio frequency (RF) amplifiers for mobile phones and base stations. GaAs transistors are also integral to monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs), utilized in satellite communication and radar systems, as well as in low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) that enhance weak signals.

===Solar cells and detectors===
Gallium arsenide is an important semiconductor material for high-cost, high-efficiency solar cells and is used for single-crystalline thin-film solar cells and for multi-junction solar cells.

The first known operational use of GaAs solar cells in space was for the Venera 3 mission, launched in 1965. The GaAs solar cells, manufactured by Kvant, were chosen because of their higher performance in high temperature environments. GaAs cells were then used for the Lunokhod rovers for the same reason.

In 1970, the GaAs heterostructure solar cells were developed by the team led by Zhores Alferov in the USSR, achieving much higher efficiencies. In the early 1980s, the efficiency of the best GaAs solar cells surpassed that of conventional, crystalline silicon-based solar cells. In the 1990s, GaAs solar cells took over from silicon as the cell type most commonly used for photovoltaic arrays for satellite applications. Later, dual- and triple-junction solar cells based on GaAs with germanium and indium gallium phosphide layers were developed as the basis of a triple-junction solar cell, which held a record efficiency of over 32% and can operate also with light as concentrated as 2,000 suns. This kind of solar cell powered the Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which explored Mars&#x27; surface. Also many solar cars utilize GaAs in solar arrays, as did the Hubble Telescope.

GaAs-based devices hold the world record for the highest-efficiency single-junction solar cell at 29.1% (as of 2019). This high efficiency is attributed to the extreme high quality GaAs epitaxial growth, surface passivation by the AlGaAs, and the promotion of photon recycling by the thin film design. GaAs-based photovoltaics are also responsible for the highest efficiency (as of 2022) of conversion of light to electricity, as researchers from the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems achieved a 68.9% efficiency when exposing a GaAs thin film photovoltaic cell to monochromatic laser light with a wavelength of 858 nanometers.

Today, multi-junction GaAs cells have the highest efficiencies of existing photovoltaic cells and trajectories show that this is likely to continue to be the case for the foreseeable future. In 2022, Rocket Lab unveiled a solar cell with 33.3% efficiency based on inverted metamorphic multi-junction (IMM) technology. In IMM, the lattice-matched (same lattice parameters) materials are grown first, followed by mismatched materials. The top cell, GaInP, is grown first and lattice matched to the GaAs substrate, followed by a layer of either GaAs or GaInAs with a minimal mismatch, and the last layer has the greatest lattice mismatch. After growth, the cell is mounted to a secondary handle and the GaAs substrate is removed. A main advantage of the IMM process is that the inverted growth according to lattice mismatch allows a path to higher cell efficiency.

Complex designs of AlxGa1−xAs-GaAs devices using quantum wells can be sensitive to infrared radiation (QWIP).

GaAs diodes can be used for the detection of X-rays.

==== Future outlook of GaAs solar cells ====
Despite GaAs-based photovoltaics being the clear champions of efficiency for solar cells, they have relatively limited use in today&#x27;s market. In both world electricity generation and world electricity generating capacity, solar electricity is growing faster than any other source of fuel (wind, hydro, biomass, and so on) for the last decade. However, GaAs solar cells have not currently been adopted for widespread solar electricity generation. This is largely due to the cost of GaAs solar cells - in space applications, high performance is required and the corresponding high cost of the existing GaAs technologies is accepted. For example, GaAs-based photovoltaics show the best resistance to gamma radiation and high temperature fluctuations, which are of great importance for spacecraft. But in comparison to other solar cells, III-V solar cells are two to three orders of magnitude more expensive than other technologies such as silicon-based solar cells. The primary sources of this cost are the epitaxial growth costs and the substrate the cell is deposited on.

GaAs solar cells are most commonly fabricated utilizing epitaxial growth techniques such as metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE). A significant reduction in costs for these methods would require improvements in tool costs, throughput, material costs, and manufacturing efficiency. Increasing the deposition rate could reduce costs, but this cost reduction would be limited by the fixed times in other parts of the process such as cooling and heating.

The substrate used to grow these solar cells is usually germanium or gallium arsenide which are notably expensive materials. One of the main pathways to reduce substrate costs is to reuse the substrate. An early method proposed to accomplish this is epitaxial lift-off (ELO), but this method is time-consuming, somewhat dangerous (with its use of hydrofluoric acid), and requires multiple post-processing steps. However, other methods have been proposed that use phosphide-based materials and hydrochloric acid to achieve ELO with surface passivation and minimal post-etching residues and allows for direct reuse of the GaAs substrate. There is also preliminary evidence that spalling could be used to remove the substrate for reuse. An alternative path to reduce substrate cost is to use cheaper materials, although materials for this application are not currently commercially available or developed.

Yet another consideration to lower GaAs solar cell costs could be concentrator photovoltaics. Concentrators use lenses or parabolic mirrors to focus light onto a solar cell, and thus a smaller (and therefore less expensive) GaAs solar cell is needed to achieve the same results. Concentrator systems have the highest efficiency of existing photovoltaics.

So, technologies such as concentrator photovoltaics and methods in development to lower epitaxial growth and substrate costs could lead to a reduction in the cost of GaAs solar cells and forge a path for use in terrestrial applications.

===Light-emission devices===
GaAs has been used to produce near-infrared laser diodes since 1962. It is often used in alloys with other semiconductor compounds for these applications.

&quot;N&quot;-type GaAs doped with silicon donor atoms (on Ga sites) and boron acceptor atoms (on As sites) responds to ionizing radiation by emitting scintillation photons. At cryogenic temperatures it is among the brightest scintillators known and is a promising candidate for detecting rare electronic excitations from interacting dark matter, due to the following six essential factors:
# Silicon donor electrons in GaAs have a binding energy that is among the lowest of all known &quot;n&quot;-type semiconductors. Free electrons above per cm3 are not “frozen out&quot; and remain delocalized at cryogenic temperatures.
# Boron and gallium are group III elements, so boron as an impurity primarily occupies the gallium site. However, a sufficient number occupy the arsenic site and act as acceptors that efficiently trap ionization event holes from the valence band.
# After trapping an ionization event hole from the valence band, the boron acceptors can combine radiatively with delocalized donor electrons to produce photons 0.2 eV below the cryogenic band-gap energy (1.52 eV). This is an efficient radiative process that produces scintillation photons that are not absorbed by the GaAs crystal.
# There is no afterglow, because metastable radiative centers are quickly annihilated by the delocalized electrons. This is evidenced by the lack of thermally induced luminescence.
# &quot;N&quot;-type GaAs has a high refractive index (~3.5) and the narrow-beam absorption coefficient is proportional to the free electron density and typically several per cm. One would expect that almost all of the scintillation photons should be trapped and absorbed in the crystal, but this is not the case. Recent Monte Carlo and Feynman path integral calculations have shown that the high luminosity could be explained if most of the narrow beam absorption is not absolute absorption but a novel type of optical scattering from the conduction electrons with a cross section of about 5 x 10−18 cm2 that allows scintillation photons to escape total internal reflection. This cross section is about 107 times larger than Thomson scattering but comparable to the optical cross section of the conduction electrons in a metal mirror.
# &quot;N&quot;-type GaAs(Si,B) is commercially grown as 10 kg crystal ingots and sliced into thin wafers as substrates for electronic circuits. Boron oxide is used as an encapsulant to prevent the loss of arsenic during crystal growth, but also has the benefit of providing boron acceptors for scintillation.

===Fiber optic temperature measurement===
For this purpose an optical fiber tip of an optical fiber temperature sensor is equipped with a gallium arsenide crystal. Starting at a light wavelength of 850 nm GaAs becomes optically translucent. Since the spectral position of the band gap is temperature dependent, it shifts about 0.4 nm/K. The measurement device contains a light source and a device for the spectral detection of the band gap. With the changing of the band gap, (0.4 nm/K) an algorithm calculates the temperature (all 250 ms).

===Spin-charge converters===
GaAs may have applications in spintronics as it can be used instead of platinum in spin-charge converters and may be more tunable.

==Safety==
The environment, health and safety aspects of gallium arsenide sources (such as trimethylgallium and arsine) and industrial hygiene monitoring studies of metalorganic precursors have been reported. California lists gallium arsenide as a carcinogen, as do IARC and ECA, and it is considered a known carcinogen in animals. On the other hand, a 2013 review (funded by industry) argued against these classifications, saying that when rats or mice inhale fine GaAs powders (as in previous studies), they get cancer from the resulting lung irritation and inflammation, rather than from a primary carcinogenic effect of the GaAs itself—and that, moreover, fine GaAs powders are unlikely to be created in the production or use of GaAs.

<doc id="144144" wikidata="Q389085" url="?curid=144144" title="List of programming languages by type">
<text>This is a list of notable programming languages, grouped by type.

The groupings are overlapping; not mutually exclusive. A language can be listed in multiple groupings.

== Agent-oriented programming languages ==
Agent-oriented programming allows the developer to build, extend and use software agents, which are abstractions of objects that can message other agents.

* Clojure
* F#
* GOAL
* SARL

== Array languages ==
Array programming (also termed &quot;vector&quot; or &quot;multidimensional&quot;) languages generalize operations on scalars to apply transparently to vectors, matrices, and higher-dimensional arrays.
* A+
* Ada
* Analytica
* APL
* Chapel
* Dartmouth BASIC
* Fortran (As of Fortran 90)
* FreeMat
* GAUSS
* Interactive Data Language (IDL)
* J
* Julia
* K
* MATLAB
* Octave

* Q
* R
* Raku
* S
* Scilab
* S-Lang
* SequenceL
* Speakeasy
* Wolfram Mathematica (Wolfram language)
* X10
* ZPL
== Aspect-oriented programming languages ==
Aspect-oriented programming enables developers to add new functionality to code, known as &quot;advice&quot;, without modifying that code itself; rather, it uses a pointcut to implement the advice into code blocks.

* Ada
* AspectJ
* Groovy
* Nemerle
* Raku

== Assembly languages ==
Assembly languages directly correspond to a machine language (see below), so machine code instructions appear in a form understandable by humans, although there may not be a one-to-one mapping between an individual statement and an individual instruction. Assembly languages let programmers use symbolic addresses, which the assembler converts to absolute or relocatable addresses. Most assemblers also support macros and symbolic constants.

== Authoring languages ==
An authoring language is a programming language designed for use by a non-computer expert to easily create tutorials, websites, and other interactive computer programs.

* Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA)
* Lasso
* PILOT
* TUTOR
* Authorware

== Command-line interface languages ==
Command-line interface (CLI) languages are also called batch languages or job control languages. Examples:
* 4DOS (shell for IBM PCs)
* 4OS2 (shell for IBM PCs)
* bash (the Bourne-Again shell from GNU, Free Software Foundation)
* CLIST (MVS Command List)
* CMS EXEC
* csh and tcsh (by Bill Joy UC Berkeley)
* DIGITAL Command Language CLI for VMS (DEC, Compaq, HP)
* DOS batch language (for IBM PC DOS, pre-Windows)
* EXEC 2
* Expect (a Unix automation and test tool)
* fish (a Unix shell)
* Hamilton C shell (a C shell for Windows)
* ksh (a standard Unix shell, written by David Korn)
* Nushell (a cross-platform shell)
* PowerShell (.NET-based CLI)
* rc (shell for Plan 9)
* Rexx
* sh (standard Unix shell, by Stephen R. Bourne)
* TACL (Tandem Advanced Command Language)
* Windows batch language (input for COMMAND.COM or CMD.EXE)
* zsh (a Unix shell)
== Compiled languages ==

These are languages typically processed by compilers, though theoretically any language can be compiled or interpreted.
* ArkTS
* ActionScript
* Ada (multi-purpose language)
* ALGOL 58
** JOVIAL
** NELIAC
* ALGOL 60 (influential design)
** SMALL a Machine ALGOL
* ALGOL 68
* Ballerina→ bytecode runtime
* BASIC (including the first version of Dartmouth BASIC)
* BCPL
* C (widely used procedural language)
* C++ (multiparadigm language derived from C)
* C# (into CIL runtime)
* Ceylon (into JVM bytecode)
* CHILL
* CLIPPER 5.3 (DOS-based)
* CLEO for Leo computers
* Clojure (into JVM bytecode)
* COBOL

== Concatenative programming languages ==

== Concurrent languages ==

Message passing languages provide language constructs for concurrency. The predominant paradigm for concurrency in mainstream languages such as Java is shared memory concurrency. Concurrent languages that make use of message passing have generally been inspired by process calculi such as communicating sequential processes (CSP) or the π-calculus.
* Ada – multi-purpose language
* Alef – concurrent language with threads and message passing, used for systems programming in early versions of Plan 9 from Bell Labs

* Constraint Handling Rules
* CHIP
* ECLiPSe
* Kaleidoscope
* Raku

== Curly bracket languages ==
A curly bracket or curly brace language has syntax that defines a block as the statements between curly brackets, a.k.a. braces, codice_1. This syntax originated with BCPL (1966), and was popularized by C. Many curly bracket languages descend from or are strongly influenced by C. Examples:
* ABCL/c+
* Alef
* AWK
* ArkTS
* B
* bc

* BMDFM
* Hartmann pipelines

* Gremlin
* MUMPS (an ANSI standard general-purpose language with specializations for database work)

== Decision table languages ==
Decision tables can be used as an aid to clarifying the logic before writing a program in any language, but in the 1960s a number of languages were developed where the main logic is expressed directly in the form of a decision table, including:

* Filetab

== Declarative languages ==
Declarative languages express the logic of a computation without describing its control flow in detail. Declarative programming stands in contrast to imperative programming via imperative programming languages, where control flow is specified by serial orders (imperatives). (Pure) functional and logic-based programming languages are also declarative, and constitute the major subcategories of the declarative category. This section lists additional examples not in those subcategories.

== Embeddable languages ==

=== In source code ===
Source embeddable languages embed small pieces of executable code inside a piece of free-form text, often a web page.

Client-side embedded languages are limited by the abilities of the browser or intended client. They aim to provide dynamism to web pages without the need to recontact the server.

Server-side embedded languages are much more flexible, since almost any language can be built into a server. The aim of having fragments of server-side code embedded in a web page is to generate additional markup dynamically; the code itself disappears when the page is served, to be replaced by its output.

==== Server side ====
* PHP
* VBScript
* Tcl – server-side in NaviServer and an essential component in electronics industry systems
* WebDNA – dedicated to database-driven websites

The above examples are particularly dedicated to this purpose. A large number of other languages, such as Erlang, Scala, Perl, Ring and Ruby can be adapted (for instance, by being made into Apache modules).

==== Client side ====
* ActionScript
* JavaScript (aka ECMAScript or JScript)
* VBScript (Windows only)

=== In object code ===
A wide variety of dynamic or scripting languages can be embedded in compiled executable code. Basically, object code for the language&#x27;s interpreter needs to be linked into the executable. Source code fragments for the embedded language can then be passed to an evaluation function as strings. Application control languages can be implemented this way, if the source code is input by the user. Languages with small interpreters are preferred.

* C
* C++
* Component Pascal
* Forth
* Fortran
* FreeBASIC
* Modula-2
* Oberon
* Pascal
* PL/I
* Zig

=== Languages with optional manual memory management ===
* Ada implementations are not required to offer garbage collection, but the language semantics support it, and many implementations include it.
* Blitz BASIC (also known as BlitzMax) is usually reference-counted, and also supports a garbage collector. However, it also ships with optional utilities for using pointers and for directly allocating and freeing memory.
* COBOL supports pointers and heap allocation as of COBOL 2002, along with a garbage collector.
* Cython provides optional manual memory management by letting the user import codice_2, codice_3, and codice_4 from C, which they can then use in Python code.
* D provides programmers with full control over its own garbage collector, including the ability to disable it outright.
* Nim is usually garbage-collected or reference-counted by default, depending on its configuration, but the programmer may use the switch codice_5 to deallocate memory manually.
* Objective-C and Objective-C++ support optional reference counting and garbage collection as alternatives to manual memory management (Apple deprecated the garbage collector).
* PostScript originally required developers to manually reclaim memory using the codice_6 and codice_7 operators. PostScript Level 2 introduced a garbage collector, but its usage is optional.
* Rust supports optional reference counting, but manual memory management is preferred.
* Scala normally manages the memory automatically in its JVM and JavaScript targets. However, the LLVM-based Scala Native compiler supports the use of pointers, as well as C-style heap allocation (e.g. codice_2, codice_3, codice_4) and stack allocation (codice_11).
* Swift normally uses reference counting, but also allows the user to manually manage the memory using codice_2 and codice_4. On Apple platforms, these functions are imported from the C standard library (which is imported from codice_14, codice_15 or codice_16); on Linux, the developer needs to import codice_17, and codice_18 on Windows.
* V (Vlang) uses GC by default, for user convenience, which can be turned off (-gc none). Users are free to manage memory manually. Can also use autofree (-autofree) or arena allocation (-prealloc). 
* Vala uses reference counting by default, but the user is free to manage the memory manually if they wish.

== Machine languages ==
Machine languages are directly executable by a computer&#x27;s CPU. They are typically formulated as bit patterns, usually represented in octal or hexadecimal. Each bit pattern causes the circuits in the CPU to execute one of the fundamental operations of the hardware. The activation of specific electrical inputs (e.g., CPU package pins for microprocessors), and logical settings for CPU state values, control the processor&#x27;s computation. Individual machine languages are specific to a family of processors; machine-language code for one family of processors cannot run directly on processors in another family unless the processors in question have additional hardware to support it (for example, DEC VAX processors included a PDP-11 compatibility mode). They are (essentially) always defined by the CPU developer, not by 3rd parties. The symbolic version, the processor&#x27;s assembly language, is also defined by the developer, in most cases. Some commonly used machine code instruction sets are:
*RISC-V
* ARM
** Original 32-bit
** 16-bit Thumb instructions (subset of registers used)
** 64-bit (major architecture change)
* DEC:

== Macro languages ==
=== Textual substitution macro languages ===
Macro languages transform one source code file into another. A &quot;macro&quot; is essentially a short piece of text that expands into a longer one (not to be confused with hygienic macros), possibly with parameter substitution. They are often used to preprocess source code. Preprocessors can also supply facilities like file inclusion.

Macro languages may be restricted to acting on specially labeled code regions (pre-fixed with a codice_19 in the case of the C preprocessor). Alternatively, they may not, but in this case it is still often undesirable to (for instance) expand a macro embedded in a string literal, so they still need a rudimentary awareness of syntax. That being the case, they are often still applicable to more than one language. Contrast with source-embeddable languages like PHP, which are fully featured.

* cpp (the C preprocessor)
* m4 (originally from AT&amp;T, bundled with Unix)
* ML/I (general-purpose macro processor)

=== Application macro languages ===
Scripting languages such as Tcl and ECMAScript (ActionScript, ECMAScript for XML, JavaScript, JScript) have been embedded into applications. These are sometimes called &quot;macro languages&quot;, although in a somewhat different sense to textual-substitution macros like m4.

== Metaprogramming languages ==
Metaprogramming is the writing of programs that write or manipulate other programs, including themselves, as their data or that do part of the work that is otherwise done at run time during compile time. In many cases, this allows programmers to get more done in the same amount of time as they would take to write all the code manually.

== Multiparadigm languages ==

Multiparadigm languages support more than one programming paradigm. They allow a program to use more than one programming style. The goal is to allow programmers to use the best tool for a job, admitting that no one paradigm solves all problems in the easiest or most efficient way.

== Object-oriented class-based languages ==
Class-based object-oriented programming languages support objects defined by their class. Class definitions include member data. Message passing is a key concept, if not the main concept, in object-oriented languages.

Polymorphic functions parameterized by the class of some of their arguments are typically called methods. In languages with single dispatch, classes typically also include method definitions. In languages with multiple dispatch, methods are defined by generic functions. There are exceptions where single dispatch methods are generic functions (e.g. Bigloo&#x27;s object system).

== System languages ==
The system programming languages are for low-level tasks like memory management or task management. A system programming language usually refers to a programming language used for system programming; such languages are designed for writing system software, which usually requires different development approaches when compared with application software.

System software is computer software designed to operate and control the computer hardware, and to provide a platform for running application software. System software includes software categories such as operating systems, utility software, device drivers, compilers, and linkers. Examples of system languages include:

== Transformation languages ==

Transformation languages serve the purpose of transforming (translating) source code specified in a certain formal language into a defined destination format code. It is most commonly used in intermediate components of more complex super-systems in order to adopt internal results for input into a succeeding processing routine.

* ATL
* AWK
* MOFM2T
* QVT
* Raku
* XSLT is the best known XML transformation language

<text>This is an index to notable programming languages, in current or historical use. Dialects of BASIC, esoteric programming languages, and markup languages are not included. A programming language does not need to be imperative or Turing-complete, but must be executable and so does not include markup languages such as HTML or XML, but does include domain-specific languages such as SQL and its dialects.

<text>Miscarriage, also known in medical terms as a spontaneous abortion, is an end to pregnancy resulting in the loss and expulsion of an embryo or fetus from the womb before it can survive independently. Miscarriage before 6 weeks of gestation is defined as biochemical loss by ESHRE. Once ultrasound or histological evidence shows that a pregnancy has existed, the term used is clinical miscarriage, which can be &quot;early&quot; (before 12 weeks) or &quot;late&quot; (between 12 and 21 weeks). Spontaneous fetal termination after 20 weeks of gestation is known as a stillbirth. The term &quot;miscarriage&quot; is sometimes used to refer to all forms of pregnancy loss and pregnancy with abortive outcomes before 20 weeks of gestation.

The most common symptom of a miscarriage is vaginal bleeding, with or without pain. Tissue and clot-like material may leave the uterus and pass through and out of the vagina. Risk factors for miscarriage include being an older parent, previous miscarriage, exposure to tobacco smoke, obesity, diabetes, thyroid problems, and drug or alcohol use. About 80% of miscarriages occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy (the first trimester). The underlying cause in about half of cases involves chromosomal abnormalities. Diagnosis of a miscarriage may involve checking to see if the cervix is open or sealed, testing blood levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and an ultrasound. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include an ectopic pregnancy and implantation bleeding.

Prevention is occasionally possible with good prenatal care. Avoiding drugs (including alcohol), infectious diseases, and radiation may decrease the risk of miscarriage. No specific treatment is usually needed during the first 7 to 14 days. Most miscarriages will be completed without additional interventions. Occasionally the medication misoprostol or a procedure such as vacuum aspiration is used to remove the remaining tissue. Women who have a blood type of rhesus negative (Rh negative) may require Rho(D) immune globulin. Pain medication may be beneficial. Emotionally, afterwards, sadness, anxiety or guilt may occur. Emotional support may help with processing the loss.

Miscarriage is the most common complication of early pregnancy. Among women who know they are pregnant, the miscarriage rate is roughly 10% to 20%, while rates among all fertilisation is around 30% to 50%. In those under the age of 35, the risk is about 10% while in those over the age of 40, the risk is about 45%. Risk begins to increase around the age of 30. About 5% of women have two miscarriages in a row. Recurrent miscarriage (also referred to medically as Recurrent Spontaneous Abortion or RSA) may also be considered a form of infertility.

== Terminology ==
Some recommend not using the term &quot;abortion&quot; in discussions with those experiencing a miscarriage to decrease distress. In Britain, the term &quot;miscarriage&quot; has replaced any use of the term &quot;spontaneous abortion&quot; for pregnancy loss and in response to complaints of insensitivity towards women who had suffered such loss. An additional benefit of this change is reducing confusion among medical laymen, who may not realize that the term &quot;spontaneous abortion&quot; refers to a naturally occurring medical phenomenon and not the intentional termination of pregnancy.

The medical terminology applied to experiences during early pregnancy has changed over time. Before the 1980s, health professionals used the phrase &quot;spontaneous abortion&quot; for a miscarriage and &quot;induced abortion&quot; for a termination of the pregnancy. By the 1940s, the popular assumption that an &quot;abortion&quot; was an intentional and immoral or criminal action was sufficiently ingrained that pregnancy books had to explain that &quot;abortion&quot; was the then-popular technical jargon for miscarriages.

In the 1960s, the use of the word &quot;miscarriage&quot; in Britain (instead of &quot;spontaneous abortion&quot;) occurred after changes in legislation. In the late 1980s and 1990s, doctors became more conscious of their language about early pregnancy loss. Some medical authors advocated a change to the use of &quot;miscarriage&quot; instead of &quot;spontaneous abortion&quot; because they argued this would be more respectful and help ease a distressing experience. The change was being recommended in Britain in the late 1990s. In 2005 the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) published a paper aiming to facilitate a revision of nomenclature used to describe early pregnancy events. 

Most affected women and family members refer to miscarriage as the loss of a &quot;baby&quot;, rather than an &quot;embryo&quot; or &quot;fetus&quot;, and healthcare providers are expected to respect and use the language that the person chooses. Clinical terms can suggest blame, increase distress, and even cause anger. Terms that are known to cause distress in those experiencing miscarriage include:
* &quot;abortion&quot; (including &quot;spontaneous abortion&quot;) rather than miscarriage,
* &quot;habitual aborter&quot; rather than a woman experiencing recurrent pregnancy loss,
* &quot;products of conception&quot; rather than baby,
* &quot;blighted ovum&quot; rather than early pregnancy loss or delayed miscarriage,
* &quot;cervical incompetence&quot; rather than cervical weakness, and
* &quot;evacuation of retained products of conception&quot; (ERPC) rather than surgical management of miscarriage.

Using the word &quot;abortion&quot; for an involuntary miscarriage is generally considered confusing, &quot;a dirty word&quot;, &quot;stigmatized&quot;, and &quot;an all-around hated term&quot;.

Pregnancy loss is a broad term that is used for miscarriage, ectopic and molar pregnancies. The term &quot;foetal death&quot; applies variably in different countries and contexts, sometimes incorporating weight, and gestational age from 16 weeks in Norway, 20 weeks in the US and Australia, 24 weeks in the UK to 26 weeks in Italy and Spain. A foetus that died before birth after this gestational age may be referred to as a stillbirth.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs of a miscarriage include vaginal spotting, abdominal pain, cramping, fluid, blood clots, and tissue passing from the vagina. Bleeding can be a symptom of miscarriage, but many women also have bleeding in early pregnancy and do not miscarry. Bleeding during the first half of pregnancy may be referred to as a threatened miscarriage. Of those who seek treatment for bleeding during pregnancy, about half will miscarry. Miscarriage may be detected during an ultrasound exam or through serial human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) testing.

==Risk factors==

Miscarriage may occur for many reasons, not all of which can be identified. Risk factors are those things that increase the likelihood of having a miscarriage but do not necessarily cause a miscarriage. Up to 70 conditions, infections, medical procedures, lifestyle factors, occupational exposures, chemical exposure, and shift work are associated with increased risk for miscarriage. Some of these risks include endocrine, genetic, uterine, or hormonal abnormalities, reproductive tract infections, and tissue rejection caused by an autoimmune disorder.

=== Trimesters ===

====First trimester====
Most clinically apparent miscarriages (two-thirds to three-quarters in various studies) occur during the first trimester. About 30% to 40% of all fertilised eggs miscarry, often before the pregnancy is known. The embryo typically dies before the pregnancy is expelled; bleeding into the decidua basalis and tissue necrosis cause uterine contractions to expel the pregnancy. Early miscarriages can be due to a developmental abnormality of the placenta or other embryonic tissues. In some instances, an embryo does not form but other tissues do. This has been called a &quot;blighted ovum&quot;.

Successful implantation of the zygote into the uterus is most likely eight to ten days after fertilization. If the zygote has not been implanted by day ten, implantation becomes increasingly unlikely in subsequent days.

A chemical pregnancy is a pregnancy that was detected by testing but ends in miscarriage before or around the time of the next expected period.

Chromosomal abnormalities are found in more than half of embryos miscarried in the first 13 weeks. Half of embryonic miscarriages (25% of all miscarriages) have an aneuploidy (abnormal number of chromosomes). Common chromosome abnormalities found in miscarriages include an autosomal trisomy (22–32%), monosomy X (5–20%), triploidy (6–8%), tetraploidy (2–4%), or other structural chromosomal abnormalities (2%). Genetic problems are more likely to occur with older parents; this may account for the higher rates observed in older women.

Luteal phase progesterone deficiency may or may not be a contributing factor to miscarriage.

====Second and third trimesters====
Second-trimester losses may be due to maternal factors such as uterine malformation, growths in the uterus (fibroids), or cervical problems. These conditions also may contribute to premature birth. Unlike first-trimester miscarriages, second-trimester miscarriages are less likely to be caused by a genetic abnormality; chromosomal aberrations are found in a third of cases. Infection during the third trimester can cause a miscarriage.

=== Age ===
Miscarriage is least common for mothers in their twenties, for whom around 12% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. Risk rises with age: around 14% for women aged 30–34; 18% for those 35–39; 37% for those 40–44; and 65% for those over 45. Women younger than 20 have slightly increased miscarriage risk, with around 16% of known pregnancies ending in miscarriage.

Miscarriage risk also rises with paternal age, although the effect is less pronounced than for maternal age. The risk is lowest for men under 40 years old. For men aged 40-44, the risk is around 23% higher. For men over 45, the risk is 43% higher.

===Obesity, eating disorders and caffeine===
Not only is obesity associated with miscarriage; it can result in sub-fertility and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Recurrent miscarriage is also related to obesity. Women with bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa may have a greater risk for miscarriage. Nutrient deficiencies have not been found to impact miscarriage rates but hyperemesis gravidarum sometimes precedes a miscarriage.

Caffeine consumption also has been correlated to miscarriage rates, at least at higher levels of intake. However, such higher rates are statistically significant only in certain circumstances.

Vitamin supplementation has generally not shown to be effective in preventing miscarriage. Chinese traditional medicine has not been found to prevent miscarriage.

===Endocrine disorders===
Disorders of the thyroid may affect pregnancy outcomes. Related to this, iodine deficiency is strongly associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. The risk of miscarriage is increased in those with poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Women with well-controlled diabetes have the same risk of miscarriage as those without diabetes.

===Food poisoning===
Ingesting food that has been contaminated with listeriosis, toxoplasmosis, and salmonella is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage.

===Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling===
Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) are procedures conducted to assess the fetus. A sample of amniotic fluid is obtained by the insertion of a needle through the abdomen and into the uterus. Chorionic villus sampling is a similar procedure with a sample of tissue removed rather than fluid. These procedures are not associated with pregnancy loss during the second trimester but they are associated with miscarriages and birth defects in the first trimester. Miscarriage caused by invasive prenatal diagnosis (chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis) is rare (about 1%).

===Surgery===
The effects of surgery on pregnancy are not well-known including the effects of bariatric surgery. Abdominal and pelvic surgery are not risk factors for miscarriage. Ovarian tumours and cysts that are removed have not been found to increase the risk of miscarriage. The exception to this is the removal of the corpus luteum from the ovary. This can cause fluctuations in the hormones necessary to maintain the pregnancy.

===Medications===
There is no significant association between antidepressant medication exposure and miscarriage. The risk of miscarriage is not likely decreased by discontinuing SSRIs before pregnancy. Some available data suggest that there is a small increased risk of miscarriage for women taking any antidepressant, though this risk becomes less statistically significant when excluding studies of poor quality.

Medicines that increase the risk of miscarriage include:
* retinoids
* nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen
* misoprostol
* methotrexate
* statins

=== Immunisations ===
Immunisations have not been found to cause miscarriage. Live vaccinations, like the MMR vaccine, can theoretically cause damage to the fetus as the live virus can cross the placenta and potentially increase the risk for miscarriage. Therefore, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends against pregnant women receiving live vaccinations. However, there is no clear evidence that has shown live vaccinations increase the risk of miscarriage or fetal abnormalities.

Some live vaccinations include: MMR, varicella, certain types of the influenza vaccine, and rotavirus.

===Treatments for cancer===
Ionising radiation levels given to a woman during cancer treatment cause miscarriage. Exposure can also impact fertility. The use of chemotherapeutic drugs to treat childhood cancer increases the risk of future miscarriage.

===Pre-existing diseases===
Several pre-existing diseases in pregnancy can potentially increase the risk of miscarriage, including diabetes, endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), hypothyroidism, certain infectious diseases, and autoimmune diseases. 
Women with endometriosis report a 76% to 298% increase in miscarriages versus their non-afflicted peers, the range affected by the severity of their disease. PCOS may increase the risk of miscarriage. Two studies suggested treatment with the drug metformin significantly lowers the rate of miscarriage in women with PCOS, but the quality of these studies has been questioned. Metformin treatment in pregnancy is not safe. In 2007, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists also recommended against the use of the drug to prevent miscarriage. Thrombophilias or defects in coagulation and bleeding were once thought to be a risk of miscarriage but have been subsequently questioned. Severe cases of hypothyroidism increase the risk of miscarriage. The effect of milder cases of hypothyroidism on miscarriage rates has not been established. A condition called luteal phase defect (LPD) is a failure of the uterine lining to be fully prepared for pregnancy. This can keep a fertilised egg from implanting or result in miscarriage.

&quot;Mycoplasma genitalium&quot; infection is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth and miscarriage.

Infections can increase the risk of a miscarriage: rubella (German measles), cytomegalovirus, bacterial vaginosis, HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, and malaria.

===Immune status===
Autoimmunity is a possible cause of recurrent or late-term miscarriages. In the case of an autoimmune-induced miscarriage, the woman&#x27;s body attacks the growing fetus or prevents normal pregnancy progression. Autoimmune disease may cause abnormalities in embryos, which in turn may lead to miscarriage. As an example, coeliac disease increases the risk of miscarriage by an odds ratio of approximately 1.4. A disruption in normal immune function can lead to the formation of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. This will affect the ability to continue the pregnancy, and if a woman has repeated miscarriages, she can be tested for it. Approximately 15% of recurrent miscarriages are related to immunologic factors. The presence of anti-thyroid autoantibodies is associated with an increased risk with an odds ratio of 3.73 and 95% confidence interval 1.8–7.6. Having lupus also increases the risk of miscarriage. Immunohistochemical studies on decidual basalis and chorionic villi found that the imbalance of the immunological environment could be associated with recurrent pregnancy loss.

===Anatomical defects and trauma===
Fifteen per cent of women who have experienced three or more recurring miscarriages have some anatomical defect that prevents the pregnancy from being carried for the entire term. The structure of the uterus affects the ability to carry a child to term. Anatomical differences are common and can be congenital.
In some women, cervical incompetence or cervical insufficiency occurs with the inability of the cervix to stay closed during the entire pregnancy. It does not cause first-trimester miscarriages. In the second trimester, it is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. It is identified after a premature birth has occurred at about 16–18 weeks into the pregnancy. During the second trimester, major trauma can result in a miscarriage.

===Smoking===

Tobacco (cigarette) smokers have an increased risk of miscarriage. There is an increased risk regardless of which parent smokes, though the risk is higher when the gestational mother smokes.

===Morning sickness===
Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP, or morning sickness) are associated with a decreased risk. Several possible causes have been suggested for morning sickness but there is still no agreement. NVP may represent a defence mechanism which discourages the mother&#x27;s ingestion of foods that are harmful to the fetus; according to this model, a lower frequency of miscarriage would be an expected consequence of the different food choices made by women experiencing NVP.

===Chemicals and occupational exposure===
Chemical and occupational exposures may have some effect on pregnancy outcomes. A cause-and-effect relationship can almost never be established. Those chemicals that are implicated in increasing the risk for miscarriage are DDT, lead, formaldehyde, arsenic, benzene and ethylene oxide. Video display terminals and ultrasound have not been found affect the rates of miscarriage. In dental offices where nitrous oxide is used with the absence of anaesthetic gas scavenging equipment, there is a greater risk of miscarriage. For women who work with cytotoxic antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agents, there is a small increased risk of miscarriage. No increased risk for cosmetologists has been found.

===Other===
Alcohol increases the risk of miscarriage. Cocaine use increases the rate of miscarriage. Some infections have been associated with miscarriage. These include &quot;Ureaplasma urealyticum&quot;, &quot;Mycoplasma hominis&quot;, group B streptococci, HIV-1, and syphilis. &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot; may increase the risk of miscarriage. Toxoplasmosis can cause a miscarriage. Subclinical infections of the lining of the womb, commonly known as chronic endometritis are also associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, compared to women with treated chronic endometritis or no chronic endometritis.

==Diagnosis==
In the case of blood loss, pain, or both, transvaginal ultrasound is performed. If a viable intrauterine pregnancy is not found with ultrasound, blood tests (serial βHCG tests) can be performed to rule out ectopic pregnancy, which is a life-threatening situation.

If hypotension, tachycardia, and anaemia are discovered, the exclusion of an ectopic pregnancy is important.

A miscarriage may be confirmed by an obstetric ultrasound and by the examination of the passed tissue. When looking for microscopic pathologic symptoms, one looks for the products of conception. Microscopically, these include villi, trophoblast, fetal parts, and background gestational changes in the endometrium. When chromosomal abnormalities are found in more than one miscarriage, genetic testing of both parents may be done.

===Ultrasound criteria===
A review article in &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; based on a consensus meeting of the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound in America (SRU) has suggested that miscarriage should be diagnosed only if any of the following criteria are met upon ultrasonography visualisation:

===Classification===
A threatened miscarriage is any bleeding during the first half of pregnancy. At investigation, it may be found that the fetus remains viable and the pregnancy continues without further problems.

An anembryonic pregnancy (also called an &quot;empty sac&quot; or &quot;blighted ovum&quot;) is a condition where the gestational sac develops normally, while the embryonic part of the pregnancy is either absent or stops growing very early. This accounts for approximately half of miscarriages. All other miscarriages are classified as embryonic miscarriages, meaning that there is an embryo present in the gestational sac. Half of embryonic miscarriages have aneuploidy (an abnormal number of chromosomes).

An inevitable miscarriage occurs when the cervix has already dilated, but the foetus has yet to be expelled. This usually will progress to a complete miscarriage. The foetus may or may not have cardiac activity.

 A complete miscarriage is when all products of conception have been expelled; these may include the trophoblast, chorionic villi, gestational sac, yolk sac, and fetal pole (embryo); or later in pregnancy the foetus, umbilical cord, placenta, amniotic fluid, and amniotic membrane. The presence of a pregnancy test that is still positive, as well as an empty uterus upon transvaginal ultrasonography, does, however, fulfil the definition of pregnancy of unknown location. Therefore, there may be a need for follow-up pregnancy tests to ensure that there is no remaining pregnancy, including ectopic pregnancy.
An incomplete miscarriage occurs when some products of conception have been passed, but some remain inside the uterus. However, an increased distance between the uterine walls on transvaginal ultrasonography may also simply be an increased endometrial thickness and/or a polyp. The use of a Doppler ultrasound may be better in confirming the presence of significant retained products of conception in the uterine cavity. In cases of uncertainty, ectopic pregnancy must be excluded using techniques like serial beta-hCG measurements.A missed miscarriage is when the embryo or fetus has died, but a miscarriage has not yet occurred. It is also referred to as delayed miscarriage, silent miscarriage, or missed abortion.

A septic miscarriage occurs when the tissue from a missed or incomplete miscarriage becomes infected, which carries the risk of spreading infection (septicaemia) and can be fatal.

Recurrent miscarriage (&quot;recurrent pregnancy loss&quot; (RPL), &quot;recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA), or &quot;habitual abortion&quot;) is the occurrence of multiple consecutive miscarriages; the exact number used to diagnose recurrent miscarriage varies; however, two is the minimum threshold to meet the criteria. If the proportion of pregnancies ending in miscarriage is 15% and assuming that miscarriages are independent events, then the probability of two consecutive miscarriages is 2.25% and the probability of three consecutive miscarriages is 0.34%. The occurrence of recurrent pregnancy loss is 1%. A large majority (85%) of those who have had two miscarriages will conceive and carry normally afterwards.

The physical symptoms of a miscarriage vary according to the length of pregnancy, though most miscarriages cause pain or cramping. The size of blood clots and pregnancy tissue that are passed become larger with longer gestations. After 13 weeks&#x27; gestation, there is a higher risk of placenta retention.

==Prevention==
Prevention of a miscarriage can sometimes be accomplished by decreasing risk factors. This may include good prenatal care, avoiding drugs and alcohol, preventing infectious diseases, and avoiding X-rays. Identifying the cause of the miscarriage may help prevent future pregnancy loss, especially in cases of recurrent miscarriage. Often there is little a person can do to prevent a miscarriage. Vitamin supplementation before or during pregnancy has not been found to affect the risk of miscarriage. Progesterone has been shown to prevent miscarriage in women with 1) vaginal bleeding early in their current pregnancy and 2) a previous history of miscarriage.

===Non-modifiable risk factors===
Preventing a miscarriage in subsequent pregnancies may be enhanced with assessments of:

* Immune status
* Chemical and occupational exposures
* Anatomical defects
* Pre-existing or acquired disease in pregnancy
** Polycystic ovary syndrome
* Previous exposure to chemotherapy and radiation
* Medications
* Surgical history
* Endocrine disorders
* Genetic abnormalities
===Modifiable risk factors===
Maintaining a healthy weight and good prenatal care can reduce the risk of miscarriage. Some risk factors can be minimized by avoiding the following:
* Smoking
* Cocaine use
* Alcohol
* Poor nutrition
* Occupational exposure to agents that can cause miscarriage
* Medications associated with miscarriage
* Drug abuse

==Management==
Women who miscarry early in their pregnancy usually do not require any subsequent medical treatment but they can benefit from support and counseling. Most early miscarriages will be completed on their own; in other cases, medication treatment or aspiration of the products of conception can be used to remove the remaining tissue. While bed rest has been advocated to prevent miscarriage, this is not of benefit. Those who are experiencing or who have experienced a miscarriage benefit from the use of careful medical language. Significant distress can often be managed by the ability of the clinician to clearly explain terms without suggesting that the woman or couple are somehow to blame.

Evidence to support Rho(D) immune globulin after a spontaneous miscarriage is unclear. In the UK, Rho(D) immune globulin is recommended in Rh-negative women after 12 weeks gestational age and before 12 weeks gestational age in those who need surgery or medication to complete the miscarriage.

=== Methods ===
No treatment is necessary for a diagnosis of complete miscarriage (so long as ectopic pregnancy is ruled out). In cases of an incomplete miscarriage, empty sac, or missed abortion there are three treatment options: watchful waiting, medical management, and surgical treatment. With no treatment (watchful waiting), most miscarriages (65–80%) will pass naturally within two to six weeks. This treatment avoids the possible side effects and complications of medications and surgery, but increases the risk of mild bleeding, the need for unplanned surgical treatment, and incomplete miscarriage. Medical treatment usually consists of using misoprostol (a prostaglandin) alone or in combination with mifepristone pre-treatment. These medications help the uterus to contract and expel the remaining tissue out of the body. This works within a few days in 95% of cases. Vacuum aspiration or sharp curettage can be used, with vacuum aspiration being lower-risk and more common.

===Delayed and incomplete miscarriage===
In delayed or incomplete miscarriage, treatment depends on the amount of tissue remaining in the uterus. Treatment can include surgical removal of the tissue with vacuum aspiration or misoprostol. Studies looking at the methods of anaesthesia for surgical management of incomplete miscarriage have not shown that any adaptation from normal practice is beneficial.

===Induced miscarriage===

An induced abortion may be performed by a qualified healthcare provider for women who cannot continue the pregnancy. Self-induced abortion performed by a woman or non-medical personnel can be dangerous and is still a cause of maternal mortality in some countries. In some locales, it is illegal or a carries heavy social stigma.

===Sex===
Some organisations recommend delaying sex after a miscarriage until the bleeding has stopped to decrease the risk of infection. However, there is not sufficient evidence for the routine use of antibiotics to try to avoid infection in incomplete abortion. Others recommend delaying attempts at pregnancy until one period has occurred to make it easier to determine the dates of a subsequent pregnancy. No evidence getting pregnant in that first cycle affects outcomes and an early subsequent pregnancy may improve outcomes.

===Support===
Organisations exist that provide information and counselling to help those who have had a miscarriage. Family and friends often conduct a memorial or burial service. Hospitals also can provide support and help memorialise the event. Depending on the locale others desire to have a private ceremony. Providing appropriate support with frequent discussions and sympathetic counselling is part of evaluation and treatment. Those who experience unexplained miscarriages can be treated with emotional support.

===Miscarriage leave===
Miscarriage leave is a leave of absence concerning miscarriage. The following countries offer paid or unpaid leave to women who have had a miscarriage.
* The Philippines – 60 days&#x27; fully paid leave for miscarriages (before 20 weeks of gestation) or emergency termination of the pregnancy (on the 20th week or after) The husband of the mother gets seven days&#x27; fully paid leave up to the 4th pregnancy.
* India – six weeks&#x27; leave
* New Zealand – three days&#x27; bereavement leave for both parents
* Mauritius – two weeks&#x27; leave
* Indonesia – six weeks&#x27; leave
* Taiwan – five days, one week or four weeks, depending on how advanced the pregnancy was

==Outcomes==

===Psychological and emotional effects===
Every woman&#x27;s personal experience of miscarriage is different, and women who have more than one miscarriage may react differently to each event.

In Western cultures since the 1980s, medical providers assume that experiencing a miscarriage &quot;is a major loss for all pregnant women&quot;. A miscarriage can result in anxiety, depression or stress for those involved. It can affect the whole family. Many of those experiencing a miscarriage go through a grieving process. &quot;Prenatal attachment&quot; often exists that can be seen as parental sensitivity, love and preoccupation directed towards the unborn child. Serious emotional impact is usually experienced immediately after the miscarriage. Some may go through the same loss when an ectopic pregnancy is terminated. In some, the realisation of the loss can take weeks. Providing family support to those experiencing the loss can be challenging because some find comfort in talking about the miscarriage while others may find the event painful to discuss. The father can have the same sense of loss. Expressing feelings of grief and loss can sometimes be harder for men. Some women can begin planning their next pregnancy after a few weeks of having the miscarriage. For others, planning another pregnancy can be difficult. Some facilities acknowledge the loss. Parents can name and hold their infant. They may be given mementoes such as photos and footprints. Some conduct a funeral or memorial service. They may express the loss by planting a tree.

Some health organizations recommend that sexual activity be delayed after the miscarriage. The menstrual cycle should resume after about three to four months. Women reported that they were dissatisfied with the care they received from physicians and nurses.

===Subsequent pregnancies===
Some parents want to try to have a baby very soon after the miscarriage. The decision of trying to become pregnant again can be difficult. Reasons exist that may prompt parents to consider another pregnancy. For older mothers, there may be some sense of urgency. Other parents are optimistic that future pregnancies are likely to be successful. Many are hesitant and want to know about the risk of having another or more miscarriages. Some clinicians recommend that the women have one menstrual cycle before attempting another pregnancy. This is because the date of conception may be hard to determine. Also, the first menstrual cycle after a miscarriage can be much longer or shorter than expected. Parents may be advised to wait even longer if they have experienced late miscarriage or molar pregnancy, or are undergoing tests. Some parents wait for six months based on recommendations from their healthcare provider.

Research shows that depression after a miscarriage or stillbirth can continue for years, even after the birth of a subsequent child. Medical professionals are advised to take previous loss of a pregnancy into account when assessing risks for postnatal depression following the birth of a subsequent infant. It is believed that supportive interventions may improve the health outcomes of both the mother and the child.

The risks of having another miscarriage vary according to the cause. The risk of having another miscarriage after a molar pregnancy is very low. The risk of another miscarriage is highest after the third miscarriage. Pre-conception care is available in some locales.

===Later cardiovascular disease===
There is a significant association between miscarriage and later development of coronary artery disease, but not cerebrovascular disease.

==Epidemiology==
Around 15% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage, totaling around 23 million miscarriages per year worldwide. Miscarriage rates among all fertilized zygotes are around 30% to 50%. A 2012 review found the risk of miscarriage between 5 and 20 weeks from 11% to 22%. Up to the 13th week of pregnancy, the risk of miscarriage each week was around 2%, dropping to 1% in week 14 and reducing slowly between 14 and 20 weeks.

The precise rate is not known because a large number of miscarriages occur before pregnancies become established and before the woman is aware she is pregnant. Additionally, those with bleeding in early pregnancy may seek medical care more often than those not experiencing bleeding. Although some studies attempt to account for this by recruiting women who are planning pregnancies and testing for very early pregnancy, they still are not representative of the wider population.

In 2010, 50,000 inpatient admissions for miscarriage occurred in the UK.

==Society and culture==
Society&#x27;s reactions to miscarriage have changed over time. In the early 20th century, the focus was on the mother&#x27;s physical health and the difficulties and disabilities that miscarriage could produce. Other reactions, such as the expense of medical treatments and relief at ending an unwanted pregnancy, were also heard. In the 1940s and 1950s, people were more likely to express relief, not because the miscarriage ended an unwanted or mistimed pregnancy, but because people believed that miscarriages were primarily caused by birth defects, and miscarrying meant that the family would not raise a child with disabilities. The dominant attitude in the mid-century was that a miscarriage, although temporarily distressing, was a blessing in disguise for the family and that another pregnancy and a healthier baby would soon follow, especially if women trusted physicians and reduced their anxieties. Media articles were illustrated with pictures of babies, and magazine articles about miscarriage ended by introducing the healthy baby—usually a boy—that shortly followed it.

Beginning in the 1980s, miscarriage in the US was primarily framed in terms of the individual woman&#x27;s emotional reaction, especially her grief over a tragic outcome. The subject was portrayed in the media with images of an empty crib or an isolated, grieving woman, and stories about miscarriage were published in general-interest media outlets, not just women&#x27;s magazines or health magazines. Family members were encouraged to grieve, to memorialize their losses through funerals and other rituals, and to think of themselves as being parents. This shift to recognizing these emotional responses was partly due to medical and political successes, which created an expectation that pregnancies are typically planned and safe, and to women&#x27;s demands that their emotional reactions no longer be dismissed by the medical establishments. It also reinforces the anti-abortion movement&#x27;s belief that human life begins at conception or early in pregnancy, and that motherhood is a desirable life goal. The modern one-size-fits-all model of grief does not fit every woman&#x27;s experience, and an expectation to perform grief creates unnecessary burdens for some women. The reframing of miscarriage as a private emotional experience brought less awareness of miscarriage and a sense of silence around the subject, especially compared to the public discussion of miscarriage during campaigns for access to birth control during the early 20th century, or the public campaigns to prevent miscarriages, stillbirths, and infant deaths by reducing industrial pollution during the 1970s.

In places where induced abortion is illegal or carries a social stigma, suspicion may surround miscarriage, complicating an already sensitive issue.

Developments in ultrasound technology (in the early 1980s) allowed them to identify earlier miscarriages.

=== Legal registration ===
Miscarriages may be tracked for purposes of health statistics, but they are not usually recorded individually. For example, under UK law, all stillbirths should be registered, although this does not apply to miscarriages. According to French statutes, an infant born before the age of viability, determined to be 28 weeks, is not registered as a &#x27;child&#x27;. If birth occurs after this, the infant is granted a certificate that allows the parents to have a symbolic record of that child. This certificate can include a registered and given name to allow a funeral and acknowledgement of the event.

==Other animals==
Miscarriage occurs in all animals that experience pregnancy, though in such contexts it is more commonly referred to as a &quot;spontaneous abortion&quot; (the two terms are synonymous). There are a variety of known risk factors in non-human animals. For example, in sheep, miscarriage may be caused by crowding through doors or being chased by dogs. In cows, spontaneous abortion may be caused by contagious diseases, such as brucellosis or &quot;Campylobacter&quot;, but often can be controlled by vaccination. In many species of sharks and rays, stress-induced miscarriage occurs frequently on capture.

Other diseases are also known to make animals susceptible to miscarriage. Spontaneous abortion occurs in pregnant prairie voles when their mate is removed and they are exposed to a new male, an example of the Bruce effect, although this effect is seen less in wild populations than in the laboratory. Female mice who had spontaneous abortions showed a sharp rise in the amount of time spent with unfamiliar males preceding the abortion than those who did not.

From 2018 to 2023, he portrayed rancher John Dutton on the Paramount Network drama series &quot;Yellowstone&quot;, for which he received a Golden Globe award.

==Early life and education==
Costner was born on January 18, 1955, in Lynwood, California, and grew up in Compton, California. His parents were William and Sharon Costner. He is the youngest of three boys, the second of whom died at birth. Sharon Rae Costner (née Tedrick) was a welfare worker, and William Costner was an electrician and a utilities executive. Costner&#x27;s father&#x27;s heritage originates with German immigrants to North Carolina in the 1700s, and Costner also has English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh ancestry. Costner was raised Baptist. He was not academically inclined in school, but did play sports (especially football), take piano lessons, write poetry, and sing in the First Baptist Choir. He has said that watching the 1962 film &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; as a child inspired his love for Western films.

Costner has stated that he spent his teenage years in different parts of California as his father&#x27;s career progressed. He has described this time as a period when he &quot;lost a lot of confidence&quot;, having to make new friends often. Costner lived in Ventura, then in Visalia. Costner attended Mt. Whitney High School where he was in the marching band. Costner graduated from Villa Park High School in 1973. He played baseball at Villa Park and was teammates with Dennis Burtt. He earned a BA from California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) in 1978. While at CSUF, he became a brother in the Delta Chi fraternity.

Costner became interested in acting and dancing while in his last year of college. In 1978, while on an airplane returning from his honeymoon in Puerto Vallarta, Costner had a chance encounter with actor Richard Burton. At that time, Costner was uncertain about whether he should become an actor, and he approached Burton to ask his advice. Costner has said that Burton encouraged him to pursue acting. Costner has also stated that he asked Burton whether it was possible to be an actor without experiencing turmoil in one&#x27;s private life; according to Costner, Burton replied that he thought it was possible. Costner credits Burton with inspiring him to become an actor.

Having agreed to undertake a job as a marketing executive, Costner began taking acting lessons five nights a week, with the support of his wife. His marketing job lasted 30 days. He took jobs that allowed him to develop his acting skills, by paying his tuition, including working on fishing boats, as a truck driver, and giving tours of movie stars&#x27; Hollywood homes. This work supported the couple while Costner attended auditions.

==Career==
=== 1981–1986: Rise to prominence ===
Costner made his film debut in &quot;Sizzle Beach, U.S.A.&quot; (1981). Costner played a minor role as &quot;Frat Boy #1&quot; in the Ron Howard film &quot;Night Shift&quot; (1982). In 1983, Costner&#x27;s starred in &quot;Stacy&#x27;s Knights&quot;.

Costner appeared in a commercial for the Apple Lisa and &quot;Table for Five&quot; in 1983, and, the same year, had a small role in the nuclear holocaust film &quot;Testament&quot;. Later, he was cast in &quot;The Big Chill&quot; and filmed several scenes that were planned as flashbacks, but they were removed from the final cut. His role was that of Alex, the friend who committed suicide, the event that brings the rest of the cast together. Costner was a friend of director Lawrence Kasdan, who promised the actor a role in a future project. That became &quot;Silverado&quot; (1985) and a breakout role for Costner. He also starred that year in the smaller films &quot;Fandango&quot; and &quot;American Flyers&quot; and appeared alongside Kiefer Sutherland in an hour-long special episode of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;.

=== 1987–1994: Stardom and acclaim ===

Costner achieved movie star status in 1987, when he starred as federal agent Eliot Ness in &quot;The Untouchables&quot; and in the leading role of the thriller &quot;No Way Out&quot;. He solidified his A-list status in the baseball-themed films &quot;Bull Durham&quot; (1988) and &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; (1989). In 1990, he partnered with producer Jim Wilson to form the production company Tig Productions. Tig&#x27;s first film was the epic &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; which Costner directed and starred in. This film was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven, including two for him personally (Best Picture and Best Director). The same year saw the release of &quot;Revenge&quot;, in which he starred along with Anthony Quinn and Madeleine Stowe, directed by Tony Scott; Costner had wanted to direct it himself.

Costner portrayed Robin Hood in the action-adventure film &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; (1991) where he also served as a producer. Costner starred alongside Alan Rickman, Morgan Freeman, and Christian Slater. The film received mixed reviews but was an immense box-office success. He then starred as District Attorney Jim Garrison in the Oliver Stone-directed political epic thriller &quot;JFK&quot; (1991). The film gained significant controversy for its historical inaccuracies but was also praised for its style, direction, and performances. Costner received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama nomination for his role. Critic Roger Ebert praised his performance writing, &quot;As Garrison, Costner gives a measured yet passionate performance. Like a man who has hold of an idea he cannot let go, he forges ahead, insisting that there is more to the assassination than meets the eye.&quot;

He then starred opposite Whitney Houston in the romantic drama &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; (1992) where he also served as a producer. The film was a pop-culture sensation and financial success. The next year he starred as a criminal on the run in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s drama &quot;A Perfect World&quot; (1993). Film critic Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;Costner seems about as pathological as a koala bear, and his gentle charisma reinforces the film&#x27;s touchy-feely theme&quot;. He took the title role in the western biopic &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; (1994), directed by Lawrence Kasdan, where he also served as a producer. That same year he starred in the drama film &quot;The War&quot;. The film also co-starred Elijah Wood. The film seemed to gain little attention.

=== 1995–2011: Career fluctuations === 

The science fiction-post-apocalyptic epics &quot;Waterworld&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Postman&quot; (1997), the latter of which Costner also directed, were both commercial disappointments and both largely regarded by critics as artistic failures. However, while &quot;Waterworld&quot; achieved respectable box office and some positive reviews, results for &quot;The Postman&quot; were far worse and it ended up winning five Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture, Worst Actor and Worst Director for Costner. Costner starred in the golf comedy &quot;Tin Cup&quot; (1996) for Ron Shelton, who had previously directed him in &quot;Bull Durham&quot;. He developed the film &quot;Air Force One&quot; and was set to play the lead role of the President, but ultimately decided to concentrate on finishing &quot;The Postman&quot; instead. He personally offered the project to Harrison Ford. In 1999, he starred in &quot;Message in a Bottle &quot; with Robin Wright, based on the novel of the same name by Nicholas Sparks. The film drew mixed reviews and just about broke even at the box office.

His career revived somewhat in 2000 with &quot;Thirteen Days&quot;, in which he portrayed Kenneth O&#x27;Donnell, a top adviser to John F. Kennedy. The western &quot;Open Range&quot;, which he directed and starred in, received critical acclaim in 2003, and was a surprise success commercially. He received some of his best reviews for his supporting role as retired professional baseball player Denny Davies in &quot;The Upside of Anger&quot;, for which he received a nomination from the Broadcast Film Critics Association and won the San Francisco Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor. After that, Costner starred in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and in &quot;Mr. Brooks&quot;, in which he portrayed a serial killer. In 2008, his Tig Productions company closed and was changed to Tree House Films.

Costner portrayed Devil Anse Hatfield in the three-part miniseries &quot;Hatfields &amp; McCoys&quot;, which premiered on May 28, 2012, on the History Channel. It broke a record by pulling 13.9 million viewers. The miniseries tells the true American story of a legendary family feud – one that spanned decades and nearly launched a war between Kentucky and West Virginia. The role earned Costner the 2012 Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie, the 2013 Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie, and the 2013 Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Limited Series or a Motion Picture Made for Television.

In 2014, Costner appeared in the spy movie &quot;Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit&quot;, as Thomas Harper, a mentor for the series&#x27; title character. The same year, he starred in the thriller &quot;3 Days to Kill&quot; and the drama &quot;Draft Day&quot; and produced and starred in &quot;Black or White&quot;. &quot;Black or White&quot; premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival and opened in the United States in 2015.

==Other ventures==
===Country music===
Costner is the singer in Kevin Costner &amp; Modern West, a country rock band which he founded with the encouragement of his wife Christine. In October 2007, they began a worldwide tour which included shows in Istanbul and Rome. The group also performed at NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races at Daytona International Speedway and Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina.

The band released a country album, &quot;Untold Truths&quot;, on November 11, 2008, on Universal South Records. The album peaked at No. 61 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums and No. 35 on the Top Heatseekers chart. Three singles (&quot;Superman 14&quot;, &quot;Long Hot Night&quot; and &quot;Backyard&quot;) have been released to radio, although none have charted. For the single &quot;Superman 14&quot; a live music video was made.

In 2009, they went on tour with opening act The Alternate Routes. In August, at the Big Valley Jamboree in Camrose, Alberta, Costner and the band were scheduled next on stage when a severe thunderstorm struck, causing the stage and stands on the main stage to collapse. One person was reported dead and forty injured. Later, an auction was held to raise money for the two young sons of the woman killed. A dinner with Costner was auctioned off for $41,000. Two guitars, one autographed by Costner, helped raise another $10,000 each.

A second Kevin Costner and Modern West album, &quot;Turn It On&quot;, was released in February 2010 in Europe and was supported by a European tour. In July 2012, the band performed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, at the 20th annual Telus World Skins Game in support of the IWK Health Centre Foundation, donating a guitar autographed by Costner.

Kevin Costner has also appeared in the documentary film &quot;Country Roads&quot; by Marieke Schröder.

The most recent album released by Kevin Costner and Modern West, &quot;Tales from Yellowstone&quot;, was written by Costner and his co-writers from the perspective of John Dutton, Costner&#x27;s character on the hit TV series &quot;Yellowstone&quot;. Songs from the album were featured on Season 3 of the show.

===Baseball===
Several of Costner&#x27;s films have included a baseball theme: &quot;Chasing Dreams&quot;, &quot;Bull Durham&quot;, &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;, &quot;For Love of the Game&quot;, and &quot;The Upside of Anger&quot;, in three of which his character is a pro baseball player and one a former pro baseball player.

Costner has a home in Austin, Texas, and sometimes appears at Texas Longhorns baseball practices and games. He was a close friend of former Longhorns baseball coach Augie Garrido from Garrido&#x27;s days coaching at Cal State Fullerton, Costner&#x27;s alma mater. He cast Garrido to play the role of the Yankee manager in &quot;For Love of the Game&quot;. He tries to attend every College World Series game that the CSUF Titans team plays in Omaha, Nebraska. Costner walked on for a tryout, but did not make the team early in his time at the university.

Costner was a partial owner of the Zion, Illinois-based Lake County Fielders independent baseball team in the North American League. The Fielders name was an homage to &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;, with the logo showing a ballplayer standing amid a field of corn. On August 12, 2021, he led the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox onto the field prior to the MLB at Field of Dreams game held in Dyersville, Iowa and gave a short speech.

===Business interests===

In 1995, Costner bought a company that was developing oil separation machines based on a patent he purchased from the US government. The machines developed by the company were of little commercial interest until the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, when BP took six of the machines from a company in which Costner owned an interest, Ocean Therapy Solutions, for testing in late May 2010. On June 16, 2010, BP entered into a lease with Ocean Therapy Solutions for 32 of the oil-water separation devices. Although Spyron Contoguris and Stephen Baldwin had previously sold their interests in Ocean Therapy Solutions in mid-June to another investor in the company, they filed a lawsuit in Louisiana District Court claiming $10.64 million for securities fraud and misrepresentation. The suit claimed that Costner kept a meeting with BP secret from them, and the secret meeting resulted in an $18-million down payment on a $52 million purchase, and that after the down payment, but before any announcement, another investor used part of the down payment to buy out their shares, thus excluding them from their share of the profits from the total sale. The suit claimed that, despite public statements by Costner, Ocean Therapy Solutions, BP and others to the contrary, Baldwin and Contogouris were told that BP was still testing the machines and had not yet committed to lease the machines from Ocean Therapy Solutions and that the other investor in Ocean Therapy Solutions purchased their shares for $1.4 million to Baldwin and $500,000, to Contogouris. In June 2012, a federal jury in Louisiana deliberated for less than two hours before rejecting Baldwin&#x27;s and Contogouris&#x27; claims in the multimillion-dollar oil-clean-up case, and the court ordered Baldwin and Contogouris to reimburse Costner and the other defendants in the case for their costs.

On June 6, 2004, Costner opened &quot;Tatanka: The Story of the Bison&quot; one mile south of Deadwood, South Dakota, on U.S. Route 85, saying he hoped it would be an educational and emotional place for people to learn about America&#x27;s westward expansion. Promoters stated in a news release that the $5-million attraction had a new, 3,800-square-foot interactive center featuring exhibits, retail, and food and beverage areas, as well as offices and a small theater. The visitor center features graphics and text about the bison and the relationship of the Plains Indians to the animals - historically hunting and now raising them for food and clothing, among other things. The centerpiece is a bronze sculpture depicting a buffalo jump by Hill City artist Peggy Detmers, depicting 14 bronze bison in the act of running from their pursuers and three bronze Lakota riders on horseback. Three of the massive bison are posed in midair, cascading over the face of a cliff. Costner commissioned the work in 1994 from Detmers. The five-fourths-scale bronzes, each weighing between 2,500 and 8,000 pounds, were cast at Eagle Bronze Foundry in Lander, Wyoming.

Costner opened the Midnight Star Casino and Restaurant in Deadwood, S.D., in 1991. He hired Francis and Carla Caneva to manage the establishment and gave each of them a 3.25 percent ownership and paid them salaries and bonuses. He terminated their employment in July 2004 and asked to agree to an amicable disassociation. When they declined, Costner dissolved the partnership and hired an accountant who determined its fair market value to be $3.1 million. The Canevas sued Costner to buy their shares based on twice that amount or sell the company on the open market. They won in the lower court but, on Costner&#x27;s appeal, lost in the South Dakota Supreme Court. Costner closed the establishment in 2017 and sold it in 2020.

In 2020, Costner joined Woody Sears&#x27;s new audio entertainment travel app, HearHere, as a co-founder, podcast narrator, and investor. Costner narrates some of the audio stories provided by the iPhone subscription app for travelers on road trips across the United States who want to hear about the people, places, and histories they are encountering on their travels.

===Philanthropy===
Costner serves on an honorary board for the National World War I Museum in Kansas City, Missouri. In spring 2011, he recorded two radio spots for the museum that were aired on Kansas City Royals Radio Network.

===NASCAR===
Costner was named ceremonial Grand Marshal of the NASCAR Cup Series&#x27; Auto Club 500 which took place on February 25, 2007, at the California Speedway. In 2008, he worked with the NASCAR Media Group and CMT Films to help produce the NASCAR Documentary &quot;The Ride of Their Lives&quot; which was released in December of that year. Costner would be the narrator for that documentary. Also in 2009, he was named the spokesman for NASCAR Day which took place on May 15. The next day, May 16, he and his country music band would perform in the infield of Charlotte Motor Speedway as well as participate as a judge in the 2nd annual Victory Challenge before the 25th Running of the NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race.

===Writing===
In 2015, Costner co-authored &quot;The Explorer&#x27;s Guild: A Passage to Shambhala&quot;, a hybrid adventure novel and graphic novel, with John Baird, researcher Stephen C. Meyer, and illustrator Rick Ross.

Costner has a chapter giving advice in Tim Ferriss&#x27; book &quot;Tools of Titans&quot;.

In 1975, while in college, Costner started dating fellow student Cindy Silva, and they married three years later. During their marriage, they had two daughters born in 1984 and 1986, and a son born in 1988. The couple divorced in 1994 after 16 years of marriage, due to Costner allegedly having an affair while on the set of &quot;Waterworld&quot;. Cindy Silva received a settlement of 80 million (equivalent to $ million in ).

They have two sons, born in 2007 and 2009, and a daughter born in 2010. In May 2023, Baumgartner filed for divorce. They finalized their divorce on February 20, 2024.

===Political activism===
Early in his life, Costner was a Republican. He was both a supporter and friend of Ronald Reagan, frequently playing golf with the former president. He eventually switched his affiliation in the early 1990s. Since 1992, Costner has financially supported a variety of Democratic politicians, including Al Gore and Tom Daschle, but also made contributions to Republican Phil Gramm as late as 1995.

In 2008, he said publicly that he had no ambition to run for political office, adding &quot;I&#x27;ve lived quite a colorful life&quot;. In the final days before that year&#x27;s United States presidential election, Costner campaigned for Barack Obama, visiting various places in Colorado, where he has a home. In his speech, Costner stated the need for young voters to get to the polls, early and with enthusiasm. &quot;We were going to change the world and we haven&#x27;t&quot;, Costner said at a Colorado State University rally. &quot;My generation didn&#x27;t get it done, and we need you to help us&quot;.

In October 2014, Costner sent a tribute to British troops serving around the world, thanking them for their work.

On December 22, 2019, Costner endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg at a rally in Indianola, Iowa. Later, Costner supported Democratic candidate Joe Biden.

<text>The Battle of Shiloh, also known as the Battle of Pittsburg Landing, was a major battle in the American Civil War fought on April 6–7, 1862. The fighting took place in southwestern Tennessee, which was part of the war&#x27;s Western Theater. The battlefield is located between a small, undistinguished church named Shiloh and Pittsburg Landing on the Tennessee River. Two Union armies combined to defeat the Confederate Army of Mississippi. Major General Ulysses S. Grant was the Union commander, while General Albert Sidney Johnston was the Confederate commander until his battlefield death, when he was replaced by his second-in-command, General P. G. T. Beauregard.

The Confederate army hoped to defeat Grant&#x27;s Army of the Tennessee before it could be reinforced and resupplied. Although it made considerable gains with a surprise attack on the first day of the battle, Johnston was mortally wounded and Grant&#x27;s army was not eliminated. Overnight, Grant&#x27;s Army of the Tennessee was reinforced by one of its divisions stationed farther north, and was also joined by portions of the Army of the Ohio, under the command of Major General Don Carlos Buell. The Union forces conducted an unexpected counterattack in the morning, which reversed the Confederate gains of the previous day. The exhausted Confederate army withdrew further south, and a modest Union pursuit started and ended on the next day.

Though victorious, the Union army had more casualties than the Confederates. After the surprise and lengthy Union casualty list became known, Grant was heavily criticized; in fact, decisions made by both the Federal and Confederate high command were afterward questioned by individuals on and off the battlefield. The battle was the costliest engagement of the Civil War up to that point, and its nearly 24,000 casualties made it one of the bloodiest battles of the entire war.

==Background and plans==


During February 1862, a Union army led by Ulysses S. Grant won two battles that were the most significant Union victories, at that time, of the American Civil War. The battles were the Battle of Fort Henry and the Battle of Fort Donelson, and they occurred in Tennessee on the Tennessee River and the Cumberland River, respectively. Those rivers were vital to the Confederacy as transportation routes, and also connected the city of Nashville, an ironworks, and major agricultural areas. Nashville was a converging point for railroads, a major producer of gunpowder, and a major supply depot. The Union army increased its firepower in those battles by receiving assistance from U.S. Navy gunboats. The steam-powered gunboats were flat-bottomed, armored, and carried up to 13 artillery pieces. Grant was rewarded for his success by a promotion to major general, making him senior to all generals in the Western Theater (between the Appalachian Mountains and Mississippi River) with the exception of Major General Henry Halleck.

Continuing their push into Confederate territory, Union troops arrived at the Tennessee River town of Savannah, Tennessee, on March 11. By mid-March, a large number of Union troops were camped there and at landings further south, and additional Union troops under the command of Don Carlos Buell were moving from Nashville to join the force on the river. Union leadership realized that its troops were too spread out, so it was decided to concentrate troops at Pittsburg Landing. Pittsburg Landing is upriver (south) of Savannah, and it had a road that led to Corinth, Mississippi. About inland from the landing was a log church named Shiloh (a Hebrew word meaning &quot;place of peace&quot;), and it is from this church that the battle gets its name. The battle has also been called the &quot;Battle of Pittsburg Landing&quot;. The area that would become the Shiloh battlefield was somewhat shaped like a triangle, with the sides formed by various creeks and the Tennessee River. The land was mostly wooded, with scattered cotton fields, peach orchards, and a few small structures.

The Confederate Army&#x27;s February 6 loss at Fort Henry caused it to abandon Kentucky and parts of Tennessee. The last Confederate troops in Nashville moved south on February 23. General Albert Sidney Johnston, Confederate commander of the Western Theater, made the controversial decision to abandon the region. Although Confederate politicians were unhappy with Johnston&#x27;s performance and the abandonment, the consolidation of troops further south was a wise choice, because the Union forces on the Tennessee River could cut off Confederate retreats from posts in Kentucky and major portions of Tennessee. Confederate leadership decided to consolidate forces in Corinth, Mississippi, which is just south of the Tennessee–Mississippi border. The town of Corinth had strategic value because it was at the intersection of two railroads, including one that was part of the rail network used to move Confederate supplies and troops between Tennessee and Virginia. By the end of March, over 40,000 Confederate troops were concentrated at Corinth.

===Union and Confederate plans===

The Union plan was to combine Grant&#x27;s and Buell&#x27;s armies and continue its southward offensive. If the combined armies could move south and capture Corinth, they would have a good starting point for the capture of Memphis, Vicksburg, and large portions of Confederate territory. While most of Grant&#x27;s army camped near the river at Pittsburg Landing in early April, one division was downstream (north) at Crump&#x27;s Landing, and army headquarters remained further north in Savannah. Buell&#x27;s army was moving south from Nashville to Savannah, and no advancement beyond the Pittsburg Landing-Shiloh area was allowed until the two armies combined. On April 4, Confederate cavalry was seen by a Union patrol near Shiloh, but Union leadership was not concerned.

Confederate leaders realized they could soon be outnumbered. They had 42,000 men at Corinth, and 15,000 more on the way, while the not–yet–combined Union force could be as large as 75,000 men. Instead of waiting to be attacked by a larger force, they decided to surprise the Union Army on April 4 before the second Union Army arrived from Nashville. Inexperience and bad weather caused their 20-mile (32km) march north to be &quot;a nightmare of confusion and delays&quot;, and the Confederate Army was not deployed into position until the afternoon of April 5. The army spent the night of April 5 on the south side of the Union campsites. The plan was to attack the Union left, pushing it northwest against the swampy land adjacent to Snake and Owl creeks. Confederate troops along the Tennessee River would prevent Union reinforcements and resupply.

==Opposing forces==
===Union===

The two Union armies in the Battle of Shiloh were part of the Department of the Mississippi, which was commanded by Major General Henry Halleck. Although Halleck hoped to lead the two armies in an eventual attack on Corinth, he was not present at Shiloh. The combined armies present for the battle totaled to 66,812 men. They had 119 artillery pieces available for the battle. The majority of the Union soldiers were armed with either a .69 caliber model 1841 rifled musket or a .69 caliber model 1842 smoothbore musket, although a few regiments had more modern weapons such as the .58 caliber Springfield Model 1855. A few regiments, or sometimes a few companies within a regiment, had British Enfield or Austrian Lorenz rifles. The armies and their divisions were organized as follows:

====Army of the Tennessee====

The Army of the Tennessee had the most Union men present at the battle, and it was commanded by Major General Ulysses S. Grant. In February 1862, a smaller version of Grant&#x27;s army, with the assistance of gunboats under the command of Flag-Officer Andrew H. Foote, had been the victor in the Battle of Fort Henry and the Battle of Fort Donelson. For the Battle of Shiloh, Grant&#x27;s army had 48,894 men in six divisions. Two new divisions (4th and 5th) were added to Grant&#x27;s three in early March. A 6th Division was created from reinforcement units at the beginning of April. The divisions (and gunboats) were as follows:
* 1st Division was commanded by Major General John Alexander McClernand. This division consisted of veteran fighters.
* 2nd Division was commanded by Brigadier General William H. L. Wallace. His men were veterans, but Wallace had been newly appointed commander after an injury to Major General Charles F. Smith. Colonel James M. Tuttle, one of the brigade commanders, would eventually lead this division.
* 3rd Division was commanded by Major General Lew Wallace. Many of the men in this division were veteran fighters.
* 4th Division was commanded by Brigadier General Stephen A. Hurlbut. This division contained a mixture of veterans and new soldiers.
* 5th Division was commanded by Brigadier General William Tecumseh Sherman. This division had little combat experience. However, when the attack at Shiloh began, Sherman was the only Union division commander on the battlefield who had been trained at the United States Military Academy (a.k.a. West Point).
* 6th Division was commanded by Brigadier General Benjamin M. Prentiss. This division did not have much combat experience.
* Two U.S. Navy gunboats were used by Grant in the battle. These boats were timberclads—their armor was thick oak wood. The USS &quot;Tyler&quot; was commanded by Lieutenant William Gwin. The USS &quot;Lexington&quot; was commanded by Lieutenant James W. Shirk. Both boats and their commanders had participated in the Battle of Fort Henry and the Battle of Fort Donelson.

====Army of the Ohio====

The other Union army at the Battle of Shiloh was the Army of the Ohio, which was commanded by Major General Don Carlos Buell. Portions of this army did not participate in the battle. One portion remained in Nashville, and another portion moved toward Murfreesboro and northern Alabama. Another division, plus part of a second one, did not arrive in time to participate in the battle. The number of men present at the battle totaled to 17,918. Although none of the regiments in Buell&#x27;s army had participated in a major battle, all were well-trained and well-equipped. The divisions in the battle were:
* 2nd Division was commanded by Brigadier General Alexander McDowell McCook.
* 4th Division was commanded by Brigadier General William &quot;Bull&quot; Nelson.
* 5th Division was commanded by Brigadier General Thomas L. Crittenden.
* 6th Division was commanded by Brigadier General Thomas J. Wood. Only his brigades commanded by Brigadier General James A. Garfield and Colonel George D. Wagner arrived in time for the battle, and they were in place around 2:00pm on the second day. The 57th Indiana Infantry Regiment was detached from Wagner&#x27;s brigade to Hurlbut&#x27;s division (Grant), and it was the only regiment to engage with the enemy and receive casualties.

===Confederate===

The Confederate army at the Battle of Shiloh was the Army of Mississippi, commanded by General Albert Sidney Johnston, with General Pierre G. T. Beauregard as Johnston&#x27;s second in command. Created by combining the scattered divisions of Johnston&#x27;s army with troops from Mobile and New Orleans, and later including one regiment that arrived on April 7, Johnston&#x27;s army had 44,699 men present for duty. The army also had 117 artillery pieces for the battle. The forces at the battle were:
* First Corps was commanded by Major General Leonidas Polk, and consisted of two divisions.
* Second Corps was commanded by Major General Braxton Bragg, and consisted of two divisions. Although lacking experience in combat, Bragg&#x27;s troops were the best drilled and disciplined Confederate troops at the battle.
* Third Corps was commanded by Major General William J. Hardee, and consisted of three brigades.
* Reserve Corps was commanded by Brigadier General John C. Breckinridge, and consisted of three brigades. In addition to the three brigades, this corps included some cavalry regiments and batteries that were not assigned to a brigade.
* An unassigned infantry force was the 47th Tennessee Infantry Regiment, which arrived at the battle on April 7.

Most of the Confederate troops did not have combat experience, and regiments were smaller than normal. Bragg&#x27;s Second Corps was the largest of four corps, although it was smaller than the normal size. One of the reasons for the four small corps (instead of fewer corps that were larger) was size deception, as a typical corps had about 20,000 men. Small arms included flintlocks, shotguns, squirrel rifles, and percussion muskets. A few thousand of the highly accurate Enfield rifles had been distributed to Johnston&#x27;s men before the battle; the supply of these increased as they were seized from Union troops in combat. Only one-third of the cavalry possessed any weapons at the start of the battle. Confederate cavalry was much more effective than their Union counterpart, and enabled Johnston to know the positions of both Union armies.

==Battle, morning of April 6==
===Early morning===

Early Sunday morning on April 6, five of Grant&#x27;s six divisions were camped between the Shiloh Church area and the Tennessee River. Sherman&#x27;s division was the first to occupy the Shiloh area, so his four brigades were camped near the main approaches to Pittsburg Landing. Colonel David Stuart&#x27;s brigade was on the Union left (east side of battlefield) near the Hamburg-Savannah Road and a ford. To the west in the Shiloh Church area, Sherman&#x27;s other three brigades formed the Union right. They covered the Pittsburg–Corinth Road and the Owl Creek Bridge over the Hamburg–Purdy Road. In between Sherman and Stuart was Prentiss&#x27;s division, and between the Shiloh Church area and the Tennessee River were the divisions of McClernand and Hurlbut. To the north and closest to Pittsburg Landing was W.H.L. Wallace&#x27;s division. Lew Wallace&#x27;s division was at Crump&#x27;s Landing, downstream (north) of the Union campsites. His mid-March mission had been to damage a railroad. While on this railroad raid, his men learned that a large Confederate force was nearby. Because of this Confederate force, Wallace&#x27;s division remained near Crump&#x27;s Landing. Grant was further north at his headquarters in Savannah. Nelson&#x27;s division from Buell&#x27;s army had reached Savannah, but Buell&#x27;s other divisions were still marching.

The Shiloh camps did not form a defensive line, and no entrenchments were made because nobody expected a fight at that location. The inexperienced divisions of Sherman and Prentiss were the most forward (closest to Corinth) of the group. Only a few pickets were in place—despite a small skirmish taking place on April 4. After hearing reports concerning sightings of Confederate soldiers in the Shiloh area, Colonel Everett Peabody, commander of the First Brigade from Prentiss&#x27;s division, became concerned. Around midnight on April 5, Peabody ordered Major James E. Powell to take three companies of the 25th Missouri Infantry Regiment, and two companies of the 12th Michigan Infantry Regiment, on a reconnaissance (a.k.a. scout) to Seay Field where the sighting had been made. Prentiss was not informed, and Powell&#x27;s men advanced from their camp southwest down a farm road that led to the Pittsburg-Corinth Road.

===Fighting starts at Fraley Field===

The Confederate Third Brigade of Hardee&#x27;s Third Corps was southwest of Powell&#x27;s patrol. The brigade was commanded by Brigadier General S. A. M. Wood, and he had sent forward 280 skirmishers from Major Aaron B. Hardcastle&#x27;s Third Mississippi Battalion. Hardcastle kept most of his men in the southeast corner of James J. Fraley&#x27;s 40-acre (16 ha) cotton field, while two sets of pickets were positioned closer to the Union camps. Around 5:00am (April 6), Confederate pickets fired at Powell&#x27;s men before returning to the battalion. When Powell advanced within of Hardcastle&#x27;s main force, the Confederates opened fire. The battle began with these two small forces fighting for over an hour.

Around 5:30am, Confederate leaders heard the commotion at Fraley Field, and Johnston ordered a general attack. Johnston instructed Beauregard to stay in the rear and direct men and supplies as needed. Johnston rode to the front to lead the men on the battle line, and this arrangement effectively ceded control of the battle to Beauregard. On the Union side, Powell sent a message to Colonel Peabody that he was being driven back by an enemy force of several thousand. Hearing the fighting, Prentiss soon learned that Peabody had sent out a patrol without authorization. Prentiss was outraged and accused Peabody of provoking a major engagement in violation of Grant&#x27;s orders. However, he soon understood that he was facing a large Confederate force and sent reinforcements. Peabody&#x27;s patrol, with Powell leading, partially ruined the planned Confederate surprise and gave thousands of Union soldiers time (although brief) to prepare for battle. Although Peabody&#x27;s patrol had alerted the Union army, some Union leaders were not convinced that they were under attack. Sherman was not convinced until he was slightly wounded, and one of his orderlies shot dead, after a 7:00am ride to investigate the commotion near Rea Field.

After Johnston&#x27;s 5:30 order for a general attack, it took an hour before all Confederate troops were ready. Another hour was lost skirmishing at Seay Field (close to Fraley Field). This reduced the Confederate advantage from the unexpected attack. The Confederate army alignment was another issue that helped reduce the attack&#x27;s effectiveness. The corps of Hardee and Bragg began the assault with their divisions in one line that was nearly wide. At about 7:30am Beauregard ordered the corps of Polk and Breckinridge forward on the left and right of the line, which only extended the line and diluted the effectiveness of the two attacking corps. It became impossible to control the intermingled units, so the corps commanders decided to divide the battlefield, and each commander led their battlefield portion instead of their own corps. The attack went forward as a frontal assault. Johnston and Beauregard did not put more strength on the east side, which meant they did not focus on their objective of turning the Union left.

===Sherman and Prentiss===

Sherman and Prentiss were the commanders of the first two Union divisions attacked, and those happened to be the most inexperienced of Grant&#x27;s six divisions. Sherman, who had been negligent in preparing for an attack, performed with &quot;coolness and courage&quot; while he inspired his raw troops. Facing artillery fire and a frontal attack from the corps of Hardee, Bragg, and Polk, Sherman&#x27;s men performed reasonably well—if they fought. The inexperienced colonel of the 53rd Ohio Infantry Regiment, which had just repelled two Confederate advances, yelled &quot;retreat and save yourselves&quot;, and many from his regiment ran away. Eventually, at least two companies of the calmer men from this regiment attached to another regiment. Sherman slowly moved the division back to a position behind Shiloh Church. He became supported on his left by the Third Brigade from McClernand&#x27;s division.

Prentiss had his camps northeast of Seay Field. On his right, his brigade commanded by Peabody was attacked by two Confederate brigades, and Peabody was wounded four times before being killed. By 8:30am, the remnants of Peabody&#x27;s brigade were pushed north, and the Confederate army occupied his camp. Further east, Prentiss&#x27;s other brigade was attacked by brigades commanded by Brigadier General Adley H. Gladden and Brigadier General James R. Chalmers. Around 8:45am, Gladden was mortally wounded from cannon fire. The Confederate troops suffered considerable casualties, especially from artillery fire. However, the Confederate troops pushed on, and captured the remaining 6th Division camp sometime near 9:00am. The Confederate soldiers had seen many of the Union soldiers running away from the front line, and now possessed the Union camps of Sherman and Prentiss. Looting became a problem, as Confederate soldiers found clothing, rifles, and food. Confederate leaders found it difficult to control their forces. They paused their attack, which enabled Prentiss to move further north.

East of McClernand, Hurlbut had all three brigades ready for action at 8:00am. After being notified that Sherman was facing a strong attack on his left, Hurlbut sent his Second Brigade, commanded by Colonel James C. Veatch, to assist Sherman. Shortly after that first message, Hurlbut was advised that Prentiss was in trouble. Hurlbut brought his remaining two brigades south on the Hamburg-Savannah Road near Wicker Field, and he encountered a large number of panic-stricken men from Prentiss&#x27;s division who were fleeing north. Unable to stop the retreat, he settled his brigades further south near a peach orchard.

===Pittsburg Landing and the Union left===

Grant was in Savannah having breakfast at his Cherry Mansion headquarters when he heard the distant sounds of artillery fire. He was on crutches as he recovered from a fall from his horse, and he was waiting for more of Buell&#x27;s army to arrive in Savannah. Grant ordered Bull Nelson to march his division along the east side of the river to a point opposite Pittsburg Landing, where it could be ferried over to the battlefield. Grant then took his steamboat, &quot;Tigress&quot;, south to Crump&#x27;s Landing, where he told Lew Wallace to get his division ready to move. Grant proceeded to Pittsburg Landing, arriving around 9:00am. The landing was beginning to accumulate men who had fled their posts, and Grant ordered a colonel to halt all stragglers. He then rode inland and confirmed that the Confederates had launched a full-scale attack instead of a probing action. He sent a message to Crump&#x27;s Landing, ordering Lew Wallace to bring his division to the battlefield.

After the beginning of the battle, Brigadier General W.H.L. Wallace sent his Second Brigade, commanded by Brigadier General John McArthur, to fill a gap on the Union left between Hurlbut&#x27;s position at a peach orchard and Stuart&#x27;s brigade at the extreme Union left. McArthur had only two of his regiments, since the others had been sent to assist Sherman and guard the Snake River bridge that led to Crump&#x27;s Landing. His two–regiment force was bolstered by Battery A from the 1st Illinois Light Artillery Regiment. Wallace&#x27;s First and Third brigades, commanded by Colonel James M. Tuttle and Colonel Thomas W. Sweeny, respectively, moved into positions near Duncan Field and what is now called the &quot;Sunken Road&quot;—between the divisions of McClernand and Hurlbut. From 9:30am to 10:30am, most of the fighting at this position was the exchange of artillery fire.

On the extreme Union left, Stuart&#x27;s brigade had heard musket firing early in the morning, but did not believe they were under attack until they heard distant artillery fire. At 9:30am Johnston received reports that Union soldiers were deploying on the Confederate right flank. To remedy this potential problem, he sent two brigades from Bragg&#x27;s Corps, and called up Breckinridge&#x27;s Reserve Corps. What his scouts had actually found was the camp belonging to Stuart&#x27;s Brigade. Stuart was near the Hamburg-Savannah Road close to Lick Creek. Around 9:40am Stuart began receiving artillery fire, and twenty minutes later his men were attacked by Confederate infantry.

===Crossroads===

Shortly after 10:00am, the remnants of Sherman&#x27;s division established a new position further north from Shiloh Church. This position was near a crossroads of the Hamburg–Purdy Road with the Pittsburg–Corinth Road. By this time, Sherman&#x27;s Third Brigade (three Ohio regiments) was eliminated, as its last intact regiment ran away. Colonel Jesse Hildebrand, the brigade commander, remained on the field as a volunteer aide for McClernand&#x27;s headquarters. Sherman&#x27;s First Brigade, commanded by Colonel John A. McDowell was west on the Hamburg–Purdy Road and cut off. Colonel Ralph P. Buckland&#x27;s Fourth Brigade was fragmented and ammunition was low.

Sherman prepared a defense with the men he had left, including Colonel Julius Raith&#x27;s Third Brigade from McClernand&#x27;s division that had reinforced Sherman&#x27;s left earlier. Sherman also had the 6th Indiana Artillery Battery commanded by Captain Frederick Behr, and part of a battery from McClernand. For the first time, the Union army had a continuous front. From west to east were the remnants of Sherman&#x27;s division, McClernand, W.H.L. Wallace, the remnants of Prentiss&#x27;s division, Hurlbut, McArthur&#x27;s brigade from W.H.L. Wallace&#x27;s division, and Stuart&#x27;s brigade from Sherman&#x27;s division. Hurlbut was near a peach orchard, Prentiss was near the Sunken Road, and W.H.L. Wallace was adjacent to Duncan Field at the Sunken Road.

After a failed attack and the addition of more men, the Confederates attacked Sherman and McClernand again at 11:00am. This Confederate attacking force consisted of portions of seven brigades. The Union losses in this attack included Colonel Raith, who was mortally wounded, and Behr&#x27;s battery which fled to the rear after Behr was shot dead. On the Confederate side, Wood&#x27;s brigade took heavy losses, but routed the brigade of Colonel C. Carroll Marsh from McClernand&#x27;s division. Wood&#x27;s men then defeated Veatch&#x27;s brigade, but Wood was thrown from his horse and temporarily out of action. At that time, his brigade became scattered and disorganized. By 11:20am, the Confederate army controlled the Hamburg-Purdy Road. Benefitting from the exhaustion and disorganization of the Confederate force, Sherman and McClernand fell back about north of the crossroads. Sherman&#x27;s separated First Brigade (McDowell) linked with McClernand around 11:30am.

===Sunken Road and Hornet&#x27;s Nest===

The Sunken Road was an old wagon track called &quot;an abandoned road&quot; in the only time it was mentioned in the &quot;Official Records&quot;. From west to east, it ran from Duncan Field to a peach orchard (eventually known as &quot;the Peach Orchard&quot;) at the Hamburg-Savannah Road. The old wagon track was so worn and washed–over that it had an embankment that ranged from a few inches (7.6 cm) to supposedly . This ready-made entrenchment received the name &quot;Sunken Road&quot; in post-war years. Some historians doubt that the road was actually sunken. Nothing in the &quot;Official Records&quot; mentions it as sunken, and the soldier who wrote in his diary that the road was about three feet deep was in a regiment that was not close enough to the road to see it. When the fighting later became heated in this area—Duncan Field, the Sunken Road, and the woods on the north side of the road—the Confederates began calling it the Hornets Nest.

At the beginning of the day, Prentiss had 7,545 men present for duty. By the time he moved back to Barnes Field near the Hamburg-Purdy Road, after casualties and men that ran away, he had only 600 men and portions of two batteries. He deployed his men near the divisions of W.H.L. Wallace and Hurlbut, along the Sunken Road. Grant reinforced Prentiss with 600 men from the 23rd Missouri Infantry Regiment, which had disembarked from Pittsburg Landing a few hours earlier. Grant visited the 1,200-man force, and told Prentiss to &quot;hold at all hazards&quot;.

The Union troops along the Sunken Road were protected by hickory and oak trees. Some Union troops at this location had modern (for 1862) weapons and fences for shelter, while some of the Confederate attacks were across open ground. These factors combined to make frontal assaults difficult for the Confederate attackers. One attack was led by Confederate division commander Benjamin F. Cheatham, and his Second Brigade was thoroughly repelled. Southeast of the Sunken Road, Stuart still held the Union left. The Confederate brigades commanded by brigadier generals James R. Chalmers and John K. Jackson attacked Stuart&#x27;s three regiments. The intensity of the fight increased around 11:15am, causing most of the 71st Ohio Infantry Regiment to flee to the rear. Stuart repositioned his remaining two regiments, but eventually they began panicking. Although Stuart restored order, he was wounded and command temporarily fell to Lieutenant Colonel Oscar Malmborg.

==Battle, afternoon of April 6==

Lew Wallace&#x27;s division had made little progress following Grant&#x27;s order to move to the battlefield. Early in the morning, his division had been spread as much as from Crump&#x27;s Landing. The purpose of this positioning was to protect routes that would be used by reinforcements in case &quot;his&quot; isolated division was attacked. An additional messenger from Grant found him at 11:30am, and Wallace did not get his division moving until noon. Another messenger found Wallace at 2:00pm, and notified Wallace that he was on the wrong road. Wallace believed he was to reinforce Sherman and McClernand at their original camps—he was unaware that those divisions had been pushed back toward Pittsburg Landing.

By noon, Sherman and McClernand had been pushed back to Jones Field. However, the three regiments from McDowell&#x27;s First Brigade had reunited with Sherman and McClernand, and three additional regiments arrived for reinforcement. McClernand&#x27;s troops began a counterattack with the assistance of McDowell&#x27;s brigade. The Confederates were pushed back beyond McClernand&#x27;s morning headquarters, and both sides had numerous casualties. With reinforcements, the Confederate forces began a bayonet charge at about 1:00pm that pushed McClernand and McDowell back to their original counterattack line at Jones Field.

===Early afternoon===
On the Union right, the divisions of Sherman and McClernand (plus Veatch&#x27;s brigade) were a disorganized group of individual soldiers and portions of regiments. Many soldiers had dropped their equipment and headed to Pittsburg Landing. Still, Sherman and McClernand fought on with the remnants of their divisions.

The situation at the Union center was much better. Prentiss repelled multiple attacks by the brigade commanded by Colonel Randall L. Gibson. Captain Andrew Hickenlooper&#x27;s 5th Ohio Independent Light Artillery Battery used shrapnel and canister to stop the first charge, and Confederate losses were considerable. After a third try, Gibson&#x27;s brigade suffered enough casualties (including one colonel hit in the face) that most of the men fell back, and the brigade was not engaged for the rest of the day. Among the Union soldiers killed was Major James Powell, who led the early morning patrol that discovered the Confederate army at Fraley Field. While Prentiss was defending against Gibson, Sweeny repelled Confederate attacks near Duncan Field.

The Union left, even more so than the right, was pushed back. Stuart&#x27;s two remaining Union regiments, temporarily commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Malmborg in the absence of Colonel T. Kilby Smith, made several stands east of Bell Field against two of Bragg&#x27;s brigades. Fortunately for the Union army, Bragg&#x27;s hungry men exhausted their ammunition and pillaged food from the Union camps instead of continuing the attack. Around 2:15pm, Smith ordered Stuart&#x27;s brigade to withdraw, and by 2:30pm Stuart&#x27;s brigade was done fighting for the day.

While Stuart was fighting, the adjacent position in the Union line was occupied by McArthur&#x27;s partial brigade. McArthur&#x27;s force was attacked around 2:00pm by one of Breckinridge&#x27;s brigades. Despite reinforcements, McArthur fell back about 300 yards north of the Peach Orchard where he stabilized his line 20 minutes later. On McArthur&#x27;s right, Hurlbut&#x27;s division was also under attack, causing it to fall back. Most of the attackers were from Breckinridge&#x27;s Third Brigade, commanded by Colonel Walter S. Statham. As the Union troops fell back, they would pause to shoot at the oncoming Confederates. Artillery was also used to slow the attackers.

====Johnston killed====
General Albert Sidney Johnston rode as much as 40 paces in front of Breckinridge&#x27;s line. His uniform was torn from bullets in several places, and the heel of one of his boots was gone. After sending an order to Colonel Statham, an object could be heard striking Johnston. Although blood could be seen dripping from his leg, the general did not show concern. Shortly afterwards, he was slumping in his saddle. Asked if he was wounded, Johnston replied &quot;Yes, and I fear seriously.&quot; Johnston bled to death from a torn popliteal artery in his right leg. Although a tourniquet might have saved Johnston&#x27;s life, his personal physician had been sent elsewhere to treat the wounded. Johnston died about south of the Bell Farm at 2:30pm. He was the highest-ranking soldier killed in combat in the American Civil War.

With the death of Johnston, Beauregard officially became the Confederate army&#x27;s commander. Some historians argue that since Beauregard was directing the army from the rear while Johnston was at the front, Beauregard already had the role of army commander. The Confederate attack on its right (Union left) stalled after Johnston&#x27;s death, and many exhausted Confederate soldiers drank from what became known as the &quot;Bloody Pond&quot; located between the Peach Orchard and Wicker Field. The lull was caused more by the exhaustion and disorganized condition of the Confederate army than mourning for Johnston or Beauregard&#x27;s lack of action. Beauregard sent Brigadier General Daniel Ruggles to coordinate an attack on the Hornet&#x27;s Nest.

====Union left and right====

At 2:50pm, Lieutenant William Gwin, commander of the USS &quot;Tyler&quot;, put his gunboat into action by firing on the Confederate batteries near the Union left. After an hour, Gwin was joined by the USS &quot;Lexington&quot;, and the two gunboats positioned themselves about three–fourths of a mile (1.21 km) south of Pittsburg Landing. At first, the shelling (gunboat shells were larger than those used by field artillery) had more of a psychological impact than a destructive one.

On the ground at the Union left, McArthur&#x27;s partial brigade fought the Confederate brigades commanded by brigadier generals John K. Jackson and John S. Bowen. With Stuart now gone, McArthur was also getting outflanked by Chalmers&#x27;s Brigade. Between 3:00 and 4:00pm, McArthur moved all the way back to Pittsburg Landing. Hurlbut&#x27;s line was also falling back, and only one regiment remained by 4:30pm when Hurlbut ordered it to the rear.

===Late afternoon===

Sometime in the late afternoon, Grant assigned Colonel Joseph Dana Webster, a veteran of the Mexican–American War, the task of setting up a defensive position at Pittsburg Landing. Webster used stragglers and noncombatant personnel. He began rounding up artillery pieces, including siege guns and any batteries (or partial batteries) that retreated back to the landing. He eventually assembled about 50 artillery pieces, and they were positioned on a ridge on the east side of the battlefield.

At the Union right, Grant visited Sherman around 3:00pm, and found a difficult situation. The remaining regiments had few men, ammunition was low, and more men were either leaving or serving with other units. Some regiments had so many losses that they were ordered to Pittsburg Landing where they could reform. The Union line at this time was back to Jones Field and the surrounding area. The Confederate army facing Sherman and McClernand was reorganizing, and some of the units were shifted to the Hornet&#x27;s Nest. After another attack at 4:00pm, Sherman and McClernand fell back further around 5:00pm.

On the Union left, Bragg tried to pursue the retreating Union soldiers, but was harassed by Union gunboats firing with increasing accuracy. The Tennessee River was near high tide, and the Union gunboat leaders had discovered that by elevating their guns and using lower charges, they could hit targets close to the river. The &quot;Tyler&quot; had some direct hits on Chalmers&#x27;s Brigade beginning at 5:35pm.

====Hornet&#x27;s Nest becomes focus====

The Confederate army spent a considerable amount of time and resources assaulting the Hornet&#x27;s Nest instead of bypassing it. Historians&#x27; estimates of the number of separate infantry charges, including those from earlier in the morning, range from eight to fourteen. An estimated 10,000 Confederate soldiers were involved. At 3:30pm, the Confederate army began moving all available artillery pieces into positions around the Hornet&#x27;s Nest. Soon they had, at the time, the largest concentration of field artillery (over 50 pieces) ever on the North American continent. This concentration, known as &quot;Ruggles&#x27;s Battery&quot; was led by Brigadier General Ruggles. In his report, Ruggles claimed responsibility for assembling the batteries, but multiple people may have been involved—including Major Francis A. Shoup (Hardee&#x27;s artillery chief) and Brigadier General James Trudeau. By 4:00pm, the Confederate artillery was firing on Wallace and Prentiss in the Hornet&#x27;s Nest. Confederate artillery was concentrated near Duncan Field and to the south near the Eastern Corinth Road. It was not until 4:30pm that all Confederate artillery batteries were engaged, and at least one historian believes their effectiveness has been exaggerated.

Shortly after 4:00pm, Hurlbut was gone from the east side of the Hornet&#x27;s Nest, and McClernand had fallen back about a half mile (0.8 km) from the west side. Realizing that they were going to be surrounded, Brigadier General W.H.L. Wallace began leading his division north. Around 4:15pm, he was mortally wounded as a portion of his division escaped encirclement. A ravine north of the Sunken Road near Cloud Field became known as &quot;Hell&#x27;s Hollow&quot;, and over 1,000 Union soldiers were captured there. By 4:45pm, most of Wallace&#x27;s division was removed from the battlefield, and Prentiss was left with about 2,000 men. Around 5:30pm, various Union regiments began surrendering (including Prentiss), and approximately 2,200 Union soldiers were captured. In his memoirs, Grant was critical of Prentiss for not making a timely withdrawal. However, the Hornet&#x27;s Nest stand by Prentiss and W.H.L. Wallace (who was there longer and had more men under his command) allowed Grant more time to prepare his Last Line.

===Evening===

By the time the Hornet&#x27;s Nest fell, Grant&#x27;s men had a defensive line from Pittsburg Landing to the Hamburg-Savannah Road and further north. Sherman commanded the right of the line, and McClernand took the center. On the left were the remnants of W.H.L. Wallace&#x27;s division (commanded by Tuttle), plus Hurlbut&#x27;s division. At the landing were 10,000 to 15,000 stragglers and noncombatants. The line included the artillery assembled by Colonel Webster, and the two gunboats were close by. Grant and Webster rode up and down the line, urging the men to keep firing at their enemy.

The advance of Buell&#x27;s army, from Nelson&#x27;s division, had begun arriving around 5:00pm. Its 36th Indiana Infantry Regiment was placed on the east side of Grant&#x27;s Last Line in time to help defend against an attack. The two navy gunboats helped defend, and the &quot;Lexington&quot; fired 32 rounds into the attacking Confederate force in only 10minutes. The Confederate attack was repelled, and shortly after 6:00pm Beauregard called off all attacks. Buell and his army, and some in Grant&#x27;s army, believed they had saved Grant&#x27;s Army of the Tennessee. Grant had a differing opinion, believing that by 6:00pm the Confederate army was worn out.

====Beauregard&#x27;s situation====
When Beauregard called off all attacks, it was near sunset and he assumed Grant&#x27;s army could be eliminated on the next day. He had received a telegram saying Buell&#x27;s army was in Alabama, and did not know Grant was already being reinforced. The Confederate army was badly disorganized, and it had just finished taking prisoners from the Hornet&#x27;s Nest around 5:30pm. Attacks after dark were rare because of problems with friendly fire, and darkness would occur soon. The exhausted Confederate army already had about 8,000 casualties.

For many years after the battle, critics believed Beauregard had squandered an opportunity to finish Grant&#x27;s army. Modern historians, such as Cunningham and Daniel, disagree with that assessment. Cunningham wrote that Beauregard&#x27;s critics ignore &quot;the existing situation on the Shiloh battlefield&quot;—including Confederate disorganization, time before sunset, and Grant&#x27;s strong position augmented by gunboats. Daniel wrote that the thought that &quot;the Confederates could have permanently breached or pulverized the Federal line in an additional hour or so of piecemeal night assaults simply lacks plausibility.&quot; He mentions that it took the Confederates six hours to conquer the Hornet&#x27;s Nest, and Grant&#x27;s Last Line was a stronger position. He also cites exhaustion, low ammunition, and one staff officer&#x27;s belief that one third of the Confederate army was plundering instead of fighting.

Beauregard spent the evening near Shiloh Church in what had been Sherman&#x27;s tent. Most of the Confederate army moved back to the original Union camps. Beauregard sent a telegram to Richmond discussing &quot;a complete victory, driving the enemy from every position.&quot; Many of the Confederate troops believed that the battle was essentially over, and spent time plundering the camps. Some soldiers took their loot and began walking back to Corinth. Some of the Confederate troops were now armed with better weapons than the ones they had at the beginning of the day. Austrian, Enfield, and Springfield rifles were taken from dead, wounded, captured, or fleeing Union soldiers.

It began raining at 10:00pm, and at midnight the rain became a storm with thunder and lightning. This, combined with the constant shelling by Union gunboats throughout the night, made it difficult for the exhausted Confederates to get any sleep. Because of the exhaustion and the belief that Grant&#x27;s army was almost finished, the Confederate forces were not reorganized. No plans or orders were made for the next day, and it was thought the various commands would regroup at that time for a &quot;final mop-up action&quot;. The original Confederate plan was to push Grant&#x27;s army away from Pittsburg Landing, and pin it against the northern creeks where it could not move quickly or get resupplied. Instead, Grant had been forced back to a defensible position at Pittsburg Landing where he could be reinforced and resupplied.

====Grant&#x27;s situation====
Grant&#x27;s army had 7,000 men killed and wounded, 3,000 more captured, and 10,000 men who were afraid to fight. Before being reinforced, he had an estimated 18,000 fighters formed on his Last Line. Since most of the Union camps had been captured, these hungry and tired men would have to sleep in the open without blankets, and rain and cold weather added to their misery. At 7:15pm, 5,800 fresh troops from Lew Wallace&#x27;s division arrived at the battlefield and were positioned next to Sherman. Brigadier General Thomas Crittenden&#x27;s division from Buell&#x27;s army began arriving at 9:00pm, and two hours later the entire division was at the landing. Eventually, Buell would have nearly 18,000 men available for the battle. The Union line from west to east consisted of the divisions commanded by Lew Wallace, Sherman, McClernand, Hurlbut, Crittenden, and Nelson. Prentiss&#x27; division was effectively destroyed, and Tuttle was behind the line trying to reorganize W.H.L. Wallace&#x27;s division.

Earlier in the day, Colonel James B. McPherson, Grant&#x27;s chief engineer, asked Grant if preparations should be started for a retreat. Grant&#x27;s response was: &quot;Retreat? No! I propose to attack at daylight and whip them.&quot; Buell met with Sherman at sunset, and learned that Grant planned to attack at sunrise. An understanding was made that Grant would have the west side of the line, while Buell would plan his own attack on the east side. Despite Grant&#x27;s seniority, Buell considered himself independent, and Grant chose not to consult with him that evening. Sherman found Grant resting under a tree around midnight, and said: &quot;Well, Grant, we&#x27;ve had the devil&#x27;s own day, haven&#x27;t we?&quot; Grant replied: &quot;Yes. Lick&#x27;em tomorrow, though.&quot;

==Battle, April 7==
Between midnight and 4:00am, Brigadier General Alexander M. McCook&#x27;s division from Buell&#x27;s Army of the Ohio arrived in Savannah. The first unit from this division to arrive at Pittsburg Landing came ashore around 4:00am. Elsewhere, the Confederate 47th Tennessee Infantry Regiment was marching to the battlefield. This poorly-armed regiment of 600 raw recruits was the only reinforcement Beauregard received, and it did not arrive until 8:00am. After deducting casualties and those who had abandoned their posts, Beauregard&#x27;s Confederate army now numbered fewer than 20,000 fighters.

===Union counterattacks begin===

On the east side of the Union line, Buell&#x27;s attack began at 5:00am with Nelson&#x27;s three brigades. A few hours later, Nelson was joined on his right by Crittenden. The two divisions advanced, dispersed enemy skirmishers, and were gradually joined on Crittenden&#x27;s right by brigades from McCook&#x27;s division. McCook did not have all three of his brigades available until close to noon. On the Confederate side, Hardee commanded the right that faced Nelson, with the division commanded by Brigadier General Jones M. Withers as his most organized force. The skirmishers that Nelson had chased off earlier were Colonel Nathan Bedford Forrest&#x27;s cavalry regiment and small portions of Chalmers&#x27;s Brigade from Withers&#x27; division. Behind the skirmishers were Chalmers&#x27;s Brigade and a makeshift brigade of three regiments. A mix of regiments formed the line further west, and several batteries gave artillery support.

At the Davis Wheat Field, a small field between Barnes Field and the Peach Orchard, the brigade commanded by Colonel William B. Hazen, took more than half of the losses Nelson&#x27;s division received for the whole day. More fighting took place near Sara Bell Field, and after three hours of fighting it became stalemated. Both sides withdrew around noon, putting Nelson back at Wicker Field. During this fighting, Hardee was slightly wounded, although he led a counterattack. West of Nelson, Crittenden and McCook advanced before being forced back to Duncan field. At noon, Buell&#x27;s army had control of the Hornet&#x27;s Nest.

Grant&#x27;s attack began with Lew Wallace&#x27;s fresh division driving Pond&#x27;s exhausted brigade away from Jones Field. After a Confederate counterattack by Gibson and Wood, Sherman brought his division to the line and the Confederates were pushed back. McClernand and Hurlbut joined the fight, and all four Union divisions advanced at 10:30am. At that time, Cleburne&#x27;s brigade of 800 men took significant casualties when they unsuccessfully assaulted the Union force.

===Afternoon fighting===

Buell attacked again shortly after noon. In about two hours, Nelson and Crittenden reached the Hamburg-Purdy Road. Further west, McCook advanced westward on the Corinth-Pittsburg Landing Road, which caused a gap with Crittenden. The gap was filled by brigades from Grant&#x27;s army that had been held in reserve. The Confederate army had held off Buell&#x27;s fresh troops for a total of six hours, but their resistance was close to ending.

On Grant&#x27;s side of the battlefield, Sherman and McClernand were stopped at noon when Cheatham&#x27;s Confederate division attacked east of the crossroads and north of Water Oaks Pond. The two Union divisions were driven north about . Despite light opposition at his front, Lew Wallace put his division in a defensive position, and did not resume the offensive until Sherman and McClernand had pushed back Cheatham&#x27;s attackers. Bragg formed another line by Water Oaks Pond, and a two–hour fight ensued with Beauregard personally leading various Confederate units.

McCook&#x27;s westward advance (instead of south), which began at 1:30pm, meant that Bragg had Lew Wallace, Sherman, and McClernand on his front—and McCook on his right flank. After Bragg fell back south of the Hamburg-Purdy Road, Beauregard counterattacked using a force that was mostly Wood&#x27;s brigade. Near Water Oaks Pond, this force pushed McCook back until McCook regrouped and repelled the attackers. Soon Beauregard and Bragg were forced back, and Union troops crossed the Hamburg-Purdy Road at 2:30pm.

===Beauregard withdraws===
All morning, Beauregard hoped that the arrival of 20,000 men under the command of Brigadier General Earl Van Dorn would change the battle momentum back to favoring the Confederates. He was eventually notified that Van Dorn was still far away, so preparations for a withdrawal to Corinth began about 1:00pm. At about 2:00pm, Breckinridge began forming his corps into a rear guard position near Shiloh Church. Confederate batteries around Shiloh Church began a bombardment campaign to deceive the Union soldiers into thinking the Confederate army was still present. Around 3:30pm, the last of the Confederate artillery was hauled away toward Corinth.

Grant and Buell did not pursue the Confederate army, and have been criticized for their decisions. One historian called this the &quot;final Federal Blunder&quot;, and believed that Lew Wallace&#x27;s fresh division should have been sent in pursuit. It started to rain at 6:30pm, and the rain turned to hail as the temperature dropped. The battle was over with a huge number of casualties on both sides.

==Fallen Timbers, April 8==
At 10:00am on April 8, Union forces commanded by Sherman and Wood began a pursuit of the Confederate forces. Breckinridge&#x27;s covering force included about 350 cavalrymen commanded by Colonel Forrest. This group was a mixture of Forrest&#x27;s men, John Hunt Morgan&#x27;s Kentucky Cavalry, Texas Rangers, and the 1st Mississippi Cavalry (Adams&#x27; Cavalry). They were armed with revolvers and shotguns, and were instructed to fire only when they were within 20 steps of the enemy. On the left, two brigades from Wood&#x27;s Union division skirmished with Wirt Adams&#x27; Cavalry Regiment and then returned to camp. On the right, a group led by Forrest attacked Sherman&#x27;s men as they were clearing fallen timber near a small creek, causing some of them to run for their lives. Unofficial Union casualties were 15 killed, 25 wounded, and 53 taken prisoner. Among the few Confederate wounded was Forrest, who escaped after being shot at close range. Sherman ended the pursuit, and Breckinridge continued south.

==Aftermath==
===Casualties===
Multiple sources list Union casualties as 13,047, with 1,754 killed, 8,408 wounded, and 2,885 missing or captured. Grant&#x27;s army had 10,944 casualties, while Buell&#x27;s had 2,103. Without counting those captured or missing, the brigades commanded by Sweeny, Veatch, and Colonel Nelson G. Williams all had over 600 killed or wounded. The report in the &quot;Official Records&quot; lists two brigade commanders as killed or mortally wounded, five wounded (including Sweeny), and one captured. One historian believes that the high number of officer losses caused casualty figures to be understated, and that they really total closer to 14,500.

Confederate casualties totaled to 10,699, with 1,728 killed, 8,012 wounded, and 959 missing or captured. Additional sources agree with those figures. The Confederate totals do not include reporting for cavalry or the 47th Tennessee Infantry Regiment that arrived for the second day of the battle. Similar to the understatement for Union casualties, one historian believes Confederate casualties were probably closer to 12,000. Using the commonly quoted statistics, Cleburne&#x27;s brigade had 790 wounded and 188 killed, both numbers higher than those for any brigade in any of the armies at the battle. In addition to the wounding of Johnston (mortal) and Hardee (slight), Beauregard&#x27;s report mentions six casualties for major generals and brigadier generals—one killed, three severely wounded, one slightly wounded, and one injured when his horse was shot. Another Confederate soldier killed was Samuel B. Todd, brother of President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s wife, Mary Todd Lincoln.

At the time, the battle was the largest fought in America and had the highest number of casualties so far in the war. The high number of casualties helped convince many Union leaders that the war was not going to end quickly in the west. About 20,000 men were killed or wounded at Shiloh, while earlier major battles at Manassas (a.k.a. Bull Run), Wilson&#x27;s Creek, Fort Donelson, and Pea Ridge &quot;combined&quot; to only 12,000. Shiloh&#x27;s total casualties of 23,746 (which may be understated) puts it in the top ten (6th or 7th) in the American Civil War.

===Reactions and significance===

Initially, news on the battle was positive for Grant. That changed a week later, especially when a &quot;somewhat exaggerated&quot; newspaper report by Whitelaw Reid (under a pen name) was released. Largely based on testimony from Union deserters and stragglers, the article said that Grant was surprised, and falsely claimed that Union soldiers were bayoneted in their tents. Only Buell, who according to Reid had saved Grant, was treated as a hero. Self-serving accounts from some of Buell&#x27;s officers also swayed public opinion, and false rumors circulated that Grant had been drunk. Among the more justified criticisms of Grant was the lack of fortifications at the camps around Pittsburg Landing; one historian considers this a critical mistake. At least two of Grant&#x27;s generals counseled against entrenching, and Grant believed that enemy troops would not leave their own entrenched position.

Lew Wallace received criticism for his inability to get his division to the battlefield in a timely manner, and he was eventually removed from Grant&#x27;s army. His division should have been ready to move from Crump&#x27;s Landing, which is from Pittsburg Landing via the River Road. Instead, he marched his division the wrong way, and the countermarch was delayed because he directed his original vanguard to move to the rear so it could become the vanguard when the division reversed its march. He may have also lost time by marching down a rugged path through cornfields and pastures. Critics also accused him of &quot;dilatoriness&quot;, or slow procrastination. This portion of his criticism was unjustified since his men moved in six and a half hours—similar to the rate for Nelson&#x27;s division. Grant wrote in 1863 that a different commander could have moved Wallace&#x27;s division to the battlefield before 1:00pm. Wallace spent the next few decades defending his actions. In 1885, Grant received a letter from the widow of Brigadier General William H. L. Wallace that had been written by Lew Wallace to her husband on April 5, 1862. The letter provided enough information about Lew Wallace&#x27;s preparations and route choice that Grant felt Wallace was unjustly criticized—the route selection was justified given that Wallace did not know Sherman had been pushed back and orders did not specify which road to take. These conclusions appeared in &quot;Century Magazine&quot; in July 1885 and as a note in &quot;Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant&quot;. Wallace&#x27;s postwar life was more successful as an author, and he became well known for writing the best–selling novel &quot;Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ&quot;.

Some of the more &quot;savage denunciations&quot; of Grant came from politicians representing Ohio and Iowa—home states of many of the men who ran away when fighting started. One politician complained to Lincoln, saying Grant was an incompetent drunk that was a political liability. Lincoln&#x27;s response was &quot;I can&#x27;t spare this man; he fights.&quot; Sherman, who could have been one of the battle&#x27;s scapegoats and did not get along with the press, received more praise than criticism. Halleck praised his performance and requested a promotion for him, noting that Sherman had &quot;three horses killed under him&quot; and was wounded twice. Halleck arrived at Pittsburg Landing on April 11 and took personal command—as he had planned earlier. On April30, he named Grant as his second-in-command. This was a meaningless position, but Halleck&#x27;s solution to the Grant criticism was a &quot;de facto&quot; suspension that satisfied the critics.

On April 8, Confederate president Jefferson Davis reported to the Confederate congress that according to the latest accounts, Johnston had gained a complete victory. A last-minute addition to his speech mentioned Johnston&#x27;s death. Before the battle, the public had wanted Johnston removed because of the loss of most of Tennessee. Now he was a hero. Over the next few days, more information about the battle became available. The initial perception was that only &quot;untoward events&quot; had saved the Union army from destruction, and the withdrawal to Corinth was part of a strategic plan. Eventually, critics began to blame Beauregard for the defeat, citing the lack of a twilight attack on the first day of the battle.

Confederate President Davis believed that the loss of Albert Sidney Johnston was the &quot;turning point of our fate&quot; in the Western Theater. With the loss at Shiloh, the likelihood of the Confederacy regaining control of the upper Mississippi Valley was severely diminished, and the large number of casualties represented the start of an unwinnable war of attrition. The victory at Shiloh also placed the Union army in a strategic position to infiltrate and capture key points in the south. Waiting until he was fully reinforced and resupplied, Halleck began a &quot;painfully slow&quot; movement to Corinth on April 29. Arriving on the morning of May 30, Union troops found the city abandoned. New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Memphis were overrun by Union navy forces over the next three months. By July, Halleck was promoted to chief of staff in Washington, and Grant became commander of the now larger District of West Tennessee. Grant would go on to lead the Siege of Vicksburg, where nearly 30,000 Confederate troops surrendered on July 4, 1863.

==Battlefield preservation==

The War Department established the Pittsburg Landing National Cemetery in 1866, and its name was changed to Shiloh National Cemetery in 1889. The Shiloh National Military Park was established by the United States Congress on December27, 1894. Originally under the administration of the War Department, the park was transferred to the National Park Service of the Department of the Interior in 1933. The American Battlefield Trust, a non-profit battlefield land preservation organization, has been involved with its partners in saving more than of the Shiloh and Fallen Timbers battlefields in 30 different transactions from 2001 to 2023. Sites such as the Bloody Pond, Hornet&#x27;s Nest and Pittsburg Landing are part of the park. The Shiloh Church at the park is a nearly exact representation of the original, constructed using 150-year-old timber. Additional points in the park include Fraley Field, the Peach Orchard, Ruggles&#x27; Battery, Grant&#x27;s Last Line, and the site of Johnston&#x27;s death. In 2022, the park consisted of over .

<doc id="144156" wikidata="Q13042834" url="?curid=144156" title="Mussel">
<text>Mussel () is the common name used for members of several families of bivalve molluscs, from saltwater and freshwater habitats. These groups have in common a shell whose outline is elongated and asymmetrical compared with other edible clams, which are often more or less rounded or oval.

The word &quot;mussel&quot; is frequently used to mean the bivalves of the marine family Mytilidae, most of which live on exposed shores in the intertidal zone, attached by means of their strong byssal threads (&quot;beard&quot;) to a firm substrate. A few species (in the genus &quot;Bathymodiolus&quot;) have colonised hydrothermal vents associated with deep ocean ridges.

In most marine mussels the shell is longer than it is wide, being wedge-shaped or asymmetrical. The external colour of the shell is often dark blue, blackish, or brown, while the interior is silvery and somewhat nacreous.

The common name &quot;mussel&quot; is also used for many freshwater bivalves, including the freshwater pearl mussels. Freshwater mussel species inhabit lakes, ponds, rivers, creeks, canals, and they are classified in a different subclass of bivalves, despite some very superficial similarities in appearance.

Freshwater zebra mussels and their relatives in the family Dreissenidae are not related to previously mentioned groups, even though they resemble many &quot;Mytilus&quot; species in shape, and live attached to rocks and other hard surfaces in a similar manner, using a byssus. They are classified with the Heterodonta, the taxonomic group which includes most of the bivalves commonly referred to as &quot;clams&quot;.

==General anatomy==


The mussel&#x27;s external shell is composed of two hinged halves or &quot;valves&quot;. The valves are joined on the outside by a ligament, and are closed when necessary by strong internal muscles (anterior and posterior adductor muscles). Mussel shells carry out a variety of functions, including support for soft tissues, protection from predators and protection against desiccation.

The shell has three layers. In the pearly mussels there is an inner iridescent layer of nacre (mother-of-pearl) composed of calcium carbonate, which is continuously secreted by the mantle; the prismatic layer, a middle layer of chalky white crystals of calcium carbonate in a protein matrix; and the periostracum, an outer pigmented layer resembling a skin. The periostracum is composed of a protein called conchin, and its function is to protect the prismatic layer from abrasion and dissolution by acids (especially important in freshwater forms where the decay of leaf materials produces acids).

Like most bivalves, mussels have a large organ called a foot. In freshwater mussels, the foot is large, muscular, and generally hatchet-shaped. It is used to pull the animal through the substrate (typically sand, gravel, or silt) in which it lies partially buried. It does this by repeatedly advancing the foot through the substrate, expanding the end so it serves as an anchor, and then pulling the rest of the animal with its shell forward. It also serves as a fleshy anchor when the animal is stationary.

In marine mussels, the foot is smaller, tongue-like in shape, with a groove on the ventral surface which is continuous with the byssus pit. In this pit, a viscous secretion is exuded, entering the groove and hardening gradually upon contact with sea water. This forms extremely tough, strong, elastic, byssal threads that secure the mussel to its substrate allowing it to remain sessile in areas of high flow. The byssal thread is also sometimes used by mussels as a defensive measure, to tether predatory molluscs, such as dog whelks, that invade mussel beds, immobilising them and thus starving them to death.

In cooking, the byssus of the mussel is known as the &quot;beard&quot; and is removed during preparation, often after cooking when the mussel has opened.

==Life habits==

===Feeding===
Both marine and freshwater mussels are filter feeders; they feed on plankton and other microscopic sea creatures which are free-floating in seawater. A mussel draws water in through its incurrent siphon. The water is then brought into the branchial chamber by the actions of the cilia located on the gills for ciliary-mucus feeding. The wastewater exits through the excurrent siphon. The labial palps finally funnel the food into the mouth, where digestion begins.

Marine mussels are usually found clumping together on wave-washed rocks, each attached to the rock by its byssus. The clumping habit helps hold the mussels firm against the force of the waves. At low tide mussels in the middle of a clump will undergo less water loss because of water capture by the other mussels.

===Reproduction===
Both marine and freshwater mussels are gonochoristic, with separate male and female individuals. In marine mussels, fertilization occurs outside the body, with a larval stage that drifts for three weeks to six months, before settling on a hard surface as a young mussel. There, it is capable of moving slowly by means of attaching and detaching byssal threads to attain a better life position.

Freshwater mussels reproduce sexually. Sperm is released by the male directly into the water and enters the female via the incurrent siphon. After fertilization, the eggs develop into a larval stage called a glochidium (plural glochidia), which temporarily parasitizes fish, attaching themselves to the fish&#x27;s fins or gills. Prior to their release, the glochidia grow in the gills of the host fish where they are constantly flushed with oxygen-rich water. In some species, release occurs when a fish attempts to attack the mussel&#x27;s mantle flaps, which are shaped like minnows or other prey, an example of aggressive mimicry.

Glochidia are generally species-specific, and will only live if they find the correct fish host. Once the larval mussels attach to the fish, the fish body reacts to cover them with cells forming a cyst, where the glochidia remain for two to five weeks (depending on temperature). They grow, break free from the host, and drop to the bottom of the water to begin an independent life.

===Predators===
Marine mussels are eaten by humans, starfish, seabirds, and by numerous species of predatory marine gastropods in the family Muricidae, such as the dog whelk, &quot;Nucella lapillus&quot;. Freshwater mussels are eaten by muskrats, otters, raccoons, ducks, baboons, humans, and geese.

==Distribution and habitat==

Marine mussels are abundant in the low and mid intertidal zone in temperate seas globally. Other species of marine mussel live in tropical intertidal areas, but not in the same huge numbers as in temperate zones.

Certain species of marine mussels prefer salt marshes or quiet bays, while others thrive in pounding surf, completely covering wave-washed rocks. Some species have colonized abyssal depths near hydrothermal vents. The South African white mussel exceptionally does not bind itself to rocks but burrows into sandy beaches extending two tubes above the sand surface for ingestion of food and water and exhausting wastes.

Freshwater mussels inhabit permanent lakes, rivers, canals and streams throughout the world except in the polar regions. They require a constant source of cool, clean water. They prefer water with a substantial mineral content, using calcium carbonate to build their shells.

==Aquaculture==

In 2005, China accounted for 40% of the global mussel catch according to a FAO study. Within Europe, where mussels have been cultivated for centuries, Spain remained the industry leader. Aquaculture of mussels in North America began in the 1970s. In the US, the northeast and northwest have significant mussel aquaculture operations, where &quot;Mytilus edulis&quot; (blue mussel) is most commonly grown. While the mussel industry in the US has increased, in North America, 80% of cultured mussels are produced in Prince Edward Island in Canada.
In Washington state, an estimated 2.9 million pounds of mussels were harvested in 2010, valued at roughly $4.3M. In New Zealand, &quot;Perna canaliculus&quot; (the New Zealand green-lipped mussel), industry produces over 140,000 metric tons (150,000 short tons) annually and in 2009 was valued in excess of NZ$250 million.

===Culture methods===
Freshwater mussels are used as host animals for the cultivation of freshwater pearls. Some species of marine mussel, including the blue mussel (&quot;Mytilus edulis&quot;) and the New Zealand green-lipped mussel (&quot;Perna canaliculus&quot;), are also cultivated as a source of food.In some areas of the world, mussel farmers collect naturally occurring marine mussel seed for transfer to more appropriate growing areas, however, most North American mussel farmers rely on hatchery-produced seed. Growers typically purchase seed after it has set (about 1mm in size) or after it has been nursed in upwellers for 3-6 additional weeks and is 2-3mm. The seed is then typically reared in a nursery environment, where it is transferred to a material with a suitable surface for later relocation to the growing area. After about three months in the nursery, mussel seed is &quot;socked&quot; (placed in a tube-like mesh material) and hung on longlines or rafts for grow-out. Within a few days, the mussels migrate to the outside of the sock for better access food sources in the water column. Mussels grow quickly and are usually ready for harvest in less than two years. Unlike other cultured bivalves, mussels use byssus threads (beard) to attach themselves to any firm substrate, which makes them suitable for a number of culture methods.

There are a variety of techniques for growing mussels.

* Bouchot culture: Intertidal growth technique, or bouchot technique: pilings, known in French as bouchots, are planted at sea; ropes, on which the mussels grow, are tied in a spiral on the pilings; some mesh netting prevents the mussels from falling away. This method needs an extended tidal zone.
* On-bottom culture: On-bottom culture is based on the principle of transferring mussel seed (spat) from areas where they have settled naturally to areas where they can be placed in lower densities to increase growth rates, facilitate harvest, and control predation (Mussel farmers must remove predators and macroalgae during the growth cycle).
* Raft culture: Raft culture is a commonly used method throughout the world. Lines of rope mesh socks are seeded with young mussels and suspended vertically from a raft. The specific length of the socks depends on depth and food availability.
* Longline culture (rope culture): Mussels are cultivated extensively in New Zealand, where the most common method is to attach mussels to ropes which are hung from a rope back-bone supported by large plastic floats. The most common species cultivated in New Zealand is the New Zealand green-lipped mussel. Longline culture is the most recent development for mussel culture and are often used as an alternative to raft culture in areas that are more exposed to high wave energy. A long-line is suspended by a series of small anchored floats and ropes or socks of mussels are then suspended vertically from the line.
===Harvest===
In roughly 12–15 months, mussels reach marketable size (40mm) and are ready for harvest. Harvesting methods depend on the grow-out area and the rearing method being used. Dredges are currently used for on-bottom culture. Mussels grown on wooden poles can be harvested by hand or with a hydraulic powered system. For raft and longline culture, a platform is typically lowered under the mussel lines, which are then cut from the system and brought to the surface and dumped into containers on a nearby vessel. After harvest, mussels are typically placed in seawater tanks to rid them of impurities before marketing.
==Mussel-inspired materials==
Byssus threads secreted by the large Mediterranean pen shell, &quot;Pinna nobilis&quot;, which can be up to in length, have historically been made into cloth. Byssus cloth is a rare fabric, also known as sea silk, that is made using the byssus of pen shells as the fiber source. The byssus of &quot;Atrina pectinata&quot;, a shell of the same family, has been used in Sardinia as a substitute for critically endangered &quot;Pinna nobilis&quot;, to weave sea silk.

Byssal threads, used to anchor mussels to substrates, are now recognized as superior bonding agents. A number of studies have investigated mussel &quot;glues&quot; for industrial and surgical applications. Further, mussel adhesive proteins inspired the design of peptide mimics that were well studied for surface bioengineering of medical implants. Self-assembling mussel-inspired peptides were also shown to form functional nanostructures. Also, a peptide derived from mussel foot protein-5, a key protein in mussel adhesion, displayed antibacterial properties and served as inspiration for the design of a new class of peptide-based antibacterial adhesive hydrogels, which are active against drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria.

Additionally byssal threads have provided insight into the construction of artificial tendons.

==Environmental applications==
Mussels are widely used as bio-indicators to monitor the health of aquatic environments in both fresh water and the marine environments. They are particularly useful since they are distributed worldwide and they are sessile. These characteristics ensure that they are representative of the environment where they are sampled or placed. Their population status or structure, physiology, behaviour or the level of contamination with elements or compounds can indicate the status of the ecosystem. Transplanted caged mussel were used in a study to monitor heavy metal contamination in coastal waters.

==Mussels and nutrient mitigation==
Marine nutrient bioextraction is the practice of farming and harvesting marine organisms such as shellfish and seaweed for the purpose of reducing nutrient pollution. Mussels and other bivalve shellfish consume phytoplankton containing nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). On average, one live mussel is 1.0% N and 0.1% P. When the mussels are harvested and removed, these nutrients are also removed from the system and recycled in the form of seafood or mussel biomass, which can be used as an organic fertilizer or animal feed-additive. These ecosystem services provided by mussels are of particular interest to those hoping to mitigate excess anthropogenic marine nutrients, particularly in eutrophic marine systems. While mussel aquaculture is actually promoted in some countries such as Sweden as a water management strategy to address coastal eutrophication, mussel farming as a nutrient mitigation tool is still in its infancy in most parts of the world. Ongoing efforts in the Baltic Sea (Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Poland) and Long Island Sound and Puget Sound in the U.S. are currently examining nutrient uptake, cost-effectiveness, and potential environmental impacts of mussel farming as a means to mitigate excess nutrients and complement traditional wastewater treatment programs.

==Conservation==

===Freshwater mussels===
Out of 511 species assessed globally, 44% of freshwater mussels listed on the IUCN Red List are classified at some level of threatened.

There are 297 known freshwater mussel taxa in the United States and Canada, which are home to the most diverse freshwater mussel fauna in the world, especially in the southeastern United States. Of the 297 known species, 213 (71.7%) taxa are listed as endangered, threatened, or of special concern. Approximately 37 North American species were considered extinct in 2004.

Out of 16 recognized freshwater mussel species in Europe, 12 are considered threatened, with varying statuses from Near Threatened to Critically Endangered. 8 species are protected by the European Union Habitats Directive across all annexes.

There are approximately 85 known species in Africa, 102 in Central America, 74 in South America, 228 in Asia (with the highest species diversity in Southeast Asia), and 33 in Australasia. The species in these areas are not as well researched as in North America and Europe. Approximately 61% of freshwater mussels in Asia had not been assessed and conservation efforts were almost non-existent. No Asian mussels were protected internationally under legislation such as CITES.

The main factors contributing to the decline of freshwater mussels include destruction by dams, increased siltation, channel alteration and the introduction of invasive species such as the zebra mussel.

==As food==
Humans have used mussels as food for thousands of years. About 17 species are edible, of which the most commonly eaten are &quot;Mytilus edulis, M. galloprovincialis, M. trossulus&quot; and &quot;Perna canaliculus&quot;. Although freshwater mussels are edible, today they are widely considered unpalatable and are rarely consumed. Freshwater mussels were once eaten extensively by native peoples of North America and some still do today.

In the United States during the Second World War, mussels were commonly served in diners and restaurants across the country. This was due to wartime rationing and shortages of red meat, such as beef and pork. Mussels became a popular substitute for most meats (with the exception of poultry).

In Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, mussels are consumed with French fries (&quot;mosselen met friet&quot; or &quot;moules-frites&quot;) or bread. In Belgium, mussels are sometimes served with fresh herbs and flavorful vegetables in a stock of butter and white wine. Fries and Belgian beer sometimes are accompaniments. A similar style of preparation is commonly found in the Rhineland where mussels are customarily served in restaurants with a side of dark bread in &quot;months containing an R&quot;, that is between September and April. In the Netherlands, mussels are sometimes served fried in batter or breadcrumbs, particularly at take-out food outlets or informal settings. In France, the &quot;Éclade des Moules&quot;, or, locally, &quot;Terré de Moules&quot;, is a mussel bake that can be found along the beaches of the Bay of Biscay.

In Italy, mussels are mixed with other seafood; they are most commonly eaten steamed, sometimes with white wine, herbs, and served with the remaining water and some lemon. In Spain, they are consumed mostly steamed, sometimes boiling white wine, onion and herbs, and served with the remaining water and some lemon. They can also be eaten as &quot;tigres&quot;, a sort of croquette using the mussel meat, shrimps and other pieces of fish in a thick bechamel then breaded and fried in the clean mussel shell. They are used in other sort of dishes such as rices or soups or commonly eaten canned in a pickling brine made of oil, vinegar, peppercorns, bay leaves and paprika.

In Turkey, mussels are either covered with flour and fried on skewers (&quot;midye tava&quot;), or filled with rice and served cold (&quot;midye dolma&quot;) and are usually consumed after alcohol (mostly raki or beer).

They are used in Ireland boiled and seasoned with vinegar, with the &quot;bray&quot; or boiling water as a supplementary hot drink.

In Cantonese cuisine, mussels are cooked in a broth of garlic and fermented black bean. In New Zealand, they are served in a chilli or garlic-based vinaigrette, processed into fritters and fried, or used as the base for a chowder.

In Brazil, it is common to see mussels being cooked and served with olive oil, usually accompanied by onion, garlic and other herbs. The plate is very popular among tourists and low classes, probably because of the hot climate that favours mussels reproduction.

In India, mussels are popular in Kerala, Maharashtra, Karnataka-Bhatkal, and Goa. They are either prepared with drumsticks, breadfruit or other vegetables, or filled with rice and coconut paste with spices and served hot. Fried mussels (&#x27;Kadukka&#x27; കടുക്ക in Malayalam) of north Kerala especially in Thalassery are a spicy, favored delicacy.
In coastal Karnataka Bearys prepare special rice balls stuffed with spicy fried mussels and steamed, locally known as &quot;pachilede pindi&quot;.

===Preparation===


Mussels can be smoked, boiled, steamed, roasted, barbecued or fried in butter or vegetable oil. They can be used in soups, salads and sauces. As with all shellfish, except shrimp, mussels should be checked to ensure they are still alive just before they are cooked; enzymes quickly break down the meat and make them unpalatable or poisonous after dying or uncooked. Some mussels might contain toxins. A simple criterion is that live mussels, when in the air, will shut tightly when disturbed. Open, unresponsive mussels are dead, and must be discarded. Unusually heavy, wild-caught, closed mussels may be discarded as they may contain only mud or sand. (They can be tested by slightly opening the shell halves.) A thorough rinse in water and removal of &quot;the beard&quot; is suggested. Mussel shells usually open when cooked, revealing the cooked soft parts. Historically, it has been believed that after cooking all the mussels should have opened and those that have not are not safe to eat and should be discarded. However, according to marine biologist Nick Ruello, this advice may have arisen from an old, poorly researched cookbook&#x27;s advice, which has now become an assumed truism for all shellfish. Ruello found 11.5% of all mussels failed to open during cooking, but when forced open, 100% were &quot;both adequately cooked and safe to eat.&quot;

Although mussels are valued as food, mussel poisoning due to toxic planktonic organisms can be a danger along some coastlines. For instance, mussels should be avoided during the warmer months along the west coast of the United States. This poisoning is usually due to a bloom of dinoflagellates (red tides), which contain toxins. The dinoflagellates and their toxin are harmless to mussels, even when concentrated by the mussel&#x27;s filter feeding, but the concentrated toxins cause serious illness if the mussels are consumed by humans, including paralytic shellfish poisoning.

===Nutrition highlights===

*Excellent source of: selenium (44.8 μg), and vitamin B12 (12 μg)

They first appeared in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (vol. 2) #1 (July 1960), and were created by John Broome and Gil Kane. The Guardians of the Universe have been adapted to a number of films, television programs, and video games.

The Guardians of the Universe are the founders and leaders of the interstellar law enforcement agency known as the Green Lantern Corps, which they administer from their homeworld Oa at the center of the Universe. The Guardians resemble short humans with blue skin and white hair. They are depicted as being immortal and are the oldest living beings created in the Universe.

==History==

===Background===
The Guardians evolved on the planet Maltus, being among the first intelligent life forms in the universe. At this time, they were tall, grayish-blue humanoids with black hair, who roughly resembled humans except for their skin color. They became scientists and thinkers, experimenting on the worlds around them. One experiment led to the creation of a new species, the Psions. In a pivotal moment, billions of years ago, a Maltusian named Krona used time-bending technology to observe the beginning of the Universe. However, this experiment, and later attempts to stop it, unleashed disaster upon all existence. Originally, the experiment splintered the Universe into the Multiverse and created the evil Anti-Matter Universe of Qward. Following the retroactive destruction of the Multiverse, it was revealed that Krona flooded the beginning of the Universe with entropy causing it &quot;to be born old&quot;.

Feeling responsible for this, the Maltusians relocated to the planet Oa (at &quot;the center of the Universe&quot;) and took on the mantle of the Guardians. Their goal was simple: combat evil and create an orderly universe. They acted quickly on that goal. During this period, the conditions of Oa caused them to evolve once again: they now lost half of their height, with white hair and larger heads. They now act as the leaders of the Green Lantern Corps, an interstellar police force which patrols the universe.

===Consequences===
Desiring to bring order, peace and harmony to all the universe, they created a mechanized police force composed of powerful, self-aware androids known as Manhunters. These Manhunters, resembling uniformed, blue-skinned humanoids, operated as cosmic police officers, much like the later Green Lanterns. They protected civilization and maintained peace in the Universe for millions of years, patrolling 3600 sectors into which the cosmos had been divided.

One day, the Manhunters collectively changed their directives and set out on a campaign to eradicate all organic life. Starting with Sector 666, they killed the people they had been created to protect, eradicating almost all life in the entire sector before the Guardians stopped them. Most Manhunters were decommissioned after the massacre of Sector 666, but the ones that escaped became the sworn enemies of their former masters and remained so until modern times.

The Manhunter rebellion caused the Guardians to split into groups with different goals. The Controllers believe the only way to protect the Universe is to control it. The Zamarons, consisting entirely of female Oans, felt no need to involve themselves in the universe&#x27;s problems. Over the years, both groups evolved to look dissimilar to the Guardians. Other groups also left the Guardians; one such group settled on Earth, becoming the source of leprechaun legends. The Apokolips campaign ended in a truce, with the Guardians forced to abandon a soldier (Raker Qarrigat) to Darkseid. Fearing dissension, they ordered all records of the Campaign expunged.

Survivors of the massacre of Sector 666 – beings labelled demons – banded together to form a nation called the Empire of Tears, which opposed the Guardians’ efforts and philosophy. They used dark magic to create a galaxy-spanning realm of chaos and evil. The Guardians eventually defeated the Empire and imprisoned its leaders, the Five Inversions, on the bleak world of Ysmault. The Guardians decided that magic was chaotic and posed a threat to the balance they desired to achieve. They labored to destroy sources of magic and suppress or imprison its users throughout the Universe. They succeeded in compacting much of the chaotic magic energy of the Cosmos and imprisoning it inside a star; part of it eventually escaped to become the Starheart used by Alan Scott.

===Modern history===
The Guardians were almost wiped out in the events of &quot;Emerald Twilight&quot;, the only survivor being Ganthet. They sacrificed themselves to create one final power ring, a power ring perhaps more powerful than all others before it. Oa was itself destroyed in a battle between Parallax and Kyle Rayner, but rebuilt in the events of &quot;Legacy&quot; as the final wish of Hal Jordan&#x27;s former power ring. The Guardians have since been restored when Kyle Rayner, as Ion, recharged the Central Power Battery. Rayner lost his power and role as Ion but this sacrifice released all the Guardian&#x27;s life forces from the dormancy in his ring. The Immortals first appeared as children but aged quickly and many seem to have returned to the identities they had before they created Kyle Rayner&#x27;s power ring. Unlike before, however, the Guardians are male and female, rather than just male. While Kyle had made them children in order for them to grow up and become less cold than their predecessors, this had not worked. Instead, the Guardians were as cold and manipulative as they were before the &quot;Emerald Twilight&quot;, with the exception of Ganthet and Sayd. Also, one of them, Lianna, seemed to have reverted to the original Maltusian appearance in the process. Many of the Guardians revived by Kyle Rayner seemed to have disappeared, as only a handful now appear in the current Green Lantern issues, while dozens were revived by Kyle Rayner. Female Guardians appear in flashbacks to Hal Jordan&#x27;s rookie days as a Green Lantern. Whether this is an oversight or a result of the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; has not been explained. With their revival, they began to rebuild the Green Lantern Corps using veterans to train the new ring-bearers. Alongside this experiment, the Guardians refortified Oa by creating a planet-wide armor and defensive system to prevent successful attacks against them. The &quot;Sinestro Corps War&quot; forces them to rewrite the Book of Oa and to add ten new laws. To date, four of the ten have been revealed. They also expelled Ganthet and Sayd from their rank, because of the discovery that they were in a romantic relationship with each other. Another reason for their expulsion was their quotation from the forbidden chapter of the Book of Oa, which has Abin Sur&#x27;s discovery of the prophecy The &quot;Blackest Night&quot;.

In the aftermath of the War, both Ganthet and Sayd have evolved into two new beings on a paradise-like planet Odym, where they are harnessing the blue energy spectrum of hope and creating blue power rings and batteries, planning to create another intergalactic police force to be able to aid the Guardians and the Green Lantern Corps against the &quot;Blackest Night&quot;. The rank of the Guardians has weakened, as well; while there were originally twelve of them as Head Guardians, there are now six of them, after Ganthet and Sayd left Oa, and one Guardian died after a battle with Superman-Prime—this Guardian willfully &quot;detonated&quot; himself in an unsuccessful, last-ditch effort to destroy the insane Kryptonian (who wished to destroy the Universe in his own right). A female Guardian has been left scarred by the Anti-Monitor, and the exposure to his antimatter energy reveals to have had dire consequences. Her fellow Guardians were unaware of the changes within her, either physical or behavioral (she is far more militant than is normal for the Guardians). In the &quot;Origins and Omens&quot; backup stories running through several DC releases in February 2009, she is given the official name of Scar. Scar killed one of her fellow guardians in the beginning of the Blackest Night, and is later revealed that she has since died after the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s attack, and functions as an undead instead of an immortal. Another guardian was killed by Nekron, as a sacrifice to summon the Entity on Earth.

The Guardians seemed extremely displeased with the appearance of the other corps. While they &quot;tolerated&quot; the existence of the Star Sapphires, they made it clear that they were going to exterminate the Red Lantern Corps. They also made a deal with Larfleeze of the Orange Lantern Corps some time ago, which resulted in the Vega System being out of Green Lantern jurisdiction. However, they seem to show particular displeasure with the Blue Lantern Corps, going so far as to attempt to forcibly remove the blue ring acquired by Hal Jordan, and when that didn&#x27;t work, attempting to hold him on Oa until such time as it could be removed. With the ultimatum delivered by Larfleeze, the current wielder of the orange power of avarice, Scar proposed lifting the ban on the Vega System as well as having the Guardians leave Oa to get involved in the conflict personally.

The Guardians accepted Scar&#x27;s proposal and left Oa with Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps to confront Larfleeze in the Vega System. The Guardians also decided to see how Jordan&#x27;s blue ring would function with his green one during battles. After the Agent Orange&#x27;s defeat, the Guardians negotiated with Larfleeze once more to continue to keep the orange light of avarice contained. The Agent Orange later launched an attack on Odym, seeking to possess the powers of the Blue Lantern Corps, presumably being swayed by Scar.

During the &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, the Guardians finally realized that Ganthet and Sayd were correct in their interpretation of the prophecy discovered by Abin Sur. However, Scar killed a Guardian and bound the rest to prevent them from interfering. She later sent a number of black power rings to the Green Lantern Corps&#x27; memorial, reviving the deceased members of the Corps as undead Black Lanterns. She also weakened Oa&#x27;s planetary defenses for an attack from the Black Lantern Corps. When a group of Green Lanterns found their way into the Guardians&#x27; chamber, they found it empty, with no sign of Scar or her captives. Scar had taken her captives to the dead planet of Ryut, home of the Black Lantern&#x27;s Central Power Battery. Scar teleported herself, the Guardians, and the Black Lantern Central Power Battery to Earth, directly on top of Black Hand&#x27;s home, and Black Hand summoned Nekron to Coast City. In the midst of the battle, Nekron killed a Guardian and Black Hand used his blood and organs to raise &quot;The Trespasser&quot; from the ground, holding a white figure. Ganthet revealed the entity to be the living embodiment of life in the universe. It seemed Earth was where life first began, a fact the Guardians did their best to hide, to keep the entity safe from harm and exploitation, redirecting that danger towards themselves by informing the majority of the universe that life began on their planet of Oa (despite the fact that the Oans were in fact born on the planet Maltus).

During the &quot;War of the Green Lanterns&quot; storyline, the Guardians had been discussing the various events occurring, ranging from Hal Jordan&#x27;s allegiance with the New Guardians to the revolt of the Alpha Lanterns and so on. The group is then later confronted by Krona, who reveals his plan to control emotions. As a result, he had the Ion, the Predator, Butcher, Ophidian, Ion, Adara, and Proselyte inhabit the six Guardians as hosts and placed Parallax back within the Green Central Power Battery to subjugate the Green Lantern Corps under his control. The Guardians are freed from Krona&#x27;s emotional control by Hal Jordan, who kills Krona using his ultimate power. The rings from the other corps return to their former wielders. However, the Guardians expel them from Oa. The Guardians believe Hal to be the most dangerous of the Green Lantern Corps; therefore, the Guardians wrongfully discharge him from the Corps, much to the Green Lantern Corps&#x27; chagrin. Afterward, the Guardians of the Universe allow Sinestro to become a Green Lantern once more. However, the Green Lantern Corps learn from empathy Lantern Meadlux that the Guardians are afraid of Hal Jordan, fearing that what happened to Krona would eventually happen to them if Jordan was allowed to continue as a Green Lantern. Later, when the Green Lantern Corps are in disagreement and attempt to kill Sinestro, the Corps break into the sciencells, but the Corps discover that the Guardians have in captivity Sinestro and are trying to remove Sinestro&#x27;s green ring, but the ring will not be removed. Later, the Green Lantern Corps were in a meeting by the Guardians, where they chose to continue the fight and that any intrusion would incite a mutiny. The other Green Lantern Corps are in agreement.

====The New 52====
With Kyle Rayner having rebelled against the Guardians to join the &#x27;New Guardians&#x27;, a makeshift team consisting of representatives from all seven Corps, Hal Jordan&#x27;s recent expulsion (although he has been forced to assist Sinestro&#x27;s activities), and the &#x27;recommendations&#x27; of the now-emotionless Ganthet, the Guardians are preparing to create the &#x27;Third Army&#x27; to replace the Green Lantern Corps. This would involve them recovering the mysterious &#x27;First Lantern&#x27; for an undefined role, prompting Sinestro, who learned about this prophecy after touching the Book of the Black, to enlist Hal&#x27;s aid in stopping this scheme.

The Guardians began searching for the Book of the Black by tracking Starstorm, who was one of the last people to have had contact with the Book. When he proves useless to them, the Guardians kill Starstorm without mercy. Furthermore, it was revealed that they were the masterminds behind the release of Abysmus, one of Atrocitus&#x27; early experiments at creating life by the use of necromancy and shamanic rituals, so he could try to destroy the Red Lantern Corps by poisoning their Central Power Battery. It is also speculated that they were the masterminds behind the release of Archangel Invictus from Larfleeze&#x27;s prison and the fall of the Blue Lantern Corps during the Reach invasion in Odym. Secretly, they also were pleased with the outcome of the Alpha War which saw the death of all Alpha Lanterns as it kept their hands clean of any involvement as they intended to destroy their Green Lanterns whilst bringing about the rise of the Third Army.

To do so, the Guardians of the Universe traveled to the Chamber of Shadows, where they had sealed other Oans away for billion of years. As the Guardians open the Chamber, the imprisoned Oans believe that they were finally joining them, but the Guardians clarify that they are there for the First Lantern. The other Oans were stunned by the Guardians (who have become unemotional), telling them that keeping the First Lantern captivity was their objective. The Guardians attack the other Oans, and a Guardian kills the elder Oan named Reegal, as they take the First Lantern, Volthoom that is trapped inside, and seal the other Oans back in the Chamber of Shadows. The Guardians intervene with the Black Lantern, Black Hand, charging him up with enough power to drain Green Lanterns Hal and Sinestro, after learning and finding out that Hal Jordan is wearing a Green Power Ring and becoming a member of the Green Lantern Corps again, which apparently kills them both, as well as the discharge of Hal Jordan once again. The Guardians then use the power of the First Lantern to create the Third Army from their own flesh and will, and so the &quot;Rise of the Third Army&quot; has begun.

The Guardians begin an evil agenda, as they assign John to track down Mogo&#x27;s dead remains, due to claims that they are moving and trying to reform it. The Guardians then promote Guy Gardner as the &#x27;Sentinel Lantern&#x27; and entrust him with guarding a group of ambassadors travelling to a planet for a crucial conference, only to subsequently release Xar, Guy&#x27;s old enemy, from the Science-Cells. They presume Xar will go after Guy&#x27;s family on Earth, knowing that Guy will abandon his duty and return to Earth while Xar attacks the ambassadors. The Guardians&#x27; plans have changed after Guy breaks off the attack from the Third Army and survives; the Guardians then frame Guy for failing his duty to protect the ambassadors, who were killed and expel him from the Green Lantern Corps. Suspicious about the Guardians&#x27; agenda, Salaak&#x27;s began spying on them and discover they had already spread the Third Army across the universe, but the Guardians caught him before he can reveal this information, and imprison Salaak in the Citadel. The Guardians watches the Third Army spread over the universe, destroying all life and free will. They have told the First Lantern that once the Third Army completes their control over the whole universe, there will be no need for him. Later, the Guardians realize they cannot completely control the universe and need more members of the Third Army. They use more of the power of the First Lantern, without realizing that the First Lantern&#x27;s prison is breaking.

The Guardians fool the Green Lanterns into a meeting to paralyse them, so they can reveal the reason behind their plan to replace the Green Lantern Corps with the Third Army. However, they are thwarted by Guy&#x27;s diversion after he survives his fate at the hands of the Third Army and discovers their involvement with the Third Army. Kilowog then used his oath to cause the Central Power Battery to depower so that he could send distress calls to all the Green Lanterns and warn that the Guardians have turned against their own Corps. The Green Lantern Corps, including Guy Gardner (who rejoined them after finding out their plans), join the New Guardians and Atrocitus&#x27; Manhunters that arrive to rebel against the treacherous Guardians. When they are able to destroy the Third Army, Volthoom breaks free by taking the wounded Guardians&#x27; energy power and igniting the light, apparently resulting in the destruction of the universe.

The Guardians then wake up imprisoned on the planet Maltus by Volthoom, who restores Ganthet&#x27;s emotions. It is revealed that when Krona tried to observe the beginnings of the universe, his experiment allowed a vessel to emerge on Oa where inside was a figure in a spacesuit with a bright lantern battery. Calling himself Volthoom, this being had traveled across time and space and it was him who apparently tutored the Maltusians about the power of the Emotional Spectrum and at some point was given the name of The First Lantern. However, during one of Krona&#x27;s experiments involving the Great Heart, he witnessed the creation of The First Ring, which he attempted to claim for himself, only to be infused with the combined emotional awareness of the Maltusians themselves. He was deemed dangerous and unstable by the nascent Guardians of the Universe who were threatened by his great power. Thus, it was ultimately decided to imprison him within The Chamber of Shadows, a lantern shaped construct built near a black hole, where he was trapped inside for untold millennia. A number of Oans remained behind to ensure that The First Lantern was kept imprisoned and became known as The Hidden Ones, while those that remained embarked on their mission of policing the universe with the Manhunters. The First Lantern&#x27;s custodians and wardens vowed that he would never be released, due to the dangers he posed. According to Krona, the Guardians were responsible for betraying the First Lantern. His only legacy on Oa was within The Foundry in the area that stored the Power Gauntlet, where an inscription mentions The First Lantern. Volthoom intends to feed off the other Lanterns&#x27; emotions to fuel his own emotional powers. When Volthoom is slain by Nekron, while Hal Jordan is now a member of the Green Lantern Corps, the Guardians are freed, but are then executed by Sinestro for the destruction of Korugar, although he spared one Guardian to Atrocitus. Sinestro spares Ganthet and reunites him with Sayd, but exiles them from Oa. The Malthusians who guarded Volthoom become the new &quot;Templar Guardians&quot;. Because they are so out of touch with the current state of the universe, the Templar Guardians appoint Hal as a temporary leader of the Corps while they set out on a voyage of learning.

====DC Rebirth====
Subsequently, in DC Rebirth, while the Green Lantern Corps returned, Ganthet, Sayd, and the Templar Guardians were attacked and abducted by the Controllers. They wanted to harvest Templar Guardians&#x27; power to empower the Controllers. Four Green Lanterns of the Earth, however, were able to locate the Controllers&#x27; base at sector 3001 and attacked. After the Controllers were defeated and escaped, Ganthet announces that the Templar Guardians will return as the new Guardians of the Universe and will be their legacy.

The last surviving Guardians then assist the Corps through several incidents involving Zod and the return of the Darkstars. It is during this time the new guardian council delay and second-guess their orders, not wanting to become like their predecessors. However, during The Cyborg Superman&#x27;s infiltration of the Corps technology and the central power battery, guardian Kada Dal is murdered. Although the Cyborg Superman&#x27;s plan is stopped by Hal Jordan, it will take some time to purge his influence from the Corps. With Mogo recovering the guardians decide to move the Corps to a New Oa.

Now there are only 5 surviving Guardians: Ganthet, last of the original Guardians, Sayd, last of the reborn Guardians, Rami the renegade guardian, Zalla, and Paalko, last of the Templar guardians.

However, as time passes, they too decide to depart from the main universe to participate in something they refer to as the &quot;Ultrawar&quot;. They upgrade Hal&#x27;s Green Lantern Power Battery and task him to venture to the Guardians&#x27; homeworld of Maltus and recruit new, younger Guardians to oversee the Corps. Partnered with the sentient salt Lantern Ryk, Hal is able to accomplish his daring, ambitious assignment but the new Guardians may be more than he bargained for. Visibly younger than their predecessors, as per the Guardians&#x27; instructions, the new Guardians are vocally unimpressed with the current way the Green Lantern Corps is being run. Frustrated by the antiquated practices and traditions in place, the new Guardians vow to change things as they settle into their roles overseeing the universe&#x27;s premier peacekeeping force—with the Guardians&#x27; omnipotent power at their disposal.

==Powers and abilities==
Functionally immortal, Guardians resemble short (approximately 4 feet [120 cm] tall), large-headed, white-haired pale blue humans wearing red robes with their emblem, the Green Lantern symbol, on the chest. They possess vast knowledge, durability, awareness, flight, and psionic powers manifested through green plasma energy drawn from the most stable color of the emotional spectrum, green (willpower). Although, since it has been said that they chose the most stable color of the spectrum, it is possible that the Guardians may have limited access to all colors. In &quot;Green Lantern: Rebirth&quot;, Kyle Rayner is recorded saying that Ganthet could crack a planet in half with a thought and have been shown able to stagger Superman-Prime and the Anti-Monitor. The Guardians display the power of time travel as they send a time-lost Kyle Rayner back to his present timeline.

==Appearance==
The Guardians usually appear as diminutive, blue-skinned humanoids wearing red robes and white tabards bearing their crest, the Green Lantern symbol. The appearance of the male Guardians is modeled after former Prime Minister of Israel David Ben-Gurion.

After their rebirth, the females are typically bald and have female characteristics, such as breasts, more noticeable eyelashes and lips, and tend to be less wrinkled and aged looking. Their male counterparts tend to have short, unkempt, white hair, and to be more wrinkled and aged looking. One long going inconsistency between artists has been the relative size of the Guardians&#x27; heads to their short bodies, most artists designing them with larger heads to suggest their larger brains and alien anatomy, whereas others have been shown to draw near enough human-like proportional heads. Another difference has been their ears, which have been seen to be human-like, and on other occasions, to be elf-like. Their eye color also frequently changes between artists, usually between blue and green.

The Guardians&#x27; attire originally featured a long red robe with a stylized, Dracula-like collar, and their symbol emblazoned on the chest. Following their rebirth, this changed to them wearing a long red robe with a more scholarly collar, and a white tabard with their emblem on the chest area. They have also been shown by some artists to wear white undershirts, the sleeves of which can be seen sometimes under the robe&#x27;s sleeves. Though their feet are not usually seen beneath their robes, they have been shown to wear red, pointed shoes.

==Guardians known by name==
It has been said that &quot;Guardians do not take names&quot;, yet when Krona invaded Oa in the &quot;War of the Green Lanterns&quot; story-arc, he revealed that all Oans have names but have since forgotten them. Nonetheless, a few of their lot have been named in the stories. It was eventually revealed that the reason for the Guardians having forgotten their names was because they had removed their own emotions to defeat Volthoom. Among them:

* Appa Ali Apsa – A Guardian who was chosen to experience life on Earth. He later renounces his Guardian title, powers and immortality, and chooses to travel the universe. Later, after &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Apsa loses his mind and is killed by his former brethren. In post-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; continuity, Apsa is a member of the Circle, a group of powerful beings that also includes Sardath, King Myand&#x27;r of Tamaran, and Lord Gandelo.
* Broome Bon Barris
* Basilus
* Dawlakispokpok
* Dennap
* Ganthet – A leading Guardian and founding member of the Blue Lantern Corps.
* Herupa Hando Hu – His name is revealed by Krona.
* Lianna – A second-generation Guardian who was altered by Heartstone and raised by a Zamaron.
* Kontross
* Krona – A renegade Guardian and prominent enemy of the Green Lantern Corps.
*Pazu Pinder Pol
* Sayd – A leading Guardian and founding member of the Blue Lantern Corps.
* Scar – A Guardian who was scarred in battle with the Anti-Monitor. Scar later becomes dark, militaristic, and fascinated by the power of death. During &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Scar gives Black Hand a black power ring, enabling him to found the Black Lantern Corps.
* Valorex
* Pale Bishop – A former Guardian of the Universe who turned his back on his kind when they started to use the Emotional Spectrum and instead founded The Paling, anti-emotion religious monks called Pale Vicars who turn people into emotionless followers. He is later killed by Sinestro.
* Rami – Apparently the creator of the power rings, in his first attempt, he created a ring that can channel any light and can be used by any bearer which was later nicknamed as the &quot;Phantom Ring&quot;, however because this ring was not without flaws, he later created other power rings that can only channel the green light of the Emotional Spectrum. The other Guardians of the Universe were later forced to excommunicate him over his creation of the &quot;Phantom Ring&quot;. He was recently accepted back into the Templar Guardians.
* Gurion – A Templar Guardian. Considered deceased by his brethren after his DNA was forcefully harvested by the Controllers who changed him into one of them.
* Paalko – A Templar Guardian
* Reegal – A Templar Guardian. He was killed when the Guardians travelled to the Chamber of Shadows where they met Reegal who asked his kin whether they had saved the universe. However, the Guardians claimed that circumstances had changed and that they required the First Lantern. This went against the oath that the Hidden Ones had taken as they were well aware of the danger posed by the First Lantern if he was freed. Thus, they attacked the Guardians as they intended to honor their oath. During the battle, Reegal&#x27;s throat was slit by one of the Guardians and the Hidden Ones were shocked as a result which allowed the Oans to take the First Lantern from the Chamber. When Black Hand was teleported into the Chamber of Shadows, he discovered Reegal&#x27;s body in the outer corridor of the chamber. The Black Lantern resurrected Reegal as an undead being so he could interrogate him about the location of the prison.
* Quaros – A Templar Guardian. Instead of assisting Kyle Rayner and his kin after Relic&#x27;s defeat, he felt compelled to journey through the universe and discover its secrets. Of the Templar Guardians, he is said to have the most insight into the workings of the cosmos. He died in Green Lantern - New Guardians issue 34.
* Yekop – A Templar Guardian. Considered deceased by his brethren after his DNA was forcefully harvested by the Controllers who changed him into one of them.
* Zalla – A Templar Guardian.
* Kada Sal – A Templar Guardian. He was killed in Green Lanterns # 50.
* Natos – A Templar Guardian. Considered deceased by his brethren after his DNA was forcefully harvested by the Controllers who changed him into one of them.
* Nemosyni - A female Guardian of the Universe who gave Jo her power ring. Sister of Koyos. She along with her brother betrayed the Corps resulting in nearly all of the Lanterns having been killed or their rings losing all power.
* Koyos - A male Guardian of the Universe and brother of Nemosyni. He went rogue and became the Anti-Guardian after betraying the Corps and destroyed the Green Lantern Central Power Battery on Oa. He later became the only Maltusian alive in the entire Universe, after targeting the planets Zamaron, Helix and Odym and killing everything that was from Maltusian lineage. Koyos was eventually defeated and killed by John Stewart.

=== Unofficial Guardians ===
* Master Builder – John Stewart, the only mortal Guardian of the Universe
* Sinestro – During &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Sinestro briefly bonds with the Life Entity and claims the title of Guardian of the Universe.
* Sodam Yat – The last Guardian of the Universe in the 30th Century.

==Artifacts and structures==
During the height of their species civilization on their homeworld of Maltus and after being tutored about the emotional spectrum energy, the Guardians of the Universe created an unknown number of artifacts before finally creating the power rings that were given to the Green Lantern Corps. The known artifact are as follows:

* Power Gauntlet – A device created by Krona that serves as a prototype to the Green Lantern rings.
* Power Rings – Rings powered by willpower that harness Green Lantern energy to create energy constructs.
* The Great Heart – A device located beneath Maltus&#x27; surface that holds the Guardians&#x27; emotions.
* Green Lantern Power Battery – A reservoir of Green Lantern energy and the source of power for all Green Lanterns.
* A&#x27;Tmatentrym - A creature that can resist every weapon used against it and can only be defeated by those who refuse to fight it.
* Power Battery – An energy conduit of the Central Power Battery that enables Green Lanterns to charge their rings.
* Manhunters – Robotic androids that served as a prototypical version of the Green Lantern Corps.
* Energy Pistols – Weapons that were crafted by the Manhunters to serve as their primary weapons and charged by Power Batteries that were linked to the Central Power Battery on Oa. 
* Starheart – An orb that was created after the Guardians of the Universe attempted to remove magic from the universe, and laid siege to the necromantic forces of the cosmos. It is the source of power for Alan Scott.
* Emerald Eye of Ekron – A construct created between the Manhunters and the power rings.
* The Foundry – A subterranean chamber complex on the planet Oa which was crafted with advanced technology as a means of creating Power Rings and Power Batteries. This chamber contains a large number of secret projects that the Guardians had created in their long existence. These included holding tanks that contained the Psions, manufacturing plants for Manhunters and conversion platforms for Alpha Lanterns.
* The Chamber of Shadows – Located in a black hole, this cube shaped stony structure was built early in the Guardians&#x27; history when they decided to bring order to a chaotic cosmos. During this time, great power was imparted onto a being that they called the First Lantern but they were ultimately forced to imprison this being. According to Krona, the Guardians betrayed the First Lantern and locked him within a Lantern shaped device which in turn was placed within the Chamber of Shadows which became a prison with numerous chains encompassing it.
* The Vault of Shadows – A hidden mausoleum built early in the Guardians&#x27; history after the imprisonment of the First Lantern. It is located in space sector 180 at the edge of the known Universe and it is considered a sister structure to the Chamber of Shadows. It is where the Guardians keep all their forbidden knowledge and also where the first seven Green Lantern&#x27;s bodies are located.
* The eye of Krona - A piece of glass made of Source material which can be used to read hidden writings of the Book of Oa. Doing so reveals how to make a Central Power Battery as well as the existence of six other books corresponding to the aspects of the emotional spectrum.

==Other versions==

===JLA: The Nail===
In the alternate reality of &quot;&quot; (where Superman was discovered by a different family after the Kents had a nail in their car tire on the day they would have recovered him), the Guardians recalled the entire Green Lantern Corps minus Hal Jordan (who was trapped on Earth by a Kryptonian force field) to intervene when the cold war between Apokolips and New Genesis escalated.

===Superman &amp; Batman: Generations===
In the reality of &quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations&quot;, the Guardians revealed that Alan Scott&#x27;s power ring was actually a Green Lantern ring despite its apparent weakness to wood after Hal Jordan successfully harnessed it against Sinestro, realising that the ring actually had no weaknesses except what the user believed it possessed; the Green Lantern Corps were vulnerable to yellow only because they believed the Guardians when they were told about this weakness, and Alan&#x27;s ring&#x27;s weakness to wood was caused when he was taken by surprise and struck on the back of the head with a wooden block during his first time using the ring.

===Flashpoint===
In the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; reality, the Guardians of the Universe assigned Abin Sur to head to Earth and find the White Lantern Entity. The Guardians contact him once again to retrieve the Entity which Abin Sur refuses stating that he will retrieve the Entity after he helps the Earth population against the Atlantis/Amazon war. The Guardians grow impatient with Abin Sur, discharging from the Corps. However, the White Lantern Entity chose Abin Sur to be its champion.

===Injustice: Gods Among Us===
In &quot;&quot; of the prequel comic to the game, Ganthet convinces the Guardians that Superman&#x27;s recent actions on Earth to force peace border on tyranny, and suggests they intervene before it goes too far. Ganthet and Guy Gardner go to Earth to confront Superman, who maintains his actions are for the Earth&#x27;s best interests. It is made impossible to reason with the fallen Man of Steel as he had discovered a truth behind the Guardians: years before they chose not to do anything as the planet Krypton exploded, allowing most of a race to be wiped out. Though Ganthet argues this is because they do not use their power to solve every problem, Superman rejects him and the Guardians, leading to an all-out war between the Green Lantern Corps and Superman&#x27;s Regime (which also includes Sinestro Corps). Ganthet is later killed alongside numerous Green Lanterns, forcing the Guardians to leave Earth alone.

===Earth One===
In &quot;Green Lantern: Earth One&quot;, the Guardians founded the Green Lantern Corps as a galactic peacekeeping force thousands of years ago. However, feeling that the Green Lanterns had become too wilful and independent, they created the robotic Manhunters as a replacement. The Manhunters decimated the Corps as planned, but then turned on the Guardians, apparently killing all but one. The last Guardian fled to an alternate dimension, and began work on a third force to replace the Manhunters. Hundreds of years later, pseudo-Lantern Hal Jordan rediscovered the lost Central Power Battery on Oa, now a mining planet at the heart of the Manhunter&#x27;s empire. The Guardian contacted Jordan through the Battery and, after telling a slightly distorted version of the history of the Guardians, Corps and Manhunters, instructed him to summon the last remaining ringbearers to Oa and create a feedback loop between their power rings and the Battery, thereby destroying the Lanterns and the Manhunters, allowing the Guardian to return with all threats to his power removed. However, one of the ringbearers was a physicist who was able to devise a way to control the feedback loop. Therefore, the Lanterns survived the explosion and came together as a united force again, much to the Guardian&#x27;s annoyance. At the end, the Guardian - feeling fear is more effective than willpower - establishes the Yellow Lantern Corps.

===All Star Batman: Metal===
In Earth -32 of the Dark Multiverse, the Dawnbreaker Batman massacred most of the Corps, and all of the Guardians were left as skeletons, except one, presumably Ganthet, who the Dawnbreaker killed by ripping off his head.

===Earth Three===

The Overlords of Oa are the Earth-3 Guardians. They command the Emerald Knights who are their version of the Green Lantern corps. The Emerald Knights are given power ring&#x27;s with a sentient entity called Volthoom within them, the power rings subjugate the Emerald Knights by convincing the knight to trust the ring and fully devote themselves to the Oans above all else. The Emerald Knights conquer planets for the Oans.

<text>Darn Floor - Big Bite is the eighth studio album by Christian alternative rock band Daniel Amos, issued on Frontline Records in 1987. It is their first album following the completion of their &quot;¡Alarma! Chronicles&quot; album cycle, and was issued under their shortened moniker Da.

Daniel Amos followed the &quot;¡Alarma! Chronicles&quot; four-part album series with this release, the title of which came from an incident involving Koko the gorilla, who had been trained to understand limited amounts of American Sign Language.

<text>Tunis–Carthage International Airport, (, , ) is the international airport of Tunis, the capital of Tunisia. It serves as the home base for Tunisair, Tunisair Express, Nouvelair Tunisia, and Tunisavia. The airport is named for the historic city of Carthage, located just east of the airport.

==History==

The history of the airport dates back to 1920 when the first seaplane base in Tunisia was built on the Lake of Tunis for the seaplanes of Compagnie Aéronavale. The Tunis Airfield opened in 1938, serving around 5,800 passengers annually on the Paris-Tunis route.

During World War II, the airport was used by the United States Air Force Twelfth Air Force as a headquarters and command control base for the Italian Campaign of 1943. The following known units were assigned:

* HQ, 87th Fighter Group, 22 November – 14 December 1943
* 3d Reconnaissance Group, 13 June – 8 December 1943, Lockheed F-4/F-5 Lightning
* 5th Reconnaissance Group, 8 September – 8 December 1943, Lockheed F-4/F-5 Lightning

Once the combat units moved to Italy, Air Transport Command used the airport as a major transshipment hub for cargo, transiting aircraft and personnel. It functioned as a stopover en route to Algiers airport or to Mellaha Field near Tripoli, Libya on the North African Cairo-Dakar transport route. Later, as the Allied forces advanced, it also flew personnel and cargo to Naples, Italy.

Construction on the Tunis-Carthage Airport, which was fully funded by France, began in 1944, and in 1948 the airport become the main hub for Tunisair. The airline started operations with Douglas DC-3s flying from Tunis-Carthage Airport to Marseille, Ajaccio, Bastia, Algiers, Rome, Sfax, Djerba, and Tripoli, Libya. The passenger traffic grew steadily from 1951 when 56,400 passengers were carried, 33,400 of them by Air France. The airport offered a convenient stop-over point for several other French airlines over the years, including Aigle Azur with a stop in Tunis on the Paris-Brazzaville route, and TAI (Intercontinental Air Transport) with a stop in Tunis on its Paris-Saigon route. Among foreign companies, the TWA was present, whose lines Rome-New York and Rome-Bombay made stop in Tunis, and the LAI (Italian company) which made the connection Rome-Palermo-Tunis.

In 1997, the airport terminal was expanded to ; it consists of two floors (departure and arrival) and has a capacity of 4,400,000 passengers per year. In 2005, the terminal was expanded another , and now has a capacity of 500,000 more passengers annually. On 23 September 2006 a new terminal opened for charter flights. Syphax Airlines commenced a direct flight to Montreal in April 2014.

<text>Conspiracy Theory is a 1997 American political action thriller film directed by Richard Donner. Starring Mel Gibson, Julia Roberts and Patrick Stewart, the original screenplay by Brian Helgeland centers on an eccentric taxi driver who believes many world events are triggered by government conspiracies, and the Justice Department attorney who becomes involved in his life. The film grossed $137 million, and critical reviews were mixed.

==Plot==
New York City taxi driver Jerry Fletcher is a passionate conspiracy theorist, happily sharing his ideas with anyone who will listen. His favorite audience is Justice Department lawyer Alice Sutton, who tolerates him because he once saved her from a mugging but is unaware he spies on her at home. She is haunted by the murder of her father, a judge, which her boss Mr. Wilson believes was ordered by an inmate her father denied an appeal.

One day, Jerry notices some men he surmises to be CIA agents, who lure him into a trap. They bring him to a man who, claiming to know Jerry well, injects him with LSD and demands to know who he has been talking to &quot;about us.&quot; Experiencing terrifying hallucinations and flashbacks, Jerry manages to escape after biting the interrogator&#x27;s nose, but is injured when the wheelchair he is taped to falls down a flight of stairs and a metal rod pierces his abdomen. Accosting Alice in the Justice Department lobby, a frantic, bloodied Jerry grabs a security guard&#x27;s gun and is arrested.

Taken to the hospital, Jerry is handcuffed to a bed and drugged. Before losing consciousness, he begs Alice to switch his chart with the criminal in the next bed, claiming he will be dead by morning otherwise. When Alice returns the next day, the criminal has died from an alleged heart attack and the police, along with the FBI and the CIA, arrive to ID the body, believing it to be Jerry&#x27;s. The CIA is led by a psychiatrist named Dr. Jonas, whose nose is bandaged. Jerry fakes a heart attack and, with a reluctant Alice&#x27;s help, escapes again. Alice and FBI Agent Lowry examine Jerry&#x27;s belongings before the CIA confiscates them. She returns to her car to find Jerry hiding in the back seat. While driving, Jerry explains someone is likely following her. Alice waves the suspicious car on to discover it is Lowry; she convinces him to leave her alone until she has more information to offer. 

At Jerry&#x27;s apartment, he suspects that something in the conspiracy newsletter he produces has set off this sudden interest in him, but has no idea what it is. Alice, meanwhile, begins to grasp the depths of Jerry&#x27;s paranoia and loneliness, including his compulsion to buy copies of &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; despite never reading it. Just as she&#x27;s decided he is crazy, a SWAT team starts to break in. Jerry activates devices that incinerate the apartment and they leave through a hidden trapdoor. In the room below, Alice is startled by a mural of her riding a horse - something she gave up after her father&#x27;s murder - and the triple smokestacks of the Ravenswood Generating Station. Jerry disguises himself as a firefighter and carries Alice past emergency services and an arriving Jonas. They go to her apartment, where Jerry inadvertently reveals he has been watching Alice and is kicked out. Down on the street, Jerry notices Lowry and his partner staking out the apartment and warns them off at gunpoint. After a compulsive purchase at a bookstore is flagged by the CIA, Jerry flees from agents into a theater and escapes by faking a bomb threat.

Alice is told by Mr. Wilson that the Justice Department must cooperate with Dr. Jonas to locate Jerry. Suspicious, she calls each person on Jerry&#x27;s mailing list and finds that all but one, Harry Finch, have recently died. Jerry disables the CIA&#x27;s van and uses a ruse to get Alice out of the office. While escaping through a subway station, he tells her that he fell in love with her at first sight, fleeing on a subway train when she brushes off his feelings. 

Alice goes to see Harry Finch, who turns out to be Jonas. He explains that he helped develop the MKUltra program, unofficially continuing it after being shut down in 1973. His brainwashing techniques, which he used to turn people like Jerry into assassins, were stolen by an unknown party, who he needs Jerry to identify. He also claims that Jerry killed Alice&#x27;s father. She agrees to help find Jerry, who sends her a message to meet him. Ditching the agents by causing a traffic jam on the Queensboro Bridge and switching cars, he drives her to her father&#x27;s private horse stables in Connecticut. Along the way, Alice secretly calls her office so Jonas and Wilson can track her phone. At the stables, Jerry remembers that he was programmed to kill her father but the sight of Alice dissuaded him. Instead, he became friends with the judge, remembering the inmate who was denied the appeal was actually innocent, and promised to watch over Alice after her father was mortally wounded by another assassin. Jonas&#x27; men arrive, capturing Jerry and killing Wilson, but Alice manages to escape.

Alice brings Lowry to the offices where she met Jonas, which they find cleared out. She forces him at gunpoint to admit that he is not actually FBI, but from a &quot;secret agency that watches the other agencies&quot;. They have been using the unwitting Jerry to flush out Jonas and find out who he has been building assassins for. Alice goes to Ravenswood and sees a mental hospital next door. She breaks in and finds Jerry just as groups led by Jonas and Lowry arrive, setting off a gun battle. Jerry attempts to drown Jonas, who pulls an ankle gun and shoots Jerry before being killed by Alice. She tells Jerry she loves him before he is taken away in an ambulance. Some time later, a grieving Alice visits Jerry&#x27;s grave and leaves a pin that he had given her. She takes up horse riding again. Observing Alice from a car with Lowry, Jerry - whose death and burial had been faked by the secret agency - reaffirms his agreement not to contact her until the rest of Jonas&#x27;s subjects are caught. As they drive away singing &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You&quot;, Alice finds the pin attached to her saddle, and smiles.

Among the numerous conspiracy theories mentioned by Jerry include Rockefeller Center, fluoridation, the United Nations, the JFK assassination, Watergate funder Armand Hammer, the &quot;New World Order&quot;, Freemasons, the CIA, the Vatican, microchipping of pets, Moon landings, Pearl Harbor, and silent &quot;Black Helicopters&quot;.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; was released August 8, 1997, to 2,806 theaters, and had an opening weekend gross of $19.3 million in the United States. It opened at number 1 in the U.S., displacing &quot;Air Force One&quot;. It eventually grossed $76 million in the U.S. and $61 million internationally.

===Critical response===
Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 57% based on reviews from 44 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

In her review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin said, &quot;The only sneaky scheme at work here is the one that inflates a hollow plot to fill 2¼ hours while banishing skepticism with endless close-ups of big, beautiful movie-star eyes ... Gibson, delivering one of the hearty, dynamic star turns that have made him the Peter Pan of the blockbuster set, makes Jerry much more boyishly likable than he deserves to be. The man who talks to himself and mails long, delusional screeds to strangers is not usually the dreamboat type ... After the story enjoys creating real intrigue ... it becomes tied up in knots. As with too many high-concept escapades, &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; tacks on a final half-hour of hasty explanations and mock-sincere emotion. The last scene is an outright insult to anyone who took the movie seriously at its start.&quot;

Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; graded the film B− and commented, &quot;Richard Donner ... switches the movie from a really interesting, jittery, literate, and witty tone poem about justified contemporary paranoia (and the creatively unhinged dark side of New York City) to an overloaded, meandering iteration of a &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; project that bears the not-so-secret stamp of audience testing and tinkering.&quot;

In the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Mick LaSalle stated, &quot;If I were paranoid I might suspect a conspiracy at work in the promoting of this movie—to suck in audiences with a catchy hook and then give them something much more clumsy and pedestrian ... &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; can be enjoyed once one gives up hope of its becoming a thinking person&#x27;s thriller and accepts it as just another diversion ... When all else fails, there are still the stars to look at—Roberts, who actually manages to do some fine acting, and Gibson, whose likability must be a sturdy thing indeed.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; observed the film &quot;cries out to be a small film—a quixotic little indie production where the daffy dialogue and weird characters could weave their coils of paranoia into great offbeat humor. Unfortunately, the parts of the movie that are truly good are buried beneath the deadening layers of thriller cliches and an unconvincing love story ... If the movie had stayed at ground level—had been a real story about real people—it might have been a lot better, and funnier. All of the energy is in the basic material, and none of it is in a romance that is grafted on like an unneeded limb or superfluous organ.&quot;

In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Peter Travers said, &quot;The strong impact that Gibson makes as damaged goods is diluted by selling Jerry as cute and redeemable. Instead of a scalding brew of mirth and malice, served black, Donner settles up a tepid latte, decaf. What a shame—&quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; could have been a contender.&quot;

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a sporadically amusing but listless thriller that wears its humorous, romantic and political components like mismatched articles of clothing ... This is a film in which all things ... are treated lightly, even glibly ... One can readily sympathize with ... the director&#x27;s desire to inject the picture with as much humor as possible. But he tries to have it every which way in the end, and the conflicting moods and intentions never mesh comfortably.&quot;

Pauline Kael in an interview said &quot;the first half of &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; was terrific, then it went to hell&quot; but that Mel Gibson was &quot;stunningly good.&quot;
In his 2003 book &quot;A Culture of Conspiracy&quot;, political scientist Michael Barkun notes that a vast popular audience has been introduced by the film to the notion that the U.S. government is controlled by a deep state whose secret agents use black helicopters — a view once confined to the radical right.

<doc id="144163" wikidata="Q1817" url="?curid=144163" title="Philip the Arab">
<text>Philip I (; – September 249), commonly known as Philip the Arab, was the Emperor of the Roman Empire from 244 to 249. After the death of Gordian III in February 244, Philip, who had been Praetorian prefect, rose to power. He quickly negotiated peace with the Sasanian Empire and returned to Rome to be confirmed by the Senate.

Although his reign lasted only five years, it marks an unusually stable period in a century that is otherwise known for having been turbulent. Near the end of his rule, Philip commemorated Rome&#x27;s first millennium. In September 249 he was killed during or shortly after the Battle of Verona against the usurper Trajan Decius, who was subsequently recognized by the Senate as his successor.

Born in modern-day Shahba, Syria, in what was then Arabia Petraea, Philip&#x27;s ethnicity was most likely Arab. While he publicly adhered to the Roman religion, he was later asserted to have been a Christian, and in the later half of the 3rd century and into the beginning of the 4th century, some Christian clergymen held that Philip had been the first Christian ruler of Rome. He was described as such in many published works that became widely known during the Middle Ages, including: &quot;Chronicon&quot; (); &quot;Historiae Adversus Paganos&quot; (); and &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; (). Consequently, Philip&#x27;s religious affiliation remains a divisive topic in modern scholarly debate about his life.

==Early life==
Little is known about Philip&#x27;s early life and political career. He was born in what is today Shahba, Syria, about southeast of Damascus, in Trachonitis. His birth city, later renamed Philippopolis, lay within Aurantis, an Arab district which at the time was part of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea. Most historians accept that Philip was, indeed, an ethnic Arab. He was the son of a local citizen, Julius Marinus, possibly of some importance. Allegations from later Roman sources (&quot;Historia Augusta&quot; and &quot;Epitome de Caesaribus&quot;) that Philip had a very humble origin or even that his father was a leader of brigands are not accepted by modern historians. His birth date is not recorded by contemporary sources, but the 7th-century &quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot; records that he died at the age of 45.

While the name of Philip&#x27;s mother is unknown, he did have a brother, Gaius Julius Priscus, an equestrian and a member of the Praetorian Guard under Gordian III (238–244). Philip was married to Marcia Otacilia Severa, daughter of a Roman governor. They had a son, Philip II, born in 237 or 238.

The rise to the purple of the Severans from nearby Emesa is noted as a motivational factor in Philip&#x27;s own ascent, due to geographic and ethnic similarity between himself and the Emesan emperors.

==Accession to the throne==
Philip&#x27;s rise to prominence began through the intervention of his brother Priscus, who was an important official under the emperor Gordian III. His big break came in 243, during Gordian III&#x27;s campaign against Shapur I of Persia, when the Praetorian prefect Timesitheus died under unclear circumstances. At the suggestion of his brother Priscus, Philip became the new Praetorian prefect, with the intention that the two brothers would control the young Emperor and rule the Roman world as unofficial regents. Following a military defeat, Gordian III died in February 244 under circumstances that are still debated. While some claim that Philip conspired in his murder, other accounts (including one coming from the Persian point of view) state that Gordian died in battle. Whatever the case, Philip assumed the purple robe following Gordian&#x27;s death.

Philip was not willing to repeat the mistakes of previous claimants, and was aware that he had to return to Rome in order to secure his position with the Senate. However, his first priority was to conclude a peace treaty with Shapur, and withdraw the army from a potentially disastrous situation. Although Philip was accused of abandoning territory, the actual terms of the peace were not as humiliating as they could have been. Philip apparently retained Timesitheus’ reconquest of Osroene and Mesopotamia, but he had to agree that Armenia lay within Persia&#x27;s sphere of influence. He also had to pay an enormous indemnity to the Persians of 500,000 denarii. Philip immediately issued coins proclaiming that he had made peace with the Persians (&quot;pax fundata cum Persis&quot;).

Leading his army back up the Euphrates, south of Circesium Philip erected a cenotaph in honor of Gordian III, but his ashes were sent ahead to Rome, where he arranged for Gordian III&#x27;s deification. Whilst in Antioch, he left his brother Priscus as extraordinary ruler of the Eastern provinces, with the title of &quot;rector Orientis&quot;. Moving westward, he gave his brother-in-law Severianus control of the provinces of Moesia and Macedonia. He arrived in Rome in the late summer of 244, where he was confirmed &quot;augustus&quot;. Before the end of the year, he nominated his young son &quot;caesar&quot; (heir), his wife, Marcia Otacilia Severa, was named &quot;augusta&quot;, and he also deified his father Marinus, even though the latter had never been emperor. While in Rome, Philip also claimed a victory over the Persians with the titles of &quot;Persicus Maximus&quot;, &quot;Parthicus Maximus&quot; and &quot;Parthicus Adiabenicus&quot; (the latter probably unofficially).

==Reign==
In an attempt to shore up his regime, Philip put a great deal of effort in maintaining good relations with the Senate, and from the beginning of his reign, he reaffirmed the old Roman virtues and traditions. He quickly ordered an enormous building program in his home town, renaming it Philippopolis, and raising it to civic status, while he populated it with statues of himself and his family. He also introduced the Actia-Dusaria Games in Bostra, capital of Arabia. This festival combined the worship of Dushara, the main Nabataean deity, with commemoration of the Battle of Actium, as part of the Roman Imperial cult.

The creation of the new city of Philippopolis, piled on top of the massive tribute owed to the Persians, as well as the necessary &quot;donativum&quot; to the army to secure its acceptance of his accession, made Philip desperately short of money. To pay for it, he ruthlessly increased levels of taxation, while at the same time he ceased paying subsidies to the tribes north of the Danube that were vital for keeping the peace on the frontiers. Both decisions would have significant impacts upon the empire and his reign.

===At the frontiers of the Roman Empire===
In 245, Philip was forced to leave Rome as the stability established by Timesitheus was undone by a combination of his death, Gordian&#x27;s defeat in the east and Philip&#x27;s decision to cease paying the subsidies. The Carpi moved through Dacia, crossed the Danube and emerged in Moesia where they threatened the Balkans. Establishing his headquarters in Philippopolis in Thrace, he pushed the Carpi across the Danube and chased them back into Dacia, so that by the summer of 246, he claimed victory against them, along with the title &quot;Carpicus Maximus&quot;. In the meantime, the Arsacids of Armenia refused to acknowledge the authority of the Persian king Shapur I, and war with Persia flared up again by 245.

=== &quot;Ludi Saeculares&quot; ===

Nevertheless, Philip was back in Rome by August 247, where he poured more money into the most momentous event of his reign – the Ludi Saeculares, which coincided with the one thousandth anniversary of the foundation of Rome. So in April 248 AD (April 1001 A.U.C.), Philip had the honor of leading the celebrations of the one thousandth birthday of Rome, which according to the empire&#x27;s official Varronian chronology was founded on 21 April 753 BC by Romulus.

Commemorative coins, such as the one illustrated at left, were issued in large numbers and, according to contemporary accounts, the festivities were magnificent and included spectacular games, ludi saeculares, and theatrical presentations throughout the city. In the Colosseum, in what had been originally prepared for Gordian III&#x27;s planned Roman triumph over the Persians, more than 1,000 gladiators were killed along with hundreds of exotic animals including hippos, leopards, lions, giraffes, and one rhinoceros. The events were also celebrated in literature, with several publications, including Asinius Quadratus&#x27; &quot;History of a Thousand Years&quot;, specially prepared for the anniversary. At the same time, Philip elevated his son to the rank of co-&quot;augustus&quot;.

==Downfall==
Despite the festive atmosphere, there were continued problems in the provinces. In late 248, the legions of Pannonia and Moesia, dissatisfied with the result of the war against the Carpi, rebelled and proclaimed Tiberius Claudius Pacatianus emperor. The resulting confusion tempted the Quadi and other Germanic tribes to cross the frontier and raid Pannonia. At the same time, the Goths invaded Moesia and Thrace across the Danube frontier, and laid siege to Marcianopolis, as the Carpi, encouraged by the Gothic incursions, renewed their assaults in Dacia and Moesia. Meanwhile, in the East, Marcus Jotapianus led another uprising in response to the oppressive rule of Priscus and the excessive taxation of the Eastern provinces. Other usurpers, like Marcus Silbannacus are reported to have started rebellions without much success.

Overwhelmed by the number of invasions and usurpers, Philip offered to resign, but the Senate decided to throw its support behind the emperor, with a certain Gaius Messius Quintus Decius most vocal of all the senators. Philip was so impressed by his support that he dispatched Decius to the region with a special command encompassing all of the Pannonian and Moesian provinces. This had a dual purpose of both quelling the rebellion of Pacatianus as well as dealing with the barbarian incursions.

Although Decius managed to quell the revolt, discontent in the legions was growing. Decius was proclaimed emperor by the Danubian armies in the spring of 249 and immediately marched on Rome. Yet even before he had left the region, the situation for Philip had turned even more sour. Financial difficulties had forced him to debase the antoninianus, as rioting began to occur in Egypt, causing disruptions to Rome&#x27;s wheat supply and further eroding Philip&#x27;s support in the capital.

Although Decius tried to come to terms with Philip, Philip&#x27;s army met the usurper near modern Verona that summer. Decius easily won the battle and Philip was killed sometime in September 249, either in the fighting or assassinated by his own soldiers who were eager to please the new ruler. Philip&#x27;s eleven-year-old son and heir may have been killed with his father and Priscus disappeared without a trace.

==Attitude towards Christianity==
Some later traditions, first mentioned by the historian Eusebius in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, held that Philip was the first Christian Roman Emperor. According to Eusebius (&quot;Ecc. Hist.&quot; VI.34), Philip was a Christian, but was not allowed to enter Easter vigil services until he confessed his sins and was ordered to sit among the penitents, which he did willingly. Later versions located this event in Antioch.

However, historians generally identify the later Emperor Constantine, baptized on his deathbed, as the first Christian emperor, and generally describe Philip&#x27;s adherence to Christianity as dubious, because non-Christian writers do not mention the fact, and because throughout his reign, Philip to all appearances (coinage, etc.) continued to follow the state religion. Critics ascribe Eusebius&#x27; claim as probably due to the tolerance Philip showed towards Christians.

<doc id="144167" wikidata="Q2453332" url="?curid=144167" title="Aunt May">
<text>Maybelle &quot;May&quot; Parker-Jameson (née Reilly), commonly known as Aunt May, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the superhero Spider-Man. Making her first full appearance in &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 (August 1962), the character was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, playing an influential role in the Spider-Man comic books.

May is the widow of Ben Parker and the paternal aunt by marriage of Peter Parker, who leads a secret life as Spider-Man. She is nurturing and supportive of Peter as a mother figure, although throughout most of Spider-Man&#x27;s history, she has not known of his secret life and considered Spider-Man frightening. In modern renditions, May has been known to support the hero and in rare cases is aware that he is her nephew or at least suspecting his identity as Peter. Later in life, she marries J. Jonah &quot;Jay&quot; Jameson Sr., the estranged father of Peter&#x27;s boss and Spider-Man&#x27;s harshest critic J. Jonah Jameson, making him her step-son and by extension Peter&#x27;s step-cousin (and self-declared step-brother), much to Jameson&#x27;s discomfort.

Since May&#x27;s conception, the character has appeared in several media adaptations of Spider-Man, often playing a supporting role. May was portrayed by Rosemary Harris in Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy, Sally Field in Marc Webb&#x27;s &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; duology and Marisa Tomei in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films. In the &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; franchise, the character was voiced by Lily Tomlin in &quot;Into the Spider-Verse&quot; and Elizabeth Perkins in &quot;Across the Spider-Verse&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
May Parker (née Reilly) was born in Brooklyn, New York on May 5. After the death of her brother-in-law and his wife, May and her husband Ben Parker took in their only nephew, Peter, and raised him at their home at 20 Ingram Street, Forest Hills, Queens. She remained an important influence in Peter&#x27;s life even during college as she was the only family he had left. Her continued belief that Peter was still the fragile boy he had been before he gained his powers could be frustrating at times.

In the early years of his superhero career, Peter feared for May&#x27;s well-being and the fatal shock that he believed would end her life if she ever learned about his dual identity as Spider-Man. Consequently, Peter often felt anguish over dealing with major crises while his aunt needed nearly constant care. This conflict took on an unusual turn when May became sweethearts with his enemy, Otto Octavius (also known as Doctor Octopus), and Peter struggled to deal with his enemy&#x27;s schemes while not hurting his aunt.

During a period of convalescence at a nursing home, May met wheelchair user Nathan Lubensky. Gradually, May and Nathan fell in love with each other. She invited Nathan into her Forest Hills home after converting it into a boarding house, and the couple were briefly engaged. However, May&#x27;s heart was broken when Nathan suffered a fatal heart attack while protecting her from being taken hostage by Adrian Toomes, the costumed villain known as the Vulture. Some time thereafter, a guilt-stricken Toomes confronted May, begging her to forgive him for his role in Nathan&#x27;s death. (Ironically, Nathan had befriended Toomes when the two briefly resided at the same nursing home). May refused to do so, stating that only God could provide the villain with the redemption he was seeking.

As part of a plan by Peter&#x27;s arch-foe Norman Osborn, May was replaced by a &quot;genetically altered actress&quot; who impersonated her while May was held captive by villains until the actress died, Osborn returning May to Peter with a device planted inside her that would detonate a series of gene bombs if removed, decimating Earth. Mister Fantastic was able to disable the device without removing it, saving the world and May, who apparently retained no memory of her time in captivity. May finally learned about her nephew&#x27;s secret life when she walked into his room after he had sustained a serious beating from the villain Morlun, the two later talking about May&#x27;s discovery as May came to accept her nephew&#x27;s real life.

When Spider-Man joins the Avengers, Peter, Aunt May, and Mary Jane Watson move into Stark Tower after May loses her house to a fire. During the Superhero Civil War, she and Mary Jane convince Peter to unmask himself in front of a press conference. Later, she is targeted by the Chameleon, but outwits the villain by feeding him Ambien-filled oatmeal-raisin cookies.

When Peter changes his mind about the Superhuman Registration Act, he moves his family from Stark Tower to a motel. An assassin hired by the Kingpin tries to kill Peter, but hits May instead. Peter takes May to a hospital where she lapses into a coma and is likely to die. However, Aunt May receives a radioactive blood transfusion from Peter, which he hoped would save her life due to his mutated healing factor.

The demon Mephisto offers to restore May&#x27;s health in exchange for erasing Peter&#x27;s marriage from history, and Peter and Mary Jane agree. May lives, and Spider-Man&#x27;s identity is once again a secret.

At the beginning of &quot;Brand New Day&quot;, May is doing volunteer work for a homeless shelter, run by Martin Li, the supervillain crime boss Mister Negative. At this point, her knowledge of Peter being Spider-Man was erased. During her work at the shelter, she met John Jonah &quot;Jay&quot; Jameson (the father of J. Jonah Jameson) and started a relationship with him. The following issue, Peter caught the two of them in bed. However, he approved of this relationship, mainly because Jay supports Spider-Man, who had previously saved his life, and saw through Norman Osborn as a thug who holds nothing but contempt for the people.

Jay walked with May in Central Park and asked her to marry him, and May accepted. Despite Doctor Octopus&#x27; subconscious efforts to halt his former fiancé&#x27;s wedding plans, May and Jay were reluctantly wedded by New York Mayor J. Jonah Jameson, who expressed displeasure at Peter calling them stepbrothers (due to May being his adoptive mother).

Aunt May has several blood relatives that are still alive, including a sister named Jan. May&#x27;s first cousins Sam and Julia are the children of her uncle Bill and his wife Claudia. Peter was attracted to Julia&#x27;s daughter Alexa. The Reilly family is currently staying in May&#x27;s house.

Upon her return from her honeymoon, she stops by the FEAST offices, only to accidentally walk in on Martin Li, along with Hammerhead torturing one of Mr. Negative&#x27;s Inner Demons. Trying to escape, Li touches her with his corrupting touch. She then returns to meet her husband and Peter. When Jay suggests going somewhere nice for dinner, Aunt May sarcastically proceeds to insult Peter over his fluctuating jobs and his dependence on them, culminating with calling her nephew &quot;One damn big disappointment&quot;. A heartbroken Peter runs off. Peter returns, after a physically and mentally exhausting battle against the Lizard, tries talking to Aunt May, looking for someone to help give him hope after seeing the death of Curt Connors&#x27; humanity. She still continues to act like a bad-tempered teenager and at first, rebuffs him. However, after seeing Peter clearly suffering mentally, she feels guilty and undergoes an intense mind battle, breaking the corruption, and is shown simply sitting next to Peter.

Prior to the events of &quot;Spider-Island&quot;, after Martin Li&#x27;s secret identity is exposed to the public, May and Jay formally announce their intention to leave New York for good, for their own safety, and move to Boston. Jay explains this was the result of all the recent major incidents towards them and their friends and family. They put May&#x27;s old house up for sale and leave once the moving van is packed. After spending their last night in New York at Jay&#x27;s apartment, the following day she and Jay head to an airport in New Jersey with Peter and Carlie and they say their goodbyes before flying off. Following the &quot;Ends of the Earth&quot; storyline, when May and Jay are returning home to New York on their private jet, but the irresponsible superhero Alpha uses his powers without care in his battle with Terminus causes many aircraft to shut down. The Avengers rescue everybody and Spider-Man saves his May and Jay from Jameson&#x27;s malfunctioning private jet just before it crashes. Later Peter arrives at the hospital to see that his Aunt May and Jay are okay, although she has sustained minor nerve damage to her leg that will require the use of a cane for the rest of her life. In &quot;The Superior Spider-Man&quot; storyline, Aunt May&#x27;s leg is fully healed from operation and completion surgery with gratitude of Doctor Wirtham.

As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot;, May and Jay became part of the Parker Industries&#x27;s foundation, a charity focused on providing help for the less fortunate and raise the quality of life wherever it could be possible. However, her husband Jay had coughed up blood and collapsed. Aunt May is heartbroken after her husband Jay had later died in the hospital. Aunt May, Peter and J. Jonah Jameson held a moment of silence.

After Peter Parker had his doctorate revoked for &quot;copying&quot; Doctor Octopus&#x27; thesis and getting fired from the Daily Bugle, May confronted her nephew about his actions. While stating that he should take responsibility for his actions, May leaves stating that Uncle Ben should have raised him better. Shortly afterwards, she was diagnosed with cancer and does not tell Peter to avoid overwhelming him.

==Other versions==

===Original appearance===
Lee and Ditko introduced a character named &quot;Aunt May&quot; alongside &quot;Uncle Ben&quot; in the June 1962 issue of &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #97, four months before her &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; debut. In the story &quot;Goodbye to Linda Brown&quot;, the characters are given no surname. They care for a young woman named Linda Brown who develops a sleepwalking habit, just like May and Ben used to have. When Linda sleepwalks to the sea in her wheelchair, she becomes a mermaid. These characters have never been established in-universe to be the same May and Ben that appear in &quot;Spider-Man&quot; 

===Golden Oldie===
May Parker was transformed by Galactus into the cosmically powered being Golden Oldie to serve as his herald. Rather than lead him to populated worlds, Oldie discovered an extraterrestrial baker who bakes planet-sized snack cakes that sate Galactus&#x27;s hunger. May&#x27;s transformation is ultimately revealed as a dream. The issue, a parody of an old Hostess snack cake advertising campaign, was part of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Assistant Editors Month&quot; series of humorous issues.

May also appeared as &quot;Golden Oldie&quot; (this time an Iron Man parody) as well as &quot;The Astonishing Aunt Ant&quot; and &quot;Auntie Freeze&quot; in an issue of &quot;What If?&quot;.

===MC2===
In the alternate timeline known as MC2, May Parker&#x27;s death in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #400 was valid. It was May who died in this continuum, rather than an actress. Peter&#x27;s daughter, May &quot;Mayday&quot; Parker, was named for her. Mayday became the super-heroine Spider-Girl and met the original May when she found herself displaced in time, although Mayday makes no attempt to explain who she really was.

When Spider-Girl was trapped in an illusion by her enemy, Misery, she was given encouragement from a familiar spirit. She recognised the spirit as being Aunt May.

In the final arc of &quot;Amazing Spider-Girl&quot;, Aunt May acts a spiritual advisor to May to help her grandniece reclaim her identity and save Peter from Norman Osborn. In this form, she initially appears as a younger version of herself, which prevents May from recognizing her. However, May finally figures it out when she sees Aunt May through her father&#x27;s eyes.

===&quot;Spider-Man: Life Story&quot;===
In this continuity, the characters age naturally after Peter Parker became Spider-Man in 1962. Sometime before 1977, May married Otto Octavius, but she later divorced him due to his anger management problems. In the 1980s, Mary Jane struggles to take care of May as she shows early signs of dementia around the time Mary Jane and Peter&#x27;s twins are born. It puts a further rift in Peter and Mary Jane&#x27;s marriage as Peter refuses to put her in a senior&#x27;s home while Mary Jane is sick of being the sole caretaker of May and their children. Mary Jane later leaves Peter and takes the twins with her as Peter looks after May. May later dies sometime before 1995. When Otto attempts to destroy Peter&#x27;s mind in 2019, Peter uses a memory of May to convince Otto to stop fighting Spider-Man and accept his life&#x27;s limitations. The conjured memory version of May has one final talk with Peter before he saves the world from Doctor Doom&#x27;s reign at the cost of his life.

===&quot;Spider-Verse&quot;===
During the &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; storyline, there are different versions of Aunt May that are featured:

* An alternate Aunt May from Earth-14512 appears in a flashback along with her version of Uncle Ben. They are depicted as scientists and the ones who informed Peni Parker that she was the only person able to carry on the SP//dr project after her father, the original pilot, died in battle. Peni accepted the responsibility, allowing the radioactive spider that formed the other half of SP//dr&#x27;s CPU to bite her. When Addy Brock lost control of the VEN#m, May flew in to the mech to manually shut it down, only to be consumed by it. After SP//dr defeats VEN#m, she finds Addy and May gone.
* In an unknown reality, Aunt May and Uncle Ben are with their nephew Peter at the hospital after he suffers an allergic reaction to the radioactive spider bite, leaving him in a coma. Because of this, they are out of their house when it is burgled by the thief that killed Ben in the 616 universe. Peter transforms into Man-Spider and attacks May and Ben, but gets stopped by Spider-Man Noir. Six-Armed Spider-Man creates a cure for this Peter, allowing him to live a normal life with May and Ben.
* On Earth-803, May Reilly is a young woman living in a 19th-century steampunk-inspired New York. Her father studied animals, and one day when she let a spider out of its cage to get it comfort and to pet it, she got bit and learned that it was important not to let anyone cage her. After her father died, she used spare parts to create a suit with four mechanical arms that allowed her to climb walls as well as web shooters. While attending a ball, the mayor was kidnapped by the Six Men of Sinestry, so she stepped in to stop them; making her debut as the Lady Spider. Though the villains manage to get the mayor&#x27;s plans, she defeats them and forces them to retreat. Following this, she is recruited into the Spider-Army. The Inheritors attacked them, separating her from the rest, though she accompanied Spider-Man 2099 to his dimension to fend off the Inheritor Daemos. They then traveled to Earth-13 before going back to her dimension to fix the Japanese Spider-Man&#x27;s Leopardon before they piloted it into battle against the Inheritors in Loomworld.
* Earth-11&#x27;s May Parker is the aunt of Penelope Parker, who told her about the spider bite she received during an accident at Osborn Labs, how she developed spider-like abilities, and how she wanted to hide her powers so people would think she was normal. However, Aunt May convinced her niece being normal was overrated and that she should embrace what happened to her to help people.
* On Earth-3123, Aunt May is known as Spider-Ma&#x27;am. She ended up getting bitten by the radioactive spider instead of Peter as she showed up to the science demonstration to give Peter his lunch. After revealing her identity to Ben and Peter, Peter develops web shooters and the two help May with her heroic activities on the sidelines. During the events of &quot;Spider-Verse&quot;, she and her family were confronted by Karn of the Inheritors. Sensing that he was too strong for her, she proposed to offer her life for the sake of her family, causing Karn to temporarily hesitate as she reminded him of his mother. He nearly killed her, but several multiversal Spider-Men intervened and convinced him to join them. During the &quot;Spider-Geddon&quot; storyline, Spider-Ma&#x27;am joined the fight against the Inheritors. When the villains are defeated, Superior Spider-Man cloned them as babies. After talking with her husband, Spider-Ma&#x27;am agreed to take them in as foster children.

===&quot;Spider-Geddon&quot;===
During the &quot;Spider-Geddon&quot; storyline, an unidentified Earth has a Hispanic version of May who is unaware that her husband and nephew have spider powers after a blood transfusion saved Uncle Ben&#x27;s life.

===&quot;Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows&quot;===
In this &quot;Secret Wars&quot; Warzone, when Peter is captured by Regent and his life is flashing before his eyes, one of his memories was him standing in front of Aunt May&#x27;s open casket at her funeral, confirming that she died sometime before the events of the comic.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the Ultimate Marvel universe Aunt May is based on writer Brian Michael Bendis&#x27; mother. This version of the character is a strong and independent woman in her late forties or early fifties, significantly younger than her original Marvel Universe counterpart. She is the biological sister of Mary Parker, and wife to Ben Parker.

Peter reveals his secret identity to May after he finds Gwen Stacy&#x27;s clone at her old house, resulting in May evicting Peter from her home, as she despises Spider-Man. This coincides with the appearance of a man who appears to be Richard Parker, Peter&#x27;s father. Peter learns that May had known this man, actually an artificially-aged clone of Peter, and she kept this secret from Peter to &quot;protect him&quot;. After a long talk between Peter and his &quot;father&quot;, Nick Fury and a team of Spider Slayers surround the Parker home, which triggers a transformation in Gwen, turning her into Carnage. May then suffers a heart attack. She is rescued from dying by Sue Storm of the Fantastic Four, reconciles with Peter and accepts his life as Spider-Man, though she is not at all fond of his costume. Peter later explains to May why he became Spider-Man, and May tells him that Ben would be proud of him for doing so. Aunt May is by Peter&#x27;s side when he dies following a battle with the Green Goblin.

Although angry at the Ultimates for belittling Peter&#x27;s accomplishments in life when attending her nephew&#x27;s funeral, May is nevertheless comforted when she met some of the people that Peter had saved during his career as Spider-Man, one little girl even offering her a comforting hug as thanks for raising the man who saved her. After the funeral, May and Gwen decide to take up Tony Stark&#x27;s offer to set themselves up for a new life in France.

However, following the emergence of a new Spider-Man, May and Gwen return to New York. Though Captain America threatens to arrest Miles&#x27; parents and expose his secret to them unless he retires the Spider-Man identity, May and Gwen are more supportive of Miles, and May gives him Peter&#x27;s old web-shooters, along with the formula for the web-fluid, encouraging him to carry on Peter&#x27;s legacy.

During the &quot;Spider-Men&quot; miniseries, May and Gwen are back in the United States, presumably to oversee the selling of the Parker Residence and to finish Gwen&#x27;s term at Midtown High. They encounter someone wearing a red-and-blue Spider-Man costume and believe he is a lunatic who is disrespecting Peter&#x27;s memory. They become angry and threaten to call the police. When the person unmasks himself, they are stunned beyond belief to see the older, more mature Peter Parker, from the Marvel 616 universe. She initially is unconvinced that this Peter is who he says he is, but both she and Gwen later realize he is being truthful when he knows Uncle Ben&#x27;s admonishment about power and responsibility. May is greatly moved at realizing that she has now been given the chance for closure that she had missed when her Peter died, and concludes that she had made the right choices concerning her nephew, before the adult Peter is returned to his universe.

When Green Goblin escapes custody after S.H.I.E.L.D. was shut down, he arrives at the front yard of Aunt May&#x27;s house and confronts Miles. Aunt May and Gwen are inside watching the television where the battle of Miles and Green Goblin was being broadcast. Soon, a very much alive Peter emerges to aid Miles in the fight, to the surprise of Aunt May and Gwen. Green Goblin flees at his arrival and the two Spider-Men depart. Gwen is unsure of the identity of the original Spider-Man, but Aunt May assures her that his motives show that it is him. Later, Aunt May and Gwen walk over to Mary Jane&#x27;s house and overhear Peter&#x27;s unknown resurrection. Aunt May sprints over and joyfully reunites with her nephew. After the two Spider-Men defeat Green Goblin, Peter tells Aunt May that he intends to go on a quest to find out the truth of his mystery resurrection.

<text>The Gallic Empire or the Gallic Roman Empire are names used in modern historiography for a breakaway part of the Roman Empire that functioned &quot;de facto&quot; as a separate state from 260 to 274. It originated during the Crisis of the Third Century, when a series of Roman military leaders and aristocrats declared themselves emperors and took control of Gaul and adjacent provinces without attempting to conquer Italy or otherwise seize the central Roman administrative apparatus.

The Gallic Empire was established by Postumus in 260 in the wake of barbarian invasions and instability in Rome, and at its height included the territories of Germania, Gaul, Britannia, and (for a time) Hispania. After Postumus&#x27; assassination in 269 it lost much of its territory, but continued under a number of emperors and usurpers. It was retaken by Roman emperor Aurelian after the Battle of Châlons in 274.

==History==

===Origins===
The Roman Crisis of the Third Century continued as the Emperor Valerian was defeated and captured by the Sasanian Empire of Persia in the Battle of Edessa, together with a large part of the Roman field army in the east. This left his son Gallienus in very shaky control. Shortly thereafter, the Palmyrene leader Odaenathus gained control of a wide swath of the east, including Egypt, Syria, Judea, and Arabia Petraea; while he was nominally loyal to the Roman government, his domain was &quot;de facto&quot; independent and has come to be referred to as the Palmyrene Empire.

The governors in Pannonia staged unsuccessful local revolts. The Emperor left for the Danube to attend to their disruption. This left Postumus, who was governor of Germania Superior and Inferior, in charge at the Rhine border. An exceptional administrator, Postumus had also ably protected Germania Inferior against an invasion led by the Franks in the summer of 260. In fact, Postumus defeated the Frankish forces at Empel so decisively that there would be no further Germanic raids for ten years. This all combined to make Postumus one of the most powerful men in the western reaches of the Roman Empire.

Gallienus&#x27;s son Saloninus and the praetorian prefect Silvanus remained at Colonia Agrippina (Cologne), to keep the young heir out of danger and perhaps also as a check on Postumus&#x27; ambitions. Before long, however, Postumus besieged Colonia Agrippina and put the young heir and his guardian to death, making his revolt official. Postumus is thought to have established his capital there or at Augusta Treverorum (Trier). Lugdunum (Lyon) was one of the most important cities in the area under his control.

Postumus did not make any effort to extend his control into Italy or to depose Gallienus. Instead, he established parallel institutions modelled on the Roman Empire&#x27;s central government: his regime had its own praetorian guard, two annually elected consuls (not all of the names have survived), and probably its own senate. According to the numismatic evidence, Postumus held the office of consul five times.

Postumus successfully fended off a military incursion by Gallienus in 263, and was never challenged by him again. However, in early 269 he was challenged by Laelianus, who was probably one of his own commanders. Laelianus was declared emperor at Mogontiacum (now Mainz) by his Legio XXII Primigenia. In response, Postumus quickly retook Mogontiacum and Laelianus was killed. In the aftermath of the battle, however, Postumus was overthrown and killed by his own troops, reportedly because he did not allow them to sack the city.

===After Postumus===

An officer in Postumus&#x27; army, Marcus Aurelius Marius, was installed as Emperor upon Postumus&#x27;s death, but died very shortly after; ancient sources writing much later state that he reigned only two days, though it is more likely, based on the numismatic record, that he reigned for a few months. Subsequently, the tribune of the praetorians, Marcus Piavonius Victorinus came to power, being recognized as Emperor in northern Gaul and Britannia, but not in Hispania. Meanwhile, Roman Emperor Gallienus had been killed in a coup in 268, and his successor in the central Roman provinces, Claudius Gothicus, re-established Roman authority in Gallia Narbonensis and parts of Gallia Aquitania; there is some evidence that the provinces of Hispania, which did not recognize Postumus&#x27;s successors in Gaul, may have realigned with Rome then.

Victorinus spent most of his reign dealing with insurgencies and attempting to recover the Gaulish territories taken by Claudius Gothicus. He was assassinated in 271, but his mother Victoria took control of his troops and used her power to influence the selection of his successor. With Victoria&#x27;s support, the governor of Gallia Aquitania, Gaius Pius Esuvius Tetricus was made Emperor, and was recognized in Britannia and the parts of Gaul that had recognized Victorinus. Tetricus fought off Germanic barbarians who had begun ravaging Gaul after the death of Victorinus, and was able to re-take Gallia Aquitania and western Gallia Narbonensis while Claudius Gothicus&#x27;s successor Aurelian was in the east fighting the Palmyrene Empire, now in open revolt against Roman authority under Queen Zenobia. Tetricus established the imperial court at Trier, and in 273 he elevated his son, also named Tetricus, to the rank of Caesar.

The following year the younger Tetricus was made co-consul with his father, but the area under their control grew weak from internal strife, including a mutiny led by the usurper Faustinus. By that time Aurelian had defeated the Palmyrene Empire and had made plans to reconquer the west. He moved into Gaul and defeated Tetricus at the Battle of Châlons in 274. According to some sources, Tetricus offered to surrender in exchange for clemency for him and his son before the battle. This detail may be later propaganda, but either way, Aurelian was victorious, and the Gallic Empire was effectively ended. In contrast with his propaganda after the recent defeat of Zenobia, Aurelian did not present his recapture of Gaul as a victory over a foreign enemy, and indeed many officials who had served in the army and administration of the Gallic Empire continued their careers, including Tetricus, who was appointed to an administrative post in Italy.

==Causes==

The Gallic Empire was symptomatic of the fragmentation of power during the third-century crisis. It has also been taken to represent autonomous trends in the western provinces, including proto-feudalistic tendencies among the Gaulish land-owning class whose support has sometimes been thought to have underpinned the strength of the Gallic Empire, and an interplay between the strength of Roman institutions and the growing importance of provincial concerns.

One of Postumus&#x27; primary objectives as emperor was evidently the defense of the Germanic frontier. In 261, he repelled mixed groups of Franks and Alamanni to hold the Rhine &quot;limes&quot; secure (though lands beyond the upper Rhine and Danube had to be abandoned to the barbarians within a couple of years). In so doing, Postumus positioned himself avowedly as not only the defender and restorer of Gaul, but also as the upholder of the Roman name.

Similarly with the withdrawal of legions after 408, many Britons desired a localized Roman authority rather than nationalist revolt. The desire for Roman order and institutions was entirely compatible with a degree of national or regional separatism.

==List of Gallic Emperors==

The Gallic Emperors are known primarily from the coins they minted. The political and military history of the Gallic Empire can be sketched through the careers of these emperors. Their names are as follows:
* Postumus 260–269 
** (Laelian 269, usurper)
* Marius 269
* Victorinus 268/69–271
** (Domitian II 271?, usurper)
* Tetricus I 271–274
* Tetricus II 273–274 (son of Tetricus I; Caesar) 
** (Faustinus 273/74, usurper)

Postumus the Younger, Empress Victoria and Victorinus Junior are included as leaders in the list of the Thirty Tyrants, but there are no coins or inscriptions about them. Victorinus Junior and Postumus the Younger are both now generally considered to be fictional while Victoria’s existence was proven by the discovery of her funerary stele in 2012.

<doc id="144170" wikidata="Q945817" url="?curid=144170" title="Gwen Stacy">
<text>Gwendolyne Maxine &quot;Gwen&quot; Stacy is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, usually as a supporting character in those featuring Spider-Man. A college student and the daughter of George and Helen Stacy, she was the first romantic interest for Peter following his high school graduation before she was murdered by the Green Goblin (Norman Osborn). Her death has haunted Peter ever since, and stories published long afterwards indicate she still holds a special place in his heart. Gwen was posthumously subjected to numerous cloning experiments by her former professor Miles Warren, Peter&#x27;s clone Ben Reilly, and an A.I. of Harry Osborn, the latter resulting in the creation of the Kindreds, and Ben briefly resurrecting Gwen in &quot;Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy&quot; (2016–2017), with the embodiment of Death herself confirming in &quot;Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider&quot; (2017–2018) that all clones Ben created of deceased people had their souls intact on being brought back, while clones of living people (like Ben himself) had unique souls of their own. In &quot;Gwenpool&quot; (2025), she is resurrected with Weapon X-like abilities under the name Gwenpool, stolen from isekai protagonist Gwen Poole, who teams up with Peter to stop her. In the alternate realities of Ultimate Marvel and &quot;Spider-Gwen&quot;, a still-living Gwen respectively becomes their universe&#x27;s versions of Carnage and Spider-Woman.

The character was portrayed by Bryce Dallas Howard in &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; (2007) and by Emma Stone in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; film series (2012–2014) and &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot; (2023; archive footage). A multiverse Spider-Gwen is voiced by Hailee Steinfeld in the 2018 animated film &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot; and its sequel &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot; (2023), and will reprise the role in&quot; Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse&quot; (TBA) and &quot;Spider-Woman&quot; (TBA).

==Publication history==

Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, Gwen Stacy first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #31 (December 1965).

==Fictional character biography==
===Early history===

In her initial appearances, Peter Parker met Gwen while both are studying as undergraduates at Empire State University, but with Aunt May in the hospital, Peter was troubled and ignores her advances. She dated both Flash Thompson and Harry Osborn to make Peter jealous. Gradually, however, a romance develops; Gwen, a science major, appreciated Peter&#x27;s intellect. Their relationship began almost immediately after Peter stops going out with Mary Jane Watson, whom he begins to see as shallow and self-absorbed.

Later issues introduced Gwen&#x27;s father, NYPD Captain George Stacy, as well as her mother Helen Stacy and her uncle Arthur Stacy. Though her father was both fond of Peter and supportive of his alter-ego Spider-Man, his death strained Peter&#x27;s relationship with Gwen after he is killed by falling debris during a battle involving Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus. Gwen blamed Spider-Man for his death, and left for Europe to cope with her loss. She wanted Peter to ask her to marry him and convince her to stay, but his guilt stopped him from proposing. Gwen&#x27;s feelings for Peter eventually prompted her to return to New York, and their relationship is rekindled.

According to Lee, who scripted all of the stories featuring Gwen Stacy up to this point, the original intent was for Gwen Stacy to be Spider-Man&#x27;s central love interest. However, Mary Jane Watson&#x27;s unexpected popularity with readers after her debut changed the course of the plan as fans liked Mary Jane more and demanded she be Peter Parker&#x27;s main love interest instead, and that &quot;no matter how we [i.e. Lee and his artist/co-plotter collaborators] wrote it, Mary Jane always seemed more interesting!&quot;

===Death===
Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas succeeded Stan Lee as writer and editor, respectively, of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. Together with inker John Romita, Sr., they came to the decision to have Gwen Stacy killed. It was Romita who first suggested the idea, during a plotting session with Conway when Romita was still penciller on &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. Conway later said his contribution to the decision was motivated by a desire to bring Mary Jane Watson to the forefront, as he shared Lee&#x27;s feeling that she was a more interesting character than Gwen Stacy: &quot;[Mary Jane] hadn&#x27;t lost the edge that made her an interesting character. Gwen didn&#x27;t have an edge. She was just a nice person&quot;.

In &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #121 (&quot;Night Gwen Stacy Died&quot;, June 1973), the Green Goblin kidnaps Gwen Stacy and threw her off a bridge (depicted as the Brooklyn Bridge but described in the text as the George Washington Bridge). Spider-Man shot a web strand at Gwen&#x27;s legs and catches her, but her neck is broken by the whiplash from her sudden stop.

In Superior Spider-Man #3, Peter briefly reunites with Gwen and her father in the afterlife, along with all his other lost loved ones, while in Doctor Octopus&#x27;s failing body. Peter apologizes to them both for failing them but neither hold Peter accountable with Gwen even saying that “it worked out” because they were “together” and kissed him on the cheek.

Both the decision to kill Gwen and the method in which Marvel implemented it remain controversial among fans because some believe that Peter himself was the one who caused her death. The death became a pivotal point in both Spider-Man&#x27;s history and in American comic books in general. Many point to Gwen&#x27;s death as the end of the Silver Age of Comics. Before her death, except possibly as part of an origin story, superheroes did not fail so catastrophically, nor did the hero&#x27;s loved ones die so suddenly and without warning.

A note on the letters page of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #125 states: &quot;It saddens us to say that the whiplash effect she underwent when Spidey&#x27;s webbing stopped her so suddenly was, in fact, what killed her&quot;. The comic book &quot;Civil War: Casualties of War: Captain America/Iron Man&quot; (2007) concurred that the proximate cause of death was the sudden stop during a high-speed fall. An issue of &quot;Peter Parker/Spider-Man&quot; revisits the issue, and further confirms Gwen died of a broken neck due to the use of the webbing. On the other hand, in the 1987 edition of the &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot;, Gwen&#x27;s death is attributed to the fall, not to Spider-Man&#x27;s webbing, though the listed cause of death is still technically true – if she hadn&#x27;t fallen from the bridge, the event that caused her death couldn&#x27;t have happened. In his book &quot;The Physics of Superheroes&quot;, physicist James Kakalios confirms that, consistent with Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, the sudden stop would have killed Gwen Stacy.

Within the Marvel Comics, Gwen Stacy&#x27;s death has enormous repercussions. Mary Jane Watson feels the loss of Gwen deeply and becomes a more mature, compassionate person. Gwen&#x27;s death also draws Peter and Mary Jane into a closer friendship, and eventually to romance. Miles Warren, one of Gwen&#x27;s professors, was secretly in love with her. Following her death, Warren goes insane and adopts the persona of the Jackal. In the fourth and final issue of the miniseries &quot;Marvels&quot; (April 1994), photographer Phil Sheldon befriends Gwen Stacy, who has absolved Spider-Man of any blame for her father&#x27;s death. Gwen&#x27;s simple faith in heroes convinces Sheldon of the purpose of the &quot;Marvels&quot; (i.e., superheroes)—to protect innocents such as Gwen. He resolves to write a book to praise the heroes and what they should mean to humanity. When the Green Goblin kidnaps Gwen and holds her hostage to bait Spider-Man, Sheldon frantically follows the resulting chase in a taxi and witnesses her death. While it is reported that she died from the shock of the fall, Sheldon thinks it looks like something else. Sheldon&#x27;s faith in the Marvels is shattered.

===Clones===
Following the publication of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #121, Stan Lee (who had since become Marvel&#x27;s publisher) was frequently criticized by fans during his public appearances for killing off Gwen Stacy. Lee, who had also found the character&#x27;s death objectionable, insisted that Conway write a story bringing her back. Conway strongly objected since he felt any sort of resurrection would break the plausibility of the stories, but ultimately gave in under the condition that after reviving Gwen, he could write her out of the book as soon as he wanted. He decided that cloning would be the best means to bring the character back.

In the resulting story, written approximately two years after the story of Gwen Stacy&#x27;s death, &quot;Gwen&quot; reappears, perfectly healthy but with no memory of the time since her death. This story, published in &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #144 (May 1975), initiated the original Clone Saga. At the end of that story, Gwen&#x27;s clone, a creation of Spider-Man villain the Jackal, leaves to find a new life for herself, coming to accept that she is not really the same person who had a relationship with Peter Parker.

In the 1988 crossover &quot;The Evolutionary War&quot;, the High Evolutionary, who had once been Miles Warren&#x27;s teacher, captures Gwen&#x27;s clone. He determines that Warren had actually not perfected the process, and instead injected a young woman with a genetic virus carrying Gwen&#x27;s DNA, turning her into a copy of Gwen. After a subsequent altercation of Spider-Man and the Young Gods against the High Evolutionary&#x27;s Purifiers, this woman is purged of the virus by the Young Goddess Daydreamer. This is later retconned, with the High Evolutionary stating that Warren had in fact succeeded in perfecting his own cloning technique, and Daydreamer had accidentally given the Gwen clone a false new life under the name of Joyce Delaney.

During the second &quot;Clone Saga&quot;, Joyce, now married to a clone of Professor Warren named Warren Miles, sees a copy of Peter Parker&#x27;s book of Spider-Man photos, &quot;Webs&quot;, and remembers (to an extent) her real history. She returns to New York City, but after helping Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider fight the Jackal, she again disappears from Spider-Man&#x27;s life. She makes herself a new life in London, but before she is murdered by the Gwen Stacy clone known as Abby-L shows signs of clone degeneration.

Another Gwen clone appears in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #399 (March 1995). This clone believes she is the real Gwen. She dies from clone degeneration in &quot;Spider-Man&quot; #56 (March 1995), the next issue of the story arc.

A further Gwen clone appears in the &quot;Sibling Rivalry&quot; crossover storyline between &quot;Superior Spider-Man Team-Up&quot; and &quot;Scarlet Spider&quot;. She joins the Jackal (alongside Carrion and a regular Miles Warren clone) in capturing Superior Spider-Man and Kaine. She is sympathetic towards &quot;Peter&quot; and Kaine, but at the same time utterly loyal to the Jackal. When the Spiders break free, Superior Spider-Man disarms and attempts to kill her, but is stopped by Kaine. When the Jackal&#x27;s lab is engulfed in flames, Kaine offers to save her, but she refuses, and is seemingly consumed by the fire.

===&quot;Stacy Twins&quot;: Sarah and Gabriel===

The story arc &quot;Sins Past&quot; by J. Michael Straczynski apparently reveals that Gwen Stacy had an affair with Norman Osborn and fell pregnant with twins, a girl and a boy, to whom she gave birth while in France, and named Sarah and Gabriel Stacy, respectively. Gwen vowed to raise the twins with Peter Parker and refused to allow Norman access—an event which precipitated Norman&#x27;s decision to kill her. By the time that Peter and his (then-considered-to-be) wife, Mary Jane Watson-Parker, discovered the twins&#x27; existence, they were grown to adult proportions, despite the relatively &quot;short&quot; time since Gwen&#x27;s death, due to the genetic effects of their father&#x27;s &quot;goblin formula&quot;.

Sarah and Gabriel revealed their existence to Peter, with threats and as masked figures, after their father was publicly exposed as the Green Goblin—sending to Peter a page of an unsent letter from Gwen &quot;from a time when she traveled to Europe between college semesters&quot;—which revealed her pregnancy; an analysis of the letter by police detective Lamont revealed handwriting impressions of a second page—saying that she had given birth, with the twins born fully developed after only seven month&#x27;s gestation. When Peter as Spider-Man went a genetics lab, where he would prove Gwen&#x27;s maternity of the twins, Sarah confronted him, and Spider-Man unmasked Sarah—finding her to be &quot;a dead ringer for Gwen&quot;. Gwen Stacy herself, however, only appears in this story arc in flashback, as Mary Jane explained to Peter that she knew about Gwen&#x27;s illegitimate offspring and Norman&#x27;s paternity thereof because she overheard Gwen and Norman arguing over custody of the children—a secret of Gwen&#x27;s that Mary Jane had &quot;promised to keep all these years&quot;. Sarah later signed up with Interpol, while Gabriel later become the Gray Goblin.

Marvel would later retcon this revelation in the pages of Nick Spencer&#x27;s run on &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; during the Sinister War event. Norman Osborn arrives at the safe house of Gabriel and Sarah in Paris, where an Artificial Intelligence back-up copy of his son Harry reveals to Norman that he never truly fathered the twins, and that he never had a sexual encounter with Gwen Stacy. The whole plan was to convince him he had the heirs he always wanted, so AI Harry hypnotized Norman and Mary Jane Watson with the help of Mysterio and the Chameleon, while Mendel Stromm created the mutated twins in a lab (this explains their rapid aging, as it&#x27;s not truly related to Osborn&#x27;s Goblin serum). Thus, this is all an elaborate scheme of Harry&#x27;s to torment both his father and Peter.

===&quot;Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy&quot;===

In the &quot;Clone Conspiracy&quot; storyline, a flashback revealed that Gwen Stacy was conscious during Spider-Man and Green Goblin&#x27;s battle on the bridge, and as she was falling to her death. She overheard their conversation and discovered Peter is Spider-Man in the process. She was angry at Peter for keeping this secret and for his involvement in her father&#x27;s death. This flashback confirms the Green Goblin&#x27;s real motivations for the murder: he clearly states that Gwen &quot;is just a pawn&quot;, contradicting the whole core of &quot;Sins Past&quot; in which Osborn wanted to kill her to keep the twins with him and silence her forever. The &quot;Stacy-Osborn&quot; affair was retconned during the &quot;Sinister War&quot; event, 17 years later.

In the present, Gwen is revived by the Jackal in a clone body. The Jackal offers Gwen the opportunity to be his business partner as he tries to change the world with his new technology. Gwen is hesitant about this new life at first but accepts it when the Jackal shows that he has reanimated her father, who is in much better health than he was before he died. When Spider-Man arrives at the incorporation and discovers the Jackal&#x27;s experiments, he is surprised by Gwen&#x27;s presence and notes that unlike the other people the Jackal revived, who were all clones, Gwen does not trigger his spider sense, making him wonder if she was the real one. He is attacked by the &quot;reborn&quot; Doctor Octopus before he can question the issue further.

After the Jackal breaks up the fight and shows Spider-Man around the New U, George Stacy recognizes something off about Gwen&#x27;s face and points his gun at her. It is revealed that this Gwen was actually her Earth-65 counterpart Spider-Woman who assists Spider-Man in escaping. The real Gwen is kidnapped by Kaine and taken to Parker Industries to be studied. Kaine reveals that he and Spider-Woman came to this Earth to assist Spider-Man because they saw that Spider-Man agreeing with the Jackal&#x27;s offer on other worlds always results in a global disaster. Rhino and the second Electro are sent to retrieve Gwen after attacking the staff, but Gwen tells them to take Kaine with him too because his condition could help with Jackal&#x27;s experiments. Anna Maria Marconi also volunteers to come with because she has studied both Kaine and the drug.

When Spider-Man is taken to Haven, he catches up with Gwen in the household in the facility, where she tries to convince him to support New U Technologies. Peter still has a hard time believing she is the real Gwen given his other experiences with clones. Gwen tries justifying her existence by telling Peter her memories, including how she overheard the Green Goblin talking to Spider-Man before her death. Peter thinks she died hating him, but Gwen said that she did not hate him, but rather died feeling betrayed. Peter again still has doubts towards Gwen not being a clone. She tries kissing him, to no avail which only pushes him to put the mask back on. Gwen witnesses Jackal order his cloned villains to kill Spider-Man and decides to help Peter.

Doctor Octopus pulls a switch that activates the Carrion Virus in all of the revived, including Gwen and George, and causes them to start rapidly decaying. After Gwen&#x27;s father deteriorates in her arms, she assists Spider-Man by helping him get to the lab. When the cloned villains get to the lab doors, Gwen locks Spider-Man inside the lab and sacrifices herself to give him more time. Following the Carrion Virus being thwarted, Spider-Man and Anna check the building and see that Gwen has been reduced to dust. In the sequel ongoing series &quot;Ben Reilly: The Scarlet Spider&quot;, the embodiment of Death herself confirms that all clones Ben created of deceased people had their souls intact on being brought back, while clones of living people (like Ben himself) had unique souls of their own, making Gwen&#x27;s revival by him a legitimate resurrection.

During the &quot;Last Remains&quot; storyline, Kindred visits the cemetery where Gwen Stacy and George Stacy were buried. He exhumed their bodies and placed them around the table at his hideout while awaiting for Spider-Man to find him. When Spider-Man finally confronts Kindred, Gwen and George&#x27;s corpses were sat around a dinner table alongside the exhumed bodies of Ben Parker, Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson Sr., Jean DeWolff, and Marla Jameson.

===&quot;A.X.E. Judgment Day&quot;===
In the &quot;Judgment Day&quot; crossover event, the Celestial known as the Progenitor is resurrected and gives humanity 24 hours to justify their existence and judges each human individually. The Progenitor appears to Peter in the form of Gwen, who watches him as he spends the day helping his friends and loved ones. When he shows visible discomfort over Peter working for Norman Osborn, Peter tells him he has a responsibility to help Norman and keep him from becoming the Green Goblin again. The Progenitor deems Peter as worthy and rewards him by briefly resurrecting the real Gwen to give them one last moment together. Norman witnesses their reunion but brushes it aside as it is revealed the Progenitor also appeared to him as Gwen.

===Return===
Gwen Stacy is set to make her official return to Marvel Comics in the &quot;Gwenpool&quot; series beginning May 2025. When Gwen is resurrected as a hyper-violent vigilante under the name Gwenpool with powers similar to those of Weapon X, Gwen Poole and Peter Parker team up to figure out who revived her, and how to stop her.

==Other versions==
===&quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;===

In the two-issue mini-series &quot;X-Universe&quot;, which details what happened to the rest of the Marvel Universe during the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; storyline, the Green Goblin never killed Gwen Stacy. Instead, she became the bodyguard of Donald Blake, who, in this reality, had never become the Mighty Thor. Sometime later in the mainstream universe in X-Man #37, the Age of Apocalypse version of Gwen is pulled from her reality to the mainstream Earth&#x27;s George Washington Bridge, much to Spider-Man&#x27;s shock.

===Earth-617===
The Gwen Stacy of this reality had a similar history to the main iteration of the character, until she encountered a Gwen Stacy from a future alternate timeline. At first, thinking that this Gwen was a clone, she later learned that this Gwen was actually a superhero, but when trying to get more information, Spider-Gwen fled in a rage. She learned that Spider-Gwen&#x27;s father had been put in a coma, which caused her rage, then Gwen helped her counterpart to come to epiphany that she should treasure that she still has her father alive in contrast to her, whose father had died. After that, Gwen with the help of Tony Stark and Hank Pym of this reality, successfully send Spider-Gwen to her timeline. After this encounter, Gwen was inspired to become a detective and bonded to the Venom symbiote of her reality to become Spider-Woman. With the use of a Dimensional Travel Watch, she was able to travel across the multiverse and encountered other versions of herself; some of which who had also become Spider-Woman. With these Spider-Women, they formed the Council of Spider-Women and they avoided the &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; event. She then came across the Spider-Gwen from the past and sent her to her past timeline, creating a time-loop. She then terrorized the Uatus from Earth-65 and Earth-8, since they were fighting the children of Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy. After that, she returned to her reality to fight crime.

===&quot;Heroes Reborn&quot;===
In the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; event, a change in the timeline results in a continuity in which the Squadron Supreme are Earth&#x27;s mightiest heroes while the Avengers never came to be. In this reality, Gwen was inspired by her mother to become a psychiatrist at Ravencroft Asylum. After the death of the Falcon (which mirrors how Gwen died in the main continuity), she was trained by Nighthawk and became the vigilante known as Nightbird. She briefly dated Flash Thompson for a time, but her refusal to be with him drove him to be insane and become the second Jackal. She also appears to have a close relationship with Misty Knight.

===&quot;House of M&quot;===

In the reality seen in the &quot;House of M&quot; storyline, in which the Scarlet Witch alters reality to make mutants the ruling class over humans, Gwen was never killed. Instead, she married Peter Parker, and the couple had a young son. She had become a scientist, a savvy businesswoman, and a peace activist – and had a decidedly hostile relationship with chemical weapon developer Norman Osborn. Mary Jane Watson, a popular actress in this reality, played Gwen Stacy in the film adaptation of Spider-Man&#x27;s life story. Gwen and her father read textual accounts of their deaths in the main universe, though they believe this simply to be the morbid imaginings of Peter Parker, who is suffering from mental health issues.

===&quot;Marvel Adventures&quot;===
Gwen Stacy first appeared in &quot;Marvel Adventures Spider-Man&quot; #53 as a new student of Midtown High. She had transferred from her previous school after the Torino Gang, a powerful New York mob, began harassing her in an attempt to keep her father, police captain George Stacy, from arresting members of their gang. However, the Torinos continued to harass Gwen at Midtown, prompting Spider-Man to help the police take down the gang. Like her father, Gwen believes Spider-Man is a hero. She subsequently began participating in a &quot;Spider-Man Appreciation Society&quot; designed to foster better public opinion of Spider-Man. Gwen is also attracted to Spider-Man&#x27;s alter ego Peter Parker; although she openly flirted with him, Peter began dating a different girl, Sophia &quot;Chat&quot; Sanduval, which made Gwen very unhappy. Later, Gwen was brainwashed by Emma Frost into believing &quot;she&quot; was dating Peter. Gwen&#x27;s brainwashing wore off (or was undone by Emma), but Gwen now believes her relationship with Peter ended when he chose Chat over her, causing her to treat Chat very coldly. She has since warmed to Chat, however. Recently, Gwen began a close friendship with Carter Torino who is the grandson of the head of the Torino Gang. Their relationship is complicated by the fact Gwen&#x27;s father is still trying to take down Carter&#x27;s criminal family.

===&quot;Marvel Zombies Return&quot;===
In the limited series, &quot;Marvel Zombies Return&quot;, Gwen of &#x27;Earth Z&#x27; is still a college student out with her friends Mary Jane and Harry Osborn. The zombified Spider-Man travels to this earth and, despite his best intentions, turns the Sinister Six. They then slay and partly consume Gwen and her friends. To stop the spread of the virus, Spider-Man obliterates the bodies.

===&quot;Powerless&quot;===
In the &quot;Powerless&quot; mini-series, Gwen Stacy again appears as the girlfriend of Peter Parker. Norman Osborn again kidnaps and attempts to kill her as a part of a plan to intimidate Peter. In a twist, the powerless Peter (with a limb crippled from a spider bite) manages to save Gwen from falling to her death.

===&quot;Secret Wars&quot;===
In &quot;Secret Wars: Battleworld&quot; #3, a version of Gwen with the powers of Wolverine called Gwenverine, was brought along with the other Wolverines by Mojo, into fighting the pacifist Monk Wolverine.

===&quot;Spider-Geddon&quot;===
During the return of the Inheritors, Spider-Gwen&#x27;s device to travel through the multiverse got destroyed by Verna and then Gwen got stranded in an alternate universe. In this universe, Peter Parker and this universe&#x27;s Gwen Stacy got jobs at Oscorp and Peter wanted to create a cure for cancer after his Uncle Ben died from it. Peter was experimenting with spider venom to create the cure, but one of the spiders bit Harry Osborn, making Harry this universe&#x27;s Spider-Man. Harry, alongside Gwen Stacy as this universe&#x27;s Green Goblin, started to fight crime together, where they even took down Vulture. This lasted until a fight with the Sandman where both Harry and George Stacy were killed. The accident did something to the circuitry that enabled Gwen to control the Goblin Glider that left her mostly acting like the Green Goblin, with no memory of being Gwen Stacy. Spider-Gwen is eventually able to free her counterpart from her insanity. To thank her, the Goblin Gwen fixes Spider-Gwen&#x27;s multiversal travel device to allow her to return to her allies.

===&quot;Spider-Gwen&quot;===

In the alternate reality designated Earth-65, Gwen Stacy is the one bitten by the radioactive spider, and becomes a superhero going by the name of Spider-Woman. She is also a member of a band fronted by Mary Jane Watson, simply called the Mary Janes. Shortly after Gwen begins fighting crime, Peter Parker, her best friend attempts to exact revenge on those who bullied him, becoming this universe&#x27;s version of the Lizard. Gwen subdues him, but Peter dies towards the end of the battle due to the chemical he used. Spider-Woman is blamed for his death, causing an outcry for her arrest, led by J. Jonah Jameson. Her father, who is also a police chief in this world, begins a hunt for her. This follows Gwen into college, where she is still a member of the Mary Janes. At a gig of theirs, an assassin is sent after Gwen&#x27;s father, who is in the audience. Gwen defeats the assassin, the audience and band clearing out during the battle. While they are alone, Captain Stacy holds Spider-Woman at gun point, with Gwen taking off her mask to reveal who she is. Shocked upon learning Spider-Woman&#x27;s identity, he tells her to run before he changes his mind. In the distance, the Captain Britain from Earth-833, called Spider-UK, is watching, saying that Gwen will &quot;do quite nicely&quot;.

Gwen is recruited by Spider-UK to team up with other Spider-Totems across the multiverse, and next appears on Earth-616 with Old Man Spider-Man of Earth-4 and Spider-Man of Earth-70105 (who in that reality is Bruce Banner) to rescue Kaine, who was under attack by the Inheritors. Marvel-616 Peter is hesitant to put Gwen in action and she is told by the others of how he failed to save her in his world. However he does recruit her for a mission and they both agree to look out for each other. Gwen is sent to recruit an alternate version of Peter Parker who is driven insane after he failed to save the Gwen Stacy in his dimension, killed the Green Goblin, and became the Hobgoblin. She tells him that he can become the man he once was if he joins them, but they are attacked by the Inheritors. Hobgoblin sacrifices himself to save Gwen.

After the events of &quot;Spider-Verse&quot;, Gwen returns to her home of Earth-65 where she continues her career as Spider-Woman in her own solo series, &quot;Spider-Gwen&quot;. She first saves George Stacy from mercenary Aleksei Sytsevich who was sent by Wilson Fisk and his lawyer Matt Murdock to target him; Murdock is ultimately revealed to be the real Kingpin, with Fisk serving as his patsy. Then she begins a hunt for the Vulture who has been terrorizing the city in her absence.

She appears as one of the main characters in the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; event with Spider-Ham, Spider-Girl, Spider-UK, Spider-Man Noir, and Spider-Man India in a Battleworld called Archania ruled by Norman Osborn. They eventually form a team called the Web Warriors where they help other Spider-Men and Women in various dimensions. A child version of her also appears in &quot;Giant Size Little Marvel Avengers vs X-Men&quot; as a new kid that Tony Stark tries to ask out on a date. She rejects him because he&#x27;s a kid with a goatee and mustache. Another version of her is a member of Arcadia&#x27;s&#x27;s A-Force. On Earth-8, she is married to Miles Morales and they have two children with Spider Powers.

===&quot;Spider-Punk&quot;===
In &quot;Web Warriors&quot;, Spider-Punk mentions that the Gwen Stacy in his dimension was a musical icon, who ultimately died young.

===&quot;Spider-Man: Fairy Tales&quot;===
Issue #1 of &quot;Spider-Man: Fairy Tales&quot; follows the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood, reimagined with Mary Jane Watson as the titular character. Gwen Stacy has been previously killed by the wolf. Issue #4 is an adaption of Cinderella with Gwen as Princess Gwendolyn. She falls in love with the masked &quot;Prince of Arachne&quot; who is revealed to be Peter Parker, servant to Sir Osborn, but is killed during a fight between Osborn and Parker.

===&quot;Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane&quot;===
Gwen Stacy first appears at the end of &quot;Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane&quot; #5. She is the new girl at school and quickly becomes close friends with Peter Parker. In &quot;Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane&quot; #9, Peter and Gwen take their relationship to the next level by sharing a tender kiss, much to the dismay of Mary Jane. They date for a time, though Gwen breaks up with Peter when she learns Mary Jane is the girl he claims he truly loves. MJ, attempting to fix this, breaks up with Peter and reunites with Harry, though eventually she and Peter realize that neither of them are as happy with Gwen and Harry as they were with each other, and break up with them to start dating each other again.

===&quot;Spider-Man: Life Story&quot;===
&quot;Spider-Man: Life Story&quot; features an alternate continuity where the characters naturally age after Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man in 1962. In 1966, Gwen discovers that Peter is Spider-Man when she sees his costume underneath Peter&#x27;s shirt at the train station shortly after Flash was deployed to Vietnam. She eventually marries Peter and becomes Chief Biologist for Miles Warren&#x27;s bio-engineering company. In 1977, Harry Osborn&#x27;s attack on Warren&#x27;s company as the Black Goblin revealed that Miles created clones of Norman Osborn, Peter, and Gwen. Harry blows up the containment tubes containing the clones which kills all of them except for Peter&#x27;s clone. However, Miles reveals that the &quot;Gwen&quot; Peter was with was actually her clone; he abducted the real Gwen with the intention of attempting to win her over later, with the result that the real Gwen died in the explosion. A year later, Peter and Gwen&#x27;s clones rename themselves as Ben and Helen Parker and move out of New York for a second chance at life, the clone&#x27;s relationship with the original Peter apparently not surviving the revelation of her clone status.

She and Ben eventually split up and she renamed herself Helen Carroll. After years of therapy, she was inspired to become a prison therapist to help those whose lives were ruined by super heroes and worked closely with Norman Osborn and J. Jonah Jameson.

===&quot;Spider-Man Unlimited&quot;===

In the fourth issue of the comic book based on the &quot;Spider-Man Unlimited&quot; animated series, Spidey encounters a Counter-Earth version of Gwen Stacy. She helps him escape a hidden paradise known as &quot;The Haven&quot;.

===Ultimate Marvel===
Gwen Stacy first appears in the Ultimate Marvel universe in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #15 (January 2002) as a teenage girl at Peter&#x27;s high school. In this continuity, Gwen, whose rendition by artist Mark Bagley was inspired by an early-career Madonna, has amber eyes, wears punk-style clothing, and harbors a rebellious personality. In her first appearance, she gives a rousing speech on &#x27;super powers&#x27; and later pulls a knife on Kong, one of Peter&#x27;s bullies, and is suspended from school temporarily. Gwen becomes friends with Peter, which leads Mary Jane Watson to believe she is vying for his affections.

Gwen is later taken in by Aunt May after her father, police captain John Stacy, is killed by a burglar wearing a Spider-Man costume and her estranged mother does not want to take her in. Her living in the Parker house creates more tension between Peter and Mary Jane, and leads to their temporary break-up. Peter&#x27;s relationship with Gwen is further complicated by her hatred of Spider-Man, whom she blames for her father&#x27;s death. When Peter finds his friend Eddie Brock, Gwen confides in him about her feelings of isolation. Eddie then tries to kiss her and Gwen is shocked. When she eventually learns Peter is Spider-Man, the angry Gwen pulls her father&#x27;s gun on him. He manages to convince her he is not to blame for her father&#x27;s death. Gwen runs off but returns, explaining she is just really mad at everything at the moment. She wouldn&#x27;t have really shot him, a fact Peter already knew because his spider sense didn&#x27;t go off despite Gwen&#x27;s wrath. Gwen then agrees to keep his secret.

Gwen Stacy dies in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #62. Before her death, she made peace with Mary Jane and assured her she never had romantic feelings for Peter. She considered him just as a friend. She is killed by Carnage, a symbiote which was the offspring of the Venom symbiote, as he sucks the essence from her, draining her body to a husk. Although Peter is not in the area when she dies, he still feels some responsibility for her death, as he allowed Dr. Connors to use his genetic material for experimentation. His guilt makes him decide to retire as Spider-Man for a while. Eventually, he takes up his hero identity when his responsibility for the innocent becomes too great to overlook. At the end of the arc, there was an issue that dealt with Gwen&#x27;s death. Flash Thompson makes an off-color remark about Gwen&#x27;s passing. It infuriates MJ to the point where she physically attacks Flash. It is revealed Flash had a crush on Gwen all along.

Gwen Stacy returns to life in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man #98&quot;. According to Mark Bagley, &quot;Gwen’s return is integral to the Clone storyline and is basically a way to rock Peter&#x27;s world...again&quot;. In this issue, Gwen appears to have no memory of her &quot;death&quot; and believes she was in a hospital, from which she has escaped. In issue #100, after a raft of revelations, the stress of the situation enrages &quot;Gwen&quot;. She transforms into Carnage before leaping out the window. In the next issue, &quot;Richard Parker&quot; claims Gwen should not have met Peter at all, and was merely an experiment in stem cell research. This Gwen/Carnage fights with the Fantastic Four, Nick Fury, and the Spider-Slayer drones, until she is knocked unconscious by a beam of light, and taken into custody. In issue #113, Norman Osborn as the Green Goblin causes a massive prison break from the Triskelion, with Gwen walking out amidst the chaos, disappearing in the shadows. It was then revealed that during government experiments to regrow the Carnage symbiote from its remains, Gwen&#x27;s consciousness (still alive inside of Carnage) had assumed control over the symbiote to reconstitute her body, with no knowledge of her death.

During the &quot;War of the Symbiotes&quot; storyline, Gwen/Carnage&#x27;s back story in the Triskelion is revealed. It is shown Gwen has been taking some form of therapy with Tony Stark. However, when the Green Goblin broke out of the Triskelion, Gwen escaped and went to Peter Parker&#x27;s house in a confused and terrified state, with Carnage&#x27;s face on her body. During an exchange between Peter and Gwen, Eddie Brock attempts to attack Aunt May and retake his symbiote. In a rage, Spider-Man engages Venom on a nearby rooftop. During the fight, Gwen is shown to be able to use her symbiote to fight off Eddie but Eddie reabsorbs his symbiote along with the Carnage symbiote rendering Gwen Stacy an average girl. After a series of tests, it is concluded that Gwen is not a clone but consciously and genetically is the original reborn (though Gwen&#x27;s original body died, the Carnage symbiote absorbed her being and they had bonded since her original death) with her eyes turned blue (originally, they were hazel). After S.H.I.E.L.D. intervenes, S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Danvers states Gwen will remain in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. Peter and May argue for her to come back to live with them, with Tony Stark supporting the Parkers. In &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #129, the Parkers are now helping to rebuild Gwen&#x27;s life. Her ghastly experience with the Carnage symbiote also causes her to develop a death anxiety she gradually controls. Six months after the &quot;Ultimatum&quot; storyline, in &quot;Ultimate Comics Spider-Man&quot; #1, Gwen is living with the Parkers again and is dating Peter after MJ broke up with him. However, circumstances involving the Chameleon made Gwen realize that Peter and MJ are still in love, and believes that they shouldn&#x27;t be together, even if she wants to be with him. She breaks up with him, but vows to be his loyal friend. She also continues to live with the Parkers due to Gwen and Aunt May having become close in a surrogate mother-daughter fashion.

After Peter&#x27;s death, Gwen and May re-locate to France but return to New York after hearing about the re-emergence of a new Spider-Man, Miles Morales.

During the &quot;Spider-Men&quot; storyline, Gwen and Aunt May meet the Peter Parker of the Earth-616 continuity after he is accidentally and briefly sent to the Ultimate universe. They even attack him, as they believe he is trying to imposter their Peter. It is only through his mannerisms similar to Peter and his choice of words that they believe that he is not an imposter. Gwen, being intrigued to learn about her counterpart (although she is not informed of her other self&#x27;s death, not does she inform him of her own previous death and resurrection), talks with him. Later, she also tries to tell Mary Jane about the other Peter&#x27;s arrival in their world, as the two have formed a friendship.

When Green Goblin escapes custody after S.H.I.E.L.D. was shut down, he arrives at the front yard of Aunt May&#x27;s house and confronts Miles. Gwen and Aunt May are inside watching the television where the battle of Miles and Green Goblin was being broadcast. Soon, Peter emerges to aid Miles in the fight, to the surprise of Gwen and Aunt May. Green Goblin flees at his arrival and the two Spider-Men depart. Gwen is unsure of the identity of the original Spider-Man, but Aunt May assures her that his motives show that it is him. Later, Gwen and Aunt May walk over to Mary Jane&#x27;s house and overhear Peter&#x27;s explanation of his unknown resurrection. Gwen sprints over and joyfully reunites with him. After the two Spider-Men defeat Green Goblin, Peter tells Gwen that he intends to go on a quest to find out the truth of his mystery resurrection and leaves her and Aunt May once more, promising to return.

The Ultimate Universe is destroyed in the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; event, but the world is restored later on. In it, Peter returns to the role of Spider-Man and Gwen is possibly still living with Aunt May.

Early in the series, &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man #25&quot; (October 2002) paid homage to Gwen Stacy&#x27;s death in the Earth-616 continuity, although Gwen herself was not involved. The Green Goblin tossed Mary Jane off the Queensboro Bridge. Spider-Man caught her leg with his webbing, just as with Gwen. The issue ended with a cliffhanger: when Spider-Man pulled Mary Jane up, she appeared to be either unconscious or dead. The cliffhanger was resolved in the next issue when Mary Jane awoke in #26, uninjured.

===Ultimate Universe===
An alternate universe variant of Gwen Stacy from Earth-6160 appears in the &quot;Ultimate Universe&quot; imprint. This version is the wife of Harry Osborn. After Norman and Emily Osborn are killed in a false flag attack orchestrated by the Maker&#x27;s Council, Gwen and Harry become the sole inheritors of Oscorp.

===What If===
Gwen Stacy has been featured in numerous &quot;What If&quot; stories:

* In &quot;What if Gwen Stacy had lived?&quot;, Peter saves Gwen by jumping after her rather than catching her with a web-line. In doing this, he cushions her from the impact as they hit the water and subsequently gives her CPR. After regaining consciousness, Gwen sees him without his mask. After explaining himself to her, Peter proposes to Gwen, and she accepts. Meanwhile, the Green Goblin mails to J. Jonah Jameson proof of Spider-Man&#x27;s real identity. On the day of Peter&#x27;s wedding to Gwen, Jonah has published the expose and uses it to acquire a warrant for Peter&#x27;s arrest. Peter escapes from the police moments after his wedding to Gwen, but the issue ends with Peter on the run from the law and pondering his uncertain future. As the issue ends, Gwen departs with Robbie Robertson, who promises Gwen they will do whatever they can to help Peter and quits the &quot;Bugle&quot;.
* In &quot;What If Spider-Man Had Kept His Six Arms?&quot;, Spider-Man (whose six-arms mutation was permanent here) is able to prevent Gwen Stacy&#x27;s death.
* At the very end of Peter David&#x27;s one-shot &quot;What If: The Other&quot;, Peter Parker (now calling himself &quot;Poison&quot;) uses part of the Venom symbiote attached to him to resurrect Gwen Stacy. She takes the appearance of Carnage.
* In &quot;What if Peter Parker became the Punisher?&quot;, Peter (who is the Punisher in this continuity) is able to save Gwen by killing the Green Goblin and webbing her body to a suspended scaffold on the bridge. Feeling guilty over almost getting her killed, he quits being the Punisher to be with her.
* In &quot;What If...Dark?: Spider-Gwen&quot; #1, Peter saves Gwen by jumping after her, but is killed when the Green Goblin cuts his web line and causes him to break his neck on a bridge pillar before his body cushions Gwen&#x27;s fall. Upon discovering his secret, Gwen protects Peter&#x27;s identity by discarding his costume and claiming Goblin took them both hostage at random. She subsequently dons Spider-Man&#x27;s spare costume and vows revenge against the Goblin. She works together with Harry to trap the villain, but refuses to kill him as she realizes doing so would not be what Peter wanted. Harry does choose to kill him, but is horrified when he discovers the Goblin was his father. Blaming Gwen for Norman&#x27;s death, Harry becomes the new Green Goblin while Gwen promises Peter she&#x27;ll resolve her mistakes as the new Spider-Woman despite being powerless.

==In other media==

===Television===
* Gwen Stacy was deliberately excluded from &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1994) as the creators felt they could neither allow her to live nor include a character who was going to die, leading to Felicia Hardy filling her role as Peter Parker&#x27;s first love interest prior to Mary Jane&#x27;s introduction. Despite this, an alternate universe version of Stacy appears in the two-part series finale &quot;Spider Wars&quot;, voiced by Mary Kay Bergman. This version is the fiancée of an alternate universe version of Spider-Man who became a rich industrialist.
* Gwen Stacy appears in &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;, voiced by Lacey Chabert. This version is a teenager and friend of Peter Parker and Harry Osborn who has hidden romantic feelings for the former, expressing hurt whenever he expresses interest in other girls. Throughout the first season, she becomes concerned when Harry becomes addicted to the drug Gobulin Green and kisses Parker, leaving them in an awkward standing in the second season. Despite their feelings for each other, Parker begins dating Liz Allan while Stacy dates Harry. In the series finale, she and Parker acknowledge their feelings for each other and agree to break up with Harry and Allan. Following Norman Osborn&#x27;s apparent death however, Stacy stays with Harry to care for him.
* Spider-Gwen appears in the &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; episode &quot;Return to the Spider-Verse&quot; Pt. 4, voiced by Dove Cameron. After Miles Morales vanished from her universe, Gwen Stacy allied with her universe&#x27;s May Parker to become Spider-Woman and reign in the chaos that befell her city using technology to mimic Morales&#x27; spider powers. Morales later returns with the &quot;prime&quot; version of Peter Parker and join forces with Gwen to defeat Wolf Spider. She is later chosen by Morales to replace him as a spider-hero as he and his family move to Parker&#x27;s universe.
* Spider-Gwen / Ghost-Spider appears in &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2017), voiced by Laura Bailey. This version is one of Peter Parker&#x27;s classmates at Horizon High, as well as best friends with Anya Corazon, who specializes in DNA formulas after she was inspired by her uncle Raymond Warren to pursue science. Later in the series, she develops spider powers after being exposed to Warren&#x27;s chemicals, with admirers referring to her as &quot;Spider-Gwen&quot; after adopting her comic book costume sans mask. Though she temporarily loses her powers, she later regains them and adopts the Ghost-Spider alias after adding a mask to her costume.
* Spider-Gwen appears in &quot;Marvel Super Hero Adventures&quot;, voiced by Emily Tennant.
* Ghost-Spider appears in the &quot;Marvel Rising&quot; franchise, voiced again by Dove Cameron. While this version is primarily based on Stacy, she uses an alias that originated in the comics as a Ghost Rider variant of Spider-Man and has the partially dyed pink hair of Gwenpool in her civilian identity. This redesign was cited by a &quot;Marvel Rising&quot; character designer, who mistook an image of Gwenpool by Gurihiru for Gwen Stacy while using Google Images to reference the former character&#x27;s physical appearance during the series&#x27; development. The &quot;Ghost-Spider&quot; alias was later integrated into Marvel Comics and related animated Spider-Man media to distinguish the character from other Spider-Women.
** Stacy first appears in the &quot;Initiation&quot; shorts, in which she goes on the run from the police after she is blamed for the death of her Inhuman friend, Kevin. Eventually, S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Daisy Johnson finds similar reports of the suspect in question and gives the information to Ghost-Spider.
** Ghost-Spider returns in the TV special &quot;Chasing Ghosts&quot;, in which she tracks down Sheath, an Inhuman who killed Kevin, and works with the Secret Warriors to stop her before eventually joining the team.
* Ghost-Spider appears in &quot;Lego Marvel Spider-Man: Vexed by Venom&quot;, voiced again by Laura Bailey. This version&#x27;s design and portrayal is a combination of her counterparts from &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Marvel Rising&quot;.
* Ghost-Spider appears in &quot;Spidey and His Amazing Friends&quot;, voiced initially by Lily Sanfelippo and by Audrey Bennett from the third season onward. Like the &quot;Marvel Rising&quot; incarnation, this version has Gwenpool&#x27;s partially dyed pink highlights.
* Gwen Stacy as Ghost-Spider appears in &quot;Lego Marvel Avengers: Mission Demolition&quot;, voiced again by Lily Sanfelippo.
* Gwen Stacy as Spider-Gwen will appear in the upcoming second season of &quot;Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man&quot;.

===Film===
====Sam Raimi series====
* A student in Peter Parker&#x27;s university class from &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, portrayed by an uncredited extra, is identified as Gwen Stacy in the film&#x27;s novelization.
* Gwen Stacy appears in &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;, portrayed by Bryce Dallas Howard. This version is a model, classmate, and lab partner of Peter&#x27;s, and Eddie Brock&#x27;s ex-girlfriend. After Spider-Man rescues Gwen, he urges her to kiss him during a public ceremony, upsetting his girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson. After breaking up with Eddie, Gwen goes on a date with a symbiote-influenced Peter, only to realize he was trying to make Watson jealous. Upset, Gwen apologizes to Mary Jane and leaves Peter. Later, Eddie becomes Venom and targets Parker in revenge for ruining his life.
* Howard has stated she would love to be a part of any continuation of the film franchise, while acknowledging her character&#x27;s opportunity may have passed, especially after &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; ended with Parker and Watson once again in each other&#x27;s arms. In May 2007, actor James Cromwell, who played, Captain Stacy in the film, stated he thought the natural progression for the character would be for both to die early in &quot;Spider-Man 4&quot;, mirroring the comics, with Howard adding that it would not have bothered her. Due to a reboot however, the film was cancelled, although Stacy was left in the draft.

====Marc Webb series====

* Emma Stone portrays Gwen Stacy in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; and its sequel &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot;. This version serves as Peter Parker&#x27;s love interest, classmate, and character foil. Additionally, she works at Oscorp as an assistant to Dr. Curt Connors. After falling in love in the first film, the second film sees Parker and Stacy going through an on-and-off relationship before she is killed by the Green Goblin.
* In an interview with &quot;Screen Rant&quot;, Stone expressed interest in returning as a resurrected Stacy in a future &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; film, despite the character&#x27;s death at the end of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot;. However, by July 2014, development on the follow-up films &quot;Sinister Six&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 3&quot;, and &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 4&quot; had stalled. The films would have seen Stone reprise her role, with the plot following Norman Osborn setting a resurrected amnesiac Stacy as Carnage against Parker, Harry, and the Sinister Six. By early 2015, a deal to reboot the series within the Marvel Cinematic Universe was reached, cancelling &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; franchise.
* In both films, Kari Coleman, Charlie DePew, Skyler Gisondo, and Jacob Rodier portray members of the Stacy family: Gwen&#x27;s mother Helen Stacy and Gwen&#x27;s younger brothers Philip, Howard, and Simon Stacy respectively.

====&quot;Spider-Verse&quot;====

She first appears in &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot; (2018) before returning in &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot; (2023). Additionally, she will appear in the upcoming &quot;Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse&quot; and &quot;Spider-Woman&quot;, a female-centered spin-off film.
* Gayatri Singh, a &quot;Spider-Man: India&quot;-inspired, alternate universe variant of Gwen Stacy and the girlfriend of her universe&#x27;s Spider-Man, appears in &quot;Across the Spider-Verse&quot;, voiced by an uncredited actress.

==Legacy==

Gwen Stacy was an American metalcore band from Indianapolis, Indiana, active between 2004 and 2010, whose name came from the comic book character Gwen Stacy. The band announced a reunion in April 2014.

Due to the popularity of Spider-Gwen, an alternate reality version of Gwen as Spider-Woman introduced in &quot;Edge of Spider-Verse&quot; in September 2014, in June 2015 Marvel published variant covers for 20 of their current series, which saw Gwen Stacy re-imagined as other Marvel characters, such as Doctor Strange, Groot and Wolverine. One of those variants, for &quot;Deadpool&#x27;s Secret Secret Wars&quot; #2, featured an amalgam of the design of Gwen Stacy and Wade Wilson dubbed &quot;Gwenpool&quot;, which came to be especially popular with the fans. As a result, Marvel produced two stories featuring Gwenpool as an original character, a backup story in the series &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;, and a one-shot, &quot;Gwenpool Holiday Special&quot; #1, with &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; #1 establishing that her name is actually &quot;Gwen Poole&quot;, not Gwen Stacy, or even an alternate version of either Gwen Stacy or Wade Wilson, presented as a fangirl from the real world who is transported to the Marvel Universe. Following the publication of the one-shot, an ongoing series titled &quot;The Unbelievable Gwenpool&quot; by the same creative team (Christopher Hastings and Gurihiru) was announced, starting in April 2016, with a webtoon spin-off, &quot;It&#x27;s Jeff!&quot;, premiering in September 2021.
