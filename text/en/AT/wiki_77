<text>Women&#x27;s rights are the rights and entitlements claimed for women and girls worldwide. They formed the basis for the women&#x27;s rights movement in the 19th century and the feminist movements during the 20th and 21st centuries. In some countries, these rights are institutionalized or supported by law, local custom, and behavior, whereas in others, they are ignored and suppressed. They differ from broader notions of human rights through claims of an inherent historical and traditional bias against the exercise of rights by women and girls, in favor of men and boys.

Issues commonly associated with notions of women&#x27;s rights include the right to bodily integrity and autonomy, to be free from sexual violence, to vote, to hold public office, to enter into legal contracts, to have equal rights in family law, to work, to fair wages or equal pay, to have reproductive rights, to own property, and to education.

== History ==
=== Ancient history ===

==== Mesopotamia ====

Women in ancient Sumer could buy, own, sell, and inherit property. They could engage in commerce, and testify in court as witnesses. Nonetheless, their husbands could divorce them for mild infractions, and a divorced husband could easily remarry another woman, provided that his first wife had borne him no offspring. Female deities, such as Inanna, were widely worshipped. The Akkadian poet Enheduanna, the priestess of Inanna, is the earliest known poet whose name has been recorded. 

Old Babylonian law codes permitted a husband to divorce his wife under any circumstances, but doing so required him to return all of her property and sometimes pay her a fine. Most law codes forbade a woman to request her husband for a divorce and enforced the same penalties on a woman asking for divorce as on a woman caught in the act of adultery. Some Babylonian and Assyrian laws, however, afforded women the same right to divorce as men, requiring them to pay the same fine. The majority of East Semitic deities were male.
==== Egypt ====


In ancient Egypt, women enjoyed the same rights under the law as a man, however rightful entitlements depended upon social class. Landed property descended in the female line from mother to daughter, and women were entitled to administer their own property. Women in ancient Egypt could buy, sell, be a partner in legal contracts, be executors in wills and witnesses to legal documents, bring court action, and adopt children.

==== India ====
Women during the early Vedic period enjoyed equal status with men in all aspects of life. Works by ancient Indian grammarians such as Patanjali and Katyayana suggest that women were educated in the early Vedic period. Rigvedic verses suggest that women married at a mature age and were probably free to select their own husbands in a practice called swayamvar or live-in relationship called Gandharva marriage.

==== Greece ====

Although most women lacked political and equal rights in the city states of ancient Greece, they enjoyed a certain freedom of movement until the Archaic age. Records also exist of women in ancient Delphi, Gortyn, Thessaly, Megara, and Sparta owning land, the most prestigious form of private property at the time. However, after the Archaic age, legislators began to enact laws enforcing gender segregation, resulting in decreased rights for women.

Women in Classical Athens had no legal personhood and were assumed to be part of the &quot;oikos&quot; headed by the male &quot;kyrios&quot;. Until marriage, women were under the guardianship of their father or another male relative. Once married, the husband became a woman&#x27;s &quot;kyrios&quot;. As women were barred from conducting legal proceedings, the &quot;kyrios&quot; would do so on their behalf. Athenian women could only acquire rights over property through gifts, dowry, and inheritance, though her &quot;kyrios&quot; had the right to dispose of a woman&#x27;s property. Athenian women could only enter into a contract worth less than the value of a &quot;&quot;medimnos&quot; of barley&quot; (a measure of grain), allowing women to engage in petty trading. Women were excluded from ancient Athenian democracy, both in principle and in practice. Slaves could become Athenian citizens after being freed, but no woman ever acquired citizenship in ancient Athens.

In classical Athens women were also barred from becoming poets, scholars, politicians, or artists. During the Hellenistic period in Athens, the philosopher Aristotle thought that women would bring disorder and evil, therefore it was best to keep women separate from the rest of the society. This separation would entail living in a room called a &quot;gynaikeion&quot;, while looking after the duties in the home and having very little exposure to the male world. This was also to ensure that wives only had legitimate children from their husbands. Athenian women received little education, except home tutorship for basic skills such as spinning, weaving, cooking, and some knowledge of money.

Although Spartan women were formally excluded from military and political life, an extremely small group enjoyed considerable status as mothers of Spartan warriors. As men engaged in military activity, women took responsibility for running estates. Following protracted warfare in the 4th century BC, Spartan women owned approximately between 35% and 40% of all Spartan land and property. By the Hellenistic Period, some of the wealthiest Spartans were women. Spartan women controlled their own properties, as well as the properties of male relatives who were away with the army. But despite relatively greater freedom of movement for Spartan women, their role in politics was the same as Athenian women.

Plato acknowledged that extending civil and political rights to women would substantively alter the nature of the household and the state. Aristotle denied that women were slaves or subject to property, arguing that &quot;nature has distinguished between the female and the slave&quot;, but he considered wives to be &quot;bought&quot;. He argued that women&#x27;s main economic activity is that of safeguarding the household property created by men. According to Aristotle, the labour of women added no value because &quot;the art of household management is not identical with the art of getting wealth, for the one uses the material which the other provides&quot;.

Contrary to Plato&#x27;s views, the Stoic philosophers argued for equality of the sexes, sexual inequality being in their view contrary to the laws of nature. In doing so, they followed the Cynics, who argued that men and women should wear the same clothing and receive the same kind of education. They also saw marriage as a moral companionship between equals rather than a biological or social necessity. The Stoics adopted the views of the Cynics and added them to their own theories of human nature, thus putting their sexual egalitarianism on a strong philosophical basis.

==== Rome ====
Roman law was created by men in favor of men. Women had no public voice and no public role, which only improved after the 1st century to the 6th century BCE. Freeborn women of ancient Rome were citizens who enjoyed legal privileges and protections that did not extend to non-citizens or slaves. Roman society, however, was patriarchal, and women could not vote, hold public office, or serve in the military. Women of the upper classes exercised political influence through marriage and motherhood. During the Roman Republic, the mothers of the Gracchus brothers and of Julius Caesar were noted as exemplary women who advanced the careers of their sons. During the Imperial period, women of the emperor&#x27;s family could acquire considerable political power and were regularly depicted in official art and on coinage.

The central core of Roman society was the &quot;pater familias&quot; or the male head of the household who exercised his authority over all his children, servants, and wife. Girls had equal inheritance rights with boys if their father died without leaving a will. Roman women had a guardian (called &quot;tutor&quot;) who managed and oversaw all her activity. This tutelage had limited female activity but by the first century to sixth century BCE, tutelage became very relaxed and women were accepted to participate in more public roles such as owning and managing property or acting as municipal patrons for gladiator games and other entertainment activities Childbearing was encouraged by the state. By 27–14 BCE the &quot;ius tritium liberorum&quot; (&quot;legal right of three children&quot;) granted symbolic honors and legal privileges to a woman who had given birth to three children and freed her from any male guardianship.

In the earliest period of the Roman Republic, a bride passed from her father&#x27;s control into the &quot;hand&quot; &quot;(manus)&quot; of her husband. She then became subject to her husband&#x27;s &quot;potestas&quot;, though to a lesser degree than their children. This archaic form of &quot;manus&quot; marriage was largely abandoned by the time of Julius Caesar, when a woman remained under her father&#x27;s authority by law even when she moved into her husband&#x27;s home. This arrangement was one of the factors in the independence Roman women enjoyed.

Although women had to answer to their fathers in legal matters, they were free of his direct scrutiny in their daily lives, and their husbands had no legal power over them. When a woman&#x27;s father died, she became legally emancipated &quot;(sui iuris)&quot;. A married woman retained ownership of any property she brought into the marriage. Girls had equal inheritance rights with boys if their father died without leaving a will. Under classical Roman law, a husband had no right to abuse his wife physically or compel her to have sex. Wife beating was sufficient grounds for divorce or other legal action against the husband.

Because of their legal status as citizens and the degree to which they could become emancipated, women in ancient Rome could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business. Some acquired and disposed of sizable fortunes, and are recorded in inscriptions as benefactors in funding major public works. Roman women could appear in court and argue cases, though it was customary for them to be represented by a man. They were simultaneously disparaged as too ignorant and weak-minded to practice law, and as too active and influential in legal matters—resulting in an edict that limited women to conducting cases on their own behalf instead of others&#x27;. But even after this restriction was put in place, there are numerous examples of women taking informed actions in legal matters, including dictating legal strategy to their male advocates.

Roman law recognized rape as a crime in which the victim bore no guilt and a capital crime. The rape of a woman was considered an attack on her family and father&#x27;s honour, and rape victims were shamed for allowing the bad name in her father&#x27;s honour. As a matter of law, rape could be committed only against a citizen in good standing. The rape of a slave could be prosecuted only as damage to her owner&#x27;s property.
The first Roman emperor, Augustus, framed his ascent to sole power as a return to traditional morality, and attempted to regulate the conduct of women through moral legislation. Adultery, which had been a private family matter under the Republic, was criminalized, and defined broadly as an illicit sex act &quot;(stuprum)&quot; that occurred between a male citizen and a married woman, or between a married woman and any man other than her husband. Therefore, a married woman could have sex only with her husband, but a married man did not commit adultery when he had sex with a prostitute, slave, or person of marginalized status &quot;(infamis)&quot;. Most prostitutes in ancient Rome were slaves, though some slaves were protected from forced prostitution by a clause in their sales contract. A free woman who worked as a prostitute or entertainer lost her social standing and became &quot;infamis&quot;, &quot;disreputable&quot;; by making her body publicly available, she had in effect surrendered her right to be protected from sexual abuse or physical violence.

Stoic philosophies influenced the development of Roman law. Stoics of the Imperial era such as Seneca and Musonius Rufus developed theories of just relationships. While not advocating equality in society or under the law, they held that nature gives men and women equal capacity for virtue and equal obligations to act virtuously, and that therefore men and women had an equal need for philosophical education. These philosophical trends among the ruling elite are thought to have helped improve the status of women under the Empire. Rome had no system of state-supported schooling, and education was available only to those who could pay for it. The daughters of senators and knights seem to have regularly received a primary education (for ages 7 to 12). Regardless of gender, few people were educated beyond that level. Girls from a modest background might be schooled in order to help with the family business or to acquire literacy skills that enabled them to work as scribes and secretaries. The woman who achieved the greatest prominence in the ancient world for her learning was Hypatia of Alexandria, who taught advanced courses to young men and advised the Roman prefect of Egypt on politics.

==== Byzantine Empire ====

Since Byzantine law was essentially based on Roman law, the legal status of women did not change significantly from the practices of the 6th century. But the traditional restriction of women in public life as well as the hostility against independent women still continued. Greater influence of Greek culture contributed to strict attitudes about women&#x27;s roles being domestic instead of being public. There was also a growing trend of women who were not prostitutes, slaves or entertainers to be entirely veiled. Like previous Roman law, women could not be legal witnesses, hold administrations or run banking but they could still inherit properties and own land.

As a rule, the influence of the church was exercised in favor of the abolition of the disabilities imposed by the older law upon celibacy and childlessness, of increased facilities for entering a professed religious life, and of due provision for the wife. The church also supported the political power of those who were friendly toward the clergy. The appointment of mothers and grandmothers as tutors was sanctioned by Justinian.

The restrictions on the marriage of senators and other men of high rank with women of low rank were extended by Constantine, but it was almost entirely removed by Justinian. Second marriages were discouraged, especially by making it legal to impose a condition that a widow&#x27;s right to property should cease on remarriage, and the Leonine Constitutions at the end of the 9th century made third marriages punishable. The same constitutions made the benediction of a priest a necessary part of the ceremony of marriage.

==== China ====
Women throughout historical and ancient China were considered inferior and had subordinate legal status based on Confucian law. In Imperial China, the &quot;Three Obediences&quot; promoted daughters to obey their fathers, wives to obey their husbands, and widows to obey their sons. Women could not inherit businesses or wealth and men had to adopt a son for such financial purposes. Late imperial law also featured seven different types of divorces. A wife could be ousted if she failed to birth a son, committed adultery, disobeyed her parents-in-law, spoke excessively, stole, was given to bouts of jealousy, or suffered from an incurable or loathsome disease or disorder. But there were also limits for the husband – for example, he could not divorce if she observed her parents-in-law&#x27;s mourning sites, if she had no family to return to, or if the husband&#x27;s family used to be poor and since then had become richer.

Confucian thinking relegated women in China to subordinate roles and foot binding left them homemakers. About 45% of Chinese women had bound feet in the 19th century. For the upper classes, it was almost 100%. In 1912, the Chinese government ordered the cessation of foot-binding. Foot-binding involved the alteration of the bone structure so that the feet were only about four inches long. The bound feet caused difficulty in movement, thus greatly limiting the activities of women.

Due to the social custom that men and women should not be near each other, the women of China were reluctant to be treated by male doctors of Western Medicine. This resulted in a tremendous need for female doctors of Western Medicine in China. Thus, female medical missionary Mary H. Fulton was sent by the Foreign Missions Board of the Presbyterian Church (USA) to found the first medical college for women in China. Known as the Hackett Medical College for Women (夏葛女子醫學院), the college was aimed at the spreading of Christianity and modern medicine and the elevation of Chinese women&#x27;s social status.

During the Republic of China (1912–49) and earlier Chinese governments, women were legally bought and sold into slavery under the guise of domestic servants. These women were known as Mui Tsai. The lives of Mui Tsai were recorded by American feminist Agnes Smedley in her book &quot;Portraits of Chinese Women in Revolution&quot;.

However, in 1949 the Republic of China was overthrown by communist guerillas led by Mao Zedong, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China was founded in the same year. In May 1950 the People&#x27;s Republic of China enacted the New Marriage Law to tackle the sale of women into slavery. This outlawed marriage by proxy and made marriage legal so long as both partners consent. The New Marriage Law raised the legal age of marriage to 20 for men and 18 for women. This was an essential part of countryside land reform as women could no longer legally be sold to landlords. The official slogan was &quot;Men and women are equal; everyone is worth his (or her) salt&quot;.

==== Religious scriptures ====

===== Bible =====

Both before and during biblical times, the roles of women in society were severely restricted. Nonetheless, in the Bible, women are depicted as having the right to represent themselves in court, the ability to make contracts, and the rights to purchase, own, sell, and inherit property. The Bible guarantees women the right to sex with their husbands and orders husbands to feed and clothe their wives. Breach of these Old Testament rights by a polygamous man gave the woman grounds for divorce.

===== Qur&#x27;an =====

The Qur&#x27;an prescribes limited rights for women in marriage, divorce, and inheritance. By providing that the wife, not her family, would receive a dowry from the husband, which she could administer as her personal property, the Qur&#x27;an made women a legal party to the marriage contract.

While in customary law, inheritance was often limited to male descendants, the Qur&#x27;an included rules on inheritance with certain fixed shares being distributed to designated heirs, first to the nearest female relatives and then the nearest male relatives. According to Annemarie Schimmel &quot;compared to the pre-Islamic position of [Arab] women, Islamic legislation meant an enormous progress; the woman has the right, at least according to the letter of the law, to administer the wealth she has brought into the family or has earned by her own work.&quot;

For Arab women, Islam included the prohibition of female infanticide and recognizing women&#x27;s full personhood. Women generally gained greater rights than women in pre-Islamic Arabia and medieval Europe. Women were not accorded such legal status in other cultures until centuries later. According to Professor William Montgomery Watt, when seen in such a historical context, Muhammad &quot;can be seen as a figure who testified on behalf of women&#x27;s rights.&quot;

==== Western Europe ====
Women&#x27;s rights were protected already by the early Medieval Christian Church: one of the first formal legal provisions for the right of wives was promulgated by council of Adge in 506, which in Canon XVI stipulated that if a young married man wished to be ordained, he required the consent of his wife.

The English Church and culture in the Middle Ages regarded women as weak, irrational, vulnerable to temptation, and constantly needing to be kept in check. This was reflected on the Christian culture in England through the story of Adam and Eve where Eve fell to Satan&#x27;s temptations and led Adam to eat the apple. This belief was based on St. Paul, that the pain of childbirth was a punishment for this deed that led mankind to be banished from the Garden of Eden. Women&#x27;s inferiority also appears in much medieval writing; for example, the 1200 AD theologian Jacques de Vitry (who was rather sympathetic to women over others) emphasized female obedience towards their men and described women as slippery, weak, untrustworthy, devious, deceitful and stubborn. The church also promoted the Virgin Mary as a role model for women to emulate by being innocent in her sexuality, being married to a husband and eventually becoming a mother. That was the core purpose set out both culturally and religiously across Medieval Europe. Rape was also seen in medieval England as a crime against the father or husband and a violation of their protection and guardianship of the women whom they look after in the household. Women&#x27;s identities in the Middle Ages were also referred through their relations with men they associated with, such as &quot;his daughter&quot; or &quot;so and so&#x27;s wife&quot;. Despite all this, the Church still emphasized the importance of love and mutual counselling within marriage and prohibited any form of divorce so the wife would have someone to look after her.

In overall Europe during the Middle Ages, women were inferior to men in legal status. Throughout medieval Europe, women were pressured to not attend courts and leave all legal business affairs to their husbands. In the legal system, women were regarded as the property of men so any threat or injury to them was the duty of their male guardians.

In Irish law, women were forbidden to act as witnesses in courts. In Welsh law, women&#x27;s testimony could be accepted towards other women but not against men, but Welsh laws, specifically The Laws of Hywel Dda, also reflected accountability for men to pay child maintenance for children born out of wedlock, which empowered women to claim rightful payment. In France, women&#x27;s testimony had to corroborate with other accounts or it would not be accepted. Although women were expected to not attend courts, this however was not always true. Sometimes, regardless of expectations, women did participate and attend court cases and court meetings. But women could not act as justices in courts, be attorneys or members of a jury, or accuse another person of a felony unless it was the murder of her husband. For the most part, the best thing a woman could do in medieval courts was to observe the legal proceedings taking place.

Swedish law protected women from the authority of their husbands by transferring the authority to their male relatives. A wife&#x27;s property and land also could not be taken by the husband without her family&#x27;s consent but neither could the wife. This meant a woman could not transfer her property to her husband without her family or kinsman&#x27;s consent either. In Swedish law, a woman would also only get half that of her brother in inheritance. Despite these legal issues, Sweden was largely ahead and much superior in its treatment towards women than most European countries.

Medieval marriages among the elites were arranged in a way that would meet the interests of the family as a whole. Theoretically a woman needed to consent before a marriage took place and the Church encouraged this consent to be expressed in present tense and not future. Marriage could also take place anywhere and the minimum age for girls was 12, while it was 14 for boys.

==== Northern Europe ====

The rate of Wergild suggested that women in these societies were valued mostly for their breeding purposes. The Wergild of woman was double that of a man with the same status in the Aleman and Bavarian legal codes. The Wergild of a woman meanwhile was triple that of a man with the same status in Salic and Repuarian legal codes for women of child-bearing age, which constituted from 12 to 40 years old. One of the most Germanic codes from the Lombard tradition legislated that women be under the control of a male &quot;mundoald&quot;, which constituted her father, husband, older son or eventually the king as a last resort if she had no male relatives. A woman needed her mundold&#x27;s permission to manage property but still could own her own lands and goods. Certain areas with Visigothic inheritance laws until the 7th century were favorable to women while all other laws were not. Before the Christianization of Europe, there was little space for women&#x27;s consent for marriage and marriage through purchase (or &quot;Kaufehe&quot;) was actually the civil norm, as opposed to the alternative marriage through capture (or &quot;Raubehe&quot;). However Christianity was slow to reach other Baltic and Scandinavian areas with it only reaching King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark in the year 950 AD. Those living under Norwegian and Icelandic laws used marriages to forge alliances or create peace, usually without the women&#x27;s say or consent. However divorce rights were permitted to women who suffered physical abuse but protections from harm were not given to those termed &quot;wretched&quot; women such as beggars, servants and slave women. Having sex with them through force or without consent usually had no legal consequence or punishment.

During the Viking Age, women had a relatively free status in the Nordic countries of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, illustrated in the Icelandic Grágás and the Norwegian Frostating laws and Gulating laws.
The paternal aunt, paternal niece and paternal granddaughter, referred to as &quot;odalkvinna&quot;, all had the right to inherit property from a deceased man. In the absence of male relatives, an unmarried woman with no son could, furthermore, inherit not only property, but also the position as head of the family from a deceased father or brother. A woman with such status was referred to as &quot;ringkvinna&quot;, and she exercised all the rights afforded to the head of a family clan, such as the right to demand and receive fines for the slaughter of a family member, unless she married, by which her rights were transferred to her husband.

After the age of 20, an unmarried woman, referred to as &quot;maer&quot; and &quot;mey&quot;, reached legal majority, had the right to decide her place of residence, and was regarded as her own person before the law.
An exception to her independence was the right to choose a marriage partner, as marriages were normally arranged by the clan. Widows enjoyed the same independent status as unmarried women.
Women had religious authority and were active as priestesses (&quot;gydja&quot;) and oracles (&quot;sejdkvinna&quot;); within art as poets (&quot;skalder&quot;) and rune masters; and as merchants and medicine women. They may also have been active within military office: the stories about shieldmaidens are unconfirmed, but some archaeological finds such as the Birka female Viking warrior may indicate that at least some women in military authority existed. A married woman could divorce her husband and remarry.

It was also socially acceptable for a free woman to cohabit with a man and have children with him without marrying him, even if that man was married; a woman in such a position was called &quot;frilla&quot;. There was no distinction made between children born inside or outside of marriage: both had the right to inherit property after their parents, and there were no &quot;legitimate&quot; or &quot;illegitimate&quot; children.
These liberties gradually disappeared after the introduction of Christianity, and from the late 13th century, they are no longer mentioned. During the Christian Middle Ages, the Medieval Scandinavian law applied different laws depending on the local county law, signifying that the status of women could vary depending on which county she was living in.

=== Modern history ===

==== Europe ====

===== 16th and 17th century Europe =====

The 16th and 17th centuries saw numerous witch trials, which resulted in thousands of people across Europe being executed, of whom 75–95% were women (depending on time and place). The executions mostly took place in German-speaking lands, and during the 15th century the terminology &quot;witchcraft&quot; was definitely viewed as something feminine as opposed to prior years. Famous witchcraft manuals such as the &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; and &quot;Summis Desiderantes&quot; depicted witches as diabolical conspirators who worshipped Satan and were primarily women. Culture and art at the time depicted these witches as seductive and evil, further fuelling moral panic in fusion with rhetoric from the Church.

The origin of the female &quot;witch&quot; myth traces back to Roman mythical night creatures known as Strix, who were thought to appear and disappear mysteriously in the night. They were also believed by many to be of transformed women by their own supernatural powers. This Roman myth itself is believed to originate from the Jewish Sabbath which described non-supernatural women who would suspiciously leave and return home swiftly during the night. Authors of the &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; strongly established the link between witchcraft and women by proclaiming a greater likelihood for women to be addicted to &quot;evil&quot;. The authors and inquisitors Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprengerh justified these beliefs by claiming women had greater credulity, impressionability, feeble minds, feeble bodies, impulsivity and carnal natures which were flaws susceptible to &quot;evil&quot; behavior and witchcraft. These sorts of beliefs at the time could send female hermits or beggars to trials just for offering remedies or herbal medicine. This set of developed myths eventually lead to the 16–17th century witch trials which found thousands of women burned at the stake.

By 1500, Europe was divided into two types of secular law. One was customary law, which was predominant in northern France, England and Scandinavia, and the other was Roman-based written law, which was predominant in southern France, Italy, Spain and Portugal.

Customary laws favoured men more than women. For example, inheritance among the elites in Italy, England, Scandinavia and France was passed on to the eldest male heir. In all of the regions, the laws also gave men substantial powers over the lives, property and bodies of their wives. However, there were some improvements for women as opposed to ancient custom; for example, they could inherit in the absence of their brothers, do certain trades without their husbands, and widows could receive dower.

In areas governed by Roman-based written laws, women were under male guardianship in matters involving property and law, with fathers overseeing daughters, husbands overseeing wives and uncles or male relatives overseeing widows.

Throughout Europe, women&#x27;s legal status centered around their marital status while marriage itself was the biggest factor in restricting women&#x27;s autonomy. Custom, statute and practice not only reduced women&#x27;s rights and freedoms but prevented single or widowed women from holding public office on the justification that they might one day marry.

According to English Common Law, which developed from the 12th century onward, all property which a wife held at the time of marriage became a possession of her husband. Eventually, English courts forbade a husband&#x27;s transferring property without the consent of his wife, but he still retained the right to manage it and to receive the money which it produced. French married women suffered from restrictions on their legal capacity which were removed only in 1965. In the 16th century, the Reformation in Europe allowed more women to add their voices, including the English writers Jane Anger, Aemilia Lanyer, and the prophetess Anna Trapnell. English and American Quakers believed that men and women were equal. Many Quaker women were preachers. Despite relatively greater freedom for Anglo-Saxon women, until the mid-19th century, writers largely assumed that a patriarchal order was a natural order that had always existed. This perception was not seriously challenged until the 18th century when Jesuit missionaries found matrilineality in native North American peoples.

The philosopher John Locke opposed marital inequality and the mistreatment of women during this time. He was well known for advocating for marital equality among the sexes in his work during the 17th century. According to a study published in the &quot;American Journal of Social Issues &amp; Humanities,&quot; the condition for women during Locke&#x27;s time were as quote:

* English women had fewer grounds for divorce than men until 1923
* Husbands controlled most of their wives&#x27; personal property until the Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1870 and Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1882
* Children were the husband&#x27;s property
* Rape was legally impossible within a marriage
* Wives lacked crucial features of legal personhood, since the husband was taken as the representative of the family (thereby eliminating the need for women&#x27;s suffrage). These legal features of marriage suggest that the idea of a marriage between equals appeared unlikely to most Victorians. (Quoted from &quot;Gender and Good Governance in John Locke, American Journal of Social Issues &amp; Humanities Vol 2&quot;)

A paternal society can find prefer to make women&#x27;s rights a man&#x27;s duty, for instance under English common law husbands had to maintain their wives. This duty was abolished in 2010.

===== 18th and 19th century Europe =====
Starting in the late 18th century, and throughout the 19th century, rights, as a concept and claim, gained increasing political, social, and philosophical importance in Europe. Movements emerged which demanded freedom of religion, the abolition of slavery, rights for women, rights for those who did not own property, and universal suffrage. In the late 18th century the question of women&#x27;s rights became central to political debates in both France and Britain. At the time some of the greatest thinkers of the Enlightenment, who defended democratic principles of equality and challenged notions that a privileged few should rule over the vast majority of the population, believed that these principles should be applied only to their own gender and their own race. The philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, for example, thought that it was the order of nature for women to obey men.

In 1754, Dorothea Erxleben became the first German woman receiving a M.D. (University of Halle)

In 1791 the French playwright and political activist Olympe de Gouges published the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen, modelled on the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789. The Declaration is ironic in formulation and exposes the failure of the French Revolution, which had been devoted to equality. It states that: &quot;This revolution will only take effect when all women become fully aware of their deplorable condition, and of the rights they have lost in society&quot;. The Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen follows the seventeen articles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen point for point and has been described by Camille Naish as &quot;almost a parody... of the original document&quot;. The first article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen proclaims that &quot;Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be based only on common utility.&quot; The first article of the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen replied: &quot;Woman is born free and remains equal to man in rights. Social distinctions may only be based on common utility&quot;. De Gouges expands the sixth article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which declared the rights of citizens to take part in the formation of law, to:
All citizens including women are equally admissible to all public dignities, offices and employments, according to their capacity, and with no other distinction than that of their virtues and talents.

De Gouges also draws attention to the fact that under French law women were fully punishable, yet denied equal rights.

Mary Wollstonecraft, a British writer and philosopher, published &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; in 1792, arguing that it was the education and upbringing of women that created limited expectations. Wollstonecraft attacked gender oppression, pressing for equal educational opportunities, and demanded &quot;justice!&quot; and &quot;rights to humanity&quot; for all. Wollstonecraft, along with her British contemporaries Damaris Cudworth and Catharine Macaulay, started to use the language of rights in relation to women, arguing that women should have greater opportunity because like men, they were moral and rational beings.
Mary Robinson wrote in a similar vein in &quot;A Letter to the Women of England, on the Injustice of Mental Subordination.&quot;, 1799.
In his 1869 essay &quot;The Subjection of Women&quot; the English philosopher and political theorist John Stuart Mill described the situation for women in Britain as follows:

We are continually told that civilization and Christianity have restored to the woman her just rights. Meanwhile, the wife is the actual bondservant of her husband; no less so, as far as the legal obligation goes, than slaves commonly so called.

Then a member of parliament, Mill argued that women deserve the right to vote, though his proposal to replace the term &quot;man&quot; with &quot;person&quot; in the second Reform Bill of 1867 was greeted with laughter in the House of Commons and defeated by 76 to 196 votes. His arguments won little support amongst contemporaries but his attempt to amend the reform bill generated greater attention for the issue of women&#x27;s suffrage in Britain. Initially only one of several women&#x27;s rights campaigns, suffrage became the primary cause of the British women&#x27;s movement at the beginning of the 20th century. At the time, the ability to vote was restricted to wealthy property owners within British jurisdictions. This arrangement implicitly excluded women as property law and marriage law gave men ownership rights at marriage or inheritance until the 19th century. Although male suffrage broadened during the century, women were explicitly prohibited from voting nationally and locally in the 1830s by the Reform Act 1832 and the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. Millicent Fawcett and Emmeline Pankhurst led the public campaign on women&#x27;s suffrage and in 1918 a bill was passed allowing women over the age of 30 to vote.

By the 1860s, the economic sexual politics of middle-class women in Britain and its neighboring Western European countries was guided by factors such as the evolution of 19th century consumer culture. While women, particularly those in the middle class, obtained modest control of daily household expenses and had the ability to leave the house, attend social events, and shop for personal and household items, Europe&#x27;s socioeconomic climate pervaded the ideology that women were not in complete control over their urges to spend (assuming) their husband or father&#x27;s wages. As a result, many advertisements for socially &#x27;feminine&#x27; goods revolved around upward social progression, exoticisms from the Orient, and added efficiency for household roles women were deemed responsible for.

===== Russia =====

By law and custom, Muscovite Russia was a patriarchal society that subordinated women to men, and the young to their elders. Peter the Great relaxed the second custom, but not the subordination of women. A decree of 1722 explicitly forbade any forced marriages by requiring both bride and groom to consent, while parental permission still remained a requirement. But during Peter&#x27;s reign, only the man could get rid of his wife by putting her in a nunnery.

In terms of laws, there were double standards for women. Adulterous wives were sentenced to forced labor, while men who murdered their wives were merely flogged. After the death of Peter the Great, laws and customs pertaining to men&#x27;s marital authority over their wives increased. In 1782, civil law reinforced women&#x27;s responsibility to obey their husbands. By 1832, the Digest of laws changed this obligation into &quot;unlimited obedience&quot;.

In the 18th century, the Russian orthodox church further got its authority over marriage and banned priests from granting divorce, even for severely abused wives. By 1818, the Russian senate had also forbade the separation of married couples.

During World War I, caring for children was increasingly difficult for women, many of whom could not support themselves, and whose husbands had died or were fighting in the war. Many women had to give up their children to children&#x27;s homes infamous for abuse and neglect. These children&#x27;s homes were unofficially dubbed as &quot;angel factories&quot;. After the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks shut down an infamous angel factory known as the &#x27;Nikolaev Institute&#x27; situated near the Moika Canal. The Bolsheviks then replaced the Nikolaev Institute with a modern maternity home called the &#x27;Palace for Mothers and Babies&#x27;. This maternity home was used by the Bolsheviks as a model for future maternity hospitals. The countess who ran the old Institute was moved to a side wing, however she spread rumours that the Bolsheviks had removed sacred pictures, and that the nurses were promiscuous with sailors. The maternity hospital was burnt down hours before it was scheduled to open, and the countess was suspected of being responsible.

Russian women had restrictions in owning property until the mid 18th century. Women&#x27;s rights had improved after the rise of the Soviet Union under the Bolsheviks.

Under the Bolsheviks, Russia became the first country in human history to provide free abortions to women in state-run hospitals.

==== North America ====

===== Canada =====
Women&#x27;s rights activism in Canada during the 19th and early 20th centuries focused on increasing women&#x27;s role in public life, with goals including women&#x27;s suffrage, increased property rights, increased access to education, and recognition of women as &quot;persons&quot; under the law. The Famous Five were five Canadian women – Emily Murphy, Irene Marryat Parlby, Nellie Mooney McClung, Louise Crummy McKinney and Henrietta Muir Edwards – who, in 1927, asked the Supreme Court of Canada to answer the question, &quot;Does the word &#x27;Persons&#x27; in Section 24 of the British North America Act, 1867, include female persons?&quot; in the case &quot;Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General).&quot; After Canada&#x27;s Supreme Court summarized its unanimous decision that women are not such &quot;persons&quot;, the judgment was appealed and overturned in 1929 by the British Judicial Committee of the Imperial Privy Council, at that time the court of last resort for Canada.

===== United States =====

The Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) was established in 1873 and championed women&#x27;s rights, including advocating for prostitutes and for women&#x27;s suffrage. Women had access to legal handbooks specific for women such as &quot;Every woman her own lawyer: a private guide in all matters of law&quot; (1858) by George Bishop, which informed women of how to deal with property, marriage, divorce, violence, children, abandonment, economic issues, assets, etc.

==== Asia ====

===== Japan =====
The extent to which women could participate in Japanese society has varied over time and social classes. In the 8th century, Japan had women emperors, and in the 12th century (Heian period) women in Japan occupied a relatively high status, although still subordinated to men.
From the late Edo period, the status of women declined. In the 17th century, the &quot;Onna Daigaku&quot;, or &quot;Learning for Women&quot;, by Confucianist author Kaibara Ekken, spelled out expectations for Japanese women, lowering significantly their status.
During the Meiji period, industrialization and urbanization reduced the authority of fathers and husbands, but at the same time the Meiji Civil Code of 1898 denied women legal rights and subjugated them to the will of household heads.

From the mid-20th century the status of women improved greatly. Although Japan is often considered a very conservative country, it was in fact earlier than many European countries in giving women legal rights in the 20th century, as the 1947 Constitution of Japan provided a legal framework favorable to the advancement of women&#x27;s equality in Japan. Japan for instance enacted women&#x27;s suffrage in 1946, earlier than several European countries such as Switzerland (1971 at federal level; 1990 on local issues in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden), Portugal (1976 on equal terms with men, with restrictions since 1931), San Marino in 1959, Monaco in 1962, Andorra in 1970, and Liechtenstein in 1984.

===== Central Asia =====

Central Asian cultures largely remain patriarchal, however, since the fall of the former Soviet Union, the secular societies of the region have become more progressive to women&#x27;s roles outside the traditional construct of being wholly subservient to men. In Mongolia, more women than men complete school and are higher earners as result. The UN Development Programme notes &quot;significant progress&quot; in gender equality in Kazakhstan but discrimination persists. Marriage by abduction remains a serious problem in this region; the practice of bride kidnapping is prevalent in Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Karakalpakstan, an autonomous region of Uzbekistan.

==== Oceania ====

===== Australia =====
The history of women&#x27;s rights in Australia is a contradictory one: while Australia led the world in women&#x27;s suffrage rights in the 19th century, it has been very slow in recognizing women&#x27;s professional rights – it was not until 1966 that its marriage bar was removed. On the other hand, reforms which allowed women both to vote and stand for office in South Australia in the late 19th century were a cornerstone for women&#x27;s political rights in other parts of the world. In this regard, Australia differs from other cultures, in that women&#x27;s suffrage in Australia was one of the earliest objectives of the feminist movement there (beginning with South Australia and Western Australia) unlike other cultures, such as Eastern European cultures, where at the turn of the 20th century the feminist movement focused on labour rights, access to professions and education, rather than political rights. To this day, Australia has a quite low percentage of women in business executive roles compared to other countries with equivalent corporate structures.

== Core concepts ==

=== Equal employment ===

Employment rights for women include non-discriminatory access of women to jobs and equal pay. The rights of women and men to have equal pay and equal benefits for equal work were openly denied by the British Hong Kong Government up to the early 1970s. Leslie Wah-Leung Chung (鍾華亮, 1917–2009), President of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants&#x27; Association 香港政府華員會 (1965–68), contributed to the establishment of equal pay for men and women, including the right for married women to be permanent employees. Before this, the job status of a woman changed from permanent employee to temporary employee once she was married, thus losing the pension benefit. Some of them even lost their jobs. Since nurses were mostly women, this improvement of the rights of married women meant much to the nursing profession. In some European countries, married women could not work without the consent of their husbands until a few decades ago, for example in France until 1965 and in Spain until 1975. In addition, marriage bars, a practice adopted from the late 19th century to the 1970s across many countries, including Austria, Australia, Ireland, Canada, and Switzerland, restricted married women from employment in many professions.

A key issue towards insuring gender equality in the workplace is the respecting of maternity rights and reproductive rights of women. Maternity leave (and paternity leave in some countries) and parental leave are temporary periods of absence from employment granted immediately before and after childbirth in order to support the mother&#x27;s full recovery and grant time to care for the baby.
Different countries have different rules regarding maternity leave, paternity leave and parental leave. In the European Union (EU) the policies vary significantly by country, but the EU members must abide by the minimum standards of the Pregnant Workers Directive and Work–Life Balance Directive.

=== Right to vote ===

During the 19th century, some women began to ask for, demand, and then agitate and demonstrate for the right to vote – the right to participate in their government and its law-making. Other women opposed suffrage, like Helen Kendrick Johnson, who argued in the 1897 pamphlet &quot;Woman and the Republic&quot; that women could achieve legal and economic equality without having the vote. The ideals of women&#x27;s suffrage developed alongside that of universal suffrage and today women&#x27;s suffrage is considered a right (under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women). During the 19th century, the right to vote was gradually extended in many countries, and women started to campaign for their right to vote. In 1893 New Zealand became the first country to give women the right to vote on a national level. Australia gave women the right to vote in 1902.

A number of Nordic countries gave women the right to vote in the early 20th century – Finland (1906), Norway (1913), Denmark and Iceland (1915). With the end of the First World War many other countries followed – the Netherlands (1917), Austria, Azerbaijan, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Georgia, Poland and Sweden (1918), Germany and Luxembourg (1919), Turkey (1934), and the United States (1920). Late adopters in Europe were Greece in 1952, Switzerland (1971 at federal level; 1959–1991 on local issues at canton level), Portugal (1976 on equal terms with men, with restrictions since 1931) as well as the microstates of San Marino in 1959, Monaco in 1962, Andorra in 1970, and Liechtenstein in 1984.

In Canada, most provinces enacted women&#x27;s suffrage between 1917 and 1919, late adopters being Prince Edward Island in 1922, Newfoundland in 1925 and Quebec in 1940.

In Latin America some countries gave women the right to vote in the first half of the 20th century – Ecuador (1929), Brazil (1932), El Salvador (1939), Dominican Republic (1942), Guatemala (1956) and Argentina (1946). In India, under colonial rule, universal suffrage was granted in 1935. Other Asian countries gave women the right to vote in the mid-20th century – Japan (1945), China (1947) and Indonesia (1955). In Africa, women generally got the right to vote along with men through universal suffrage – Liberia (1947), Uganda (1958) and Nigeria (1960). In many countries in the Middle East universal suffrage was acquired after World War II, although in others, such as Kuwait, suffrage is very limited. On 16 May 2005, the Parliament of Kuwait extended suffrage to women by a 35–23 vote.

=== Property rights ===

During the 19th century some women, such as Ernestine Rose, Paulina Wright Davis, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Harriet Beecher Stowe, in the United States and Britain began to challenge laws that denied them the right to their property once they married. Under the common law doctrine of &quot;coverture&quot; husbands gained control of their wives&#x27; real estate and wages. Beginning in the 1840s, state legislatures in the United States and the British Parliament began passing statutes that protected women&#x27;s property from their husbands and their husbands&#x27; creditors. These laws were known as the Married Women&#x27;s Property Acts. Courts in the 19th-century United States also continued to require privy examinations of married women who sold their property. A privy examination was a practice in which a married woman who wished to sell her property had to be separately examined by a judge or justice of the peace outside of the presence of her husband and asked if her husband was pressuring her into signing the document. Property rights for women continued to be restricted in many European countries until legal reforms of the 1960-70s. For example, in West Germany, the law pertaining to rural farm succession favored male heirs until 1963. In the US, Head and master laws, which gave sole control of marital property to the husband, were common until a few decades ago. The Supreme Court, in &quot;Kirchberg v. Feenstra&quot; (1981), declared such laws unconstitutional.

=== Freedom of movement ===

Freedom of movement is an essential right, recognized by international instruments, including Article 15 (4) of CEDAW. Nevertheless, in many regions of the world, women have this right severely restricted, in law or in practice. For instance, in some countries women may not leave the home without a male guardian, or without the consent of the husband – for example the personal law of Yemen states that a wife must obey her husband and must not get out of the home without his consent. Even in countries which do not have legal restrictions, women&#x27;s movement may be prevented in practice by social and religious norms such as purdah. Laws restricting women from travelling existed until relatively recently in some Western countries: until 1983, in Australia the passport application of a married woman had to be authorized by her husband.

Several Middle Eastern countries also follow the male guardianship system in the modern era, where women are required to seek permission from the male family member for several things, including traveling to other nations. In August 2019, Saudi Arabia ended its male guardianship laws, allowing women to travel by themselves.

Various practices have been used historically to restrict women&#x27;s freedom of movement, such as foot binding, the custom of applying painfully tight binding to the feet of young Chinese girls, which was common between the 10th and 20th centuries.

Women&#x27;s freedom of movement may be restricted by laws, but it may also be restricted by attitudes towards women in public spaces. In areas where it is not socially accepted for women to leave the home, women who are outside may face abuse such as insults, sexual harassment and violence.
Many of the restrictions on women&#x27;s freedom of movement are framed as measures to &quot;protect&quot; women.

=== Informing women about their legal rights ===

The lack of legal knowledge among many women, especially in developing countries, is a major obstacle to the improvement of women&#x27;s situation. International bodies, such as the United Nations, have stated that the obligation of states does not only consist in passing relevant laws, but also in informing women about the existence of such laws, in order to enable them to seek justice and realize in practice their rights. Therefore, states must popularize the laws, and explain them clearly to the public, in order to prevent ignorance, or misconceptions originating in popular myths, about the laws. The United Nations Development Programme states that, in order to advance gender justice, &quot;Women must know their rights and be able to access legal systems&quot;, and the 1993 UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women indicates that &quot;States should also inform women of their rights in seeking redress through such mechanisms&quot;.

=== Discrimination ===

The United Nations Working Group on business and human rights (WGBHR) has stated that discrimination against women has historically been rooted in patriarchal social norms and power structures. Women&#x27;s rights movements focus on ending discrimination against women. In this regard, the definition of discrimination itself is important. According to the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), the right to freedom from discrimination includes not only the obligation of states to treat in the same way persons who are in analogous situations, but also the obligation to treat in a different way persons who are in different situations. In this regard, equity, not just &quot;equality&quot; is important. Therefore, states must sometimes differentiate between women and men – through for example offering maternity leave or other legal protections surrounding pregnancy and childbirth (to take into account the biological realities of reproduction), or through acknowledging a specific historical context. For example, acts of violence committed by men against women do not happen in a vacuum, but are part of a social context: in &quot;Opuz v Turkey&quot;, the ECHR defined violence against women as a form of discrimination against women; this is also the position of the Istanbul Convention which at Article 3 states that &quot;violence against women&quot; is understood as a violation of human rights and &quot;a form of discrimination against women&quot; [...]&quot;.

There are different views on where it is appropriate to differentiate between women and men, and one view is that the act of sexual intercourse is an act where this difference must be acknowledged, both due to the increased physical risks for the woman, and due to the historical context of women being systematically subjected to forced sexual intercourse while in a socially subordinated position (particularly within marriage and during war). States must also differentiate with regard to healthcare by ensuring that women&#x27;s health – particularly with regard to reproductive health such as pregnancy and childbirth – is not neglected. According to the World Health Organization, &quot;Discrimination in health care settings takes many forms and is often manifested when an individual or group is denied access to health care services that are otherwise available to others. It can also occur through denial of services that are only needed by certain groups, such as women.&quot; The refusal of states to acknowledge the specific needs of women, such as the necessity of specific policies like the strong investment of states in reducing maternal mortality can be a form of discrimination. In this regard treating women and men similarly does not work because certain biological aspects such as menstruation, pregnancy, labor, childbirth, and breastfeeding, as well as certain medical conditions, only affect women. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women stipulates in its &quot;General recommendation No. 35 on gender based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19&quot; that states should &quot;Examine gender neutral laws and policies to ensure that they do not create or perpetuate existing inequalities and repeal or modify them if they do so&quot;. (paragraph 32). Another example of gender neutral policy which harms women is that where medication tested in medical trials only on men is also used on women assuming that there are no biological differences.

=== Right to health ===

Health is defined by the World Health Organization as &quot;a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity&quot;. Women&#x27;s health refers to the health of women, which differs from that of men in many unique ways.

Women&#x27;s health is severely impaired in some parts of the world, due to factors such as inequality, confinement of women to the home, indifference of medical workers, lack of autonomy of women, and lack of financial resources of women. Discrimination against women occurs also through denial of medical services that are only needed by women. Violations of women&#x27;s right to health may result in maternal death, accounting for more than 300,000 deaths per year, most of them in developing countries. Certain traditional practices, such as female genital mutilation, also affect women&#x27;s health. Worldwide, young women and adolescent girls are the population most affected by HIV/AIDS.

There are also historical cases of medical abuse of women, notably the 19th century policy of wrongful confinement of women into insane asylums, often at the request of husbands and male relatives. A notable activist against such practices was Elizabeth Packard, who was wrongfully committed in 1860 by her husband, and filed a lawsuit and won thereafter, highlighted the issue of wrongful involuntary commitment. Another activist was investigative journalist Nellie Bly, who went undercover in 1887, at an asylum in New York City, to expose the terrible conditions that mental patients at the time had to deal with.

=== Right to education ===
The right to education is a universal entitlement to education. The Convention Against Discrimination in Education prohibits discrimination in education, with discrimination being defined as &quot;any distinction, exclusion, limitation or preference which, being based on race, colour, &quot;sex&quot;, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, economic condition or birth, has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing equality of treatment in education&quot;.
The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights states at Article 3 that &quot;The States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all economic, social and cultural rights set forth in the present Covenant&quot;, with Article 13 recognizing &quot;the right of everyone to education&quot;.

Access to education for women remains limited in some parts of the world. Almost two-thirds of the world&#x27;s illiterate adults are women.

While women&#x27;s right to access to academic education is recognized as very important, it is increasingly recognized that academic education must be supplemented with education on human rights, non-discrimination, ethics and gender equality, in order for social advancement to be possible. This was pointed out by Zeid bin Ra&#x27;ad, the current United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, who stressed the importance of human rights education for all children: &quot;What good was it to humanity that Josef Mengele had advanced degrees in medicine and anthropology, given that he was capable of committing the most inhuman crimes? Eight of the 15 people who planned The Holocaust at Wannsee in 1942 held PhDs. They shone academically, and yet they were profoundly toxic to the world. Radovan Karadžić was a trained psychiatrist. Pol Pot studied radio electronics in Paris. Does this matter, when neither of them showed the smallest shred of ethics and understanding?&quot; There has been increased attention given in recent decades to the raising of student awareness to the importance of gender equality.

=== Reproductive rights ===


==== Legal rights ====

Reproductive rights are legal rights and freedoms relating to reproduction and reproductive health. Reproductive rights were endorsed by the twenty-year Cairo Programme of Action which was adopted in 1994 at the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo, and by the Beijing Declaration and Beijing Platform for Action in 1995.

In the 1870s feminists advanced the concept of &quot;voluntary motherhood&quot; as a political critique of &quot;involuntary motherhood&quot; and expressing a desire for women&#x27;s emancipation. Advocates for voluntary motherhood disapproved of contraception, arguing that women should only engage in sex for the purpose of procreation and advocated for periodic or permanent abstinence.

Reproductive rights represent a broad concept, that may include some or all of the following rights: the right to legal or safe abortion, the right to control one&#x27;s reproductive functions, the right to access quality reproductive healthcare, and the right to education and access in order to make reproductive choices free from coercion, discrimination, and violence. Reproductive rights may also be understood to include education about contraception and sexually transmitted infections. Reproductive rights are often defined to include freedom from female genital mutilation (FGM), and forced abortion and forced sterilization. The Istanbul Convention recognizes these two rights at Article 38 – Female genital mutilation and Article 39 – Forced abortion and forced sterilisation.

Reproductive rights are understood as rights of both men and women, but are most frequently advanced as women&#x27;s rights.

In the 1960s, reproductive rights activists promoted women&#x27;s right to bodily autonomy, with these social movements leading to the gain of legal access to contraception and abortion during the next decades in many countries.

==== Birth control ====
In the early 20th century &quot;birth control&quot; was advanced as alternative to the then fashionable terms &quot;family limitation&quot; and &quot;voluntary motherhood&quot;. The phrase &quot;birth control&quot; entered the English language in 1914 and was popularised by Margaret Sanger, who was mainly active in the US but had gained an international reputation by the 1930s. The British birth control campaigner Marie Stopes made contraception acceptable in Britain during the 1920s by framing it in scientific terms. Stopes assisted emerging birth control movements in a number of British colonies. The birth control movement advocated for contraception so as to permit sexual intercourse as desired without the risk of pregnancy. By emphasizing &quot;control&quot;, the birth control movement argued that women should have control over their reproduction, an idea that aligned closely to the theme of the feminist movement. Slogans such as &quot;control over our own bodies&quot; criticised male domination and demanded women&#x27;s liberation, a connotation that is absent from the family planning, population control and eugenics movements. In the 1960s and 1970s the birth control movement advocated for the legalisation of abortion and large-scale education campaigns about contraception by governments. In the 1980s birth control and population control organisations co-operated in demanding rights to contraception and abortion, with an increasing emphasis on &quot;choice&quot;.

Birth control has become a major theme in United States politics. Reproductive issues are cited as examples of women&#x27;s powerlessness to exercise their rights. The societal acceptance of birth control required the separation of sex from procreation, making birth control a highly controversial subject in the 20th century. Birth control in the United States has become an arena for conflict between liberal and conservative values, raising questions about family, personal freedom, state intervention, religion in politics, sexual morality and social welfare. &quot;Reproductive rights&quot;, that is, rights relating to sexual reproduction and reproductive health, were first discussed as a subset of human rights at the United Nation&#x27;s 1968 International Conference on Human Rights.

==== Abortion ====

Women&#x27;s reproductive rights may be understood as including the right to easy access to a safe and legal abortion. Abortion laws vary from a full prohibition (the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Malta, Nicaragua, the Vatican) to countries such as Canada, where there are no legal restrictions. In many countries where abortion is permitted by law, women may only have limited access to safe abortion services. In some countries, abortion is permitted only to save the pregnant woman&#x27;s life, or if the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.
There are also countries where the law is liberal, but in practice it is very difficult to have an abortion, due to most doctors being conscientious objectors. The fact that in some countries where abortion is legal it is &quot;de facto&quot; very difficult to have access to one is controversial; the UN in its 2017 resolution on &quot;Intensification of efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls: domestic violence&quot; urged states to guarantee access to &quot;safe abortion where such services are permitted by national law&quot;.

The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women considers the criminalization of abortion a &quot;violations of women&#x27;s sexual and reproductive health and rights&quot; and a form of &quot;gender based violence&quot;; paragraph 18 of its &quot;General recommendation No. 35 on gender based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19&quot; states that: &quot;Violations of women&#x27;s sexual and reproductive health and rights, such as forced sterilizations, forced abortion, forced pregnancy, criminalisation of abortion, denial or delay of safe abortion and post abortion care, forced continuation of pregnancy, abuse and mistreatment of women and girls seeking sexual and reproductive health information, goods and services, are forms of gender based violence that, depending on the circumstances, may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.&quot; The same &quot;General Recommendation&quot; also urges countries at paragraph 31 to [...] In particular, repeal:
a) Provisions that allow, tolerate or condone forms of gender based violence against women, including [...] legislation that criminalises abortion&quot;.

According to Human Rights Watch, &quot;Abortion is a highly emotional subject and one that excites deeply held opinions. However, equitable access to safe abortion services is first and foremost a human right. Where abortion is safe and legal, no one is forced to have one. Where abortion is illegal and unsafe, women are forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term or suffer serious health consequences and even death. Approximately 13% of maternal deaths worldwide are attributable to unsafe abortion—between 68,000 and 78,000 deaths annually.&quot; According to Human Rights Watch, &quot;the denial of a pregnant woman&#x27;s right to make an independent decision regarding abortion violates or poses a threat to a wide range of human rights.&quot; African American women are five times more likely to have an abortion than a white woman.

The Catholic Church and many other Christian faiths, particularly those considered the Christian right, and most Orthodox Jews regard abortion not as a right, but as a moral evil and a mortal sin.

Russia was the first country to legalise abortions and offer free medical care in state hospitals to do so. After the October Revolution, the Women&#x27;s wing of the Bolshevik Party (the Zhenotdel) persuaded the Bolsheviks to legalise abortion (as a &#x27;temporary measure&#x27;). The Bolsheviks legalised abortion in November 1920. This was the first time in world history that women had won the right to free abortions in state hospitals.

==== Abuse during childbirth ====

The abuse of women during childbirth is a recently identified global problem and a basic violation of a woman&#x27;s rights. Abuse during childbirth is the neglect, physical abuse and lack of respect during childbirth. This treatment is regarded as a violation of woman&#x27;s rights. It also has the effect of preventing women from seeking pre-natal care and using other health care services.

==== Child marriage ====
Child marriage is a practice which is widespread across the world, and is often connected to poverty and gender inequality. Child marriage endangers the reproductive health of young girls, leading to an increased risk of complications in pregnancy or childbirth. Such complications are a leading cause of death among girls in developing countries.

==== Forced pregnancy ====

Forced pregnancy is the practice of forcing a woman or girl to become pregnant, often as part of a forced marriage, including by means of bride kidnapping, through rape (including marital rape, war rape and genocidal rape) or as part of a program of breeding slaves (see Slave breeding in the United States). It is a form of reproductive coercion, was common historically, and still occurs in parts of the world. In the 20th century, state-mandated forced marriage with the aim of increasing the population was practiced by some authoritarian governments, notably during the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, which systematically forced people into marriages ordering them to have children, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution. Forced pregnancy is strongly connected to the custom of bride price.

=== Freedom from violence ===

Violence against women is, collectively, violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against women. The UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women states, &quot;violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women&quot; and &quot;violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men.&quot; The Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, also known as the Istanbul Convention, provides the following definition of violence against women: &quot;violence against women&quot; is understood as a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against women and shall mean all acts of gender-based violence that result in, or are likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life&quot;. Violence against women may be perpetrated by individuals, by groups, or by the State. It may occur in private or in public. Violence against women may be sexual violence, physical violence, psychological violence, or socioeconomic violence. Some forms of violence against women have long cultural traditions: honor killings, dowry violence, female genital mutilation. Violence against women is considered by the World Health Organization &quot;a major public health problem and a violation of women&#x27;s human rights.&quot;

=== Family law ===

Under male-dominated family law, women had few, if any, rights, being under the control of the husband or male relatives. Legal concepts that existed throughout the centuries, such as coverture, marital power, Head and Master laws, kept women under the strict control of their husbands. Restrictions from marriage laws also extended to public life, such as marriage bars. Practices such as dowry, bride price or bride service were, and still are to this day in some parts of the world, very common. Some countries continue to require to this day a male guardian for women, without whom women cannot exercise civil rights. Other harmful practices include marriage of young girls, often to much older men.

In many legal systems, the husband had complete power over the family; for example, in Franco&#x27;s Spain, although women&#x27;s role was defined as that of a homemaker who had to largely avoid the public sphere in order to take care of the children, the legal rights over the children belonged to the father; until 1970 the husband could give a family&#x27;s child to adoption without the consent of his wife. Until 1975, women in Spain needed their husband&#x27;s permission (referred to as &quot;permiso marital&quot;) for many activities, including employment, traveling away from home, and property ownership. Switzerland was one of the last European countries to establish gender equality in marriage: married women&#x27;s rights were severely restricted until 1988, when legal reforms providing gender equality in marriage, abolishing the legal authority of the husband, came into force (these reforms had been approved in 1985 by voters in a referendum, who narrowly voted in favor with 54.7% of voters approving).

Another area of interest for feminists has been adultery laws, due to the extreme legal and social differences between the way female and male adultery was treated in criminal law and family law in many cultures, with the former being subjected to severe punishments, up to the death penalty, and violent repression such as honor killings, while the latter was often tolerated, even encouraged as a symbol of male social status. In Europe, this was especially true in Southern Europe, and honor killings were also historically common in this region, and &quot;there have been acts of &#x27;honour&#x27; killings within living memory within Mediterranean countries such as Italy and Greece.&quot; The tradition in French culture for upper-class men to have mistresses, coupled with the toleration for crimes of passion (French: &quot;crime passionnel&quot;) committed against unfaithful wives illustrates these norms, which were also supported by the French Penal Code of 1810 (which provided for leniency for husbands who killed their wives caught committing adultery, but not for wives who killed their husbands under similar circumstances, and which treated female and male adultery differently, which remained in force until 1975). Similar norms existed in Spain (crimes of passion until 1963, and adultery – defined differently for women and men – until 1978).

== Modern movements ==


In the subsequent decades women&#x27;s rights again became an important issue in the English-speaking world. By the 1960s the movement was called &quot;feminism&quot; or &quot;women&#x27;s liberation.&quot; Reformers wanted the same pay as men, equal rights in law, and the freedom to plan their families or not have children at all. Their efforts were met with mixed results.

The International Council of Women (ICW) was the first women&#x27;s organization to work across national boundaries for the common cause of advocating human rights for women. In March and April 1888, women leaders came together in Washington, D.C., with 80 speakers and 49 delegates representing 53 women&#x27;s organizations from 9 countries: Canada, the United States, Ireland, India, England, Finland, Denmark, France and Norway. Women from professional organizations, trade unions, arts groups and benevolent societies participate. National Councils are affiliated with the ICW and thus make themselves heard at the international level. In 1904, the ICW met in Berlin, Germany. The ICW worked with the League of Nations during the 1920s and the United Nations post-World War II. Today the ICW holds Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the highest accreditation an NGO can achieve at the United Nations. Currently, it is composed of 70 countries and has a headquarters in Lasaunne, Switzerland. International meetings are held every three years.

In the UK, a public groundswell of opinion in favour of legal equality had gained pace, partly through the extensive employment of women in what were traditional male roles during both world wars. By the 1960s the legislative process was being readied, tracing through MP Willie Hamilton&#x27;s select committee report, his equal pay for equal work bill, the creation of a Sex Discrimination Board, Lady Sear&#x27;s draft sex anti-discrimination bill, a government Green Paper of 1973, until 1975 when the first British Sex Discrimination Act, an Equal Pay Act, and an Equal Opportunities Commission came into force. With encouragement from the UK government, the other countries of the EEC soon followed suit with an agreement to ensure that discrimination laws would be phased out across the European Community.

In the US, the National Organization for Women (NOW) was created in 1966 with the purpose of bringing about equality for all women. NOW was one important group that fought for the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). This amendment stated that &quot;equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex.&quot; But there was disagreement on how the proposed amendment would be understood. Supporters believed it would guarantee women equal treatment. But critics feared it might deny women the right to be financially supported by their husbands. The amendment died in 1982 because not enough states had ratified it. ERAs have been included in subsequent Congresses, but have still failed to be ratified.

Women for Women International (WfWI) is a nonprofit humanitarian organization that provides practical and moral support to women survivors of war. WfWI helps such women rebuild their lives after war&#x27;s devastation through a year-long tiered program that begins with direct financial aid and emotional counseling and includes life skills (e.g., literacy, numeracy) training if necessary, rights awareness education, health education, job skills training and small business development. The organization was co-founded in 1993.

The National Council of Women of Canada (Conseil national des femmes du Canada), is a Canadian advocacy organization based in Ottawa aimed at improving conditions for women, families, and communities. A federation of nationally organized societies of men and women and local and provincial councils of women, it is the Canadian member of the International Council of Women (ICW). The council has concerned itself in areas including women&#x27;s suffrage, immigration, health care, education, mass media, the environment, and many others. Formed on 27 October 1857 in Toronto, Ontario, it is one of the oldest advocacy organizations in the country.
The Association for the Protection and Defense of Women&#x27;s Rights in Saudi Arabia is a Saudi non-governmental organization founded to provide activism for women&#x27;s rights. It was founded by Wajeha al-Huwaider and Fawzia Al-Uyyouni, and grew out of a 2007 movement to gain women the right to drive. The association is not officially licensed by the government of Saudi Arabia, and has been warned not to mount demonstrations. In a 2007 interview, al-Huwaider described the goals: &quot;representation for women in shari&#x27;a courts; setting a [minimum] age for girls&#x27; marriages; allowing women to take care of their own affairs in government agencies and allowing them to enter government buildings; protecting women from domestic violence, such as physical or verbal violence, or keeping her from studies, work, or marriage, or forcing her to divorce...&quot;

In Ukraine, FEMEN was founded in 2008. The organisation is internationally known for its topless protests against sex tourists, international marriage agencies, sexism and other social, national and international social illnesses. FEMEN has sympathisers groups in many European countries through social media.

=== United Nations and World Conferences ===

In 1946 the United Nations established a Commission on the Status of Women. Originally as the Section on the Status of Women, Human Rights Division, Department of Social Affairs, and now part of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). Since 1975 the UN has held a series of world conferences on women&#x27;s issues, starting with the World Conference of the International Women&#x27;s Year in Mexico City. These conferences created an international forum for women&#x27;s rights, but also illustrated divisions between women of different cultures and the difficulties of attempting to apply principles universally. Four World Conferences have been held, the first in Mexico City (International Women&#x27;s Year, 1975), the second in Copenhagen (1980) and the third in Nairobi (1985).

At the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing (1995), &quot;The Platform for Action&quot; was signed. This included a commitment to achieve &quot;gender equality and the empowerment of women&quot;. The same commitment was reaffirmed by all U.N. member nations at the Millennium Summit in 2000 and was reflected in the Millennium Development Goals to be achieved by 2015.

In 2010, UN Women was founded through the merging of the Division for the Advancement of Women, the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women, the Office of the Special Adviser or Gender Issues Advancement of Women and the United Nations Development Fund for Women by General Assembly Resolution 63/311.

=== International women&#x27;s rights ===

Compared to the Western women&#x27;s rights movements, international women&#x27;s rights are plagued with different issues. While it is called international women&#x27;s rights, it is also can be known as third-world feminism. International women&#x27;s rights deal with issues such as marriage, sexual slavery, forced child marriage, and female genital mutilation. According to the organization, EQUAL MEANS EQUAL, &quot;the United Nations come horrifying statistics: Victims of female genital mutilation – a ritual to remove a young girl&#x27;s clitoris to ensure her fidelity – number 130 million. Some 60 million girls become &#x27;child brides,&#x27; forced to marry, sometimes after being kidnapped and raped&quot;. Something that has been created to combat such things is the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. It was set in place to help against discrimination in education, marriage, sexual violence, and politics. While this does not only pertain to non-western countries, 193 states have ratified it. Some of the countries that have opposed it include Iran, Palau, Somalia, North and South Sudan, Tonga, and the United States.

=== World Bank ===

A 2019 report from the World Bank found that women have full legal rights to men in only six countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Latvia, Luxembourg and Sweden.

=== Woman, Life, Freedom ===

Kurdistani Iraqi women and Iranian women used this movement, in 2021 and 2022, in an anti-government uprising.

== Human rights ==

=== United Nations convention ===

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948, enshrines &quot;the equal rights of men and women&quot;, and addressed both equality and equity issues.
In 1979, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) for legal implementation of the Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. Described as an international bill of rights for women, it came into force on 3 September 1981. The UN member states that have not ratified the convention are Iran, Palau, Somalia, Sudan, Tonga, and the United States. Niue and the Vatican City, which are non-member states, have also not ratified it. The latest state to become a party to the convention is South Sudan, on 30 April 2015.

The Convention defines discrimination against women in the following terms:
Any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.

It also establishes an agenda of action for putting an end to sex-based discrimination for which states ratifying the convention are required to enshrine gender equality into their domestic legislation, repeal all discriminatory provisions in their laws, and enact new provisions to guard against discrimination against women. They must also establish tribunals and public institutions to guarantee women effective protection against discrimination, and take steps to eliminate all forms of discrimination practiced against women by individuals, organizations, and enterprises.

=== Marriage, divorce, and family law ===

Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights enshrines the right of consenting men and women to marry and found a family.

(1) Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family. They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution.
(2) Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses.
(3) The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.

Article 16 of CEDAW stipulates that, &quot;1. States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in all matters relating to marriage and family relations&quot;. Among the rights included are a woman&#x27;s right to freely and consensually choose her spouse; to have parental rights to her children irrespective of her marital status; the right of a married woman to choose a profession or an occupation, and to have property rights within marriage. In addition to these, &quot;The betrothal and the marriage of a child shall have no legal effect&quot;.

Polygamous marriage is a controversial practice, prevalent in some parts of the world. The general recommendations made by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, state in &quot;General Recommendation No. 21, Equality in marriage and family relations&quot;: &quot;Polygamous marriage contravenes a woman&#x27;s right to equality with men, and can have such serious emotional and financial consequences for her and her dependents that such marriages ought to be discouraged and prohibited.&quot;

Cohabitation of unmarried couples as well as single mothers are common in some parts the world. The Human Rights Committee has stated:

27. In giving effect to recognition of the family in the context of article 23, it is important to accept the concept of the various forms of family, including unmarried couples and their children and single parents and their children and to ensure the equal treatment of women in these contexts (General Comment 19 paragraph 2 last sentence). Single parent families frequently consist of a single woman caring for one or more children, and States parties should describe what measures of support are in place to enable her to discharge her parental functions on the basis of equality with a man in a similar position.

=== Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ===

The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (VDPA) is a human rights declaration adopted by consensus at the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993 in Vienna, Austria. This declaration recognizes women&#x27;s rights as being protected human rights. Paragraph 18 reads:

The human rights of women and of the girl-child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights. The full and equal participation of women in political, civil, economic, social and cultural life, at the national, regional and international levels, and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex are priority objectives of the international community.

=== United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 ===

On 31 October 2000, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, the first formal and legal document from the United Nations Security Council that requires all states to fully respect international humanitarian law and international human rights law applicable to the rights and protection of women and girls during and after the armed conflicts.

=== Regional conventions ===

The Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women, better known as the Belém do Pará Convention, was adopted by the Organization of American States on 9 June 1994. As of March 2020, 32 of the 34 or 35 member states of the Organization of American States have either signed and ratified or acceded to the Belém do Pará Convention; only Canada, Cuba and the United States have not.

The Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, better known as the Maputo Protocol, was adopted by the African Union on 11 July 2003 at its second summit in Maputo, Mozambique. On 25 November 2005, having been ratified by the required 15 member nations of the African Union, the protocol entered into force. The protocol guarantees comprehensive rights to women including the right to take part in the political process, to social and political equality with men, and to control of their reproductive health, and an end to female genital mutilation.

The Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, better known as the Istanbul Convention, was adopted by the Council of Europe on 11 May 2011. As of June 2020, the treaty has been signed by 45/47 Council of Europe member states and the European Union; 34 of the signatories have also ratified the convention.

== Violence against women ==

=== United Nations Declaration ===

The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women was adopted by the United Nations in 1993. It defines violence against women as &quot;any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.&quot; This resolution established that women have a right to be free from violence. As a consequence of the resolution, in 1999, the General Assembly declared the day of 25 November to be the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.

Article 2 of The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women outlines several forms of violence against women:

Article Two:
Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following:

: (a) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including battering, sexual abuse of female children in the household, dowry-related violence, marital rape, female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women, non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitation;
: (b) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring within the general community, including rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women and forced prostitution;
: (c) Physical, sexual and psychological violence perpetrated or condoned by the State, wherever it occurs.

=== Istanbul Conventions ===

The Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, also known as the Istanbul Convention, is the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of domestic violence and violence against women, and came into force in 2014.
Countries which ratify it must ensure that the forms of violence defined in its text are outlawed. In its Preamble, the Convention states that &quot;the realisation of &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; equality between women and men is a key element in the prevention of violence against women&quot;. The convention also provides a definition of domestic violence as &quot;all acts of physical, sexual, psychological or economic violence that occur within the family or domestic unit or between former or current spouses or partners, whether or not the perpetrator shares or has shared the same residence with the victim&quot;. Although it is a Convention of the Council of Europe, it is open to accession by any country.

=== Rape and sexual violence ===
Rape, sometimes called sexual assault, is an assault by a person involving sexual intercourse with or sexual penetration of another person without that person&#x27;s consent. Rape is generally considered a serious sex crime as well as a civil assault. When part of a widespread and systematic practice, rape and sexual slavery are now recognised as a crime against humanity as well as a war crime. Rape is also now recognised as a form of genocide when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group.

==== As genocide ====

In 1998, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda established by the United Nations made landmark decisions that rape is a crime of genocide under international law. The trial of Jean-Paul Akayesu, the mayor of Taba Commune in Rwanda, established precedents that rape is an element of the crime of genocide. The Akayesu judgement includes the first interpretation and application by an international court of the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The Trial Chamber held that rape, which it defined as &quot;a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive&quot;, and sexual assault constitute acts of genocide insofar as they were committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group. It found that sexual assault formed an integral part of the process of destroying the Tutsi ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only, manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide.

Judge Navanethem Pillay said in a statement after the verdict: &quot;From time immemorial, rape has been regarded as one of the spoils of war. Now it will be considered a war crime. We want to send out a strong message that rape is no longer a trophy of war.&quot; An estimated 500,000 women were raped during the 1994 Rwandan Genocide.

==== As a crime against humanity ====

The Rome Statute Explanatory Memorandum, which defines the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, recognises rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, &quot;or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity&quot; as a crime against humanity if the action is part of a widespread or systematic practice. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action also condemn systematic rape as well as murder, sexual slavery, and forced pregnancy.

Rape was first recognised as a crime against humanity when the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia issued arrest warrants based on the Geneva Conventions and Violations of the Laws or Customs of War. Specifically, it was recognised that Muslim women in Foca (southeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina) were subjected to systematic and widespread gang rape, torture, and sexual enslavement by Bosnian Serb soldiers, policemen, and members of paramilitary groups after the takeover of the city in April 1992. The indictment was of major legal significance and was the first time that sexual assaults were investigated for the purpose of prosecution under the rubric of torture and enslavement as a crime against humanity. The indictment was confirmed by a 2001 verdict by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia that rape and sexual enslavement are crimes against humanity. This ruling challenged the widespread acceptance of rape and sexual enslavement of women as intrinsic part of war. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia found three Bosnian Serb men guilty of rape of Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) women and girls, and two of the men were found guilty of the crime against humanity of sexual enslavement for holding women and girls captive. Many of the women subsequently disappeared.
According to a report by the UN Human Rights Office, published on 28 July 2020, the women who traveled abroad were forcibly returned to North Korea and were subjected to abuse, torture, sexual violence and other violations. North Korea bans citizens from traveling abroad. Those women who were detained for doing so were regularly beaten, tortured, and subjected to forced nudity and invasive body searches. Women have also reported that in case of pregnancy, the prison officials aborted many children by either beating the women or making them do hard labor.

=== Forced marriage and slavery ===
The 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery defines &quot;institutions and practices similar to slavery&quot; to include:

c) Any institution or practice whereby:

* (i) A woman, without the right to refuse, is promised or given in marriage on payment of a consideration in money or in kind to her parents, guardian, family or any other person or group; or
* (ii) The husband of a woman, his family, or his clan, has the right to transfer her to another person for value received or otherwise; or
* (iii) A woman on the death of her husband is liable to be inherited by another person;

The Istanbul Convention requires countries which ratify it to prohibit forced marriage and to ensure that forced marriages can be easily voided without further victimization.

=== Trafficking Protocol ===

The Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children is a protocol to the Convention against Transnational Organised Crime. Its purpose is defined in &quot;Article 2. Statement of purpose&quot; as: &quot;(a) To prevent and combat trafficking in persons, paying particular attention to women and children; (b) To protect and assist the victims of such trafficking, with full respect for their human rights; and (c) To promote cooperation among States Parties in order to meet those objectives.&quot;

<text>The rare-earth elements (REE), also called the rare-earth metals or rare earths, and sometimes the lanthanides or lanthanoids (although scandium and yttrium, which do not belong to this series, are usually included as rare earths), are a set of 17 nearly indistinguishable lustrous silvery-white soft heavy metals. Compounds containing rare earths have diverse applications in electrical and electronic components, lasers, glass, magnetic materials, and industrial processes.

Scandium and yttrium are considered rare-earth elements because they tend to occur in the same ore deposits as the lanthanides and exhibit similar chemical properties, but have different electrical and magnetic properties. The term &#x27;rare-earth&#x27; is a misnomer because they are not actually scarce, although historically it took a long time to isolate these elements.

These metals tarnish slowly in air at room temperature and react slowly with cold water to form hydroxides, liberating hydrogen. They react with steam to form oxides and ignite spontaneously at a temperature of . These elements and their compounds have no biological function other than in several specialized enzymes, such as in lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenases in bacteria. The water-soluble compounds are mildly to moderately toxic, but the insoluble ones are not. All isotopes of promethium are radioactive, and it does not occur naturally in the earth&#x27;s crust, except for a trace amount generated by spontaneous fission of uranium-238. They are often found in minerals with thorium, and less commonly uranium.

Though rare-earth elements are technically relatively plentiful in the entire Earth&#x27;s crust (cerium being the 25th-most-abundant element at 68 parts per million, more abundant than copper), in practice this is spread thin across trace impurities, so to obtain rare earths at usable purity requires processing enormous amounts of raw ore at great expense, thus the name &quot;rare&quot; earths.

Because of their geochemical properties, rare-earth elements are typically dispersed and not often found concentrated in rare-earth minerals. Consequently, economically exploitable ore deposits are sparse. The first rare-earth mineral discovered (1787) was gadolinite, a black mineral composed of cerium, yttrium, iron, silicon, and other elements. This mineral was extracted from a mine in the village of Ytterby in Sweden; four of the rare-earth elements bear names derived from this single location.

==Elements==
A table listing the 17 rare-earth elements, their atomic number and symbol, the etymology of their names, and their main uses (see also Applications of lanthanides) is provided here. Some of the rare-earth elements are named after the scientists who discovered them, or elucidated their elemental properties, and some after the geographical locations where discovered.

==Discovery and early history==

Rare earths were mainly discovered as components of minerals. The term &quot;rare&quot; refers to these rarely found minerals and &quot;earth&quot; comes from an old name for oxides, the chemical form for these elements in the mineral. A mineral discovered by Lieutenant Carl Axel Arrhenius in 1787 at a quarry in the village of Ytterby, Sweden. reached Johan Gadolin, a Royal Academy of Turku professor, and his analysis yielded an unknown oxide which he called yttria. 

Anders Gustav Ekeberg isolated beryllium from the gadolinite but failed to recognize other elements in the ore. After this discovery in 1794, a mineral from Bastnäs near Riddarhyttan, Sweden, which was believed to be an iron–tungsten mineral, was re-examined by Jöns Jacob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger. In 1803 they obtained a white oxide and called it ceria. Martin Heinrich Klaproth independently discovered the same oxide and called it &quot;ochroia&quot;. It took another 30 years for researchers to determine that other elements were contained in the two ores ceria and yttria (the similarity of the rare-earth metals&#x27; chemical properties made their separation difficult).

In 1839 Carl Gustav Mosander, an assistant of Berzelius, separated ceria by heating the nitrate and dissolving the product in nitric acid. He called the oxide of the soluble salt &quot;lanthana&quot;. It took him three more years to separate the lanthana further into &quot;didymia&quot; and pure lanthana. Didymia, although not further separable by Mosander&#x27;s techniques, was in fact still a mixture of oxides.

In 1842 Mosander also separated the yttria into three oxides: pure yttria, terbia, and erbia (all the names are derived from the town name &quot;Ytterby&quot;). The earth giving pink salts he called &quot;terbium&quot;; the one that yielded yellow peroxide he called &quot;erbium&quot;.
By then the number of known rare-earth elements had reached six: yttrium, cerium, lanthanum, didymium, erbium, and terbium.

Nils Johan Berlin and Marc Delafontaine tried also to separate the crude yttria and found the same substances that Mosander obtained, but Berlin named (1860) the substance giving pink salts &quot;erbium&quot;, and Delafontaine named the substance with the yellow peroxide &quot;terbium&quot;. This confusion led to several false claims of new elements, such as the &quot;mosandrium&quot; of J. Lawrence Smith, or the &quot;philippium&quot; and &quot;decipium&quot; of Delafontaine. Due to the difficulty in separating the metals (and determining the separation is complete), the total number of false discoveries was dozens, with some putting the total number of discoveries at over a hundred.

===Spectroscopic identification===
There were no further discoveries for 30 years, and the element didymium was listed in the periodic table of elements with a molecular mass of 138. In 1879, Delafontaine used the new physical process of optical flame spectroscopy and found several new spectral lines in didymia. Also in 1879, Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran isolated the new element &quot;samarium&quot; from the mineral samarskite.

The samaria earth was further separated by Lecoq de Boisbaudran in 1886, and a similar result was obtained by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac by direct isolation from samarskite. They named the element &quot;gadolinium&quot; after Johan Gadolin, and its oxide was named &quot;gadolinia&quot;.

Further spectroscopic analysis between 1886 and 1901 of samaria, yttria, and samarskite by William Crookes, Lecoq de Boisbaudran and Eugène-Anatole Demarçay yielded several new spectral lines that indicated the existence of an unknown element. The fractional crystallization of the oxides then yielded &quot;europium&quot; in 1901.

In 1839 the third source for rare earths became available. This is a mineral similar to gadolinite called &quot;uranotantalum&quot; (now called &quot;samarskite&quot;) an oxide of a mixture of elements such as yttrium, ytterbium, iron, uranium, thorium, calcium, niobium, and tantalum. This mineral from Miass in the southern Ural Mountains was documented by Gustav Rose. The Russian chemist R. Harmann proposed that a new element he called &quot;ilmenium&quot; should be present in this mineral, but later, Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand, Galissard de Marignac, and Heinrich Rose found only tantalum and niobium (columbium) in it.

The exact number of rare-earth elements that existed was highly unclear, and a maximum number of 25 was estimated. The use of X-ray spectra (obtained by X-ray crystallography) by Henry Gwyn Jeffreys Moseley made it possible to assign atomic numbers to the elements. Moseley found that the exact number of lanthanides had to be 15, but that element 61 had not yet been discovered. (This is promethium, a radioactive element whose most stable isotope has a half-life of just 18 years.)

Using these facts about atomic numbers from X-ray crystallography, Moseley also showed that hafnium (element 72) would not be a rare-earth element. Moseley was killed in World War I in 1915, years before hafnium was discovered. Hence, the claim of Georges Urbain that he had discovered element 72 was untrue. Hafnium is an element that lies in the periodic table immediately below zirconium, and hafnium and zirconium have very similar chemical and physical properties.

==Sources and purification==
During the 1940s, Frank Spedding and others in the United States (during the Manhattan Project) developed chemical ion-exchange procedures for separating and purifying rare-earth elements. This method was first applied to the actinides for separating plutonium-239 and neptunium from uranium, thorium, actinium, and the other actinides in the materials produced in nuclear reactors. Plutonium-239 was very desirable because it is a fissile material.

The principal sources of rare-earth elements are the minerals bastnäsite (, where R is a mixture of rare-earth elements), monazite (, where X is a mixture of rare-earth elements and sometimes thorium), and loparite (), and the lateritic ion-adsorption clays. Despite their high relative abundance, rare-earth minerals are more difficult to mine and extract than equivalent sources of transition metals (due in part to their similar chemical properties), making the rare-earth elements relatively expensive. Their industrial use was very limited until efficient separation techniques were developed, such as ion exchange, fractional crystallization, and liquid–liquid extraction during the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Some ilmenite concentrates contain small amounts of scandium and other rare-earth elements, which could be analysed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF).

==Classification==
Before the time that ion exchange methods and elution were available, the separation of the rare earths was primarily achieved by repeated precipitation or crystallization. In those days, the first separation was into two main groups, the cerium earths (lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, and samarium) and the yttrium earths (scandium, yttrium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium). Europium, gadolinium, and terbium were either considered as a separate group of rare-earth elements (the terbium group), or europium was included in the cerium group, and gadolinium and terbium were included in the yttrium group. In the latter case, the f-block elements are split into half: the first half (La–Eu) form the cerium group, and the second half (Gd–Yb) together with group 3 (Sc, Y, Lu) form the yttrium group. The reason for this division arose from the difference in solubility of rare-earth double sulfates with sodium and potassium. The sodium double sulfates of the cerium group are poorly soluble, those of the terbium group slightly, and those of the yttrium group are very soluble. Sometimes, the yttrium group was further split into the erbium group (dysprosium, holmium, erbium, and thulium) and the ytterbium group (ytterbium and lutetium), but today the main grouping is between the cerium and the yttrium groups. Today, the rare-earth elements are classified as light or heavy rare-earth elements, rather than in cerium and yttrium groups.

===Light versus heavy classification===
The classification of rare-earth elements is inconsistent between authors. The most common distinction between rare-earth elements is made by atomic numbers; those with low atomic numbers are referred to as light rare-earth elements (LREE), those with high atomic numbers are the heavy rare-earth elements (HREE), and those that fall in between are typically referred to as the middle rare-earth elements (MREE). Commonly, rare-earth elements with atomic numbers 57 to 61 (lanthanum to promethium) are classified as light and those with atomic numbers 62 and greater are classified as heavy rare-earth elements. Increasing atomic numbers between light and heavy rare-earth elements and decreasing atomic radii throughout the series causes chemical variations. Europium is exempt of this classification as it has two valence states: Eu and Eu. Yttrium is grouped as heavy rare-earth element due to chemical similarities. The break between the two groups is sometimes put elsewhere, such as between elements 63 (europium) and 64 (gadolinium). The actual metallic densities of these two groups overlap, with the &quot;light&quot; group having densities from 6.145 (lanthanum) to 7.26 (promethium) or 7.52 (samarium) g/cc, and the &quot;heavy&quot; group from 6.965 (ytterbium) to 9.32 (thulium), as well as including yttrium at 4.47. Europium has a density of 5.24.

==Origin==
Rare-earth elements, except scandium, are heavier than iron and thus are produced by supernova nucleosynthesis or by the s-process in asymptotic giant branch stars. In nature, spontaneous fission of uranium-238 produces trace amounts of radioactive promethium, but most promethium is synthetically produced in nuclear reactors.

Due to their chemical similarity, the concentrations of rare earths in rocks are only slowly changed by geochemical processes, making their proportions useful for geochronology and dating fossils.

==Compounds==
Rare-earth elements occur in nature in combination with phosphate (monazite), carbonate-fluoride (bastnäsite), and oxygen anions.

In their oxides, most rare-earth elements only have a valence of 3 and form sesquioxides (cerium forms ). Five different crystal structures are known, depending on the element and the temperature. The X-phase and the H-phase are only stable above 2000 K. At lower temperatures, there are the hexagonal A-phase, the monoclinic B-phase, and the cubic C-phase, which is the stable form at room temperature for most of the elements. The C-phase was once thought to be in space group &quot;I&quot;23 (no. 199), but is now known to be in space group &quot;Ia&quot; (no. 206). The structure is similar to that of fluorite or cerium dioxide (in which the cations form a face-centred cubic lattice and the anions sit inside the tetrahedra of cations), except that one-quarter of the anions (oxygen) are missing. The unit cell of these sesquioxides corresponds to eight unit cells of fluorite or cerium dioxide, with 32 cations instead of 4. This is called the bixbyite structure, as it occurs in a mineral of that name ().

==Geological distribution==

As seen in the chart, rare-earth elements are found on Earth at similar concentrations to many common transition metals. The most abundant rare-earth element is cerium, which is actually the 25th most abundant element in Earth&#x27;s crust, having 68 parts per million (about as common as copper). The exception is the highly unstable and radioactive promethium &quot;rare earth&quot; is quite scarce. The longest-lived isotope of promethium has a half-life of 17.7 years, so the element exists in nature in only negligible amounts (approximately 572 g in the entire Earth&#x27;s crust). Promethium is one of the two elements that do not have stable (non-radioactive) isotopes and are followed by (i.e. with higher atomic number) stable elements (the other being technetium).

The rare-earth elements are often found together. During the sequential accretion of the Earth, the dense rare-earth elements were incorporated into the deeper portions of the planet. Early differentiation of molten material largely incorporated the rare earths into mantle rocks. The high field strength and large ionic radii of rare earths make them incompatible with the crystal lattices of most rock-forming minerals, so REE will undergo strong partitioning into a melt phase if one is present. REE are chemically very similar and have always been difficult to separate, but the gradual decrease in ionic radius from light REE (LREE) to heavy REE (HREE), called the lanthanide contraction, can produce a broad separation between light and heavy REE. The larger ionic radii of LREE make them generally more incompatible than HREE in rock-forming minerals, and will partition more strongly into a melt phase, while HREE may prefer to remain in the crystalline residue, particularly if it contains HREE-compatible minerals like garnet. The result is that all magma formed from partial melting will always have greater concentrations of LREE than HREE, and individual minerals may be dominated by either HREE or LREE, depending on which range of ionic radii best fits the crystal lattice.

Among the anhydrous rare-earth phosphates, it is the tetragonal mineral xenotime that incorporates yttrium and the HREE, whereas the monoclinic monazite phase incorporates cerium and the LREE preferentially. The smaller size of the HREE allows greater solid solubility in the rock-forming minerals that make up Earth&#x27;s mantle, and thus yttrium and the HREE show less enrichment in Earth&#x27;s crust relative to chondritic abundance than does cerium and the LREE. This has economic consequences: large ore bodies of LREE are known around the world and are being exploited. Ore bodies for HREE are more rare, smaller, and less concentrated. Most of the current supply of HREE originates in the &quot;ion-absorption clay&quot; ores of Southern China. Some versions provide concentrates containing about 65% yttrium oxide, with the HREE being present in ratios reflecting the Oddo–Harkins rule: even-numbered REE at abundances of about 5% each, and odd-numbered REE at abundances of about 1% each. Similar compositions are found in xenotime or gadolinite.

Well-known minerals containing yttrium, and other HREE, include gadolinite, xenotime, samarskite, euxenite, fergusonite, yttrotantalite, yttrotungstite, yttrofluorite (a variety of fluorite), thalenite, and yttrialite. Small amounts occur in zircon, which derives its typical yellow fluorescence from some of the accompanying HREE. The zirconium mineral eudialyte, such as is found in southern Greenland, contains small but potentially useful amounts of yttrium. Of the above yttrium minerals, most played a part in providing research quantities of lanthanides during the discovery days. Xenotime is occasionally recovered as a byproduct of heavy-sand processing, but is not as abundant as the similarly recovered monazite (which typically contains a few percent of yttrium). Uranium ores from Ontario have occasionally yielded yttrium as a byproduct.

Well-known minerals containing cerium, and other LREE, include bastnäsite, monazite, allanite, loparite, ancylite, parisite, lanthanite, chevkinite, cerite, stillwellite, britholite, fluocerite, and cerianite. Monazite (marine sands from Brazil, India, or Australia; rock from South Africa), bastnäsite (from Mountain Pass rare earth mine, or several localities in China), and loparite (Kola Peninsula, Russia) have been the principal ores of cerium and the light lanthanides.

Enriched deposits of rare-earth elements at the surface of the Earth, carbonatites and pegmatites, are related to alkaline plutonism, an uncommon kind of magmatism that occurs in tectonic settings where there is rifting or that are near subduction zones. In a rift setting, the alkaline magma is produced by very small degrees of partial melting (&lt;1%) of garnet peridotite in the upper mantle (200 to 600 km depth). This melt becomes enriched in incompatible elements, like the rare-earth elements, by leaching them out of the crystalline residue. The resultant magma rises as a diapir, or diatreme, along pre-existing fractures, and can be emplaced deep in the crust, or erupted at the surface. Typical REE enriched deposits types forming in rift settings are carbonatites, and A- and M-Type granitoids. Near subduction zones, partial melting of the subducting plate within the asthenosphere (80 to 200 km depth) produces a volatile-rich magma (high concentrations of and water), with high concentrations of alkaline elements, and high element mobility that the rare earths are strongly partitioned into. This melt may also rise along pre-existing fractures, and be emplaced in the crust above the subducting slab or erupted at the surface. REE-enriched deposits forming from these melts are typically S-Type granitoids.

Alkaline magmas enriched with rare-earth elements include carbonatites, peralkaline granites (pegmatites), and nepheline syenite. Carbonatites crystallize from -rich fluids, which can be produced by partial melting of hydrous-carbonated lherzolite to produce a CO-rich primary magma, by fractional crystallization of an alkaline primary magma, or by separation of a -rich immiscible liquid from. These liquids are most commonly forming in association with very deep Precambrian cratons, like the ones found in Africa and the Canadian Shield. Ferrocarbonatites are the most common type of carbonatite to be enriched in REE, and are often emplaced as late-stage, brecciated pipes at the core of igneous complexes; they consist of fine-grained calcite and hematite, sometimes with significant concentrations of ankerite and minor concentrations of siderite. Large carbonatite deposits enriched in rare-earth elements include Mount Weld in Australia, Thor Lake in Canada, Zandkopsdrift in South Africa, and Mountain Pass in the USA. Peralkaline granites (A-Type granitoids) have very high concentrations of alkaline elements and very low concentrations of phosphorus; they are deposited at moderate depths in extensional zones, often as igneous ring complexes, or as pipes, massive bodies, and lenses. These fluids have very low viscosities and high element mobility, which allows for the crystallization of large grains, despite a relatively short crystallization time upon emplacement; their large grain size is why these deposits are commonly referred to as pegmatites. Economically viable pegmatites are divided into Lithium-Cesium-Tantalum (LCT) and Niobium-Yttrium-Fluorine (NYF) types; NYF types are enriched in rare-earth minerals. Examples of rare-earth pegmatite deposits include Strange Lake in Canada and Khaladean-Buregtey in Mongolia. Nepheline syenite (M-Type granitoids) deposits are 90% feldspar and feldspathoid minerals. They are deposited in small, circular massifs and contain high concentrations of rare-earth-bearing accessory minerals. For the most part, these deposits are small but important examples include Illimaussaq-Kvanefeld in Greenland, and Lovozera in Russia.

Rare-earth elements can also be enriched in deposits by secondary alteration either by interactions with hydrothermal fluids or meteoric water or by erosion and transport of resistate REE-bearing minerals. Argillization of primary minerals enriches insoluble elements by leaching out silica and other soluble elements, recrystallizing feldspar into clay minerals such kaolinite, halloysite, and montmorillonite. In tropical regions where precipitation is high, weathering forms a thick argillized regolith, this process is called supergene enrichment and produces laterite deposits; heavy rare-earth elements are incorporated into the residual clay by absorption. This kind of deposit is only mined for REE in Southern China, where the majority of global heavy rare-earth element production occurs. REE-laterites do form elsewhere, including over the carbonatite at Mount Weld in Australia. REE may also be extracted from placer deposits if the sedimentary parent lithology contains REE-bearing, heavy resistate minerals.

In 2011, Yasuhiro Kato, a geologist at the University of Tokyo who led a study of Pacific Ocean seabed mud, published results indicating the mud could hold rich concentrations of rare-earth minerals. The deposits, studied at 78 sites, came from &quot;[h]ot plumes from hydrothermal vents pull[ing] these materials out of seawater and deposit[ing] them on the seafloor, bit by bit, over tens of millions of years. One square patch of metal-rich mud 2.3 kilometers wide might contain enough rare earths to meet most of the global demand for a year, Japanese geologists report in &quot;Nature Geoscience&quot;.&quot; &quot;I believe that rare[-]earth resources undersea are much more promising than on-land resources,&quot; said Kato. &quot;[C]oncentrations of rare earths were comparable to those found in clays mined in China. Some deposits contained twice as much heavy rare earths such as dysprosium, a component of magnets in hybrid car motors.&quot;

The global demand for rare-earth elements (REEs) is expected to increase more than fivefold by 2030.

==Geochemistry==
The REE geochemical classification is usually done on the basis of their atomic weight. One of the most common classifications divides REE into 3 groups: light rare earths (LREE - from 57La to 60Nd), intermediate (MREE - from 62Sm to 67Ho) and heavy (HREE - from 68Er to 71Lu). REE usually appear as trivalent ions, except for Ce and Eu which can take the form of Ce4+ and Eu2+ depending on the redox conditions of the system. Consequentially, REE are characterized by a substantial identity in their chemical reactivity, which results in a serial behaviour during geochemical processes rather than being characteristic of a single element of the series. Sc, Y, and Lu can be electronically distinguished from the other rare earths because they do not have &quot;f&quot; valence electrons, whereas the others do, but the chemical behaviour is almost the same.

A distinguishing factor in the geochemical behaviour of the REE is linked to the so-called &quot;lanthanide contraction&quot; which represents a higher-than-expected decrease in the atomic/ionic radius of the elements along the series. This is determined by the variation of the shielding effect towards the nuclear charge due to the progressive filling of the 4&quot;f&quot; orbital which acts against the electrons of the 6&quot;s&quot; and 5&quot;d&quot; orbitals. The lanthanide contraction has a direct effect on the geochemistry of the lanthanides, which show a different behaviour depending on the systems and processes in which they are involved. The effect of the lanthanide contraction can be observed in the REE behaviour both in a CHARAC-type geochemical system (CHArge-and-RAdius-Controlled) where elements with similar charge and radius should show coherent geochemical behaviour, and in non-CHARAC systems, such as aqueous solutions, where the electron structure is also an important parameter to consider as the lanthanide contraction affects the ionic potential. A direct consequence is that, during the formation of coordination bonds, the REE behaviour gradually changes along the series. Furthermore, the lanthanide contraction causes the ionic radius of Ho3+ (0.901 Å) to be almost identical to that of Y3+ (0.9 Å), justifying the inclusion of the latter among the REE.

===Applications===
The application of rare-earth elements to geology is important to understanding the petrological processes of igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rock formation. In geochemistry, rare-earth elements can be used to infer the petrological mechanisms that have affected a rock due to the subtle atomic size differences between the elements, which causes preferential fractionation of some rare earths relative to others depending on the processes at work.

The geochemical study of the REE is not carried out on absolute concentrations – as it is usually done with other chemical elements – but on normalized concentrations in order to observe their serial behaviour. In geochemistry, rare-earth elements are typically presented in normalized &quot;spider&quot; diagrams, in which concentration of rare-earth elements are normalized to a reference standard and are then expressed as the logarithm to the base 10 of the value.

Commonly, the rare-earth elements are normalized to chondritic meteorites, as these are believed to be the closest representation of unfractionated Solar System material. However, other normalizing standards can be applied depending on the purpose of the study. Normalization to a standard reference value, especially of a material believed to be unfractionated, allows the observed abundances to be compared to the initial abundances of the element. Normalization also removes the pronounced &#x27;zig-zag&#x27; pattern caused by the differences in abundance between even and odd atomic numbers. Normalization is carried out by dividing the analytical concentrations of each element of the series by the concentration of the same element in a given standard, according to the equation:
:formula_1

where n indicates the normalized concentration, formula_2 the analytical concentration of the element measured in the sample, and formula_3 the concentration of the same element in the reference material.

It is possible to observe the serial trend of the REE by reporting their normalized concentrations against the atomic number. The trends that are observed in &quot;spider&quot; diagrams are typically referred to as &quot;patterns&quot;, which may be diagnostic of petrological processes that have affected the material of interest.

According to the general shape of the patterns or thanks to the presence (or absence) of so-called &quot;anomalies&quot;, information regarding the system under examination and the occurring geochemical processes can be obtained. The anomalies represent enrichment (positive anomalies) or depletion (negative anomalies) of specific elements along the series and are graphically recognizable as positive or negative &quot;peaks&quot; along the REE patterns. The anomalies can be numerically quantified as the ratio between the normalized concentration of the element showing the anomaly and the predictable one based on the average of the normalized concentrations of the two elements in the previous and next position in the series, according to the equation:
:formula_4

where formula_5 is the normalized concentration of the element whose anomaly has to be calculated, formula_6 and formula_7 the normalized concentrations of the respectively previous and next elements along the series.

The rare-earth elements patterns observed in igneous rocks are primarily a function of the chemistry of the source where the rock came from, as well as the fractionation history the rock has undergone. Fractionation is in turn a function of the partition coefficients of each element. Partition coefficients are responsible for the fractionation of trace elements (including rare-earth elements) into the liquid phase (the melt/magma) into the solid phase (the mineral). If an element preferentially remains in the solid phase it is termed &#x27;compatible&#x27;, and if it preferentially partitions into the melt phase it is described as &#x27;incompatible&#x27;. Each element has a different partition coefficient, and therefore fractionates into solid and liquid phases distinctly. These concepts are also applicable to metamorphic and sedimentary petrology.

In igneous rocks, particularly in felsic melts, the following observations apply: anomalies in europium are dominated by the crystallization of feldspars. Hornblende, controls the enrichment of MREE compared to LREE and HREE. Depletion of LREE relative to HREE may be due to the crystallization of olivine, orthopyroxene, and clinopyroxene. On the other hand, the depletion of HREE relative to LREE may be due to the presence of garnet, as garnet preferentially incorporates HREE into its crystal structure. The presence of zircon may also cause a similar effect.

In sedimentary rocks, rare-earth elements in clastic sediments are a representation of provenance. The rare-earth element concentrations are not typically affected by sea and river waters, as rare-earth elements are insoluble and thus have very low concentrations in these fluids. As a result, when sediment is transported, rare-earth element concentrations are unaffected by the fluid and instead the rock retains the rare-earth element concentration from its source.

Sea and river waters typically have low rare-earth element concentrations. However, aqueous geochemistry is still very important. In oceans, rare-earth elements reflect input from rivers, hydrothermal vents, and aeolian sources; this is important in the investigation of ocean mixing and circulation.

Rare-earth elements are also useful for dating rocks, as some radioactive isotopes display long half-lives. Of particular interest are the La-Ce, Sm-Nd, and Lu-Hf systems.

==Production==

Until 1948, most of the world&#x27;s rare earths were sourced from placer sand deposits in India and Brazil. Through the 1950s, South Africa was the world&#x27;s rare earth source, from a monazite-rich reef at the Steenkampskraal mine in Western Cape province. Through the 1960s until the 1980s, the Mountain Pass rare earth mine in California made the United States the leading producer. Today, the Indian and South African deposits still produce some rare-earth concentrates, but they were dwarfed by the scale of Chinese production. In 2017, China produced 81% of the world&#x27;s rare-earth supply, mostly in Inner Mongolia, although it had only 36.7% of reserves. Australia was the second and only other major producer with 15% of world production. All of the world&#x27;s heavy rare earths (such as dysprosium) come from Chinese rare-earth sources such as the polymetallic Bayan Obo deposit. The Browns Range mine, located 160 km south east of Halls Creek in northern Western Australia, was under development in 2018 and is positioned to become the first significant dysprosium producer outside of China.

REE is increasing in demand due to the fact that they are essential for new and innovative technology that is being created. These new products that need REEs to be produced are high-technology equipment such as smart phones, digital cameras, computer parts, semiconductors, etc. In addition, these elements are more prevalent in the following industries: renewable energy technology, military equipment, glass making, and metallurgy.
Increased demand has strained supply, and there is growing concern that the world may soon face a shortage of the rare earths. In several years from 2009 worldwide demand for rare-earth elements is expected to exceed supply by 40,000 metric tons annually unless major new sources are developed. In 2013, it was stated that the demand for REEs would increase due to the dependence of the EU on these elements, the fact that rare-earth elements cannot be substituted by other elements and that REEs have a low recycling rate. Furthermore, due to the increased demand and low supply, future prices are expected to increase and there is a chance that countries other than China will open REE mines. In addition there are over a hundred ongoing mining projects with many options outside of China.

===China===
These concerns have intensified due to the actions of China, the predominant supplier. Specifically, China has announced regulations on exports and a crackdown on smuggling. On September 1, 2009, China announced plans to reduce its export quota to 35,000 tons per year in 2010–2015 to conserve scarce resources and protect the environment. On October 19, 2010, &quot;China Daily&quot;, citing an unnamed Ministry of Commerce official, reported that China will &quot;further reduce quotas for rare-earth exports by 30 percent at most next year to protect the precious metals from over-exploitation.&quot; The government in Beijing further increased its control by forcing smaller, independent miners to merge into state-owned corporations or face closure. At the end of 2010, China announced that the first round of export quotas in 2011 for rare earths would be 14,446 tons, which was a 35% decrease from the previous first round of quotas in 2010. China announced further export quotas on 14 July 2011 for the second half of the year with total allocation at 30,184 tons with total production capped at 93,800 metric tons. In September 2011, China announced the halt in production of three of its eight major rare-earth mines, responsible for almost 40% of China&#x27;s total rare-earth production. In March 2012, the US, EU, and Japan confronted China at WTO about these export and production restrictions. China responded with claims that the restrictions had environmental protection in mind. In August 2012, China announced a further 20% reduction in production.
The United States, Japan, and the European Union filed a joint lawsuit with the World Trade Organization in 2012 against China, arguing that China should not be able to deny such important exports.

In response to the opening of new mines in other countries (Lynas in Australia and Molycorp in the United States), prices of rare earths dropped.
The price of dysprosium oxide was US$994/kg in 2011, but dropped to US$265/kg by 2014.

On August 29, 2014, the WTO ruled that China had broken free-trade agreements, and the WTO said in the summary of key findings that &quot;the overall effect of the foreign and domestic restrictions is to encourage domestic extraction and secure preferential use of those materials by Chinese manufacturers.&quot; China declared that it would implement the ruling on September 26, 2014, but would need some time to do so. By January 5, 2015, China had lifted all quotas from the export of rare earths, but export licenses will still be required.

In 2019, China supplied between 85% and 95% of the global demand for the 17 rare-earth powders, half of them sourced from Myanmar. After the 2021 military coup in that country, future supplies of critical ores were possibly constrained. Additionally, it was speculated that the PRC could again reduce rare-earth exports to counter-act economic sanctions imposed by the US and EU countries. Rare-earth metals serve as crucial materials for electric vehicle manufacturing and high-tech military applications.

===Myanmar (Burma)===
Kachin State in Myanmar is the world&#x27;s largest source of rare earths. In 2021, China imported of rare earths from Myanmar in December 2021, exceeding 20,000 metric tons. Rare earths were discovered near Pang War in Chipwi Township along the China–Myanmar border in the late 2010s. As China has shut down domestic mines due to the detrimental environmental impact, it has largely outsourced rare-earth mining to Kachin State. Chinese companies and miners illegally set up operations in Kachin State without government permits, and instead circumvent the central government by working with a Border Guard Force militia under the Tatmadaw, formerly known as the New Democratic Army – Kachin, which has profited from this extractive industry. , 2,700 mining collection pools scattered across 300 separate locations were found in Kachin State, encompassing the area of Singapore, and an exponential increase from 2016. Land has also been seized from locals to conduct mining operations.

===Other countries===
As a result of the increased demand and tightening restrictions on exports of the metals from China, some countries are stockpiling rare-earth resources. Searches for alternative sources in Australia, Brazil, Canada, South Africa, Tanzania, Greenland, and the United States are ongoing. Mines in these countries were closed when China undercut world prices in the 1990s, and it will take a few years to restart production as there are many barriers to entry. Significant sites under development outside China include Steenkampskraal in South Africa, the world&#x27;s highest grade rare earths and thorium mine, closed in 1963, but has been gearing to go back into production. Over 80% of the infrastructure is already complete. Other mines include the Nolans Project in Central Australia, the Bokan Mountain project in Alaska, the remote Hoidas Lake project in northern Canada, and the Mount Weld project in Australia. The Hoidas Lake project has the potential to supply about 10% of the $1 billion of REE consumption that occurs in North America every year. Vietnam signed an agreement in October 2010 to supply Japan with rare earths from its northwestern Lai Châu Province, however the deal was never realized due to disagreements.

The largest rare-earth deposit in the U.S. is at Mountain Pass, California, sixty miles south of Las Vegas. Originally opened by Molycorp, the deposit has been mined, off and on, since 1951. A second large deposit of REEs at Elk Creek in southeast Nebraska is under consideration by NioCorp Development Ltd who hopes to open a niobium, scandium, and titanium mine there. That mine may be able to produce as much as 7200 metric tons of ferro niobium and 95 metric tons of scandium trioxide annually, although, as of 2022, financing is still in the works.

In the UK, Pensana has begun construction of their US$195 million rare-earth processing plant which secured funding from the UK government&#x27;s Automotive Transformation Fund. The plant will process ore from the Longonjo mine in Angola and other sources as they become available. The company are targeting production in late 2023, before ramping up to full capacity in 2024. Pensana aim to produce 12,500 metric tons of separated rare earths, including 4,500 metric tons of magnet metal rare earths.

Also under consideration for mining are sites such as Thor Lake in the Northwest Territories, and various locations in Vietnam. Additionally, in 2010, a large deposit of rare-earth minerals was discovered in Kvanefjeld in southern Greenland. Pre-feasibility drilling at this site has confirmed significant quantities of black lujavrite, which contains about 1% rare-earth oxides (REO). The European Union has urged Greenland to restrict Chinese development of rare-earth projects there, but as of early 2013, the government of Greenland has said that it has no plans to impose such restrictions. Many Danish politicians have expressed concerns that other nations, including China, could gain influence in thinly populated Greenland, given the number of foreign workers and investment that could come from Chinese companies in the near future because of the law passed December 2012.

In central Spain, Ciudad Real Province, the proposed rare-earth mining project &#x27;Matamulas&#x27; may provide, according to its developers, up to 2,100 Tn/year (33% of the annual UE demand). However, this project has been suspended by regional authorities due to social and environmental concerns.

Adding to potential mine sites, ASX listed Peak Resources announced in February 2012, that their Tanzanian-based Ngualla project contained not only the 6th largest deposit by tonnage outside of China but also the highest grade of rare-earth elements of the 6.

North Korea has been reported to have exported rare-earth ore to China, about US$1.88 million worth during May and June 2014.

In May 2012, researchers from two universities in Japan announced that they had discovered rare earths in Ehime Prefecture, Japan.

On 12 January 2023, Swedish state-owned mining company LKAB announced that it had discovered a deposit of over 1 million metric tons of rare earths in the country&#x27;s Kiruna area, which would make it the largest such deposit in Europe.

China processes about 90% of the world&#x27;s REEs and 60% of the world&#x27;s lithium. As a result, the European Union imports practically all of its rare earth elements from China. The EU Critical Raw Materials Act of 2023 has set in action the required policy adjustments for Europe to start producing two-thirds of the lithium-ion batteries required for electric vehicles and energy storage. In 2024, an EU backed lithium mining project created large scale protests in Serbia.

In 2024 American Rare Earths Inc. disclosed that its reserves near Wheatland Wyoming totaled 2.34 billion metric tons, possibly the world&#x27;s largest and larger than a separate 1.2 million metric ton deposit in northeastern Wyoming.

In June 2024, Rare Earths Norway found a rare-earth oxide deposit of 8.8 million metric tons in Telemark, Norway, making it Europe&#x27;s largest known rare-earth element deposit. The mining firm predicted that it would finish developing the first stage of mining in 2030.

====Malaysian refining plans====
In early 2011, Australian mining company Lynas was reported to be &quot;hurrying to finish&quot; a US$230 million rare-earth refinery on the eastern coast of Peninsular Malaysia&#x27;s industrial port of Kuantan. The plant would refine ore — lanthanides concentrate from the Mount Weld mine in Australia. The ore would be trucked to Fremantle and transported by container ship to Kuantan. Within two years, Lynas was said to expect the refinery to be able to meet nearly a third of the world&#x27;s demand for rare-earth materials, not counting China. The Kuantan development brought renewed attention to the Malaysian town of Bukit Merah in Perak, where a rare-earth mine operated by a Mitsubishi Chemical subsidiary, Asian Rare Earth, closed in 1994 and left continuing environmental and health concerns. In mid-2011, after protests, Malaysian government restrictions on the Lynas plant were announced. At that time, citing subscription-only &quot;Dow Jones Newswire&quot; reports, a &quot;Barrons&quot; report said the Lynas investment was $730 million, and the projected share of the global market it would fill put at &quot;about a sixth.&quot; An independent review initiated by the Malaysian Government, and conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 2011 to address concerns of radioactive hazards, found no non-compliance with international radiation safety standards.

However, the Malaysian authorities confirmed that as of October 2011, Lynas was not given any permit to import any rare-earth ore into Malaysia. On February 2, 2012, the Malaysian AELB (Atomic Energy Licensing Board) recommended that Lynas be issued a temporary operating license subject to meeting a number of conditions. On 2 September 2014, Lynas was issued a 2-year full operating stage license by the AELB.

On November 17 2024, economy minister Rafizi Ramli said he hoped Malaysia is able to produce rare-earth elements within three years, through discussions with China to provide technology. In the past, plans to mine rare-earth elements at Kedah caused concerns of destroying forest reserves and harming water catchment areas.

===Other sources===

====Mine tailings====
Significant quantities of rare-earth oxides are found in tailings accumulated from 50 years of uranium ore, shale, and loparite mining at Sillamäe, Estonia. Due to the rising prices of rare earths, extraction of these oxides has become economically viable. The country currently exports around 3,000 metric tons per year, representing around 2% of world production. Similar resources are suspected in the western United States, where gold rush-era mines are believed to have discarded large amounts of rare earths, because they had no value at the time.

====Ocean mining====
In January 2013 a Japanese deep-sea research vessel obtained seven deep-sea mud core samples from the Pacific Ocean seafloor at 5,600 to 5,800 meters depth, approximately south of the island of Minami-Tori-Shima. The research team found a mud layer 2 to 4 meters beneath the seabed with concentrations of up to 0.66% rare-earth oxides. A potential deposit might compare in grade with the ion-absorption-type deposits in southern China that provide the bulk of Chinese REO mine production, which grade in the range of 0.05% to 0.5% REO.

====Waste and recycling====
Another recently developed source of rare earths is electronic waste and other wastes that have significant rare-earth components. Advances in recycling technology have made the extraction of rare earths from these materials less expensive. Recycling plants operate in Japan, where an estimated 300,000 tons of rare earths are found in unused electronics. In France, the Rhodia group is setting up two factories, in La Rochelle and Saint-Fons, that will produce 200 tons of rare earths a year from used fluorescent lamps, magnets, and batteries. Coal and coal by-products, such as ash and sludge, are a potential source of critical elements including rare-earth elements (REE) with estimated amounts in the range of 50 million metric tons.

===Methods===
One study mixed fly ash with carbon black and then sent a 1-second current pulse through the mixture, heating it to . The fly ash contains microscopic bits of glass that encapsulate the metals. The heat shatters the glass, exposing the rare earths. Flash heating also converts phosphates into oxides, which are more soluble and extractable. Using hydrochloric acid at concentrations less than 1% of conventional methods, the process extracted twice as much material.

==Properties==
According to chemistry professor Andrea Sella, rare-earth elements differ from other elements, in that when looked at analytically, they are virtually inseparable, having almost the same chemical properties. However, in terms of their electronic and magnetic properties, each one occupies a unique technological niche that nothing else can. For example, &quot;the rare-earth elements praseodymium (Pr) and neodymium (Nd) can both be embedded inside glass and they completely cut out the glare from the flame when one is doing glass-blowing.&quot;

==Uses==


The uses, applications, and demand for rare-earth elements have expanded over the years. Globally, most REEs are used for catalysts and magnets. In the US, more than half of REEs are used for catalysts; ceramics, glass, and polishing are also main uses.

Other important uses of rare-earth elements are applicable to the production of high-performance magnets, alloys, glasses, and electronics. Ce and La are important as catalysts, and are used for petroleum refining and as diesel additives. Nd is important in magnet production in traditional and low-carbon technologies. Rare-earth elements in this category are used in the electric motors of hybrid and electric vehicles, generators in some wind turbines, hard disc drives, portable electronics, microphones, and speakers.

Ce, La, and Nd are important in alloy making, and in the production of fuel cells and nickel-metal hydride batteries. Ce, Ga, and Nd are important in electronics and are used in the production of LCD and plasma screens, fiber optics, and lasers, and in medical imaging. Additional uses for rare-earth elements are as tracers in medical applications, fertilizers, and in water treatment.

REEs have been used in agriculture to increase plant growth, productivity, and stress resistance seemingly without negative effects for human and animal consumption. REEs are used in agriculture through REE-enriched fertilizers which is a widely used practice in China. In addition, REEs are feed additives for livestock which has resulted in increased production such as larger animals and a higher production of eggs and dairy products. However, this practice has resulted in REE bioaccumulation within livestock and has impacted vegetation and algae growth in these agricultural areas. Additionally while no ill effects have been observed at current low concentrations the effects over the long term and with accumulation over time are unknown prompting some calls for more research into their possible effects.

==Environmental considerations==
REEs are naturally found in very low concentrations in the environment. Mines are often in countries where environmental and social standards are very low, leading to human rights violations, deforestation, and contamination of land and water. Generally, it is estimated that extracting 1 metric ton of rare earth element creates around 2,000 metric tons of waste, partly toxic, including 1 ton of radioactive waste. The largest mining site of REEs, Bayan Obo in China produced more than 70,000 tons of radioactive waste, that contaminated ground water.

Near mining and industrial sites, the concentrations of REEs can rise to many times the normal background levels. Once in the environment, REEs can leach into the soil where their transport is determined by numerous factors such as erosion, weathering, pH, precipitation, groundwater, etc. Acting much like metals, they can speciate depending on the soil condition being either motile or adsorbed to soil particles. Depending on their bio-availability, REEs can be absorbed into plants and later consumed by humans and animals. The mining of REEs, use of REE-enriched fertilizers, and the production of phosphorus fertilizers all contribute to REE contamination. Furthermore, strong acids are used during the extraction process of REEs, which can then leach out into the environment and be transported through water bodies and result in the acidification of aquatic environments. Another additive of REE mining that contributes to REE environmental contamination is cerium oxide (), which is produced during the combustion of diesel and released as exhaust, contributing heavily to soil and water contamination.
Mining, refining, and recycling of rare earths have serious environmental consequences if not properly managed. Low-level radioactive tailings resulting from the occurrence of thorium and uranium in rare-earth ores present a potential hazard and improper handling of these substances can result in extensive environmental damage. In May 2010, China announced a major, five-month crackdown on illegal mining in order to protect the environment and its resources. This campaign is expected to be concentrated in the South, where mines – commonly small, rural, and illegal operations – are particularly prone to releasing toxic waste into the general water supply. However, even the major operation in Baotou, in Inner Mongolia, where much of the world&#x27;s rare-earth supply is refined, has caused major environmental damage. China&#x27;s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology estimated that cleanup costs in Jiangxi province at $5.5 billion.

It is, however, possible to filter out and recover any rare-earth elements that flow out with the wastewater from mining facilities. However, such filtering and recovery equipment may not always be present on the outlets carrying the wastewater.

===Recycling and reusing REEs===
REEs are amongst the most critical elements to modern technologies and society. Despite this, typically only around 1% of REEs are recycled from end-products. Recycling and reusing REEs is not easy: these elements are mostly present in tiny amounts in small electronic parts and they are difficult to separate chemically. For example, recovery of neodymium requires manual disassembly of hard disk drives because shredding the drives only recovers 10% of the REE.

REE recycling and reuse have been increasingly focused on in recent years. The main concerns include environmental pollution during REE recycling and increasing recycling efficiency. Literature published in 2004 suggests that, along with previously established pollution mitigation, a more circular supply chain would help mitigate some of the pollution at the extraction point. This means recycling and reusing REEs that are already in use or reaching the end of their life cycle. A study published in 2014 suggests a method to recycle REEs from waste nickel-metal hydride batteries, demonstrating a recovery rate of 95.16%. Rare-earth elements could also be recovered from industrial wastes with practical potential to reduce environmental and health impacts from mining, waste generation, and imports if known and experimental processes are scaled up. A study suggests that &quot;fulfillment of the circular economy approach could reduce up to 200 times the impact in the climate change category and up to 70 times the cost due to the REE mining.&quot; In most of the reported studies reviewed by a scientific review, &quot;secondary waste is subjected to chemical and or bioleaching followed by solvent extraction processes for clean separation of REEs.&quot;

Currently, people take two essential resources into consideration for the secure supply of REEs: one is to extract REEs from primary resources like mines harboring REE-bearing ores, regolith-hosted clay deposits, ocean bed sediments, coal fly ash, etc. A work developed a green system for recovery of REEs from coal fly ash by using citrate and oxalate who are strong organic ligand and capable of complexing or precipItating with REE. The other one is from secondary resources such as electronic, industrial waste and municipal waste. E-waste contains a significant concentration of REEs, and thus is the primary option for REE recycling now. According to a study, approximately 50 million metric tons of electronic waste are dumped in landfills worldwide each year. Despite the fact that e-waste contains a significant amount of rare-earth elements (REE), only 12.5% of e-waste is currently being recycled for all metals.

===Impact of REE contamination===
====On vegetation====
The mining of REEs has caused the contamination of soil and water around production areas, which has impacted vegetation in these areas by decreasing chlorophyll production, which affects photosynthesis and inhibits the growth of the plants. However, the impact of REE contamination on vegetation is dependent on the plants present in the contaminated environment: not all plants retain and absorb REEs. Also, the ability of the vegetation to intake the REE is dependent on the type of REE present in the soil, hence there are a multitude of factors that influence this process. Agricultural plants are the main type of vegetation affected by REE contamination in the environment, the two plants with a higher chance of absorbing and storing REEs being apples and beets. Furthermore, there is a possibility that REEs can leach out into aquatic environments and be absorbed by aquatic vegetation, which can then bio-accumulate and potentially enter the human food chain if livestock or humans choose to eat the vegetation. An example of this situation was the case of the water hyacinth (&quot;Eichhornia crassipes)&quot; in China, where the water was contaminated due to a REE-enriched fertilizer being used in a nearby agricultural area. The aquatic environment became contaminated with cerium and resulted in the water hyacinth becoming three times more concentrated in cerium than its surrounding water.

====On human health====
The chemical properties of the REEs are so similar that they are expected to show similar toxicity in humans.
Mortality studies show REEs are not highly toxic. Long term (18 months) inhalation of dust containing high levels (60%) of REEs has been shown to cause pneumoconiosis but the mechanism is unknown.

While REEs are not major pollutants, the increase application of REEs in new technologies has increased the need to understand their safe levels of exposure for humans. One side effect of mining REEs can be exposure to harmful radioactive Thorium as has been demonstrated at large mine in Batou (Mongolia). 
The rare-earth mining and smelting process can release airborne fluoride which will associate with total suspended particles (TSP) to form aerosols that can enter human respiratory systems. Research from Baotou, China shows that the fluoride concentration in the air near REE mines is higher than the limit value from WHO, but the health effects of this exposure are unknown.

Analysis of people living near mines in China had many times the levels of REEs in their blood, urine, bone, and hair compared to controls far from mining sites, suggesting possible bioaccumulation of REEs. This higher level was related to the high levels of REEs present in the vegetables they cultivated, the soil, and the water from the wells, indicating that the high levels were caused by the nearby mine. However the levels found were not high enough to cause health effects. 
Analysis of REEs in street dust in China suggest &quot;no augmented health hazard&quot;.
Similarly, analysis of cereal crops in mining areas in China found levels too low for health risks.

====On animal health====
Experiments exposing rats to various cerium compounds have found accumulation primarily in the lungs and liver. This resulted in various negative health outcomes associated with those organs. REEs have been added to feed in livestock to increase their body mass and increase milk production. They are most commonly used to increase the body mass of pigs, and it was discovered that REEs increase the digestibility and nutrient use of pigs&#x27; digestive systems. Studies point to a dose-response when considering toxicity versus positive effects. While small doses from the environment or with proper administration seem to have no ill effects, larger doses have been shown to have negative effects specifically in the organs where they accumulate. The process of mining REEs in China has resulted in soil and water contamination in certain areas, which when transported into aquatic bodies could potentially bio-accumulate within aquatic biota. Furthermore, in some cases, animals that live in REE-contaminated areas have been diagnosed with organ or system problems. REEs have been used in freshwater fish farming because it protects the fish from possible diseases. One main reason why they have been avidly used in animal livestock feeding is that they have had better results than inorganic livestock feed enhancers.

===Remediation after pollution===

After the 1982 Bukit Merah radioactive pollution, the mine in Malaysia has been the focus of a US$100 million cleanup that is proceeding in 2011. After having accomplished the hilltop entombment of 11,000 truckloads of radioactively contaminated material, the project is expected to entail in summer, 2011, the removal of &quot;more than 80,000 steel barrels of radioactive waste to the hilltop repository.&quot;

In May 2011, after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, widespread protests took place in Kuantan over the Lynas refinery and radioactive waste from it. The ore to be processed has very low levels of thorium, and Lynas founder and chief executive Nicholas Curtis said &quot;There is absolutely no risk to public health.&quot; T. Jayabalan, a doctor who says he has been monitoring and treating patients affected by the Mitsubishi plant, &quot;is wary of Lynas&#x27;s assurances. The argument that low levels of thorium in the ore make it safer doesn&#x27;t make sense, he says, because radiation exposure is cumulative.&quot; Construction of the facility has been halted until an independent United Nations IAEA panel investigation is completed, which is expected by the end of June 2011. New restrictions were announced by the Malaysian government in late June.

An IAEA panel investigation was completed and no construction has been halted. Lynas is on budget and on schedule to start producing in 2011. The IAEA concluded in a report issued in June 2011 that it did not find any instance of &quot;any non-compliance with international radiation safety standards&quot; in the project.

If the proper safety standards are followed, REE mining is relatively low impact. Molycorp (before going bankrupt) often exceeded environmental regulations to improve its public image.

In Greenland, there is a significant dispute on whether to start a new rare-earth mine in Kvanefjeld due to environmental concerns.

==Geopolitical considerations==

China has officially cited resource depletion and environmental concerns as the reasons for a nationwide crackdown on its rare-earth mineral production sector. However, non-environmental motives have also been imputed to China&#x27;s rare-earth policy. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;Slashing their exports of rare-earth metals ... is all about moving Chinese manufacturers up the supply chain, so they can sell valuable finished goods to the world rather than lowly raw materials.&quot; Furthermore, China currently has an effective monopoly on the world&#x27;s REE Value Chain. (All of the refineries and processing plants that transform the raw ore into valuable elements.) In the words of Deng Xiaoping, a Chinese politician from the late 1970s to the late 1980s, &quot;The Middle East has oil; we have rare earths ... it is of extremely important strategic significance; we must be sure to handle the rare earth issue properly and make the fullest use of our country&#x27;s advantage in rare-earth resources.&quot;

One possible example of market control is the division of General Motors that deals with miniaturized magnet research, which shut down its US office and moved its entire staff to China in 2006 (China&#x27;s export quota only applies to the metal but not products made from these metals such as magnets).

It was reported, but officially denied, that China instituted an export ban on shipments of rare-earth oxides (but not alloys) to Japan on 22 September 2010, in response to the detainment of a Chinese fishing boat captain by the Japanese Coast Guard. On September 2, 2010, a few days before the fishing boat incident, &quot;The Economist&quot; reported that &quot;China ... in July announced the latest in a series of annual export reductions, this time by 40% to precisely 30,258 tonnes.&quot;

The United States Department of Energy in its 2010 Critical Materials Strategy report identified dysprosium as the element that was most critical in terms of import reliance.

A 2011 report &quot;China&#x27;s Rare-Earth Industry&quot;, issued by the US Geological Survey and US Department of the Interior, outlines industry trends within China and examines national policies that may guide the future of the country&#x27;s production. The report notes that China&#x27;s lead in the production of rare-earth minerals has accelerated over the past two decades. In 1990, China accounted for only 27% of such minerals. In 2009, world production was 132,000 metric tons; China produced 129,000 of those tons. According to the report, recent patterns suggest that China will slow the export of such materials to the world: &quot;Owing to the increase in domestic demand, the Government has gradually reduced the export quota during the past several years.&quot; In 2006, China allowed 47 domestic rare-earth producers and traders and 12 Sino-foreign rare-earth producers to export. Controls have since tightened annually; by 2011, only 22 domestic rare-earth producers and traders and 9 Sino-foreign rare-earth producers were authorized. The government&#x27;s future policies will likely keep in place strict controls: &quot;According to China&#x27;s draft rare-earth development plan, annual rare-earth production may be limited to between 130,000 and 140,000 [metric tons] during the period from 2009 to 2015. The export quota for rare-earth products may be about 35,000 [metric tons] and the Government may allow 20 domestic rare-earth producers and traders to export rare earths.&quot;

The United States Geological Survey was actively surveying southern Afghanistan for rare-earth deposits under the protection of United States military forces. Since 2009 the USGS has conducted remote sensing surveys as well as fieldwork to verify Soviet claims that volcanic rocks containing rare-earth metals exist in Helmand Province near the village of Khanashin. The USGS study team has located a sizable area of rocks in the center of an extinct volcano containing light rare-earth elements including cerium and neodymium. It has mapped 1.3 million metric tons of desirable rock, or about ten years of supply at current demand levels. The Pentagon has estimated its value at about $7.4 billion.

It has been argued that the geopolitical importance of rare earths has been exaggerated in the literature on the geopolitics of renewable energy, underestimating the power of economic incentives for expanded production. This especially concerns neodymium. Due to its role in permanent magnets used for wind turbines, it has been argued that neodymium will be one of the main objects of geopolitical competition in a world running on renewable energy. But this perspective has been criticized for failing to recognize that most wind turbines have gears and do not use permanent magnets.

==In popular culture==

The plot of Eric Ambler&#x27;s now-classic 1967 international crime-thriller &quot;Dirty Story&quot; (aka &quot;This Gun for Hire&quot;, but not to be confused with the movie &quot;This Gun for Hire&quot; (1942)) features a struggle between two rival mining cartels to control a plot of land in a fictional African country, which contains rich minable rare-earth ore deposits.

<text>a medium used to express ideas with images, often combined with text or other visual information. It typically the form of a sequence of panels of images. Textual devices such as speech balloons, captions, and onomatopoeia can indicate dialogue, narration, sound effects, or other information. There is no consensus among theorists and historians on a definition of comics; some emphasize the combination of images and text, some sequentiality or other image relations, and others historical aspects such as mass reproduction or the use of recurring characters. Cartooning and other forms of illustration are the most common means of image-making in comics. Photo comics is a form that uses photographic images. Common forms include comic strips, editorial and gag cartoons, and comic books. Since the late 20th century, bound volumes such as graphic novels, comic albums, and have become increasingly common, along with webcomics as well as scientific/medical comics.

The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished, particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer&#x27;s cartoon strips of the 1830s, while Wilhelm Busch and his Max and Moritz also had a global impact from 1865 on, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, and the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (&quot;&quot;) propose origins as early as the 12th century. Japanese comics are generally held separate from the evolution of Euro-American comics, and Western comic art probably originated in 17th-century Italy. Modern Japanese comic strips emerged in the early 20th century, and the output of comic magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era (1945)– with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of their history, but towards the end of the 20th century, they began to find greater acceptance with the public and academics.

The English term &quot;comics&quot; is used as a singular noun when it refers to the medium itself (e.g. &quot;&quot;Comics is&quot; a visual art form.&quot;), but becomes plural when referring to works collectively (e.g. &quot;&quot;Comics are&quot; popular reading material.&quot;).

The comics may be further adapted to animations (anime), dramas, TV shows, movies.

==Origins and traditions==

The European, American, and Japanese comics traditions have followed different paths. Europeans have seen their tradition as beginning with the Swiss Rodolphe Töpffer from as early as 1827 and Americans have seen the origin of theirs in Richard F. Outcault&#x27;s 1890s newspaper strip &quot;The Yellow Kid&quot;, though many Americans have come to recognize Töpffer&#x27;s precedence. Wilhelm Busch directly influenced Rudolph Dirks and his Katzenjammer Kids. Japan has a long history of satirical cartoons and comics leading up to the World War II era. The ukiyo-e artist Hokusai popularized the Japanese term for comics and cartooning, &quot;&quot;, in the early 19th century. In the 1930s Harry &quot;A&quot; Chesler started a comics studio, which eventually at its height employed 40 artists working for 50 different publishers who helped make the comics medium flourish in &quot;the Golden Age of Comics&quot; after World War II. In the post-war era modern Japanese comics began to flourish when Osamu Tezuka produced a prolific body of work. Towards the close of the 20th century, these three traditions converged in a trend towards book-length comics: the comic album in Europe, the in Japan, and the graphic novel in the English-speaking countries.

Outside of these genealogies, comics theorists and historians have seen precedents for comics in the Lascaux cave paintings in France (some of which appear to be chronological sequences of images), Egyptian hieroglyphs, Trajan&#x27;s Column in Rome, the 11th-century Norman Bayeux Tapestry, the 1370 woodcut, the 15th-century and block books, Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;The Last Judgment&quot; in the Sistine Chapel, and William Hogarth&#x27;s 18th-century sequential engravings, amongst others.

===English-language comics===


Illustrated humour periodicals were popular in 19th-century Britain, the earliest of which was the short-lived &quot;The Glasgow Looking Glass&quot; in 1825. The most popular was &quot;Punch&quot;, which popularized the term &quot;cartoon&quot; for its humorous caricatures. On occasion the cartoons in these magazines appeared in sequences; the character Ally Sloper featured in the earliest serialized comic strip when the character began to feature in its own weekly magazine in 1884.

American comics developed out of such magazines as &quot;Puck&quot;, &quot;Judge&quot;, and &quot;Life&quot;. The success of illustrated humour supplements in the &quot;New York World&quot; and later the &quot;New York American&quot;, particularly Outcault&#x27;s &quot;The Yellow Kid&quot;, led to the development of newspaper comic strips. Early Sunday strips were full-page and often in colour. Between 1896 and 1901 cartoonists experimented with sequentiality, movement, and speech balloons. An example is Gustave Verbeek, who wrote his comic series &quot;The UpsideDowns of Old Man Muffaroo and Little Lady Lovekins&quot; between 1903 and 1905. These comics were made in such a way that one could read the 6-panel comic, flip the book and keep reading. He made 64 such comics in total. In 2012, a remake of a selection of the comics was made by Marcus Ivarsson in the book &#x27;In Uppåner med Lilla Lisen &amp; Gamle Muppen&#x27;. ()

Shorter, black-and-white daily strips began to appear early in the 20th century, and became established in newspapers after the success in 1907 of Bud Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot;. In Britain, the Amalgamated Press established a popular style of a sequence of images with text beneath them, including &quot;Illustrated Chips&quot; and &quot;Comic Cuts&quot;. Humour strips predominated at first, and in the 1920s and 1930s strips with continuing stories in genres such as adventure and drama also became popular.

Thin periodicals called comic books appeared in the 1930s, at first reprinting newspaper comic strips; by the end of the decade, original content began to dominate. The success in 1938 of &quot;Action Comics&quot; and its lead hero Superman marked the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books, in which the superhero genre was prominent. In the UK and the Commonwealth, the DC Thomson-created &quot;Dandy&quot; (1937) and &quot;Beano&quot; (1938) became successful humor-based titles, with a combined circulation of over 2 million copies by the 1950s. Their characters, including &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, &quot;Desperate Dan&quot; and &quot;The Bash Street Kids&quot; have been read by generations of British children. The comics originally experimented with superheroes and action stories before settling on humorous strips featuring a mix of the Amalgamated Press and US comic book styles.

The popularity of superhero comic books declined in the years following World War II, while comic book sales continued to increase as other genres proliferated, such as romance, westerns, crime, horror, and humour. Following a sales peak in the early 1950s, the content of comic books (particularly crime and horror) was subjected to scrutiny from parent groups and government agencies, which culminated in Senate hearings that led to the establishment of the Comics Code Authority self-censoring body. The Code has been blamed for stunting the growth of American comics and maintaining its low status in American society for much of the remainder of the century. Superheroes re-established themselves as the most prominent comic book genre by the early 1960s. Underground comix challenged the Code and readers with adult, countercultural content in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The underground gave birth to the alternative comics movement in the 1980s and its mature, often experimental content in non-superhero genres.

Comics in the US has had a lowbrow reputation stemming from its roots in mass culture; cultural elites sometimes saw popular culture as threatening culture and society. In the latter half of the 20th century, popular culture won greater acceptance, and the lines between high and low culture began to blur. Comics nevertheless continued to be stigmatized, as the medium was seen as entertainment for children and illiterates.

The graphic novel—book-length comics—began to gain attention after Will Eisner popularized the term with his book &quot;A Contract with God&quot; (1978). The term became widely known with the public after the commercial success of &quot;Maus&quot;, &quot;Watchmen&quot;, and &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; in the mid-1980s. In the 21st century graphic novels became established in mainstream bookstores and libraries and webcomics became common.

===Franco-Belgian and European comics===

The francophone Swiss Rodolphe Töpffer produced comic strips beginning in 1827, and published theories behind the form. Wilhelm Busch first published his Max and Moritz in 1865. Cartoons appeared widely in newspapers and magazines from the 19th century. The success of &quot;Zig et Puce&quot; in 1925 popularized the use of speech balloons in European comics, after which Franco-Belgian comics began to dominate. &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, with its signature clear line style, was first serialized in newspaper comics supplements beginning in 1929, and became an icon of Franco-Belgian comics.

Following the success of (est. 1934), dedicated comics magazines like &quot;Spirou&quot; (est. 1938) and &quot;Tintin&quot; (1946–1993), and full-colour comic albums became the primary outlet for comics in the mid-20th century. As in the US, at the time comics were seen as infantile and a threat to culture and literacy; commentators stated that &quot;none bear up to the slightest serious analysis&quot;, and that comics were &quot;the sabotage of all art and all literature&quot;.

In the 1960s, the term (&quot;drawn strips&quot;) came into wide use in French to denote the medium. Cartoonists began creating comics for mature audiences, and the term &quot;Ninth Art&quot; was coined, as comics began to attract public and academic attention as an artform. A group including René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo founded the magazine &quot;Pilote&quot; in 1959 to give artists greater freedom over their work. Goscinny and Uderzo&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Asterix&quot; appeared in it and went on to become the best-selling French-language comics series. From 1960, the satirical and taboo-breaking &quot;Hara-Kiri&quot; defied censorship laws in the countercultural spirit that led to the May 1968 events.

Frustration with censorship and editorial interference led to a group of &quot;Pilote&quot; cartoonists to found the adults-only &quot;L&#x27;Écho des savanes&quot; in 1972. Adult-oriented and experimental comics flourished in the 1970s, such as in the experimental science fiction of Mœbius and others in &quot;Métal hurlant&quot;, even mainstream publishers took to publishing prestige-format adult comics.

From the 1980s, mainstream sensibilities were reasserted and serialization became less common as the number of comics magazines decreased and many comics began to be published directly as albums. Smaller publishers such as L&#x27;Association that published longer works in non-traditional formats by &quot;auteur&quot;-istic creators also became common. Since the 1990s, mergers resulted in fewer large publishers, while smaller publishers proliferated. Sales overall continued to grow despite the trend towards a shrinking print market.

===Japanese comics===

Japanese comics and cartooning (&#x27;), have a history that has been seen as far back as the anthropomorphic characters in the 12th-to-13th-century &#x27;, 17th-century &#x27; and &#x27; picture books, and woodblock prints such as ukiyo-e which were popular between the 17th and 20th centuries. The &quot;&quot; contained examples of sequential images, movement lines, and sound effects.

Illustrated magazines for Western expatriates introduced Western-style satirical cartoons to Japan in the late 19th century. New publications in both the Western and Japanese styles became popular, and at the end of the 1890s, American-style newspaper comics supplements began to appear in Japan, as well as some American comic strips. 1900 saw the debut of the &quot;Jiji Manga&quot; in the &quot;Jiji Shinpō&quot; newspaper—the first use of the word &quot;manga&quot; in its modern sense, and where, in 1902, Rakuten Kitazawa began the first modern Japanese comic strip. By the 1930s, comic strips were serialized in large-circulation monthly girls&#x27; and boys&#x27; magazine and collected into hardback volumes.

The modern era of comics in Japan began after World War II, propelled by the success of the serialized comics of the prolific Osamu Tezuka and the comic strip &quot;Sazae-san&quot;. Genres and audiences diversified over the following decades. Stories are usually first serialized in magazines which are often hundreds of pages thick and may contain over a dozen stories; they are later compiled in -format books. At the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, nearly a quarter of all printed material in Japan was comics. Translations became extremely popular in foreign markets—in some cases equaling or surpassing the sales of domestic comics.

=== Korean comics ===

Manhwa ( 만화 ) refers to Korean comics and print cartoons, with the term often used internationally to designate comics originating in Korea. While manhwa shares cultural and linguistic roots with Japanese manga and Chinese manhua, it has developed a unique identity influenced by Korea’s historical, cultural, and artistic landscape. Modern manhwa has gained global popularity, partly due to the rise of webtoons—digitally formatted comics designed for scrolling on mobile devices. This success has contributed to adaptations into movies, dramas, and television series.

The concept of manhwa emerged under the influence of Japanese manga during the Japanese occupation of Korea in the early 20th century. Manga’s established presence in Japan during this period strongly shaped the foundational styles and formats of Korean comics. As Korea transitioned into independence, manhwa evolved into a distinct medium, balancing the artistic influences of its neighbors with traditional Korean aesthetics and storytelling.

==Forms and formats==

Comic strips are generally short, multipanel comics that have, since the early 20th century, most commonly appeared in newspapers. In the US, daily strips have normally occupied a single tier, while Sunday strips have been given multiple tiers. Since the early 20th century, daily newspaper comic strips have typically been printed in black-and-white and Sunday comics have usually been printed in colour and have often occupied a full newspaper page.

Specialized comics periodicals formats vary greatly in different cultures. Comic books, primarily an American format, are thin periodicals usually published in colour. European and Japanese comics are frequently serialized in magazines—monthly or weekly in Europe, and usually black-and-white and weekly in Japan. Japanese comics magazine typically run to hundreds of pages.

Book-length comics take different forms in different cultures. European comic albums are most commonly colour volumes printed at A4-size, a larger page size than used in many other cultures. In English-speaking countries, the trade paperback format originating from collected comic books have also been chosen for original material. Otherwise, bound volumes of comics are called graphic novels and are available in various formats. Despite incorporating the term &quot;novel&quot;—a term normally associated with fiction—&quot;graphic novel&quot; also refers to non-fiction and collections of short works. Japanese comics are collected in volumes called following magazine serialization.

Gag and editorial cartoons usually consist of a single panel, often incorporating a caption or speech balloon. Definitions of comics which emphasize sequence usually exclude gag, editorial, and other single-panel cartoons; they can be included in definitions that emphasize the combination of word and image. Gag cartoons first began to proliferate in broadsheets published in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the term &quot;cartoon&quot; was first used to describe them in 1843 in the British humour magazine &quot;Punch&quot;.

Webcomics are comics that are available on the internet, first being published the 1980s. They are able to potentially reach large audiences, and new readers can often access archives of previous installments. Webcomics can make use of an infinite canvas, meaning they are not constrained by the size or dimensions of a printed comics page.

Some consider storyboards and wordless novels to be comics. Film studios, especially in animation, often use sequences of images as guides for film sequences. These storyboards are not intended as an end product and are rarely seen by the public. Wordless novels are books which use sequences of captionless images to deliver a narrative.

==Comics studies==


Similar to the problems of defining literature and film, no consensus has been reached on a definition of the comics medium, and attempted definitions and descriptions have fallen prey to numerous exceptions. Theorists such as Töpffer, R. C. Harvey, Will Eisner, David Carrier, Alain Rey, and Lawrence Grove emphasize the combination of text and images, though there are prominent examples of pantomime comics throughout its history. Other critics, such as Thierry Groensteen and Scott McCloud, have emphasized the primacy of sequences of images. Towards the close of the 20th century, different cultures&#x27; discoveries of each other&#x27;s comics traditions, the rediscovery of forgotten early comics forms, and the rise of new forms made defining comics a more complicated task.

European comics studies began with Töpffer&#x27;s theories of his own work in the 1840s, which emphasized panel transitions and the visual–verbal combination. No further progress was made until the 1970s. Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle then took a semiotics approach to the study of comics, analyzing text–image relations, page-level image relations, and image discontinuities, or what Scott McCloud later dubbed &quot;closure&quot;. In 1987, Henri Vanlier introduced the term , or &quot;multiframe&quot;, to refer to the comics page as a semantic unit. By the 1990s, theorists such as Benoît Peeters and Thierry Groensteen turned attention to artists&#x27; poïetic creative choices. Thierry Smolderen and Harry Morgan have held relativistic views of the definition of comics, a medium that has taken various, equally valid forms over its history. Morgan sees comics as a subset of &quot;&quot; (or &quot;drawn literatures&quot;). French theory has come to give special attention to the page, in distinction from American theories such as McCloud&#x27;s which focus on panel-to-panel transitions. In the mid-2000s, Neil Cohn began analyzing how comics are understood using tools from cognitive science, extending beyond theory by using actual psychological and neuroscience experiments. This work has argued that sequential images and page layouts both use separate rule-bound &quot;grammars&quot; to be understood that extend beyond panel-to-panel transitions and categorical distinctions of types of layouts, and that the brain&#x27;s comprehension of comics is similar to comprehending other domains, such as language and music.

Historical narratives of &quot;manga&quot; tend to focus either on its recent, post-WWII history, or on attempts to demonstrate deep roots in the past, such as to the &#x27; picture scroll of the 12th and 13th centuries, or the early 19th-century &quot;Hokusai Manga&quot;. The first historical overview of Japanese comics was Seiki Hosokibara&#x27;s in 1924. Early post-war Japanese criticism was mostly of a left-wing political nature until the 1986 publication of Tomofusa Kure&#x27;s &quot;Modern Manga: The Complete Picture&quot;, which de-emphasized politics in favour of formal aspects, such as structure and a &quot;grammar&quot; of comics. The field of studies increased rapidly, with numerous books on the subject appearing in the 1990s. Formal theories of &#x27; have focused on developing a &quot;manga expression theory&quot;, with emphasis on spatial relationships in the structure of images on the page, distinguishing the medium from film or literature, in which the flow of time is the basic organizing element. Comics studies courses have proliferated at Japanese universities, and Japan Society for Studies in Cartoon and Comics was established in 2001 to promote comics scholarship. The publication of Frederik L. Schodt&#x27;s &quot;Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics&quot; in 1983 led to the spread of use of the word &quot;manga&quot; outside Japan to mean &quot;Japanese comics&quot; or &quot;Japanese-style comics&quot;.

Coulton Waugh attempted the first comprehensive history of American comics with &quot;The Comics&quot; (1947). Will Eisner&#x27;s &quot;Comics and Sequential Art&quot; (1985) and Scott McCloud&#x27;s &quot;Understanding Comics&quot; (1993) were early attempts in English to formalize the study of comics. David Carrier&#x27;s &quot;The Aesthetics of Comics&quot; (2000) was the first full-length treatment of comics from a philosophical perspective. Prominent American attempts at definitions of comics include Eisner&#x27;s, McCloud&#x27;s, and Harvey&#x27;s. Eisner described what he called &quot;sequential art&quot; as &quot;the arrangement of pictures or images and words to narrate a story or dramatize an idea&quot;; Scott McCloud defined comics as &quot;juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information and/or to produce an aesthetic response in the viewer&quot;, a strictly formal definition which detached comics from its historical and cultural trappings. R. C. Harvey defined comics as &quot;pictorial narratives or expositions in which words (often lettered into the picture area within speech balloons) usually contribute to the meaning of the pictures and vice versa&quot;. Each definition has had its detractors. Harvey saw McCloud&#x27;s definition as excluding single-panel cartoons, and objected to McCloud&#x27;s de-emphasizing verbal elements, insisting &quot;the essential characteristic of comics is the incorporation of verbal content&quot;. Aaron Meskin saw McCloud&#x27;s theories as an artificial attempt to legitimize the place of comics in art history.

Cross-cultural study of comics is complicated by the great difference in meaning and scope of the words for &quot;comics&quot; in different languages. The French term for comics, (&quot;drawn strip&quot;) emphasizes the juxtaposition of drawn images as a defining factor, which can imply the exclusion of even photographic comics. The term &quot;&quot; is used in Japanese to indicate all forms of comics, cartooning, and caricature.

==Terminology==

The term &quot;comics&quot; refers to the comics medium when used as an uncountable noun and thus takes the singular: &quot;comics &quot;is&quot; a medium&quot; rather than &quot;comics &quot;are&quot; a medium&quot;. When &quot;comic&quot; appears as a countable noun it refers to instances of the medium, such as individual comic strips or comic books: &quot;Tom&#x27;s comics &quot;are&quot; in the basement.&quot;

Panels are individual images containing a segment of action, often surrounded by a border. Prime moments in a narrative are broken down into panels via a process called encapsulation. The reader puts the pieces together via the process of closure by using background knowledge and an understanding of panel relations to combine panels mentally into events. The size, shape, and arrangement of panels each affect the timing and pacing of the narrative. The contents of a panel may be asynchronous, with events depicted in the same image not necessarily occurring at the same time.

Text is frequently incorporated into comics via speech balloons, captions, and sound effects. Speech balloons indicate dialogue (or thought, in the case of thought balloons), with tails pointing at their respective speakers. Captions can give voice to a narrator, convey characters&#x27; dialogue or thoughts, or indicate place or time. Speech balloons themselves are strongly associated with comics, such that the addition of one to an image is sufficient to turn the image into comics. Sound effects mimic non-vocal sounds textually using onomatopoeia sound-words.

Cartooning is most frequently used in making comics, traditionally using ink (especially India ink) with dip pens or ink brushes; mixed media and digital technology have become common. Cartooning techniques such as motion lines and abstract symbols are often employed.

While comics are often the work of a single creator, the labour of making them is frequently divided between a number of specialists. There may be separate writers and artists, and artists may specialize in parts of the artwork such as characters or backgrounds, as is common in Japan. Particularly in American superhero comic books, the art may be divided between a penciller, who lays out the artwork in pencil; an inker, who finishes the artwork in ink; a colourist; and a letterer, who adds the captions and speech balloons.

===Etymology===

The English-language term &quot;comics&quot; derives from the humorous (or &quot;&quot;) work which predominated in early American newspaper comic strips, but usage of the term has become standard for non-humorous works as well. The alternate spelling &quot;comix&quot; – coined by the underground comix movement – is sometimes used to address such ambiguities. The term &quot;comic book&quot; has a similarly confusing history since they are most often not humorous and are periodicals, not regular books. It is common in English to refer to the comics of different cultures by the terms used in their languages, such as &quot;&quot; for Japanese comics, or for French-language Franco-Belgian comics.

Many cultures have taken their word for comics from English, including Russian (, &#x27;) and German (). Similarly, the Chinese term &#x27; and the Korean &#x27; derive from the Chinese characters with which the Japanese term &#x27; is written.

<doc id="145445" wikidata="Q163868" url="?curid=145445" title="The Umbrellas of Cherbourg">
<text>The Umbrellas of Cherbourg () is a 1964 musical romantic drama film written and directed by Jacques Demy, with music by Michel Legrand. Catherine Deneuve and Nino Castelnuovo star as two young lovers in the French city of Cherbourg, separated by circumstance. The film&#x27;s dialogue is entirely sung as recitative, including casual conversation, and is sung-through, or through-composed, like some operas and stage musicals. It has been seen as the second of an informal tetralogy of Demy films that share some of the same actors, characters, and overall atmosphere of romantic melancholy, coming after &quot;Lola&quot; (1961) and before &quot;The Young Girls of Rochefort&quot; (1967) and &quot;Model Shop&quot; (1969). The French-language film was a co-production between France and West Germany.

&quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot; won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1964 Cannes Film Festival. In the United States, it was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Foreign-Language Film, Best Original Screenplay (Demy), and Best Original Score (Demy and Legrand). The film&#x27;s main theme, &quot;I Will Wait for You&quot;, was nominated for Best Original Song. It was later adapted into an English-language stage musical.

In 2018, a BBC Culture critics&#x27; poll ranked the film in the Top 100 Greatest Non-English Films of All Time.

==Plot==
===Part One: The Departure (November 1957)===

Madame Émery and her 17-year-old daughter Geneviève have a tiny, struggling umbrella boutique in the coastal town of Cherbourg in Normandy. Guy is a young auto mechanic who lives with and cares for his sickly aunt and godmother Élise. Though Geneviève&#x27;s mother disapproves, Guy and Geneviève are deeply in love; they plan to marry and name their first child Françoise. At the same time, Madeleine, a quiet young woman who looks after Guy&#x27;s aunt, is secretly in love with Guy. Guy is drafted to serve in the Algerian War. The night before he leaves, he and Geneviève pledge their undying love and have sex.

===Part Two: The Absence (January – April 1958)===
Geneviève learns she is pregnant and writes to Guy, but his replies are sporadic. Her mother tells her to give up on Guyhe has forgotten her. Geneviève is courted by Roland Cassard, a kind, young, very wealthy Parisian jeweler; he wants to marry her despite her pregnancy. In one of the connections among Demy&#x27;s trilogy of films, Roland had previously unsuccessfully wooed the title character in the earlier &quot;Lola&quot; (1961); now he relates a version of this story to Madame Émery. Madame Émery urges Geneviève to be sensible and choose a secure future with Roland. Roland announces that he will be going to Amsterdam for three months, and will wait for Geneviève&#x27;s answer until his return. Geneviève marries Roland in a great cathedral, but she appears ambivalent about her decision.

===Part Three: The Return (March 1959December 1963)===
Returning injured from the war, Guy learns that Geneviève has married and left Cherbourg. He has a difficult time readjusting to civilian life. After an argument with his boss he quits his job, goes drinking in a seedy bar, and spends the night with a prostitute. When he returns to his apartment, Madeleine tells him that his aunt Élise has died. Guy sees that Madeleine loves him, and he rebuilds his life with her help. Using the inheritance from his aunt he opens a new &quot;American-style&quot; gas station. Madeleine agrees to marry him, though she wonders whether he is merely on the rebound after losing Geneviève.

Four years later, on a snowy Christmas Eve, Guy and Madeleine are in the office of their gas station with their small son François. As Madeleine and François leave to visit Santa Claus, a now wealthy Geneviève and her daughter Françoise arrive. Guy invites Geneviève into the station&#x27;s office, where Geneviève reveals this is her first time in Cherbourg since her marriage. When asked if he wants to meet his daughter, Guy declines. On her way out, Geneviève looks back at Guy one last time, before driving off. Madeleine returns with François, and Guy greets her with a kiss.

==Cast==
===Singing voices===
===English dub===
This English dub was broadcast several times in the USA, on different channels. So far, the only identified VHS release is a Chinese one (early 90s). The existence of a 16 mm print proves that there were also cinema releases.
This dub has never been released on DVD.

==Framing==
&quot;Umbrellas&quot; is the middle film in an informal &quot;romantic trilogy&quot; of Demy films that share some of the same actors, characters, and overall look; it comes after &quot;Lola&quot; (1961) and before &quot;The Young Girls of Rochefort&quot; (1967). The film was very successful in France, and was also shown internationally, introducing Deneuve to a larger audience. It was nominated for several Academy Awards, including for Best Foreign Film, Best Song, Best Soundtrack, and Best Original Screenplay. It won three awards at the 1964 Cannes Film Festival, including its top prize, the Palme d&#x27;Or. Jim Ridley has called &quot;Cherbourg&quot; &quot;the most affecting of movie musicals, and perhaps the fullest expression of [Demy&#x27;s] career-long fascination with the entwining of real life, chance, and the bewitching artifice of cinematic illusion.&quot;

==Music==
The continuous music score and the brightly coloured photography had much to do with the popularity of this film. Formally the work is operatic, with the plot advanced entirely through dialogue sung with accompanying music. The colour photography is bright and vivid. The whole is united by an orchestral score of simple rhythms and tunes that are integrated with the story covering five years.

Since the cast were not trained singers, most of the actors&#x27; voices were dubbed and lipsynced:

The film score established composer Michel Legrand&#x27;s reputation in Hollywood. He later scored other films, winning three Oscars. In North America, two of the film&#x27;s songs became hits and were recorded by many artists: &quot;I Will Wait for You&quot; (the main theme, also known as &quot;Devant le garage&quot;) and &quot;Watch What Happens&quot; (originally &quot;Recit de Cassard&quot;, &quot;Cassard&#x27;s Story&quot;). Both were given new English lyrics by lyricist Norman Gimbel.

&quot;Watch What Happens&quot; was covered by artists such as Tony Bennett, Ed Ames, and jazz pianists Oscar Peterson and Vince Guaraldi.

== Reception and legacy ==
&quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot; was met with critical acclaim and is often regarded as one of the best musical films of all time. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 69 reviews, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Jacques Demy elevates the basic drama of everyday life into a soaring opera full of bittersweet passion and playful charm, featuring a timeless performance from Catherine Deneuve.&quot; On Metacritic, it holds a weighted score of 86 out 100, based on 9 reviews indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

In a review for &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, Kim Newman awarded the film 5/5 stars and praised the &quot;depths of operatic emotion under the hum-along singspiel&quot; delivered by the films leads. Nigel Andrews, writing for the &quot;Financial Times&quot; awarded the film 4 stars out of 5 calling the film &quot;a body of work slim but exquisitely styled&quot;. Kevin Maher for &quot;The Times&quot;, in a review of a re-release of the film in 2019, also lauded the film, awarding it 5/5 stars. Significant praise has also been directed to the entirely sung through nature of the film, with both James Berardinelli of reelviews and Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praising this aspect of the film in their reviews.

Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; described &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot; as &quot;tired material&quot;.

A restored digital version of &quot;Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot; was shown as part of the Cannes Classics section of the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.

Filmmaker Damien Chazelle listed it as one of his favorite films, and as a major influence on his 2016 musical &quot;La La Land&quot;. Greta Gerwig cited the film as an inspiration for her 2023 fantasy comedy &quot;Barbie&quot;.

In 1979, an English-language stage adaptation, with lyrics translated by Sheldon Harnick, premiered at the Public Theater in New York City.

In 2005 a major revision by Harnick was produced at the Two River Theatre Company in Red Bank, New Jersey. Musical director/conductor Nathan Hurwitz provided new orchestration.

==Restoration==
The film version released in 2004 on DVD by Koch-Lorber Films is a completely restored version of the original.

The film was originally shot on Eastman negative stock, which had rapidly faded and thus had become almost unusable. The various copies of the film used in the cinema circuit gradually lost their quality. &quot;Umbrellas&quot; thus could not be seen with the rich colours which Demy had originally intended.

Knowing as he did that the Eastman stock would fade over time, Demy had made the three main yellow, cyan and magenta color separation masters on black-and-white negative films, which do not fade. These black-and-white separations had greater longevity.

In the 1990s, Demy&#x27;s wife, film director Agnès Varda, headed a project to create a new colour-negative film from the three black and white separations. Restored full-color prints were made from this in 2004. The resulting film recaptured Demy&#x27;s vision of a fantastically colourful Cherbourg.

Composer Michel Legrand assisted in restoring the original four-track stereo sound masters to digital. He remastered his score to produce a higher-quality version, released in 2014.

A digital version of the film was released on Blu-ray by Ciné Tamaris in 2013, on the 50th anniversary of its original release. This version was restored independently of the 2004 version with colour grading supervised by Demy&#x27;s son Mathieu Demy.

A new 4K restoration of the film premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival.

==&quot;Les Bicyclettes de Belsize&quot;==

The title of the film inspired a musical short subject, released in 1969 and titled &quot;Les Bicyclettes de Belsize,&quot; which essentially parodied it. Douglas Hickox directed the said short subject, and Les Reed and Barry Mason composed the music and wrote the lyrics to its title song, French and English versions of which charted in 1969 for Mireille Mathieu and Engelbert Humperdinck respectively.

<text>The Liberty Bell, previously called the State House Bell or Old State House Bell, is an iconic symbol of American independence located in Philadelphia. Originally placed in the steeple of Pennsylvania State House, now known as Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell today is located across the street from Independence Hall in the Liberty Bell Center in Independence National Historical Park. 

The bell was commissioned in 1752 by the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly from the London-based firm Lester and Pack, later renamed the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, and was cast with the lettering &quot;Proclaim LIBERTY Throughout all the Land unto all the Inhabitants Thereof&quot;, a Biblical reference from the Book of Leviticus (). The bell first cracked when rung after its arrival in Philadelphia, and was twice recast by local workmen John Pass and John Stow, whose surnames appear on the bell. In its early years, the bell was used to summon lawmakers to legislative sessions and to alert citizens to public meetings and proclamations.

Although no immediate announcement was made of the Second Continental Congress&#x27;s Lee Resolution, the vote for independence on July 2, 1776, or its unanimous adoption of the United States Declaration of Independence two days later, on July 4, 1776, it is most likely that the Liberty Bell (along with other bells in Philadelphia) rang on July 8, 1776, when the Declaration of Independence was first read to the public. While no contemporary account of the Liberty Bell&#x27;s ringing exists, most historians believe the Liberty Bell was among the bells rung that day. 

The bell did not acquire its distinctive large crack until after almost a century of heavy use, though there is no historical consensus on the exact date it was cracked. According to the National Park Service, &quot;the most likely explanation is that a narrow split developed in the early 1840s after nearly 90 years of hard use. In 1846, when the city decided to repair the bell prior to George Washington&#x27;s birthday holiday (February 23), metal workers widened the thin crack to prevent its farther spread and restore the tone of the bell using a technique called &#x27;stop drilling&#x27;.&quot; 

After World War II, Philadelphia allowed the National Park Service to take custody of the bell, while retaining ownership. The bell was used as a symbol of freedom during the Cold War and was a popular site for protests in the 1960s. It was moved from its longtime home in Independence Hall to a nearby glass pavilion on Independence Mall in 1976, and then to the larger Liberty Bell Center adjacent to the pavilion in 2003. The bell has been featured on coins and stamps, and its name and image have been widely used by corporations.

==History==
===Founding (1751–1753)===
Philadelphia&#x27;s city bell was used to alert the public to proclamations or civic danger since the city&#x27;s 1682 founding. The original bell hung from a tree behind the Pennsylvania State House, now known as Independence Hall, and was said to have been brought to the city by its founder, William Penn. In 1751, with a bell tower being built in the Pennsylvania State House, civic authorities sought a bell of better quality that could be heard at a greater distance in the rapidly expanding city. Isaac Norris, speaker of the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly, gave orders to the colony&#x27;s London agent, Robert Charles, to obtain a &quot;good Bell of about two thousands pound weight&quot;.

The reference to Leviticus in Norris&#x27;s directive reflects the contemporaneous practice of assigning unique qualities to bells that reflected their particular composition and casting.

====Inscription====
The inscription on the bell reads:
&lt;poem&gt;Proclaim LIBERTY Throughout all the Land unto all the Inhabitants Thereof Lev. XXV. v X.
By Order of the ASSEMBLY of the Province of PENSYLVANIA for the State House in PhiladA
Pass and Stow
Philada
MDCCLIII&lt;/poem&gt;
At the time, &quot;Pensylvania&quot; was an accepted alternative spelling for Pennsylvania. In 1787, the spelling was used by Alexander Hamilton, a Founding Father and the first U.S. Treasury Secretary, on the signature page of the Constitution of the United States.

Robert Charles ordered the bell from Thomas Lester of the London bell founding firm of Lester and Pack, later known as the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, for £150 13s 8d, (equivalent to £ in ) including freight to Philadelphia and insurance on its transport. It arrived in Philadelphia in August 1752. 

Norris wrote to Charles that the bell was in good order, but they had not yet sounded it, since they were building a clock for the State House&#x27;s tower. The bell was mounted on a stand to test the sound, and at the first strike of the clapper, the bell&#x27;s rim cracked. The episode was used to good account in later stories of the bell; in 1893, President Benjamin Harrison, speaking as the bell passed through Indianapolis, said, &quot;This old bell was made in England, but it had to be recast in America before it was attuned to proclaim the right of self-government and the equal rights of men.&quot; Philadelphia authorities tried to return it by ship, but the master of the vessel that had brought it was unable to take it on board.

Two local founders, John Pass and John Stow, offered to recast the bell. Though they were inexperienced in bell casting, Pass headed the Mount Holly Iron Foundry in neighboring Mount Holly, New Jersey, and came from Malta, which had a tradition of bell casting. Stow was only four years out of his apprenticeship as a brass founder. At Stow&#x27;s foundry on 2nd Street in Philadelphia, the bell was broken into small pieces, melted down, and cast into a new bell. The two founders decided that the metal was too brittle, and augmented the bell metal by about ten percent, using copper. By March 1753, the bell was ready, and Norris reported that the lettering, which included the founders&#x27; names and the year, was even clearer on the new bell than on the old.

City officials in Philadelphia scheduled a public celebration with free food and drink for the testing of the recast bell. When the bell was struck, it did not break, but the sound produced was described by one hearer as similar to that of two coal scuttles being banged together. Mocked by the crowd, Pass and Stow hastily took the bell away to again recast it. In June 1753, the recasting was completed, and the sound was deemed satisfactory, though Norris indicated that he did not personally like it. The bell was hung in the steeple of the State House the same month.

The reason for the difficulties with the bell is not certain. The Whitechapel Foundry took the position that the bell was either damaged in transit or was broken by an inexperienced bell ringer, who incautiously sent the clapper flying against the rim, rather than the body of the bell. 

In 1975, the Winterthur Museum in Winterthur, Delaware, conducted an analysis of the metal in the bell, concluding that &quot;a series of errors made in the construction, reconstruction, and second reconstruction of the Bell resulted in a brittle bell that barely missed being broken up for scrap&quot;. The Museum found a considerably higher level of tin in the Liberty Bell than in other Whitechapel bells of that era, and suggested that Whitechapel made an error in the alloy, perhaps by using scraps with a high level of tin to begin the melt instead of the usual pure copper. 

The analysis concluded that, on the second recasting, instead of adding pure tin to the bell metal, Pass and Stow added cheap pewter with a high lead content, and incompletely mixed the new metal into the mold. The result was &quot;an extremely brittle alloy which not only caused the Bell to fail in service but made it easy for early souvenir collectors to knock off substantial trophies from the rim&quot;.

===American Revolution===

Dissatisfied with the bell, Norris instructed Charles to order a second one, and see if Lester and Pack would take back the first bell and credit the value of the metal towards the bill. In 1754, the Assembly decided to keep both bells; the new one was attached to the tower clock while the old bell was, by vote of the Assembly, devoted &quot;to such Uses as this House may hereafter appoint.&quot; The Pass and Stow bell was used to summon the Assembly. 

On October 16, 1755, in one of the earliest documented mentions of the bell&#x27;s use, Benjamin Franklin wrote Catherine Ray a letter, which stated: &quot;Adieu. The Bell rings, and I must go among the Grave ones, and talk Politiks.&quot; 

The bell was rung in 1760 to mark the accession of George III to the throne. 

In the early 1760s, the Assembly allowed a local church to use the State House for services and the bell to summon worshipers, while the church&#x27;s building was being constructed. The bell was also used to summon people to public meetings, and in 1772, a group of citizens complained to the Assembly that the bell was being rung too frequently.

Despite the legend that the Liberty Bell rang following the unanimous adoption of the Declaration of Independence by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, there is no evidence to support that, and it is unlikely since the first public readings of the Declaration of Independence were not until four days later, on July 8, 1776. There is historical documentation that when the Declaration was read publicly in Philadelphia, bells around the city were rung in commemoration. While the Liberty Bell is not specifically referenced, most historical authorities agree that it was likely among the bells that rang that day. However, there is some chance that the poor condition of the State House bell tower prevented the bell from ringing. According to John C. Paige, who wrote a historical study of the Liberty Bell for the National Park Service, &quot;We do not know whether or not the steeple was still strong enough to permit the State House bell to ring on this day. If it could possibly be rung, we can assume it was. Whether or not it did, it has come to symbolize all of the bells throughout the United States which proclaimed Independence.&quot; If the Liberty Bell was rung, it was most likely rung by Andrew McNair, the doorkeeper to the Assembly and the Continental Congress, who was responsible for the bell&#x27;s ringing. Bells were also rung to celebrate the first anniversary of Independence on July 4, 1777.

====Hidden in Allentown====

As the American Revolutionary War intensified, delegates to the Second Continental Congress, colonial-era city officials, and Philadelphia citizens were acutely aware that the British Army would likely recast the bell into munitions if they were able to find and secure it. On September 11, 1777, these concerns escalated after Washington and the Continental Army were defeated in the Battle of Brandywine, leaving the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia defenseless. The city urgently prepared for an inevitable British attack, and it subsequently fell under British occupation. Prior to the city&#x27;s fall to the British, the Liberty Bell and other major bells in Philadelphia were hastily taken down from their towers, and sent by heavily guarded wagon train to Bethlehem and then to Zion German Reformed Church at 622 Hamilton Street in Allentown, Pennsylvania, then known as Northampton Towne. In Allentown, the Liberty Bell was hidden under the church&#x27;s floor boards just as the British entered and began their occupation of Philadelphia.

The bell remained hidden in Allentown for nine months. In June 1778, following the British retreat from Philadelphia on June 18, 1778, it was returned. Upon the bell&#x27;s return to Philadelphia, the steeple of the State House was in poor condition, and was subsequently torn down and restored. The bell was placed in storage until 1785, when it was again mounted for ringing.

Following the victory of Washington and the Continental Army in the Revolutionary War, the bell was placed on an upper floor of the State House, and was rung on Independence Day, on Washington&#x27;s Birthday, and on election day to remind voters to hand in their ballots. It also rang to call students at the University of Pennsylvania to their classes at nearby Philosophical Hall. Between 1785 and 1799, when the Pennsylvania state capital was briefly moved to Lancaster, it was rung to summon state legislators into session. When Pennsylvania, having no further use for its State House, proposed to tear it down and sell the land for building lots, the City of Philadelphia purchased the land, the State House, and the Liberty Bell, for $70,000, equal to $ today.

===19th century===

In 1828, the City of Philadelphia sold the second Lester and Pack bell to St. Augustine&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, which was burned down in 1844 by an anti-Catholic mob in the Philadelphia Nativist Riots. The remains of the bell were recast and now housed at Villanova University in nearby Villanova, Pennsylvania.

It is not definitively known when or how the Liberty Bell first came to be cracked, but it is known that the damage occurred sometime between 1817 and 1846 and likely toward the end of this period. In 1837, the bell was depicted in an anti-slavery publication, and no crack is identifiable in that image. Nine years later, in February 1846, the &quot;Public Ledger&quot; reported that the bell was rung the day following Washington&#x27;s Birthday, on February 23, 1846. Since February 22 was a Sunday, the celebration occurred the next day. The newspaper reported that the bell had long been cracked, but had been &quot;put in order&quot; by having the sides of the crack filed. The paper reported that, around noon on February 23, 1846, it was discovered that the bell&#x27;s ringing was causing the crack to be extended, and that &quot;the old Independence Bell...now hangs in the great city steeple irreparably cracked and forever dumb.&quot;

The most common story about the cracking of the bell, which originated in 1876, is that it happened when the bell was rung upon the 1835 death of the Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall when the volunteer curator of Independence Hall, Colonel Frank Etting, announced that he had ascertained the truth of the bell&#x27;s cracking. While there is little evidence to support Etting&#x27;s view, it was widely accepted and taught. Other claims regarding the crack&#x27;s origin include stories that it was damaged during welcoming ceremonies for Lafayette on his return to the United States in 1824, that it cracked announcing the passing of the British Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, and that some boys had been invited to ring the bell and inadvertently damaged it. David Kimball, in a book authored for the National Park Service, suggests that it most likely cracked sometime between 1841 and 1845, during its ringing on either Independence Day or on Washington&#x27;s Birthday.

The Pass and Stow bell was first termed &quot;the Liberty Bell&quot; in &quot;Anti-Slavery Record&quot;, a journal published by the New York Anti-Slavery Society. Two years later, in 1837, in another publication by the society in the journal &quot;Liberty&quot;, an image of the bell appears on its cover under the heading, &quot;Proclaim Liberty&quot;. In 1839, Boston&#x27;s Friends of Liberty, another abolitionist group, titled their journal &quot;The Liberty Bell&quot;. The same year, William Lloyd Garrison&#x27;s anti-slavery publication &quot;The Liberator&quot; reprinted a Boston abolitionist pamphlet containing a poem entitled &quot;The Liberty Bell&quot; that noted that, at that time, despite its inscription, the bell did not proclaim liberty to all the inhabitants of the land.

A great part of the modern image of the bell as a relic of the proclamation of American independence was forged by writer George Lippard. On January 2, 1847, he published an article, &quot;Fourth of July, 1776&quot;, in the &quot;Saturday Courier&quot;. The short story depicted an aged bellman on July 4, 1776, sitting morosely by the bell, fearing that Congress would not have the courage to declare independence. At the most dramatic moment, a young boy appears with instructions for the old man: to ring the bell. It was subsequently published in Lippard&#x27;s collected stories. The story was widely reprinted and closely linked the Liberty Bell to the Declaration of Independence in the public mind. The elements of the story were reprinted in early historian Benson J. Lossing&#x27;s &quot;The Pictorial Field Guide to the Revolution&quot; (published in 1850) as historical fact, and the tale was widely repeated for generations after in school primers.

In 1848, with the rise of interest in the bell, the city decided to move it to the Assembly Room, also known as the Declaration Chamber, on the first floor, where the Declaration and United States Constitution had been debated and signed. The city constructed an ornate pedestal for the bell. The Liberty Bell was displayed on that pedestal for the next quarter-century, surmounted by an eagle (originally sculpted, later stuffed). In 1853, President Franklin Pierce visited Philadelphia and the bell, and spoke of the bell as symbolizing the American Revolution and American liberty. At the time, Independence Hall was also used as a courthouse, and African-American newspapers pointed out the incongruity of housing a symbol of liberty in the same building in which federal judges were holding hearings under the Fugitive Slave Act.

In February 1861, then President-elect Abraham Lincoln came to the Assembly Room and delivered an address en route to his inauguration in Washington D.C. In 1865, Lincoln&#x27;s body was returned to the Assembly Room after his assassination for a public viewing of his body, en route to his burial in Springfield, Illinois. Due to time constraints, only a small fraction of those wishing to pass by the coffin were able to; the lines to see the coffin were never less than long. Nevertheless, between 120,000 and 140,000 people were able to pass by the open casket and then the bell, carefully placed at Lincoln&#x27;s head so mourners could read the inscription, &quot;Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof.&quot;


In 1876, Philadelphia city officials discussed what role the bell should play in the nation&#x27;s Centennial festivities. Some wanted to repair it so it could sound at the Centennial Exposition being held in Philadelphia, but the idea was not adopted. The bell&#x27;s custodians concluded that it was unlikely that the metal could be made into a bell that would have a pleasant sound, and that the crack had become part of the bell&#x27;s character. Instead, a replica weighing , representing 1,000 pounds for each of the Thirteen Colonies, was cast. The metal used for what was dubbed &quot;the Centennial Bell&quot; included four melted-down cannons: one used by each side in the American Revolutionary War, and one used by each side in the American Civil War. The bell was rung at the Exposition grounds on July 4, 1876, and was later recast to improve the sound. The bell is currently attached to the clock in the steeple of Independence Hall. While the Liberty Bell was not displayed at the Centennial Exposition, a great many exposition visitors came to visit it. Its image was ubiquitous throughout the exposition grounds. Myriad souvenirs were sold bearing its image or shape, and state pavilions contained replicas of the bell made of substances ranging from stone to tobacco. In 1877, the bell was hung from the ceiling of the Assembly Room by a chain with thirteen links.

Between 1885 and 1915, the Liberty Bell was transported to seven expositions and celebrations. Each time, the bell traveled by railroad, and an extra number of rail stops were made along way so that local people could view it. By 1885, the Liberty Bell was widely recognized as a symbol of freedom, and as a treasured relic of independence and freedom, and was growing increasingly famous as versions of George Lippard&#x27;s legend were reprinted in history and school books. In early 1885, the city agreed to let it travel to New Orleans for the World Cotton Centennial exposition. Large crowds mobbed the bell at each stop. In Biloxi, Mississippi, the former President of the Confederate States of America, Jefferson Davis, visited the bell and delivered a speech paying homage to it and urging national unity. In 1893, it was sent to the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago, where it was the centerpiece of the state&#x27;s exhibit in the Pennsylvania Building. On July 4, 1893, in Chicago, the bell was serenaded with the first performance of &quot;The Liberty Bell March&quot;, conducted by John Philip Sousa. 

Philadelphians began to cool to the idea of sending it to other cities when it returned from Chicago bearing a new crack, and each new proposed journey met with increasing opposition. It was also found that the bell&#x27;s private watchman had been cutting off small pieces for souvenirs. Philadelphia placed the bell in a glass-fronted oak case. 

In 1898, it was taken out of the glass case and hung from its yoke again in the tower hall of Independence Hall, a room that would remain its home until the end of 1975. A guard was posted by the bell to prevent souvenir hunters who might otherwise chip at it.

By 1909, the bell was sent on six trips. The bell&#x27;s cracking worsened, and souvenir hunters had chipped off pieces of it, depriving it of over one percent of its weight. Its weight was reported as in 1904.

===20th century===
In 1912, the organizers of the Panama–Pacific International Exposition requested the bell for the 1915 fair in San Francisco, but Philadelphia was reluctant to let it travel again. The city finally agreed to let it be transported to San Francisco since it had never been west of St. Louis, and it was a chance to allow millions of Americans to see it who might never again have the opportunity. 

In 1914, fearing that the cracks might lengthen during the long train ride to San Francisco, Philadelphia installed a metal support structure inside the bell, called the &quot;spider&quot;. 

In February 1915, the bell was tapped gently with wooden mallets to produce sounds that were transmitted to the fair as the signal to open it, a transmission that also inaugurated transcontinental telephone service. Some five million Americans saw the bell on its train journey west. It is estimated that nearly two million kissed it at the fair, with an uncounted number viewing it. The bell was taken on a different route on its way home during which another five million people viewed it. 

In 1924, one of Independence Hall&#x27;s exterior doors was replaced by glass, allowing some view of the bell even when the building was closed. When Congress enacted the nation&#x27;s first peacetime draft in 1940, the first Philadelphians required to serve took their oaths of enlistment before the Liberty Bell. Once the war started, the bell was again a symbol, used to sell war bonds. 

Since the bell returned to Philadelphia, it has been moved out of doors only five times: three times for patriotic observances during and after World War I, and twice as the bell occupied new homes in 1976 and 2003. Chicago and San Francisco obtained its after presenting petitions signed by hundreds of thousands of children. In 1933, Chicago tried again, with a petition signed by 3.4 million schoolchildren, for the 1933 Century of Progress Exhibition and New York presented a petition to secure a visit from the bell for the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Both efforts failed.

In the early days of World War II, it was feared that the bell might be in danger from saboteurs or enemy bombing, and city officials considered moving the bell to Fort Knox, to be stored with the nation&#x27;s gold reserves. The idea provoked a storm of protest from around the nation, and was abandoned. Officials then considered building an underground steel vault above which it would be displayed, and into which it could be lowered if necessary. The project was dropped after studies concluded that the digging might undermine the foundations of Independence Hall. On December 17, 1944, the Whitechapel Bell Foundry offered to recast the bell at no cost as a gesture of Anglo-American friendship. The bell was again tapped on D-Day, as well as in victory on V-E Day and V-J Day.

After World War II, and following considerable controversy, the City of Philadelphia agreed that it would transfer custody of the bell and Independence Hall, while retaining ownership, to the federal government. The city would also transfer various colonial-era buildings it owned. Congress agreed to the transfer in 1948, and three years later Independence National Historical Park was founded, incorporating those properties and administered by the National Park Service (NPS or Park Service). The Park Service would be responsible for maintaining and displaying the bell. The NPS would also administer the three blocks just north of Independence Hall that had been condemned by the state, razed, and developed into a park, Independence Mall.

In the postwar period, the bell became a symbol of freedom used in the Cold War. The bell was chosen for the symbol of a savings bond campaign in 1950. The purpose of this campaign, as Vice President Alben Barkley put it, was to make the country &quot;so strong that no one can impose ruthless, godless ideologies on us&quot;. In 1955, former residents of nations behind the Iron Curtain were allowed to tap the bell as a symbol of hope and encouragement to their compatriots. Foreign dignitaries such as Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion and West Berlin Mayor Ernst Reuter were brought to the bell, and they commented that the bell symbolized the link between the United States and their nations. During the 1960s, the bell was the site of several protests, both for the civil rights movement, and by various protesters supporting or opposing the Vietnam War.

Almost from the start of its stewardship, the Park Service sought to move the bell from Independence Hall to a structure where it would be easier to care for the bell and accommodate visitors. The first such proposal was withdrawn in 1958, after considerable public protest. The Park Service tried again as part of the planning for the 1976 United States Bicentennial. The Independence National Historical Park Advisory Committee proposed in 1969 that the bell be moved out of Independence Hall, as the building could not accommodate the millions expected to visit Philadelphia for the Bicentennial. In 1972, the Park Service announced plans to build a large glass tower for the bell at the new visitors center at South Third Street and Chestnut Street, two blocks east of Independence Hall, at a cost of $5 million, but citizens again protested the move. Instead, in 1973, the Park Service proposed to build a smaller glass pavilion for the bell at the north end of Independence Mall, between Arch and Race streets. Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo agreed with the pavilion idea, but proposed that the pavilion be built across Chestnut Street from Independence Hall, which the state feared would destroy the view of the historic building from the mall area. Rizzo&#x27;s view prevailed, and the bell was moved to a glass-and-steel Liberty Bell Pavilion, about from its old home at Independence Hall, as the Bicentennial year began.

During the Bicentennial, members of the Procrastinators&#x27; Club of America jokingly picketed the Whitechapel Bell Foundry with signs &quot;We got a lemon&quot; and &quot;What about the warranty?&quot; The foundry told the protesters that it would be glad to replace the bell—so long as it was returned in the original packaging. 

In 1958, the foundry, then trading under the name Mears and Stainbank Foundry, had offered to recast the bell, and was told by the Park Service that neither it nor the public wanted the crack removed. The foundry was called upon, in 1976, to cast a full-size replica of the Liberty Bell (known as the Bicentennial Bell) that was presented to the United States by the British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, and was housed in the tower once intended for the Liberty Bell, at the former visitor center on South Third Street.

====Liberty Bell Center====


In 1995, the Park Service began preliminary work on a redesign of Independence Mall. Architects Venturi, Scott Brown &amp; Associates developed a master plan with two design alternatives. The first proposed a block-long visitors center on the south side of Market Street, that would also house the Liberty Bell. This would have interrupted the mall&#x27;s three-block vista of Independence Hall, and made the bell visible only from the south, on Chestnut Street. The second alternative placed a similar visitors center on the north side of Market Street, also interrupting the mall&#x27;s vista, with the bell in a small pavilion on the south side. City planner Edmund Bacon, who had overseen the mall&#x27;s design in the 1950s, saw preservation of the vista of Independence Hall as essential. He created his own plan that included a domed bell pavilion built north of Market Street. Public reaction to the possibility of moving the Liberty Bell so far from Independence Hall was strongly negative. NPS announced that the bell would remain on the block between Chestnut and Market streets. Other plans were proposed, each had strengths and weaknesses, but the goal of all was to encourage visitors to see more of the historical park than just the Liberty Bell.

The Olin Partnership was hired to create a new master plan for Independence Mall; its team included architect Bernard Cywinski, who ultimately won a limited design competition to design what was called the Liberty Bell Center (LBC). Cywinski&#x27;s design was unveiled in early 1999. Significantly larger than the existing pavilion, allowing for exhibit space and an interpretive center, the proposed LBC building also would cover about 15% of the footprint of the long-demolished President&#x27;s House, the &quot;White House&quot; of George Washington and John Adams. Archaeologists excavating the LBC&#x27;s intended site uncovered remnants of the 1790–1800 executive mansion that were reburied. The project became highly controversial when it was revealed that Washington&#x27;s slaves had been housed only feet from the planned LBC&#x27;s main entrance. The Park Service refused to redesign the LBC building, or delay its construction. NPS initially resisted interpreting the slaves and the slave quarters, but after years of protest by Black activists, agreed.

===21st century===
The new facility that opened hours after the bell was installed on October 9, 2003, is adjacent to an outline of Washington&#x27;s slave quarters marked in the pavement, with interpretive panels explaining the significance of what was found. The GPS address is 526 Market Street.

Inside the Liberty Bell Center, visitors pass through a number of exhibits about the bell before reaching the Liberty Bell itself. Due to security concerns following an attack on the bell by a visitor with a hammer in 2001, the bell is hung out of easy reach of visitors, who are no longer allowed to touch it, and all visitors undergo a security screening.

The Liberty Bell now weighs . Its metal is 70% copper and 25% tin, with the remainder consisting of lead, zinc, arsenic, gold, and silver. It hangs from what is believed to be its original yoke, made from American elm. Although the crack in the bell appears to end at the abbreviation &quot;Philada&quot; in the last line of the inscription, that is merely the widened crack, filed out during the 19th century to allow the bell to ring. A hairline crack, extending through to the inside of the bell, continues towards the right and gradually moves to the top of the bell, through the word &quot;and&quot; in &quot;Pass and Stow&quot;, then through the word &quot;the&quot; before the word &quot;Assembly&quot;, and finally through the letters &quot;rty&quot; in the word &quot;Liberty&quot;. The crack ends near the attachment with the yoke.

Professor Constance M. Greiff, in her book tracing the history of Independence National Historical Park, wrote of the Liberty Bell:

[T]he Liberty Bell is the most venerated object in the park, a national icon. It is not as beautiful as some other things that were in Independence Hall in those momentous days two hundred years ago, and it is irreparably damaged. Perhaps that is part of its almost mystical appeal. Like our democracy it is fragile and imperfect, but it has weathered threats, and it has endured.
== Legacy and commemorations ==
In addition to the replicas that are seen at Independence National Historical Park, early replicas of the Liberty Bell include the so-called Justice Bell or Women&#x27;s Liberty Bell, commissioned in 1915 by suffragists to advocate for women&#x27;s suffrage. This bell had the same legend as the Liberty Bell, with two added words, &quot;establish justice&quot;, words taken from the Preamble to the United States Constitution. It also had the clapper chained to the bell so it could not sound, symbolizing the inability of women, lacking the vote, to influence political events. The Justice Bell toured extensively to publicize the cause. After the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment (granting women the vote), the Justice Bell was brought to the front of Independence Hall on August 26, 1920, to finally sound. It remained on a platform before Independence Hall for several months before city officials required that it be taken away, and today is at the Washington Memorial Chapel at Valley Forge.

As part of the Liberty Bell Savings Bonds drive in 1950, 55 replicas of the Liberty Bell (one each for the 48 states, the District of Columbia, and the territories) were ordered by the United States Department of the Treasury and were cast in France by the Fonderie Paccard. The bells were to be displayed and rung on patriotic occasions. Today, many of the bells today are sited near state capitol buildings. Although Wisconsin&#x27;s bell is now at its state capitol, initially it was sited on the grounds of the state&#x27;s Girls Detention Center. Texas&#x27;s bell is located inside the Academic Building on the campus of Texas A&amp;M University in College Station. The Texas bell was presented to the university in appreciation of the service of the school&#x27;s graduates.

In 1950, too, an enlarged and slightly modified replica of the Liberty Bell, baptized Freedom Bell, was cast in England, brought to the United States, and toured the country as part of a &quot;Crusade of Freedom&quot;. It was then shipped to Germany and installed in the tower of West Berlin&#x27;s city hall. When Robert F. Kennedy visited the city in 1962, followed by his brother John F. Kennedy in June 1963, both drew a parallel between the Liberty Bell and the new Freedom Bell.

The Liberty Bell appeared on a commemorative coin in 1926 to mark the sesquicentennial of American independence. Its first use on a circulating coin was on the reverse side of the Franklin half dollar, struck between 1948 and 1963. It also appeared on the Bicentennial design of the Eisenhower dollar, superimposed against the moon.

On the 150th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in 1926, the U.S. Post Office issued a commemorative stamp depicting the Liberty Bell for the Sesquicentennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1926, though this stamp actually depicts the replica bell erected at the entrance to the exposition grounds. The Liberty Bell was chosen for the stamp design theme because the symbol was most representative of the nation&#x27;s independence. Since then the Liberty Bell has appeared on several other U.S. postage stamps, including the first forever stamp, issued since 2007.

An image of the Liberty Bell appears on the current $100 note. The image changes color, depending on the angle at which it is held.

The name &quot;Liberty Bell&quot; or &quot;Liberty Belle&quot; is commonly used for commercial purposes, and has denoted brands and business names ranging from a life insurance company to a Montana escort service. Walt Disney World has a replica of the Liberty Bell that is in Liberty Square in the Magic Kingdom. The replica was cast from the mold of the actual Liberty Bell in 1989. A large outline of the bell hangs over the right-field bleachers at Citizens Bank Park, home of the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team, and is illuminated and swings back and forth and a bell sound is played whenever one of their players hits a home run or if the Phillies win that game. This bell outline replaced one at the Phillies&#x27; former home, Veterans Stadium.

On April 1, 1996, Taco Bell announced via ads and press releases that it had purchased the Liberty Bell and changed its name to the Taco Liberty Bell. The bell, the ads related, would henceforth spend half the year at Taco Bell corporate headquarters in Irvine, California. Outraged calls flooded Independence National Historical Park, and Park Service officials hastily called a press conference to deny that the bell had been sold. After several hours, Taco Bell admitted that it was an April Fools&#x27; Day joke. Despite the protests, company sales of tacos, enchiladas, and burritos rose by more than a half million dollars that week.

<text>Selwyn College, Cambridge (formally Selwyn College in the University of Cambridge) is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge. The college was founded in 1882 by the Selwyn Memorial Committee in memory of George Augustus Selwyn (1809–1878), the first Bishop of New Zealand (1841–1868), and subsequently Bishop of Lichfield (1868–1878). Its main buildings consist of three courts built of stone and brick (Old Court, Ann&#x27;s Court, and Cripps Court). There are several secondary buildings, including adjacent townhouses and lodges serving as student hostels on Grange Road, West Road and Sidgwick Avenue. The college has some 60 fellows and 110 non-academic staff.

In 2019, Selwyn was ranked eighth on the Tompkins Table of Cambridge colleges in order of undergraduates&#x27; performances in examinations, having been first in 2008. The college was ranked 16th out of 30 in an assessment of college wealth conducted by the student newspaper &quot;Varsity&quot; in November 2006. Selwyn&#x27;s sister college at the University of Oxford is Keble College.

==History==
=== George Augustus Selwyn ===

The college was founded following the death of Bishop George Augustus Selwyn, who had played an important role in the establishment of New Zealand as its first bishop. Selwyn was a scholar of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and a member of the Cambridge crew which competed in the inaugural Boat Race in 1829. He came out second in the Classical Tripos in 1831, graduating Bachelor of Arts (BA) 1831, Master of Arts (MA Cantab) 1834, and Doctor of Divinity (DD) per lit. reg. 1842, and was a fellow of St John&#x27;s College from 1833 to 1840.

After graduating, Selwyn first taught at Eton College. In 1833, he was ordained deacon, and, in 1834, a priest. Selwyn displayed leadership talent and, in 1841, after an episcopal council held at Lambeth had recommended the appointment of a bishop for New Zealand, Charles James Blomfield, Bishop of London, offered the post to Selwyn.

He returned to England in 1867, and accepted the post of Bishop of Lichfield, which he held until his death on 11 April 1878, aged 69.

=== Foundation of the College ===

After Selwyn&#x27;s death in 1878, a number of scholars from Cambridge launched plans to establish a college to honour his life. The Selwyn Memorial Committee was founded with Charles Abraham (Bishop of Wellington) as secretary, and it proposed that a Cambridge college should be established as a memorial. The college&#x27;s first Master, Arthur Lyttelton, was formally elected on 10 March 1879, the Archbishop of Canterbury Archibald Tait was invited to become Visitor on 28 June 1878 and building of Old Court, as it is now known, began in 1880. 
The foundation stone of the college was laid by Edward Herbert, 3rd Earl of Powis in a ceremony on 1 June 1881, following a lunch in King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. A Charter of Incorporation was granted by Queen Victoria on 13 September 1882, and the west range of Old Court was ready for use by the college&#x27;s official opening (with the Master&#x27;s installation) on 10 October 1882, in time for Michaelmas term. Selwyn&#x27;s first 28 undergraduates joined the original master and 12 other Fellows at the then Public Hostel of the university in 1882.

The first master of the college was Arthur Lyttelton, who sought to establish the college on a firm academic and financial foundation. Lyttelton had been senior tutor at Keble College, Oxford. He came from a well-established family with strong connections in both Church and State, his mother being the sister-in-law of the prime minister, William Ewart Gladstone, who became a major benefactor of the college. Lyttelton was himself a life-long supporter of the Liberal party and was familiar with many politicians in Westminster, his wife Kathleen, a women&#x27;s activist, being the daughter of the Liberal MP George Clive. Lyttelton persuaded Gladstone to make a personal gift to the college of the louder of the two chapel bells. Gladstone reportedly believed that Cambridge students needed to be well woken if they were to get up at a productive time in the morning. Today, the chapel bell is known as &#x27;Gladstone&#x27;s Bell&#x27; by students.
The college was founded by donations and subscriptions, with a distinctly religious character. The royal charter for the college, reproducing the terms of the charter of Keble College, was sealed on 13 September 1882. The charter declared that the college was &quot;founded and constituted with the especial object and intent of providing persons desirous of academic education and willing to live economically with a College wherein sober living and high culture of the mind may be combined with Christian training based upon the principles of the Church of England&quot;. Initially, only baptised Christians were accepted as students or scholars. The original foundation charter specified that the college should &quot;make provision for those who intend to serve as missionaries overseas and ... educate the sons of clergymen&quot;.

Selwyn was not yet a full college of the university, but a &quot;Public Hostel&quot;, with its undergraduates regarded as non-collegiate and marked with the designation &quot;H. Selw.&quot; on Senate House lists.

=== Later development ===

In 1926 the &quot;Public Hostel&quot; status was abolished, replaced with that of &quot;Approved Foundation&quot;, granting more security to the college. The distinction of the college as &quot;H. Selw.&quot; on Senate House lists had also ceased from June 1924.

On 14 March 1958, Selwyn was granted full collegiate status.

Selwyn, in common with most other Oxford and Cambridge colleges, originally admitted only men, but was one of the first colleges to become mixed when women were admitted from 1976. In that year, women lived only on E and H Staircases, but in subsequent years could live anywhere in College. In 1999, Selwyn appointed the first female Director of Music in an Oxbridge College, Sarah MacDonald, and in 2009, Selwyn became the first Cambridge college to appoint a female head porter, Helen Stephens.

In the 2020s the college became known for its widening-participation and academic successes, admitting one of the highest proportions of maintained school (UK state schools) undergraduates of the Cambridge colleges (81% in 2023) while being ranked 1st for &#x27;good honours&#x27; examination results in 2024.

==Development==

The college founders purchased from Corpus Christi College of land which lay between Grange Road, West Road and Sidgwick Avenue on 3 November 1879 at a cost of £6,111 9s 7d. This parcel of land is still owned by the college and is the location of Old Court and Ann&#x27;s Court. The site was originally considered somewhat remote from the centre of the university, but Selwyn now neighbours the Sidgwick Site where several of the university&#x27;s arts and humanities faculties are. An alternative site on Lensfield Road, where Our Lady and the English Martyrs Church now stands, was considered but rejected as too small.

The chapel was built in 1895 before the dining hall (in 1909), and chapel attendance was compulsory for students from the college&#x27;s foundation until 1935. There were originally plans to build a permanent library between F Staircase and the chapel to complete Old Court, on land that now forms part of the College Gardens, but this was not done. The Selwyn College Library was opened in 1929, funded by subscriptions in honour of college members who had died in the First World War. In 1894 and 1896, respectively, the Old Library in the tower, received two extensive benefactions of history, politics and theological texts, from Canon William Cooke and Edward Wheatley-Balme. These large literary bequests gave Selwyn College an excellent working library.

The Jacobean-style Dining Hall was constructed under the tenure of the fourth Master of Selwyn College, Richard Appleton, who had previously been a senior fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. His appointment as Master continued the close relationship between Selwyn and Trinity which had been supportive of the younger college. Appleton served for two years from 1907 before he died of influenza. Despite his brief mastership, Appleton had managed to secure funding for the Dining Hall. Appleton&#x27;s initials and rebus (three apples and a tun) appear on the north wall of the Hall entrance, and his posthumously painted portrait hangs in the college. Construction on the dining hall began in 1909, but Appleton did not live to see the project completed.

The dining hall was always intended to be panelled, however, this vision could not be realised until the woodwork for the west side of the hall was presented in 1913 by the Magdalene fellow, A. C. Benson in memory of his father Archbishop Benson. This panelling came from the English Church in Rotterdam which was designed by the office of Sir Christopher Wren between 1699 and 1708.

University education was expensive at the time of Selwyn&#x27;s foundation, and given that Selwyn College was intended to be a place for young students who could not otherwise afford an Oxbridge education, the college charges were initially kept low. Undergraduates initially paid £27 per term for food, lodgings, lectures and tuition, with a small surcharge for students of medicine, scientists and engineers. This was raised to £28 in 1916, and £33 in 1918, as the number of scholars studying at Oxford and Cambridge drastically decreased due to the First World War.
==Buildings and grounds==

Old Court, construction of which began in 1880 and is built in Ketton stone and local red brick in the Victorian Late Perpendicular Gothic Revival style, was largely designed by Sir Arthur Blomfield and comprises seven staircases (A–G), together with a tower and gateway, Master&#x27;s Lodge, Chapel, Hall, Kitchens, Music Practice Room and Archives. Selwyn College Library is located adjacent to Old Court; it was designed by T. H. Lyon in 1929 to serve as a First World War memorial.

Cripps Court, named after the Cripps Foundation that donated most of the funds to build it (and which also funded developments at St John&#x27;s College, Queens&#x27; College and Magdalene College) was built and formally opened on 17 May 1969 on land on the opposite side of Grange Road which was originally owned by Jesus College. Selwyn&#x27;s Cripps Court features a tricolon design with ensuite rooms for students. Cripps Court comprises a further seven staircases (H–N) and is home to all of Selwyn&#x27;s first-year undergraduates, a few second-year undergraduates and postgraduates including their common room, the Middle Combination Room (MCR).

Ann&#x27;s Court, built on the land to the north of Old Court and south of West Road, is the most recent court. Its exterior reflects the atmosphere of the rest of the college with Ketton limestone and brick-work fixtures. Ann&#x27;s Court was designed by the traditionalist architect Demetri Porphyrios who has completed similar new projects at Magdalen College, Oxford, which also utilised hand-carved Ketton stone in its exteriors, and at Princeton University (Whitman College) in the United States. The golden-yellow Ketton stone used in Ann&#x27;s Court (and the rest of Selwyn College) has been used in the construction of Oxford and Cambridge colleges for several hundred years, and can be seen in the exterior of the Wren Library at Trinity College. The interior of Ann&#x27;s Court is contemporary and equipped with wooden staircases. As a proponent of New Classical Architecture, Porphyrios designed new buildings which fit the existing limestone and brick materials of Selwyn College. The Porphyrios Associates design involved a three-winged building which created the space for a large new court to be formed in the middle of the college, named Centre Court. Ann&#x27;s Court features hand-carved details and a series of limestone cloisters and chimneys arranged in the traditional Cambridge University fashion. Ann&#x27;s Court was named after Ann Dobson, who with her husband Christopher Dobson (who matriculated at Selwyn in 1957) formed the Ann Dobson Foundation, which is one of the principal donors towards the construction costs of Phases I and II. Phase I was completed in July 2005 and consists of 43 ensuite rooms and 15 administrative offices, forming two staircases (O and P) at a cost of £7.5 million. The second phase, including 40 en-suite bedrooms forming staircases Q and R and a new Junior Combination Room (JCR) at a cost of £2.5 million, was completed in Summer 2009. The college bar was refurbished in 2002, and redecorated in 2011.

The college has planning permission to develop further three phases of building, planned to be built as funding permits, which will extend the college&#x27;s distinctive limestone and red-brick façade along Grange Road to the corner of West Road. The plans consist of a new library and archives (Phase 3) behind Staircase E of Old Court, and two further accommodation blocks (Phase 4) to form a new court (tentatively named Library Court) between Old Court and Ann&#x27;s Court, and an auditorium, debate chamber, and conference facilities (Phase 5) to complete the west side of Ann&#x27;s Court.

Plans are currently underway to build a new library and auditorium located near Ann&#x27;s Court and the College Gardens. The college plan calls for all future expansions to adhere to the same architectural style of limestone and brick demonstrated in the Ann&#x27;s Court development. The Master Plan, also designed by Porphyrios Architects, calls for a new wing of student housing alongside Grange Road, located between Old Court and Ann&#x27;s Court. This new wing of accommodation would enclose the western edge of Centre Court and would allow the college to increase graduate student numbers. In 2018, the college assured concerned alumni and students that the original library would be preserved and converted into lecture and auditorium rooms (although the small 1970s annex will probably be removed). The building of a new library is a priority for Selwyn College and would complete the perimeter of a fourth collegiate court.

==Coat of arms and motto==
The Selwyn College coat of arms incorporates the arms of the Selwyn family impaled with an adaptation of the arms of the Diocese of Lichfield. The arms were granted in the 1960s and are emblazoned as follows;

:&quot;Per pale Gules and Argent a Cross potent quadrate Argent and Or between four crosses paty those to the dexter Argent those to the sinister Or For the See of Lichfield impaling Argent on a Bend cotised Sable three Annulets Or for Selwyn all within a Bordure Sable And for Crest On a Wreath Or &amp; Purpure In front of a Book erect bound Gules edged clasped and garnished Or a representation of the Pastoral Staff of Bishop Selwyn.&quot;

The dexter half of the arms adapted from those of the See of Lichfield, are unusual, with &quot;or&quot; (gold) countercharged on &quot;argent&quot; (silver), violating the rule of tincture, which prohibits a metal to be charged with another metal. This is thought to refer to the arms of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which also violates this rule. Selwyn&#x27;s pastoral staff or crozier is based on a hardwood Māori staff which is held in the College Chapel. The college was also granted an official badge, &quot;A Mitre Or within an Annulet Purpure&quot;.

Before an official grant by the College of Arms, Selwyn College used arms believed to be those borne by George Augustus Selwyn as Bishop of Lichfield; they are displayed above the main gateway, built in 1881, and on the Common Seal, first used in 1882.

The college motto is a biblical quotation from 1 Corinthians, chapter 16, verse 13, in Greek, &quot;ΑΝΔΡΙΖΕΣΘΕ&quot; (&quot;andrízesthe&quot;), translated in the King James Version as &quot;Quit ye like men&quot; (alternatively, in the Douay–Rheims version, &quot;Do manfully&quot; or, in the New American Bible, &quot;Be courageous&quot;). A longer extract of the verse, &quot;&quot;ΣΤΗΚΕΤΕ ΕΝ ΤΗ ΠΙΣΤΕΙ ΑΝΔΡΙΖΕΣΘΕ&quot;, is carved over the main College gate (the full Greek verse of 1 Corinthians 16:13 being &quot;Γρηγορεῖτε, στήκετε ἐν τῇ πίστει, ἀνδρίζεσθε, κραταιοῦσθε·&quot;&quot;; &quot;Grēgoreîte, stḗkete en têi pístei, andrízesthe, krataioûsthe&quot;).

==Traditions==
===Formal Hall===

Selwyn holds Formal Hall on every Tuesday and Thursday evening during Term at 7:30 pm with a capacity of 120, tickets for which can be bought by students for themselves and up to two guests. An additional Formal Hall was held on Sunday evenings at least until the early 1990s. There is also a special, extra Halfway Hall Formal for second-year students to mark the middle of their time as undergraduate students at the college, and a Christmas Formal for all students at the end of every Michaelmas Term. Selwyn holds several JCR Dinners and MCR Dinners specifically for undergraduate and graduate students each term.

Formal Halls are for students, Fellows and the Master of the college; however, members of other Oxbridge colleges may attend, as well as a limited number of guests from outside the university. Formal hall meals are three- or four-course meals which are fully catered and served by college staff. During formal hall, the fellows and the master of the college sit at the High Table near the front of the hall, while students sit on benches or chairs at the long tables.

====Latin Grace====
The college Grace is recited in Latin by a Fellow or Scholar (a student who achieved a First Class mark overall in the previous year) at the beginning of Formal Hall, and is as follows:
&quot;Benedic, Domine, nobis et donis Tuis, quae de Tua largitate sumus sumpturi; et concede ut iis muneribus Tuis ad laudem Tuam utamur, gratisque animis fruamur, per Jesum Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.&quot;

Translation:
Bless us, O Lord, and all thy gifts, which of thy goodness we are about to enjoy; grant that we may use these generosities to thy glory, and enjoy them with thankful hearts, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

When the High Table rises, the following concluding Grace is said &quot;Benedicamus Domino&quot; (Let us bless the Lord), with the response being &quot;Laus Deo&quot; (Praise be to God). This response was changed in the 1990s, from the previous response &quot;Deo gratias&quot; (Thanks be to God).

====Loyal toast====
Selwyn has a tradition in which senior fellows and members of the college commonly remain seated for the college&#x27;s loyal toast during formal hall. This tradition is not observed out of disrespect or irreverence for the sovereign, but rather, out of courtesy and remembrance of the former Master of the college, John Selwyn, who could not easily stand for the loyal toast owing to the limited use of his legs in later life. John Selwyn (son of George Augustus Selwyn) served as the second Master of Selwyn College (1893–1898).

===Lecture series===
Selwyn College hosts an annual lecture named in honour of Ramsay Murray, an alumnus of the college during the 1930s. The Ramsay Murray Lecture Series was established in 1994 following a significant bequest from the Murray estate. Lecturers have included many high-profile politicians, academics, and journalists including Onora O’Neill, Niall Ferguson, Michael Howard, Ian Kershaw, Roy Porter, Ian Clark, Lawrence Freedman, David Cannadine, Keith Thomas, Jonathan Riley-Smith and Quentin Skinner, former Regius Professor of Modern History. The 2018 Ramsay Murray lecture features the journalist Frank Gardner. The lectures are free and open to the public.

==Student life==

Selwyn has a reputation as one of the most traditional but friendliest Oxbridge colleges. The college is visited by many members of the university who come from the neighbouring Sidgwick Site in-between lectures and supervisions to take advantage of Selwyn&#x27;s Servery and Dining Hall. Similarly, Formal Swaps are regularly arranged by the student councils to allow students from other Oxford and Cambridge colleges to dine at Selwyn during Formal Hall. Students of Selwyn College are required to wear their gowns to all formal halls, ceremonies and college functions. The Selwyn gown is made of a thick black cloth with dark navy blue inline lapels.

===Common rooms===
Selwyn College Junior Combination Room (JCR) is the students&#x27; union for undergraduates students. Elected in Michaelmas term, it organises social and welfare events, negotiates with the college on the students&#x27; behalf, and represents Selwyn on Cambridge University Students&#x27; Union (CUSU) Council. JCR is affiliated to CUSU and by extension to the National Union of Students. In recent years, four presidents of Selwyn College JCR have become CUSU president, one of whom, Wes Streeting MP, went on to become president of the National Union of Students and a Labour Member of Parliament (MP). Another JCR President, Simon Hughes, went on to become a Liberal Democrat MP and candidate for Mayor of London.

The Middle Combination Room (MCR) comprises the graduate students of Selwyn College, and is similarly represented by the MCR Committee (MCRc). The MCR is located in Cripps Court. The presidents and treasurers of the JCRc and MCRc have sat on College Council, the main decision-making body of the college, since it was reformed in 1989.
===Student societies===
The college is host to a number of student organisations, including the Hermes Club, Selwyn College Music Society and Selwyn Jazz, and on the stage by amateur dramatics society The Mighty Players. Selwyn College Boat Club is the official rowing club. Selwyn has the longest continually running students&#x27; magazine— of any Cambridge College; &quot;Kiwi&quot; has been published from 1982 to present.

The chapel choir is a mixed choir that sings three weekly services during full term, has toured widely and has made over 15 commercial CD recordings under their professional director, Sarah MacDonald. The Choir has also included members of the neighbouring women&#x27;s college, Newnham College, since before the integration of women to Selwyn.

===Unofficial societies===
Like many Oxbridge colleges, Selwyn is reported to be home to secret societies and dining clubs including The Controversialists, The Cromwells, and The Templars. Some of these societies appear to function as &quot;de facto&quot; discussion and debate clubs while others appear to be drinking societies and for raucous parties. In the past there was a reported incident that brought a society into disrepute: in 2014, it was reported that members of Selwyn Templars were involved in a scandal where sexist and misogynistic messages were sent to members of the society.
====The Controversialists====
The Controversialists are the oldest secret society at the college and one of the oldest at the university, being founded by a group of students in Lent Term, 1893. The society&#x27;s name is believed to pay homage to both their leftist political leanings and their discussion and debate of poetry and literature. The purpose of the Society, according to rules printed in 1909, was &quot;the reading and discussion of English poetry and drama&quot;. The Society membership was made up of both undergraduate and graduate students at Selwyn College. Female students were able to join the society since women were admitted to the college. The total number of Controversialist members is not allowed to exceed twelve. Meetings are traditionally to be held on Sundays in the Michaelmas and Lent terms, as well as in May if a quorum of five members can be arranged. The badge and symbol of the Controversialists is a purple lyre.

The Controversialists commonly organise smoking concerts where poetry and verse is recited by members before the political discussions.

====The Templars====
The Selwyn College Templars are reputed to be the second oldest secret society and the largest at the college. The society was initially only open to wealthy, upper-class Anglican students. The membership of the Templars Society were often involved with campus politics and were often members of the Cambridge University Conservative Association. Membership was to be decided by nomination from two current members and election at the society&#x27;s Michaelmas meeting. New members of the Templars are reportedly &#x27;knighted&#x27; with a ceremonial sword in a bizarre initiation ceremony that takes place on the Autumn equinox each year.

In 2014, a Cambridge student newspaper reported that the Selwyn Templars Society were involved in a scandal where sexist and misogynistic messages were sent to members of the society. The college condemned the content of the reported messages.

===Hermes Club===
The Hermes Club, founded in 1920, exists to encourage, fund and improve sport at Selwyn College – a task it accomplishes by offering financial grants to individual sportsmen/women and college teams, through the lobbying of college, and by generally raising the profile of sport in Selwyn. Members of Selwyn are eligible for invitation to the club if they have been awarded a Full Blue or Half Blue by the university, if they have captained a Selwyn College team in a &#x27;First Class sport&#x27;, or if they have competed on behalf of Selwyn in two &#x27;First Class&#x27; Cuppers competitions.

Alumni of the club fund two major sports grant schemes which award thousands of pounds in grants every year – the Hermes Fund and the Vickerstaff Sports Bursary Scheme. Many members of the Hermes Club have gone on to become prominent in public life, particularly as politicians, actors and authors.

===Winter and May balls===

Selwyn is unique among Oxbridge colleges in that it holds an annual Winter Ball known as the Selwyn Snowball, which traditionally takes place on the night of the last Friday of Michaelmas term. In recent years the Snowball has developed into a larger event than it had been in the mid-1990s and now runs three full stages, with recent headliners including Mumford &amp; Sons and Tinchy Stryder, and caters for around 850 guests. The Selwyn Snowball has become better known than its May Ball which has been held in June of some years, after students have finished their examinations.

The May Ball tradition at Selwyn began on 14 June 1948, as hundreds of students dressed in black tie to attend the all-night celebration. May Balls continued to be held at the college throughout the second half of the 20th century with a highlight being the performance of The Who in 1967. In recent years, May Balls have been replaced by the Snowball with notable exceptions: 2008, to celebrate the college&#x27;s 125th anniversary; 2015 and 2017.

===Selwyn College Boat Club===

The Selwyn College Boat Club (SCBC) is the rowing club for members of the college. The boat club was founded in 1882, during the Michaelmas term. During this early period, the Selwyn Boat Club trained several rowers who would go on to become Olympic Rowers and University Blues in the annual boat race against Oxford. The SCBC also achieved intercollegiate success during its early days, winning a second in the Lent Bumps of 1934 and third in the May Bumps 1931. The dedication and work of the early Selwyn rowers was all the more fitting given that George Augustus Selwyn had rowed for Cambridge in the first Boat Race at Henley-on-Thames in 1829. The SCBC still has one of the highest participation rates of novice rowers of any Oxbridge college. Notable alumni of the Selwyn College Boat Club include Hugh Laurie, Tom Hollander and Richard Budgett.

In 2014, Selwyn, King&#x27;s and Churchill colleges announced plans for a new, state-of-the-art combined boathouse located on the River Cam. The boathouse features double-length beams and extensive gym and training facilities for all Selwyn College rowers and student athletes. This facility was completed in 2015–16 and now provides world-class rowing and training facilities for SCBC rowers and students across the University of Cambridge. The project was largely funded by donations and contributions from alumni and the Hermes Club. The two-storey combined boathouse is larger than its 1968 predecessor and provides facilities for socialising, training and boat maintenance in addition to an observation deck. The combined boathouse was designed by RHP Architects at a cost of approximately £2.20 million and was the winner of the 2017 RIBA East Award for Outstanding Architecture.

==In popular culture==

*In Tom Sharpe&#x27;s &quot;Porterhouse Blue&quot; novel, Selwyn College is satirically described as a college founded by &#x27;social justice&#x27; devotees. However, the reference does not occur in the Channel 4 television adaption of &quot;Porterhouse Blue&quot;. In the sequel, &quot;Grantchester Grind&quot;, Selwyn is described as an &quot;academic forcing-house&quot;, as compared with the lax academic standards of the fictional Porterhouse College.
*Selwyn College features in several scenes from the 2014 film &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot; which portrays the life of physicist Stephen Hawking.

<doc id="145459" wikidata="Q126998" url="?curid=145459" title="Logical link control">
<text>In the IEEE 802 reference model of computer networking, the logical link control (LLC) data communication protocol layer is the upper sublayer of the data link layer (layer 2) of the seven-layer OSI model. The LLC sublayer acts as an interface between the medium access control (MAC) sublayer and the network layer. 

The LLC sublayer provides multiplexing mechanisms that make it possible for several network protocols (e.g. IP, IPX and DECnet) to coexist within a multipoint network and to be transported over the same network medium. It can also provide flow control and automatic repeat request (ARQ) error management mechanisms.

==Operation==
The LLC sublayer is primarily concerned with multiplexing protocols transmitted over the MAC layer (when transmitting) and demultiplexing them (when receiving).
It can also provide node-to-node flow control and error management.

The flow control and error management capabilities of the LLC sublayer are used by protocols such as the NetBIOS Frames protocol. However, most protocol stacks running atop 802.2 do not use LLC sublayer flow control and error management. In these cases flow control and error management are taken care of by a transport layer protocol such as TCP or by some application layer protocol. These higher layer protocols work in an end-to-end fashion, i.e. re-transmission is done from the original source to the final destination, rather than on individual physical segments. For these protocol stacks only the multiplexing capabilities of the LLC sublayer are used.

==Application examples==

===X.25 and LAPB===
An LLC sublayer was a key component in early packet switching networks such as X.25 networks with the LAPB data link layer protocol, where flow control and error management were carried out in a node-to-node fashion, meaning that if an error was detected in a frame, the frame was retransmitted from one switch to next instead. This extensive handshaking between the nodes made the networks slow.

===Local area network===
The IEEE 802.2 standard specifies the LLC sublayer for all IEEE 802 local area networks, such as IEEE 802.3/Ethernet (when Ethernet II frame format is not used), IEEE 802.5, and IEEE 802.11. IEEE 802.2 is also used in some non-IEEE 802 networks such as FDDI.

====Ethernet ====
Since bit errors are very rare in wired networks, Ethernet does not provide flow control or automatic repeat request (ARQ), meaning that incorrect packets are detected but only cancelled, not retransmitted (except in case of collisions detected by the CSMA/CD MAC layer protocol). Instead, retransmissions rely on higher-layer protocols.
As the EtherType in an Ethernet frame using Ethernet II framing is used to multiplex different protocols on top of the Ethernet MAC header it can be seen as an LLC identifier. However, Ethernet frames lacking an EtherType have no LLC identifier in the Ethernet header, and, instead, use an IEEE 802.2 LLC header after the Ethernet header to provide the protocol multiplexing function.

====Wireless LAN====
In wireless communications, bit errors are very common. In wireless networks such as IEEE 802.11, flow control and error management is part of the CSMA/CA MAC protocol, and not part of the LLC layer. The LLC sublayer follows the IEEE 802.2 standard.

===HDLC===
Some non-IEEE 802 protocols can be thought of as being split into MAC and LLC layers. For example, while HDLC specifies both MAC functions (framing of packets) and LLC functions (protocol multiplexing, flow control, detection, and error control through retransmission of dropped packets when indicated), some protocols such as Cisco HDLC can use HDLC-like packet framing and their own LLC protocol.

===PPP and modems===
Over telephone network modems, PPP link layer protocols can be considered as a LLC protocol, providing multiplexing, but it does not provide flow control and error management. In a telephone network, bit errors might be common, meaning that error management is crucial, but that is today provided by modern protocols. Today&#x27;s modem protocols have inherited LLC features from the older LAPM link layer protocol, made for modem communication in old X.25 networks.

===Cellular systems===
The GPRS LLC layer also does ciphering and deciphering of SN-PDU (SNDCP) packets.

===Power lines===
Another example of a data link layer which is split between LLC (for flow and error control) and MAC (for multiple access) is the ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides high-speed local area networking over existing home wiring (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables).

<doc id="145461" wikidata="Q41580" url="?curid=145461" title="Axel Munthe">
<text>Axel Martin Fredrik Munthe (31 October 1857 – 11 February 1949) was a Swedish-born physician and psychiatrist, best known as the author of &quot;The Story of San Michele&quot;, an autobiographical account of his life and work. He spoke several languages (Swedish, English, French, Italian fluently, and German at least passably), grew up in Sweden, attended medical school there, then studied medicine in Paris and opened his first practice in France. He was married to a wealthy Englishwoman and spent most of his adult life in Italy. 

His philanthropic nature often led him to treat the poor without charge, and he risked his life on several occasions to offer medical help in times of war, disaster or plague. As an advocate of animal rights, he purchased land to create a bird sanctuary near his home in Italy, argued for bans on painful traps, and himself kept pets as diverse as an owl and a baboon, as well as many types of dog. His writing is light-hearted, being primarily memoirs drawn from his real-life experiences, but it is often tinged with sadness or tragedy, and often uses dramatic licence. He primarily wrote about people and their idiosyncrasies, portraying the foibles of both the rich and the poor, but also about animals.

==Early life==

Axel Munthe was born in Oskarshamn, Sweden, his family&#x27;s home. His family was originally of Flemish descent, and settled in Sweden during the 16th century.

Munthe began college in 1874 at Uppsala University. While travelling in Italy in 1875, Munthe sailed in a small boat from Sorrento to the island of Capri. Climbing the Phoenician Steps to the village of Anacapri, he came upon a peasant&#x27;s house and the adjacent ruin of a chapel dedicated to San Michele, and was immediately captivated by the idea of rebuilding the ruin and turning it into a home.

Munthe studied medicine in Uppsala, Montpellier and Paris (where he was a student of Charcot), and graduated as M.D. in 1880 at the age of 23. Though his thesis was on the subjects of gynaecology and obstetrics, Munthe was deeply impressed by Professor Jean-Martin Charcot&#x27;s pioneering work in neurology, having attended his lectures at the Salpêtrière hospital. He later had a falling out with Charcot, and left the Salpêtrière denouncing his former teacher&#x27;s work on hypnotism as fraudulent and scientifically unsound.

Parents and siblings

He was the youngest of three siblings born to sickly, autocratic, violin playing, puritanical, chemist father Martin Arnold Fredrick Munthe (#-1877) and his second wife Louisa Aurora Ugarsky (# - 1878). 
The eldest was Anna (b. 1854) who married twice. At 21 she married the painter Reinhold Norstedt, during which times her flower paintings were exhibited in the National Galleries and other galleries. After Norstedt&#x27;s death in 1911, she married Frans Siberg, a veterinarian.

The second child was Arnold a future Artist, Author, playwright and Retired Swedish Naval Captain (# - 1927) who served with the French Imperial Fleet produced and wrote several renown plays Magnus Stenbok, Magdalena Rudenskiold and The March over the Belt. Arnold also wrote the several Naval books including Charles XII and the Russian Navy and the textbooks Swedish Naval Heroes series.

==Paris and Italy==
After graduation, Munthe opened a medical practice in Paris, largely catering to the members of the Scandinavian art colony there. He for example rented a Paris apartment to Finnish painter Albert Edelfelt and his wife. In 1884 he travelled to Naples to offer medical assistance in a cholera epidemic.

In 1887, he moved to Capri, bought the Villa San Michele and began restoration, doing much of the work himself, but also employing local residents, including three brothers and their father.

In 1890, running low on money for the project, he opened a practice in Rome which catered to foreign dignitaries as well as the local population. From this point onwards he divided his time between Rome and Capri.

==Queen Victoria of Sweden==

In 1892, Munthe was appointed physician to the Swedish royal family. In particular, he served as personal physician of the Crown Princess, Victoria of Baden, continuing to do so when she became Queen consort, and until the time of her death in 1930, although this did not mean that he was in constant attendance.

Victoria suffered from severe bronchitis and possibly also tuberculosis. Munthe recommended that she spend her winters on Capri for her health. While initially hesitant, in the autumn of 1910 she travelled to Capri, and from then onwards, except during the First World War and for a few years towards the end of her life, she spent several months each year there.

While in residence the Queen often visited the Villa San Michele to join Munthe for morning walks around the island. Munthe and the Queen also arranged evening concerts at San Michele, at which the Queen played the piano. The Queen shared Munthe&#x27;s love of animals, owning a pet dog herself, and helped support his efforts to purchase Mount Barbarossa to establish it as a bird sanctuary. Perhaps inevitably, given the small local population and their close friendship, it was rumoured that Munthe and the Queen were lovers, but this has never been substantiated.

Young Princess Maria, who by request of King Gustaf V of Sweden twice stayed with her mother-in-law the Queen and Munthe at Capri, found his influence damaging and his powers hypnotic. Years later she asserted that he wanted her to be his patient at age 23 and made physical advances toward her, and that the horror she then felt toward the Swedish royal family, because of their unlimited support of Munthe, was the main reason she fled them and filed for divorce from Prince Wilhelm.

Munthe has been described as less interested in the health of his patients than in his own convenience and fame, and his having Victoria travel to Capri, and stay there for months in that particular climate, has been considered more detrimental than beneficial to her health.

Other indication of his passionate nature concerns an affair he is believed to have had with the English socialite Lady Ottoline Morrell, beginning when they first met in July or August 1898. Ottoline was then an unmarried 25-year-old member of the privileged London social scene, while being at the same time slightly contemptuous of it. Her intellectual and spiritual interests drew her to more mature men, such as H. H. Asquith, particularly if they had a reputation for iconoclasm. She and Axel Munthe were drawn to each other, and managed to spend much private time together on Capri.

==Marriages==
Axel Munthe married Ultima Hornberg, a Swede, on 24 November 1880, whom he met while she was studying art in Paris. They divorced in the late 1880s, and in 1892 she married a Swedish manufacturer named Gustaf Richter, and gave birth to a son in 1893, before dying in 1895.

In 1907, Munthe married Hilda Pennington-Mellor (1876–1967). They had two sons, Peter and Malcolm. There is an anecdote that when Munthe was discussing &quot;The Story of San Michele&quot; with his publisher, John Murray, in the garden at Southside, Murray told him that his ancestor and namesake John Murray (1778–1843) had sat in the same garden with Lord Byron to discuss publication of Byron&#x27;s works.

During 1910–1911, Munthe had a 14-room summer home built in Sweden as a gift to his wife. It was originally called &quot;Stengården&quot; (&quot;The Stone Court&quot;), but has been known as &quot;Hildasholm&quot; since her death. It is set amongst trees on the shore of Lake Siljan in Dalarna, and the architect was Torben Grut, who also designed the Stockholm Stadium used for the 1912 Summer Olympics. Hilda landscaped the home with an English garden as part of the dramatic rocky surroundings, and furnished it with 17th, 18th and 19th-century art and furniture from Italy, England and France.

The family usually stayed in the house during the summer, but Munthe was more often at the San Michele.

==First World War==
During the First World War, Munthe became a British citizen and served in the ambulance corps. His wartime experiences were the basis for his book, &quot;Red Cross, Iron Cross&quot;.

==Later life==

In 1919–1920, Munthe was an unwilling landlord to the outrageous socialite and muse Luisa Casati, who took possession of Villa San Michele. This period was described by Scottish author Compton Mackenzie in his diaries.

Munthe developed an eye condition which eventually made him virtually blind and unable to tolerate the bright Italian sunlight. At that point he returned to Sweden for a number of years and wrote &quot;The Story of San Michele&quot; (published in 1929), which was well received, having been translated into at least 45 languages and said to be one of the best-selling books of the 20th century.

An operation restored his sight, and he spent several more years at San Michele before returning to Sweden in 1942. He spent the final years of his life as an official guest of the King of Sweden.

During the Second World War, Munthe&#x27;s son Malcolm Pennington Mellor Munthe served with the Special Operations Executive, working behind Nazi lines in occupied Scandinavia, and later participating in the Allied invasion at Anzio. Malcolm Munthe was seriously wounded during the war, and later developed reclusive tendencies.

Munthe died at Stockholm Palace aged 91. His body was cremated and the ashes were scattered into the North Sea. A memorial plaque about him and his family can be found at the Protestant Cemetery in Rome.

==Medical outlook==
Munthe tried to avoid prescription medication for his psychological cases whenever possible, often recommending hypnosis, music, and other alternative medical approaches. He was peripherally involved in Louis Pasteur&#x27;s search for a rabies vaccine. He advocated euthanasia for hopeless medical situations such as rabies, where the patient is condemned to a prospect of intense pain and mental anguish.

==Publications==
&quot;The Story of San Michele&quot; overshadows all Munthe&#x27;s other publications, and includes material from some earlier works. His earlier work can be very difficult to find and often commands high prices.

Aside from his doctoral thesis, his first publications consisted of accounts of his travels which appeared in the &quot;Stockholms Dagblad&quot; newspaper, and which described his experiences of relief work during the cholera epidemic in Naples. These articles were published in 1887 as a book translated into English by Maude Valerie White. The second edition of 1899 was translated by Munthe himself.

&quot;Vagaries&quot; was first published in London in 1898. It was retitled &quot;Memories and Vagaries&quot; in a second edition printed in 1908. In 1930 there was a third edition, containing an added preface and a slightly different selection of stories in a different order.

Munthe&#x27;s reminiscences of his time in the ambulance corps, &quot;Red Cross, Iron Cross&quot; was published anonymously – &quot;by a doctor in France&quot; – in London in 1916, with all proceeds being donated to the French Red Cross. A second edition, credited to Munthe, was published around 1930.

===Publications in languages other than English===
*Små Skizzer, Stockholm, 1888

==Legacy==

Munthe died in 1949 aged 91, in Stockholm. Several of his properties are now museums and cultural centres. He willed Villa San Michele to the Swedish nation, and it is maintained by a Swedish foundation. The complex functions as a cultural centre, hosting concerts, visiting Swedish scholars, and the local Swedish consulate. The foundation also maintains the Mount Barbarossa bird sanctuary, which covers over 55,000 square metres.

In 1980, a foundation (Stiftelsen Hildasholm) was established to care for &quot;Hildasholm&quot;, the Munthes&#x27; Swedish home. Malcolm Munthe donated the home and the art and antiques it contains to the foundation, which operates it as a museum. It was designated a historic building in 1988, and underwent extensive restoration between 1995 and 1999. In addition to tours, the museum hosts art classes and concerts.

Malcolm Munthe spent much of his life after the second world war remodelling the family&#x27;s two mansions in England. His children formed the Pennington-Mellor-Munthe Charity Trust which maintains both Southside and Hellens Manor and operates them as museums, also hosting cultural events such as concerts, lectures and literary events. Members of the family still sometimes reside at them.

There have been at least two international symposia on Munthe, the second being held at &quot;Hildasholm&quot; in Leksand, Sweden, on 13 September 2003. Speakers included Dr. Ian McDonald, Levente Erdeos (architect, and former curator of San Michele), the Swedish author Bengt Jangfeldt, Dr. Peter Cottino (from Capri), Mårten Lindståhl, Dr. Katriona Munthe-Lindgren, and Professor Alden Smith from the Department of Classics at Baylor University.

He was the subject of a 1962 biopic &quot;Axel Munthe, The Doctor of San Michele&quot;, based on his memoirs.

<text>Rayne is a village of about 2,300 residents in the Braintree district of Essex in the East of England.

It lies on the Roman road called Stane Street, about two miles (3 km) to the west of Braintree, which is the nearest town.

It used to be a more important settlement than Braintree in Norman times, although this has not been the case for a long time now.

Rayne has a playing field, a pub called The Swan, a village hall that overlooks the playing field, All Saints&#x27; church, a war memorial, a stream called Pod&#x27;s Brook, and a small airfield. There are also the old manor house of Rayne Hall, and Old Hall; a previous Rectory. Rayne Hall was for a long time the home of the Capel family, who became Earls of Essex. In mediaeval times, the Church was known for healing miracles: it was said that infertile women visiting the church were later able to conceive. A number of the churchyard memorials are made of cast iron: these were manufactured at the former foundry in The Street at around the end of the nineteenth century using a common mould into which individual letters were inserted to spell out the details.

The church building consists of the Tudor tower, built in 1510, a Nave (an 1840 construction, replacing a Norman building from 1199 and said to be unsafe) and a Sanctuary and Vestry, added in 1914. The earliest recorded Rector is Ralph de Fremingham, from 1260.

Further west along the main road (&quot;The Street&quot;), there are: an Indian restaurant, another pub, the &quot;Welsh Princess&quot;, the site of the former Rayne Iron foundry (redeveloped for housing and offices in 2009), the Post Office stores, and what was a pub called &quot;The Cock&quot;, now renovated and operating as a bar and restaurant called &quot;47 The Street&quot;. The road leads to the town of Great Dunmow.

Station Road leads down to the former Rayne railway station, which is now the Rayne Station Centre of the Flitch Way Country Park, a linear park stretching along the former trackbed of the railway. This is also now National Cycle Network route No. 16.

Rayne, which is located about north-east of London, is twinned with Verberie which is about north-east of Paris in the French region of Picardy, which coincidentally is twinned with the County of Essex.

On 12 July 2006, Rayne was named Essex Village of the Year, in a competition organised annually by Rural Community Council of Essex (RCCE) and sponsored by Calor. Rayne also won first, the regional, and then national, Calor Village of the Year Competition 2006/7 in the ITC Category.

<doc id="145469" wikidata="Q1028111" url="?curid=145469" title="Greg Howe (album)">
<text>Greg Howe is the first studio album by guitarist Greg Howe, released in 1988 by Shrapnel Records. Prior to its recording, Howe had sent a demo tape to Shrapnel founder Mike Varney in 1987, after which he was signed to the label.

==Critical reception==
Andy Hinds at AllMusic described &quot;Greg Howe&quot; as &quot;fresh compared to the melodramatic work of peers like, say, Vinnie Moore&quot; and &quot;a high-octane, indulgent rock romp. Worth hearing.&quot; He also listed &quot;Kick It All Over&quot; and &quot;The Pepper Shake&quot; as highlights. Martin Popoff in his &quot;Collector&#x27;s Guide to Heavy Metal&quot; found the album &quot;not all heavy, but for the most part, fruity, pop-tastic and colourful&quot;, while Howe&#x27;s guitar playing reminded him of George Lynch.

In a 2009 article by &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine, the album was ranked 10th on the all-time top 10 list of shred albums. As of 2006 it remains Howe&#x27;s best-selling release.

<doc id="145473" wikidata="Q521172" url="?curid=145473" title="Franco Columbu">
<text>Francesco Maria Columbu (August 7, 1941 – August 30, 2019) was an Italian-American bodybuilder and actor.

Originally a boxer, Columbu won the Mr. Olympia in 1976 and 1981, and competed in the inaugural edition of the World&#x27;s Strongest Man in 1977, where he placed fifth. He also had an acting career and authored numerous books on bodybuilding and nutrition. Columbu was inducted into the IFBB Hall of Fame in 2001, International Sports Hall of Fame in 2013 and received the Arnold Classic Lifetime Achievement Award in 2009.

==Early life==
Columbu was born on August 7, 1941, in Ollolai on the island of Sardinia, Italy. He was a son of shepherds Maria Grazia Sedda and Antonio Columbu. He said in 1982: &quot;I was always skinny. Until I was 11, I got beat up a lot. Then one day, I started beating people up. Nobody could touch me.&quot; He worked as a shepherd while training as a boxer. He won over 30 fights as a boxer before quitting the sport in favor of weightlifting and bodybuilding, stating: &quot;Boxing&#x27;s too rough on your face and head.&quot;

Columbu moved to Germany at a young age for work, and met Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1965 at a bodybuilding competition in Stuttgart, Germany. Columbu formed a lifelong friendship with Schwarzenegger, and was Schwarzenegger&#x27;s best man for his marriage to Maria Shriver in 1986 and godfather to their daughter Christina. Columbu and Schwarzenegger remained very close friends until Columbu&#x27;s death, with Schwarzenegger stating in 2016, &quot;He was my favourite training partner four decades ago and he is my favourite training partner today.&quot;

==Athletic career==
With Schwarzenegger, Columbu moved to California in the late 1960s to train and work with Joe Weider. Weider provided them with a place to live and an $80 () per week stipend. The stipend was not enough to live on, so to support their bodybuilding careers, they began a bricklaying company named European Brick Works in 1969.

At and a competition weight of around , Columbu won the IFBB Mr. Europe and Mr. Universe titles in 1970, and the 1971 IFBB Mr. World. He won the lightweight class of the 1974 and 1975 IFBB Mr. Olympias, before winning the overall competition for the first time in 1976.

Columbu participated in the inaugural edition of the World&#x27;s Strongest Man in 1977. He placed fifth, behind four men who outweighed him by around . During the event, he dislocated his left knee while carrying a refrigerator on his back. The injury kept him out of competition for a few years, and he received a reported $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in compensation. Columbu returned to win the 1981 Mr. Olympia then retired from competition.

Known for his strength, Columbu&#x27;s clean and jerk record was , his bench press record was , his squat record was , and his deadlift record was . He was named in &quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot; in 1978 for bursting a hot water bottle by blowing into it, which he achieved in 55 seconds.

==Acting, writing, directing, and producing careers==
Columbu appeared as himself in the 1977 bodybuilding docudrama &quot;Pumping Iron&quot;. He was the body building coach for Sylvester Stallone in the film &quot;&quot; (1985), and had roles in films that starred Schwarzenegger, including &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; (1982), &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984), and &quot;The Running Man&quot; (1987). In addition, Columbu&#x27;s name appears during the opening credits of Schwarzenegger&#x27;s &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; as the director of fictional film &quot;Jack Slater IV&quot;.

Columbu&#x27;s later films, also as a writer and producer, included the cult film &quot;Beretta&#x27;s Island&quot;, (1993), &quot;Doublecross on Costa&#x27;s Island&quot;, which he also directed and &quot;Ancient Warriors&quot; (2003). These three films were almost entirely shot in his homeland of Sardinia. He was also featured, as an actor, in the low budget production of &quot;&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Columbu lived in Los Angeles from the 1970s. He was a licensed chiropractor, earning his degree from Cleveland Chiropractic College in 1977. He appeared in television commercials and magazines advertisements for Vitalis &quot;Super Hold&quot; hairspray in 1977. Columbu returned to his hometown of Ollolai in Sardinia every year towards the end of August to attend the local festivities. Columbu became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1983.

On August 30, 2019, after feeling unwell while swimming off the coast of San Teodoro, Sardinia, Columbu died during transportation by helicopter to a hospital in Olbia, at age 78. A funeral was held in his birthplace, Ollolai, on September 3, 2019. A memorial was held in Los Angeles on October 6, 2019.

<doc id="145474" wikidata="Q2584276" url="?curid=145474" title="Blitter">
<text>A blitter is a circuit, sometimes as a coprocessor or a logic block on a microprocessor, dedicated to the rapid movement and modification of data within a computer&#x27;s memory. A blitter can copy large quantities of data from one memory area to another relatively quickly, and in parallel with the CPU, while freeing up the CPU&#x27;s more complex capabilities for other operations. A typical use for a blitter is the movement of a bitmap, such as windows and icons in a graphical user interface or images and backgrounds in a 2D video game. The name comes from the bit blit operation of the 1973 Xerox Alto, which stands for bit-block transfer. A blit operation is more than a memory copy, because it can involve data that&#x27;s not byte aligned (hence the &quot;bit&quot; in &quot;bit blit&quot;), handling transparent pixels (pixels which should not overwrite the destination), and various ways of combining the source and destination data.

Blitters have largely been superseded by programmable graphics processing units.

==History==
In computers without hardware accelerated raster graphics, which includes most 1970s and 1980s home computers and IBM PC compatibles through the mid-1990s, the frame buffer is commonly stored in CPU-accessible memory. Drawing is accomplished by updating the frame buffer via software. For fundamental graphics routines, like compositing a smaller image into a larger one (such as for a video game) or drawing a filled rectangle, large amounts of memory need to be manipulated, and many cycles are spent fetching and decoding short loops of load/store instructions. For CPUs without caches, the bus requirement for instructions is as significant as data. To reduce the size of the frame buffer, a single byte may not necessarily correspond to a pixel, but contain 8 single-bit pixels, 4 two-bit pixels, or a pair of 4-bit pixels. Manipulating packed pixels requires extra shifting and masking operations on the CPU.

Blitters were developed to offload repetitive tasks of copying data or filling blocks of memory faster than possible by the CPU. This can be done in parallel with the CPU and also handle special cases which would be significantly slower if coded by hand, such as skipping over pixels marked as transparent or handling data that isn&#x27;t byte-aligned.

===Blitters in computers and video games===
1973: The Xerox Alto, where the term bit blit originated, has a bit block transfer instruction implemented in microcode, making it much faster than the same operation written on the CPU. The microcode was implemented by Dan Ingalls.

1978: The Bally Astrocade home console ships with primitive blitter hardware.

1982: In addition to drawing shape primitives, the NEC μPD7220 video display processor can transfer rectangular bitmaps to display memory via direct memory access and fill rectangular portions of the screen. The design was licensed by Intel and sold as the 82720 graphics display controller.

1982: The &quot;&quot; arcade video game from Williams Electronics includes two blitter chips which allow the game to have up to 80 simultaneously moving objects. Performance was measured at roughly 910 KB/second. The blitter operates on 4-bit (16 color) pixels where color 0 is transparent, allowing for non-rectangular shapes. Williams used the same hardware in other games from the time period, including &quot;Sinistar&quot; and &quot;Joust&quot;.

1984: The MS-DOS compatible Mindset personal computer contains a custom VLSI chip to move rectangular sections of a bitmap. The hardware handles transparency and eight modes for combining the source and destination data. The Mindset was claimed to have graphics up to 50x faster than IBM PC compatibles of the time, but the system was not successful.

1985: One of the coprocessors in the Amiga personal computer is a blitter. The first US patent filing to use the term &quot;blitter&quot; was &quot;Personal computer apparatus for block transfer of bit-mapped image data,&quot; assigned to Commodore-Amiga, Inc. The blitter performs an arbitrary boolean operation on three bit vectors of size 16:
:codice_1

1986: The TMS34010 is a general purpose 32-bit processor with built-in instructions, including codice_2 (Pixel Block Transfer), for manipulating bitmap data. It is optimized for cases that would take extra processing if implemented in software, such as handling transparent pixels, working with non-byte aligned data, and converting between bit depths. codice_2 provides 22 ways of combining the source and destination data. The TMS34010 serves as both CPU and GPU for a number of arcade games starting in 1988 with &quot;Narc&quot; and including &quot;Hard Drivin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Smash TV&quot;, &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, and &quot;NBA Jam&quot;, It was also used in graphics accelerator boards in the 1990s.

1987: The IBM 8514/A display adapter, introduced with the IBM Personal System/2 computers in April 1987, includes bit block transfer hardware.

1987: The Atari Mega ST 2 ships with a blitter chip. Officially called the &quot;Atari ST Bit-Block Transfer Processor&quot;, stylized as BLiTTER, it provides 16 options for merging source and destination data. The blitter is supported on most subsequent ST machines.

1989: The short-lived Atari Transputer Workstation contains blitter hardware as part of its (Mega ST-based) &quot;Blossom&quot; video system.

1989: The Atari Lynx color handheld game system has a custom blitter with scaling and distortion effects.

1993: The Atari Jaguar game console has blitter hardware as part of the custom &quot;Tom&quot; chip.

1996: The VESA Group introduced a standardized way to access features like hardware Bit Block transfers with VBE/accelerator functions (VBE/AF) on IBM PC compatibles.

==Operation==
Typically, a computer program puts information into certain hardware registers describing what memory transfer needs to be completed and the logical operations to perform on the data. The CPU then triggers the blitter to begin operating. The CPU is free for other processing while the blitter is working, though the blit running in parallel uses memory bandwidth.

To copy data with fully transparent pixels—such as sprites—some hardware allows a specific pixel value to be ignored, such as color 0, during the blit. Those pixels are not written to the destination.

Another approach on some systems is to have a second 1 bit per pixel image used as a mask to indicate which pixels to transfer and which to leave untouched. The mask operates like a stencil. The logical operation is:

:codice_4

==Other approaches==
Hardware sprites are small bitmaps which can be positioned independently and are composited together with the background on-the-fly by the video chip. The frame buffer is not modified. The downside of sprites is a limit of moving graphics per scanline, which can range from three (Atari 2600) to eight (Commodore 64 and Atari 8-bit computers) to significantly higher for 16-bit consoles and arcade hardware (the Neo Geo can display 96 sprites per line. The inability to update a permanent bitmap makes them unsuitable for general desktop GUI acceleration.

<doc id="145476" wikidata="Q878737" url="?curid=145476" title="Bit blit">
<text>Bit blit (also written BITBLT, BIT BLT, BitBLT, Bit BLT, Bit Blt etc., which stands for &quot;bit block transfer&quot;) is a data operation commonly used in computer graphics in which several bitmaps are combined into one using a &quot;boolean function&quot;.

The operation involves at least two bitmaps: a &quot;source&quot; (or &quot;foreground&quot;) and a &quot;destination&quot; (or &quot;background&quot;), and possibly a third that is often called the &quot;mask&quot;. The result may be written to a fourth bitmap, though often it replaces the destination. The pixels of each are combined using a program-selectable &quot;raster operation&quot;, a bit-wise boolean formula. The most obvious raster operation overwrites the destination with the source. Others may involve AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations. The Commodore Amiga&#x27;s graphics chipset (and others) could combine three source bitmaps using any of the 256 possible 3-input boolean functions.

Modern graphics software has almost completely replaced bitwise operations with more general mathematical operations used for effects such as alpha compositing. This is because bitwise operations on color displays do not usually produce results that resemble the physical combination of lights or inks. Some software still uses XOR to draw interactive highlight rectangles or region borders; when this is done to color images, the unusual resulting colors are easily seen.

==Origins==
The name derives from the &quot;BitBLT&quot; routine for the Xerox Alto computer, standing for &quot;bit-boundary block transfer&quot;. Dan Ingalls, Larry Tesler, Bob Sproull, and Diana Merry programmed this operation at Xerox PARC in November 1975 for the Smalltalk-72 system. Dan Ingalls later implemented a redesigned version in microcode.

The development of fast methods for various bit blit operations gave impetus to the evolution of computer displays from using character graphics (text mode) to using raster graphics (bitmap) for everything. Machines that rely heavily on the performance of 2D graphics (such as video game consoles) often have special-purpose circuitry called a &quot;blitter&quot;.

== Example of a masked blit implementation ==
A classic use for blitting is to render transparent sprites onto a background. In this example a background image, a sprite, and a 1-bit mask are used. As the mask is 1-bit, there is no possibility for partial transparency via alpha blending.

A loop that examines each bit in the mask and copies the pixel from the sprite only if the mask is set will be much slower than hardware that can apply exactly the same operation to every pixel. Instead a &quot;masked blit&quot; can be implemented with two regular BitBlit operations using the AND and OR raster operations.

The sprite is drawn in various positions over the image to produce this:

=== Technique ===

When preparing the sprite, the colors are very important. The &quot;mask&quot; pixels are 0 (black) wherever the corresponding sprite pixel is to be displayed, and 1 (white) wherever the background needs to be preserved. The &quot;sprite&quot; must be 0 (black) anywhere where it is supposed to be transparent, but note that black can be used in the non-transparent regions.

In the first blit, the &quot;mask&quot; is blitted onto the &quot;background&quot; using the raster operator &quot;AND&quot;. Because any value ANDed with 0 equals 0, and any value ANDed with 1 is unchanged, black areas are created where the actual sprites will appear, while leaving the rest of the background alone.

In the second blit, the &quot;sprite&quot; is blitted onto the newly altered background using the raster operator of &quot;OR&quot;. Because any value ORed with 0 is unchanged, the background is unaffected and the black areas are filled with the actual sprite image.

It is also possible to achieve the same effect using a sprite with a white background and a white-on-black mask. In this case, the mask would be ORed first, and the sprite ANDed next.

==Blitting vs hardware sprites==
Blitting is similar to hardware-sprite drawing, in that both systems reproduce a pattern, typically a square area, at different locations on the screen. Hardware sprites have the advantage of being stored in separate memory, and therefore don&#x27;t disturb the main display memory. This allows them to be moved about the display, covering the &quot;background&quot;, with no effect on it.

Blitting moves the same types of patterns about the screen, but does so by writing into the same memory as the rest of the display. This means that every time a foreground pattern is placed on the screen, any background pixels underneath it are overwritten, or &quot;damaged&quot;. It is up to the software to repair this damage by blitting twice, once to restore the pixels that were changed, and then again to place the foreground pattern in its new location. One way to do it is to store the required patterns in VRAM offscreen and to reserve another area offscreen as a sort of stack to temporarily store the affected display section. Assuming the graphics chip has dedicated VRAM this is useful to lessen the strain on system RAM but also the bandwidth limited ISA expansion slot on older PC systems. 

However, there are several ways to optimize this. If large areas of the screen are taken over by the patterns, it may be more efficient to blit the background to the screen instead of erasing each pattern individually. A variation involves dividing the screen into segments and erasing only the segments where patterns have been drawn on. This technique is known as dirty rectangles.

<text>Tag Image File Format or Tagged Image File Format, commonly known by the abbreviations TIFF or TIF, is an image file format for storing raster graphics images, popular among graphic artists, the publishing industry, and photographers. TIFF is widely supported by scanning, faxing, word processing, optical character recognition, image manipulation, desktop publishing, and page-layout applications. The format was created by the Aldus Corporation for use in desktop publishing. It published the latest version 6.0 in 1992, subsequently updated with an Adobe Systems copyright after the latter acquired Aldus in 1994. Several Aldus or Adobe technical notes have been published with minor extensions to the format, and several specifications have been based on TIFF 6.0, including TIFF/EP (ISO 12234-2), TIFF/IT (ISO 12639),&lt;ref name=&quot;TIFF/IT&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TIFF/IT2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; TIFF-F (RFC 2306) and TIFF-FX (RFC 3949).

==History==
TIFF was created as an attempt to get desktop scanner vendors of the mid-1980s to agree on a common scanned image file format, in place of a multitude of proprietary formats. In the beginning, TIFF was only a binary image format (only two possible values for each pixel), because that was all that desktop scanners could handle. As scanners became more powerful, and as desktop computer disk space became more plentiful, TIFF grew to accommodate grayscale images, then color images. Today, TIFF, along with JPEG and PNG, is a popular format for deep-color images.

The first version of the TIFF specification was published by the Aldus Corporation in the autumn of 1986 after two major earlier draft releases. It can be labeled as Revision 3.0. It was published after a series of meetings with various scanner manufacturers and software developers. In April 1987 Revision 4.0 was released and it contained mostly minor enhancements. In October 1988 Revision 5.0 was released and it added support for palette color images and LZW compression.

TIFF is a complex format, defining many tags of which typically only a few are used in each file. This led to implementations supporting many varying subsets of the format, a situation that gave rise to the joke that TIFF stands for &quot;Thousands of Incompatible File Formats&quot;. This problem was addressed in revision 6.0 of the TIFF specification (June 1992) by introducing a distinction between &quot;Baseline TIFF&quot; (which all implementations were required to support) and &quot;TIFF Extensions&quot; (which are optional). Additional extensions are defined in two supplements to the specification which were published in September 1995 and March 2002 respectively.

== Overview ==
A TIFF file contains one &quot;or several&quot; images, termed &quot;subfiles&quot; in the specification. The basic use case for having multiple subfiles is to encode a multipage telefax in a single file, but it is also allowed to have different subfiles be different variants of the same image, for example scanned at different resolutions. Rather than being a continuous range of bytes in the file, each subfile is a data structure whose top-level entity is called an &quot;image file directory&quot; (IFD). Baseline TIFF readers are only required to make use of the first subfile, but each IFD has a field for linking to a next IFD.

The IFDs are where the &quot;tags&quot; for which TIFF is named are located. Each IFD contains one or several &quot;entries&quot;, each of which is identified by its tag. The tags are arbitrary 16-bit numbers; their symbolic names such as ImageWidth often used in discussions of TIFF data do not appear explicitly in the file itself. Each IFD entry has an associated &quot;value&quot;, which may be decoded based on general rules of the format, but it depends on the tag what that value then &quot;means&quot;. There may within a single IFD be no more than one entry with any particular tag. Some tags are for linking to the actual image data, other tags specify how the image data should be interpreted, and still other tags are used for image metadata.

TIFF images are made up of rectangular grids of pixels. The two axes of this geometry are termed horizontal (or X, or width) and vertical (or Y, or length). Horizontal and vertical resolution need not be equal (since in a telefax they typically would not be equal). A baseline TIFF image divides the vertical range of the image into one or several &quot;strips&quot;, which are encoded (in particular: compressed) separately. Historically this served to facilitate TIFF readers (such as fax machines) with limited capacity to store uncompressed data — one strip would be decoded and then immediately printed — but the present specification motivates it by &quot;increased editing flexibility and efficient I/O buffering&quot;. A TIFF extension provides the alternative of &quot;tiled&quot; images, in which case both the horizontal and the vertical ranges of the image are decomposed into smaller units.

An example of these things, which also serves to give a flavor of how tags are used in the TIFF encoding of images, is that a striped TIFF image would use tags 273 (StripOffsets), 278 (RowsPerStrip), and 279 (StripByteCounts). The StripOffsets point to the blocks of image data, the StripByteCounts say how long each of these blocks are (as stored in the file), and RowsPerStrip says how many rows of pixels there are in a strip; the latter is required even in the case of having just one strip, in which case it merely duplicates the value of tag 257 (ImageLength). A tiled TIFF image instead uses tags 322 (TileWidth), 323 (TileLength), 324 (TileOffsets), and 325 (TileByteCounts). The pixels within each strip or tile appear in row-major order, left to right and top to bottom.

The data for one pixel is made up of one or several &quot;samples&quot;; for example an RGB image would have one Red sample, one Green sample, and one Blue sample per pixel, whereas a greyscale or palette color image only has one sample per pixel. TIFF allows for both additive (e.g. RGB, RGBA) and subtractive (e.g. CMYK) color models. TIFF does not constrain the number of samples per pixel (except that there must be enough samples for the chosen color model), nor does it constrain how many bits are encoded for each sample, but baseline TIFF only requires that readers support a few combinations of color model and bit-depth of images. Support for custom sets of samples is very useful for scientific applications; 3 samples per pixel is at the low end of multispectral imaging, and hyperspectral imaging may require hundreds of samples per pixel. TIFF supports having all samples for a pixel next to each other within a single strip/tile (PlanarConfiguration = 1) but also different samples in different strips/tiles (PlanarConfiguration = 2). The default format for a sample value is as an unsigned integer, but a TIFF extension allows declaring them as alternatively being signed integers or IEEE-754 floats, as well as specify a custom range for valid sample values.

TIFF images may be uncompressed, compressed using a lossless compression scheme, or compressed using a lossy compression scheme. The lossless LZW compression scheme has at times been regarded as the standard compression for TIFF, but this is technically a TIFF extension, and the TIFF6 specification notes the patent situation regarding LZW. Compression schemes vary significantly in at what level they process the data: LZW acts on the stream of bytes encoding a strip or tile (without regard to sample structure, bit depth, or row width), whereas the JPEG compression scheme both transforms the sample structure of pixels (switching to a different color model) and encodes pixels in 8×8 blocks rather than row by row.

Most data in TIFF files are numerical, but the format supports declaring data as rather being textual, if appropriate for a particular tag. Tags that take textual values include Artist, Copyright, DateTime, DocumentName, InkNames, and Model.

===MIME type===
The MIME type &quot;image/tiff&quot; (defined in RFC 3302) without an application parameter is used for Baseline TIFF 6.0 files or to indicate that it is not necessary to identify a specific subset of TIFF or TIFF extensions. The optional &quot;application&quot; parameter (Example: Content-type: image/tiff; application=foo) is defined for image/tiff to identify a particular subset of TIFF and TIFF extensions for the encoded image data, if it is known. According to RFC 3302, specific TIFF subsets or TIFF extensions used in the application parameter must be published as an RFC.

MIME type &quot;image/tiff-fx&quot; (defined in RFC 3949 and RFC 3950) is based on TIFF 6.0 with TIFF Technical Notes TTN1 (Trees) and TTN2 (Replacement TIFF/JPEG specification). It is used for Internet fax compatible with the ITU-T Recommendations for Group 3 black-and-white, grayscale and color fax.

=== Digital preservation ===
Adobe holds the copyright on the TIFF specification (aka TIFF 6.0) along with the two supplements that have been published. These documents can be found on the Adobe TIFF Resources page. The Fax standard in RFC 3949 is based on these TIFF specifications.

TIFF files that strictly use the basic &quot;tag sets&quot; as defined in TIFF 6.0 along with restricting the compression technology to the methods identified in TIFF 6.0 and are adequately tested and verified by multiple sources for all documents being created can be used for storing documents. Commonly seen issues encountered in the content and document management industry associated with the use of TIFF files arise when the structures contain proprietary headers, are not properly documented, or contain &quot;wrappers&quot; or other containers around the TIFF datasets, or include improper compression technologies, or those compression technologies are not properly implemented.

Variants of TIFF can be used within document imaging and content/document management systems using CCITT Group IV 2D compression which supports black-and-white (bitonal, monochrome) images, among other compression technologies that support color. When storage capacity and network bandwidth was a greater issue than commonly seen in today&#x27;s server environments, high-volume storage scanning, documents were scanned in black and white (not in color or in grayscale) to conserve storage capacity.

The inclusion of the SampleFormat tag in TIFF 6.0 allows TIFF files to handle advanced pixel data types, including integer images with more than 8 bits per channel and floating point images. This tag made TIFF 6.0 a viable format for scientific image processing where extended precision is required. An example would be the use of TIFF to store images acquired using scientific CCD cameras that provide up to 16 bits per photosite of intensity resolution. Storing a sequence of images in a single TIFF file is also possible, and is allowed under TIFF 6.0, provided the rules for multi-page images are followed.

== Details ==
TIFF is a flexible, adaptable file format for handling images and data within a single file, by including the header tags (size, definition, image-data arrangement, applied image compression) defining the image&#x27;s geometry. A TIFF file, for example, can be a container holding JPEG (lossy) and PackBits (lossless) compressed images. A TIFF file also can include a vector-based clipping path (outlines, croppings, image frames). The ability to store image data in a lossless format makes a TIFF file a useful image archive, because, unlike standard JPEG files, a TIFF file using lossless compression (or none) may be edited and re-saved without losing image quality. This is not the case when using the TIFF as a container holding compressed JPEG. Other TIFF options are layers and pages.

TIFF offers the option of using LZW compression, a lossless data-compression technique for reducing a file&#x27;s size. Use of this option was limited by patents on the LZW technique until their expiration in 2004.

The TIFF 6.0 specification consists of the following parts:
* Introduction (contains information about TIFF Administration, usage of Private fields and values, etc.)
* Part 1: Baseline TIFF
* Part 2: TIFF Extensions
* Part 3: Appendices

=== Part 1: Baseline TIFF ===
When TIFF was introduced, its extensibility provoked compatibility problems. The flexibility in encoding gave rise to the joke that TIFF stands for &quot;Thousands of Incompatible File Formats&quot;. To avoid these problems, every TIFF reader was required to read &quot;Baseline TIFF&quot;. Among other things, Baseline TIFF does not include layers, or compressed JPEG or LZW images. Baseline TIFF is formally known as &quot;TIFF 6.0, Part 1: Baseline TIFF&quot;.

The following is an incomplete list of required Baseline TIFF features:

==== Multiple subfiles ====
TIFF readers must be prepared for multiple/multi-page images (subfiles) per TIFF file, although they are not required to actually do anything with images after the first one.

There may be more than one Image File Directory (IFD) in a TIFF file. Each IFD defines a subfile. One use of subfiles is to describe related images, such as the pages of a facsimile document. A Baseline TIFF reader is not required to read any IFD beyond the first one.

==== Strips ====
A baseline TIFF image is composed of one or more strips. A strip (or band) is a subsection of the image composed of one or more rows. Each strip may be compressed independently of the entire image, and each begins on a byte boundary. If the image height is not evenly divisible by the number of rows in the strip, the last strip may contain fewer rows. If strip definition tags are omitted, the image is assumed to contain a single strip.

==== Compression ====
Baseline TIFF readers must handle the following three compression schemes:
* Zero compression
* CCITT Group 3 1-Dimensional Modified Huffman RLE
* PackBits compression - a form of run-length encoding

==== Image types ====
Baseline TIFF image types are: bilevel, grayscale, palette-color, and RGB full-color images.

==== Byte order ====
Every TIFF file begins with a two-byte indicator of byte order: &quot;codice_1&quot; for little-endian (a.k.a. &quot;Intel byte ordering&quot;, ) or &quot;codice_2&quot; for big-endian (a.k.a. &quot;Motorola byte ordering&quot;, ) byte ordering. The next two-byte word contains the format version number, which has always been 42 for every version of TIFF (e.g., TIFF v5.0 and TIFF v6.0).
All two-byte words, double words, etc., in the TIFF file are assumed to be in the indicated byte order. The TIFF 6.0 specification states that compliant TIFF readers must support both byte orders (codice_1 and codice_2); writers may use either.

==== Other TIFF fields ====
TIFF readers must be prepared to encounter and ignore private fields not described in the TIFF specification. TIFF readers must not refuse to read a TIFF file if optional fields do not exist.

=== Part 2: TIFF Extensions ===
Many TIFF readers support tags additional to those in Baseline TIFF, but not every reader supports every extension. As a consequence, Baseline TIFF features became the lowest common denominator for TIFF. Baseline TIFF features are extended in TIFF Extensions (defined in the TIFF 6.0 Part 2 specification) but extensions can also be defined in private tags.

The TIFF Extensions are formally known as &quot;TIFF 6.0, Part 2: TIFF Extensions&quot;. Here are some examples of TIFF extensions defined in TIFF 6.0 specification:

====Compression====
* CCITT T.4 bi-level encoding
* CCITT T.6 bi-level encoding
* LZW
* JPEG

====Image types====
* CMYK Images
* YCbCr Images
* HalftoneHints
* Tiled Images
* CIE L*a*b* Images

====Image trees====
A baseline TIFF file can contain a sequence of images (IFD). Typically, all the images are related but represent different data, such as the pages of a document. In order to explicitly support multiple views of the &quot;same&quot; data, the &quot;SubIFD&quot; tag was introduced. This allows the images to be defined along a tree structure. Each image can have a sequence of children, each child being itself an image. The typical usage is to provide thumbnails or several versions of an image in different color spaces.

=====Tiles=====
A TIFF image may also be composed of a number of tiles. All tiles in the same image have the same dimensions and may be compressed independently of the entire image, similar to strips (see above). Tiled images are part of TIFF 6.0, Part 2: TIFF Extensions, so the support for tiled images is not required in Baseline TIFF readers.

====Other extensions====
According to TIFF 6.0 specification (Introduction), all TIFF files using proposed TIFF extensions that are not approved by Adobe as part of Baseline TIFF (typically for specialized uses of TIFF that do not fall within the domain of publishing or general graphics or picture interchange) should be either not called TIFF files or should be marked some way so that they will not be confused with mainstream TIFF files.

==== Private tags ====
Developers can apply for a block of &quot;private tags&quot; to enable them to include their own proprietary information inside a TIFF file without causing problems for file interchange. TIFF readers are required to ignore tags that they do not recognize, and a registered developer&#x27;s private tags are guaranteed not to clash with anyone else&#x27;s tags or with the standard set of tags defined in the specification. Private tags are numbered in the range 32,768 and higher.

Private tags are reserved for information meaningful only for some organization, or for experiments with a new compression scheme within TIFF. Upon request, the TIFF administrator (currently Adobe) will allocate and register one or more private tags for an organization, to avoid possible conflicts with other organizations. Organizations and developers are discouraged from choosing their own tag numbers arbitrarily, because doing so could cause serious compatibility problems. However, if there is little or no chance that TIFF files will escape a private environment, organizations and developers are encouraged to consider using TIFF tags in the &quot;reusable&quot; 65,000–65,535 range. There is no need to contact Adobe when using numbers in this range.

===TIFF Compression Tag===
The TIFF Tag 259 (010316) stores the information about the Compression method. The default value is 1 = no compression.

Most TIFF writers and TIFF readers support only some TIFF compression schemes. Here are some examples of used TIFF compression schemes:
==Related formats==
===BigTIFF===

The TIFF file formats use 32-bit offsets, which limits file size to around 4 GiB. Some implementations even use a signed 32-bit offset, running into issues around 2 GiB. BigTIFF is a TIFF variant file format which uses 64-bit offsets and supports much larger files (up to 18 exabytes in size). The BigTIFF file format specification was implemented in 2007 in development releases of LibTIFF version 4.0, which was finally released as stable in December 2011. Support for BigTIFF file formats by applications is limited.

===Exif===
The Exif specification builds upon TIFF. For uncompressed image data, an Exif file is straight off a TIFF file with some private tags. For JPEG compressed image data, Exif uses the JPEG File Interchange Format but embeds a TIFF file in the APP1 segment of the file. The first IFD (termed 0th in the Exif specification) of that embedded TIFF does not contain image data, and only houses metadata for the primary image. There may however be a thumbnail image in that embedded TIFF, which is provided by the second IFD (termed 1st in the Exif specification). The Exif audio file format does not build upon TIFF.

Exif defines a large number of private tags for image metadata, particularly camera settings and geopositioning data, but most of those do not appear in the ordinary TIFF IFDs. Instead these reside in separate IFDs which are pointed at by private tags in the main IFD.

=== TIFF/IT ===
TIFF/IT is used to send data for print-ready pages that have been designed on high-end prepress systems. The TIFF/IT specification (ISO 12639) describes a multiple-file format, which can describe a single page per file set. TIFF/IT files are not interchangeable with common TIFF files.

The goals in developing TIFF/IT were to carry forward the original IT8 magnetic-tape formats into a medium-independent version. TIFF/IT is based on Adobe TIFF 6.0 specification and both extends TIFF 6, by adding additional tags, and restricts, it by limiting some tags and the values within tags. Not all valid TIFF/IT images are valid TIFF 6.0 images.

TIFF/IT defines image-file formats for encoding color continuous-tone picture images, color line art images, high-resolution continuous-tone images, monochrome continuous-tone images, binary picture images, binary line-art images, screened data, and images of composite final pages.

There is no MIME type defined for TIFF/IT. The MIME type &quot;image/tiff&quot; should not be used for TIFF/IT files, because TIFF/IT does not conform to Baseline TIFF 6.0 and the widely deployed TIFF 6.0 readers cannot read TIFF/IT. The MIME type &quot;image/tiff&quot; (defined in RFC 3302) without an application parameter is used for Baseline TIFF 6.0 files or to indicate that it is not necessary to identify a specific subset of TIFF or TIFF extensions. The application parameter should be used with &quot;image/tiff&quot; to distinguish TIFF extensions or TIFF subsets. According to RFC 3302, specific TIFF subsets or TIFF extensions must be published as an RFC. There is no such RFC for TIFF/IT. There is also no plan by the ISO committee that oversees TIFF/IT standard to register TIFF/IT with either a parameter to image/tiff or as new separate MIME type.

==== TIFF/IT files ====
TIFF/IT consists of a number of different files and it cannot be created or opened by common desktop applications. TIFF/IT-P1 file sets usually consist of the following files:
* Final Page (FP)
* Continuous Tone image (CT)
* Line Work image (LW)
* High resolution Continuous-tone files (HC - optional)
TIFF/IT also defines the following files:
* Monochrome continuous-tone Picture images (MP)
* Binary Picture images (BP)
* Binary Line-art images (BL)
* Screened Data (SD)

Some of these data types are partly compatible with the corresponding definitions in the TIFF 6.0 specification. The Final Page (FP) allows the various files needed to define a complete page to be grouped together: it provides a mechanism for creating a package that includes separate image layers (of types CT, LW, etc.) to be combined to create the final printed image. Its use is recommended but not required. There must be at least one subfile in an FP file, but no more than one of each type. It typically contains a CT subfile and an LW subfile.

The primary color space for this standard is CMYK, but also other color spaces and the use of ICC Profiles are supported.

==== TIFF/IT compression ====
TIFF/IT makes no provision for compression within the file structure itself, but there are no restrictions. (For example, it is allowed to compress the whole file structure in a ZIP archive.)

LW files use a specific compression scheme known as Run-length encoding for LW (Compression tag value is 808016). HC files also use a specific Run-length encoding for HC (Compression tag value is 808116). The TIFF/IT P1 specs do not allow use of compression within the CT file.

The following is a list of defined TIFF/IT compression schemes:

====TIFF/IT P1====

The ISO 12639:1998 introduced TIFF/IT-P1 (Profile 1) - a direct subset of the full TIFF/IT standard (previously defined in ANSI IT8.8–1993). This subset was developed on the ground of the mutual realization by both the standards and the software development communities that an implementation of the full TIFF/IT standard by any one vendor was both unlikely (because of its complexity), and unnecessary (because Profile 1 would cover most applications for digital ad delivery). Almost all TIFF/IT files in digital advertising were distributed as TIFF/IT-P1 file sets in 2001. When people talk about TIFF/IT, they usually mean the P1 standard.

Here are some of the restrictions on TIFF/IT-P1 (compared to TIFF/IT):
* Uses CMYK only (when appropriate)
* It is pixel interleaved (when appropriate)
* Has a single choice of image orientation
* Has a single choice of dot range
* Restricted compression methods

TIFF/IT-P1 is a simplified conformance level of TIFF/IT and it maximizes the compatibility between Color Electronic Prepress Systems (CEPS) and Desk Top Publishing (DTP) worlds. It provides a clean interface for the proprietary CEPS formats such as the Scitex CT/LW format.

====TIFF/IT P2====

Because TIFF/IT P1 had a number of limitations, an extended format was developed. The ISO 12639:2004 introduced a new extended conformance level - TIFF/IT-P2 (Profile 2). TIFF/IT-P2 added a number of functions to TIFF/IT-P1 like:
* CMYK spot colors only (when appropriate)
* Support for the compression of CT and BP data (JPEG and Deflate)
* Support for multiple LW and CT files in a single file
* Support for copydot files through a new file type called SD (Screened Data)
* There was some effort to create a possibility to concatenate FP, LW, and CT files into a single file called the GF (Group Final) file, but this was not defined in a draft version of ISO 12639:2004.

This format was not widely used.

==== Private tags ====
The TIFF/IT specification preserved the TIFF possibility for developers to utilize private tags. The TIFF/IT specification is very precise regarding how these private tags should be treated - they should be parsed, but ignored.

Private tags in the TIFF/IT-P1 specification were originally intended to provide developers with ways to add specific functionality for specific applications. Private tags can be used by developers (e.g., Scitex) to preserve specific printing values or other functionality. Private tags are typically labelled with tag numbers greater than or equal to 32768.

All private tags must be requested from Adobe (the TIFF administrator) and registered.

In 1992, the DDAP (Digital Distribution of Advertising for Publication, later Digital Directions in Applications for Production) developed their requirement statement for digital ad delivery. This was presented to ANSI-accredited CGATS (Committee for Graphic Arts Technology Standards) for development of an accredited file format standard for the delivery of digital ads. CGATS reviewed their alternatives for this purpose and TIFF seemed like the ideal candidate, except for the fact that it could not handle certain required functionalities. CGATS asked Aldus (the TIFF administrator) for a block of their own TIFF private tags in order to implement what eventually became TIFF/IT. For example, the ability to identify the sequence of the colors is handled by tag 34017 - the Color Sequence Tag.

TIFF/IT was created to satisfy the need for a transport-independent method of encoding raster data in the IT8.1,
IT8.2 and IT8.5 standards.

==== Standards ====
TIFF/IT was defined in ANSI IT8.8–1993 standard in 1993 and later revised in the International Standard &quot;ISO 12639:1998 - Prepress digital data exchange – Tag image file format for image technology (TIFF/IT)&quot;. The ISO standard replaces ANSI IT8.8–1993. It specifies a media-independent means for prepress electronic data exchange.

The ISO 12639:2004 (Second edition) standard for TIFF/IT superseded the ISO 12639:1998. It was also later extended in ISO 12639:2004 / Amd. 1:2007 - Use of JBIG2-Amd2 compression in TIFF/IT.

<doc id="145479" wikidata="Q1047541" url="?curid=145479" title="Encapsulated PostScript">
<text>Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) is a Document Structuring Convention (DSC) conforming PostScript document format usable as a graphics file format. The format was developed as early as 1987 by John Warnock and Chuck Geschke, the founders of Adobe, together with Aldus. The basis of early versions of the Adobe Illustrator Artwork file format is formed by EPS together with the DSC Open Structuring Conventions.

In short, EPS files are self-contained, reasonably predictable PostScript documents that describe an image or drawing and can be placed within another PostScript document. An EPS file is essentially a PostScript program, saved as a single file that includes a low-resolution preview &quot;encapsulated&quot; within it, allowing some programs to display a preview on the screen. An EPS file contains a DSC comment describing the rectangle containing the image. Applications can use this information to lay out the page, even if they are unable to directly render the PostScript inside.

== Previews ==
EPS files frequently include a preview picture of the content for on-screen display. The idea is to allow a simple preview of the final output in any application that can draw a bitmap. Without this preview, the applications would have to directly render the PostScript (PS) data inside the EPS, which was beyond the capabilities of most machines that used PostScript.

When EPS was first implemented, the only machines widely using PostScript were Apple Macintoshes. These machines could not directly render the PostScript, which presented Adobe with the dilemma of how to provide a preview image for the designer while also including the PS version for the printer. On the Mac this turned out to be easy to solve, as the Mac file system includes two parts (known as &quot;forks&quot;) that are logically referred to as one file. By placing the PostScript in the data fork and a standard Mac PICT resource in the resource fork, both images could be moved about together invisibly as if they were one file. While a PICT preview often contains a bitmap, it could also contain a vector representation of the whole image, providing very high quality previews.

Neither of these technologies is commonly used on any other operating system, however. When faced with the same problems on Microsoft Windows-based versions of their programs, Adobe chose to instead add a TIFF file encoded into the header section of the PostScript. Sometimes, although more rarely, they used the Windows Metafile (WMF) format instead. WMF has the potential to provide vector previews, similar to PICT on the Mac. Both of these PC format EPS files have a particular disadvantage: because the PostScript data, header, and preview are all in the same file, they will cause printing errors if a program does not understand the format well enough to extract only the PostScript data.

A fourth format known as a &quot;EPSI&quot; includes an ASCII-encoded preview bitmap. This format provides only black-and-white previews. It is mainly used on Unix-like systems. With several different ways of representing the preview, EPSI files have limited portability. An application that is unable to interpret an EPS file&#x27;s preview will typically show an empty box on screen, but it will be able to print the file correctly. The most widely supported kind of preview is a Windows format preview with a TIFF.

== Vulnerability ==
Due to the ability to use embedded scripts, Microsoft removed support for EPS files in Microsoft Office programs in May 2018.

<doc id="145483" wikidata="Q3059278" url="?curid=145483" title="EtherType">
<text>EtherType is a two-octet field in an Ethernet frame. It is used to indicate which protocol is encapsulated in the payload of the frame and is used at the receiving end by the data link layer to determine how the payload is processed. The same field is also used to indicate the size of some Ethernet frames.

EtherType is also used as the basis of 802.1Q VLAN tagging, encapsulating packets from VLANs for transmission multiplexed with other VLAN traffic over an Ethernet trunk.

EtherType was first defined by the Ethernet II framing standard and later adapted for the IEEE 802.3 standard. EtherType values are assigned by the IEEE Registration Authority.

== Overview ==
In modern implementations of Ethernet, the field within the Ethernet frame used to describe the EtherType can also be used to represent the size of the payload of the Ethernet Frame. Historically, depending on the type of Ethernet framing that was in use on an Ethernet segment, both interpretations were simultaneously valid, leading to potential ambiguity. Ethernet II framing considered these octets to represent EtherType while the original IEEE 802.3 framing considered these octets to represent the size of the payload in bytes.

In order to allow Ethernet II and IEEE 802.3 framing to be used on the same Ethernet segment, a unifying standard, IEEE 802.3x-1997, was introduced that required that EtherType values be greater than or equal to 1536. That value was chosen because the maximum length (MTU) of the data field of an Ethernet 802.3 frame is 1500 bytes and 1536 is equivalent to the number 600 in the hexadecimal numeral system. Thus, values of 1500 and below for this field indicate that the field is used as the size of the payload of the Ethernet frame while values of 1536 and above indicate that the field is used to represent an EtherType. The interpretation of values 1501–1535, inclusive, is undefined.

The end of a frame is signaled by a valid frame check sequence followed by loss of carrier or by a special symbol or sequence in the line coding scheme for a particular Ethernet physical layer, so the length of the frame does not always need to be encoded as a value in the Ethernet frame. However, as the minimum payload of an Ethernet frame is 46 bytes, a protocol that uses EtherType must include its own length field if that is necessary for the recipient of the frame to determine the length of short packets (if allowed) for that protocol.

== VLAN tagging==
802.1Q VLAN tagging uses an 0x8100 EtherType value. The payload following includes a 16-bit tag control identifier (TCI) followed by an Ethernet frame beginning with a second (original) EtherType field for consumption by end stations. IEEE 802.1ad extends this tagging with further nested EtherType and TCI pairs.

== Jumbo frames ==
The size of the payload of non-standard jumbo frames, typically ~9000 Bytes long, collides with the range used by EtherType, and cannot be used for indicating the length of such a frame. The proposition to resolve this conflict was to substitute the special EtherType value 0x8870 when a length would otherwise be used. However, the proposition (its use case was bigger packets for IS-IS) was not accepted and it is defunct. The chair of IEEE 802.3 at the time, Geoff Thompson, responded to the draft outlining IEEE 802.3&#x27;s official position and the reasons behind the position. The draft authors also responded to the chair&#x27;s letter, but no subsequent answer from the IEEE 802.3 has been recorded.

While defunct, this draft was implemented and is used in Cisco routers in their IS-IS implementation (for IIH Hello packets padding).

== Use beyond Ethernet ==
With the advent of the IEEE 802 suite of standards, a Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) header combined with an IEEE 802.2 LLC header is used to transmit the EtherType of a payload for IEEE 802 networks other than Ethernet, as well as for non-IEEE networks that use the IEEE 802.2 LLC header, such as FDDI. However, for Ethernet, Ethernet II framing is still used.

== Registration ==

EtherTypes are assigned by the IEEE Registration Authority, which publishes them in list format. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority has a separate list of some EtherType registrations, compiled from several sources, including the IEEE Registration Authority&#x27;s list and some other lists.

<text>OO gauge or OO scale (also, 00 gauge and 00 scale) is the most popular standard gauge model railway standard in the United Kingdom, outside of which it is virtually unknown. OO gauge is one of several 4 mm-scale standards (4 mm to , or 1:76.2), and the only one to be marketed by major manufacturers. The OO track gauge of (same as the 1:87 HO scale) corresponds to prototypical gauge of , rather than standard gauge. However, since the 1960s, other gauges in the same scale have arisen—18.2 mm (EM) and 18.83 mm (Scalefour)—to reflect the desire of some modellers for greater scale accuracy.

==Origin==
Double-0 scale model railways were launched by Bing in 1921 as &quot;The Table Railway&quot;, running on track and scaled at 4 mm-to-the-foot. In 1922, the first models of British prototypes appeared. Initially all locomotives were powered by clockwork, but the first electric power appeared in autumn 1923.
OO describes models with a scale of 4 mm = 1 foot (1:76) running on HO scale 1:87 (3.5 mm = 1 foot) track (16.5 mm/0.650 in). This combination came about as early clockwork mechanisms and electric motors were difficult to fit within HO scale models of British trains, which are smaller than their European and North American counterparts. A quick and cheap solution was to enlarge the scale of the model to 4 mm-to-the-foot but keep the 3.5 mm-to-the-foot gauge track. This also allowed more space to model the external valve gear. The resulting HO track gauge of 16.5 mm represents 4 feet 1.5 inches at 4 mm-to-the-foot scale; this is 7 inches under scale, or approximately 2.33 mm too narrow.

In 1932, the Bing company collapsed, but the Table Railway continued to be manufactured by the new Trix company. Trix decided to use the new HO standard, being approximately half of European 0 gauge (1:43 scale).

In 1938, the Meccano Company launched a new range of OO models under the trade name of Hornby Dublo. The combination of 4 mm scale and 16.5 mm gauge has remained the UK&#x27;s most popular scale and gauge ever since.

In the United States, Lionel Corporation introduced a range of OO models in 1938. Soon other companies followed but it did not prove popular and remained on the market only until 1942, when Lionel train production was shut down due to wartime restrictions to the use of steel. OO gauge was quickly eclipsed by the better-proportioned HO scale. The Lionel range of OO used 19 mm ( inch) track gauge, equating to 57 inches or 4 ft 9 in – very close to the 4 ft 8 in of standard gauge. There is a small following of American OO scale today.

==OO today==
OO remains the most popular scale for railway modelling in Great Britain due to a ready availability of ready-to-run stock and starter sets. Ready-to-run in the UK is dominated by Hornby Railways and Bachmann Branchline. Other sources of ready-to-run rolling stock or locomotives include Dapol, Heljan, Peco, ViTrains, Rapido Trains UK, Accurascale, and previously Lima, Tri-ang Railways, and Mainline Railways. Other scales, with the possible exception of N gauge, lack the variety and affordability of UK ready-to-run products.

== Scaling and accuracy ==
 gauge at 4 mm:1 foot means that the scale gauge represents , narrower than the prototype . This difference is particularly noticeable when looking along the track. As the market for proprietary track is mostly for HO scale, sleeper size and spacing are designed for HO and are therefore underscale.

OO is also used to represent the Irish gauge, where it is a scale too narrow.

Though they run on the same track, OO gauge and HO gauge models of the same prototype do not sit well together since the OO models are larger than the HO equivalent.

These differences have led to the development of the finescale standards of EM gauge and P4 standards. Nevertheless, it is possible to model using OO to standards that fall just short of finescale.

In common with most practical model railways of any scale (and not related to the OO gauge inaccuracy) the following compromises are made: Curves are often sharper than the prototype, and often not transitioned, particularly when using &quot;set-track&quot; systems (radius 1 = 371 mm, 2 = 438 mm, 3 = 505 mm, 4 = 571.5 mm). Overhang from long vehicles means that the normal separation between track centres are overscale to prevent collisions on curves between stock on adjacent lines, at up to 65 mm (for set-track (reduced down to 50 mm for Peco Streamline)). Overscale wheel width and deep wheel flanges are used on typical models (but particularly older models), and these require overscale rail profile and much larger clearances on pointwork than is prototypical. Pointwork is often compressed in length to save space.

== 4 mm finescale standards ==
Many experienced modellers find the OO standard produces a &quot;narrow gauge&quot; appearance when the model is viewed head on. Greater accuracy is possible using either EM gauge or the closer-to-exact scale P4 track.

Whilst flextrack is available for both EM and P4 gauges (from manufacturers such as C&amp;L Finescale, SMP and The P4 Track Company), ready-to-run (RTR) point and crossing (P&amp;C) work is not available, so this trackwork must be constructed by the modeller, although RTR turnouts in EM gauge manufactured by Peco are now available from the EM Gauge Society. Kits for doing this are also available from the aforementioned sources amongst others. Several of these kits are also available to the OO modeller who aims for more realistic track since most RTR track is actually scaled to HO and does not represent any British prototype, and the sleeper spacing is too close for scale. EM gauge has slightly overscale flanges and flangeways on point and crossing work; P4 is closer to scale but the smaller flanges and flangeways on P&amp;C work expose poor track construction.

<text>Tattershall Castle is a castle in Tattershall, Lincolnshire, England. Since 1925 it has been in the care of the National Trust.

==History==

Tattershall Castle has its origins in either a stone castle or a fortified manor house, built by Robert de Tattershall in 1231. This was largely rebuilt in brick, and greatly expanded, by Ralph Cromwell, 3rd Baron Cromwell, Treasurer of England, in the 15th century. Tree ring dating indicates that construction was underway between 1406 and 1431.

Brick castles are less common in England than stone or earth and timber constructions; when brick was chosen as a building material it was often for its aesthetic appeal or because it was fashionable. The trend for using bricks was introduced by Flemish weavers. There was plenty of stone available nearby, but Cromwell chose to use brick. About 700,000 bricks were used to build the castle, which has been described as &quot;the finest piece of medieval brick-work in England&quot;.

Of Lord Cromwell&#x27;s castle, the high Great Tower and moat still remain. It is thought that the castle&#x27;s three state rooms were once splendidly fitted out and the chambers were heated by immense Gothic fireplaces with decorated chimney pieces and tapestries. It has been said that the castle was an early domestic country mansion masquerading as a fortress. Cromwell died in 1456, and the castle was initially inherited by his niece, Joan Bouchier, but it was confiscated by the Crown after her husband&#x27;s demise and remained in royal ownership from king Edward IV to king Henry VIII. Tattershall Castle was recovered in 1560 by Sir Henry Sidney, who sold it to Lord Clinton, later Earl of Lincoln, and it remained with the Earls of Lincoln until 1693. It passed to the Fortesques, but then fell into neglect.

It was put up for sale in 1910. Its greatest treasures, the huge medieval fireplaces, were still intact. When an American bought them they were ripped out and packaged up for shipping. Lord Curzon of Kedleston stepped in at the eleventh hour to buy the castle and was determined to get the fireplaces back. After a nationwide hunt they were found in London and returned. He undertook restorations of the castle between 1911 and 1914. It was gifted to the National Trust, on his death, in 1925 and remains today one of the three most important surviving brick castles of the mid-15th-century in the United Kingdom.

The experience of Tattershall led Lord Curzon to push for heritage protection law in Britain; this was enacted as the Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913.

==Design==
The plan of the castle is roughly rectangular; it is bounded by an inner moat surrounded by an outer moat. The inner enclosure, or Ward, was that of the original 13th-century castle, and the original entrance was on the north side towards the west end.

The Outer Ward, between the outer moat and inner moat, housed the stables. The Middle Ward, originally accessed by a bridge from the Outer Ward, housed a gatehouse and guardhouse. Today, access to the castle is via this Middle Ward. The Inner Moat encompasses the Inner Ward, where the Great Tower and the kitchens (now demolished) were situated.

===The Great Tower===

The tower is about across. There are separate entrances to the basement, to the ground floor (Parlour), and to the spiral staircase leading to the upper floors of the tower. This suggests that the basement and ground floor were intended to provide communal accommodation, while the three great upper rooms were an independent private suite or Solar (room). The design was extremely simple, with four floors, slightly increasing in size at each level by reductions in wall thickness.
The fireplaces indicate that the rooms were not intended to be subdivided, but were kept as one great room at each level. One of the four corner turrets contains the staircase, but the other three provided extra accommodation rooms at each level.

The basement was used to store spices and other kitchen items. It is believed that during the Civil War it was used as a prison.

The ground floor was the Parlour and it was here that local tenants would come to pay their rent.

The first floor of the private suite was the Hall, which would have been used to entertain and wine and dine guests.

The second floor was the Audience Chamber, and only the finest of guests would have been admitted here. A brick vaulted corridor led to a small waiting room, before the great hall of the Audience Chamber, which today houses Flemish tapestries bought by Lord Curzon.

The third floor would have been the Private Chamber, where the Lord would have retired for the night.

Above these are the roof gallery and battlements, which provide good views across the Lincolnshire landscape, as far as Boston to the south, and Lincoln to the north. It is not possible today to access the turrets.

The brick foundations to the south of the great tower, projecting into the moat, mark the site of the 15th-century kitchens.

Today, the old guardhouse (about north-east of the tower) is the gift shop, and the grounds are home to a number of peacocks.

== The castle today ==
The castle is open to the public from 10:30 am every day, with last entry at 3.30 pm. The Parlour is licensed for civil wedding ceremonies for up to 80 guests.

<text>Belton House is a Grade I listed country house in the parish of Belton near Grantham in Lincolnshire, England, built between 1685 and 1687 by Sir John Brownlow, 3rd Baronet. It is surrounded by formal gardens and a series of avenues leading to follies within a larger wooded park. Belton has been described as a compilation of all that is finest of Carolean architecture, said to be the only truly vernacular style of architecture that England had produced since the Tudor period. It is considered to be a complete example of a typical English country house; the claim has even been made that Belton&#x27;s principal façade was the inspiration for the modern British motorway signs which give directions to stately homes.

For about three centuries until 1984, Belton House was the seat of the Brownlow family, which had first acquired land in the area in the late 16th century. Their heirs, the Cust family, were created Baron Brownlow in 1776. Despite his great wealth Sir John Brownlow, 3rd Baronet, chose to build a comparatively modest house rather than one of the grand Baroque palaces being built by others at the time. The contemporary, if provincial, Carolean style was the selected choice of design. Nevertheless, the new house was fitted with the latest innovations, such as sash windows for the principal rooms, and followed the latest thinking on house-planning, in seeking to separate those parts of the building that were for the use of the family from the areas where servants carried out their domestic duties. Successive generations made changes to the interior of the house which reflected their changing social position and tastes, yet the fabric and design of the house changed little.

In August 1914, Belton House and its park were used as the assembly point for the newly-formed 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment in World War I, and in October 1915 it was used as the home depot and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps. During World War II, RAF Belton Park was established in the grounds of the house, as were two RAF Regiment squadrons, by November 1944 1,850 personnel were based at Belton.

The Custs, like many previously wealthy English families, were faced with mounting financial problems. Edward Cust, 7th Baron Brownlow opened the estate to the public. An adventure playground was built in the nearby woods to attract families to the house as a tourist attraction. However, the financial difficulties were too great and in 1984 they donated the house, with most of its contents, to the National Trust. The trust introduced new features and attractions to fund repairs and conservation. Further revenue is raised from the use of the property as a filming location, and from licensing the Marble Hall for civil weddings. It was visited by 340,290 people during 2021.

==History==
The Brownlow family, a dynasty of lawyers, began buying property in Lincolnshire to augment their income in 1598. Among these properties was the manor of Belton, distant from Grantham. Richard Brownlow, who established the family&#x27;s wealth, began negotiations to acquire the manor from Sir Henry Pakenham in 1603 and secured its reversion to him six years later. The Pakenhams hosted King James I in the manor for a night in 1617. This occasion financially ruined the Pakenhams and led to the resignation of their interest in the property to Brownlow in exchange for a lifelong annuity. Brownlow neither much stayed at nor made much change to the Belton manor, preferring to reside at other properties. When he died, Brownlow was succeeded by his son Sir John Brownlow, 1st Baronet, who himself died childless in 1679. John Brownlow had, however, become attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard, who married in 1676 when both were aged 16.

After inheriting the estates of their great-uncle, Alice and John Brownlow sought to enter London high society. To that end, they bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury and decided to build a new country house at Belton to flaunt their wealth. In 1684 they acquired labourers and materials for the house, hiring brickmakers, bricklayers, and stonemasons, and carefully demolished the old manor, which stood near the present orangery, to recycle its components. The cornerstone of what became Belton House was laid on 23 March 1685 and its exterior was largely completed by the latter half of the following year. The interiors of the house were completed in 1687.

===Private residence===
The Brownlows moved into Belton House in November 1688. On 29 October 1695, they hosted William III, who was reported to have enjoyed his stay so much that he was too hung over to eat any of the food provided on his visit to Lincoln the following day. Two years later, in July 1697, Sir John Brownlow II committed suicide at a relative&#x27;s residence in Dorset. Ownership of Belton House passed to his brother, William, who was content to permit Alice to remain in occupation until her death in 1721, and she spent that time arranging advantageous marriages for her five daughters. One of those marriages was between her youngest daughter, Eleanor, and Sir John Brownlow III, William&#x27;s son. John III, made Viscount Tyrconnel in 1718, inherited Belton House on Alice&#x27;s death and refurnished the house.

Sir John Brownlow III also died childless in 1754, and like Sir John Brownlow I focused his energies on a nephew, also named John, son of his sister Anne and Sir Richard Cust. The Cust family had family ties to the slave trade. They moved into a house in Grantham and received the Viscount Tyrconnel&#x27;s patronage. Upon John III&#x27;s death, Anne inherited Belton House and lived in it until 1766, when she gave it to John Cust—elected MP for Grantham in 1743 and then Speaker of the House of Commons from 1761 to 1770—to provide him a residence befitting his political station. Cust died in 1770, because of the &quot;unusual fatigues&quot; of his office, according to his monument at Belton, and Belton passed to his son, Brownlow Cust, who was created Baron Brownlow in 1776.

Brownlow Cust made sweeping changes to Belton House. First, from 1770 to 1771, he arranged for repairs to its interiors and then hired architects James Wyatt and John Langworth to modernise the house over the rest of the century. In 1807, Brownlow Cust died and was succeeded by his son, John, created Earl Brownlow in 1815. The Earl also made changes to Belton House and its grounds, employing Jeffry Wyatville, James Wyatt&#x27;s nephew, from 1809 to 1820 and Anthony Salvin in the 1830s. On his death in 1853 he was succeeded by a grandson, who himself died in 1867 leaving Belton House, and the manor and estate of Ashridge in Hertfordshire, inherited in 1849 by the 1st Earl&#x27;s oldest son, John Egerton, Viscount Alford, to another grandson, Adelbert Brownlow-Cust, 3rd Earl Brownlow.

Although the 3rd Earl preferred to live at Ashridge or at Carlton House Terrace in London, he spent the rest of the 19th century reverting Belton House to its 17th-century appearance. The house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation, but that century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. In January 1921, the 3rd Earl died childless. As a consequence, his title became extinct and his estates were inherited by Adelbert Salusbury Cockayne-Cust, 5th Baron Brownlow. The diminishing value of the family&#x27;s land and death duties for the 3rd Earl obliged the 5th Baron to sell Ashridge and its art collections. Further death duties were incurred on Adelbert&#x27;s death in 1927, who passed the house to his son, Peregrine. The 6th Lord Brownlow was involved in the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII as his Lord-in-waiting. Edward VIII, who became the Duke of Windsor after the abdication, visited Belton in the 1930s with his mistress Wallis Simpson, whom Brownlow tried in vain to persuade to stay at Belton House in the course of the crisis.

===Belton House and the World Wars===
Belton Park held temporary encampments for the training of British Army units for many years before the start of World War I, but had never held any permanent facilities. At the beginning of the war, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered the house and grounds of Belton and Ashridge to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted and in August 1914, Belton House and its park were used as the assembly point for the newly-formed 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. A small town was erected on the Belton estate for the soldiers by April 1915 and included such amenities as a YMCA, a cinema and its own railway line. In October 1915, the home depot and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. By 1922, the camp had closed and all the military buildings had been demolished. An archaeological dig at the site was undertaken by the &quot;Time Team&quot; in 2012.

The years following World War I were severely testing for the owners of many great estates. Both indoor and outdoor staff had previously been plentiful, essential, and cheap, but were now in short supply. Millions of men had left private service to join the army, and very few returned. Female domestic staff had been called up for war service in factories, and now realised there was an easier and better paid existence outside the great country houses.

Belton again saw war service during World War II. In March 1942 the depot for the RAF Regiment was established at the park as RAF Belton Park. It was housed in Nissen huts. Alongside the depot, Belton Park also held the RAF Regiment Officer Cadet Training Unit (OCTU) which provided officers with the professional skills necessary for service in the regiment. Two RAF Regiment squadrons were formed at Belton Park in 1942; 2788 Field Squadron in March and 2774 Field Squadron in May. By November 1944 1,850 personnel were based at Belton. When the war ended in the following year the RAF Regiment was reorganised and Belton Park became No. 1 Depot, continuing on as the OCTU. The RAF Regiment left Belton in August 1946, closing its depots and sub-depots in Lincolnshire.

===National Trust===
Following the wars, many thousands of country houses of great architectural value were demolished, or had whole wings razed to the ground. In 1955 alone one house was demolished every five days. In this respect Belton was fortunate to survive at all, as in addition to the family&#x27;s problems, the house deteriorated to such an extent that in 1961 the 6th Baron employed the architect Francis Johnson to oversee a restoration program lasting three years. The roof was replaced, much of the panelling taken down and repaired, and new cornices installed. Attempts were also made to curtail serious infestations of dry rot. In the previous decade, Belton was designated a Grade I listed building, the highest possible grade reserved for structures of exceptional interest. Gervase Jackson-Stops, the architectural historian suggests, in his 1990 study &quot;The Country House in Perspective&quot;, that the main façade of the house was the inspiration for the British motorway signs () which indicate the proximity of stately homes.

The seventh Baron attempted to retain the house and estate by opening to the public. An adventure playground was built in the nearby woods to attract families to the house as a tourist attraction. However, the financial difficulties were too great and in January 1984 he transferred ownership of the house, garden, and some of the contents to the National Trust, a charitable body experienced in the management of historic properties. An auction of the contents was held at Belton House by Christie&#x27;s over three days 30 April – 2 May 1984, comprising 1,022 lots. The National Trust then purchased of parkland and much of the remaining contents at a cost of £8 million (worth about £ today) with a grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund.

A priority for the Trust on their taking over Belton was the establishment of a restaurant, to augment the estate&#x27;s income, and encourage people to spend more time at Belton and travel greater distances to visit. Though the house, its contents, and outbuildings were in an adequate state of repair at the time of the gift, they have since become part of an ongoing programme of conservation and restoration. At the same time, the National Trust has introduced new features and attractions such as a silver exhibition that displays a collection of silver amassed by the Brownlow family, dating from 1698. Further revenue is raised from the use of the property as a filming location, and from licensing the Marble Hall for civil weddings. The house featured in the 1988 TV adaptation of the 1987 children&#x27;s novel &quot;Moondial&quot; and also as &quot;Rosings Park&quot; in the BBC&#x27;s 1995 television version of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. It was visited by 340,290 people during 2021.

==Architecture==

Nikolaus Pevsner described Belton as &quot;a house of fulfillment rather than innovation&quot; while Nigel Nicolson called it &quot;a summing-up of all that is best in the only truly vernacular [architectural] style in England since the late Tudors.&quot; Belton is a scaled-down version of Clarendon House, designed and constructed by Roger Pratt and demolished in 1683, which was considered by the architectural historian Sir John Summerson to be &quot;the most influential house of its time among those who aimed at the grand manner&quot;. Following that example, Belton House was constructed with two storeys set over a semi-basement and with service wings, creating an H-shaped building two rooms deep and with pediments above the central façade on both sides. Belton House&#x27;s exterior was constructed from 1,750,000 bricks, faced with Ancaster stone from a quarry at Heydour in Lincolnshire and a lighter ashlar from Ketton for the quoining. Neoclassical embellishments were added onto the façade by James Wyatt in 1777–78.

The second floor has a complementary , with windows matching those on the first floor below. The very latest innovation, sash windows, was used on both floors. The semi-basement and attic storey used the more old-fashioned mullioned and transomed windows, indicating the lower status of the occupants of these floors. It was clearly emphasised from without that the two main floors of the house were for state and family use, and the staff and service areas were confined to the semi-basement and attic floors. This concept of keeping staff and domestic matters out of sight (when not required) was relatively new and had first been employed by Pratt in the design of Coleshill House in Berkshire. The contemporary social commentator Roger North lauded back stairs, of which Belton has two examples (5 and 14 on plan), as one of the most important inventions of his day.

It is not known for certain who designed Belton House, but the architect now generally considered responsible for its design is William Winde. The house had previously been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, and it has also been suggested, based on the house&#x27;s similarity to Clarendon House, that Belton could have been designed by any competent draughtsman. The assumption that Winde was the architect is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. That Winde was the architect is further evidenced by his connections to several of the artisans who worked at Belton. In a letter dated 1690, Winde recommends a plasterer to another of his patrons based on his work at Coombe Abbey, Hampstead Marshall, and Belton, and he had previously worked with the carpenter Edward Willcox, who supplied the cupola.

John and Alice Brownlow assembled one of the finest teams of craftsmen available at the time to work on the project. This was headed by the master mason William Stanton who oversaw the project and undertook work independently, for example the service wing. His second in command, John Thompson, had worked with Sir Christopher Wren on several of the latter&#x27;s London churches, while the chief joiner John Sturges had worked at Chatsworth House under William Talman. The wrought-ironworker John Warren worked under Stanton at Denham Place, Buckinghamshire, and the fine wrought iron gates and overthrow at Belton may be his. Thus, so competent were the builders of Belton that Winde may have done little more than provide the original plans and drawings, leaving the interpretation to the on-site craftsmen. This theory is further demonstrated by the external appearance of the adjoining stable block. More provincial, and less masterful in proportion, it is known to have been entirely the work of Stanton.

===Interiors===
The plan of the rooms at Belton was outdated for a grand house of its time. Following the Stuart Restoration of 1660 and the influx of European ideas, it had become popular for large houses to follow the continental fashion of a suite of state rooms consisting of a withdrawing room, dressing room, and bedroom proceeding from either side of a central saloon or hall. These rooms were permanently reserved for use by a high ranking guest, such as a visiting monarch. While Belton does have a saloon at its centre, enfilades of state rooms of lessening grandeur do not flank it. This may have been due to the Brownlows&#x27; status as gentry, albeit wealthy, rather than aristocracy. When William III stayed at Belton House, he occupied the &quot;Best bedchamber&quot;, a large room with an adjoining closet, directly above the saloon, that led directly from the second floor Great Dining Chamber.

This design followed the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms scattered over the two main floors. The layout used followed Roger Pratt&#x27;s theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate. As a consequence of this philosophy, the family occupied the rooms on the first and second floors of the west and east wings, with the state rooms in the centre. The great staircase, designed to be grand and imposing, rose to the east side of the house, and formed part of the guest&#x27;s state route from the Hall and Saloon on the first floor to the dining room and bedroom on the second.

The main entrance hall, reception and family bedrooms were placed on the ground and first floors above a low semi-basement containing service rooms. The two major entrances to the mansion in the centre of both the north and south facades were accessed by external staircases, originally a single flared flight on the north side and a double staircase on the south, each of which have since been replaced by single broad flights of steps.

The principal room is the large Marble Hall (1) at the centre of the south front; this hall is the beginning of a grand procession of rooms, and corresponds to the former Great Parlour or Saloon (9) on the north front. The Marble Hall is flanked by the former Little Parlour (11, now the Tapestry Room) and the Great Staircase (2), while the Saloon is flanked by two withdrawing rooms (8, 10). The bedrooms are arranged in individual suites on both floors of the two wings (3, etc.) that flank the state centre of the house. The main staircase, set to one side of the Marble Hall, is one of the few things at Belton which is asymmetrically placed. It has a robust plaster-work ceiling incorporating the Brownlow crest by the London plasterer Edward Goudge, &quot;now looked on as ye best master in England in his profession,&quot; William Winde reported in 1690.

Bodily and spiritual needs were balanced symmetrically within the mansion: the kitchen (16) and the chapel (7) were both large two-storied halls, rising from the semi-basement to the first floor. This design not only provided a great and lofty space, but also allowed the servants to worship in the chapel without leaving the service floor, while their employers would worship from a private gallery, complete with fireplace, overlooking the chapel on the first floor. The chapel has a notable ceiling undertaken by Goodge, and an elaborate reredos.

One of the most Carolean features of the house is the balustrade and cupola surmounting the roof, another element introduced to English architecture by Roger Pratt. The cupola at Belton does not light a lofty domed hall, as is often the case in Europe, but houses a staircase which gives access to a large viewing platform on top of a lead roof, concealed from the ground by the balustrade which tops the more conventional and visible hipped roof. From this vantage point, the owners of Belton could admire the perfect symmetry of their avenues and formal gardens spreading from the house. This feature of the house was removed by the architect James Wyatt when he modernised the house in the 18th century. It was restored to its original form in the 1870s by the 3rd Earl Brownlow.

Some of Belton&#x27;s many rooms have been altered over the last 300 years both in use and design. The Marble Hall (1), the first of the large reception rooms, serves as an entrance hall from the south entrance, and takes its name from a chequer board patterned floor of black and white marble tiles. By the time of Belton&#x27;s conception, the great hall was no longer a place for the household to eat, but intended as a grand entrance to the house. The hall was originally hung with 28 portraits of Kings, Queens, and Emperors, from William the Conqueror to William III, intended to give the house an air of dynastic importance. The less numerous and far newer Brownlow family portraits were originally hung in the Great Dining Room immediately above. The room is fully panelled, and parts of the panelling contain lime wood embellishments attributed to Grinling Gibbons. In the early 19th century, this room, and some others, were re-modelled by Jeffry Wyatville, who in addition to graining and painting the panelling to imitate oak installed new doors.

The Saloon (9), opens from the Marble Hall. This large panelled room is on an axis to the avenues of the formal north gardens. Originally known as the Great Parlour, this has always been the chief reception room of the house. It retains its original marble fireplace and has an ornate plaster ceiling which is a Victorian copy of the original ceiling by Goudge. The centrepiece of the room is a large Aubusson carpet made in 1839 for the 1st Earl Brownlow.

Either side of the Saloon are two smaller drawing rooms (8, 10), which would originally have served as private withdrawing rooms from the more public activities which would have taken place in the Marble Hall and Saloon. One of these rooms, now called the Tyrconnel Room (10), was transformed into the state bedroom during the occupancy of Lord Tyrconnel in an attempt to create a more fashionable suite of Baroque state rooms on the first floor. After his death in 1754, it became a Billiard Room, until the 3rd Earl Brownlow had it refurnished more than a century later. Unusually, the floor is painted with the family arms and crest. The date of the floor is not known for certain but the early nineteenth century has been suggested.

The final large reception room on the first floor is the Hondecoeter Room (16), so named because of the three huge oil paintings by Melchior d&#x27;Hondecoeter (1636–1695), depicting scenes of birds in courtyards, which are fitted into the neo-Carolean panelling. The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from the upper part of the earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories. The West staircase (14) was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family.

Either side of the Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which contains a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The placing of the Great Staircase to the east of the Marble Hall is unusual, in that houses of this period usually put the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as a processional route between the three main reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed. Originally a parlour, in 1778 James Wyatt transformed it into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling; in 1876, its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. The Custs&#x27; passion for book collecting saw the original library on the ground floor, formerly a schoolroom, become too small for their needs and Wyatt created a new one in the early 1800s. This was itself replaced when the Great Dining Room was converted. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.

Leading from the Library is the Queen&#x27;s Room, the former &quot;Best Bed Chamber&quot;. This panelled room was redecorated in 1841 for the visit of Queen Adelaide, widow of William IV, when its former function as a state bedroom was resurrected. It contains the great canopied Rococo-style bed in which the Queen slept, complete with the royal monogram &quot;AR&quot; (&quot;Adelaide Regina&quot;) embroidered on the bedhead. Other rooms on the second floor are mostly bedrooms, which include the Chinese Room (directly above the Tyrconnel Room) with its original hand-painted 18th-century Chinese wallpaper, the Yellow Room (directly above the Blue Room), and the Windsor Bedroom (directly above the School Room), so-called following its use by Edward VIII during the 1936 abdication crisis. Today, Belton has a permanent exhibition devoted to that event. Another royal visitor, the future Charles III, also used the room frequently while a cadet at nearby RAF Cranwell.

==Gardens and park==
In 1690, Sir John Brownlow was granted permission to enclose an area of to transform into a park, with a grant to keep deer. There is evidence to suggest that some of this area had been a park since at least 1580. The park was laid out with avenues, including the still surviving Eastern Avenue which led east from the house. Brownlow also had a large pond or lake dug and planted 21,400 ash trees, 9,500 oak trees, and 614 fruit trees. It is thought that William Winde may have advised on the layout of the gardens. Closer to the house were a series of more formal gardens, including canal ponds bordered by plantations containing symmetrical walks resembling the &quot;rond-points&quot; (circular clearings in a garden from which straight paths radiate) introduced by the landscape gardener André Le Nôtre. By the end of the eighteenth century, these formal parterres had been removed and the canal ponds filled in. Lord Tyrconnel was responsible for many of the architectural features which survive in the park and garden. Between 1742 and 1751, a series of follies, including a Gothic ruin, a cascade, and a prospect or belvedere known as the Bellmount Tower, were constructed for him. When built the tower had two small wings flanking each side, since removed.

The 1st Earl Brownlow had Jeffry Wyatville turn his attention from the house to the park and Wyatville created the Italian Garden, embellished with the Orangery and, following its re-siting, the Lion Exedra. In 1838 Brownlow commissioned Anthony Salvin to undertake improvements to the estate in 1838. Salvin&#x27;s additions included a public house, estate cottages, a hermitage and the boathouse. The gardens and park at Belton are listed at Grade I on Historic England&#x27;s Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

The owners of Belton are buried in the village of Belton, in the parish church of St Peter and St Paul. The church stands close to the house. The Brownlow tombs are collectively one of the most complete sets of family memorials in England—continuous generation to generation for almost 350 years.

<text>Copenhagen County () is a former county (&quot;amt&quot;) on the island of Zealand (&quot;Sjælland&quot;) in eastern Denmark. It covered the municipalities in the metropolitan Copenhagen area, with the exception of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg. Effective January 1, 2007, the county was abolished and merged into Region Hovedstaden (i.e. &quot;Copenhagen Capital Region&quot;).

The county was seated in Glostrup (from 1 January 1993; between 1952 and 1992 the county administration was located on Blegdamsvej in Copenhagen Municipality, which was surrounded by, but not part of the county).

<doc id="145498" wikidata="Q838823" url="?curid=145498" title="Dragør Municipality">
<text>Dragør Kommune () is a municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) in Region Hovedstaden on the southern coast of the island of Amager just east of Zealand (&quot;Sjælland&quot;) in eastern Denmark. The municipality covers an area of 18.41 km2 (2013), and has a population of 14,569 (1. January 2024). Its mayor is Kenneth Gøtterup, a member of the agrarian liberal Venstre (Denmark).

==1970 Danish Municipal Reform==
Not until four years after the 1970 Danish Municipal Reform on 1 April 1974 two new municipalities were formed in Copenhagen County, namely Dragør Municipality, formed by the merger of Dragør (an independent parish from 1 April 1954) and Store Magleby parishes and Høje-Taastrup Municipality, which from that date also included Sengeløse parish (which - as an already existing parish - was also made an independent municipality from 1 April 1970 until 31 March 1974; but it was considered too small to remain as an independent municipality). The inhabitants would have preferred to remain as independent municipalities. Store Magleby, which was larger in area than Dragør, had a large number of subdivisions (Danish (singular): parcel;udstykning) with owner-occupied homes built on the boundary with Dragør (as far away from the noise as possible from planes landing at Copenhagen Airport, and taking restrictions in building regulations (inside city (built-up area) limits versus outside city limits) into consideration) before the merger.
Because the voters of Store Magleby and Sengeløse were almost exclusively owner-occupiers, who voted center-rightwing, whereas Høje-Taastrup Municipality and Dragør Municipality to a large extent consisted of tenants who rented their apartments and who voted center-leftwing, there were heated debates and reluctance among the voters of Store Magleby and Sengeløse about joining the new municipalities. This was because the center-rightwing voters would be in a minority at elections for their local councils.

==Parishes==
Dragør parish is surrounded by Store Magleby parish to the north, south, and west and the strait of Øresund to the east, and Dragør parish thus does not border the neighboring Tårnby municipality. Dragør parish has an area of only 156 hectares (1.56 square km;0.6 sq mi), 8.6% of Dragør municipality&#x27;s area, as opposed to Store Magleby parish&#x27;s 1602 hectares, the latter accounting for more than 88% of Dragør municipality&#x27;s area. A part of Copenhagen Airport lies in Dragør municipality. With 4,144 people (1 January 1970:4,309), 29.77% of the population, recorded as living there on 1 January 2013, Dragør parish has a population density of 2,656 persons per square km (6,880/sq mi), Store Magleby parish with 9,737 people (1970:5,499), 69.96% of the population, has a density of 607.8 persons per square km (1,574.2/sq mi). On 1 January 2020 12,309 people (2010:11,573) lived in the built-up area of Dragør (includes St. Magleby), 1,739 (2010:1,713) in Søvang, 408 people (2010:237) were living in rural areas (areas with below 200 people), and thirty-eight persons (2010:41) were recorded as not having a fixed address. On 1 January 1970 9,808 people lived in the two parishes, and on 1 January 2010 the municipality had a population of 13,564 people.

==Overview==
The main town is Dragør. The seat of the town hall is on Kirkevej 7 in Store Magleby, which easily can house such a large building.

Its only neighboring municipality is Tårnby to the north. To the east and south is the Øresund, the strait that separates Zealand and Amager from Sweden. To the southwest is Køge Bay (Køge Bugt).

<doc id="145500" wikidata="Q21006" url="?curid=145500" title="Glostrup Municipality">
<text>Glostrup Municipality () is a suburban municipality (Danish &quot;kommune&quot;) and town in Region Hovedstaden on the island of Zealand (&quot;Sjælland&quot;) approx. 10 km west of Copenhagen in eastern Denmark. The municipality covers an area of 13.31 km2, and has a total population of 23,655 (2024). Its Zip code (&quot;Postnummer&quot;) is 2600. Its mayor as of 2022 is Kasper Damsgaard, a member of the Social Democrats (&quot;Socialdemokratiet&quot;) political party. The municipality was established in 1841 following the municipal reforms of the 1840s, ranking as a parish municipality (sognekommune) until 1950 when suburbanisation of Copenhagen inhabited the municipality and the status was changed to town municipality (købstadskommune). From 1947 to 1960 the population in the municipality doubled due to the expanding suburbs of Copenhagen, reaching the municipality in the post-war period. Glostrup was designated as a new suburb along the western Tåstrup-finger of the Copenhagen Finger Plan of 1947.

The main town and the site of its municipal council is the town of Glostrup, home to three quarters of the population. Other towns in the municipality are Hvissinge and Ejby. Until 1974 the town of Avedøre also belonged to this municipality. Being an exclave, it was merged into the neighbouring Hvidovre Municipality.

Neighboring municipalities are Rødovre to the east, Herlev and Ballerup to the north, Albertslund to the west, and Brøndby to the south.

Glostrup was not merged with other municipalities on 1 January 2007, as the result of nationwide &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007).

The church of Glostrup originates from the 12th century.


==Politics==

===Municipal council===
Glostrup&#x27;s municipal council consists of 19 members, elected every four years.

Below are the municipal councils elected since the Municipal Reform of 2007.

==Sights==
===Town Hall===
After a period of administration in a mansion, Glostrup municipality decided to build a new town hall in 1953. After a competition Arne Jacobsen was chosen as architect. The new town hall was inaugurated in 1959.

==Economy==

The municipality has twice as many employed within its borders compared with its own workforce, relying on both traditional industry, commerce and public institutions.

The largest employer in the municipality is Glostrup Hospital with 2,500 employees. Vestforbrænding in Ejby is Denmark&#x27;s largest incineration plant. Major companies based in the municipality include Pandora, Kopenhagen Fur. International companies, whose Danish subsidiaries are based out of Glostrup, include Grontmij and Motorola Solutions.

==Housing==
Most of the municipality&#x27;s housing stock is built between 1950 and 1975. 42 percent of its dwellings are owned by public housing corporations, primarily Glostrup Boligselskab formed by later mayor Valdemar Hansen in 1943. As a result of the influence of the housing corporation, more than half the housing stock is between 60 and 99 square meters.

As a result of the rising population in the Copenhagen area, Glostrup Municipality adopted a strategy in 2011 aiming on building 2000 new dwellings within the next four years. The dwellings are primarily detached houses and terraced houses planned in former industrial areas.

==Parks and open spaces==

The largest greenspace in Glostrup Municipality is Vestskoven (&quot;The West Forest&quot;) that straddles the border with Albertslund where most of its 13 square kilometer are located. The West Rampart follows the eastern boundary of the municipality. Ehby Bog is located in the northeastern corner, on the border with Ballerup.

==Population==

The table show the population in Glostrup Municipality since 1890. Note the drop in population following the transfer of Avedøre to Hvidovre Municipality in 1974.

<doc id="145501" wikidata="Q484018" url="?curid=145501" title="Gladsaxe Municipality">
<text>Gladsaxe Municipality () is a municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) near Copenhagen in Region Hovedstaden on the island of Zealand (&quot;Sjælland&quot;) in eastern Denmark. The municipality covers an area of , and has a total population of 70,600 (2024). Its mayor is Trine Græse, a member of the Social Democrats (&quot;Socialdemokraterne&quot;) political party.

The site of its municipal council is the town of Buddinge. Other towns in the municipality are Gladsaxe, Bagsværd, Mørkhøj and Søborg —but town limits are not distinguishable because the towns have grown together in an urban sprawl. 
Mørkhøj, Værebro in Bagsværd and Høje-Gladsaxe are larger housing projects and home to many immigrants and being typical for many concrete highrise suburbs in Copenhagen. &quot;Picture of Gladsaxe Heights&quot;:

At Gladsaxe, there is a guyed TV mast, which was built in 1955. It was the first TV transmission site in Denmark.

Since 2014, Gladsaxe has been home to Copenhagen gem and mineral show, the largest gem and mineral show in Scandinavia. The show is an annual two-day event that attracts exhibitors from all around the world and an audience of thousands from Denmark and Sweden.

Gladsaxe municipality was not merged with other municipalities by 1 January 2007 as the result of nationwide &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipal Reform&quot; of 2007).


==Economy==
Gladsaxe municipality is home to many company headquarters, including those of Novo Nordisk, Novozymes and Scandinavian Tobacco Group and MT Højgaard.

== History ==

According to &quot;Gladsaxe-bogen I&quot; (which focuses on then Gladsaxe-Herlev municipality up until 1909) by C.L.B. Cramer, humans first settled in Gladsaxe around 10.000 years ago.

In 1670 the parishes of Gladsaxe and Herlev became &quot;rider districts&quot;, and every farm had to house a rider/soldier or pay 48 rigsdales yearly. Cramer described &quot;these years as probably some of the most uneasiest years in the parishes long history&quot;. In the 1720s the king built a school for riders in Gladsaxe, and his sister, Sophie Hedevig, built a school in Bagsværd. These were the first schools in Gladsaxe. In 1750, Gladsaxe Præstegaard burns down, along with some farms, with many people losing their lives.

In 1945, Søborg School was used to accommodate 500 German refugees, meaning students at that school instead were educated at Marielyst School. This caused the school hours to be reduced from 50 to 40 minutes, with half the students meeting from 8 to 13 o&#x27;clock and the other half from 13 to 18 o&#x27;clock. In November of that year the refugees could move in at a badminton hall by Gladsaxev Street due to renovations providing room division and heating.

During the 1960s and up until the 2000s, the headquarters of Denmarks Radio, the national broadcaster of Denmark, were located in Gladsaxe.

In 1977–78, a 19-year-old student from Gladsaxe known as &quot;Bombemanden&quot; (The bomb man) was known for placing pipe bombs in public areas in Copenhagen, such as phoneboxes, hurting four although killing no one.

In 1980, a library, Gladsaxe Hovedbibliotek, opened right by the town hall square, becoming the head library of Gladsaxe.

In 1994, a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant opened by the Buddinge Center.

==Parks and open spaces==
Park and green spaces in Gladsaxe Municipality include Aldershvile Slotspark, Bagsværd Fort Folkepark, Bagsværd Sø, Bagsværd Søpark, Gladsaxe Fort 
Gyngemosen og Høje Gladsaxe Park, Kagsåparken, Nybro Åmose, Radiomarken and Smør- og Fedtmosen.

Almost every year, if not every year, there is a day called &quot;Gladsaxe Day&quot; (Gladsaxedagen in Danish), where people in Gladsaxe come together and celebrate.

<doc id="145503" wikidata="Q499400" url="?curid=145503" title="Høje-Taastrup Municipality">
<text>Høje-Taastrup Municipality () is a municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) in the Capital Region on the island of Zealand (&quot;Sjælland&quot;) in eastern Denmark. The municipality covers an area of , and has a total population of 57,540 (1. January 2024). It was formed by the 1970 Danish Municipal Reform, and its 1974 adjustment, by merging the parish municipalities of Høje Taastrup, Sengeløse, the Fløng part of Hvedstrup-Fløng and the Reerslev part of Reerslev-Vindinge. Since 1 January 2006 the mayor of the municipality has been Michael Ziegler, a member of the Conservative People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Det Konservative Folkeparti&quot;) political party.

== Geography ==

The main town is the town of Taastrup. Other towns in the municipality include Høje Taastrup (without hyphenation), Hedehusene, Fløng, Sengeløse, Vridsløsemagle and Reerslev.

=== Locations ===

===Neighbours===
Neighboring municipalities are Albertslund and Vallensbæk to the east, Egedal to the north, Roskilde to the west, and Greve and Ishøj to the south. The Holbæk Motorway and the West Forest (&quot;Vestskoven&quot;) help define the municipality&#x27;s eastern perimeter.

==Roads==
The Holbæk Motorway bisects the municipality east-to-west, and is a major roadway connecting Copenhagen through Roskilde to Holbæk; it extends all the way to the tip of &quot;Sjællands Odde&quot;, a peninsula sticking out into the Kattegat where a ferry connects to Denmark&#x27;s mainland (the Jutland peninsula) at the town of Ebeltoft. Additionally Motorring 4 splits off from the Holbæk Motorway at the municipality&#x27;s eastern border leading to the various motorways servicing the northern parts of Zealand. The municipality&#x27;s good position in the traffic network has led to the development of Høje-Taastrup Transportation Center, which includes Carlsberg Brewery&#x27;s huge bottle depot.
The West Forest is located where the three municipalities of Høje-Taastrup, Albertslund, and Ledøje-Smørum border on one another. It is part of a system of green areas surrounding the Copenhagen metropolitan area. It offers an extensive system of hiking and bike trails through grass and marsh areas. It connects to other parts of the greenway system, allowing one to seamlessly make a tour around the metropolitan area.

Another throughway in this municipality is historic Roskilde Way (&quot;Roskildevej&quot;), which runs from Copenhagen to Roskilde. The first major road connecting these two cities was built in 1642 by King Christian IV. It was called The King&#x27;s Road (&quot;Kongevejen&quot;), and was replaced in the 18th century by the current roadway. At Hedehusene, one of the towns in the municipality, the road changes name to Copenhagen Way (&quot;Københansvej&quot;), i.e. the road leading from Roskilde to Copenhagen. The Holbæk Motorway runs into, and has replaced part of the old Roskilde Way.

Road signs indicating that one is leaving the Copenhagen metropolitan area are mounted within the municipality, where the suburban residential area gives way to the countryside, and the more agricultural side of the municipality.

Høje-Taastrup municipality was not merged with other municipalities on 1 January 2007 as the result of nationwide &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipal Reform&quot; of 2007).

==The three railway station towns==

The towns of Høje Taastrup, Taastrup, and Hedehusene are railway station towns in the Greater Copenhagen Authority (&quot;Hovedstadens Udviklingsråd (HUR)&quot;). The station at Høje Taastrup is one of the largest in Denmark and offers excellent local (Copenhagen-area), regional (including Roskilde, Holbæk and Kalundborg), and national and even international train connections (for example, to Hamburg, Germany).

===Høje Taastrup===

The town of Høje Taastrup is a new development, centered on the train station. Behind the town hall lies the old village of Høje Taastrup, with its typical country church, picturesque thatch-roofed buildings, and a village pond complete with duck houses. It is a reminder of the area&#x27;s agricultural past. The farmland that used to lie in the vicinity of the old village has been pretty much developed as of 2005.

Located at the south end of the railroad station complex is another area landmark— the 26.3 meter tall sculpture &quot;Thor&#x27;s Tower&quot; (&quot;Torstårnet&quot;), the tallest sculpture in the Nordic countries. It was made by Bjørn Nørgaard, and was inaugurated on 4 December 1986. There are several unique buildings in the same area, including the train station itself with its distinctive three arches. The three arches have become a symbol of the municipality, and have given rise to the moniker &quot;The City of Arches&quot; (Danish: &quot;Buernes By&quot;, which in a play on words sounds remarkably similar to the phrase &quot;Byernes By&quot; or &quot;The City of Cities&quot;).

The city has a sizeable number of immigrants, mostly from Vietnam and Arab countries.

The town is home to City 2 shopping centre, Denmark&#x27;s second largest shopping centre or mall.

===Taastrup===

The town of Taastrup is a railway town adjacent to Copenhagen suburbia. It lies to the east of Høje Taastrup, and its central street and shopping is around Taastrup hovedgade, formerly called Køgevej. Some of the shops are cafés, fastfood parlors, barbers, and jewelry stores. 
The housing project of Tåstrupgård is located in Taastrup.
===Hedehusene===

Hedehusene lies to the west of Høje Taastrup, on the stretch of railway connecting Copenhagen-Høje Taastrup-Roskilde. The town got its name with the building of the King&#x27;s Road leading to Roskilde. King Christian IV wanted a house built for an official who would keep watch over entry gates on the road. This became the first house () on the heath (Danish: &quot;hede&quot;) or Danish prairie. Thus the town became Hedehusene (lit. &quot;The houses on the heath&quot;)

Today the town has grown physically into neighboring Kallerup, Fløng, and Baldersbrønde. The most important commercial area is Roskilde Street (&quot;Roskildevej&quot;). Rockwool International, immediately west of the town, is the largest employer.

Hedeland, close by, is a unique nature area created at the site of a former gravel excavation area. It also features a 4,000 seat amphitheatre.

One of Denmark&#x27;s oldest runestones, the Kallerup Stone (&quot;Kallerupstenen&quot;) from ca. 800-825 is erected at Ansgarkirken.

There are between 1000 and 1500 immigrants, the vast majority coming from Turkey (Sivas and Konya). And there are small groups from Pakistan, Bosnia Herzegovina, Iran and Iraq.

==Politics==

===Municipal council===
Høje-Taastrup&#x27;s municipal council consists of 21 members, elected every four years.

Below are the municipal councils elected since the Municipal Reform of 2007.

==Historic attractions==
* The Kroppedal museum in Vridsløsemagle is dedicated to the work of the Danish astronomer, Ole Rømer (1644–1710), who built his observatory here. The observatory operated until about 1716 when the remaining instruments were moved to the &quot;Rundetårn&quot; (lit. the &quot;Round Tower&quot;) in Copenhagen. There is a large collection of ancient and more recent astronomical instruments on display at the museum.

<text>Hvidovre Municipality () is a municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) in the Capital Region near Copenhagen on the island of Zealand (Sjælland) in eastern Denmark. The municipality covers an area of 22 km2, and has a total population of 53,760 (1 January 2024). Its mayor is Anders Wolf Andresen, a member of the Green Left (&quot;Socialistisk Folkeparti&quot;) political party.

The main town and the site of its municipal council is the town of Hvidovre. Other towns in the municipality are Avedøre and Friheden.

Neighboring municipalities are Copenhagen to the east, Rødovre to the north, and Brøndby to the west. Part of its eastern border are the waters of &quot;Kalveboderne&quot;, and to the south is Køge Bay (&quot;Køge Bugt&quot;). The southernmost section of the municipality, known as &quot;Avedøre Holme&quot;, juts out into Køge Bay and forms part of the entryway into &quot;Kalveboderne&quot;, the waters of which separate the island of Zealand from neighboring Amager. &quot;Avedøre Holme&quot; houses two harbours.

==History==
The parish of Hvidovre originally covered the villages of Hvidovre, Valby, and Vigerslev. The civil parish of Hvidovre (&#x27;Hvidovre Sognedistrikt&#x27; or &#x27;Hvidovre Sognekommune&#x27;) was formed in 1803. In 1841, it was merged with Frederiksberg under the name &quot;Hvidovre–Frederiksberg Sognekommune&quot; (&quot;civil parish of Hvidovre–Frederiksberg&quot;) but the two were again split in 1858 and Valby and Vigerslev were transferred to Copenhagen in 1901.

Hvidovre Municipality was established with the 1970 Danish Municipal Reform, covering the parishes of Hvidovre, Risbjerg Parish, Strandmark. Avedøre was transferred from Glostrup to Hvidovre in 1974.

Hvidovre municipality was not merged with other municipalities on 1 January 2007 as part of nationwide &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipality Reform&quot; of 2007).

==Parks and green spaces==
Vestvolden follows the western border of Hvidovre Municipality. Avedøre Airfield from 1917 is Denmark&#x27;s oldest preserved airfield. Strandengen (&quot;The Beach Meadow&quot;) is grazed by cattle and sheep in the summer time. Other green spaces include Kystagerparken, Lodsparken, Mågeparken and Rebæk Søpark.

==The town of Hvidovre==
The town is a suburb to Copenhagen, located ca. 10 km. southwest of central Copenhagen. It got its name from the fact that a white church could be seen in Hvidovre— &quot;hvid&quot; means &quot;white&quot; in Danish. This same naming principle also applies to neighboring Rødovre municipality where a red church could be seen— &quot;rød&quot; means &quot;red&quot; in Danish.

The city is well known for its football team, Hvidovre IF, where famous Danish football players such as Peter Schmeichel, Kenneth Brylle, and Michael Manniche have played. Stephan Andersen with a past in Charlton, has played for the club too. It is also the birthplace of young Liverpool defender Daniel Agger and Thomas Kahlenberg.

Film production camp Filmbyen (founded by Lars von Trier and Peter Aalbæk Jensen&#x27;s company Zentropa) is located in Hvidovre.

==Politics==

===Municipal council===
Hvidovre&#x27;s municipal council consists of 21 members, elected every four years.

Below are the municipal councils elected since the Municipal Reform of 2007.

==Trivia==
The longest office building in Denmark, Copenhagen Business Park, is located in the municipality at the address Stamholmen 143–161. As one of the largest office buildings in Denmark it consists of 67,000 square meters (slightly over 721,000 sq feet) rented space. It dates from 1982 and was built by Bøje Nielsen.

<text>Lyngby-Taarbæk Municipality (occasionally spelled Lyngby-Tårbæk, ) is a municipality () in the Capital Region of Denmark near Copenhagen on the eastern coast of the island of Zealand (). It is part of the Greater Copenhagen area. The municipality borders Rudersdal Municipality to the north, Furesø Municipality to the west and Gladsaxe and Gentofte Municipality to the south. It borders the Øresund to the east.

The municipality covers an area of 39 km2, and has a population of 58,538 (2024). Its mayor is Sofia Osmani, a member of the Conservative People&#x27;s Party. The main town and the site of its municipal council is the town of Kongens Lyngby. 

Lyngby-Taarbæk Municipality was not merged with any other municipality in the municipal reform of 2007.

==History==
In the Middle Ages, when Denmark was divided into syssels, Lyngby-Taarbæk was part of Østersyssel. It later became a part of Copenhagen Fief, which was changed to Copenhagen County in 1661. Although Copenhagen County changed many times over the years, Lyngby-Taarbæk always remained within the borders. When the counties were disestablished in 2007, Lyngby-Taarbæk came under the new Capital Region of Denmark.

Since 1842, and until the 1970 Danish Municipal Reform, Lyngby-Taarbæk was a parish municipality. It became a regular municipality with the 1970 reform, and its borders have remained unchanged since. Lyngby-Taarbæk wasn&#x27;t merged with any other municipality in the 2007 municipal reform.

==Neighbourhoods==
Nearly the entirety of Lyngby-Taarbæk Municipality is part of the Greater Copenhagen area and so there are no towns or villages in the municipality. Instead there are named neighbourhoods. On the list below are all the neighbourhoods with counted populations (numbers as of 2018).

===Kongens Lyngby===

Kongens Lyngby (or simply Lyngby) is located in the southern part of the municipality. The neighbourhoods of Fuglevad, Lundtofte and Fortunen borders Kongens Lyngby to the north. Also bordering Kongens Lyngby are Bagsværd to the west and Buddinge to the south, both located in Gladsaxe Municipality. Also to the south are Vangede and to the east is Jægersborg, both located in Gentofte Municipality. Lyngby Lake is located north of the neighbourhood. The neighbourhood primarily consists of residential buildings, though in the north are numerous facilities and shops, including the mall Lyngby Storcenter. Also located in this area is the neighbourhood&#x27;s train station and city hall, as well as Lyngby Church.

Bondebyen is a former village, now a part of Kongens Lyngby. Many of the old buildings of the village are preserved and are protected.

===Taarbæk===

Taarbæk is a small town or neighbourhood located in the eastern part of the municipality. It borders the Øresund to the east and Jægersborg Dyrehave to the west. Klampenborg is located to the south. Although Taarbæk is technically connected to the Greater Copenhagen Area, and thus a neighbourhood of Copenhagen, it is in the outskirts of the Greater Copenhagen Area and is occasionally referred to as its own town. Taarbæk is a former fishing village, with many old fishing houses preserved. The neighbourhood is, however, dominated by high-end luxury villas. Taarbæk Church and Taarbæk Harbour are both located centrally in the neighbourhood.

There are 19 gates to the park, all of them painted a characteristic red. The current design of the gates date back to the 1700s. The park is home to many old oaks, the oldest being around 850 years old and known as &quot;Skovfogedegen&quot; (literally &quot;forest ranger oak&quot;), named such because it is located next to the forest ranger house &quot;Klampehus&quot;. The oak is hollow, and has throughout history been used for many things, including church ceremonies and as a shed for peat. Another oak is named Christian V&#x27;s Oak, named such because Christian V suffered his fatal hunting injury nearby, when he was kicked by a wounded deer. Another old oak is named &quot;Ulvedalsegen&quot; and is around 600—700 years old. The park is also home to hawthorn, most of it naturally occurring. In the park is a mass grave from the Black Death victims from the 1600s and 1700s. These graves have been planted with hawthorn.

Jægersborg Dyrehave is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, listed among the par force hunting landscape in North Zealand. The park was originally established as hunting grounds, for hunts with hounds. The paths of the park reflects this, with a star-shaped path system, that would allow the hunters a better view of the hunting dogs.

Unlike Tivoli, admission is free in Dyrehavsbakken. It opened in 1583 and is the world&#x27;s oldest operating amusement park. The origins of the park are said to come from a young girl named Kirsten Piil, who in 1583 found a natural spring in Jægersborg Dyrehave. This spring attracted people from Copenhagen and eventually gathered large crowds, which attracted entertainers, causing the foundation of the amusement park.
*Frilandsmuseet is an open-air museum located in Sorgenfri. It was founded in 1897, but moved to Sorgenfri already in 1901 where founder Bernhard Olsen bought 12 acres of land. It portrayed Danish folklore and stories in authentic surroundings, which it still does today. The museum&#x27;s collection consists of around 50,000 items.

*Lottenborg is an inn located in Sorgenfri. The building originates from the 1700s, where the town&#x27;s gatekeeper (Danish: &quot;vangemanden&quot;) lived, which gave the house the nickname &#x27;the Gatekeeper&#x27;s House&#x27; (Danish: &quot;Vangehuset&quot;). The gatekeeper worked on the royal Sorgenfri Castle, and when Princess Charlotte was born in 1789 and the house was renamed to Lottenborg in her honour. Lottenberg eventually became a popular inn, and worked as inn and restaurant for many years. After the death of the owner in 1993, the house was willed to Lyngby-Taarbæk Municipality. It was put on sale in 2010 and sold in 2011.

Another house previously stood at location of the hunting lodge, with Christian V constructing a lodge in 1694. It was torn down in 1734 to build the current lodge. Carpenter Johan Jeremias Reusse built a construction in 1736, allowing the dining room table to be lowered down into the kitchen below. The construction was removed at the end of the 1700s.

<text>Tårnby Municipality (, ) is a &quot;kommune&quot; bordering Copenhagen Municipality on the island of Amager just east of Zealand in eastern Denmark. The municipality includes the islands of Saltholm (16 km2;2 inhabitants 1 January 2020) and Peberholm (1.3 km2), and covers an area of 64.95 km2 of which 48.9 on Amager. It has a population of 43,915 (1. January 2024). Its mayor is Allan S. Andersen, a member of the Social Democrats (&quot;Socialdemokraterne&quot;) political party.

==Overview==

The municipality is primarily an amalgamation of the formerly independent towns of Tårnby and Kastrup, as well as the earlier villages of Ullerup and Tømmerup. The municipal council is located in the Kastrup section of the municipality. Tårnby municipality was not merged with other municipalities on 1 January 2007 as part of nationwide &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipal Reform&quot; of 2007).

Tårnby is divided into three main built up districts: Kastrup, Tårnby, and Vestamager. Kastrup in the north-east is marked by higher density apartments and harbour facilities; Tårnby, west of Kastrup, is known for its older houses, row houses, and some apartments; Vestamager, to the west of the airport, is known for its smaller houses and gardens. Most of the community&#x27;s infrastructure is fairly evenly spread throughout the municipality.

Neighbouring municipalities are Copenhagen to the north and Dragør to the south. These three municipalities cover the entirety of Amager island. To the east is the Øresund (the Sound), the strait which separates Zealand from Sweden. To the west is Køge Bay (&quot;Køge Bugt&quot;).

The E20 Amager Motorway (&quot;Amagermotorvejen&quot;) / Øresund Motorway (&quot;Øresundsmotorvejen&quot;) runs through Tårnby, where in the east it crosses over the Øresund and over the island of Peberholm to Sweden as the Øresund Bridge, and to the west it crosses over Køge Bay to Avedøre Holme in Hvidovre municipality as the 241-meter long Kalvebod Bridge (&quot;Kalvebodbroen&quot;).

Most of Copenhagen Airport lies in the municipality. In fact, the airport takes up about 19% of the municipality&#x27;s area. The airport has had a strong impact on the area, as the national significance of the international airport has sometimes taken precedence over local wishes. However, the airport is also a major employer and benefit for the local economy.

Demographically, Tårnby is slightly older than most of Copenhagen. This trend is expected to become more pronounced in the coming years. Income is slightly less than the average of the approximately 20 municipalities closest to the municipality of Copenhagen.

Politically the municipality has been very stable. From the 1930s until the early 21st century there were only 4 different mayors, all social democrats. The town council has always a majority of social democrats. The municipality has the 5th. lowest tax rate in Denmark. However, the service level is still relatively high.

The first mention of Tårnby in the historical record was in 1135.

Much of the community was still quite rural until the mid 20th century when expansion of the airport, construction of new highways and streets, and a population boom in Copenhagen encouraged the construction of apartments and row housing.

== Economy==
Scandinavian Airlines System SAS Cargo and SAS Denmark have their offices in Kastrup. Transavia Denmark also has its head office in Kastrup.

When SAS Commuter operated its head office was in Kastrup. When Danair operated, its head office was also in Kastrup.

==Politics==

===Municipal council===
Tårnby&#x27;s municipal council consists of 19 members, elected every four years.

<text>Vallensbæk Municipality () is a municipality (Danish: &quot;kommune&quot;) in the Capital Region of Denmark on Zealand. It is part of the Greater Copenhagen area and consist primarily of the suburb of Vallensbæk. It is one of the smallest municipalities in Denmark in terms of area. Vallensbæk Municipality borders the municipalities of Ishøj, Høje-Taastrup, Albertslund and Brøndby. It borders Køge Bay, and the Køge Bay Beach Park (Danish: &quot;Køge Bugt Strandpark&quot;) along the coast. The suburb of Vallensbæk consists of two sections, not directly connected to each other: &quot;Vallensbæk Nordmark&quot; in the north and &quot;Vallensbæk Strand&quot; in the south. The two parts of the town are commonly referred to together as Vallensbæk. The only other settlement in the municipality is the village of &quot;Vallensbæk Landsby&quot;.

The municipality&#x27;s mayor has been Henrik Rasmussen, a member of the Conservative People&#x27;s Party, since 2010. The Conservative People&#x27;s Party has held the position as mayor since the municipality&#x27;s creation in 1970.

Vallensbæk Municipality was not merged with any other municipality in the municipal reform of 2007.

==History==
Vallensbæk is known from at least 1184 under the name &quot;Wolensbech&quot;, possibly translating to &#x27;narrow land area&#x27; or &#x27;the field with the brook&#x27;. In the Middle Ages, when Denmark was divided into syssels, Vallensbæk was part of Østersyssel. It later became a part of Copenhagen Fief, which was changed to Copenhagen County in 1661. Although Copenhagen County changed many times over the years, Vallensbæk always remained within the borders. When the counties were disestablished in 2007, Vallensbæk came under the new Capital Region of Denmark.

Since 1842, and until the 1970 Danish Municipal Reform, Vallensbæk was a parish municipality. It became a regular municipality with the 1970 reform, and its borders have remained unchanged since. Vallensbæk wasn&#x27;t merged with any other municipality in the 2007 municipal reform.

<doc id="145512" wikidata="Q178851" url="?curid=145512" title="Værløse Municipality">
<text>Værløse was a municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) consisting of only &quot;one&quot; parish also named Værløse in the former Copenhagen County on the island of Zealand (&quot;Sjælland&quot;) in eastern Denmark. The municipality covered an area of 34 km2, and in 2005 had a total population of 18,649. Its last mayor was Jesper Bach, a member of the Venstre (Liberal Party) political party.
He was the first mayor of the newly formed Furesø municipality. The community is connected by a road and a motorway and commuter railway to Farum to the north via an isthmus at Fiskebæk between Lake Farum sø and Lake Furesø. The road and motorway run through a small forest on the western shore of Lake Furesø and is almost out of sight and hearing distance from nearby homes in Værløse, but north of the isthmus they run through the town of Farum, separating it in a western and eastern part.

The main town and the site of its municipal council was the town of Værløse. Other towns in the former municipality are Hareskovby, Kirke Værløse, and Jonstrup.

Neighboring municipalities were Farum to the north, Stenløse to the west, Ballerup and Herlev to the south, and Gladsaxe, Lyngby-Taarbæk and Søllerød to the east, albeit the last of these is separated physically from the municipality by the waters of Lake &quot;Furesø&quot;.

On January 1, 2007, Værløse municipality ceased to exist, as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipal Reform&quot; of 2007). It merged with Farum municipality to form the new Furesø municipality, of which Lake Furesø is the namesake. This created a municipality with an area of 57 km2 and a total population of 37,311 (2005). The new municipality belongs to Region Hovedstaden (&quot;Copenhagen Capital Region&quot;).

<text>Chysauster Ancient Village (, meaning &quot;Sylvester&#x27;s house&quot;) is a late Iron Age and Romano-British village of courtyard houses in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom, which is currently in the care of English Heritage. The village included eight to ten houses, each with its own internal courtyard. To the south east is the remains of a fogou, an underground structure of uncertain function.


==Location==
Chysauster lies in southwest Cornwall in the Penwith District. It is located about 5 km north of Penzance at 175 m above sea level. The site is open from March/April to early November, and it is in the care of English Heritage, who charge an admission fee. The iron-age hill fort of Castle An Dinas is just over 1 km to the east. Another similar Iron Age settlement is Carn Euny about 10 km to the southwest and comparisons can be made with the contemporary Atlantic Castro culture.

==Settlement==
Chysauster village is believed to have been inhabited from about 100 BC until the 3rd century AD; it was primarily agricultural and unfortified and probably occupied by members of the Dumnonii tribe. The village consists of the remains of around 10 courtyard houses, each around 30 metres in diameter. Eight of the houses form two distinct rows, and each house had an open central courtyard surrounded by a number of thatched rooms. The houses have a similar layout. The buildings are oriented on an east-west axis, with the entrance facing east. The walls survive to heights of up to 3 metres. A field system in the vicinity attests to the site&#x27;s farming connections.

Chysauster has been excavated several times, including a dig by the antiquarian William Copeland Borlase in 1873. Reconstruction work has been carried out on several occasions.

==Fogou==
To the south of the settlement is an underground passage of a type known locally as fogou (from the permanently lenited form of &quot;mogow&quot;, Cornish for &quot;cave&quot;). Fogous can be found in other places in the UK and Ireland, and are known more generally as souterrains; their purpose is unclear. The fogou at Chysauster was originally recorded as running well over 16 metres in length but was blocked up in the late 20th century for safety reasons. It was recorded around 1847 by Henry Crozier who described it as a &quot;voe or sepulchral chamber&quot;.

<text>Free France () was a resistance government
claiming to be the legitimate government of France following the dissolution of the Third Republic during World War II. Led by General , Free France was established as a government-in-exile in London in June 1940 after the Fall of France to Nazi Germany. It joined the Allied nations in fighting Axis forces with the Free French Forces (), supported the resistance in Nazi-occupied France, known as the French Forces of the Interior, and gained strategic footholds in several French colonies in Africa.

Following the defeat of the Third Republic by Nazi Germany, Marshal Philippe Pétain led efforts to negotiate an armistice and established a German puppet state known as Vichy France. Opposed to the idea of an armistice, de Gaulle fled to Britain and from there broadcast the Appeal of 18 June () exhorting the French people to resist the Nazis and join the Free French Forces. On 27 October 1940, the Empire Defense Council ()—later the French National Committee ( or CNF)—formed to govern French territories in central Africa, Asia, and Oceania that had heeded the 18 June call.

Initially, with the exception of French possessions in the Pacific, India, and Equatorial Africa, all the territories of the French colonial empire rejected &#x27;s appeal and reaffirmed their loyalty to Marshall Pétain and the Vichy government. It was only progressively, often with the decisive military intervention of the Allies, that Free France took over more Vichy possessions, securing the majority of colonies by November 1942.

The Free French fought both Axis and Vichy troops and served in almost every major campaign, from North Africa to Indochina. The Free French Navy operated as an auxiliary force to the Royal Navy and, in the North Atlantic, to the Royal Canadian Navy. Free French units also served in the Royal Air Force, Soviet Air Force, and British SAS, before larger commands were established directly under the control of the government-in-exile. On 13 July 1942, &quot;Free France&quot; was officially renamed Fighting France () to mark the struggle against the Axis both externally and within occupied France.

Exile officially ended after the reconquest of North Africa, when the Free French government relocated from London to Algiers. From there, the French Committee of National Liberation (, CFLN) was formed as the provisional government of all French, uniting the disparate forces that opposed the Axis and their collaborators. On 1 August 1943, Free French Forces united with the Army of Africa () to form the French Liberation Army (&quot;Armée française de la Libération,&quot; AFL). By June 1944, the AFL numbered more than 500,000, and the CFLN was succeeded by the Provisional Government of the French Republic (, GPRF), which was established in anticipation of the liberation of France. The AFL participated in the Normandy landings and the invasion of southern France, ultimately leading the liberation of Paris in August 1944, which ushered in the provisional government on French soil. 

The AFL took part in the Allied advance through France and subsequent invasion of Germany, and by end of the war totaled over 1.3 million troops—the fourth-largest Allied army in Europe. The provisional government ruled France until the establishment of the Fourth Republic in October 1946, having preempted the country&#x27;s occupation by Allied forces and secured its status as a major power.

==Definition==
Historically, an individual became &quot;Free French&quot; by enlisting in the military units organised by the CFN or by employment by the civilian arm of the Committee. On 1 August 1943 after the merger of CFN and representatives of the former Vichy regime in North Africa to form the CFLN earlier in June, the FFF and the Army of Africa (constituting a major part of the Vichy regular forces allowed by the 1940 armistice) were merged to form the French Liberation Army, , and all subsequent enlistments were in this combined force.

In many sources, Free French describes any French individual or unit that fought against Axis forces after the June 1940 armistice. Postwar, to settle disputes over the Free French heritage, the French government issued an official definition of the term. Under this &quot;ministerial instruction of July 1953&quot; (), only those who served with the Allies after the Franco-German armistice in 1940 and before 1 August 1943 may correctly be called &quot;Free French&quot;.

==History==

===Prelude===
On 10 May 1940, Nazi Germany invaded France and the Low Countries, rapidly defeating the Dutch and Belgians, while armoured units attacking through the Ardennes cut off the Franco-British strike force in Belgium. By the end of May, the British and French northern armies were trapped in a series of pockets, including Dunkirk, Calais, Boulogne, Saint-Valery-en-Caux and Lille. The Dunkirk evacuation was only made possible by the resistance of these troops, particularly the French army divisions at Lille.

From 27 May to 4 June, over 200,000 members of the British Expeditionary Force and 140,000 French troops were evacuated from Dunkirk. Neither side viewed this as the end of the battle; French evacuees were quickly returned to France and many fought in the June battles. After being evacuated from Dunkirk, Alan Brooke landed in Cherbourg on 2 June to reform the BEF, along with the 1st Canadian Division, the only remaining fully equipped formation in Britain. Contrary to what is often assumed, French morale was higher in June than May and they easily repulsed an attack in the south by Fascist Italy. A defensive line was re-established along the Somme but much of the armour was lost in Northern France; they were also crippled by shortages of aircraft, the vast majority incurred when airfields were over-run, rather than air combat.

On 1 June, Charles was promoted to brigadier general; on 5 June, Prime Minister Paul Reynaud appointed him Under Secretary of State for Defence, a junior post in the French cabinet. was known for his willingness to challenge accepted ideas; in 1912, he asked to be posted to Pétain&#x27;s regiment, whose maxim &#x27;Firepower kills&#x27; was then in stark contrast to the prevailing orthodoxy of Attaque à outrance. He was also a long-time advocate of the modern armoured warfare ideas applied by the Wehrmacht, and commanded the 4th Armoured Division at the Battle of Montcornet. However, he was not personally popular; significantly, none of his immediate military subordinates joined him in 1940.

The new French commander Maxime Weygand was 73 years old and like Pétain, an Anglophobe who viewed Dunkirk as another example of Britain&#x27;s unreliability as an ally; de Gaulle later recounted he &#x27;gave up hope&#x27; when the Germans renewed their attack on 8 June and demanded an immediate Armistice. was one of a small group of government ministers who favoured continued resistance and Reynaud sent him to London in order to negotiate the proposed union between France and Britain. When this plan collapsed, he resigned on 16 June and Pétain became President of the Council. flew to Bordeaux on the 17th but returned to London the same day when he realised Pétain had already agreed to an armistice with the Axis Powers.

===De Gaulle rallies the Free French===


On 18 June 1940, General spoke to the French people via BBC radio, urging French soldiers, sailors and airmen to join in the fight against the Nazis:
:&quot;France is not alone! She is not alone! She has a great empire behind her! Together with the British Empire, she can form a bloc that controls the seas and continue the struggle. She may, like England, draw upon the limitless industrial resources of the United States&quot;.

Some members of the British Cabinet had reservations about &#x27;s speech, fearing that such a broadcast could provoke the Pétain government into handing the French fleet over to the Nazis, but British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, despite his own concerns, agreed to the broadcast.

In France, &#x27;s &quot;Appeal of 18 June&quot; () was not widely heard that day but, together with his BBC broadcasts in subsequent days and his later communications, came to be widely remembered throughout France and its colonial empire as the voice of national honour and freedom.

===Armistice===
On 19 June, again broadcast to the French nation saying that in France, &quot;all forms of authority had disappeared&quot; and since its government had &quot;fallen under the bondage of the enemy and all our institutions have ceased to function&quot;, that it was &quot;the clear duty&quot; of all French servicemen to fight on.

This would form the essential legal basis of &#x27;s government in exile, that the armistice soon to be signed with the Nazis was not merely dishonourable but illegal, and that in signing it, the French government would itself be committing treason. On the other hand, if Vichy was the legal French government as some such as Julian T. Jackson have argued, and his followers were revolutionaries, unlike the Dutch, Belgian, and other governments in exile in London. A third option might be that neither considered that a fully free, legitimate, sovereign, and independent successor state to the Third Republic existed following the Armistice, as both Free France and Vichy France refrained from making that implicit claim by studiously avoiding using the word &quot;republic&quot; when referring to themselves. In Vichy&#x27;s case, underlying reasons were compounded by ideals of a stamping out France&#x27;s republican heritage.

On 22 June 1940, Marshal Pétain signed an armistice with Germany, followed by a similar one with Italy on 24 June; both of these came into force on 25 June. After a parliamentary vote on 10 July, Pétain became the leader of the newly established authoritarian regime known as Vichy France, the town of Vichy being the seat of government. was tried &quot;in absentia&quot; in Vichy France and sentenced to death for treason. He, on the other hand, regarded himself as the last remaining member of the legitimate Reynaud government and considered Pétain&#x27;s assumption of power to be an unconstitutional coup d&#x27;état.

==Beginnings of the Free French forces==
Despite &#x27;s call to continue the struggle, few French forces initially pledged their support. By the end of July 1940, only about 7,000 soldiers had joined the Free French Army in England. Three-quarters of French servicemen in Britain requested repatriation.

France was bitterly divided by the conflict. Frenchmen everywhere were forced to choose sides, and often deeply resented those who had made a different choice. One French admiral, René-Émile Godfroy, voiced the opinion of many of those who decided not to join the Free French forces, when in June 1940, he explained to the exasperated British why he would not order his ships in Alexandria harbour to join :
:&quot;For us Frenchmen, the fact is that a government still exists in France, a government supported by a Parliament established in non-occupied territory and which in consequence cannot be considered irregular or deposed. The establishment elsewhere of another government, and all support for this other government would clearly be rebellion.&quot;

Equally, few Frenchmen believed that Britain could stand alone. In June 1940, Pétain and his generals told Churchill that &quot;in three weeks, England will have her neck wrung like a chicken&quot;. Of France&#x27;s far-flung empire, only the French domains of Saint Helena (on 23 June at the initiative of Georges Colin, honorary consul of the domains) and the Franco-British ruled New Hebrides condominium in the Pacific (on 20 July) answered &#x27;s call to arms. It was not until late August that Free France would gain significant support in French Equatorial Africa.

Unlike the troops at Dunkirk or naval forces at sea, relatively few members of the French Air Force had the means or opportunity to escape. Like all military personnel trapped on the mainland, they were functionally subject to the Pétain government: &quot;French authorities made it clear that those who acted on their own initiative would be classed as deserters, and guards were placed to thwart efforts to get on board ships.&quot; In the summer of 1940, around a dozen pilots made it to England and volunteered for the RAF to help fight the Luftwaffe. Many more, however, made their way through long and circuitous routes to French territories overseas, eventually regrouping as the Free French Air Force.

The French Navy was better able to immediately respond to &#x27;s call to arms. Most units initially stayed loyal to Vichy, but about 3,600 sailors operating 50 ships around the world joined with the Royal Navy and formed the nucleus of the Free French Naval Forces (FFNF; in French: FNFL). France&#x27;s surrender found her only aircraft carrier, , en route from the United States loaded with a precious cargo of American fighter and bomber aircraft. Unwilling to return to occupied France, but likewise reluctant to join , &quot;Béarn&quot; instead sought harbour in Martinique, her crew showing little inclination to side with the British in their continued fight against the Nazis. Already obsolete at the start of the war, she would remain in Martinique for the next four years, her aircraft rusting in the tropical climate.

Many of the men in the French colonies felt a special need to defend France, their distant &quot;motherland,&quot; eventually making up two-thirds of &#x27;s Free French Forces.

===Composition===
The Free French forces included men from the French Pacific Islands. Mainly coming from Tahiti, there were 550 volunteers in April 1941. They would serve through the North African campaign (including the Battle of Bir Hakeim), the Italian Campaign and much of the Liberation of France. In November 1944, 275 remaining volunteers were repatriated and replaced with men of French Forces of the Interior to deal better with the cold weather.

The Free French forces also included 5,000 non-French Europeans, mainly serving in units of the Foreign Legion. There were also escaped Spanish Republicans, veterans of the Spanish Civil War. In August 1944, they numbered 350 men.
The ethnic composition of divisions varied. The main common difference, before the period of August to November 1944, was armoured divisions and armour and support elements within infantry divisions were constituted of mainly white French soldiers and infantry elements of infantry divisions were mainly made up of colonial soldiers. Nearly all NCOs and officers were white French. Both the 2e Division Blindée and 1er Division Blindée were made up of around 75% Europeans and 25% Mahgrebians, which is why the 2e Division Blindée was selected for the Liberation of Paris. The 5e Division Blindée was almost entirely made up of white Frenchmen.
Records for the Italian campaign show that both the 3rd Algerian Infantry Division and 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division were made up of 60% Mahgrebians and 40% Europeans, while the 4th Moroccan Infantry Division was made up of 65% Mahgrebians and 35% Europeans. The three North African divisions had one brigade of North African soldiers in each division replaced with a brigade of French Forces of the Interior in January 1945. Both the 1st Free French Division and 9th Colonial Infantry Division contained a strong contingent of Tirailleurs Sénégalais brigades. The 1st Free French Division also contained a mixed brigade of French &quot;Troupes de marine&quot; and the Pacific island volunteers. It also included the Foreign Legion Brigades. In late September and early October 1944, both the Tirailleurs Sénégalais brigades and Pacific Islanders were replaced by brigades of troops recruited from mainland France. This was also when many new Infantry divisions (12 overall) began to be recruited from mainland France, including the 10th Infantry Division The 3rd Armoured Division was also created in May 1945 but saw no combat in the war.

The Free French units in the Royal Air Force, Soviet Air Force, and British SAS were mainly composed of men from metropolitan France.

Before the addition of the assemblies of Northern Africa and the loss of the runaways who fled France and went to Spain in the spring of 1943 (10,000 according to Jean-Noël Vincent&#x27;s calculations), a report by the major state general of the Free French Forces in London from October 30, 1942 records 61,670 combatants in the Army, of which 20,200 were from colonies and 20,000 were from the Levant&#x27;s special troops (non-Free French forces).

In May 1943, citing the Joint Planning Staff, Jean-Louis Crémieux-Brilhac alludes to 79,600 men who constitute ground forces, including 21,500 men from special Syro-Lebanese troops, 2,000 men of color supervised by Free French Forces in northern Palestine, and 650 soldiers assigned to the general headquarters in London.
According to the tally of Henri Écochard, an ex-Free French Forces serviceman, there were at least 54,500 soldiers.

In 2009, in his work on the Free French Forces, Jean-François Muracciole, a French historian specializing in Free France, reevaluated his count with that of Henri Écochard, while considering that Écochard&#x27;s list had greatly underestimated the number of colonial combatants. According to Muracciole, between the creation of the Free French forces in the Summer 1940 and the merger with the Army of Africa in summer 1943, 73,300 men fought for Free France. This included 39,300 French (from metropolitan France and colonial settlers), 30,000 colonial soldiers (mostly from sub-Saharan Africa) and 3,800 foreigners. They were divided up as follows:

Army: 50,000;

Naval: 12,500;

Aviation: 3,200;

Communications in France: 5,700;

Free French Forces committees: 1,900.

General Leclerc&#x27;s second armored division included two units of female volunteers: The Rochambeau Group with the Army (dozens of women) and the Woman Service of the Naval Fleet with the Navy (9 women). Their role consisted of administering first aid to the first line of injured soldiers (often to stop bleeding) before evacuating them by stretcher to ambulances and then driving these ambulances under enemy fire to care centers several kilometers behind the lines.

The following anecdote by Pierre Clostermann suggests the spirit of the times in the Free French Forces; a commander reproaches one of Clostermann&#x27;s comrades for having yellow shoes and a yellow sweater under his uniform, to which the comrade responds: &quot;My Commander, I am a civilian who voluntarily came to fight the war that the soldiers don&#x27;t want to fight!&quot;

==Cross of Lorraine==
 Thierry d&#x27;Argenlieu suggested the adoption of the Cross of Lorraine as a symbol of the Free French. This was chosen to recall the perseverance of Joan of Arc, patron saint of France, whose symbol it had been, the province where she was born, and now partially annexed into Alsace-Lorraine by Nazi Germany, and as a response to the symbol of national-socialism, the Nazi swastika.

In his general order No. 2 of 3 July 1940, Vice Admiral Émile Muselier, two days after assuming the post of chief of the naval and air forces of the Free French, created the naval jack displaying the French colours with a red cross of Lorraine, and a cockade, which also featured the cross of Lorraine. Modern ships that share the same name as ships of the FNFL—such as and —are entitled to fly the Free French naval jack as a mark of honour.

A monument on Lyle Hill in Greenock, in the shape of the Cross of Lorraine combined with an anchor, was raised by subscription as a memorial to the Free French naval vessels which sailed from the Firth of Clyde to take part in the . It has plaques commemorating the loss of the Flower-class corvettes &quot;Alyssa&quot; and &quot;Mimosa&quot;, and of the submarine . Locally, it is also associated with the memory of the loss of the destroyer which blew up at the Tail of the Bank.

==Mers El Kébir and the fate of the French Navy==
After the fall of France, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill feared that, in German or Italian hands, the ships of the French Navy would pose a grave threat to the Allies. He therefore insisted that French warships either join the Allies or else adopt neutrality in a British, French, or neutral port. Churchill was determined that French warships would not be in a position to support a German invasion of Britain, though he feared that a direct attack on the French Navy might cause the Vichy regime to actively ally itself with the Nazis.

On 3 July 1940, Admiral Marcel-Bruno Gensoul was provided an ultimatum by the British: 
Gensoul&#x27;s orders allowed him to accept internment in the West Indies, but after a discussion lasting ten hours, he rejected all offers, and British warships commanded by Admiral James Somerville attacked French ships during the attack on Mers-el-Kébir in Algeria, sinking or crippling three battleships. Because the Vichy government only said that there had been no alternatives offered, the attack caused great bitterness in France, particularly in the Navy (over 1,000 French sailors were killed), and helped to reinforce the ancient stereotype of &quot;perfide Albion&quot;. Such actions discouraged many French soldiers from joining the Free French forces.

Despite this, some French warships and sailors did remain on the Allied side or join the FNFL later, such as the mine-laying submarine , whose crew voted almost unanimously to fight alongside Britain, the destroyer , and the then-largest submarine in the world, . The first loss of the FNFL occurred on 7 November 1940, when the patrol boat &quot;Poulmic&quot; struck a mine in the English Channel.

Most ships that had remained on the Vichy side and were not scuttled with the main French fleet in Toulon, mostly those in the colonies that had remained loyal to Vichy until the end of the regime through the Case Anton Axis invasion and occupation of the &quot;zone libre&quot; and Tunisia, changed sides then.

In November 1940, around 1,700 officers and men of the French Navy took advantage of the British offer of repatriation to France, and were transported home on a hospital ship travelling under the International Red Cross. This did not stop the Germans from torpedoing the ship, and 400 men were drowned.

The FNFL, commanded first by Admiral Emile Muselier and then by Philippe Auboyneau and Georges Thierry d&#x27;Argenlieu, played a role in the liberation of French colonies throughout the world including Operation Torch in French north Africa, escorting convoys during the Battle of the Atlantic, in supporting the French Resistance in non-Free French territories, in Operation Neptune in Normandy and Operation Dragoon in Provence for the liberation of mainland France, and in the Pacific War.

In total during the war, around 50 major ships and a few dozen minor and auxiliary ships were part of the Free French navy. It also included half a dozen battalions of naval infantry and commandos, as well as naval aviation squadrons, one aboard and one squadron of anti-submarine Catalinas. The French merchant marine siding with the Allies counted over 170 ships.

==Struggle for control of the French colonies==

With metropolitan France firmly under Germany&#x27;s thumb and the Allies too weak to challenge this, turned his attention to France&#x27;s vast overseas empire.

===African campaign and the Empire Defence Council===
De Gaulle was optimistic that France&#x27;s colonies in western and central Africa, which had strong trading links with British territories, might be sympathetic to the Free French. Pierre Boisson, the governor-general of French Equatorial Africa, was a staunch supporter of the Vichy regime, unlike Félix Éboué, the governor of French Chad, a subsection of the overall colony. Boisson was soon promoted to &quot;High Commissioner of Colonies&quot; and transferred to Dakar, leaving Éboué with more direct authority over Chad. On 26 August, with the help of his top military official, Éboué pledged his colony&#x27;s allegiance to Free France. By the end of August, all of French Equatorial Africa (including the League of Nations mandate French Cameroun) had joined Free France, with the exception of French Gabon.
With these colonies came vital manpower—a large number of African colonial troops, who would form the nucleus of &#x27;s army. From July to November 1940, the FFF would engage in fighting with troops loyal to Vichy France in Africa, with success and failure on both sides.

In September 1940 an Anglo French naval force fought the Battle of Dakar, also known as Operation Menace, an unsuccessful attempt to capture the strategic port of Dakar in French West Africa. The local authorities were not impressed by the Allied show of strength, and had the better of the naval bombardment which followed, leading to a humiliating withdrawal by the Allied ships. So strong was &#x27;s sense of failure that he even considered suicide.

There was better news in November 1940 when the FFF achieved victory at the Battle of Gabon (or Battle of Libreville) under the very skilled General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque (General Leclerc). personally surveyed the situation in Chad, the first African colony to join Free France, located on the southern border of Libya, and the battle resulted in free French forces taking Libreville, Gabon.

By the end of November 1940 French Equatorial Africa was wholly under the control of Free France, but the failures at Dakar had led French West Africa to declare allegiance to Vichy, to which they would remain loyal until the fall of the regime in November 1942.

On 27 October 1940 the Empire Defence Council was established to organise and administer the imperial possessions under Free French rule, and as an alternative provisional French government. It was constituted of high-ranking officers and the governors of the free colonies, notably governor Félix Éboué of Chad. Its creation was announced by the Brazzaville Manifesto that day. was what claimed to represent, or rather, as he put it simply, &quot;&quot;; Vichy France was a &quot;pseudo government&quot;, an illegal entity.

In 1941–1942, the African FFF slowly grew in strength and even expanded operations north into Italian Libya. In February 1941, Free French Forces invaded Cyrenaica, again led by Leclerc, capturing the Italian fort at the oasis of Kufra. In 1942, Leclerc&#x27;s forces and soldiers from the British Long Range Desert Group captured parts of the province of Fezzan. At the end of 1942, Leclerc moved his forces into Tripolitania to join British Commonwealth and other FFF forces in the Run for Tunis.

===Asia and the Pacific===
France also had possessions in Asia and the Pacific, and these far-flung colonies would experience similar problems of divided loyalties. French India and the French South Pacific colonies of New Caledonia, French Polynesia and the New Hebrides joined Free France in the summer 1940, drawing official American interest. These South Pacific colonies would later provide vital Allied bases in the Pacific Ocean during the war with Japan.

French Indochina was invaded by Japan in September 1940, although for most of the war the colony remained under nominal Vichy control. On 9 March 1945, the Japanese launched a coup and took full control of Indochina by the beginning of May. Japanese rule in Indochina lasted until the successful August Revolution which was led by communist-dominated Viet Minh, and the entry of British and Chinese forces.

From June 1940 until February 1943, the concession of Guangzhouwan (Kouang-Tchéou-Wan or Fort-Boyard), in South China, remained under the administration of Free France. The Republic of China, after the fall of Paris in 1940, recognised the London-exiled Free French government as Guangzhouwan&#x27;s legitimate authority and established diplomatic relations with them, something facilitated by the fact that the colony was surrounded by the Republic of China&#x27;s territory and was not in physical contact with French Indochina. In February 1943 the Imperial Japanese Army invaded and occupied the leased territory.

===North America===
In North America, Saint-Pierre and Miquelon (near Newfoundland) joined the Free French after an &quot;invasion&quot; on 24 December 1941 by Rear Admiral Emile Muselier and the forces he was able to load onto three corvettes and a submarine of the FNFL. The action at Saint-Pierre and Miquelon created a serious diplomatic incident with the United States, despite this being the first French possession in the Americas to join the Allies, which doctrinally objected to the use of military means by colonial powers in the western hemisphere and recognised Vichy as the official French government.

Mainly because of this and of the often very frosty relations between Free France and the USA (with President Roosevelt&#x27;s profound distrust of playing a key part in that, with him being firmly convinced that the general&#x27;s aim was to create a South-American style junta and become the dictator of France), other French possessions in the New World were among the last to defect from Vichy to the Allies (with Martinique holding out until July 1943).

===Syria and East Africa===
In 1941, the FFF fought alongside British Empire troops against the Italians in Italian East Africa during the East African Campaign.

In June 1941, during the Syria-Lebanon campaign (Operation Exporter), Free French Forces fighting alongside British Commonwealth forces faced substantial numbers of troops loyal to Vichy France—this time in the Levant. had assured Churchill that the French units in Syria would rise to the call of Free France, but this was not the case. After bitter fighting, with around 1,000 dead on each side (including Vichy and Free French Foreign Legionnaires fratricide when the 13th Demi-Brigade (D.B.L.E.) clashed with the 6th Foreign Infantry Regiment near Damascus). General Henri Dentz and his Vichy Army of the Levant were eventually defeated by the largely British allied forces in July 1941.

The British did not themselves occupy Syria; rather, the Free French General Georges Catroux was appointed High Commissioner of the Levant, and from this point, Free France would control both Syria and Lebanon until they became independent in 1946 and 1943 respectively. However, despite this success, the numbers of the FFF did not grow as much as had been wished for. Of nearly 38,000 Vichy French prisoners of war, just 5,668 men volunteered to join the forces of General ; the remainder chose to be repatriated to France.

Despite this bleak picture, by the end of 1941, the United States had entered the war, and the Soviet Union had also joined the Allied side, stopping the Germans outside Moscow in the first major reverse for the Nazis. Gradually the tide of war began to shift, and with it the perception that Hitler could at last be beaten. Support for Free France began to grow, though the Vichy French forces would continue to resist Allied armies—and the Free French—when attacked by them until the end of 1942.

===Creation of the French National Committee (CNF)===
Reflecting the growing strength of Free France was the foundation of the French National Committee (French: &quot;Comité national français&quot;, CNF) in September 1941 and the official name change from to in July 1942.

The United States granted Lend-Lease support to the CNF on 24 November.

===Madagascar===
In June 1942, the British attacked the strategically important colony of French Madagascar, hoping to prevent its falling into Japanese hands and especially the use of Diego-Suarez&#x27;s harbour as a base for the Imperial Japanese Navy. Once again the Allied landings faced resistance from Vichy forces, led by Governor-General Armand Léon Annet. On 5 November 1942, Annet, at last, surrendered. As in Syria, only a minority of the captured Vichy soldiers chose to join the Free French. After the battle, Free French general Paul Legentilhomme was appointed High Commissioner for Madagascar.

==Battle of Bir Hakeim==

Throughout 1942 in North Africa, British Empire forces fought a desperate land campaign against the Germans and Italians to prevent the loss of Egypt and the vital Suez canal. Here, fighting in the harsh Libyan desert, Free French soldiers distinguished themselves. General Marie Pierre Koenig and his unit—the 1st Free French Infantry Brigade—resisted the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; at the Battle of Bir Hakeim in June 1942, although they were eventually obliged to withdraw, as Allied forces retreated to El Alamein, their lowest ebb in the North African campaign. Koenig defended Bir Hakeim from 26 May to 11 June against superior German and Italian forces led by Generaloberst Erwin Rommel, proving that the FFF could be taken seriously by the Allies as a fighting force. British General Claude Auchinleck said on 12 June 1942, of the battle: &quot;The United Nations need to be filled with admiration and gratitude, in respect of these French troops and their brave General Koenig&quot;. Even Hitler was impressed, announcing to the journalist Lutz Koch, recently returned from Bir Hakeim:

You hear, Gentlemen? It is a new evidence that I have always been right! The French are, after us, the best soldiers! Even with its current birthrate, France will always be able to mobilise a hundred divisions! After this war, we will have to find allies able to contain a country which is capable of military exploits that astonish the world like they are doing right now in Bir-Hakeim!Generalmajor Friedrich von Mellenthin wrote in his mémoirs &quot;Panzer Battles&quot;,[I]n the whole course of the desert war, we never encountered a more heroic and well-sustained defence.

==First successes==
From 23 October to 4 November 1942, Allied forces under general Bernard Montgomery, including the FFI, won the Second battle of El Alamein, driving Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps out of Egypt and back into Libya. This was the first major success of a Western Allied army against the Axis powers, and marked a key turning point in the war.

===Operation Torch===

Soon afterwards in November 1942, the Allies launched Operation Torch in the west, an invasion of Vichy-controlled French North Africa. An Anglo-American force of 63,000 men landed in French Morocco and Algeria. The long-term goal was to clear German and Italian troops from North Africa, enhance naval control of the Mediterranean, and prepare an invasion of Italy in 1943. The Allies had hoped that Vichy forces would offer only token resistance to the Allies, but instead they fought hard, incurring heavy casualties. As a French foreign legionnaire put it after seeing his comrades die in an American bombing raid: &quot;Ever since the fall of France, we had dreamed of deliverance, but we did not want it that way&quot;.

After 8 November 1942 putsch by the French resistance that prevented the 19th Corps from responding effectively to the allied landings around Algiers the same day, most Vichy figures were arrested (including General Alphonse Juin, chief commander in North Africa, and Vichy admiral François Darlan). However, Darlan was released and U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower finally accepted his self-nomination as high commissioner of North Africa and French West Africa, a move that enraged , who refused to recognise his status.

Henri Giraud, a general who had escaped from military captivity in Germany in April 1942, had negotiated with the Americans for leadership in the invasion. He arrived in Algiers on 10 November, and agreed to subordinate himself to Admiral Darlan as the commander of the French African army.

Later that day Darlan ordered a ceasefire and Vichy French forces began, en masse, to join the Free French cause. Initially at least the effectiveness of these new recruits was hampered by a scarcity of weaponry and, among some of the officer class, a lack of conviction in their new cause.

After the signing of the cease-fire, the Germans lost faith in the Vichy regime, and on 11 November 1942 German and Italian forces occupied Vichy France (Case Anton), violating the 1940 armistice, and triggering the scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon on 27 November 1942. In response, the Vichy Army of Africa joined the Allied side. They fought in Tunisia for six months until April 1943, when they joined the campaign in Italy as part of the French Expeditionary Corps in Italy (FEC).

Admiral Darlan was assassinated on 24 December 1942 in Algiers by the young monarchist Bonnier de La Chapelle. Although de la Chapelle had been a member of the resistance group led by Henri d&#x27;Astier de La Vigerie, it is believed he was acting as an individual.

On 28 December, after a prolonged blockade, the Vichy forces in French Somaliland were ousted.

After these successes, Guadeloupe and Martinique in the West Indies—as well as French Guiana on the northern coast of South America—finally joined Free France in the first months of 1943. In November 1943, the French forces received enough military equipment through Lend-Lease to re-equip eight divisions and allow the return of borrowed British equipment.

===Creation of the French Committee of National Liberation (CFLN)===

The Vichy forces in North Africa had been under Darlan&#x27;s command and had surrendered on his orders. The Allies recognised his self-nomination as High Commissioner of France (French military and civilian commander-in-chief, ) for North and West Africa. He ordered them to cease resisting and co-operate with the Allies, which they did. By the time the Tunisia Campaign was fought, the ex-Vichy French forces in North Africa had been merged with the FFF.

After Admiral Darlan&#x27;s assassination, Giraud became his &quot;de facto&quot; successor in French Africa with Allied support. This occurred through a series of consultations between Giraud and . The latter wanted to pursue a political position in France and agreed to have Giraud as commander in chief, as the more qualified military person of the two. It is questionable that he ordered that many French resistance leaders who had helped Eisenhower&#x27;s troops be arrested, without any protest by Roosevelt&#x27;s representative, Robert Murphy.

Later, the Americans sent Jean Monnet to counsel Giraud and to press him into repeal the Vichy laws. The Cremieux decree, which granted French citizenship to Jews in Algeria and which had been repealed by Vichy, was immediately restored by General . Democratic rule was restored in French Algeria, and the Communists and Jews liberated from the concentration camps.

Giraud took part in the Casablanca conference in January 1943 with Roosevelt, Churchill and . The Allies discussed their general strategy for the war, and recognised joint leadership of North Africa by Giraud and . Henri Giraud and Charles then became co-presidents of the French Committee of National Liberation (, CFLN), which unified the territories controlled by them and was officially founded on 3 June 1943.

The CFLN set up a temporary French government in Algiers, raised more troops and re-organised, re-trained and re-equipped the Free French military, in co-operation with Allied forces in preparation of future operations against Italy and the German Atlantic wall.

===Eastern Front===
The Normandie-Niemen Regiment, founded at the suggestion of Charles , was a fighter regiment of the Free French Air Force that served on the Eastern Front of the European Theatre of World War II with the 1st Air Army. The regiment is notable for being the only air combat unit from an Allied western country to participate on the Eastern Front during World War II (except brief interventions from RAF and USAAF units) and the only one to fight together with the Soviets until the end of the war in Europe.

The unit was the GC3 ( or 3rd Fighter Group) in the Free French Air Force, first commanded by Jean Tulasne. The unit originated in mid-1943 during World War II. Initially the comprised a group of French fighter pilots sent to aid Soviet forces at the suggestion of Charles , leader of the Free French Forces, who felt it important that French servicemen serve on all fronts in the war. The regiment fought in three campaigns on behalf of the Soviet Union between 22 March 1943, and 9 May 1945, during which time it destroyed 273 enemy aircraft and received numerous orders, citations and decorations from both France and the Soviet Union, including the French and the Soviet Order of the Red Banner. Joseph Stalin awarded the unit the name Niemen for its participation in the Battle of the Niemen River.

==Tunisia, Italy and Corsica==
The Free French forces participated in the Tunisian Campaign. Together with British and Commonwealth forces, the FFF advanced from the south while the formerly Vichy-loyal Army of Africa advanced from the west together with the Americans. The fighting in Tunisia ended with the Axis forces surrendering to the Allies in July 1943.

During the campaign in Italy during 1943–1944, a total of between 70,000 and 130,000 Free French soldiers fought on the Allied side. The French Expeditionary Corps consisted of 60% colonial soldiers, mostly Moroccans and 40% Europeans, mostly Pied-Noirs. They took part in the fighting on the Winter Line and Gustav Line, distinguishing themselves at Monte Cassino in Operation Diadem. In what came to be known as the Marocchinate in one of the worst mass atrocities committed by Allied troops during the war, the Moroccan Goumiers, raped and killed Italians civilians on a massive scale during those operations, often under the indifferent eye of their French officers, if not their encouragement. Acts of violence by French troops against civilians continued even after the liberation of Rome. French Marshal Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, claimed that such cases were isolated events exploited by German propaganda to smear allies, particularly French troops.

In September 1943, the liberation of Corsica from Italian occupation began, after the Italian armistice, with the landing of elements of the reconstituted French I Corps (Operation Vesuvius).

== and National Council of the Resistance==

The French Resistance gradually grew in strength. General set a plan to bring together the fragmented groups under his leadership. He changed the name of his movement to &quot;Fighting French Forces&quot; (&quot;Forces Françaises Combattantes&quot;) and sent Jean Moulin back to France as his formal link to the irregulars throughout the occupied country to co-ordinate the eight major Résistance groups into one organisation. Moulin got their agreement to form the &quot;National Council of the Resistance&quot; (&quot;Conseil National de la Résistance&quot;). Moulin was eventually captured, and died under brutal torture by the Gestapo.

De Gaulle&#x27;s influence had also grown in France, and in 1942 one resistance leader called him &quot;the only possible leader for the France that fights&quot;. Other Gaullists, those who could not leave France (that is, the overwhelming majority of them), remained in the territories ruled by Vichy and the Axis occupation forces, building networks of propagandists, spies and saboteurs to harass and discomfit the enemy.

Later, the Resistance was more formally referred to as the &quot;French Forces of the Interior&quot; (Forces Françaises de l&#x27;Intérieur, or FFI). From October 1944 – March 1945, many FFI units were amalgamated into the French Army to regularise the units.

== Liberation of France ==

The liberation of continental France began on D-Day, 6 June 1944, with the invasion of Normandy, the amphibious assault aimed at establishing a bridgehead for the forces of Operation Overlord. At first hampered by very stiff German resistance and the bocage terrain of Normandy, the Allies broke out of Normandy at Avranches on 25–31 July 1944. Combined with the landings in Provence of Operation Dragoon on 14 August 1944, the threat of being caught in a pincer movement led to a very rapid German retreat, and by September 1944 most of France had been liberated.

=== Normandy and Provence landings ===

Opening a &quot;Second Front&quot; was a top priority for the Allies, and especially for the Soviets to relieve their burden on the Eastern Front. While Italy had been knocked out of the war in the Italian campaign in September 1943, the easily defensible terrain of the narrow peninsula required only a relatively limited number of German troops to protect and occupy their new puppet state in northern Italy. However, as the Dieppe raid had shown, assaulting the Atlantic Wall was not an endeavour to be taken lightly. It required extensive preparations such as the construction of artificial ports (Operation Mulberry) and an underwater pipeline across the English Channel (Operation Pluto), intensive bombardment of railways and German logistics in France (the Transportation Plan), and the wide-ranging military deception such as creating entire dummy armies like FUSAG (Operation Bodyguard) to make the Germans believe the invasion would take place where the Channel was at its narrowest.

By the time of the Normandy Invasion, the Free French forces numbered around 500,000 strong. 900 Free French paratroopers landed as part of the British Special Air Service&#x27;s (SAS) SAS Brigade; the 2e Division Blindée (2nd Armoured Division or 2e DB)—under General Leclerc—landed at Utah Beach in Normandy on 1 August 1944 together with other follow-on Free French forces, and eventually led the drive toward Paris.
In the battle for Caen, bitter fighting led to the almost total destruction of the city, and stalemated the Allies. They had more success in the western American sector of the front, where after the Operation Cobra breakthrough in late July they caught 50,000 Germans in the Falaise pocket.

The invasion was preceded by weeks of intense resistance activity. Coordinated with the massive bombardments of the Transportation Plan and supported by the SOE and the OSS, partisans systematically sabotaged railway lines, destroyed bridges, cut German supply lines, and provided general intelligence to the allied forces. The constant harassment took its toll on the German troops. Large remote areas were no-go zones for them and free zones for the maquisards so-called after the maquis shrubland that provided ideal terrain for guerrilla warfare. For instance, a large number of German units were required to clear the maquis du Vercors, which they eventually succeeded with, but this and numerous other actions behind German lines contributed to a much faster advance following the Provence landings than the Allied leadership had anticipated.

The main part of French Expeditionary Corps in Italy which had been fighting there was withdrawn from the Italian front, and added to the French First Army—under General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny—and joined the US 7th Army to form the US 6th Army Group. That was the force that conducted Operation Dragoon (also known as Operation Anvil), the Allied invasion of southern France. The objective of the French 2nd Corps was to capture ports at Toulon (France&#x27;s largest naval port) and Marseille (France&#x27;s largest commercial port) in order to secure a vital supply line for the incoming troops. Most of the German troops there were second-line, consisting mainly of static and occupation units with a large number of &quot;Osttruppen&quot; volunteers, and with a single armoured division, the &quot;11. Panzer-Division&quot;. The Allies sustained only relatively light casualties during the amphibious assault, and were soon in an all-out pursuit of a German army in full retreat along the Rhône valley and the Route Napoleon. Within 12 days the French forces were able to secure both ports, destroying two German Divisions in the process. Then on 12 September, French forces were able to connect to General George Patton&#x27;s Third Army. Toulon and Marseille were soon providing supplies not only to the 6th Army Group but also to General Omar Bradley&#x27;s 12th Army Group, which included Patton&#x27;s Army. For its part, troops from de Lattre&#x27;s French First Army were the first Allied troops to reach the Rhine.

While on the right flank the French liberation army was covering Alsace-Lorraine (and the Alpine front against German-occupied Italy), the centre was made up of US forces in the south (12th Army Group) and British and Commonwealth forces in the north (21st Army Group). On the left flank, Canadian forces cleared the Channel coast, taking Antwerp on 4 September 1944.

== Liberation of Paris ==

After the failed 20 July plot against him, Hitler had given orders to have Paris destroyed should it fall to the Allies, similarly to the planned destruction of Warsaw.

Mindful of this and other strategic considerations, General Dwight D. Eisenhower was planning to by-pass the city. At this time, Parisians started a general strike on 15 August 1944 that escalated into a full-scale uprising of the FFI a few days later. As the Allied forces waited near Paris, and his Free French government put General Eisenhower under pressure. was furious about the delay and was unwilling to allow the people of Paris to be slaughtered as had happened in the Polish capital of Warsaw during the Warsaw uprising. ordered General Leclerc to attack single-handedly without the aid of Allied forces. Eventually, Eisenhower agreed to detach the 4th US Infantry Division in support of the French attack.
The Allied High Command (SHAEF) requested the Free French force in question to be all-white, if possible, but this was very difficult because of the large numbers of black West Africans in their ranks. General Leclerc sent a small advance party to enter Paris, with the message that the 2e DB (composed of 10,500 French, 3,600 Maghrebis and about 350 Spaniards in the 9th company of the 3rd Battalion of the made up mainly of Spanish Republican exiles) would be there the following day. This party was commanded by Captain Raymond Dronne, and was given the honour to be the first Allied unit to enter Paris ahead of the . The 1er Bataillon de Fusiliers Marins Commandos formed from the Free French Navy Fusiliers-Marins that had landed on Sword Beach were also amongst the first of the Free French forces to enter Paris.

The military governor of the city, Dietrich von Choltitz, surrendered on 25 August, ignoring Hitler&#x27;s orders to destroy the city and fight to the last man. Jubilant crowds greeted the Liberation of Paris. French forces and conducted a now iconic parade through the city.

==Provisional republic and the war against Germany and Japan==

===Re-establishment of a provisional French Republic and its government (GPRF)===
The Provisional Government of the French Republic ( or GPRF) was officially created by the CNFL and succeeded it on 3 June 1944, the day before arrived in London from Algiers on Churchill&#x27;s invitation, and three days before D-Day. Its creation marked the re-establishment of France as a republic, and the official end of Free France. Among its most immediate concerns were to ensure that France did not come under allied military administration, preserving the sovereignty of France and freeing Allied troops for fighting on the front.

After the liberation of Paris on 25 August 1944, it moved back to the capital, establishing a new &quot;national unanimity&quot; government on 9 September 1944, including Gaullists, nationalists, socialists, communists and anarchists, and uniting the politically divided Resistance. Among its foreign policy goals was to secure a French occupation zone in Germany and a permanent UNSC seat. This was assured through a large military contribution on the western front.

Several alleged Vichy loyalists involved in the Milice (a paramilitary militia)—which was established by Sturmbannführer Joseph Darnand who hunted the Resistance with the Gestapo—were made prisoners in a post-liberation purge known as the (legal purge or cleansing). Some were executed without trial, in &quot;wild cleansings&quot; (). Women accused of &quot;horizontal collaboration&quot; because of alleged sexual relationships with Germans during the occupation were arrested and had their heads shaved, were publicly exhibited and some were allowed to be mauled by mobs.

On 17 August, Pierre Laval was taken to Belfort by the Germans. On 20 August, under German military escort, Pétain was forcibly moved to Belfort, and on 7 September to the Sigmaringen enclave in southern Germany, where 1,000 of his followers (including Louis-Ferdinand Céline) joined him. There they established a government in exile, challenging the legitimacy of &#x27;s GPRF. As a sign of protest over his forced move, Pétain refused to take office, and was eventually replaced by Fernand de Brinon. The Vichy regime&#x27;s exile ended when Free French forces reached the town and captured its members on 22 April 1945, the same day that the 3rd Algerian Infantry Division took Stuttgart. Laval, Vichy&#x27;s prime minister in 1942–1944, was executed for treason. Pétain, &quot;Chief of the French State&quot; and hero of Verdun, was also condemned to death but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.

As the wartime government of France in 1944–1945, its main purposes were to handle the aftermath of the occupation of France and continue to wage war against Germany as a major Ally. It also made several important reforms and political decisions, such as granting women the right to vote, founding the , and laying the grounds of social security in France, and lasted until the establishment of the IVth Republic on 14 October 1946, preparing its new constitution.

==Campaigns in France and Germany 1944–1945==
By September 1944, the Free French forces stood at 560,000 (including 176,500 White French from North Africa, 63,000 metropolitan French, 233,000 Maghrebis and 80,000 from Black Africa). The GPRF set about raising new troops to participate in the advance to the Rhine and the invasion of Germany, using the FFI as military cadres and manpower pools of experienced fighters to allow a very large and rapid expansion of the French Liberation Army. It was well equipped and well supplied despite the economic disruption brought by the occupation thanks to Lend-Lease, and their number rose to 1 million by the end of the year. French forces were fighting in Alsace-Lorraine, the Alps, and besieging the heavily fortified French Atlantic coast submarine bases that remained Hitler-mandated stay-behind &quot;fortresses&quot; in ports along the Atlantic coast like La Rochelle and Saint-Nazaire until the German capitulation in May 1945.

Also in September 1944, the Allies having outrun their logistic tail (the &quot;Red Ball Express&quot;), the front stabilised along Belgium&#x27;s northern and eastern borders and in Lorraine. From then on it moved at a slower pace, first to the Siegfried Line and then in the early months of 1945 to the Rhine in increments. For instance, the Ist Corps seized the Belfort Gap in a coup de main offensive in November 1944, their German opponents believing they had entrenched for the winter.
The French 2nd Armoured Division, tip of the spear of the Free French forces that had participated in the Normandy Campaign and liberated Paris, went on to liberate Strasbourg on 23 November 1944, thus fulfilling the Oath of Kufra made by its commanding officer General Leclerc almost four years earlier. The unit under his command, barely above company size when it had captured the Italian fort, had grown into a full-strength armoured division.

The spearhead of the Free French First Army that had landed in Provence was the Ist Corps. Its leading unit, the French 1st Armoured Division, was the first Western Allied unit to reach the Rhône (25 August 1944), the Rhine (19 November 1944) and the Danube (21 April 1945). On 22 April 1945, it captured Sigmaringen in Baden-Württemberg, where the last Vichy regime exiles, including Marshal Pétain, were hosted by the Germans in one of the ancestral castles of the Hohenzollern dynasty.

They participated in stopping Operation Nordwind, the very last German major offensive on the western front in January 1945, and in collapsing the Colmar Pocket in January–February 1945, capturing and destroying most of the German XIXth Army. Operations by the First Army in April 1945 encircled and captured the German XVIII SS Corps in the Black Forest, and cleared and occupied south-western Germany. At the end of the war, the motto of the French First Army was , referring to the two great German rivers that it had reached and crossed during its combat operations.

In May 1945, by the end of the war in Europe, the Free French forces comprised 1,300,000 personnel, and included around forty divisions making it the fourth largest Allied army in Europe behind the Soviet Union, the US and Britain. The GPRF sent an expeditionary force to the Pacific to retake French Indochina from the Japanese, but Japan surrendered and Viet Minh took advantage by the successful August Revolution before they could arrive in theatre.

At that time, General Alphonse Juin was the chief of staff of the French army, but it was General François Sevez who represented France at Reims on 7 May, while General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny led the French delegation at Berlin on V-E day, as he was the commander of the French First Army. At the Yalta Conference, Germany had been divided into Soviet, American and British occupation zones, but France was then given an occupation zone in Germany, as well as in Austria and in the city of Berlin. It was not only the role that France played in the war which was recognised, but its important strategic position and significance in the Cold War as a major democratic, capitalist nation of Western Europe in holding back the influence of communism on the continent.

Approximately 58,000 men were killed fighting in the Free French forces between 1940 and 1945.

==World War II victory==

A point of strong disagreement between and the Big Three (Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill), was that the President of the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF), established on 3 June 1944, was not recognised as the legitimate representative of France. Even though had been recognised as the leader of Free France by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill back on 28 June 1940, his GPRF presidency had not resulted from democratic elections. However, two months after the liberation of Paris and one month after the new &quot;unanimity government&quot;, the Big Three recognised the GPRF on 23 October 1944.

In his liberation of Paris speech, argued &quot;It will not be enough that, with the help of our dear and admirable Allies, we have got rid of him [the Germans] from our home for us to be satisfied after what happened. We want to enter his territory as it should be, as victors&quot;, clearly showing his ambition that France be considered one of the World War II victors just like the Big Three. This perspective was not shared by the western Allies, as was demonstrated in the German Instrument of Surrender&#x27;s First Act. The French occupation zones in Germany and in West Berlin cemented this ambition.

==Legacy==
The Free French Memorial on Lyle Hill in Greenock, in western Scotland, in the shape of the Cross of Lorraine combined with an anchor, was raised by subscription as a memorial to sailors on the Free French Naval Forces vessels that sailed from the Firth of Clyde to take part in the Battle of the Atlantic.

The memorial is also associated, locally, with the memory of the which sank at the &quot;Tail of the Bank&quot;.

To this day, General &#x27;s Appeal of 18 June 1940 remains one of the most famous speeches in French history.

<text>Military slang is an array of colloquial terminology used commonly by military personnel, including slang which is unique to or originates with the armed forces. In English-speaking countries, it often takes the form of abbreviations/acronyms or derivations of the NATO Phonetic Alphabet, or otherwise incorporates aspects of formal military terms and concepts. Military slang is often used to reinforce or reflect (usually friendly and humorous) interservice rivalries.

==Acronym slang in the U.S. Military==

A number of military slang terms are acronyms. Rick Atkinson ascribes the origin of SNAFU (Situation Normal, All Fucked Up), FUBAR (Fucked Up Beyond Any Repair or &quot;All Recognition&quot;), and a bevy of other terms to cynical GIs ridiculing the United States Army&#x27;s penchant for acronyms.

Terms then end up being used in other industries as these GIs complete their services. For example, FUBAR evolved into Foobar as GIs coming home from World War II matriculated into Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with the first written use from a club at MIT called the Tech Model Railroad Club.

Colloquially called , , , giant holts, or holes in various dialects, fogous have similarities with souterrains or earth-houses of northern Europe and particularly Scotland, including Orkney. Fewer than 15 confirmed fogous have been found.

==Construction==
Fogous consist of a buried, usually corbelled stone wall, tapering at the top and capped by stone slabs. They were mainly constructed by excavating a sloping trench about wide and deep, lining it with drystone walling as stated, which was battered inwards and roofed with flat slabs; soil from excavation was heaped on top as at Pendeen Vau or incorporated in the rampart of the enclosure as at Halliggye Fogou, Trelowarren.

==Function==
It has been conjectured that they were made as refuges, or for religious purposes, or for food storage.

Fogous&#x27; central locations inside settlements and the work that evidently went into constructing them indicates their importance to the community, but their original purpose is no longer known. Many are oriented southwest–northeast, with the opening facing the prevailing wind.
Excavated examples at Halliggye, Carn Euny, and Boden suggest fogous may have been deliberately filled back in after use, or upon abandonment of the surrounding settlement.

Iron-age ritual use seems unlikely, given the Celtic druids&#x27; known custom of worship in outdoor spaces open to the sky.

===Refuge hypothesis===
Currently, both documentary and subsequent archaeological evidence support their use as refuges, possibly to survive raids, as first suggested by Kenneth MacGregor (2004).

Nancy Edwards wrote that &quot;evidence would support this: Creeps, hidden chambers, and sally ports, as well as the fact that most sonterrains were invisible above ground, would all have helped to provide protection in the case of sudden attack. They could, however, turn into death-traps if the aggression was prolonged.&quot;

===Cold storage hypothesis===
Although in their present damp condition, use for food storage seems impractical, Diodorus Siculus stated that Iron Age people in Britain stored their grain in &quot;underground repositories&quot;, adding contemporary evidence to speculation that their main purpose was food storage.
Where they were open at both ends, a fogou could provide suitable conditions for storing some foods, especially the drying of meat, or storage of dairy products such as milk, butter, and cheese where natural moulds would assist in preservation of perishable foodstuffs.

Ashpits found at Trewardreva and in the circular side-chamber at Carn Euny were probably for preserving gulls&#x27; eggs, as was done on Saint Kilda in Scotland. A layer of black greasy mould with charcoal, animal and bird bones at Treveneague is also very suggestive of food storage.

==Etymology==
The word may be related to the Cornish words (plural ) and/or (plural ), both meaning &quot;cave&quot;. In the past, locals in Cornwall have called them &quot;fuggy-holes&quot; but this term is seldom used today.

==History and archaeology==

One function of the souterrains of Gaul and early medieval Ireland is to hide in boltholes to escape detection by raiders. Fogous may have had a similar function to the underground kivas of the Puebloans.

Other underground structures such as &quot;earth houses&quot; or souterrains have some similarities with fogous. An example of an excavated souterrain is the site at Rosal, Strathnaver, Sutherland. In this example no finds were made inside the structure and the roof may have been only partially covered with stones, a timber roof being present on part of it. It was suggested that souterrains could have been used as barns. Fogous are often associated with dwellings such as Iron Age villages.

Petrospheres or &quot;stone balls&quot; have been found in souterrains and, as possible symbols of power within prehistoric society, this discovery suggest a use other than basic storage of food and resources.

Two fogous have been excavated by &quot;Time Team&quot;, Boleigh Fogou in Series 3 (1995) and Boden Vean in Series 21 (2021).

==Sites==

Halliggye Fogou on the Trelowarren estate is generally accepted to be the largest and best surviving fogou.

Other unspoiled fogous survive at Carn Euny, Boleigh Fogou near Lamorna, Pendeen Vau and Trewardreva near Constantine, the last of which is known locally as Pixie&#x27;s Hall or Piskey Hall.

Partially destroyed fogous exist at Chysauster, which is in the care of English Heritage and which has been blocked up for safety; at Boden Vean near Manaccan and at Lower Boscaswell close to Pendeen.

Evidence of possible former fogous can be found at Porthmeor; at Higher Bodinar; at Castallack and at Treveneague. Another was found during rescue excavations at Penhale Round on the A30, the most easterly example, but this has since been destroyed.

<text>&quot;The Purple Testament&quot; is the nineteenth episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It is &quot;the story of a man who can forecast death&quot;. It originally aired on February 12, 1960, on CBS.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
William Fitzgerald (&quot;Fitz&quot;), a lieutenant serving in World War II, suddenly gains the mysterious ability to see who is about to die via a strange glow on the person&#x27;s face. After correctly predicting several deaths, he tells his friend Captain Riker what he is able to see, but the Captain does not know whether to believe him. Riker consults with a doctor, Captain Gunther, who thinks it may be wise to conduct a few tests on the lieutenant. While Riker and Gunther are discussing this, Fitz is in the same hospital visiting one of his men, Smitty, who is supposed to pull through. But he sees the strange light on the soldier&#x27;s face and knows his fate. After his premonition comes true, Fitz makes a scene in the hospital in front of Captains Gunther and Riker.

Back in camp, after Riker lays out plans for the next mission, Fitz reveals that he has seen the light on the captain&#x27;s face. Though Riker insists it means nothing, that the two of them will share a drink after they return from battle, he nonetheless leaves behind some of his personal possessions - a few photographs and his wedding ring - before he goes into combat. In the camp, the men argue about the rumors of the lieutenant&#x27;s predictions, but Riker tells all the soldiers there that there are no &quot;mind readers&quot; in the camp. Fitz, seeing the men&#x27;s faces and realizing he could cause mutiny (and that none of them are fated to die), agrees with the captain.

In the ensuing battle, all return except for Riker, who is killed by a sniper. Captain Gunther brings news to Fitz that he is being sent back to division headquarters for some much needed rest, but as the lieutenant gathers his gear, he catches his reflection in a mirror and sees the light on his own face. After this, Fitz becomes distant, as if resigned to fate.

A jeep driver comes to pick Fitz up. The sergeant sends the two off, telling the driver to be careful as they go; Fitz then sees the light on the face of the jeep driver. They have not completely checked the area for land mines on the road ahead. As the soldiers are gathered around the camp at dusk, the sound of an explosion is heard in the distance.

==Closing narration==
(In fact, the quotation is from &quot;Richard II&quot;, not &quot;Richard III&quot;.)

==Production notes==
Dean Stockwell was originally cast in the lead role but was unable to appear. He would later star in the similarly themed episode &quot;A Quality of Mercy&quot;. The concept of seeing a light on the face of those who are about to die was readdressed in &quot;Into the Light&quot;, an episode of the 2002 revival series. This is one of several episodes from the first season with its opening title sequence plastered over with the opening for the second season. This was done during the summer of 1961 as to help the season one shows fit in with the new look the show had taken during the following season.

Rod Serling quotes the Shakespearean source of the episode title in his closing narration: &quot;He is come to open the purple testament of bleeding war.&quot; He claims the quote is from &quot;Richard III&quot;, but it actually comes from &quot;Richard II&quot;.

==Broadcast date controversy==
On the same day as the screening of the episode, director Richard Bare and William Reynolds, then filming the TV series &quot;The Islanders&quot;, were in a plane crash, with one person on board the plane being killed in the crash. Reynolds claimed Rod Serling pulled the episode from its scheduled screening date, out of concern for the families of Reynolds and Bare. In his exhaustively researched 2008 book &quot;The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic&quot;, Martin Grams concludes that the episode did indeed air as originally scheduled on February 12, 1960, despite Reynolds&#x27; statements.

<doc id="145523" wikidata="Q378560" url="?curid=145523" title="List of kings of the Picts">
<text>The list of kings of the [[Picts]] is based on the Pictish Chronicle king lists. These are late documents and do not record the dates when the kings reigned. The various surviving lists disagree in places as to the names of kings, and the lengths of their reigns. A large portion of the lists, not reproduced here, belongs with the Caledonian or Irish mythology. The latter parts of the lists can largely be reconciled with other sources.

== Pictish kings ==
Pictish kings ruled in northern and eastern Scotland. In 843 tradition records the replacement of the Pictish kingdom by the Kingdom of Alba, although the Irish annals continue to use &quot;Picts&quot; and &quot;Fortriu&quot; for half a century after 843. The king lists are thought to have been compiled in the early 8th century, probably by 724, placing them in the reigns of the sons of Der-Ilei, Bridei and Nechtan.

Irish annals (the Annals of Ulster, Annals of Innisfallen) refer to some kings as &quot;king of Fortriu&quot; or &quot;king of Alba&quot;. The kings listed are thought to represent overkings of the Picts, at least from the time of Bridei son of Maelchon onwards. In addition to these overkings, many less powerful subject kings existed, of whom only a very few are known from the historical record.

Mythical kings of the Picts are listed in the &quot;Lebor Bretnach&quot;&#x27;s account of the origins of the Cruithne. The list begins with Cruithne son of Cing, who is reported to be &quot;father of the Picts&quot;. The account of the &quot;Pictish Chronicle&quot; then splits into four lists of names:
* The first is a list of the sons of Cruithne;
* The second is a list of early kings with no distinguishing information other than dates;
* The third is another list of early kings with neither stories nor dates, all of whom have two names that begin with &quot;Brude&quot;. It is possible that &quot;Brude&quot; is an ancient title for &quot;king&quot; from another source, which was misinterpreted as a name by the compiler (cf. Skene p.cv);
* The fourth is a list of later kings. The first of these to be attested in an independent source is Galam Cennalath.

The dates given here are drawn from early sources unless specifically noted otherwise. The relationships between kings are less than certain and rely on modern readings of the sources.

== Names ==
Orthography is problematic. Cinioch, Ciniod and Cináed all represent ancestors of the modern Anglicised name Kenneth. Pictish &quot;uu&quot;, sometimes printed as &quot;w&quot;, corresponds with Gaelic &quot;f&quot;, so that Uuredach is the Gaelic Feredach and Uurguist the Gaelic Fergus, or perhaps Forgus. As the Dupplin Cross inscription shows, the idea that Irish sources Gaelicised Pictish names may not be entirely accurate.

== Kings of the Picts ==
Colouring indicates groups of kings presumed to be related.

=== Early kings ===
=== Early historical kings ===
The first king who appears in multiple early sources is Bridei son of Maelchon, and kings from the later 6th century onwards may be considered historical as their deaths are generally reported in Irish sources.

=== Later historical kings ===
=== Kings of the Picts 839–848 (not successively) ===
The deaths of Eógan and Bran appear to have led to a large number of competitors for the throne of Pictland.

=== Kings of the Picts traditionally counted as King of Scots ===
Cináed mac Ailpín (Kenneth MacAlpin in English) defeated the rival kings, winning out by around 845–848. He is traditionally considered the first &quot;King of Scots&quot;, or of &quot;Picts and Scots&quot;, allegedly having conquered the Picts as a Gael, which is turning history back to front. As most modern scholars point out, he was actually &quot;King of Picts&quot;, and the terms &quot;King of Alba&quot; and the even later &quot;King of Scots&quot; were not used until several generations after him.

=== King of Alba ===

<text>&quot;Elegy&quot; is the twentieth episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on February 19, 1960, on CBS. The episode was based on a short story by Charles Beaumont published in the February 1953 issue of &quot;Imagination: Stories of Science and Fantasy&quot;.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
In September 2185, while on a routine geological mission, astronauts Meyers, Webber, and Kirby land their spaceship on a remote asteroid 655 million miles away from Earth after running low on fuel. They find that the atmosphere and gravity are identical to Earth&#x27;s. Opening the hatch to the spaceship, they find they have landed near a farm. They initially think they have traveled back in time, due to the old tractor they find, although they notice that there are two suns in the sky. They find a farmer gazing off into the distance and try to get his attention, but realize he is just a statue.

They hear band music in the distance, and follow it to a town to find the music is being played on a speaker; the band members are also just statues. The astronauts are disturbed by their surroundings as everything and everyone is eerily motionless. They hypothesize that time may pass at a different rate, but a nearby grandfather clock without hands leads them to believe that time passes normally and that there is some other reason for everyone&#x27;s motionlessness. They are further confused as the statues appear to feel like flesh, or something similar to it. They decide to split up to explore it. One astronaut finds an odd beauty contest where an unattractive woman has been crowned the winner. After the astronaut departs, a man in the audience turns and smiles.

Converging on the center of town, they are startled to find someone who does move: &quot;Jeremy Wickwire&quot;, the caretaker of this place. He is told by the men that a nuclear war destroyed much of the Earth in 1985, and that it has taken two hundred years to recover from it. Wickwire explains to the astronauts that the asteroid they have landed on is an exclusive cemetery called &quot;Happy Glades&quot;, founded in 1973, where rich people can live out their life&#x27;s greatest fantasy after they die. The town is one of many areas where people may be placed; others include the Roman era, the Egyptian era, and the Wild West. This town is the most popular because it represents a time in American culture where creature comforts were most abundant.

Wickwire serves the three men wine and asks each man what his greatest wish is. All three reply that they wish they were on their ship heading for home. Wickwire misunderstood who the astronauts were, thinking they were from the Happy Glades organization. He explains the reason Happy Glades exists is because it&#x27;s not possible to have peace on Earth. Wickwire (who explains that he is a robot that has been deactivated for &quot;about 200 years&quot; and only turns on for occasional duties) apologizes to them, and explains that it is his job to ensure peace and tranquility at &quot;Happy Glades&quot;. Suddenly, they realize that their drinks have been poisoned with what Wickwire refers to as &quot;eternifying fluid&quot;. As the men are dying, the astronaut pleads for an antidote, and that they mean no harm. Wickwire responds that they &quot;are men, and while there are men, there can be no peace.&quot;

Later, Wickwire re-installs the embalmed astronauts in their ship, posing them at their posts as if they were on their way home.

==Closing narration==
==Episode notes==
Inside the spaceship, &quot;equipment&quot; originally constructed for the film &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; was reused for this episode, and shows up in a number of other &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episodes. The sound effects heard inside the spaceship will be used again six years later as some of the sounds on the bridge of the starship USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series. The song played in the scene with the frozen marching band is &quot;Hot Time&quot; by the University of Wisconsin’s marching band. The set of the room of the frozen mayor addressing the crowd had been used in the previous episodes &quot;The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine&quot; as part of Barbara Trenton&#x27;s home, as well as in &quot;The Purple Testament&quot; as the lobby of an Army hospital. It would be used again as a hallway of a college campus in &quot;Long Live Walter Jameson&quot;. The scene with the couple dancing and the band playing ‘Fascination’ is a throwback to the movie &quot;Love in the Afternoon&quot; starring Gary Cooper and Audrey Hepburn.

<text>&quot;Mirror Image&quot; is the twenty-first episode of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It originally aired on February 26, 1960, on CBS.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Millicent Barnes waits in a bus depot in New York for a bus to Cortland, en route to a new job. Looking at a wall clock she notices the bus is late. She asks the ticket agent when the bus will arrive, and he gruffly complains that this is her third time asking. Millicent denies this. While speaking with him, she notices a bag just like hers on the floor behind the desk. She mentions this and the agent responds that it is her bag. She does not believe this until she notices her bag is not beside the bench anymore. She washes her hands in the restroom and the cleaning lady there insists this is her second time there. Again, Millicent denies this. Upon leaving the restroom, she glances in the mirror and sees, in addition to her reflection, an exact copy of herself sitting on the bench outside.

Millicent then meets a genial young man from Binghamton named Paul Grinstead, who is waiting for the same bus. Paul encourages Millicent to tell him what obviously is bothering her, so she explains about encountering her double. Attempting to calm her, Paul says it is either a joke or a misunderstanding caused by a look-alike. When the bus arrives and the two of them prepare to board, Millicent happens to look up at the windows and sees the copy of herself, already seated on the bus with a malevolent look on her face. In shock, Millicent runs back into the depot and faints.

Millicent lies unconscious on a bench inside the depot while Paul and the cleaning lady attend to her. Paul decides to wait for the 7:00 a.m. bus. While they wait, Millicent, now coming to, insists the strange events are caused by an evil double from a parallel world a nearby, yet distant alternative plane of existence that comes into convergence with this world as a result of powerful forces, or unnatural, unknown events. When these events occur, the impostors enter this realm. Millicent&#x27;s doppelgänger can survive in this world only by eliminating and replacing her. Paul says the explanation is &quot;a little metaphysical&quot; for him, and believes that Millicent&#x27;s sanity is beginning to unravel. Paul tells Millicent he will call a friend in Tully who has a car and may be able to drive them to Syracuse. Instead, he calls the police.

After Millicent is taken away by two policemen, Paul settles down. After drinking from a water fountain, Paul notices that his valise is now missing. Looking up toward the doors, Paul notices another man running out the door of the bus depot. Pursuing this individual down the street, Paul discovers that he is chasing his own copy, whose face shows a malevolent delight. His copy disappears as Paul calls out &quot;Where are you?&quot; while looking around in confusion and shock.

==Closing narration==
==Episode notes==
In a short film pitching the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; series to a Dutch television station, creator Rod Serling claimed to have gotten the idea for &quot;Mirror Image&quot; following an encounter at an airport. Serling noticed a man at the other side of the terminal who wore the same clothes and carried the same suitcase as himself; Serling considered what would happen if the man turned around and was revealed to be a duplicate of himself. However, the man turned out to be younger and &quot;more attractive&quot;. This episode is one of several episodes from season one with its opening title sequence plastered over with the opening for season two. This was done during the summer of 1961 to help the season one shows blend in with the new look the show would take during the following season.

This episode inspired Jordan Peele&#x27;s 2019 film &quot;Us&quot;.

<doc id="145527" wikidata="Q696105" url="?curid=145527" title="Soju">
<text>Soju (English pronunciation: ; ) is a clear and colorless distilled alcoholic beverage, traditionally made from rice, but later from other grains and has a flavor similar to vodka. It is usually consumed neat. Its alcohol content varies from about 12.5% to 53% alcohol by volume (ABV), although since 2007 low alcohol soju below 20% has become more popular.

Traditionally, most brands of are produced in the Andong region, but also in other regions and countries. While was traditionally made from rice, South Korean ethanol producers replace rice with other starch, such as cassava due to significantly lower capital costs. Soju often appears similar to several other East Asian liquors while differing in alcohol contents.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Soju&quot; () means &quot;burned liquor&quot;, with the first syllable, &quot;so&quot; (; 燒; &quot;burn&quot;), referring to the heat of distillation and the second syllable, &quot;ju&quot; (; 酒), meaning &quot;alcoholic drink&quot;. Etymological dictionaries record that China&#x27;s shaozhou (shāojiǔ, 烧酒), Japan&#x27;s shochu (shōchū, 焼酎), and Korea&#x27;s soju (soju, 燒酒) have the same etymology. In 2008, &quot;soju&quot; was included in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Merriam-Webster dated the word&#x27;s appearance in the American English lexicon at 1951. In 2016, the word was included in the Oxford Dictionary of English.

Another name for soju is &quot;noju&quot; (; &quot;dew liquor&quot;), with its first syllable, &quot;no/ro&quot; (/; 露; &quot;dew&quot;), likening the droplets of the collected alcohol during the distilling process to dewdrops. Some soju brand names include &quot;iseul&quot; (), the native-Korean word for &quot;dew&quot;, or &quot;no/ro&quot; (), the Sino-Korean word for &quot;dew&quot;.

Soju is sometimes mistakenly referred to as &quot;cheongju&quot; (), a Korean rice wine. Mass-produced soju is also mistaken for Chinese &quot;baijiu&quot;, a grain liquor, and &quot;shōchū&quot;, a Japanese liquor.

== History and production ==


The origin of soju dates back to 13th-century Goryeo. The Yuan Mongols acquired the technique of distilling &quot;arak&quot; from the Persians during their invasions of the Levant, Anatolia, and Persia, and in turn introduced it to the Korean Peninsula during the Mongol invasions of Korea (1231–1259). Distilleries were set up around the city of Gaegyeong, the then-capital (current Kaesong). In the areas surrounding Kaesong, soju is still called &quot;arak-ju&quot; (). &quot;Andong&quot; soju, the direct root of modern South Korean soju varieties, started as the home-brewed liquor developed in the city of Andong, where the Yuan Mongols&#x27; logistics base was located during this era.

Soju is traditionally made by distilling alcohol from fermented rice. The rice wine for distilled soju is usually fermented for about 15 days, and the distillation process involves boiling the filtered, mature rice wine in a &quot;sot&quot; (cauldron) topped with &quot;soju gori&quot; (a two-story distilling appliance with a pipe). In the 1920s, over 3,200 soju breweries existed throughout the Korean Peninsula.

Soju was traditionally a beverage distilled from rice with 35% ABV until 1965, when diluted soju with 30% ABV made from other fermented substances appeared with South Korean government&#x27;s prohibition of the traditional distillation of soju from rice, in order to alleviate rice shortages. Soju was then made from ethanol distilled to 95% ABV from sweet potatoes and tapioca, which was mixed with flavorings, sweeteners, and water. The end products are marketed under a variety of soju brand names. A single supplier (Korea Ethanol Supplies Company) sells ethanol to all soju producers in South Korea. Until the late 1980s, saccharin was the most popular sweetener used by the industry, but it has since been replaced by stevioside. The use of other grains and starches led different sojus to have different aroma and flavour.

During the 1970s, the national government started to monopolize the soju industries. By the 1970s there were about 300 domestic soju companies. In 1973, the Korean government began to consolidate various local soju producers. Each province was designated one soju producer per regional market. Each producer was to create a brand of soju that represented its region. By the end of the consolidation, a producer existed for each of the provinces. The government then passed two policies. The first was a mandatory local soju purchase policy. The policy required each provincial alcohol wholesaler to purchase more than 50 percent of their soju from within their own province. The second was the input allocation policy. This policy gave the government the responsibility to administer ethanol spirit, the main ingredient in soju. Each soju company was designated an amount based on their national market share in the previous year. These policies were created with the intention of protecting local firms and discouraging excessive competition.

This decision by the government advanced the efficient control of tax revenue. As a result of this consolidation, a few companies began to dominate the market. one firm, HiteJinro, accounts for almost half of the market while 4 smaller companies accounts for another 40 percent.

Due to the protection by the government&#x27;s policies, local firms took the majority of market share in their regional markets. In the 1980s and 1990s, there was a trade liberalization trend which led the Korean government to begin deregulating the soju industry. The government lifted its restrictions on new licenses for alcohol distribution in January 1991. It also lifted restrictions on soju production in March 1993. Various restrictions on the production of soju were also removed or weakened. The government also abolished the mandatory local soju purchase policy in January 1992.

Between 1993 and 1995, HiteJinro&#x27;s market share in regional markets outside its own increased and local companies saw a steady decline. As a result of this loss in market share, local soju companies lobbied to reintroduce the protection policies that had been removed. In response, the National Assembly of South Korea reintroduced the mandatory local soju purchase policy in October 1995. However, the case was challenged and the case was eventually decided by the Supreme Court of Korea that the policy was unconstitutional and abolished it in December 1996.

Soju alcohol content has trended downward from the 1970s onward. The ABV of 30% fell to 25% by 1973, and 23% by 1998. Currently, soju with less than 17% ABV are widely available. In 2017, a typical bottle of diluted soju retails at ₩1,700 (approximately $) in supermarkets and convenience stores, and for ₩4,000–5,000 (approximately $–) in restaurants.

Several regions have resumed distilling soju from grains since 1999. Traditional hand-crafted &quot;Andong soju&quot; has about 45% ABV. Hwayo () is a brand with five different mixes constituting an ABV range from 17% to 53%.

In 2019, &quot;Jinro soju&quot; was the largest selling branded spirit in the world. Fruit &quot;sojus&quot; have been produced since 2015.

== Etiquette==
The most important rule in Korean drinking etiquette is that the youngest person in the group pours the drinks for their elders. It applies not only to age but also to the hierarchy within a company. When pouring alcohol, both hands should be used to pour. When receiving alcohol, both hands should also be used to hold the glass. It is considered rude to pour yourself a drink.

== Bottles and recycling ==

Soju is a popular Korean alcoholic beverage, with over 917 million liters being sold in Korea. In 1994 Doosan Beverage started using green 360ml bottles to associate Soju with being clean and fresh; being a great success, other brands started using the same bottles.

In 2009 seven soju companies made a voluntary agreement to start manufacturing soju in the same sized green bottle with the same design, these bottles can then be sold back to and reused by soju manufacturers. While the program was voluntary, it was beneficial to the companies producing soju by saving 88 won per bottle. While this simple idea allowed multiple companies to recycle the same bottle, increasing their savings while benefiting the environment, consumer participation needed to be improved. In 2015 South Korea revised an act that promoted recycling and it was found that the return of soju bottles increased significantly. The system was further improved in 2016, and the deposit was increased in 2017; in 2018 the recovery rate of soju bottles was 97.2% compared to 87.9% in 2015.

The return of recyclable materials is driven by South Korea&#x27;s Beverage Container Deposit System. This system imposes a deposit on recyclable containers that is included in the sale price and refunded upon return. South Korea is recognized as a leading country when it comes to recycling, with Yale&#x27;s Center for Environmental Law and Policy ranking South Korea as number one with an environmental performance index score of 67.1/100. South Korea attributes their success to volume-based fees for waste management. With this system households purchase government-issued trash bags while recyclables are separated and collected for free. Local governments set the price of these bags based on volume and are adjusted to reflect the cost of the waste management process.

Some companies started producing different colored bottles in 2019. According to the Korea Times, Soju manufacturing companies Hite and Muhak introduced non-standard bottles. This created a dispute between companies with claims that sorting out non standard bottles was costly. This has resulted in a new agreement where companies can trade non-standard bottles for the standard green ones with each other.

== Soju outside Korea ==
===China===
There are a number of soju brands directly outside the Korean Peninsula for the ethnic Korean population, and most use rice as the foundation since the price is significantly cheaper than in South Korea. Soju from South Korea, from firms like Jinro, is also imported.

===Canada===
Liquors in Canada are subject to regulations that vary from province to province. In Ontario, the provincially run Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) sells soju, but not all LCBO locations carry it. However, since the LCBO introduced online ordering in 2016, soju can be ordered for home delivery anywhere in the province.

===United States===
The liquor licensing laws in the states of California and New York specifically exempt the sale of soju of up to 25% alcohol from regulation relating to the sale of other distilled spirits, allowing businesses with a beer/wine license to sell it without requiring the more expensive license required for other distilled spirits. The soju must contain less than 25% alcohol, and be clearly labeled.

This has led to the appearance in the United States of many soju-based equivalents of traditional Western mixed drinks normally based on vodka or similar spirits, such as the soju martini and the soju cosmopolitan. Another consequence is that the manufacturers of similar distilled spirits from other parts of Asia, such as Japanese shōchū, have begun to re-label their products as soju for sale in those regions.

Jinro&#x27;s American division partnered with Korean pop star PSY to promote soju in the U.S., and in 2013 partnered with the Los Angeles Dodgers to sell soju at its games.

==Brands==
Jinro is the largest manufacturer of soju, accounting for half of all white spirits sold in South Korea. Soju accounts for 97% of the category. Global sales in 2013 were 750 million bottles. The most popular variety of soju is currently Chamisul (참이슬 - literally meaning &quot;real dew&quot;), a quadruple-filtered soju produced by Jinro, but recently &quot;Cheoeum-Cheoreom&quot; (처음처럼, lit. &quot;like the first time&quot;) of Lotte Chilsung () and Good Day () of Muhak () are increasing their market share. However, the popularity of brands varies by region. In Busan, Shiwon Soju (시원 소주-&quot;refreshing soju&quot;) is the local and most popular brand. Yipseju (잎새주 - &quot;Leaf Soju&quot;/&quot;Maple Soju&quot;) is popular in the South Jeolla Province region. The Daegu Metropolitan Area has its own soju manufacturer, Kumbokju, with the popular brand Cham (). Further north in the same province, Andong Soju is one of Korea&#x27;s few remaining traditionally distilled brands of soju. On the Special Self-Governing Province of Jeju Province, Hallasan Soju is the most common brand, being named after the island&#x27;s main mountain Mt. Halla. Also, there is pureun-bam (푸른 밤/meaning: blue night) made by Jeju-soju. In South Gyeongsang Province and Ulsan, the most popular is Good Day (), produced by Muhak in Changwon. However, as soon as one crosses the border from Ulsan north to Gyeongju in North Gyeongsang Province, it is almost impossible to buy White Soju, and the most popular brands are Chamisul and Cham. Since 2015, the new trends of soju include fruit soju and sparkling soju, which have become increasingly popular in Korea, especially for young people. Sae-ro, a sugar-free soju, is also popular among young people.

New American producers are entering the market. Some, like Tokki Soju and West 32 Soju, with initial market penetration in major markets like New York, are finding critical success. Tokki Soju won double gold for their barrel-aged soju, Tokki Soju Gold, in the San Francisco Spirits Competition 2021 and 2022. West 32 Soju won a gold medal at the 2017 New York International Spirits Competition.

A new all natural soju distilled in Germany called ISAE is also entering the premium soju market. It is distilled according to the German Purity Law (the Reinheitsgebot) for grain spirits of 1789 and uses 100% regional winter wheat and organic rice.

Recently, soju has been produced for the younger generation. It mainly contains fruit flavor and produces and sells soju with low frequency.

==Consumption==
Although beer, whiskey, and wine have been gaining popularity in recent years, soju remains one of the most popular alcoholic beverages in Korea because of its ready availability and relatively low price. More than 3 billion bottles were consumed in South Korea in 2004. In 2006, it was estimated that the average adult Korean (older than 20) had consumed 90 bottles of soju during that year. In 2014, it was reported that South Koreans of drinking age consumed an average of 13.7 shots of spirit per week, the highest per capita consumption of alcoholic spirits of any country. However, due to the lower concentration of alcohol in soju compared to other hard spirits and the lack of an international standard for the volume of a shot, this does not necessarily imply a larger consumption of alcohol from hard spirits.

===Cocktails===
While soju is traditionally consumed straight, a few cocktails and mixed drinks use soju as a base spirit. Beer and soju can be mixed to create &quot;somaek&quot; (), a portmanteau of the words soju and maekju (맥주 beer). Flavored soju is also available. It is also popular to blend fruits with soju and to drink it in &quot;slushy&quot; form. Another very popular flavored soju is yogurt soju (), which is a combination of soju, yogurt, and lemon lime soda.

A &quot;poktan-ju&quot; () (&quot;bomb drink&quot;) consists of a shot glass of soju dropped into a pint of beer (similar to a boilermaker); it is drunk quickly. This is similar to the Japanese sake bomb.

<doc id="145530" wikidata="Q2633816" url="?curid=145530" title="The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street">
<text>&quot;The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street&quot; is the 22nd episode in the first season of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. The episode was written by Rod Serling, the creator-narrator of the series. It originally aired on March 4, 1960, on CBS. In 2009, &quot;TIME&quot; named it one of the ten best &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episodes.

==Opening narration==
The narration continues after the neighbors wonder if what flew overhead was a meteor.

==Plot==

One late-summer afternoon, Maple Street is full of children playing and adults talking and doing yard work, when a shadow passes over, accompanied by a roar and a flash of light. Everyone notices, but they assume it is a passing meteor and resume their activities. The residents soon discover that their power went off, affecting stoves, lawnmowers, cars, phones, even portable radios, and they gather in the street to discuss the situation. Pete Van Horn volunteers to walk over to Floral Street, to see if it is affected. His neighbors, Steve Brand and Charlie Farnsworth, decide to go into town to investigate further, but Tommy, a neighborhood boy, urges them not to go. Tommy has read a story of an alien invasion causing similar issues, and says that the monsters do not want anyone to leave the street. Tommy adds that in the story, the aliens are living as a family that appears to be human but are actually scouts, and the power outage they cause is to isolate the neighborhood. The adults are incredulous, assuring him that the cause is natural.

Another resident, Les Goodman, tries unsuccessfully to start his car. However, after he walks away from the car, it starts by itself. This makes the neighbors suspect that Les may be an alien. As they all gather, one woman brings up Les&#x27; late nights spent standing in the garden looking at the sky, as if waiting or looking for something. Les, defending himself as a resident of Maple Street for five years, claims to suffer from insomnia and admonishes his neighbors that they should use caution and not panic. Steve tries to defuse the situation and prevent it from becoming a witch-hunt, but tensions remain high.

As darkness descends, Charlie begins keeping watch over Les Goodman&#x27;s house. Steve suggests Charlie go home to bed. Another neighbor, Don, mentions that Steve has built his own radio set, which Charlie then claims no one has ever seen. As suspicion mounts, Steve&#x27;s wife protests that it is a simple ham radio, but Steve sarcastically answers that he talks to aliens with it. Steve and the other neighbors continue to argue, using each person&#x27;s idiosyncrasies as evidence that they are an alien. Steve warns that such behavior, looking for a scapegoat, is the surest way for the entire neighborhood to &quot;eat each other up alive&quot;.

A shadowy figure approaches the residents, which Tommy exclaims is the monster. Claiming it may be necessary for protection, Don obtains a double-barrelled shotgun that Steve immediately confiscates. As the figure gets closer, Charlie panics, taking the shotgun and shooting the figure. Upon reaching the fallen figure, they realize it is Pete Van Horn (who had gone to see if Floral Street had power earlier), and he is now dead. As Charlie struggles to defend his hasty action, the lights in his house come on by themselves, causing the residents to turn on him. Don suspiciously asks Charlie why his power is restored, while Les rebukes him for being so quick to kill and accuse, suggesting that perhaps Pete had found proof of Charlie&#x27;s extraterrestrial origins, and that the latter shot the former to silence him. Even Steve does not advocate for Charlie, outraged by his senseless murder of Pete. Charlie makes a break for his house; everyone chases him, throwing stones, one of which smashes a porch lantern, causing the broken glass to fly at Charlie&#x27;s face, cutting his forehead. Terrified, Charlie attempts to deflect suspicion onto Tommy. While his mother is quick to defend him, several neighbors agree with this idea, as Tommy was the only one who knew about the aliens&#x27; plans. Steve continues to try to defuse the situation, but no one listens.

Lights begin flashing on and off in houses throughout the neighborhood; lawnmowers and car engines start and stop for no reason. The mob becomes hysterical, hurling accusations, smashing windows, and taking up weapons as the situation devolves into an all-out riot.

Meanwhile, at a nearby hilltop, two humanoid aliens are observing the riot on Maple Street while using a device to manipulate the neighborhood&#x27;s power. They comment on how simply fiddling with routine leads people to descend into paranoia and panic that can be exploited. They also discuss their intention to use this strategy to conquer Earth, one neighborhood at a time. They then ascend a stairway into their spaceship, which then takes off.

==Closing narration==
==Production==
The aliens are wearing uniforms left over from the 1956 science fiction film &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;. Also, the mockup set of the retractable stairway, leading into the lower half of the C-57D cruiser from the same film, is reused for this scene. At the end of the episode, a stock footage effects-shot of the cruiser in space can be seen (the same shot was also used in &quot;Third from the Sun&quot;). This technique was also used in &quot;To Serve Man&quot;. The cruiser is shown upside down when compared to its orientation in &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;.

==2003 remake==
A 2003 remake of the episode was produced for the 2002 revival of &quot;The Twilight Zone,&quot; but it was renamed &quot;The Monsters Are on Maple Street&quot;. Serling received &quot;Story By&quot; credit. It starred Andrew McCarthy as Will Marshall and Titus Welliver as Dylan. The difference between the two is that the remake is more about the fear of terrorism. When the power surge happens in the remake, it is caused not by aliens, but instead by the government, specifically the United States Army, experimenting on how small towns react to the fear of terrorism. In the end, the neighborhood takes out its anger and frustration on a family who never left their house after the power surge occurred, thinking that they caused it since they still have power. The residents all fail the test miserably as did all the other inhabitants of every other street they tested.

The opening and closing narration, provided by Forest Whitaker, has also been altered:
With the closing narration being:
==Other media==
A radio dramatization of this episode was produced in the mid-2000s as part of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; radio series, starring Frank John Hughes as Steve Brand. It was included in &quot;The Twilight Zone: Radio Dramas – Collection 12&quot; collection.

A graphic novel version was published by the Savannah College of Art and Design partnered with Walker &amp; Co. A short-story version was published in &quot;Stories from The Twilight Zone&quot; and ends with a race of two-headed aliens moving into Maple Street.

The episode served as a major influence on science fiction in the decades that followed. Among the films that drew their inspiration from this episode include &quot;The Trigger Effect&quot;, directed by David Koepp, and &quot;The Mist&quot;, directed by Frank Darabont.
