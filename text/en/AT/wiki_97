<text>Domhnall Ua Buachalla (; ; 3 February 1866 – 30 October 1963) was an Irish politician and member of the First Dáil who served as third and final governor-general of the Irish Free State from 1932 to 1936, and later served as a member of the Council of State from 1959 until his death.

==Early life==

Ua Buachalla was born in Maynooth in County Kildare on 3 February 1866. His birth was registered as Daniel, the son of Cornelius Buckley, a shopkeeper, and Sarah Buckley, née Jacob. He married Sinéad Walsh in Dolphin&#x27;s Barn, Dublin on 3 June 1897. After his marriage, he and his family lived in Maynooth, where he ran a combined grocery, bicycle shop and pub in the town. He was an Irish language activist and member of Conradh na Gaeilge. In 1907, he was arrested and had his groceries seized when he refused to pay a fine for having his grocery wagon painted with &quot;Domhnall Ua Buachalla&quot; (his name in the Irish language), as British law required grocery wagons to be registered only in the English language.

==1916–1932==

He was a member of the Irish Volunteers and on the outbreak of the 1916 Easter Rising, he cycled the 26 kilometres to Dublin, found the Rising was on and returned to Maynooth, where he gathered his men, marched them to Dublin and fought in the GPO and as a sniper in outposts in the Exchange Hotel in Parliament Street and Arnott&#x27;s Henry Street; he was a crack shot. On the retreat from the GPO he was sent on a sortie and made it to the William and Woods factory but found it full of looters and left. He made it to the Broadstone railway station but was held there by British soldiers and sent to Richmond Barracks and from there to Knutsford Prison and then Frongoch internment camp in Wales. He was released a few days before Christmas 1916, and describes the prisoners getting a &quot;royal welcome&quot; on their return. Like many Rising survivors, he joined Sinn Féin, a small separatist party that was wrongly blamed by the British government for the Easter Rising. In the aftermath of the Rising, survivors led by Éamon de Valera took over the party in the struggle for the establishment of an Irish republic. Ua Buachalla was elected as a Sinn Féin MP for Kildare North at the 1918 general election. He served in the First Dáil (1918–1921), and was re-elected to the Second Dáil in 1921 as a Teachta Dála (TD) for Kildare–Wicklow. He sided with de Valera and opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty. He fought in the Four Courts in the Civil War. Imprisoned in Dundalk jail, he was released by the Anti-Treaty troops in August 1922. He lost his seat at the 1922 general election, and was an unsuccessful candidate at the 1923 general election.

==Irish governor-general==

He joined Fianna Fáil on its foundation in 1926 and was elected as a Fianna Fáil TD for the Kildare constituency at the June 1927 general election, only to lose that seat in the 1932 general election, which Fianna Fáil won. He was chosen by Éamon de Valera to become Governor-General of the Irish Free State following James McNeill&#x27;s resignation in November 1932.

==Instruction to keep a low profile==

De Valera explicitly instructed Ua Buachalla as Governor-General to keep a low public profile, and not to fulfil public engagements, which was part of de Valera&#x27;s policy to make the office an irrelevance by reducing it to invisibility. While he continued to give royal assent to legislation, summon and dissolve Dáil Éireann and fulfil the other formal duties of the office, he declined all public invitations and kept himself invisible, as advised by his Government. In fact in his period in office he performed only one public function: the receipt of the credentials of the French Ambassador to Ireland in the Council Chamber, Government Buildings, 1933, on behalf of King George V. However, de Valera subsequently had that duty moved from the Governor-General to his own post of President of the Executive Council;
instead of presenting his credentials to Ua Buachalla, the US Legation Minister, William Wallace McDowell, presented himself to de Valera.

One of the few other occasions Ua Buachalla was mentioned at all in public was when, in the aftermath of the death of King George V in January 1936, he had to reply to messages of condolence sent to the Irish people by United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the United States Secretary of State Cordell Hull.

On de Valera&#x27;s instruction, Ua Buachalla did not reside in the official residence of the Governor-General, the Viceregal Lodge (now called Áras an Uachtaráin, the residence of the President of Ireland). Instead, a house was rented for his use in Monkstown, outside of Dublin. The official English title &quot;Governor-General&quot; was largely replaced by the official Irish title &quot;Seanascal&quot; or its direct translation, &quot;Seneschal&quot;; however, &quot;Governor-General&quot; remained the legal form used in official English-language documents and proclamations. Ua Buachalla refused all but £2,000 of the £10,000 salary of the Governor-General.

==Falling out with de Valera==

Ua Buachalla fell out with de Valera over the manner of his exit from office, in December 1936. De Valera sought to use the abdication crisis surrounding King Edward VIII to amend the Irish Free State&#x27;s Constitution to abolish both the Crown and the office of governor-general. Having done so, he faced a threat of a court case from Ua Buachalla, who had been left personally liable for the remaining one year&#x27;s expensive private lease on his residence, following the sudden abolition of his office. In practice, between 1933 and December 1936, the Irish government had paid Ua Buachalla expenses, from which he paid the rent on the expensive residence which was picked for him.

However, from December 1936, the government insisted that it had no responsibility for paying for the residence. Ua Buachalla had, in 1932, on de Valera&#x27;s explicit advice, leased the residence for a full five years, which was his expected term of office. There remained one year&#x27;s outstanding lease, for a residence he could not now afford and for which he had no need now as he was no longer governor-general. Eventually, de Valera was forced to grant Ua Buachalla a large pension and to pay his outstanding rent and expenses to stop a potentially embarrassing court case going ahead. Ua Buachalla attended the inauguration of the first President of Ireland, Douglas Hyde, in Dublin Castle in June 1938.

==Appointment to Council of State and later life==

Ua Buachalla and de Valera reunited as political partners, and in a symbolic act of apology, de Valera, when elected President of Ireland in 1959 appointed Ua Buachalla to his advisory Council of State. However, he returned to Maynooth to continue running his family business, the hardware store which had been founded in 1853.

Domhnall Ua Buachalla died on 30 October 1963, aged 97, in a nursing home in Dublin. He was given a state funeral and buried in Laraghbryan Cemetery in Maynooth, with the graveside oration delivered by President de Valera.

The Ua Buachalla hardware store closed in October 2005. The road beside this store is named after him (although translated to English as &quot;Buckley&#x27;s Lane&quot;). The building has been demolished, but some of the frontage has been preserved, with the building bearing the name &quot;Buckley House&quot;.

<text>Claudette Colvin (born Claudette Austin; September 5, 1939) is an American pioneer of the 1950s civil rights movement and retired nurse aide. On March 2, 1955, she was arrested at the age of 15 in Montgomery, Alabama, for refusing to give up her seat to a white woman on a crowded, segregated bus. It occurred nine months before the similar, more widely known incident in which Rosa Parks, secretary of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), helped spark the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott.

Colvin was one of four plaintiffs in the first federal court case filed by civil rights attorney Fred Gray on February 1, 1956, as &quot;Browder v. Gayle&quot;, to challenge bus segregation in the city. In a United States district court, Colvin testified before the three-judge panel that heard the case. On June 13, 1956, the judges determined that the state and local laws requiring bus segregation in Alabama were unconstitutional. The case went to the United States Supreme Court on appeal by the state, which upheld the district court&#x27;s ruling on November 13, 1956. One month later, the Supreme Court affirmed the order to Montgomery and the state of Alabama to end bus segregation. The Montgomery bus boycott was then called off after a few months. The court subsequently declared all segregation on public transportation unconstitutional.

For many years, Montgomery&#x27;s black leaders did not publicize Colvin&#x27;s pioneering effort. She has said, &quot;Young people think Rosa Parks just sat down on a bus and ended segregation, but that wasn&#x27;t the case at all.&quot; Colvin&#x27;s case was dropped by civil rights campaigners because she was unmarried and pregnant during the proceedings. It is now widely accepted that she was not accredited by civil rights campaigners due to her circumstances. Rosa Parks said: &quot;If the white press got ahold of that information, they would have [had] a field day. They&#x27;d call her a bad girl, and her case wouldn&#x27;t have a chance.&quot;

In 2021, the record of Colvin&#x27;s arrest and adjudication of delinquency was expunged by the district court in the county where the charges against her had been brought more than 66 years earlier.

== Early life ==
Claudette Colvin was born Claudette Austin in Montgomery, Alabama, on September 5, 1939, to Mary Jane Gadson and C. P. Austin. When Austin abandoned the family, Gadson was unable to financially support her children. Colvin and her younger sister, Delphine, were taken in by their great aunt and uncle, Mary Anne and Q. P. Colvin, whose daughter, Velma, had already moved out. Colvin and her sister referred to the Colvins as their parents and took their last name. When they took Claudette in, the Colvins lived in Pine Level, a small country town in Montgomery County, the same town where Rosa Parks grew up. When Colvin was eight years old, the Colvins moved to King Hill, a poor black neighborhood in Montgomery where she spent the rest of her childhood.

Two days before Colvin&#x27;s 13th birthday, Delphine died of polio. Not long after, in September 1952, Colvin started attending Booker T. Washington High School. Despite being a good student, Colvin had difficulty connecting with her peers in school due to grief. She was also a member of the NAACP Youth Council, where she formed a close relationship with her mentor, Rosa Parks.

== Bus incident ==
In 1955, Colvin was a student at the segregated Booker T. Washington High School in the city. She relied on the city&#x27;s buses to get to and from school because her family did not own a car. The majority of customers on the bus system were African American, but they were discriminated against by its custom of segregated seating. Colvin was a member of the NAACP Youth Council and had been learning about the civil rights movement in school. On March 2, 1955, she was returning home from school when she boarded a Highland Gardens bus and sat down near an emergency exit in a middle row.

If the bus became so crowded that all the &quot;white seats&quot; in the front of the bus were filled until white people were standing, any African Americans were supposed to get up from nearby seats to make room for whites, move further to the back, and stand in the aisle if there were no free seats in that section. When a white woman who got on the bus was left standing in the front, the bus driver, Robert W. Cleere, commanded Colvin and three other black women in her row to move to the back. The other three moved, but another black woman, Ruth Hamilton, who was pregnant, got on and sat next to Colvin.

The driver looked at the women in his mirror. &quot;He asked us both to get up. [Mrs. Hamilton] said she was not going to get up and that she had paid her fare and that she didn&#x27;t feel like standing,&quot; recalls Colvin. &quot;So I told him I was not going to get up either. So he said, &#x27;If you are not going to get up, I will get a policeman.&#x27;&quot; The police arrived and convinced a black man sitting behind the two women to move so that Mrs. Hamilton could move back, but Colvin still refused to move. She was forcibly removed from the bus and arrested by the two policemen, Thomas J. Ward and Paul Headley. This event took place nine months before the NAACP secretary Rosa Parks was arrested for the same offense. Colvin later said: &quot;My mother told me to be quiet about what I did. She told me: &#x27;Let Rosa be the one. White people aren&#x27;t going to bother Rosa[,] her skin is lighter than yours and they like her.&quot; Colvin did not receive the same attention as Parks for a number of reasons: she did not have &quot;good hair&quot;, she was not fair-skinned, she was a teenager, and she was pregnant. The leaders in the Civil Rights Movement tried to keep up appearances and make the &quot;most appealing&quot; protesters the most seen.

When Colvin refused to get up, she was thinking about a school paper she had written that day about the local customs that prohibited blacks from using the dressing rooms in order to try on clothes in department stores. In a later interview, she said: &quot;We couldn&#x27;t try on clothes. You had to take a brown paper bag and draw a diagram of your foot ... and take it to the store&quot;. Referring to the segregation on the bus and the white woman, Colvin recalled, &quot;If she sat down in the same row as me, it meant I was as good as her&quot;.

&quot;The bus was getting crowded, and I remember the bus driver looking through the rearview mirror asking her [Colvin] to get up for the white woman, which she didn&#x27;t,&quot; said Annie Larkins Price, a classmate of Colvin. &quot;She had been yelling, &#x27;It&#x27;s my constitutional right!&#x27;. She decided on that day that she wasn&#x27;t going to move.&quot; Colvin recalled, &quot;History kept me stuck to my seat. I felt the hand of Harriet Tubman pushing down on one shoulder and Sojourner Truth pushing down on the other.&quot; Colvin was handcuffed, arrested, and forcibly removed from the bus. She shouted that her constitutional rights were being violated. Colvin said, &quot;But I made a personal statement, too, one that [Parks] didn&#x27;t make and probably couldn&#x27;t have made. Mine was the first cry for justice, and a loud one.&quot;

The police officers who took her to the station made sexual comments about her body and took turns guessing her bra size throughout the ride. After one officer jumped in the back seat of the police car, Colvin recalled, &quot;I put my knees together and crossed my hands over my lap and started praying.&quot; This made her very scared that they would sexually assault her because this happened frequently. Price testified for Colvin, who was tried in juvenile court. Colvin was initially charged with disturbing the peace, violating the segregation laws, and battering and assaulting a police officer. &quot;There was no assault&quot;, Price said.

A group of black civil rights leaders including Martin Luther King Jr. was organized to discuss Colvin&#x27;s arrest with the police commissioner. She was bailed out by her minister, who told her that she had brought the revolution to Montgomery.

Through the trial Colvin was represented by Fred Gray, a lawyer for the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA), which was organizing civil rights actions. She was convicted on all three charges in juvenile court. When Colvin&#x27;s case was appealed to the Montgomery Circuit Court on May 6, 1955, the charges of disturbing the peace and violating the segregation laws were dropped, although her conviction for assaulting a police officer was upheld.

Colvin&#x27;s moment of activism was not solitary or random. In high school, she had high ambitions of political activity. She dreamed of becoming the President of the United States. Her political inclination was fueled in part by an incident with her schoolmate, Jeremiah Reeves; his case was the first time that she had witnessed the work of the NAACP. Reeves was found having sexual intercourse 
with a white woman who claimed she was raped, though Reeves claims their relations were consensual. He was executed for his alleged crimes.

==&quot;Browder v. Gayle&quot;==

Together with Aurelia S. Browder, Susie McDonald, Mary Louise Smith, and Jeanetta Reese, Colvin was one of the five plaintiffs in the court case of &quot;Browder v. Gayle&quot;. Jeanetta Reese later resigned from the case. The case, organized and filed in federal court by civil rights attorney Fred Gray, challenged city bus segregation in Montgomery as unconstitutional. During the court case, Colvin described her arrest: &quot;I kept saying, &#x27;He has no civil right... this is my constitutional right... you have no right to do this.&#x27; And I just kept blabbing things out, and I never stopped. That was worse than stealing, you know, talking back to a white person.&quot;

&quot;Browder v. Gayle&quot; made its way through the courts. On June 5, 1956, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama issued a ruling declaring the state of Alabama and Montgomery&#x27;s laws mandating public bus segregation as unconstitutional. State and local officials appealed the case to the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court summarily affirmed the District Court decision on November 13, 1956. One month later, the Supreme Court declined to reconsider, and on December 20, 1956, the court ordered Montgomery and the state of Alabama to end bus segregation permanently.

The Montgomery bus boycott was able to unify the people of Montgomery, regardless of educational background or class.

== Life after activism ==
Colvin gave birth to a son, Raymond, in March 1956. Colvin left Montgomery for New York City in 1958, because she had difficulty finding and keeping work following her participation in the federal court case that overturned bus segregation. Similarly, Rosa Parks left Montgomery for Detroit in 1957. Colvin stated she was branded a troublemaker by many in her community. She withdrew from college, and struggled in the local environment.

In New York, Colvin and her son Raymond initially lived with her older sister, Velma Colvin. In 1960, she gave birth to her second son, Randy. Claudette began a job in 1969 as a nurse&#x27;s aide in a nursing home in Manhattan. She worked there for 35 years, retiring in 2004. Raymond Colvin died in 1993 in New York of a heart attack at age 37. Her son Randy is an accountant in Atlanta and father of Colvin&#x27;s four grandchildren.

==Legacy==
Colvin was a predecessor to the Montgomery bus boycott movement of 1955, which gained national attention. But she rarely told her story after moving to New York City. The discussions in the black community began to focus on black enterprise rather than integration, although national civil rights legislation did not pass until 1964 and 1965. NPR&#x27;s Margot Adler has said that black organizations believed that Rosa Parks would be a better figure for a test case for integration because she was an adult, had a job, and had a middle-class appearance. They felt she had the maturity to handle being at the center of potential controversy.

Colvin was not the only woman of the Civil Rights Movement who was left out of the history books. In the south, male ministers made up the overwhelming majority of leaders. This was partially a product of the outward face the NAACP was trying to broadcast and partially a product of the women fearing losing their jobs, which were often in the public school system.

In 2005, Colvin told the &quot;Montgomery Advertiser&quot; that she would not have changed her decision to remain seated on the bus: &quot;I feel very, very proud of what I did,&quot; she said. &quot;I do feel like what I did was a spark and it caught on.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m not disappointed. Let the people know Rosa Parks was the right person for the boycott. But also let them know that the attorneys took four other women to the Supreme Court to challenge the law that led to the end of segregation.&quot;

On May 20, 2018, Congressman Joe Crowley honored Colvin for her lifetime commitment to public service with a Congressional Certificate and an American flag.

==Recognition==
Colvin has often said she is not angry that she did not get more recognition; rather, she is disappointed. She said she felt as if she was &quot;getting [her] Christmas in January rather than the 25th.&quot;

Colvin and her family have been fighting for recognition for her action. In 2016, the Smithsonian Institution and its National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) were challenged by Colvin and her family, who asked that Colvin be given a more prominent mention in the history of the civil rights movement. The NMAAHC has a section dedicated to Rosa Parks, which Colvin does not want taken away, but her family&#x27;s goal is to get the historical record right, and for officials to include Colvin&#x27;s part of history. Colvin was not invited officially for the formal dedication of the museum, which opened to the public in September 2016.

&quot;All we want is the truth, why does history fail to get it right?&quot; Colvin&#x27;s sister, Gloria Laster, said. &quot;Had it not been for Claudette Colvin, Aurelia Browder, Susie McDonald, and Mary Louise Smith, there may not have been a Thurgood Marshall, a Martin Luther King or a Rosa Parks.&quot;

In 2000, Troy University at Montgomery opened the Rosa Parks Museum in Montgomery to honor the town&#x27;s place in civil rights history. Roy White, who was in charge of most of the project, asked Colvin if she would like to appear in a video to tell her story, but Colvin refused. She said, &quot;They&#x27;ve already called it the Rosa Parks museum, so they&#x27;ve already made up their minds what the story is.&quot;

In 2010, the street Colvin lived on when she was a young girl was named Claudette Colvin Drive in her honor. It is located off Upper Wetumpka Road in Montgomery, Alabama.

Reverend Joseph Rembert has said, &quot;If nobody did anything for Claudette Colvin in the past why don&#x27;t we do something for her right now?&quot; He contacted Montgomery Councilmen Tracy Larkin (whose sister was on the bus in 1955 when Colvin was arrested) and Charles Jinright, and in 2017, the Council passed a resolution for a proclamation honoring Colvin. March 2 was named Claudette Colvin Day in Montgomery. Mayor Todd Strange presented the proclamation and, when speaking of Colvin, said, &quot;She was an early foot soldier in our civil rights, and we did not want this opportunity to go by without declaring March 2 as Claudette Colvin Day to thank her for her leadership in the modern day civil rights movement.&quot; Rembert said, &quot;I know people have heard her name before, but I just thought we should have a day to celebrate her.&quot; Colvin could not attend the proclamation due to health concerns.

In 2019, a statue of Rosa Parks was unveiled in Montgomery, Alabama, and four granite markers were also unveiled near the statue on the same day to honor the four plaintiffs in &quot;Browder v. Gayle&quot;, including Colvin.

In 2021, Colvin applied to the family court in Montgomery County, Alabama to have her juvenile record expunged. Daryl Bailey, the District Attorney for the county, supported her motion, stating: &quot;Her actions back in March of 1955 were conscientious, not criminal; inspired, not illegal; they should have led to praise and not prosecution&quot;. The judge ordered that the juvenile record be expunged and destroyed in December 2021, stating that Colvin&#x27;s refusal had &quot;been recognized as a courageous act on her behalf and on behalf of a community of affected people&quot;.

Also in 2021, a mural honoring Colvin was unveiled, along Claudette Colvin Drive, in Montgomery, Alabama.

== In culture ==

Former US Poet Laureate Rita Dove memorialized Colvin in her poem &quot;Claudette Colvin Goes To Work&quot;, published in her 1999 book &quot;On the Bus with Rosa Parks&quot;; folk singer John McCutcheon turned this poem into a song, which was first publicly performed in Charlottesville, Virginia&#x27;s Paramount Theater in 2006.

Young adult book &quot;Claudette Colvin: Twice Toward Justice&quot;, by Phillip Hoose, was published in 2009 and won the National Book Award for Young People&#x27;s Literature.

A re-enactment of Colvin&#x27;s resistance is portrayed in a 2014 episode of the comedy TV series &quot;Drunk History&quot; about Montgomery, Alabama. She was played by Mariah Iman Wilson.

In the second season (2013) of the HBO drama series &quot;The Newsroom&quot;, the lead character, Will McAvoy (played by Jeff Daniels), uses Colvin&#x27;s refusal to comply with segregation as an example of how &quot;one thing&quot; can change everything. He remarks that if the ACLU had used her act of civil disobedience, rather than that of Rosa Parks&#x27; eight months later, to highlight the injustice of segregation, a young preacher named Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. may never have attracted national attention, and America probably would not have had his voice for the Civil Rights Movement.

&quot;The Little-Known Heroes: Claudette Colvin&quot;, a children&#x27;s picture book by Kaushay and Spencer Ford, was published in 2021.

In 2022, a biopic of Colvin titled &quot;Spark&quot; written by Niceole R. Levy and directed by Anthony Mackie was announced.

<doc id="147394" wikidata="Q41894" url="?curid=147394" title="Battle of New Orleans">
<text>The Battle of New Orleans was fought on January 8, 1815, between the British Army under Major General Sir Edward Pakenham and the United States Army under Brevet Major General Andrew Jackson, roughly 5 miles (8 km) southeast of the French Quarter of New Orleans, in the current suburb of Chalmette, Louisiana. 

The battle was the climax of the five-month Gulf Campaign (September 1814 to February 1815) by Britain to try to take New Orleans, West Florida, and possibly Louisiana Territory which began at the First Battle of Fort Bowyer. Britain started the New Orleans campaign on December 14, 1814, at the Battle of Lake Borgne and numerous skirmishes and artillery duels happened in the weeks leading up to the final battle.

The battle took place 15 days after the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, which formally ended the War of 1812, on December 24, 1814, though it would not be ratified by the United States (and therefore did not take effect) until February 16, 1815, as news of the agreement had not yet reached the United States from Europe. Despite a British advantage in numbers, training, and experience, the American forces defeated a poorly executed assault in slightly more than 30 minutes. The Americans suffered 71 casualties, while the British suffered over 2,000, including the deaths of Pakenham and his second-in-command, Major General Samuel Gibbs.

==Background==
In August 1814, Britain and the United States began negotiations to end the War of 1812. The British Secretary of State for War and the Colonies Henry Bathurst issued Pakenham&#x27;s secret orders on October 24, 1814, commanding him to continue the war even if he heard rumors of peace. Bathurst expressed concern that the United States might not ratify a treaty and did not want Pakenham either to endanger his forces or miss an opportunity for victory. Prior to that, in August 1814, Vice Admiral Cochrane had convinced the Admiralty that a campaign against New Orleans would weaken American resolve against Canada and hasten a successful end to the war.

There was a major concern that the British and their Spanish allies wanted to reclaim the territories of the Louisiana Purchase because they did not recognize any land deals made by Napoleon (starting with the 1800 Spanish cession of Louisiana to France, followed by the 1804 French sale of Louisiana to the United States). This is why the British invaded New Orleans in the middle of the Treaty of Ghent negotiations. It has been theorized that if the British had won the Battle of New Orleans, they would have likely interpreted that all territories gained from the 1803 Louisiana Purchase would be void and not part of U.S. territory. There was great concern by the Americans that Britain would hold onto the territory indefinitely, but it is left unanswerable due to the outcome of the New Orleans battle. This is contradicted by the content of Bathurst&#x27;s correspondence, and disputed by Latimer, with specific reference to correspondence from the Prime Minister to the Foreign Secretary dated December 23, 1814.

==Opposing forces==
==Prelude==
===Lake Borgne===
A fleet of British ships had anchored in the Gulf of Mexico to the east of Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Borgne by December 14, 1814, under the command of Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane. An American flotilla of five gunboats, commanded by Lieutenant Thomas ap Catesby Jones, blocked British access to the lakes. On December 14, around 980 British sailors and Royal Marines under Captain Nicholas Lockyer set out to attack Jones&#x27;s force. Lockyer&#x27;s men sailed in 42 rowboats, almost all armed with a small carronade. Lockyer captured Jones&#x27;s vessels in a brief engagement. Casualties included 17 British sailors killed and 77 wounded, while 6 Americans were killed, 35 wounded, and the remaining crews captured. The wounded included both Jones and Lockyer.

One unintended consequence is that it is believed the gunboat crews in captivity were able to mislead the British as to Jackson&#x27;s strength in numbers, when they were questioned. There is a popular story concerning Purser Thomas Shields and Surgeon Robert Morrell, who were sent under a flag of truce to negotiate the return of the prisoners on parole. They were placed in a cabin where their conversation could be heard. Shields, having hearing difficulties, talked loudly and mentioned that 20,000 troops were under Jackson&#x27;s command. There was nothing in the actions of the British commanders to indicate they believed they were faced with superior numbers.

===Disembarkation by the British===
Sixteen hundred British soldiers under the command of General John Keane were rowed 60 miles west from Cat Island to Pea Island (possibly now Pearl Island), situated about east of New Orleans. It took six days and nights to ferry the troops, each transit taking around ten hours.

There were three potential routes to the east of the Mississippi that the British could take, in addition to traversing up the Mississippi itself. Rather than a slow approach to New Orleans up the Mississippi River, the British chose to advance on an overland route. The first route was to take the Rigolets passage into Lake Pontchartrain, and thence to disembark two miles north of the city. One hindrance was the fort at Petit Coquilles at the Rigolets passage.

The second option was to row to the Plain of Gentilly via the Bayou Chef Menteur, and to take the Chef Menteur Road that went from the Rigolets to the city. It was narrow, and could be easily blocked. Jackson was aware of this, and had it well guarded.

The third option was to head to Bayou Bienvenue, then Bayou Mazant and via the Villeré Canal to disembark at a point one mile from the Mississippi and seven miles south of the city. This latter option was taken by Keane.

Andrew Lambert notes that Keane squandered a passing opportunity to succeed, when he decided to not take the open road from the Rigolets to New Orleans by way of Bayou Chef Menteur. Reilly observes that there has been a general acceptance that Cochrane cajoled Keane into a premature and ill-advised attack, but there is no evidence to support this theory. Codrington&#x27;s correspondence does imply that the first option was intended to be followed by Cochrane, based upon inaccurate map details, as documented by Cochrane&#x27;s papers. The shallow waters of the narrow passes of the Rigolets and the Chef Menteur could not take any vessel drawing eight feet or more.

A further hindrance was the lack of shallow draft vessels, which Cochrane had requested, yet the Admiralty had refused. As a consequence, even when using all shallow boats, it was not possible to transport more than 2,000 men at a time.

===Villeré Plantation===

On the morning of December 23, Keane and a vanguard of 1,800 British soldiers reached the east bank of the Mississippi River, south of New Orleans. They could have attacked the city by advancing a few hours up the undefended river road, but Keane decided to encamp at Lacoste&#x27;s Plantation and wait for the arrival of reinforcements. The British invaded the home of Major Gabriel Villeré, but he escaped through a window and hastened to warn General Jackson of the approaching army and the position of their encampment.
==Commencement of battle==
===Jackson&#x27;s raid on the British camp===
Following Villeré&#x27;s intelligence report, on the evening of December 23, Jackson led 2,131 men in a brief three-pronged assault from the north on the unsuspecting British troops, who were resting in their camp. He then pulled his forces back to the Rodriguez Canal, about south of the city. The Americans suffered 24 killed, 115 wounded, and 74 missing, while the British reported their losses as 46 killed, 167 wounded, and 64 missing. The action was consequential, since at December 25 Pakenham&#x27;s forces now had an effective strength of 5,933 out of a headcount of 6,660 soldiers. Historian Robert Quimby states that the British won a &quot;tactical victory, which enabled them to maintain their position&quot;, but they &quot;were disabused of their expectation of an easy conquest&quot;. As a consequence, the Americans gained time to transform the canal into a heavily fortified earthwork.

===British reconnaissance-in-force===
On Christmas Day, General Edward Pakenham arrived on the battlefield. Two days later he received nine large naval artillery guns from Admiral Cochrane along with a hot shot furnace to silence the two U.S. Navy warships, the sloop-of-war and the schooner , that were harassing the army for 24 hours per day the past week from the Mississippi River. The &quot;Carolina&quot; was sunk in a massive explosion by the British, but the &quot;Louisiana&quot; survived thanks to the Baratarian pirates aboard getting into rowboats and tying the ship to the rowboats and rowing it further north away from the British artillery. The &quot;Louisiana&quot; was not able to sail northward under her own power due to the attack. These two vessels were now no longer a danger to the British, but Jackson ordered the ships&#x27; surviving guns and crew to be stationed on the west bank and provide covering fire for any British assault on the river road to Line Jackson (name of the U.S. defensive line at the Rodriguez Canal) and New Orleans. After silencing the two ships, Pakenham ordered a reconnaissance-in-force on December 28 against the earthworks. The reconnaissance-in-force was designed to test Line Jackson and see how well-defended it was, and if any section of the line was weak the British would take advantage of the situation, break through, and call for thousands of more soldiers to smash through the defenses. On the right side of this offensive the British soldiers successfully sent the militia defenders into a retreating panic with their huge show of force and were just a few hundred yards from breaching the defensive line, but the left side of the reconnaissance-in-force turned into disaster for the British. The surviving artillery guns from the two neutralized warships successfully defended the section of Line Jackson closest to the Mississippi River with enfilading fire, making it look like the British offensive completely failed even though on the section closest to the swamp the British were on the verge of breaking through. Pakenham inexplicably decided to withdraw all the soldiers after seeing the left side of his reconnaissance-in-force collapsing and retreating in panic. The British suffered 16 killed and 43 wounded and the Americans suffered 7 killed and 10 wounded. Luck saved Line Jackson on this day and this was the closest the British came during the whole campaign to defeating Jackson.

After the failure of this operation Pakenham met with General Keane and Admiral Cochrane that evening for an update on the situation. Pakenham wanted to use Chef Menteur Pass as the invasion route, but he was overruled by Admiral Cochrane, who insisted that his boats were providing everything needed. Admiral Cochrane believed that the veteran British soldiers would easily destroy Jackson&#x27;s ramshackle army, and he allegedly said that if the army did not do it, his sailors would, and the meeting settled the method and place of the attack.
When the British reconnaissance force withdrew, the Americans immediately began constructing earthworks to protect the artillery batteries, further strengthening Line Jackson. They installed eight batteries, which included one 32-pound gun, three 24-pounders, one 18-pounder, three 12-pounders, three 6-pounders, and a howitzer. Jackson also sent a detachment to the west bank of the Mississippi to man two 24-pounders and two 12-pounders on the grounded warship . Jackson in the first week of the New Orleans land campaign that began on December 23 also had the support of the warships in the Mississippi River, including USS &quot;Louisiana&quot;, USS &quot;Carolina&quot;, the schooner USS &quot;Eagle&quot;, and the steamboat . The naval warships were neutralized by the heavy naval artillery guns brought in by Pakenham and Cochrane a few days after Christmas. Major Thomas Hinds&#x27; Squadron of Light Dragoons, a militia unit from the Mississippi Territory, arrived at the battle on December 22.

===Artillery duel===

The main British army arrived on New Year&#x27;s Day 1815 and began an artillery bombardment of the American earthworks. Jackson&#x27;s headquarters, Macarty House, was fired at for the first 10 minutes of the skirmish while Jackson and his officers were eating breakfast. The house was completely destroyed but Jackson and the officers escaped harm. The Americans recovered quickly and mobilized their own artillery to fire back at the British artillery. This began an exchange of artillery fire that continued for three hours. Several of the American guns were silenced, including the 32-pounder, a 24-pounder, and a 12-pounder, while some damage was done to the earthworks. The British suffered even greater, losing 13 guns (five British batteries out of seven total batteries were silenced by the Americans). The remaining British artillery finally exhausted its ammunition, and Pakenham canceled the attack. Major General Gibbs during the artillery duel sent soldiers to try to outflank Line Jackson on the right due to the near-success of the December 28 skirmish. A combined force of Tennessee militia and Choctaw warriors used heavy small arms fire to repel this maneuver. The Tennessee and Choctaw soldiers even moved forward in front of Line Jackson and counterattacked, guerrilla-style, to guarantee the British withdrawal. After yet another failure to breach Line Jackson Pakenham decided to wait for his entire force of 8,000 men to assemble before continuing his attack (the 40th Foot arrived too late, disembarking on 12 January 1815. The British lost 45 killed and 55 wounded in the artillery duel and the Americans lost 11 killed and 23 wounded.

==Battle==
The Americans had constructed three lines of defense, with the forward line four miles south of the city. It was strongly entrenched at the Rodriguez Canal, which stretched from a swamp to the river, with a timber, loop-holed breastwork and earthworks for artillery.

General Lambert and two infantry battalions totaling 1700 soldiers disembarked and reinforced the British on January 5. This brought the amount of disembarked men to about 8,000.

The British battle plan was for an attack against the 20-gun right bank battery, then to turn those guns on the American line to assist the frontal attack. Colonel William Thornton was to cross the Mississippi during the night with his force, move rapidly upriver, storm the battery commanded by Commodore Daniel Patterson on the flank of the main American entrenchments, and then open an enfilading fire on Jackson&#x27;s line with the captured artillery, directly across from the earthworks manned by the vast majority of the American troops.

On the other bank, Major General Samuel Gibbs was to lead the main assault against the center left by his (2nd) brigade. As a feint, a column of light infantry companies (from 4th, 21st Foot) led by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Rennie would march along the river. This would be &#x27;considered as belonging to&#x27; the (1st) Brigade commanded by General Keane. Keane&#x27;s men would move to either exploit the success along the river, or move against the center in support of Gibbs. The right flank, along the swamp, was to be protected by light infantry (detached from 7th, 43rd, 93rd Foot) commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Jones (of the 4th Foot). The (3rd) brigade commanded by Major General John Lambert was held in reserve.

Reilly notes that the advance columns of the brigades of Keane and Gibbs would be about 650 yards from the American lines. Given they would be in sight of, and in range of, the artillery, it was important to storm the ditch at first light.

The start of the battle was marked by the launch of a signal rocket at 6:20am, soon after followed by artillery fire from the British lines towards Jackson&#x27;s headquarters at the McCarty house.

===Right Bank===
The preparations of the British had not gone unnoticed. The Louisiana Militia brigade were reinforced by 200 Kentucky militiamen commanded by Colonel Davis. They arrived at 4am, after a five mile march through mud. Exhausted, they had not eaten since noon the prior day. Morgan deployed them between two positions, a mile apart.

The British dug a canal to enable 42 small boats to get to the river. Preparations for the attack had floundered early on January 8, as the canal collapsed and the dam failed, leaving the sailors to drag the boats through the mud with Thornton&#x27;s right bank assault force. This left the force starting off just before daybreak, eight hours late according to Thornton&#x27;s dispatch, assessed in 2008 to be 12 hours late. In the early morning of January 8, Pakenham gave his final orders for the two-pronged assault. The frontal attack was not postponed, however, as the British hoped that the force on the right bank would create a diversion, even if they did not succeed in the assault.

As a consequence of the sides of the canal caving in and choking the passage that night, only enough boats got through to carry 560 men, just one-third of the intended force. Captain Rowland Money led the Navy detachment, and Brevet Major Thomas Adair led the Marines. Money was captain of HMS &quot;Trave&quot;, and Adair was the commanding officer of &#x27;s detachment of Marines.Thornton did not make allowance for the current, and it carried him about a thousand yards below the intended landing place.

The only British success of the battle was the delayed attack on the right bank of the Mississippi River, where Thornton&#x27;s brigade of the 85th Regiment of Foot and detachments from the Royal Navy and Royal Marines attacked and overwhelmed the American line. The 700 militiamen were routed. Reilly felt the fault lay with Morgan, who had dispersed his troops, rather than concentrating most of them around his main defence, whilst deploying a picket, to give advance warning once the British arrived. The decision by General Morgan to deploy his troops in two positions a mile apart, neither defensible, was favorable for the British. Morgan&#x27;s mismanagement of his Kentucky and Louisiana militiamen was an open invitation to defeat. Whilst the retreat of the militia has been criticized, such a move was no less than prudent. An inquiry, overseen by Major General William Carroll of the Tennessee Militia, found that the conduct was &#x27;not reprehensible&#x27;. Major Paul Arnaud, commanding officer of the 2nd Louisiana militia brigade, was targeted as a scapegoat for the retreat on the Right Bank. His fellow Louisiana Militia officers Dejean, Cavallier and Declouet were admonished, as was Colonel John Davis of the Kentucky Militia.

At around 10 am, Lambert was made aware that the right bank had been taken, as signalled by a rocket launched by Gubbins. His brigade won their battle, but Thornton was badly wounded, and delegated his command to Gubbins. Army casualties among the 85th Foot were two dead, one captured, and 41 wounded, the battalion reduced to 270 effectives on the Right Bank. Royal Navy casualties were two dead, Captain Rowland Money and 18 seamen wounded. Royal Marine casualties were two dead, with three officers, one sergeant, and 12 other ranks wounded. By contrast, the defenders&#x27; casualties were two dead, eleven wounded and nineteen missing. Both Jackson and Commodore Patterson reported that the retreating forces had spiked their cannon, leaving no guns to turn on the Americans&#x27; main defense line; Major Michell&#x27;s diary, however, claims that he had &quot;commenced cleaning enemy&#x27;s guns to form a battery to enfilade their lines on the left bank&quot;.

General Lambert ordered his Chief of Artillery Colonel Alexander Dickson to assess the position. Dickson reported back that no fewer than 2,000 men would be required to hold the position. Lambert issued orders to withdraw after the defeat of their main army on the east bank and retreated, taking a few American prisoners and cannon with them. The Americans were so dismayed by the loss of this battery, which would be capable of inflicting much damage on their lines when the attack was renewed, that they were preparing to abandon the town when they received the news that the British were withdrawing, according to one British regimental historian. Reilly does not agree, but does note that Jackson was eager to send Humbert to take command of 400 men to retake the position from Thornton&#x27;s troops. Carson Ritchie goes as far to assert that &#x27;it was not Pakenham, but Sir Alexander Dickson who lost the third battle of New Orleans&#x27; in consequence of his recommendation to evacuate the Right Bank, and that &#x27;he could think of nothing but defense&#x27;.

This success, being described as &#x27;a brilliant exploit by the British, and a disgraceful exhibition [of General Morgan&#x27;s leadership] by the Americans,&#x27; had no effect on the outcome of the battle.

The positions were reoccupied on the 9th, and Patterson reestablished his battery on January 10.

===Left Bank===

====Preparation for the assault by the 44th Foot====
The 44th Regiment of Foot was assigned by General Edward Pakenham to be the advance guard for the first column of attack on 8 January 1815, and to carry the fascines and ladders which would enable the British troops to cross the ditch and scale the American ramparts. The commanding officer of the 44th, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Mullins had been commended twice during the Chesapeake campaign, and was recently promoted. He was noted as being haughty, and less than diligent in his duties as a staff officer in the days prior to the attack. Pakenham ordered Mullins to determine the locations of those fascines and ladders that evening of the 7th, in order that there would be no delays in retrieving them the following morning.

Gibbs also instructed him to confirm the locations of those fascines and ladders. Mullins delegated this to a subordinate, Johnston, who went to headquarters to do so. Whilst there, he was observed by General Gibbs, who enquired what he was doing. Upon being told, Gibbs wrote a formal order to Mullins that &#x27;The Commanding Officer of the 44th will ascertain where the fascines and Ladders are deposited this evening.&#x27; A map of where the items were stored was given to Johnston. Upon returning, he presented the map to Mullins, which he dismissively put in his waistcoat.

At 5 pm that evening, Mullins summoned his officers for a meeting, to discuss the attack. One of his subordinates questioned the location of the ladders, and received a caustic rebuke. He was approached by his Captain and hut-mate at 8 pm, and diplomatically suggested preparing for the next day, including the order from Gibbs to personally see where the items were stored. Mullins was dismissive, and stated there would be plenty of time in the morning. Pakenham sent an order to an engineer officer to communicate with Mullins as to where the items were stored, in the redoubt. Coincidentally, Mullins arrived in the presence of the engineer officer and the artillery officer. Upon being read Pakenham&#x27;s instructions, and being asked if he had any questions, Mullins replied that it was clear.

During the night, an &quot;advance battery&quot; was set up forward of the &quot;advance redoubt&quot;, a distance of about or , positioned south from Line Jackson. Mullins, thinking this to be the location of the materiel, passed the advance redoubt and halted the regiment at the battery. Upon discovering his mistake, he sent about 300 of his 427 men back to the redoubt at the double-quick to pick up the fascines and ladders, but it was too late. The other regiments were already advancing behind the 44th, the party of 300 lost formation as they struggled to reach the redoubt, and as day dawned, the attack commenced before the supplies could be brought forward.

====The attack on the Left Bank====
The main attack began in darkness and a heavy fog, but the fog lifted as the British neared the main American line, exposing them to withering artillery fire. The British column had already been disordered by the passage of the 300 returning to the redoubt, and they advanced into a storm of American fire. Without the fascines and ladders, they were unable to scale and storm the American position. The British forces fell into confusion, thrown into disorder by the flight of the advance guard. Most of the senior officers were killed or wounded, including Major General Samuel Gibbs, who was killed leading the main attack column on the right, and Colonel Rennie, who led a detachment on the left by the river. Mullins had compromised their attack.
The Highlanders of the 93rd Regiment of Foot were ordered to leave Keane&#x27;s assault column advancing along the river, possibly because of Thornton&#x27;s delay in crossing the river and the artillery fire that might hit them, and to move across the open field to join the main force on the right. Keane fell wounded as he crossed the field with the 93rd. Rennie&#x27;s men managed to attack and overrun an American advance redoubt next to the river, but they could neither hold the position nor successfully storm the main American line behind it without reinforcements. Within a few minutes, the American 7th US Infantry arrived, moved forward, and fired upon the British in the captured redoubt; within half an hour, Rennie and nearly all of his men were dead. In the main attack on the right, the British infantrymen flung themselves to the ground, huddled in the canal, or were mowed down by a combination of musket fire and grapeshot from the Americans. A handful made it to the top of the parapet on the right, but they were killed or captured. The riflemen of the 95th Regiment of Foot had advanced in open skirmish order ahead of the main assault force and were concealed in the ditch below the parapet, unable to advance further without support.

The two large main assaults were repulsed. Pakenham and Gibbs were fatally wounded while on horseback by grapeshot fired from the earthworks. Major Wilkinson of the 21st Regiment of Foot reformed his lines and made a third assault. They were able to reach the entrenchments and attempted to scale them. Wilkinson made it to the top before being shot. The Americans were amazed at his bravery and carried him behind the rampart. The British soldiers stood out in the open and were shot apart with grapeshot from Line Jackson, including the 93rd Highlanders, having no orders to advance further or retreat.

The light infantry companies commanded by Jones attacked the right flank, but were repulsed by Coffee&#x27;s troops. The attack having failed, the troops withdrew, and sought cover in the woods. Lieutenant Colonel Jones was mortally injured.

General Lambert was in the reserve and took command. He gave the order for his reserve to advance and ordered the withdrawal of the army. The reserve was used to cover the retreat of what was left of the British army in the field. Artillery fire from both sides ceased at 9 am with American batteries ceasing at 2 pm. Whilst the attack was of two hours duration, the main assault lasted only thirty minutes.

===Analysis===
The Battle of New Orleans was remarkable both for its apparent brevity and its casualties, though some numbers are in dispute and contradict the official statistics. The defenders of the Left Bank had casualties amounting to 11 killed and 23 wounded; American losses were only 13 killed, 39 wounded, and 19 missing or captured in total on that day. Robert Remini and William C Davis make reference to the British casualty reports of 291 killed, 1,262 wounded, and 484 missing, a total loss of 2,037 men. Among the prisoners taken when the British retreated from the battlefield, Jackson estimated three hundred were mortally wounded. Colonel Arthur P. Hayne&#x27;s dispatch to Jackson dated January 13 estimated the British had 700 fatalities and 1400 wounded, with 501 prisoners of war in his custody. A reduction in headcount due to 443 British soldiers&#x27; deaths since the prior month was reported on January 25, which is lower than Hayne&#x27;s estimate of 700 for the battle alone.

The large number of casualties suffered by the British on the Left Bank reflects their failure to maintain the element of surprise, with plenty of advance notice being given to the defenders, owing to the delays in executing the attack on the Right Bank. The failure of the British to have breached the parapet and conclusively eliminated the first line of defense was to result in high casualties as successive waves of men marching in column whilst the prepared defenders were able to direct their fire into a Kill zone, hemmed in by the riverbank and the swamp. The American cannon opened fire when the British were at 500 yards, the riflemen at 300 yards, and the muskets at 100 yards.

Reilly supports the assertion that it was the American artillery that won the battle. The losses among the regiments out of range of small arms fire were disproportionately high, with almost every British account emphasizing the effect of heavy gunfire. In contrast, the riflemen of the 95th Foot in skirmish order, the most difficult target for artillery, had lost only 11 killed. Dickson&#x27;s eyewitness account is clear that the British were only within musket shot range for less than five minutes. The account by Latour states the battalions of Plauché, Daquin, Lacoste, along with three quarters of the 44th US Infantry did not fire at all. In order to have inflicted such a heavy toll on the British, it would not have been possible to have done this primarily with musket fire, of which the best trained men could only manage two shots per minute. Unlike their British counterparts, the American forces had larger guns, and more of them. They were situated in well-protected earthworks, with a ditch and stockade. The Americans therefore had a number of advantages, but they should not minimize the skill and bravery of their gunners. Stoltz is of the opinion that Jackson was victorious because an American army guarded a strategic choke point and defended it with professionally designed fieldworks and artillery.

Almost universal blame was assigned to Colonel Mullins of the 44th Foot which had been detailed to carry fascines and ladders to the front to enable the British soldiers to cross the ditch and scale the parapet and fight their way to the American breastwork. Mullins was found half a mile to the rear when he was needed at the front. Pakenham learned of Mullins&#x27; conduct and placed himself at the head of the 44th, endeavoring to lead them to the front with the implements needed to storm the works, when he fell wounded after being hit with grapeshot. He was hit again while being helped to mount a horse, this time mortally wounded.}}

Pakenham&#x27;s choice of units has come under question. Pakenham&#x27;s aide, Wylly, was scornful about the 44th Foot, and thought the 21st Foot was lacking in discipline. His most experienced infantry regiments, the 7th Foot and 43rd Foot, veterans of Wellington&#x27;s Peninsular War army, were kept in reserve in the plan of attack.

The inability of Thornton&#x27;s troops to have taken the Right Bank at night, in advance of the main assault, meant that the British were enfiladed by the American batteries. It has been observed that Keane&#x27;s failure, to have taken the Chef Menteur Road, was compounded when the aggressively natured Pakenham went ahead and launched a frontal assault before the vital flank operation on the other bank of the river had been completed, at a cost of over 2,000 casualties.

Poor British planning and communication, plus costly frontal assaults against an entrenched enemy, caused lopsided British casualties. The Duke of Wellington was saddened by the death of this man, his brother-in-law, with whom he had been on campaign in Spain. A grieving Wellington vented his anger towards Cochrane, whom he blamed:

Patterson notes that the plan of attack was not his own, he conceded to follow it, despite his reservations, and his death prevented him from reformulating a subsequent attack, following the initial failure.

Reilly opines that the brilliance of Cochrane&#x27;s plan to take possession of the Right Bank batteries was fully comprehended, after its capture. He believes it was the failure of Pakenham&#x27;s staff to wake him, and to let him know the Right Bank landing was not possible, neither at daylight, nor with the numbers of soldiers originally envisaged, more than any other action or omission in the entire campaign, that was the biggest failure on the part of the British that led to proceed with the attack, with the disastrous outcome that day.

Regarding the American forces on the Right Bank, Reilly states their defenses were inadequate, and that Morgan&#x27;s deployment of his troops was incompetent. The resultant court of inquiry made no mention of General David Bannister Morgan at all.

==Aftermath==
===Fort St. Philip===

Fort St. Philip, manned by an American garrison, defended the river approach to New Orleans. British naval forces attacked the fort on January 9 but withdrew after ten days of bombardment with exploding bomb shells from two bomb vessels, mounting a total of four mortars. In a dispatch sent to the Secretary of War, dated January 19, Jackson stated: &quot;I am strengthened not only by [the defeat of the British at New Orleans] ... but by the failure of his fleet to pass fort St. Philip.&quot;

===British withdrawal===
Despite news of capture of the American battery on the west bank of the Mississippi River, British officers concluded that continuing the Louisiana campaign would be too costly. Three days after the battle, General Lambert held a council of war. Deciding to withdraw, the British left camp at Villeré&#x27;s Plantation by January 19. They were not pursued in any strength. The Chalmette battlefield was the plantation home of Ignace Martin de Lino (1755–1815), a Spanish veteran of the American Revolutionary War. The British returned to where they had landed, a distance in excess of sixty miles. The final troops re-embarked on January 27.

The British fleet embarked the troops on February 4, 1815 and sailed toward Dauphin Island at Mobile Bay on February 7, 1815. The army captured Fort Bowyer at the entrance to Mobile Bay on February 12. Preparations to attack Mobile were in progress when news arrived of the Treaty of Ghent. General Jackson also had made tentative plans to attack the British at Mobile and to continue the war into Spanish Florida. With Britain having ratified the treaty and the United States having resolved that hostilities should cease pending imminent ratification, the British departed, sailing to the West Indies. The British government was determined on peace with the United States, and speculation that it planned to permanently seize the Louisiana Purchase has been rejected by historians. Thus Carr concludes, &quot;by the end of 1814 Britain had no interest in continuing the conflict for the possession of New Orleans or any other part of American territory, but rather, due to the European situation and her own domestic problems, was anxious to conclude hostilities as quickly and gracefully as possible.&quot;

It would have been problematic for the British to continue the war in North America, due to Napoleon&#x27;s escape from Elba on February 26, 1815, which ensured their forces were needed in Europe. General Lambert participated in the Battle of Waterloo, as did the 4th Foot.

===Distinguished service as mentioned in dispatches===


=== Assessment ===

For the campaign, American casualties totaled 333 with 55 killed, 185 wounded, and 93 missing, while British casualties totaled 2,459 with 386 killed, 1,521 wounded, and 552 missing, according to the respective official casualty returns. A reduction in headcount due to 443 British soldiers&#x27; deaths since the prior month was reported on January 25. The effective strength of the British had reduced from 5,933

The hundreds of dead British soldiers were likely buried at Jacques Villeré&#x27;s plantation, which was the headquarters of the British Army during the New Orleans campaign. Nobody knows exactly where their final resting spot is. The only deceased British soldiers transported back to the United Kingdom were Generals Pakenham and Gibbs. Lieutenant Colonel Robert Rennie was buried by the 7th US Infantry, as ordered by Jackson, and his personal effects were passed on to Norman Pringle (an officer of the 21st Foot), via a flag of truce, to be forwarded on to Rennie&#x27;s widow.
A discredited historical interpretation holds that the British had an ambitious colonization plan for the &quot;Crown colony of Louisiana&quot; if they had succeeded in capturing New Orleans and Mobile. While some British generals did speculate, the British government under Lord Liverpool rejected all such ideas and planned to finalize the peace by ratifying the Treaty of Ghent as soon as possible, regardless of what happened in New Orleans. For the discredited speculation see Abernethy (1961). Cavell notes that there is little in the correspondence to imply that Britain planned permanently to occupy or to annex New Orleans or Louisiana territory and Davis states in his book &#x27;no one in [the British] government seems to have advocated permanent possession&#x27;.

Both sides faced challenges with logistics. This was especially the case for the British. The shortage of small boats had a noticeable impact when the landing on the Right Bank was made with only a third of the force originally planned, and they arrived far later than the time when they were supposed to arrive. The transport ships with the 26 artillery pieces of the siege train did not arrive until January 11, and would not see action until the engagement at Fort Bowyer on February 7, 1815. The poor quality of the roads through the swampy terrain, coupled with the lack of horses, was a burden upon the British supply network. These logistical shortcomings of the British were a precursor to similar issues that would be experienced during the Crimean War.

==Legacy==
=== The battle in American historiography ===
The battle became historically important mainly for the meaning Americans gave it, particularly with respect to Jackson. According to Matthew Warshauer, the Battle of New Orleans meant, &quot;defeating the most formidable army ever arrayed against the young republic, saving the nation&#x27;s reputation in the War of 1812, and establishing [Jackson] as America&#x27;s preeminent hero.&quot; News of victory &quot;came upon the country like a clap of thunder in the clear azure vault of the firmament, and traveled with electromagnetic velocity, throughout the confines of the land.&quot; Popular pamphlets, songs, editorials, speeches, and plays glorified Jackson&#x27;s new, heroic image.

The Eighth of January was a federal holiday from 1828 to 1861, and it was among the earliest national celebrations, as &quot;previously, Americans had only celebrated events such as the Fourth of July or George Washington&#x27;s birthday on a national scale&quot;. The anniversary of the battle was celebrated as an American holiday for many years called &quot;The Eighth&quot;.

The historiography has been revisited by contemporary historians. According to Troy Bickham, the American victory at New Orleans &quot;did not have an impact on the war&#x27;s outcome&quot;, but it shaped &quot;how the Americans received the end of the war by creating the illusion of military victory.&quot; Benn notes that American popular memory focused on the victories at Baltimore, Plattsburgh, and New Orleans to present the war as a successful effort to assert American national honor, or a Second War of Independence, in which the mighty British Empire was humbled and humiliated. In keeping with this sentiment, there is a popularly held view that Britain had planned to annex Louisiana in 1815. The amoral depravity of the British, in contrast with the wholesome behavior of the Americans, has the &quot;beauty and booty&quot; story at the center of a popular history account of Jackson&#x27;s victory at New Orleans. According to historian Alan Taylor, the final victory at New Orleans had in that sense &quot;enduring and massive consequences&quot;. It gave the Americans &quot;continental predominance&quot;, while it left the indigenous nations dispossessed, powerless, and vulnerable.

=== The role played by riflemen of Jackson&#x27;s army ===
&quot;The Hunters of Kentucky&quot; was a song written to commemorate Jackson&#x27;s victory over the British at the Battle of New Orleans. In both 1824 and 1828 Jackson used the song as his campaign song during his presidential campaigns.

&quot;Hunters of Kentucky&quot; propagated various beliefs about the war. One of them was calling the Pennsylvania Rifle the Kentucky Rifle. Another was crediting the riflemen with the victory of the Battle of New Orleans, when it could be said it was Jackson&#x27;s artillery that was actually responsible for the win. Finally, one stanza said that the British planned to ransack New Orleans, which was unlikely to happen.

In keeping with the idea of the conflict as a &quot;second war of independence&quot; against John Bull, the narrative of the skilled rifleman in the militia had parallels with the myth of the Minuteman as the key factor in winning against the British.

The Kentucky militiamen were the worst equipped of Jackson&#x27;s forces. Only a third were armed, lamented Jackson to Monroe. On top of this, they were poorly clothed, and were weakened from the long journey. (This explains their poor performance against Thornton&#x27;s troops on the Right Bank, where they were quickly routed. A court of inquiry cleared Colonel Davis of blame. The outcome was not to the satisfaction of the Kentuckians. Two years later, an account was published in the &quot;Kentucky Reporter&quot;, that grossly exaggerated the Kentucky militia&#x27;s resistance, whilst bringing into question the behavior of the Louisiana Militia and its commander.) Upon learning this, Jackson was purported to have quipped &#x27;I never in my life seen a Kentuckian without a gun, a pack of cards, and a jug of whiskey.&#x27;

The author Augustus Caesar Buell had a book about Jackson published posthumously. It contains his argument that the effect of the artillery, relative to riflemen, was negligible. He &quot;provides the most authentic solution&quot; by claiming to quote from a primary source document from a fictitious department of the British Army. He declared there were 3,000 men wounded or killed by rifle munitions, 326 by musket or artillery. The numbers provided run counter to those in primary sources with known provenance. Although there are contemporary secondary sources that champion the riflemen as the cause of this victory, Ritchie notes the British reserve was 650 yards away from the American line, so never came within rifle range, yet suffered 182 casualties. Owsley estimates that between 800 and 1200 privately owned rifles were used, with the majority of Jackson&#x27;s men equipped with the musket.

Histories of the battle, in particular those directed towards a popular audience, have continued to emphasize the part played by the riflemen. In more recent years, starting with Brown in 1969, scholarship has revealed that the militia played a smaller role, and that most British casualties were attributed to artillery fire. The engineers who oversaw the erection of the ramparts, the enslaved persons of color who built them, and the trained gunners who manned the cannons have seen their contributions understated as a consequence of these popular histories that have been written since the Era of Good Feelings. Popular memory&#x27;s omissions of the numerous artillery batteries, professionally designed earthworks, and the negligible effect of aimed rifle fire during that battle lulled those inhabitants of the South into believing that war against the North would be much easier than it really would be. Owsley notes that De Tousard was adamant that the artillery fire broke the British, many of its gunners being of French extraction.

Until fairly recently, &quot;the supremacy of Kentucky and Tennessee rifles in deciding the battle was undisputed.&quot; Whilst this is recognised in some contemporary sources as folklore, it is seen as an emblem of a bygone era in Kentucky. Yet, a bronze statue was dedicated in 2015 in honor of the local Soldier - Ephraim McLean Brank - who, as legend has it, was the &quot;Kentucky rifleman&quot; at the Battle of New Orleans. It is situated at Muhlenburg County Courthouse in Greenville, Kentucky. There are still those who are happy to cling to accounts of forefathers from their state, and how the &quot;long riflemen killed all of the officers ranked Captain and above in this battle,&quot; and &quot;Victory was made possible by an unlikely combination of oddly disparate forces, British logistic oversights and tactical caution, and superior American backwoods marksmanship.&quot;

===&quot;Beauty and Booty&quot; controversy===
After the battle, a claim was published by George Poindexter, in a letter dated January 20 to the &quot;Mississippi Republican&quot;, that Pakenham&#x27;s troops had used &quot;Beauty and Booty&quot; as a watchword:

This was republished in Niles&#x27; Register, the National Intelligencer on February 13, and other newspapers. Whilst there were criticisms from the Federalist press, as well as from Poindexter&#x27;s enemies, as to how reliable this information was, it was widely accepted elsewhere. Senator Charles Jared Ingersoll made direct reference to this in his speech to Congress on February 16, reproduced in full in the &quot;National Intelligencer&quot;. He continued, in an elated manner, &#x27;with the tidings of this triumph from the south, to have peace from the east, is such a fullness of gratification as must overflow all hearts with gratitude.&#x27; He saw the news of victory at New Orleans against an immoral foe, followed by news of peace, as a positive sentiment to unite the different peoples of the United States, the zeitgeist of these postwar years later becoming known as the &quot;Era of Good Feelings&quot;.

This watchword claim, as originated by Poindexter, was repeated in Eaton&#x27;s &quot;Life of General Jackson&quot;, first published in 1817. A second edition of this biography was published in 1824, when Jackson made his first presidential bid. Further editions were published for the presidential elections of 1828 and 1833. Editions from 1824 onwards now contained the claim that documentary evidence proved the watchword was used. As a consequence it was reproduced in a travelogue in 1833.

Following the publishing of a travelogue in 1833, whereby the author James Stuart referred to the watchword, this hitherto unknown controversy became known in Great Britain. In response to the author, five British officers who had fought in the battle, Keane, Lambert, Thornton, Blakeney and Dickson, signed a rebuttal in August 1833. It is stated this was published in &quot;The Times&quot; by American sources, but this is not the case. Niles&#x27;s Register, which originally printed Poindexter&#x27;s claim, then printed the British rebuttal with the editorial comment, &quot;Six of the principal officers... have distinctively denied any knowledge [of the watchword].. The following interesting documents have been sent us for insertion.&quot;:

James Stuart&#x27;s account was criticised by a veteran, Major Norman Pringle, who wrote several letters to the Edinburgh Evening Courant. In response, Stuart published a book to refute these criticisms. He quoted Major Eaton as a reliable source, and later went on to comment that as a result of Stuart, it had become accepted the watchword was a falsehood. One quote from the book &quot;certainly the refutation of
the charge as stated in Major Eaton&#x27;s Book is, though tardy, complete&quot; considered the matter closed. Notwithstanding the refutation, the story had benefited both Jackson and Eaton&#x27;s political careers, who had nothing left to prove.

The publication of Eaton&#x27;s book in Britain in 1834, and in subsequent editions, still contained the story of &quot;booty and beauty&quot;. The British Ambassador, Sir Charles Richard Vaughan wrote to President Jackson about the matter. Vaughan wrote that Eaton &#x27;expressed himself glad, that the report was at last contradicted&#x27; by the rebuttal, but there was no pressure on him to retract his comments from the Jackson biography. There is no recounting in 1833 of Jackson&#x27;s supposed encounter with the mystery Creole planter (Denis de la Ronde), as reported by S C Arthur (see below).

Arthur&#x27;s 1915 publication, quoting from Parton&#x27;s 1861 biography of Jackson, itself quoting extensively from Vincent Nolte&#x27;s book published in 1854, has referred to a Creole planter reportedly visited a British military camp a few days prior to the battle, being welcomed in after claiming that he was supportive of a possible British takeover of the region. While dining at dinner with a group of British officers, the planter claimed he heard one officer offer the toast of &quot;Beauty and Booty&quot;. After gathering information on Pakenham&#x27;s battle plans, the planter left the camp the next day and reported the information he had gathered to Jackson; the rumor that the British were offering toasts to &quot;Beauty and Booty&quot; soon spread throughout New Orleans, in particular among the upper-class women of the city. Nolte&#x27;s book reveals the &#x27;planter&#x27; to be no other than Denis de la Ronde, the colonel commanding the Third Regiment of the Louisiana Militia.

In the years since the Treaty of Ghent, not only did Jackson&#x27;s reputation benefit from his major victory against the British, but also from vilifying the British as an amoral foe, against whom a second war of independence had been fought. As a national hero, it facilitated his subsequent career in politics, and tenure as President of the United States.

===Political outcomes===
New England as a whole was against the war. The leaders of the Federalist Party of New England met at the Hartford Convention and decided to deliver a set of demands to the federal government in January 1815. The moderates were in charge and there was no proposal to secede from the union. When the Hartford delegation reached Washington word of the great American victory at New Orleans came and the Federalists were seen as traitors and anti-American; the Federalist Party was permanently ruined.

The economic impact of the War of 1812 resulted in discord for those in the northern New England states harmed by the blockade. Their concerns were voiced through the Federalist Party. The Hartford Convention saw them discuss their grievances concerning the ongoing war and the political problems arising from the federal government&#x27;s increasing power. Federalists were increasingly opposed to slavery, both on principle and because the Three-fifths Compromise gave a political advantage to their opponents, who gained increased representation because of the weight given to enslaved (and therefore disenfranchised) people. This had resulted in the dominance of Virginia in the presidency since 1800.

By the time the Federalist &quot;ambassadors&quot; got to Washington, the war was over and news of Andrew Jackson&#x27;s stunning victory in the Battle of New Orleans had raised American morale immensely. The &quot;ambassadors&quot; hastened back to Massachusetts, but not before they had done fatal damage to the Federalist Party. The Federalists were thereafter associated with the disloyalty and parochialism of the Hartford Convention and destroyed as a political force. Across the nation, Republicans used the great victory at New Orleans to ridicule the Federalists as cowards, defeatists and secessionists. Pamphlets, songs, newspaper editorials, speeches and entire plays on the Battle of New Orleans drove home the point.

The Era of Good Feelings resulted from the Battle of New Orleans. From 1815 to 1825 there was single-party rule in Washington and an overwhelming feeling of patriotism due to the extinction of the Federalist Party. The era saw the collapse of the Federalist Party and an end to the bitter partisan disputes between it and the dominant Democratic-Republican Party during the First Party System.

Andrew Jackson served as the seventh president of the United States from 1829 to 1837.

The void left by the Federalist Party was replaced by the Whig Party (United States), which came into being in 1833, in opposition to Andrew Jackson, and his policies as President. The Whig Party fell apart in the 1850s due to divisions over the expansion of slavery. Once more, a division between southern and northern states came into being.

The victory at New Orleans effectively kept the United States unified for the next 45 years until the American Civil War.

===Memorials===

The Louisiana Historical Association dedicated its Memorial Hall facility to Jackson on January 8, 1891, the 76th anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans. The Federal government established a national historical park in 1907 to preserve the Chalmette Battlefield, which also includes the Chalmette National Cemetery. It features the 100-foot-tall Chalmette Monument and is part of the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve. The monument was supposed to be at least 150 feet tall but the very soft and wet soil limited it to 100 feet. A five-cent stamp in 1965 commemorated the sesquicentennial of the Battle of New Orleans and 150 years of peace with Britain. The bicentennial was celebrated in 2015 with a Forever stamp depicting United States troops firing on British soldiers along Line Jackson.

Prior to the twentieth century the British government commonly commissioned and paid for statues of fallen generals and admirals during battles to be placed inside St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London as a memorial to their sacrifices. Major Generals Pakenham and Gibbs were both memorialized in a statue at St Paul&#x27;s that was sculpted by Sir Richard Westmacott.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;The Buccaneer&quot;, a 1938 American adventure film made by Cecil B. DeMille starring Fredric March, was based on Jean Lafitte and the Battle of New Orleans during the War of 1812.
* &quot;The Buccaneer&quot;, a 1958 pirate-war film starring Yul Brynner as Jean Lafitte and Charlton Heston as Andrew Jackson, is a fictionalization of the privateer Lafitte helping Jackson win the Battle of New Orleans.
* Johnny Horton&#x27;s cover of the Jimmy Driftwood song &quot;The Battle of New Orleans&quot;, which describes the battle from the perspective of an American soldier, reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1959.

<text>John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers were an English blues rock band led by multi-instrumentalist, singer and songwriter John Mayall. The band has been influential as an incubator for British rock and blues musicians. Many of the best known bands to come out of Britain in the 1960s and 1970s had members that came through the Bluesbreakers at one time, forming the foundation of British blues music that is still played heavily on classic rock radio. Among those with a tenure in the Bluesbreakers are guitarists Eric Clapton (later of Cream, Blind Faith, Derek and the Dominos and a successful solo career), Peter Green (later of Fleetwood Mac) and Mick Taylor (later of the Rolling Stones), bassists John McVie (later of Fleetwood Mac), Jack Bruce (later of Cream) and Tony Reeves (later of Colosseum), drummers Hughie Flint, Aynsley Dunbar (later of Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, Journey and Jefferson Starship), Mick Fleetwood (later of Fleetwood Mac) and Jon Hiseman (later of Colosseum), and numerous others. 

Mayall used the band name between 1963 and 1970, then dropped it for twelve years. In 1982, a &#x27;Return of the Bluesbreakers&#x27; was announced, and the name was used until the band again dissolved in 2008. The name has become generic, without a clear distinction between recordings by Mayall alone and those by Mayall and his band.

==History==
The band that would evolve into the Bluesbreakers in 1965 was formed in February 1963 and became an ever-changing lineup of more than 100 combinations of musicians performing under the name. Eric Clapton joined in April 1965, a few months after the release of their first album. Clapton brought guitar-led blues influences to the forefront of the group; he had left The Yardbirds in order to concentrate on the blues.

The first single released by John Mayall and his band, in May 1964, was the song &quot;Crawling Up a Hill&quot;, with &quot;Mr. James&quot; as the B-side. The band on the single was composed of Peter Ward, John McVie on bass, Bernie Watson on guitar, and Martin Hart on drums. After the release, Watson was replaced by Roger Dean, and Hart by Hughie Flint. This lineup played on the album &quot;John Mayall Plays John Mayall&quot;, recorded in December 1964 and released in 1965. After this, the band released a single called &quot;Crocodile Walk&quot;, with &quot;Blues City Shakedown&quot; as the b-side, which was produced by Tony Clarke of Decca Records. Dean then left the group and was replaced by Clapton.

The group lost their record contract with Decca that year, which also saw the release of a single called &quot;I&#x27;m Your Witchdoctor&quot; (produced by Jimmy Page) in October 1965, the first credited to John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers, followed by a return to Decca in 1966. Then in August 1966 John Mayall and Eric Clapton released the single &quot;Lonely Years&quot;, with the b-side &quot;Bernard Jenkins&quot;, which was released by Purdah Records. The album &quot;Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton&quot; was released in July; it reached the Top Ten in the UK.

Shortly after &quot;Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton&quot; was released, Eric Clapton saw Buddy Guy in concert, and being impressed by his trio, the idea for Cream was formed, and he left to form this new group with Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce. Clapton was replaced by Peter Green for the album &quot;A Hard Road&quot;, which was recorded with McVie on bass and Aynsley Dunbar on drums. Then the same line-up served as backing band for the album &quot;Eddie Boyd and His Blues Band Featuring Peter Green&quot;. After this, Green left to form Fleetwood Mac.

Mick Taylor then joined the group, and they recorded &quot;Crusade&quot; on 12 July 1967. Soon after, McVie joined Fleetwood Mac and was replaced by Tony Reeves for the album &quot;Bare Wires&quot;, which was their highest-charting UK album. Then Reeves, Dick Heckstall-Smith and Jon Hiseman left to form Colosseum. Following a further album, &quot;Blues from Laurel Canyon&quot;, Taylor then left to join the Rolling Stones, and the name &quot;Bluesbreakers&quot; was dropped from John Mayall albums.

By the time the 1960s were over, the Bluesbreakers had finally achieved some success in the United States.
With some interruptions, the Bluesbreakers have continued to tour and release albums (over 50 to date), though they never achieved the critical or popular acclaim of their earlier material. In 2003, Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor and Chris Barber reunited with the band for John Mayall&#x27;s &quot;70th Birthday Concert&quot; in Liverpool—the concert was later released on CD and DVD. In 2004, their lineup included Buddy Whittington, Joe Yuele, Hank Van Sickle and Tom Canning, and the band toured the UK with Mick Taylor as a guest musician.

In November 2008, Mayall announced on his website he was disbanding the Bluesbreakers, to cut back on his heavy workload and give himself freedom to work with other musicians. A 2009 solo tour with Rocky Athas (formerly of Black Oak Arkansas) was the first musical venture Mayall undertook after disbanding the band. Former band member Johnny Almond died on 18 November 2009 from cancer, aged 63. 

In 2009, Eagle Records asked Mayall for a new album, and he put together a solo band including Rocky Athas (guitar), Tom Canning (keyboard), Greg Rzab (bass) and Jay Davenport (percussion) and produced the album &quot;Tough&quot; the same year. After a year, Canning left because of other priorities.

John Mayall died on 22 July 2024 at the age of 90, effectively ending the band.

<text>Moulay Ismail Ibn Sharif (, – 22 March 1727) was a Sultan of Morocco from 1672 to 1727, as the second ruler of the &#x27;Alawi dynasty. He was the seventh son of Moulay Sharif and was governor of the province of Fez and the north of Morocco from 1667 until the death of his half-brother, Sultan Moulay Rashid in 1672. He was proclaimed sultan at Fez, but spent several years in conflict with his nephew Moulay Ahmed ben Mehrez, who also claimed the throne, until the latter&#x27;s death in 1687. Moulay Ismail&#x27;s 55-year reign is the longest of any sultan of Morocco. During his lifetime, Isma’il amassed a harem of over 500 women with more than 800 confirmed biological children, making him one of the most prodigious fathers in recorded history.

The reign of Moulay Ismail marked a high watermark for Moroccan power. His military successes are explained by the creation of a strong army, originally relying on the &#x27;Guichs&#x27; (especially the Udaya) and on the Black Guard (or Abid al-Bukhari), black slaves who were totally devoted to him. As a result, the central power could be less reliant on tribes that often rebelled. Moulay Ismail failed against the Ottoman Regency of Algiers during the Battle of Moulouya in 1692, as he tried to expand his territory towards Tlemcen. Moulay Ismail once again attempted to capture Oran, which was under Spanish rule, he had some success in pushing back the tribes of the Regency of Algiers until the Algerian Bey Mustapha cooperated with the Spaniards in pushing back Moulay Ismail&#x27;s army. Moulay Ismail engaged in the Maghrebi War against the Regency of Algiers, he was successful in conquering the Western Beylik, he even looted the palace of the Bey. His army was subsequently pushed back in the Battle of Chelif in 1701. He participated in other minor battles such as Laghouat in 1708 which ended successfully. He expelled the Europeans from the ports they had occupied: Larache, Asilah, Mehdya, and Tangier. He took thousands of Christians prisoner and nearly took Ceuta.

Ismail controlled a fleet of corsairs based at Salé-le-Vieux and Salé-le-Neuf (now Rabat), which supplied him with European Christian slaves and weapons through their raids in the Mediterranean and all the way to the Black Sea. He established significant diplomatic relations with foreign powers, especially the Kingdom of France, Great Britain, and Spain. Often compared to his contemporary, Louis XIV, due to his charisma and authority, Moulay Ismail was nicknamed the &#x27;bloody king&#x27; by the Europeans due to his extreme cruelty and exaction of summary justice upon his Christian slaves. He is also known in his native country as the &quot;Warrior King&quot;.

He also made Meknes his capital and undertook the construction of an enormous citadel and palace complex next to its old city which included several grand residences, gardens, monumental gates, mosques, and more than forty kilometers of walls. He died following a sickness. After his death, his supporters became so powerful that they controlled the country, enthroning and dethroning the sultans at will.

==Biography==
=== Background, early life, and accession to power ===

Born in 1645 at Sijilmassa, Moulay Ismail ben Sharif was the son of Sharif ibn Ali, Emir of Tafilalt and first sovereign of the &#x27;Alawi dynasty. His clan claimed descent from Hassan Ad-Dakhil, a 21st generation descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

According to Al-Istiqsa, his mother was M&#x27;barka bint Yarg (d. 1668), a Hartania slave from the Saharan Mghrafa tribe (direct cousins of the Oudaya tribe as a cadet branch of it). She was reportedly given as a concubine to Sharif ibn Ali by , when he was holding him in captivity under ransom. This remains contested, as it would have made his birthdate in 1637 around the time his father was captive, while he was born in 1645. Enslaved people do not have ascendance from their tribe, here the Mghrafa, and according to Moulay Ismail&#x27;s own words the Oudayas are his maternal uncles. Without further explanation on this degree of kinship.

After the death of the Saadi sultan Ahmad al-Mansur, Morocco entered a period of unrest, during which his sons fought with one another for the throne, while the country was parcelled up by the different military leaders and religious authorities. From the beginning of the reign of Zidan Abu Maali in 1613, the Saadi sultanate was very weak. The Zawiya Dila&#x27;iya (or Zawiya of Dila) controlled central Morocco, the established its influence from Souss to the Draa River, the marabout Sidi al-Ayachi took possession of the northwestern plains, the Atlantic coast as far as Taza, the Republic of Salé became an independent state at the mouth of the Bou Regreg, and the city of Tétouan became a city-state under the control of the Naqsis family. At Tafilalt, the Alaouites were appointed by the local people in order to check the influence of the Zaouias of Illigh and Dila. They were an independent emirate from 1631.
Three rulers preceded Ismail ben Sharif: his father, Moulay Sharif, then his two half-brothers respectively Sidi Mohammed and Moulay Rachid. As the first sovereign of the &#x27;Alawi dynasty from 1631, Moulay Sharif succeeded in keeping Tafilalt outside the authority of the Dila&#x27;iya. He abdicated in 1636 and his eldest son, Sidi Muhammad ibn Sharif succeeded him. Under the latter&#x27;s reign, the &#x27;Alawi realm expanded into the north of the country, to Tafna and the Draa river and managed to capture the city of Oujda. His half-brother, Moulay Rashid rebelled against him and managed to kill him on 3 August 1664, in a battle on the plain of Angad (near Oujda). Moulay Ismail chose to support Rashid and was rewarded by being appointed governor of Meknes. There, Moulay Ismail devoted himself to the region&#x27;s agriculture and commerce, to increase his wealth, while Moulay Rashid reigned as Sultan of Tafilalt and then as Sultan of Morocco after his conquest of Fez on 27 May 1664. Rashid further entrusted Ismail with military control of the North of Morocco and made him Khalifa (viceroy) of Fez in 1667, while he fought in the south of Morocco. Rashid conquered the Dila&#x27;iya in 1668 and then took two years to overcome rebels at Marrakesh before he broke into the city in 1669.

On 6 April 1670, in the presence of his brother Sultan Moulay Rashid, Moulay Ismail celebrated his first marriage at Fez to the daughter of a Sa&#x27;adi prince. On 25 July, he put to death sixty brigands from Oulad Djama, by crucifying them on the wall of the Borj el-Jadid in Fez. While Rashid continued his campaigns against the independent tribes of the High Atlas, he was killed on 9 April 1672 at Marrakesh, after falling off his horse. On 13 April, after he had learned of Rashid&#x27;s death, Moulay Ismail rushed to Fez, where he took possession of his brother&#x27;s treasury and then proclaimed himself Sultan of Morocco on 14 April 1672, at the age of twenty-six. This proclamation occurred around 2 pm and a grand ceremony followed. The whole population of Fez, including the nobles, intellectuals, and sharifs swore to be loyal to the new sovereign, as did the tribes and cities of the kingdom of Fez, who sent embassies and presents to him. Only Marrakesh and the region around it did not send an embassy. Ismail fixed his capital at Meknes, on account of the water supply and climate of the town.

===Difficult early reign===

After seizing power, Moulay Ismail faced several rebellions: most significant was the revolt of his nephew Moulay Ahmed ben Mehrez, son of Moulay Murad Mehrez, then the rebellions of his brothers, including Harran ibn Sharif, who assumed the title of King of Tafilalt. The Tetouan warlord Khadir Ghaïlan also resisted Sultan Ismail, along with several tribes and religious groups.

When the news of Rashid&#x27;s death reached Sijilmassa, Ahmed ben Mehrez rushed to Marrakesh, to have himself proclaimed sultan. The tribes of Al Haouz, the Arabs of Souss, and the inhabitants of Marrakesh joined him and he was able to assume control of the area. He rallied the southern tribes and was proclaimed sultan at Marrakesh. In response, Moulay Ismail launched a campaign against his nephew on 27 April 1672. Ismail was victorious as a result of his artillery. He entered the city of Marrakesh and was recognized as sultan there on 4 June 1672. Ahmed suffered a bullet wound and fled into the mountains. Ismail pardoned the inhabitants of Marrakesh and reorganized the city&#x27;s defenses. He then went back to Fez to collect his brother Rashid&#x27;s coffin and inter it in the mausoleum of Sheikh Ali ibn Herzouhm, before returning to Meknes on 25 July 1672.

Moulay Ismail arranged the organisation of the empire and distributed goods to the soldiers of his army in preparation for an expedition into the Sahara. The project was abandoned however after a revolt broke out in the city of Fez, during which the Caid Zidan ben Abid Elamri, the intended head of the expedition, was killed and the sultan&#x27;s forces were expelled from the city, on the night of 26 August 1672. Moulay Ismail immediately arrived and was encamped outside the walls of the city. After several days of conflict, the noble clans of Fez appealed to Ahmed ben Mehrez in despair. He responded favorably to their appeal and traveled through Debdou to Taza, where he was proclaimed Sultan again. In the meanwhile, Khadir Ghaïlan sent a messenger to Fez and notified the inhabitants of his arrival by sea from Algiers to Tetouan, where he was welcomed by the Ennaqsîs family that governed the city. These events sparked serious unrest in the country. Moulay Ismail marched on Taza, which surrendered to him after a siege of several months, and forced Ahmed ben Mehrez to flee into the Sahara. While the siege of Fez continued, Ismail turned northwest to face Khadir Ghaïlan, who had taken control of the Habt region (the Gharb and Khlout plains and part of the Jebala territory) with the help of the Ottoman Regency of Algiers. With a force of 12,000 men, Ismail suppressed the rebellion and pacified the northern provinces, killing Ghaïlan on 2 September 1673 at Ksar el-Kebir He returned again to Fez, which was still under siege by his forces. The heart of the city, Fez Jdid, finally opened its gates on 28 October 1673, after a siege of fourteen months and eight days. Ismail granted a pardon to the inhabitants of Fez. He reorganised the city and appointed governors in charge of the suburbs of Fez el Bali and Fez Jdid.
On returning to Meknes, Moulay Ismail continued construction work and built several palaces. He was disturbed once more by his nephew Ahmed ben Mehrez, who seized Marrakesh sometime after May 1673. When Ismail learned of it in 1674, he first launched a campaign against the Arab tribes of the Angad region who were engaging in banditry. He severely defeated the Sgoûna tribe and then put in place the preparations for a major campaign against his nephew. Ismail marched at the head of his army into the Tadla region and encountered Ahmed ben Mehrez&#x27;s army at Bou Agba, near Oued El Abid. Ismail was victorious over his nephew&#x27;s army and killed its commander, Hida Ettouïri. Ahmed was chased by his uncle all the way to Marrakesh, where he entrenched himself. Ismail besieged the city and took it by force in 1674, forcing Ahmed to flee to the province of Drâa. The sultan then led a number of operations against the Chaouia tribes. In this same year, the Sanhaja of the High and Middle Atlas revolted and massacred the envoys of the Sultan, after having refused to pay tribute. Moulay Ismail launched the first expedition and attempted to dislodge them from the mountain strongholds where they had entrenched themselves. The sultan&#x27;s troops were repulsed by a force of 8,000 Berber infantry and 5,000 Berber cavalries. A second expedition followed, and this time the Sultan&#x27;s forces inflicted a heavy defeat on the rebels, seizing substantial booty.

In 1675, with the help of the inhabitants of Taroudant, Ahmed secretly returned to Marrakesh, expelled the royal army, and reoccupied the city. Ismail placed Marrakesh under siege once more. The fighting was bloody, with very high casualties on both sides, especially in June 1676. Ahmed eventually had to flee the city on 26 June 1677, heading for Souss. This time, Ismail violently sacked the city as punishment for supporting Ahmed.

While still at Marrakesh, Ismail learned that Ahmed ben Abdellah ad-Dila&#x27;i, grandson of Mohammed al-Hajj ibn Abu Bakr al-Dila&#x27;i, had gathered a large army of Sanhaja tribes from the mountains, crossed the Moulouya River and was raiding the Arab tribes of Tadla and Saïss, forcing them to flee to the cities of Fez, Meknes, and Sale. Ahmed was attempting to revive the defunct Zawiya Dila&#x27;iya and was supported by the Ottomans in Algiers, who had previously given him refuge. Since Ismail was busy with Ahmed ben Mehrez at Souss, he sent an autonomous force of 3,000 cavalries. They were defeated by the Berber army of Ahmed ben Abdellah and the force&#x27;s commander, Caid Ikhlef, was killed. Ismail then sent two further armies, numbering 4,000 men each, which were also beaten – the first near Meknes and the second at Kasba Tadla, which was then seized and destroyed by the Sanhaja. Meanwhile, Ismail also learned that three of his brothers, Moulay Harran, Moulay Hammada, and Moulay Murad Mehrez (the father of Ahmed ben Mehrez) had revolted and attacked Tafilalt. The sultan decided to deal with the unrest at Tadla first. He personally intervened and routed the Berbers in a battle in which say 3,000 Berbers dead and several hundred soldiers of the imperial army. He retook Tadla, stabilised the Middle Atlas region with his artillery and an enveloping maneuver carried out by the guich of Oudaya. The heads of nearly 700 rebels were nailed to the walls of Fez by the Caid Abdellah Errousi. Moulay Ismail returned to Meknes at the end of 1677 and ended his brothers&#x27; rebellion. He captured Moulay Harran but chose to spare him.

=== Stabilisation of the empire ===
Between 1678 and 1679, Moulay Ismail attempted an expedition over the Amour mountain range into the region of Cherg, accompanied by a large contingent of Arab tribes, including the Beni Amer. The Turkish artillery put all the Arab tribes in the expedition to flight and the Sultan was forced to set the border between the Regency of Algiers and Morocco at Tafna. Moulay Ismail restored and reorganised Oujda on his return. He reorganised the south of the empire following an expedition in 1678, from Souss and the oasis of Touat to the provinces of Chinguetti on the border of the Sudan region in modern Mauritania. During his journey, Ismail appointed caids and pashas and ordered the construction of forts and ribats to demonstrate his control to the &quot;makhzen&quot; in these regions. During this expedition, the Sultan received embassies from all the Banu Maqil (Maqil tribes) in the Saharan provinces of the country, which stretched all the way to the Senegal river. Moroccan control over the Pashalik of Timbuktu was established in 1670 and continued throughout Moulay Ismail&#x27;s reign.
Around the end of Ramadan 1678–1679, Ismail&#x27;s three brothers, Harran, Hashem, and Ahmed, and three of his cousins revolted with the help of the Sanhaja confederation of Aït Atta and the tribes of the and Dadès valleys. Moulay Ismail launched a massive expedition and seized Ferkla, Gueria, Toudra, and Dadès in quick succession. The rebel tribes abandoned their oases and fled into the Jbel Saghro in the eastern Anti-Atlas. With a large army, Ismail fought a difficult battle in the Jbel Saghro on 3 February 1679. The heavy casualties included Moussa ben Ahmed ben Youssef, commander of the Moroccan army, and 400 soldiers from Fez. It was a partial failure. The battle was ended by an agreement in which the rebel tribes granted the people of Tafilalt free passage back to Marrakesh through the Saharan rebel tribes&#x27; territory and promised future aid against the Christians. On their return journey, a blizzard struck the force as it crossed the Atlas at Telwet or Elglâoui on the Jbel Ben Deren, destroying nearly three thousand tents, part of the army, and the booty. In a fury, Moulay Ismail executed his vizier to avenge those who had been traveling with him, even though the vizier had had nothing to do with this catastrophe.
A plague struck around this time that killed several thousand people, mainly in the plain of Rharb and Rif.

After he had achieved the unification of Morocco, Moulay Ismail decided to end the Christian presence in the country. He first launched a campaign to recapture the city of Tangiers, which had been under English control since 1471 – initially Portuguese, the city had passed into English hands after the marriage of Catherine of Braganza to Charles II. The city was strongly fortified and had a large garrison of 4,000 men. Moulay Ismail assigned one of his best generals, , to besiege Tangier in 1680. At Tangiers, the English resisted, but, as a result of the high cost of maintaining the garrison, they decided to abandon the city, demolishing their fortifications and harbor over the winter of 1683. The Moroccan army entered the city on 5 February 1684.

In 1681, while the siege of Tangiers was still ongoing, Moulay Ismail sent part of his army under the command of Omar ben Haddou El-Bottoui to conquer the city of La Mamora. This city had been occupied by the Spanish in the period of chaos in Morocco after 1614. Ismail besieged the city, which had no water source, and captured it, along with all the Spaniards in the city, who numbered 309. Caid Omar had told the Spaniards that they would not be sold into slavery if they surrendered unconditionally &quot;Although they would be captives they would spend their days without working, until the first redemption.&quot; However Moulay Ismaïl saw no reason to honor Kaid Omar&#x27;s promises and had no intention of allowing the captives from al-Mamurah to be redeemed so they, including fifty &quot;poor girls and women&quot;, were forced to walk to Meknes as booty along with their possessions, arms and artillery (88 bronze cannons, 15 iron cannons, fire-pots, muskets, and gunpowder) which Germain Mousette wrote was &quot;more than he had in the rest of his kingdom&quot;. The city was renamed al-Mahdiya. Omar ben Haddou died of the plague on his return journey and was replaced by his brother Ahmed ben Haddou.

While his generals were undertaking these operations, Moulay Ismail was focused on stabilising the country. After an expedition to the Cherg region against the Beni Amer, he learned that Ahmed ben Mehrez had made yet another agreement with the Turks in Algiers. He also learned that the Turkish army was approaching Tafna and had already reached the territory of the . Ismail immediately sent a large force to the south of the country to face Ahmed and prepared an expedition against the Ottomans, which did not end up taking place because the Turkish army withdrew. He then marched south to confront his nephew at Souss in 1683. A battle took place there in April. After twenty-five days of fighting, Ahmed fled to Taroudant and entrenched himself there. Another battle on 11 June 1683 cost more than 2,000 lives. Ahmed and Ismail were themselves wounded. The clashes continued until Ramadan. Moulay Ismail undertook two expeditions that succeeded in pacifying several Berber regions.
While Moulay Ismail was occupied with these tribes in the Atlas, Ahmed ben Mehrez forged an alliance with Moulay Harran to destabilise Ismail&#x27;s empire. When Moulay Ismail learned, in 1684/5, that the two rebels had taken control of Taroudant and its hinterland, he immediately set out to besiege the city. Ahmed went out with a group of slaves to visit a sanctuary and was confronted by some members of the Zirâra tribe, who were soldiers of Ismail. Although they did not recognise him, the Zirâra attacked him, sparking a short battle, which ended with the death of Ahmed. The sultan&#x27;s soldiers only realised who he was after his death around the middle of October 1685. Ismail ordered that he be given a funeral and buried. Moulay Harran continued the resistance until April 1687, when he fled into the Sahara. The population of Taroudant was massacred and the city was repopulated with Rifans from Fez. Many of Ismail&#x27;s military commanders had lost their lives in this war, but after this date, no one else challenged the power of the Sultan. The war between Ahmed and Ismail had come to an end after thirteen years of fighting.

Moulay Ismail now prepared a strong army, estimated at 30,000–50,000 men, under the command of Ali ben Abdallah Er-Riffi and Ahmed ben Haddou El-Bottoui, to seize the city of Larache, which had been under Spanish control since 1610. The Sultan, who announced his plan in 1688, forced the Spaniards to fortify the city heavily, with 200 cannons and 1500–2000 men. The campaign began on 15 July 1689 and the siege began in August. The Moroccan army eventually took the city on 11 November 1689, at an estimated cost of 10,000 dead. The Moroccans captured 1,600 Spanish soldiers including 100 officers and 44 cannons. The Spanish army lost 400 soldiers in the battle. A prisoner exchange was arranged at a rate of one officer for ten Moroccans, one hundred officers were exchanged for a thousand Moroccan prisoners. The rest of the Spanish garrison remained in captivity, as slaves in Meknes, except for those who converted to Islam. To celebrate the triumph Moulay Ismaïl issued an edict banning the wearing of black shoes because the Spanish were said to have introduced the custom into Morocco when they first acquired Larache in 1610. The mufti of Fez was so elated by the victory he wrote, Shortly after Larache was conquered, Ismail sent Ahmed ben Haddou to besiege Assilah. Exhausted, the Spanish garrison evacuated the city by the sea and the Moroccan army occupied the town in 1691.
In 1692–3, Moulay Ismail organised a very large expedition against the last unconquered tribes. These were the Sanhaja Brâbér tribes, Berbers in Fêzzâz, a region in the western part of the Middle Atlas. These tribes formed the last pocket of the Bled es-Siba (the area that did not accept the authority of the sultan). Ismail&#x27;s army was very numerous and equipped with mortars, ballistae, cannons, and other siege weapons, which were dragged by Christian slaves all the way from Moulouya to Ksar Beni M&#x27;Tir. Meanwhile, the Moroccan forces gathered at Adekhsan. Ismail divided his army into three groups. The first was commanded by Pasha Msahel, with 25,000 infantry, and marched from Tadla to Oued El Abid, bypassing the Aït Isri. The second army was led by Caid Ali Ou Barka and consisted of Aït Imour and Aït Idrassen, who had to occupy Tinteghalin. The third and final group was commanded by Ali ben Ichchou El-Qebli, caid of and Beni Hakim, and was concentrated in the High Moulouya. The unconquered tribes comprised the Aït Oumalou, the Ait Yafelman and the Aït Isri. They were surrounded by Mulay Ismail who used all his artillery to break up the Berber rebels. A terrible battle followed, the Berbers were dispersed and fled into the ravines and valleys. After pursuing them for three days, 12,000 Berbers had been captured by the Sultan, and 10,000 horses and 30,000 guns as booty. Moulay Ismail had now conquered the whole of Morocco and forced all the tribes of the country to recognise his authority. He was the first &#x27;Alawi sultan to achieve this. He quickly organised the defense of the captured regions through the construction of several dozen fortresses throughout the country, which helped the central power to reach distant regions like Fêzzâz. With this victory, the conquest of Morocco was over. In 1693, according to Ahmad ibn Khalid al-Nasiri:
The Guerouans learned this the hard way. Some men of this tribe who carried out raids in the upper course of the Ziz River, on the road to Sijilmassa, drew the attention of Moulay Ismail. He ordered the caid Idrassen Ali ben Ichchou El-Qebli to massacre them. In Ahmad ibn Khalid al-Nasiri&#x27;s &quot;Al-Istiqsa&quot;, it is reported that Moulay Ismail provided 10,000 horsemen to Ali ben Ichchou, the caid of the Zemmour and Bni Hakem tribes and told him &quot;I do not want you to return until you have fallen upon the Gerrouans and unless you bring back to me a heads for each man here.&quot; So they left to kill as many of the Guerouans as possible and to pillage their encampments. He offered 10 mithqals to anyone who brought back an additional head. In the end, they collected 12,000. The Sultan was very happy with this and extended Ali ben Ichchou&#x27;s command to include the Aït Oumalou and Aït Yafelmâl territories, which had just been conquered.

Jean-Baptiste Estelle, the French consul in Salé wrote to his minister, the Marquis de Torcy in 1698: 

At its height, the Moroccan army contained 100,000 to 150,000 black soldiers in the Black Guard, as well as thousands more in the Guich of the Udaya, European renegades and vassal tribes which received land and slaves in exchange for providing soldiers.

=== Later reign and death ===
The rest of Moulay Ismail&#x27;s reign was marked by military setbacks and family problems relating to the succession. In May 1692, Moulay Ismail sent his son Moulay Zeydan with a large army to attack Ottoman Algeria. He was defeated by the Algerians who counter-attacked and advanced as far as Fez. Ismail offered his submission to the dey of Algiers and had to send an embassy to Algiers to make peace. He thus fixed his borders with the Beylik of Algiers at the Moulouya River. In 1693, Moulay Ismail raided the Oran region and attempted to pillage the Beni Amer which was successful. The city of Oran resisted two attacks, leading to the sultan&#x27;s retreat. This time, it was the Turks who sent envoys to make peace, at the initiative of the Ottoman Sultan, Ahmed II. In 1699, Moulay Ismail participated in the Maghrebi War and was successful in capturing the Beylik of Mascara and advanced with about 50,000 men as far as the Chelif River but his army was routed by the Algerians at the Battle of Chelif in 1701. Ismail, wounded in the fighting, had to escape on horseback and narrowly escaped capture. Moulay Ismail fought other minor conflicts with the Ottoman Algeria such as Laghouat in 1708 which turned out successful.

Ismail attempted to besiege the city of Ceuta with an army of 40,000 soldiers, but the strength of Spanish resistance meant that the siege dragged on. Part of Ismail&#x27;s army also besieged Melilla from 1694 to 1696, but the city&#x27;s fortifications were too much for them. In spring 1701, Moulay Ismail launched another expedition against Algeria. The Moroccan forces advanced to the Chelif River before they were intercepted by the Algerian army in Chediouïa. With a force of 10,000–12,000 men, the Algerian army managed to defeat the 60,000 soldiers of the Moroccan army. The Moroccan army suffered a heavy defeat and fell into disarray. Moulay Ismail himself was wounded and barely escaped. The heads of 3,000 Moroccan soldiers and 50 Moroccan leaders were brought to Algiers. In 1702, Moulay Ismail gave his son Moulay Zeydan an army of 12,000 men and instructed him to capture the Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera. The Moroccans razed the Spanish fortress, but failed to retain la Isleta. Meanwhile, the English admiral, George Rooke joined in the siege of Ceuta, blockading the port in 1704.

Between 1699 and 1700, Moulay Ismail divided the provinces of Morocco between his children. Moulay Ahmed was given responsibility for the province of Tadla and a force of 3,000 Black Guards. Moulay Abdalmalik was entrusted with Draâ province, with a kasbah and 1,000 cavalry. Moulay Mohammed al-Alim received Souss and 3,000 cavalries. Moulay El-Mâmoun commanded Sijilmasa and received 500 cavalry. When he died, he was replaced two years later by Moulay Youssef. Moulay Zeydan received command of &quot;Cherg&quot; (East), but he lost it after the Ottomans attacked and Ismail made peace with them. He was then replaced by Moulay Hafid. This division of the realm provoked jealousy and rivalry between Ismail&#x27;s sons, which sometimes degenerated into open clashes. In one of these, Moulay Abdelmalek was defeated by his brother, Moulay Nasser, who took control of the whole of Draâ. Moulay Sharif was appointed governor of Draâ by his father in place of Abdelmalek and succeeded in retaking the region from Nasser.

In response to the intrigues, slanders, and opposition of Lalla Aisha Mubarka, who wanted her son Moulay Mohammed Zeydan to succeed his father as Sultan, Ismail&#x27;s eldest son Moulay Mohammed al-Alim revolted in Souss and took control of Marrakesh on 9 March 1703. When Moulay Zeydan arrived with an army, Mohammed al-Alim fled to Taroudant. His brother besieged the place and captured it on 25 June 1704, and took him to Oued Beht on 7 July. Mohammed al-Alim was harshly punished by his father, who amputated one hand and one arm, executing both the butcher who refused to spill Mohammed al-Alim&#x27;s blood on the grounds that he was a Sharif, and the one who agreed to do it. He subsequently eliminated a caid of Marrakesh who had been responsible for Moulay Mohammed al-Alim&#x27;s acquisition of the city, with exceptional violence. Moulay al-Alim committed suicide at Meknes on 18 July, despite precautions that his father had put in place to prevent this. On learning of the atrocities which Moulay Zeydan had committed at Taroudant, especially the massacre of the city&#x27;s inhabitants, Moulay Ismail organised for him to be murdered in 1708, having his wives smother him when he was black-out drunk. Moulay Nasser also revolted in Souss, but was eventually killed by the Oulad Delim, who remained loyal to Moulay Ismail.

To prevent further trouble, Moulay Ismail rescinded the governorships that he had conferred on his sons, except for Moulay Ahmed, who retained his post as governor of Tadla and Moulay Abdelmalek who became governor of Souss. Since Abdelmalek behaved like an independent and absolute monarch and refused to pay tribute, Ismail decided to change the order of succession – this was aided by the fact that Abdelmalek&#x27;s mother was no longer close to him. Abdelmalek belatedly apologized, but Ismail remained hostile to his son. As a result, Moulay Ismail chose Moulay Ahmed as his successor.

In 1720, Philip V of Spain, who wanted to get revenge on Morocco for having aided the Grand Alliance in the War of the Spanish Succession, sent a fleet commanded by the Marquess of Lede to raise the siege of Ceuta which had been ongoing since 1694 and to force the Moroccans to give up on retaking the city. The Spanish fleet managed to raise the siege, but Moulay Ismail resumed it in 1721, after the Marquess of Lede had returned to Spain. The Sultan further planned a large armada for an invasion of Spain, but it was destroyed by a storm in 1722. The siege of Ceuta continued until Ismail&#x27;s death in 1727.

Moulay Ismail ibn Sharif finally died on 22 March 1727 at the age of 81, from an abscess in his lower abdomen. His reign lasted 55 years, making him the longest-reigning Moroccan monarch. He was succeeded by Moulay Ahmed. Both he and Ahmed were buried in the same mausoleum in Meknes. The empire immediately fell into civil war, as a result of a rebellion of the Black Guards. More than seven claimants to the throne succeeded to power between 1727 and 1757, some of them repeatedly, like Moulay Abdallah who was Sultan six times.

==Character and policies==
===Appearance, personality, and contemporary assessments===

The main character traits of Moulay Ismail, according to the chronicles and legends of his period, were his &quot;tendency to order and authority, as well as his iron will.&quot; He put his strength and power at the service of this unyielding will, &quot;If God gave me the kingship, man cannot take it from me,&quot; he is reported to have said. This will was always apparent in his actions and decisions. According to Dominique Busnot, the colour of his clothes was linked to his mood, 
According to contemporary Europeans, Moulay Ismail was considered cruel, greedy, merciless, and duplicitous. It was his cruelty and viciousness that particularly attracted their attention. Legends of the ease with which Ismail could behead or torture laborers or servants he thought to be lazy are numerous. According to a Christian slave, Moulay Ismail had more than 36,000 people killed over a 26-year period of his reign. According to François Pidou de Saint Olon, Moulay Ismail had 20,000 people assassinated over a twenty-year period of his reign. He was described by many authors, including Dominique Busnot, as a &quot;bloodthirsty monster&quot;. However, researcher such as Richard Bordeaux Parker opined that frequently-told stories about the ten of thousands of Christian slaves&#x27; forced labours and the large dungeons where they were kept were exaggerated from the accounts of European ambassadors who visited Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s court. Bordeaux Parker and Jonathan M. Bloom found the number of Christian slaves was likely closer to a few thousand at most and the chambers which suspected as slave prisons were actually storage rooms for grain and food supplies. The urban legends about Qara Prison holding thousands of them are disputed by Marianne Barrucand as she opined it is largely for food silos.

Moulay Ismail was also a very good horseman, with great physical strength, agility, and extraordinary cleverness, which he maintained even in his old age. &quot;One of his normal entertainments was to draw his sword as he mounted his horse and decapitate the slave who held the stirrup.&quot;

His physical appearance is almost always described in the same way by the Europeans. He had &quot;a long face, more black than white, i.e. very mulatto,&quot; according to Saint-Amans, ambassador of Louis XIV, who added that &quot;he is the strongest and most vigorous man of his State.&quot; He was of average height and he inherited the colour of his face from his mother, who had been a black slave.

According to Germain Moüette, a French captive who lived in Morocco until 1682:
===Religion===
&quot;A faithful and pious follower of his religion&quot;, he attempted to convert King James II of England to Islam, sending him letters whose sincerity and religious feeling are inarguable. Dominique Busnot, who was generally critical of Ismail, asserted that &quot;he had a great attachment to his Law and publicly practiced all the ceremonies, ablutions, prayers, fasts, and feasts with scrupulous precision.&quot;

He enjoyed debating theology with the Trinitarians in Morocco on points of controversy. On many occasions when returning from the mosque on Fridays, he asked for Trinitarians to be brought into his court. During a debate with the fathers of Mercy, he said this:
===Construction===

Moulay Ismail chose Meknes as Morocco&#x27;s capital city in 1672 and carried out an extensive building program there that resulted in the construction of numerous gates, mosques, gardens, and madrasas. On account of the rate of construction, Ismail is often compared to his contemporary Louis XIV. The Saadian El Badi Palace in Marrakesh was stripped of almost all its fittings, so that they could be transported to Meknes. Marble blocks and pillars were also taken from the ancient Roman ruins at Volubilis. At least 25,000 workers, mostly paid labourers along with a smaller number of Christian prisoners conscripted into forced labor, were employed on his major construction projects in Meknes. Ismail enjoyed visiting the building sites, to correct or revise whatever did not please him. He was sometimes cruel to the workers and did not hesitate to execute or punish those who produced poor-quality work.

He began the construction of his magnificent palace complex (or Kasbah) at Meknes before learning of the work being undertaken by Louis XIV at Versailles. According to European ambassadors present at Meknes in the period, the fortification walls of the palace alone were more than twenty-three kilometers long. Dar al-Kebira, the first of his palaces, was completed after three years of building and was immense, with hanging gardens modeled on those of Babylon. As soon as it was complete, he laid the foundations of Dar al-Makhzen, which linked together around fifty different palaces, containing their own hammams and its own mosque for his wives, concubines, and children. This was followed by Madinat er-Riyad, the residence of the viziers, governors, caids, secretaries, and other high functionaries of Ismail&#x27;s court, which the historian Ahmad ibn Khalid al-Nasiri called &#x27;the beauty of Meknes&#x27;.

In the economic sphere, Moulay Ismail built within his citadel the Heri es-Swani (also spelled Heri es-Souani), a major storehouse of foodstuffs which was fed by wells, and the Agdal or Sahrij Reservoir which was dug to ensure a regular water supply for the gardens of Meknes. Ambassadors were received in the Qubbat al-Khayyatin pavilion which he built at the end of the seventeenth century. He also built prisons to hold criminals, Christian slaves, and prisoners of war. Finally, Ismail built or restored in Meknes a large number of mosques, madrasas, public squares, kasbahs, fountains, city gates, and gardens. Construction continued throughout his whole reign.

In the military sphere, Ismail ordered the construction of a network of sixty-seven fortresses, which lined the main roads and surrounded mountainous areas. Meknes was protected by forty kilometers of walls, pierced by twenty gatehouses. Control over the eastern part of the country was ensured by the construction of many strong forts along the border with Ottoman Algeria. Others were built in the territory of individual tribes, to maintain peace. He also built defensive structures along the route from the Oasis of Touat to the Chenguit provinces, and reorganised or rebuilt the walls of some cities on the model of Oujda. Garrisons of the Black Guards were protected by the construction of Kasbahs in major population centers, modeled on the Kasbah of Gnawa in Salé.

=== Military reforms ===
====Army reforms====
Around 1677, Moulay Ismail began to assert his authority over the whole country. Once he had killed and disabled his principal opponents, he was able to return to Meknes to organise his empire. It was during this fighting that he had the idea of creating the corps of the Abid al-Bukhari or Black Guard.

The &#x27;Alawi army was principally composed of soldiers from the Saharan provinces and the provinces on the margin of the Sahara, such as Tafilalt, Souss, western Sahara, and Mauritania – the home of Khnata bint Bakkar, one of the four official wives of Ismail. The Banu Maqil, who inhabited these areas in great numbers, thus represented the foremost contingents of the &#x27;Alawis until the middle of Moulay Ismail&#x27;s reign, as they had under the Saadi dynasty. Several jayshes originated from these Arab tribes. The &#x27;Alawis could also count on the tribes of the Oujda region, which had been conquered by Sidi Mohammed of Tafilalt. The jaysh tribes were exempted from import taxes to compensate them and were given land in exchange for their troops.

Portion of Alawite military forces also composed of Arab-Zenata Jaysh Cheraga, which Rashid ibn Sharif had originally installed in the area north of Fez. Khlot and Sherarda, tribes of Banu Hilal, were given the rank of Makhzen and formed several contingents in the Moroccan army. He also founded Jaysh al-Rifi, an independent army of Berber tribesmen from the eastern Rif. This group later played an important role in the 17th-century Moroccan wars against Spanish colonization.

However, Ismail could not rely solely on these tribes, because they had a long history of independence and could change sides or desert him at any moment. Thus he decided to create Morocco&#x27;s first professional army, the Black Guard or Abid al-Bukhari, who were entirely beholden to him, unlike the tribal contingents. After the Siege of Marrakesh in 1672, he imported a large number of black male slaves from Sub-Saharan Africa and recruited many of the free black men in Morocco for his army. The initial contingent numbered perhaps 14,000 men. The Black Guard was rapidly expanded, reaching 150,000 men towards the end of Ismail&#x27;s reign. The guards received a military education from age ten until their sixteenth birthday when they were enlisted in the army. They were married to black women who had been raised in the royal palace like them.

Moulay Ismail also created the Jaysh al-Udaya, which is to be distinguished from the tribe of Udaya. The guich was divided into three &quot;reha&quot;. The first of these &quot;reha&quot; was the Ahl Souss (house of Souss), which was composed of four Banu Maqil Arab tribes of Souss: Ulad Jerrar, Ulad Mtâa, Zirara, and the Chebanate. In the 16th century, these tribes had formed the core of the Saadi army, against the Jashem Arabs of Rharb who were part of Banu Hilal and included the Khlout and Safiane, who had supported the Marinid dynasty of Fez. The second &quot;reha&quot; was the M&#x27;ghafra of Oued Noun, who were descended from Banu Maqil, Khnata bint Bakkar came from this group. The third &quot;reha&quot; contained the members of the tribe of Udaya itself. They were a powerful desert tribe who were originally from the Adrar Plateau and were formidable camel riders. Shortly before Moulay Ismail&#x27;s reign, they had moved north and they were found in Souss under Moulay Ismail. After he reconquered Marrakesh in 1674, Ismail encountered a poor shepherd of the Udaya called Bou-Chefra and learned that his people had been forced to leave the desert because of the drought and were originally Banu Maqil like himself. Sympathizing with their plight, the Sultan decided to turn them into an elite division of his army.

The Jaysh al-Udaya became a major portion of Sultan&#x27;s army, governed by the principle of &quot;makhzen&quot; in which land was granted to soldiers in exchange for military service. According to the historian Simon Pierre, &quot;After the Alaouite conquest, the people of the Maghreb had been despoiled and disarmed and, except for one Berber tribe and the Rifians, only the Abid al-Bukhari and the Udaya exercised the monopoly on violence. Thirty years later, at the death of Moulay Ismail in 1727, it was the caids of the Abid al-Bukhari and the Udaya who joined with the ulama of Meknes and the ministers to choose sultan Moulay Ahmed Adh-Dhahabî!&quot; However, other sources state that Moulay Ismail had designated him as his successor before his death. Regardless, during the period of anarchy after Ismail&#x27;s death, the Udaya certainly played a major role in deposing several Sultans along with the Abid al-Bukhari.

Additionally, Moulay Ismail was able to make use of European renegades&#x27; knowledge and experience of artillery, when he formed them into a military corps, Michael Peyron has noted the sultan employed renegade Spanish gunners to operate his cannon batteries, as it recorded during his conquest of Fêzzâz in 1692.

==== Defensive organisation ====

By the end of his reign, Ismail had built more than 76 kasbahs and military posts throughout his territory. Each kasbah was defended by a force of at least 100 soldiers drawn from the jaysh tribes or the Black Guard. Moroccan forces were stationed in all the major cities and provincial capitals. For example, there were 3,000 Cheraga, 4,500 Sherarda, and 2,000 Udaya stationed around Fez, which formed a defensive cordon against the unsubjugated Berber tribes in the area.

The kasbahs ensured the defence of the eastern border, where there was a heavy Moroccan military presence, but they also protected the main lines of communication within the kingdom and facilitated the control of unsubjugated tribes, by continuously raiding them.

===Diplomacy===

Morocco&#x27;s relations with the Ottoman Empire and its possessions in North Africa were often very strained. The two powers always distrusted one another and this was particularly true during Ismail&#x27;s reign. The Ottomans supported Ismail&#x27;s rivals within Morocco both financially and militarily, repeatedly mounting expeditions to support them. Conversely, Moulay Ismail led several invasions and raids of their territory, often with the

support of anti-Ottoman Arab tribes in Algeria, such as the Benu Amer. The two empires repeatedly signed peace treaties, notably in 1678, 1692, and 1693, none of which lasted very long. A final treaty, in 1701, held until the end of Ismail&#x27;s life.

Following the approach to foreign policy begun by Abu Marwan Abd al-Malik I, Moulay Ismail sought good relations with France and Great Britain to ensure trade relations. These relations centered on the sale of Christian sailors captured at sea by the Salé Rovers and others, but also the creation of military alliances. Moulay Ismail repeatedly sought French assistance in his wars with Spain, without success. However, an alliance with France and the Bey of Tunis against Algeria was arranged.

In 1682, Moulay Ismail sent Mohammad Temim on an embassy to France. He succeeded in negotiating a treaty of friendship between Morocco and France, which was signed at Saint-Germain-en-Laye. A request for the hand in marriage of Mlle de Nantes, one of Louis XIV&#x27;s illegitimate children, was not successful. A second embassy to France was led by Abdallah ben Aisha in 1699. However, the accession of Louis XIV&#x27;s grandson Philip to the Spanish throne in 1710 doomed this alliance, resulting in the breaking of diplomatic relations with France and Spain and the departure of the French and Spanish merchants and consuls from Morocco in 1718. The French diplomats considered Moulay Ismail extremely greedy. They complained that he undertook negotiations and 

made agreements solely to receive presents, denying whatever they had proposed once he had gotten what he wanted.Despite Ismail&#x27;s conquest of Tangier in 1684, the English supported him against the Spanish and signed several treaties of friendship and commerce. The English participated in the blockade of the Spanish port of Ceuta in 1704, during Ismail&#x27;s siege of the city. After the break of relations with France, Moroccan ties with Britain increased. Abdelkader Perez was sent to two embassies to Britain, in 1723 and 1737. Moulay Ismail also sent several embassies to James II after he was deposed, offering him aid and asking him to convert to Islam.

== Marriages, concubines, and children ==
Moulay Ismail was a serial polygamist. According to the writings of the French Trinitarian priest Father Dominique Busnot, Moulay Ismail had at least 500 concubines and at least 600 living children in 1704, which did not include his daughters by his four principle wives. Busot reports the rumor that any others were ordered to be strangled at birth. Historian Abd al-Rahman Ibn Zaydan recorded children of around 68 wedded wives and 8 unnamed slave concubines from the royal birth registers kept during the reign of Sidi Mohammed III. He specifies that upon Ismail&#x27;s death the full number of his wives and harem slave concubines was 700. The final total is uncertain: the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; claims 1042, with no source. Based on Busnot&#x27;s 1704 figures, Elisabeth Oberzaucher and Karl Grammer of the University of Vienna calculated Ismail could have fathered approximately 1171 children in a 32-year reproductive span. The historian Al Zayani, who was in charge of royal protocol under Sultan Sidi Mohammed III, recounts that with his own eyes he saw the exhaustive list of Moulay Ismail&#x27;s children and that his descendants occupied 500 houses in Sijilmasa. He also specified that the list to which he had access did not contain the names of Moulay Ismail&#x27;s children who had no descendants.

A partial restoration of Moulay Ismail&#x27;s descent through his wives and slave concubines is listed below. His first recorded marriage took place in 1670, the order of his nuptials are unclear after his first recorded spouse. Posterity did not remember many of the full names of his wives. And in accordance with Muslim traditions, slave concubines do not have a last name, they are renamed at the time of their conversion to Islam. Their birth names were not subject to meticulous safeguarding, which is why few of these women are identifiable by their birth name. The descendants of his wives who have a full name or biography are listed first, then those of his wives who do not have a full name, then a partial list of his descendants through his slave concubines:
* A daughter of a Saadi prince, married on 5 April 1670, at Dar Ben Chegra in Fez. According to Al Zayani it was during the month of Shawwal, while Ahmad ibn Khalid an-Nasiri states it took place 14 of Dhu al-Qadah 1080 in Islamic calendar. The wedding probably took place between the two dates thus March to 5 April 1670, AD, as royalty often had 7 days wedding. Whether they had issue is not stated.
* A daughter of Cheick Al-Lawati who was the widow of his half-brother Sultan Moulay Rashid. She is from the oriental Rif region, her father was Cheick of his Arab Maqil or Berber tribe. The wedding happened after 9 April 1672, but his date of marriage is unclear. Whether they had issues is not stated.
* Lalla Aisha Mubarka. The origins of this lady are unclear, initially, she was a &quot;jarya&quot; (slave concubine) of Sultan Moulay Rashid. Sources claim that Moulay Ismail brought her from his brother in the early 1670s and ended up marrying her. Lalla Aisha Mubarka or Zeydana was one of Moulay Ismail&#x27;s much-esteemed wives. She is described as a woman of great intuition. About her, Moulay Ismail was quoted saying that: &quot;she was wiser than most men&quot;. She had substantial influence over Ismail and sought to get her son Moulay Zeydan enthroned for many years before he was finally secretly executed by his father in 1708. They had several children among them Moulay Zeydan, Sultan Moulay Ahmad al-Dhahbi and Sultan Moulay Ali.
* Lalla Ma&#x27;azuza Malika. In the late 1720s John Braithwaite member of the British consulate in Morocco explains that Ma&#x27;azuza was not so much in the favors of Moulay Ismail. Their sons were Sultan Moulay Abdalmalik, Moulay Abd al Rahman and Moulay Hussein.
* Lalla Khanatha bint Bakkar, married in 1678. She is from the M&#x27;gharfa tribe of the Awlad Hassān, the aristocratic caste of the Beidane. Khnata bint Bakkar, daughter of the Grand Sheikh Bakkar of M&#x27;ghafra, was famous for her beauty, intelligence, and learning. Her family seat is in the region of Sbouya, commonly referred to as Oued Noun. Her children with Moulay Ismail are Moulay Mohammed, Moulay Hafiz, Moulay Mehrez, Moulay Mohammed al-Mutais and Sultan Moulay Abdallah.
* Lalla Alwa Benabiz. They had ten children seven sons and three daughters, one of them is Moulay Ṣafā (Muley Spha), he was Thomas Pellow&#x27;s first master.

* Princess Nassira el-Salwi bint Mohammed el-Heyba originally from Brakna, married the latter either in 1678/9 or in 1690. Whether they had descendants is not indicated.
* Lalla Halima Al Sufyaniyah, married around 1707 (Thomas Pellow accounts of her favorite son aged 8 circa 1715). She is from the Doukkala region and is the daughter of Cheikh Ali bin Hussein of Bani Sweid, from the Sufiyan tribe of Hilali Arab origins. Her son was Moulay Zeydan Seghir (born c. 1707).

Below the name Chaouia means an origin from Chaouia, a geographical area which can also be a tribe. A large number of Moulay Ismail&#x27;s wives were designated as &quot;Chaouia&quot;. Listed below is the descendants he had with his wives, of which only a part of their names are recorded: their tribal origins or their first name. It is unsure wheteher the women whom only their first name is given were all born free Muslims.

Many of his concubines are only fragmentary documented. As concubines, they were slave captives, sometimes from Europe. Here is list of children he had with some of his slave concubines from the harem, as well as the details known about their mother:

* Moulay Mohammed Alim and Moulay Cherif: their mother is al-Darah, a Spanish slave concubine. She was his favorite and Moulay Ismail educated himself their son Moulay Mohammed Alim, his once favorite son. Around 1702, Al-Darah tragically died strangled by Moulay Ismail whom Lalla Aisha had made believe she had betrayed him.

* Abd-al Hadi al Kabir, Abd-al Hadi Saghir: their mother is a slave concubine designated as &quot;ama&quot;.
* Youssef Saghir: his mother is a slave concubine designated as &quot;ama&quot;.
* A son, born to an English slave concubine Lalla Balqis (born 1670). She was captured by Barbary pirates in 1685, at the age of fifteen, while traveling with her mother to the Barbados. She was sold at the slave market in Morocco and given as a gift to the sultan. Converted to Islam under the name Balqis and included in his harem, she was one of Moulay Ismail&#x27;s favorites. She became a privileged and influential concubine. Her influence in the harem was so well known that she was among the harem women who received diplomatic gifts from the British ambassador Charles Stewart during his visit to Meknes in 1721.

An Irish woman by the name Mrs. Shaw, was at one point in her life a slave concubine of Moulay Ismail. She was brought to his harem after having been enslaved and was made to convert to Islam when the Sultan wished to have intercourse with her, but was manumitted and married off to a Spanish convert when the Sultan grew tired of her. The Spanish convert being very poor, she was described by contemporary witnesses as reduced to beggary, before she was helped by John Russell, the British consul general.

==Legacy==

After nearly a century of difficulty and division, Morocco had experienced peace under Moulay Ismail, who had pacified all parts of the country. His reign is considered a golden age in the country&#x27;s history, during which it experienced, security, tranquility, and order. The historian Ahmad ibn Khalid al-Nasiri, who recorded the whole history of Morocco in this period, declared: 
Moulay Ismail accomplished the political reunification of the whole country, the formation of its main military force – the Black Guard or Abid al-Bukhari, as well as the Jaysh al-Rifi, and recaptured several coastal cities from the Europeans. He had considerably extended Moroccan territory, and undertook an extraordinary amount of construction.

After Moulay Ismaïl&#x27;s death at the age of eighty (or around ninety by the 1634 birthdate) in 1727, there was another succession battle between his surviving sons. His successors continued with his building program, but in 1755 the huge palace compound at Meknes was severely damaged by an earthquake. By 1757 his grandson, Sidi Mohammad III moved the capital to Marrakesh.

Ismail ibn Sharif is mentioned in chapter 11 of Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot;. The character of the sultan in the novel &quot;The Sultan&#x27;s Wife&quot; by Jane Johnson is based on Moulay Ismaïl. In Marguerite Henry&#x27;s &quot;King of the Wind&quot; &quot;Sultan Mulai Ismael, Emperor of all Morocco&quot; sends six Arabian horses to Louis XV, &quot;the boy-King of France&quot;.

<doc id="147403" wikidata="Q211965" url="?curid=147403" title="The Moody Blues">
<text>The Moody Blues were an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1964. The band initially consisted of Graeme Edge (drums), Denny Laine (guitar/vocals), Mike Pinder (keyboards/vocals), Ray Thomas (multi-instrumentalist/vocals) and Clint Warwick (bass/vocals). Originally part of the British beat and R&amp;B scene of the early–mid 1960s, the band came to prominence with the UK No. 1 and US Top 10 single &quot;Go Now&quot; in late 1964/early 1965. Laine and Warwick both left the band in 1966, with Edge, Pinder and Thomas recruiting new members Justin Hayward (guitar/vocals) and John Lodge (bass/vocals). They embraced the psychedelic rock movement of the late 1960s, with their second album, 1967&#x27;s &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot;, being a fusion of rock with classical music (performed with the London Festival Orchestra) that established the band as pioneers in the development of art rock and progressive rock. It has been described as a &quot;landmark&quot; and &quot;one of the first successful concept albums&quot;.

The group released six more albums and toured extensively until they went on hiatus in 1974. Their records from this period were among the most successful in the progressive rock genre and produced FM radio hits such as &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; (1967; charting again in 1972), &quot;Tuesday Afternoon&quot; (1968), &quot;Question&quot; (1970), &quot;The Story in Your Eyes&quot; (1971), &quot;Isn&#x27;t Life Strange&quot; (1972) and &quot;I&#x27;m Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)&quot; (1973). After resuming activities in 1977, Pinder left the following year and was replaced by former Yes keyboardist Patrick Moraz. In the 1980s they took on a more synth-pop sound, having hits with &quot;Gemini Dream&quot; (1981), &quot;The Voice&quot; (1981), &quot;Your Wildest Dreams&quot; (1986) and &quot;I Know You&#x27;re Out There Somewhere&quot; (1988). &quot;Your Wildest Dreams&quot; made the Moody Blues the first act to earn each of its first three Top 10 singles in the United States in three different decades. Moraz departed in 1991, followed by Thomas in 2002. The band&#x27;s last studio album was the Christmas album &quot;December&quot; (2003), after which they decided against recording any further studio albums. They continued to tour throughout the 2000s and later reunited periodically for events, one-off concerts, short tours and cruises, until Graeme Edge, the last remaining original member, retired in 2018.

Warwick died in 2004, followed by Thomas in 2018, Edge in 2021, Laine in 2023 and Pinder in 2024.

The Moody Blues sold 70 million albums worldwide, including 18 platinum and gold LPs. They produced 16 studio albums, six of which made the US Top 20 (with two reaching No. 1) and eight of which made the UK Top 20 (with three reaching No. 1). They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018, for &quot;over 50 years of exhilarating and significant music that has influenced countless musicians and rocked fans around the world&quot;.

==Pre-history, 1958–1964==
In 1958, rock and roll band El Riot &amp; the Rebels formed in Birmingham, England, featuring vocalist and harmonica player Ray Thomas (&quot;El Riot&quot;) and bassist John Lodge. At the beginning of 1963 they were joined by keyboardist Mike Pinder, who had just returned home from time in the army. Other Birmingham rock and roll bands around during these years included Danny King &amp; the Dukes (formed 1958), with bassist Clint Warwick, Gerry Levine &amp; the Avengers (formed 1959), with drummer Graeme Edge and future Electric Light Orchestra member Roy Wood on guitar, and Denny &amp; the Diplomats (formed 1962), with vocalist and guitarist Denny Laine and another future ELO member, drummer Bev Bevan. El Riot &amp; the Rebels split when Lodge went to technical college in 1963, with Thomas and Pinder forming a new band, the Krew Kats.

At the end of 1963, after a disappointing spell in Hamburg, Germany, Thomas and Pinder began making plans to start a new band. Meanwhile, by the beginning of 1964, Warwick, Edge and Laine had all left their previous bands and begun working together in a new band, the R&amp;B Preachers.

==Early years, 1964–1967==
===Formation and early success===

Thomas and Pinder formed their new band in May 1964, recruiting Edge and Laine with the line-up completed by Warwick after Lodge turned down an offer to join; the other members intended to move to London as a professional band after a few local gigs, while he was still in college and determined to finish. The new band hoped to receive sponsorship from the local Mitchells &amp; Butlers Brewery (who owned numerous live music clubs), even naming themselves the M&amp;B5, though the sponsorship failed to materialise. The M&amp;B5 played their first live show a few days after their formation, at the Carlton Ballroom (later to become rock music venue Mothers) on Erdington High Street, where they became the resident band.

The band&#x27;s name quickly evolved from the M&amp;B5 to the Moody Blues. Aside from incorporating the M&amp;B letters, the name was also a subtle reference to the Duke Ellington song &quot;Mood Indigo&quot;. Pinder also stated in a later interview that, at the time, he was interested in how music can affect and change people&#x27;s moods. The &quot;Blues&quot; was also a reference to the band&#x27;s set at the time consisting mostly of rhythm and blues. During their first year together, as well as playing their own shows and making their own records, the Moodies (as they were often nicknamed by fans and the band themselves) also provided backing for various blues performers touring England, including Sonny Boy Williamson and Memphis Slim.
The Moody Blues moved to London in the summer of 1964. Soon after they arrived, the band obtained a management company, Ridgepride, formed by Alex Wharton (later known as Alex Murray), who had been in the A&amp;R division of Decca Records. They signed a recording contract with Ridgepride, who then leased their recordings to Decca. They released their first single, a cover of Bobby Parker&#x27;s &quot;Steal Your Heart Away&quot; with the Laine/Pinder original &quot;Lose Your Money (But Don&#x27;t Lose Your Mind)&quot; as the B-side, in September 1964. Despite some publicity, including an appearance on the cult television programme &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;, the single failed to chart. The band&#x27;s big breakthrough came with their second single, a cover of Bessie Banks&#x27; &quot;Go Now&quot;, released in November 1964. Promoted on television with one of the first purpose-made promotional films in the rock and pop era, it reached No. 1 in Britain (where it remains their only No. 1 single) and No. 10 in America, where it was released on London Records.

===Career struggles===

The band struggled to continue the success of &quot;Go Now&quot;. They enjoyed a minor British hit with a cover of the Drifters&#x27; &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Go On Without You&quot;, reaching No. 33 in February 1965. Wanting to capitalise quickly on the No. 1 hit, Decca had rush-released the single before the band had completed its recording (as Edge recalled in a 1978 interview regarding the track, &quot;there&#x27;s a great big bit in the middle where nothing happens, it was supposed to be Ray playing flute&quot;). &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Go On Without You&quot; was also included on a four-track EP, simply titled &quot;The Moody Blues&quot;, in April 1965 which reached No. 12 on the UK EP chart. The other tracks included were &quot;Go Now&quot;, &quot;Steal Your Heart Away&quot; and &quot;Lose Your Money&quot;.

Around this time Alex Wharton left the management firm, with the band&#x27;s next single, the Laine/Pinder original &quot;From the Bottom of My Heart (I Love You)&quot;, being produced by Denny Cordell, who would remain their producer into 1966. The single was released in May 1965 and did better than &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Go On Without You&quot;, reaching No. 22 in the UK.

In July 1965, the band released their first album, &quot;The Magnificent Moodies&quot;. It was a mix of rhythm and blues covers and Laine/Pinder originals, the latter showing more of a Merseybeat influence. The album also included a cover of the George and Ira Gershwin standard &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Necessarily So&quot;. The back cover featured a specially-written prose poem by Donovan. The band held a launch party for the album, with guests including George Harrison, Paul McCartney and Marianne Faithfull among others.

The day after the party, as Laine later recalled, &quot;we called up the Ridgepride office and said we needed £100 to pay for the drinks bill. They told us they would be right over to see us, but they never showed up. When we went around to the office we discovered they had closed it down and run to the hills, leaving us in the lurch!&quot;. Ridgepride left the band bankrupt with several debts, taking all the money earned from their records up to that point, including the No. 1 hit &quot;Go Now&quot;, with them.

Now without Ridgepride, the band signed directly to Decca Records in the UK and London Records in the US, with the Beatles&#x27; manager Brian Epstein taking on management of the Moody Blues. Their next single &quot;Everyday&quot;, another Laine/Pinder original, was released in October 1965. The single stalled at No. 44 in the UK, where the band would not release any more records for a year.

They were still in demand for live gigs though, and while their chart success was declining in the UK and North America, they were still successful in some other countries during this time, particularly France where their cover of Sonny Boy Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Bye Bye Bird&quot; from &quot;The Magnificent Moodies&quot; reached No. 3 when it was released as a single there in December 1965.

In early December 1965, the Moody Blues were the support band for the Beatles on what would ultimately be the Beatles&#x27; last British tour. The Moodies then spent late December 1965 into January 1966 on their first tour of North America. What could have been a valuable appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; had been booked prior to the tour; however, visa issues upon their arrival in New York City meant the band were unable to make any television appearances in the US during the tour, although the live concerts still went ahead.

===Departures of Warwick and Laine===
In July 1966, Warwick retired from the group and the music business. After unsuccessful attempts to recruit Klaus Voormann (who took up a simultaneous offer to join Manfred Mann instead) and the Who&#x27;s John Entwistle, the band hired Rod Clark as Warwick&#x27;s replacement on bass. At the beginning of October, Laine also left the band, followed by new member Clark a few days later. Shortly after Laine and Clark left, Epstein announced that he no longer represented the Moody Blues.

While the Moodies appeared to be disintegrating, Decca released their new single, &quot;Boulevard de la Madeleine&quot; with &quot;This Is My House (But Nobody Calls)&quot; as the B-side, just a few days after Laine&#x27;s departure was announced (the single had been released in the US in June 1966, though the A- and B-sides were switched for the UK release). A further single, &quot;Life&#x27;s Not Life&quot;, was issued in January 1967. This single&#x27;s release is often listed in discographies as being cancelled, though both promo and regular stock copies have been seen over the years. 

In the November 1966 issue of &quot;Hit Week&quot;, Dutch interviewers Hans van Rij and Emie Havers wrote an article saying that at the time Laine and Clark departed, the Moody Blues had been in the process of recording their second album, to be titled &quot;Look Out!&quot;, with Cordell still producing. The album was shelved and &quot;Really Haven&#x27;t Got the Time&quot; is the only song title mentioned in the article. In 2014 Cherry Red Records, on their Esoteric Records imprint, released a double CD edition of &quot;The Magnificent Moodies&quot; with a number of tracks from the attempted 1966 album included. Most of the songs for this second album were Laine/Pinder originals, with Tim Hardin&#x27;s &quot;Hang On to a Dream&quot; being the only cover.

Laine would go on to join Paul McCartney&#x27;s post-Beatles band Wings in 1971. Along with Paul and Linda McCartney, Laine was one of the three members to remain with Wings from their formation to their 1981 split.

===Arrival of Hayward and Lodge===
The three remaining members of the Moody Blues, Pinder, Thomas and Edge, assembled a new line-up in October 1966. The new members were bassist and vocalist (and ex-El Riot &amp; the Rebels member) John Lodge and guitarist and vocalist Justin Hayward. Hayward was formerly of the Wilde Three with famed UK singer Marty Wilde (father of future pop star Kim Wilde). He was recommended to Pinder by Eric Burdon of the Animals. Pinder phoned Hayward and was impressed when Hayward played him his single &quot;London Is Behind Me&quot; (released in January 1966) during their car ride to meet the other members in Esher.

Around this time &quot;Boulevard de la Madeleine&quot; became a hit single in Belgium and with the band&#x27;s commercial success floundering in the UK, they relocated there almost immediately after Hayward and Lodge joined.

By February 1967 the band had returned to the UK. Unable to get gigs, they had no choice but to play the cabaret circuit. This lasted only a short time and after a confrontation with an audience member at one show, who went backstage to berate the band on their performance, the band realised that continuing to play rhythm and blues covers without Laine, whose voice had been the best suited to that style, was not working (in a 2005 interview, Hayward stated that the band continued playing their biggest hit &quot;Go Now&quot; after he and Lodge joined, with different members attempting lead vocal, but that it never sounded right).

Although the band had only released original songs on record after &quot;The Magnificent Moodies&quot; in July 1965, the R&amp;B covers were still the main focus of their live show until this point, after which the band focused primarily on playing their own original songs, with Hayward bringing a new musical influence to the band with his folk-inspired songwriting style.

===Meeting Tony Clarke and move towards psychedelia===

In April 1967 they were introduced to Decca staff producer Tony Clarke, who produced the band&#x27;s next single, their first record with Hayward and Lodge, &quot;Fly Me High&quot; (written and sung by Hayward) with &quot;Really Haven&#x27;t Got the Time&quot; (written and sung by Pinder) as the B-side, released in May 1967. Sometimes known to fans as &quot;the Sixth Moodie&quot;, Clarke would remain the band&#x27;s producer for the next eleven years. &quot;Fly Me High&quot; picked up both radio airplay and favourable reviews, but failed to chart in the UK. The track showed elements of the folk rock and psychedelic styles that were pervading rock music during this time.

The band went further in the psychedelic direction on their next single, Pinder&#x27;s &quot;Love and Beauty&quot;, which was issued in September 1967. This too was not a UK hit, but was significant for being the first Moody Blues track to feature Mellotron, played by Pinder. Prior to the Moody Blues&#x27; formation, Pinder had worked for the company that manufactured the Mellotron, though he had not been able to afford one until 1967. Pinder&#x27;s Mellotron work would become a major part of the band&#x27;s sound for the next several years.

Primarily playing harmonica up to this point, Thomas had played flute on some of the group&#x27;s earlier recordings; however, it became a far more featured instrument from this point onwards as the psychedelic influences became stronger in the band&#x27;s music.

==Classic years, 1967–1974==
===&quot;Days of Future Passed&quot;===

By the autumn of 1967 the Moody Blues&#x27; contract with Decca Records was set to expire and they owed the label several thousand pounds in advances. They had the support, however, of Decca A&amp;R manager Hugh Mendl, who had been instrumental in the recent establishment of London/Decca&#x27;s new subsidiary imprint Deram Records. With Mendl&#x27;s backing, the Moody Blues were offered a deal to make a rock version of Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;New World Symphony&quot; to promote the company&#x27;s new Deramic Stereo Sound audio format in return for which the group would be forgiven their debt.

The Moody Blues agreed, but insisted that they be given artistic control of the project, and Mendl (as executive producer) was able to provide this despite Decca&#x27;s notoriously tight-fisted attitude to its artists. According to the band, Peter Knight, who had been assigned to arrange and conduct the orchestral interludes, came to see them play live before the recording and liked their newly written songs so much he preferred to work on an album of those rather than the Dvořák assignment. An album of the Moody Blues&#x27; own new material was undertaken instead, with Decca/Deram executives not finding out about the change of plan until after the album was finished.

The Decca/Deram executives were initially sceptical about the hybrid style of the resulting concept album. Released in November 1967, &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; peaked at No. 27 on the British LP chart. Five years later it reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart in the US. The LP was a song cycle or concept album that takes place over the course of a single day. The album drew inspiration in production and arrangement from the pioneering use of classical instrumentation by the Beatles, to whom Pinder had recommended the Mellotron in 1965 (the Beatles first used the instrument on their 1966 album &quot;Revolver&quot;, specifically the track &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, and would continue to use it sporadically for the next two years, while the Moodies&#x27; Decca/London labelmates the Rolling Stones used Mellotron heavily on their 1967 album &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; and its preceding single &quot;We Love You&quot;). It took the idea of rock/classical fusion to new heights, using the London Festival Orchestra to provide an orchestral linking framework to the group&#x27;s already written and performed songs, plus overture and conclusion sections on the album, including backing up Graeme Edge&#x27;s opening and closing poems.

The orchestra and band never performed together during the recording. With the exception of the overdubbed strings on the latter part of Hayward&#x27;s &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot;, the orchestral sounds on the band&#x27;s own songs were actually played by Pinder on Mellotron. Despite being a lush concept album, it was recorded in a very workmanlike manner, with the band recording a particular song, then the track being presented to Peter Knight who quickly composed a suitable &quot;linking&quot; orchestral portion, which he and the orchestra then recorded. The album was as much an original work by Knight himself as the group. The composing credit for the whole album was listed as Redwave/Knight (Redwave being a made-up collective name for the five Moody Blues), although &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; and &quot;Tuesday Afternoon&quot; were written by Hayward, &quot;Dawn Is a Feeling&quot; and &quot;The Sun Set&quot; were written by Pinder, &quot;Another Morning&quot; and &quot;Twilight Time&quot; were written by Thomas, &quot;Peak Hour&quot; and &quot;Evening (Time to Get Away)&quot; were written by Lodge, and the opening and closing poems, &quot;Morning Glory&quot; and &quot;Late Lament&quot;, were written by Edge. The lead vocal on each track was provided by its writer, with the exception of &quot;Dawn Is a Feeling&quot;, which was sung by Hayward (although Pinder sang lead on the bridge section), and the two poems which were recited by Pinder.

Together with Tony Clarke, engineer Derek Varnals also contributed heavily to the creation of the Moody Blues&#x27; classic studio sound, working with Pinder and Clarke to create a more symphonic overlapping sound on the Mellotron as opposed to the sharp &#x27;cut off&#x27; the instrument normally gave, partly achieved by removing all the &quot;sound effects&quot; tapes (trains, whistles, cockerel crowing, etc.) and then &#x27;doubling up&#x27; the tapes of orchestral instruments&#x27; sounds, which combined with Pinder&#x27;s knowledge of the instrument and ability at playing it, and Clarke and Varnals&#x27; recording skills, created an orchestral &#x27;wave&#x27; sound that characterised the Moody Blues&#x27; music thereafter.

&quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; — despite eventually becoming a legendary classic — was very slow to gain popularity. It was released as a single from the album and made No. 19 in the UK in late 1967/early 1968. It would eventually make No. 9 in the UK on re-issue in December 1972 and No. 14 on the charts in another re-issue at the end of 1979 — by which time it had been covered by several artists, including Eric Burdon and War, Giorgio Moroder, The Dickies and eventually by various non-English-language artists, including Franck Pourcel, Dalida, Tommy Körberg, and I Nomadi., and American Bettye LaVette. Likewise, in the US, &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; did not make the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on its original release as a single in 1968 (&quot;bubbling under&quot; at No. 103), although it reached No. 2 on re-release in 1972. It is now regarded as the Moody Blues&#x27; signature song. In the US &quot;Tuesday Afternoon&quot; was also released as a single and was more successful on initial release, peaking at No. 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

===&quot;In Search of the Lost Chord&quot;===

The band&#x27;s next album, 1968&#x27;s &quot;In Search of the Lost Chord&quot;, included &quot;Legend of a Mind&quot;, a song written by Ray Thomas in tribute to LSD guru Timothy Leary which encompassed a flute solo performed by Thomas – four members of the group had taken LSD together for the first time in early 1967. Lodge provided a two-part song &quot;House of Four Doors&quot; set either side of Thomas&#x27;s epic piece. Hayward began playing sitar and incorporating it into Moody Blues music (&quot;Voices in the Sky&quot;, &quot;Visions of Paradise&quot;, &quot;Om&quot;), having been inspired by George Harrison. Hayward&#x27;s &quot;Voices in the Sky&quot; charted as a single in the UK (No. 27), as did Lodge&#x27;s &quot;Ride My See-Saw&quot; (No. 42, No. 15 in France), which featured a non-album track, Pinder&#x27;s &quot;A Simple Game&quot;, as the B-side.

Pinder contributed &quot;The Best Way to Travel&quot; and album&#x27;s closer &quot;Om&quot;. Graeme Edge found a significant secondary role in the band as a writer of poetry, with all their late 1960s albums beginning with various band members reciting poems by Edge that were conceptually related to the lyrics of the songs that followed. Edge narrated his brief &quot;Departure&quot; poem on &quot;Lost Chord&quot;, although Pinder recited the majority of Edge&#x27;s poetry, as according to Edge, he had the best voice for it due to &quot;smoking more cigarettes and drinking more whisky at the time&quot;. &quot;In Search of the Lost Chord&quot; was the band&#x27;s first album to feature artwork by Phil Travers, whose striking surreal scenic imagery would continue for all their albums through to 1972&#x27;s &quot;Seventh Sojourn&quot;.

===&quot;On the Threshold of a Dream&quot;===

The band released two albums in 1969. The first, &quot;On the Threshold of a Dream&quot;, became their first No. 1 album in the UK. It opened with Hayward, Edge and Pinder sharing narration on Edge&#x27;s &quot;In the Beginning&quot;, leading into Hayward&#x27;s &quot;Lovely to See You&quot;. His &quot;Never Comes the Day&quot; was issued as a UK single, while Thomas contributed wry observations of life in &quot;Dear Diary&quot; and &quot;Lazy Day&quot;. Pinder contributed the closing track on side one, &quot;So Deep Within You&quot;. Side two closed with the &quot;Dream Sequence&quot;, Edge&#x27;s poem &quot;The Dream&quot; leading into Pinder&#x27;s &quot;Have You Heard?&quot; parts I and II with the two parts separated by his classically themed instrumental piece &quot;The Voyage&quot;.

===&quot;To Our Children&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Children&quot;===
The band&#x27;s music continued to become more complex and symphonic, with heavy amounts of reverberation on the vocal tracks. The second album of 1969, &quot;To Our Children&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Children&quot;, was a concept album inspired by the first Moon landing. The album peaked at No. 2 on the UK charts. The opening track, &quot;Higher and Higher&quot;, saw Pinder simulate a rocket blast-off on keyboards, then narrate Edge&#x27;s lyrics. Thomas contributed the songs &quot;Floating&quot; and &quot;Eternity Road&quot;, while Hayward provided &quot;Gypsy&quot; and the album included a Lodge/Pinder collaboration, &quot;Out and In&quot;.

Lodge provided his two-part &quot;Eyes of a Child&quot; and &quot;Candle of Life&quot;, while Pinder contributed &quot;Sun Is Still Shining&quot;. The album closed with its only single, &quot;Watching and Waiting&quot;, sung by Hayward and composed by him and Thomas. It was during 1969 that the band established their own label Threshold Records under licence to Decca Records. &quot;To Our Children&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Children&quot; was the first of their albums to be released on their own label.

===&quot;A Question of Balance&quot;===

Although the Moodies had by now defined themselves with a lush, atmospheric and high-production psychedelic style, which had been an influence on the then-burgeoning progressive rock genre, by 1970 the band were finding it difficult to recreate their sound in concert and decided to record an album that could be played live more easily, losing some of their lush sound for their first album of the 1970s, &quot;A Question of Balance&quot;. This album, No. 1 in the UK and No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart in the US, was indicative of the band&#x27;s growing success in America.

Hayward&#x27;s &quot;Question&quot; was issued as a single, reaching No. 2 in the UK. Pinder&#x27;s &quot;Melancholy Man&quot; would be released as a single in France, reaching No. 1 there. Hayward began an artful exploration of guitar tone through the use of numerous effects pedals and fuzzboxes and developed for himself a very melodic buzzing guitar-solo sound. The Moody Blues had by now become a bill-topping act in their own right and appeared at both the 1969 and 1970 Isle of Wight Festivals (an album and DVD of their 1970 performance would be released in 2008).

===&quot;Every Good Boy Deserves Favour&quot;===
The title of the band&#x27;s next album, 1971&#x27;s &quot;Every Good Boy Deserves Favour&quot;, was derived from a mnemonic used to remember the musical notes that form the lines of the treble clef: EGBDF. One of the Moodies&#x27; most experimental albums, the opening track, &quot;Procession&quot;, depicted the &quot;evolution&quot; of music, leading into Hayward&#x27;s &quot;The Story in Your Eyes&quot;, which was released as a single in the US where it reached No. 23. &quot;Procession&quot; is the only Moody Blues song credited to the entire band (not counting the Redwave credit on &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot;).

Lodge&#x27;s contributions included &quot;Emily&#x27;s Song&quot;, written for his newly born daughter, while Thomas&#x27;s reflective &quot;Our Guessing Game&quot; and whimsical &quot;Nice to Be Here&quot; offset the deeper drama of Hayward&#x27;s &quot;You Can Never Go Home&quot;, Lodge&#x27;s &quot;One More Time to Live&quot; and Pinder&#x27;s &quot;My Song&quot;. Edge started writing lyrics intended to be sung, rather than verses to be spoken – his &quot;After You Came&quot; featured each of the other four members taking a vocal section. The album saw the band moving away from the Mellotron as their primary keyboard instrument, with the synthesizer starting to take its place. The album was also one of the earliest records to feature electronic drums, played by Edge.

&quot;Every Good Boy Deserves Favour&quot; became the band&#x27;s second consecutive, and third overall, No. 1 album in the UK and reached No. 2 in the US, their highest album chart placement there so far.

===&quot;Seventh Sojourn&quot;===
In 1972, the band returned to the more lush sound of their late 1960s albums with &quot;Seventh Sojourn&quot;, which became their first album to reach No. 1 in the US, and reached No. 5 in the UK. The album saw Pinder using the new Chamberlin instrument. His stirring lament &quot;Lost in a Lost World&quot; opened the album, while he also contributed a sympathetic ode to Timothy Leary, &quot;When You&#x27;re a Free Man&quot;. The album also included one of Thomas&#x27;s most popular songs, &quot;For My Lady&quot;.

Lodge&#x27;s songs &quot;Isn&#x27;t Life Strange&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)&quot; (the latter written in response to some of the band&#x27;s hippie fans, who mistook the Moodies as spiritual leaders due to the philosophical themes of many of their lyrics) were lifted as singles from &quot;Seventh Sojourn,&quot; both reaching the Top 40 in the UK and US.

===Other early 1970s developments===
In an interview following the release of &quot;Seventh Sojourn&quot;, Edge told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;We&#x27;ve got two Christians, one Mystic, one Pedantic and one Mess, and we all get on a treat.&quot;

By this time, other bands were picking up their work. Pinder&#x27;s songs &quot;A Simple Game&quot; (1968) and &quot;So Deep Within You&quot; (1969) were successfully covered by the Four Tops, with the former winning Pinder an Ivor Novello Award. Elkie Brooks later covered Hayward&#x27;s &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot;. Pinder also appeared on John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot; album in 1971, providing additional percussion on &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Be a Soldier (I Don&#x27;t Want to Die)&quot;.

In late 1972, a re-issue of the five-year-old &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; became the Moody Blues&#x27; biggest US hit, reaching No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and becoming a certified million-seller; the song had &quot;bubbled under&quot; the Hot 100 charts on its original release. The song also returned to the UK charts, reaching No. 9, ten places higher than its original release in 1967.

===Threshold Records===
The Moodies were one of the earliest rock acts to start their own label, following the Beatles&#x27; Apple Records. In 1969 they created Threshold Records, prompted in part by disputes with Decca over album design costs (their gatefold record jackets and expensive cover art were not popular with company executives). The idea was for Threshold to produce new albums and deliver them to Decca in the UK and London in the US who would act as distributor.

The group attempted to build Threshold into a major label by developing new talent – most notably the UK hard rock band Trapeze (featuring future Deep Purple member Glenn Hughes, future Whitesnake member Mel Galley and future Judas Priest member Dave Holland) and the US classical-acoustic sextet Providence – but these efforts were unsuccessful and the Moodies eventually stopped recruiting new acts to the label, and by the late 1970s would return themselves to more traditional recording contracts.

However, they helped lay the groundwork, with other major rock bands forming their own record labels during the 1970s, including the Rolling Stones (Rolling Stones Records), Deep Purple (Purple Records) and Led Zeppelin (Swan Song Records). All of the Moodies&#x27; records from 1969 to 2001 bore the Threshold logo on at least one of their format versions.

===Post-&quot;Seventh Sojourn&quot;===
In September 1973, the Moody Blues were presented with five gold discs in Australia. At the time, Australia had only ever awarded eight.

In 1973 the band recorded a new Hayward song called &quot;Island&quot;, with the intention of it kick-starting work on their next album; however, in the spring of 1974, after completing a vast world tour that culminated with a tour of Asia, the group decided to take an extended hiatus. By 1974, ten years of continuous working together had led to personal communication between the band members being at a low ebb, while some members of the band were needing a break from the increasingly bigger and more straining tours. Later that year, the band oversaw preparation of a compilation album, &quot;This Is The Moody Blues&quot;, which was released in October 1974.

The track &quot;Island&quot; would not see release until 2007, when it was included on the CD/SACD re-release of &quot;Seventh Sojourn&quot;.

==Hiatus and solo work, 1974–1977==
Hayward and Lodge released a duo album, the successful &quot;Blue Jays&quot; in 1975, followed by a UK No. 8 charting non-album single, &quot;Blue Guitar&quot;, featuring 10cc as the backing band. The album had originally been intended as a Hayward and Pinder collaboration, but after Pinder dropped out, Lodge stepped in, with Tony Clarke producing.

Pinder said he hoped to get the band back together that year. &quot;Having moved to California in 1974, I returned to Britain for a visit in summer 1975. I was trying to get the band to do an album, but the response was so weak I returned to California with my two new Mk5 Mellotrons and began work on my solo album &quot;The Promise&quot;.&quot; &quot;The Promise&quot; was released in 1976.

Edge released two albums as the Graeme Edge Band, with Adrian Gurvitz on vocals and guitar and his brother Paul Gurvitz on bass, 1975&#x27;s &quot;Kick Off Your Muddy Boots&quot; and 1976&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Ballroom&quot;.

Thomas released two solo albums, both written in collaboration with songwriter Nicky James, &quot;From Mighty Oaks&quot; in 1975 and &quot;Hopes, Wishes and Dreams&quot; in 1976.

Following a successful UK tour as a duo, backed by some of the members of Providence, Hayward and Lodge both released solo albums in 1977, &quot;Songwriter&quot; (Hayward) and &quot;Natural Avenue&quot; (Lodge).

In 1976, Hayward recorded &quot;Forever Autumn&quot; for &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s Musical Version of The War of the Worlds&quot; at London&#x27;s Advision Studios. The album was released in 1978, with the song being released as a single and reaching No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart in August that year.

==Reunion, 1977–1991==
===&quot;Octave&quot; and departure of Pinder===
In 1977, the group made a decision to record together again, with their record company Decca urging a reunion album. Decca in the UK and London in the US released &quot;Caught Live + 5&quot; in 1977, a double album with three sides of a December 1969 live recording from the Royal Albert Hall and one side of five leftover studio tracks from the late 1960s. Decca/London did this in an attempt to revive interest in the Moody Blues before their anticipated new album, although the band themselves were not pleased by the release of &quot;Caught Live + 5&quot;, having already deemed it not good enough to be released when it was assembled several years earlier.

By this time, Pinder had remarried and started a family in California, so for their reunion recording, the band decamped stateside with producer Clarke. The sessions were marked by tension and division: first there was a fire at the studios they were using, then after quickly relocating to Pinder&#x27;s home studio, a landslide following torrential rains effectively marooned them, inevitably causing tensions to rise.

Clarke had to leave for personal reasons before the album was completed, but by the spring of 1978 &quot;Octave&quot; was ready for release. Pinder, citing his young family, excused himself from the touring commitments that were to follow. His decision caused acrimony within the band (particularly from Edge). Ray Thomas said Pinder was initially agreeable to touring. His opting out (with a major comeback tour already planned) was a blow to the band. Their management tried to downplay Pinder&#x27;s absence, notably at a major UK music press party Decca organised, when the top Decca dignitary guest, while making a &quot;welcome back&quot; speech, openly referred to &quot;Mike Pinder being currently absent over in the States&quot;, much to the band&#x27;s dismay.

===Arrival of Moraz, &quot;Long Distance Voyager&quot; and &quot;The Present&quot;===

Former Yes keyboardist Patrick Moraz joined the Moody Blues for the Octave World Tour. The album sold well and produced two minor hits in &quot;Steppin&#x27; in a Slide Zone&quot; (No. 39 in the US) and &quot;Driftwood&quot; (No. 59 in the US).

The Moody Blues toured the US and Europe during much of 1979. By 1980 they were ready to record again, this time bringing in producer Pip Williams. Moraz was retained as the band&#x27;s permanent keyboardist, though Pinder had originally understood that he would continue to record even if not touring with the band. Pinder took legal action to prevent the new Moody Blues album from release without his contributions but was not successful, and ultimately, never returned to the band.

When released in 1981, &quot;Long Distance Voyager&quot; became one of the band&#x27;s most successful albums, reaching No. 1 in the US and No. 7 in the UK. The album yielded two US Top 20 hits, &quot;The Voice&quot; (No. 15) written by Hayward, and &quot;Gemini Dream&quot; (No. 12) written by Hayward and Lodge. Lodge&#x27;s &quot;Talking Out of Turn&quot; also charted in the US, reaching No. 65. Edge provided &quot;22,000 Days&quot; (featuring Thomas on lead vocal) while Thomas&#x27;s contributions were the closing trilogy of &quot;Painted Smile&quot;, &quot;Reflective Smile&quot; (a poem recited by a DJ friend of the band) and the tongue-in-cheek self-parody &quot;Veteran Cosmic Rocker&quot;. By now, the Mellotron had long been set aside as their primary keyboard instrument on their studio work and the band embraced a more high-tech, less symphonic approach, though still retaining a lush keyboard-led sound, with Moraz a virtuoso player who also had extensive knowledge of synthesizers. In live concerts, the Mellotron was still used heavily by Moraz until the mid-1980s, including on songs that did not originally feature it.

The next album, 1983&#x27;s &quot;The Present&quot;, again produced by Williams, was less successful than its predecessor, though it spawned a UK Top 40 hit in &quot;Blue World&quot; and a US Top 40 hit in &quot;Sitting at the Wheel&quot;. The band also began to embrace the new MTV phenomenon, with the videos for &quot;Blue World&quot; and &quot;Sitting at the Wheel&quot; going into rotation on the channel. &quot;The Present&quot; was released in conjunction with Talencora Ltd shortly before Decca was bought out by Polydor Records. The album was supported by a 1983–1984 tour, which included the band&#x27;s first ever tour of Australia in 1984.

===&quot;The Other Side of Life&quot; and &quot;Sur La Mer&quot;===
In 1986 they enjoyed renewed success with their album &quot;The Other Side of Life&quot; and in particular with the track &quot;Your Wildest Dreams&quot; – a US Top 10 hit (and No. 1 on Billboard&#x27;s Adult Contemporary singles chart for two weeks). The song&#x27;s video garnered a &quot;Billboard&quot; Video of the Year award after being frequently featured on MTV. It was the first of three albums with producer Tony Visconti, best known for his extensive work with T. Rex and David Bowie, who together with synth programmer Barry Radman delivered a modern sound the Moodies had been seeking in order to remain competitive with their pop contemporaries. The album&#x27;s title song also charted in the US at No. 58.

The Moody Blues performed live at the Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert 1986, which raised money for Birmingham Children&#x27;s Hospital. The band played four songs, and later provided backup with Electric Light Orchestra for George Harrison. Other performers included Robert Plant and former Moodie Denny Laine (whose set included &quot;Go Now&quot;).

The Moodies continued their MTV success with 1988&#x27;s &quot;Sur La Mer&quot; with its single and video, &quot;I Know You&#x27;re Out There Somewhere&quot; (No. 30 US, No. 52 UK, No. 2 US Mainstream Rock), a sequel to &quot;Your Wildest Dreams&quot;. Their sound took on an ever-increasingly synthetic and technical quality as Moraz and Visconti began using modern sequencers, samplers and drum machines. All the songs were written and sung by Hayward and/or Lodge, as the band came under pressure from their new record company, Polydor Records, who deemed them to be the members who wrote the most commercial songs and had the most commercial voices. This approach stood in stark contrast to the more equitable five-way songwriting the group had employed during the late 1960s and the 1970s.

By this point, Ray Thomas was playing a diminished role in the recording studio, with the emphasis now being placed on Hayward and Lodge as singers and songwriters and the band&#x27;s sound having evolved towards synthpop, a genre that was unsuitable for the use of instruments such as flute and harmonica. Thomas did not contribute any songs to &quot;The Other Side of Life&quot; or &quot;Sur La Mer&quot; and was largely relegated to the status of a backup singer, although for &quot;Sur La Mer&quot;, while Thomas did provide backing vocals, multiple production considerations led Visconti to leave them off the album completely.

Despite his diminished participation in the recording process, Thomas&#x27;s high value remained evident on stage, primarily from many of his songs from the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s being popular with die-hard fans and still featured in the setlist, and also in the flute and keyboard duets he composed with Moraz which were performed only during Moody Blues concerts. The band reinforced its concert sound in 1986 with the addition of a second keyboardist. Bias Boshell was the first, replaced in 1987 by Guy Allison before Boshell returned by 1990. The group also began to employ female backing singers.

On 5 May 1990, Hayward and Lodge performed the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Across the Universe&quot; at a star-studded John Lennon tribute concert in Liverpool.

==Later years, 1991–2018==
===Departure of Moraz and Court TV lawsuit===
In 1991, during the recording of their new studio album, Patrick Moraz gave an interview with &quot;Keyboard&quot; magazine and made some comments in the article that suggested dissatisfaction with his role in the Moodies. His complaints ranged from the Moodies&#x27; music becoming too simple in structure to the other members&#x27; reluctance to allow him to make significant contributions to the songwriting on their albums. He also was occupied with spending large amounts of time planning a music concert to celebrate his native Switzerland&#x27;s 700th anniversary instead of rehearsing with the Moodies — and as a result, he was fired from the group before the project was completed, so Boshell and new keyboardist Paul Bliss were brought in to finish the new album&#x27;s keyboard tracks.

Despite having been credited and publicly presented as an official band member since he joined them in 1978, the Moody Blues have downplayed Moraz&#x27;s place in their history since his departure, saying he was a backing musician and never a member of the band. All Moody Blues compilation albums released post-Moraz have credited him as an &quot;additional musician&quot; on the tracks he was part of, sometimes going so far as to include Moraz-era photos in their artwork with him cropped or airbrushed out of the photos.

This attitude towards Moraz began when he took legal action against the band in 1992, claiming that in 1980 he and the other members had made an agreement that, like them, he was a &quot;lifetime member&quot; of the Moody Blues and could not be fired. The lawsuit was shown on Court TV, but Moraz was awarded only $77,175 in back pay due to accounting delays instead of the $500,000 he sought.

===&quot;Keys of the Kingdom&quot; and &quot;Strange Times&quot;===
&quot;Keys of the Kingdom&quot;, released in 1991, had modest commercial success, peaking at No. 54 on the UK Albums Chart. Once again, Hayward&#x27;s songs led off the album, with the new singles &quot;Say It with Love&quot; and &quot;Bless the Wings (That Bring You Back)&quot;. The album also included Thomas&#x27;s first writing contributions since &quot;The Present&quot; in 1983, with an ambient flute piece, &quot;Celtic Sonant&quot;, and the closing track &quot;Never Blame the Rainbows for the Rain&quot;, co-written with Hayward. Lodge contributed three songs, &quot;Magic&quot;, the ballad &quot;Lean on Me (Tonight)&quot; and the Lennonesque &quot;Shadows on the Wall&quot;. Tony Visconti produced some of the tracks on the album, as did Christopher Neil and Alan Tarney. The ensuing tour saw them invited to play at the 1991 Montreux Jazz Festival, with a DVD of their performance released in 2005, followed by an album release in 2021.

The group remained a steady concert draw, and the album and video of their 1992 &quot;Night at Red Rocks&quot; concert enjoyed great success, particularly as a fund-raiser for public television in the US, where it had been first broadcast. The concert marked the first time the band had ever performed live with an orchestra. The Colorado Symphony Orchestra was conducted by Larry Baird, who was also the arranger for the show.

The group also continued their use of additional musicians on stage and in the studio. Following on from his contributions as keyboardist on the &quot;Keys of the Kingdom&quot; album, Paul Bliss continued to play keyboards for the band live, being promoted to first keyboardist in 2001 (but was replaced in March 2010 after 19 years&#x27; continuous service). Thomas and Bliss continued the tradition of a flute/keyboard duet for many tours. After Edge injured himself in 1991, second drummer Gordon Marshall was brought in to back him up; he stayed with the group after Edge returned and remained in the position until autumn 2015, when he left to play in a Moody Blues cover band, Legend of a Band, and another cover band, Reflections.

After the release of &quot;A Night at Red Rocks&quot;, the group took a break from recording and spent time trying to perfect the art of performing live with an orchestra. 1994 saw the release of the band&#x27;s retrospective box set &quot;Time Traveller&quot;. In 1999 the Moodies&#x27; recording hiatus ended with the release of the album &quot;Strange Times&quot;, their first in almost two decades to be well received by British critics, although Justin Hayward was quoted as saying he was disappointed at the album&#x27;s chart performance—it spent one week on the UK Albums Chart, at No. 92, and then dropped out.

It was recorded in Recco, Italy, at Hayward&#x27;s suggestion, and was the band&#x27;s first self-produced effort. The album featured keyboards and arrangements from Italian musician Danilo Madonia, who continued to work in-studio with the band.

The album opened with &quot;English Sunset&quot;, a pop song featuring a modern, nearly techno arrangement. &quot;Strange Times&quot; was also the first album since &quot;A Question of Balance&quot; in 1970 to include a new poem by Graeme Edge, &quot;Nothing Changes&quot;, recited by Edge, with Hayward then singing the concluding portion of the track, and notably concluded by quoting Mike Pinder&#x27;s 1968 song title &quot;A Simple Game&quot;. Ray Thomas appeared vocally with Hayward and Lodge on &quot;Sooner or Later (Walkin&#x27; on Air)&quot; and his own brief song &quot;My Little Lovely&quot;, plus provided a vocal snippet and backing vocals on &quot;English Sunset&quot;.

In 1999, the Moody Blues appeared in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Viva Ned Flanders&quot;. In the following year they released &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;, a new live album from a concert at the Royal Albert Hall (with the World Festival Orchestra), with a concurrent DVD release. This was taken from the last tour on which Boshell played. He left the live line-up in 2001; Bliss took over first keyboard duties, with his former second keyboard role filled by Bernie Barlow, with Julie Ragins replacing Barlow when she took maternity leave from 2006 to 2009.

In 2001 an IMAX film, &quot;Journey into Amazing Caves&quot;, was released, featuring two new songs written and performed by the Moody Blues. The soundtrack also featured Justin Hayward on vocals and guitar throughout. One of these songs, entitled &quot;Water&quot;, is the Moody Blues&#x27; first instrumental studio recording since their 1983 piece &quot;Hole in the World&quot; from &quot;The Present&quot;.

===Departure of Thomas and &quot;December&quot;===
The new millennium saw the Moody Blues reducing their touring schedule. At the end of 2002, founding member Ray Thomas retired from the group, reducing the Moody Blues to a trio of Hayward, Lodge and Edge, the last being the only original member. Flautist and rhythm guitarist Norda Mullen was recruited early the following year for their North American tour, and worked with the band live and in the studio thereafter. Toward the end of 2003, they released a Christmas album, &quot;December&quot;. The songs included originals and four covers: John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot;, Mike Batt&#x27;s &quot;A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, Johnny Mathis&#x27; &quot;When A Child is Born&quot; and Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;White Christmas&quot;. &quot;December&quot; would ultimately be the Moody Blues&#x27; last studio recording.

Clint Warwick, the Moody Blues&#x27; original bassist, died on 15 May 2004, at the age of 63.

November 2005 brought a new live album and DVD, &quot;Lovely to See You: Live&quot;, recorded and filmed at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles on 11 June that year.

During 2006 and 2007, the band&#x27;s &quot;Core Seven&quot; albums (the seven albums from the arrival of Hayward and Lodge in 1966 to the band&#x27;s hiatus in 1974) were re-released as hybrid CD/SACD editions, featuring rare and previously unreleased bonus tracks. The first five appeared in 2006, with &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot;, &quot;In Search of the Lost Chord&quot; and &quot;To Our Children&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Children&quot; being double CD/SACDs, while &quot;On the Threshold of a Dream&quot; and &quot;A Question of Balance&quot; were single CD/SACDs. &quot;Every Good Boy Deserves Favour&quot; and &quot;Seventh Sojourn&quot; followed in 2007, both single CD/SACD. The project was undertaken by Justin Hayward, who stated that he listened to virgin vinyl copies of these albums and used them as reference points for the new mixes. On 21 May 2007 the Moodies released a double CD of BBC Radio sessions titled &quot;Live at the BBC 1967–1970&quot;.

===Final years===

In 2007, the now defunct Hard Rock Park theme park in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, announced the building of a dark ride entitled &quot;Nights in White Satin: The Trip&quot;. The ride incorporated multi-sensory experiences as well as a re-orchestrated version of the song by Hayward. A re-recorded version of Edge&#x27;s &quot;Late Lament&quot; followed, which had each group member reading a verse of the poem. In March 2009, the ride closed because of the conversion of the park to the Freestyle Music Park, with the new owners desiring to make the park more &quot;family friendly&quot;.

The group toured the UK, US and Canada from 2006 to 2010. In addition, Hayward took part in the UK tour of &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s Musical Version of The War of the Worlds&quot; in April 2006, with a second tour in November 2007, and further dates in 2009. The Moody Blues also toured Australia and New Zealand in 2005. The band added keyboardist Alan Hewitt for their 2010 UK and North American tours.

The Moody Blues&#x27; classic producer Tony Clarke died in January 2010.

The band released a new compilation album called &quot;Timeless Flight&quot; in 2013. On 19 July 2013, it was announced that the band would be appearing on the second annual Moody Blues Cruise, from 2 to 7 April 2014, on the cruise ship &quot;MSC Divina&quot;. Other bands on the cruise included the Zombies and Lighthouse.

The Moody Blues toured the UK and US in 2015, culminating in a début appearance at Glastonbury Festival on 27 June. The band celebrated the 50th anniversary of &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; in 2017 by performing the album in its entirety on tour, together with other songs from the band&#x27;s history. The 2017 tour included a performance at Toronto’s Sony Centre, which was recorded and then released in 2018 as a new live album and DVD, &quot;Days of Future Passed Live.&quot;

Ray Thomas died on 4 January 2018, at the age of 76, just a few months before the band was due to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==Post-2018==
Graeme Edge died on 11 November 2021, at the age of 80. Upon Edge&#x27;s death, Justin Hayward announced that the Moody Blues had gone inactive after Edge had retired in 2018. Edge was the only member to remain with the band throughout their entire history.

Denny Laine, the Moody Blues&#x27; original singer and guitarist, died on 5 December 2023, at the age of 79.

Mike Pinder, the last surviving original member of the band, died on 24 April 2024, at the age of 82.

Rod Clark, Justin Hayward, John Lodge, and Patrick Moraz all remain active in music.

==Legacy and honours==
The Moody Blues&#x27; &quot;rich symphonic sound&quot; influenced groups such as Yes, Genesis, the Electric Light Orchestra and Deep Purple. They also helped make synthesizers and philosophy &quot;part of the rock mainstream&quot;.

The Moody Blues are members of the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. In 2013, readers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; voted for them as one of the ten bands that should be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; called them &quot;perennial victims of an unaccountable snubbing&quot; and inducted them into its own Hall of Fame in 2014.

Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2015, Rob Chapman described the band as &quot;psychedelia&#x27;s forgotten heroes&quot;. He stated: &quot;Despite their success, rock critics rarely took the Moody Blues seriously, a pattern that continued for the next 45 years.&quot; He also wrote: &quot;Despite the critical disapproval, the best of the Moody Blues music between 1967 and 1970 possessed grace and beauty. Like the Beatles, they understood how pop songs worked as ensemble pieces. None of them were particularly virtuosic or showy as musicians and their music is refreshingly free of the noodling long[u]eurs that characterised the output of their more self-indulgent contemporaries.&quot;

In December 2017, the band were announced as inductees for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. On 14 April 2018, they were inducted as part of the 2018 class. During his acceptance speech in Cleveland, Ohio, Justin Hayward said, &quot;If you didn&#x27;t know already, well we&#x27;re just a bunch of British guys, but of course to us and to all British musicians, this is the home of our heroes and we all know that...&quot; acknowledging the inspirational role of America&#x27;s rock and roll icons. During the ceremony, Ray Thomas was included as a star that was lost in the past year.

The Hall of Fame summarised the band&#x27;s historic significance as...:
: &quot;&quot;Progressive rock pioneers turned synthesizer-driven rockers, the Moody Blues have created over 50 years of exhilarating and significant music that has influenced countless musicians and rocked fans around the world. ...&quot;
: &quot;&quot;This new sound influenced an entire generation of musicians...&quot;
: &quot;&quot;Throughout the adventurous explorations between the late &#x27;60s and early &#x27;70s, the Moody Blues produced numerous hits that became staples of FM radio. ...&quot;
: &quot;More than half a century later, the Moody Blues continue to tour around the world with no signs of slowing down, connecting to multiple generations of one of rock and roll&#x27;s most loyal fanbases.&quot;

==Moody Bluegrass==
The Moody Bluegrass project is a group of Nashville artists who have recorded two tribute albums of Moody Blues songs in the bluegrass style. The first album, &quot;Moody Bluegrass – A Nashville Tribute to the Moody Blues&quot;, was released in 2004. Those involved included Alison Krauss, Harley Allen, Tim O&#x27;Brien, John Cowan, Larry Cordle, Jan Harvey, Emma Harvey, Sam Bush and Jon Randall.

A second Moody Bluegrass album, &quot;Moody Bluegrass Two...Much Love&quot;, was released in 2011. In addition to many of the participants of the first album, a number of tracks included guest performances from Hayward, Lodge and Edge, (each of whom is credited as the lead vocalist on one song) plus Thomas and Pinder, making this the first time since 1978 that these five musicians all appeared on one newly recorded album.

<doc id="147406" wikidata="Q281034" url="?curid=147406" title="Harry Nilsson">
<text>Harry Edward Nilsson III (June 15, 1941 – January 15, 1994), sometimes credited as Nilsson, was an American singer-songwriter who reached the peak of his success in the early 1970s. His work is characterized by pioneering vocal overdub experiments, a return to the Great American Songbook, and fusions of Caribbean sounds. Nilsson was one of the few major pop-rock recording artists to achieve significant commercial success without performing major public concerts or touring regularly.

Born in Brooklyn, Nilsson moved to Los Angeles as a teenager to escape his family&#x27;s poor financial situation. While working as a computer programmer at a bank, he grew interested in musical composition and close-harmony singing and was successful in having some of his songs recorded by various artists, such as the Monkees. In 1967, he debuted on RCA Victor with the LP &quot;Pandemonium Shadow Show&quot;, followed by a variety of releases that included a collaboration with Randy Newman (&quot;Nilsson Sings Newman&quot;, 1970) and the original children&#x27;s story &quot;The Point!&quot; (1971).

He created the first remix album, &quot;Aerial Pandemonium Ballet&quot;, in 1971, and recorded the first mashup song (&quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That&quot;) in 1967. His most commercially successful album, &quot;Nilsson Schmilsson&quot; (1971), produced the international top 10 singles &quot;Without You&quot; and &quot;Coconut&quot;. His other top 10 hit, a cover of Fred Neil&#x27;s &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Talkin&#x27;&quot; (1968), was featured prominently in the 1969 film &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;. A cover of Nilsson&#x27;s &quot;One&quot;, released by Three Dog Night in 1969, also reached the U.S. top 10.

During a 1968 press conference, The Beatles were asked what their favorite American group was and answered &quot;Nilsson&quot;. Sometimes called &quot;the American Beatle&quot;, he soon formed close friendships with John Lennon and Ringo Starr. In the 1970s, Nilsson and Lennon were members of the Hollywood Vampires drinking club, embroiling themselves in a number of widely publicized, alcohol-fueled incidents. He and Lennon produced one collaborative album, &quot;Pussy Cats&quot; (1974). After 1977, Nilsson left RCA, and his record output diminished. In response to Lennon&#x27;s 1980 murder, he took a hiatus from the music industry to campaign for gun control. For the rest of his life, he recorded only sporadically. In 1994, Nilsson died of a heart attack while in the midst of recording what became his last album, &quot;Losst and Founnd&quot; (2019).

The craft of Nilsson&#x27;s songs and the defiant attitude he projected remain touchstones for later generations of indie rock musicians. Nilsson was voted No. 62 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2015 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time&quot;, where he was described as &quot;a pioneer of the Los Angeles studio sound&quot; and &quot;a crucial bridge&quot; between 1960s psychedelia and the 1970s singer-songwriter era. The RIAA certified &quot;Nilsson Schmilsson&quot; and &quot;Son of Schmilsson&quot; (1972) as gold records, indicating over 500,000 units sold each. He earned two Grammy Awards (for &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Talkin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Without You&quot;).

==Early life==
Nilsson was born on June 15, 1941 in the Bedford–Stuyvesant neighbourhood of Brooklyn in New York City. His paternal great-grandfather, a Swede who later emigrated to and became naturalized in the United States, created an act known as an &quot;aerial ballet&quot; (which is the title of one of Nilsson&#x27;s albums).

His mother, Elizabeth ( Martin) Nilsson, was known as &quot;Bette&quot; to the family. She was born in 1920 in New York to Charles Augustus Martin and Florence Madeline ( Stotz) Martin. Bette had a brother, John, and a sister, Mary. Her parents were the cornerstones of her son&#x27;s young life. While his maternal grandmother played piano, his maternal grandfather, Charlie Martin, supported the family in a tiny railroad apartment on Jefferson Avenue in Brooklyn. His father, Harry Edward Nilsson Jr., abandoned the family when Nilsson was three years old. An autobiographical reference to this is found in the opening to Nilsson&#x27;s song &quot;1941&quot;:

Nilsson&#x27;s &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Song&quot; also refers to this period in Nilsson&#x27;s childhood. He grew up with his mother and a younger half-sister. His younger brother, Drake Nilsson, was left with family or friends during their moves between Southern California and New York, sometimes living with a succession of relatives and his stepfather. His uncle, a mechanic in San Bernardino, California, helped Nilsson improve his vocal and musical abilities. In addition to his half-brother and a half-sister through his mother, he also had three half-sisters and one half-brother through his father.

Due to his family&#x27;s poor financial situation, Nilsson worked from an early age, including a job at the Paramount Theatre in Los Angeles. When the cinema closed in 1960, he applied for a job at a bank, falsely claiming he was a high school graduate on his application (he completed through ninth grade). He had an aptitude for computers, which were starting to be used at banks at the time. He later performed so well in his role that the bank retained him even after they discovered he had lied about his education. He worked on bank computers at night and, in the daytime, pursued his songwriting and singing careers.

==Career==
===1962–1966: Musicianship beginnings===
By 1958, Nilsson was intrigued by emerging forms of popular music, especially rhythm and blues artists like Ray Charles. He had made early attempts at performing while he was working at the Paramount, forming a vocal duo with his friend Jerry Smith and singing close harmonies in the style of the Everly Brothers. The manager of a hangout Nilsson frequented gave him a plastic ukulele, which he learned to play, and he later learned to play the guitar and piano. In the 2006 documentary &quot;Who Is Harry Nilsson (And Why Is Everybody Talkin&#x27; About Him)?&quot;, Nilsson recalled that when he could not remember lyrics or parts of the melodies to popular songs, he created his own, which led to writing original songs.

His uncle&#x27;s singing lessons, along with Nilsson&#x27;s natural talent, helped him when he got a job singing demos for songwriter Scott Turner in 1962. Turner paid Nilsson five dollars for each track they recorded. (When Nilsson became famous, Turner decided to release these early recordings, and contacted Nilsson to work out a fair payment. Nilsson replied that he had already been paid – five dollars a track.)

In 1963, Nilsson had some early success as a songwriter, working with John Marascalco on a song for Little Richard. Upon hearing Nilsson sing, Little Richard reportedly remarked: &quot;My! You sing &quot;good&quot; for a white boy!&quot; Marascalco also financed some independent singles by Nilsson. One, &quot;Baa Baa Blacksheep&quot;, was released under the pseudonym &quot;Bo Pete&quot; to some small local airplay. Another recording, &quot;Donna, I Understand&quot;, convinced Mercury Records to offer Nilsson a contract, and release recordings by him under the name &quot;Johnny Niles&quot;.

By 1964, Nilsson worked with Phil Spector, writing three songs with him. He also established a relationship with songwriter and publisher Perry Botkin Jr., who began to find a market for Nilsson&#x27;s songs. Botkin also gave Nilsson a key to his office, providing another place to write after hours.

Through his association with Botkin, Nilsson met and became friends with musician, composer and arranger George Tipton, who at the time was working for Botkin as a music copyist. In 1964, Tipton invested his life savings – $2,500 – to finance the recording of four Nilsson songs, which he also arranged. They were able to sell the completed recordings to Tower label, a recently established subsidiary of Capitol Records, and the tracks were subsequently included on Nilsson&#x27;s debut album. The fruitful association between Nilsson and Tipton continued after Nilsson signed with RCA Victor. Tipton went on to create the arrangements for nearly all of Nilsson&#x27;s RCA recordings between 1967 and 1971, but their association ended in the 1970s when the two fell out for unknown reasons.

Nilsson&#x27;s recording contract was picked up by Tower Records, which in 1966 released the first singles actually credited to him by name, as well as the debut album &quot;Spotlight on Nilsson&quot;. None of Nilsson&#x27;s Tower releases charted or gained much critical attention, although his songs were being recorded by Glen Campbell, Fred Astaire, The Shangri-Las, The Yardbirds, and others. Despite his growing success, Nilsson remained on the night shift at the bank.

===1967–1968: Signing with RCA Victor===
Nilsson signed with RCA Victor in 1966 and released an album the following year, &quot;Pandemonium Shadow Show&quot;, which was a critical success. Music industry insiders were impressed both with the songwriting and with Nilsson&#x27;s pure-toned, multi-octave vocals. One such insider was Beatles press officer Derek Taylor, who bought an entire box of copies of the album to share this new sound with others. With a major-label release, and continued songwriting success (most notably with The Monkees, who recorded Nilsson&#x27;s &quot;Cuddly Toy&quot; after meeting him through their producer Chip Douglas), Nilsson finally felt secure enough in the music business to quit his job with the bank. Monkees member Micky Dolenz maintained a close friendship until Nilsson&#x27;s death in 1994.

Some of the albums from Derek Taylor&#x27;s box eventually ended up with the Beatles themselves, who quickly became Nilsson fans. This may have been helped by the track &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That&quot;, in which Nilsson covered the John Lennon penned tune – and also worked references to 17 other Beatles tunes in the mix, usually by quoting snippets of Beatles lyrics in the multi-layered backing vocals. When John Lennon and Paul McCartney held a press conference in 1968 to announce the formation of the Apple Corps, Lennon was asked to name his favorite American artist. He replied, &quot;Nilsson&quot;. McCartney was then asked to name his favorite American group. He replied, &quot;Nilsson&quot;.

&quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That&quot; was Nilsson&#x27;s first hit as a performer; though it stalled at No. 122 on the US charts, it hit the top 10 in Canada.

When RCA had asked if there was anything special he wanted as a signing premium, Nilsson asked for his own office at RCA, being used to working out of one. In the weeks after the Beatles&#x27; Apple press conference, Nilsson&#x27;s office phone began ringing constantly, with offers and requests for interviews and inquiries about his performing schedule. Nilsson usually answered the calls himself, surprising the callers, and answered questions candidly. (He recalled years later the flow of a typical conversation: &quot;When did you play last?&quot; &quot;I didn&#x27;t.&quot; &quot;Where have you played before?&quot; &quot;I haven&#x27;t.&quot; &quot;When will you be playing next?&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t.&quot;) Nilsson acquired a manager, who steered him into a handful of TV guest appearances, and a brief run of stage performances in Europe set up by RCA. He disliked the experiences he had, though, and decided to stick to the recording studio. He later admitted this was a huge mistake on his part.

John Lennon called and praised &quot;Pandemonium Shadow Show&quot;, which he had listened to in a 36-hour marathon. Paul McCartney called the following day, also expressing his admiration. Eventually a message came, inviting him to London to meet the Beatles, watch them at work, and possibly sign with Apple.

&quot;Pandemonium Shadow Show&quot; was followed in 1968 by &quot;Aerial Ballet&quot;, an album that included Nilsson&#x27;s rendition of Fred Neil&#x27;s song &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Talkin&#x27;&quot;. A minor US hit at the time of release (and a top 40 hit in Canada), the song would become more popular a year later when it was featured in the film &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;, and it would earn Nilsson his first Grammy Award. The song would also become Nilsson&#x27;s first US top 10 hit, reaching No. 6, and his first Canadian #1.

&quot;Aerial Ballet&quot; also contained Nilsson&#x27;s version of his composition &quot;One&quot;, which was later taken to the top 5 of the US charts by Three Dog Night and also successfully covered in Australia by John Farnham. Nilsson was commissioned at this time to write and perform the theme song for the ABC television series &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot;. The result, &quot;Best Friend&quot;, was very popular, but Nilsson never released the song on record; the original version of the song (titled &quot;Girlfriend&quot;) was recorded during the making of &quot;Aerial Ballet&quot; but not included on that LP, and it eventually appeared on the 1995 &quot;Personal Best&quot; anthology, and as a bonus track on a later release of &quot;Aerial Ballet&quot;. Late in 1968, The Monkees&#x27; notorious experimental film &quot;Head&quot; premiered, featuring a memorable song-and-dance sequence with Davy Jones and Toni Basil performing Nilsson&#x27;s composition &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Song&quot;. (This is followed by Frank Zappa&#x27;s cameo as &quot;The Critic&quot;, who dismisses the 1920s-style tune as &quot;pretty white&quot;.)

With the success of Nilsson&#x27;s RCA recordings, Tower re-issued or re-packaged many of their early Nilsson recordings in various formats. All of these reissues failed to chart, including a 1969 single &quot;Good Times&quot;. This track, however, was resurrected as a duet with Micky Dolenz for the 2016 Monkees&#x27; album of the same name by adding additional parts to an unused Monkees backing track recorded in 1968.

===1969–1972: Chart success===

Nilsson&#x27;s next album, &quot;Harry&quot; (1969), was his first to hit the charts, and also provided a Top 40 single with &quot;I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City&quot; (written as a contender for the theme to &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;), used in the Sophia Loren movie &quot;La Mortadella&quot; (1971) (US title: &quot;Lady Liberty&quot;). While the album still presented Nilsson as primarily a songwriter, his astute choice of cover material included, this time, a song by then-little-known composer Randy Newman, &quot;Simon Smith and the Amazing Dancing Bear&quot;.

Nilsson was so impressed with Newman&#x27;s talent that he devoted his entire next album to Newman compositions, with Newman himself playing piano behind Nilsson&#x27;s multi-tracked vocals. The result, &quot;Nilsson Sings Newman&quot; (1970), was commercially disappointing but was named Record of the Year by &quot;Stereo Review&quot; magazine and provided momentum to Newman&#x27;s career.

The self-produced &quot;Nilsson Sings Newman&quot; also marked the end of his collaboration with RCA staff producer Rick Jarrard, who recounted in the documentary &quot;Who is Harry Nilsson?&quot; that the partnership was terminated by a telegram from Nilsson, who abruptly informed Jarrard that he wanted to work with other producers, and the two never met or spoke again. Jarrard states in the documentary that he never found out why Nilsson had decided to terminate their professional relationship.

Nilsson&#x27;s next project was an animated film, &quot;The Point!&quot;, created with animation director Fred Wolf, and broadcast on ABC television on February 2, 1971, as an &quot;ABC Movie of the Week&quot;. Nilsson&#x27;s self-produced album of songs from &quot;The Point!&quot; was well received and it spawned a top 40 single, &quot;Me and My Arrow&quot;.

Later that year, Nilsson went to England with producer Richard Perry to record what became the most successful album of his career, &quot;Nilsson Schmilsson&quot;, which yielded three stylistically different hit singles. The first was a cover of Badfinger&#x27;s song &quot;Without You&quot; (by British songwriters Pete Ham and Tom Evans), featuring a highly emotional arrangement and soaring vocals to match – recorded, according to Perry, in a single take. It was alleged, by Harry himself, that, upon hitting the highest note of the song, he burst a large haemorrhoid. The performance earned him his second Grammy Award.

The second single was &quot;Coconut&quot;, a novelty calypso number featuring four characters (the narrator, the brother, the sister, and the doctor) all sung (at Perry&#x27;s suggestion) in different voices by Nilsson. The song is best remembered for its chorus lyric (&quot;Put de lime in de coconut, and drink &#x27;em both up&quot;). Also notable is that the entire song is played using one chord, C7. 
The third single, &quot;Jump into the Fire&quot;, was raucous rock and roll, including a drum solo by Derek and the Dominos&#x27; Jim Gordon and a detuned bass part by Herbie Flowers.

Nilsson followed quickly with &quot;Son of Schmilsson&quot; (1972), released while its predecessor was still on the charts. Besides the problem of competing with himself, Nilsson was by then ignoring most of Perry&#x27;s production advice, and his decision to give free rein to his bawdiness and bluntness on this release alienated some of his earlier, more conservative fan base. With lyrics like &quot;I sang my balls off for you, baby&quot;, &quot;Roll the world over / And give her a kiss and a feel&quot;, and the notorious &quot;You&#x27;re breakin&#x27; my heart / You&#x27;re tearin&#x27; it apart / So fuck you&quot; (a reference to his ongoing divorce), Nilsson had traveled far afield from his earlier work. The album nevertheless reached No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and the single &quot;Spaceman&quot; was a Top 40 hit in October 1972. The follow-up single &quot;Remember (Christmas)&quot;, however, stalled at No. 53. A third single, the tongue-in-cheek C&amp;W send up &quot;Joy&quot;, was issued on RCA&#x27;s country imprint Green and credited to Buck Earle, but it failed to chart.

Nilsson was known as a &quot;singer-composer who is heard but not seen&quot;, as he did not do concerts or shows. Prior to agreeing to be featured on an episode of director and producer&#x27;s Stanley Dorfman&#x27;s &quot;In Concert&quot; series for the BBC, Nilsson had appeared only once, for a few moments, on television in Britain and once in America. Nilsson&#x27;s record producer, Richard Perry, referenced his lack of live performing in the book &#x27;The Record Producers&#x27; by BBC Books, saying &quot;He did do the In Concert series on BBC television with Stanley Dorfman, which was very popular at the time. His show was very interesting and innovative with a lot of new technology, multiple images and things like that, but I think any artist, with very few exceptions and none that I can really think of, can immeasurably enhance his career by appearing in front of the public. At some point, the public needs to reach out and touch the artist, experience and feel them in person.

===1973–1979: Maverick===

Nilsson&#x27;s disregard for commercialism in favor of artistic satisfaction was on display in his next release, &quot;A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night&quot; (1973). Performing a selection of pop standards by the likes of Berlin, Kalmar, and Ruby, Nilsson sang in front of an orchestra arranged and conducted by veteran Gordon Jenkins in sessions produced by Derek Taylor. This musical endeavor did not do well commercially. The session was filmed, and broadcast as a television special by the BBC in the UK.

Nilsson appeared in a television special directed and produced by Stanley Dorfman for the BBC in 1973, entitled &quot;A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night&quot;, which was filmed live in the BBC TV theatre in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush days after Nilsson and Frank Sinatra&#x27;s arranger Gordon Jenkins recorded Nilsson&#x27;s album by the same name with a live orchestra.

In 1973, Nilsson was back in California, and when John Lennon moved there during his separation from Yoko Ono, the two musicians rekindled their earlier friendship. Lennon was intent upon producing Nilsson&#x27;s next album, much to Nilsson&#x27;s delight. However, their time together in California became known much more for heavy drinking than it did for musical collaboration. In a widely publicized incident, the two were ejected from the Troubadour nightclub in West Hollywood for drunken heckling of the Smothers Brothers.

To make matters worse, at a late night party and jam session during the recording of the album, attended by Lennon, McCartney, Danny Kortchmar, and other musicians, Nilsson ruptured a vocal cord, but he hid the injury for fear that Lennon would call a halt to the production. The resulting album was &quot;Pussy Cats&quot;. In an effort to clean up, Lennon, Nilsson and Ringo Starr first rented a house together, then Lennon and Nilsson left for New York. After the relative failure of his latest two albums, RCA Records considered dropping Nilsson&#x27;s contract. In a show of friendship, Lennon accompanied Nilsson to negotiations, and both intimated to RCA that Lennon and Starr might want to sign with them, once their Apple Records contracts with EMI expired in 1975, but would not be interested if Nilsson were no longer with the label. RCA took the hint and re-signed Nilsson (adding a bonus clause, to apply to each new album completed), but neither Lennon nor Starr signed with RCA.

In 1973, Nilsson performed in a film with Starr called &quot;Son of Dracula&quot;, a musical featuring many of his songs and a new cut, &quot;Daybreak&quot;. The subsequent soundtrack produced by Richard Perry was released in 1974. Nilsson also sang backup on Starr&#x27;s hit recording from 1973, &quot;You&#x27;re Sixteen&quot;.

Nilsson&#x27;s voice had mostly recovered by his next release, &quot;Duit on Mon Dei&quot; (1975), but neither it nor its follow-ups, &quot;Sandman&quot; and &quot;...That&#x27;s the Way It Is&quot; (both 1976), were met with chart success. Finally, Nilsson recorded what he later considered to be his favorite album &quot;Knnillssonn&quot; (1977). With his voice strong again, and his songs exploring musical territory reminiscent of &quot;Harry&quot; or &quot;The Point!&quot;, Nilsson anticipated &quot;Knnillssonn&quot; to be a comeback album. RCA seemed to agree, and promised Nilsson a substantial marketing campaign for the album. However, the death of Elvis Presley caused RCA to ignore everything except meeting demand for Presley&#x27;s back catalog, and the promised marketing push never happened. This, combined with RCA releasing a &quot;Nilsson Greatest Hits&quot; collection without consulting him, prompted Nilsson to leave the label.

====Nilsson&#x27;s London apartment====
Nilsson&#x27;s 1970s London residence, at Flat 12, 9 Curzon Place on the edge of Mayfair, was a two-bedroom apartment decorated by the ROR (&quot;Ringo or Robin&quot;) design company owned by Starr and interior designer Robin Cruikshank. Nilsson cumulatively spent several years at the apartment, which was located near Apple Records, the Playboy Club, the Tramp nightclub, and the homes of friends and business associates. Nilsson&#x27;s work and interests took him to the US for extended periods, and while he was away, he lent his place to numerous musician friends. During one of his absences, singer Cass Elliot, formerly of The Mamas &amp; the Papas, and a few members of her tour group stayed at the apartment while she performed solo at the London Palladium, headlining with her torch songs and &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Mama Anymore&quot;. Following a strenuous performance with encores on July 29, 1974, Elliot was discovered in one of the bedrooms, dead of heart failure at age 32.

On September 7, 1978, the Who drummer Keith Moon returned to the same room in the apartment after a night out, and died at 32 from an overdose of Clomethiazole, a prescribed anti-alcohol drug. Nilsson, distraught over another friend&#x27;s death in his apartment, and having little need for the property, sold it to Moon&#x27;s bandmate Pete Townshend and consolidated his life in Los Angeles.

===1980–1992: Winding down===

Nilsson&#x27;s musical output after leaving RCA Victor was sporadic. He wrote a musical, &quot;Zapata&quot;, with Perry Botkin Jr. and libretto by Allan Katz, which was produced and directed by longtime friend Bert Convy. The show was mounted at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Connecticut, but never had another production. He wrote all the songs for Robert Altman&#x27;s movie-musical &quot;Popeye&quot; (1980), the score of which met with unfavorable reviews. Nilsson&#x27;s &quot;Popeye&quot; compositions included several songs that were representative of Nilsson&#x27;s acclaimed &quot;Point&quot; era, such as &quot;Everything Is Food&quot; and &quot;Sweethaven&quot;. The song &quot;He Needs Me&quot; was featured years later in the film &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot;. Nilsson recorded one more album, &quot;Flash Harry&quot;, co-produced by Bruce Robb and Steve Cropper, which was released in the UK but not in the US. From this point onward, Nilsson increasingly began referring to himself as a &quot;retired musician&quot;.

Nilsson was profoundly affected by the death of John Lennon on December 8, 1980. He joined the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and overcame his preference for privacy to make appearances for gun control fundraising. He began to appear at Beatlefest conventions and he would get on stage with the Beatlefest house band &quot;Liverpool&quot; to sing either some of his own songs or &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;.

Nilsson was asked by Graham Chapman to contribute a score and songs to the 1983 movie &quot;Yellowbeard&quot;. However, after Nilsson had done some preliminary writing and recording work, the producers of the film decided not to continue with Nilsson&#x27;s music, telling Chapman that they didn&#x27;t think Nilsson could be counted on to finish the material in the allotted time. None of Nilsson&#x27;s music was used in the finished film.

After a long hiatus from the studio, Nilsson started recording sporadically once again in the mid to late 1980s. Most of these recordings were commissioned songs for movies or television shows. One notable exception was his work on a Yoko Ono- Lennon tribute album, &quot;Every Man Has a Woman&quot; (1984) (Polydor); another was a cover of &quot;Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot; recorded for Hal Willner&#x27;s 1988 tribute album &quot;Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films&quot;. Nilsson donated his performance royalties from the song to the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.

In 1985, Nilsson set up a production company, Hawkeye, to oversee various film, TV, and multimedia projects with which he was involved. He appointed his friend, satirist and screenwriter Terry Southern, as one of the principals. They collaborated on a number of screenplays including &quot;Obits&quot; (a &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;-style story about a journalist investigating an obituary notice) and &quot;The Telephone&quot;, a comedy about an unhinged unemployed actor.

&quot;The Telephone&quot; was virtually the only Hawkeye project that made it to the screen. It had been written with Robin Williams in mind but he turned it down; comedian-actress Whoopi Goldberg then signed on, with Southern&#x27;s friend Rip Torn directing, but the project was troubled. Torn battled with Goldberg, who interfered in the production and constantly digressed from the script during shooting, and Torn was forced to plead with her to perform takes that stuck to the screenplay. Torn, Southern, and Nilsson put together their own version of the film, which screened at the Sundance Film Festival in early 1988, but it was overtaken by the &#x27;official&#x27; version from the studio, and this version premiered to poor reviews in late January 1988. The project reportedly had some later success when adapted as a theatre piece in Germany.

In 1990, Hawkeye floundered, and Nilsson found himself in a dire financial situation after it was discovered that his financial adviser, Cindy Sims, had embezzled all the funds he had earned as a recording artist. The Nilssons were left with $300 in the bank and a mountain of debt, while Sims was imprisoned for less than two years before her 1994 release and was not required to pay restitution.

In 1991, the Disney album &quot;For Our Children&quot;, a compilation of children&#x27;s music performed by celebrities to benefit the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, included Nilsson&#x27;s original composition &quot;Blanket for a Sail&quot;, recorded at the Shandaliza Recording Studio in Los Angeles. Also in 1991, he recorded a cover of &quot;How About You?&quot; for the soundtrack of the Terry Gilliam film &quot;The Fisher King&quot;. In 1992, he wrote and recorded the title song for the film &quot;Me Myself &amp; I&quot;.

Nilsson made his last concert appearance on September 1, 1992, when he joined Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band on stage at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, to sing &quot;Without You&quot; with Todd Rundgren handling the high notes. Afterward, an emotional Starr embraced Nilsson on stage. Nilsson&#x27;s final album, tentatively titled &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got a Brown New Robe&quot; (produced by Mark Hudson) was not released, though several demos from the album were later made available on promotional CDs and online.

===1993–1994: Heart attack and death===
Born with congenital heart problems, Nilsson suffered a heart attack on February 14, 1993. After surviving that, he pressured his former label, RCA Records, to release a boxed-set retrospective of his career, and resumed recording, attempting to complete one final album. He finished the vocal tracks for the album with producer Mark Hudson, who held onto the tapes of that session.

Nilsson died of heart failure on January 15, 1994, in his Agoura Hills, California, home at the age of 52.

Nilsson is interred in the Valley Oaks Memorial Park at Westlake Village, California.

===Posthumous releases===
In 1995, the 2-disc CD anthology he worked on with RCA, &quot;Personal Best&quot;, was released.

On November 22, 2019, the final album was eventually released as &quot;Losst and Founnd&quot;.

==Personal life==
Nilsson married Sandi McTaggart on October 24, 1964. They had no children. They divorced in 1967. Nilsson married Diane Clatworthy on December 31, 1969. They had one son.

Nilsson and Clatworthy divorced in 1974. Nilsson married Una O&#x27;Keeffe on August 12, 1976. They remained married until his death on January 15, 1994. They had six children.

===&quot;Who Is Harry Nilsson&quot;?===
Nilsson is the subject of the 2006 documentary &quot;Who Is Harry Nilsson (And Why Is Everybody Talkin&#x27; About Him)?&quot; written, directed, and co-produced by John Schienfeld, the film was screened in 2006 at the Seattle International Film Festival and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. In August 2006, the film received its Los Angeles premiere when it was screened at the 7th Annual Mods &amp; Rockers Film Festival, followed by a panel discussion featuring the filmmakers and two friends of Nilsson: producer Richard Perry and attorney/executive producer Lee Blackman.

The filmmakers re-edited the film with rare found footage of Nilsson, additional interviews, and family photographs, and released it on September 17, 2010, at selected theaters in the United States. A DVD, including additional footage not in the theatrical release, was released on October 26, 2010.

===&quot;The RCA Albums Collection&quot;===
On July 30, 2013, Sony Music released a definitive box-set of his RCA era albums called &quot;The RCA Albums Collection&quot;. Each of the albums in the 17-CD set had additional bonus tracks, and three of the 17 discs contained rarities and outtakes spanning his entire career. Several weeks later on August 13, &quot;Flash Harry&quot; was finally issued on CD, which also featured additional material.

<text>Mary Louise Ware ( Smith; born 1937) is an African-American civil rights activist. She was arrested in October 1955 at the age of 18 in Montgomery, Alabama for refusing to give up her seat on the segregated bus system. She is one of several women who were arrested for this offense prior to Rosa Parks that year. Parks was the figure around whom the Montgomery bus boycott was organized, starting December 5, 1955.

On February 1, 1956, Smith was one of five women named as plaintiffs in the federal civil suit, &quot;Browder v. Gayle&quot;, challenging the constitutionality of the state and local bus segregation laws. On June 13, 1956, a three-judge panel of the United States District Court ruled that the laws were unconstitutional. The ruling was upheld by the United States Supreme Court on November 13 in a landmark decision, and in December it declined to reconsider. On December 20, 1956, the Supreme Court ordered Alabama to desegregate its buses and the Montgomery bus boycott ended.

==Early life and education==
Mary Louise Smith was born in Montgomery, Alabama into a Catholic family. She and all her siblings attended and graduated from St. Jude Educational Institute. She was baptized at St. Jude&#x27;s Church, where she was a parishioner.

At the age of 18, on October 21, 1955, Smith was returning home on the Montgomery city bus, and was ordered to relinquish her seat to a white passenger who had boarded later. She refused to do so and was arrested. She was charged with failure to obey segregation orders, some 40 days before the arrest of Rosa Parks on similar charges. She was arrested and fined $12.

Activist E. D. Nixon, leading some of the bus boycott movement, shared information that Smith&#x27;s father was an alcoholic, and she was not the right symbol to withstand the publicity. The family and neighbors dispute this characterization. Additionally, she was considered not the &quot;right class&quot; to be the rallying point for the movement. Smith&#x27;s father represented her in court, without aid from outside political organizations.

Attorney Fred Gray recruited Smith and her father to become plaintiffs in a federal civil rights class-action lawsuit to end segregated seating on city buses.

==&quot;Browder v. Gayle&quot;==

On February 1, 1956, Gray and other attorneys filed a civil suit, &quot;Browder v. Gayle&quot; in the United States District Court, challenging state and local laws on bus segregation. Smith was one of five plaintiffs, including Aurelia Browder, Claudette Colvin, Susie McDonald, and Jeanetta Reese. (Reese left the case that month because of intimidation.) The women, other than Reese, testified before a three-judge panel, and on June 13, 1956, the court ruled that the laws were unconstitutional, based on equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.

Appealed by the city and state, the case made its way to the United States Supreme Court. On November 13, 1956, it affirmed the lower court&#x27;s ruling. On December 17, it declined an appeal by the city and state to reconsider, and on December 20 ordered the state to desegregate its buses. This ended the Montgomery bus boycott with success.

==Later years==
Little information is available about her personal life. She married Mr. Ware and they had children together. 

Smith followed the civil rights movement, but were not actively part of the political organization. She did attend the 1963 March on Washington.

In 1969, Smith and her sister allowed their sons to become plaintiffs in a racial discrimination lawsuit against the Montgomery YMCA. Lawyer Morris Dees represented their suit, which called out the YMCA for not allowing her and her sister&#x27;s children into their summer camp program. In 1972, the U.S. District court ruled in their favor and ended segregation at the YMCA as well as voided remaining segregation ordinances in the city.

Smith is active with her 12 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren. She still lives in Montgomery, Alabama, and her older sister lives across the street.

When Rosa Parks died in October 2005, Smith Ware, then 68, attended the memorial service in Montgomery. &quot;I had to pay my tribute to her, [s]he was our role model.&quot;

==Tributes==
*Rita Dove, a United States poet laureate, mentions Mary Louise Smith in her poem &quot;The Enactment&quot;, in her collection, &quot;On the Bus with Rosa Parks&quot; (1999). She also referred to the then-young activist in her magazine article &quot;The Torchbearer Rosa Parks&quot;.

* In 2019 a statue of Rosa Parks was unveiled in Montgomery, Alabama, and four granite markers were also unveiled near the statue on the same day to honor four plaintiffs in &quot;Browder v. Gayle&quot;, including Mary Louise Smith. Smith also took part in the unveiling ceremony.

* In 2023, Smith received a historical marker in Montgomery for her own actions.

<text>Jimmy Eat World is an American rock band formed in Mesa, Arizona, in 1993. The band is composed of lead vocalist and lead guitarist Jim Adkins, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Tom Linton, bassist Rick Burch, and drummer Zach Lind. They have released ten studio albums, all but the first featuring the current line-up.

The four-piece&#x27;s commercial breakthrough came with the release of several singles from their album &quot;Bleed American&quot; (2001), four of which charted within the top 20 positions of the Alternative Songs chart, with &quot;The Middle&quot; reaching No. 1. Their follow-up album, &quot;Futures&quot; (2004), featured the No. 1 song &quot;Pain&quot;.

The RIAA-certified &quot;Bleed American&quot; platinum and &quot;Futures&quot; gold, rewarding the two albums for selling over 1.5 million records between them. The band&#x27;s sixth LP, &quot;Chase This Light&quot; (2007), became their highest-charting album and peaked at No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The band released their tenth album, &quot;Surviving&quot;, in October 2019.

==History==

===Formation, &quot;Jimmy Eat World&quot;, and name (1993–1995)===
Jimmy Eat World formed in 1993 in Mesa, Arizona. Frontman Jim Adkins and drummer Zach Lind, who had been friends since preschool, joined guitarist Tom Linton and bassist Mitchel Porter to try their hand at music. They originally formed with a punk rock sound and first released a demo tape in 1993, followed by a debut EP titled &quot;One, Two, Three, Four&quot; in 1994. Their debut self-titled album (1994) was released with Linton singing most of the lead vocals on the album. Within the span of a couple of years, the band recorded and released three singles and a full-length album on local label Wooden Blue Records.

During their formative period the band claimed as influences such pop-punk bands as Mr. T Experience, Radon, and Horace Pinker.

The band&#x27;s name came from a crayon drawing made after an incident between Linton&#x27;s younger brothers, Jim and Ed Linton, who fought frequently. Jim usually won, but Ed sought revenge by drawing a picture of Jim shoving the Earth into his mouth; Ed captioned the picture &quot;Jimmy eat world&quot;.

===&quot;Static Prevails&quot; (1996–1998)===

Eventually, spurred by bands such as Sunny Day Real Estate, the band began to experiment with slower tempos and more varied song structures. As they began writing songs and touring in the indie scene, the band encountered like-minded bands, such as Christie Front Drive, Sense Field, and Seven Storey Mountain, that were working on similar sounds.

The band began to attract increasing attention following the release of numerous recordings and concurrent touring. In response to this self-generated exposure, Capitol Records offered the band a deal in mid-1995, following the interest of Craig Aaronson, the A&amp;R director of the label. Just prior to signing with Capitol, bass player Mitchel Porter parted ways with the band and was replaced by Linton&#x27;s friend Rick Burch.

After a brief scouting for producers, the band joined up with Drive Like Jehu drummer Mark Trombino and Wes Kidd from Triple Fast Action to record its major-label debut &quot;Static Prevails&quot; that featured their first singles &quot;Call It in the Air&quot; and &quot;Rockstar&quot;. In the ensuing years, the band&#x27;s agreement with Capitol permitted the release of singles on independent labels, including split 7-inch singles with Christie Front Drive (Wooden Blue Records, 1995), Jejune (Big Wheel Recreation, 1997), Blueprint (Abridged Records, 1996), Sense Field, and Mineral.

===&quot;Clarity&quot; (1999–2000)===

From late 1998 to early 1999, the band recorded their next album &quot;Clarity&quot; at two studios, Sound City Studios (Van Nuys, California) and Clear Lake Audio (North Hollywood, California). The tracks were mixed at One on One Studios (Los Angeles, California) and Music Grinder Studios, and were mastered at Bernie Grundman Mastering (Hollywood, California). Both the band and Trombino produced the album, with the latter also responsible for the album&#x27;s mixing duties. &quot;Clarity&quot; marks the start of Adkins&#x27;s primary role as lead vocalist and, instead, Linton&#x27;s focus was guitar work. &quot;Clarity&quot; was also released on vinyl through the now-defunct American independent record label Big Wheel Recreation.

The third album contained the single &quot;Lucky Denver Mint&quot; and a radio remix of the song was featured in the film &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot;; the song garnered a cult following. The album&#x27;s closing song &quot;Goodbye Sky Harbor&quot; is based on the John Irving novel &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot;. Overlooked upon its release, Clarity has since amassed cult status and critical acclaim.

===&quot;Bleed American&quot; (2001–2003)===

The band decided to record its next album without the help of a label, supporting itself with touring and by compiling its previously released singles into &quot;Singles&quot;, which was released on indie label Big Wheel Recreation. The band also took on day jobs, saving as much as they could to spend on the sessions. They worked for a third time with Trombino, who agreed to defer payment until after the album&#x27;s release in order to keep costs down. Some of the drum tracks were recorded at Cherokee, and then the band moved to Doug Messenger&#x27;s harddrive analog and digital in North Hollywood, where five weeks of tracking completed the recording phase. Trombino then mixed the record at Extasy in Hollywood.

The finished album was titled &quot;Bleed American&quot;. Joining with Gersh&#x27;s new management company, GAS Entertainment, the band scouted for a new label. The band eventually signed with DreamWorks. The completed album was released in July 2001, which included a vinyl edition through the now-defunct Grand Royal label, founded by the band the Beastie Boys in 1993. The title track (titled &quot;Salt Sweat Sugar&quot; in the UK) was the lead single. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;The Middle&quot; became the band&#x27;s biggest single to date, reaching number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The video for the song received significant airplay on MTV, including on &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. The album was certified platinum by the RIAA. Following the September 11 attacks, the band decided to re-issue the album as &quot;Jimmy Eat World&quot; out of concern that the title &quot;Bleed American&quot; might be misinterpreted, possibly as a threatening &quot;bleed, American&quot;. That year the band performed at Edgefest II in Toronto, Canada.

In 2008, the album was re-released as a deluxe edition and renamed to its original title, &quot;Bleed American&quot;. This edition contains a total of 32 tracks—the original 11 as well as 21 bonus tracks, which are live recordings, demos and B-sides.

===&quot;Futures&quot; (2004–2006)===

After lengthy touring in support of &quot;Bleed American&quot;, the band regrouped to work on the follow-up in early 2004. Once again, the band joined up with Trombino, but the collaboration was short lived. As the sessions began, the band decided that they did not have enough material for a cohesive album. The band&#x27;s desire to spend more time writing songs conflicted with Trombino&#x27;s availability, who already had other projects on his schedule.

Instead, the band brought in producer Gil Norton, well known for his work with the Pixies and the Foo Fighters. Lind explained in 2007, &quot;After we left the studio with Trombino, we came up with &#x27;Polaris&#x27;, &#x27;Work&#x27;, &#x27;Pain&#x27;, [and] &#x27;23&#x27; – the songs that really gave &quot;Futures&quot; its heartbeat.&quot; &quot;Futures&quot; was released in October 2004, with &quot;Pain&quot; serving as the lead single. (By this time, DreamWorks had been acquired by Interscope Records.)

Subsequent months saw the release of &quot;Work&quot; and the title track as singles. Having already toured the US alone and with Taking Back Sunday, the band signed on to tour in 2005 with Green Day. In September 2005, the band released the &quot;Stay on My Side Tonight&quot; EP, which contained reworked versions of demos recorded with producer Mark Trombino that were not used for the album. The album was eventually awarded Gold status in the US by the RIAA.

===&quot;Chase This Light&quot; (2007–2008)===

After its tour, Jimmy Eat World headed home to Tempe and started working on material for a sixth album. The band decided to self-produce the album, enlisting Chris Testa (Dixie Chicks) and John Fields (Switchfoot, Mandy Moore) as co-producers and Butch Vig (Nirvana, Garbage, The Smashing Pumpkins, Green Day) as executive producer. As Burch explained to the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;, &quot;[Vig&#x27;s] role wasn&#x27;t in the studio everyday. We would send Butch samples of what we were doing every couple of days.&quot; &quot;Chase This Light&quot; was released on October 16, 2007, with &quot;Big Casino&quot; as the lead single. &quot;Always Be&quot; was the last single off the album, released in December 2007.

===&quot;Invented&quot; (2009–2012)===

On June 13, 2008, the band revealed that they would begin work on their seventh album later that year and would also consider, upon the expiration of their contract with Interscope, self-releasing the record. Jimmy Eat World performed a tour in early 2009 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of &quot;Clarity&quot;, completing 10 stops across the US, performing the entire record on each occasion.

On March 22, 2010, the band stated that they were in the process of mixing the next album. The band also revealed that, for the first time since &quot;Clarity&quot;, the album would contain a song with lead vocals provided by original vocalist Linton. On June 7, 2010, Jimmy Eat World stated on Twitter: &quot;Our new album is officially done. Now we wait for a release date. We&#x27;ll keep you posted.&quot; &quot;Invented&quot;, the follow-up album after &quot;Chase This Light,&quot; was released on September 28, 2010, on Interscope Records, a date that was previously announced on July 14, 2010, in a Jimmy Eat World Twitter update.

===&quot;Damage&quot; (2013–2015)===
In October 2011, Adkins announced that the band would be writing and recording for their next album. Lind stated in a Twitter post that the band will begin recording its next album during the latter part of August 2012 and, on September 5, 2012, another Twitter post stated that recording had begun for the eighth studio album with engineer/producer Alain Johannes.

On October 5, 2012, Jimmy Eat World posted on Twitter that the band had completed recording its eighth album and that the recording was being mixed at that time; the mastering process then commenced after a November 30, 2012, Twitter update indicated that the mixing process had been completed. On January 29, 2013, Jimmy Eat World stated on both its Twitter and Facebook profiles that the eighth studio album was &quot;officially mastered and sequenced&quot;. In a Twitter post on Lind&#x27;s individual profile, the drummer revealed that, as of January 29, 2013, the band was still seeking out a record label for the release of the eighth album. Lind briefly responded to a fan&#x27;s query with the following: &quot;@CallumSty no announcement coming soon. still looking for a label.&quot;

The official details of the eighth album, entitled &quot;Damage&quot;, emerged in early April 2013 and on April 10, 2013, a lead single titled &quot;I Will Steal You Back&quot; was revealed via the band&#x27;s website. The title track &quot;Damage&quot; appears on the 7-inch Damage EP along with a cover version of the Radiohead song &quot;Stop Whispering&quot;. The EP was released on April 20, 2013, for Record Store Day, an internationally recognized celebration in support of music and independent retail outlets. Jimmy Eat World also released the album&#x27;s track-listing, consisting of 10 songs, and June 11, 2013, as the official release date. Adkins explained in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine interview that &quot;Damage&quot; is a &quot;pretty energetic&quot; work that explores the issue of relationship breakups from the perspective of an adult: &quot;I&#x27;m 37 and the world around me is a lot different than when I was writing break-up songs in my 20s. I tried to reflect that in what the lyrics are.&quot;

The release of &quot;Damage&quot; also signifies the cessation of Jimmy Eat World&#x27;s independent era, as the band signed a recording contract with the Toronto-based record label Dine Alone Records. RCA Records released the eighth album in the US on April 4, 2013 and internationally April 11, 2013. The album was recorded in Johannes&#x27; Los Angeles, US home and was mixed by James Brown, who had previously worked with Sound City, Nine Inch Nails, and The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart.

The band posted a music video for the song &quot;I Will Steal You Back&quot; on their VEVO YouTube page on May 31, 2013. In October 2013, the band announced a series of December 2013 US tour dates that followed a UK/European tour.

===&quot;Integrity Blues&quot; (2016–2018)===

In mid-2014, the band announced the &quot;Futures 10 Year Anniversary Tour&quot; in commemoration of the 10-year anniversary of the &quot;Futures&quot; studio album. Vinyl reissues of &quot;Futures&quot;, &quot;Static Prevails&quot; and &quot;Clarity&quot; were released prior to the commencement of the tour, which began in Ventura, California, US Prior to the Tempe, Arizona, stop of the tour at the end of October, Adkins confirmed that new material was being compiled by the band, but a release time frame was not available. An Oceania leg of the tour occurred in November 2014.

In April 2016, Apple debuted an ad to promote Apple Music which featured Taylor Swift lip syncing and dancing to Jimmy Eat World&#x27;s &quot;The Middle&quot;. This caused significant renewed interest in the band; their song &quot;The Middle&quot; rose to #32 on the iTunes Top Songs Chart, while Pandora noted a 325% increase in Jimmy Eat World station ads in the first day after the ad premiered.

On August 18, 2016, the band&#x27;s Facebook page linked to a 14-second video of instrumental music to the image of a country road, with the words &quot;Stay tuned ...&quot;, further hinting at an upcoming release of the band&#x27;s ninth album. On August 21, 2016, the band released a new song titled &quot;Get Right&quot;, available for free download from their official website. On August 30, 2016, the band debuted the single &quot;Sure and Certain&quot; on radio and announced a new album, &quot;Integrity Blues&quot;, which was released on October 21. The band planned to tour in 2018 as part of the &quot;Integrity Blues Tour&quot; with supporting acts The Hotelier and Microwave.

On May 4, 2018, the band released &quot;Love Never&quot; / &quot;half heart&quot;, featuring two new songs.

On February 14, 2019, Jimmy Eat World played a surprise show at The Rebel Lounge in Phoenix, Arizona, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of their first show.

===&quot;Surviving&quot; and independent singles (2019–present)===

On May 17, 2019, Jimmy Eat World announced the completion of their tenth studio album, planned for release in the fall. On September 18, 2019, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine interviewed Jimmy Eat World about their new album, &quot;Surviving&quot;. It features 10 tracks including &quot;Congratulations&quot;, &quot;Surviving&quot; and &quot;Criminal Energy&quot;, as well as the previously released single &quot;Love Never&quot;. The band released &quot;Surviving&quot; on October 18, 2019.

Because the band was unable to tour the following year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, much of their activity was put on hold. Adkins revealed that, during this time, he chose not to write new music, as he felt burnt out from very recently writing and recording &quot;Surviving&quot;, and wanted to take a break. After the pandemic, they focused their efforts on an online concert series called &quot;Phoenix Sessions&quot;, in which they played multiple shows covering all of the songs on &quot;Surviving&quot;, &quot;Futures&quot; and &quot;Clarity&quot;. The band returned to playing live shows in 2021, first appearing at Lollapalooza 2021 in Chicago.

Adkins began writing new music once the band was able to play shows again, which he took inspiration from and the excitement that it brought the band, specifically the When We Were Young festival. In May 2022, the band announced a headlining North American tour named after their new single, &quot;Something Loud&quot;, which released on June 10, 2022. The single was the band&#x27;s first to be released independently, and Adkins remarked that this newfound freedom found the band wanting to &quot;focus on less music, but hopefully more often&quot;.

<doc id="147412" wikidata="Q8022834" url="?curid=147412" title="Wilmot N. Hess">
<text>Dr. Wilmot N. Hess (October 16, 1926 – April 16, 2004) was an American physicist who was involved with many ambitious scientific projects of the 20th century, including the Plowshares project, the NASA Apollo Moon missions, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) hurricane research and oil spill cleanup research, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) weather modification research, and the US Department of Energy Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) project. Hess retired as the associate director of the US Department of Energy, to which he was first elected in 1976. He lived in California and died of leukemia on April 16, 2004, at the age of 77.

==Early life and education==
Hess was born on October 16, 1926, in Oberlin, Ohio, to Walter and Rachel (Metcalf) Hess. The family moved to Clinton, New York, where he grew up during the Great Depression. He attended a one-room schoolhouse for the first six grades, with only three in his class but plenty of opportunity to &quot;skip ahead&quot; due to the comingled age groups. He received his B.S. in electrical engineering from Columbia University in 1946 at the age of 19 in electrical engineering. In his privately published &quot;Wilmot&#x27;s World&quot; autobiography, he wrote:

He was 87th in his family line to go to Oberlin College, where he received his M.A. in physics in 1949. Hess then attended the University of California at Berkeley where he received his Ph.D. in physics in 1954.

Bill married Winifred Esther (Westher) Lowdermilk in June 1950, during his first year of graduate school at UC Berkeley. They had three children.

==Career==
*1954 - Lawrence Livermore Labs, working on nuclear weapons. Frequent travel to Nevada Test site. 
*1957 - Radiation Lab in Berkeley, to work at the bevatron and on the health physics team. 
*1959 - Project director of Plowshare (peaceful uses of atomic bombs) at Livermore. Technical advisor at the Nuclear Test Ban Conference in Geneva. 
*1961 - Director of Theoretical Division at NASA. Measured cosmic ray neutrons in space and was the first to make a quantitative energy spectrum on them. From &quot;Wilmot&#x27;s World&quot;: &quot;I always felt a little bit like a fraud as Director of the Theoretical Division, not really being a theorist.&quot; 
* Goddard Space Flight Center. From &quot;Wilmot&#x27;s World&quot;: &quot;My years at Goddard were very happy and productive. The space program was just a few years old. I organized a series of Friday afternoon seminars on space research. Almost every week we heard about something brand new about space. The director of Goddard was an aeronautical engineer, Harry Goett. He was a fine man with a research background and gave us a lot of freedom... My own research was on the Van Allen radiation belt. [We developed] a theory to explain how solar protons can diffuse inward and gain energy in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. This quantitatively explained the observed Leo Davis protons.&quot; 
*1966 - Director of Science and Applications for Apollo Moon Program, in Houston. 
*1969 - Director of the Research Labs of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) in Boulder, Colorado. 
*1980-1986 - Director of National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, CO. 
*1986 - Director of the High Energy and Nuclear Physics Program at the Department of Energy, Washington, D.C. 
*1996 - Retired. From &quot;Wilmot&#x27;s World&quot;: &quot;I have much enjoyed wandering through Space Science and meteorology and oceanography and changing fields every decade. I think it was a lot more fun than staying in one place and doing one thing all my life...&quot;

<text>Constantino Paul Castellano (; June 26, 1915 – December 16, 1985) was an American crime boss who succeeded Carlo Gambino as head of the Gambino crime family of New York City. Castellano ran the organization from 1976 until his murder on December 16, 1985.

== Early life ==
Constantino Paul Castellano was born in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, New York, on June 26, 1915. His parents, Giuseppe and Concetta Castellano (née Cassata), were both Italian immigrants; his father was a butcher and an early member of the Mangano crime family, the forerunner of the Gambino crime family.

Castellano dropped out of school in the eighth grade to learn butchering and collecting numbers game receipts, both from In July 1934, 19-year-old Castellano was arrested for the first time in Hartford, Connecticut, for robbing a haberdasher. He refused to identify his two accomplices to the police and served a three-month prison sentence. By refusing to break the oath of &quot;omertà&quot; and cooperate with authorities, Castellano enhanced his reputation for mob loyalty.

Castellano&#x27;s sister Catherine had married one of their cousins, future Mafia boss Carlo Gambino, in 1932. In 1937, Castellano married his childhood sweetheart, Nina Manno; the couple had three sons and a daughter. Manno died in 1999. He was of no relation to actor Richard S. Castellano from &quot;The Godfather&quot;, despite claims made by Richard&#x27;s wife after his death.

Castellano often signed his name as &quot;C. Paul Castellano&quot; because he hated his first name, Constantino. His first name at birth has been cited as both Constantino and Costantino.

Castellano joined the Mangano family in the 1940s and eventually became a &quot;caporegime&quot; (&quot;capo&quot;, or captain) under Albert Anastasia, the successor to original boss Vincent Mangano. In 1957, after Anastasia&#x27;s murder and Gambino&#x27;s elevation to boss, Castellano attended the abortive Apalachin meeting in Apalachin, New York. When the New York State Police raided the meeting, Castellano was one of 61 high-ranking mobsters arrested. Refusing to answer grand jury questions about the meeting, Castellano spent a year in prison on contempt charges. On January 13, 1960, Castellano was sentenced to five years in prison for conspiracy to withhold information. However, in November 1960, Castellano&#x27;s conviction was reversed on appeal.

Castellano identified more as a businessman than a criminal, taking over non-legitimate businesses and converting them to legitimate enterprises. However, his businesses, and those of his sons, still benefitted from their mob ties. In his early years, Castellano used his butcher&#x27;s training to launch Dial Poultry, a poultry distribution business that once supplied 300 butchers in New York City. Castellano used intimidation tactics to force his customers, which included supermarket chains Key Food and Waldbaum&#x27;s, to buy Dial&#x27;s products.

As Castellano became more powerful in the Gambino family, he started to make large amounts of money from concrete in the construction industry. His son Philip was the president of Scara-Mix Concrete Corporation, which exercised a near monopoly on the concrete supply in Staten Island. Castellano handled Gambino interests in the &quot;Concrete Club,&quot; a club of contractors selected by The Commission, the mob&#x27;s ruling body, to handle contracts between $2 million and $15 million. In return, the contractors gave a two-percent kickback of the contract value to The Commission. Castellano also supervised Gambino control of Teamsters Union Local Chapter 282, which provided workers to pour concrete at all major building projects in New York and Long Island.

In 1975, Castellano allegedly had Vito Borelli, his daughter&#x27;s boyfriend, murdered because he heard Borelli had compared him to Frank Perdue, the owner and commercial spokesman for Perdue Farms. In 2004, court documents revealed that Joseph Massino, a government witness and former boss of the Bonanno crime family, admitted to murdering Borelli as a favor to Castellano.

=== Succession ===
On October 15, 1976, Gambino died at his home of natural causes. Against expectations, he appointed Castellano to succeed him over his underboss, Aniello &quot;Neil&quot; Dellacroce. Gambino appeared to believe that his crime family would benefit from Castellano&#x27;s focus on white collar businesses. Dellacroce, at the time, was imprisoned for tax evasion and was unable to contest Castellano&#x27;s succession.

Castellano&#x27;s succession was confirmed at a meeting on November 24, with Dellacroce present. Castellano arranged for Dellacroce to remain as underboss while directly running traditional mob activities such as extortion, robbery and loansharking. While Dellacroce accepted Castellano&#x27;s succession, the deal effectively split the Gambino family into two rival factionsDellacroce&#x27;s faction in Brooklyn, and Castellano&#x27;s faction in Manhattan.

In 1978, Castellano allegedly ordered the murder of Gambino associate Nicholas Scibetta. A cocaine and alcohol user, Scibetta participated in several public fights and insulted the daughter of George DeCicco. Since Scibetta was Salvatore &quot;Sammy the Bull&quot; Gravano&#x27;s brother-in-law, Castellano asked DeCiccio&#x27;s brother Frank to first notify Gravano of the impending hit. When advised of Scibetta&#x27;s fate, a furious Gravano initially threatened to kill Castellano first. However, he eventually calmed down and accepted Scibetta&#x27;s death as a punishment earned by his behavior.

That same year, Castellano allegedly ordered the murders of Gambino &quot;capo&quot; James Eppolito and his son, James Eppolito Jr. Eppolito Sr. had complained to Castellano that Anthony Gaggi, another Gambino &quot;capo&quot;, was infringing on his territory and asked permission to kill him. Castellano gave Eppolito a noncommittal answer, but later warned Gaggi about Eppolito&#x27;s intentions. In response, Gaggi and soldier Roy DeMeo murdered Eppolito and his son.

In February 1978, Castellano made an agreement between the Gambino family and the Westies, an Irish-American gang from Hell&#x27;s Kitchen. Castellano wanted hitmen that law enforcement could not tie directly to the family. The Westies wanted Gambino protection from the other mob families. The Gambino–Westie alliance was set in a meeting between Castellano and Westies leader James Coonan. According to Westies gangster Mickey Featherstone, Castellano gave them the following directive:
You guys got to stop acting like cowboys – acting wild. You&#x27;re going to be with us now. If anyone is going to get killed, you have to clear it with us. 
Castellano also forged an alliance with the Cherry Hill Gambinos, a group of Sicilian heroin importers and distributors in New Jersey, also for use as gunmen. With the Westies and the Cherry Hill Gambinos, Castellano commanded a small army of capable killers.

In September 1980, Castellano allegedly ordered the murder of his former son-in-law, Frank Amato, for physically abusing his wife, Castellano&#x27;s daughter Connie, when they were married. According to FBI documents, DeMeo murdered Amato, cut up his body and disposed of the remains at sea. The following year, Perdue, the alleged cause of the 1975 Borelli murder, approached Castellano for help in thwarting a unionization drive at a Perdue facility in Virginia. However, according to Perdue, the two men never made a final agreement.

At the height of his power, Castellano built a lavish 17-room mansion on a ridgeline in Todt Hill on Staten Island. Designed to resemble the in the mansion featured Carrara marble, an Olympic-size swimming pool and an English garden. Castellano engaged in an affair with his Colombian maid, Gloria Olarte. Castellano became a recluse and rarely ventured outside the mansion, requiring his &quot;capos&quot; to visit the residence to give information and receive orders. When not entertaining guests, Castellano wore satin and silk dressing gowns and velvet slippers around 

John Gotti, a former protégé of Dellacroce, became deeply dissatisfied with Castellano&#x27;s leadership, regarding the boss as being too isolated and greedy. Like other members of the family he disliked Castellano on a personal level, feeling he lacked street credibility. Gotti also had an economic interest: he had a long-running dispute with Castellano on the split Gotti took from hijackings at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Furthermore, Gotti was rumored to be expanding into drug dealing, a lucrative trade Castellano had banned under threat of death.

=== Legal problems ===
In January 1983, Castellano allegedly ordered the murder of DeMeo, who was found shot to death in the trunk of his Cadillac. Two months later, the FBI obtained a warrant to install secret listening devices in Castellano&#x27;s mansion. Waiting until he went on vacation to Florida, agents drugged his watchdogs, disabled his security system, and planted devices in the dining and living rooms. These devices provided law enforcement with a wealth of incriminating information on Castellano.

In August 1983, Gambino members Angelo Ruggiero and Gene Gotti were arrested for dealing heroin, based primarily on recordings from a device in Ruggiero&#x27;s house. Castellano demanded transcripts of the tapes, and when Ruggiero refused he threatened to demote Gotti.

On March 30, 1984, Castellano was indicted on federal racketeering charges, as well as extortion, drug trafficking, theft, prostitution and the murders of Eppolito and DeMeo. He was released on $2 million bail.

Castellano&#x27;s legal challenges mounted in 1985. On February 25 he was one of many mob bosses arrested on charges of racketeering, which was to result in the Mafia Commission Trial; he was released on $3 million bail. On July 1 he was indicted on loansharking charges and with tax evasion for not reporting the profits from an illegal racket, and pleaded not guilty. On November 4, in a testimony from car thief Vito Arena, Castellano was named the head of the stolen-car ring that employed him, as well as having been connected to five murders.

=== Conspiracy ===
Dellacroce died of cancer on starting a chain of events that led to Castellano&#x27;s murder two weeks Castellano&#x27;s failure to attend Dellacroce&#x27;s wake was taken as an insult by members of the Manhattan faction. Then, Castellano named Thomas Bilotti, a loyalist with little diplomatic skill, as the new underboss. Castellano also hinted that he planned to break up John Gotti&#x27;s crew.

Gravano suggested killing both Castellano and Bilotti while they were eating breakfast at a diner. However, when DeCicco tipped Gotti off that he would be having a meeting with Castellano and several other mobsters at Manhattan&#x27;s Sparks Steak House on December 16, Gotti and the other conspirators decided to kill him then.
== Murder ==
On Monday, December 16, 1985, Bilotti drove Castellano to the prearranged early evening meeting at Sparks Steak House. A hit team (consisting of Salvatore Scala, Edward Lino and John Carneglia) waited near the restaurant entrance; positioned down the street were backup shooters Ruggiero, Dominick Pizzonia and Tony Rampino. Gotti and Gravano observed the scene from a car across the street.

As Castellano was exiting the car at the front of the restaurant at around 5:26 pm, the gunmen ran up and shot him several times. Allegedly, Carneglia delivered the fatal shot to Castellano&#x27;s head. Bilotti was shot as he exited from the driver&#x27;s door. Before leaving the murder scene, Gotti drove over to view the bodies.

=== Aftermath ===
Castellano was buried in the Moravian Cemetery in the New Dorp section of Staten Island. The Archdiocese of New York refused to grant him a Catholic funeral, citing his notorious life and death.

Two weeks after the murder, Gotti was elected as the new boss of the Gambino family. Vincent Gigante, the boss of the Genovese family, was outraged that Gotti had killed Castellano without following Mafia protocol and solicited the help of Lucchese family boss Anthony Corallo in carrying out a hit. On April 13, 1986, a car bomb meant for Gotti exploded outside a Bensonhurst social club, but the only casualty was Frank DeCicco.

Gotti was arrested by the FBI in late 1990 on racketeering charges and denied bail 10 days later. On April 2, 1992, with the help of Gravano becoming a government witness, Gotti was convicted of numerous racketeering charges, including the 1985 Castellano murder. On June 23, 1992, Gotti was sentenced to life in federal prison, where he died of throat cancer in 2002. No one else was ever charged in the Castellano murder.

<text>Eudora Alice Welty (April 13, 1909 – July 23, 2001) was an American short story writer, novelist and photographer who wrote about the American South. Her novel &quot;The Optimist&#x27;s Daughter&quot; won the Pulitzer Prize in 1973. Welty received numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Order of the South. She was the first living author to have her works published by the Library of America. Her house in Jackson, Mississippi has been designated as a National Historic Landmark and is open to the public as a house museum.

==Biography==
Eudora Welty was born in Jackson, Mississippi, on April 13, 1909, the daughter of Christian Webb Welty (1879–1931) and Mary Chestina (Andrews) Welty (1883–1966). She grew up with younger brothers Edward Jefferson and Walter Andrews. Her mother was a schoolteacher. Her family were members of the Methodist church. Her childhood home is still standing and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 prior to being delisted in 1986 because a dormer and deck were added to the roof.

Welty soon developed a love of reading reinforced by her mother, who believed that &quot;any room in our house, at any time in the day, was there to read in, or to be read to.&quot; Her father, who worked as an insurance executive, was intrigued by gadgets and machines and inspired in Welty a love of mechanical things. She later used technology for symbolism in her stories and also became an avid photographer, like her father.

She attended Central High School in Jackson. Near the time of her high school graduation, Welty moved with her family to a house built for them at 1119 Pinehurst Street, which remained her permanent address until her death. Wyatt C. Hedrick designed the Weltys&#x27; Tudor Revival-style home, which is now known as the Eudora Welty House and Garden.
Welty studied at the Mississippi State College for Women from 1925 to 1927, then transferred to the University of Wisconsin to complete her studies in English literature. At the suggestion of her father, she studied advertising at Columbia University. Because she graduated in the depths of the Great Depression, she struggled to find work in New York.

Soon after Welty returned to Jackson in 1931, her father died of leukemia. She took a job at a local radio station and wrote as a correspondent about Jackson society for the Memphis newspaper &quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot;. In 1933, she began work for the Works Progress Administration. As a publicity agent, she collected stories, conducted interviews, and took photographs of daily life in Mississippi. She gained a wider view of Southern life and the human relationships that she drew from for her short stories. During this time she also held meetings in her house with fellow writers and friends, a group she called the Night-Blooming Cereus Club. Three years later, she left her job to become a full-time writer.

In 1936, she published &quot;The Death of a Traveling Salesman&quot; in the literary magazine &quot;Manuscript&quot;, and soon published stories in several other notable publications including &quot;The Sewanee Review&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. She strengthened her place as an influential Southern writer when she published her first book of short stories, &quot;A Curtain of Green&quot;. Her new-found success won her a seat on the staff of &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, as well as a Guggenheim Fellowship which enabled her to travel to France, England, Ireland, and Germany. While abroad, she spent some time as a resident lecturer at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, becoming the first woman to be permitted into the hall of Peterhouse College. In 1960, she returned home to Jackson to care for her elderly mother and two brothers.

After Medgar Evers, field secretary of the NAACP in Mississippi, was assassinated, she published a story in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Where Is the Voice Coming From?&quot;. She wrote it in the first person as the assassin.

In 1971, she published a collection of her photographs depicting the Great Depression, titled &quot;One Time, One Place&quot;. Two years later, she received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for her novel &quot;The Optimist&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. She lectured at Harvard University, and eventually adapted her talks as a three-part memoir titled &quot;One Writer&#x27;s Beginnings&quot;. She continued to live in her family house in Jackson until her death from natural causes on July 23, 2001. She is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson. Her headstone has a quote from &quot;The Optimist&#x27;s Daughter&quot;: &quot;For her life, any life, she had to believe, was nothing but the continuity of its love.&quot;

Throughout the 1970s, Welty carried on a lengthy correspondence with novelist Ross Macdonald, creator of the Lew Archer series of detective novels.

==Photography==
While Welty worked as a publicity agent for the Works Progress Administration, she took photographs of people from all economic and social classes in her spare time. From the early 1930s, her photographs show Mississippi&#x27;s rural poor and the effects of the Great Depression. Collections of her photographs were published as &quot;One Time, One Place&quot; (1971) and &quot;Photographs&quot; (1989). Her photography was the basis for several of her short stories, including &quot;Why I Live at the P.O.&quot;, which was inspired by a woman she photographed ironing in the back of a small post office. Although focused on her writing, Welty continued to take photographs until the 1950s.

==Writing career and major works==

Welty&#x27;s first short story, &quot;Death of a Traveling Salesman&quot;, was published in 1936. Her work attracted the attention of author Katherine Anne Porter, who became a mentor to her and wrote the foreword to Welty&#x27;s first collection of short stories, &quot;A Curtain of Green&quot;, in 1941. The book established Welty as one of American literature&#x27;s leading lights, and featured the stories &quot;Why I Live at the P.O.&quot;, &quot;Petrified Man&quot;, and the frequently anthologized &quot;A Worn Path&quot;. Excited by the printing of Welty&#x27;s works in publications such as &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, the Junior League of Jackson, of which Welty was a member, requested permission from the publishers to reprint some of her works. She eventually published over forty short stories, five novels, three works of non-fiction, and one children&#x27;s book.

The short story &quot;Why I Live at the P.O.&quot; was published in 1941, with two others, by &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;. It was republished later that year in Welty&#x27;s first collection of short stories, &quot;A Curtain of Green&quot;. The story is about Sister and how she becomes estranged from her family and ends up living at the post office where she works. Seen by critics as quality Southern literature, the story comically captures family relationships. Like most of her short stories, Welty masterfully captures Southern idiom and places importance on location and customs. &quot;A Worn Path&quot; was also published in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; and &quot;A Curtain of Green&quot;. It is seen as one of Welty&#x27;s finest short stories, winning the second-place O. Henry Award in 1941.

Welty&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;The Robber Bridegroom&quot; (1942), deviated from her previous psychologically inclined works, presenting static, fairy-tale characters. Some critics suggest that she worried about &quot;encroaching on the turf of the male literary giant to the north of her in Oxford, Mississippi—William Faulkner&quot;, and therefore wrote in a fairy-tale style instead of a historical one. Most critics and readers saw it as a modern Southern fairy-tale and noted that it employs themes and characters reminiscent of the Grimm Brothers&#x27; works.

Immediately after the murder of Medgar Evers in 1963, Welty wrote &quot;Where Is the Voice Coming From?&quot;. As she later said, she wondered: &quot;Whoever the murderer is, I know him: not his identity, but his coming about, in this time and place. That is, I ought to have learned by now, from here, what such a man, intent on such a deed, had going on in his mind. I wrote his story—my fiction—in the first person: about that character&#x27;s point of view&quot;. Welty&#x27;s story was published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; soon after Byron De La Beckwith&#x27;s arrest.

Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, &quot;The Optimist&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1972) is believed by some to be Welty&#x27;s best novel. It was written at a much later date than the bulk of her work. As poet Howard Moss wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the book is &quot;a miracle of compression, the kind of book, small in scope but profound in its implications, that rewards a lifetime of work&quot;. The plot focuses on family struggles when the daughter and the second wife of a judge confront each other in the limited confines of a hospital room while the judge undergoes eye surgery.

Welty gave a series of addresses at Harvard University, revised and published as &quot;One Writer&#x27;s Beginnings&quot; (Harvard, 1983). It was the first book published by Harvard University Press to be a &quot; New York Times&quot; Best Seller (at least 32 weeks on the list), and runner-up for the 1984 National Book Award for Nonfiction.

In 1992, she was awarded the Rea Award for the Short Story for her lifetime contributions to the American short story. Welty was a charter member of the Fellowship of Southern Writers, founded in 1987. She also taught creative writing at colleges and in workshops. She lived near Jackson&#x27;s Belhaven College and was a common sight among the people of her home town.

Welty personally influenced several young Mississippi writers in their careers including Richard Ford, Ellen Gilchrist, and Elizabeth Spencer.

==Literary criticism related to Welty&#x27;s fiction==
Welty was a prolific writer who created stories in multiple genres. Throughout her writing are the recurring themes of the paradox of human relationships, the importance of place (a recurring theme in most Southern writing), and the importance of mythological influences that help shape the theme.

Welty said that her interest in the relationships between individuals and their communities stemmed from her natural abilities as an observer. Perhaps the best examples can be found within the short stories in &quot;A Curtain of Green&quot;. &quot;Why I Live at the P.O.&quot; comically illustrates the conflict between Sister and her immediate community, her family. This particular story uses lack of proper communication to highlight the underlying theme of the paradox of human connection. Another example is Miss Eckhart of &quot;The Golden Apples&quot;, who is considered an outsider in her town. Welty shows that this piano teacher&#x27;s independent lifestyle allows her to follow her passions, but also highlights Miss Eckhart&#x27;s longing to start a family and to be seen by the community as someone who belongs in Morgana. Her stories are often characterized by the struggle to retain identity while keeping community relationships.

Place is vitally important to Welty. She believed that place is what makes fiction seem real, because with place come customs, feelings, and associations. Place answers the questions, &quot;What happened? Who&#x27;s here? Who&#x27;s coming?&quot; Place is a prompt to memory; thus the human mind is what makes place significant. This is the job of the storyteller. “A Worn Path” is one short story that proves how place shapes how a story is perceived. Within the tale, the main character, Phoenix, must fight to overcome the barriers within the vividly described Southern landscape as she makes her trek to the nearest town. &quot;The Wide Net&quot; is another of Welty&#x27;s short stories that uses place to define mood and plot. The river in the story is viewed differently by each character. Some see it as a food source, others see it as deadly, and some see it as a sign that &quot;the outside world is full of endurance&quot;.

Welty is noted for using mythology to connect her specific characters and locations to universal truths and themes. Examples can be found within the short story &quot;A Worn Path&quot;, the novel &quot;Delta Wedding&quot;, and the collection of short stories &quot;The Golden Apples&quot;. In &quot;A Worn Path&quot;, the character Phoenix has much in common with the mythical bird. Phoenixes are said to be red and gold and are known for their endurance and dignity. Phoenix, the old Black woman, is described as being clad in a red handkerchief with undertones of gold and is noble and enduring in her difficult quest for the medicine to save her grandson. In &quot;Death of a Traveling Salesman&quot;, the husband is given characteristics common to Prometheus. He comes home after bringing fire to his boss and is full of male libido and physical strength. Welty also refers to the figure of Medusa, who in &quot;Petrified Man&quot; and other stories is used to represent powerful or vulgar women.

Locations can also allude to mythology, as Welty proves in her novel &quot;Delta Wedding&quot;. As Professor Veronica Makowsky from the University of Connecticut writes, the setting of the Mississippi Delta has &quot;suggestions of the goddess of love, Aphrodite or Venus-shells like that upon which Venus rose from the sea and female genitalia, as in the mound of Venus and Delta of Venus&quot;. The title &quot;The Golden Apples&quot; refers to the difference between people who seek silver apples and those who seek golden apples. It is drawn from W. B. Yeats&#x27; poem &quot;The Song of Wandering Aengus&quot;, which ends &quot;The silver apples of the moon, The golden apples of the sun&quot;. It also refers to myths of a golden apple being awarded after a contest. Welty used the symbol to illuminate the two types of attitudes her characters could take about life.

<doc id="147424" wikidata="Q3297386" url="?curid=147424" title="Norbert Rillieux">
<text>Norbert Rillieux (March 17, 1806 – October 8, 1894) was a Louisiana Creole inventor who was widely considered one of the earliest chemical engineers and noted for his pioneering invention of the multiple-effect evaporator. This invention was an important development in the growth of the sugar industry. Rillieux, a French-speaking Creole, was a cousin of the painter Edgar Degas.

==Family==
Norbert Rillieux was born into a prominent Creole family in New Orleans, Louisiana. He was the son of Vincent Rillieux, a white plantation owner and inventor, and his placée, Constance Vivant, a free person of color. Norbert was the eldest of seven children. His siblings were: Barthelemy, Edmond, Marie Eugenie, Louis, Marie Eloise, and Cecile Virginie. Norbert&#x27;s aunt on his father&#x27;s side, Marie Celeste Rillieux, was the grandmother of painter Edgar Degas. His aunt on his mother&#x27;s side, Eulalie Vivant, was the mother of Bernard Soulie, one of the wealthiest &quot;gens de couleur libre&quot; in Louisiana. One of Norbert&#x27;s cousins was the blind writer Victor Ernest Rillieux.

==Early life==
As a Creole of color, Norbert Rillieux had access to education and privileges not available to lower-status free blacks or slaves. Baptized Catholic, Rillieux received his early education at private Catholic schools in Louisiana before traveling to Paris in the early 1820s to study at École Centrale Paris, one of the top engineering schools in France. While at École Centrale, Norbert studied physics, mechanics, and engineering. He became an expert in steam engines and published several papers about the use of steam to work devices. These early explorations became the foundation of the technology he would later implement in his evaporator. At 24 (1830), Rillieux became the youngest teacher at École Centrale, instructing in applied mechanics.

==Sugar refining==
In the 1800s, the process for sugar refinement was slow, expensive, and inefficient. The most common method of converting sugarcane into sugar was called the &quot;Sugar Train&quot;; it was also known as the &quot;Spanish Train&quot; or &quot;Jamaica Train&quot;. The sugarcane juice was pressed from the cane and poured into a large kettle, where it was heated and left until most of the water evaporated. The workers, who were mostly slaves, poured the resultant thick liquid into smaller and smaller pots as the liquid continued to thicken. Each time the liquid was poured, some of the sugar was lost. A considerable amount of sugar was also burned because it was difficult to monitor and maintain appropriate heat levels for the pots. The process was also dangerous for the workers, who had to routinely transfer the hot liquid.

While in France, Norbert Rillieux started researching ways to improve the process of sugar refining. Meanwhile, back in Louisiana, Norbert&#x27;s brother, Edmond, a builder, along with their cousin, Norbert Soulie, an architect, began working with Edmund Forstall to build a new Louisiana Sugar Refinery. In 1833, Forstall, having heard about Rillieux&#x27;s research into sugar refining, offered him the position of Head Engineer at the not-yet-completed sugar refinery. Rillieux accepted the offer and returned to Louisiana to take up his new position. However, the sugar refinery was never completed due to disagreements between the principals, mainly Edmond Rillieux, his father, Vincent Rillieux, and Edmund Forstall. These disagreements created long-term resentments between the Rillieux family and Edmund Forstall.

In spite of the failure of the collaboration, Norbert Rillieux remained focused on improving the sugar refining process, developing his machine between 1834 and 1843, when he patented it. The multiple-effect evaporation system that he invented addressed both the spillage that resulted from transfer and the uneven application of heat, as well as making the process safer for workers. The system utilizes a vacuum chamber or a container with reduced air to lower the boiling point of the liquids. Inside this several pans are stacked to contain the sugarcane juice. As the bottom pans heat, they release steam to transfer heat to the pans above. The heat is more easily controlled than in the Jamaican Train method because one source is needed, at a lower temperature, for multiple pans of sugarcane juice. This prevents the sugar from being burned and discolored. As the workers do not have to transfer the liquid, sugarcane is not spilled, and they are at a reduced risk for burns.

Norbert Rillieux&#x27;s invention revolutionized sugar processing. His great scientific achievement was his recognition that at reduced pressure the repeated use of latent heat would result in the production of better quality sugar at a lower cost. One of the great early innovations in chemical engineering, Rillieux&#x27;s invention is widely recognized as the best method for lowering the temperature of all industrial evaporation and for saving large quantities of fuel.

Several years after patenting the system, Norbert Rillieux successfully installed it at Theodore Packwood&#x27;s Myrtle Grove plantation. Not long after this, Rillieux&#x27;s new system was installed at Bellechasse, a plantation owned by Packwood&#x27;s business partner, Judah P. Benjamin. Benjamin and Rillieux became quite good friends, possibly due to their similar social situation; they were both considered outsiders in Louisiana&#x27;s very class-conscious society.

After these successes, Norbert Rillieux managed to convince 13 Louisiana sugar factories to use his invention. By 1849, Merrick &amp; Towne in Philadelphia were offering sugar makers a choice of three different multiple-effect evaporation systems. They were able to select machines capable of making 6000, 12000, or 18000 pounds of sugar per day. The evaporators were so efficient that the sugar makers were able to cover the costs of the new machine with the huge profits from the sugar produced with Norbert Rillieux&#x27;s system.

==Other work==
Rillieux also used his engineering skills to deal with a yellow fever outbreak in New Orleans in the 1850s. Rillieux presented a plan to the city that would eliminate the moist breeding grounds for the mosquitoes that carried the disease by addressing problems in the city&#x27;s sewer system and drying swamplands in the area. The plan was blocked by Edmund Forstall, now a state legislator. Several years later, the ongoing yellow fever outbreak in New Orleans was addressed by engineers using a method extremely similar to Rillieux&#x27;s proposals.

==Later life==
Norbert Rillieux returned to France in the late 1850s, a few years before the start of the American Civil War. Race relations in the United States may have motivated part of his decision to do so since at one point, Rillieux became enraged when one of his applications for a patent was rejected because authorities falsely believed that he was a slave and thus, not a citizen in the United States.

In Paris, Rillieux became interested in Egyptology and hieroglyphics, which he studied with the family of Jean-François Champollion. He spent the next decade working at the Bibliothèque Nationale.

In 1881, at the age of 75, Rillieux made one last foray into sugar evaporation when he adapted his multiple effect evaporation system to extract sugar from sugar beets. The process for which he filed patent was far more fuel-efficient than that currently in use in the beet sugar factories in France. Prior to Rillieux&#x27;s invention, two engineers developed a vacuum pan and electric coils to improve the process of making sugar, but this was unsuccessful due to the use of steam at wrong locations in the machine. Rillieux&#x27;s process fixed the errors in the previous process, but Rillieux lost the rights to the patent he had filed.

Norbert Rillieux died on October 8, 1894, aged 88. He is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris with the inscription &quot;Ici reposent Norbert Rellieux ingénieur civil né à la Nouvelle Orleans 18 Mars 1806/décédé à Paris le 8 Octobre 1894/Emily Cuckow, Veuve Rillieux 1827-1912.&quot; His wife, Emily Cuckow, died in 1912 and is buried beside him.

In his honor, a bronze memorial was erected in the Louisiana State Museum with the inscription: &quot;To honor Norbert Rillieux, born at New Orleans, Louisiana, March 17, 1806, and died at Paris, France, October 8, 1894. Inventor of Multiple Evaporation and Its Application to the Sugar Industry.&quot;

<doc id="147426" wikidata="Q2624777" url="?curid=147426" title="Languages of Asia">
<text>Asia is home to hundreds of languages comprising several families and some unrelated isolates. The most spoken language families on the continent include Austroasiatic, Austronesian, Japonic, Dravidian, Indo-European, Afroasiatic, Turkic, Sino-Tibetan, Kra–Dai and Koreanic. Many languages of Asia, such as Chinese, Persian, Sanskrit, Arabic, Tamil or Telugu, have a long history as a written language.

==Language groups==
The major families in terms of numbers are Indo-European, specifically Indo-Aryan languages and Dravidian languages in South Asia; and Sino-Tibetan in East Asia. Several other families are regionally dominant.

===Sino-Tibetan===
Sino-Tibetan includes Chinese, Tibetan, Burmese, Karen, Boro and numerous languages of the Tibetan Plateau, Southern China, Myanmar, and North East India.

===Indo-European===

The Indo-European languages are primarily represented in Asia by the Indo-Iranian branch, with its two main subgroups: Indo-Aryan and Indo-Iranian.

Indo-Aryan languages are mainly spoken in South Asia. Examples include languages such as Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu), Bengali, Bhojpuri, Punjabi, Marathi, Rajasthani, Gujarati, Sylheti)

Iranic languages are mainly spoken in Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan and neighboring regions. Examples include languages like Persian, Kurdish, Pashto and Balochi which are spoken in

In addition, other branches of Indo-European spoken in Asia include the Slavic branch, which includes Russian in Siberia; Greek around the Black Sea; and Armenian; as well as extinct languages such as Hittite of Anatolia and Tocharian of (Chinese) Turkestan.

===Altaic families===
A number of smaller, but important and separately distinguished language families spread across central and northern Asia have long been linked in a hypothetical, controversial and unproven Altaic family. These are the Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic (including Manchu), Koreanic, and Japonic languages. But since the mid-20th century a majority of scholars have come to regard it as a Sprachbund.

===Austroasiatic===
The Mon–Khmer languages (also known as Austroasiatic) are the language family in South and Southeast Asia. Languages given official status are Vietnamese and Khmer (Cambodian).

===Kra–Dai===
The Kra–Dai languages (also known as Tai-Kadai) are found in southern China, Northeast India and Southeast Asia. Languages given official status are Thai (Siamese) and Lao.

===Austronesian===
The Austronesian languages are widespread throughout Maritime Southeast Asia, including major languages such as Fijian (Fiji), Hiligaynon, Bikol, Ilocano, Cebuano, Tagalog (Philippines), and Malay (Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and Singapore). Javanese, Sundanese, and Madurese of Indonesia, as well as Indonesian, which is the largest language in this family.

===Dravidian===
The Dravidian languages of South India and parts of Sri Lanka include Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Tulu, while smaller languages such as Gondi and Brahui are spoken in central India and Pakistan respectively.

===Afro-Asiatic===
The Afroasiatic languages (in older sources Hamito-Semitic) are represented in Asia by the Semitic branch. Semitic languages are spoken in Western Asia, and include the various dialects of Arabic and Aramaic, Modern Hebrew, and Modern South Arabian languages in addition to extinct languages such as Akkadian and Ancient South Arabian.

===Siberian families===
Besides the Altaic families already mentioned (of which Tungusic is today a minor family of Siberia), there are a number of small language families and isolates spoken across northern Asia. These include the Uralic languages of western Siberia (better known for Hungarian and Finnish in Europe), the Yeniseian languages (linked to Turkic and to the Athabaskan languages of North America), Yukaghir, Nivkh of Sakhalin, Ainu of northern Japan, Chukotko-Kamchatkan in easternmost Siberia, and—just barely—Eskimo–Aleut. Some linguists have noted that the Koreanic languages share more similarities with the Paleosiberian languages than with the Altaic languages. The extinct Rouran language of Mongolia is unclassified, and does not show genetic relationships with any other known language family.

===Caucasian families===
Three small families are spoken in the Caucasus: Kartvelian languages, such as Georgian; Northeast Caucasian (Dagestanian languages), such as Chechen; and Northwest Caucasian, such as Circassian. The latter two may be related to each other. The extinct Hurro-Urartian languages may be related as well.

===Small families of Asia===
Although dominated by major languages and families, there are number of minor families and isolates in South Asia and Southeast Asia. From west to east, these include:

*Hattic, an unclassified language in Anatolia.
*extinct languages of the Fertile Crescent such as Sumerian and Elamite.
*extinct languages of South Asia; mainly the unclassified Harappan language
*small language families and isolates of the Indian subcontinent: Burushaski, Kusunda, and Nihali. The Vedda language of Sri Lanka is likely an isolate that has mixed with Sinhala.
*the two Andamanese language families: Great Andamanese and Ongan; Sentinelese remains undocumented to date, and hence unclassified.
*unclassified languages in Southeast Asia: Kenaboi.
*the difficult to classify Arunachal languages: Digaro, Hrusish (including the Miji languages), Midzu, Puroik, Siangic, and Kho-Bwa.
*Hmong–Mien (Miao–Yao) scattered across southern China and Southeast Asia
*a few &quot;Papuan&quot; (Non-Austronesian) families of the central and eastern Malay Archipelago: such as the Timor-Alor-Pantar and North Halmahera languages, and the little known extinct Tambora language of Sumbawa. Numerous additional families are spoken in Indonesian New Guinea, which is generally considered to part of Oceania.

===Creoles and pidgins===
The eponymous pidgin (&quot;business&quot;) language developed with European trade in China. Of the many creoles to have developed, the most spoken today are Chavacano, a Spanish-based creole of the Philippines, and various Malay-based creoles such as Manado Malay influenced by Portuguese. A very well-known Portuguese-based creole is the Kristang, which is spoken in Malacca, a city-state in Malaysia.

===Sign languages===
A number of sign languages are spoken throughout Asia. These include the Japanese Sign Language family, Chinese Sign Language, Indo-Pakistani Sign Language, as well as a number of small indigenous sign languages of countries such as Nepal, Thailand, and Vietnam. Many official sign languages are part of the French Sign Language family.

==Official languages==

Asia and Europe are the only two continents where most countries use native languages as their official languages, though English is also widespread as an international language.

<text>In computer networking, a token bus network is a network implementing a token-passing protocol over a virtual ring on a coaxial cable.

==Network==
A token is passed around the network nodes and only the node possessing the token may transmit. If a node doesn&#x27;t have anything to send, the token is passed on to the next node on the virtual ring. Each node must know the address of its neighbour in the ring, so a special protocol is needed to notify the other nodes of connections to, and disconnections from, the ring.

Ethernet&#x27;s access protocol could not absolutely guarantee a maximum time any station would have to wait to access the network, so was thought to be unsuitable for manufacturing automation applications. The Token bus protocol was created to combine the benefits of a physical bus network with the deterministic access protocol of a Token Ring network.

==IEEE 802.4==
Token Bus was standardized by IEEE standard 802.4. It was mainly used for industrial applications. Token Bus was used by General Motors for their Manufacturing Automation Protocol (MAP) standardization effort. This differs from Token Ring networks in that the endpoints of the bus do not meet to form a physical ring.

In order to guarantee the packet delay and transmission in the Token Bus protocol, a modified Token Bus was proposed in manufacturing automation systems and flexible manufacturing system (FMS). To optimize deterministic access required by real-time IoT communication in a distributed manufacturing plant or IIoT, token bus method can also be implemented according to IEEE 802.15.4. 

A means for carrying Internet Protocol over IEEE 802 networks, including token bus networks, was developed.

The IEEE 802.4 Working Group has disbanded and the standard has been withdrawn by the IEEE.

<text>Ian James Thorpe (born 13 October 1982) is an Australian retired swimmer who specialised in freestyle, but also competed in backstroke and the individual medley. He has won five Olympic gold medals, the second most won by any Australian after fellow swimmer Emma McKeon. With three gold and two silver medals, Thorpe was the most successful athlete at the 2000 Summer Olympics, held in his hometown of Sydney.

At the age of 14, Thorpe became the youngest male ever to represent Australia, and his victory in the 400 metre freestyle at the 1998 Perth World Championships made him the youngest-ever individual male World Champion. After that victory, Thorpe dominated the 400 m freestyle, winning the event at every Olympic, World, Commonwealth and Pan Pacific Swimming Championships until his break after the 2004 Olympics in Athens. At the 2001 World Aquatics Championships, he became the first person to win six gold medals in one World Championship. Aside from 13 individual long-course world records, Thorpe anchored the Australian relay teams, numbering the victories in the 4 × 100 m and the 4 × 200 m freestyle relays in Sydney among his five relay world records. His wins in the 200 m and 400 m and his bronze in the 100 m freestyle at the 2004 Summer Olympics made him the only male to have won medals in the 100–200–400 combination. He acquired the nickname &quot;Thorpedo&quot; because of his speed in swimming. Thorpe announced his retirement from competitive swimming in November 2006, citing waning motivation; he made a brief comeback in 2011 and 2012.

In total, Thorpe has won eleven World Championship gold medals; this is the fifth-highest number of gold medals won by any male swimmer. Thorpe was the first person to have been named &quot;Swimming World&quot; Swimmer of the Year four times, and was the Australian Swimmer of the Year from 1999 to 2003. His athletic achievements made him one of Australia&#x27;s most popular athletes, and he was recognised as the Young Australian of the Year in 2000.

==Early years==
Born in Sydney, Thorpe grew up in the suburb of Milperra and hailed from a sporting family. His father Ken was a promising cricketer at junior level, representing Bankstown District Cricket Club in Sydney&#x27;s district competition. A talented batsman, he once topped the season&#x27;s batting averages ahead of former Australian captain Bob Simpson. However, paternal pressure detracted from Ken&#x27;s enjoyment of cricket, and he retired at the age of 26. Thorpe&#x27;s mother Margaret played A-grade netball, but he did not inherit his parents&#x27; ball skills. His elder sister Christina was advised to take up swimming to strengthen a broken wrist, so by chance, the five-year-old Thorpe followed her into the pool. Due to his unhappy experiences, Ken Thorpe regarded enjoyment as the most critical aspect of his children&#x27;s participation in sport. A large baby, Thorpe weighed and measured in length at birth.

As a young child, Thorpe was sidelined by an allergy to chlorine. As a result, he did not swim in his first race until a school carnival at the age of seven. The allergy forced Thorpe to swim with his head out of the water; despite this ungainly technique, he won the race, primarily because of his significant size advantage. Thorpe gradually overcame the ailment and progressed to the captaincy of New South Wales for the Australian Primary Schools Championships in 1994. He subsequently won nine individual gold medals at the New South Wales Short Course Age Championships in September of the same year. In 1995, Thorpe started his secondary education at East Hills Boys Technology High School and switched coaches to swim alongside his sister under the tutelage of Doug Frost. It was a busy year for the family; Christina was selected for the Australian team to compete at the 1995 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Atlanta. Now six feet tall, Ian competed at his first Australian Age Championships, winning bronze medals in the 200 m and 400 m freestyle. He won all ten events at the New South Wales Age Championships.

===National competition===
Thorpe competed at the 1996 Australian Age Championships in Brisbane, winning five gold, two silver and two bronze medals. His times in the 400 m freestyle and 200 m backstroke qualified him for the Australian Championships, which doubled as selection trials for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Frost knew that Thorpe had no realistic chance of making the top two in any event, which would have meant Olympic selection at only 13 years and six months. He sent Thorpe to Sydney merely to gain competition experience at senior national level. As expected, Thorpe missed selection; he finished 23rd in the 400 m freestyle and 36th in the 200 m backstroke. At the end of the year, Thorpe qualified for the Australian Short Course Championships. It was another chance to gain national selection, as the event served as the selection trials for the 1997 FINA World Swimming Championships. Thorpe qualified in second place in the heats of the 400 m individual medley and reached his first national final. However, he swam more slowly in the final and missed selection.

At the New South Wales Championships in January 1997, Thorpe&#x27;s time of 3 min 59.43 s in the 400 m was eight seconds faster than his previous personal best; it made him the first 14-year-old to cover the distance in less than four minutes on Australian soil. Ranked fourth for the event countrywide, Thorpe went into the Australian Championships in Adelaide as a serious contender for selection in the national team for the 1997 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Fukuoka, Japan. With a top-three finish and a specific qualifying time required for selection, Thorpe focused on the 400 m freestyle after injuries to world record holder Kieren Perkins and Daniel Kowalski; both had won Olympic medals in the event. Thorpe went on to win bronze behind 16-year-old Queenslander Grant Hackett, setting a new personal best of 3 min 53.44 s. The time was a world record for his age group and the race was the first of many battles with Hackett.

Aged 14 years and 5 months, Thorpe became the 463rd and youngest ever male to be selected for the Australian team, surpassing John Konrads&#x27; record by one month. Frost said that Thorpe&#x27;s selection catalysed his eventual focus on freestyle. Thorpe continued his good form at the Australian Age Championships. He contested all twelve events, winning ten individual gold and two bronze medals. He set six Australian records in the process.

==Early international career (1997–1998)==
===International debut (1997)===


In June 1997, two months before the Pan Pacific Championships, Thorpe required an appendix operation, which caused him to miss two weeks of training. Upon reaching Japan, Thorpe placed fourth in his heat of the 200 m freestyle with a new personal best time of 1 min 51.46 s. Thorpe&#x27;s time was not enough to qualify for the final, but earned him selection in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay team. Along with teammates Michael Klim, Ian van der Wal and Hackett, Thorpe claimed silver, making him the youngest ever Pan Pacific medalist. In his first individual final at international level, Thorpe was fifth at the 300 m mark, but fought back to claim silver in the 400 m freestyle behind Hackett in a time of 3 min 49.64 s. His finishing burst was to become a trademark, and his time would have been enough to win silver at the Atlanta Olympics. In October 1997, a few days before his fifteenth birthday, Thorpe competed in qualifying trials in Brisbane for the 1998 World Aquatics Championships in Perth. Thorpe gained selection for the world championships by finishing fourth and second in the 200 m and 400 m freestyle respectively. He set new personal bests in both events.

===1998 World Aquatics Championships===


Thorpe&#x27;s first international appearance in his home country, at the 1998 World Championships in Perth, began with the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay. Swimming the third leg after Klim and Hackett, Thorpe broke away from 200 m butterfly Olympic champion Tom Malchow to set a split time of 1 min 47.67 s, just 0.26 seconds slower than Klim&#x27;s winning time in the 200 m final. By the end of Thorpe&#x27;s leg, the Australians were two seconds ahead of the world record pace, and three seconds ahead of the Americans, having extended the lead by two body lengths. Although anchorman Kowalski finished outside the world record, it was the first time that Australia had won the event at the global level since 1956. Thorpe was ranked fourth in the world before the 400 m final, which Hackett led from the outset. Hackett established a comfortable 2.29 s lead over Thorpe by the 300 m mark, and although Thorpe reduced the margin to 1.53 s at the 350 m mark, Hackett led until Thorpe passed him on the final stroke. Thorpe&#x27;s time was the fourth fastest in history and made him the youngest ever male individual world champion, aged 15 years and 3 months.

As a result of the media attention generated by his win on home soil, Thorpe received multiple offers for television commercials and was often surrounded by autograph hunters. He became a high-profile supporter of the Children&#x27;s Cancer Institute, after his sister Christina&#x27;s future brother-in-law Michael Williams became gravely ill with cancer.

===1998 Commonwealth Games===


Thorpe&#x27;s next competition was in March at the Australian Championships in Melbourne, which were selection trials for the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Malaysia. Thorpe&#x27;s improvement continued when he defeated Klim in the 200 m freestyle in 1 min 47.24 s, faster than Klim&#x27;s winning time at the World Championship two months earlier. Thorpe&#x27;s time was a Commonwealth record and with it, he secured his first national title. He then claimed the 400 m freestyle title from Hackett and clocked 50.36 s in the 100 m freestyle. His time earned silver in his first 100 m race at the national level, gaining him Commonwealth selection in three individual events.

Thorpe&#x27;s rise continued when the Australians arrived in Kuala Lumpur during September for the Commonwealth Games. Thorpe&#x27;s first event was the 200 m freestyle, where he led throughout to record a time just one hundredth of a second outside Giorgio Lamberti&#x27;s world record. He then combined with Klim, Kowalski and Matt Dunn in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay to break the world record of the Unified Team set in 1992 by 0.09 s. Thorpe&#x27;s run ended when a personal best of 50.21 s in the 100 m freestyle was only sufficient for fourth place, but he returned to victory with the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay team. He claimed a fourth gold in the 400 m freestyle, setting another personal best, just 0.55 s slower than Kieren Perkins&#x27; 1994 mark.

Thorpe left school at the end of the year after completing Year 10. His decision caused concerns that concentrating on swimming alone could lead to burn out. Thorpe disagreed, pointing to his informal search for knowledge, stating that &quot;Swimming is a small part of my life&quot;. His impact in the swimming community was acknowledged when he became the youngest male swimmer to be named as the &quot;Swimming World&quot; Swimmer of the Year.

==Record-breaking years (1999–2002)==

The year 1999 began with heavy media expectations that Thorpe would inevitably break both 200 m and 400 m world records, given his continuing physical growth. The first opportunity came in late March at the 1999 Australian Championships in Brisbane, which doubled as a selection event for the 1999 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships. Thorpe again won the 400 m, but Perkins&#x27; record eluded him, this time by just 0.05 s. Hackett turned the tables in the 200 m event, passing Thorpe in the final 50 m to win Thorpe&#x27;s title. Although both were outside Lamberti&#x27;s mark, Hackett went on to break it the following night in a relay event. Thorpe finished the Championships by continuing his improvement in the 100 m freestyle, posting a time of 49.98 s, his first under the 50 s barrier. The Australian team then travelled to Hong Kong for the 1999 World Short Course Championships, where Thorpe broke Lamberti&#x27;s mark in the 200 m freestyle, the longest standing world record at the time. However, Hackett defeated him in the 400 m. This was the start of a three-year phase where Thorpe was to set his 13 individual long course world records. He led the men&#x27;s relay team to unprecedented success in relay events, scoring historic victories over the Americans. Thorpe was to peak in 2001 when he became the first person to win six gold medals at one world championships, setting three world records and helping Australia top the medal tally at a global meet for the first time since 1956. In this period, he was named &quot;Swimming World&quot; Swimmer of the Year three times.

===1999 Pan Pacific Championships===



The 1999 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships were held in August at Sydney Olympic Park, and were viewed as a rehearsal for the 2000 Summer Olympics to be held in the same venue. With Thorpe expected to deliver world records at his first international meet in Sydney, the event was shown live on Australian television for the first time. The opening night saw him pitted against Hackett and South Africa&#x27;s Ryk Neethling in the 400 m freestyle final. The trio reached the 200 m mark in a group, on world record pace, before Thorpe broke away, recording a split time 1.86 s ahead of world-record pace at 300 m. He extended his lead to four body lengths by the 350 m mark and finished in a time of 3 min 41.83 s, cutting almost two seconds from the world record, and covering the second half in almost the same time as the first. Talbot reacted to the performance by dubbing Thorpe as &quot;the greatest swimmer we&#x27;ve [Australia] ever had&quot;, whilst four-time American Olympic gold medalist Rowdy Gaines, commentating for NBC, said &quot;...he went into a balls-out sprint at 250 – and I have never seen anything like that...I have been around swimming a long time and it&#x27;s the most amazing swim I&#x27;ve ever seen, hands down.&quot; A formula used by the International Swimming Statisticians Association to compare world records in different events gave his performance the highest score of all current world records. Thorpe promptly donated the A$25,000 prize money for breaking the first world record in the pool to charity.

Later the same night, Thorpe anchored the Australians to a historic victory in the 4 × 100 m freestyle final, the first time the United States had lost the event. Thorpe set an Australian record relay split of 48.55 s. Even taking into account a 0.6–0.7 s for a flying relay start, his split time was almost 1 s faster than his individual best of 49.98 s. It was to be the first of many occasions in which he would anchor the Australian relay teams to victory over the Americans, with splits consistently faster than his equivalent individual times. The following night, in the semi-finals of the 200 m freestyle, Thorpe broke Hackett&#x27;s world record by 0.33 s, clocking 1 min 46.34 s. The next day in the final, he again broke the record, lowering it to 1 min 46.0 s. He finished his competition by leading off the 4 × 200 m freestyle team with Klim, Hackett and Bill Kirby to victory. Their time lowered their own world record by more than three seconds, completing Thorpe&#x27;s fourth world record in four nights.

Immediately after the Pan Pacific Championships, Thorpe&#x27;s management announced his signing to Adidas for an undisclosed six-figure sum, stating that he would race in their new bodysuit. This presented a dilemma, as the national team was sponsored and wore outfits designed by Speedo, leading to months of protracted discussions and uncertainty. To compound his commercial difficulties, Thorpe had an uncertain end to the sporting year when, in October, he broke a bone in his ankle whilst jogging. However his performance throughout the year was recognised when he was again named as the World Swimmer of the Year by &quot;Swimming World&quot;, and by Swimming Australia as its Swimmer of the Year. In a wider arena, he was named Young Australian of the Year, ABC Sports Star of the Year, and Male Athlete of the Year at the Australian Sports Awards.

===2000 Olympic build-up===
Thorpe started 2000 looking to add a third individual event to his Olympic schedule. He explored his options by contesting the 1500 m freestyle at the New South Wales Championships in January, which he won. Thorpe embarked on a European FINA World Cup tour to hone his racecraft, but this was overshadowed by comments made by German head coach Manfred Thiesmann accusing him of using steroids. Thiseman claimed that Thorpe&#x27;s physical attributes were symptomatic of steroid use and that his ability to exceed prior records believed to be drug-fuelled made his feats worthy of suspicion. Thorpe&#x27;s difficulties heightened at the subsequent German leg of the tour in Berlin, when a standoff over a drug-test arose when officials wanted to take an unsealed sample due to lack of containers. After the standoff was resolved, Thorpe proceeded to cut more than 1.5 s from his world short course record in the 200 m freestyle. Given the context of the race, Thorpe rated it as his best-ever performance, ahead of his victories at Olympic and World level. On returning from Europe, Thorpe faced further uncertainty until he was granted permission to wear his Adidas suit instead of the Australian uniforms provided by Speedo.

With the past uncertainties resolved, Thorpe proceeded to the Olympic selection trials at Sydney Olympic Park in May 2000. He again broke his 400 m world record on the first night of racing, lowering it to 3 min 41.33 s to earn his first Olympic selection. The following day, he lowered his 200 m world record to 1 min 45.69 s in the semi-finals, before lowering it again to 1 min 45.51 s in the final. His attempt to secure a third individual berth failed after he finished fourth in the final of the 100 m and withdrew from the 1500 m.

===2000 Summer Olympics===



Entering the Olympics, the Australian public expected Thorpe to deliver multiple world records and gold medals as a formality; Sydney&#x27;s &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; posted a front-page spread headlined &quot;Invincible&quot;. Thorpe cruised through the heats of the 400 m on the first morning of competition, posting a new Olympic record and shortening bookmakers&#x27; odds to 50–1. By the time the final was held that night, the pressure had intensified—the host nation had yet to win its first gold medal. Thorpe led throughout, and although Italy&#x27;s Massimiliano Rosolino was within a body length at the 300 m mark, Thorpe&#x27;s finishing kick extended the final margin to three body lengths. This set a new world record of 3 min 40.59 s. Secret tests carried out by the Italian National Olympic Committee prior to the Olympics later showed that Rosolino had abnormal levels of human growth hormone. Rosolino aside, Thorpe had left bronze medallist Klete Keller fifteen metres in arrears.

Thorpe lined up later in the night alongside Klim, Chris Fydler and Ashley Callus to anchor the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay, an event which the Americans had never lost at Olympic level. The third leg ended with Australia only an arm&#x27;s length ahead of the United States. Thorpe timed his dive much better than Gary Hall Jr., and surfaced a body length ahead. Hall&#x27;s sprinting ability allowed him to open a lead by the final turn, but Thorpe&#x27;s finishing kick overhauled him in the final metres, sparking wild celebrations amongst the partisan crowd.

Prior to the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay, Hall posted on his blog: &quot;My biased opinion says that we will smash them (Australia&#x27;s 4x100m team) like guitars. Historically the U.S. has always risen to the occasion. But the logic in that remote area of my brain says it won&#x27;t be so easy for the United States to dominate the waters this time.&quot; The Australian team responded to Hall&#x27;s remarks after the race by playing air guitar on the pool deck. Hall recalled the race, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t even know how to play the guitar...I consider it the best relay race I&#x27;ve ever been part of. I doff my cap to the great Ian Thorpe. He had a better finish than I had.&quot; Another member of Australia&#x27;s victorious 4x100 team, Michael Klim, recalled that &quot;Hall was the first swimmer to come over and congratulate us. Even though he dished it out, he was a true sportsman&quot;.

When Thorpe broke the 200 m freestyle Olympic record in the heats the following morning, his main rival Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands (with World No. 2 ranked and teammate Michael Kim bypassing the 200 metres) conceded defeat. However, van den Hoogenband showed his hand in the semi-finals by cutting more than a second off his personal best, to set a new world record of 1 min 45.35 s. Thorpe qualified second with a personal best of his own, 0.02 s slower, and was under immense pressure to win the final the following day after his double gold on the first night. Van den Hoogenband started quickly and Thorpe chased him, reaching the 100 m mark just 0.04 s behind. Both swimmers turned at 150 m in identical times. As a result of starting harder than usual, Thorpe faded as van den Hoogenband drew away to claim gold and equal his world record, stunning the home crowd. Thorpe touched in 1 min 45.83 s, the first time that he had swum slower in the final than in the qualifying rounds. Thorpe would never lose to van den Hoogenband in a long course 200 metres race again.

Thorpe returned to victory when he led off the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay the following night, setting up a 10 m lead over American Scott Goldblatt in the first leg. Although Thorpe was unable to reclaim the individual world record, he, Klim, Kirby and Todd Pearson lowered their world record to 7 min 07.05 s, over five seconds ahead of the Americans—the largest winning margin in an Olympic relay for half a century. Thorpe rounded off his Olympics by swimming in the heats of the 4 × 100 m medley relay, and collected a silver medal when the finals quartet finished behind the Americans. Thorpe&#x27;s performances as Australia&#x27;s leading medalist for the Games were recognised when the Australian Olympic Committee granted him the honour of carrying the flag at the closing ceremony. With three gold and two silver medals, Thorpe was the most successful athlete at the 2000 Olympic Games. At year&#x27;s end, he was again named by Swimming Australia as the Swimmer of the Year, but van den Hoogenband usurped him as the leading male swimmer chosen by &quot;Swimming World Magazine&quot;.

===2001 World Aquatics Championships===


With the 2001 Australian Championships held in Hobart in March, Thorpe added the 800 m freestyle to his repertoire, after FINA had added the event for the 2001 World Aquatics Championships. Thorpe began his campaign by successfully defending his 400 m title with a time just 0.17 s outside his world record. The following night in the 800 m event, he drew away from Hackett in the last 100 m to break Kieren Perkins&#x27; 1994 world record by over four seconds. He earned his third title by cutting 0.66 s from van den Hoogenband&#x27;s 200 m world record to set a new mark of 1 min 44.69 s. This performance made him the third male after John Konrads and Tim Shaw to hold world records over three distances simultaneously. His subsequent victory in the 100 m freestyle in a new personal best of 49.05 s made him the first since Konrads in 1959 to hold all Australian freestyle titles from 100 m to 800 m. This indicated that he could swim faster at the subsequent World Championships in Fukuoka, where he was looking to regain the ascendancy from van den Hoogenband.

Thorpe arrived in Fukuoka having been chosen by broadcaster TV Asahi as the marketing drawcard of the event. With the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay being held after the 400 m freestyle on the first night, Thorpe appeared to be conserving energy when he reached the 200 m mark two seconds outside his world record. Although he was 0.93 s behind at the final turn, a final 50 m burst in 24.36 s saw him cut a further 0.42 s from his world record. The relay saw him dive in fractionally ahead of American Jason Lezak after Klim, Callus and Pearson had completed the first three legs. Thorpe fell behind in the early half of the leg before kicking away in the closing stages, to seal gold with his fastest-ever relay split of 47.87 s. In the 800 m final, he shadowed Hackett for the first 750 m, staying within a body length. He then broke clear to win by a body length, lowering his world record by over two seconds. The 200 m freestyle rematch with van den Hoogenband provided Thorpe with a chance to rectify his strategy from the Olympics; this time he allowed the Dutchman to lead through the first 100 m. Thorpe pulled even at the 150 m mark and then broke away towards the finishing wall two body lengths clear. He lowered his world record to 1 min 44.06 s in the process, prompting van den Hoogenband to raise his arm aloft.

Thorpe&#x27;s winning streak was interrupted in the 100 m freestyle when his personal best of 48.81 s placed him fourth, but he returned to form in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay. Anchoring the team of Klim, Hackett and Kirby, the Australians lowered their world record time by more than two seconds, leaving the Italians more than six seconds in arrears. Having overtaken Klim as Australia&#x27;s leading 100 m freestyle swimmer, Thorpe was entrusted with anchoring the 4 × 100 m medley relay team on 28 July. After Matt Welsh, Regan Harrison and Geoff Huegill had finished their legs, Thorpe&#x27;s change left him half a body length behind the new 100 m world champion Anthony Ervin of the United States. The Americans were expected to win, and with his typically slow start, Thorpe turned a body length behind with 50 m remaining. With an American victory seeming inevitable, Thorpe managed to accelerate and deprive Ervin of the lead in the last 5 m. This made Thorpe the only swimmer to have won six gold medals at a World Championships, and the first since Shaw in 1974 to win the 200–400–800 treble. His performances formed the basis for Australia&#x27;s gold medal win over the United States 13–9. It was also the first time since the 1956 Summer Olympics that Australia had topped the medal tally at a global meet. Thorpe&#x27;s achievements led to predictions that he could match Mark Spitz&#x27;s seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer Olympics, which he played down.

===2002 Commonwealth Games and Pan Pacific Championships===
Thorpe began competition in 2002 at the Australian Championships in Brisbane in March, which were used to select the team for the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester and the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships. After his record six gold medals in Fukuoka, the meet was surrounded by further expectations of world records and speculation that he would match Spitz&#x27;s seven gold medals. His winning time in the 400 m was the second fastest in history, but such was the expectation on him that his failure to break a world record was the talking point. He claimed the 100 m and 200 m events in times outside his best, making it the first time that he had failed to break a world record at a major meet since 1999. He also experimented by adding the 100 m backstroke to his repertoire, placing second. This earned him a Commonwealth spot in a seventh event, leading to further media speculation that he could match Spitz.



By this time, Thorpe&#x27;s relationship with Frost was beginning to unravel. Thorpe had always insisted that his swimming was about enjoyment and improving himself in setting faster times, rather than victory or defeat. This contrasted with Frost, who had a more aggressive and combative mindset, often making bold public statements. Thorpe ignored Frost&#x27;s advice and bulked up his upper body by a further 5 kg to 105 kg, making him the heaviest elite swimmer in history. His reasoning that the strength gains would outweigh any loss in flexibility raised concerns over his physiological strategy. On the first night in Manchester, Thorpe again lowered his 400 m mark by 0.09 s to 3 min 40.08 s, which remains the fastest ever 400m swim not swum in an LZR Racer before anchoring the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay team to another gold. Prior to the 200 m final, Thorpe was seen arguing with Frost in the warm-up area. Thorpe won, but was unusually angry at having failed to lower his previous best, publicly stating that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t with it&quot; and that he had &quot;one of the worst warm-ups ever&quot;. Thorpe did manage to lower his personal best in the 100 m freestyle to 48.73 s en route to his fourth gold, and anchored the 4 × 200 m freestyle and 4 × 100 m medley relays to comfortable victories. When he collected a silver in his first international race in the 100 m backstroke with another personal best behind world champion Matt Welsh, he was forced to rebuff media comparisons to Spitz. He emphasised personal performance, stating &quot;I think it&#x27;s a limiting attitude to be competing against other people when you can be challenging yourself&quot;. Despite Thorpe&#x27;s assertion that he could not match Spitz, Frost predicted that Thorpe could win nine golds at one Olympics. In spite of the media disappointment, Thorpe&#x27;s six gold medals equalled the record set by Susie O&#x27;Neill, completing all in Games or World record time. As a result, he was awarded the honour of carrying the flag at the closing ceremony.


The Pan Pacific Championships followed in Yokohama less than a month later, with media speculation about Thorpe and Frost overshadowing the racing. Thorpe began his campaign with a victory over Hackett in the 400 m freestyle in a time five seconds outside his world record. Afterwards, he revealed that both he and Hackett had deliberately conserved energy for the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay later in the night. Australia subsequently won the relay, with Thorpe again overtaking Jason Lezak in the last 50 m. He subsequently won the 200 m freestyle, and anchored the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay to victory to take his tally to four golds. After qualifying second in the 100 m freestyle, Thorpe came from fourth at the 50 m mark win his fifth gold in a time of 48.84 s. Thorpe&#x27;s run ended in the 4 × 100 m medley relay final, when despite setting the second fastest ever relay split of 47.20 s, Australia were defeated.

==Tracey Menzies era (2003–2006)==
After the 2002 Pan Pacific Championships, Thorpe announced that he was splitting with Frost to train with one of his assistants, Tracey Menzies, who had no prior international experience. Admitting that tension existed between him and Frost, Thorpe asserted that the split was amicable. He cited waning motivation for the split, stating &quot;I decided I either had to make the change or it was to walk away from the sport&quot;. The retired Talbot expressed concerns that Thorpe was making a decision whilst he was physically and emotionally drained, while other coaches felt that the new relationship would end up with Thorpe, rather than Menzies, making the decisions. Despite a turbulent year, he was again named by &quot;Swimming World&quot; as its World Swimmer of the Year.

Along with the switch of coaches, Thorpe indicated that he would put more focus on improving his sprinting ability. He thus dropped the 800 m freestyle despite being the reigning world champion and record holder. During this period, his times in the 400 m and 200 m freestyle deteriorated, and both he and Menzies were criticised. The criticism continued to mount during their partnership, particularly during the build-up to the 2004 Olympics. Following his victory in the 200 and 400 events in Athens, Thorpe said that his results justified his decision, despite posting substantially faster times as a young swimmer under Frost.

In May 2002, Thorpe also hosted the Australian reality television show &quot;Undercover Angels&quot; on the Seven Network. The show ran for 11 episodes and was widely panned by media critics.

===2003 World Aquatics Championships===



The first major test of Thorpe&#x27;s partnership with Menzies came at the Australian Championships held in Sydney in March. Thorpe did not threaten any of his world records, completing the 400 m and 200 m freestyle more than two and one seconds respectively off his best. Despite defeating Hackett in both races to retain his titles, he later admitted that he was &quot;pretty disappointed&quot; with his performances. When he tied with Ashley Callus in a time of 49.05 s, he was criticised by &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; which stated &quot;The measure of Thorpe&#x27;s sprinting ability is that he could only match the efforts of a virus-riddled Callus&quot;. Thorpe found some relief by setting a new Commonwealth record of 2 min 00.11 s in his first long course 200 m individual medley outing, the fifth fastest time in the past year. Thorpe attracted further criticism when he withdrew from the inaugural Duel in the Pool with a medical complaint, despite travelling overseas for commercial and charity work.

Thorpe arrived for the 2003 World Championships in Barcelona for his first major international competition since Menzies&#x27; appointment under heavy media scrutiny following his non-improvement at the Australian Championships. On the first night of competition Thorpe defeated Hackett in the 400 m freestyle in a time 2.5 s outside his world record, making him the first to win three world titles in the same event. After his relatively slow 400 m, he was again under pressure in the 200 m freestyle after van den Hoogenband led at the 100 m mark ahead of world record pace. Thorpe managed to respond and retain his world title, and gained some relief after his sprint training yielded his first medal in the 100 m freestyle at a global competition; he finished third in 48.77 s. In all three freestyle events however, he had swum slower than his times under Frost. He ended his individual campaign on a promising note with his experiment with the 200 m individual medley, setting a new personal best of 1 min 59.66 s to claim silver. Thorpe again anchored the 4 × 200 m freestyle team to retain the world title along with Hackett, Nicholas Sprenger and Craig Stevens, with a reduced margin over the Americans, who finished less than two seconds in arrears. Michael Klim&#x27;s injuries left the relay teams weakened, with Thorpe anchoring the 4 × 100 m freestyle team to fourth, At the end of a difficult year in the water, his standing had fallen in the eyes of &quot;Swimming World&quot;, who rated him fourth in the world. He was again named as Australian Swimmer of the Year, jointly with Hackett.

===2004 Summer Olympics===


After his feats at the 2003 World Championships, Speedo had generated significant media publicity by offering Michael Phelps US$1 million if he could match Spitz&#x27;s seven golds. Thorpe was adamant that this was impossible, and scrapped his seventh event, the 200 m individual medley from his Olympic program. In late March 2004 at the Australian Championships in Sydney, Thorpe overbalanced whilst on the blocks in the heats of the 400 m freestyle and fell into the water, resulting in his disqualification and ending the defence of his Olympic 400 m title. This resulted in a large debate among the swimming and public community as to whether Thorpe should be given an exception to Australia&#x27;s policy of selecting the first and second place getters, with Prime Minister of Australia John Howard describing the situation as a &quot;tragedy&quot;. Despite the intense media spotlight, Thorpe managed to win the 100 m and 200 m freestyle events to ensure his selection for Athens. Craig Stevens, who had claimed the second qualifying position in the 400 m event, subsequently faced immense public pressure to relinquish his position to Thorpe, and later did so in a television interview for which he was paid. This generated ethical debate as to whether Stevens&#x27; decision had been bought, and criticism against Thorpe.

The pressure in the lead-up was further compounded by the media attention surrounding Phelps, who had decided that the 200 m freestyle would be one of the events in his quest for eight gold medals. This prompted many media outlets to label the race between Thorpe, van den Hoogenband, Phelps and Hackett as &quot;The Race of the Century&quot;. With the press spotlight growing, Thorpe tried to avoid media attention, resulting in a few terse media events. Thorpe&#x27;s increasing focus on the 100 m event, coupled with the media pressure, resulted in speculation that he was vulnerable to Hackett in the 400 m event. Thorpe made a slow start in the final, reaching the 100 m mark one second outside world record pace. In a topsy-turvy performance at irregular pace, there were multiple changes of lead before Thorpe established a body-length lead by 350 m. He was closed down by Hackett, holding on by only 0.26 s in a time three seconds outside his own world record.

With Klim recently returning from a two-year injury layoff, and Callus ill, Thorpe could only anchor Australia to sixth in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay. The 200 m began with van den Hoogenband again attacking immediately, reaching the 100 m mark more than a second under the world record split, with Thorpe half a body length behind. Thorpe gradually reduced the lead before passing van den Hoogenband in the last 50 m to win &quot;The Race of the Century&quot; by half a body length, in a new Olympic record of 1 min 44.71 s. Having achieved what had eluded him four years earlier, Thorpe reacted emotionally, immediately tearing off his cap, punching the air and screaming. The next day saw six years of Australian victory in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay ended when Hackett, Klim and Sprenger had put Thorpe into the final leg 1.48 s behind Keller. Thorpe gradually reduced the margin but was unable to pass Keller in the last lap, the United States touching 0.13 s earlier. Thorpe found himself on the other side of a close result when he qualified last for the 100 m freestyle by 0.01 s. He capitalised in the final by coming from sixth at the 50 m mark to win bronze medal in a personal best of 48.56 s, making him the only person to medal in the 100–200–400 combination in Olympic history. After the Athens Olympics, Thorpe took a break from competitive swimming, skipping the 2005 World Aquatics Championships.

===2006: Attempted return and retirement===
Thorpe returned to competition at the New South Wales Championships in December 2005. He raced in the 200 m and stated his intention to retire after the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Thorpe announced that due to a desire to concentrate on the 100 m freestyle, he had dropped his pet event, the 400 m. He was unmoved by national coach Alan Thompson, who implored him to continue swimming the event. In February, Thorpe qualified for the 2006 Commonwealth Games by winning the 100 m and 200 m freestyle in times of 49.24 s and 1 min 46.42 s respectively. He expressed disappointment with his performances; he speculated that he may have misjudged his new training schedule and anticipated further improvement.

Soon after, Thorpe announced his withdrawal from the Commonwealth Games due to a bout of bronchitis, which had stopped him from training. Thorpe&#x27;s illness was later diagnosed as a strain of glandular fever, and after a further delay caused by a broken hand, he moved to the United States in July to work with Dave Salo. Further disruption followed when the Australian switched coaches, citing excessive and ongoing media attention. Thorpe&#x27;s stay was constantly surrounded by rumours that he was suffering from ill discipline; this fuelled speculation that his international career was on the decline.

Upon his return to Australia, Thorpe withdrew from the selection trials for the 2007 World Championships and announced his retirement on 21 November 2006. Thorpe said that he had been contemplating retirement for some time, but was afraid of the future because swimming had given him a &quot;safety blanket&quot;. Thorpe stated that he retired despite reaching higher levels of fitness, noting &quot;As I got fit, physically fit, my mind also got fit&quot;. He said a clear mind allowed him to reach his decision. He was close to tears when thanking the Australian public, but declared that his retirement was a &quot;joyous&quot; occasion of celebration.

In 2007, the French sports newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; claimed that Thorpe &quot;showed &#x27;abnormal levels&#x27; of two banned substances in a doping test&quot; in 2006 prior to his retirement. Thorpe denied the charges. The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) confirmed that they had investigated Thorpe in the past, for abnormal levels of testosterone and luteinising hormone (LH), but had dismissed the result. FINA dropped its investigation and closed the case. Thorpe has never been found to have used banned substances, and has denied allegations against him while also speaking out against drug use. He has called for the introduction of blood testing, promised to surrender a frozen sample for retrospective testing and repeatedly criticised FINA for drug-testing procedures that he regards as inadequate.

==Comeback (2011–2012)==
In February 2011, Thorpe announced that he would come out of retirement and attempt to qualify for the 2012 Olympics in London. Thorpe&#x27;s major focus was the 100 m and 200 m freestyle at 2012&#x27;s trials, stating he could offer the most value to the Australian team in the relays. He would not swim the 400 m, claiming he would not have enough time to build up endurance for that event.

Thorpe swam the 100 m butterfly and 100 m medley in Singapore (4–5 November) and Beijing (8–9 November) before also taking on the 100 m freestyle in the Tokyo (12–13 November) round of the 2011 FINA Swimming World Cup.

===2012: Australian Olympic Trials and aftermath===
Thorpe&#x27;s comeback attempt in the 200 m freestyle came to an abrupt end on Day Two of Australia&#x27;s Olympic Trials in Adelaide, on 16 March 2012. No longer allowed to wear the full-body racing suit (covering from neck to ankles and wrists) banned by FINA rule changes, he competed wearing just the &quot;jammer&quot; (hip to thigh) racing shorts. He swam very well in the morning heats, cruising to 1:49.18, a time which placed him equal fifth fastest. However, in the semi-finals that evening he faded over the last 100 metres, finishing in 12th place at 1:49.91. Speaking to reporters immediately afterwards, Thorpe said, &quot;The last 100 was a struggle, I&#x27;m not sure why. This was slower than what I swam this morning, probably the inexperience of racing in the last 18 months held me up. The fairytale has turned into a nightmare.&quot; In the 100 m freestyle on day 3 (17 March), Thorpe won his heat (the 9th of 12) but failed to break 50 seconds and did not advance to the semi-finals with the top 16 sprinters. Thus, his bid to qualify for the London Olympics officially ended.

It was subsequently announced that Thorpe was targeting qualification for the 2013 World Championships in Barcelona and later the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, but was forced to abandon his plans due to a shoulder injury.

==Athletic attributes==
Thorpe&#x27;s success has been attributed to his work ethic, mental strength, powerful kick, ability to accelerate and a physiology suited to swimming. This led former Australian head coach Don Talbot to label him as &quot;the greatest swimmer the world has seen&quot;. Although &quot;Swimming World&quot; labelled Thorpe&#x27;s technique as &quot;extraordinary&quot; and &quot;superior&quot;, Talbot disagreed, stating his belief that Thorpe relied on his kick too heavily at the expense of his arms. He also cited Thorpe&#x27;s ability to manage his workload and his day-to-day recovery between races during a meet as a deficiency. Thorpe was known for using his trademark six-beat kick to power away from his rivals in the closing stages of races, the effectiveness of which was attributed to his unusually large size 17 feet.

Following his retirement, head coach of the US men&#x27;s swimming team Bob Bowman—who also mentors Michael Phelps—called Thorpe &quot;the greatest middle-distance swimmer of all time and...the greatest relay swimmer I have seen&quot;. Bowman further cited Thorpe&#x27;s ability to raise the profile and popularity of swimming, noting that Phelps&#x27; public image was modelled on that of the Australian. Australian Olympic Committee President John Coates stated that &quot;In 50 years from now Australians will still marvel at the feats of Ian Thorpe&quot;. Dawn Fraser, the first of only two swimmers to win the same Olympic event three times, said that Thorpe was the &quot;greatest [freestyle] swimmer in the world&quot;, and lamented that he would not be attempting a hat-trick of 400 m titles.

==Honours==
Aside from his swimming achievements, Thorpe has received numerous honours and accolades during his life, including:
*2000: Young Australian of the Year
*2000: The Australian Sports Medal as &quot;Commonwealth Games Pan Pacific World Record Holder&quot;.
*2001: Awarded Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for service to sport as a gold medallist at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.
*2001: The Centenary Medal for &quot;service to Australian society through the sport of swimming&quot;.
*2007: Ian Thorpe Aquatic and Fitness Centre in Ultimo, Sydney named in his honour.
*2012: Awarded Human Rights Medal for his charity work with Indigenous children.
*2013: Conferred an honorary Doctor of Letters by the University of Western Sydney for his support for health and education services for Indigenous youth.
*2014: Conferred an honorary Doctor of Letters by the Macquarie University in recognition of his extraordinary contribution for the sport, philanthropy and Indigenous rights.
*2019: Advanced to Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in recognition of his &quot;significant service to youth and Indigenous education through charitable initiatives, and to swimming.&quot;
*2022: Swimming Australia Hall of Fame inaugural inductee.

==Post-swimming career==
Thorpe presented a two-part television documentary called &quot;Bullied&quot; on ABC Television, using hidden-camera footage to give a victim&#x27;s-eye-view of bullying. It aired 14 March 2017. In 2021, Thorpe competed in Celebrity MasterChef Australia (series 2) and was fourth to be eliminated. During the series, the judges referred to Thorpe having written two cookbooks, &quot;Cook For Your Life&quot;, published in 2011 and &quot;Eat Well Now&quot;, released in 2016.

==Personal life==

===Sexuality===
In a July 2014 televised interview with British talk show host Michael Parkinson, Thorpe came out as gay, after years of denying his homosexuality publicly. He stated &quot;I&#x27;m comfortable saying I&#x27;m a gay man. And I don&#x27;t want people to feel the same way I did. You can grow up, you can be comfortable and you can be gay.&quot; He added &quot;I am telling the world that I am gay… and I hope this makes it easier for others now, and even if you&#x27;ve held it in for years, it feels easier to get it out.&quot; In 2016 he began dating model Ryan Channing. In December 2017, he said he did not plan to marry his boyfriend &quot;any time soon&quot;. He would like to become a father.

In June 2019, Thorpe split with Channing. Channing later died in Bali, Indonesia in May 2022.

In September 2020, the International Olympic Committee published a question and answer format interview with Thorpe, which touched on his sexual orientation and some of the challenges he faced due to his homosexuality in competitive swimming.

===Activism===
In the lead up to the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey, Thorpe campaigned for a &#x27;yes&#x27; vote, encouraging people to enroll to vote at the City2Surf. He later appeared in a campaign advertisement with his partner saying Thorpe could update his electoral details faster than he could swim 100 metres.

===Sponsorship===
Thorpe is known for his interests in fashion, and serves as an ambassador for Armani, and has his own line of designer jewellery and underwear. During his career, Thorpe was one of the most prominent and popular sportspeople in Australia. Despite competing in a sport in which the vast majority of international athletes&#x27; earnings are below the poverty line, marketing surveys consistently ranked Thorpe as the most sought-after Australian athlete for sponsorship deals, surpassing footballers who compete on a weekly basis in much larger stadia. Aside from his swimsuit sponsor Adidas, Thorpe was sponsored by Australian corporate giants such as Qantas, Telstra, and the Seven Network.

Thorpe&#x27;s interests in fashion and culture led him to make frequent visits to New York City—which he describes as a second home—often for engagements with Armani and particularly because of the city&#x27;s status as a global fashion capital. He was present at the World Trade Center on the morning of 11 September 2001, having stopped there on his jog, before returning to his hotel after forgetting his camera. It was during this trip that he appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, which was notable because of the relative lack of interest in competitive swimming in America. Thorpe later became a spokesperson for the unsuccessful New York bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, even promising to continue his career until the games if New York won the hosting rights. Thorpe&#x27;s interests have also seen him involved in television. In 2002, he played the lead role in the reality television show &quot;Undercover Angels&quot;, which imitated the &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; series. In the program, Thorpe directed three young women who performed good deeds for people in need. Although it averaged more than a million viewers per episode, it was widely panned by critics. Thorpe has also appeared as an extra in the American sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;.

Thorpe is widely popular in Asia, particularly Japan. In 2000, TV Asahi identified him as the swimmer likely to be the most successful at the 2001 World Championships in Fukuoka, so they selected him as the event&#x27;s marketing figurehead. In the lead-up, Thorpe visited Japan to promote Asahi in a series of television events, and upon returning for the competition, he was mobbed at the airport by youthful crowds 25 m deep; hundreds camped outside the Australian team&#x27;s hotel. He was also praised by older sections of Japanese society as a role model for youth, due to what they interpreted as his humility and work ethic. It was estimated that more than 80% of the Japanese public watched his races on television. In 2002, in the wake of a tourism slump after 11 September terrorist attacks, Thorpe agreed to be an ambassador for the Australian Tourism Commission in Japan. The high-profile campaign included a meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. The marketing drive resulted in an upturn in Japanese tourism to Australia, which was credited to Thorpe. In 2005, Yakult released a &#x27;Thorpedo&#x27; energy drink—which featured a picture of the swimmer on the bottle—in Japan. This was part of an equity deal with the So Natural food group, in which Thorpe was given a 5% stake in the company—at the time worth A$1.1 m—in return for the use of his name and image on their products. The 15-year deal covers East and Southeast Asia and Thorpe&#x27;s share in the venture could increase to 50% depending on its success.

===Philanthropy===
More recently, Thorpe has also emerged as a philanthropist, starting the charity &quot;Ian Thorpe&#x27;s Fountain for Youth&quot; in 2000. The organisation raises funds for research into childhood illnesses and sponsors a school in Beijing for orphaned children with disabilities. In addition, it works with The Fred Hollows Foundation to improve health standards and living conditions in Australian aboriginal communities. Citing a wish to &quot;...work directly with our Aboriginal partners and not compete for the meagre funding available from public and corporate donations&quot; the organisation was liquidated in 2014.

===Depression===
In 2014, it was confirmed that Thorpe had been admitted to a rehabilitation clinic after neighbours found him dazed near his parents&#x27; Panania home. Thorpe was taken to Bankstown Hospital by police before being admitted to a rehabilitation clinic. In his 2012 autobiography &quot;This is Me&quot;, Thorpe stated he had considered suicide and had drunk &#x27;huge quantities&#x27; of alcohol to deal with &#x27;crippling depression&#x27;.

<text>The October Manifesto (), officially &quot;The Manifesto on the Improvement of the State Order&quot; (), is a document that served as a precursor to the Russian Empire&#x27;s first Constitution, which was adopted the following year in 1906. The Manifesto was issued by Tsar Nicholas II (1868–1918, ruled 1894–1917), under the influence of Sergei Witte (1849–1915), on as a response to the Russian Revolution of 1905. Nicholas strenuously resisted these ideas, but gave in after his first choice to head a military dictatorship, Grand Duke Nicholas, threatened to shoot himself in the head if the Tsar did not accept Witte&#x27;s suggestion. Nicholas reluctantly agreed, and issued what became known as the October Manifesto, promising certain civil rights and an elected parliament called the Duma, without whose approval no laws were to be enacted in Russia in the future. According to his memoirs, Witte did not force the Tsar to sign the October Manifesto, which was proclaimed in all the churches.

==Prelude==
While France, Great Britain, and the United States had chosen democracy in one form or another, the Russian Empire maintained its ancient autocratic government, headed by the Tsar. Russia had in the early 1890s, under the guidance of Minister of Finance Sergei Witte, embarked on a state-led programme of industrialization through foreign investments and the imposition of tariffs.

However, the rapid growth in industry during this period was not met by political reform, leading an expanding working class to become heavily discontented. Nonetheless, peasants still formed 80% of the population and, despite the emancipation of the serfs by Tsar Alexander II, agrarian problems were still marked. Russia, remaining a mostly agricultural economy, created economic issues and conflict between the differing social classes, as well as the government of the Russian Autocracy. 
The conflict created by Russia’s economic and political issues climaxed in the months prior to October 1905, also known as the Russian Revolution of 1905. On 22 January 1905, peaceful protesters attempted to bring a petition to the Tsar, as was the tradition. However this protest was violently put down outside the Winter Palace when guards were ordered to fire on the protesters. The result of the violent revolt of the protest would be known as &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;. The violent reaction to the protest increased the tension throughout Russia further. Unrest amongst the Russian people followed Bloody Sunday. By the thousands people refused to go to work and general strike crippled the Empire. Unrest eventually spread to the Russian countryside where peasants began to burn their masters&#x27; manors as the Russian people revolted against the autocracy. With Russia’s communication, transportation and public services crippled by the strikes, Nicholas II was forced to act before he lost power completely.

==Nicholas II&#x27;s opposition to reform==
Although Russia was at a major standstill with violent revolts terrorizing the nation, Nicholas II still opposed any reforms that involved limiting the autocracy. Nicholas felt that it was not his place to limit a system created by his ancestors and is quoted as saying &quot;I cannot squander a legacy that is not mine to squander.&quot; Nicholas could not bring himself to understand that the Russian people wished to limit his power, which he had increasingly used against them. This opposition towards the reform is of course argued to be due to his upbringing of autocratic beliefs.

==Provisions==
The October Manifesto addressed the unrest application throughout the Russian Empire and pledged to grant certain civil liberties, including 
*To grant to the population the essential foundations of civil freedoms based on the principles of genuine inviolability of the person, freedom of conscience, speech, assembly and association.
* Without postponing the scheduled elections to the State Duma, to admit to participation in the Duma (insofar as possible in the short time that remains before it is scheduled to convene) of all those classes of the population that now are completely deprived of voting rights; and to leave the further development of a general statute on elections to the future legislative order.
*To establish as an unbreakable rule that no law shall take effect without confirmation by the State Duma and that the elected representatives of the people shall be guaranteed the opportunity to participate in the supervision of the legality of the actions of our appointed officials.
*The Manifesto also introduced universal manhood suffrage in Russia which was common in some Western countries, such as France, Germany and the United States.

This document, although granting certain rights to the Russian people, did not guarantee that the Russian government would function in a democratic way. Instead, the Manifesto just stated that the people now had certain rights and a voice in legislation.

The freedom of religion clause outraged the Russian Orthodox Church because it allowed people to convert to evangelical Protestantism, which they denounced as heresy.

==The Duma==
One provision of the Manifesto was the creation of a legislative body in Russia, which was intended to limit the power of the Autocrat in favour of the Russian people. The legislative body known as the Duma was flawed from its inception. One major flaw of the Duma was that the Tsar maintained the power to veto any legislation that he wished. The Duma was also weakened by the influence of the Russian bureaucracy, as well as the fact that the body could be disbanded by Nicholas if he and the Duma could not reach an agreement.

==Opposition==

The October Manifesto divided opposition to the Emperor. The Kadets were appeased by the idea of having freedom of speech and a truly representative government, as was the Union of October 17 (informally known as the &quot;Octobrists&quot;).

==Effects==
The Manifesto enjoyed a short-lived success. The strikes and much of the violence ended almost as soon as it was published. Enthusiasm swept the nation as people realised their new-found freedom and the idea of having representation in the government. This manifesto also sprouted the Octobrists.

However, some of the population opposed the reforms. October 19–20 marked the second Kishinev pogrom against the Jewish community there, which started as a protest against the Manifesto.

The immediate success of the Manifesto, however, was followed by a return to the cycle of strikes and violence as the autocracy gradually reaffirmed its power. Within months, executions of armed revolutionaries were numbering more than a thousand. The government began suppressing political parties; by 1906–07 much of Russia was under martial law. This was relaxed after the end of the revolution in 1907.

<text>Chaozhou (), alternatively Chiuchow, Chaochow or Teochew, is a city in the eastern Guangdong province of China. It borders Shantou to the south, Jieyang to the southwest, Meizhou to the northwest, the province of Fujian to the east, and the South China Sea to the southeast. It is administered as a prefecture-level city with a jurisdiction area of and a total population of 2,568,387. It is also the ancestral hometown of 2.7 million overseas Teochow people.

Its built-up (or metro) area encompassing most of Shantou and Jieyang cities was home to 12,543,024 inhabitants on 13 local administrative areas.
Along with Shantou and Jieyang, Chaozhou is a cultural center of the Chaoshan region.
==History==
In 214 BC, Chaozhou was an undeveloped part of Nanhai Commandery () of the Qin dynasty. In 331 during the Eastern Jin dynasty, Haiyang () was established as a part of Dongguan Commandery ().

The Dongguan Commandery was renamed Yi&#x27;an Commandery () in 413. The commandery became a prefecture in 590 during the early Sui dynasty, first as Xun Prefecture (), then as Chao Prefecture () in the following year. In 1914, the Republic of China government combined the Chao and Xun prefectures into Chaoxun Prefecture or Chaoxun Circuit ().

For a short while in the Sui and early Tang dynasties, Haiyang District was called Yi&#x27;an District (). The name remained Haiyang until 1914, when it was renamed to Chao&#x27;an County () to avoid ambiguity with the Haiyang County, Shandong.

===Modern era===
The seat of the 1951 Guangdong People&#x27;s Government was in Chao&#x27;an County. Part of the county was converted into Chao&#x27;an City in 1953, and was renamed Chaozhou City (county-level) later that year. In 1955, the provincial seat moved to Shantou; the city was abolished five years later, and was reestablished in 1979. In 1983, the situation was reversed, as Chao&#x27;an was merged into Chaozhou City. Chaozhou was made a provincially-administered city in January 1989, and a vice-prefecture-level city in January 1990. In December 1991, Chaozhou was further upgraded to its current statue of prefecture-level city.

Chaozhou and the nearby cities of Shantou and Jieyang are collectively called Chaoshan or Teochew. From 1958 until 1983, this name was used for the joint political-administrative area which encompassed the three cities. For the next five years, Shantou City was a higher-level city, containing Chaozhou and Jieyang within it. Currently, Chaozhou, Shantou and Jieyang are equal in status.

In 2022, the city&#x27;s 5-year plan has detailed the realization of a 43.3-gigawatt offshore windfarm located between 47 and 115 miles (75 and 185 km) off the city&#x27;s coast.

==Geography==
Chaozhou is located in the easternmost part of the Guangdong Province, north of the coastal Shantou City. It is situated north of the delta of the Han River, which flows throughout the city.

The Chaozhou territory is mountainous. In particular, the nearby Phoenix Mountain&#x27;s peak is located above sea level. The main nearby rivers are the Huanggang River and the Han River. The Han River flows from west to southeast, and ramps through downtown Chaozhou; the Huanggang river flows roughly from north to south through the territory of Raoping, emptying into the sea. These two rivers provide abundant water for Chaozhou. Hills account for 65% of the total land area within the city, mainly in Raoping and Northern Chaoan. To the north of the city, there is a wide mountainous area suitable for tea cultivation; the lower-altitude areas nearby are mainly suitable for growing bamboo, peach, plum, olive, and pineapple. On the banks of the Han River, there is fertile land used for rice, sweet potato, peanut, soybean, carrot, orange, peach, and banana cultivation.

The three peaks of Jinshan (), Mingshan (), and Dushan () are collectively known as the &quot;Sanshan Guowang&quot; () or Lords of the Three Mountains, and are venerated in temples, particularly by the Hakka people worldwide.

==Climate==
==Administrative divisions==
Chaozhou&#x27;s municipal executive, legislature and judiciary are situated in Xiangqiao District, together with its CPC and Public Security bureau.

==Language==

The Teochew dialect (), by which the Chaozhou culture is conveyed, is a dialect of Southern Min. It is one of the most conservative Chinese dialects because it preserves many contrasts from ancient Chinese (Classical Chinese) that have been lost in some of the other modern dialects of Chinese. (See the Teochew dialect transcription of the poem &quot;Shi shi shi shi shi&quot; to note how words which have become homophonic in other dialects stay distinct in Teochew.)

The dialect is spoken by about 10 million people in Chaozhou and approximately 2–5 million people overseas. Thirty percent of Chinese residents of Vietnam speak this dialect. Teochew people are the largest ethnic Chinese group in Thailand and Cambodia, and the second largest ethnic Chinese group in Singapore, after the Hokkien. However, in Singapore, Mandarin is gradually supplanting the Teochew topolect as the mother tongue for this group, especially among younger generations.

==Culture==
Chaozhou is famously known as a globally renowned cultural center of the Lingnan region of China. Throughout China&#x27;s turbulent history, the Chaozhou region was nonetheless able to flourish and thrive, enabling the nourishing of a unique and distinctive character epitomized in the city&#x27;s native dialect, ceramics, opera, cuisine, Fenghuang Dancong tea, music, style of lion dance, embroidery and another needlework called drawnwork.

Chaozhou opera () is a traditional art form which has a history of more than 500 years and is now appreciated by 20 million Chaozhou natives in over 20 countries and regions. Based on the local folk dances and ballads, Chaozhou opera has formed its own style under the influence of Nanxi Opera. Nanxi is one of the oldest Chinese operas and originated in the Song dynasty. Clowns and females are the most distinctive characters in a Chaozhou opera, and fan-playing and acrobatic skills are more prominent than in other types of performances.

Kung fu tea, the &#x27;espresso&#x27; of Chinese teas with a formidable kick, which was first created in the Song dynasty, is still flourishing and remains an important part of social etiquette in Chaozhou. Visitors to local families can be sure of at least one round of Kung Fu tea. Though it tastes bitter when it first reaches the mouth, Kung Fu tea renowned for its lingering aftertaste.

At the local teahouse, tea service is often accompanied by Chaozhou music. String music, gong and drum music and the ancient music of set flutes are the traditional forms of Chaozhou music. Chaozhou string music is made up of mostly plucked and bowed string instruments, and on some occasions, wind instruments are used. The most characteristic instruments are the &quot;rihin&quot; (), &quot;tihu&quot;, &quot;yehu&quot; (all two-stringed bowed lutes), and the &quot;sanxian&quot;, &quot;pipa&quot;, &quot;ruan&quot;, &quot;guzheng&quot;, and &quot;yangqin&quot;. The number of instruments and performers in an ensemble is flexible and depends on the availability of instruments and musicians to play them – but to have an even and balanced texture, only one of each instrument is preferred. Chaozhou drum music ensembles includes the big drum and gong, the small drum and gong, the dizi set, drum and gong and su, drum and gong combinations. The current Chaozhou drum music is said to be similar to the form of drum and wind music during the Han and Tang dynasties. The Chaozhou &quot;guzheng&quot; and &quot;erhu&quot; are also regarded as major members of the southern instrument family.

The region is most widely known for the origin of &#x27;Bak Kut Teh&#x27; (), loosely translated in dialect as &#x27;Meat Bone Tea&#x27;, which is a popular dish among the overseas Chinese Teochew community in Singapore and Malaysia. Owing to its coastal geography, Chaozhou is also famed for its seafood soups, and a porridge called &quot;mue&quot; ().

==Tourism==
Chaozhou is a famous historical and cultural center of the Chaoshan region. The city, known as the &quot;Classic Tourist City&quot;, constantly welcomes thousands of tourists a day. There are over 600 valuable historic relics kept in Chaozhou city. Among them, 42 are classified under the state, provincial and city&#x27;s key preservation units of cultural relics. The Chaozhou Dialect, Chaozhou Opera, Chaozhou Ganghu tea, etc. are unique features of Chaozhou culture. Several historically significant attractions are below.
* Guangji Bridge, built in the Southern Song dynasty (1170 A.D.).
* Kaiyuan Temple, a Buddhist center embodied with the quintessence of the architectural art of various dynasties such as the Tang, the Song, the Yuan and the Qing. This temple is over 200 years old. The temple is also home to the largest Buddhist Institute in Southeast China. Inside, handsome calligraphy and inscribed steles remind visitors that this temple once functioned as the record keeper of the city.
* , which retains the basic pattern of the architecture of the Song dynasty.
* Jiadi Alley (), the ancient family houses.
* Beige Fodeng, The Lighthouse of Buddha (). The lighthouse was used for boats on the Han River, as this part of the river is dangerous. It is said that a former emperor once passed the area in his &quot;dragon boat&quot; while he was sleeping and was woken up by the light from the lighthouse. He thought that the light was sent by a bodhisattva and therefore named it the &quot;Lighthouse of Buddha&quot;.
* Huang Jilue Temple (), displaying the wood carving art of Chaozhou in the Qing dynasty.
* The old site of the Song Kiln, that shows the scale of production and the exquisite craftsmanship of ceramic in ancient Chaozhou.

==Chaozhou communities==

* The township of Chaozhou in western Pingtung County, Taiwan is named after Chaozhou.
* The Chaozhou people form the second largest group amongst the ethnic Chinese in Singapore, after the Hokkien, comprising 21% of Chinese Singaporeans. Teochew was originally the dominant language amongst the Chinese immigrants in Singapore, until it was superseded by the Hokkiens due to later immigration flows. Concentrations of Chaozhou people once settled along the banks of the Singapore River as well as the Straits of Johor, until urban development and the redistribution of the people in public housing development diluted this geographic trend, although they are still known to concentrate in the northeast such as in Hougang. Traditional commercial sectors of Chinatown once dominated by Teochews include Circular Road and South Bridge Road. Chaozhou peoples also founded rural settlements and were active in the plantation industry, and gave rise to modern place names such as Choa Chu Kang, Lim Chu Kang and Yio Chu Kang. Today, the Chaozhou people continue to be represented by various clans, one of the most prominent being the Ngee Ann Kongsi, which built schools such as the Ngee Ann Secondary School and Ngee Ann Polytechnic, maintains the oldest Teochew temple in Singapore, Yueh Hai Ching Temple, and also went into real-estate (Ngee Ann City). Much effort has been made to preserve their distinct identity and culture under the dominant influence of the Hokkien community, including through the airing of a popular television drama, &quot;The Teochew Family&quot; in 1995 by MediaCorp&#x27;s Channel 8.
* There is a large number of Teochew people in Penang, Malaysia. In the early 19th century, some Teochew people settled here, and in 1855 they founded the Teochew Association, which also includes a temple in Chulia Street, George Town. The community continued to grow; in 1919 a school named after the Han River, Han Chiang School, was founded to provide education for the people. Today, during larger occasions, the Teochew community still holds Teochew operas here. Han Chiang School went on to become one of the most famous education institutions in Penang. It comprises three schools: SJK(C) Han Chiang, Han Chiang High School and Han Chiang College.
* There is a large population of Chaozhou people in Hong Kong. When mainland China opened its borders to Hong Kong in the 1950s, there was an exodus of refugees into Hong Kong fleeing communist rule. Refugees from Chaozhou banded together in very tight communities and were known to be very generous towards helping refugees from their own regions. They spoke their own Teochew dialect amongst themselves, which made them stand out among locals, given the dominant dialect was Cantonese in Hong Kong. Locals called them by the name &quot;Chiu Chow Loun&quot;, Chiu Chow being the Cantonese pronunciation of Chaozhou. Teo Chew Nang is the Teochew pronunciation of the word &quot;Teochew people&quot;. Teochews were known to be very hardworking people, and good at running small businesses. Back in the 1960s, most &quot;rice stores&quot; (grocery stores for dried food and uncooked rice) in Hong Kong were owned by Chiu Chow Loun. Decades and generations later, the children of these immigrants have blended into Hong Kong society. Large corporation-run supermarkets drove many independent Chiu Chow &quot;rice stores&quot; out of business. ] Chiu Chow Loun no longer stands out as a distinct community in Hong Kong, though they are still very active in organizing charity activities, especially around the &quot;Zhong Yuan festival&quot; in the seventh month of the Chinese calendar.
* 70% of the population of Kowloon Walled City (formerly located in Hong Kong) was Chiu Chow.
* There is a large population of Chaozhou people in Pontianak and Ketapang, Indonesia, as they are the dominant Chinese group in these areas. Teochew is the main lingua franca used among the Chinese here.
* There is a large population of Chaozhou people in Thailand. Thailand has had a long history of business and trade with Teochew merchants. Many of the major business families in Thailand can trace their roots to Chaozhou. There are also many instances in the Thai language where Teochew words have been adopted as part of daily use.
* There is a large population of Chaozhou people in Cambodia, where they have been residents for generations. Most of the trade in Cambodia, even in small towns, is dominated by Teochews. Most of the business and professional classes in Cambodia can trace their ancestry to Chaozhou. The Teochew community associations are engaged in managing their own schools, pagodas and charities. The Chinese lunar new year is a national holiday.
* There is also a large population of Teochew nang (; Teochew people) settled in Vietnam, especially in Saigon&#x27;s districts 5 and 6. Outside of Saigon, Teochews settled in all six counties of the Mekong Delta. The majority of Teochew nang live in places such as Bac Lieu, Ca Mau, Rach Gia. It was once said in Vietnamese &quot;Dưới sông cá chốt trên bờ Triều Châu&quot; meaning that the Teochew nang were as abundant as that of fishes in the river of Bac Lieu &amp; Ca Mau areas. After the fall of Saigon in 1975, the victorious communist Vietnamese confiscated many assets of the wealthy, including those of the Teochew nang. They were then forced by the Communist government to resettle in what was called &quot;kinh tế mới&quot;, or new economic zone, which was uninhabited farmland. Since 1975, many hundreds of thousands of Teochew nang have left Vietnam as &quot;boat people&quot; or refugees. Most resettled in the US, Australia and various countries in the European Union.

<text>The Hakka (), sometimes also referred to as Hakka-speaking Chinese, or Hakka Chinese, or Hakkas, are a southern Han Chinese subgroup whose principal settlements and ancestral homes are dispersed widely across the provinces of southern China and who speak a language that is closely related to Gan, a Han Chinese dialect spoken in Jiangxi province. They are differentiated from other southern Han Chinese by their dispersed nature and tendency to occupy marginal lands and remote hilly areas. The Chinese characters for &quot;Hakka&quot; () literally mean &quot;guest families&quot;.

The Hakka have settled in Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Sichuan, Hunan, Zhejiang, Hainan, and Guizhou in China, as well as in Taoyuan City, Hsinchu County, Miaoli County, Pingtung County, and Kaohsiung City in Taiwan. Their presence is especially prominent in the Lingnan or Liangguang area, comprising the Cantonese-speaking provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi. Despite being partly assimilated to the Cantonese-speaking population, they retain a significant presence there.

Like the other southern Han Chinese subgroups, Hakka mainly comprise Central Plains Chinese refugees fleeing social unrest, upheaval, and invasions. However, the Hakka were different in being late arrivals, moving from Central China into Southern China when the earlier groups of Han Chinese settlers in the south had already developed distinctive local identities and languages. Their migration path was also different, and they entered Guangdong, Guangxi and Fujian via Jiangxi province, instead of traversing Hunan or moving along the Fujian coast.

Today, substantial numbers of Hakka Chinese have migrated overseas to various countries throughout the world.

==Origin and identity==
===Migrations===
The Hakka arrived in southern China much later than other southern Han Chinese populations. These earlier waves of southern Han Chinese immigrants occupied the coastal areas and fertile lowlands and had already formed distinctive cultural identities and dialects. Consequently, the Hakka were forced to locate their settlements on marginal territories and relatively infertile land.

The Hakka arrived in the Lingnan region by traversing Jiangxi and Fujian. During their journey through Jiangxi they intermarried with the Yao and She, two non-Han ethnic minorities. In Fujian, they developed the habit of living in communal fortresses. Intermarriage with aboriginal groups and the adoption of habits that diverged from the Han, such as communal fortress living, increased the Cantonese distaste for the Hakka and aroused suspicion.

During the 16th century, in response to an economic boom, the Hakkas moved into hilly areas to mine for zinc and lead and also moved into the coastal plains to cultivate cash crops. After an economic downturn, many of these ventures failed, and many Hakka had to turn to pillaging to survive.

=== Genetic findings ===
Studies show extensive gene flows and a very close relationship between the Hakka and the surrounding Han Chinese populations in the south. According to a 2009 study published in the &quot;American Journal of Human Genetics&quot;, Hakka are principally of Han Chinese descent, exhibiting an average genetic difference of 0.32% with other tested Han Chinese persons. Nonetheless, compared with other southern Han Chinese groups, the Hakka genetic profile exhibits a slight skew towards northern Han people. This is in line with their migratory history as later arrivals to the south than the other Han Chinese groups.

===Cultural identity===
The Hakka identify as Han Chinese and genetic studies show they are principally of Han ancestry, despite a recorded history of intermarriage with minority groups such as the Yao and the She. Furthermore, the Hakka language belongs to the Sinitic group of languages, being linguistically proximate to the Gan dialect of Jiangxi. The Hakka also exhibit traditional Confucian values, such as a respect for family, ancestor veneration, and a commitment to both learning and the ideals of a Confucian gentleman. Finally, they carry Han Chinese surnames and use Han Chinese naming conventions. Lingnan Hakka place names indicate a long history of the Hakka being culturally Han Chinese. Like the Cantonese, they fiercely insisted on their Han identities and were principal movers of the Anti-Qing movement.

However, the Hakka differed in their lifestyles and their preferred mode of habitation - living in large communal fortress-like buildings (known as &quot;tulou)&quot; instead of residing in courtyard houses (or &quot;siheyuan&quot;). They also settled in marginal or hardscrabble hill land avoided by other Han Chinese subgroups, and in this regard, were considered similar to non-Han aborigines. They also exhibited gender egalitarianism to a greater degree than other southern Chinese.Unlike other Han Chinese groups, the Hakkas are not named after a geographical region, e.g. a province, county or city. The Hakka people have a distinct identity from the Cantonese people. As 60% of the Hakkas in China reside in Guangdong province, and 95% of overseas Hakkas ancestral homes are in Guangdong. Hakkas from Chaoshan, Guangzhou, and Fujian may self-identify as only Chaoshanese, Cantonese and Hokkiens.

===Distant origins===
It is commonly held that the Hakkas are a subgroup of the Han Chinese that originated in the central plains. To trace their origins, a number of theories so far have been brought forth among anthropologists, linguists and historians:

#the Hakkas are Han Chinese originating solely from the Central Plain;
#the Hakkas are northern Han Chinese from the Central Plain with some inflow of Han Chinese from the south;
#the Hakkas are southern Han Chinese with some inflow of northern Han Chinese from the Central Plain.

The theories indicating a descent from both northern and southern Han are the most likely and are together supported by multiple scientific studies into the genetics. Furthermore, research into the mitochondrial DNA of the Hakka indicates that the majority of their matrilineal gene pool consists of lineages prevalent in the southern Han. Clyde Kiang stated that the Hakkas&#x27; origins may also be linked with Han&#x27;s ancient neighbors, the Dongyi and Xiongnu people. However, this is disputed by many scholars and Kiang&#x27;s theories are considered to be false.

Hakka Chinese scientist and researcher Dr. Siu-Leung Lee stated in the book by Chung Yoon-Ngan, &quot;The Hakka Chinese: Their Origin, Folk Songs And Nursery Rhymes&quot;, that the potential Hakka origins from the Northern Han and Xiongnu and that of the indigenous Southern She and Yue tribes, &quot;are all correct, yet none alone explain the origin of the Hakka&quot;, pointing out that the problem with DNA profiling on limited numbers of people within population pools cannot correctly ascertain who is really the Southern Chinese, because many Southern Chinese are also from Northern Asia; Hakka or non-Hakka. It is known that the earliest major waves of Hakka migration began due to the attacks of the two aforementioned tribes during the Jin dynasty (266–420).

=== Definitional problems and disambiguation ===
The study of this population group is complicated by linguistic uncertainty and nomenclatural ambiguity in the historical record. The term &quot;Hakka&quot; () is sometimes broadly used to refer to other southern Han Chinese groups during their southward migration. Imperial census statistics did not distinguish what varieties of Chinese the population spoke. Some family genealogies also employ the term Hakka () to refer to their southward migration, even though they belonged to the earlier groups of Han Chinese settlers and did not speak a Gan-affiliated language. These clans would be properly regarded as belonging to local dialect groups due to the timing of their arrival, the language they spoke, the customs they practiced, and the route of their traversal. These families were not part of the groups of settlers today associated with the Hakka, who arrived in southern China at a much later date through Jiangxi province and who spoke a Gan-affiliated language.

For example, the study by Lo Hsiang-lin, &quot;K&#x27;o-chia Yen-chiu Tao-Liu / An Introduction to the Study of the Hakkas&quot; (Hsin-Ning &amp; Singapore, 1933) used genealogical sources of family clans from various southern counties, leading to the inclusion of native southern Han Chinese families into the Hakka category.

== Language ==


Hakka Chinese is the native Chinese variety of the Hakka people. Hakka Chinese is the closest Chinese variety to Gan Chinese in terms of phonetics, with scholars studies consider the late Old Gan together with Hakka Chinese and the Tongtai dialect of Jianghuai Mandarin to have been the lingua franca of the Southern dynasties. Northern Hakka varieties have partial mutual intelligibility with southern Gan. Accordingly, Hakka is sometimes classified as a variety of Gan. Some studies posit that Hakka people and Gan people have close genetic relations and shared areal features.

In Taiwan, the Ministry of Education named &quot;Taiwanese Hakka Chinese&quot; as one of the languages of Taiwan.

==Culture==
Hakka culture has been largely shaped by the new environment, which they had to alter many aspects of their culture to adapt, which helped influence their architecture and cuisine. When the Hakka expanded into areas with pre-existing populations in the South, there was often little agricultural land left for them to farm. As a result, many Hakka men turned towards careers in the military or in public service.

=== Architecture ===

Hakka people built several types of tulou and peasant fortified villages in the mountainous rural parts of far western Fujian and adjacent southern Jiangxi and northern Guangdong regions. A representative sample of Fujian tulou (consisting of 10 buildings or building groups) in Fujian was inscribed in 2008 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Another very popular architectural style in northern east Guangdong, such as Xingning and Meixian, is Wrapped Dragon Village ().

=== Cuisine ===
Hakka cuisine is known for the use of preserved meats and tofu, as well as stewed and braised dishes. Some of the popular dishes are &quot;Yong Tau Foo&quot; and &quot;Lei Cha&quot;. These dishes are popular in Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Singapore. The taste profile is generally light, tending even towards blandness, with a preference for allowing the taste of the ingredients, especially the herbs, to emerge through any seasoning.

&quot;Lei cha&quot; is a traditional Southern Chinese tea-based beverage or rice gruel that forms a part of Hakka cuisine. Ingredients include green tea, basil, sawtooth coriander, mug wort, and a kind of herb known as &quot;Fu Yip Sum&quot;. Generally regarded as laborious and difficult to make. Usually eaten with side dishes.

&quot;Yong tau foo&quot; is a Hakka Chinese food consisting primarily of tofu that has been filled with either a ground meat mixture or fish paste. It can be eaten dry with sauce or served in a soup base.

&quot;Suanpanzi&quot; is another popular Hakka dish which literally means &quot;abacus seeds&quot;. It consists of mainly yam or tapioca beaten in to the shape of abacus beads. The dish is served with minced pork or chicken and with light seasoning.

=== Music ===

==== Hill song ====
Hakka hill songs are traditionally used by hillside farmers in parts of Taiwan and China, mainly for entertainment in the farming fields and courting practices. They are characterized by the strong, resonating melody and voice, which echo around hills and can be heard for up to a mile around the area. Hill songs can be considered a form of communication, as its participants often use it to communicate love songs or news.

==== Hakkapop ====

Hakkapop is a genre of Hakka pop music made primarily in China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia.

=== Views on gender ===
Historically, Hakka women did not bind their feet when the practice was commonplace in other parts of China. Hakka women are known for their independent nature and willingness to engage in hard work typically reserved for men in other dialect groups.

This may have been driven by historical necessity rather than cultural differences, since the Hakka employed marginal hill lands which were less fertile than the river valley occupied by other Han subgroups, such as the Cantonese, the Teochew and the Hoklo people.

=== Media ===
In 1950, China Central People&#x27;s Broadcasting Station recruited the first Hakka broadcaster, Zhang Guohua, based on a radius of two kilometers from the Meixian government. On April 10, 1950, the Voice of Hakka (客家之聲) started broadcasting. It broadcast nine hours of Hakka Chinese programs every day through shortwave radio and online radio, targeting countries and regions where Hakka people gather, such as Japan, Indonesia, Mauritius, Reunion Island, Australia, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

In 1988, Meizhou Television Station (梅州電視臺) was founded. In 1994, Hakka Public Channel, also known as Meizhou TV-2 had started broadcasting. Hakka Chinese began to appear in television programs. In 2021, it was renamed Hakka Life Channel (客家生活頻道).

In 1991, Meizhou People&#x27;s Broadcasting Station (梅州人民廣播電臺), also known as Meizhou Wired Broadcasting Station (梅州有線廣播電臺) officially started broadcasting. Meizhou Radio News: FM94.8 or urban FM101.9. Meizhou Radio Traffic Channel: FM105.8 MHz. Meizhou Radio Private Car Channel: FM94.0 or urban FM103.9. Until now, Hakka Chinese is still used for news program, radio drama program, emotional program, entertainment program and cultural program.

In 1999, 3CW Chinese Radio Australia (3CW澳大利亞中文廣播電臺) was launched. It used Mandarin, Cantonese and Hakka.

In 2001, Meizhou Television Station merged with Meizhou People&#x27;s Broadcasting Station and was renamed Meizhou Radio and Television Station (MRT, 梅州廣播電視臺). In 2004, the station had officially completed its establishment.

In 2003, Taiwan Broadcasting System (TBS, 臺灣公共廣播電視集團) established a Hakka satellite cable channel &quot;Hakka TV&quot;. In Taiwan, there are seven Hakka Chinese radio channels.

In 2005, Meixian Radio and Television Station (梅縣廣播電視臺) was reorganized after the separation of the National Cultural System Reform Bureau. It is a public institution under the jurisdiction of the Meixian County Party Committee and County Government. The channel can be watched in Meizhou and surrounding area with an audience of over 4 million people.

In 2012, Voice of Hong Kong (香港之聲) started broadcasting. Hakka Chinese is used on Sihai Kejia Channel.

In 2019, Shenzhou Easy Radio (神州之聲) added a Hakka Chinese radio break which broadcasts to the southeast coast of mainland China, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, the South Pacific and Japan. On Radio The Greater Bay (大灣區之聲), Sihai Kejia Channel has also joined.

In 2023, The &quot;Xuexi Qiangguo&quot; (學習強國) Platform under the supervision of the Publicity Department of the Chinese Communist Party added automatic broadcasting in Hakka Chinese.

== Religion ==
The religious practices of Hakka people are largely similar to those of other Han Chinese. Ancestor veneration is the primary form of religious expression. One distinctively Hakka religious practice involves the worship of dragon deities.

==Discrimination==
===Imperial era - Qing dynasty===
People of Hakka ancestry comprised the notable mainstay of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, although other dialect groups also enlisted. The leader of the Xiang Army, Zeng Guofan, had a special contempt for Hakka women, referring to them as &quot;hillbilly witches&quot;.

In retaliation for killing three Hunanese officers, the Xiang Army exterminated the entire Hakka population of Wukeng and Chixi during military counter-attacks on the Hakkas in the year 1888. The army also massacred tens of thousands of other Hakkas in Guanghai, a region of Taishan, Guangdong. Many of the killings in Guanghai took place in the Dalongdong area.

The Taiping rebellion caused millions of casualties on both sides. In retaliation, after defeating the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Xiang Army targeted Hakka villages and is estimated to have killed ~30,000 Hakkas every day during the height of the retaliation.

===Discrimination against Hakka by the Cantonese ===
Cantonese people have had a history of friction with Hakka, despite the both of them being Han subgroups speaking varieties of Chinese that exhibit relatively high mutual intelligibility (both dialects tracing straightforward descent from Middle Chinese). The Cantonese regarded the Hakka as displaying non-Han habits and as opportunists intruding on Cantonese territory. The conflict between the two groups led to one of the largest inter-ethnic genocides in history.

====Mass killings of Hakkas in China====
The Red Turban rebels, who were mostly of Cantonese ancestry, carried out a genocidal campaign against the Hakkas during a revolt (1854–1856) against the Qing dynasty. The Cantonese Red Turbans killed 13 Hakka village chiefs and 7,630 other Hakkas while on their way to Heshan, and after conquering it, they killed another 1,320 Hakkas.

The bloody Punti–Hakka Clan Wars, saw reciprocal massacres by both groups, but the Hakka bore the brunt of the casualties. This war eventually killed some 500,000 Hakkas (or quite possibly even more). During these killings, the Cantonese generally collaborated with the Xiang people, since both dialect groups had an axe to grind against the Hakka.

In retaliation for a Hakka massacre of Cantonese people, Cantonese peasants butchered 500 Hakkas in a village located in the rural Enping county forcing the surviving Hakkas to flee, but these refugees, who numbered some 4,000 Hakka, were later all caught and killed by Cantonese peasants, who spared neither women nor child. Government officials mobilized officers and men from the local Cantonese peasants to regain the Guanghai area which was occupied by the Hakkas. The number of Hakkas killed was tens of thousands in the Dalongdong area of Guanghai alone.

====Discrimination and hatred of Hakka outside Guangdong====
The Cantonese murdered more than 70 Hakka fellow provincials in Shanghai under the justification of a Hakka conspiracy that the Jiaying group was surrendering the city to foreign control. On 27 August 1925, villages in a county belonged to the Hakka minority were attacked, Chiang&#x27;s Punti (Cantonese) men and soldiers did not hesitate to rape their women and pillage their homes.

Inter-ethnic hatred between the two groups also rose to a boil in Malaysia. Memories of conflict and old grudges sparked another round of conflict between the Hakkas and Cantonese in Perak, Malaya, leading to the Larut Wars.

Upon arriving in Madagascar, the Cantonese colluded to prevent any Hakka migration to Madagascar.

==== By Guangxi people ====
More than 100,000 Hakkas were slaughtered by the locals in Guangxi province during another clan war. In October 1850, the Cantonese and Hakkas were hacking and killing each other for over 40 days in Guigang.

===Attacks against Hakka by the Lingao people===
Between 1925 and 1926, thousands were killed and wounded when the ethnic hatred of the Hakkas by the natives of Lingao turned violent in northwestern Hainan.

==Hakka in mainland China==

Hakka populations are found in 13 out of the 27 provinces and autonomous regions of mainland China.

===Guangdong===

Hakkas who live in Guangdong comprise about 60% of the total Hakka population. Worldwide, over 95% of the overseas-descended Hakkas came from this Guangdong region, usually from Meizhou and Heyuan as well as other towns such as Shenzhen, Jieyang, Dongguan and Huizhou. Hakkas live mostly in the northeast part of the province, particularly in the so-called Xing-Mei (Xingning–Meixian) area. Unlike their kin in Fujian, Hakka in the Xingning and Meixian area developed a non-fortress-like unique architectural style, most notably the weilongwu ( or Hakka: Wui Lung Wuk) and sijiaolou ( or Hakka: Si Kok Liu).

===Fujian===

Tradition states that the early Hakka ancestors traveling from north China entered Fujian first, then by way of the Ting River they traveled to Guangdong and other parts of China, as well as overseas. Thus, the Ting River is also regarded as the Hakka Mother River.

The Hakkas who settled in the mountainous region of south-western Fujian province developed a unique form of architecture known as the &quot;tulou&quot; (), literally meaning &quot;earthen structures&quot;. The &quot;tulou&quot; are round or square and were designed as a combined large fortress and multi-apartment building complex. The structures typically had only one entrance-way, with no windows at ground level. Each floor served a different function: the first floor contained a well and livestock, the second food storage and the third and higher floors living spaces. &quot;Tulou&quot; were built to withstand attack from bandits and marauders.

Today, Western Fujian is inhabited by 3 million Hakkas, scattered around villages in 10 counties (county-level &#x27;cities&#x27; and districts) in Longyan and Sanming prefectures, 98% of whom are Hakkas living in Changting, Liancheng, Shanghang, Wuping, Yongding, Ninghua, Qingliu and Mingxi counties.

===Jiangxi===
Jiangxi contains the second largest Hakka community. Nearly all of southern Jiangxi province is Hakka, especially in Ganzhou. In the Song dynasty, a large number of Han Chinese migrated to the delta area as the Court moved southward because invasion of northern minority. They lived in Jiangxi and intermixed with the She and Yao minorities. Ganzhou was the place that the Hakka have settled before migrating to Western Fujian and Eastern Guangdong. During the early Qing dynasty, there was a massive depopulation in Gannan due to the ravage of pestilence and war. However, Western Fujian and Eastern Guangdong suffered population explosion at the same time. Some edicts were issued to block the coastal areas, ordering coastal residents to move to the inland. The population pressure and the sharp contradiction of the land redistribution drove some residents to leave. Some of them moved back to Gannan, integrating with other Hakka people who lived there already for generations. Thus, the modern Gannan Hakka community was finally formed.

===Sichuan===
The Kangxi Emperor () after a tour of the land, decided the province of Sichuan had to be repopulated after the devastation caused by Zhang Xianzhong. Seeing the Hakka were living in poverty in the coastal regions in Guangdong province, the emperor encouraged the Hakkas in the south to migrate to Sichuan province. He offered financial assistance to those willing to resettle in Sichuan: eight ounces of silver per man and four ounces per woman or child.

Sichuan was originally the origin of the Deng lineage until one of them was hired as an official in Guangdong during the Ming dynasty but during the Qing plan to increase the population in 1671 they came to Sichuan again. Deng Xiaoping was born in Sichuan.

===Hunan===
Hakka people are mainly concentrated in Liuyang and Liling villages.

===Henan===
As with those in Sichuan, many Hakka emigrated to Xinyang Prefecture (in Southern Henan Province), where Li Zicheng carried out a massacre in Guangzhou (now in Huangchuan) on 17 January 1636.

== Hakka in Hong Kong ==
During the 15th century to 19th century, Hong Kong was in the imperial district of Xin&#x27;an (now Shenzhen) County. The 1819 gazetteer lists 570 Punti and 270 Hakka contemporary settlements in the whole district. However, the area covered by Xin&#x27;an county is greater than what was to become the British imperial enclave of Hong Kong by 1898. Although there had been settlers originating from the mainland proper even before the Tang dynasty, historical records of those people are non-extant, only evidence of settlement from archaeological sources can be found. The New Territories lowland areas had been settled originally by several clan lineages in Kam Tin, Sheung Shui, Fanling, Yuen Long, Lin Ma Hang and Tai Po and hence termed the Punti before the arrival of the Hakka, and fishing families of the Tanka and Hoklo groups to the area. Since the prime farming land had already been farmed, the Hakka land dwellers settled in the less accessible and more hilly areas. Hakka settlements can be found widely distributed around the Punti areas, but in smaller communities. Many are found on coastal areas in inlets and bays surrounded by hills.

Hakka-speaking communities are thought to have arrived in the Hong Kong area after the rescinding of the coastal evacuation order in 1688, such as the Hakka speaking Lee clan lineage of Wo Hang, one of whose ancestors is recorded as arriving in the area in 1688.

As the strong Punti lineages dominated most of the north western New Territories, Hakka communities began to organise local alliances of lineage communities such as the Sha Tau Kok &quot;Alliance of Ten&quot; or &quot;Shap Yeuk&quot; as Patrick Hase writes. Hakka villages from Wo Hang to the west and Yantian to the east of Sha Tau Kok came to use it as a local market town and it became the center of Hakka dominance. Further, the Shap Yeuk&#x27;s land reclamation project transforming marshland to arable farmland with the creation of dykes and levees to prevent storm flooding during the early 19th century shows an example of how local cooperation and the growing affluence of the landed lineages in the Alliance of Ten provided the strong cultural, socioeconomic Hakka influence on the area.

Farming and cultivation have been the traditional occupations of Hakka families from imperial times up until the 1970s. Farming was mostly done by Hakka women while their menfolk sought labouring jobs in the towns and cities. Many men entered indentured labour abroad as was common from the end of the 19th century to the Second World War. Post war, males took the opportunity to seek work in Britain and other countries later to send for their families to join them once they sent enough money back to cover travel costs.

As post war education became available to all children in Hong Kong, a new educated class of Hakka became more mobile in their careers. Many moved to the government planned new towns which sprung up from the 1960s. The rural Hakka population began to decline as people moved abroad, and away to work in the urban areas. By the end of the 1970s, agriculture was firmly in the decline in Hakka villages. Today, there are still Hakka villages around Hong Kong, but being remote, many of their inhabitants have moved to the post war new towns like Sheung Shui, Tai Po, Sha Tin and further afield.

== Hakka in Taiwan ==
The Hakka population in Taiwan is around 4.6 million people today. Hakka comprise about 15 to 20% of Taiwanese people and form the second-largest ethnic group in the country. They are descended largely from Hakka who migrated from southern and northern Guangdong and western Fujian. The early Hakka immigrants were the island&#x27;s first agriculturalists and formed the nucleus of the Chinese population, numbering tens of thousands at the time. They resided in &quot;savage border districts, where land could be had for the taking, and where a certain freedom from official oppression was ensured.&quot; Back then the Hakka on Taiwan had gained a reputation with the authorities of being turbulent and lawless.

In the past the Hakka in Taiwan owned matchlock muskets. Han people traded and sold matchlock muskets to the Taiwanese aborigines. The Aboriginals used their matchlock muskets to defeat the Americans in the Formosa Expedition. During the Sino-French War the Hakka and Aboriginals used their matchlock muskets against the French in the Keelung Campaign and Battle of Tamsui.

Liu Mingchuan took measures to reinforce Tamsui, in the river nine torpedo mines were planted and the entrance was blocked with ballast boats filled with stone which were sunk on 3 September, matchlock armed &quot;Hakka hill people&quot; were used to reinforce the mainland Chinese battalion, and around the British Consulate and Customs House at the Red Fort hilltop, Shanghai Arsenal manufactured Krupp guns were used to form an additional battery.
Lin Ch&#x27;ao-tung () was the leader of the Hakka militia recruited by Liu Ming-ch&#x27;uan.

The Hakka used their matchlock muskets to resist the Japanese invasion of Taiwan and Hakka Han people and Aboriginals conducted an insurgency against Japanese rule. The Hakka rose up against the Japanese in the Beipu uprising.

Taiwan&#x27;s Hakka population concentrates in Hsinchu and Hsinchu County, Miaoli County and around Zhongli District in Taoyuan City and Meinong District in Kaohsiung and in Pingtung County, with smaller presences in Hualien County and Taitung County. In recent decades, many Hakka have moved to the largest metropolitan areas, including Taipei and Taichung.

On 28 December 1988, 14,000 Hakka protestors took to the streets in Taipei to demand the Nationalist government to &quot;return our mother tongue&quot;, carrying portraits of Sun Yat-sen. The movement was later termed &quot;1228 Return Our Mother Tongue Movement&quot;.

Hakka-related affairs in Taiwan are regulated by the Hakka Affairs Council. Hakka-related tourist attractions in Taiwan are Dongshih Hakka Cultural Park, Hakka Round House, Kaohsiung Hakka Cultural Museum, Meinong Hakka Culture Museum, New Taipei City Hakka Museum, Taipei Hakka Culture Hall and Taoyuan Hakka Culture Hall.

==Hakka diaspora==

===Southeast Asia===
====Vietnam====
There are two groups of Hakka in Vietnam. One is known as Ngái people and lives along the border with China in Northern Vietnam. Another group are Chinese immigrants to Southern Vietnam, known as Người Hẹ and is located around Ho Chi Minh City and Vũng Tàu.

====Cambodia====
About 65% of the Hakka trace their roots back to Meizhou and Heyuan prefectures in Guangdong Province. About 70% of the Hakkas are found in Phnom Penh where they dominate professions in the field of Traditional Chinese Medicine and shoemaking. Hakkas are also found in Takéo Province, Stung Treng and Rattanakiri who consist of vegetable growers and rubber plantation workers. Hakka communities in the provinces migrated to Cambodia through Tonkin and Cochinchina in the 18th and 19th centuries.

====Thailand====

There are no records as to when Hakka descendants arrived in Thailand. In 1901, Yu Cipeng, a Hakka member of The League Society of China came to visit Thailand and found that the establishment of many varied organizations among the Hakka was not good for unity. He tried to bring the two parties together and persuaded them to dissolve the associations in order to set up a new united one. In 1909 The Hakka Society of Siam was established and Chao Phraya Yommarat (Pan Sukhum), then interior minister, was invited to preside over the opening ceremony for the establishment of the society&#x27;s nameplate, located in front of the Chinese shrine &quot;Lee Tee Biao&quot;. Yang Liqing was its first president.

====Singapore====
In 2010, 232,914 people in Singapore reported Hakka ancestry. Singapore&#x27;s most prominent Hakka is its founding prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew.

====Malaysia====

Hakka people form the second largest subgroup of the ethnic Chinese population of Malaysia, particularly in the peninsula, with several prominent Hakka figures emerging during colonial British rule. There are 1,729,000 people of Hakka ancestry in Malaysia as of 2016. Chung Keng Quee, &quot;Captain China&quot; of Perak and Penang, was the founder of the mining town of Taiping, the leader of the Hai San, a millionaire philanthropist and an innovator in the mining of tin, having been respected by both Chinese and European communities in the early colonial settlement. Another notable Hakka was Yap Ah Loy, who founded Kuala Lumpur and was a Kapitan Cina of the settlement from 1868 to 1885, bringing significant economic contributions and was also an influential figure among the ethnic Chinese.

In the district of Jelebu, Negeri Sembilan, Hakka people make up more than 90% of the Chinese subgroup with dialect itself acting as a lingua franca there. This has contributed greatly to the fact that the place is commonly known among Hakka Chinese as &quot;Hakka Village&quot;. The greatest concentration of Hakkas in northern peninsular Malaysia is in Ipoh, Perak and in Kuala Lumpur and its satellite cities in Selangor. Concentrations of Hakka people in Ipoh and surrounding areas are particularly high. The Hakkas in the Kinta Valley came mainly from the Jiaying Prefecture or Meixian, while those in Kuala Lumpur are mainly of Huizhou origin.

A large number of Hakka people are also found in Sarawak, particularly in the city of Kuching and Miri, where there is a notable population of Hakka people who speak the &quot;Ho Poh&quot; variant of Hakka.

In Sabah, most of the ethnic Chinese are of Hakka descent. In the 1990s, the Hakkas formed around 57% of the total ethnic Chinese population in Sabah. Hakka is the lingua franca among the Chinese in Sabah to such an extent that Chinese of other subgroups who migrate to Sabah from other states in Malaysia and elsewhere usually learn the Hakka dialect, with varying degrees of fluency.

In 1882 the North Borneo Chartered Company opted to bring in Hakka labourers from Longchuan County, Guangdong. The first batch of 96 Hakkas brought to Sabah landed in Kudat on 4 April 1883 under the leadership of Luo Daifeng (Hakka: Lo Tai Fung). In the following decades Hakka immigrants settled throughout the state, with their main population centres in Kota Kinabalu (then known as Jesselton) and its surroundings (in the districts of Tuaran, Penampang, Ranau, Papar, Kota Belud as well as a lesser extent to Kota Marudu), with a significant minority residing in Sandakan (mainly ex-Taiping revolutionists) and other large populations in other towns and districts, most notably in Tawau, Tenom, Kuala Penyu, Tambunan, Lahad Datu, Semporna, Sipitang, Beaufort, Keningau and Kudat. The British felt the development of North Borneo was too slow and in 1920 they decided to encourage Hakka immigration into Sabah. In 1901, the total Chinese population in Sabah was 13897; by 1911, it had risen 100% to 27801. Hakka immigration began to taper off during World War 2 and declined to a negligible level in the late 1940s.

====Indonesia====

Migration of Hakka people to Indonesia happened in several waves. The first wave landed in Riau Islands such as in Bangka Island and Belitung as tin miners in the 18th century. The second group of colonies were established along the Kapuas River in Borneo in the 19th century, predecessor to early Singapore residents. In the early 20th century, new arrivals joined their compatriots as traders, merchants and labourers in major cities such as Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, Medan, etc.

Some research shows that the establishment of the Silk Road created commercial trade for the Hakka people in the south or along the way, and created conditions for overseas migration. The book &quot;An Overview of Hakka Migration History: Where are you from?&quot; published by My China Roots &amp; CBA Jamaica mentions that the Hakka people traded with the caravans and stayed overseas to facilitate business, and added descendants Immigrants, Indonesia, Calcutta, Toronto, and Jamaica all still retain a long history of Hakka culture and organization.

In Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, Hakka people are sometimes known as &quot;Khek&quot;, from the Hokkien pronunciation &quot;kheh&quot;. However, the use of the word &#x27;Khek&#x27; is limited mainly to areas where the local Chinese population is mainly of Hokkien origin. In places where other Chinese subgroups predominate, the term &#x27;Hakka&#x27; is still the more commonly used.

=====Bangka (in Indonesia)=====

Hakka also live in Indonesia&#x27;s largest tin producer islands of Bangka Belitung Islands province. They are the second majority ethnic group after Malays. The Hakka population in the province is also the second largest in Indonesia after West Kalimantan&#x27;s and one of the highest percentages of Chinese living in Indonesia.

The first group of Hakka in Bangka and Belitung reached the islands in the 18th century from Guangdong. Many of them worked as tin mining labourers. Since then, they have remained on the island along with the native Malay. Their situation was much different from those of Chinese and native populations of other regions, where legal cultural conflicts were prevalent since the 1960s until 1999, by which Indonesian Chinese had finally regained their cultural freedoms. Here they lived together peacefully and still practiced their customs and cultural festivals, while in other regions they were strictly banned by government legislation prior to 1999. Hakka on the island of Bangka spoke Hopo dialect mixed with Malay, especially in younger generations. Hakka spoken in Belinyu area in Bangka is considered to be standard.

=====West Kalimantan (in Indonesia)=====
Hakka people in Pontianak live alongside Teochew speaking Chinese. While the Teochews are dominant in the centre of Pontianak, the Hakka are more dominant in small towns along the Kapuas River in the regencies of Sanggau, Sekadau and Sintang. Their Hakka dialect is originally Hopo which influenced by Teochew dialect and also has vocabulary from the local Malay and Dayak tribes. The Hakka were instrumental in the Lanfang Republic.

The Hakka in this region are descendants of gold prospectors who migrated from China in the late 19th century.

The Hakka in Singkawang and the surrounding regencies of Sambas, Bengkayang, Ketapang and Landak speak a different standard of Hakka dialect to the Hakkas along the Kapuas River. Originally West Borneo has diverse Hakka origin but during the 19th century, a large people came from Jiexi so more Hakkas in the region speak Hopo mixed with Wuhua and Huilai accents that eventually formed the dialect of Singkawang Hakka.

=====Jakarta (in Indonesia)=====
Hakka people in Jakarta mainly have roots from Meizhou, who came in the 19th century. Secondary migration of the Hakkas from other provinces like Bangka Belitung Islands and West Borneo came later.

====Timor-Leste====
There was already a relatively large and vibrant Hakka community in East Timor before the 1975 Indonesian invasion. According to an estimate by the local Chinese Timorese association, the Hakka population of Portuguese Timor in 1975 was estimated to be around 25,000 (including a small minority of other Chinese ethnicities from Macau, which like East Timor was a Portuguese colony). According to a book source, an estimated 700 Hakka were killed within the first week of invasion in Dili alone. No clear numbers had been recorded since many Hakka had already escaped to neighbouring Australia. The recent re-establishment of Hakka associations in the country registered approximately 2,400 Hakka remaining, organised into some 400 families, including part-Timorese ones.

The Timorese Hakka diaspora can currently be found in Darwin, Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne in Australia; in Portugal; in Macau; and in other parts of the world in smaller numbers. They often are highly educated and many continue their education in either Taiwan or the People&#x27;s Republic of China, while a majority of the younger generation prefer to study in Australia. The Australian government took some years to assess their claims to be genuine refugees and not illegal immigrants, as partially related to the political situation in East Timor at the time. As Asian countries were neither willing to accept them as residents nor grant them political asylum to the Timorese in general, they were forced to live as stateless persons for some time. Despite this condition, many Hakka had become successful, establishing restaurant chains, shops, supermarkets and import operations in Australia. Since the independence of Timor-Leste in 2000, some Hakka families have returned and invested in businesses in the newborn nation.

===South Asia===
====India====
There used to be 1500 Hakkas largely at Tangra,Kolkata and Bombay, arriving after the great British Raj violence and chaos.

However, from the 1960s, after armed fighting broke out, there has been a steady migration to other countries, which accelerated in the succeeding decades. The majority moved to Britain and Canada, while others went to the United States, Australia, Taiwan, Austria and Sweden. The predominant dialect of Hakka in these communities is Meixian.

Hakkas are the largest Chinese community in India after Chinese Cantonese people of Indian ancestry. During the time he held office in Calcutta until the late 2000s, Yap Kon Chung, the Hakka ambassador, protected and helped the Chinese residents in India. Specifically, during the Sino-Indian war of 1962, oppression of Sino-Indian residents accused of Anti-Indian sentiment by the Indians was escalated. Yap then made appeals to Prime Minister Nehru to bridge a bond between the Indians and Chinese persons. During his office, he was also the principal at a highly regarded school as well as a political facilitator who helped many families migrate to other countries such as Britain, Canada, the United States and parts of Europe until he himself migrated to Toronto, Canada to join his family. Yap died surrounded by family on 18 April 2014, at the age of 97.

===Africa===
====South Africa====
Some Hakka people, notably from Taiwan, migrated to South Africa.

====Mauritius====
The vast majority of Mauritian Chinese are Hakkas. Most Mauritian Hakkas who emigrated to Mauritius in the mid-1940s came from Northeastern Guangdong, especially from the Meizhou or Meixian region.

As of 2008, the total population of Sino-Mauritian, consisting of Hakka and Cantonese, is around 35,000.

====Réunion====
Many Chinese people in Réunion are of Hakka origin. They either came to Réunion as indentured workers or as voluntary migrants.

===Americas===
====United States====
Hakka from all over the world have also migrated to the US. One group is the New England Hakka Association, which reminds its members not to forget their roots. One example is a blog by Ying Han Brach called &quot;Searching for My Hakka Roots&quot;. Another group is the Hakka Association of New York, which aims to promote Hakka culture across the five boroughs of New York City. In the mid-1970s, the Hakka Benevolent Association in San Francisco was founded by Tu Chung. The association has strong ties with the San Francisco community and offers scholarships to their young members. There are significant Hakka American communities in San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle and Los Angeles.

There are around 20,000 Taiwanese Hakkas in the United States.

====Canada====
There are several Hakka communities across Canada. One group that embraces on Hakka culture in this diverse country is the Hakka Heritage Alliance. Also see Jamaica.

====Jamaica====
Most Chinese Jamaicans are Hakka; they have a long history in Jamaica. Between 1854 and 1884, nearly 5,000 Hakkas arrived in Jamaica in three major voyages. The Hakkas seized the opportunity to venture into a new land, embracing the local language, customs and culture. During the 1960s and 1970s, substantial migration of Jamaican Hakkas to the US and Canada have occurred. The Hakkas in Jamaica came mainly from Dongguan, Huiyang and Bao&#x27;an counties of Guangdong Province.

====Suriname====
The Chinese in Suriname are homogeneous as a group and the great majority can trace their roots to Huidong&#x27;an (). One famous Hakka is President Henk Chin A Sen.

====Guyana====
Chinese people are a small minority at Guyana. Guyana&#x27;s most prominent Hakka Chinese is its first president, Arthur Chung.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
Hakka people first arrived in Australia in the 1880s. Hakka arrivals were halted along with other Chinese immigrants during the White Australia policy era from 1901 to 1973 and resumed thereafter. Some estimate that there are now 100,000 Hakka people in Australia.

====New Zealand====
There are people of Hakka descent in New Zealand.

====Tahiti====
Hakka people first arrived in Papara, Tahiti in 1865.

==Population==
At a 1994 seminar of the World Hakka Association held in Meixian, statistics showed that there were 6,562,429 Hakkas living abroad.

In 2000, the worldwide population of Hakka was estimated at 36,059,500 and in 2010 it was estimated at 40,745,200.

Another estimate is that approximately 36 million Hakka people are scattered throughout the world. More than 31 million lives in over 200 cities and counties spread throughout five provinces of China (Guangdong, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Fujian, Hunan) as well as Hong Kong.

==Hakkaology==

Hakkaology () is the academic study of the Hakka people and their culture. It encompasses their origins, identity, language, traits, architecture, customs, food, literature, history, politics, economics, diaspora and genealogical records.

The study of the Hakka people first drew attention to Chinese and foreign scholars, adventurers, missionaries, travellers and authors of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era. Ernest John Eitel, a prominent German missionary, was one of those who took a great interest in this area. Theodore Hamberg, who also wrote an early English-language account of the Taiping Rebellion, is also considered a forefather of Hakka studies in the West.

Many foreign scholars were full of admiration of the Hakka people. According to prominent sinologist Victor Purcell, the Hakkas &quot;have a stubbornness of disposition that distinguishes them from their fellow Chinese&quot;.

==Political and military leadership==

It has been suggested that Hakkas have had a significant influence, disproportionate to their smaller total numbers, on the course of modern Chinese and overseas Chinese history, particularly as a source of revolutionary, political, military leaders, as well as presidents, prime ministers.

Hakkas started and formed the backbone of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the largest uprising in the modern history of China. The uprising, also known as Jintian Uprising, originated at the Hakka village of Jintian in Guiping, Guangxi province. It was led by the failed Qing scholar, Hong Xiuquan, who was influenced by Protestant missionaries. Hong&#x27;s charisma tapped into a consciousness of national dissent which identified with his personal interpretations of the Christian message. His following, who were initially Hakka peasants from Guangxi, grew across the southern provinces.

The Taiping army, which included women in their ranks, captured towns and cities from the defenders, the Taiping troops killed all Manchu children because the Taiping troops with fatal rocks smashed Manchu children&#x27;s heads Four of the six top Taiping leaders are Hakkas: Hong Xiuquan, Feng Yunshan, Yang Xiuqing and Shi Dakai. Hong Rengan, the Premier of the Kingdom, was the first person in China to advocate a federal government and reform. The kingdom lasted from 1851 to 1864.

Hakkas continued to play leading roles during the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty and the republican years of China. When Sun Yat-sen was a child, he used to listen to an old Taiping soldier telling them stories about the heroics of the Taipings. This influenced Sun and he proclaimed that he shall be the second Hong Xiuquan. Sun was to become the Father of modern China and many of his contemporaries were his fellow Hakkas.

Zheng Shiliang, a medical student and classmate of Sun, led the Huizhou Uprising () in 1900. Huizhou is an area in Guangdong province where most of the population are Hakkas. Deng Zhiyu led the Huizhou Qinühu Uprising () in 1907. All of the Four Martyrs of Honghuagang () are Hakkas – one of which was Wen Shengcai who assassinated the Manchu general, Fu Qi, in 1911.

Brothers Hsieh Yi-qiao and Hsieh Liang-mu raised the 100,000 Chinese Yuan needed for the Huanghuagang Uprising from the overseas Chinese community in Nanyang (Southeast Asia) in 1911. At least 27 of the 85 (initially 72 because only 72 bodies could be identified) martyrs of Huanghuagang are Hakkas. Yao Yuping led the Guangdong Northern Expeditionary Force () to successive victories against the Qing Army which were vital in the successful defence of the Provisional Government in Nanjing and Puyi&#x27;s early abdication.

Liao Zhongkai and Deng Keng were Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s main advisors on financial and military matters respectively. A big majority of the soldiers in the Guangdong Army () were Hakkas. Other Hakkas for example, Eugene Chen, was an outstanding foreign minister in the 1920s. Some of the best of Nationalist China generals: Chen Mingshu, Chen Jitang, Xue Yue, Zhang Fakui, and Luo Zhuoying amongst many others are Hakka as well.

The Hakka occupied communist Bases reached a peak of more than 30,000 square kilometres and a population that numbered more than three million, covering mostly Hakka areas of two provinces: Jiangxi and Fujian. The Hakka city of Ruijin was the capital of the republic.

When it was overrun in 1934 by the Nationalist army in the Fifth of its Encirclement campaigns, the Communists began their famous Long March with 86,000 soldiers, of which more than 70% were Hakkas. The Fifth Encirclement Campaign was led by Nationalist Hakka general, Xue Yue. During the retreat, the Communists managed to strike a deal with the Hakka warlord controlling Guangdong province, Chen Jitang, to let them pass through Guangdong without a fight. When the People&#x27;s Liberation Army had its rank structure from 1955 to 1964, the highest number of generals, totalling 54, came from the small Hakka county of Xingguo in Jiangxi province. The county had also previously produced 27 Nationalist generals. Xingguo county is thus known as the Generals&#x27; County.

During the same period, there were 132 Hakkas out of 325 generals in Jiangxi, 63 Hakkas out of 83 generals in Fujian, and 8 Hakkas out of 12 generals in Guangdong respectively, not mentioning those from Guangxi, Sichuan and Hunan. The number could have been significantly higher if the majority of the personnel who started the Long March had not perished before reaching its destination. Only less than 7,000 of the original 86,000 personnel had survived it.

Prominent Hakka communist leaders include: Marshal Zhu De, the founder of the Red Army, later known as the People&#x27;s Liberation Army; Ye Ting, Commander-in-chief, New Fourth Army, one of the two main Chinese communist forces fighting the Japanese during the World War II (the other main communist force, Eighth Route Army, was commanded by Zhu De); Marshal Ye Jianying, governor of Guangdong; and Hu Yaobang, where the memorial for his funeral sparked off a pro-democracy movement which led to the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. In Guangdong, China&#x27;s most prosperous province, the &quot;Hakka clique&quot; () has consistently dominated the provincial government. Guangdong&#x27;s Hakka governors include Ye Jianying, Ding Sheng, Ye Xuanping and Huang Huahua.

Besides playing major roles in all the three major revolutions of China, Hakkas had also been prominently involved in many of the wars against foreign intrusion of China. During the First Opium War, Lai Enjue led the Qing navy against the British at the Battle of Kowloon in 1839 and Yan Botao commanded the coastal defence at the Battle of Amoy in 1841. Feng Zicai and Liu Yongfu were instrumental in the defeat of the French at the Battle of Bang Bo which led to the French Retreat from Lạng Sơn and the conclusion of the war in 1885. When the Japanese invaded Taiwan, the Hakka militia forces led by Qiu Fengjia, were able to put up a stiff resistance to the Japanese when the Qing army could not. During the Battle of Shanghai in the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, the heroism of Xie Jinyuan and his troops, known as the &quot;Eight Hundred Warriors&quot; () in Chinese history, gained international attention and lifted flagging Chinese morale in their successful Defence of Sihang Warehouse against the better equipped Japanese. However, in the ensuing Battle of Nanjing, seventeen Nationalist generals were killed in action, of which six were Hakkas.

During the war against the Japanese, both the commander-in-chiefs of the two main Chinese communist forces, Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army, are Hakkas: Zhu De and Ye Ting. On the Nationalist side, Xue Yue and Zhang Fakui were commander-in-chiefs for the 9th and 4th War Zones respectively. Called the &quot;Patton of Asia&quot; by the West and the &quot;God of War&quot; () by the Chinese, Xue was China&#x27;s most outstanding general during the war, having won several major battles that killed hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops. Luo Zhuoying was the commander-in-chief for the 1st Route Expeditionary Forces, Burma (China&#x27;s first participation of a war overseas), 1942.

During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong from 1941 to 1945, the Dong River Column guerrilla force () was a constant harassment to the Japanese troops. The force, whose members were mostly Hakkas and led by its commander Zeng Sheng, was highly successful due to its strong Hakka network. Noteworthy accomplishments of the partisan guerrilla force included the aiding of British and Commonwealth (British Raj Colonial rulers) prisoners of war to escape successfully from Japanese internment camps and the rescuing of twenty American pilots who parachuted into Hong Kong when they were shot down.

Overseas Hakkas have also been prominent politicians in the countries they had migrated to, many of which are leading political figures of the countries or the Chinese communities there. Since the 20th century, there have been twenty Hakkas who had become heads of state or heads of government in different countries.

<text>Clemson University () is a public land-grant research university near Clemson, South Carolina, United States. Founded in 1889, Clemson is the second-largest university by enrollment in South Carolina. For the fall 2023 semester, the university enrolled a total of 22,875 undergraduate students and 5,872 graduate students, and the student/faculty ratio was 15:1.

Clemson&#x27;s campus is in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The campus now borders Lake Hartwell, which was formed by the dam completed in 1962.

Clemson University consists of seven colleges: Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences; Architecture, Arts and Humanities; The Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business; Behavioral, Social and Health Sciences; Education; Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences; and Science. Clemson University is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity.&quot;

==History==
===Beginnings===
Thomas Green Clemson, the university&#x27;s founder, came to the foothills of South Carolina in 1838, when he married Anna Maria Calhoun, daughter of John C. Calhoun, the South Carolina politician and seventh U.S. Vice President. Through the Calhoun family, Clemson became an owner of enslaved persons on the family plantation that was to become the heart of the future university. When Clemson died on April 6, 1888, he bequeathed the Fort Hill plantation and most of his estate, which he inherited from his wife, in his will to be used to establish a college that would teach scientific agriculture and the mechanical arts to South Carolinians. His decision was largely influenced by the future South Carolina Governor Benjamin Tillman. Tillman lobbied the South Carolina General Assembly to create the school as an agricultural institution for the state, and the resolution passed by only one vote.

In his will, Clemson explicitly stated he wanted the school to be modeled after what is now Mississippi State University: &quot;This institution, I desire, to be under the control and management of a board of trustees, a part of whom are hereinafter appointed, and to be modeled after the Agricultural College of Mississippi as far as practicable.&quot;

===Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina===
In November 1889, South Carolina Governor John Peter Richardson III signed the bill, thus establishing the Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina. As a result, federal funds for agricultural education from the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act and the Hatch Act of 1887 were transferred from South Carolina College (today, the University of South Carolina) to Clemson. Construction of the college began with Hardin Hall in 1890 and then main classroom buildings in 1891. Convict laborers, some as young as 13 years old, built many of the original buildings on campus. Henry Aubrey Strode became the first president of Clemson from 1890 to 1893. Edwin Craighead succeeded Strode in 1893. Clemson Agricultural College formally opened in July 1893 with an initial enrollment of 446. The common curriculum of the first incoming students was English, history, botany, mathematics, physics, and agriculture. Until 1955, the college was also an all-white male military school.


On May 22, 1894, the main building (Tillman Hall) was destroyed by a fire, which consumed the library, classrooms, and offices. Tillman Hall was rebuilt in 1894 and is still standing today. The first graduating class of Clemson was in 1896, and they had degrees in mechanical-electrical engineering and agriculture. Clemson&#x27;s first football team began in 1896, led by trainer Walter Riggs. Henry Hartzog, a graduate of The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, became president of Clemson in 1897. Hartzog created a textile department in 1898. Clemson became the first Southern school to train textile specialists. Hartzog expanded the curriculum with more industrialization skills such as foundry work, agriculture studies, and mechanics. In 1902, a large student walkout over the use of rigid military discipline escalated tensions between students and faculty, forcing Hartzog to resign. Patrick Mell succeeded Hartzog from 1902 to 1910.

Following the resignation of Mell in 1910, former Clemson Tigers football coach Walter Riggs became president of Clemson from 1910 to 1924. The Holtzendorff Hall, originally the Holzendorff YMCA, was built in 1914 designed by Rudolph E. Lee of the first graduating class of Clemson in 1896. In 1915, Riggs Field was dedicated after Walter Riggs and is the Clemson Tigers men&#x27;s soccer home field. During World War I, enrollment in Clemson declined. In 1917, Clemson formed a Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps, and in 1918, a Student Army Training Corps was formed. Effects of World War I made Clemson hire the first female faculty due to faculty changes. Riggs accepted a six-month army educational commission in 1919 overseas in France leaving Samuel Earle as acting president. On March 10, 1920, a large walkout occurred protesting unfair &quot;prison camp&quot; style military discipline. The 1920 walkout led to the creation of a Department of Student Affairs. On January 22, 1924, Riggs died on a business trip to Washington, D.C., leaving Earle the acting president. In October 1924, another walkout of around 500 students occurred when Earle rejected their demands for better food, the dismissal of mess officer Harcombe, and the reinstatement of their senior class president. The 1924 walkout resulted in 23 students being dismissed and 112 suspended.

On April 1, 1925, a fire destroyed the interior of the agricultural building and its many research projects and an agricultural museum. The exterior of the building survived, leading to the construction of Sikes Hall to hold the library from Tillman Hall. On May 27, 1926, Mechanical Hall was destroyed in a fire. Present-day Freeman Hall, built in 1926, was the reconstructed shop building. In 1928 Riggs Hall was established in honor of Walter Riggs. President Enoch Sikes increased student enrollment by over 1,000 students and expanded the degree programs with an addition of the first graduate degree. The Department of Arts and Sciences was formed in 1926 with the addition of modern language programs. Programs at Clemson were reorganized into six schools of agriculture, chemistry, engineering, general science, textiles, and vocational studies. In 1927, Clemson received accreditation from the Association of Secondary Schools and Colleges of the Southern States.

During The Great Depression, student enrollment and income declined. The New Deal brought needed construction to the campus under the Works Progress Administration with new dormitories to relieve the housing shortages. Long Hall, Sirrine Hall, and 29,625 acres of privately owned farmland were acquired by Clemson through federal funding. Agricultural engineers of Clemson diversified with the Clemson Agricultural Extension to educate farmers on soil conservation and crop storage techniques during The Great Depression. Robert Poole became the first Clemson alumnus to be president in 1940. On September 19, 1942, Memorial Stadium was formally opened as the new stadium for the Clemson Tigers football team previously played on Riggs Field since 1915.

During World War II, more than 6,500 students were sent overseas to the military. As a result of the Clemson ROTC, around 5,850 were commissioned officers. The class of 1943 had a historical low of 343 graduates. By the end of the war, 376 Clemson students had been killed in it.

===Becoming civilian and coeducational and desegregated===
In 1955, Clemson underwent a major restructuring and was transformed into a &quot;civilian&quot; status for students. It began admitting white women; the university was still segregated.

In 1963, the school admitted its first African-American student, Harvey Gantt, who later was elected as mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina.

===Clemson University===
In 1964, the college was renamed Clemson University as the state legislature formally recognized the school&#x27;s expanded academic offerings and research pursuits. The university manages the nearby Clemson Experimental Forest that is used for research, education, and recreation.

In 2015, students protested against Tillman Hall being named for Ben Tillman. Tillman was a South Carolina Governor and United States Senator and was a white supremacist during the Reconstruction era as well as a member of the Red Shirts and a known associate of the Ku Klux Klan. The board of trustees voted against renaming the building. In the summer of 2020, following the murder of George Floyd, the trustees petitioned the state legislature to remove Ben Tillman&#x27;s name from the building and restoring the original name (&quot;Old Main&quot;), at the same time it renamed the honors program, which had been named for John C. Calhoun. , no changes have been made toward renaming the building.

==Campus==
The Campus of Clemson University is outside of, and adjacent to, the Clemson city limits, in unincorporated Pickens County. Therefore, the university does not have to abide by City of Clemson municipal ordinances nor receive permission to do any undertaking from the City of Clemson. The South Carolina General Assembly designated Clemson University as a &quot;municipal corporation&quot; in 1894.

This campus was originally the site of U.S. Vice President John C. Calhoun&#x27;s plantation, named Fort Hill. The plantation passed to his daughter, Anna, and son-in-law, Thomas Green Clemson. On Clemson&#x27;s death in 1888, he willed the land to the state of South Carolina for the creation of a public university.

The university was founded in 1889, and three buildings from the initial construction still exist today: Hardin Hall (built in 1890), Main Building (later renamed Tillman Hall) (1894), and Godfrey Hall (1898). Other periods of large expansion occurred in 1936–1938 when eight new buildings were constructed, and the late 1950s through 1970, when no fewer than 25 buildings were constructed, most in a similar architectural style.

The campus area first appeared as a census-designated place (CDP) in the 2020 Census with a population of 7,311.

The CDP is located in the Pickens County School District, which covers the entire county. Any dependent children living on the Clemson campus would be zoned to that school district.

==Academics==

===Undergraduate admissions===
The 2022 annual ranking of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; categorizes Clemson as &#x27;more selective&#x27;. For the Class of 2025 (enrolled fall 2021), Clemson received 47,007 applications and accepted 23,138 (49.2%). Of those accepted, 4,589 enrolled, a yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who choose to attend the university) of 19.8%. Clemson&#x27;s freshman retention rate is 94%, with 85.5% going on to graduate within six years.

The enrolled first-year class of 2025 had the following standardized test scores: the middle 50% range (25th percentile – 75th percentile) of SAT scores was 1240–1400, while the middle 50% range of ACT scores was 27–32.

===Colleges and schools===

In July 1955, the four schools that made up Clemson—Agriculture, Arts &amp; Sciences, Engineering and Textiles—were transformed into nine colleges: Architecture, Arts and Sciences, Liberal Arts, Sciences, Commerce and Industry, Education, Engineering, Forestry and Recreation Resources, and Nursing. This structure was used by the university until 1995 when the university&#x27;s nine colleges were condensed into five: Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences; Architecture, Arts, and Humanities; Business and Behavioral Science; Engineering and Science; Health, Education, and Human Development. On July 14, 2014, the Eugene T. Moore School of Education broke off from the College of Health, Education, and Human development, thus becoming the sixth college.

An academic reorganization effective July 1, 2016, created seven new colleges: College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences; College of Architecture, Arts, and Humanities; College of Behavioral, Social and Health Sciences; College of Business; College of Education (including the Eugene T. Moore School of Education); College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences; and College of Science.

Currently, there are nine academic colleges: College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences, College of Architecture, Art and Construction, College of Arts and Humanities, College of Behavioral, Social and Health Sciences, College of Education, College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences, College of Science, the Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business, and the new College of Veterinary Medicine.

====College of Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences====
The College of Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences (CAFLS) supports Clemson University&#x27;s land-grant mission to provide education, research, and service to the public. CAFLS faculty members teach major subjects and core curricula while preparing students to be leaders, creative thinkers, and communicators. Emphasis is placed on engaging students in research, internships/coops, study abroad, and service learning. CAFLS research is focused on the sustainability of agriculture, forests, and natural resources; food and packaging systems to ensure a healthy and safe food supply, and biomedical sciences to improve human and non-human health.

====College of Architecture, Art and Construction====
The College of Architecture, Art and Construction (CAAC) contains a School of Architecture, a Department of Art and the Nieri Department of Construction, Development and Planning. Departments within the school include Construction Science and Management and Landscape Architecture. One of the departments of the college, the School of Architecture, was ranked as the No. 16 graduate school for architecture in the country by Design Intelligence. The Brooks Center serves as performing arts venue for the college.

====College of Arts and Humanities====
The College of Arts and Humanities (CAH) was founded in 2023 and has six departments: English, History and Geography, Interdisciplinary Studies, Languages, Performing Arts and Philosophy and Religion. Interdisciplinary Studies includes the Global Black Studies, Women’s Leadership and World Cinema programs. The Brooks Center serves as a performing arts venue for the college. The college also offers a pre-law program and promotes the Humanities Hub, which intends to advance the outreach, scholarly and teaching activities of the humanities.

====Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business====
The College of Business is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business.

The College of Business, after receiving a $60m gift from Wilbur and Ann Powers, was renamed the Wilbur O. and Ann Power College of Business in October 2020. The College of Business was the first to be named in the history of Clemson University.

The College of Business is ranked among the top schools on The Princeton Review’s 2023 &quot;Best Business Schools&quot; and &quot;Best Business Schools (Southeast)&quot; lists. The college is also listed on the &quot;Best Online MBA Programs&quot;. It’s ranked #10 for &quot;Best MBA for Human Resources&quot;, #34 for &quot;Top 50 Entrepreneurship: Grad&quot;, and #5 for &quot;Top South Top 50 Entrepreneurship: Grad&quot;.

, U.S. News and World Report ranks the college #98 in &quot;Best Business Schools&quot; and #56 in &quot;Part-time MBA.&quot;

==== College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences====
The College of Engineering, Computing, and Applied Sciences (CECAS) specializes in engineering as well as the physical sciences such as physics and chemistry. Inspired by Thomas Green Clemson&#x27;s dream to create a &quot;high seminary of learning to benefit the agricultural and mechanical arts,&quot; engineering and sciences have been an integral part of the university&#x27;s development. Since the first degrees were granted in 1896, Clemson engineers and scientists have made significant contributions to South Carolina, the nation, and the world.

CECAS was formed in 1995, joining the engineering disciplines with the chemistry, computer science, geological science, mathematical science, and physics and astronomy departments.

====Clemson University Honors College====
The Clemson University Honors College focuses on education for highly motivated, academically talented students. Entrance to college is very competitive, with only 250 incoming freshmen accepted each year with an average SAT score of 1400 or higher and finishing in the top 3% of their high school graduating class. The college was founded in 1962 and originally named for John C. Calhoun, a South Carolina native and politician, who was the vice president of the United States from 1825 to 1832.

====College of Education====
The College of Education is Clemson&#x27;s newest college and is centered in the Tillman Hall. The college has some 600 undergraduate students and 600 graduate students, and the mission is to embrace the diverse faculty, staff, and students and provide them with a diverse set of experiences. The COE also houses the Call Me MISTER Program and the Moore Scholars.

On June 12, 2020, university trustees petitioned the state legislature for authorization to rename Tillman Hall. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Ben Tillman was a governor and U.S. senator who used virulent racism to dominate South Carolina politics after Reconstruction.

====Graduate school====
The Graduate School offers more than 100 graduate degree programs in 85 disciplines on the college&#x27;s main campus and at sites such as Clemson at the Falls and the Clemson University International Center for Automotive Research in Greenville, the Clemson Architecture Center in the historic Cigar Factory in Charleston, the Restoration Institute in North Charleston, as well as some online/distance-learning programs. Many of the graduate programs are highly ranked nationally, and the school offers several unique interdisciplinary programs.

===Rankings===
Admission to Clemson is rated &quot;more selective&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

For the Class of 2022 (enrolling Fall 2018), Clemson received 28,845 applications and accepted 13,613 (47.2%), with 3,792 enrolling. The middle 50% range of SAT scores for enrolling freshmen was 610–690 for reading and writing, and 610–710 for math. The middle 50% ACT composite score range was 27–32. The average high school grade point average (GPA) was 4.43.




For 2025, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Clemson as tied for the 80th best national university in the U.S. overall and tied for the 39th top public school.

In 2016, The Princeton Review ranked Clemson University number one in three categories: Student Career Services, Town-Gown Relations, and Students pack the stadium.

===Research===
The Clemson University International Center for Automotive Research (CU-ICAR) was established in 2013 in Greenville as a seminary for automotive research and innovation. CU-ICAR is a automotive and motorsports research campus. The department of Automotive Engineering was ranked tenth in the world in 2015. CU-ICAR includes a graduate school offering master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees in automotive engineering, and programs focused on systems integration. The campus also includes an Information Technology Research Center being developed by BMW. BMW, Microsoft, IBM, Bosch, Timken, JTEKT/Koyo and Michelin are all major corporate partners of CU-ICAR. Private-sector companies that have committed to establishing offices and/or facilities on the campus include the Society of Automotive Engineers and Timken. Plans for the campus also include a full-scale, four-vehicle capacity rolling road wind tunnel.

The Charleston Innovation Campus in North Charleston was founded in 2004 as the Restoration Institute. It houses the Warren Lasch Conservation Center, Dominion Energy Innovation Center, and the Zucker Family Graduate Education Center. The conservation center includes the Hunley Commission, which is undertaking the stabilization of the &quot;H. L. Hunley&quot;, a Civil War submarine that was the world&#x27;s first to sink a ship. The energy innovation center opened in 2013 and houses a 7.5MW and a 15MW offshore wind turbine test facility for $100 million. In 2016, Clemson opened the Zucker Family Graduate Education Center. The 70,000 sq. ft. facility is home to graduate programs in digital arts and engineering disciplines.

In 2016, Clemson announced a new partnership with Siemens, including a grant with a total value of $357,224,294. This grant is the largest in the school&#x27;s history. Through it, students in Clemson&#x27;s College of Engineering, Computing, and Applied Sciences will have access to a variety of new software.

==Student life==

===Intramurals===

In addition to their varsity programs, Clemson offers a wide variety of intramural sports:

* Basketball
* Billiards
* Bowling
* Cornhole
* Dodgeball
* Flag football
* Indoor soccer
* Kickball
* Racquetball
* Soccer
* Softball
* Spikeball
* Tennis
* Ultimate Frisbee
* Volleyball
* Wiffleball
===Fraternity and sorority life===
The university&#x27;s fraternities and sororities system is somewhat different from other large universities in the southern U.S. in that there are no Greek houses on campus, although there are residence halls designated for fraternities and sororities. There are a few fraternity houses off campus. The remaining sororities&#x27; on-campus housing is on the other end of campus, in what is commonly referred to as &quot;the horseshoe&quot; in Smith and Barnett Halls.

In 2017, 15% of men and 31% of women were involved in Greek life, out of 19,825 undergraduate students. While the required GPA to join Greek life is 2.7, the mean GPA of each sorority was above the all-university mean.

===Military heritage===
The university is home to detachments for U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) as well as a host school for the U.S. Marine Corps PLC program adjacent to the Semper Fi Society.

In addition to students from the university, these organizations also serve students from Anderson University, Southern Wesleyan University, Bob Jones University, and Tri-County Technical College. The university&#x27;s AAS squadron was selected to be home of Arnold Air Society&#x27;s National Headquarters for the 2005–2006 year and again for the 2006–2007 year. The C-4 Pershing Rifles have won the national society&#x27;s drill meet nine times: 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2017.

===Student media===
Clemson University has five student-operated media outlets within its communication department. Each have been guided by faculty advisor and director of student media Wanda Johnson since 2019 when the outlets reintegrated as a component of the university. The five outlets are &quot;The Tiger&quot;, Tigervision, &quot;The Pendulum&quot;, &quot;The Chronicle&quot;, and WSBF-FM.

Founded in 1907, &quot;The Tiger&quot; is the oldest student-run newspaper in South Carolina. &quot;The Tiger&quot; is printed biweekly, on Thursdays, and maintains a staff of over 30 senior members and contributing staff.

Tigervision, Clemson&#x27;s student-run TV station, broadcasts on channel 88 on the university&#x27;s campus cable network. The station was created in 1994 under the name Clemson Cable Network by students at WSBF-FM. In 2007, CCN was reorganized into Clemson Television and began to produce student comedy shows and air public domain films. In 2014, CTV was renamed Tigervision to coincide with its switch to high-definition broadcasting.

&quot;The Pendulum&quot; is a student-run international affairs magazine. It was established in 2014. It publishes twice a year.

&quot;The Chronicle&quot; is a literary art magazine that publishes biannually. It was founded in 1897.

WSBF-FM was founded in 1958 and made its first broadcast on April 1, 1960. In the beginning, WSBF&#x27;s content was mostly agriculture education shows and classical music. By the mid-1960s, the station began to air sports programs such as &quot;The Frank Howard Show&quot; along with the news. The station would eventually shift to a &quot;progressive&quot; format where it focused on new, up-and-coming contemporary music groups. During the 1980s, the format would shift gradually to the station&#x27;s current &quot;alternative&quot; format. WSBF plays a variety of genres, including jazz, rap, punk, rock, and folk, focusing on independent artists. The station broadcasts to the Clemson area and upstate South Carolina on 88.1 FM and online.

&quot;TAPS Yearbook&quot; was established in 1907 after members of the Clemson College Chronicle, the literary arts magazine at the time, wanted to publish a new book printed annually. It is named after the bugle call &quot;Taps,&quot; which was played each night when cadets went to bed during the college&#x27;s time as a military school. Each edition of &quot;TAPS&quot; contains student portraits, information on student organizations, and reviews of the past year&#x27;s events. The end of the 2017–18 academic year was the final edition of the yearbook.

==Traditions==

===Tiger Paw===

The Tiger Paw became the official logo for Clemson University in 1970, in place of the previous tiger logo. The change was inspired by President Robert Edwards to &quot;upgrade the image of the university.&quot; The Tiger Paw logo was introduced at a press conference on July 21, 1970. It was created by John Antonio and developed by Helen Weaver of Henderson Advertising in Greenville, South Carolina from a mold of a Bengal tiger sent to the agency by the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. The paw is now used on all athletic teams and collegiate documents. The tiger paw is also painted on surfaces throughout campus and on highways leading to the campus.

===Homecoming and Tigerama===

Every year, Clemson students have the opportunity to attend Homecoming and Tigerama. The Clemson Homecoming tradition began in 1914 and has been held annually at Clemson University ever since. During homecoming week, various student organizations design and build Homecoming floats on Bowman Field. The floats are then revealed on the Saturday of the football game and judged by a select panel. Since 1957, Clemson has held &quot;Tigerama&quot; on the Friday night of homecoming week. Tigerama is one of the nation&#x27;s largest student-run-pep rallies, averaging about 40,000 people. This Clemson event includes the crowning of Miss Homecoming, skits by various academic organizations, and a fireworks show.

===First Friday Parade===
The First Friday Parade has been held on the Friday before the first home football game every year since 1974. The parade includes fraternities, sororities, the Clemson marching band, the university president, and many other student organizations. A pep rally is held in the university&#x27;s amphitheater. In 1985, the parade had its highest attendance when accompanying CBS commentators were the Grand Marshals.

===Alma mater===
The Clemson University alma mater originated in the 1910s after a group of Clemson ROTC cadets in May 1918 was asked to sing the school&#x27;s song at a gathering of ROTC cadets in Plattsburgh, New York; they were unable to do so, as Clemson had no song at the time. One of the cadets in attendance, A.C. Corcoran of Charleston, South Carolina, decided to remedy the situation and wrote the words to the alma mater and set them to Annie Lisle, which was the melody of Cornell University&#x27;s alma mater, as well as many others. The words were later officially accepted by the then-named Clemson Agricultural College as the alma mater and were first performed by the Clemson Glee Club on February 17, 1919.

In 1947, the club &quot;Tiger Brotherhood&quot; decided that, rather than continue borrowing another school&#x27;s melody, the university should compose its own. As a result, the Tiger Brotherhood sponsored a contest to have Clemson students compose a unique melody. On May 5, 1947, Clemson University&#x27;s school newspaper &quot;The Tiger&quot; announced Robert E. Farmer of Anderson, South Carolina, a member of the glee club at the time, as the winner. Farmer&#x27;s melody was slightly altered in 1970 but was restored to its original tune in 2009.

===Fight song===
The university&#x27;s fight song is the jazz standard, the &quot;Tiger Rag&quot;.

===Memorial Stadium traditions===
==Athletics==
Clemson University teams are known as the Tigers. They compete as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I level (Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) sub-level for football), primarily competing in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) for all sports since the 1953–54 season. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, tennis, and track &amp; field, while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, gymnastics, rowing, soccer, diving, tennis, track &amp; field, softball, and volleyball.

The most-prominent athletics facilities on campus are Memorial Stadium, Littlejohn Coliseum, Doug Kingsmore Stadium, Historic Riggs Field, and Fike Recreation Center.

In 2020, university officials decided to dissolve its Men&#x27;s Track and Field and Cross Country teams at the end of the academic year. Despite pressure from student activists, the university did not reverse its decision until a class-action Title IX lawsuit was formed. Following pressure from state officials, the university reversed its decision on April 22, 2021. The university followed this by announcing the additions of women&#x27;s lacrosse and gymnastics.

==Public safety and governance==

Clemson University operates with the Clemson University Police Department and the Clemson University Fire &amp; EMS for public safety needs. Both departments are staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Clemson University Fire &amp; EMS has two stations: the headquarters at 1521 Perimeter Road, and a second station at 740 Issaqueena Trail. The Police Department is located at 124 Ravenel Center Place, Seneca.

Clemson University Fire Department provides fire protection to the City of Clemson.

The governing body of the municipal corporation of Clemson University is the university&#x27;s board of trustees. Clemson University has its own municipal court, which is housed in Gentry Hall. The judge of that court is appointed by the board of trustees, and the Clemson student affairs division manages the court. The university may not put in place its own taxes, and purchasing of food and beverage does not come with additional taxes that the City of Clemson levies in its jurisdiction. Additionally, Clemson University has its own policies on the open carrying of alcohol while the municipal code of the City of Clemson explicitly forbids open carrying of alcohol.

<text>In mathematics, and in other disciplines involving formal languages, including mathematical logic and computer science, a variable may be said to be either free or bound. Some older books use the terms real variable and apparent variable for free variable and bound variable, respectively. A &quot;free variable&quot; is a notation (symbol) that specifies places in an expression where substitution may take place and is not a parameter of this or any container expression. The idea is related to a &quot;placeholder&quot; (a symbol that will later be replaced by some value), or a wildcard character that stands for an unspecified symbol.

In computer programming, the term free variable refers to variables used in a function that are neither local variables nor parameters of that function. The term non-local variable is often a synonym in this context.

An instance of a variable symbol is &quot;bound&quot;, in contrast, if the value of that variable symbol has been bound to a specific value or range of values in the domain of discourse or universe. This may be achieved through the use of logical quantifiers, variable-binding operators, or an explicit statement of allowed values for the variable (such as, &quot;...where formula_1 is a positive integer&quot;.) A variable symbol overall is bound if at least one occurrence of it is bound.pp.142--143 Since the same variable symbol may appear in multiple places in an expression, some occurrences of the variable symbol may be free while others are bound,p.78 hence &quot;free&quot; and &quot;bound&quot; are at first defined for occurrences and then generalized over all occurrences of said variable symbol in the expression. However it is done, the variable ceases to be an independent variable on which the value of the expression depends, whether that value be a truth value or the numerical result of a calculation, or, more generally, an element of an image set of a function.

While the domain of discourse in many contexts is understood, when an explicit range of values for the bound variable has not been given, it may be necessary to specify the domain in order to properly evaluate the expression. For example, consider the following expression in which both variables are bound by logical quantifiers:

:formula_2

This expression evaluates to &quot;false&quot; if the domain of formula_3 and formula_4 is the real numbers, but &quot;true&quot; if the domain is the complex numbers.

The term &quot;dummy variable&quot; is also sometimes used for a bound variable (more commonly in general mathematics than in computer science), but this should not be confused with the identically named but unrelated concept of dummy variable as used in statistics, most commonly in regression analysis.p.17

==Examples==
Before stating a precise definition of free variable and bound variable, the following are some examples that perhaps make these two concepts clearer than the definition would:

In the expression

:formula_5

&quot;n&quot; is a free variable and &quot;k&quot; is a bound variable; consequently the value of this expression depends on the value of &quot;n&quot;, but there is nothing called &quot;k&quot; on which it could depend.

In the expression 

:formula_6

&quot;y&quot; is a free variable and &quot;x&quot; is a bound variable; consequently the value of this expression depends on the value of &quot;y&quot;, but there is nothing called &quot;x&quot; on which it could depend.

In the expression

:formula_7

&quot;x&quot; is a free variable and &quot;h&quot; is a bound variable; consequently the value of this expression depends on the value of &quot;x&quot;, but there is nothing called &quot;h&quot; on which it could depend.

In the expression

:formula_8

&quot;z&quot; is a free variable and &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are bound variables, associated with logical quantifiers; consequently the logical value of this expression depends on the value of &quot;z&quot;, but there is nothing called &quot;x&quot; or &quot;y&quot; on which it could depend.

More widely, in most proofs, bound variables are used. For example, the following proof shows that all squares of positive even integers are divisible by formula_9

:Let formula_1 be a positive even integer. Then there is an integer formula_11 such that formula_12. Since formula_13, we have formula_14 divisible by formula_9

not only &quot;k&quot; but also &quot;n&quot; have been used as bound variables as a whole in the proof.

===Variable-binding operators===
The following

: formula_16

are some common variable-binding operators. Each of them binds the variable x for some set S.

Many of these are operators which act on functions of the bound variable. In more complicated contexts, such notations can become awkward and confusing. It can be useful to switch to notations which make the binding explicit, such as

: formula_17

for sums or

: formula_18

for differentiation.

==Formal explanation==
Variable-binding mechanisms occur in different contexts in mathematics, logic and computer science. In all cases, however, they are purely syntactic properties of expressions and variables in them. For this section we can summarize syntax by identifying an expression with a tree whose leaf nodes are variables, constants, function constants or predicate constants and whose non-leaf nodes are logical operators. This expression can then be determined by doing an inorder traversal of the tree. Variable-binding operators are logical operators that occur in almost every formal language. A binding operator Q takes two arguments: a variable &quot;v&quot; and an expression &quot;P&quot;, and when applied to its arguments produces a new expression Q(&quot;v&quot;, &quot;P&quot;). The meaning of binding operators is supplied by the semantics of the language and does not concern us here.

Variable binding relates three things: a variable &quot;v&quot;, a location &quot;a&quot; for that variable in an expression and a non-leaf node &quot;n&quot; of the form Q(&quot;v&quot;, &quot;P&quot;). Note: we define a location in an expression as a leaf node in the syntax tree. Variable binding occurs when that location is below the node &quot;n&quot;.

In the lambda calculus, codice_1 is a bound variable in the term codice_2 and a free variable in the term codice_3. We say codice_1 is bound in codice_5 and free in codice_3. If codice_3 contains a subterm codice_8 then codice_1 is rebound in this term. This nested, inner binding of codice_1 is said to &quot;shadow&quot; the outer binding. Occurrences of codice_1 in codice_12 are free occurrences of the new codice_1.

Variables bound at the top level of a program are technically free variables within the terms to which they are bound but are often treated specially because they can be compiled as fixed addresses. Similarly, an identifier bound to a recursive function is also technically a free variable within its own body but is treated specially.

A &quot;closed term&quot; is one containing no free variables.

===Function expressions===
To give an example from mathematics, consider an expression which defines a function

: formula_19

where &quot;t&quot; is an expression. &quot;t&quot; may contain some, all or none of the &quot;x&quot;1, …, &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; and it may contain other variables. In this case we say that function definition binds the variables &quot;x&quot;1, …, &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

In this manner, function definition expressions of the kind shown above can be thought of as &quot;the&quot; variable binding operator, analogous to the lambda expressions of lambda calculus. Other binding operators, like the summation sign, can be thought of as higher-order functions applying to a function. So, for example, the expression

: formula_20

could be treated as a notation for

: formula_21

where formula_22 is an operator with two parameters—a one-parameter function, and a set to evaluate that function over. The other operators listed above can be expressed in similar ways; for example, the universal quantifier formula_23 can be thought of as an operator that evaluates to the logical conjunction of the Boolean-valued function &quot;P&quot; applied over the (possibly infinite) set &quot;S&quot;.

==Natural language==
When analyzed in formal semantics, natural languages can be seen to have free and bound variables. In English, personal pronouns like &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;they&quot;, etc. can act as free variables.

: &quot;Lisa found her book.&quot;

In the sentence above, the possessive pronoun &quot;her&quot; is a free variable. It may refer to the previously mentioned &quot;Lisa&quot; or to any other female. In other words, &quot;her book&quot; could be referring to Lisa&#x27;s book (an instance of coreference) or to a book that belongs to a different female (e.g. Jane&#x27;s book). Whoever the referent of &quot;her&quot; is can be established according to the situational (i.e. pragmatic) context. The identity of the referent can be shown using coindexing subscripts where &quot;i&quot; indicates one referent and &quot;j&quot; indicates a second referent (different from &quot;i&quot;). Thus, the sentence &quot;Lisa found her book&quot; has the following interpretations:

: &quot;Lisai found heri book.&quot; (interpretation #1: &quot;her&quot; = of &quot;Lisa&quot;)
: &quot;Lisai found herj book.&quot; (interpretation #2: &quot;her&quot; = of a female that is not Lisa)

The distinction is not purely of academic interest, as some languages do actually have different forms for &quot;heri&quot; and &quot;herj&quot;: for example, Norwegian and Swedish translate coreferent &quot;heri&quot; as &quot;sin&quot; and noncoreferent &quot;herj&quot; as &quot;hennes&quot;.

English does allow specifying coreference, but it is optional, as both interpretations of the previous example are valid (the ungrammatical interpretation is indicated with an asterisk):

: &quot;Lisai found heri own book.&quot; (interpretation #1: &quot;her&quot; = of &quot;Lisa&quot;)
: *&quot;Lisai found herj own book.&quot; (interpretation #2: &quot;her&quot; = of a female that is not Lisa)

However, reflexive pronouns, such as &quot;himself&quot;, &quot;herself&quot;, &quot;themselves&quot;, etc., and reciprocal pronouns, such as &quot;each other&quot;, act as bound variables. In a sentence like the following:

: &quot;Jane hurt herself.&quot;

the reflexive &quot;herself&quot; can only refer to the previously mentioned antecedent, in this case &quot;Jane&quot;, and can never refer to a different female person. In this example, the variable &quot;herself&quot; is bound to the noun &quot;Jane&quot; that occurs in subject position. Indicating the coindexation, the first interpretation with &quot;Jane&quot; and &quot;herself&quot; coindexed is permissible, but the other interpretation where they are not coindexed is ungrammatical:

: &quot;Janei hurt herselfi.&quot; (interpretation #1: &quot;herself&quot; = &quot;Jane&quot;)
: *&quot;Janei hurt herselfj.&quot; (interpretation #2: &quot;herself&quot; = a female that is not Jane)

The coreference binding can be represented using a lambda expression as mentioned in the previous Formal explanation section. The sentence with the reflexive could be represented as

: (λ&quot;x&quot;.&quot;x&quot; hurt &quot;x&quot;)Jane

in which &quot;Jane&quot; is the subject referent argument and &quot;λx.x hurt x&quot; is the predicate function (a lambda abstraction) with the lambda notation and &quot;x&quot; indicating both the semantic subject and the semantic object of sentence as being bound. This returns the semantic interpretation &quot;JANE hurt JANE&quot; with &quot;JANE&quot; being the same person.

Pronouns can also behave in a different way. In the sentence below

: &quot;Ashley hit her.&quot;

the pronoun &quot;her&quot; can only refer to a female that is not Ashley. This means that it can never have a reflexive meaning equivalent to &quot;Ashley hit herself&quot;. The grammatical and ungrammatical interpretations are:

: *&quot;Ashleyi hit heri.&quot; (interpretation #1: &quot;her&quot; = &quot;Ashley&quot;)
: &quot;Ashleyi hit herj.&quot; (interpretation #2: &quot;her&quot; = a female that is not Ashley)

The first interpretation is impossible. Only the second interpretation is permitted by the grammar.

Thus, it can be seen that reflexives and reciprocals are bound variables (known technically as anaphors) while true pronouns are free variables in some grammatical structures but variables that cannot be bound in other grammatical structures. The binding phenomena found in natural languages was particularly important to the syntactic government and binding theory (see also: Binding (linguistics)).

<doc id="147462" wikidata="Q300602" url="?curid=147462" title="A Tribe Called Quest">
<text>A Tribe Called Quest was an American hip hop group formed in Queens, New York City, in 1985, originally composed of rapper and main producer Q-Tip, rapper Phife Dawg, DJ and co-producer Ali Shaheed Muhammad, and rapper Jarobi White. The group is regarded as a pioneer of alternative hip hop and merging jazz with hip hop, influencing numerous hip hop and R&amp;B musicians.

A Tribe Called Quest came to prominence as members of the Native Tongues collective, which they co-founded in 1988. The group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot; (1990), established them as a critically acclaimed act, earning the first five &#x27;mic&#x27; rating in &quot;The Source&quot;″s history. In 1991, the group saw commercial success with its jazz-infused second album, &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;, which heavily shaped alternative hip hop in the 1990s. It was followed by the similarly successful and influential &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot; (1993), and &quot;Beats, Rhymes and Life&quot; (1996), which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In 1998, the group disbanded shortly before releasing its fifth album &quot;The Love Movement&quot;, but in 2006, the original members reunited and toured sporadically for the next seven years. In 2016, the group released its sixth and final album, &quot;We Got It from Here... Thank You 4 Your Service&quot;, which received critical acclaim and became its second album to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; it featured posthumous contributions from Phife Dawg, who died eight months before its release.

A Tribe Called Quest was the most commercially successful act in the Native Tongues, with all six of its albums certified either gold or platinum. John Bush of AllMusic called them &quot;the most intelligent, artistic rap group during the 1990s&quot;, and Kris Ex of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; regarded them as &quot;one of the greatest acts that hip-hop has ever produced&quot;. In 2005, A Tribe Called Quest received the Founders Award at the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Awards, and two years later, the group was honored at the 4th VH1 Hip Hop Honors. In 2017, the group was awarded the Brit Award for International Group. A Tribe Called Quest was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2024.

==History==
===1985–1990: Formation, Native Tongues, and &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels&quot;===

Q-Tip (Kamaal Fareed) and Phife Dawg (Malik Taylor) were childhood friends who grew up together in the St. Albans neighbourhood of Queens, New York City. Initially, Q-Tip performed as a battle rapper, under the name MC Love Child, occasionally teaming up with Murry Bergtraum High School classmate Ali Shaheed Muhammad as a rapper and DJ duo. In 1985, the duo began making demos over Q-Tip&#x27;s pause tape beats. Phife Dawg later joined them, though he didn&#x27;t become a full member until neighbourhood friend Jarobi White joined; the group dubbed themselves &quot;Crush Connection&quot; and later &quot;Quest&quot;. The group&#x27;s final name, A Tribe Called Quest, was coined in 1988 by Jungle Brothers, who attended the same high school as Q-Tip and Muhammad; that year, Q-Tip made his first recorded appearances on Jungle Brothers&#x27; songs &quot;Black Is Black&quot; and &quot;The Promo&quot;. Shortly after, A Tribe Called Quest, Jungle Brothers, De La Soul, Queen Latifah and Monie Love formed the Native Tongues collective, known for their like-minded Afrocentrism, positivity and eclectic sampling. In 1989, Phife Dawg made his first recorded appearance on the song &quot;Buddy (Native Tongue Decision)&quot;, the remix of De La Soul&#x27;s single &quot;Buddy&quot;.

A Tribe Called Quest hired Kool DJ Red Alert as their first manager. In early 1989, the group signed a demo deal with Geffen Records and produced a five-song demo, which included future single &quot;I Left My Wallet in El Segundo&quot;. Geffen decided against offering the group a recording contract, and the group was granted permission to shop for a deal elsewhere. After receiving lucrative offers for multi-album deals from a variety of labels, the group opted for a modest deal offered by Jive Records. Jive was then known as an independent rap label that partly owed its success to building the careers of artists Boogie Down Productions and Too Short. Later that year, the group released their first 12&quot; single, &quot;Description of a Fool&quot;.

Their debut album, &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot;, released on April 10, 1990, was marked by a playful lyrical approach and light-hearted content such as safe sex, vegetarianism and youthful experiences. The music was an eclectic mix of jazz, funk, soul and rock samples. The album was met with critical acclaim; &quot;The Source&quot; rated it five mics, becoming the first album to receive the magazine&#x27;s highest rating. &quot;NME&quot;″s review stated that &quot;This is not rap, it&#x27;s near perfection.&quot; The album only gained momentum after the release of the singles &quot;Bonita Applebum&quot; and &quot;Can I Kick It?&quot;, eventually achieving gold certification in 1996.

===1991–1993: &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;, &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot;, and commercial success===

A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;, was released on September 24, 1991, with &quot;Check the Rhime&quot; as the lead single; the song largely established the lyrical interplay between Q-Tip and Phife Dawg. Until then, most of the group&#x27;s songs had only featured vocals by Q-Tip, but Q-Tip encouraged Phife Dawg to increase his participation despite his recent diabetes diagnosis. Musically, the album fused hip hop with the laid-back atmosphere of jazz, particularly bebop and hard bop, combined with a minimalist approach to production that stripped the sound down to vocals, drums and bass. Mixing engineer Bob Power played a major role on the album, as he was tasked with removing surface noise and static that is typically heard on hip hop songs sampled from old vinyl records. During the recording sessions, White left the group to pursue a career in culinary arts, and they hired Chris Lighty as their new manager after signing to Rush Artist Management.

Lyrically, the group focused on a range of social issues, from date rape (&quot;The Infamous Date Rape&quot;) to consumerism (&quot;Skypager&quot;), while also criticizing the hip hop industry on several songs. Guests on the album included Leaders of the New School, Brand Nubian, Vinia Mojica and Ron Carter, who played double bass on the song &quot;Verses from the Abstract&quot;. Additional singles included &quot;Jazz (We&#x27;ve Got)&quot; and &quot;Scenario&quot;; a live performance of &quot;Scenario&quot; with Leaders of the New School on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; led to greater popularity. Leaders member Busta Rhymes attracted attention with his verse in the song, which led to him launching a successful solo career.

&quot;The Low End Theory&quot; received widespread acclaim from critics. &quot;The Source&quot; gave the group its second consecutive five mic rating, praising their &quot;progressive sound&quot; and &quot;streetwise edge&quot;, also noting that &quot;Those who questioned Phife&#x27;s microphone techniques on the first album will swallow those doubts as he practically steals the show on this one.&quot; The album peaked at #45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified gold on February 19, 1992; it reached platinum status by 1995. In the aftermath of their success, the group contributed the song &quot;Hot Sex&quot; to the soundtrack for the film &quot;Boomerang&quot; in 1992.

Conrad Tillard, then known variously as the Hip Hop Minister and Conrad Muhammad, became a fixture in hip-hop in 1993 after he arranged a meeting and a truce in a feud between rising bands Wreckx-N-Effect and A Tribe Called Quest, that Tillard said threatened to turn Harlem into a &quot;war zone&quot;.

A Tribe Called Quest released their third album, &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot;, on November 9, 1993. The lead single, &quot;Award Tour&quot;, became the group&#x27;s highest-charting single and helped to land the album at #8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The production, still rooted in jazz, was a return to the eclectic sounds found on &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels&quot;, with a more prominent funk influence, including grittier drums. The voice of a &quot;tour guide&quot;, on the intro and at the end of several tracks, added further cohesion to the album.

&quot;Midnight Marauders&quot; saw improved lyrical interplay between Phife Dawg and Q-Tip, as evidenced on the singles &quot;Electric Relaxation&quot; and &quot;Oh My God&quot;; the popularity of &quot;Electric Relaxation&quot; led to it becoming the opening theme song for the sitcom &quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot;, from 1995 to 1996. Topics on the album include police harassment (&quot;Midnight&quot;), religious faith (&quot;God Lives Through&quot;), hip hop (&quot;We Can Get Down&quot;) and use of the word nigga (&quot;Sucka Nigga&quot;). Guests on the album include Large Professor, Busta Rhymes and Raphael Saadiq (credited as Raphael Wiggins).

The album received widespread acclaim from critics. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the album &quot;as fresh as their first&quot;, while &quot;Melody Maker&quot; stated &quot;A Tribe Called Quest have expanded their vision with a lyrical gravitas and a musical lightness of touch that has hitherto eluded them across a whole album&quot;. The album was ranked #21 by &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in that year&#x27;s Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot; became A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s fastest-selling album; it was certified platinum on January 11, 1995, only 14 months after its release.

===1994–1995: Intermission and the Ummah===
At the 1994 Source Awards, Tupac Shakur and his group Thug Life performed their song &quot;Out on Bail&quot;, interrupting A Tribe Called Quest as they accepted the award for Group of the Year; it was later found that this apparent act of disrespect was accidental. That summer, the group performed as one of a handful of hip hop acts on the Lollapalooza tour, among acts such as The Smashing Pumpkins, Stereolab and The Verve. While on tour, keyboardist Amp Fiddler introduced Q-Tip to a young producer from Detroit named Jay Dee. At the suggestion of Q-Tip, Jay Dee later joined him and Muhammad, forming a production unit known as The Ummah (Arabic for &quot;the [worldwide] Muslim community&quot;), in which each member produced songs individually and received a songwriting credit for their work. The Ummah handled the production of A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s next two albums.

During this period, group members contributed to several notable outside projects with production and guest verses. Phife Dawg, who rapped on &quot;Oh My God&quot; that he owned &quot;more condoms than TLC&quot;, made an appearance on the song &quot;Intro-lude&quot; from that group&#x27;s album, &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot;, in 1994. That year, Q-Tip produced the single &quot;One Love&quot; from Nas&#x27; debut album &quot;Illmatic&quot; and appeared on the song &quot;Get It Together&quot; by Beastie Boys, from their album &quot;Ill Communication&quot;. In 1995, Muhammad co-produced the single &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; from D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s debut album of the same name, and Q-Tip produced three songs for Mobb Deep while serving as a mixing engineer for their album &quot;The Infamous&quot;. The group contributed &quot;Glamour and Glitz&quot; to &quot;The Show: The Soundtrack&quot; that year, before returning the following year with their next album.

===1996–1998: &quot;Beats, Rhymes and Life&quot;, &quot;The Love Movement&quot;, and breakup===

&quot;Beats, Rhymes and Life&quot;, the group&#x27;s fourth album, was released on July 30, 1996, supported by the singles &quot;1nce Again&quot; and &quot;Stressed Out&quot;. It was recorded during the turbulent East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry, with the tracks &quot;Get a Hold&quot;, &quot;Keeping It Moving&quot; and &quot;Baby Phife&#x27;s Return&quot; referring to it. The Ummah&#x27;s production style, a minimalist R&amp;B and jazz-infused sound, was a departure from the group&#x27;s previous albums. Jay Dee, a big fan of A Tribe Called Quest, contributed five beats to the album, including both singles. Lyrically, the album featured a less playful, more philosophical approach by the group. Consequence, Q-Tip&#x27;s cousin, and an aspiring rapper, was present on six songs. Phife Dawg later stated that this period was when he began to lose interest in the group:

The album debuted at #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and went gold before the end of the year; it was certified platinum in 1998. Critical reception was divided, but mostly positive; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;near-flawless&quot;, while &quot;The Source&quot; awarded it four mics. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; felt that it provided &quot;both their best and worst thus far&quot;. It was nominated for Best Rap Album and &quot;1nce Again&quot; was nominated for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group at the 1997 Grammy Awards.

In 1997, the group was featured on the Fugees single &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot;, alongside Busta Rhymes and John Forté, from the &quot;When We Were Kings&quot; soundtrack. They also appeared on the soundtrack &quot;Men in Black: The Album&quot;, with the song &quot;Same Ol&#x27; Thing&quot;. In Europe, they released &quot;The Jam EP&quot;, which included the aforementioned song, &quot;Mardi Gras at Midnight&quot; (featuring Rah Digga) and two songs from &quot;Beats, Rhymes and Life&quot;, &quot;Get a Hold&quot; and &quot;Jam&quot;. That year also saw the first reunion of the three Native Tongues groups since 1989, when Jungle Brothers invited A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul to guest on &quot;How Ya Want It We Got It&quot;, a song from their album &quot;Raw Deluxe&quot;.

A month before &quot;The Love Movement&quot; was released on September 29, 1998, the group announced that it would be their final album. The group cited their frustration with Jive as a significant factor in the breakup. The album, which was centered on the theme of love, was promoted by the single &quot;Find a Way&quot;, a song that &quot;innocently wonders about the point at which friendship spills over into sex&quot;. Musically, the album saw the return of The Ummah&#x27;s stripped-down production style from &quot;Beats, Rhymes and Life&quot;. Guest appearances by Busta Rhymes, Redman and Noreaga helped to balance the subdued tone of the album.

&quot;The Love Movement&quot; was certified gold on November 1, 1998, just over a month after its release. Critical reception was mostly positive; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; remarked that &quot;the mature, accomplished niceness of &quot;The Love Movement&quot; proves that the Tribe still have the skills – they&#x27;re just short on thrills.&quot; The album was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 1999 Grammy Awards.

=== 1999–2005: Solo projects and brief return to recording ===
Under the management of Violator, Q-Tip launched a successful solo career, which saw two &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hits, &quot;Vivrant Thing&quot; and &quot;Breathe and Stop&quot;, and the release of the gold-certified album &quot;Amplified&quot; in late 1999. The album featured production by Q-Tip, Jay Dee and DJ Scratch. Despite receiving mostly positive reviews, the album was criticized by the hip hop community for its mainstream sound. The most notable of Q-Tip&#x27;s critics was Phife Dawg, who took his former partner to task on his solo album &quot;&quot;, released in 2000. The Hi-Tek-produced lead single, &quot;Flawless&quot;, contained the lines &quot;Go &#x27;head, play yourself with them ho-like hooks / sing ballads if it&#x27;s all about the Maxwell look&quot;. &quot;Ventilation&quot; included production by Jay Dee and Pete Rock.

Teaming up with two other artists from former groups, Raphael Saadiq of Tony! Toni! Toné! and Dawn Robinson of En Vogue, Muhammad&#x27;s next project was Lucy Pearl. The group scored two hit singles with &quot;Dance Tonight&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with My Man&quot;, from their self-titled album, which was certified gold a few months after its release in 2000. Following a dispute between Saadiq and Robinson, the latter left the group and was replaced by Joi; however, this new incarnation would only last for the remainder of touring.

In 2001, Q-Tip changed directions and recorded &quot;Kamaal the Abstract&quot;, an album which saw him in the role of singer and bandleader. Unlike his work with A Tribe Called Quest, or his previous solo work, &quot;Kamaal&quot; was constructed around live music and abstract song concepts. Arista Records refused to release the album, doubting its commercial potential, resulting in Q-Tip leaving the label. The following year, he recorded the song &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; for the &quot;Soundbombing III&quot; compilation, in which he responded to Phife Dawg&#x27;s comments on &quot;Flawless&quot;.

In 2003, Q-Tip and Phife Dawg put aside their differences and A Tribe Called Quest briefly returned to the studio, recording the song &quot;I C U (Doin&#x27; It)&quot;, featuring Erykah Badu. It was intended to be the first single from the Violator compilation, &quot;V3: The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly&quot;, however, the album was not released. Undeterred by the shelving of &quot;Kamaal the Abstract&quot;, Q-Tip recorded &quot;Open&quot; in late 2003, planning to release it the next year. It featured contributions from André 3000, Common and D&#x27;Angelo. However, his label, DreamWorks Records, got bought out by Universal Music Group, which eventually led to &quot;Open&quot; also getting shelved.

On August 27, 2004, A Tribe Called Quest headlined the Street Scene music festival in San Diego. Muhammad focused on developing a stable of artists, most of whom were showcased on his debut solo album, &quot;Shaheedullah and Stereotypes&quot;, released later that year. In 2005, the group received the Founders Award at the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Awards in Atlanta.

=== 2006–2013: Reunion and touring ===
In 2006, the group reunited as a touring band, in part, to help Phife Dawg with his mounting medical expenses. They co-headlined that year&#x27;s Bumbershoot festival in Seattle and performed several sold-out concerts in the U.S., Canada and Japan. The group also appeared on the 2K Sports Bounce Tour, promoting the &quot;NBA 2K7&quot; video game, with a Dan the Automator remix of their song &quot;Lyrics to Go&quot; appearing on the game&#x27;s soundtrack. According to Phife Dawg at the time, A Tribe Called Quest planned to release an album, as they owed Jive one more in their six-album contract. Speaking about the possibility of a new album showing up that year, Phife Dawg said:

In 2007, A Tribe Called Quest was honored at the 4th VH1 Hip Hop Honors, with a tribute performance by Busta Rhymes, Common, Lupe Fiasco and Pharrell Williams. The group was named the headlining act for the 2008 Rock the Bells tour. That year, Phife Dawg received a kidney transplant from his wife. In late 2008, Q-Tip released his long-awaited second album, &quot;The Renaissance&quot;, on Universal Motown Records. After being shelved for seven years, &quot;Kamaal the Abstract&quot; was finally released in 2009, on Battery Records.

The group co-headlined the 2010 Rock the Bells tour. Phife Dawg planned to release his follow-up album, &quot;Songs in the Key of Phife: Volume 1 (Cheryl&#x27;s Big Son)&quot;, that year; however, his health issues delayed the release of the album. The group was the subject of the 2011 documentary, &quot;Beats, Rhymes &amp; Life: The Travels of A Tribe Called Quest&quot;, directed by Michael Rapaport. In 2012, Q-Tip signed to Kanye West&#x27;s GOOD Music label and prepared the release of his new album, &quot;The Last Zulu&quot;, which later became heavily delayed. At the 2012 BET Hip Hop Awards, the group took part in a tribute performance for former manager Chris Lighty, who had recently died.

In 2013, the group performed at a handful of select festivals throughout the summer, including Yahoo! Wireless in London, Splash! in Germany, OpenAir Frauenfeld in Switzerland, and in Los Angeles. In November 2013, two of the four New York shows for West&#x27;s Yeezus Tour featured A Tribe Called Quest as supporting acts. According to statements made by Q-Tip at the time, these were intended to be A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s final performances.

===2015–2017: &quot;We Got It from Here&quot;, death of Phife Dawg, and final tour===

On November 13, 2015, A Tribe Called Quest reunited to perform on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;. That day, the group reissued &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot;, in commemoration of its 25th anniversary. The reissue included remixes by Pharrell Williams, J. Cole and CeeLo Green. In addition, they participated in an AMA on Reddit, where users asked the group questions. On the night of their &quot;Tonight Show&quot; appearance, the same night of the terrorist attacks in Paris, the group felt &quot;charged&quot; and put aside their differences, deciding to record a new album, &quot;We Got It from Here... Thank You 4 Your Service&quot;, in secrecy. Muhammad was unable to attend recording sessions for the album, as he was producing the &quot;Luke Cage&quot; soundtrack with Adrian Younge at the time.

Phife Dawg died on March 22, 2016, due to complications relating to diabetes. The album was incomplete when Phife Dawg died, but the surviving members continued to work on it following his death. That August, Epic Records CEO L.A. Reid revealed that the label would be releasing a new A Tribe Called Quest album in the near future. &quot;We Got It from Here... Thank You 4 Your Service&quot; was subsequently announced in October, with a release date of November 11, 2016; it became the group&#x27;s second album to debut at #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The day after its release, the group appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and performed in front of a mural of Phife Dawg.

&quot;We Got It from Here&quot; featured guest appearances by André 3000, Kendrick Lamar, Jack White, Elton John, Kanye West, Anderson .Paak, Talib Kweli, Consequence and Busta Rhymes. Promoted by the hit single &quot;We the People...&quot;, which opposed Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign, the album received widespread acclaim from critics. Lyrically, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; believed that the group &quot;maintain the attitude of the Bohemian everydude funkonauts&quot; that inspired many prominent hip hop artists. AllMusic praised the album&#x27;s &quot;visionary and pleasingly weird production&quot;, which drew from several different genres and sample sources. Speaking with &quot;Billboard&quot;, Q-Tip revealed plans for the group to do a final world tour, to promote the album and honor Phife Dawg, before permanently disbanding. It was also announced that a new Phife Dawg solo album, &quot;Forever&quot;, mostly completed before his death, would be released in the near future; the album was released in 2022.

On February 12, 2017, A Tribe Called Quest performed alongside Anderson .Paak, Busta Rhymes and Consequence at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. Later that month, the group won the award for best International Group at the 2017 Brit Awards. On May 22, 2017, &quot;We Got It from Here&quot; achieved gold certification, making all six of the group&#x27;s albums RIAA-certified. The group performed at a number of festivals throughout the summer; they performed their final concert on September 9, 2017, at Bestival in Dorset, England. After disbanding, a short film for the album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;The Space Program&quot;, was released on March 29, 2018, and billed as the group&#x27;s final video.

==Legacy==

AllMusic critic John Bush called A Tribe Called Quest &quot;without question the most intelligent, artistic rap group during the 1990s&quot;, further stating that the group &quot;jump-started and perfected the hip-hop alternative to hardcore and gangsta rap.&quot; At a time when James Brown drum breaks and P-Funk basslines dominated hip hop production, the group successfully bridged the gap between jazz and hip hop, incorporating bebop and hard bop samples and recording with double bassist Ron Carter. The group&#x27;s production influenced their contemporaries, thus changing the sound of hip hop; Dr. Dre produced his highly regarded debut &quot;The Chronic&quot; after being inspired by &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;, and Pete Rock stated, &quot;There were times when I would walk into a record store and see Tip sitting on the floor with his glasses on, going through albums, looking for beats ... I was like, &#x27;This guy is serious.&#x27; Being around [the group] made me step up and become even more serious than I was.&quot;
Elton John regarded them as &quot;the seminal hip-hop band of all-time&quot;.

Lyrically, A Tribe Called Quest has been regarded for addressing many social issues through Q-Tip&#x27;s philosophical viewpoints and Phife Dawg&#x27;s everyman perspectives. &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot; influenced several notable hip hop artists; Scarface asserted that it &quot;really made me want to rap&quot;, and Pharrell Williams expressed that it was &quot;the turning point [which] made me see that music was art.&quot; Kierna Mayo, former editor-in-chief of &quot;Ebony&quot;, said that &quot;The Low End Theory&quot; and &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot; &quot;gave birth to neo-everything... That entire class of D&#x27;Angelo, Erykah Badu, Maxwell, and Lauryn Hill—and moving on to André 3000, Kanye West, and Talib Kweli—everything that is left of everything begins with Tribe.&quot; The group has also been credited for helping launch the solo careers of Busta Rhymes, J Dilla and Consequence. The Roots drummer Ahmir Thompson&#x27;s stage name &quot;Questlove&quot; was inspired by A Tribe Called Quest, whom he cited as his favorite group, stating, &quot;They&#x27;re my Beatles.&quot; The group&#x27;s name serves as the inspiration for the name of electronic music group A Tribe Called Red, now known as The Halluci Nation.

In 2003, &quot;The Low End Theory&quot; was ranked 153rd on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In a revised 2020 list, its ranking moved up to 43rd, and &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot; was added to the list at 201st. The group&#x27;s single &quot;Can I Kick It?&quot; was ranked 292nd on the 2021 revision of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 2022, &quot;The Low End Theory&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry. In 2024, A Tribe Called Quest was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

<text>Outer Mongolia was the name of a territory in the Manchu-led Qing dynasty of China from 1691 to 1911. It corresponds to the modern-day independent state of Mongolia and the Russian republic of Tuva. The historical region gained &quot;de facto&quot; independence from Qing China during the Xinhai Revolution.

While the administrative region of Outer Mongolia during the Qing dynasty only consisted of the four Khalkha aimags (Setsen Khan Aimag, Tüsheet Khan Aimag, Sain Noyon Khan Aimag, and Zasagt Khan Aimag), in the late Qing period, &quot;Outer Mongolia&quot; was also used to refer to the combined Khalkha and Oirat regions, as well as the directly-ruled Tannu Uriankhai.

Much of the region was subsequently claimed by the Republic of China, which had acquired the legal right to inherit all Qing territories through the Imperial Edict of the Abdication of the Qing Emperor, as an integral part of the state. This is referred to as &quot;Mongolia Area&quot; to distinguish it from Outer Mongolia. Most of Outer Mongolia, however, was under the &quot;de facto&quot; control of the Bogd Khanate, which was largely unrecognized internationally. The Republic of China briefly established &quot;de facto&quot; rule over most of the region from 1919 to 1921. After the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic was founded in 1924, the Nationalist government of China &quot;de jure&quot; recognized Mongolian independence in 1946 under Soviet pressure, though this recognition was later rescinded by the Kuomintang government in 1953, which had retreated to Taiwan because of continued Soviet support to the Chinese communists. The People&#x27;s Republic of China continued recognition of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic since 1949, and has established full diplomatic relations with Mongolia.

== Names ==
The name &quot;Outer Mongolia&quot; is contrasted with Inner Mongolia, which corresponds to the region of Inner Mongolia in China. Inner Mongolia was given its name because it was more directly administered by the Qing court; Outer Mongolia (which is further from the capital Beijing) had a greater degree of autonomy within the Qing empire.

There are three alternate terms, including Ar Mongol, Mobei Mongol, and Outer Mongolia.

=== Ar Mongol ===
The term &quot;Ar mongol&quot; or &quot;Mobei Mongol&quot; () is sometimes used in Chinese and Mongolian languages to refer to North Mongolia when making a distinction with South Mongolia, so as to elide the history of Qing rule and rather imply a geographic unity or distinction of regions inhabited by Mongols in the Mongolian Plateau. There also exists an English term: &quot;Northern Mongolia&quot;.

Ar Mongol can also be used to refer to Mongolia synchronically, during that time period. In the Mongolian language, the word &quot;ar&quot; refers to the back side of something, which has been extended to mean the northern side of any spatial entity, e.g. a mountain or a yurt. The word &quot;öbür&quot; refers to the front/south (and thus protected) side of a mountain. So the difference between South Mongolia and the Mongolian state is conceived as the metaphor of the backward northern side and the south side of a mountain.

In contrast to Mobei Mongol (), there is also Monan Mongol (), roughly referring to the region now known as South Mongolia.

== Modern usage ==
Today, &quot;Outer Mongolia&quot; is sometimes still informally used to refer to the independent state of Mongolia. To avoid confusion between Mongolia and China&#x27;s Inner Mongolia, Chinese sources generally refer to the former as the &quot;State of Mongolia&quot; (); that is, the translation of the official name in Mongolian, /, instead of just &quot;Mongolia&quot; (), which could refer to the entire Mongolian region.

&quot;Outer Mongolia&quot; is also used sometimes used colloquially in the English language as a hyperbole to refer to a place that is very far away.
