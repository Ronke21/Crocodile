<text>In modern Hebrew and Yiddish, (; , pl: , or ) is a term for a gentile, a non-Jew. Through Yiddish, the word has been adopted into English (pl: goyim or goys) also to mean &quot;gentile&quot;, sometimes in a pejorative sense. 

The Biblical Hebrew word &quot;goy&quot; has been commonly translated into English as &quot;nation&quot;, meaning a group of persons of the same ethnic family who speak the same language (rather than the more common modern meaning of a political unit). In the Bible, &quot;goy&quot; is used to describe both the Nation of Israel and other nations. As a word principally used by Jews to describe non-Jews, it is a term for the ethnic out-group.

The meaning of the word &quot;goy&quot; in Hebrew evolved to mean &quot;non-Jew&quot; in the Hellenistic (300 BCE to 30 BCE) and Roman periods, as both Rabbinical texts and then Christian theology placed increasing emphasis on a binary division between Jews and non-Jews. 

In modern usage in English, the extent to which &quot;goy&quot; is derogatory is a point of discussion in the Jewish community.

The word &quot;goy&quot; is sometimes used by white supremacists to refer to themselves when signaling a belief in conspiracy theories about Jews.

== Hebrew Bible==
The word means &quot;nation&quot; in Biblical Hebrew. In the Torah, and its variants appear 560 times in reference to both the Israelites and the non-Israelite nations.

The first recorded usage of &quot;goyim&quot; occurs in and applies to non-Israelite nations. The first mention of &quot;goy&quot; in relation to the Israelites comes in , when God promises Abraham that his descendants will form a (&quot;great nation&quot;).

There are two exceptions where a “Kingdom of Goyim” is mentioned. One is in , where it states that the &quot;King of Goyim&quot; was Tidal. Bible commentaries suggest that the term may refer to Gutium. The other is in , where a “King of Goyim in Gilgal” is included in the list of kings slain by Joshua. In all other cases the meaning of is &#x27;nations.&#x27; 

In , the Israelites are referred to as a , a &quot;holy nation&quot;. One of the more poetic descriptions of the chosen people in the Hebrew Bible, and popular among Jewish scholars is , or &quot;a unique nation upon the earth&quot; ( and )

===Translations of &#x27;goy&#x27; in English-language Christian Bibles===
In English language Christian bibles, &quot;nation&quot; has been used as the principal translation for &quot;goy&quot; in the Hebrew Bible, from the earliest English language bibles such as the 1530 Tyndale Bible and the 1611 King James Version.

The King James Version of the Bible translates the word / as &quot;nation&quot; 374 times, &quot;heathen&quot; 143 times, &quot;Gentile&quot; 30 times (see &quot;Evolution of the Term&quot; below) and &quot;people&quot; 11 times. The New American Standard Bible translation uses the following words: &quot;every nation&quot; (2 times) Gentiles (1) Goiim (1), Harosheth-hagoyim* (3), herds (1), nation (120), nations (425), people (4).

== Evolution of the term ==
While the books of the Hebrew Bible often use to describe the Israelites, the later Jewish writings of the Hellenistic Period (from approximately 300 BCE to 30 BCE) tended to apply the term to other nations.

Goy acquired the meaning of someone who is not Jewish in the first and second century CE. Before that time, academics 
Adi Ophir and Ishay Rosen-Zvi have argued, no crystallized dichotomy between Jew and non-Jew existed in Judaism. Ophir and Rosen-Zvi state that the early Jewish convert to Christianity, Paul, was key in developing the concept of &quot;goy&quot; to mean non-Jew:

The Latin words gentes/gentilis – which also referred to peoples or nations – began to be used to describe non-Jews in parallel with the evolution of the word in Hebrew. Based on the Latin model, the English word &quot;gentile&quot; came to mean non-Jew from the time of the first English-language Bible translations in the 1500s (see Gentile).

The twelfth century Jewish scholar Maimonides defines &quot;goy&quot; in his Mishneh Torah as a worshipper of idolatry, as he explains, &quot;Whenever we refer to a gentile [goy] without any further description, we mean one who worships false deities&quot;. Maimonides saw Christians as idolators (because of concepts like the Trinity) but not Muslims who he saw as more strictly monotheistic.

== As a pejorative ==

Goy can be used in a derogatory manner. The Yiddish lexicographer Leo Rosten in &quot;The New Joys of Yiddish&quot; defines goy as someone who is non-Jewish or someone who is dull, insensitive, or heartless. Goy also occurs in many pejorative Yiddish expressions:

* ()Something only a goy would do or is capable of doing.
* ()&quot;A goy stays a goy,&quot; or, less literally, according to Rosten, &quot;What did you expect? Once an anti-Semite always an anti-Semite.&quot;
* ()&quot;Gentile head,&quot; someone who doesn&#x27;t think ahead, an idiot.
* ()Pleasures or pursuits only a gentile would enjoy.
* ()Exclamation of exasperation used &quot;when endurance is exhausted, kindliness depleted, the effort to understand useless&quot;.

Several authors have opined on whether the word is derogatory. Dan Friedman, executive director of &quot;The Forward&quot; in &quot;What &#x27;Goy&#x27; Means, And Why I Keep Using It&quot; writes that it can be used as an insult but that the word is not offensive. He compares it to the word &quot;foreigners&quot; which Americans can use dismissively but which isn&#x27;t a derogatory word. Similarly, Jews for Racial and Economic Justice (JFREJ) has stated that &quot;goy&quot; is &quot;Not an insult, just kinda sounds like it.&quot;

Rebecca Einstein Schorr argues that the word has an established pejorative overtone. She refers to the observation &quot;the &quot;goyishe&quot; groomsmen were all drunk and bawdy; of course, you&#x27;d never see that at a Jewish wedding&quot; and &quot;goyishe kop&quot; where the word is used in a pejorative sense. She admits that the word can have non-pejorative uses, such as &quot;goyishe restaurant&quot; - one that doesn&#x27;t serve kosher food - but contends that the word is &quot;neutral, at best, and extremely offensive, at worst.&quot; She advocates that the Jewish community stop using the word &quot;goy.&quot; Andrew Silow Carroll writes:

Nahma Nadich, deputy director of the Jewish Community Relations of Greater Boston writes:

== In antisemitism ==
According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, white supremacists have ironically used the term &quot;goy&quot; in reference to themselves as a signal of their belief in conspiracy theories about Jews. For example, a Hungarian antisemitic motorcycle association refers to themselves as the Goyim riders, and in 2020 Kyle Chapman tried to rename the far-right group the Proud Boys to the Proud Goys. 

In a similar vein, the far-right American Traditionalist Worker Party, in 2017, created the crowdfunding platform called GoyFundMe, a wordplay on the popular crowdfunding platform GoFundMe. 

The Goyim Defense League (GDL) and its website, GoyimTV, are another example. 

Europol&#x27;s 2021 report on &quot;Terrorism Situations and Trends&quot; discusses the German &quot;Goyim Partei Deutschland&quot; (&#x27;Goyim Party Germany&#x27;), &quot;a right-wing extremist organisation&quot; founded in 2016 which &quot;used its website to publish antisemitic and racist texts, pictures and videos.&quot;

The slur is also featured in the far-right catchphrase or meme The Goyim Know, Shut It Down associated with Neo-Nazis on online forums like the 4chan and 8chan. In this context, the &quot;speaker&quot; assumes the role of a &quot;panicking Jew&quot; who reacts to an event that would reveal Jewish &quot;manipulations&quot; or Jewish &quot;deceitfulness&quot;.

According to the Anti-Defamation League, the antisemitic meme first appeared on 4chan in 2013. Einstein Schorr called the meme an instance of &quot;linguistic appropriation&quot; whereby Neo-Nazis cynically incorporated &quot;pseudo-Yiddish phrases&quot; into their vocabulary to ridicule Jews. Schorr describes that as a way to propagate the &quot;anti-Semitic myth that we are a cabal with our own secret language and agenda.&quot; 

The Anti-Defamation League further deciphers the catchphrase,

<text>Lester Raymond Brown (March 14, 1912 – January 4, 2001) was an American jazz musician who for over six decades (1938-2000) led his big band, later called Les Brown and His Band of Renown.

==Biography==
Brown was born in Reinerton, Pennsylvania. He enrolled in the Conway Military Band School (later part of Ithaca College) in 1926, studying with famous bandleader Patrick Conway for three years before receiving a music scholarship to the New York Military Academy, where he graduated in 1932. Brown attended college at Duke University from 1932 to 1936. There he led the group Les Brown and His Blue Devils, who performed regularly on Duke&#x27;s campus and up and down the east coast. Brown took the band on an extensive summer tour in 1936. At the end of the tour, while some of the band members returned to Duke to continue their education, others stayed on with Brown and continued to tour, becoming in 1938 the Les Brown Orchestra. The band&#x27;s original drummer, Don Kramer, became the acting manager and helped define their future. 

The band appeared regularly on the Spotlight Band radio programme, which broadcast to a military audience and made them permanent favorites of millions of men in uniform. Also on this show, the band was first referred to as &quot;Les Brown &amp; His Band of Renown&quot; in 1942. The moniker stuck and became the official bandname from the 1950s onwards.

In 1941, Brown&#x27;s band had a #1 hit, &quot;Joltin&#x27; Joe DiMagio&quot;, with his lead vocalist Betty Bonney. In 1942, Brown and his band concluded work on an RKO picture, &quot;Sweet and Hot&quot;; played at the Palladium Ballroom, Hollywood. A few years later, in 1945, this band brought Doris Day into prominence with their recording of &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot;. The song&#x27;s release coincided with the end of World War II in Europe and became an unofficial homecoming theme for many veterans. The band had nine other number-one hit songs, including &quot;I&#x27;ve Got My Love to Keep Me Warm&quot; (1949).

In 1952–53, Brown was the orchestra leader on Day&#x27;s radio program, &quot;The Doris Day Show&quot;, on CBS.

Les Brown and the Band of Renown performed with Bob Hope on radio, stage and television for almost fifty years. They did 18 USO Tours for American troops around the world, and entertained over three million people. Before the Super Bowls were televised, the Bob Hope Christmas Specials were the highest-rated programs in television history. Tony Bennett was &quot;discovered&quot; by Bob Hope and did his first public performance with Brown and the Band.

The first film that Brown and the band appeared in was &quot;Seven Days&#x27; Leave&quot; (1942) starring Victor Mature and Lucille Ball. &quot;Rock-A-Billy Baby&quot;, a low-budget 1957 film, was the Band of Renown&#x27;s second, and in 1963 they appeared in the Jerry Lewis&#x27; comedy &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; playing their theme song &quot;Leap Frog&quot;.

Brown and the Band were also the house band for The Steve Allen Show (1959–1961) and the Dean Martin Show (1965–1972). Brown and the band performed with virtually every major performer of their time, including Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and Nat King Cole. The annual Les Brown Big Band Festival, started March 2006 in Les&#x27; hometown, features area big bands preserving the songs of the big band era. At the 2012 festival celebrating the 100th birthday anniversary, the town of Reinerton renamed the street near Les&#x27; birthplace to Les Brown Lane. In 2013 his hometown of Reinerton, PA adopted as the town&#x27;s official slogan: Reinerton: The Town of Renown in honor of Les and his band.

Les Brown Sr. died of lung cancer in 2001, and was interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, California. He was survived by his wife Evelyn, son Les Jr., and daughter Denise. He was 88 years old at the time of his death.

His grandson, Jeff &quot;Swampy&quot; Marsh, co-created the Disney Channel animated series &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; and &quot;Milo Murphy&#x27;s Law&quot;.

Brown was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2010.

===Les Brown Jr.===
In 2001, Les Brown Jr. (1940–2023), became the full-time leader of the Band of Renown. It performed throughout the world and had a regular big band show in Branson, Missouri. Brown Jr. also hosted a national radio show on the Music of Your Life network. Brown Jr. was a television actor in the 1960s (&quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;General Hospital&quot;, &quot;The Baileys of Balboa&quot;, &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;), a rock musician and producer who worked with Carlos Santana, and a concert promoter for many country music artists including Merle Haggard and Loretta Lynn. In 2004, Brown Jr. received the &quot;Ambassador of Patriotism&quot; award from the POW Network. Brown Jr. died from cancer at his home in Branson, Missouri, on January 9, 2023, at the age of 82.

<text>Melissa Gaboriau Auf der Maur (; born March 17, 1972) is a Canadian musician.

Auf der Maur began performing in 1993 after forming the indie rock band Tinker while she was a student at Concordia University. She was recruited as the bassist for the American alternative rock band Hole in the summer of 1994 and is included on several Hole releases, including the album &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; (1998). Following her departure from Hole in 1999, Auf der Maur briefly joined The Smashing Pumpkins as a touring member for its 2000 tour and began her solo career; her debut studio album &quot;Auf der Maur&quot; was released in 2004 on Capitol Records and &quot;Out of Our Minds&quot;, her second studio album, was released in 2010 on her own independent record label, PHI–MAdM Music. She has also collaborated with Indochine, Rufus Wainwright, Ric Ocasek and Neverending White Lights.

Auf der Maur is also a photographer and occasional actress. Her photographs have been included in &quot;National Geographic&quot; and exhibited at Sotheby&#x27;s. She has acted in &quot;How to Make the Cruelest Month&quot; (1998), &quot;Beyond Borders&quot; (2003) and &quot;Collaborator&quot; (2011). As part of her 2009 multidisciplinary project &quot;Out of Our Minds&quot;—which produced an album, a single, a film and a comic book—Auf der Maur acted as a film and record producer, working alongside her husband, filmmaker Tony Stone. Stone and Auf der Maur are the creative directors and owners of Basilica Hudson, an arts and performance center in Hudson, New York.

VH1 placed Auf der Maur at number 68 on its list of 100 Greatest Women of Rock &amp; Roll in 2007 and her solo albums have received favorable reviews.

==Early life==
Auf der Maur was born in Montreal, Quebec, to journalist and politician Nick Auf der Maur and journalist and literary translator Linda Gaboriau. Auf der Maur&#x27;s father&#x27;s family was Swiss-German and her mother&#x27;s was mixed European-American. Gaboriau was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in the United States. As a result, she holds dual Canadian–American citizenship. Auf der Maur&#x27;s surname translates to English as &quot;on the wall&quot;, as &quot;maur&quot; was derived from the German word for &quot;wall&quot; (&quot;die Mauer&quot;). She has stated that her grandmother, Theresia Schaelin-Auf der Maur, was &quot;always pounding my heritage down my throat—reminding me that I&#x27;m the last one in North America to further the name&quot;.

Auf der Maur did not meet her father until she was three years old. Gaboriau called Nick Auf der Maur after her daughter began questioning her about her father&#x27;s identity. Reflecting on the encounter, Auf der Maur said &quot;[my father] realised my mother Linda was the love of his life because she&#x27;d offered the gift of this child without any demands. He fell madly in love with her [and] pursued her for two years&quot;. Auf der Maur and Gaboriau married in 1978 when Melissa was six years old. The couple divorced in 1979 after which Auf der Maur traveled worldwide with her mother. A portion of Auf der Maur&#x27;s childhood was spent living in &quot;a circus caravan in Wales, a red post-office box truck in Morocco, and a hut in Kenya&quot; with her mother. During her time in Kenya, she contracted three bouts of malaria and returned to Montreal.

In Montreal, Auf der Maur attended the Fine Arts Core Education (FACE) School and Moving in New Directions (MIND) High School—both of which are schools of alternative education. At FACE, she was a member of the classical choir and at MIND, she was &quot;part of the small English elite&quot;, where she formed friendships with Leonard Cohen″s daughter Lorca and Rufus Wainwright. At school, she became interested in photography and subsequently attended Concordia University, from which she majored in photography in 1994. At Concordia at age 19, Auf der Maur began working part-time as a DJ at Bifteck, a well-known rock club, where she met several musicians including Steve Durand.

==Music career==

===1993–1994: Tinker===

During her time as a DJ at Bifteck, Auf der Maur met fellow Concordia University student Steve Durand, with whom she formed Tinker in November 1993. Durand assumed guitar duties and Auf der Maur began playing bass, using a Fender Precision Bass that her father had purchased for her 21st birthday. The duo recruited a second guitarist, Jordon Zadorozny, and a drummer and began performing at Montreal venues.

At a Smashing Pumpkins performance at Les Foufounes Électriques in 1991, Auf der Maur had become friends with vocalist and guitarist Billy Corgan. During the performance, Auf der Maur&#x27;s roommate heckled the band between songs and threw a beer bottle onstage while the band was performing, leading to &quot;a strangling fist fight&quot; between him and Corgan. Auf der Maur explained:

Auf der Maur and Corgan became pen pals. Following months of no contact, Auf der Maur sent a letter to Corgan requesting that Tinker open for The Smashing Pumpkins during their next tour date in Montreal. Corgan accepted her request and Tinker performed the largest show of their career, to 2,500 people, opening for The Smashing Pumpkins at Métropolis on November 30, 1993. Corgan, Auf der Maur recalled, &quot;patted me on the back. He said, &#x27;You&#x27;re a really good bass player. You&#x27;re going to be in my band one day.&#x27; It felt like a dream come true – exactly the kind of confidence boost I needed.&quot;

Tinker released two 7-inch singles, &quot;Realalie&quot; and &quot;Green Machine&quot;, on the independent record label Bear Records in 1994. The group continued to release music until 1996, when Auf der Maur accepted Courtney Love″s invitation to become the bassist for the alternative rock band Hole, a job she initially declined:

===1994–1999: Hole===

In summer 1994, Hole was in need of a new bassist after the death of Kristen Pfaff. Of her original decision to decline Love&#x27;s offer to join, Auf der Maur recollected: &quot;I said no because it seemed like a very sad scenario to be going into ... it just seemed like a very sad place&quot;, citing Pfaff&#x27;s death a &quot;red flag&quot; and a reason to not join the band. Upon meeting Love and drummer Patty Schemel, Auf der Maur said she got &quot;a flash of destiny in her eyes&quot; and accepted the offer. She completed her Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) at Concordia and was recruited as the bassist for Hole two weeks prior to its performance at the 1994 Reading Festival. &quot;Lou Barlow and Evan Dando were watching from the side of the stage,&quot; she recalled. &quot;I probably didn&#x27;t even move. I just thought, &#x27;As long as I get these parts right, it&#x27;ll be just fine.&#x27;&quot;

From 1994 to 1995, Auf der Maur toured worldwide with Hole in support of its second studio album, &quot;Live Through This&quot; (1994). On the tour, Auf der Maur was described by guitarist Eric Erlandson as &quot;bringing sunshine to the band&quot; during the &quot;dark and grey&quot; atmosphere of the tour, which was problematic due to the band&#x27;s recent bereavements—notably the death of Pfaff and Love&#x27;s husband Kurt Cobain—as well as Love&#x27;s drug addiction. Auf der Maur befriended Patty Schemel and rented a house with her following the two-year-long tour. The duo began a side project, Constant Comment, and released a split 7-inch single with Red Aunts on Sympathy for the Record Industry featuring the song &quot;Firecrasher&quot;. Auf der Maur has since said her friendship and musical compatibility between her and Schemel was based on a &quot;redhead connection&quot;; Schemel has referred to Auf der Maur as her &quot;anchor&quot; during the period following the death of Pfaff and Cobain.
Auf der Maur was featured on various Hole releases, including the 1996 non-album single &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; and on various live tracks on &quot;My Body, the Hand Grenade&quot; (1997). She was featured on the band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; (1998), performing bass and co-composing five of the 12 songs. &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; was a major critical and commercial success; it charted at number 9 in the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart and number 3 in the Canadian Albums Chart, as well its lead single and title track peaking at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. It has since been certified platinum in both the U.S. and Canada. Following the tour in support of its release, Auf der Maur left Hole in October 1999 as her five-year contract with the band ended and she wished &quot;to grow in many different directions&quot;.

In June 2009, &quot;NME&quot; reported that Hole was reforming. Love claimed that Auf der Maur was rejoining as bassist to record on her upcoming album &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Daughter&quot;—which was being rebranded as a Hole album—and performing on the supporting tour. Auf der Maur stated that she was &quot;surprised and disappointed&quot; by the announcement and had no intention of partaking in the reformed band. Despite several legal issues, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was released as Hole&#x27;s fourth studio album in April 2010 with Shawn Dailey replacing Auf der Maur as bassist.

Hole reunited again—with the &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; line-up of Love, Erlandson, Auf der Maur and Schemel—for a one-off performance at Public Assembly in Brooklyn, New York on April 12, 2012 at an after-party for Schemel&#x27;s film &quot;Hit So Hard&quot; (2011). Originally Auf der Maur, Erlandson and Schemel were performing as a trio until Love arrived for a spontaneous performance of &quot;Miss World&quot; and &quot;Over the Edge&quot;. &quot;The Quietus&quot; reported in April 2014 that the four members had reunited although in subsequent interviews, Love downplayed talk of an imminent reunion. In April 2016, Auf der Maur stated in an interview that she no longer had time or energy for a full-fledged reunion, but would be interested in wrapping up the Hole legacy with a retrospective disc and small set of tour dates.

===1999–2000: The Smashing Pumpkins===

Original Smashing Pumpkins bassist D&#x27;arcy Wretzky left the band in September 1999 during the recording of the band&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Machina/The Machines of God&quot; (2000). In October 1999, Auf der Maur was recruited as her replacement by Billy Corgan, with whom she was still friends from her time in Tinker and Hole. &quot;Courtney knew I was leaving to make my solo project,&quot; she explained. &quot;But then, coincidentally, the week that I left Hole was the week D&#x27;arcy left the Pumpkins. So, within a week, Billy called me and said, &#x27;The stars have aligned: it&#x27;s time for you to join &quot;my&quot; band.&#x27; I &quot;had&quot; to do it.&quot;

Auf der Maur was featured on neither &quot;Machina/The Machines of God&quot; nor &quot;Machina II/The Friends &amp; Enemies of Modern Music&quot; (2000) as Wretzky&#x27;s remaining bass duties were assumed by Corgan during recording sessions, but she played with the Pumpkins during the &quot;Machina&quot; tour from December 1999 to December 2000. The tour covered North America, Japan, Europe and South Africa and was described by Auf der Maur as &quot;very ambitious&quot;. Reflecting on the tour, she said: &quot;they would always be changing arrangements and keys of songs. The work ethic of the Pumpkins is so full-on and so demanding ... joining [the band] was just intense work, much more about work than about emotional experience&quot;. She performed at various shows, including the band&#x27;s final television performance on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and the band&#x27;s final show at the Cabaret Metro in Chicago on December 2, 2000, as well as appearing in the band&#x27;s music videos. Smashing Pumpkins broke up at the end of the year 2000.

In February 2006, MTV reported that Corgan and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin had signed a new management deal with Azoff Management, with a spokesperson confirming they had signed under The Smashing Pumpkins moniker. In response, Auf der Maur said in a separate interview that &quot;as long as Billy has Jimmy, he can make the essential Pumpkins record, I&#x27;m sure&quot; and when asked of her involvement said she was not planning on participating in the reunion but noted that her &quot;services are always there to play [her] favorite songs. If D&#x27;arcy is not available, I&#x27;m always happy to be second in line&quot;. Despite her earlier interest and Wretzky&#x27;s absence, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported in April 2007 that Auf der Maur confirmed she would not be rejoining The Smashing Pumpkins.

===2002–2003: The Chelsea and Hand of Doom===

In 2002, Auf der Maur formed a brief project with former Hole drummer Samantha Maloney, Peaches, Paz Lenchantin and Radio Sloan. Adopting the title The Chelsea—named after the Chelsea Hotel in New York where Auf der Maur had lived for a number of years—the band performed one show at Spaceland in Los Angeles, California in February that included original songs and cover versions. Featuring a cover version of Devo″s &quot;Gates of Steel&quot; and early renditions of songs Auf der Maur would feature on her debut studio album, the show was poorly received due to its &quot;seeming lack of preparation&quot; and &quot;was little more than pleasantly mopey and blurry garage rock&quot; according to a Variety review. Courtney Love subsequently named her backing band The Chelsea, also hiring Maloney and Sloan in the process, while touring for her debut studio album, &quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; (2004).

Later the same year, Auf der Maur formed Hand of Doom, a Black Sabbath cover band in which she performed lead vocals. The band included bassist Molly Stern, drummer Pedro Yanowitz, turntablist Joey Garfield and guitarist Guy Stevens. In March, the band began performing a select number of shows at established venues in Los Angeles including the Whisky a Go Go, The Troubador and The Viper Room, and released a live album, &quot;Live in Los Angeles&quot; (2002), consisting of recordings from various performances. The album received warm reviews, with AllMusic writer Bradley Torreano describing it as a &quot;fun, groovy, and strangely sensual&quot; record that &quot;finds the soul behind all the years of posturing&quot;, adding that &quot;it is Auf der Maur herself who is the very key to the album&quot;. Dubbing itself as &quot;art-karaoke&quot;, Hand of Doom performed further dates in North America during summer 2002 before disbanding in 2003.

===2004–2010: Solo career===
Returning to Montreal in 2001 after the disbandment of The Smashing Pumpkins, Auf der Maur was unsure about whether or not to continue her music career. In an interview with &quot;Jam!&quot;, she said that her &quot;relationship to music had become very army-oriented. I was a soldier, a hard worker who never got enough satisfaction from the music. I didn&#x27;t know if I was going to make my own record&quot;. In late 2001, upon discovering old demo recordings in her home, Auf der Maur decided to pursue a solo career after she had &quot;realized [she] had an entire album&#x27;s worth of material that had been sitting there for years&quot;.

Recorded from 2001 to 2003 at various studios in the U.S. and Canada, Auf der Maur&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Auf der Maur&quot; was released in February 2004 on Capitol Records. Produced with Chris Goss, Auf der Maur financed the recording sessions herself as she was not signed to a record label at the time of recording and during post-production, her budget ran out and she was unable to mix the album. She accepted a recording contract from Capitol soon afterwards and released &quot;Auf der Maur&quot; to &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;, according to Metacritic. The album&#x27;s supporting singles—&quot;Followed the Waves&quot;, &quot;Real a Lie&quot; and &quot;Taste You&quot;—were moderate successes in the United Kingdom, charting in the Top 40 of the UK Single Charts. As of 2010, &quot;Auf der Maur&quot; sold 200,000 copies worldwide.

In a 2007 interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, Auf der Maur announced that she had finished recording her second studio album which would be released as part of a multidisciplinary project including a concept film, an album, and a graphic novel to be released in fall 2009. An official website containing teasers of the project, as well as a film trailer, was launched in August 2007 and featured a regular blog updated by Auf der Maur documenting the various stages of the project. Following disputes with Capitol and getting &quot;caught up in some red tape&quot; that delayed the release of the project, Auf der Maur left the label to secure creative control and release her music on &quot;[her] own terms&quot;.

An EP titled &quot;... This Would Be Paradise&quot; was released in November 2008 as a 7-inch and digital download on iTunes. The three-track EP was released on Urbanited Music, an independent record label based in the Netherlands and was released under Auf der Maur&#x27;s abbreviated name MAdM, which she used for all succeeding releases. A short six-date tour of Canada and northern Europe followed the release of the EP, which featured her first live performances since the 151-date tour in support of &quot;Auf der Maur&quot; in 2004 and 2005.

In late 2009, Auf der Maur released a single, &quot;Out of Our Minds&quot;, and an EP, &quot;OOOM&quot;. The single was issued as a free download on her official website; both the single and the EP were self-released on PHI–MAdM Music Inc., her own record label, a division of the Montreal-based PHI Centre Group. Auf der Maur also signed an international distribution deal with Roadrunner Records, who issued the releases outside of North America. Her second studio album, also titled &quot;Out of Our Minds&quot;, was released in March 2010 as part of the &quot;OOOM&quot; project. Despite charting in France, Greece, Spain and the UK, the album received mixed reviews. However, in January 2011 &quot;Out of Our Minds&quot; won the Best Indie/Alternative/Hard Rock Album at the Independent Music Awards. In Autumn 2011, Auf der Maur went on maternity leave.

===Other collaborations===
Auf der Maur briefly toured with former The Cars frontman Ric Ocasek in 1997, after contributing bass and background vocals to his 1997 solo album &quot;Troublizing&quot;. She collaborated with French group Indochine on their song &quot;Le Grand Secret&quot;, singing a duet in French with Nicola Sirkis, to great acclaim in France. Auf der Maur joined the band on stage to perform the song on various occasions and appeared in the music video for the song. She performed a rare, short, acoustic set of some of her solo songs during an Indochine show in Paris, February 22, 2002. Auf der Maur has contributed bass and backing vocals to childhood friend Rufus Wainwright&#x27;s album &quot;Poses&quot; and appears in his 1998 video for &quot;April Fools&quot;. In 2008, she collaborated with Canadian musician Daniel Victor on his music collaboration project Neverending White Lights. They recorded the song &quot;The World is Darker&quot;, for which a video was released in March 2008. Aside from this, she has contributed to albums by artists such as Ryan Adams, Ben Lee, Idaho, The Stills and Fountains of Wayne.

In 2007, Auf der Maur appeared on the Fountains of Wayne album &quot;Traffic and Weather&quot; singing backing on the track &quot;Someone to Love&quot;.

==Photography==
Auf der Maur was a photography major specializing in self-portraiture at Concordia University when she was invited to join Hole in 1994. Her photos have been published in &quot;Nylon&quot;, &quot;Bust&quot;, &quot;Mastermind&quot;, National Geographic, &quot;American Photo&quot;, and the newly revitalized Creem, among other magazines. Her photos were also in the exhibition &quot;The Kids are Alright&quot; at Sotheby&#x27;s in New York City along with photos by Yelena Yemchuk.

She put together a solo exhibition in 2001, under the name of &quot;Channels&quot;, mostly featuring shots of Auf der Maur&#x27;s life on the road, with a recurring TV theme and shots of hotel TV screens, hence the name &quot;Channels.&quot; The exhibition opened September 9, 2001, at Brooklyn&#x27;s Secret Gallery, but was shut down after the September 11 attacks. It was shown again at O Patro Vys, Montreal, in May 2006.

==&quot;The Greatest Canadian&quot; advocate==
In 2004, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation produced a television series called &quot;The Greatest Canadian&quot; which saw 100 Canadian figures nominated for the title of &quot;the Greatest Canadian&quot;. The list of 100 was narrowed to a group of 10 finalists and a program dedicated to relating the story of, and case for, each nominee was aired on the network.

<text>Disinformation is misleading content deliberately spread to deceive people, or to secure economic or political gain and which may cause public harm. Disinformation is an orchestrated adversarial activity in which actors employ strategic deceptions and media manipulation tactics to advance political, military, or commercial goals. Disinformation is implemented through attacks that &quot;weaponize multiple rhetorical strategies and forms of knowing—including not only falsehoods but also truths, half-truths, and value judgements—to exploit and amplify culture wars and other identity-driven controversies.&quot; 

In contrast, &quot;misinformation&quot; refers to inaccuracies that stem from inadvertent error. Misinformation can be used to create disinformation when known misinformation is purposefully and intentionally disseminated. &quot;Fake news&quot; has sometimes been categorized as a type of disinformation, but scholars have advised not using these two terms interchangeably or using &quot;fake news&quot; altogether in academic writing since politicians have weaponized it to describe any unfavorable news coverage or information.

==Etymology==

The English word comes from the application of the Latin prefix to making the meaning &quot;reversal or removal of information&quot;. The rarely used word had appeared with this usage in print at least as far back as 1887.

Some consider it a loan translation of the Russian , transliterated as , apparently derived from the title of a KGB black propaganda department. Soviet planners in the 1950s defined disinformation as &quot;dissemination (in
the press, on the radio, etc.) of false reports intended to mislead public opinion.&quot;

&quot;Disinformation&quot; first made an appearance in dictionaries in 1985, specifically, &quot;Webster&#x27;s New College Dictionary&quot; and the &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot;. In 1986, the term &quot;disinformation&quot; was not defined in &quot;Webster&#x27;s New World Thesaurus&quot; or &quot;New Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. After the Soviet term became widely known in the 1980s, native speakers of English broadened the term as &quot;any government communication (either overt or covert) containing intentionally false and misleading material, often combined selectively with true information, which seeks to mislead and manipulate either elites or a mass audience.&quot;

By 1990, use of the term &quot;disinformation&quot; had fully established itself in the English language within the lexicon of politics. By 2001, the term &quot;disinformation&quot; had come to be known as simply a more civil phrase for saying someone was lying. Stanley B. Cunningham wrote in his 2002 book &quot;The Idea of Propaganda&quot; that &quot;disinformation&quot; had become pervasively used as a synonym for propaganda.

==Operationalization==
The Shorenstein Center at Harvard University defines disinformation research as an academic field that studies &quot;the spread and impacts of misinformation, disinformation, and media manipulation,&quot; including &quot;how it spreads through online and offline channels, and why people are susceptible to believing bad information, and successful strategies for mitigating its impact&quot;. According to a 2023 research article published in New Media &amp; Society, disinformation circulates on social media through deception campaigns implemented in multiple ways including: astroturfing, conspiracy theories, clickbait, culture wars, echo chambers, hoaxes, fake news, propaganda, pseudoscience, and rumors.
In order to distinguish between similar terms, including misinformation and malinformation, scholars collectively agree on the definitions for each term as follows: (1) disinformation is the strategic dissemination of false information with the intention to cause public harm; (2) misinformation represents the unintentional spread of false information; and (3) malinformation is factual information disseminated with the intention to cause harm, these terms are abbreviated &#x27;DMMI&#x27;.

In 2019, Camille François devised the &quot;ABC&quot; framework of understanding different modalities of online disinformation:
* Manipulative &quot;Actors&quot;, who &quot;engage knowingly and with clear intent in viral deception campaigns&quot; that are &quot;covert, designed to obfuscate the identity and intent of the actor orchestrating them.&quot; Examples include personas such as Guccifer 2.0, Internet trolls, state media, and military operatives.
* Deceptive &quot;Behavior&quot;, which &quot;encompasses the variety of techniques viral deception actors may use to enhance and exaggerate the reach, virality and impact of their campaigns.&quot; Examples include troll farms, Internet bots, astroturfing, and &quot;paid engagement&quot;.
* Harmful &quot;Content&quot;, which includes health misinformation, manipulated media such as deepfakes, online harassment, violent extremism, hate speech or terrorism.

In 2020, the Brookings Institution proposed amending this framework to include &quot;Distribution&quot;, defined by the &quot;technical protocols that enable, constrain, and shape user behavior in a virtual space&quot;. Similarly, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace proposed adding &quot;Degree&quot; (&quot;distribution of the content ... and the audiences it reaches&quot;) and &quot;Effect&quot; (&quot;how much of a threat a given case poses&quot;).

===Comparisons with propaganda===
Whether and to what degree disinformation and propaganda overlap is subject to debate. Some (like U.S. Department of State) define propaganda as the use of non-rational arguments to either advance or undermine a political ideal, and use disinformation as an alternative name for undermining propaganda. While others consider them to be separate concepts altogether. One popular distinction holds that disinformation also describes politically motivated messaging designed explicitly to engender public cynicism, uncertainty, apathy, distrust, and paranoia, all of which disincentivize citizen engagement and mobilization for social or political change.

==Practice==
Disinformation is the label often given to foreign information manipulation and interference (FIMI). Studies on disinformation are often concerned with the content of activity whereas the broader concept of FIMI is more concerned with the &quot;behaviour of an actor&quot; that is described through the military doctrine concept of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

Disinformation is primarily carried out by government intelligence agencies, but has also been used by non-governmental organizations and businesses. Front groups are a form of disinformation, as they mislead the public about their true objectives and who their controllers are. Most recently, disinformation has been deliberately spread through social media in the form of &quot;fake news&quot;, disinformation masked as legitimate news articles and meant to mislead readers or viewers. Disinformation may include distribution of forged documents, manuscripts, and photographs, or spreading dangerous rumours and fabricated intelligence. Use of these tactics can lead to blowback, however, causing such unintended consequences such as defamation lawsuits or damage to the dis-informer&#x27;s reputation.

==Worldwide==
===Soviet disinformation===
===Russian disinformation===
=== Chinese disinformation ===
===American disinformation===

The United States Intelligence Community appropriated use of the term &quot;disinformation&quot; in the 1950s from the Russian &quot;dezinformatsiya&quot;, and began to use similar strategies during the Cold War and in conflict with other nations. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 2000 that during the CIA&#x27;s effort to substitute Mohammed Reza Pahlavi for then-Prime Minister of Iran Mohammad Mossadegh, the CIA placed fictitious stories in the local newspaper. Reuters documented how, subsequent to the 1979 Soviet Union invasion of Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War, the CIA put false articles in newspapers of Islamic-majority countries, inaccurately stating that Soviet embassies had &quot;invasion day celebrations&quot;. Reuters noted a former U.S. intelligence officer said they would attempt to gain the confidence of reporters and use them as secret agents, to affect a nation&#x27;s politics by way of their local media.

In October 1986, the term gained increased currency in the U.S. when it was revealed that two months previously, the Reagan Administration had engaged in a disinformation campaign against then-leader of Libya, Muammar Gaddafi. White House representative Larry Speakes said reports of a planned attack on Libya as first broken by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; on August 25, 1986, were &quot;authoritative&quot;, and other newspapers including &quot;The Washington Post&quot; then wrote articles saying this was factual. U.S. State Department representative Bernard Kalb resigned from his position in protest over the disinformation campaign, and said: &quot;Faith in the word of America is the pulse beat of our democracy.&quot;

The executive branch of the Reagan administration kept watch on disinformation campaigns through three yearly publications by the Department of State: &quot;Active Measures: A Report on the Substance and Process of Anti-U.S. Disinformation and Propaganda Campaigns&quot; (1986); &quot;Report on Active Measures and Propaganda, 1986–87&quot; (1987); and &quot;Report on Active Measures and Propaganda, 1987–88&quot; (1989).

According to a report by Reuters, the United States ran a propaganda campaign to spread disinformation about the Sinovac Chinese COVID-19 vaccine, including using fake social media accounts to spread the disinformation that the Sinovac vaccine contained pork-derived ingredients and was therefore &quot;haram&quot; under Islamic law. Reuters said the ChinaAngVirus disinformation campaign was designed to &quot;counter what it perceived as China&#x27;s growing influence in the Philippines&quot; and was prompted by the &quot;[fear] that China&#x27;s COVID diplomacy and propaganda could draw other Southeast Asian countries, such as Cambodia and Malaysia, closer to Beijing&quot;. The campaign was also described as &quot;payback for Beijing&#x27;s efforts to blame Washington for the pandemic&quot;. The campaign primarily targeted people in the Philippines and used a social media hashtag for &quot;China is the virus&quot; in Tagalog. The campaign ran from 2020 to mid-2021. The primary contractor for the U.S. military on the project was General Dynamics IT, which received $493 million for its role.

== Response ==

=== Responses from cultural leaders ===
Pope Francis condemned disinformation in a 2016 interview, after being made the subject of a fake news website during the 2016 U.S. election cycle which falsely claimed that he supported Donald Trump. He stated that the worst thing the news media could do was spread disinformation and said the act was a sin, comparing those who spread disinformation to individuals who engage in coprophilia.

=== Ethics in warfare ===
In a contribution to the 2014 book &quot;Military Ethics and Emerging Technologies&quot;, writers David Danks and Joseph H. Danks discuss the ethical implications in using disinformation as a tactic during information warfare. They note there has been a significant degree of philosophical debate over the issue as related to the ethics of war and use of the technique. The writers describe a position whereby the use of disinformation is occasionally allowed, but not in all situations. Typically the ethical test to consider is whether the disinformation was performed out of a motivation of good faith and acceptable according to the rules of war. By this test, the tactic during World War II of putting fake inflatable tanks in visible locations on the Pacific Islands in order to falsely present the impression that there were larger military forces present would be considered as ethically permissible. Conversely, disguising a munitions plant as a healthcare facility in order to avoid attack would be outside the bounds of acceptable use of disinformation during war.

== Research ==

Research related to disinformation studies is increasing as an applied area of inquiry. The call to formally classify disinformation as a cybersecurity threat is made by advocates due to its increase in social networking sites. Despite the proliferation of social media websites, Facebook and Twitter showed the most activity in terms of active disinformation campaigns. Techniques reported on included the use of bots to amplify hate speech, the illegal harvesting of data, and paid trolls to harass and threaten journalists.

Whereas disinformation research focuses primarily on how actors orchestrate deceptions on social media, primarily via fake news, new research investigates how people take what started as deceptions and circulate them as their personal views. As a result, research shows that disinformation can be conceptualized as a program that encourages engagement in oppositional fantasies (i.e., culture wars), through which disinformation circulates as rhetorical ammunition for never-ending arguments. As disinformation entangles with culture wars, identity-driven controversies constitute a vehicle through which disinformation disseminates on social media. This means that disinformation thrives, not despite raucous grudges but because of them. The reason is that controversies provide fertile ground for never-ending debates that solidify points of view.

Scholars have pointed out that disinformation is not only a foreign threat as domestic purveyors of disinformation are also leveraging traditional media outlets such as newspapers, radio stations, and television news media to disseminate false information. Current research suggests right-wing online political activists in the United States may be more likely to use disinformation as a strategy and tactic. Governments have responded with a wide range of policies to address concerns about the potential threats that disinformation poses to democracy, however, there is little agreement in elite policy discourse or academic literature as to what it means for disinformation to threaten democracy, and how different policies might help to counter its negative implications.

=== Consequences of exposure to disinformation online ===
There is a broad consensus amongst scholars that there is a high degree of disinformation, misinformation, and propaganda online; however, it is unclear to what extent such disinformation has on political attitudes in the public and, therefore, political outcomes. This conventional wisdom has come mostly from investigative journalists, with a particular rise during the 2016 U.S. election: some of the earliest work came from Craig Silverman at Buzzfeed News. Cass Sunstein supported this in &quot;#Republic,&quot; arguing that the internet would become rife with echo chambers and informational cascades of misinformation leading to a highly polarized and ill-informed society.

Research after the 2016 election found: (1) for 14 percent of Americans social media was their &quot;most important&quot; source of election news; 2) known false news stories &quot;favoring Trump were shared a total of 30 million times on Facebook, while those favoring Clinton were shared 8 million times&quot;; 3) the average American adult saw fake news stories, &quot;with just over half of those who recalled seeing them believing them&quot;; and 4) people are more likely to &quot;believe stories that favor their preferred candidate, especially if they have ideologically segregated social media networks.&quot; Correspondingly, whilst there is wide agreement that the digital spread and uptake of disinformation during the 2016 election was massive and very likely facilitated by foreign agents, there is an ongoing debate on whether all this had any actual effect on the election. For example, a double blind randomized-control experiment by researchers from the London School of Economics (LSE), found that exposure to online fake news about either Trump or Clinton had no significant effect on intentions to vote for those candidates. Researchers who examined the influence of Russian disinformation on Twitter during the 2016 US presidential campaign found that exposure to disinformation was (1) concentrated among a tiny group of users, (2) primarily among Republicans, and (3) eclipsed by exposure to legitimate political news media and politicians. Finally, they find &quot;no evidence of a meaningful relationship between exposure to the Russian foreign influence campaign and changes in attitudes, polarization, or voting behavior.&quot; As such, despite its mass dissemination during the 2016 Presidential Elections, online fake news or disinformation probably did not cost Hillary Clinton the votes needed to secure the presidency.

Research on this topic remains inconclusive, for example, misinformation appears not to significantly change political knowledge of those exposed to it. There seems to be a higher level of diversity of news sources that users are exposed to on Facebook and Twitter than conventional wisdom would dictate, as well as a higher frequency of cross-spectrum discussion. Other evidence has found that disinformation campaigns rarely succeed in altering the foreign policies of the targeted states.

Research is also challenging because disinformation is meant to be difficult to detect and some social media companies have discouraged outside research efforts. For example, researchers found disinformation made &quot;existing detection algorithms from traditional news media ineffective or not applicable...[because disinformation] is intentionally written to mislead readers...[and] users&#x27; social engagements with fake news produce data that is big, incomplete, unstructured, and noisy.&quot; Facebook, the largest social media company, has been criticized by analytical journalists and scholars for preventing outside research of disinformation.

=== Alternative perspectives and critiques ===
Researchers have criticized the framing of disinformation as being limited to technology platforms, removed from its wider political context and inaccurately implying that the media landscape was otherwise well-functioning. &quot;The field possesses a simplistic understanding of the effects of media technologies; overemphasizes platforms and underemphasizes politics; focuses too much on the United States and Anglocentric analysis; has a shallow understanding of political culture and culture in general; lacks analysis of race, class, gender, and sexuality as well as status, inequality, social structure, and power; has a thin understanding of journalistic processes; and, has progressed more through the exigencies of grant funding than the development of theory and empirical findings.&quot;

Alternative perspectives have been proposed:

# Moving beyond &quot;fact-checking and media literacy&quot; to study a pervasive phenomenon as something that involves more than news consumption.
# Moving beyond &quot;technical solutions&quot; including AI-enhanced fact checking to understand the systemic basis of disinformation.
# Develop a theory that goes beyond &quot;Americentrism&quot; to develop a global perspective, understand cultural imperialism and Third World dependency on Western news&quot;,&quot; and understand disinformation in the Global South.
# Develop &quot;market-oriented disinformation research&quot; that examines the financial incentives and business models that nudge content creators and digital platforms to circulate disinformation online. 
# &quot;Include a multidisciplinary approach&quot;, involving history, political economy, ethnic studies, feminist studies, and science and technology studies.
# Develop understandings of &quot;Gendered-based disinformation (GBD)&quot; defined as &quot;the dissemination of false or misleading information attacking women (especially political leaders, journalists and public figures), basing the attack on their identity as women.&quot;

== Strategies for spreading disinformation ==

=== Disinformation attack ===
The research literature on how disinformation spreads is growing. Studies show that disinformation spread in social media can be classified into two broad stages: seeding and echoing. &quot;Seeding,&quot; when malicious actors strategically insert deceptions, like fake news, into a social media ecosystem, and &quot;echoing&quot; is when the audience disseminates disinformation argumentatively as their own opinions often by incorporating disinformation into a confrontational fantasy.

=== Internet manipulation ===
Studies show four main methods of seeding disinformation online:

# Selective censorship
# Manipulation of search rankings
# Hacking and releasing
# Directly Sharing Disinformation

=== Exploiting online advertising technologies ===
Disinformation is amplified online due to malpractice concerning online advertising, especially the machine-to-machine interactions of real-time bidding systems. Online advertising technologies have been used to amplify disinformation due to the financial incentives and monetization of user-generated content and fake news. The lax oversight over the online advertising market can be used to amplify disinformation, including the use of dark money used for political advertising.

<doc id="142695" wikidata="Q507734" url="?curid=142695" title="Chino Moreno">
<text>Camillo &quot;Chino&quot; Wong Moreno (born June 20, 1973) is an American musician who is best known as the lead vocalist and primary lyricist of the rock band Deftones. He is also a member of the side-project groups Team Sleep, Crosses, and Palms.

Moreno is known for his dramatic tenor voice and distinctive screams. In 2007, he was placed at number 51 in &quot;Hit Parader&quot;″s &quot;Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time&quot;.

==Early life==
Moreno was born in Sacramento, California, the second of five children. His mother is of Mexican and Chinese descent and his father is Mexican. The nickname &quot;Chino&quot; is the Spanish-language term for Chinese people, a moniker &quot;given to him as a kid by his uncles because he looked predominantly Asian, when most Mexicans are mestizo.&quot;

He grew up in the Oak Park area and attended C. K. McClatchy High School, where he met Abe Cunningham and Stephen Carpenter, with whom he founded Deftones in 1988. Before becoming a professional musician, Moreno had a day job at Tower Records&#x27; shipping department.

==Career==

===Deftones===
Circa 1988, Moreno started jamming regularly with his middle-school friends Abe Cunningham and Stephen Carpenter, leading to the formation of Deftones. Within two years, the group started playing club shows. They were signed to Maverick Records after one of their representatives saw them play in Los Angeles. Their first commercially released album was &quot;Adrenaline&quot; (1995), produced by Terry Date. While the album wasn&#x27;t an instant success, extensive touring, word-of-mouth, and Internet promotion built the band a dedicated fan base, as well as helping &quot;Adrenaline&quot; to sell over 220,000 copies without the singles &quot;7 Words&quot; and &quot;Bored&quot; (as well as their music videos) receiving any airplay. For 1997&#x27;s &quot;Around the Fur&quot;, the band expanded its sound, spending more time with Date, and giving more thought to the album&#x27;s production. The record was highly anticipated and propelled Deftones to fame in the alternative metal scene on the strength of radio and MTV airplay for the singles &quot;My Own Summer (Shove It)&quot; and &quot;Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)&quot;.

&quot;White Pony&quot; was released in 2000 to critical acclaim and unprecedented commercial success. Frank Delgado had become a full-time band member, adding new elements to the band&#x27;s music, while Moreno himself contributed guitar lines in addition to vocals. With influences of new wave, dream pop, and trip hop, the album is considered a turning point for the band in terms of experimentation. Singles &quot;Change (In the House of Flies)&quot; and &quot;Digital Bath&quot; supported the album&#x27;s release. A single entitled &quot;Back to School (Mini Maggit)&quot; was released as a rap-influenced reinterpretation of &quot;White Pony&#x27;s&quot; closing track, &quot;Pink Maggit&quot;. While commercially successful and a fan favourite, the band have previously strongly objected to its publication, although it is unclear whether this is still the case. &quot;White Pony&quot; was subsequently re-released with &quot;Back to School (Mini Maggit)&quot; as the album&#x27;s opening track. For the song &quot;Elite&quot;, Deftones received the 2001 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance.

In 2001, Moreno developed a throat injury due to heavy screaming and was forced to miss at least four shows. He suffered inflammation on his right vocal cord and partial paralysis of the left vocal cord. During the rest of their supporting tour, bassist Chi Cheng took over vocal duties that required screaming while Moreno sang the softer melodies of the lyrics, despite recommendations by doctors to hold off from singing to allow time for recovery as well as rumors that the band would be cancelling the remaining stretch of the tour with Godsmack and Puddle of Mudd.

The eponymous &quot;Deftones&quot; was released in 2003, and saw the band being praised for the heavy album&#x27;s progression and originality in the midst of declining creativity in contemporary metal. Moreno was quoted as saying, &quot;It&#x27;s all on record. We told motherfuckers not to lump us in with nu metal because when those bands go down we aren&#x27;t going to be with them.&quot; &quot;B-Sides &amp; Rarities&quot; saw release in 2005, bringing together unreleased and obscure material accrued since 1995. 2006&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Wrist&quot; was completed after a protracted and tumultuous recording process, nearly leading to Moreno&#x27;s departure from Deftones. Later he said it had been &quot;a seriously unhealthy experience&quot; and he &quot;wasn&#x27;t sure if [he] was going to return&quot; at the time the band was on a self-imposed hiatus. After eventually finishing the album in early 2006, Moreno claimed it to be more of a compromise between all of the members&#x27; influences, ranging from their brutal and brooding heavy signature seen on &quot;Adrenaline&quot; and &quot;Around the Fur&quot; to the more experimental sound heard on &quot;White Pony&quot; and &quot;Deftones&quot;. However, the band saw a significant decrease on the album&#x27;s first week sales compared to their two previous releases.

Deftones were working on an upcoming album with the working title &quot;Eros&quot;, when bassist Chi Cheng was severely injured in a car accident in November 2008, remaining in a minimally conscious state and later a partially conscious state up until his death in April 2013. In 2009, the group had recruited Sergio Vega for his replacement and announced an indefinite delay of &quot;Eros&quot;, stating &quot;... we realized that this record doesn&#x27;t best encompass and represent who we are currently as people and as musicians.&quot; With Vega, the group began work on a new album, &quot;Diamond Eyes&quot;, which was released on May 4, 2010. It saw the release of the popular singles &quot;Rocket Skates&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Seen the Butcher&quot; and &quot;Diamond Eyes&quot;. In November 2012, Deftones released their seventh studio album, titled &quot;Koi No Yokan&quot;. &quot;Leathers&quot;, &quot;Tempest&quot; and &quot;Swerve City&quot; came out as its singles. 2016 saw the release of their eighth studio album &quot;Gore&quot;. In 2020 Deftones released their ninth studio album, called &quot;Ohms&quot;, which garnered significant critical praise.

===Side projects===

During the making of Deftones&#x27; &quot;White Pony&quot;, Moreno began work on a side project, Team Sleep. The group released their self-titled debut album in May 2005.

In March 2011, Moreno stated to be working on a new side project known as Crosses, featuring Far guitarist Shaun Lopez and Chuck Doom. Moreno described the project as &quot;minimal and soothing, and it&#x27;s sort of like the stuff I like listening to when I&#x27;m not screaming my head off.&quot; Their debut self-titled EP was released on August 2, 2011. &quot;EP 2&quot; appeared the next year.

In April 2012, it was announced that Moreno had joined former Isis members Jeff Caxide, Aaron Harris and Bryant Clifford Meyer in a side project by the name of Palms. Their first album was released on June 25, 2013.

In April 2016, Moreno teamed up with guitarist Dr. Know of Bad Brains, drummer Mackie Jayson (Bad Brains, Cro-Mags); jazz keyboardist John Medeski of Medeski, Martin, and Wood; and bassist Chuck Doom (Team Sleep, Crosses) to form the supergroup Saudade. They released their first single through BitTorrent Bundle on April 28, 2016.

Moreno has also made a number of guest appearances on numerous younger groups&#x27; songs, such as &quot;Bender&quot; by Sevendust, &quot;Paralytic&quot; by Dead Poetic, &quot;Vengeance Is Mine&quot; by Droid, &quot;Caviar&quot; by Dance Gavin Dance, &quot;Surrender Your Sons&quot; by Norma Jean, and &quot;Reprogrammed to Hate&quot; by Whitechapel. In 2009, Moreno recorded a song with Thirty Seconds to Mars to appear on their album &quot;This Is War&quot;, but was not finished. On May 2, 2010, he performed &quot;The Kill&quot; with 30 Seconds to Mars.

In June 2016, the Secret Solstice music festival announced that Moreno would perform at Thrihnukagigur in what will be the first ever public concert inside the magma chamber of a volcano.

In 2019, Moreno was approached to score the seventh episode of Hulu&#x27;s &quot;Into the Dark&quot; horror anthology series, entitled &quot;I&#x27;m Just F*cking with You&quot;.

==Artistry==

The biggest vocal influences on Moreno include Faith No More&#x27;s Mike Patton, Bad Brains&#x27;s H.R., the Smiths&#x27;s Morrissey and Prince. His musical influences consist of a wide range of styles and genres, including the electronic bands OMD, Depeche Mode, Thompson Twins and the Human League. Other inspirations include the Cure, Bad Brains, PJ Harvey, the Smiths, My Bloody Valentine, Cocteau Twins, Public Enemy, Duran Duran, the Smashing Pumpkins, Portishead, Helmet, Jawbox, Faith No More, Slayer, Hum, Kool Keith, Alice in Chains, Tool, Girls Against Boys, Jane&#x27;s Addiction and Weezer. For &quot;Revolver&quot; he selected five non-metal records that influenced him: the Cure&#x27;s &quot;Pornography&quot;, Helium&#x27;s &quot;No Guitars&quot;, Mogwai&#x27;s &quot;EP+2&quot;, My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s &quot;Loveless&quot; and the Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;. He also made a list of his thirteen favourite albums for &quot;The Quietus&quot;, containing &quot;Small Craft on a Milk Sea&quot; by Brian Eno, &quot;Sunset Mission&quot; by Bohren und der Club of Gore, Fever Ray&#x27;s self-titled album, &quot;Venus Luxure No.1 Baby&quot; by Girls Against Boys, &quot;Turn on the Bright Lights&quot; by Interpol, &quot;You&#x27;d Prefer an Astronaut&quot; by Hum, &quot;Saturdays = Youth&quot; by M83, &quot;Black Noise&quot; by Pantha du Prince, &quot;Love Deluxe&quot; by Sade, &quot;Talkie Walkie&quot; by Air, &quot;Born to Mack&quot; by Too Short, &quot;The Blue Moods of Spain&quot; by Spain and &quot;Standards&quot; by Tortoise.

In an August 1998 interview with &quot;Spin&quot;, Moreno stated &quot;I was one of those kids who thought heavy metal was devil music. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m really a metal fan or a hip hop fan, cause there&#x27;s so many crappy bands out there. I just like a little bit of everything. I think other people are starting to think that way too.&quot; Regarding the influence of female artists such as PJ Harvey, Moreno said he was aware that people considered him to be gay, adding, &quot;I really love girly stuff.&quot;

In relation to his often ambiguous yet image-heavy poetic lyrics, he said, &quot;[Sometimes] my lyrics don&#x27;t deal with specific topics. I write down on paper the feelings of the moment, it&#x27;s not easy to explain the contents of the lyrics or give a logical sense to the words. What I write is also a reaction to the music we make, so the Deftones&#x27; sound is not pop, it doesn&#x27;t communicate happy feelings. Paradoxically my favorite songs of the album talk about love, in a clearly different view.&quot;

Her signature role, which was written by her then partner (now wife) Jane Wagner, was in the show &quot;The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe&quot;, which opened on Broadway in 1985 and earned Tomlin the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. She won Emmy Awards for the special &quot;Lily&quot; (1973) and received a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album for &quot;This Is a Recording&quot; (1972).

In 1975, Tomlin made her film debut with Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Nashville&quot;, which earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. In 1977, her performance as Margo Sperling in &quot;The Late Show&quot; won her the Silver Bear for Best Actress and nominations for the Golden Globe and BAFTA Award for Best Actress. Her other notable films include &quot;All of Me&quot; (1984), &quot;Big Business&quot; (1988), &quot;Flirting with Disaster&quot; (1996), &quot;Tea with Mussolini&quot; (1999), &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot; (2004), &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; (2006), and &quot;Grandma&quot; (2015).

Tomlin is known for her collaborations with Jane Fonda starring in the films &quot;9 to 5&quot; (1980), &quot;80 for Brady&quot; (2023), and &quot;Moving On&quot; (2023). She also starred with Fonda on the Netflix series &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot;, which ran from 2015 to 2022. She earned four Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series nominations. From 2002 to 2006, she portrayed Deborah Fiderer on the Aaron Sorkin series &quot;The West Wing&quot;. She also voiced Ms. Frizzle for the children&#x27;s animated series &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot; (1994–1997) and &quot;The Magic School Bus Rides Again&quot; (2017–2020).

==Early life and education==
Tomlin was born in Detroit, Michigan, the daughter of Lillie Mae (&quot;née&quot; Ford; January 14, 1914July 12, 2005), a housewife and nurse&#x27;s aide, and Guy Tomlin (March 3, 1913October 24, 1970), a factory worker. She has a younger brother named Richard Tomlin. Tomlin&#x27;s parents were Southern Baptists who moved to Detroit from Paducah, Kentucky, during the Great Depression. Although she attended a Southern Baptist church as a child, she later grew to become irreligious. She is a 1957 graduate of Cass Technical High School. Tomlin attended Wayne State University and originally studied biology. She auditioned for a play, and it sparked her interest in a career in the theatre and she changed her major. After college, Tomlin began doing stand-up comedy in nightclubs in Detroit and later in New York City. She continued studying acting at the HB Studio.

== Career ==
=== 1965–1974: Career beginnings and breakthrough ===

Tomlin&#x27;s first television appearance was on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; in 1965. A year later, she became a cast member on the short-lived third and final incarnation of &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot;

Tomlin characters

In 1969, after a stint as a hostess on the ABC series &quot;Music Scene&quot;, Tomlin joined NBC&#x27;s sketch comedy show &quot;Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;. Signed as a replacement for the departing Judy Carne, Tomlin was an instant success on the already established program, in which in addition to appearing in general sketches and delivering comic gags, she began appearing as the regular characters she created; they became well known and she portrayed them outside of the show in later recordings and television specials:
* Ernestine was a brash, tough and uncompromising telephone operator who generally treated customers with little sympathy. Ernestine often snorted when she let loose a barbed response or heard something salacious; she also wore her hair in a 1940s hairstyle with a hairnet, although the character was contemporary. Her opening lines were often the comical &quot;one ringy dingy... two ringy dingy&quot;, and, &quot;Have I reached the party to whom I am speaking?&quot; In the sketches, Ernestine was usually at her switchboard taking calls. She occasionally phoned her boyfriend, Vito, a telephone repair man, or her pal Phenicia, another operator. Tomlin reprised the role in 2016 for a TV ad as part of PETA&#x27;s campaign against SeaWorld. Tomlin has also reprised the role on several episodes of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.
* Edith Ann is a precocious five-and-a-half-year-old girl who waxes philosophical on everyday life, either about life as a kid or things for which she feels she has the answers, although she is too young to fully understand. She often ends her monologues with &quot;And that&#x27;s the truth&quot;, punctuating it with a noisy raspberry. Edith Ann sits in an oversized rocking chair (to make Tomlin seem child-sized) with her rag doll, Doris, and often talks of life at home with her battling parents and bullying older sister, Mary Jean (Lily Tomlin&#x27;s given birth names). Edith Ann has an oversized, playfully aggressive dog named Buster and a boyfriend named Junior Phillips, a possibly unrequited love. (Only Edith Ann and &quot;Doris&quot; appear in the Edith Ann sketches.) Tomlin reprised the character for a series of sketches on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in the 1970s, and voiced her in three prime-time cartoon specials in the 1990s (including &quot;Edith Ann: A Few Pieces of the Puzzle&quot;).
* Mrs. Judith Beasley is a housewife and mother from Calumet City, Illinois, who is often chosen for television commercials and offers &quot;good consumer advice&quot;. She appears in the film &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Woman&quot; as the lead character&#x27;s neighbor.
* Mrs. Earbore (The Tasteful Lady) is a somewhat prudish and prissy, conservatively dressed middle-aged apolitical woman who dispenses advice on gracious living and a life of elegance.
* Susie the Sorority Girl is a blonde collegiate who could be the Tasteful Lady&#x27;s daughter. Humorless and melodramatic, her biggest worries are the likes of who took her missing album by The Carpenters.
*The Consumer Advocate Lady is a dour, austere woman who rigidly inspects and tests products for their alleged value. The Consumer Advocate Lady is something of a variation of Mrs. Beasley.
* Lucille the Rubber Freak is a woman addicted to eating rubber, whose monologue details her habit from its beginning (chewing the eraser on pencils) to her obsessive rock bottom (eating the tip off mother&#x27;s cane). Tomlin performed this character as part of her &quot;Laugh-In&quot; audition.
* Tess/Trudy is a homeless bag lady who accosts theater-goers and various passers-by with her offbeat observations and tales of communications with extraterrestrials. (&quot;They don&#x27;t care if you believe in &#x27;em or not—they&#x27;re different from God.&quot;)
* Bobbi-Jeanine is a showbiz veteran of the lounge circuit where she sings and plays organ. She often dispenses advice. (&quot;It&#x27;s not called Show Art, it&#x27;s Show Business.)

Tomlin was one of the first female comedians to break out in male drag with her characters Tommy Velour and Rick. In 1982, but later popularized by a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; appearance on January 22, 1983, she premiered Purvis Hawkins, a black rhythm-and-blues soul singer (patterned after Luther Vandross), with a mustache, beard, and close-cropped afro hairstyle, dressed in a three-piece suit. Tomlin used very little, if any, skin-darkening cosmetics as part of the character, instead depending on stage lighting to create the effect.
In 1970, AT&amp;T offered Tomlin $500,000 to play her character Ernestine in a commercial, but she declined, saying it would compromise her artistic integrity. In 1976, she appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as Ernestine in a Ma Bell advertisement parody in which she proclaimed, &quot;We don&#x27;t care, we don&#x27;t have to...we&#x27;re the phone company.&quot; The character later made a guest appearance at &quot;The Superhighway Summit&quot; at UCLA on January 11, 1994, interrupting a speech being given on the information superhighway by then-Vice President Al Gore. She appeared as three of her minor characters in a 1998 ad campaign for Fidelity Investments that did not include Ernestine or Edith Ann. In 2003, she made two commercials as an &quot;updated&quot; Ernestine for WebEx. Tomlin brought Edith Ann to the forefront again in the 1990s with three animated prime-time television specials. She published Edith Ann&#x27;s &quot;autobiography&quot;, &quot;My Life&quot; (1995), co-written with Jane Wagner.

Tomlin released her first comedy album, &quot;This Is A Recording&quot;, on Polydor Records in March 1971 that contained Ernestine&#x27;s run-ins with customers over the phone. The album hit No. 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 200, becoming (and remaining ) the highest-charting album ever by a solo comedienne. She earned a Grammy award that year for Best Comedy Recording. Tomlin&#x27;s second album, 1972&#x27;s &quot;And That&#x27;s The Truth&quot;, featuring her character Edith Ann, was nearly as successful, peaking at No. 41 on the chart and earning another Grammy nomination. (Tomlin has two of the three top-charting female comedy albums on &quot;Billboard&quot;, sandwiching a 1983 Joan Rivers release.)

=== 1975–1989: Film stardom and acclaim ===

Tomlin made her dramatic debut in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Nashville&quot; (1975), for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress; she played Linnea Reese, a straitlaced, gospel-singing mother of two deaf children who has an affair with a womanizing country singer (played by Keith Carradine). The Oscar that year went to Lee Grant for her role in &quot;Shampoo&quot;. A comedy-mystery, &quot;The Late Show&quot;, teaming Tomlin with Art Carney, was a critical success in 1977. One of the few widely panned projects of Tomlin&#x27;s career was 1978&#x27;s &quot;Moment by Moment&quot;, directed and written by Wagner, which teamed Tomlin in a cross-generational older woman/younger man romance with John Travolta. Tomlin&#x27;s third comedy album, 1975&#x27;s &quot;Modern Scream&quot;, a parody of movie magazines and celebrity interviews, featured her performing as multiple characters, including Ernestine, Edith Ann, Judith, and Suzie. Her 1977 release &quot;Lily Tomlin On Stage&quot; was an adaptation of her Broadway show that year. Each of these albums earned Tomlin additional Grammy nominations. Tomlin recorded a single/EP called &quot;The Last Duet&quot; with Barry Manilow in 1980.

In March 1977, Tomlin made her Broadway debut in the solo show &quot;Appearing Nitely&quot;, which she co-wrote and co-directed with Jane Wagner, at the Biltmore Theatre. She received a Special Tony Award for this production. The same month, she made the cover of &quot;Time&quot; with the headline &quot;America&#x27;s New Queen of Comedy&quot;. Her solo show then toured the country and was made into a record album titled &quot;On Stage&quot;. In 1980, Tomlin co-starred in &quot;9 to 5&quot;, in which she played a secretary named Violet Newstead who joins coworkers Jane Fonda and Dolly Parton in seeking revenge on their boss, Franklin M. Hart Jr., played by Dabney Coleman. The film was one of the year&#x27;s top-grossing films. Tomlin then starred in the 1981 science fiction comedy &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Woman&quot;, playing three roles (a fourth, a reprise of her Edith Ann character, was cut from the theatrical print, but footage of this character was included in some later TV showings.) The film, a send-up of consumerism, was written by Wagner and met with mixed reviews.
Tomlin bounced back with the critical and financial hit &quot;All of Me&quot; (1984), opposite Steve Martin, in which she played a sickly heiress whose spirit became trapped in Martin&#x27;s body. In 1985, Tomlin starred in another one-woman Broadway show &quot;The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe&quot;, written by her long-time life partner, writer/producer Jane Wagner. The show won her a Tony Award and was made into a feature film in 1991. Tomlin revived the show for a run on Broadway in 2000 which then toured the country through mid-2002. In 1989, she won the Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago theatre. Tomlin premiered her one-woman show &quot;Not Playing with a Full Deck&quot; at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas in November 2009. It was her first appearance in that city, though she did tape an Emmy-winning TV special, a spoof of Las Vegas called &quot;Lily: Sold Out&quot; which premiered on CBS in January 1981. Tomlin and Bette Midler played two pairs of identical twins who were switched at birth in the 1988 comedy &quot;Big Business&quot;.

=== 1990–2009: Continued work and &quot;The West Wing&quot; ===

Tomlin also played chain-smoking waitress Doreen Piggott in Altman&#x27;s 1993 ensemble film &quot;Short Cuts&quot;, based on stories by Raymond Carver. Tomlin voiced Ms. Valerie Frizzle on the animated television series &quot;The Magic School Bus&quot; from 1994 to 1997. Also, in the 1990s, Tomlin appeared on the popular sitcom &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; as the title character&#x27;s boss. In 1995 she appeared on an episode of &quot;&quot; as a murder suspect being transported to Baltimore. She also guest starred on &quot;The X-Files&quot; in 1998, in episode 6 (&quot;How The Ghosts Stole Christmas&quot;) of season 6 as a ghost haunting an old mansion. In 2005 and 2006, she had a recurring role as Will Truman&#x27;s boss Margot on &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;. She appeared on the dramatic series &quot;The West Wing&quot; for four years (2002–2006) in the recurring role of presidential secretary Deborah Fiderer. Tomlin performed in two films by director David O. Russell; she appeared as a peacenik Raku artist in &quot;Flirting with Disaster&quot; and later as an existential detective in &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot;. In March 2007, two videos were leaked onto YouTube portraying on-set arguments between Russell and Tomlin, in which among other things he called her sexist names. When the &quot;Miami New Times&quot; asked Tomlin about the videos, she responded, &quot;I love David. There was a lot of pressure in making the movie—even the way it came out you could see it was a very free-associative, crazy movie, and David was under a tremendous amount of pressure. And he&#x27;s a very free-form kind of guy anyway.&quot;

Tomlin collaborated again with director Robert Altman in what would prove to be his last film, &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; (2006). She played Rhonda Johnson, one-half of a middle-aged Midwestern singing duo partnered with Meryl Streep. Tomlin provided a voice for the film &quot;Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea&quot;, which was released in August 2009. In the 2008–2009 fifth season of &quot;Desperate Housewives,&quot; she had a recurring role as Roberta, the sister of Mrs. McCluskey (played by Kathryn Joosten who coincidentally had played Tomlin&#x27;s secretarial predecessor on &quot;The West Wing&quot;). During the 2008 Emmy Awards, Tomlin appeared as part of a tribute to the influential 1960s television series &quot;Laugh-In&quot;. Tomlin voiced Tammy in the 2005 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Last of the Red Hat Mamas&quot;.

Since its launch in 2008, Tomlin has been a contributor for wowOwow.com, a website for women to talk culture, politics, and gossip. Tomlin and Kathryn Joosten were in talks to star in a &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; spin-off, which was given the green light in May 2009. The series plan was scrapped due to Joosten&#x27;s illness, a recurrence of lung cancer; Joosten died on June 2, 2012, twenty days after the onscreen death from cancer of her character Karen McCluskey. In 2010, Tomlin guest-starred as Marilyn Tobin in the third season of &quot;Damages&quot; opposite Glenn Close, for which she was nominated for an Emmy&quot;.&quot; She also appeared in the &quot;NCIS&quot; episode titled &quot;The Penelope Papers&quot;, playing Penelope Langston, the grandmother of Agent Timothy McGee (Sean Murray). In 2012, Tomlin guest starred on the HBO series &quot;Eastbound and Down&quot; as Tammy Powers, mother of the main character Kenny Powers, and appeared in three episodes of Season 3. Tomlin co-starred with Reba McEntire in the TV series &quot;Malibu Country&quot; as Reba&#x27;s character&#x27;s mother Lillie Mae. The series started shooting in August 2012 with a premiere date of November 2, 2012, at 8:30 pm ET but was canceled in 2013 after 18 episodes.

=== 2015–present: &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot; and resurgence ===
From 2015 to 2022, Tomlin starred opposite Jane Fonda, Martin Sheen, and Sam Waterston in the Netflix original comedy series &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot;. Tomlin plays Frankie Bergstein, recently separated from her husband of forty years (Waterston) while Fonda plays Grace Hanson, recently separated from her husband (Sheen). Grace and Frankie become reluctant friends after learning their husbands are leaving them to be with one another. She received her first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 2015. In 2015, Tomlin starred in filmmaker Paul Weitz&#x27;s film &quot;Grandma&quot;, which Weitz said was inspired by Tomlin. It garnered rave reviews and earned Tomlin a Golden Globe Award nomination.

Tomlin reprised her role as Professor Frizzle in the 2017 Netflix sequel &quot;The Magic School Bus Rides Again&quot;, a continuation of the original series. In 2018, she had a small role voicing Aunt May in the critically acclaimed animated film &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot;.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriage ===
Tomlin met her future wife, writer Jane Wagner, in March 1971. After watching the after-school TV special &quot;J.T.&quot; written by Wagner, Tomlin invited Wagner to Los Angeles to collaborate on Tomlin&#x27;s comedy LP album &quot;And That&#x27;s The Truth&quot;. The couple did not have a formal coming out. Tomlin said in 2006:

Tomlin stated in 2008, &quot;Everybody in the industry was certainly aware of my sexuality and of Jane ... in interviews, I always reference Jane and talk about Jane, but they don&#x27;t always write about it.&quot; In 2015, Tomlin said, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t totally forthcoming. Everybody in the business knew I was gay, and certainly everybody I worked with and everything like that.&quot; Tomlin has been generally quiet about her sexuality. On December 31, 2013, Tomlin and Wagner married in a private ceremony in Los Angeles after 42 years together.

=== Beliefs and activism ===
Tomlin has been involved in a number of feminist and gay-friendly film productions, and on her 1975 album &quot;Modern Scream&quot; she pokes fun at straight actors who make a point of distancing themselves from their gay and lesbian charactersanswering the pseudo-interview question, she replies: &quot;How did it feel to play a heterosexual? I&#x27;ve seen these women all my life, I know how they walk, I know how they talk ...&quot; In 2013, Tomlin and Wagner worked together on the film &quot;An Apology to Elephants&quot;, which Wagner wrote and Tomlin narrated.

<doc id="142703" wikidata="Q2068324" url="?curid=142703" title="Torah study">
<text>Torah study is the study of the Torah, Hebrew Bible, Talmud, responsa, rabbinic literature, and similar works, all of which are Judaism&#x27;s religious texts. According to Rabbinic Judaism, the study is done for the purpose of the &quot;mitzvah&quot; (&quot;commandment&quot;) of Torah study itself.

This practice is present to an extent in all religious branches of Judaism, and is considered of paramount importance among religious Jews. Torah study has evolved over the generations, as lifestyles changed and also as new texts were written.

==Traditional view==
In rabbinic literature, a heavy emphasis is placed on Torah study for Jewish males, with women being exempt. This literature teaches an eagerness for such study and a thirst for knowledge that expands beyond the text of the Tanakh to the entire Oral Torah. Some examples of traditional religious teachings:

* The study of Torah is &quot;equal to all&quot; of the &quot;mitzvot&quot; of honouring one&#x27;s parents, performing deeds of lovingkindness, and bringing peace between people.
* In one sense, Torah study is greater than the honor of father and mother since it is one of the only commandments for which a person is allowed to move far away from his parents without their permission.
* Some Talmudic rabbis consider Torah study as being greater than the rescue of human life, but Jewish law does not codify this opinion because saving a life overrides all other commandments except murder, incest, and idolatry.
* According to Rabbi Meir, when one studies &quot;Torah Lishma&quot; (Torah for its own sake - תורה לשמה ) the creation of the entire world is worthwhile for him alone, and he brings joy to God.
* As the child must satisfy its hunger day by day, so must the grown man busy himself with the Torah each hour.
* Torah study is of more value than the offering of the daily sacrifice.
* A single day devoted to the Torah outweighs 1,000 &quot;korbanot&quot; (sacrifices).
* The fable of the Fish and the Fox, in which the latter seeks to entice the former to dry land, declares that [the People of] Israel can live only in the Law as fish can live only in the ocean.
* Whoever learns Torah at night is granted grace during the day, and whoever neglects it will be fed burning coals in the World to Come.
* God weeps over one who might have occupied himself with Torah study but neglected to do so.
* The study must be unselfish: one should study the Torah with self-denial, even at the sacrifice of one&#x27;s life; and in the very hour before death one should devote himself to this duty.
* All, even lepers and the ritually unclean, are required to study the Torah.
* It is the duty of everyone to read the entire weekly portion twice (the law of &quot;shnayim mikra ve-echad targum&quot;).
* According to R. Yehudah, God Himself studies the Torah for the first three hours of every day.
* According to Rabbi Meir, a gentile who studies the Torah (for the limited purpose of finding out about the Seven Laws of Noah) is as great as the High Priest. An even stronger statement is found in the Mishnah where it discusses the social hierarchy of ancient Israel. The High Priest was close to the top of the social pyramid, and a man born from an illicit sexual relationship was near the bottom. However, &#x27;the learned bastard takes precedence over the ignorant High Priest.&#x27;
*Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch Chajes contended that the prohibition of teaching torah to Gentiles only applies to parts of the Oral Law, but not to the written Scriptures.
*Rabbi Samuel Eidels said the prohibition only included the &quot;reasons and secrets&quot; of the Torah, but not the basic texts or laws.
*Maimonides said that Christians, who believe in the divinity of Scriptures, would at best come to believe in the Jewish interpretation and at worse cause no harm, so the prohibition does not apply to them.
*Rabbi Yisrael Salanter advocated for the translation of the Talmud and its introduction into the university curriculum, in order to raise the reputation of Jewish study in the broader world.

==Origins==


Torah study is counted among the 613 mitzvot (commandments), from the verse in Deuteronomy: &quot;And you shall teach it to your children,&quot; upon which the Talmud comments that &quot;Study is necessary in order to teach.&quot;

The importance of study is attested to in another Talmudic discussion regarding which is preferred: study or action? The answer there, a seeming compromise, is &quot;study that leads to action.&quot; Although the word &quot;Torah&quot; refers specifically to the Five Books of Moses, in Judaism the word also refers to the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), the Talmud and other religious works, even including the study of Kabbalah, Hasidism, Mussar and much more.

=== Kabbalah of action ===

The Mitzvot is like a body because of their performances and these are done by &quot;action&quot; as the material elements with holy Kavanah to bring supernal life to all the world... (i.e. to give good and &quot;Rachamim/Clement attributes&quot; by Tikkun) But &quot;Torah study&quot; is always protection by God and this is a cause of the Brit of Matan Torah, as written : &quot;≪Torah is in your heart... this is in your &quot;words&quot;!≫&quot;

The Torah is the Tree of Life to find true spiritual life, that is the Holy Spirit with the three Supernal Sefirot with Da&#x27;at and the others. The study of Torah can give life and this can build a Temple in the inner dimension of person: God will not take the holy sacrifices but words of Torah and of prayers because in Messianic era the sins will be not and the little sins will be atoned through true force of soul in the heart (Neshama and Ruach with Nephesh) and words of truth on pure and holy mouth.

==Forms of traditional Jewish Torah study== 

The Talmud defines the objective of Torah study: &quot;That the words of Torah shall be clear in your mouth so that if someone asks you something, you shall need not hesitate and then tell it to him, rather you shall tell it to him immediately.&quot; In &quot;yeshivas&quot; (Talmudical schools), rabbinical schools and &quot;kollels&quot; (post-graduate Talmudical schools) the primary ways of studying Torah include study of:
* The &quot;Parsha&quot; (weekly Torah portion) with its Meforshim (Rabbinic commentators)
* Talmud
* Ethical works

Other less universally studied texts include the Nevi&#x27;im and Ketuvim, other rabbinic literature (such as midrash) and works of religious Jewish philosophy.

The text of the Torah can be studied on any of four levels as described in the Zohar:
* &quot;Peshat&quot;, the plain (simple) or literal reading;
* &quot;Remez&quot;, the allegorical reading through text&#x27;s hint or allusion
* &quot;Derash&quot;, the metaphorical reading through a (rabbinic sermon&#x27;s) comparison/illustration (midrash)
* &quot;Sod&quot;, the hidden meaning reading through text&#x27;s secret or mystery (Kabbalah).

The initial letters of the words &quot; Peshat&quot;, &quot; Remez&quot;, &quot; Derash&quot;, &quot; Sod&quot;, forming together the Hebrew word PaRDeS (also meaning &quot;orchard&quot;), became the designation for the four-way method of studying Torah, in which the mystical sense given in the Kabbalah was the highest point. The distinction is similar to the medieval Christian classification into literal, typological, tropological (moral) and anagogical senses of scripture (see Allegory in the Middle Ages): it is not certain whether this fourfold division first appeared in a Jewish or a Christian context.

In Haredi Judaism and much of Orthodox Judaism, Torah study is a way of life for males. In these communities, men forgo other occupations and study Torah full-time. Women do not study Torah, but instead gain merit for facilitating the Torah study of the 
men. A 2017 survey of Modern Orthodox Jews found support for women studying Torah.&quot;

Haredi Israelis often choose to devote many years to Torah study, often studying at a &quot;kollel&quot;. Religious Zionist Israelis often choose to devote time after high school to Torah study, either during their army service at a Hesder yeshiva, or before their service at a Mechina. Many Modern Orthodox students who study in Israel post high-school choose to study at Hesder Yeshivot, namely Yeshivat Har Etzion, Yeshivat Kerem B&#x27;Yavneh, Yeshivat Shaalvim and Yeshivat HaKotel. A portion of these students join the Hesder system, draft into the army and/or make Aliyah.

In addition to full-time Torah study, Jews around the world often attend Torah classes in a contemporary academic framework. The Rohr Jewish Learning Institute offers classes on Parenting, Marriage, Medical Ethics, and Business Ethics.

==Methods==
===The Brisker method===
The Brisker method consists of a methodical search for precise definitions of each concept involved in the discussion. Once the mechanism by which a law works is rigidly and correctly defined, it can become clear that one aspect of the definition applies in one situation but not another. Therefore, the final &quot;halacha&quot; will differ in the two situations, even if they superficially appear to be very similar.

Often an entire series of disagreements among the Rishonim (Talmudic commentaries from roughly the period 1000–1500) may stem back to a subtle difference in how these Rishonim understand a line from the Talmud. The Brisker method can provide a precise formulation of how each Rishon understood the topic, and thus account for their differences in opinion. This approach is most productive when a whole series of debates between two Rishonim can be shown to revolve around a single &quot;chakira&quot;, or difference in the understanding of a Talmudic concept.

The Brisker method is not a total break from the past. Rabbis before Brisk sometimes made &quot;conceptual&quot; distinctions, and Brisker rabbis can still resolve issues without recourse to the terminology they invented. The difference is one of focus and degree. Non-Brisk analysis tends to formulate &quot;conceptual&quot; definitions only when necessary, while for Briskers, these definitions are the first and most common tool to be used when approaching a Talmudic issue.

One example of the emphasis on the value of precise definition can be found in a quote attributed to Chaim Soloveitchik: &quot;One approach which answers three different problems is better than three different approaches to individually solve the three problems&quot; (a corollary of Occam&#x27;s razor).

===The Luzzatto method===
Moshe Chaim Luzzatto was the only one to set down the sages&#x27; thought process in an organized, systematic, and complete program that can be taught and reproduced. This method makes Gemara (Talmud) learning accessible to everyone by exploring key logical concepts of Talmudic analysis. It is claimed that based on precision and clarity of thinking, one&#x27;s inherent intellectual powers are studied, cultivated and nurtured. Conscious awareness of one&#x27;s thinking and thoughts is the key to understanding Torah.

===The Zilberman method===
The Zilberman Method, pioneered in the mid-20th century by Yitzhak Shlomo Zilberman, draws upon traditional teaching methods as outlined by Chazal and championed by the Judah Loew ben Bezalel and Vilna Gaon. The Mishnah and the Talmud set forth halakhic guidelines for teaching Torah to children. These guidelines include the ages at which texts should be studied (&quot;Five years old is the age to begin studying Scripture; ten for Mishnah; thirteen for the obligation of the commandments; fifteen for the study of Talmud...&quot;) the times of study (including Shabbat for children; &quot;Hachazan roeh heichan tinokot korin&quot; – the chazzan observes [on Shabbat] where [in the text] the children are reading) and the manner of teaching (&quot;safi lei k&#x27;tura&quot; –stuffing the children like oxen; &quot;ligmar inish v&#x27;hadar lisbor&quot; –read the text and then explain it.)

The Zilberman method has children focus exclusively on Tanakh and Mishnah in their younger years, ensuring that they know large portions of both areas by heart before they begin learning Gemara. Indeed, graduates of such schools tend to have impressive fluency in these areas. Two key elements in Zilberman&#x27;s methodology, however, must be singled out: &quot;chazarah&quot; (review) and student participation.

In the Zilberman-styled school, a new text of Chumash is introduced in the following manner (obviously adjustments are made for each grade level). On Monday and Tuesday, the teacher chants the text with the &quot;tropp&quot; (&quot;ta&#x27;amei ha&#x27;mikra&quot;) and the students immediately imitate him. This is repeated several times until the students are able to read the text independently. Then the teacher introduces the translation/explanation of the text and invites students to participate in the process. New words typically need to be translated only once; subsequently, students are encouraged to call out the translation on their own. All translations are strictly literal. If the translation does not automatically yield a comprehensible meaning, the students are invited to try to find one. The class spends the rest of the week reviewing the material. Each pasuk is reviewed with the tropp at least twenty-four times.

==Study cycles==
Apart from full-time Torah study as engaged in at schools and &quot;yeshivot&quot;, or for the purpose of rabbinic training, there is also held to be an obligation on individuals to set aside a regular study period to review their knowledge. 
Pious individuals thus often daily review one of the major works - Talmud Bavli, Talmud Yerushalmi, &quot;Nach&quot; (Tanach), Midrash Rabba, Midrash Tanchuma, Tosefta, Sifra, Sifri, Mishna, &quot;Rambam&quot;, &quot;Tur&quot;, Shulchan Aruch, Mishnah Berurah, the Zohar - according to their interest.
In more recent times, structured study-programmes have become popular; these include.
* &quot;Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum&quot;, study of the weekly Torah portion together with the Aramaic Targum - dating to Talmudic times - and often, Rashi&#x27;s commentary.
* &quot;Ḥoq le-Yisrael&quot;, a programme founded by rabbis Hayyim ben Joseph Vital and Chaim Joseph David Azulai in which, every week, one studies extracts from the Mishnah, the Zohar and other works in addition to the portion for that week: the relevant passages are often printed in book form in a multivolume set.
* Daily Chumash with Rashi each day of the week corresponding to one of the seven Aliyos read on Shabbos - one part of Chabad&#x27;s &quot;Chitas&quot; study
* The &quot;Seder ha-Mishmarah&quot;, used by some Mizrahi Jews, in which each weekly Torah portion is studied together with sections from Neviim and Ketuvim and the Mishnah so that all these works are read in full in the course of the year: this too has been published in book form under the title &quot;Ḥoq le-Ya&#x27;akob&quot;. In some countries it was customary for groups to gather in the synagogue each Shabbat afternoon and read out the &quot;mishmarah&quot; passages for the following Shabbat.
* The &quot;Daf Yomi&quot; program, founded in 1923 by Meir Shapiro: one page of the Talmud is studied each day, on a rota to ensure that Jews round the world are studying the same passage at the same time (approximately 7.5 year cycle).
* The &quot;Amud Yomi&quot;, similar to Daf Yomi, but only one side of a page per day (approximately 14 years)
* &quot;Yerushalmi Yomi&quot; – daily study of the Jerusalem Talmud (according to the pagination of the Vilna edition, this is a 4⅓-year cycle; starting with the most recent cycle, there is an alternate cycle following the Oz Vehadar edition, which is roughly a 7.5 year cycle.)
* &quot;Mishnah Yomit&quot;, daily study of the Mishnah (6 year cycle); &quot;Mishnatit&quot; covers all of Mishnah at a much faster pace (1 year cycle).
* Daily Rambam Study, one or three chapters of the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; (respectively, a 3 or 1-year cycle)
* &quot;Mishnah Berurah Yomit&quot; - daily study (2.5 or 5-year cycle)
* &quot;Kitzur Shulchan Aruch Yomi&quot; - daily study (1 year cycle)
* &quot;Halacha Yomit&quot; daily study of the Shulchan Aruch (4 year cycle); Breslov &quot;hasidim&quot; have a similar practice to daily review the Shulchan Aruch in addition to &quot;Likutei Moharan&quot; and &quot;Likutei Halachos&quot; 
* &quot;Tanya&quot; - daily study (1 year cycle) as part of the &quot;Chitas&quot; cycle as for Rashi above
* 929: Tanakh B&#x27;yachad - study of 5 chapters of Tanakh (Jewish Bible) per week (approx 4 year cycle)
* &quot;Chafetz Chayim&quot; and &quot;Shemiras Halashon&quot;, daily review of the laws concerning &quot;Lashon Hara&quot; (meaning &quot;Evil tongue&quot;, gossip and slander; 1 year cycle).
*&quot;Tzurba M&#x27;Rabanan&quot; (4 year cycle), detailed discussion on contemporary Halachik applications: studied in the Religious Zionist community (and outside Israel, through Mizrachi in some Modern Orthodox communities)

==D&#x27;var Torah==

A &quot;d&#x27;var Torah&quot; (, &quot;word of Torah&quot;; plural: &quot;divrei Torah&quot;), also known as a &quot;drasha&quot; or &quot;drash&quot; in Ashkenazic communities, is a talk on topics generally relating to a &quot;parashah&quot; (section) of the Torah – typically the weekly Torah portion. 
A typical d&#x27;var Torah imparts a life lesson, backed up by passages from texts such as the Talmud, Midrash, or more recent works.

In respect to its place in synagogues, rabbis will often give their d&#x27;var Torah after the Torah reading. Divrei Torah can range in length, depending on the rabbi and the depth of the talk. In most congregations, it will not last much longer than fifteen minutes, but in the case of rebbes or special occasions, a d&#x27;var Torah can last all afternoon.

In other settings, &quot;&quot;D&#x27;var Torah&quot; is used interchangeably with &quot;vort&quot;&quot; (Yiddish for &quot;word (of Torah)&quot;), and may then refer to any Torah idea delivered informally, although typically linked to the weekly &quot;Parasha&quot;. 
This will be on various occasions,
 
and not necessarily by a Rabbi: 
for example, by the host at their Shabbat table, by the leader before &quot;Benching&quot; (grace after meals), or by a guest at &quot;sheva brachot&quot;, or at any &quot;Seudat mitzvah&quot;.

==Torah study by various Jewish movements==
The recommended way to study the Torah is by reading the original text written in Hebrew. This allows the reader to understand language-specific information. For example, the Hebrew word for earth is &#x27;adama&#x27; and the name of the first man is &#x27;Adam&#x27; meaning &#x27;of the earth&#x27;. Jewish denominations vary in the importance placed on the usage of the original Hebrew text. Most denominations strongly recommend it, but also allow studying the Torah in other languages, and using Rashi and other commentary to learn language-specific information.

Like Orthodox Jews, other Jewish denominations may use any or all of the traditional areas and modes of Torah study. They study the &quot;Parsha&quot;, the Talmud, ethical works, and more. They may study simply the &quot;peshat&quot; of the text, or they may also study, to a limited extent, the &quot;remez&quot;, &quot;derash&quot;, and &quot;sod&quot;, which is found in &quot;Etz Hayyim: A Torah Commentary&quot; (Rabbinical Assembly), used in many Conservative congregations. It is common in Torah study among Jews involved in Jewish Renewal. Some level of &quot;PaRDeS&quot; study can even be found in forms of Judaism that otherwise are strictly rationalist, such as Reconstructionist Judaism. However, non-Orthodox Jews generally spend less time in detailed study of the classical Torah commentators, and spend more time studying modern Torah commentaries that draw on and include the classical commentators, but which are written from more modern perspectives. Furthermore, works of rabbinic literature (such as the Talmud) typically receive less attention than the Tanakh.

Before the Enlightenment, virtually all Jews believed that the Torah was dictated to Moses by God. Since many parts of the Torah, specifically the laws and commandments, are written in unspecific terms, they also believed that Moses received an interpretation of the Torah that was transmitted through the generations in oral form till it was finally put in writing in the Mishnah and later, in greater detail, the Talmud. After the Enlightenment, many Jews began to participate in wider European society, where they engaged in study related to critical methods of textual analysis, including both lower and higher criticism, the modern historical method, hermeneutics, and fields relevant to Bible study such as Near Eastern archaeology and linguistics. In time the documentary hypothesis emerged from these studies. The documentary hypothesis holds that the Torah was not written by Moses, but was simply written by different people who lived during different periods of Israelite history. Some Jews adapted the findings of these disciplines. Consequently, biblical study primarily focused on the intentions of these people, and the circumstances in which they lived. This type of study depends on evidence external to the text, especially archaeological evidence and comparative literature.

Today, Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist rabbis draw on the lessons of modern critical Bible scholarship as well as the traditional forms of Biblical exegesis. Orthodox Jews reject critical Bible scholarship and the documentary hypothesis, holding to the opinion that it is contradicted by the Torah and the Talmud, which state that Moses wrote the Torah, as well as by the Mishnah, which asserts the divine origin of the Torah as one of the essential Jewish principles of faith.

Humanistic Jews value the Torah as a historical, political, and sociological text written by their ancestors. They do not believe &#x27;that every word of the Torah is true, or even morally correct, just because the Torah is old.&#x27; The Torah is both disagreed with and questioned. Humanistic Jews believe that the entire Jewish experience, and not only the Torah, should be studied as a source for Jewish behavior and ethical values.

===Non-religious Torah study===
According to Ruth Calderon, there are currently almost one hundred non-halakhic Torah study centers in Israel. While influenced by methods used in the yeshiva and in the university, non–religious Torah study includes the use of new tools that are not part of the accepted hermeneutic tradition of the exegetic literature. These include feminist and post-modernist criticism, historic, sociological and psychological analyses, and literary analysis. Among these institutions is the Alma Centre for Hebrew Studies in Tel Aviv.

==Torah study abroad in Israel==

Devoting a year to Torah study in the modern Land of Israel is a common practice among American, and, to a lesser extent, European, South African, South American, and Australian Modern Orthodox Jews. Young adults spend a year studying Torah in the Land of Israel. It is common both among males and females, with the boys normally going to a yeshiva and the girls to a midrasha (often called &quot;seminary&quot; or &quot;seminaria&quot;). Yeshivot with year-in-Israel programs include: Mir yeshiva (Jerusalem), Yeshivat Sha&#x27;alvim, Yeshivat Kerem B&#x27;Yavneh, Yeshivat Har Etzion, Yeshivas Midrash Shmuel, Yeshivat HaMivtar, Machon Meir, Dvar Yerushalayim, Aish HaTorah, and Ohr Somayach. Seminaries, or midrashot, include: Midreshet HaRova, Midreshet Lindenbaum, Migdal Oz, Nishmat, B&#x27;not Chava, Michlalah, Neve Yerushalayim.

Multi-year programs also exist: Hasidic and Haredi boys from abroad often spend many years studying in the Land of Israel. Bnei Akiva offers a number of options to spend a year of study in Israel, as part of their &quot;Hachshara&quot; programs.

<text>The national flag of Austria () is a triband in the following order: red, white, and red.

The Austrian flag is considered one of the oldest national symbols still in use by a modern country, with its first recorded use in 1230. The Austrian triband originated from the arms of the Babenberg dynasty. As opposed to other flags, such as the black-and-yellow banner of the Habsburgs, the red-white-red flag was from very early on associated, not with a reigning family or monarch, but with the country itself.

In addition to serving as the flag of Austria since 1230, it was adopted as the naval ensigns and flags of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and Duchy of Modena and Reggio in the 18th and 19th centuries respectively, as both were ruled by cadet branches of the House of Habsburg.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The flag traces back to the coat of arms of the medieval Babenberg dynasty, a silver band on a red field (in heraldry: &quot;Gules a fess Argent&quot;). The origin of the &quot;Bindenschild&quot; has not been conclusively established; it possibly derived from the Styrian margraves of the Otakar noble family, who themselves may have adopted the colours from the descendants of the Carinthian duke Adalbero (ruled 1011–1035), a scion of the House of Eppenstein extinct in 1122. However, the Babenberg margrave Leopold III of Austria (1095–1136) had already been depicted with a triband shield in 1105.

When the last Otakar Duke Ottokar IV of Styria died in 1192, the Styrian duchy was inherited by the Babenberg duke Leopold V of Austria according to the 1186 Georgenberg Pact. According to the 18th-century historian Chrysostomus Hanthaler, his grandson Duke Frederick II of Austria (1230–1246), nicknamed the &quot;Quarrelsome&quot; or the &quot;Warlike&quot;, the last of the Babenberg dynasty, designed a new coat of arms in red-white-red after his accession—an attempt to prevail against reluctant local nobles and to stress his autonomy towards Emperor Frederick II. The triband is first documented in a seal on a deed issued on 30 November 1230, confirming the privileges of Lilienfeld Abbey. The medieval chronicler Jans der Enikel reports that the duke appeared in a red-white-red ceremonial dress at his 1232 accolade in the Vienna Schottenstift.

The Babenberg family colours developed to the coat of arms of their Austrian possessions. After the dynasty had become extinct with Frederick&#x27;s death at the 1246 Battle of the Leitha River, they were adopted by his Přemyslid successor King Ottokar II of Bohemia. Upon the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld the colours were assumed by the victorious House of Habsburg and gradually became the coat of arms of the dynasty&#x27;s Hereditary Lands within the Habsburg monarchy.

=== Legend ===

According to legend, the flag was invented by Duke Leopold V of Austria as a consequence of his fighting during the Siege of Acre. After a fierce battle, his white surcoat was completely drenched in blood. When he removed his belt, the cloth beneath remained unstained, revealing the combination of red-white-red. So taken was he by this singular sight that he adopted the colours and scheme as his banner. The incident was documented as early as 1260.

In fact, the war flag of the Holy Roman Empire during the Crusades was a silver cross on a red field quite similar to the later Austrian arms. This sign was used by the Austrian capital Vienna from the late 13th century onwards.

=== Habsburg Monarchy ===
Since the days of Rudolph of Habsburg and the 1283 Treaty of Rheinfelden, the combination of red-white-red was widely considered to be the Austrian (later also Inner Austrian) colours used by the ruling Habsburg dynasty. However, the black-yellow flag was used as the &quot;national flag&quot; (in a modern sense) of the Austrian Habsburg monarchy, the later Austrian Empire and the Austrian part of Austria-Hungary, and sometimes even for the entire empire until 1918. These were the family colours of the Imperial House of Habsburg, and were themselves in part derived from the banner of the Holy Roman Empire.

Beginning in the reign of Emperor Joseph II, the Austrian, later Austro-Hungarian Navy used a naval ensign (&quot;Marineflagge&quot;) based on the red-white-red colours, and augmented with a shield of similar colours. Both of these flags became obsolete with Austria-Hungary&#x27;s dissolution in 1918, and the newly formed rump state of German Austria adopted the red-white-red triband as its national flag.

==Austrian flag coin==
One example of an Austrian flag coin is the 20 euro Post War Period coin, issued by the Republic of Austria on 17 September 2003. The obverse of this coin shows the Austrian coat of arms flanked by the Austrian flag and the European Union flag.

==Colours==
The Constitution of Austria does not specify the colour shades of the flag, but members of the Austrian Armed Forces are told that the red on the coat of arms (which is used for the flag shield on the eagle) is Pantone 186 C.

The red-white-red Austrian flag is almost identical to several other flags found around the world, including the flags of Bouillon and Leuven in Belgium, of Vianden in Luxembourg, of Latvia, the flag of Savona in Italy, the flags of Dordrecht, Gouda, Hoorn and Leiden in the Netherlands, and the flag of Puerto Asís in Colombia.

<text>The word Yid (; ), also known as the Y-word, is a Jewish ethnonym of Yiddish origin. It is used as an autonym within the Ashkenazi Jewish community, and also used as slang by European football fans, antisemites, and others. Its usage may be controversial in modern English language. It is not usually considered offensive when pronounced (rhyming with &quot;deed&quot;), the way Yiddish speakers say it, but some may deem the word offensive nonetheless. When pronounced (rhyming with &quot;did&quot;) by non-Jews, it is commonly intended as a pejorative term. It is used as a derogatory epithet by antisemites along with, and as an alternative to, the English word &#x27;Jew&#x27;. 

In Britain, the word &quot;yid&quot; and its related term &quot;yiddo&quot; are also used to refer to the supporters and players of Tottenham Hotspur. Originally, the word was used in a derogatory manner by rival fans; it is now used as self-designation in a non-pejorative sense by Tottenham fans, according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. The Football Association, &quot;Merriam-Webster&quot;, and &quot;Cambridge Dictionary&quot; all state that the word is &quot;offensive&quot;.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Yid&quot; has its origins in the Middle High German word &#x27; (the contemporary German word is &#x27;).

Leo Rosten provides the following etymology:
From the German: Jude: &#x27;Jew.&#x27; And &#x27;Jude&#x27; is a truncated form of Yehuda, which was the name given to the Jewish Commonwealth in the period of the Second Temple. That name, in turn, was derived from the name of one of Jacob&#x27;s sons, Yehuda (Judah, in English), whose descendants constituted one of the tribes of Israel and who settled in that portion of Canaan from Jerusalem south to Kadesh-Barnea (50 miles south of Beersheba) and from Jericho westwards to the Mediterranean.

==History==
The earliest printed mention of the word &quot;Yid&quot; in English was in &quot;The Slang Dictionary&quot; published by John Camden Hotten in 1874. Hotten noted that &quot;The Jews use these terms very frequently.&quot;

It is uncertain when the word began to be used in a pejorative sense by non-Jews, but some believe it started in the 20th century, likely in the 1930s when there was a large population of Jews and Yiddish speakers in East London where Oswald Mosley also had a strong following. Mosley&#x27;s supporters were said to have chanted while marching through Jewish areas: &quot;The Yids, the Yids, we gotta get rid of the Yids&quot;. 

After World War II, most examples of the word &quot;Yid&quot; are found in the writing of Jewish authors. These occurrences are usually either attempts to accurately portray antisemitic speech, or as self-deprecating Jewish humor. In his 1968 bestseller &quot;The Joys of Yiddish&quot;, Leo Rosten offers a number of anecdotes from the &quot;Borscht Belt&quot; to illustrate such usage.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; indicates that the first attested use of the related term &quot;yiddo&quot; for a Jew appeared in 1972. 

The words &quot;yid&quot; and &quot;yiddo&quot; have become commonly associated in Britain with fans of Tottenham Hotspur since the 1960s. In January 2020, the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; extended the definition of &quot;yid&quot; to &quot;a supporter of or player for Tottenham Hotspur Football Club (traditionally associated with the Jewish community in north and east London).

As of 2022, &quot;Merriam-Webster&quot;, and the &quot;Cambridge Dictionary&quot; all categorize the word as &quot;offensive&quot;. &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, however, noted its change of meaning in British English: &quot;Originally and frequently derogatory and offensive, though later also often as a self-designation.&quot;

==Usage in Yiddish==
In Yiddish, the word &quot;Yid&quot; is neutral or even complimentary, and in Ashkenazi Yiddish-speaking circles it is frequently used to mean simply &quot;fellow,&quot; &quot;chap,&quot; &quot;buddy,&quot; &quot;mate,&quot; etc., with no expressed emphasis on Jewishness (although this may be implied by the intra-Jewish context). Plural is .

In Yiddish, a polite way to address a fellow Jew whose name one does not know is &quot;Reb Yid,&quot; meaning &quot;Sir.&quot; The Yiddish words &quot;yidish&quot; or &quot;yiddisher&quot; (from Middle High German &quot;jüdisch&quot;) is an adjective derived from the noun &quot;Yid,&quot; and thus means &quot;Jewish&quot;.

==Usage in European football==

A number of European clubs, such as Tottenham Hotspur and Ajax have become associated with being Jewish. In the case of Tottenham Hotspur, rival fans chanted antisemitic abuse including &#x27;Yids&#x27; against Tottenham fans. In response some Jewish and non-Jewish fans of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. adopted &quot;Yid&quot; (or &quot;Yiddo&quot;) as a nickname and &quot;Yiddo, Yiddo!&quot; as a battle cry and often identify themselves as &quot;Yid Army&quot;. While such usage remains controversial, the majority of Tottenham fans support its use in a survey and use the word with pride, and consider the usage an act of reclaiming the word as a badge of honour, nullifying its derogatory meaning when used by rival fans. In a survey, more than half of Jewish fans have no objection to the use of the word by Tottenham fans, but around a quarter preferred for it not to be used. Some Jewish Tottenham supporters consciously use it to identify the club as a bastion against racism and antisemitism. Fans of other clubs use the term as a pejorative because of the perception that many Tottenham Hotspur fans are Jewish. This following started in the early 20th century after the First World War when the club was the team of choice for large numbers of Jewish immigrants in North London and the East End of London – those in East London could easily get cheap buses and trams to Tottenham, heading north along the road later designated the A10. East-end Jews have since mostly moved to the North and East London suburbs, Hertfordshire and Essex, but support for Tottenham Hotspur continues for many Jewish families; for example, all three chairmen of Tottenham since 1984 have been Jewish businessmen with prior history of support for the club.

In 2011, comedian David Baddiel started an antisemitism campaign against the use of the word in football, and debates continued in 2013 when the Football Association warned that supporters who used the word could face criminal charges. Prime Minister David Cameron, however, said that it was not anti-Semitic when Spurs fans used the word, while Baddiel argued that the word is derogatory. in 2014, the Crown Prosecution Service dropped charges against Tottenham fans for chanting the words as it considered such words as used by Tottenham fans could not legally be counted as &#x27;threatening, abusive or insulting&#x27;.

In February 2020, The Oxford English Dictionary expanded its definition of the word &#x27;Yid&#x27; to include a &quot;supporter of or player for Tottenham Hotspur... Originally and frequently derogatory and offensive, though later also often as a self-designation&quot;. It also added the closely related word &#x27;Yiddo&#x27; to its latest edition. The club criticised the inclusion as &quot;misleading&quot; as the dictionary does not &quot;distinguish the contexts in which the term is and is not offensive&quot;, it said: &quot;As a club we have never accommodated the use of the Y-word on any club channels or in club stores&quot;. The &quot;yiddo&quot; entry of the Oxford English Dictionary has since added a note that it is sometimes used as a self-designation by Tottenham Hotspur supporters &quot;now usually without derogatory connotations&quot;, as further clarification to its statement &quot;Usually derogatory and offensive&quot;.

In 2019, Tottenham Hotspur conducted a consultation and received 23,000 responses from fans about the use of the word. The club conducted the second phase after a pause due to Covid-19, and in 2022, concluded, &quot;We recognise how these members of our fanbase feel and we also believe it is time to move on from associating this term with our Club.&quot;

<doc id="142713" wikidata="Q497997" url="?curid=142713" title="Flag of Alabama">
<text>The current flag of the U.S. state of Alabama (the second in Alabama state history) was adopted by Act 383 of the Alabama Legislature on February 16, 1895:
The cross of St. Andrew referred to in the law is a diagonal cross, known in vexillology as a saltire. Because the bars must be at least wide, small representations of the Alabama flag do not meet the legal definition. In 2001, a survey conducted by the North American Vexillological Association ranked Alabama&#x27;s state flag 29th in design quality of the 72 Canadian provincial, U.S. state and U.S. territorial flags. There are sources that believe the saltire was intended to memorialize the Confederacy, but no legislative records indicate the inspiration for the flag.

==History==

===1861 flag===

On January 11, 1861, the Alabama Secession Convention passed a resolution designating an official flag. Designed by several women from Montgomery, final touches were made by Francis Corra of that city. One side of the flag displayed the goddess of Liberty holding an unsheathed sword in her right hand; in her left, she held a small blue flag with one gold star. Above the gold star appears the text &quot;Alabama&quot; in all capital letters. In an arch above this figure were the words &quot;Independent Now and Forever&quot;. The reverse side of the flag had a cotton plant with a coiled rattlesnake. The text &quot;Noli Me Tangere&quot;, (&quot;Touch Me Not&quot; in Latin), was placed below the cotton plant. 
This flag was flown until February 10, 1861, when it was removed to the governor&#x27;s office after it was damaged by severe weather. It was never flown again.

===Current flag===
Alabama&#x27;s current flag was adopted in 1895. The legislation introduced by Representative John W. A. Sanford Jr. stipulates: &quot;The flag of the state of Alabama shall be a crimson cross of St. Andrew on a field of white. The bars forming the cross shall be not less than six inches broad, and must extend diagonally across the flag from side to side.&quot; St. Andrew&#x27;s cross represents the cross on which St. Andrew was crucified.

The legislation that created the state flag did not specify that the flag was to be square but defined the width of the bars of the cross. In 1987, the office of Alabama Attorney General Don Siegelman stated in a letter that the proper shape of the state flag is rectangular, as it had been depicted numerous times in official publications and reproductions. Despite this, the flag is still often depicted as being square, even in official publications of the U.S. federal government.

The saltire of Alabama&#x27;s flag most closely resembles the saltire of the flag of Florida, which was derived from the Spanish Cross of Burgundy. Southern Alabama was originally part of Spanish Florida and subsequently West Florida.

Alabama adopted its flag design in 1895, five years earlier than Florida did.

===Theories on origin===
The inspiration for Alabama&#x27;s flag is not known. Many have noted that a saltire also appears in flags used decades earlier by the Confederate States of America, a group of states, including Alabama, that declared secession and warred against the United States during the American Civil War. No documentation in the legislative records indicates the Alabama flag was intended to commemorate the Confederacy.

Still, various people have asserted over the decades that the design was drawn from the Confederate battle flag.

In 1900, the &quot;Montgomery Advertiser&quot; reported the flag was &quot;a memory and a suggestion of the Confederate battle flag&quot;. In 1906, a piece in the &quot;Birmingham Age-Herald&quot; stated the Alabama state flag &quot;has no history woven into it&quot;. In 1915, Thomas M. Owen, the first director of the Alabama Department of Archives and History, wrote that the flag bill&#x27;s sponsor and the rest of the legislature had intended to &quot;preserve, in permanent form, some of the more distinctive features of the Confederate battle flag&quot;. The authors of a 1917 article in &quot;National Geographic&quot; expressed their opinion that the Alabama flag was based on the Confederate battle flag.

In 1924, Bell Allen Ross, a member of the Daughters of the Confederacy, said that Rep. John W.A. Sanford Jr. modeled his design of the Alabama flag on the battle flag used by his father, John W. A. Sanford, while commanding the Hilliard&#x27;s Legion regiment. She said Sanford&#x27;s design was meant to preserve some of the distinctive features of the Confederate battle flag, particularly the Saint Andrews Cross.

In a 1987 letter, Alabama Attorney General Don Siegelman wrote that the flag was modeled after Sanford&#x27;s 60th Alabama Infantry Regiment battle flag.

More recent commentators note that the Alabama flag was adopted during a period of promotion of the &quot;Lost Cause&quot; of the culture of the antebellum South. Other former Confederate slave states, beginning with Mississippi, and followed by Florida, had also adopted new state flags around the same time that they disenfranchised African Americans and passed laws establishing Jim Crow segregation.

But other contemporary commentators, such as Steve Murray, Director of the Alabama Department of History and Archives, believe the origins of the flag are unclear. According to Murray, the flag&#x27;s connections to the battle flag are thin and based on suppositions. Murray said, &quot;I would conclude that if they were wanting to evoke the Confederate battle flag, they would have been more explicit about doing it either in the design which could have more closely resembled the Confederate flag.&quot; Murray also noted that Alabama may have wanted to approve a new state flag to prepare for an exposition in Atlanta, Georgia, later that year.

==Governor&#x27;s flag==

The flag of the governor of Alabama is a variant of the state flag. In the top saltire, the flag displays the state coat of arms. The bottom saltire contains the state military crest, which consists of a cotton plant with full bursting boll.

Emirates is the world&#x27;s third-largest airline by scheduled revenue passenger-kilometers flown. It is also the second-largest in terms of freight tonne-kilometers flown.

During the mid-1980s, Gulf Air began to cut back its services to Dubai. As a result, Emirates was founded on 15 March 1985, with backing from Dubai&#x27;s royal family and its first two aircraft provided by Pakistan International Airlines. With $10  million in start-up capital, it was required to operate independently of government subsidies. Pakistan International Airlines also provided free training facilities to Emirates cabin crew at Karachi Airport. The airline was founded by Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the airline&#x27;s present chairman. In the years following its founding, the airline rapidly expanded both its fleet and its destinations. In October 2008, Emirates moved all of its operations at Dubai International Airport to Terminal 3.

Emirates operates a mixed fleet of Airbus and Boeing wide-body aircraft and is one of the few airlines to operate an all-wide-body aircraft fleet (excluding Emirates Executive). , Emirates is the world&#x27;s largest Airbus A380 operator with 116 aircraft in service. Since its introduction, the Airbus A380 has become an integral part of the Emirates fleet, especially on long-haul, high-density routes. Emirates is also the world&#x27;s largest Boeing 777 operator with 133 aircraft in service.

== History ==

Emirates was founded in March 1985 with backing from Dubai&#x27;s ruler, Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.

On 25 October 1985, Emirates operated its first flight from Dubai to Karachi and Mumbai, using the Airbus A300B4-200 and the Boeing 737-300, both wet-leased from Pakistan International Airlines. In 1986, Emirates added Colombo, Dhaka, Amman and Cairo to its route network.

On 3 July 1987, A6-EKA flew from Toulouse to Dubai as Emirates took delivery of its first owned aircraft, an Airbus A310-304. Flights to Frankfurt commenced via Istanbul, London Gatwick and Malé. This was followed by Singapore, Bangkok and Hong Kong.

During its early years, Emirates experienced strong growth, averaging 30% annually. The Gulf War helped boost business for the airline as it was the only airline to continue flying in the last ten days of the war. In June 1991 shortly after the end of the hostilities caused by the Gulf War, Emirates finally managed to acquire slots at London Heathrow. In 1996, Emirates took delivery of its baseline Boeing 777-200, followed by the extended-range version in 1997 and in 1999 the Airbus A330-200. In 2000, the airline placed an order for a large number of aircraft, including the Boeing 777-300 and the Airbus A380, and also launched its frequent flyer program, Skywards.

Since then, the airline has continued to expand its fleet and network, with a focus on operating flights to anywhere in the world via Dubai and competing with other major airlines on international routes. Its growth has attracted criticism from other carriers, who claim that the airline has unfair advantages and have called for an end to open-skies policies with the UAE as a result. In 2017, Emirates &quot;renewed its aircraft buying spree&quot; and agreed to buy a number of Boeing&#x27;s 787 Dreamliners for $15.1 billion. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; described the deal as a &quot;painful loss&quot; for Airbus. In 2023, Emirates ordered $50 billion of Boeing jets with their sister airline, flyDubai at the Dubai Airshow. Emirates ordered 90 aircraft, including both versions of the new long-haul jet.

In April 2024, Emirates announced its plan to relocate its hub to Al Maktoum Airport when the new airport is fully completed.

== Corporate management ==

The airline is a subsidiary of The Emirates Group, which is a subsidiary of the Dubai government&#x27;s investment company, Investment Corporation of Dubai. The airline has recorded a profit every year, except its second year, and the growth has never fallen below 20% a year. In its first 11 years, it doubled in size every 3.5 years and has every four years since.

In 2015, Emirates paid dividends worth AED2.6 billion (US$708 million), compared to AED1 billion (US$272 million) in 2014. The government has received AED14.6  billion from Emirates since dividends started being paid in 1999 for having provided an initial start-up capital of US$10  million and an additional investment of about US$80  million at the time of the airline&#x27;s inception. The Dubai government is the sole owner of the company, but it does not put any new money into it, nor does it interfere with running the airline.

=== Structure and employment ===
Emirates has diversified into related industries and sectors, including airport services, engineering, catering, and tour operator operations. Emirates has seven subsidiaries and its parent company has more than 50. At the end of the fiscal year on 31 March 2020, the company employed a total of 59,519 staff, of which 21,789 were cabin crew, 4,313 were flight deck crew, 3,316 were in engineering, 12,627 were listed as other, 5,376 employees were at overseas stations, and 12,098 were at subsidiary companies. The Emirates Group employed a total of 105,730 employees.

Emirates provides its employees with benefits such as comprehensive health plans and paid maternity and sick leave. Another strategy employed by Emirates is to use profit sharing and merit pay as part of its competency-based approach to performance management. In 2023 and 2024, the group awarded its employees hefty bonuses as their share of the company&#x27;s profits earned in those years. In 2023, employees got 24 weeks of pay as their bonus, and in 2024, they received 20 weeks of pay.

=== Environmental record ===

The airline claims to have lower emissions than other airlines because its fleet has an average fuel burn of fewer than 4 liters for every 100 passenger–kilometers. In 2023, the airline announced it would invest $200 million over three years to find research and development regarding the reduction of fossil fuels in commercial aviation, including investing in the development of fuel and energy alternatives and solutions.

The key trends for Emirates are (as of the financial year ending 31 March):

== Branding ==


In the 1990s, Emirates launched its first set of commercials all with the slogan &quot;So be good to yourself, Fly Emirates&quot;. In 1999, it launched a very rare A330-200 commercial with different pictures showing the aircraft painted in the original livery and the livery used from 1999 until 2023, which was launched a few months prior.

Commercials reappeared beginning in 2002 and the airline adopted the slogan &quot;Fly Emirates. Keep Discovering&quot; in 2004. In the 2010s, Emirates utilized multiple slogans in its advertising including &quot;Fly Emirates. Keep Discovering&quot;, &quot;Fly Emirates To over Six Continents&quot;, and &quot;Hello Tomorrow&quot;. Emirates currently uses the slogan &quot;Fly Better&quot;.

Emirates introduced a new uniform design in August 2008 for its 16,000 staff, designed by Simon Jersey. The offboard uniform includes the Emirates hat, red kick-pleats in the skirts, more fitted blouses, and the return of red leather shoes and handbags. For the onboard uniform, male and female cabin crew wear service waistcoats in place of the previously worn service jackets and tabards. The male flight attendants wear a chocolate brown suit, featuring pinstripes, with a cream shirt and caramel, honey, and red tie. Both male and female pursers wear this chocolate brown color but with no red featured.

Since its formation in 1985, Emirates aircraft have carried a section of the United Arab Emirates flag on the tail fins, a calligraphy version of the logo in Arabic on the engines, and the &quot;Emirates&quot; logo on the fuselage both in Arabic and English. The color scheme used since 1985 was changed in November 1999. This change included the modification of the logotype, the enlargement and movement of the English logo (the Arabic remaining smaller) towards the front of the aircraft, and a different, flowing flag on the tailfin.

In 2022, Emirates launched two commercials featuring a flight attendant standing on the spire of the Burj Khalifa. The first commercial was about the UAE moving to the UK&#x27;s Amber list in the wake of the COVID-19 travel restrictions. The second commercial was to promote the Expo 2020 event with an Airbus A380, painted in a special livery, circling the woman. The woman in the videos was a qualified stuntwoman dressed as an Emirates flight attendant.

=== Infrastructure ===

From 2011 until 2022, Emirates sponsored the Emirates Air Line cable car over the River Thames in East London.

Since 2015, Emirates has sponsored the England-based Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth on the south coast. The airline had £3.5 million worth of plans to paint the landmark red, but after discussion with the residents of Portsmouth and Southsea, Emirates agreed the tower was to be colored blue and gold, with red lettering of the Emirates sponsor, for the reason that Portsmouth F.C.

=== Alliance ===

Emirates has partnerships with other airlines, but is not a member of any of the three global airline alliances – Oneworld, SkyTeam, or Star Alliance. In 2000, the airline briefly considered joining Star Alliance, but opted to remain independent. The reasoning for this was later revealed by the senior vice president of the airline&#x27;s commercial operations worldwide that, &quot;Your ability to react in the marketplace is hindered because you need a consensus from your alliance partners&quot;.

== Divisions ==

=== Emirates Executive ===

Emirates Executive was launched in 2013 for corporate and private charters. It operates a single Airbus ACJ319 business jet, accommodating 19 people. It features a mix of private suites and seating, a lounge, a dining area, and bathrooms with full-height showers.

=== Emirates SkyCargo ===

Emirates SkyCargo is the cargo division of Emirates. It began operations in October 1985, the same year Emirates was formed, and launched its aircraft services in 2001 with a Boeing 747 Freighter. It serves 10 exclusive cargo destinations, besides others in common with the Emirates passenger network. During the 2020 pandemic, SkyCargo also began to operate 777-300ER and A380 passenger aircraft as preighters to expand their total cargo capacity. In 2022, Emirates ordered 5 more Boeing 777 freighters, up from their 11 at the time.

== Fleet ==

As of January 2025, Emirates operates a fleet of 252 passenger aircraft and 13 cargo aircraft operated by Emirates SkyCargo. Emirates currently has 116 Airbus A380s, 133 Boeing 777s, including 10 777-200LRs and 123 777-300ERs, making them the largest operator of both types. The airline also has 3 Airbus A350-900s, and one Airbus A319 as an executive jet (this is painted in a plain white livery). Emirates has had no narrow-body aircraft in its mainline fleet since 1995.

In July 2014, Emirates finalized an order for 150 Boeing 777X aircraft (this number was later reduced, see below), consisting of 35 777-8s and 115 777-9s, and was expected to become the launch operator for the 777X in mid 2020. In November 2017, it signed a commitment for 40 787-10s, but by early 2019, it was considering cancelling this order because engine margins were insufficient for the hot Dubai weather, in favour of the Airbus A350.

In February 2019, Emirates signed a memorandum of understanding with Airbus for 40 A330-900s and 30 A350-900s, while reducing its total A380 order to eight (with the last one to be delivered in 2022) after which Airbus planned to permanently cease production of the A380. Emirates received the final A380 (registration A6-EVS) built by Airbus on 16 December 2021. It was the 123rd A380 to join the fleet. The delivery officially marked the end of the Airbus A380 production 14 years after the first delivery to Singapore Airlines in 2007.

In November 2019, Emirates announced an order of 50 A350-900s worth US$16 billion that superseded the February memorandum of understanding. Also in November 2019, Emirates placed an order for 30 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners for a value of US$8.8 billion, while reducing its order of 777Xs from 150 to 126.

In December 2019, Emirates clarified that 11 of its 777X orders were subject to reconfirmation, but the overall number of orders had not been reduced. Being the largest operator of the A380, Emirates maintains its fleet via the MRO subsidiary of Safran, OEMServices.

On 13 November 2023, at the Dubai Airshow, Emirates finalized an order of 90 777X aircraft worth US$52 Billion, including 50 Boeing 777-9 aircraft and 35 Boeing 777-8 aircraft. This brings the total Boeing 777X backlog to 205 aircraft. Another 5 Boeing 787 Dreamliners were ordered, growing Emirates&#x27; 787 backlog to 35 – while converting 30 787-9s to 20 787-8 and 10 787-10 aircraft.

On 16 November 2023, also at the Dubai Airshow, Emirates ordered an additional 15 Airbus A350-900s worth US$6 billion, bringing the total of A350-900s ordered by Emirates to 65. The first A350-900 was delivered on November 25, 2024. A350 services began on 4 January 2025, with an inaugural flight to Edinburgh.

== Livery ==
=== First livery (1985–1999) ===
The first livery of Emirates, created by Negus &amp; Negus, was similar to the second livery, except that the company name &quot;Emirates&quot; was written in a different font; it was relatively smaller, located on the top of the windows; and it was followed by the company name in Arabic. All aircraft wearing the first-generation livery were either repainted or retired. This livery was retired by 2005 as the last aircraft with the first generation livery (an Airbus A310-300) was repainted to the second generation livery.

=== Second livery (1999–2023) ===
The second Emirates livery, which featured a UAE flag on the vertical stabilizer and a white fuselage, with the golden word &quot;Emirates&quot; painted on the upper fuselage, was introduced in November 1999 on the Boeing 777-300 and the Airbus A330-200, as well as all other aircraft that were delivered from November 1999 onward. The livery rolled out shortly after in 2000 on the rest of the Emirates fleet, and Emirates repainted all aircraft to this livery by 2005. The second Emirates livery also kept the Arabic company name, but the font size was smaller than the one from the first Emirates livery. The Emirates logo in Arabic is painted gold on all engines. The livery was updated in 2005 when the red word &quot;Emirates&quot; was introduced and painted on the belly of the fuselage.

=== Current livery (2023–present) ===

On 16 March 2023, Emirates revealed its new livery. The livery features a more dynamic, flowing design of the UAE flag on the tailfin with a 3D effect. The wingtips are now painted red, displaying the Emirates logo in white Arabic calligraphy. Passengers with window seats can see the UAE flag colors painted on the inside of the wingtips, facing the fuselage.

The airline&#x27;s Airbus A350s will also include the updated UAE flag on the inner side of the winglets.

== Services ==


=== Cabin ===

; First class

The two types of first class seating are the fully enclosed suite with a floor-to-ceiling door and a private suite with doors that close but do not extend to the ceiling. Both suites come complete with closing doors to ensure privacy, a minibar, a coat rack, and storage. They also feature the ICE system on a LCD screen in the private suites and a on the fully enclosed suite. The seat converts into a fully flat bed. Private suites are available on three-class and four-class Airbus A380-800 and three-class Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. The fully enclosed suites are available only on newly delivered Boeing 777-300ER aircraft.

On its newly delivered Airbus A380-800, first class features private suites, two shower-equipped lavatories and spa, and access to the first/business class bar area and lounge. Premium class seating is located on the entire upper deck of A380-800 aircraft.

Emirates introduced a new first-class cabin for its Boeing 777-300ER fleet on 12 November 2017 and first flight to Brussels and Geneva on 1 December 2017. The new first-class cabin is configured with six suites on a 1-1-1 layout. Both of the middle suites are equipped with three virtual windows, which are high-definition LCD screens that relay real-time images using HD cameras on either side of the aircraft. Amenities include two minibars placed on either side of the entertainment screen, a 13-inch tablet with a front camera to communicate with the cabin crew and to order room service, and a panel to control the lighting and temperature inside the suite. Emirates has also introduced a new seat in collaboration with Mercedes-Benz, which features a new zero-gravity position. The suites are expected to resemble &quot;a private bedroom on a luxury yacht&quot;. Many consider this product the best First Class in the world.

; Business class

Business class on Boeing 777-200LRs and Boeing 777-300ERs feature seats with a pitch that reclines to , angled lie-flat beds. Amenities include massage function, privacy partition, winged headrest with six-way movement, two individual reading lights, and an overhead light per seat; in-seat power supply, USB ports, and an RCA socket for laptop connection; and over 600 channels of entertainment on ICE, shown on a HD TV screen.

On Airbus A380-800 aircraft, the seats recline to form a fully flat bed and are equipped with personal minibars. The unique staggered layout makes half of the business-class seats on Emirates A380 shorter than the others, at only long. Business class passengers also have access to an on-board bar at the rear of the aircraft.

In December 2020, it was announced that Emirates&#x27; new Premium economy cabin would be equipped with Recaro PL3530 seats which were designed exclusively for the airline.

The seats offer a pitch of up to 40 in (101  cm), a recline of 8 in (20  cm) and measure 19.5 in (49  cm) wide. All seats are equipped with a 13.3 in (33 cm) entertainment screen using the Emirates ICE system.

Currently, twenty-two Airbus A380 aircraft in the Emirates fleet have the new premium economy class cabin. These seats are also set to be retrofitted on the airline&#x27;s older Boeing 777-300ERs and Airbus A380s as part of a retrofit program of US$2 billion that began at the end of 2022; by the end of the program, 67 Airbus A380s and 53 Boeing 777s will be fitted with premium economy.
; Economy class

Emirates economy class offers a seat pitch on Airbus aircraft and on Boeing aircraft, with standard seat width (except on the Boeing 777 fleet). Emirates has 10 seats per row on its Boeing 777 fleet. The seat features adjustable headrests, a 3000-channel ICE in-flight entertainment system, and in-seat laptop power outlets on newer aircraft and laptop recharging facilities in galleys in older aircraft. Additional recline is available on A380 economy-class seats.

=== Catering ===


Catering on Emirates flights from Dubai International is provided by Emirates Flight Catering, which operates one of the largest airline catering facilities in the world. Emirates also offers special meal options, in all classes, based on age, dietary restrictions and preference, and religious observance. Special meals must be ordered in advance at least 24 hours before the flight departure time. All meals are prepared according to Halal dietary guidelines. In June 2018, Emirates signed a $40 million joint venture with Oakland, California-based Crop One Holdings, to build and maintain the world&#x27;s largest hydroponic growing facility. It will provide daily yields of roughly 3 tons of leafy greens per day to all flights, with a near indoor, vertical farm.

=== In-flight entertainment system ===

Emirates became one of the first airlines in the world to introduce a personal entertainment system on commercial aircraft in 1992, with Virgin Atlantic introducing a similar system throughout all cabins of its aircraft. All three classes feature a personal in-flight entertainment (IFE) system in the Emirates aircraft. There are two types of entertainment systems in the Emirates: ICE and ICE Digital Widescreen.

In 2012, Emirates introduced larger high-definition IFE screens in all classes. The new IFE is the first to be fully high definition, and in economy, the screens are the largest offered by any airline. The new IFE will only be installed on the Airbus A380 fleet and the newly delivered Boeing 777s.

==== In-flight entertainment system (ICE) ====

ICE (information, communication, entertainment) is the in-flight entertainment system operated by Emirates.

Introduced in 2003, ICE is available on all new aircraft and now features 4,000 channels (on most flights) for all passengers. ICE is found on the airline&#x27;s Airbus A350-900, Airbus A380-800, Boeing 777-200LR, and Boeing 777-300ER.

In July 2007, Emirates introduced ICE Digital Widescreen, an updated version of ICE. It offered over 1200 channels of selected entertainment to all passengers. ICE Digital Widescreen is available on all Emirates aircraft.

In 2015, Emirates upgraded its ICE system to the new eX3 system, which included new upgrades that improved the passenger experience, such as a handset with more controls, larger screens, new sockets, some 3,500 channels of movies, TV shows, music, and games, on-demand and in multiple languages, new ICE features, such as a Voyager app, Bluetooth audio, and personal video playback. This is fitted on all B777 and A380 aircraft delivered after 2009. The redesigned version of ICE system, which based on Thales Avant, was introduced in 2025 with its first A350 delivery.

According to Emirates, ICE has received more awards than any other airline in the world for inflight entertainment.

; Information

The system is based on the 3000i system from Panasonic Avionics Corporation. ICE provides passengers with a direct data link to BBC News. ICE is the first IFE system to be connected directly to automatic news updates. This is complemented by ICE&#x27;s &quot;Airshow&quot; moving-map software from Rockwell Collins. Exterior cameras located on the aircraft can be viewed by any passenger, through the IFE system, during takeoff, cruise, and landing. Emirates was also one of the first airlines to introduce high-speed, in-flight internet service along with Singapore Airlines, by installing the Inmarsat&#x27;s satellite system and became the second airline in the world to offer live international television broadcasts using the same system.

; Communication

ICE has a link to an in-flight email server, which allows passengers to access, send, or receive emails for US$1 per message. ICE also supports a seat-to-seat chat service. In November 2006, the airline signed a deal with mobile communications firm AeroMobile to allow in-flight use of mobile phones to call or text people on the ground. The service was first introduced in March 2008.

The ICE system includes movies, music, and video games. ICE offers over 600 on-demand movie titles, over 2000 video on demand and prerecorded television channels, over 1000 hours of music, and over 100 video game titles. ICE can be accessed in more than 40 languages, including English, French, German, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, Urdu, Persian, Korean, Tamil, Thai, Dutch, Swedish, Italian, and Japanese. Since 2003, all entertainment options are available on demand to all classes with options to pause, forward, and rewind them.

Emirates began to offer docking capability for Apple Inc.&#x27;s iPod portable music and video player in mid 2007. This allows the device&#x27;s battery to be charged and integrates with Emirates&#x27; in-flight entertainment (IFE) system. The IFE system can play music, television shows, or movies stored on the iPod, and function as a control system. This feature was removed from Emirates aircraft starting in the late 2010s due to the iPod being discontinued.

== Business model ==


The established network carriers in Europe and Australia, such as Air France-KLM, British Airways, Lufthansa, and Qantas, see Emirates&#x27; strategic decision to reposition itself as a global carrier as a major threat because it enables travelers to bypass traditional airline hubs such as London-Heathrow, Paris-CDG, and Frankfurt on their way between Europe/North America and Asia/Australia by changing flights in Dubai instead. These carriers also find it difficult to deal with the growing competitive threat Emirates poses to their business because of their much higher cost base. Some of these carriers, notably Air France and Qantas, have accused Emirates of receiving hidden state subsidies and maintaining too close of a relationship with Dubai&#x27;s airport authority and its aviation authority, both of which are also wholly state-owned entities that share the same government owner with the airline. Qantas&#x27; chairman claimed that Emirates can reduce its borrowing costs below market rates by taking advantage of its government shareholders&#x27; sovereign borrower status. Emirates&#x27; president disagrees and has also referred to United States airlines bankruptcy protection as being a tangible form of state assistance. The airline makes regular profits. In 2016, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines made similar claims, as well as stating that Emirates violates Open Skies, but these conflicts were resolved in May 2018.

In May 2010, Emirates executives denied claims that the carrier does not pay taxes and receives substantial financial assistance from the Dubai government. They claimed that the airline received $80m in cash in the 25 years since the airline was established and this was substantially lower than what other national carriers had received. Maurice Flanagan also claimed that Emirates incurred social costs of around $600m in 2009, and this included municipal taxes to the city of Dubai. The airline also paid a dividend of AED956m ($260m) in 2010, compared to AED2.9bn ($793m) in 2009, and each year the Government has received at least $100m in dividends. Emirates also faces competition from other Middle Eastern airlines, mainly Qatar Airways and Abu Dhabi–based Etihad Airways.

== Sustainability ==
In its efforts to reduce carbon emissions, the Emirates started exploring the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for its fleet since 2017. The airline has partnered with the world&#x27;s leading biodiesel producers such as Neste, the Finnish producer of sustainable aviation fuel as well as Shell Aviation. In January 2023, the airline conducted a successful demonstration flight of a Boeing 777-300ER using 100 percent SAF in one of its two engines. In November of the same year, Emirates conducted another demonstration flight of an Airbus A380 using 100 percent SAF in one of the airplane&#x27;s four engines. Following successful tests, Emirates operated its first commercial flight using SAF blend on October 24, 2023, on Emirates flight EK 412 from Dubai to Sydney, Australia using an Airbus A380.

Currently, the airline has suppliers set up to supply its flights with SAF in several airports around the world including Paris, Lyon, Oslo, Amsterdam, London, Singapore and its home base in Dubai.

==Accidents and incidents==
Emirates has experienced several aircraft incidents (none with passenger or crew fatalities).

* On 9 April 2004, Emirates Flight 764, an Airbus A340-300 operating from Johannesburg to Dubai sustained serious damage during takeoff when it overran runway 03L, striking runway 21R approach lights, causing four tires to burst, which threw debris into various parts of the aircraft, ultimately damaging the flap drive mechanism. This rendered the flaps immovable in the takeoff position. The aircraft returned for an emergency landing during which the normal braking system failed as a result of the damage. The aircraft was brought to a stop only from the end of the runway using reverse thrust and the alternative braking system. In their report, South African investigators found that the captain had used a wrong take-off technique, and criticized Emirates training and rostering practices.
* On 20 March 2009, Emirates Flight 407, an Airbus A340-500 registered A6-ERG en route from Melbourne to Dubai, failed to take off properly at Melbourne Airport, hitting several structures at the end of the runway before eventually climbing enough to return to the airport for a safe landing. There were no injuries, but the incident was severe enough to be classified as an accident by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.
* On 3 August 2016, Emirates Flight 521, a Boeing 777-300 registered A6-EMW and arriving from Trivandrum International Airport crash-landed and caught fire at Dubai International Airport at 12:44 pm local time. All 282 passengers and 18 crew on board survived the impact with 32 injuries (4 seriously) reported. However, an airport firefighter died fighting the blaze. The aircraft was destroyed by the fire. Flight 521 is currently the first and only hull loss in the history of Emirates.
* On 14 April 2020, an Emirates Boeing 777-300ER registered A6-EBR was struck by a British Airways Airbus A350-1000 (G-XWBA) on the ground while the A350 was pushing back from the gate for departure. No casualties were reported, however, the horizontal stabilizer on both aircraft were damaged as a result of the collision.
* On 20 December 2021, Emirates Flight 231, a Boeing 777-300ER registered as A6-EQI departed Dubai International Airport towards Washington Dulles. The aircraft nearly overran the runway during takeoff, flying at only over houses located near the airport. The aircraft was not damaged and there were no injuries. The incident remains under investigation.
* On 1 July 2022, Emirates Flight 430, an Airbus A380-842 registered as A6-EVK departed Dubai International Airport towards Brisbane International Airport. During the cruise, one of the aircraft&#x27;s 22 tires experienced a rupture, which caused damage to a portion of the aerodynamic fairing. The plane landed safely in Brisbane and there were no fatalities.
* On 27 March 2024, an Airbus A380 suffered serious damage after it was hit by an emergency vehicle on the tarmac of Moscow Domodedovo International Airport.
* On 28 March 2024, an Emirates Boeing 777 narrowly avoided a collision with an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX over Somaliland.
* On 20 May 2024, Emirates Flight 508, a Boeing 777-300ER, suffered a bird strike before landing at Mumbai. While there were no injuries among passengers and crew, the plane suffered substantial damage and at least 36 flamingos were killed in the strike while the plane was flying over Ghatkopar suburban region of Mumbai. An alternative aircraft was arranged for the return flight, and the plane was later repaired and put back into service. 
* On 15 June 2024, Emirates Flight 262, an Airbus A380-861 registered as A6-EUL, aborted the takeoff from runway 09L at São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport, SP (GRU) after an engine left side surged while the flight crew applied takeoff thrust.
* On 25 September 2024, Emirates Flight 547, a Boeing 777-300ER operating from Chennai International Airport to Dubai International Airport began to emanate smoke when the refueling process was underway. Fire trucks were quickly rushed to the aircraft to extinguish the smoke. All passengers who were boarding were told to disembark the aircraft. The Dubai-bound flight was eventually delayed to 12:15 AM the next day.

==Controversies==

Emirates has received criticism for their treatment of staff, which Emirates has disputed and is declining year over year. On September 23, 2016, an Italian man sued the Emirates for being squashed by an obese man for 9 hours. In 2019, an Australian woman filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against Emirates for not providing her water, leading her to collapse during a long-haul flight.

In August 2022, Emirates suspended its flights to Nigeria after it got into a dispute with the government of Nigeria over the repatriation of an undisclosed amount of money from the country. The dispute has since been resolved and in June 2024, the airline resumed its regular flights to the West African nation. Emirates has been sued twice in 2023 for deceptive advertising, once by a New Zealand male passenger and again two months later by a British energy trader. The New Zealand case was awarded in favor of the passenger, and the British case is ongoing.

In August 2023, a Pakistani man sued Emirates for ₹5,000,000 claiming that the airline&#x27;s service was extremely poor and below international standards. On June 13, 2024, the United States government fined Emirates for $1.8 million for operating flights carrying JetBlue Airways’ designator code below over prohibited airspace in Iraq. On November 25, 2024, a Ghanian businessman, Djanie Kotey filed a lawsuit against Emirates, but was dismised. On December 6, 2024, Emirates was sued by TAF Africas CEO Jake Epelle for N150 Million over human rights violations.

Emirates is one of the few airlines still serving Russia after major carriers pulled out of the country amid sweeping sanctions over the Ukraine war. Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Emirates continued operating flights to Russia, maintaining regular services to Moscow and St. Petersburg , enabling travel and commerce with the sanctioned state. By maintaining business as usual, Emirates undermines global efforts to isolate Russia and apply economic pressure to stop its invasion of Ukraine.

<text>The kazoo is a musical instrument that adds a &quot;buzzing&quot; timbral quality to a player&#x27;s voice when the player vocalizes into it. It is a type of &quot;mirliton&quot; (which itself is a membranophone), one of a class of instruments which modifies its player&#x27;s voice by way of a vibrating membrane of goldbeater&#x27;s skin or material with similar characteristics. There is a smaller version of the kazoo, known as a humazoo.

==Playing==
A kazoo player hums, rather than blows, into the bigger and flattened side of the instrument. The oscillating air pressure of the hum makes the kazoo&#x27;s membrane vibrate. The resulting sound varies in pitch and loudness with the player&#x27;s humming. Players can produce different sounds by singing specific syllables such as &quot;doo&quot;, &quot;too&quot;, &quot;who&quot;, or v&quot;rrrr&quot; into the kazoo.

==History==

 Simple membrane instruments played by vocalizing, such as the onion flute, have existed since at least the 16th century. It is claimed that Alabama Vest, an African-American in Macon, Georgia, invented the kazoo around 1840, although there is no documentation to support that claim. The story originated with the Kaminsky International Kazoo Quartet, a group of satirical kazoo players, which may cast doubt on the veracity of the story, as does the name &quot;Alabama Vest&quot; itself.

In 1879, Simon Seller received a patent for a &quot;Toy Trumpet&quot; that worked on the same principle as a kazoo: &quot;By blowing through the tube A, and at the same time humming a sort of a head sound, a musical vibration is given to the paper covering c over the aperture b, and a sound produced pleasing to the ear.&quot; Seller&#x27;s &quot;toy trumpet&quot; was basically a hollow sheet-metal tube, with a rectangular aperture cut out along the length of the tube, with paper covering the aperture, and a funnel at the end, like the bell of a trumpet. The first documented appearance of a kazoo was that created by an American inventor, Warren Herbert Frost, who named his new musical instrument &quot;kazoo&quot; in his patent #270,543 issued on January 9, 1883. The patent states, &quot;This instrument or toy, to which I propose to give the name &#x27;kazoo&#x27; &quot;...&quot; Frost&#x27;s kazoo did not have the streamlined, submarine shape of modern kazoos, but it was similar in that the aperture was circular and elevated above the length of the tube. The modern kazoo—also the first one made of metal—was patented by George D. Smith of Buffalo, New York, May 27, 1902.

In 1916, the Original American Kazoo Company in Eden, New York started manufacturing kazoos for the masses in a two-room shop and factory, utilizing a couple of dozen jack presses for cutting, bending and crimping metal sheets. These machines were used for many decades. By 1994, the company produced 1.5 million kazoos per year and was the only manufacturer of metal kazoos in North America. The factory, in nearly its original configuration, is now called The Kazoo Factory and Museum. It is still operating, and it is open to the public for tours.

In 2010, The Kazoo Museum opened in Beaufort, South Carolina with exhibits on kazoo history.

==Professional usage==
The kazoo is played professionally in jug bands and comedy music, and by amateurs everywhere. It is among the acoustic instruments developed in the United States, and one of the easiest melodic instruments to play, requiring only the ability to vocalize in tune. In North East England and South Wales, kazoos play an important role in juvenile jazz bands. During Carnival, players use kazoos in the Carnival of Cádiz in Spain and in the corsos on the murgas in Uruguay.

In the Original Dixieland Jass Band 1921 recording of &quot;Crazy Blues&quot;, what the casual listener might mistake for a trombone solo is actually a kazoo solo by drummer Tony Sbarbaro.

Red McKenzie played kazoo in a Mound City Blue Blowers 1929 film short. The Mound City Blue Blowers had a number of hit kazoo records in the early 1920s featuring Dick Slevin on metal kazoo and Red McKenzie on comb and tissue paper (although McKenzie also played metal kazoo). The vocaphone, a kind of kazoo with a trombone-like tone, was occasionally featured in Paul Whiteman&#x27;s Orchestra. Trombonist-vocalist Jack Fulton played it on Whiteman&#x27;s recording of &quot;Vilia&quot; (1931) and Frankie Trumbauer&#x27;s &quot;Medley of Isham Jones Dance Hits&quot; (1932). The Mills Brothers vocal group originally started in vaudeville as a kazoo quartet, playing four-part harmony on kazoo with one brother accompanying them on guitar.

The kazoo is rare in European classical music. It does appear in David Bedford&#x27;s &quot;With 100 Kazoos&quot;, where, rather than having professionals play the instrument, kazoos are handed out to the audience, who accompany a professional instrumental ensemble. Leonard Bernstein included a segment for kazoo ensemble in the First Introit (Rondo) of his &quot;Mass.&quot; The kazoo was used in the 1990 Koch International and 2007 Naxos Records recordings of American classical composer Charles Ives&#x27; &quot;Yale-Princeton Football Game&quot;, where the kazoo chorus represents the football crowd&#x27;s cheering. The brief passages have the kazoo chorus sliding up and down the scale as the &quot;cheering&quot; rises and falls.

In Frank Loesser&#x27;s score for the 1961 Broadway musical comedy &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;, several kazoos produce the effect of electric razors used in the executive washroom during a dance reprise of the ballad &quot;I Believe in You&quot;.

In 1961, Del Shannon&#x27;s &quot;So Long Baby&quot; issued on Big Top Records featured a kazoo on the instrumental break. In addition to the single release it featured on the UK London American release of his album &quot;Hats Off To Del Shannon&quot;. Joanie Sommers&#x27; 1962 hit single &quot;Johnny Get Angry&quot; featured a kazoo ensemble in its instrumental bridge, as did Dion&#x27;s hit of the same year, &quot;Little Diane&quot;, and Ringo Starr&#x27;s 1973 cover of &quot;You&#x27;re Sixteen&quot;.

Jesse Fuller&#x27;s 1962 recording of his song &quot;San Francisco Bay Blues&quot; features a kazoo solo, as does Eric Clapton&#x27;s 1992 recording of the song on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Unplugged&quot; television show and album. On the song &quot;Alligator&quot; on the Grateful Dead album &quot;Anthem of the Sun&quot;, three members of the band play kazoo together. Many Paolo Conte performances include kazoo passages.

Short kazoo performances appear on many modern recordings, usually for comic effect. For example, in his first album, &quot;Freak Out!&quot;, Frank Zappa used the kazoo to add comic feel to some songs — including one of his best known, &quot;Hungry Freaks, Daddy&quot;. In the song &quot;Crosstown Traffic&quot; from the album &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot;, Jimi Hendrix used a comb-and-paper instrument to accompany the guitar and accentuate a blown-out speaker sound. The song &quot;Lovely Rita&quot;, from the Beatles album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, uses combs-and-paper instruments. Kazoo playing parodied the sound of a military brass band in the Pink Floyd song &quot;Corporal Clegg&quot;.
In the McGuinness Flint recording &quot;When I&#x27;m Dead and Gone&quot;, Benny Gallagher and Graham Lyle play kazoos in harmony during the instrumental break. The New Seekers&#x27; live track &quot;(Ever Since You Told Me That You Loved Me) I&#x27;m A Nut&quot; features a kazoo solo by singer Eve Graham. British singer-songwriter Ray Dorset, the leader of pop-blues band Mungo Jerry, played the kazoo on many of his band&#x27;s recordings, as did former member Paul King.

One of the best known kazooists of recent times is Barbara Stewart (1941–2011). Stewart, a classically trained singer, wrote a book on the kazoo, formed the &quot;quartet&quot; Kazoophony, performed kazoo at Carnegie Hall and on the &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; television show. 

The soundtrack of the film &quot;Chicken Run&quot;, released in 2000 and composed by John Powell and Harry Gregson-Williams, makes use of kazoos in several pieces.

The video game &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s New Island&quot;, released in 2014, has synthesized kazoos in several tracks of its soundtrack.

The Ukrainian polka band Los Colorados released a cover of Rammstein song &quot;Du Hast&quot;, which features a kazoo.

In November 2010, Sandra Boynton produced and released a full-length 300-kazoo plus orchestra performance of Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Bolero&quot;, titled &quot;Boléro Completely Unraveled, performed by the Highly Irritating Orchestra&quot;. Boynton played solo kazoo on this recording noting &quot;I am at the perfect level of musical incompetence for this.&quot;

==Records==
On March 14, 2011, the audience at BBC Radio 3&#x27;s Red Nose Show at the Royal Albert Hall, along with a star-studded kazoo band, set a new Guinness World Record for Largest Kazoo Ensemble. The 3,910 kazooists played Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot; and the Dambusters March. This surpassed the previous record of 3,861 players, set in Sydney, Australia, in 2009. The current record of 5,190 was set later the same night in a second attempt.

On August 9, 2010, the San Francisco Giants hosted a Jerry Garcia tribute night, in which an ensemble of an estimated 9,000 kazooists played &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game.&quot;

<text>Cyril Jackson (1746–1819) was Dean of Christ Church, Oxford 1783–1809.

Jackson was born in Yorkshire, and educated at Manchester Grammar School, Westminster School and the University of Oxford. In 1771 he was chosen to be sub-preceptor to the two eldest sons of King George III, but in 1776 he was dismissed, probably through some household intrigues. He then took orders, and was appointed in 1779 to the preachership at Lincoln’s Inn and to a canonry at Christ Church, Oxford. In 1783 he was elected dean of Christ Church. His devotion to the college led him to decline the Bishopric of Oxford in 1799 (which was instead taken by his younger brother William) and the Primacy of All Ireland in 1800. He took a leading part in framing the statute which, in 1802, launched the system of public examinations at the University of Oxford, but otherwise he was not prominent in university affairs.

On his resignation in 1809 he settled at Felpham, in Sussex, where he remained till his death. He was buried in Felpham churchyard.

<text>Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos Sr. (September 11, 1917 – September 28, 1989) was a Filipino lawyer, politician, dictator, and kleptocrat who was the tenth president of the Philippines, ruling from 1965 to 1986. Marcos ruled the country under martial law from 1972 to 1981, enjoying expanded powers under the 1973 Constitution. Marcos described his philosophy as &quot;constitutional authoritarianism&quot; under his Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (New Society Movement). Widely regarded as the most controversial figure in Filipino history, Marcos&#x27;s regime was infamous for corruption, extravagance, and brutality. He was deposed by a nonviolent revolution in 1986. 

Marcos gained political success by exaggerating his actions in World War II, claiming to have been the &quot;most decorated war hero in the Philippines&quot;. — United States Army documents described his claims as &quot;fraudulent&quot; and &quot;absurd&quot;. After the war, he became a lawyer. He served in the Philippine House of Representatives from 1949 to 1959 and the Philippine Senate from 1959 to 1965. He was elected president in 1965. He presided over an economy that grew during the beginning of his 20-year rule, but ended in the loss of livelihood and extreme poverty for almost half the Philippine population, combined with a debt crisis. He pursued infrastructure development funded by foreign debt, making him popular during his first term, although the aid triggered an inflation crisis that led to social unrest in his second term. Marcos placed the Philippines under martial law on September 23, 1972, shortly before the end of his second term. Martial law was ratified in 1973 through a fraudulent referendum. The constitution was revised, media outlets were silenced, and violence and oppression were used against the political opposition, Muslims, suspected communists, and ordinary citizens.

After his election to a third term in the 1981 presidential election and referendum, Marcos&#x27;s popularity suffered due to the economic collapse that began in 1983 and the public outrage over the assassination of public opposition leader Senator Benigno &quot;Ninoy&quot; Aquino Jr. that year. This discontent, the resulting resurgence of the opposition in the 1984 parliamentary election, and the discovery of documents exposing his financial accounts and false war records led Marcos to call a snap election in 1986. Allegations of mass electoral fraud, political turmoil, and human rights abuses led to the People Power Revolution of February 1986, which ultimately removed him from power. To avoid what could have been a military confrontation in Manila between pro- and anti-Marcos troops, Marcos was advised by US president Ronald Reagan through Senator Paul Laxalt to &quot;cut and cut cleanly&quot;. Marcos then fled with his family to Hawaii. He was succeeded as president by Aquino&#x27;s widow, Corazon &quot;Cory&quot; Aquino. Many people who rose to power during the Marcos era remained in power after his exile, including Fidel Ramos, a general who became president.

According to source documents provided by the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), the Marcos family stole US$5 billion–$10 billion from the Central Bank of the Philippines. The PCGG also maintained that the Marcos family enjoyed a decadent lifestyle, taking billions of dollars from the Philippines between 1965 and 1986. His wife, Imelda Marcos, made infamous in her own right by excesses that characterized her and her husband&#x27;s &quot;conjugal dictatorship&quot;, is the source of the term . Two of their children, Imee and Bongbong, became active in Philippine politics, with Bongbong being elected president in 2022. Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos held the Guinness World Record for the largest-ever theft from a government for decades, although Guinness took the record down from their website while it underwent periodic review a few weeks before the 2022 Philippine presidential elections.

==Early life==

Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos was born on September 11, 1917, in the town of Sarrat, Ilocos Norte, to Mariano Marcos (1897–1945) and Josefa Edralin (1893–1988). Mariano Marcos was a lawyer and congressman from Ilocos Norte, Philippines. He was executed by Filipino guerillas in 1945 as a Japanese propagandist and collaborator during World War II. Drawn and quartered with the use of carabaos, his remains were left hanging on a tree. Josefa Marcos was a schoolteacher who outlived her husband – dying in 1988, two years after the Marcos family left her in Malacañang Palace, they fled into exile after the 1986 People Power Revolution, one year before her son Ferdinand&#x27;s death.

Marcos claimed that he was a descendant of Antonio Luna, a Filipino general during the Philippine–American War, a claim since debunked by genealogist Mona Magno-Veluz. He also claimed that his ancestor was a 16th-century pirate, Limahong (Chinese: 林阿鳳), who used to raid the coasts of the South China Sea. He is a Chinese mestizo descendant.

==Education==
Marcos studied law at the University of the Philippines (UP) in Manila, attending the College of Law. He excelled in both curricular and extra-curricular activities, joining the university&#x27;s swimming, boxing, and wrestling teams. He was an accomplished orator, debater, and writer for the student newspaper. While attending the UP College of Law, he joined Upsilon Sigma Phi, where he met his future colleagues in government and some of his staunchest critics.

Marcos attended the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) He served as an ROTC battalion commander and was commissioned as a third lieutenant (apprentice officer) in the Philippine Constabulary Reserve. He was a member of the rifle team and a national rifle champion.

When he sat for the 1939 Bar Examinations, he was a top scorer with a score of 92.35%. He graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; and was in the top ten of his class: future Chief Justice Felix Makasiar was their class salutatorian. He was elected to the Pi Gamma Mu and the Phi Kappa Phi international honor societies, the latter giving him its Most Distinguished Member Award 37 years later.

Marcos received an honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) (&quot;honoris causa&quot;) degree in 1967 from Central Philippine University.

== Julio Nalundasan assassination ==

Julio Nalundasan was a Filipino lawyer/politician and a political rival of Mariano Marcos&#x27;s. He was killed with a single rifle shot at his home in Batac on September 21, 1935, after the day after he had defeated Marcos a second time for a seat in the National Assembly.

In December 1938, Ferdinand Marcos, his father Mariano, and his uncles, Pio Marcos and Quirino Lizardo were both accused of murder. According to two witnesses, the four had conspired to assassinate Nalundasan.

Ferdinand was a member of the University of the Philippines rifle team and a national rifle champion. Marcos&#x27;s rifle was in its gun rack in the ROTC armory, that of team captain Teodoro M. Kalaw Jr. was missing.

The National Bureau of Investigation obtained evidence that Kalaw&#x27;s rifle was the murder weapon. Ferdinand had access to the armory. Ferdinand and Lizardo were then convicted of the murder. Ferdinand was sentenced to 10 to 17 years in prison.

Marcos appealed to the Supreme Court of the Philippines. Justice Jose P. Laurel, who wrote the majority decision, had almost killed a rival during a youthful brawl. He was convicted by a trial court of frustrated murder, but was acquitted after his own appeal to the Supreme Court. Laurel pleaded for his colleagues to acquit. The Supreme Court overturned the lower court decision on October 22, 1940, acquitting both men of all charges except contempt.

==World War II (1939–1945)==
==Post-WWII (1949–1965)==
After World War II, the American government became preoccupied with the Marshall Plan, attempting to revive Western European economies, losing focus on the Philippines, which gained independence on July 4, 1946. Marcos was one of eleven lawyers to act as a special prosecutor tasked to try by &quot;process of law and justice&quot; all those accused of collaboration with the Japanese. Eventually, Marcos ran for his father&#x27;s old post as representative of the 2nd district of Ilocos Norte and won three consecutive terms, serving in the House of Representatives from 1949 to 1959.

Marcos joined the &quot;Liberal Wing&quot; that split from the Nacionalista Party, which became the Liberal Party. He later became the Liberal Party&#x27;s economy spokesman, and chaired the House Neophytes Bloc which included future president Diosdado Macapagal, future Vice President Emmanuel Pelaez and future Manila Mayor Arsenio Lacson.

Marcos then became chairman of the House Committee on Commerce and Industry and member of the House Committees on Defense, Ways and Means; Industry; Banks Currency; War Veterans; Civil Service; and on Corporations and Economic Planning. He was also a member of the Special Committee on Import and Price Controls and the Special Committee on Reparations, and of the House Electoral Tribunal.

After serving in the House for three terms, Marcos won a Senate seat in 1959 and became Senate minority floor leader in 1960. He became executive vice president of the Liberal Party and served as party president from 1961 to 1964.

From 1963 to 1965, he was Senate President. He introduced significant bills, many of which were enacted.

===Presidential campaign===

Marcos ran a populist campaign emphasizing that he was a medalled war hero. In 1962, Marcos claimed to be the most decorated war hero of the Philippines by garnering almost every medal and decoration that the Filipino and American governments had established. Included in his claim of 27 war medals and decorations are those of the Distinguished Service Cross and the Medal of Honor. The opposition Liberal Party later confirmed that many of his war medals were awarded in 1962 to aid in his Senate election campaign. As a result, Marcos won the election.

==Administration and cabinet==

==First term (1965–1969)==
Marcos was inaugurated as the 10th president of the Philippines on December 30, 1965.

He launched an aggressive program of infrastructure development funded by foreign loans. He remained popular for most of his first term; although his popularity got flagged after debt-driven spending which triggered an inflationary crisis in November and December 1969. Major projects included the construction of the Cultural Center of the Philippines complex, Which is considered one of the earliest examples of what became known as the Marcoses&#x27; edifice complex.

Marcos developed close relations with Philippine military officers and began expanding the armed forces by allowing loyal generals to stay in their positions past retirement age, or giving them government posts. He gained the support of the US Johnson administration by allowing Philippine involvement in the Vietnam War via the Philippine Civic Action Group.

Marcos&#x27;s first term saw the exposé of the Jabidah massacre in March 1968, where Jibin Arula (a Muslim) testified that he had been the lone survivor of a group of Moro army recruits that had been executed en-masse on Corregidor island on March 18, 1968. The allegations became a major flashpoint that ignited the Moro insurgency.

===Defense expansion ===
One of President Marcos&#x27;s earliest initiatives was to significantly expand the Philippine military. In an unprecedented move, Marcos chose to concurrently serve as his own defense secretary, giving him direct control over the military. He significantly increased the defense budget, tapping them for civil projects such as school construction. Marcos&#x27; policies led Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. to accuse Marcos in 1968 of trying to establish &quot;a garrison state&quot;.

===Vietnam War===
Under intense pressure from the Johnson administration, Marcos reversed his prior position of not sending Philippine forces to Vietnam, consenting to limited involvement. He then asked Congress to approve sending a combat engineer unit. Despite opposition, the proposal was approved and Philippine troops were involved from the middle of 1966 as the Philippines Civic Action Group (PHILCAG). PHILCAG grew to a strength of some 1,600 troops in 1968. Between 1966 and 1970 over 10,000 Filipino soldiers served in Vietnam, mainly involved in civilian infrastructure projects.

===Loans for construction projects===

Attempting to become the first president of the third republic to be reelected, Marcos began taking massive foreign loans to fund the &quot;rice, roads, and school buildings&quot; he promised in his reelection campaign. With tax revenues inadequate to fund his 70% increase in infrastructure spending from 1966 to 1970, Marcos covered the gap with loans, creating a budget deficit 72% higher than the Philippine government&#x27;s annual deficit from 1961 to 1965.

The Marcos administration continued this loan-funded spending throughout his reign, producing economic instability that continued for decades. Marcos&#x27;s grandest first term infrastructure projects, especially the Cultural Center of the Philippines complex, marked the beginning of what critics would label his &quot;edifice complex&quot;.

===Jabidah exposé ===
In March 1968 Jibin Arula was fished out of Manila Bay, after he was shot. He was brought to then-Cavite Governor Delfin N. Montano, to whom he described the Jabidah massacre, saying that numerous Moro army recruits had been executed by members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) on March 18, 1968. This became the subject of an exposé by Senator Aquino.

Although the lack of other living witnesses hampered the probe, it ignited the Moro insurgency in the Philippines. Despite numerous trials and hearings, none of the officers implicated in the massacre were convicted, leading many Filipino Muslims to believe that the &quot;Christian&quot; government in Manila had little regard for them. This created a furor within the Philippine Muslim community, especially among educated youth, and among Muslim intellectuals, who had had no significant involvement in politics. The Jabidah massacre costed many Filipino Muslims their belief in opportunities for integration and accommodation.

This eventually led to the formation of the Mindanao Independence Movement in 1968, the Bangsamoro Liberation Organization (BMLO) was created in 1969, and the consolidation of these various forces into the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in October 1972.

===1969 campaign===
===Balance of payments crisis===
=== Informal diplomacy ===
Marcos engaged in unofficial diplomacy with the Soviet Bloc, shaped by the Sino-Soviet split. The Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930 (PKP-1930), was an officially illegal organization that had endorsed Marcos in 1965. The formation of the China-aligned Communist Party of the Philippines led to government support of the Soviet-aligned PKP-1930. Some PKP-1930 members were appointed to positions within Marcos&#x27;s government as salaried &quot;researchers&quot;. Their connections were used as another channel of negotiation with the Soviet Union.

==Second term (1969–1972)==

Marcos was reelected on November 11, 1969, in a landslide. He was the only Filipino president to win a second full term. His running mate, incumbent Vice President Fernando Lopez was also elected to a third full term as Vice President of the Philippines.

Marcos&#x27;s second term was characterized by social unrest, beginning with the balance of payments crisis. Opposition groups began to form, with &quot;moderate&quot; groups calling for political reform and &quot;radical&quot; groups espousing radical-left ideology.

Marcos responded with military force. The most notable was the response to protests during the first three months of 1970 – a period known as the First Quarter Storm.

Another major event was the Philippine Constitutional Convention of 1971. In May 1972, a delegate exposed a bribery scheme in which delegates were paid to vote with the Marcoses that implicated Imelda Marcos.

On August 21, 1971, a fatal bombing occurred at a political campaign rally of the opposition Liberal Party at Plaza Miranda in Quiapo, Manila. Marcos blamed the Communist Party of the Philippines. He issued Proclamation No. 889, through which he assumed emergency powers and suspended the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. Oppositionists were accused as &quot;radicals&quot; and were arrested. This response ignored any distinction between moderates and radicals, already blurred since the First Quarter storm. This brought about a massive expansion of the underground socialist resistance, leading many moderate oppositionists to join the radicals. In 1972 a series of bombings in Metro Manila occurred. Marcos again blamed the communists, although the only suspects caught were linked to the Philippine Constabulary.

Marcos&#x27;s second term effectively ended less than two years and nine months later, when Marcos established martial law.

===Social unrest after the balance of payments crisis===
Marcos&#x27;s spending during the campaign triggered growing public unrest, and led opposition figures such as Senator Lorenzo Tañada, Senator Jovito Salonga, and Senator Jose W. Diokno to accuse Marcos of wanting to stay in power beyond the two term constitutional limit.

Opposition groups quickly grew in the campuses.

====&quot;Moderate&quot; and &quot;radical&quot; opposition====
Media reports classified the various civil society groups opposing Marcos into either &quot;moderates&quot; or &quot;radicals&quot;. The moderates included church groups, civil libertarians, and nationalist politicians who wanted political reforms. Radicals included labor and student groups who wanted more systemic political reforms.

=====Moderates=====
Statesmen and politicians opposed to the increasingly authoritarian administration mostly focused their efforts on political efforts. Their concerns usually included election reform, calls for a non-partisan constitutional convention, and a call for Marcos to comply with the Constitutional term limit.

Proponents included the National Union of Students in the Philippines, the National Students League (NSL), and later the Movement of Concerned Citizens for Civil Liberties (MCCCL), led by Senator Jose W. Diokno.

MCCCL rallies were remembered for their diversity, attracting moderate and radical camps; and for their scale, attended by as many as 50,000 people.

=====Radicals=====
The other broad category of opposition groups were those who wanted more systemic political reforms, usually as part of the National Democracy movement. The Marcos administration included moderate groups under the radical umbrtella.

Groups considered radical by the media included:
* Kabataang Makabayan (KM)
* Samahang Demokratiko ng Kabataan (SDK)
* Student Cultural Association of the University of the Philippines (SCAUP)
* Movement for Democratic Philippines (MDP)
* Student Power Assembly of the Philippines (SPAP)
* Malayang Pagkakaisa ng Kabataang Pilipino (MPKP)

====Radicalization====
When Marcos became president, ine policy and politics functioned under a postwar geopolitical framework. The Philippines was caught up in the anti-communist scare perpetuated by the US during the Cold War. Marcos and the AFP claimed that the Communist Party of the Philippines was a threat, even though it was still a small organization. Richard J. Kessler claimed that Marcos &quot;mythologized the group, investing it with a revolutionary aura that only attracted more supporters&quot;.

The unrest of 1969 to 1970, and the violent reaction to the &quot;First Quarter Storm&quot; protests were watershed events in which Filipino students of the 1970s were radicalized against Marcos. Many students who had previously held &quot;moderate&quot; positions (i.e., calling for legislative reforms) became convinced that more radical social change was required.

Other events that radicalized moderates included the February 1971 Diliman Commune; the August 1971 suspension of the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; in the wake of the Plaza Miranda bombing; the September 1972 declaration of martial law; the 1980 murder of Macli-ing Dulag; and the August 1983 assassination of Ninoy Aquino.

By 1970, campus study sessions on Marxism–Leninism had become common, and many students joined organizations associated with the National Democracy Movement (ND), such as the Student Cultural Association of the University of the Philippines (SCAUP) and the Kabataang Makabayan (KM, lit. &quot;Patriotic Youth&quot;) founded by Jose Maria Sison; the Samahang Demokratiko ng Kabataan (SDK) was founded by a group of young writers.

The line between leftist activists and communists became blurred, as a significant number of radicalized activists joined the Communist Party of the Philippines. Radicalized activists from the cities began to be more extensively deployed in rural areas where some became guerillas.

===First Quarter Storm===
By the time Marcos gave his State of the Nation Address on January 26, 1970, demonstrations, protests, and marches had broken out. Moderate and radical student groups became the protests&#x27; driving force, which lasted until the end of the university semester in March 1970, and came to be known as the &quot;First Quarter Storm&quot;.

During Marcos&#x27;s address, the moderate National Union of Students of the Philippines organized a protest in front of Congress and invited student groups to join them. Some protesting students harangued Marcos as he and Imelda left the Congress building, throwing a coffin, a stuffed alligator, and stones at them.

The next major protest took place on January 30 in front of the presidential palace. Activists rammed through the gate with a fire truck and charged the Palace grounds tossing rocks, pillboxes, and Molotov cocktails. At least two activists were confirmed dead and several were injured by the police.

Five more major protests took place around Manila before March 17, 1970 – what some media accounts later branded the &quot;7 deadly protests of the First Quarter Storm&quot;. This included rallies on February 12; a February 18 rally that proceeded to the US Embassy where they set fire to the lobby; a &quot;Second People&#x27;s Congress&quot; demonstration on February 26; a &quot;People&#x27;s March&quot; on March 3; and the Second &quot;People&#x27;s March&quot; on March 17.

The protests ranged from 50,000 to 100,000 people. Students had declared a week-long boycott of classes and instead met to organize rallies.

Violent dispersals of protests radicalized Filipino students against the Marcos administration.

===Constitutional Convention of 1971===
Civil society groups and opposition leaders began campaigning in 1967 to initiate a constitutional convention. On March 16 that year, the Philippine Congress made itself into a Constituent Assembly and passed Resolution No. 2, which called for a Constitutional Convention.

Marcos was surprised by his critics by endorsing the move. Historians later noted that he was hoping the convention would allow presidents to serve for more than two terms.

A special election was held on November 10, 1970, to elect the convention delegates. The convention was convened on June 1, 1971, at Quezon City Hall. A total of 320 delegates were elected. The most prominent were former senators Raul Manglapus and Roseller T. Lim. Other delegates later became influential political figures, including Hilario Davide Jr., Marcelo Fernan, Sotero Laurel, Aquilino Pimentel Jr., Teofisto Guingona Jr., Raul Roco, Edgardo Angara, Richard Gordon, Margarito Teves, and Federico Dela Plana.

By 1972, the convention had become bogged down by politicking and delays. Its credibility fell further in May 1972 when a delegate exposed a bribery scheme in which delegates were paid to vote in favor of the Marcoses – First Lady Imelda Marcos became implicated in the alleged scheme.

The investigation was shelved when Marcos declared martial law in September 1972, and had 11 opposition delegates arrested. The remaining opposition delegates were forced to go either into exile or hiding. Within two months, an entirely new draft of the constitution was created by a special committee. The 1973 constitutional plebiscite was called to ratify the new constitution, but the validity of the ratification was brought to question because Marcos replaced secret ballot voting with a system of voting by &quot;citizen&#x27;s assemblies&quot;. The ratification of the constitution was challenged in the Ratification Cases.

===CPP New People&#x27;s Army===
On December 29, 1970, Philippine Military Academy instructor Lt. Victor Corpuz led New People&#x27;s Army rebels in a raid on the PMA armory, capturing rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, a bazooka and thousands of rounds of ammunition. In 1972, China, which was then actively supporting and arming communist insurgencies in Asia as part of Mao Zedong&#x27;s People&#x27;s War Doctrine, transported 1,200 M-14 and AK-47 rifles aboard the MV &quot;Karagatan&quot; for the NPA to aid its campaign to defeat the government.

===Rumored coup d&#x27;état and assassination plot===
A report by the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee said that shortly after the presidential election, a group composed mostly of retired colonels and generals organized a revolutionary junta with the aim of discrediting and killing Marcos. The group was headed by Eleuterio Adevoso, a Liberal Party official. A document given to the committee by a Philippine government official alleged that Vice President Fernando Lopez and Sergio, Osmena Jr. were key figures in the plot.

As early as December 1969 in a message from the US Ambassador to the US Assistant Secretary of State, the ambassador said that most of the talk about revolution and even assassination had been coming from the defeated opposition, of which Adevoso was a leading activist. He also said that his information on the assassination plans was &#x27;hard&#x27; (well-sourced) and he wanted it to reach President Marcos.

===Plaza Miranda bombing===

Unnamed former Communist Party officials alleged that &quot;the Communist party leadership planned – and three operatives carried out – the Plaza Miranda attack in an attempt to provoke government repression and push the country towards revolution&quot;. Communist leader Jose Maria Sison had calculated that Marcos could be provoked into cracking down on his opponents, thereby driving political activists into the underground, the anonymous former officials said. Recruits were urgently needed, they said, to make use of a large influx of weapons and financial aid that China had agreed to provide.&quot; Sison denied these claims. The CPP never offered official confirmation of its culpability. Marcos and his allies claimed that Benigno Aquino Jr. was part of the plot, denied by Sison.

Some historians claim Marcos was responsible for the Plaza Miranda bombing as he is known to have used false flag operations as a pretext for martial law. US intelligence documents declassified in the 1990s contained evidence implicating Marcos, provided by a CIA mole within the Philippine Army.

Another false flag attack took place with the attempted assassination of Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile in 1972. President Nixon approved Marcos&#x27;s subsequent martial law initiative.

===1971 suspension of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;===
On August 21, Marcos issued &quot;Proclamation No. 889&quot;, through which he assumed emergency powers and suspended the writ of &quot;habeas corpus.&quot;

Marcos&#x27;s act forced many members of the moderate opposition, such as Edgar Jopson, to join the radicals. In the aftermath of the bombing, Marcos lumped all of the opposition together and referred to them as communists. Many former moderates fled to the radicals&#x27; mountain encampments to avoid arrest by Marcos&#x27;s forces. Those disenchanted with the Marcos administration often joined the ranks of the radicals as the only group vocally opposing Marcos.

===1972 Manila bombings===
==Martial law era (1972–1981)==

On the evening of September 23, 1972, President declared martial law for the Philippines. This marked the beginning of a 14-year period of one-man rule lasting until Marcos went into exile on February 25, 1986. Even though martial law was formally lifted on January 17, 1981, Marcos retained virtually all of his powers until he was ousted by the EDSA Revolution. The first of these bombings took place on March 15, 1972, and the last took place on September 11, 1972, twelve days before martial law was announced on September 23 of that year.

Marcos&#x27;s declaration became known on September 23, 1972, when press secretary Francisco Tatad announced that Proclamation № 1081 would extend Marcos&#x27;s rule beyond the two-term constitutional limit. Ruling by decree, he almost dissolved press freedom and other civil liberties, closed down Congress and the media, and ordered the arrest of opposition leaders and militant activists, including Benigno Aquino Jr., Jovito Salonga and Jose W. Diokno. Marcos claimed that martial law was the prelude to creating his &quot;Bagong Lipunan&quot;, a &quot;New Society&quot; based on new social and political values.

The early years of martial law met public approval, as it was believed to have caused crime rates to drop.

===Arrests===
However, unlike Ninoy Aquino&#x27;s Senate colleagues who were detained without charges, Ninoy, together with communist NPA leaders Lt. Corpuz and Bernabe Buscayno, was charged with murder, illegal possession of firearms and subversion.

===&quot;Bagong Lipunan&quot; (New Society)===

One of Marcos&#x27; rationalizations for martial law stated that there was a need to &quot;reform society&quot; by placing it under the control of a &quot;benevolent dictator&quot; who could guide the undisciplined populace through a period of chaos. He referred to this social engineering exercise as the &quot;bagong lipunan&quot; or &quot;new society&quot;. His administration produced propaganda materials, including speeches, books, lectures, slogans, and numerous propaganda songs – to promote it.

According to Marcos&#x27;s book &quot;Notes on the New Society&quot;, his movement urged the poor and the privileged to work as one for the common goals of society and to achieve the liberation of the Filipino people through self-realization.

The Marcos regime instituted a youth organization, known as Kabataang Barangay, which was led by Marcos&#x27;s eldest daughter Imee. Presidential Decree 684, enacted in April 1975, encouraging youths aged 15 to 18 to go to camps and do volunteer work.

In October 1974, Marcos and PKP-1930 entered into a &quot;national unity agreement&quot; by which PKP-1930 would support New Society programs such as land reform, trade union reform, and including revitalized Soviet Bloc relations.

===Filipinization of Chinese schools===
To instill patriotism among Filipino citizens and prevent the growing number of Chinese schools from propagating foreign ideologies, Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 176, preventing educational institutions from being established exclusively for foreigners or from offering curriculum exclusively for foreigners. It restricted Chinese language instruction to not more than 100 minutes/day.

===1973 referendum===
Martial law was put to a vote in the 1973 Philippine martial law referendum which was marred with controversy resulting in 90.77% support.

===Rolex 12 and the military===
Along with Marcos, members of his Rolex 12 circle such as Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile, Chief of the Philippine Constabulary Fidel Ramos, and Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Fabian Ver were the chief administrators of martial law. The three remained Marcos&#x27; closest advisers until he was ousted. Peripheral members of the Rolex 12 included Eduardo &quot;Danding&quot; Cojuangco Jr. and Lucio Tan.

Between 1972 and 1976, Marcos increased the size of the Philippine military from 65,000 to 270,000 personnel, in response to South Vietnam falling into the hands of North Vietnam and other communist successes in South East Asia. Military officers were placed on the boards of media corporations, public utilities, development projects, and other private corporations, most of whom were highly educated graduates of the Philippine Military Academy. Marcos also supported the growth of a domestic weapons-manufacturing industry and increased military spending.

Many human rights abuses were attributed to the Philippine Constabulary then headed by future president Fidel V. Ramos. Marcos organized the Civilian Home Defense Force, precursor of Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Unit (CAFGU) to battle communist and Islamic insurgencies. It was accused of inflicting human right violations on leftists, the NPA, Muslim insurgents, and rebels.

===US foreign policy===
By 1977, the armed forces had quadrupled and over 60,000 Filipinos had been arrested for political reasons. In 1981, Vice President George H. W. Bush praised Marcos for his &quot;adherence to democratic principles and to the democratic processes&quot;. No American military or politician in the 1970s ever publicly questioned Marcos&#x27; authority to fight communism in South East Asia.

From the declaration of martial law in 1972 until 1983, the US government provided $2.5 billion in bilateral military and economic aid to Marcos, and about $5.5 billion through multilateral institutions such as the World Bank.

During the Carter administration (1977–1981) the relationship with the US had soured somewhat when Carter targeted the Philippines in his human rights campaign. Despite this, the Carter administration provided military aid to the Marcos regime.

A 1979 US Senate report stated that US officials were aware, as early as 1973, that Philippine government agents were in the United States to harass Filipino dissidents. In June 1981, two anti-Marcos labor activists were assassinated outside a union hall in Seattle. On at least one occasion, CIA agents blocked FBI investigations of Philippine agents. By 1984, US President Ronald Reagan started distancing himself from the Marcos regime that he and previous American presidents had strongly supported even during martial law. The United States, which had provided hundreds of millions of dollars in aid, was crucial in buttressing Marcos&#x27;s rule over the years,

===Switch from Taiwan to the People&#x27;s Republic of China===
Pre-Marcos, the Philippines had maintained a close relationship with Taiwan&#x27;s Kuomintang-ruled Republic of China (ROC) government. Prior administrations had seen the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) as a security threat, due to its financial and military support of communist rebels.

By 1969, however, Ferdinand Marcos started publicly asserting the need for the Philippines to establish a diplomatic relationship with the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In his 1969 State of the Nation Address, he said: 

In June 1975, President Marcos visited the PRC and signed a Joint Communiqué normalizing relations between the Philippines and China. Among other things, the Communiqué stated that &quot;there is but one China and that Taiwan is an integral part of Chinese territory...&quot; In turn, Chinese Prime Minister Zhou Enlai pledged that China would not intervene in the internal affairs of the Philippines nor seek to impose its policies in Asia, a move that isolated the local communist movement that China had financially and militarily supported.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot;, in an interview with former Philippine Communist Party officials, stated that, &quot;they (local communist party officials) wound up languishing in China for 10 years as unwilling &quot;guests&quot; of the (Chinese) government, feuding bitterly among themselves and with the party leadership in the Philippines&quot;.

The government subsequently captured NPA leaders Bernabe Buscayno in 1976 and Jose Maria Sison in 1977.

===1978 parliamentary election===
By 1977, reports of &quot;gross human rights violations&quot; had led to pressure from the international community. US President Jimmy Carter pressured the Marcos Administration to release Ninoy Aquino and to hold parliamentary elections to demonstrate that some &quot;normalization&quot; had begun after the declaration of martial law. Marcos did not release Aquino, but announced that the 1978 Philippine parliamentary election would be held.

The April 7 elections were for 166 (of the 208) regional representatives to the Interim Batasang Pambansa (parliament). The elections were contested by parties including Ninoy Aquino&#x27;s new party, the &quot;Lakas ng Bayan&quot; (LABAN) and the regime&#x27;s party known as the &quot;Kilusang Bagong Lipunan&quot; (KBL).

LABAN fielded 21 candidates for the Metro Manila area including Ninoy, activist Jerry Barican, labor leader Alex Boncayao, Neptali Gonzales, Teofisto Guingona Jr. Ramon Mitra Jr., Aquilino Pimentel Jr., journalist Napoleon Rama, publisher Alejandro Roces, and poet-playwright Francisco Rodrigo.

Irregularities noted during the election included &quot;prestuffed ballot boxes, phony registration, &#x27;flying voters&#x27;, manipulated election returns, and vote buying&quot;, and LABAN&#x27;s campaigning faced restrictions, including Marcos&#x27;s refusal to let Aquino out of prison to campaign. All of the party&#x27;s candidates, including Aquino, lost.

Marcos&#x27;s KBL party won 137 seats, while Pusyon Bisaya led by future Minority Floor Leader Hilario Davide Jr., won 13 seats.

===Prime minister===
In 1978, Ferdinand Marcos became Prime Minister of the Philippines, marking the return of the position for the first time since the terms of Pedro Paterno and Jorge Vargas during the American occupation. Based on &quot;Article 9&quot; of the 1973 constitution, it had broad executive powers typical of prime ministers in other countries. The position was the official head of government, and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. All of the previous powers of the President from the 1935 Constitution were transferred to the prime minister. The prime minister also acted as head of the National Economic Development Authority. Upon his re-election to the presidency in 1981, Marcos was succeeded as prime minister by an American-educated leader and Wharton graduate, Cesar Virata, who was elected as an Assemblyman (Member of the Parliament) from Cavite in 1978.

===Proclamation 2045===
After amending the constitution and enacting legislative, Marcos issued Proclamation 2045, which lifted martial law, on January 17, 1981, without restoring &quot;habeas corpus&quot; for rebellion and subversion-related crimes. The lifting of martial law was synchronized with the election of US President Ronald Reagan and the visit of Pope John Paul II, to get support from Reagan and minimize Papal criticism.

==Third term (1981–1986)==

On June 16, 1981, six months after lifting martial law, the first presidential election in twelve years was held. President Marcos ran while the major opposition parties, the United Nationalists Democratic Organizations (UNIDO), a coalition of opposition parties and LABAN, boycotted the election. Marcos won a massive victory.

Marcos&#x27; third inauguration took place on Tuesday, June 30, 1981, at the Quirino Grandstand in Manila. Then U.S. Vice President George H. W. Bush, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, future President of China Yang Shangkun and Thai Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda attended. At the inauguration, Bush had infamous praise for Marcos: &quot;We love your adherence to democratic principles and to the democratic process.&quot;

===Armed conflict with the CPP–NPA===
Under martial law the Communist Party of the Philippines and the New People&#x27;s army was a period of significant growth. This continued into the 1980s. The NPA established itself in urban areas while the NDF formed relationships with legal opposition organizations – all despite Marcos&#x27; claims in January 1981 that the conflict had been &quot;substantially contained&quot;. The killing of key leaders in Davao city in the opening years of the 1980s led the administration to claim that the CPP &quot;backbone&quot; in the south had broken,&quot; But the remaining leaders soon began to experiment with new tactics including urban insurrection, leading the international press to label Davao City as the &quot;Killing Fields&quot;, and as &quot;the Philippines&#x27; &#x27;Murder Capital&#x27;&quot;. The violence reached its peak in 1985 with 1,282 military and police deaths and 1,362 civilian deaths.

===Recession===
The Marcos administration&#x27;s spending had relied heavily on debt since Marcos&#x27;s first term in the 60s. This left the Philippines vulnerable when high inflation caused the US to raise interest rates from 1980 to 1982, which caused US recessions in 1980 and 1981. The Philippine economy went into decline in 1981. Economic and political instability combined to produce the worst recession in Philippine history in 1984 and 1985, with the economy contracting by 7.3% for two successive years and poverty incidence at 49%.

===Aquino assassination===

On August 21, 1983, opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr. was assassinated on the tarmac at Manila International Airport. He had returned to the Philippines after three years in exile in the United States, where he had a heart bypass operation after Marcos allowed him to leave the Philippines to seek medical care. Prior to his heart surgery, Ninoy, along with his two co-accused, NPA leaders Bernabe Buscayno (Commander Dante) and Lt. Victor Corpuz, were sentenced to death by a military commission on charges of murder, illegal possession of firearms and subversion.

A few months before his assassination, Ninoy had decided to return to the Philippines after his research fellowship from Harvard University ended. The opposition blamed Marcos directly for the assassination while others blamed the military and Imelda Marcos. Popular speculation pointed to three suspects; the first was Marcos himself through his military chief Fabian Ver; the second theory pointed to Imelda, who had her own designs now that her ailing husband seemed to be getting weaker, and the third was that Danding Cojuangco planned the assassination to serve his own political ambitions. The 1985 acquittals of Ver as well as other high-ranking military officers charged with the crime were widely seen as a whitewash and a miscarriage of justice.

On November 22, 2007, Pablo Martinez, one of the soldiers convicted in the Aquino assassination, alleged that Marcos crony Danding Cojuangco had ordered the assassination while Marcos was recuperating from his kidney transplant. Cojuangco was the cousin of Aquino&#x27;s wife Corazon Cojuangco Aquino. Martinez alleged that only he and Galman knew of the assassination, and that Galman was the actual shooter, which is not corroborated by other evidence.

After the February 1986 People Power revolution swept Aquino&#x27;s widow to the presidency, the Supreme Court ordered a reinvestigation of the assassination. The Sandiganbayan convicted 16 military personnel for the murder, ruling that Constable 1st Class Rogelio Moreno, one of the military escorts assigned to Aquino, &quot;fired the fatal shot&quot; that killed Aquino, not Galman.

===Impeachment attempt===
In August 1985, 56 Assemblymen signed a resolution calling for the impeachment of President Marcos for alleged diversion of US aid for personal use, citing a July 1985 &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; exposé of the Marcos&#x27;s multimillion-dollar US investments and property holdings.

The properties included the Crown Building, Lindenmere Estate, residential apartments, a shopping center, mansions (in London, Rome, and Honolulu), the Helen Knudsen Estate, and three condominiums.

The Assembly included in the complaint the misuse and misapplication of funds &quot;for the construction of the Manila Film Center, where X-rated and pornographic films are exhibited, contrary to public morals and Filipino customs and traditions.&quot; The impeachment attempt gained little traction, however, even in the light of this incendiary charge; the committee to which the impeachment resolution was referred did not recommend it, and any momentum for removing Marcos under constitutional processes soon died.

===Physical decline===
During his third term, Marcos&#x27;s health deteriorated rapidly due to kidney ailments, as a complication of a chronic autoimmune disease &quot;lupus erythematosus&quot;. He had a kidney transplant in August 1983, and when his body rejected the first kidney transplant, he underwent a second transplant in November 1984. A palace physician who alleged that during one of these periods Marcos had undergone a kidney transplant was shortly afterwards found murdered. Police said he was kidnapped and slain by communist rebels. Many people questioned whether Marcos had capacity to govern, due to his illness and the burgeoning political unrest. With Marcos ailing, Imelda emerged as the government&#x27;s main public figure.

==Economic performance==
==Snap election, People Power Revolution, and ouster (1986) ==

===1986 snap election===

In late 1985, in the face of escalating public discontent and under pressure from foreign allies, Marcos called a snap election with more than a year left in his term. He selected Arturo Tolentino as his running mate. The opposition to Marcos united behind two American-educated leaders, Aquino&#x27;s widow, Corazon, and her running mate, Salvador Laurel.

Marcos&#x27;s World War II medals were first questioned by the foreign press during this campaign. During a campaign in Manila&#x27;s Tondo district, Marcos retorted:

Marcos was referring to both presidential candidate Corazon Aquino&#x27;s father-in-law Benigno Aquino Sr. and vice presidential candidate Salvador Laurel&#x27;s father, former president José P. Laurel.

The elections were held on February 7, 1986. The official election canvasser, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), declared Marcos the winner. The final tally of the COMELEC had Marcos winning with 10,807,197 votes against Aquino&#x27;s 9,291,761 votes. On the other hand, the partial 69% tally of the National Movement for Free Elections (NAMFREL), an accredited poll watcher, had Aquino winning with 7,502,601 votes against Marcos&#x27;s 6,787,556 votes. Cheating was reported on both sides. This electoral exercise was marred by widespread reports of violence and election tampering.

The fraud culminated in the walkout of 35 COMELEC computer technicians to advance their claim that the official election results were manipulated to favor Ferdinand Marcos, according to their testimonies, which were never validated. The walkout was led by Linda Kapunan and the technicians were protected by Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM) officers led by her husband, Lt. Col. Eduardo &quot;Red&quot; Kapunan.

In the last months of Marcos&#x27;s administration, the Soviet Union stepped up relations and was the only major country to officially congratulate Marcos on his disputed election victory. Marcos had provided favors to the Soviets such as allowing the banned Philippine Communist Party to visit the Soviet Union for consultations. A UPI article from March 1986 reported, &quot;Diplomats in Moscow believe the Soviet government totally misjudged Marcos&#x27; power to control events. They speculate that Moscow considered his control of legal bodies and his readiness to be &#x27;ruthless&#x27; would thwart any popular opposition.&quot;

===1986 RAM coup and People Power Revolution===

The election gave a decisive boost to the &quot;People Power movement&quot;. Enrile and Ramos later abandoned Marcos, switched sides and sought protection behind the 1986 People Power Revolution, backed by fellow-American educated Eugenio Lopez Jr., Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, and the old political and economic elites. RAM, led by Lt. Col. Gregorio &quot;Gringo&quot; Honasan and backed by Enrile had plotted a coup d&#x27;état to seize Malacañang and kill Marcos and his family.

At the height of the revolution, Enrile claimed that a purported ambush attempt against him years earlier was in fact faked, in order for Marcos to have a pretext for imposing martial law. Enrile later retracted this statement, and in 2012, he claimed that the ambush was real. Marcos continually maintained that he was the duly elected president for a fourth term, but unfairly and illegally deprived of his right to serve it. On February 25, 1986, rival presidential inaugurations were held, but as Aquino supporters overran parts of Manila and seized state broadcaster PTV-4, Marcos was forced to flee.

==Exile in Hawaii (1986–1989)==
===Fleeing to Hawaii===
At 15:00 PST (GMT+8) on February 25, 1986, Marcos talked to United States Senator Paul Laxalt, a close associate of President Reagan, asking for advice. Laxalt advised him to &quot;cut and cut cleanly&quot;, to which Marcos expressed his disappointment. In the afternoon, Marcos talked to Enrile, asking for safe passage for him and his family, including close allies such as General Ver. Finally, at 9:00 p.m., the Marcos family was transported by four Sikorsky HH-3E helicopters to Clark Air Base in Angeles City, about 83 kilometers north of Manila, before boarding US Air Force C-130 planes bound for Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, and finally to Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii where Marcos arrived on February 26. He also brought with him 22 crates of cash valued at $717 million, 300 crates of assorted jewelry, $4 million worth of unset precious gems, 65 Seiko and Cartier watches, a 12 by 4 ft box full of pearls, a 3 ft solid gold statue covered in diamonds and other precious stones, $200,000 in gold bullion, nearly $1 million in Philippine pesos, and deposit slips to banks in the United States, Switzerland, and the Cayman Islands worth $124 million.

Initially, there was confusion in Washington as to what to do with Marcos and the 90 members of his entourage. Given the special relations Marcos nurtured with Reagan, the former had expectations of favorable treatment. However, Reagan kept his distance. The State Department in turn assigned former Deputy Chief of Mission to Manila, Robert G. Rich Jr. to be the point of contact. The entourage were first billeted inside the housing facilities of Hickam Air Force Base. The State Department announced the Marcoses were not immune from legal charges, and within weeks hundreds of cases had been filed against them.

Throughout his stay in Hawaii, he and his family enjoyed a high life, living in a luxurious house in Makiki Heights, as Imelda entertained guests at parties, while Filipinos back in the Philippines suffered under the debt Marcos incurred.

When protestors stormed Malacañang Palace shortly after their departure, it was notoriously discovered that Imelda had left behind over 2,700 pairs of shoes. The protesters looted and vandalized the palace, many stole documents, jewelry, food, typewriters, etc.

The Catholic hierarchy and Manila&#x27;s middle class were crucial to the success of the revolution. Contrary to the widely-held notion that the protests were limited to Manila, protests against Marcos also occurred in the provinces and on the islands of Visayas and Mindanao.

===Plans to return and &quot;The Marcos Tapes&quot;===
More than a year after the revolution, it was revealed to the United States House Foreign Affairs subcommittee in 1987 that Marcos held an intention to return to the Philippines and overthrow the Aquino government. American attorney Richard Hirschfeld and business consultant Robert Chastain, both of whom posed as arms dealers, gained knowledge of a plot by gaining Marcos&#x27;s trust and secretly recorded their conversations with the ousted leader.

According to Hirschfeld, he was first invited by Marcos to a party held at the latter&#x27;s family residence in Honolulu. After hearing that one of Hirschfeld&#x27;s clients was Saudi Sheikh Mohammad Fassi, Marcos&#x27;s interest was piqued because he had done business with Saudis in the past. A few weeks later, Marcos asked for help with securing a passport from another country, in order to travel to the Philippines while bypassing travel restrictions imposed by the Philippines and United States governments. This failed, however, and subsequently Marcos asked Hirschfeld to arrange a $10-million loan from Fassi.

On January 12, 1987, Marcos stated to Hirschfeld that he required another $5-million loan &quot;in order to pay 10,000 soldiers $500 each as a form of &quot;combat life insurance&quot;. When asked by Hirschfeld if he was talking about an invasion of the Philippines, Marcos responded, &quot;Yes&quot;. Hirschfeld stated that Marcos said that he was negotiating with several arms dealers to purchase up to $18 million worth of weapons, including tanks and heat-seeking missiles, and enough ammunition to &quot;last an army three months&quot;.

Marcos had thought of flying to his hometown in Ilocos Norte and initiating a plot to kidnap Corazon Aquino. &quot;What I would like to see happen is we take her hostage&quot;, Marcos told Chastain. &quot;Not to hurt her ... no reason to hurt her ... to take her.&quot;

Learning of this plan, Hirschfeld contacted the US Department of Justice, and was asked for further evidence. This information eventually reached President Ronald Reagan, who placed Marcos under &quot;island arrest&quot;, further limiting his movement.

===Legal cases===
Within two weeks of his arrival to the United States, hundreds of criminal and civil cases against the Marcos clique were filed in Hawaii, San Francisco, and New York. Marcos made personal appeals to Reagan to put a stop to these cases. In June 1988 National Security Advisor Colin Powell recommended proceeding with indictments of the Marcoses, as he reviewed the cases as forwarded by United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York Rudy Giuliani. Reagan tacitly approved. On August 4, Marcos stated that he had head of state immunity to resist the subpoenas by a federal grand jury to produce his finger and palm prints, and failed to consent to investigators to review his bank accounts. By August 18, a bench warrant of arrest was issued against the Marcoses. By October that year, Reagan personally wrote to Marcos informing him that he believed his innocence of the charges against him, but reminding him that the case was out of his hands. He assured him that they would have every opportunity to prove their innocence.

Giuliani pressed for indicting the Marcoses for violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering and allows the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes they ordered others to do or assisted them in doing. For example, before RICO, a person who instructed someone else to murder could be exempt from prosecution because they did not personally commit the crime. In his next letter to President Reagan on October 20, Marcos complained that Giuliani was giving them nothing but an ultimatum to plead guilty, and even to testify against others, including his own family.

== Personal life ==
Ferdinand was baptized and raised into the Philippine Independent Church.

Marcos lived with a common-law wife, Carmen Ortega, an Ilocana mestiza who was 1949 Miss Press Photography. They had three children and resided for about two years at 204 Ortega Street in San Juan. In August 1953, their engagement was announced in Manila dailies.

Not much is known about what happened to Ortega and their children. He subsequently converted to Catholicism in later life to marry Imelda Trinidad Romualdez. They married on April 17, 1954, 11 days after they first met. They had three biological children: Imee, Bongbong and Irene Marcos. Marcos&#x27;s fourth child with Ortega was born after his marriage to Imelda. Marcos and Imelda later adopted a daughter, Aimee.

Marcos had an affair with American actress Dovie Beams from 1968 to 1970. According to reports by the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, Marcos also had an affair with former &quot;Playboy&quot; model Evelin Hegyesi around 1970 and sired a child with her, Analisa Josefa.

==Death and burial==

Marcos was admitted to the hospital on January 15, 1989, with pneumonia and underwent a series of operations. In his dying days, Marcos was visited by Vice President Salvador Laurel. During the visit, Marcos offered to return 90% of his ill-gotten wealth to the Filipino people in exchange for burial in the Philippines beside his mother, an offer also disclosed to Enrique Zobel. However, Marcos&#x27;s offer was rebuffed by the Aquino government and by Imelda.

Marcos died at St. Francis Medical Center in Honolulu at 12:40 a.m (HST) on September 28, 1989, of kidney, heart, and lung ailments, 17 days after his 72nd birthday. Moments after, the younger Ferdinand eulogised his late father by stating, &quot;Hopefully friends and detractors alike will look beyond the man to see what he stood for: his vision, his compassion and his total love of country&quot;.

Marcos was interred in a private mausoleum at Byodo-In Temple on the island of Oahu.

The Aquino government refused to allow Marcos&#x27;s body to be brought back to the Philippines, which ultimately happened four years later.

From 1993 to 2016, Marcos&#x27;s remains were interred inside a refrigerated, frozen crypt in Batac, Ilocos Norte, where his son, Ferdinand Jr., and eldest daughter, Imee, became the local governor and congressional representative, respectively.

A large bust of Ferdinand Marcos (inspired by Mount Rushmore) was commissioned by the tourism minister, Jose Aspiras, and carved into a hillside in Benguet. It was subsequently destroyed, allegedly by left-wing activists, members of a local tribe who had been displaced by construction of the monument, and looters hunting for the legendary Yamashita treasure.On November 18, 2016, his remains were reburied at the Libingan ng mga Bayani ordered by President Rodrigo Duterte despite opposition from various groups. On the morning of November 18, using Philippine Armed Forces helicopters, his family and their supporters flew his remains from Ilocos to Manila for a private burial. This account was challenged and the physical location of his remains is disputed. Various groups protested the burial.

==Trials and reparations==

===&quot;Roxas v. Marcos&quot;===
Rogelio Roxas, a Filipino treasure hunter, discovered a 3-foot-tall golden Buddha statue in tunnels under the Baguio General Hospital in 1971. Roxas was later arrested and tortured by members of the military, and the statue was taken away. Upon exile of the Marcoses, Roxas assigned his rights to a friend in the United States and formed the Golden Buddha Corporation (GBC) who pursued the case against the former president. In 1996, the lower court awarded US$22 billion in favor of GBC, making this the largest award in a civil case in US history. In November 1998, the Hawaii Supreme Court overturned the ruling, but maintained an award of US$6 million for the illegal arrest and torture experienced by Roxas.

===Sandiganbayan, Supreme Court, and international trials===
On November 9, 2018, Imelda Marcos was found &quot;guilty beyond reasonable doubt&quot; by the Sandiganbayan of seven counts of graft for private organizations set up in Switzerland during her time as a government official from 1968 to 1986. In less than 20 days however, the Sandiganbayan listed Imelda&#x27;s &quot;advanced age&quot; and health condition as considerations for allowing the accused to post bail. The Fifth Division&#x27;s (of the Sandiganbayan) ruling read that &quot;the fact that she is of advanced age and for health reasons, consistent with the doctrine in Enrile vs Sandiganbayan, bail is allowed for these seven cases&quot;. The Supreme Court of the Philippines affirmed that the family&#x27;s assets, beyond their government salaries, are considered as ill-gotten wealth. In 1998 the Court acquitted Imelda Marcos of corruption charges from a previous graft conviction in 1993.

The US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed a contempt judgement in relation to the assets of Imelda and her son Bongbong. Although on a different matter, this judgement awarded $353.6 million to human rights victims, which was arguably the largest contempt award ever affirmed by an appellate court.

===Reparations===
In 1995, some 10,000 Filipinos won a US class-action lawsuit filed against the Marcos estate. The claims were filed by victims or their surviving relatives consequent on torture, execution, and disappearances.

The Swiss government, initially reluctant to respond to allegations that stolen funds were held in Swiss accounts, returned $684 million of Marcos&#x27; holdings.

Corazon Aquino repealed many of the repressive laws enacted during Marcos&#x27;s dictatorship. She restored the right of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, repealed anti-labor laws and freed hundreds of political prisoners.

From 1989 to 1996, a series of suits were brought before US courts against Marcos and his daughter Imee, alleging that they bore responsibility for executions, torture, and disappearances. A jury in the Ninth Circuit Court awarded US$2 billion to the plaintiffs and to a class composed of human rights victims and their families. On June 12, 2008, in &quot;Republic of Philippines v. Pimentel&quot; the US Supreme Court ruled 7–2 that, &quot;The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions to order the District Court to dismiss the interpleader action.&quot; The court dismissed the interpleader lawsuit filed to determine the rights of 9,500 Filipino human rights victims (1972–1986) to recover US$35 million, part of a US$2 billion judgment in US courts against the Marcos estate, because the Philippines government is an indispensable party, protected by sovereign immunity. The Philippines government claimed ownership of the funds transferred by Marcos in 1972 to Arelma S.A., which invested the money with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc., in New York. In July 2017, the Philippine Court of Appeals rejected the petition seeking to enforce the United States court decision.

In 2013, Philippine Congress passed Republic Act 10368 or the Human Rights Victims Reparation and Recognition Act of 2013. The law created the Human Rights Violations Claims Board and provided reparations to victims of summary execution, torture, enforced disappearances, and other human rights violations. Compensation came from P10 billion of stolen wealth seized by the government from the Marcoses. A total of 11,103 victims received compensation in 2018. A bill filed in Congress in 2020 proposed to compensate tens of thousands of people still not officially recognized as victims of state-sponsored violence.

==Legacy==
Marcos left an legacy of debt, hardship, and repression.

===Human rights abuses===
The Marcos regime committed human rights abuses against a long list of opponents. These included student activists such as Edgar Jopson and Rigoberto Tiglao, farmers such as Bernabe Buscayno, journalists such as Satur Ocampo, legal political opponents such as Ninoy Aquino, fellow candidates such as Alex Boncayao, and priests and nuns. Victims were commonly accused of supporting communist rebels or other leftists, or of joining or sympathizing with the CPP, NPA, or MNLF. Victims were rounded up without an arrest warrant and indefinitely detained without charge. In a keynote speech at the University of the East, journalist Raissa Robles described how anyone could be arrested (or abducted) with ease through Arr est Search and Seizure Orders (ASSO), which allowed the military or police to detain anyon,e according to Rappler research.

A 1976 Amnesty International report listed 88 government torturers, including members of the Philippine Constabulary and the Philippine Army, which was under the direct control of Major General Ramos and Defense Minister Enrile. According to Rigoberto Tiglao, nearly all of the human rights abuses were committed by Philippine Constabulary units, especially through its national network of &quot;Constabulary Security Units&quot;, whose heads reported directly to Ramos. The most dreaded of these was the Manila-based 5th Constabulary Security Unit (CSU), which featured dreaded torturer Lt. Rodolfo Aguinaldo, which was credited with capturing most of the Communist Party leaders including Sison and the Manila-Rizal Regional Committee he headed; the Metrocom Intelligence and Security Group (MISG) under the command of Col. Rolando Abadilla; and the Intelligence Service (ISAFP).

The various estimates of the scale of abuses include:

Task Force Detainees of the Philippines (TFDP)
* 2,668 incidents of arrests
* 398 disappearances
* 1,338 &quot;salvagings&quot;
* 128 frustrated &quot;salvagings&quot;
* 1,499 killed or wounded in massacres

Amnesty International
* 70,000 imprisoned
* 34,000 tortured
* 3,240 documented as killed

Historian Alfred McCoy gives a figure of 3,257 recorded extrajudicial killings by the military from 1975 to 1985, 35,000 tortured and 70,000 incarcerated.

&quot;Bulatlat&quot; newspaper

* 120,000 victims of arbitrary arrest and detention
* 1,500 extrajudicial execution of activists under martial law

Human rights group &quot;Karapatan&quot;

* 759 involuntarily disappeared with their bodies never found.

Susan Quimpo, co-author of &quot;Subversive Lives&quot;

* 80,000 was a low figure for the number of persons incarcerated

In addition to these, up to 10,000 Moro Muslims were killed in massacres by the Philippine Army, Philippine Constabulary, and the Ilaga pro-government paramilitary group.

====Abductions====

Victims were often taken to military &quot;safehouses&quot; where abductees were tortured, often blindfolded. In a document titled &quot;Open Letter to the Filipino People&quot;, martial law martyr Edgar &quot;Edjop&quot; Jopson described them: &quot;Safehouses usually have their windows always shut tight. They are usually covered with high walls. One would usually detect [safehouses] through the traffic of motorcycles and cars, going in and out of the house at irregular hours. Burly men, armed with pistols tucked in their waists or in clutch bags, usually drive these vehicles.&quot;

Various forms of torture were used by the military, typically in combination.

====Killings====


Summary executions were common. Bodies were often recovered bearing signs of torture and mutilation. Such cases were referred to as &quot;salvaging&quot; a term widely believed to be derived from the Spanish word &quot;salvaje&quot;, meaning &quot;savage&quot;. Mutilated remains were often dumped on roadsides in order to instill fear and to intimidate opponents.

Anyone could be &quot;salvaged&quot;: communists, suspects, innocent civilians and priests included. TFDP documented 1,473 &quot;salvage&quot; cases from 1980 to 1984 alone.

Victims included Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila student Liliosa Hilao, Archimedes Trajano, Juan Escandor, and 16-year-old Luis Manuel &quot;Boyet&quot; Mijares, whose body was found with burn marks, all his nails removed, 33 ice pick wounds, skull crushed, eyeballs gouged out, and genitals mutilated before he was dropped from a helicopter.

Enforced disappearances, also known as &quot;desaparecidos&quot; or &quot;the disappeared&quot; – people who suddenly went missing, sometimes without a trace and whose bodies were never recovered.

Victims include Primitivo &quot;Tibo&quot; Mijares, Emmanuel Alvarez, Albert Enriquez, Ma. Leticia Ladlad, Hermon Lagman, Mariano Lopez, Rodelo Manaog, Manuel Ontong, Florencio Pesquesa, Arnulfo Resus, Rosaleo Romano, Carlos Tayag, Emmanuel Yap, Jan Quimpo, Rizalina Ilagan, Christina Catalla, Jessica Sales and Ramon Jasul.

While the numbers of political detainees went down, the number of people killed rose and spiked in 1981, the year martial law was officially lifted by Marcos according to Task Force Detainees of the Philippines. According to Senator Jose W. Diokno, &quot;As torture (cases) declined, a more terrible tactic emerged; unofficial executions&quot; – suspected dissidents were simply arrested and vanished.

Murder victims include:
* Senator Ninoy Aquino, August 21, 1983, who was assassinated on the tarmac of Manila International Airport
* NPA commander Alex Boncayao,
* Macli-ing Dulag,
* Fr. Tulio Favali,
* Liliosa Hilao,
* Evelio Javier,
* Edgar Jopson,
* Emmanuel &quot;Eman&quot; Lacaba.

=====Civilian massacres=====

It is hard to judge the full extent of massacres and atrocities that happened during the Marcos regime due to heavy press censorship at the time. Civilian massacres include the following:
=====Muslim massacres=====
Thousands of Moros were killed during the Marcos regime. They formed insurgent groups and separatist movements such as the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), which became more radical with time. The Marcos regime killed hundreds of Moros before imposing martial law. The number of Moro victims killed by the Army, Philippine Constabulary, and the Ilaga (a government-sanctioned terrorist cult notorious for cannibalism and land grabbing that served as members of the CHDF) reached as high as 10,000 lives. 
====Family denial====
Marcos family members deny any human rights violations.

Bongbong Marcos describes stories of human rights abuses as &quot;self-serving statements by politicians, self-aggrandizement narratives, pompous declarations, and political posturing and propaganda.&quot;

Imee called allegations political accusations. According to her, &quot;If what is demanded is an admission of guilt, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s possible. Why would we admit to something we did not do?&quot;

===Ill-gotten wealth ===

In 2012, the Philippine Supreme Court ruled all Marcos assets beyond legally declared earnings/salary to be ill-gotten wealth and such wealth to have been forfeited to the government or human rights victims.

According to the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCOG), the Marcos family and their cronies looted so much wealth from the Philippines that investigators have not determined precisely how many billions were stolen. PCOG estimated that Marcos stole around $5 billion to $10 billion, while earning an annual salary equivalent to US$13,500.

Among the sources of the Marcos wealth are alleged to be diverted foreign aid, military aid (including to Marcos for sending Filipino troops to Vietnam) and kickbacks from public works contracts.

In 1990, Imelda Marcos was acquitted of charges that she raided the Philippine&#x27;s treasury by a US jury. She was acquitted because the jury deemed that US did not have jurisdiction. In 1993, she was convicted of graft in Manila for entering into three unfavourable lease contracts between a government-run transportation agency and another government-run hospital. In 1998, the Philippine Supreme Court overturned her conviction. In 2008, Philippine trial court judge Silvino Pampilo acquitted Imelda of 32 counts of illegal money transfer from the 1993 graft conviction. In 2010, she was ordered to repay the Philippine government almost $280,000 for funds taken in 1983. In 2012, a US Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit upheld a contempt judgement against Imelda and Bongbong for violating an injunction barring them from dissipating their assets, and awarded $353.6 million to human rights victims. As of October 2015, she faced 10 graft charges, and 25 civil cases, down from 900 in the 1990s, as most cases were dismissed for lack of evidence.

In the 2004 &quot;Global Corruption Report&quot;, Marcos appeared in the list of the world&#x27;s most corrupt leaders, behind Suharto. One of Marcos&#x27;s former Ministers of industry, Vicente Paterno, noted that while the amount stolen by Marcos&#x27;s regime probably fell short of Suharto, Marcos invested outside the Philippines, whereas Suharto mostly invested at home.

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists&#x27; (ICIJ) exposé of offshore leaks accused Imee of hiding wealth in tax havens in the British Virgin Islands.

In 2014, Imelda&#x27;s former secretary Vilma Bautista was sentenced to prison for conspiring to sell a Monet, Sisley, and other masterpieces.

On May 9, 2016, ICIJ released the Panama Papers. Imee and Irene were named, along grandsons Fernando Manotoc, Matthew Joseph Manotoc, and Ferdinand Richard Manotoc, his son-in-law Gregorio Maria Araneta III, including his son-in-law Tommy Manotoc&#x27;s relatives Ricardo Gabriel Manotoc and Teodoro Kalaw Manotoc.

On September 3, 2017, then President Rodrigo Duterte said the Marcos family was ready to transfer their wealth to the government. In January 2018, a draft House Bill proposing a settlement and immunity for the Marcoses was received by the Duterte government in July 2017.

====Overseas investments ====
===Monopolies===
===Infrastructure and edifices===

Marcos projected himself to the public as building vast construction projects, and his record upholds that reputation. A 2011 study Marcos was the president who spent the most on infrastructure in terms of annual spending. Most of these projects were paid with foreign currency loans at great cost to taxpayers.

Projects included hospitals such as the Philippine Heart Center, Lung Center, and Kidney Center, transportation infrastructure like San Juanico Bridge (formerly Marcos Bridge), Pan-Philippine Highway, North Luzon Expressway, South Luzon Expressway, and Manila Light Rail Transit (LRT). Cultural and heritage sites included the Cultural Center of the Philippines], Nayong Pilipino, Philippine International Convention Center and the ill-fated Manila Film Center were built as well.

This focus on infrastructure eventually earned the label &quot;edifice complex&quot;.

Marcos&#x27; spending on construction has been claimed to be intended to position Imelda Marcos as a patron of the arts. This effort was so large that by 1977–1980, projects in the &quot;conspicuous capital outlays&quot; category had ballooned from a negligible amount to 20% of the Philippines&#x27; capital outlays.

These projects were typically constructed on a rush basis, often compromising structural safety.

The most controversial projects included

* Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) Complex, a 77-hectare reclaimed property in Pasay. He appointed a seven-member board of trustees, who elected Imelda as its chair. The budget grew from P15 million to P63 million.
* The San Juanico Bridge is part of the Pan-Philippine Highway and links the provinces of Leyte and Samar. At in length, it is the Philippines longest bridge over water. Construction began in 1969. It was inaugurated on July 2, 1973, in time for Imelda Marcos&#x27;s birthday. The $22 million construction cost was acquired through Japanese Official Development Assistance loans.
* The Manila Film Center began construction in January 1981 and cost $25 million. To meet the January 1982 deadline for the Manila International Film Festival, 4,000 workers were employed to work three 24-hour nonstop shifts. The lobby was constructed in 72 hours by 1,000 workers. A scaffolding collapsed on November 17, 1981, killing multiple workers. Rescuers and ambulances were kept away for 9 hours after the incident.

Marcos&#x27;s signature agricultural program, Masagana 99, launched on May 21, 1973, to address a rice shortage. Its goal was to raise yield from 40 to 99 cavans (4.4 tons) per hectare. The program pushed farmers to use high-yield seeds, fertilizer, and herbicides. Initial success came from encouraging farmers to plant &quot;Miracle Rice&quot; (IR8), which funded by the Rockefeller and Ford foundations, and the UP College of Agriculture through IRRI, which had been under development since 1962. This increased rice production from 3.7 to 7.7 million tons in two decades and made the Philippines a rice exporter for the first time in the 20th century. The required switch to IR8 required more fertilizers and pesticides, helping multinationals, but not small, peasant farmers who often remained in poverty.

Although Masagana 99 showed promising results, the years from 1965 to 1986 showed a complete paradox of events. The income per capita rose, the economy was growing, yet people were impoverished. The American economist James K. Boyce calls this phenomenon &quot;immiserizing growth&quot;, when economic growth, and political and social conditions, are such that the rich get absolutely richer and the poor become absolutely poorer. The World Bank reported that crops (rice, corn, coconut, sugar), livestock and poultry and fisheries grew at an average rate of 6.8%, 3% and 4.5%, respectively from 1970 to 1980, and while the forestry sector declined by an annual average rate of 4.4% through the 1970s.

===Logging and deforestation===
The Marcos administration marked a period of intense logging, with commercial logging accounting for 5% of GDP product in the first half of the 1970s. This was the result of Japanese construction demand. Timber products became a top export, but little attention was paid to deforestation&#x27;s environmental impacts.

In the early 1980s, forestry collapsed because most accessible forests had been depleted – of 12 million hectares of forestland, about 7 million had been harvested. The rate of forest destruction was about per year during the 1960s and 1970s, such that by 1981, the Food and Agriculture Organization classified 2 million hectares of Philippine forests &quot;severely degraded and incapable of regeneration&quot;.

===Heavy industrialization===
In 1979, Marcos added 11 heavy industrialization projects to the economic agenda. The priority projects were:

* aluminum smelter
* copper smelter
* integrated petrochemical complex 
* integrated pulp and paper plant
* integrated steel mill
* phosphatic fertilizer plant
* alcogas industry
* cement industry expansion
* coconut industry integration 
* diesel engine manufacturing
* nuclear power plant

Other industrialization projects during the Marcos administration included 17 hydroelectric and geothermal power plants. The commissioning of the Tongonan 1 and Palinpinon 1 geothermal plants in 1983 made the Philippines the world&#x27;s second largest geothermal producers.

====Nuclear Power ====
The Bataan Nuclear Power Plant (BNPP) is one of Marcos&#x27; six planned nuclear power plants. It stands in Morong, Bataan, atop Napot Point that overlooks the South China Sea. Construction completed in 1985.

In 1974, National Power was negotiating with General Electric. However, Westinghouse energy company, hired Herminio Disini, a friend of Ferdinand Marcos to lobby for them. Westinghouse made a direct offer to supply a plant with two 620 MW reactors at a price of $500 million. The price estimate was raised to around $650 million because of such as fuel and transmission lines. Westinghouse won the deal. By March 1975, the price increased to $1.1 billion.

Numerous issues regarding safety and usability emerged. After the Three Mile Island incident, construction stopped. A safety inquiry revealed over 4,000 defects. The site was near the open sea and the then-dormant Mount Pinatubo, and was within 25 miles of three geological faults. The project was discontinued in 1986 following the Chernobyl disaster.

Costs passed $2.3 million; loans were paid off only in April 2017, although maintaining the plant costs P40 million a year.

===Educational system===
Marcos emphasized educational infrastructure during his first presidential term. He was more willing than previous presidents to use foreign loans to fund construction projects allowing him to construct more roads and schoolbuildings than any previous administration.

47 colleges and universities were established during Marcos&#x27;s 21-year administration.

The Philippine education system underwent two major periods of restructuring under Marcos: first in 1972 with &quot;Bagong Lipunan&quot; (New Society) and again in 1981 when the Fourth Philippine Republic was established.

&quot;Bagong Lipunan&quot; marked the first major restructuring of Philippine education since Americans arrived around 1900. It reoriented the teaching of civics and history so that it would reflect &quot;Bagong Lipunan&quot;&#x27;s ideology of constitutional authoritarianism. In addition, it attempted to synchronize the curriculum with the administration&#x27;s economic strategy of labor export.

The second restructuring in 1981 failed as the administration was distracted by economic crises.

===Metro Manila===
In 1975, Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 824, placing the four cities and thirteen municipalities near the Province of Manila under the administration of the Metro Manila Commission (MMC).

The appointed head of the MMC was called a &quot;governor&quot;. Marcos appointed Imelda as governor in 1976.

The governorship was the republic&#x27;s second most powerful office. Metro Manila then accounted for around 20% of the country&#x27;s population and at least 70% of GDP. Its budget is second to the national government. This increase in Imelda&#x27;s political power led Carlos P. Romulo to describe her as the Philippines&#x27; &quot;de facto vice president&quot;.

=== The US–Marcos relationship ===

All five American presidents from 1965 to 1985 maintained the US–Marcos relationship, mainly to protect and retain access of the US military bases. However, the Philippines was just one of many US allies, while the US was the Philippines&#x27; only patron. Marcos worked to maintain close relations with the US. He relied on this connection to sustain his regime.

Marcos strengthened his ties to the US government by actions such as sending two engineer battalions to the US in the Vietnam War. After South Vietnam fell, President Ford sought better security assistance from allies, such as the Philippines, while President Carter wanted to retain US military bases in the Philippines to guard the West&#x27;s oil supply line from the Middle East.

To obtain additional aid, Marcos often leveraged threats that caught US attention. To secure aid for his campaign, Marcos threatened to search every visiting American naval vessel. The US responded by assisting his campaign indirectly, injecting millions into the government banking system.

In another instance, when US military bases became an issue in the Philippines in1969, Marcos secretly assured the US he had no desire for an American withdrawal. He had received warnings from the Philippine embassy that US aid was at risk in the Congress. Marcos returned to implied threats. In one speech, he stated that the bases were a threat to regional peace and security, while reminding the US of its &quot;solemn obligation&quot; to continue aid. In the last weeks of the Ford administration, Marcos rejected the US offer of $1 billion in mixed grants and loans as too small.

==Books==
Marcos published various books during his term from 1970 to 1983, and a final offering was published posthumously, in 1990. Apparently these books were written by ghostwriters, notably Adrian Cristobal.

<text>The Golden Globe Awards are awards presented for excellence in both international film and television. It is an annual award ceremony held since 1944 to honor artists and professionals and their work. The ceremony is normally held every January, and has been a major part of the film industry&#x27;s awards season, which culminates each year in the Academy Awards. The eligibility period for Golden Globes corresponds from January 1 through December 31. The Golden Globes were not televised in 1969–1972, 1979, and 2022. The 2008 ceremony was canceled due to the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike.

Currently, the Golden Globes Awards are presented by the Golden Globe Foundation, an organization representing international journalists who reported on the American entertainment industry. Revenue from the ceremony is used by Golden Globe Foundation to fund entertainment-related charities and scholarships, such as the Young Artist Awards.

==History==
The Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) was founded in 1943 as the Hollywood Foreign Correspondent Association (HFCA) by Los Angeles–based foreign journalists seeking to develop a better-organized process of gathering and distributing cinema news to non-U.S. markets. One of the organization&#x27;s first major endeavors was to establish a ceremony similar to the Academy Awards to honor film achievements. The 1st Golden Globe Awards, honoring the best achievements in 1943 filmmaking, were held in January 1944, at the 20th Century-Fox studios. Subsequent ceremonies were held at various venues throughout the next decade, including the Beverly Hills Hotel and the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel.

===Foreign Press Association of Hollywood&#x27;s Henrietta Awards===
In 1950, some of the journalists in the HFCA broke away to form the Foreign Press Association of Hollywood (FPAH). It was the FPAH that instituted the Henrietta Award for World Film Favorite, which was subsequently given out by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the new name for the organization when the FPAH and HFCA merged in 1955, minus the &quot;Henrietta&quot; name through 1980 (for the 1979 movie year).

The FPAH held its first World Film Favorite Festival on January 27, 1951, giving out Henrietta Awards in various categories. The award, an angel above a globe raised on four tall pillars, was named for the president of the FPAH, Henry Gris. Winners of the Henrietta for World Film Favorite were Gregory Peck and Jane Wyman. At the FPAH&#x27;s second World Film Favorite Festival held January 26, 1952, the Henrietta was a large statuette of a naked woman holding a flower. Based on an international poll of 900 newspapers, magazines and radio stations, Alan Ladd and Esther Williams were presented the gold Henrietta for World Favorites. while silver Henriettas for &quot;Best Young Box Office Personality&quot; were presented to Leslie Caron, Tony Curtis, John Derek, Mitzi Gaynor, Marilyn Monroe and Patrice Wymore. At the third festival held on February 14, 1953, John Wayne and Susan Hayward won the gold Henriettas.

The HFCA continued to hold their Golden Globe Awards. In 1950, the HFCA had established a special honorary award to recognize outstanding contributions to the entertainment industry. Recognizing its subject as an international figure within the entertainment industry, the first award was presented to director and producer Cecil B. DeMille. The official name of the award thus became the Cecil B. DeMille Award.

In January 1954, the two organizations held a joint ceremony, and the following year, they merged under the new Hollywood Foreign Press Association name. The Henrietta Award was terminated, but the HFPA instituted a special award called World Film Favorite, a Golden Globe surmounted by an angel. Similar to the Henrietta Award for World Film Favorite, the winner of the new HFPA Golden Globe was determined by a worldwide poll conducted by Reuters. This award, sometimes referred to as The Henrietta Award, was given out through 1980 for the 1979, movie year, when it was terminated.

===Post-merger===
The 13th Golden Globe Awards held in February 1956 saw the first Golden Globe in Television Achievement. The first three permanent television award categories, Best TV Series, Best TV Actor, and Best TV Actress, then made their debuts during the 19th Golden Globe Awards held in March 1962.

Beginning in 1963, the trophies commenced to be handed out by one or more persons referred to as &quot;Miss Golden Globe&quot;, a title renamed on January 5, 2018, to &quot;Golden Globe Ambassador&quot;. The holders of the position were, traditionally, the daughters or sometimes the sons of a celebrity, and as a point of pride, these often continued to be contested among celebrity parents.

In 2009, the Golden Globe statuette was redesigned (but not for the first time in its history). The New York firm Society Awards collaborated for a year with the HFPA to produce a statuette that included a unique marble and enhanced the statuette&#x27;s quality and gold content. It was unveiled at a press conference at the Beverly Hilton prior to the show.

The Carol Burnett Award was created as a television counterpart to the Cecil B. DeMille Award, named after its first recipient in 2019, actress and comedian Carol Burnett.

===Revenues from award broadcast===
Revenues generated from the annual ceremony have enabled the HFPA to donate millions of dollars to entertainment-related charities, as well as funding scholarships and other programs for future film and television professionals. The most prominent beneficiary is the Young Artist Awards, presented annually by the Young Artist Foundation, established in 1978 by Hollywood Foreign Press member Maureen Dragone, to recognize and award excellence of young Hollywood performers under the age of 21 and to provide scholarships for young artists who may be physically or financially challenged.

===2022 boycott, acquisition by Dick Clark Productions===
In 2021, the HFPA faced criticism for the lack of Black representation among its members. On May 3, 2021, the HFPA announced plans for a reform package, including a 50% increase in members over the next 18 months, as well as new positions, term limits, and practices to improve its accountability. However, Time&#x27;s Up and a group of 100 PR firms criticized the lack of given timelines for filling some of the new management positions, arguing that they would not be completed soon enough to have any material impact on the cycle of the upcoming 79th Golden Globe Awards in January 2022. Time&#x27;s Up further argued that the package &quot;largely contains no specifics&quot; nor &quot;commitments to real accountability or change&quot;.

On May 7, 2021, both Amazon Studios and Netflix announced that they would stop their activities with the HFPA until sufficient actions on reforms are made. Other media companies followed suit on May 10, including NBC, who announced that it would not televise the 79th Golden Globe Awards, but that it would be open to televising the ceremony in 2023 if the HFPA were successful in its efforts to reform. WarnerMedia also boycotted the HFPA, while Tom Cruise returned the awards he had won for &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;, &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; and &quot;Magnolia&quot; in solidarity.

Following these events, the HFPA released a timeline for its reforms, which would see the process completed by the week of August 2. On October 1, the HFPA released a list of 21 new members that it had recruited under these reforms, and named Todd Boehly (owner of ceremony producer Dick Clark Productions) as its &quot;interim CEO&quot;. The HFPA then announced on October 15 that it still planned to hold the 79th Golden Globe Awards on January 9, 2022, with or without another media partner. With the televised absence of the Golden Globe Awards from NBC, the Critics Choice Association attempted to shift their Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Awards ceremony up a week in order to fill the void and increase their overall prestige, though it was later delayed due to SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. The 79th ceremony was conducted as a non-televised, private presentation, with limited guests (particularly beneficiaries of the HFPA&#x27;s philanthropic activities) and strict COVID-19 protocol due to Omicron variant.

In July 2022, the HFPA approved a major restructuring, under which Boehly would establish a for-profit entity via his holding company Eldridge Industries (owner of Dick Clark Productions—which has produced the Golden Globes&#x27; telecast since 1993, as well as the entertainment trade publication &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;) that will hold the Golden Globe Awards&#x27; intellectual property and oversee the &quot;professionalization and modernization&quot; of the ceremony, including &quot;[increasing] the size and diversity of the available voters for the annual awards&quot;. The HFPA&#x27;s philanthropic activities were to continue separately as a non-profit entity. NBC subsequently agreed to a one-year contract to air the 80th Golden Globe Awards on January 10, 2023, which were moved to a Tuesday evening to avoid conflicting with the National Football League (whose regular season was recently extended into January) and the College Football Playoff National Championship (which was being hosted at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood).

On June 12, 2023, HFPA was rebranded to Golden Globe Foundation, and all Golden Globe Awards assets and intellectual property were acquired by DCP (whose ownership includes Penske Media Corporation, owner of fellow entertainment publications &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot;) and Eldridge; the financial details of the purchase were not disclosed. The HFPA&#x27;s philanthropic activities have been transitioned to Golden Globe Foundation.

==Rules==
===Eligibility===
The qualifying eligibility period for all nominations is the calendar year from January 1 through December 31.

Voice-over performances and cameo appearances in which persons play themselves are not eligible from all film and TV acting categories.

Films must be at least 70 minutes and released for at least a seven-day run in the Greater Los Angeles area, starting prior to midnight on December 31. Films can be released in theaters, on pay-per-view, or by digital delivery.

For the Best Foreign Language Film category, films do not need to be released in the United States. At least 51 percent of the dialogue must be in a language other than English, and they must first be released in their country of origin during a 14-month period from November 1 to December 31 prior to the Awards. However, if a film was not released in its country of origin due to censorship, it can still qualify if it had a one-week release in the United States during the qualifying calendar year. There is no limit to the number of submitted films from a given country.

A TV program must air in the United States between the prime time hours of 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. (or 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. on Sundays). A show can air on broadcast television, on basic or premium cable, or by digital delivery; it does not qualify if it is only on pay-per-view or via digital delivery of film. Also, a TV show must either be made in the United States or be a co-production financially and creatively between an American and a foreign production company. Furthermore, reality and non-scripted shows are disqualified.

A film cannot be entered in both the film and TV categories, and instead should be entered based on its original release format. If it was first aired on American television, then it can be entered into the TV categories. If it was released in theaters or on pay-per-view, then it should instead be entered into the film categories. A film festival showing does not count towards disqualifying what would otherwise be a TV program.

Actors in a TV series must appear in at least six episodes during the qualifying calendar year. Actors in a TV film or miniseries must appear in at least five percent of the time in that TV film or miniseries.

=== Nominations and voting ===
Entry forms for films need to be received within ten days of the official screening. TV programs should be submitted &quot;as early as possible&quot; before the deadline. For TV programs, they must merely be available to be seen by voters in any common format, including the original TV broadcast.

As of the 2023 ceremony, the HFPA removed a requirement that an exclusive press conference be hosted by the organization for each nominated film—a practice that had contributed to transparency issues.

Ballots to select the nominations are sent to voters in November, along with a &quot;Reminder List&quot; of eligible film and TV programs. Each HFPA member then votes for their top five choices in each category, numbering them 5 to 1, with 5 being their top choice. The nominees in each category are then the five selections that receive the most votes. The ranked voting is only used to break ties, with number 5 worth 5 points, number 4 worth 4 points, and so on.

After the nominations are announced in mid-December, voters receive the final ballots. The winner in each category is selected from among the nominees by plurality voting. In case of a tie, the winner is the one that had the most votes on the nomination ballot.

As of the 2024 ceremony, the voting body consisted of 310 individuals, including representatives of 76 countries, international journalists, and 95 members that were members of the HFPA.

==Ceremony==

The broadcast of the Golden Globe Awards, broadcast to 167 countries worldwide, generally ranks as the third most-watched awards show each year, behind only the Oscars and the Grammy Awards. Since 2010, it was televised live in all United States time zones. Until Ricky Gervais hosted in 2010, the award ceremony was one of two major Hollywood award ceremonies (the other being the Screen Actors Guild Awards) that did not have a regular host; every year a different presenter introduced the ceremony at the beginning of the broadcast. Gervais returned to host the 68th and 69th Golden Globe Awards the next two years. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted the 70th, 71st and 72nd Golden Globe Awards in 2013 through 2015. The Golden Globe Awards&#x27; theme song, which debuted in 2012, was written by Japanese musician and songwriter Yoshiki Hayashi.

=== Broadcasting ===
The HFPA had previously held a lucrative broadcasting agreement with NBC, which began televising the Golden Globes ceremony locally in Los Angeles in 1958, then nationally in 1964. However, in 1968, the Federal Communications Commission claimed the show &quot;misled the public as to how the winners were determined&quot; (allegations included that winners were determined by lobby; to motivate winners to show up to the awards ceremony winners were informed if they did not attend another winner would be named). The FCC admonished NBC for participating in the scandal. Subsequently, NBC refused to broadcast the ceremony from 1968 until after 1974.

Since 1993, Dick Clark Productions (DCP) had produced the ceremony with NBC as a broadcaster; DCP&#x27;s involvement came at a time of instability for the Golden Globes, including reduced credibility and having lost its contract with CBS (the interim period saw it contract with cable network TBS to air the ceremony). Enthusiastic over Clark&#x27;s commitment, the HFPA&#x27;s contract contained an unusual provision granting DCP the role of producer in perpetuity, provided that it continued to maintain a broadcast rights agreement with NBC.

Due to threats of writers picketing the event as part of the ongoing Writers Guild of America strike, the 65th Golden Globe Awards ceremony was cancelled and replaced by an hour-long press conference to announce the winners. While NBC sought to be the exclusive broadcaster of the press conference, the network faced conflicts with the HFPA and Dick Clark Productions over the proposed coverage, including a demand for a rights fee, and concerns over plans to have Billy Bush and Nancy O&#x27;Dell of NBC&#x27;s syndicated entertainment news program &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; serve as presenters. The HFPA subsequently announced that it would not restrict coverage of the press conference by other broadcasters. E! and TV Guide Network (who were typically known for red carpet coverage from major awards shows) both aired coverage of the press conference, as well as CNN. NBC declined to air the conference itself; the ceremony timeslot was filled by a &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; preview special, an hour-long results special hosted by Bush and O&#x27;Dell, and an &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; post-show also hosted by Bush and O&#x27;Dell.

In 2010, Dick Clark Productions reached an extension with NBC through 2018. However, the deal was negotiated without the HFPA&#x27;s knowledge. The HFPA sued DCP over the deal, as well as claims that the company was attempting to sell digital rights that it did not hold; the HFPA had wanted a new contract that would grant them a larger share of revenue from the telecast. In April 2012, judge Howard Matz upheld the NBC perpetuity clause and ruled in favor of DCP, noting that the HFPA had a history of &quot;unbusinesslike display[s] of misplaced priorities&quot; and &quot;[succumbing] to bouts of pronounced turmoil and personal feuds&quot;, in contrast to DCP, which had been &quot;represented by one experienced executive who was adept at dealing fairly and effectively with the often amateurish conduct of HFPA.&quot; Matz pointed out examples of the HFPA&#x27;s enthusiasm over the relationship and their desire to &quot;not get cancelled&quot;, such as having disregarded its own bylaws by approving an extension in 2001 without a formal vote. The case was taken to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

In 2014, Dick Clark Productions and the HFPA reached a settlement; details were not released, but DCP committed to continue its role as producer through at least the end of its current contract with NBC, and to work with the HFPA to &quot;expand the brand with unique and exciting entertainment experiences&quot;. NBC held a right of first refusal to renew its contract beyond 2018, but bidding was to be open to other broadcasters; in September 2018, NBC agreed to renew its rights to the Golden Globes through 2027, maintaining the current broadcast arrangement and the involvement of Dick Clark Productions.

In 2019 and 2020, NBC televised the late Sunday afternoon National Football League (NFL) playoff game (which had historically gone to another NFL broadcaster) as a lead-in to the Golden Globes. Because of the large viewership of NFL playoff games, this was intended to boost the Golden Globes&#x27; television ratings, which dropped 11% between 2017 and 2018. If the game ever went long, NBC planned to still air the Golden Globes in its entirety on a broadcast delay. The 2021 ceremony was then postponed to February 28 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema and on television, avoiding the NFL season altogether.

Per the aforementioned 2022 boycott, NBC declined to air the 2022 ceremony, then signed a one-year deal to televise the 2023 ceremony, moving it to a Tuesday evening to avoid conflicting with &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; and the 2023 College Football Playoff National Championship. In November 2023, DCP announced a one-year agreement to air the 81st ceremony on CBS and streaming on Paramount+, with the ceremony following CBS&#x27;s afternoon NFL coverage. In March 2024, DCP announced a five-year agreement with CBS to continue airing the Golden Globes; the agreement also includes rights to the DCP-produced American Music Awards beginning in 2025, which had gone on hiatus after 2022 when its contract with ABC expired.

==Ratings==
;Notes
==Scandals and criticism==
Since the late 1950s, the HFPA had been racked by scandals and controversies. The organization had been criticized for the small size of its membership, the quality of the members, its exclusion of serious cinema journalists, and their closeness to the movie industry and stars. The Golden Globes under the HFPA were also accused of being bought or bartered, with the HFPA seemingly doling out nominations if not wins to studios, production companies, and stars who wooed HFPA members with gifts, press junkets and personal attention.

=== Henry Gris resignation ===
Former HFPA president Henry Gris resigned from the board in 1958 claiming that &quot;certain awards are being given more or less as favors&quot; with others querying why so many winners were represented by one public relations firm.

===FCC broadcast ban===
The FCC imposed a ban on NBC&#x27;s broadcast of the Golden Globes after the February 1968 ceremony. Movie critic Rex Reed, in a contemporary article about the broadcast, wrote:

NBC&#x27;s telcast of the Foreign Press Association&#x27;s 25th annual Golden Globe Awards had to be seen to be disbelieved. The Federal Communications Commission have sent lawyers to have it investigated. But award-giving, pointless as it is, is still big business, and it also gives viewers a chance to see their favorite stars make fools of themselves in public, so the Golden Globes were back, minus some of their sponsors, who backed out at the last minute...

Just last week &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported denials from the Foreign Press Association that its members give awards to the stars who throw the biggest feeds. &quot;We are not influenced by a glass of champagne,&quot; snapped [HFPA President Howard] Luft, &quot;Kirk Douglas threw a party last year, and what did he win? Nothing.&quot;

This year there was even a special category called the Cecil B. DeMille Humanitarian Award. Who won? You guessed it. Kirk Douglas.

The FCC was spurred to action because the public had been misled as to how the awards were actually made. Golden Globe broadcast advertisers determined Golden Globe winners and the HFPA pressured nominees to attend the award ceremony by threatening to award the Golden Globe won by a non-attendee to a losing nominee who was at the ceremony. The ban lasted until 1974.

After the ban, NBC once again broadcast the awards ceremony, but it terminated its contract with the HFPA after the Pia Zadora scandal of 1982 (see below).

=== Pia Zadora awarded &quot;New Star of the Year in a Motion Picture&quot; in 1982 ===
In 1982, Pia Zadora won a Golden Globe in the category &quot;New Star of the Year in a Motion Picture&quot; for her performance in &quot;Butterfly&quot;, over such competition as Elizabeth McGovern (&quot;Ragtime&quot;) and Kathleen Turner (&quot;Body Heat&quot;). Accusations were made that the Foreign Press Association members had been bought off. Zadora&#x27;s husband, multimillionaire Meshulam Riklis, flew voting members to his casino, the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas, which gave the appearance that they voted for Zadora to repay this. Riklis also invited voting members to his house for a lavish lunch and a showing of the film. He also spent a great deal on advertising. Furthermore, Zadora had made her film debut some 17 years earlier as a child performer in &quot;Santa Claus Conquers the Martians&quot;.

=== 2011 Payola Charges ===
In 2011, three days before the Golden Globe Awards telecast, publicist Michael Russell filed a $2 million lawsuit alleging that HFPA President Philip Berk terminated Russell and his partner&#x27;s contract after the 2010 broadcast because they raised ethical concerns over payola with him, including allegations that HFPA members took bribes for nominations and awards. The lawsuit alleged that HFPA members &quot;abuse their positions and engage in unethical and potentially unlawful deals and arrangements which amount to a &#x27;payola&#x27; scheme.&quot; The HFPA denied the allegations, claiming they were fabrications made up by a disgruntled ex-employee. The lawsuit was later settled.

=== &quot;Burlesque&quot; and &quot;The Tourist&quot; for Best Musical/Comedy nominations in 2011 ===
The nominations for the 2011 Golden Globes drew initial skepticism, as the Hollywood Foreign Press Association nominated &quot;The Tourist&quot; in its Best Musical/Comedy categories, even though it was originally advertised as a spy thriller, along with being one of the most panned films of the season. Host Ricky Gervais even jokingly asked the main star of the film, Johnny Depp, if he had seen it. Depp&#x27;s co-star Angelina Jolie reportedly had personally lobbied HFPA members, resulting in a nomination in a category the film did not belong in. Rumors then surfaced that Sony, the distributor of &quot;The Tourist&quot;, had influenced Globes voters with an all-expenses-paid trip to Las Vegas, culminating in a concert by Cher. The lobbying by Sony also resulted in a Best Musical/Comedy nod for Cher&#x27;s badly-reviewed movie &quot;Burlesque&quot;.

=== Asian films excluded from Best Motion Picture categories ===
In 2020, the HFPA received widespread criticism for nominating Asian and Asian American films, such as &quot;The Farewell&quot;, &quot;Parasite&quot;, and &quot;Minari&quot;, for Best Foreign Language Film while excluding them from the Best Motion Picture categories. The decision to categorize &quot;Minari&quot; as a foreign language film, despite having an exclusively American production team and setting, was heavily condemned by many actors and filmmakers of Asian descent. While HFPA rules stipulate that a film must have at least 50% English dialogue to be nominated for the Best Drama or Comedy/Musical categories, critics noted that the films &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; and &quot;Babel&quot; did not meet the 50% threshold but were still nominated for the Best Motion Picture categories, prompting accusations of anti-Asian racism.

=== Black representation ===
In the 2020s, the HFPA began to face criticism for the ethical standards of its operations—including allegations that the organization lacked accountability, and that there was a lack of Black representation among its members. Calls for reform in response to these issues resulted in the 79th Golden Globe Awards being boycotted by its broadcaster and other production companies; as a result, the ceremony was held as a non-televised, private event. A televised ceremony returned the following year.

<text>Ein Yaakov (, &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Well&quot;) is a 16th-century compilation of all the Aggadic material in the Talmud together with commentaries. Its introduction contains an account of the history of Talmudic censorship and the term Gemara. It was compiled by Jacob ibn Habib and (after his death) by his son Levi ibn Habib.

Although ibn Habib intended his work for a wide audience, including the rabbinic elite, &quot;Ein Yaakov&quot; was &quot;especially treasured by laborers and others&quot; who lacked the schooling to learn the more difficult parts of the Talmud. Some synagogues hold daily &quot;Ein Yaakov&quot; classes.

== Commentaries ==
Dozens of commentaries on the &quot;Ein Yaakov&quot; have been composed, and some editions contain 20 or more. These are some of the most notable commentaries:
* &quot;HaKotev&quot; (before 1516): Ibn Habib&#x27;s own commentary. In the &quot;edition princeps&quot; his comments are marked by א&quot;ה, &quot;so says the author,&quot; and later editions call it &quot;HaKotev&quot;, &quot;the author&quot;.
* &quot;Hiddushei Aggadot&quot; (before 1631): A work by Samuel Eidels which is often treated as a commentary to the Talmud, but Eidels writes in the introduction that his aim is &quot;to compose a commentary to all the tales in the &quot;Ein Yaakov&quot;&quot;.
* &quot;Beit Yehuda&quot; (1634-6): Leon da Modena&#x27;s commentary, which appeared in all editions between 1684 and 1916. Later editions call it &quot;HaBoneh&quot;. This is one of his most mature works, according to Ellis Rivkin. Da Modena also compiled an index to the &quot;Ein Yaakov&quot;, titled &quot;Beit Lehem Yehuda&quot;.
* &quot;Meor Einayim&quot; (1643): Josiah Pinto&#x27;s commentary.
* (Before 1667): Commentary of , preserved MS Columbia X 893 L 973 and BL Add. MS 27020.

* &quot;Kotnot Or&quot; (1683): Commentary of .
* &quot;Iyyun Yaakov&quot; (1729): Jacob Reischer&#x27;s.
* &quot;Yashresh Yaakov&quot; (1729): Hayyim Abulafia&#x27;s.
* &quot;Shevut Yaakov&quot; (1734): An expanded commentary by Hayyim Abulafia.
* (before 1746): Moshe Chaim Luzzatto supposedly composed a commentary, now lost.
* &quot;Petah Einayim&quot; (1790): Chaim Yosef David Azulai&#x27;s.
* &quot;Ein Avraham&quot; (1848): Abraham ben Aryeh Loeb Schick&#x27;s.
* &quot;Yad Yosef, Etz Yosef, Anaf Yosef&quot; (before 1867): Enoch Zundel ben Joseph&#x27;s three commentaries.
* &quot;Or haChayyim&quot; (1883): Commentary by Mordecai Jaffe of Plungė (1814-1883) to the Yerushalmi sections, compiled largely from the &quot;Korban Ha-Edah&quot; and the &quot;Pnei Moshe&quot;. First printed in Vilna, 1883.
* &quot;Ein Ayyah&quot; (1883-1935): A lengthy commentary by Abraham Isaac Kook, published in 4 volumes.

<text>Aleinu (Hebrew: , lit. &quot;upon us&quot;, meaning &quot;[it is] our duty&quot;) or Aleinu leshabei&#x27;ach (Hebrew: &quot;[it is] our duty to praise God]&quot;), meaning &quot;it is upon us&quot; or &quot;it is our obligation or duty&quot; to &quot;praise God,&quot; is a Jewish prayer found in the siddur, the classical Jewish prayerbook. It is recited in most communities at the end of each of the three daily Jewish services and in the middle of the Rosh Hashanah &quot;mussaf&quot;. It is also recited in many communities following Kiddush levana and after a circumcision is performed. It is second only to the Kaddish (counting all its forms) as the most frequently recited prayer in current synagogue liturgy.

==History==
A folkloric tradition attributes this prayer to the biblical Joshua at the time of his conquest of Jericho. This might have been inspired by the fact that the first letters of the first four verses spell, in reverse, &quot;Hoshea&quot;, which was the childhood name of Joshua (Numbers 13:16). Another attribution is to the Men of the Great Assembly, during the Second Temple period. An early—that is, pre-Christian—origin of the prayer is evidenced by its explicit mention of bowing and kneeling—practices associated with the Temple, and its non-mention of exile or a desire to restore Israel or the Temple. On the other hand, it has been argued that the phrase: &quot;lirot meherah be-tiferet uzechah&quot; (to speedily see your &quot;tiferet&quot; and &quot;oz&quot;) is in fact a request for the speedy rebuilding of the Temple. The allusion is based on Psalms 78:61 and 96:6. If so, at least the second paragraph of &quot;Aleinu&quot; was written after the destruction in 70 CE (perhaps around the time of Abba Arikha).

Its first appearance is the manuscript of the Rosh Hashana liturgy by the 3rd century Babylonian Talmudic sage Abba Arikha. He included it in the Rosh Hashana &quot;mussaf&quot; service as a prologue to the Kingship portion of the Amidah. For that reason some attribute to Arikha the authorship, or at least the revising, of &quot;Aleinu&quot;.

In Blois, France, in 1171, it is alleged that a number of Jews—reportedly 34 men and 17 women—were burned at the stake for refusing to renounce their faith. They are said to have gone to their deaths bravely singing &quot;Aleinu&quot; to a &quot;soul-stirring&quot; melody, which astonished their executioners. Some have suggested that this act of martyrdom inspired the adoption of &quot;Aleinu&quot; into the daily liturgy. But &quot;Aleinu&quot; is already found at the end of the daily shacharit in Machzor Vitry in the early 12th century, well before 1171.

==Text==
The following is the first half of the current Ashkenazi version of the prayer (there is also a second paragraph, which some traditions omit, though it is a standard part of the Ashkenazi orthodox liturgy).

The literal translation of line number 9 is &quot;But we bend our knees and bow down and express thanks&quot;. The Sefardic/Mizrahi tradition shortens this line to ואנחנוּ משׁתּחום—&quot;Va&#x27;anḥnu mištaḥavim&quot;—&quot;But we bow down&quot;. The quotation in lines 18–21 is Deuteronomy 4:39.

==Use in the synagogue==
&quot;Aleinu&quot; is recited with all the congregants standing. One reason for this is because it is a declaration of faith that should be done with great fear and awe, but also that the first and last letters of the prayer spell עד—&quot;witness&quot;—and it is appropriate for the praying person as a witness of god to stand when testifying.

The original context of this prayer was as part of the middle paragraphs of the Amidah prayer in the mussaf (additional) service on Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year), and more specifically in the passage known as &quot;Malchuyot&quot; (the kingdom of God). In this context it includes both paragraphs of the prayer. The first paragraph is also included at the equivalent point in the liturgy for Yom Kippur during the chazzan&#x27;s repetition, but not during the silent prayer.

In the Middle Ages varying customs emerged of reciting the first paragraph every day, at the end of either the morning service alone or of all the prayer services for the day. In the 16th century the kabbalist Hayim Vital, recording the opinions of Isaac Luria, ruled that both paragraphs should be included in all services, and should end with the verse &quot;on that day the Lord shall be one and His Name one&quot;. This has been accepted in almost all communities except for the Spanish and Portuguese Jews, who retain the &quot;short Alenu&quot;. The custom according to some North African prayer books is to recite the second paragraph only at the conclusion of weekday morning services.

In some Ashkenazic communities, Aleinu is not recited at Mincha when it is followed immediately by Maariv, as this is not considered the end of the service. Furthermore, in the Italian and Yemenite rites, Aleinu is never recited in Mincha.

In the daily and Sabbath services, when the line (numbered, above, as line 9, here translated literally) &quot;But we bend our knees and bow&quot; is recited, many have the custom to flex their knees and then bend from the waist, straightening up by the time the words &quot;before (&quot;lif&#x27;nei&quot;) the King of kings of kings&quot; are reached. But during the repetition on the High Holy Days of Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, the worshipper will not merely flex and bend, but will actually get down on his knees at those words, and many congregants will prostrate themselves on the floor (in those synagogues with sufficient floor space).

In Orthodox and Conservative congregations, the Torah Ark remains closed while it is recited (except on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, when the Ark is opened), but in some Reform congregations the Ark is opened whenever &quot;Aleinu&quot; is recited. In most Sefardic congregations, as well as in the Askenazic traditions of Frankfurt and Mainz, &quot;Aleinu&quot; is not followed by the Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish (because, variously, &quot;Aleinu&quot; was whispered to avoid antagonizing the Christian authorities, or because &quot;Aleinu&quot; is not a reading from Scripture), elsewhere it is. The Sefardic congregations that recite Kaddish afterward insert Psalm 27 immediately beforehand.

==Censored passage==
Referring the lines above numbered 7 &amp; 8:

The earlier form of this prayer contains an additional sentence:
This sentence is built from two quotations from the Bible, specifically from the Book of Isaiah, Isaiah 30:7, &quot;For the help of Egypt shall be (הבל וריק) &quot;vain and empty&quot; ...&quot;; and Isaiah 45:20. &quot;... No foreknowledge had they who carry their wooden images (וּמתפּללים אל־אל לא יוֹשׁיע) &quot;and pray to a God who cannot give success&quot;.&quot; (New JPS) The line is still set out in full in Sephardi and Italian prayer books, but was omitted in most of the older printed Ashkenazi prayer books. In some older editions of other rites (e.g., the &quot;Maḥzor Aram Soba&quot;, 1560, as well as some editions of the Ashkenazic prayer book) a blank line was left in the printing, leaving it free for the missing line to be filled in handwriting. In many current Orthodox Jewish siddurim (prayer books) this line has been restored, and the practice of reciting it has increased.

Although the above text, which includes the censored verse, is taken from the 2009 Koren Sacks Siddur, edited by Rabbi Jonathan Sacks (in that edition the censored verse is printed without any distinguishing marks), the 2007 4th edition of &quot;The Authorised Daily Prayer Book of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth&quot;, edited by the same Rabbi Sacks, omits the censored verse completely and without any indication that such a verse ever existed.

===History of the censorship===
Approximately a century after this prayer was incorporated into the daily liturgy, circa 1300, an apostate Jew, known as Pesach Peter, denounced it as a secret anti-Christian slur on the grounds that the word וריק—&quot;varik&quot;, &quot;and emptiness&quot;—had, in gematria (Hebrew numerology) the value of 316, the same as ישׁו—Jesus. In vain did the rabbis defend the sentence on the grounds that the expression came from the Book of Isaiah, or that the whole prayer came from Joshua, and therefore must predate Christianity, or, if the prayer was attributed to Rav, living in 3rd-century Babylonia (Persia), that he never encountered a Christian.—It probably did not help that at roughly the same time a rabbinic commentary on the prayers, &quot;Arugat haBosem&quot; by Abraham ben Azriel, made the point that, in gematria, &quot;vanity and emptiness&quot; had the same value as ישׁו ומחמט—&quot;Jesus and Mohammed&quot;. As a result of this, in various places the Christian authorities censored the sentence, usually omitting it.

Circa 1938, Herbert Lowe, the Reader in Rabbinics at Cambridge University, wrote: &quot;No Jew who recites it ever thinks of it in relation to Christians: the chief thought in his mind is the noble conclusion. It is, in fact, a universalist pronouncement of the Messianic hope, and with this idea every service concludes.&quot;

As a result of this censorship, a curious practice arose - it may have predated the censorship, but thereafter acquired encouragement as a form of resistance - that where the word &quot;emptiness&quot; occurred - or should have occurred - the individual was supposed to spit (on the floor), on the pretext that &quot;emptiness&quot; is very similar to the Hebrew word for &quot;spittle&quot;. This practice was mentioned by the early 15th century. When, for example, the accusations about this verse were revived in Prussia in 1703, the government (in Berlin) enacted that the controversial verse should be omitted altogether &quot;and&quot; that spitting or recoiling was forbidden &quot;and&quot; that the prayer would be recited aloud &quot;in unison&quot; by the whole congregation (to make sure nobody was surreptitiously reciting the verse) &quot;and&quot; that government inspectors would be posted in synagogues to ensure compliance. Apparently no one was ever prosecuted for violating this edict. In some other places, the practice of spitting persisted (or at least was remembered), and there arose a Yiddish expression for someone arriving very late for services (perhaps just to recite the Mourners&#x27; Kaddish, which follows &quot;Aleinu&quot;), &quot;He arrives at the spitting&quot; ( ).

In the daily synagogue services, the Torah Ark is closed while &quot;Aleinu&quot; is recited, but on Rosh Hashana, when &quot;Aleinu&quot; is recited during the Mussaf Amidah, the Ark is opened when &quot;Aleinu&quot; is begun, closed momentarily when the controversial verse was recited (presumably to shield the Torah scrolls from hearing a description of heathen practices) and then opened again as soon as that verse was finished, and then closed again when &quot;Aleinu&quot; is finished. Even after the controversial verse was deleted from the liturgy, owing to Christian censorship, the Ark was momentarily closed although nothing was recited at that moment, as a relic and reminder of the censored verse.

Conservative Rabbi Reuven Hammer comments on the excised sentence:

Originally the text read that God has not made us like the nations who &quot;bow down to nothingness and vanity, and pray to an impotent god.&quot; ... In the Middle Ages these words were censored, since the church believed they were an insult to Christianity. Omitting them tends to give the impression that the &quot;Aleinu&quot; teaches that we are both different and better than others. The actual intent is to say that we are thankful that God has enlightened us so that, unlike the pagans, we worship the true God and not idols. There is no inherent superiority in being Jewish, but we do assert the superiority of monotheistic belief over paganism. Although paganism still exists today, we are no longer the only ones to have a belief in one God.

In 1656, Manasseh ben Israel reported that the Sultan Selim (presumably Selim II, 1524–74), having read the uncensored text of &quot;Aleinu&quot; in Turkish translation, declared: &quot;Truly this prayer is sufficient for all purposes. There is no need of any other.&quot;

===Restoration===
Some Orthodox rabbinical authorities, prominently the 19th-century Rabbi Moshe Yehoshua Leib Diskin (&quot;Maharil Diskin&quot;, died 1898), have argued that the disputed phrase should be recited in communities that previously omitted it.

==Other variations==
In several communities, changes have been introduced, especially in the opening lines of the text, to make it less controversial and extreme in its appearance of ethnocentrism. In some instances these changes have taken the form of less-than-literal translations of the traditional Hebrew into the local language.

For example, in the Italian ritual, &quot;they bow down&quot; was changed to the past tense, &quot;they used to bow down&quot;, and &quot;vanity and emptiness&quot; was changed to לאלילים—&quot;idols&quot;, so the whole verse refers to &quot;ancient&quot; idol worship. 

There was, evidently, an experimental amendment to the preceding verse in one or more Sephardic prayerbooks: &quot;... He has not made us like &quot;some&quot; nations of &quot;other&quot; countries ...&quot; But this amendment was abandoned. The past tense formulation (&quot;worshipped&quot; and &quot;bowed down&quot;) appears in the translation in the London Sephardic prayer books, though the Hebrew retains the present tense.

More far-reaching changes have been made to the wording of this prayer in Conservative and Reform prayer books. For example, the British Reform version borrows words from the blessings over the Torah, and begins &quot;It is our duty to praise the Ruler of all, to recognise the greatness of the Creator of first things, who has chosen us from all peoples by giving us Torah. Therefore we bend low and submit.&quot; Reconstructionist Judaism changes the lines which refer to the chosen people to read, &quot;who gave us teachings of truth and implanted eternal life within us.&quot; The opening of Aleinu is frequent site for liturgical creativity for authors of all stripes.

Although the second paragraph of the standard text of &quot;Aleinu&quot; today includes the phrase &quot;le-taqen olam&quot; לתקן עולם (to fix the world), some scholars suggest that the original text had &quot;le-taken olam&quot; לתכן עולם (spelled with a kaf, not a quf). The &quot;kaf&quot; reading is in the text of Siddur Rav Saadiah Gaon, in the Yemenite ritual, and in fragments from the Cairo Genizah. The verb t-q-n can mean to fix, repair, prepare, or establish; t-k-n would more strictly mean to establish.

<text>ArtScroll is an imprint of translations, books and commentaries from an Orthodox Jewish perspective published by Mesorah Publications, Ltd., a publishing company based in Rahway, New Jersey. Rabbi Nosson Scherman is the general editor.

ArtScroll&#x27;s first president, Rabbi Meir Zlotowitz (July 13, 1943 – June 24, 2017) was succeeded by his oldest son, Rabbi Gedaliah Zlotowitz, whose name is listed secondarily in new publications as general editor, after that of Rabbi Scherman.

==History==
In 1975, Rabbi Meir Zlotowitz, a graduate of Mesivtha Tifereth Jerusalem, was director of a high-end graphics studio in New York. The firm, ArtScroll Studios, produced ketubot, brochures, invitations, and awards. Rabbi Nosson Scherman, then principal of Yeshiva Karlin Stolin Boro Park, was approached by Zlotowitz who had helped him write copy for brochures and journals in the past, and they collaborated on a few projects.

In late 1975, Zlotowitz wrote an English translation and commentary on the Book of Esther in memory of a friend, and asked Scherman to write the introduction. The book sold out its first edition of 20,000 copies within two months. With the encouragement of Rabbis Yaakov Yitzchok Ruderman, Mordechai Gifter, Moses Feinstein, Yaakov Kamenetsky, and others, the two continued producing commentaries, beginning with a translation and commentary on the rest of the Five Megillot (Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations and Ruth), and went on to publish translations and commentaries on the Torah, Prophets, Talmud, Passover Haggadah, siddurs and machzors. By 1990, ArtScroll had produced more than 700 books, including novels, history books, children&#x27;s books and secular textbooks, and became the largest publisher of Jewish books in the United States.

After decades of being headquartered in New York, ArtScroll moved to New Jersey in 2020. Among other things, ArtScroll&#x27;s headquarters in Rahway is notable for their in-house green screen studio used for the production of Inside ArtScroll videos made available online, as well as non-ArtScroll videos such as Mishpacha interviews and other &quot;films that are broadcasted to the Torah community.&quot;

== Publications ==
=== Primary publications and popular demand ===

ArtScroll publishes books on a variety of Jewish subjects. The best known is probably an annotated Hebrew-English &quot;siddur&quot; (&quot;prayerbook&quot;) (&quot;The ArtScroll Siddur&quot;).

Its Torah translation and commentary, a series of translations and commentaries on books of the Tanach (Hebrew Bible), and an English translation and elucidation of the Babylonian Talmud have enjoyed great success. Other publications include works on Jewish Law, novels and factual works based on Jewish life or history, and cookbooks.

The popular demand for ArtScroll&#x27;s translations of classic Jewish works (e.g., Mishnah; Talmud) largely coincided with preexisting market demands, unappreciated to an extent, for English editions characterized by both high-fidelity translations as well as accompanying commentary in the English vernacular. Such editions are used even by American yeshivah graduates–who have had the benefit of exposure to Hebrew and Aramaic from a young age–inasmuch as it is often easier to effortlessly parse through the material in their native language in place of what may at times be a tedious endeavor of self-translation. In certain cases, reading the Judaic texts in one&#x27;s native English can even &quot;trigger a new depth of thought that comes from the subtleties of a finer understanding.&quot;

ArtScroll publications are best identified through the &quot;hallmark features&quot; of its design elements such as typeface and layout, through which &quot;ArtScroll books constitute a field of visual interaction that enables and encourages the reader to navigate the text in particular ways.&quot; The emphasis on design and layout can be understood &quot;as a strategy on the part of the publisher to achieve a range of cognitive as well as esthetic effects.&quot; The name ArtScroll was chosen for the publishing company to emphasize the visual appeal of the books.

=== Prayerbooks ===
Mesorah Publications received widespread acclaim in response to its ArtScroll line of prayerbooks, starting with &quot;The Complete ArtScroll Siddur&quot;, Ed. Nosson Scherman, 1984. This work gained wide acceptance in the Orthodox Jewish community, and within a few years became a popular Hebrew-English &quot;siddur&quot; (prayerbook) in the United States. It offered the reader detailed notes and instructions on most of the prayers and versions of this prayerbook were produced for the High Holidays, and the three pilgrimage festivals Passover, Sukkot and Shavuot.

They are also well-known for their range of interlinear translated prayerbooks and machzorim, of which the design has been patent protected.

While many Conservative synagogues rely on the &quot;Siddur Sim Shalom&quot; or &quot;Or Hadash&quot; prayer books and &quot;Etz Hayim Humash&quot;, &quot;a small but growing number of North American Conservative Jewish congregations ... have recently adopted ArtScroll prayer books and Bibles as their &#x27;official&#x27; liturgical texts, not to mention a much larger number of Conservative synagogues that over recent years have grown accustomed to individual congregants participating in prayer services with editions of ArtScroll prayer books in their hands.&quot; The shift has mainly occurred among more traditionally minded Conservative congregants and rabbis (sometimes labeled &quot;Conservadox&quot;) &quot;as an adequate representation of the more traditional liturgy they seek to embrace.&quot;

Since the advent of ArtScroll, a number of Jewish publishers have printed books and siddurim with similar typefaces and commentary, but with a different commentary and translation philosophy.

=== Stone Chumash ===

In 1993, Mesorah Publications published &quot;The Chumash: The Stone Edition&quot;, a translation and commentary on the Chumash arranged for liturgical use and sponsored by Irving I. Stone of American Greetings, Cleveland, Ohio. It has since become a widely available English-Hebrew Torah translation and commentary in the U.S. and other English-speaking countries.

A 2018 review of Hebrew-English Chumashim said that ArtScroll&#x27;s &quot;Stone Edition Chumash&quot;, often called The Stone Chumash, is &quot;the most successful Orthodox replacement for the&quot; Hertz Chumash.

== Schottenstein Edition Talmud ==

Mesorah has a line of Mishnah translations and commentaries, and a line of Babylonian Talmud translations and commentaries, The Schottenstein Edition of The &quot;Talmud Bavli&quot; (&quot;Babylonian Talmud&quot;). The set of Talmud was completed in late 2004, giving a 73 volume English edition of the entire Talmud. This was the second complete translation of the Talmud into English (the other being the Soncino Talmud published in the United Kingdom during the mid-twentieth century). The first volume, Tractate Makkos, was published in 1990, and dedicated by Mr. and Mrs. Marcos Katz. Jerome Schottenstein was introduced by Rabbi Dr. Norman Lamm to the publication committee shortly thereafter. He began by donating funds for the project in memory of his parents Ephraim and Anna Schottenstein one volume at a time, and later decided to back the entire project. When Jerome died, his children and widow, Geraldine, rededicated the project to his memory in addition to those of his parents. The goal of the project was to, &quot;open the doors of the Talmud and welcome its people inside.&quot;

The text generally consists of two side-by-side pages: one of the Aramaic/Hebrew Vilna Edition text, and the corresponding page consists of an English translation. The English translation has a bolded literal translation of the Talmud&#x27;s text, but also includes un-bolded text clarifying the literal translation. (The original Talmud&#x27;s text is often very unclear, referring to places, times, people, and laws that it does not explain. The un-bolded text attempts to explain these situations. The text of the Talmud also contains few prepositions, articles, etc. The un-bolded text takes the liberty of inserting these parts of speech.) The result is an English text that reads in full sentences with full explanations, while allowing the reader to distinguish between direct translation and a more liberal approach to the translation. (This also results in one page of the Vilna Talmud requiring several pages of English translation.) Below the English translation appear extensive notes including diagrams.

ArtScroll&#x27;s English explanations and footnoted commentary in the Schottenstein Edition of the Talmud are based on the perspective of classical Jewish sources. The clarifying explanation is generally based on the viewpoint of Rashi, the medieval commentator who wrote the first comprehensive commentary on the Talmud. The Schottenstein Edition does not include contemporary academic or critical scholarship. The overall guidelines follow a pattern defined by the late Rabbi Hersh Goldwurm, &quot;a Monsey, N.Y., scholar who died in 1993.&quot; The total cost of the project is estimated at US$21 million, most of which was contributed by private donors and foundations. Some volumes have up to 2 million copies in distribution, while more recent volumes have only 90,000 copies currently printed. A completed set was dedicated on February 9, 2005, to the Library of Congress, and the siyum (celebration at the &quot;completion&quot;) was held on March 15, 2005, the 13th yahrzeit of Jerome Schottenstein, at the New York Hilton. The blue-covered Hebrew Talmud set, which like the English counterpart is 73 volumes, has a HasKaMa (approbation) from a Bobover Rebbe, Grand Rabbi Naftali Halberstam. A French language set was begun.

Mesorah and the Schottenstein family have also printed a Hebrew version of the commentary and have begun both an English and Hebrew translation of the &quot;Talmud Yerushalmi&quot; (Jerusalem Talmud - the Hebrew/Aramaic side of the page, as well as the pagination, is based on the Oz Vehadar edition), Midrash Rabbah and other classical sources.

ArtScroll has also produced the &quot;Elucidated Mishnah&quot;, a work similarly clarifying the Mishnah-text, and expanding thereon in an appended commentary and footnotes; see .

== &quot;Kosher by Design&quot; ==
In 2003, ArtScroll published a cookbook by Susie Fishbein entitled &quot;Kosher by Design: Picture-perfect food for the holidays &amp; every day&quot;. The cookbook contains both traditional recipes and updated versions of traditional recipes. All the recipes are kosher and the book puts an emphasis on its food photography. Since publication, the book has sold over 400,000 copies from 2003 through 2010, and Fishbein has become a media personality, earning the sobriquets of &quot;the Jewish Martha Stewart&quot; and the &quot;kosher diva&quot;. ArtScroll has realized the books&#x27; salability by extending beyond its traditional Orthodox Jewish market into the mainstream market, including sales on Amazon, at Barnes &amp; Noble and Christian evangelical booksellers, in Williams Sonoma stores, and in supermarkets.

==Editorial policy==
Works published by Mesorah under this imprint adhere to a perspective appealing to many Orthodox Jews, but especially to Orthodox Jews who have come from less religious backgrounds, but are returning to the faith (Baalei Teshuva). Due to the makeup of the Jewish community in the US, most of the prayer books are geared to the Ashkenazic custom. In more recent years, ArtScroll has collaborated with Sephardic community leaders in an attempt to bridge this gap. Examples of this include a Sephardic Haggadah published by ArtScroll, written by Sephardic Rabbi Eli Mansour, the book &quot;Aleppo&quot;, about a prominent Sephardic community in Syria, and a Sephardic prayerbook.

In translations and commentaries, ArtScroll accepts midrashic accounts in a historical fashion, and at times literally; it disagrees with textual criticism. Page &quot;X&quot; of the preface to ArtScroll&#x27;s first publication set the tone: A long paragraph includes &quot;&quot;No non-Jewish sources have even been consulted, much less quoted.&quot; I consider it offensive that the Torah should need authentication from the secular or so-called &#x27;scientific&#x27; sources.&quot;

Frequently coalescing to give voice to ArtScroll&#x27;s worldview is, in the words of Scherman, &quot;a heavy combination of &quot;mussar&quot; and &quot;chassidus&quot; that we incorporate into our commentary&quot; such as commentary by Hasidic Rabbis Tzadok HaKohen and Yehudah Leib Alter.

Despite the recent trend of most Haredi press omitting images of women from their magazines or newspapers, ArtScroll continues to publish pictures of women in their books. When someone authoring a biography to be published by ArtScroll requested that pictures of women be left out, ArtScroll &quot;basically told him to go fly a kite, [and] we sent him to an &quot;adam gadol&quot; [a prominent Torah scholar] who basically washed the floors with him.&quot;

=== Transliteration system ===
ArtScroll publications, such as the Stone Editions of Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) and Chumash (Pentateuch) use many more transliterated Hebrew words than English words, compared to editions such as the Tanakh of the Jewish Publication Society. This reflects a higher use of untranslated Hebrew terminology in Haredi English usage.

ArtScroll&#x27;s transliteration system for Hebrew transliteration for readers of the English language generally uses Ashkenazi consonants and Sefardi vowels. The two major differences between the way Sefardi and Ashkenazi Hebrew dialects are transcribed are as follows:
*the letter Tav without a dagesh (emphasis point) is transcribed as [t] and [s] respectively
**ArtScroll uses the latter
*the vowel kamatz gadol, is transcribed [a] and [o] respectively
**ArtScroll uses the former

As such, the following transliterations are used:
== Critical reviews ==
* A large number of grammatical errors exist in their Bible and commentary translations, changing the meaning of these passages. B. Barry Levy alleged in 1981:&quot;Dikduk&quot; (grammar) is anathema in many Jewish circles, but the translation and presentation of texts is, to a large extent, a philological activity and must be philologically accurate. The ArtScroll effort has not achieved a respectable level. There are dozens of cases where prepositions are misunderstood, where verb tenses are not perceived properly and where grammatical or linguistic terms are used incorrectly. Words are often vocalized incorrectly. These observations, it should be stressed, are not limited to the Bible text but refer to the talmudic, midrashic, targumic, medieval and modern works as well. Rabbinical passages are removed from their contexts, presented in fragmentary form thus distorting their contents, emended to update their messages even though these new ideas were not expressed in the texts themselves, misvocalized, and mistranslated: i.e. misrepresented.
* ArtScroll biographies have been criticized as providing incomplete and partial portrayals of Rabbinic figures. Notably, this is not disputed by ArtScroll. Rabbi Nosson Scherman stated that as it pertains to biographies the mission of ArtScroll &quot;is to impart a positive message&quot; without mentioning &quot;disputes that can often become vitriolic.&quot;
* The commentary of Rashbam to the first chapter of Genesis in ArtScroll&#x27;s &quot;Czuker Edition Hebrew Chumash Mikra&#x27;os Gedolos Sefer Bereishis&quot; (2014) has been censored. The missing passages are related to Rashbam&#x27;s interpretation of the phrase in Genesis 1:5, &quot;and there was an evening, and there was a morning, one day.&quot; The Talmud cites these words to support the halakhic view that the day begins at sundown. However, Rashbam takes a peshat (plain sense) approach, as he does throughout his commentary, reading the verse as follows: &quot;There was an evening (at the conclusion of daytime) and a morning (at the end of night), one day&quot;; that is, the day begins in the morning and lasts until the next daybreak. This comment of Rashbam was notably subject to sharp criticism by Ibn Ezra who placed a curse on any publishers who included this comment in their Chumash out of concern that the reading could cause a misinterpretation of Halacha and lead to Shabbat desecration. In their defense, ArtScroll points out that in standard Mikra&#x27;os Gedolos the entire commentary of Rashbam on the beginning of Bereishis is missing. When adding in from older manuscripts, they left out the exegeses to Genesis 1:5 because of questions to its authenticity.

<text>A world war is an international conflict that involves most or all of the world&#x27;s major powers. Conventionally, the term is reserved for two major international conflicts that occurred during the first half of the 20th century, World War I (1914–1918) and World War II (1939–1945), although some historians have also characterized other global conflicts as world wars, such as the Nine Years&#x27; War, the War of the Spanish Succession, the Seven Years&#x27; War, the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, the Cold War, and the War on terror.

==Etymology==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; had cited the first known usage in the English language to a Scottish newspaper, &quot;The People&#x27;s Journal&quot;, in 1848: &quot;A war among the great powers is now necessarily a world-war.&quot; The term &quot;world war&quot; is used by Karl Marx and his associate, Friedrich Engels, in a series of articles published around 1850 called &quot;The Class Struggles in France&quot;. Rasmus B. Anderson in 1889 described an episode in Teutonic mythology as a &quot;world war&quot; (Swedish: &quot;världskrig&quot;), justifying this description by a line in an Old Norse epic poem, &quot;Völuspá: folcvig fyrst I heimi&quot; (&quot;The first great war in the world&quot;). German writer August Wilhelm Otto Niemann used the term &quot;world war&quot; in the title of his anti-British novel, &quot;Der Weltkrieg: Deutsche Träume&quot; (&quot;The World War: German Dreams&quot;) in 1904, published in English as &quot;The Coming Conquest of England&quot;.

The term &quot;first world war&quot; was first used in September 1914 by German biologist and philosopher Ernst Haeckel, who claimed that &quot;there is no doubt that the course and character of the feared &#x27;European War&#x27; ... will become the first world war in the full sense of the word&quot;, citing a wire service report in the &quot;Indianapolis Star&quot; on 20 September 1914. In English, the term &quot;First World War&quot; had been used by Lieutenant Colonel Charles à Court Repington, as a title for his memoirs (published in 1920); he had noted his discussion on the matter with a Major Johnstone of Harvard University in his diary entry of September 10, 1918.

The term &quot;World War I&quot; was coined by &quot;Time&quot; magazine on page 28 of its June 12, 1939, issue. In the same article, on page 32, the term &quot;World WarII&quot; was first used speculatively to describe the upcoming war. The first use for the actual war came in its issue of September 11, 1939. One week earlier, on September 4, the day after France and the United Kingdom declared war on Germany, the Danish newspaper &quot;Kristeligt Dagblad&quot; used the term on its front page, saying &quot;The Second World War broke out yesterday at 11 a.m.&quot;

Speculative fiction authors had been noting the concept of a Second World War in 1919 and 1920, when Milo Hastings wrote his dystopian novel, &quot;City of Endless Night&quot;.

Other languages have also adopted the &quot;world war&quot; terminology; for example, in French, &quot;world war&quot; is translated as ; in German, (which, prior to the war, had been used in the more abstract meaning of a global conflict); in Italian, ; in Spanish and Portuguese, ; in Danish and Norwegian, ; in Polish ; in Russian, (); and in Finnish, .

==History==

===First World War===

The First World War occurred from 1914 to 1918. In terms of human technological history, the scale of World WarI was enabled by the technological advances of the Second Industrial Revolution and the resulting globalization that allowed global power projection and mass production of military hardware. It had been recognized that the complex system of opposing military alliances (the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires against the British, Italian, Russian, and French Empires) was likely, if war broke out, to lead to a worldwide conflict. That caused a very minute conflict between two countries to have the potential to set off a domino effect of alliances, triggering a world war. The fact that the powers involved had large overseas empires virtually guaranteed that such a war would be worldwide, as the colonies&#x27; resources would be a crucial strategic factor. The same strategic considerations also ensured that the combatants would strike at each other&#x27;s colonies, thus spreading the wars far more widely than those of pre-Columbian times. 

War crimes were perpetrated in World War I. Chemical weapons were used in the war despite the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 having outlawed the use of such weapons in warfare. The Ottoman Empire was responsible for the Armenian genocide, during the First World War, as well as other war crimes.

===Second World War===

The Second World War occurred from 1939 to 1945 and is the only conflict in which nuclear weapons have been used; both Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in the Japanese Empire, were devastated by atomic bombs dropped by the United States. The main Axis powers were Nazi Germany, the Empire of Japan, and the Kingdom of Italy; while the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union and China were the &quot;Big Four&quot; Allied powers. Nazi Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, was responsible for genocides, most notably the Holocaust, which murdered demographics considered Untermensch by the Nazis. These included about six million Jews and about five million others, such as Slavs, Roma, homosexuals, and the physically and mentally disabled. The United States, the Soviet Union, and Canada deported and interned minority groups within their own borders and, largely because of the conflict, many ethnic Germans were later expelled from Eastern Europe. Japan was responsible for attacking neutral nations without a declaration of war, such as the attack on Pearl Harbor. It is also known for its brutal treatment and killing of Allied prisoners of war and the inhabitants of Asia. It also used Asians as forced laborers and was responsible for the Nanjing Massacre in which 250,000 civilians were brutally murdered by Japanese troops. Noncombatants suffered at least as badly as or worse than combatants, and the distinction between combatants and noncombatants was often blurred by the belligerents of total war in both conflicts.

The outcome of the war had a profound effect on the course of world history. The old European empires collapsed or they were dismantled as a direct result of the crushing costs of the war and in some cases, their fall was caused by the defeat of imperial powers. The United States became firmly established as the dominant global superpower, along with its close competitor and ideological foe, the Soviet Union. The two superpowers exerted political influence over most of the world&#x27;s nation-states for decades after the end of the Second World War. The modern international security, economic, and diplomatic system was created in the aftermath of the war.

Institutions such as the United Nations were established to collectivize international affairs, with the explicit goal of preventing another outbreak of general war. The wars had also greatly changed the course of daily life. Technologies developed during wartime had a profound effect on peacetime life as well, such as through advances in jet aircraft, penicillin, nuclear energy, and electronic computers.

==Potential third world war==

Since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the Second World War, there has been a widespread and prolonged fear of a potential third world war between nuclear-armed powers. It is often suggested that it would become a nuclear war, and be more devastating and violent than both the First and Second World Wars. Albert Einstein is often quoted as having said in 1947 &quot;I know not with what weapons World WarIII will be fought, but World WarIV will be fought with sticks and stones.&quot; It has been anticipated and planned for by military and civil authorities, and it has also been explored in fiction. Scenarios have ranged from conventional warfare to limited or total nuclear warfare.

Various former government officials, politicians, authors, and military leaders (including James Woolsey, Alexandre de Marenches, Eliot Cohen, and Subcomandante Marcos) have attempted to apply the labels of the &quot;Third World War&quot; and the &quot;Fourth World War&quot; to various past and present global wars since the end of the Second World War, such as the Cold War and the War on terror respectively.

During the early 21st century, the ongoing armed conflicts that are taking place around the world, and their worldwide spillovers are sometimes described as proxy wars waged by the United States and Russia, which led some commentators to characterize the situation as a &quot;proto-world war&quot;, with many countries embroiled in overlapping conflicts.

==Other global conflicts==
The Seven Years&#x27; War (1754/56–1763) was fought across all of North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America. Most of the great powers of the era participated, notably including the British Empire and French Empire, but polities from many continents played important roles. Some historians call it &quot;World War 0&quot; as a result.

Historians like Richard F. Hamilton and Holger H. Herwig created a list of eight world wars, including the two generally agreed-upon world wars, the Seven Years&#x27; War, and five others: the Nine Years&#x27; War (1689–1697), the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714), the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748), the French Revolutionary Wars (1792–1802), and the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815). British historian John Robert Seeley dubbed all of those wars between France and Great Britain (later the UK) between 1689 and 1815 (including the American Revolutionary War from 1775 to 1783) as the Second Hundred Years&#x27; War, echoing an earlier period of conflict between France and England known as the Hundred Years&#x27; War (1337–1453). Some writers have referred to the American Revolutionary War alone as a world war. Others (like William R. Thompson or Chase-Dunn and Sokolovsky) also wants to include the Italian Wars and &quot;Dutch wars&quot; Dutch-Spanish and Anglo-Dutch Wars] as part of Global Wars, while clasificating WW1 and WW2 as the Global &quot;German Wars&quot;, and the Coalition Wars with Wars of Louis XIV as the 2nd and 1st Global &quot;French Wars&quot;. However, other historians prefer to see all of those conflicts as &quot;Hegemonic Wars&quot; or &quot;General Wars&quot;, been inter-regional wars on the grand scale, but not worldly.

Other historians suggest even earlier conflicts to be world wars. For example, Russian ethnologist L. N. Gumilyov called the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 &quot;the World War of the 7th century&quot; because it evolved into a war between the fourfold alliance of the Chinese Empire, the Western Turkic Khaganate, the Khazars, and the Byzantine Empire against a triple union of the Sasanian Empire, the Avars, and the Eastern Turkic Khaganate, with proxy conflicts in Afro-Eurasia (like the Aksumite–Persian wars) and across the Old World.

Others consider that the Ottoman–Portuguese confrontations and Ottoman–Habsburg wars can be considered as world conflicts, prototypes of the &quot;Great Game&quot; in Eurasia and the Scramble for Africa, but between two main power-projecting and religious blocs, the Ottomans, as holders of the Muslim Caliphate, and the Habsburgs, as Holy Roman Emperor.

However, the Americas and Oceania were not involved in those conflicts, in which case, other historians consider the Thirty Years&#x27; War and Eighty Years&#x27; War (specially Iberian–Dutch War) as the first global conflict, pitting the Spanish and Portuguese Empires against the French, Dutch, and British Empires and their allies (mostly Protestants, like Danish and Swedish oversea expeditions) across the five continents.

Another possible example is the Second Congo War (1998–2003) even though it was only waged on one continent. It involved nine nations and led to ongoing low-intensity warfare despite official peace and the first democratic elections in 2006. It has been referred to as &quot;Africa&#x27;s World War&quot;.

<text>Matthew Paris, also known as Matthew of Paris (;  1200 – 1259), was an English Benedictine monk, chronicler, artist in illuminated manuscripts, and cartographer who was based at St Albans Abbey in Hertfordshire. He authored a number of historical works, many of which he scribed and illuminated himself, typically in drawings partly coloured with watercolour washes, sometimes called &quot;tinted drawings&quot;. Some were written in Latin, others in Anglo-Norman or French verse. He is sometimes confused with the nonexistent Matthew of Westminster.

His is a renowned Medieval work, in many cases being a key source for mid-13th century Europe, partially due to his verbose insertion of personal opinions into his narrative and his use of sources such as records, letters, and conversations with witnesses to events including the English king Henry III, earl Richard of Cornwall, the Norwegian king Haakon IV, a number of English bishops, and many others. Modern historians recognise Paris&#x27;s biases. He often tended to glorify Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II and denigrate the pope, expressing strong criticism of centralised church authority and at times royal power. However, in his &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot;, Paris displays a highly negative view of Frederick, going as far as to describe him as a &quot;tyrant&quot; who &quot;committed disgraceful crimes&quot;.

==Life and work==

In spite of his surname and knowledge of the French language, Paris was of English birth, and is believed by some chroniclers to be of the Paris family of Hildersham, Cambridgeshire. He may have studied at Paris in his youth after early education at St Albans School, however this is simply conjecture. The first we know of Matthew Paris (from his own writings) is that he was admitted as a monk to St Albans in 1217. It is on the assumption that he was in his teens on admission that his birth date is estimated; some scholars suspect he may have been ten years or older; many monks only entered monastic life after pursuing a career in the world outside. He was clearly at ease with the nobility and even royalty, which may indicate that he came from a family of some status, although it also seems an indication of his personality. His life was mainly spent in this religious house. In 1248, Paris was sent to Norway as the bearer of a message from Louis IX to Haakon IV; he made himself so agreeable to the Norwegian sovereign that he was invited to superintend the reformation of the Benedictine Nidarholm Abbey outside Trondheim.

Apart from these missions, his known activities were devoted to the composition of history, a pursuit for which the monks of St Albans had long been famous. He inherited the mantle of Roger of Wendover, at that time the abbey&#x27;s foremost chronicler, after Wendover&#x27;s death in 1236. Paris revised Wendover&#x27;s work, a chronicle covering Creation to 1235 known as the &quot;Flores Historiarum&quot;, and added new material of an annalistic nature from 1236 onwards which Paris sustained until his death in 1259. This work, known as the &quot;Chronica Majora,&quot; was thus not only useful to readers of Paris&#x27;s time, and has been used by modern historians as a source document for the period between 1235 and 1259. While this makes Paris&#x27;s &quot;Chronica&quot; currently his most famous work, within the first few hundred years after Paris&#x27;s death this was not the case. Paris scribed 2 major abridgements of his &quot;Chronica&quot;: his &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot;, and a work named like that of Wendover, the &quot;Flores Historiarum&quot;. This manuscript, unlike his &quot;Chronica&quot;, was copied multiple times and at multiple places and within 250 years of the writing of Paris&#x27;s &quot;Flores&quot;, over 20 copies were made. Paris also is known for his illustrations and cartographic ability, often found as marginalia however sometimes being given full pages.

The Dublin MS (see below) contains interesting notes, which shed light on Paris&#x27;s involvement in other manuscripts, and on the way his own were used. They are in French and in his handwriting:
*&quot;If you please you can keep this book till Easter&quot;
*&quot;G, please send to the Lady Countess of Arundel, Isabel, that she is to send you the book about St Thomas the Martyr and St Edward which I copied [translated?] and illustrated, and which the Lady Countess of Cornwall may keep until Whitsuntide&quot;
* &quot;In the Countess of Winchester&#x27;s book let there be a pair of images on each page thus&quot;: (verses follow describing thirteen saints)

It is presumed the last relates to Paris acting as commissioning agent and iconographical consultant for the Countess with another artist.

The lending of his manuscripts to aristocratic households, apparently for periods of weeks or months at a time, suggests why he made several different illustrated versions of his Chronicle.

==Manuscripts by Matthew Paris==

Many of Paris&#x27;s manuscripts aside from his &quot;Chronica&quot; contain multiple texts and often begin with a large assortment of prefatory material, often including full-page miniatures. Some have survived incomplete, and the various elements now bound together may not have been intended to be so by Paris. Unless stated otherwise, all were given by Paris to his monastery (from some inscriptions it seems they were regarded as his property to dispose of). The monastic libraries were broken up at the Dissolution. These MSS seem to have been appreciated, and were quickly collected by bibliophiles. Many of his manuscripts in the British Library are from the Cotton Library.
* . Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, MSS 26 and 16, 362 × 244/248 mm. ff 141 + 281, composed 1240–53. His major historical work (see below), but less heavily illustrated per page than others. These two volumes contain annals from the creation of the world up to the year 1253. The content up to 1234 or 1235 is based in the main on Roger of Wendover&#x27;s &quot;Flores Historiarum&quot;, with additions; after that date, the material is Paris&#x27;s own, and written in his own hand from the annal for 1213 onward. There are 100 marginal drawings (25 + 75), some fragmentary maps and an itinerary, and full-page drawings of William I. MS 16 has very recently had all prefatory matter re-bound separately.
:A continuation of the &quot;Chronica&quot;, from 1254 until Paris&#x27;s death in 1259, is bound with the &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot; in the British Library volume below. An unillustrated copy of the material from 1189 to 1250, with much of his sharper commentary about Henry III toned down or removed, was supervised by Paris himself and now exists as British Library Cotton MS Nero D V, fol. 162–393.
* &quot;Flores Historiarum&quot;. Chetham&#x27;s Hospital and Library, Manchester, MS 6712. Only part of the text, covering 1241 to 1249, is in Paris&#x27;s hand, though he is credited with the authorship of the whole text, which is an abridgement of the &quot;Chronica&quot; with additions from the annals of Reading and of Southwark. Additional interpolations to the text make it clear the volume was created for Westminster Abbey. It was apparently started there, copying another MS of Paris&#x27;s text that went up to 1240. Later it was sent back to the author for him to update; Richard Vaughan argues this was in 1251–2. The illustrations are similar to Paris&#x27;s style but not by him. Later additions took the chronicle up to 1327.
* &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot;. British Library, Royal MS 14 C VII, fols. 8v–156v. 358 × 250 mm, ff 232 in all. A history of England, begun in 1250 and perhaps completed around 1255, covering the years 1070–1253. The text is an abridgement of the &quot;Chronica&quot;, also drawing on Wendover&#x27;s &quot;Flores Historiarum&quot; and Paris&#x27;s earlier edited version of the &quot;Chronica&quot;. Bound with it is the final part of Paris&#x27;s , covering the years 1254–1259 (folios 157–218), and prefatory material including an itinerary from London to Jerusalem and tinted drawings of the kings of England. All is in Paris&#x27;s own hand, apart from folios 210–218 and 154v–156v, which are in the hand of the scribe who has added a note of Matthew Paris&#x27;s death (f. 218v). The &quot;Chronica&quot; concludes with a portrait of Paris on his death-bed, presumably not by him. By the 15th century this volume belonged to Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, son of Henry IV, who inscribed it &quot;Ceste livre est a moy Homffrey Duc de Gloucestre&quot;. Later it was held by the bishop of Lincoln, who wrote a note that if the monks of St Albans could prove the book was a loan, they should have it back. Otherwise, it was bequeathed to New College, Oxford. The fact that the book was acquired by a 16th-century Earl of Arundel suggests that Duke Humphrey&#x27;s inscription was not entirely accurate, as New College would probably not have disposed of it.
* &quot;Abbreviatio chronicorum&quot; (or &quot;Historia minor&quot;), British Library Cotton MS Claudius D VI, fols. 5–100. Another shortened history, mainly covering 1067 to 1253. Probably begun , it remained unfinished at Paris&#x27;s death. Illustrated with thirty-three seated figures of English kings illustrating a genealogy. It also contains the most developed of Paris&#x27;s four maps of Great Britain.
* &quot;Chronica excerpta a magnis cronicis&quot;. British Library Cotton MS Vitellius A XX, folios 77r–108v. Covers from 1066 to 1246. Written at some point between 1246 and 1259. Not definitely by Paris, but evidently written under his supervision, with some of the text in his own hand.
* &quot;Liber Additamentorum&quot;. British Library Cotton MS Nero D I, ff 202 in all, contains maps, the illustrated&quot;Vitae duorum Offarum&quot;, the &quot;Gesta Abbatum&quot; (the lives of the first 23 abbots of St Albans with a miniature portrait of each), coats of arms, as well as a large number copies of original documents such as letters. The from-life original version of his well-known drawing of an elephant is in this volume, as is a large drawing of Christ, not by Paris.
* &quot;Life of St Alban&quot; etc., dating controversial (1230–1250), Trinity College, Dublin Library, Ms 177 (former Ms E.I.40) 77 ff with 54 miniatures, mostly half-page. 240 × 165 mm. Also contains a &quot;Life of St Amphibalus&quot;, and various other works relating to the history of St Albans Abbey, both also illustrated. The &quot;Life of St Alban&quot; is in French verse, adapted from a Latin &quot;Life of St Alban&quot; by William of St Albans, ca. 1178. The manuscript also contains notes in Paris&#x27;s hand (see above) showing that his manuscripts were lent to various aristocratic ladies for periods, and that he probably acted as an intermediary between commissioners of manuscripts and the (probably) lay artists who produced them, advising on the calendars and iconography.
* &quot;Life of King Edward the Confessor&quot; 1230s or 40s, Cambridge University Library MS. Ee.3.59. This is the only surviving copy of this work, but is believed to be a slightly later copy made in London, probably by court artists, of Paris&#x27;s text and framed illustrations. Based on the Latin Life of Edward the Confessor by Aelred of Rievaulx,  1162.
* &quot;Life of St Thomas of Canterbury&quot;, British Library, Loan MS 88 – Four leaves (the &quot;Becket Leaves&quot;) survive from a French-verse history of the life of Thomas Becket with large illuminations. Based on the Latin &quot;Quadrilogus&quot; compiled by Elias of Evesham at Crowland Abbey in 1198. The illuminations are attributed to Paris by Janet Backhouse, but not by Nigel Morgan. Vaughan had previously noted that the leaves from the &quot;Life of St Thomas&quot; and the &quot;Life of King Edward&quot; are of different sizes, and written by different scribes, neither of them Paris himself, so they are not likely to be part of the manuscript that Paris wrote of having lent to the Countess of Arundel; but that, &quot;to judge from the script and the style of illumination&quot; they are &quot;very close copies of Matthew [Paris]&#x27;s original&quot;.
* &quot;Life of St Edmund&quot;, a French-verse history of the life of Edmund Rich, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1233 to 1240. Based on Paris&#x27;s own Latin prose life of Rich, composed in the late 1240s, which drew on a collection of materials made at Pontigny, statements from Robert Bacon and Richard Wych, Bishop of Chichester, and other materials including from Paris&#x27;s own histories. A 14th-century copy of the prose life has survived in British Library Cotton MS Julius D VI, folios 123–156v. One copy of the verse life that was in Cotton MS Vitellius D VIII was destroyed in the fire of 1731; but another copy was discovered in the early 1900s at Welbeck Abbey and is now in the British Library.
* &quot;Liber Experimentarius&quot; of Bernardus Silvestris, and other fortune-telling tracts. Bodleian Library, Oxford, Ms. Ashmole 304, 176 × 128 mm, ff72. Many illustrations: author portraits (many of ancient Greeks – Socrates, Plato, Euclid, Pythagoras), birds, tables and diagrams of geomantic significance. Several later copies of the text and illustrations survive. Provenance before 1602 unknown.
* Miscellaneous writings by John of Wallingford (the Younger), British Library, MS Cotton Julius D VII, 188 × 130 mm, ff. 134. 1247–58. Mostly scribed by John of Wallingford, another monk of St Albans, who also probably did some drawings. A portrait of John, a map of the British Isles, and a Christ in Majesty are all accepted as by Paris. The main text is a chronicle, highly derivative of Paris&#x27;s. This was John&#x27;s property, left to his final monastery at Wymondham.

Also, fragments of a Latin biography of Stephen Langton. Various other works, especially maps.

A panel painting on oak of St Peter, the only surviving part of a tabernacle shrine (1850 × 750 mm), in the Museum of Oslo University has been attributed to Paris, presumably dating from his visit in 1248. Local paintings are usually on pine, so he may have brought this with him, or sent it later.

==Paris as an artist==

In some of Paris&#x27;s manuscripts, a framed miniature occupies the upper half of the page, and in others, they are &quot;marginal&quot; – unframed and occupying the bottom quarter (approximately) of the page. Tinted drawings were an established style well before Paris, and became especially popular in the first half of the 13th century. They were certainly much cheaper and quicker than fully painted illuminations. The tradition of tinted drawings or outline drawings with ink supplemented by coloured wash was distinctively English, dating back to the Anglo-Saxon art of the mid-10th century, and connected with the English Benedictine Reform of the period. A strong influence on one branch of the style was the Carolingian Utrecht Psalter, which was at Canterbury from about 1000 to 1640. This was copied in the 1020s in the Harley Psalter, and in the Eadwine Psalter of the mid-12th century.

Recent scholarship, notably that of Nigel Morgan, suggests that Paris&#x27;s influence on other artists of the period has been exaggerated. This is likely because so much more is known about him than other English illuminators of the period, who are mostly anonymous. Most manuscripts seem to have been produced by lay artists in this period. William de Brailes is shown with a clerical tonsure, but he was married, which suggests he had minor orders only. The manuscripts produced by Paris show few signs of collaboration, but art historians detect a School of St Albans surviving after Paris&#x27;s death, influenced by him.

Paris&#x27;s style suggests that it was formed by works from around 1200. He was somewhat old-fashioned in retaining a roundness in his figures, rather than adopting the thin angularity of most of his artist contemporaries, especially those in London. His compositions are very inventive; his position as a well-connected monk may have given him more confidence in creating new compositions, whereas a lay artist would prefer to stick to traditional formulae. It may also reflect the lack of full training in the art of the period. His colouring emphasises green and blue, and together with his characteristic layout of a picture in the top half of a page, is relatively distinctive. What are probably his final sketches are found in &quot;Vitae duorum Offarum&quot; in BL MS Cotton Nero D I.

==Paris as a historian==
From 1235, the point at which Wendover dropped his pen, Paris continued the history on the plan which his predecessors had followed. He derived much of his information from the letters of important people, which he sometimes inserts, but much more from conversations with the eyewitnesses of events. Among his informants were Richard, Earl of Cornwall, and King Henry III, with whom he appears to have been on intimate terms.

The king knew that Paris was writing a history, and wanted it to be as exact as possible. In 1257, in the course of a week&#x27;s visit to St Albans, Henry kept the chronicler beside him night and day, &quot;and guided my pen,&quot; says Paris, &quot;with much goodwill and diligence.&quot; It is curious that the gives so unfavourable an account of the king&#x27;s policy. Henry Richards Luard supposes that Paris never intended his work to be read in its present form. Many passages of the autograph have written next to them, the &quot;note offendiculum&quot;, which shows that the writer understood the danger which he ran. On the other hand, unexpurgated copies were made in Paris&#x27;s lifetime. Although the offending passages are duly omitted or softened in his abridgement of his longer work, the &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot; (written about 1253), Paris&#x27;s real feelings must have been an open secret. There is no ground for the old theory that he was an official historiographer.

Naturalists have praised his descriptions of the English wildlife of his time, despite their often being brief; in particular his valuable description of the first recorded irruption of common crossbills into England in 1254.

==Paris as cartographer==

Outstanding among his other maps were (four versions of) a pilgrim itinerary charting the route from London to Rome in graphic form. A sequence of pictures of towns on the route marked the terminus of each day&#x27;s travel, enabling the viewer to envisage and follow the whole journey rather like a comic strip – an achievement unprecedented elsewhere in the medieval world.

==Studies of Matthew Paris==
The relation of Matthew Paris&#x27;s work to those of John de Celia (John of Wallingford) and Roger of Wendover may be studied in Henry Luard&#x27;s edition of the (7 vols., Rolls series, 1872–1881), which contains valuable prefaces. The &quot;Historia Anglorum sive historia minor&quot; (1067–1253) has been edited by Frederic Madden (3 vols., Rolls series, 1866–1869).

Matthew Paris is sometimes confused with Matthew of Westminster, the reputed author of the &quot;Flores historiarum&quot; edited by Luard (3 vols., Rolls series, 1890). This work, compiled by various hands, is an edition of Matthew Paris, with continuations extending to 1326.

He wrote a life of St Edmund of Abingdon, sometime Archbishop of Canterbury.

He also wrote the Anglo-Norman &quot;La Estoire de Seint Aedward le Rei&quot; (the History of Saint Edward the King), which survives in a beautifully illuminated manuscript version, Cambridge, Cambridge University Library MS. Ee.3.59. The manuscript has had a varied publication history. Sections were printed in Francisque Michel&#x27;s &quot;Chroniques Anglo-Normandes&quot;. Luard&#x27;s edition for the Rolls series was severely criticised; it was re-edited for the Anglo-Norman Text Society by K. Y. Wallace. A facsimile for the Roxburghe Club was edited by M. R. James, and the whole manuscript has been digitalized and can be seen online.

Paris House at St Albans High School for Girls is named after him.

<doc id="142739" wikidata="Q3987215" url="?curid=142739" title="The Ghost Road">
<text>The Ghost Road is a war novel by Pat Barker, first published in 1995 and winner of the Booker Prize. It is the third volume of a trilogy that follows the fortunes of shell-shocked British army officers towards the end of the First World War. The other books in the trilogy are &quot;Regeneration&quot; and &quot;The Eye in the Door&quot;.

The war poet Siegfried Sassoon, who appears as a major character in the first book, &quot;Regeneration&quot;, is relegated to a minor role in this final volume, in which the main players are the fictional working-class officer Billy Prior and the real-life psychoanalyst William Rivers. Thus Barker explores possible relationships between real people and fictional characters.

==Plot summary==
Prior, despite his new-found peace of mind and engagement to munitions worker Sarah, has been affected by the war and therefore does not have a lot of concern for his safety. Prior has been cured of shell-shock and is preparing to return to France. Prior experiences numerous and risky sexual encounters; his only rule is that he never pays for sex – a rule he eventually breaks.

Rivers, concerned for Prior&#x27;s safety, finally recognises that his relationship with Prior, and his other patients for that matter, is deeply paternal. In contrast with upper-class officers like Sassoon, with whom Rivers has been able to form warm friendships, he has always found Prior to be a thorn in his side. As Prior returns to the front, Rivers continues to take care of his patients and his invalid sister; amid this, he reminisces uncomfortably about his childhood and memories of his experience ten years earlier on an anthropological expedition to Simbo (then called Eddystone Island) in the Solomon Islands in Melanesia. There, he befriended Njiru, the local priest-healer who took Rivers on his rounds to see sick villagers and also to the island&#x27;s sacred Place of the Skulls. With him on the expedition was Arthur Maurice Hocart.

This episode is a symbolic capitulation to the inevitability of Prior&#x27;s death at the Western Front, a fate he shares with the poet Wilfred Owen. In a futile battle that takes place a few days before the Armistice, Billy and his friend Owen are killed.

==Themes==
War is a theme that is both overt and hidden. Although the most obvious theme is war between nations, The Ghost Road also details war between individuals and war within oneself. The book is written against a background of the end of World War I in 1918, but it is also filled with flashbacks to a pre-World War I time on a South Pacific island. While the Melanesian island of Eddystone isn&#x27;t caught up in the world&#x27;s woes, it constantly fights for its own existence

<text>Ada Brand Thomson (22 July 1929 – 3 October 1982), known professionally as Vivien Merchant, was an English actress. She began her career in 1942, and became known for dramatic roles on stage and in films. In 1956 she married the playwright Harold Pinter and performed in many of his plays.

Merchant achieved considerable success from the 1950s to the 1970s, winning the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress in 1964. For her role in the film &quot;Alfie&quot; (1966), she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and won the BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer. In 1967, she starred in the Broadway production of Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Homecoming&quot;, and received a Tony Award nomination. Her other films included &quot;Accident&quot; (1967), &quot;The Offence&quot; (1972), &quot;Frenzy&quot; (1972), &quot;The Homecoming&quot; (1973), and &quot;The Maids&quot; (1975). Suffering from depression and alcoholism as her marriage ended, she died in 1982, two years after her divorce.

==Career==
Merchant took her stage name as a composite of the actress Vivien Leigh and her brother, who was a merchant seaman (cited by Michael Billington). She began acting professionally in 1942, with supporting juvenile roles in repertory, progressing to West End roles in such works as Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Sigh No More&quot; and &quot;Ace of Clubs&quot;, becoming an established lead in repertory in the early 1950s. Merchant subsequently performed in many stage productions and several films, including &quot;Alfie&quot; (1966), &quot;Accident&quot; (1967), &quot;Frenzy&quot; (1972), and &quot;The Offence&quot; (also 1972). Her performance in &quot;Alfie&quot; gained her Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress, and won her the BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer and the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actress.

After Merchant married the playwright Harold Pinter in 1956, she appeared in many of his plays, including the 1960 revival of his first play, &quot;The Room&quot; at the Hampstead Theatre, &quot;A Slight Ache&quot;, &quot;A Night Out&quot;, &quot;The Collection&quot;, and &quot;The Lover&quot;; the last was also a celebrated television production partnering Alan Badel at Associated Rediffusion, for which she was given an Evening Standard Theatre Award for Best Newcomer and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress, both in 1963.

Merchant subsequently appeared as Wendy in &quot;Tea Party&quot; opposite Leo McKern in 1965. She starred as Ruth in &quot;The Homecoming&quot; (1964) on stage in both London in 1965 and New York in 1967, receiving a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Play. She went on to star in the film version in 1973. The last of his plays in which she performed on stage was &quot;Old Times&quot; (1971) as Anna. She played Lady Macbeth to Paul Scofield&#x27;s Macbeth for the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1967, directed by Sir Peter Hall.

Merchant took the role of Madame in the Greenwich Theatre revival of Jean Genet&#x27;s &quot;The Maids&quot; partnering Glenda Jackson and Susannah York: This was filmed in 1974 by Christopher Miles. In 1975, Merchant and Timothy Dalton headed the cast of a revival of Coward&#x27;s &quot;The Vortex&quot; at the Greenwich Theatre.

==Personal life==
Merchant was the first wife of Harold Pinter, whom she met while working as a repertory actress; he was then working as an actor under the stage name of David Baron. They married in 1956, and their son, Daniel, was born in 1958.

Their marriage began disintegrating in the mid-1960s. From 1962 to 1969, Pinter had a clandestine affair with Joan Bakewell, which inspired his play &quot;Betrayal&quot;. In 1975, he began a serious affair with the historian Lady Antonia Fraser, the wife of Sir Hugh Fraser, which he confessed to his wife that March. At first, Merchant took it very well, saying positive things about Fraser, according to her friend artist Guy Vaesen (as cited by Billington); but, Vaesen recalled, after &quot;a female friend of Vivien&#x27;s trotted round to her house and poisoned her mind against Antonia ... life in Hanover Terrace [where the Pinters then lived] gradually became impossible&quot;. Pinter left, and Merchant filed for divorce and gave interviews to the tabloid press, expressing her distress. Merchant made some unflattering comments about Fraser at this time: &quot;He didn&#x27;t need to take a change of shoes. He can always wear hers. She has very big feet, you know.&quot; Merchant believed Fraser to be the basis for the character of Emma in Pinter&#x27;s play &quot;Betrayal&quot;, never learning about his prior affair with Joan Bakewell.

The Frasers&#x27; divorce became final in 1977, and the Pinters&#x27; in 1980. In 1980, Pinter and Fraser married.

===Death===
Merchant became deeply depressed after the end of her marriage to Pinter and turned to drinking. She died at the age of 53 on 3 October 1982, from alcoholism.

<doc id="142743" wikidata="Q94608" url="?curid=142743" title="William Caxton">
<text>William Caxton () was an English merchant, diplomat and writer. He is thought to be the first person to introduce a printing press into England in 1476, and as a printer to be the first English retailer of printed books.

His parentage and date of birth are not known for certain, but he may have been born between 1415 and 1424, perhaps in the Weald or wood land of Kent, perhaps in Hadlow or Tenterden. In 1438 he was apprenticed to Robert Large, a wealthy London silk mercer.

Shortly after Large&#x27;s death, Caxton moved to Bruges, Belgium, a wealthy cultured city in which he was settled by 1450. Successful in business, he became governor of the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London; on his business travels, he observed the new printing industry in Cologne, which led him to start a printing press in Bruges in collaboration with Colard Mansion. When Margaret of York, sister of Edward IV, married the Duke of Burgundy, they moved to Bruges and befriended Caxton. Margaret encouraged Caxton to complete his translation of the &quot;Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye&quot;, a collection of stories associated with Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, which he did in 1471.

On his return to England, heavy demand for his translation prompted Caxton to set up a press at Westminster in 1476. Although the first book that he is known to have produced was an edition of Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, he went on to publish chivalric romances, classical works and English and Roman histories and to edit many others. He was the first to translate &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; in 1484. Caxton was not an adequate translator, and under pressure to publish as much as possible as quickly as possible, he sometimes simply transferred French words into English; but because of the success of his translations, he is credited with helping to promote the Chancery English that he used to the status of standard dialect throughout England.

In 2002, Caxton was named among the &quot;100 Greatest Britons&quot; in a BBC poll.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Caxton&#x27;s family &quot;fairly certainly&quot; consisted of his parents, Philip and Dionisia, and a brother, Philip. However, the charters used as evidence there are for the manor of Little Wratting in Suffolk; in one charter, this William Caxton is referred to as &quot;otherwise called Causton saddler&quot;.

One possible candidate for William&#x27;s father is Thomas Caxton of Tenterden, Kent, who was like William, a mercer. He was one of the defendants in a case in the Court of Common Pleas in Easter term 1420: Kent. John Okman, versus &quot;Thomas Kaxton, of Tentyrden, mercer&quot;, and Joan who was the wife of Thomas Ive, executors of Thomas Ive, for the return of two bonds (scripta obligatoria) which they unjustly retain.

Caxton&#x27;s date of birth is unknown. Records place it in 1415–1424, based on the fact that his apprenticeship fees were paid in 1438. Caxton would have been 14 at the date of apprenticeship, but masters often paid the fees late. In the preface to his first printed work &quot;The Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye&quot;, he claims to have been born and educated in the Weald of Kent. Oral tradition in Tonbridge claims that Caxton was born there; the same with Tenterden. One of the manors of Hadlow was Caustons, owned by the Caxton (De Causton) family. A house in Hadlow reputed to be the birthplace of William Caxton was dismantled in 1936 and incorporated into a larger house rebuilt in Forest Row, East Sussex. Further evidence for Hadlow is that various place names nearby are frequently mentioned by Caxton.

Caxton was in London by 1438, when the registers of the Mercers&#x27; Company record his apprenticeship to Robert Large, a wealthy London mercer or dealer in luxury goods, who served as Master of the Mercers&#x27; Company, and Lord Mayor of London in 1439. After Large died in 1441, Caxton was left a small sum of money (£20). As other apprentices were left larger sums, it would seem that he was not a senior apprentice at this time.

===Printing and later life===

Caxton was making trips to Bruges by 1450 and had settled there by 1453, when he may have taken his Liberty of the Mercers&#x27; Company. There, he was successful in business and became governor of the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London. His trade brought him into contact with Burgundy and it was thus that he became a member of the household of Margaret, Duchess of Burgundy, the third wife of Charles the Bold and sister of two kings of England: Edward IV and Richard III. That led to more continental travel, including to Cologne, in the course of which he observed the new printing industry and was significantly influenced by German printing.

He wasted no time in setting up a printing press in Bruges in collaboration with a Fleming, Colard Mansion, and the first book to be printed in English was produced in 1473: &quot;Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye&quot; was a translation by Caxton himself. In the epilogue of the book, Caxton tells how his &quot;pen became worn, his hand weary, his eye dimmed&quot; with copying the book by hand and so he &quot;practiced and learnt&quot; how to print it. His translation had become popular in the Burgundian court, and requests for copies of it were the stimulus for him to set up a press.
Bringing the knowledge back to England, he set up the country&#x27;s first-ever press in The Almonry area of Westminster in 1476. The first book known to have been produced there was an edition of Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; (Blake, 2004–07). Another early title was &quot;Dictes or Sayengis of the Philosophres&quot; (&quot;Sayings of the Philosophers&quot;), first printed on 18 November 1477, translated by Earl Rivers, the king&#x27;s brother-in-law. Caxton&#x27;s translations of the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; (1483) and &quot;The Book of the Knight in the Tower&quot; (1484) contain perhaps the earliest verses of the Bible to be printed in English. He produced the first translation of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; in English. His translation of the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; was based on the French translation of Jean de Vignay.

Caxton produced chivalric romances (such as &quot;Fierabras&quot;), the most important of which was Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; (1485); classical works; and English and Roman histories. These books appealed to the English upper classes in the late 15th century. Caxton was supported by (but not dependent on) members of the nobility and the gentry. He may also have been paid by the authors of works such as Lorenzo Gulielmo Traversagni, who wrote the &quot;Epitome margaritae eloquentiae&quot;, which Caxton published .

The John Rylands Library in Manchester holds the second-largest collection of printing by Caxton, after the British Library&#x27;s collection. Of the Rylands collection of more than 60 examples 36 are complete and unsophisticated copies and four are unique.

===Death and memorials===
Caxton&#x27;s precise date of death is uncertain, but estimates from the records of his burial in St. Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, suggest that he died near March 1492. However, George D. Painter makes numerous references to the year 1491 in his book &quot;William Caxton: a biography&quot; as the year of Caxton&#x27;s death since 24 March was the last day of the year according to the calendar that used at the time and so the year change had not yet happened. Painter writes, &quot;However, Caxton&#x27;s own output reveals the approximate time of his death, for none of his books can be later than 1491, and even those which are assignable to that year are hardly enough for a full twelve months&#x27; production; so a date of death towards autumn of 1491 could be deduced even without confirmation of documentary evidence.&quot;

Wynkyn de Worde, a Fleming, became the owner of the printing plant after Caxton&#x27;s death and carried it on for forty-three years. Wynkyn prospered, continuing to put out a steady succession of editions of the small popular pamphlets which were started in Caxton&#x27;s time. 

In 1820, a memorial tablet to Caxton was provided in St Margaret&#x27;s by the Roxburghe Club and its President, Earl Spencer.

In November 1954, a memorial to Caxton was unveiled in Westminster Abbey by J. J. Astor, chairman of the Press Council. The white stone plaque is on the wall next to the door to Poets&#x27; Corner. The inscription reads:

In 1976 the &quot;Quincentenary of the Introduction of Printing into England&quot; exhibit was held at the British Library. There were forty-five events during the quincentenary including the Caxton International Congress at the Printing Historical Society, and exhibits at the John Rylands Library, Westminster Abbey, and Cambridge University Library.

==Caxton and the English language==
Caxton printed 80 percent of his works in the English language. He translated a large number of works into English and performed much of the translation and the editing work himself. He is credited with printing as many as 108 books, 87 of which were different titles, including the first English translation of &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; (26 March 1484). Caxton also translated 26 of the titles himself. His major guiding principle in translating was an honest desire to provide the most linguistically exact replication of foreign language texts into English, but the hurried publishing schedule and his inadequate skill as a translator often led to wholesale transference of French words into English and to numerous misunderstandings.
The English language was changing rapidly in Caxton&#x27;s time, and the works that he was given to print were in a variety of styles and dialects. Caxton was a technician, rather than a writer, and he often faced dilemmas concerning language standardisation in the books that he printed. He wrote about that subject in the preface to his &quot;Eneydos&quot;. His successor Wynkyn de Worde faced similar problems.

Caxton is credited with standardising the English language through printing by homogenising regional dialects and largely adopting the London dialect. That facilitated the expansion of English vocabulary, the regularisation of inflection and syntax and a widening gap between the spoken and the written words. Richard Pynson started printing in London in 1491 or 1492 and favoured what came to be called Chancery Standard, largely based on the London dialect. Pynson was a more accomplished stylist than Caxton and consequently pushed the English language further toward standardisation.

It is asserted that the spelling of &quot;ghost&quot; with the silent letter &quot;h&quot; was adopted by Caxton from the influence of Flemish spelling habits.

===Caxton&#x27;s &quot;egges&quot; anecdote===

In Caxton&#x27;s prologue to the 1490 edition of his translation of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, called by him &quot;Eneydos&quot;, he refers to the problems of finding a standardised English. Caxton recounts what took place when a boat sailing from London to Zeeland was becalmed, and landed on the Kent side of the Thames.

A mercer called Sheffield was from the north of England. He went into a house and asked the &quot;good wyf&quot; if he could buy some &quot;&quot;. She replied that she could not speak French, which annoyed him, as he could also not speak French. A bystander suggested that Sheffield was asking for &quot;&quot;, which the woman said she understood. After recounting the interaction, Caxton wrote: &quot;Loo what ſholde a man in thyſe dayes now wryte egges or eyren/ certaynly it is harde to playſe euery man/ by cauſe of dyuerſite ⁊ chaũge of langage&quot; (&quot;Lo, what should a man in these days now write: egges or eyren? Certainly it is hard to please every man because of diversity and change of language&quot;).

<doc id="142745" wikidata="Q1292947" url="?curid=142745" title="Edward Marsh (polymath)">
<text>Sir Edward Howard Marsh (18 November 1872 – 13 January 1953) was a British polymath, translator, arts patron and civil servant. He was the sponsor of the Georgian school of poets and a friend to many poets, including Rupert Brooke and Siegfried Sassoon. In his career as a civil servant he worked as private secretary to a succession of the United Kingdom&#x27;s most powerful ministers, particularly Winston Churchill. He was a discreet but influential figure within Britain&#x27;s homosexual community.

==Early life==
Marsh&#x27;s father was Howard Marsh, a surgeon and later Master of Downing College, Cambridge. His mother, born Jane Perceval, was a granddaughter of prime minister Spencer Perceval, and a daughter of Spencer Perceval, MP, one of the twelve &quot;apostles&quot; recognized by the movement associated with Edward Irving and known as the Catholic Apostolic Church. Jane, a nurse, was one of the founders of the Alexandra Hospital for Children with Hip Disease; Howard was a surgeon at the hospital. Marsh was educated at Westminster School, London, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied classics under Arthur Woollgar Verrall. At Cambridge, he became associated with R. C. Trevelyan, Bertrand Russell, G. E. Moore, and Maurice Baring. He was a Cambridge Apostle.

==Civil servant==
In 1896 he was appointed Assistant Private Secretary to Joseph Chamberlain, the Colonial Secretary. When Chamberlain resigned in 1903, Marsh became Private Secretary to his successor, Alfred Lyttelton. When Winston Churchill became Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1905 during Henry Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s first Government, Marsh became Churchill&#x27;s Private Secretary, beginning an association and friendship that would last until Marsh&#x27;s death. Marsh would be Churchill&#x27;s Private Secretary for the next ten years, until Churchill left the Government in 1915. As Randolph Churchill, Winston&#x27;s son put it, from December 1905, &quot;Marsh was to accompany Churchill to every Government department he occupied: to the Board of Trade, the Home Office, the Admiralty, the Duchy of Lancaster, the Ministry of Munitions, the War Office, back to his original Colonial Office and the Treasury.&quot; The moves were somewhat irregular as Marsh remained, until 1937, officially a clerk at the Colonial Office, but many exceptions were made, possibly at a cost to Marsh&#x27;s official advancement.

When Churchill left government for the first time in 1915, Marsh became Assistant Private Secretary to Prime Minister H. H. Asquith in which position he served until the fall of Asquith&#x27;s government in December 1916. When Churchill returned to government as Minister of Munitions in 1916, Marsh joined him there as Private Secretary and worked in that position through successive departments until the fall of David Lloyd George&#x27;s Coalition Government in 1922. When Churchill became Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1924, Marsh joined him there as Private Secretary and remained at the Treasury until the fall of Stanley Baldwin&#x27;s second government in 1929, when Marsh was returned to work at the Colonial Office. He then served as Private Secretary to every Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1929 until his retirement in 1937. Marsh was knighted upon his retirement and became Sir Edward Marsh.

==Literary career==
A classical scholar and translator, Marsh edited five anthologies of &quot;Georgian Poetry&quot; between 1912 and 1922, and he became Rupert Brooke&#x27;s literary executor, editing his &quot;Collected Poems&quot; in 1918. Later in life he published verse translations of La Fontaine and Horace, and a translation of Eugène Fromentin&#x27;s novel &quot;Dominique&quot;.

The sales of the first three &quot;Georgian Poetry&quot; anthologies were impressive, ranging between 15,000 and 19,000 copies apiece. Marsh and the critic J. C. Squire were the group&#x27;s most important patrons, and it was in Marsh&#x27;s London rooms that Siegfried Sassoon and Rupert Brooke met for the only time, in June 1914.
In 1931, he won a literary contest with a new stanza for &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, which repairs the omission of how &quot;Adam and Eve Brush Their Teeth&quot;. In 1939, he produced his memoirs, titled &quot;A Number of People.&quot; An edited collection of letters, &quot;Ambrosia and Small Beer,&quot; appeared in 1964, recording two decades of correspondence with his friend and biographer, Christopher Hassall.

Marsh advised Somerset Maugham about his writing between 1935 and 1953 with hundreds of pages of criticism. This is recorded in Ted Morgan&#x27;s biography of Maugham (1980).

Marsh was also a consistent collector and supporter of the works of the avant-garde artists Mark Gertler, Duncan Grant, David Bomberg and Paul Nash, all of whom were also associated with the Bloomsbury Group.

In addition to his work editing Churchill&#x27;s writing, Marsh introduced Siegfried Sassoon to Churchill as a means of aiding the former&#x27;s career. He was also a close friend and lover of Ivor Novello.

<text>Sir Edmund William Gosse (; 21 September 184916 May 1928) was an English poet, author and critic. He was strictly brought up in a small Protestant sect, the Plymouth Brethren, but broke away sharply from that faith. His account of his childhood in the book &quot;Father and Son&quot; has been described as the first psychological biography.

His friendship with the sculptor Hamo Thornycroft inspired a successful career as a historian of late-Victorian sculpture. His translations of Henrik Ibsen helped to promote that playwright in England, and he encouraged the careers of Sarojini Naidu, Toru Dutt, W. B. Yeats and James Joyce. He also lectured in English literature at Cambridge University.

==Early life==
Gosse was the son of Philip Henry Gosse and Emily Bowes. His father was a naturalist and his mother an illustrator who published a number of books of poetry. Both were deeply committed to a small Protestant sect, the Plymouth Brethren. His childhood was initially happy as they spent their summers in Devon, where his father was developing the ideas that gave rise to the craze for the marine aquarium. After his mother died of breast cancer when he was eight and they moved to Devon, his life with his father became increasingly strained by his father&#x27;s expectations that he should follow in his religious tradition. Gosse was sent to a boarding school where he began to develop his interests in literature. In 1860, his father remarried the deeply religious Quaker spinster Eliza Brightwen (1813–1900), whose brother Thomas tried to encourage Edmund to become a banker. He later gave an account of his childhood in the book &quot;Father and Son&quot;, which has been described as the first psychological biography. At the age of 18 and working in the British Museum in London, he broke away from his father&#x27;s influence in a dramatic coming of age. Nearly a century after Gosse&#x27;s death, a study based on his published remarks and writings about his father concluded that, in varying degrees, they are &quot;riddled with error, distortion, contradictions, unwarranted claims, misrepresentation, abuse of the written record, and unfamiliarity with the subject.&quot;

Eliza Gosse&#x27;s brother George Brightwen was the husband of Eliza Brightwen née Elder (1830–1906), a naturalist and author, whose first book was published in 1890. After Eliza Brightwen&#x27;s death, Edmund Gosse arranged for the publication of her two posthumous works, &quot;Last Hours with Nature&quot; (1908) and &quot;Eliza Brightwen, the Life and Thoughts of a Naturalist&quot; (1909), both edited by W. H. Chesson, and the latter book with an introduction and epilogue by Gosse.

Gosse was second cousin of Annie Morgan, also of strict Plymouth Brethren upbringing, who married physician Alexander Waugh (1840–1906) and was mother of Arthur Waugh and grandmother to the writers Alec Waugh and Evelyn Waugh.

==Career==

Gosse started his career as assistant librarian at the British Museum from 1867 alongside the songwriter Theo Marzials, a post which Charles Kingsley helped his father obtain for him. An early book of poetry published with a friend John Arthur Blaikie gave him an introduction to the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Trips to Denmark and Norway in 1872–74, where he visited Hans Christian Andersen and Frederik Paludan-Müller, led to publishing success with reviews of Henrik Ibsen and Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson in the &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot;.
He was soon reviewing Scandinavian literature in a variety of publications. He became acquainted with Alfred, Lord Tennyson and friends with Robert Browning, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Thomas Hardy and Henry James.

In the meantime, he published his first solo volume of poetry, &quot;On Viol and Flute&quot; (1873) and a work of criticism, &quot;Studies in the Literature of Northern Europe&quot; (1879). Gosse and Robert Louis Stevenson first met while teenagers, and after 1879, when Stevenson came to London on occasion, he would stay with Gosse and his family. In 1875 Gosse became a translator at the Board of Trade, a post which he held until 1904 and gave him time for his writing and enabled him to marry and start a family.

From 1884 to 1890, Gosse lectured in English literature at Trinity College, Cambridge, despite his lack of academic qualifications. Cambridge University gave him an honorary MA in 1886, and Trinity College formally admitted him as a member, &#x27;by order of the Council&#x27;, in 1889. He made a successful American lecture tour in 1884 and was much in demand as a speaker and on committees as well as publishing a string of critical works as well as poetry and histories.

He became, in the 1880s, one of the most important art critics dealing with sculpture (writing mainly for the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;) with an interest spurred on by his intimate friendship with the sculptor Hamo Thornycroft. Gosse would eventually write the first history of the renaissance of late-Victorian sculpture in 1894 in a four-part series for &quot;The Art Journal&quot;, dubbing the movement the New Sculpture. In 1902 he published an English translation of &quot;Alexandre Dumas fils&quot; &quot;Lady of the Camellias.&quot;

In 1904, he became the librarian of the House of Lords Library, where he exercised considerable influence till he retired in 1914. He wrote for the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, and was an expert on Thomas Gray, William Congreve, John Donne, Jeremy Taylor, and Coventry Patmore. He can also take credit for introducing Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s work to the British public. Gosse and William Archer collaborated in translating &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; and &quot;The Master Builder&quot;; those two translations were performed throughout the 20th century. Gosse and Archer, along with George Bernard Shaw, were perhaps the literary critics most responsible for popularising Ibsen&#x27;s plays among English-speaking audiences.
Gosse was instrumental in getting official financial support for two struggling Irish writers, W.B. Yeats in 1910 and James Joyce in 1915. This enabled both writers to continue their chosen careers.

His most famous book is the autobiographical &quot;Father and Son&quot;, about his troubled relationship with his Plymouth Brethren father, Philip, which was dramatised for television by Dennis Potter. Published anonymously in 1907, this followed a biography he had written of his father as naturalist, when he was urged by George Moore among others to write more about his past. Historians caution, though, that notwithstanding its psychological insight and literary excellence, Gosse&#x27;s narrative is often at odds with the verifiable facts of his own and his parents&#x27; lives. In later life, he became a formative influence on Siegfried Sassoon, the nephew of his lifelong friend, Hamo Thornycroft. Sassoon&#x27;s mother was a friend of Gosse&#x27;s wife, Ellen. Gosse was also closely tied to figures such as Algernon Charles Swinburne, John Addington Symonds, and André Gide.

His book &quot;The Autumn Garden&quot;, which was published in 1908 by the London publisher William Heinemann, includes over 50 individual poems and essays.

Gosse was the literary editor for the 1911 edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gosse married Ellen Epps (23 March 1850 – 29 August 1929), a young painter in the Pre-Raphaelite circle, who was the daughter of George Napoleon Epps. Though she was initially determined to pursue her art, she succumbed to his determined courting and they married in August 1875, with a reception at the house of Lawrence Alma-Tadema (her brother-in-law) and visiting Gosse&#x27;s father and step-mother (who did not attend the registry office wedding) at the end of their honeymoon in Devon and Cornwall. She continued to paint and wrote stories and reviews for various publications. In 1907, she inherited a sizeable fortune from her uncle, James Epps (the brother of John Epps and who had made his fortune in cocoa).

They were married more than 53 years and they had three children: Emily Teresa (&quot;Tessa&quot;) (1877-1951), Philip Henry George (1879–1959) who became a physician (but is probably best known as the author of &quot;The Pirates&#x27; Who&#x27;s Who&quot; (1924)) and Laura Sylvia (1881-1968), who became a well-known painter.

Despite a reportedly happy marriage Gosse had consistent, if deeply closeted, homosexual desires. Although initially reluctant to acknowledge these desires, in 1890 Gosse did acknowledge to John Addington Symonds, around the time the latter was working on &quot;A Problem in Modern Ethics&quot;, that indeed he (Gosse) was attracted to men, thus confirming suspicions Symonds had voiced earlier. &quot;Either way, I entirely deeply sympathize with you. Years ago I wanted to write to you about all this,&quot; Gosse wrote to Symonds, &quot;and withdrew through cowardice. I have had a very fortunate life, but there has been this obstinate twist in it! I have reached a quieter time—some beginnings of that Sophoclean period when the wild beast dies. He is not dead, but tamer; I understand him &amp; the trick of his claws.&quot;

==Honours==
Gosse was named a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1912. He was knighted in 1925.

<doc id="142748" wikidata="Q212892" url="?curid=142748" title="Membranophone">
<text>A membranophone is any musical instrument which produces sound primarily by way of a vibrating stretched membrane. It is one of the four main divisions of instruments in the original Hornbostel-Sachs scheme of musical instrument classification.

According to Sachs,
==Hornbostel-Sachs==
The Hornbostel-Sachs scheme of musical instrument classification divides membranophones in a numeric taxonomy based on how the sound is produced:

*21: by hitting the drumskin with a hand or object (most common form, including the timpani and snare drum)
*22: by pulling a knotted string attached to the drumskin (common in Indian drums, and can be considered an example of a chordophone as well)
*23: by rubbing the drumskin with a hand or object (common in Irish traditional music, an example is the bodhran)
*24: by modifying sounds through a vibrating membrane (unusual form, including the kazoo) 

==Length and breadth==
Membranophones can also be divided into small divisions based on length and breadth of sound production:

*Tubular drums include a wide range of drum shapes all conforming to a &quot;tube&quot; shape, or generally, having a depth greater than the radius of the membrane. The Hornbostel-Sachs Classification defines 8 subcategories of tubular drums: &quot;Cylindrical&quot;, &quot;Barrel-Shaped&quot;, &quot;Double-Conical&quot;, &quot;Hourglass-Shaped&quot;, &quot;Conical&quot;, &quot;Goblet-Shaped&quot;, &quot;Cylindro-Conical&quot;, and &quot;Vase-Shaped&quot; drums.
*Mirlitons, Kazoos and Swazzles vibrate in sympathy with sounds travelling across a membrane. These are the only membranophones that are not truly drums.

SIL International maintains a classification system based largely on shape:

*Cylindrical drums are straight-sided, and generally two-headed. A buzzing, percussive string is sometimes used. Examples include the bass drum and the Iranian &quot;dohol&quot;.
*Conical drums are sloped on the sides, and are usually one-headed. Examples include the Indian &quot;tabla&quot; and the Venezuelan &quot;chimbangueles&quot;.

*Barrel drums are normally one-headed, and may be open at the bottom. They bulge in the middle. Examples include the &quot;Dhak&quot; from eastern parts of India, &quot;bendre&quot;, made by the Mossi of Burkina Faso out of a large calabash, and the &quot;trong chau&quot; of Vietnam.
*Hourglass drums (or waisted drums) are hourglass-shaped and generally two-headed. The drumheads are laced onto the body, and the laces may be squeezed during performance to alter the drum&#x27;s pitch. Examples include folk drums in India (like the &quot;damaru&quot;) and much of Africa, as well as some talking drums.
*Goblet drums (or chalice drums) are one-headed and goblet shaped, and are usually open at the bottom. Examples include the Egyptian darbuka, West-African &quot;djembe&quot;, and the Arab &quot;darabukka&quot;.
*Footed drums are single-headed and are held above the ground by feet. The space between the drum and the ground provides extra resonance. Examples include a range of East African and Polynesian drums.
*Long drums are a diverse category, characterized by extreme length. Examples include the single-headed hollow tree trunk drums of Africa and the ornately carved and dyed &quot;gufalo&quot; of the Nuna in Burkina Faso.
*Kettle drums (or pot drums or vessel drums) are frequently played in pairs, and have a vessel or pot body, are one-headed and usually tuned to a specific note. Examples include the timpani and the Indian tabla.
*Frame drums are composed of one or more membranes stretched across a frame. Examples include the tambourine and bodhran.
*Friction drums produce sound through friction, such as by rubbing a hand or object against the drumskin. Examples include the Brazilian &quot;cuica&quot; and the Spanish &quot;zambomba&quot;.
*Mirlitons, Kazoos and Swazzles produce sound by blowing air across a membrane.

==Traditional classifications==

The traditional classification of Indian instruments include two categories of percussion.

*&quot;Ghan&quot;: Percussion without membranes, such as chimes, bells and gongs
*&quot;Avanaddh&quot;: Percussion with membranes, such as drums with skin heads

==Other categories==

The predrum category consists of simple drum-like percussion instruments. These include the &quot;ground drum&quot;, which, in its most common §—Form, consists of an animal skin stretched over a hole in the ground, and the &quot;pot drum&quot;, made from a simple pot.

&quot;Water drums&quot; are also sometimes treated as a distinct category of membranophone. Common in Native American music and the music of Africa, water drums are characterized by a unique sound caused by filling the drum with some amount of water.

The &quot;talking drum&quot; is an important category of West African membranophone, characterized by the use of varying tones to &quot;talk&quot;. Talking drums are used to communicate across distances.

Military drums or &quot;war drums&quot; are drums in various forms that have been used in the military.

<text>Pedro Juan Rosselló González (; born April 5, 1944) is a Puerto Rican physician and politician who served as the governor of Puerto Rico from 1993 to 2001. He was President of the New Progressive Party from 1991 to 1999 and 2003 to 2008, and served as Senator for the District of Arecibo from 2005 to 2008. His son, Ricardo, was also Governor of Puerto Rico from 2017 to 2019.

In 1988 Rosselló ran for Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, but lost to Jaime Fuster in the 1988 elections. From 1990 to 1991 he successfully challenged former Governor and then-NPP President Carlos Romero Barceló for the NPP&#x27;s presidency. He was thereafter elected Governor of Puerto Rico in 1992 and in 1996 was re-elected by the widest electoral margin up to that date. He also served as President of the Council of State Governments as well as Chairman of the Southern Governors&#x27; Association, and Democratic Governors Association. He retired from active politics in 2001.

In 2003 Rosselló made a comeback, winning the NPP&#x27;s 2004 gubernatorial nomination in primaries against then-NPP President Carlos Pesquera. He then lost the 2004 gubernatorial race to Anibal Acevedo Vilá by an unprecedented and a vigorously disputed razor-thin margin. Soon after an elected NPP Senator from Arecibo resigned his seat and Rosselló filled the vacancy. From 2005 to 2006 Rosselló unsuccessfully sought to remove Senate President Kenneth McClintock from that position and replace him. In 2008 Rosselló lost the NPP&#x27;s 2008 gubernatorial nomination to then-Resident Commissioner and future Governor Luis Fortuño. Thereafter he completed his term as Senator and retired from electoral politics.

As of 2025, Rossello is the most recent Governor of Puerto Rico to serve more than one term.

==Early life and education==
Rosselló González was born in San Juan on April 5, 1944, to Juan Antonio Rosselló Matanzo (1913–2001) and Iris M. González Paz (1919–2012). Rosselló&#x27;s paternal grandfather Pedro Juan Rosselló Batle migrated in 1902 at the age of 23 from Lloseta, Mallorca, in the Balearic Islands, Spain; his brother Juan had also left for Puerto Rico a year earlier.

After completing his elementary and secondary education at Academia Santa Teresita and Academia del Perpetuo Socorro, both located in San Juan, Rosselló moved to the mainland United States to attend college. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree, magna cum laude at the University of Notre Dame in 1966, as well as several academic and athletic distinctions. After graduation, he continued his studies in medicine at Yale University, which he completed in 1970, also graduating Magna Cum Laude. Later he specialized in general and pediatric surgery at Harvard University. Following his residency at Harvard, he practiced medicine in Puerto Rico while also attending the University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus where he earned a master&#x27;s degree in Public Health (MPH) in 1981 (also graduating Magna Cum Laude). In 2011, he began studying toward a Doctor of Education in Education Leadership from the University of Turabo, graduating in 2015. During his college years, Rosselló became an avid tennis player that led him to be named the captain of Notre Dame&#x27;s Men&#x27;s tennis team, a P.R. 5-time-Mens-Champion, and also to play for Puerto Rico&#x27;s team in regional championships, including the Central American and Caribbean Games. He was inducted into the Puerto Rico Tennis Hall of Fame in 2004.

== Early career ==
Rosselló started his professional career alternating as an instructor at Harvard Medical School and as an assistant professor at the University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus, where he would later become an associate professor.

He became chief of pediatric surgery and later chief surgeon at the University of Puerto Rico Children&#x27;s Hospital. In 1985, Rosselló was named Health Services Director for the city of San Juan by then Mayor Baltasar Corrada del Río.

==Political career==

===Run for resident commissioner===
Rosselló began his political career in 1988 when he ran for the office of Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, (the island&#x27;s non-voting observer/representative in the United States Congress) losing to incumbent Jaime Fuster of the Popular Democratic Party (PPD). Nevertheless, he was the candidate from the New Progressive Party (PNP) for whom the most votes were cast in the 1988 elections. This positioned him well to become the party&#x27;s next leader.

After leading a &quot;Statehood Crusade&quot; throughout the islands of Puerto Rico, in 1991 he became president of the PNP, successfully leading an opposition to a referendum sponsored by the then Puerto Rico&#x27;s Governor Rafael Hernández Colón. In 1992 he successfully ran for Governor of Puerto Rico, defeating Victoria Muñoz Mendoza of the PPD.

===Governor (1993–2001)===
As governor, Rosselló launched an anti-crime campaign known as &quot;Mano Dura Contra el Crimen&quot; (&quot;literally, &quot;Strong hand against crime&quot;&quot;) in which the Puerto Rico National Guard was used to assist state police in deterring the ever-increasing crime wave that had begun in the late 1980s. This crime-fighting initiative supposedly managed to reduce violent crimes in half by the time he left office in Jan. 2001, but the figures are disputed due to poor recordkeeping and extensive juking of crime statistics by Puerto Rican police. The U.S. Department of Justice would document these problems with Puerto Rico&#x27;s police force in a 2011 report. There were also widespread incidents of police brutality, as Rosselló and Police Superintendent Pedro Toledo aggressively deployed riot police against political protests. These protests arose over litany of controversies that marred Rosselló&#x27;s government, including the privatization of the island&#x27;s utilities, massive cost overruns and contract disputes on development projects, and several corruption scandals involving top cabinet officials. After Rosselló left office, crime rates either returned to pre-Mano Dura levels or successive governments simply reported more accurate crime statistics. Violent crime declined by a similar extent across the US during that period, but Puerto Rico&#x27;s crime rate blew past pre-Rosselló levels throughout the 2000s and 2010s. He also worked to eradicate drug traffic in Puerto Rico Publics School on his campaign &quot;Zona Libre de Drogas&quot; (Drug-Free Zone). The Rosselló government was never able to address the extensive penetration by narcotraffickers of the police and local government, and by 2010 Puerto Rico had one of the highest gun homicide rates in the world, a figure largely driven by drug crime. His administration was also characterized for investing in large-scale, controversial infrastructure projects which included a train system, dubbed Tren Urbano, and a new convention center in San Juan, now officially named the Pedro Rosselló Convention Center. His policies also included a push towards reducing the size of government and taking government out of areas in which it should not act as a direct competitor of the private sector. His administration reduced the unemployment to less than 11% in 2000 creating thousands of jobs during his 8 years of government. Most of these government and private sector jobs disappeared in the 2000s as the island&#x27;s debt problem, largely unaddressed during Rosselló&#x27;s administration, spiraled out of control and forced later governments to purge civil service rolls and resort to regressive tax measures to raise revenue. Some other large-scale infrastructure projects were the Coliseum of Puerto Rico, the Museum of Art of Puerto Rico, Highway 66, and the SuperAcueducto.

Under his administration, a healthcare reform bill was approved. Rosselló&#x27;s Health Reform made Puerto Rico one of the few jurisdictions in the entire world to have had virtually 100% of its population covered by health insurance. Additionally, under this Reform, Puerto Rico became the only jurisdiction in the US to have nearly 100% of its infants under the age of 2 vaccinated. He led two campaigns for Puerto Rican statehood in 1993 and 1998 in which locally enacted plebiscites were held to consult the Puerto Rican electorate on the political status with the United States. He supported the congressional Young Bill, which sought to carry out a referendum in Puerto Rico to define the political status of the island. However, the bill died in committee in the Senate of the United States. Nevertheless, Rosselló carried out a non-binding plebiscite in 1998 which gave electors four options and a fifth &quot;None of the Above&quot; column. The opposing Popular Democratic Party led a campaign to boycott the plebiscite and called the electorate to vote for the &quot;None of the Above&quot; column. The boycott was successful, as the &quot;None of the Above&quot; column – which did not represent any kind support for any status option – garnered 50.3% of the total votes.

In the 1996 elections he defeated rivals Héctor Luis Acevedo (PPD) who was mayor of San Juan at the time, and Representative David Noriega (PIP), winning a second term after obtaining more than one million votes and the largest victory margin since 1964.

In 1998, a 45% stake of the state-owned Puerto Rico Telephone Company (PRTC) was sold to a consortium led by GTE (now Verizon) and Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, with another stake set aside to benefit all of the company&#x27;s employees. This sale led to a general strike organized by several labor unions. A similar attempt to privatize PRTC in 1988, under then Governor Rafael Hernández Colón, led to a similar strike which doomed the sale. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 deregulated the monopolies many regional telephone and cable television companies held. From then on, PRTC&#x27;s telecommunications monopoly would no longer be able to properly compete in the environment and the losses to the government would have been onerous. The sale price was 2 billion dollars, which union leaders described as &quot;ridiculously low&quot; (PRTC generated about a 100 million dollars of yearly profit at the time of the sale). The privatization of PRTC led to the 1998 Puerto Rican general strike.

Rosello&#x27;s last term as governor (1998–2001) was plagued with numerous political scandals, many of them related to the use of public funds for personal gain by government officials as well as by members of Rosello&#x27;s PNP political party. Among the charges was the use of government funds that had been allocated for treating Puerto Ricans suffering from AIDS which were instead used to finance Rosello&#x27;s political campaign. Some funds intended for public education were also diverted for personal or party gain. After a new governor took over in 2001 (Sila María Calderón Serra) more evidence of Rosello-era scandals was still coming to light.

===Vieques controversy===
In April 1999, a U.S. Navy bomber misfired its missiles at a practice range and struck the main watch-post on the island of Vieques, killing David Sanes, a civilian employee of the Navy. The protests that followed on the small island gathered international attention (see Navy-Vieques protests). Governor Rosselló supported the immediate exit of the Navy, appearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee pressing the Senators, among them John Warner and James Inhofe, to immediately take action so that the Navy could withdraw its troops from the island. In 2000, Rosselló and then President Bill Clinton signed an agreement that the Navy would withdraw from Vieques by the year 2003, if voters in Vieques ratified the agreement in a referendum. The agreement included $40 million in public works in Vieques. After Clinton and Rosselló left office, the administration of the next Governor of Puerto Rico, Sila Calderón, rescinded this agreement. Despite political grandstanding from the Calderón administration calling of an earlier withdrawal, the Navy left Vieques on May 1, 2003, the same date President Clinton and Governor Rosselló had agreed upon.

After finishing his term, amid controversy over the growing number of corruption cases involving members of his party and administration, Rosselló moved to the Boston area where he taught on the faculty of the Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University. He later moved to Virginia, where he first served as a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and later taught public health at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.

In 2003, Rosselló returned to politics and won his party&#x27;s nomination for the gubernatorial candidacy in a primary election against his successor as PNP leader, Carlos Pesquera. In the 2004 Puerto Rico Elections the PNP won majorities in both houses of the Legislature, the mayorships of 42 of the island&#x27;s 78 municipalities and the Resident Commissioner post in the U.S. Congress. However, the position of governor was given then to incumbent Resident Commissioner Aníbal Acevedo Vilá who won by razor-thin margin in a highly controversial PR Supreme Court decision that many still hold was politically motivated.

===Senator (2005–09)===
Prior to assuming office as Senator, Rosselló had announced his intention to remove Senate President Kenneth McClintock and be elected to replace him. An internal power struggle within the New Progressive Party between Rosselló and McClintock led to a split within the NPP Senate delegation in May 2005. After a caucus meeting, eleven of the seventeen senators elected by the New Progressive Party voted for Rosselló, with the other six boycotting the meeting. McClintock and five other senators, Orlando Parga, Luz Arce, Migdalia Padilla, Carlos Díaz, and Jorge de Castro Font, refused to follow the caucus&#x27; decision, denying the unanimous consent required by Senate Rules 2 and 6 to remove a president, thus permitting McClintock to remain as Senate president. The party directorate subsequently recommended that McClintock, Parga, and de Castro Font be expelled from the Party, and that Arce, Padilla, and Díaz be censured and prohibited to run for re-election under the party&#x27;s flag or logo. However, in August 2005 the party&#x27;s General Assembly only took action to expel de Castro Font, leaving the status of McClintock and the other four senators in limbo after approving in August 2006 a generic censure resolution that did not name any officeholders by name. The sanctions were nullified by San Juan Superior Court Judge Oscar Dávila Suliveres on May 8, 2007. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, in a 5-to-1 decision, affirmed the lower court decision. Three of the disciplined senators (De Castro, Arce, Padilla) who ran for renomination, except for Díaz Olivo, were renominated in the March 2008 primary and were re-elected in the general elections.

Rosselló was able to gain a seat in the Senate of Puerto Rico when Victor Loubriel, an elected first-time district senator representing Arecibo, decided to resign his seat two days after being sworn in. The senator&#x27;s resignation gave the New Progressive Party a seat it could fill, so Rosselló announced his intentions of filling the vacancy and was selected to the post through an internal party procedure. Rosselló officially assumed duties as a Senator of Puerto Rico on February 13, 2005.

On January 16, 2007, Rosselló led the party caucus in the Senate to a reprimand of two more NPP senators, fellow Arecibo senator José Emilio González and Bayamón senator Carmelo Ríos for voting in favor of a concurrent resolution proposing a constitutional amendment that would turn Puerto Rico&#x27;s bicameral legislature into a unicameral legislative system, increasing the number of reprimanded caucus members to eight of the total of sixteen elected in 2004. Both González and Rios expressed their lack of concern over the reprimand and were handily renominated in the March 2008 primary and reelected in the November 2008 general election.

====March against U.S. colonialism in Puerto Rico====
On February 21, 2006, Pedro Rosselló set out to denounce &quot;U.S. persistent colonialism in Puerto Rico&quot; by organizing a march for the end of US colonialism in Puerto Rico (&quot;La Marcha por el Fin de la Colonia&quot;). The stated purpose of the march was to expose the colonial status of Puerto Rico, and exhort the United States Congress to pass a bill that would allow the self-determination of the people of Puerto Rico, with congressionally mandated non-territorial, non-colonial options. Rosselló is a vocal and prominent supporter of statehood for the island, wanting Puerto Rico to become the 51st state of the (United States). The march covered the complete perimeter of Puerto Rico, tracing its coastline for 16 days and 271.3 miles. The United States Congress has not acted on any requests from the march&#x27;s organizers.

====NPP presidency====

On June 7, 2007, Senator Rosselló officially ended his bid for the Senate presidency, stating in an article in El Vocero newspaper that he was no longer interested in the post, held since 2005 by fellow party member Kenneth McClintock. On April 19, 2007, he published a third book, &quot;El Triunvirato del Terror&quot;, (&quot;The Triumvirate of Terror&quot;) on the power centers that he believes control Puerto Rico&#x27;s economy and government.

On April 28, 2007, Rosselló revealed to various party leaders that in March, 2006, he had signed a sworn statement assuring that he would not make a fourth run for the governorship in 2008, and that he intended to abide by the result. During the April 25, 2007, U.S. House Subcommittee on Insular Affairs hearing on Puerto Rico&#x27;s political status, he was seen treating McClintock very cordially, which suggests that the tension levels between them had eased somewhat, suggesting he may have wanted to help reunite the party as it prepares for the 2008 electoral campaign against incumbent Governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá and assume a different non-elective role within the statehood movement to which he has devoted nearly two decades of his life.

====2008 NPP governor&#x27;s candidacy primary====

During a PNP assembly on May 22, 2007, a large group of delegates unanimously acclaimed him as the party&#x27;s candidate for governor. However, given his original intention NOT to run, he officially announced that he would allow his name to be placed on the ballot, but he would not carry out a campaign for reelection. His candidacy papers were filed at the State Elections Commission on June 1, 2007. His candidacy was contested by Luis Fortuño, the current Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, with whom he had shared the ballot in 2004. Fortuño had also announced officially his pre-candidacy for the party&#x27;s nomination for governor.

On March 9, 2008, Rosselló conceded the victory to Luis Fortuño after a large margin of votes in favor of his opponent at the primaries.

==Personal life==
Rosselló married Irma Margarita &quot;Maga&quot; Neváres on August 9, 1969. They have three sons: Juan Oscar (b. 1971), Luis Roberto (b. 1973), and Ricardo Antonio (b. 1979), and several grandchildren. His youngest son, Ricardo became the 12th Governor of Puerto Rico.

One of Rossello&#x27;s nephews, Roy Rossello, was a member of boy band Menudo.

<text>G scale or G gauge, also called large scale (), is a track gauge for model railways which is often used for outdoor garden railways because of its size and durability. G scale trains use a fixed track gauge of to accommodate a range of rail transport modelling scales between narrow gauge (~1:13‒1:19‒1:20), metre gauge (1:22.5), Playmobil trains (~1:24), and standard gauge (~1:29–1:32).

G-scale LGB (, &quot;Lehmann&#x27;s Big Train&quot;) was introduced in 1968 by Ernst Paul Lehmann Patentwerk in Germany. LGB products were intended for indoor and outdoor use; so the &quot;G&quot; became interpreted as &quot;garden scale&quot;. 

Most track is made of brass which can remain outside in all weather. Track can also be obtained in less expensive aluminium as well as oxidation-resistant, though more expensive, stainless steel.

Like other scales, large scale is sometimes used for model trains that run indoors on a track mounted against the wall near the ceiling.

==G scale versus G gauge==

G gauge track has a spacing of 45 mm between the railheads (tracks) (c.f. 44.45 mm for 1 gauge , but that does not determine the scale to which the models are built because, to maintain a constant track width when real-life counterparts have a variety of railroad gauges, the scale has to vary. The most common full-scale practice uses a spacing of , whereas some narrow-gauge railways (serving mines, etc.) have rails only apart. Although often built with standard-sized doors, a narrow-gauge train is in most other respects smaller than its standard-gauge counterpart: its cars are generally narrower and shorter, allowing them to navigate more sharply curved and lightly built tracks.

Model trains are built to represent a real train of standard or narrow gauge. For example, HO scale (1:87 or 3.5 mm to 1 foot) (and also, although inaccurately, double-O/OO at 4 mm to 1 foot) models all use 16.5 mm gauge track to represent standard gauge trains while a narrower-gauge track such as 9 mm N gauge is used to represent real narrow gauge. 

G model railways depart from this and always use the same gauge with the trains instead built in different sizes depending on whether they are intended to represent standard-gauge or narrow-gauge trains. Because of this it might be more correct to speak of &quot;G gauge&quot; rather than &quot;G scale&quot; since the consistent aspect is the gauge, , but the term &quot;G scale&quot; (or &quot;scale IIm&quot;) is used when 1:22.5 is used.

The 45 mm gauge originated from 1 gauge or &quot;gauge one&quot; which was first used in Europe and Britain and used to model standard gauge trains in the scale of 1:32.

LGB were first to adopt the term &quot;G scale&quot; and used the gauge of to model 1,000 mm gauge European trains in 1:22.5 scale. 

=== Scales that run on G gauge track ===
* Gauge one: 1:32 ( inch to the foot). Used to model standard gauge trains of gauge.
* 1:29 scale or A scale: 1:29. First used by Aristo-Craft to model standard-gauge prototypes. Incorrect scale/gauge but proportionally similar to other popular brands of the time.
* G scale: 1:22.5. Used to model European trains that run on metre gauge track. This scale-gauge combination is called &quot;scale IIm&quot; according to NEM 010. The &quot;G&quot; comes from the German word meaning &quot;big&quot;.
* H scale (half inch) -inch-to-the-foot, or 1:24 scale. Used to model gauge or &quot;Cape gauge&quot;. Incorrect scale used for 3 ft (914 mm) gauge track.
* F scale (fifteen) 15 mm-to-the-foot scale, (1:20.32). Correct scale/gauge typically used to model North American narrow gauge trains on gauge track.
* Seven eighths: -inch-to-the-foot scale (1:13.7). Used to model trains on narrow gauge track.
* 16 mm scale: 16 mm-to-the-foot (1:19.05). Originally intended for modelling 2-ft gauge prototype railways on 32 mm track (SM32). The models are often re-gauged to also run on 45 mm track. This scale has also been used to model gauge prototype trains.

==Manufacturers==
* Accucraft has five scales: Fn3 at 1:20.3, gauge 1 at 1:32, -inch scale at 1:24. They also build 1:29-scale North American models in live steam and electric under the AML brand, as well as British live steam and electric models in 1:19 scale (also called 16 mm) and Isle of Man live steam and electric models in 1:20.3 scale. The Isle of Man scale uses three-foot gauge track, the same width as the dominant U.S. Colorado narrow gauge.
* American Model Builders: 1:24
* Aristo-Craft (REA), which closed in 2013, made two scales: 1:29 and the &quot;Classic&quot; series (generally 1:24 but some models were closer to 1:32 scale).
* Aster (C&amp;S Mogul): 1:32, 1:30 for Japanese prototypes and 1:22.5 for European and Japanese narrow gauge.
* Bachmann&#x27;s &quot;Big Haulers&quot; series: 1:22.5, while their &quot;Spectrum&quot; series is to 1:20.3 scale and their train streetcars: 1:29
* Buddy &quot;L&quot; (Keystone) (modern): 1:22.5 scale (almost identical to Bachmann, except cab is taller), older (legacy) equipment runs on rails spaced inches from the pre WWII era.
* Chicago Train Works: 1:32
* Chucks Custom Cars: 1:22.5
* D.A.N.: 1:22.5
* Delton/Caledonia Express: 1:24 (operated from 1983 to 1990 as Delton; until 1993 as Caledonia)
* Eastern Railways: 1:32
* GHB: 1:32
* Great Trains/American Standard: 1:32
* Hartford Products: 1:24 (except SP boxcar and stock car, which are 1:22.5)
* Hartland Locomotive Works products: 1:29 standard-gauge equipment, 1:24 scale narrow-gauge equipment.
* Kalamazoo Toy Train Works: 1:24 (operated from 1980 to the mid-1990s)
* Keystone: 1:22.5
* LGB (sold to Märklin in 2007): 1:22.5
* Lionel: Ready To Play 1:24 (Ready to Run is the same scale but NOT G gauge compatible as it uses 2&quot; wide track)
* Little Railways: 1:20
* Mainline America: 1:32
* Märklin &quot;Maxi&quot;: 1:32
* Model Die Casting: 1:32, except caboose, which is 1:24
* MTH Rail-King: 1:32
* Northern Fine Scale Stock: 10 mm scale. (British-only freight stock in kit form)
* Precision scale: 1:32 standard-gauge, 1:24 narrow gauge
* PIKO: 1:29 (American cars); 1:22.5 (wood-sided passenger cars)
* Roberts Lines (Zephyr): 1:32
* USA Trains: 1:29 (&quot;Ultimate&quot; series); 1:24 (&quot;American&quot; series)
* Wrightway Rolling Stock: 1:32 and 10 mm scale custom-built British North American and European passenger stock.

<text>An aerophone is a musical instrument that produces sound primarily by causing a body of air to vibrate, without the use of strings or membranes (which are respectively chordophones and membranophones), and without the vibration of the instrument itself adding considerably to the sound (or idiophones).

According to Curt Sachs:

These may be lips, a mechanical reed, or a sharp edge. Also, an aerophone may be excited by percussive acts, such as the slapping of the keys of a flute or of any other woodwind. A free aerophone lacks the enclosed column of air yet, &quot;cause a series of condensations and rarefications by various means.&quot;

==Overview==
Aerophones are one of the four main classes of instruments in the original Hornbostel–Sachs system of musical instrument classification, which further classifies aerophones by whether or not the vibrating air is contained within the instrument. The first class (41) includes instruments which, when played, do &quot;not&quot; contain the vibrating air. The bullroarer is one example. These are called &quot;free aerophones&quot;. This class includes (412.13) free reed instruments, such as the harmonica, but also many instruments unlikely to be called wind instruments at all by most people, such as sirens and whips. The second class (42) includes instruments that contain the vibrating air when being played. This class includes almost all instruments generally called wind instruments — including the didgeridoo, (423) brass instruments (e.g., trumpet, french horn, baritone horn, tuba, trombone), and (421 &amp; 422) woodwind instruments (e.g., oboe, flute, saxophone, clarinet). The wind factor is not only provided by the players&#x27; lungs function. The organ and the mouth harmonica are also aerophones, both supplied with free reeds, which are blown by a mechanical system.

Additionally, very loud and impulsive sounds can be made by explosions directed into, or being detonated inside of resonant cavities. Detonations inside the calliope (and steam whistle), as well as the pyrophone, might thus be considered as class 42 instruments, despite the fact that the &quot;wind&quot; or &quot;air&quot; may be steam or an air-fuel mixture.

Other cases of aerophones with impulsive sounds are the boomwhackers and the so-called thongophones, made up of cylindrical pipes that are struck on the sides (boomwhackers) or extremes (thongophones), thus generating percussive aerophonic tones.

==History==

According to Ardal Powell, the flute is a simple instrument found in numerous ancient cultures. There are three legendary and archeologically verifiable birthplace sites of flutes: Egypt, Greece and India. Of these, the transverse flute (side-blown) appeared only in ancient India, while the fipple flutes are found in all three. It is likely, states Powell, that the modern Indian &quot;bansuri&quot; has not changed much since the early medieval era.

Identifying the origin of the aerophone is difficult, though it is believed that Americans and their descendants developed the largest diversity of aerophones, and they are understood to have been the major non-vocal, melodic instruments of Native America. Archaeological studies have found examples of globular flutes in ancient Mexico, Colombia and Peru, and multiple tubular flutes were common among the Maya and Aztec. The use of shells of Conches as an aerophone has also been found to be prevalent in areas such as Central America and Peru.

Examples of aerophone-type instruments in China can be dated back to the Neolithic period. Fragments of bone flutes can be found at the burial sites of the Jiahu settlements of ancient China, and they represent some of the earliest known examples of playable instruments. The instruments were typically carved from the wing bone of the red-crowned crane, and had five to eight holes. The flutes were efficient enough to produce sound in a nearly accurate octave, and are thought to have been used ceremonially or for ritualistic purposes. Examples of flutes made out of bamboo in China date back to 2nd Century BC. These flutes were known as Dizi&#x27;s or simply &quot;Di&quot; () and typically had 6 holes for playing melodies that were framed by scale-modes.

Flutes including the famous Bansuri, have been an integral part of Indian classical music since 1500 BC. A major deity of Hinduism, Krishna, has been associated with the flute. Some early flutes were made out of tibias (shin bones). The flute has also always been an essential part of Indian culture and mythology, and the cross flute is believed, by several accounts, to originate in India as Indian literature from 1500 BCE has made vague references to the cross flute.

==Types==
===Free===
Free aerophones are instruments where the vibrating air is not enclosed by the instrument itself.

====Displacement====
The air-stream meets a sharp edge, or a sharp edge is moved through the air.

====Interruptive====
The air-stream is interrupted periodically.

====Plosive====
Also known as percussive aerophones, plosive aerophones are percussion instruments sounded by a single compression and release of air. An example of a plosive aerophone is the scraper flute which has tubes with ridged or serrated edges so that they can be scraped with a rod to produce sound.

Another example of a percussive aerophone is the so-called thongophone, consisting of a cylindrical pipe that is struck by a special mallet, somehow equivalent to a flip-flop (thong). A thongophone may sound like an open-open pipe if the mallet is quickly removed after striking the pipe&#x27;s extreme. Also, it may sound as an open-closed pipe, if the mallet remains closing the pipe after the attack. In the first situation (open-open), the first resonance mode will have a wavelength that corresponds to two times the pipe length, approximately. It is called by acousticians as a &quot;half-wavelength&quot; air column. In the second situation (open-closed), the first resonance mode will have a wavelength that corresponds to four times the pipe length, approximately. Acousticians call it as &quot;quarter-wavelength&quot; air-column.

===Non-free===

Non-free aerophones are instruments where the vibrating air is contained within the instrument. Often called wind instruments, they are typically divided into two categories; Woodwind and Brass. It is widely accepted that wind instruments are not classified on the material from which they are made, as a woodwind instrument does not necessarily need to be made of wood, nor a brass instrument made of brass. Woodwind instruments are often made with wood, metal, glass or ivory, with examples being flute, oboe, bassoon, clarinet, recorder and the saxophone. Brass instruments are often made with silver, copper, ivory, horn, or even wood. Examples include the trumpet, cornet, horn, trombone and the tuba.

====Flute====

A flute is a type of aerophone, as is the Eunuch flute, also referred to as a mirliton. A flute is an aerophone or reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from the flow of air across an opening, usually a sharp edge. According to the instrument classification of Hornbostel–Sachs, flutes are categorized as edge-blown aerophones. Aside from the voice, flutes are the earliest known musical instruments. A number of flutes dating to about 43,000 to 35,000 years ago have been found in the Swabian Alb region of Germany. These flutes demonstrate that a developed musical tradition existed from the earliest period of modern human presence in Europe.

====Reed====

A reed aerophone is a musical instrument that produces sound by the player&#x27;s breath being directed against a lamella or pair of lamellae which periodically interrupt the airflow and cause the air to be set in motion. Reed aerophones can be further subdivided into two distinct categories: single-reed and double-reed instruments. The former includes clarinets and saxophones, while examples of the latter are oboes and bassoons.

====Brass====

A brass aerophone is a musical instrument that produces sound by sympathetic vibration of air in a tubular resonator in sympathy with the vibration of the player&#x27;s lips. Brass instruments are also called &quot;labrosones&quot;, literally meaning &quot;lip-vibrated instruments&quot;. There are several factors involved in producing different pitches on a brass instrument. Slides, valves, crooks, or keys are used to change vibratory length of tubing, thus changing the available harmonic series, while the player&#x27;s embouchure, lip tension and air flow serve to select the specific harmonic produced from the available series. Unlike all other aerophones, brass instruments can be &quot;muted&quot;, in other words, their sounds can be somewhat suppressed as one would use a silencer on a firearm. A variety of mutes exist for these instruments, ranging from those made of plastic to others made of metal, and in various shapes.

<text>The Lehmann Gross Bahn (LGB; German for &quot;Lehmann Big Train&quot;), made by Ernst Paul Lehmann Patentwerk in Nuremberg, Germany, since 1968 and by Märklin since 2007, is the most popular garden railway model in Europe, although there are also many models of U.S. and Canadian prototypes. LGB caused a revival of garden model railroading in the United States when it was introduced. LGB is sold in North America through Wm. K. Walthers, who took over from Ernst Paul Lehmann&#x27;s subsidiary, LGB of America, when Märklin bought the LGB assets. Most of the European prototypes were manufactured in Germany, while much of the North American rolling stock was made in China. Production was later moved to Hungary.

LGB trains are responsible for introducing &quot;G&quot; scale to model railroading. The scale ratio used by LGB is nominally 1:22.5, yet many dimensions are often changed to allow operation on very tight R1 curves. American prototypes especially suffer from this. Other G-scale (and Gauge 1) manufacturers produce products that range from 1:20 to 1:32, and for the most part, all use the same track and are compatible with one another. Though they can all run on the same track (45 mm gauge), models representing narrow-gauge versions of trains or locomotives would not normally be run together with models of larger full-scale vehicles. To fit the same standard track the latter must be built using different scales; for example, 1:22.5 scale passengers and/or train crew are somewhat oversized when displayed in proximity with 1:32 models. Though the models may be physically compatible, many people choose a preferred style or era, and pick one ratio (in the range of 1:20.3 to 1:32) for all of their models.

The first loco made under the LGB brand was a model of a small Austrian 0-4-0 named &quot;Stainz&quot;, in the LGB logo. It continued in production in 2021, although with a sound system and other mechanical differences to the original 1968 model. Most garden railway enthusiasts have at least one example of a Stainz in their collection as it tends to be a robust loco with good pulling power.

==Bankruptcy and sale of Ernst Paul Lehmann Patentwerk==
With the model train industry in decline, &quot;Ernst Paul Lehmann Patentwerk&quot; started restructuring and cost-saving measures in 2002 and further intensified them in 2005. These measures included an employee-supported salary forfeiture and, in mid-2006, transferring Lehman&#x27;s North American distribution and service subsidiary, LGB of America (LGBoA), to a new United States-based firm, G45. However, on September 1, 2006, Lehmann&#x27;s financing banks, which had recently been sold to larger, international banks, froze Lehmann&#x27;s accounts and blocked sale of existing inventory. Lehmann called this a &quot;hostile takeover&quot; and requested bankruptcy protection on September 18, 2006.

Multiple entities, including model train manufacturers Märklin, Piko, and Hornby, bid on Lehmann. It was announced on December 22, 2006, that Hermann Schöntag, the then-owner of the German Rügen narrow-gauge railway, had been selected by Lehmann&#x27;s creditors to purchase the firm. He founded E.P. Lehmann GmbH &amp; Co. KG and preserved the factory, offices, and 150 jobs in Nuremberg. However, his co-investors backed out; production stopped on March 21, 2007, and the company filed for bankruptcy on April 23, 2007.

==Purchase of LGB by Märklin==
The second round of bidders included G45, new owner of LGB of America, and Märklin, another German model train manufacturer. Märklin had recently faced a situation similar to Lehmann&#x27;s; it had been family owned from its founding in 1859 until 2006, when its accumulating debts led to it being sold to Kingsbridge Capital and Goldman Sachs. On July 26, 2007, Märklin was selected to acquire Lehmann&#x27;s assets; the move was criticized because the Nuremberg location and jobs would not be preserved and because it was speculated that Goldman Sachs, also a Lehmann creditor, orchestrated the purchase.

Shipping and production resumed in fall 2007, with the LGB brand intact. Production moved to Győr, Hungary, and service ultimately moved to Göppingen. Märklin faced a trademark disagreement with LGB of America, which owned the LGB trademark in the United States. Without an agreement between the two, product could not be shipped to or distributed in the United States. An interim agreement concerning only already-manufactured product was signed on September 21, 2007, giving LGBoA exclusive distribution and service rights in North America.

On June 1, 2008, Silvergate Distributors, Inc. was formed as a new company by LGB of America president Anthony Castellano. Silvergate was an independent, American-owned, hobby distributor and was not a subsidiary or &quot;daughter firm&quot; of any other company. Though LGBoA was not dissolved, Silvergate assumed distribution of remaining LGB stock as well as current and new product lines. Silvergate also distributed the Schuco, Brawa, and Piko product lines. In November 2008, Märklin announced that it had resolved the American trademark dispute and planned to resume distribution of LGB products in the United States, with Walthers becoming the American distributor on January 1, 2009. LGB of America and Silvergate Distributors ultimately ceased operations.

On February 4, 2009, Märklin filed for bankruptcy protection in Göppingen. On February 5, 2010, Märklin announced a return to profitability and emerged from bankruptcy on February 17, 2011. On March 21, 2013, the Simba Dickie Group announced that it would purchase Märklin, securing Märklin and LGB&#x27;s future and giving Märklin&#x27;s employees job security until 2019.

==In popular culture==
* The Comedy Inc. sketch, &quot;Ernest the Engine and Others&quot;, uses LGB models, buildings, and track.
* In &quot;Stuart Little&quot; a Santa Fe EMD F7A and B makes a few cameos during the part where Stuart was on the tracks and he almost got hit until he stood up and it passes Stuart in the model railroad.
* In &quot;The Santa Clause&quot; there are multiple trains which make cameos. The first is in the opening with the song &quot;Carol of the Bells&quot; playing. The second is in the North Pole scene before Charlie and Scott arrive. The third is in the scene in the room in the North Pole where Charlie and Scott sleep.
* In &quot;Coming to America&quot; the LGB 2017D steam locomotive and the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad low sided red gondola is the beer train.

<text>HE0107-5240 is an extremely metal-poor Population II star, located roughly away from Earth. It is one of the most metal-poor stars known in our Galaxy, with a metallicity [Fe/H] = ; i.e. it has just of the metal that the Sun has. Because of its very low metallicity, it is believed to be one of the earliest Population II stars to have formed. If so, then it is also very old, with an age of roughly 13 billion years. Because the star is not completely metal-free, it does not belong to the first generation of stars (the hypothetical Population III). These stars converted the pristine hydrogen, helium, and lithium formed by the Big Bang into heavier elements, such as carbon, oxygen, and metals.

The star is relatively small for a star of the early universe, which accounts for its old age: massive stars die quickly. To help explain why this star is so small, it is hypothesized it was once part of a binary star system.
HE0107-5240 was found by Norbert Christlieb and colleagues at the University of Hamburg in Germany as a byproduct of the Hamburg/ESO Survey for faint quasars with the 1m ESO Schmidt telescope. Follow-up observations were made at the Siding Spring 2.3 m Telescope and high-resolution spectra were taken at the European Southern Observatory in Chile, using one of the units of the Very Large Telescope. In 2005, a second star with an even smaller iron abundance, HE 1327-2326 ([Fe/H]=-5.4), was found, also in the Hamburg/ESO survey. In 2014 an even more metal poor star was announced: SMSS J031300.36−670839.3.

<doc id="142758" wikidata="Q111502" url="?curid=142758" title="Pied Piper of Hamelin">
<text>The Pied Piper of Hamelin (, &quot;the Ratcatcher of Hamelin&quot;) is the title character of a legend from the town of Hamelin (Hameln), Lower Saxony, Germany.

The legend dates back to the Middle Ages. The earliest references describe a piper, dressed in multicoloured (&quot;&quot;) clothing, who was a ratcatcher hired by the town to lure rats away with his magic pipe. When the citizens refused to pay for this service as promised, he retaliated by using his instrument&#x27;s magical power on their children, leading them away as he had the rats. This version of the story spread as folklore and has appeared in the writings of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the Brothers Grimm, and Robert Browning, among others. The phrase &quot;pied piper&quot; has become a metaphor for a person who attracts a following through charisma or false promises.

There are many contradictory theories about the Pied Piper. Some suggest he was a symbol of hope to the people of Hamelin, which had been attacked by plague; he drove the rats from Hamelin, saving the people from the epidemic.

==Plot==

In 1284, while the town of Hamelin was suffering from a rat infestation, a piper dressed in multicoloured (&quot;pied&quot;) clothing appeared, claiming to be a rat-catcher. He promised the mayor a solution to their problem with the rats. The mayor, in turn, promised to pay him 1,000 guilders for the removal of the rats. The piper accepted and played his pipe to lure the rats into the Weser River, where all the rats drowned.

Despite the piper&#x27;s success, the mayor reneged on his promise and refused to pay him the full sum (reputedly reduced to 50 guilders) even going so far as to blame the piper for bringing the rats himself in an extortion attempt. Enraged, the piper stormed out of the town, vowing to return later to take revenge. On Saint John and Paul&#x27;s day, while the adults were in church, the piper returned, dressed in green like a hunter and playing his pipe. In so doing, he attracted the town&#x27;s children. One hundred and thirty children followed him out of town and into a mountains’ cave, after which they were never seen again. Depending on the version, at most three children remained behind: one was lame and could not follow quickly enough, the second was deaf and therefore could not hear the music, and the last was blind and therefore unable to see where he was going. These three informed the villagers of what had happened when they came out from church.

Other versions relate that the Pied Piper led the children to the top of Koppelberg Hill, where he took them to a beautiful land, or a place called Koppenberg Mountain, or Transylvania. In yet other versions, he made them walk into the Weser as he did with the rats, and they all drowned. Or, the Piper returned the children after extorting payment, or the children were returned only after the villagers paid several times the original payment in gold.

The Hamelin street named (&quot;street without drums&quot;) is believed to be the last place that the children were seen. Ever since, music or dancing is not allowed on this street.

==Background==

The earliest mention of the story seems to have been on a stained-glass window placed in the Church of Hamelin . The window was described in several accounts between the 14th and 17th centuries. It was destroyed in 1660. Based on the surviving descriptions, a modern reconstruction of the window has been created by historian Hans Dobbertin. It features the colourful figure of the Pied Piper and several figures of children dressed in white.

The window is generally considered to have been created in memory of a tragic historical event for the town; Hamelin town records also apparently start with this event.

Although research has been conducted for centuries, no explanation for the historical event is universally accepted as true. In any case, the rats were first added to the story in a version from and are absent from earlier accounts.

=== 14th-century Decan Lude chorus book ===
Decan Lude of Hamelin was reported to have in his possession a chorus book containing a Latin verse giving an eyewitness account of the event.

===15th-century Lüneburg manuscript===
The Lüneburg manuscript () gives an early German account of the event. An article by James P. O&#x27;Donnell in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; (December 24, 1955) tells how an elderly German researcher, Heinrich Spanuth, discovered the earliest version of the story in the Luneberg city archives in 1936. 

On the back of the last tattered page of a dusty chronicle called &quot;The Golden Chain&quot;, written in Latin in 1370 by the monk Heinrich of Herford, there is written in a different handwriting the following account:&quot;Here follows a marvellous wonder, which transpired in the town of Hamelin in the diocese of Minden, in this Year of Our Lord, 1284, on the Feast of Saints John and Paul. A certain young man thirty years of age, handsome and well-dressed, so that all who saw him admired him because of his appearance, crossed the bridges and entered the town by the West Gate. He then began to play all through the town a silver pipe of the most magnificent sort. All the children who heard his pipe, in the number of 130, followed him to the East Gate and out of the town to the so-called execution place or Calvary. There they proceeded to vanish, so that no trace of them could be found. The mothers of the children ran from town to town, but they found nothing. It is written: A voice was heard from on high, and a mother was bewailing her son. And as one counts the years according to the Year of Our Lord or according to the first, second or third year of an anniversary, so do the people in Hamelin reckon the years after the departure and disappearance of their children. This report I found in an old book. And the mother of the Dean Johann von Lüde saw the children depart.&quot;&quot;&quot;

=== Rattenfängerhaus ===
It is rendered in the following form in an inscription on a house in Hamelin known as the Rattenfängerhaus (Ratcatcher&#x27;s House):

According to author Fanny Rostek-Lühmann this is the oldest surviving account. (High German , meaning a knoll or domed hill) seems to be a reference to one of several hills surrounding Hamelin. Which of them was intended by the manuscript&#x27;s author remains uncertain.

=== The Wedding House ===
A similar inscription can be found on the Hochzeitshaus (Wedding House), a fine structure erected between 1610 and 1617 for marriage festivities, but diverted from its purpose since 1721. Behind rises the spire of the parish church of St. Nicholas which, in the words of an English book of folklore, may still &quot;enwall stones that witness how the parents prayed, while the Piper wrought sorrow for them without&quot;:

=== The Town Gate ===
A portion of the town gate dating from the year 1556 is currently exhibited at the Hamelin Museum. According to Hamelin Museum, this stone is the oldest surviving sculptural evidence for the legend. It bears the following inscription:

=== Verses in the monastery at Hamelin ===
The Hamelin Museum writes:In the mid 14th Century, a monk from Minden, Heinrich von Herford, puts together a collection of holy legends called the &quot;Catena Aurea&quot;.  It speaks of a &quot;miracle&quot; that took place in 1284 in Hamelin.  A youth appeared and played on a strange silver flute.  Every child that heard the flute, followed the stranger.  They left Hamelin by the Eastern gate and disappeared at Kalvarien Hill.  This is the oldest known account of this occurrence. Around this time a verse of rhyme is found in &quot;zu Hameln im Kloster&quot;.  It tells about the children&#x27;s disappearance.  It is written in red ink on the title page of a missal.  It bewails &quot;the 130 beloved Hamelner children&quot; who were &quot;eaten alive by Calvaria&quot;.  The original verses are probably the oldest written source of this legend.  It has been missing for hundreds of years.&quot;&quot;However, different versions of transcriptions of handwritten copies still exist. One was published by Heinrich Meibom in 1688. Another was included by Johann Daniel Gottlieb Herr under the title Passionale Sanctorum in &quot;Collectanea zur Geschichte der Stadt Hameln&quot;. His manuscript is dated 1761. There are some Latin verses which had a prose version underneath:

=== 16th- and 17th-century sources ===
Somewhere between 1559 and 1565, Count Froben Christoph von Zimmern included a version in his . This appears to be the earliest account which mentions the plague of rats. Von Zimmern dates the event only as &quot;several hundred years ago&quot; ( ), so that his version throws no light on the conflict of dates (see next paragraph). Another contemporary account is that of Johann Weyer in his (1563).

== Theories ==
=== Natural causes ===

A number of theories suggest that children died of some natural causes such as disease or starvation, and that the Piper was a symbolic figure of Death. Analogous themes which are associated with this theory include the Dance of Death, or , a common medieval trope. Some of the scenarios that have been suggested as fitting this theory include that the children drowned in the river Weser, were killed in a landslide or contracted some disease during an epidemic. Another modern interpretation reads the story as alluding to an event where Hamelin children were lured away by a pagan or heretic sect to forests near Coppenbrügge (the mysterious &quot;hills&quot; of the poem) for ritual dancing where they all perished during a sudden landslide or collapsing sinkhole.

=== Emigration ===
Speculation on the emigration theory is based on the idea that, by the 13th century, overpopulation of the area resulted in the oldest son owning all the land and power (majorat), leaving the rest as serfs. It has also been suggested that one reason the emigration of the children was never documented was that the children were sold to a recruiter from the Baltic region of Eastern Europe, a practice that was common at the time. In his book &quot;The Pied Piper: A Handbook&quot;, Wolfgang Mieder states that historical documents exist showing that people from the area including Hamelin did help settle parts of Transylvania. Emily Gerard reports in &quot;The Land Beyond the Forest&quot; an element of the folktale that &quot;popular tradition has averred the Germans who about that time made their appearance in Transylvania to be no other than the lost children of Hamelin, who, having performed their long journey by subterranean passages, reissued to the light of day through the opening of a cavern known as the Almescher Höhle, in the north-east of Transylvania.&quot; Transylvania had suffered under lengthy Mongol invasions of Central Europe, led by two grandsons of Genghis Khan and which date from around the time of the earliest appearance of the legend of the piper, the early 13th century.

In the version of the legend posted on the official website for the town of Hamelin, another aspect of the emigration theory is presented:

Among the various interpretations, reference to the colonization of East Europe starting from Low Germany is the most plausible one: The &quot;Children of Hameln&quot; would have been in those days citizens willing to emigrate being recruited by landowners to settle in Moravia, East Prussia, Pomerania or in the Teutonic Land. It is assumed that in past times all people of a town were referred to as &quot;children of the town&quot; or &quot;town children&quot; as is frequently done today. The &quot;Legend of the children&#x27;s Exodus&quot; was later connected to the &quot;Legend of expelling the rats&quot;. This most certainly refers to the rat plagues being a great threat in the medieval milling town and the more or less successful professional &quot;rat catchers&quot;.

The theory is provided credence by the fact that family names common to Hamelin at the time &quot;show up with surprising frequency in the areas of Uckermark and Prignitz, near Berlin.&quot;
Historian Ursula Sautter, citing the work of linguist Jürgen Udolph, offers this hypothesis in support of the emigration theory:

&quot;After the defeat of the Danes at the Battle of Bornhöved in 1227,&quot; explains Udolph, &quot;the region south of the Baltic Sea, which was then inhabited by Slavs, became available for colonization by the Germans.&quot; The bishops and dukes of Pomerania, Brandenburg, Uckermark and Prignitz sent out glib &quot;locators&quot;, medieval recruitment officers, offering rich rewards to those who were willing to move to the new lands. Thousands of young adults from Lower Saxony and Westphalia headed east. And as evidence, about a dozen Westphalian place names show up in this area. Indeed there are five villages called Hindenburg running in a straight line from Westphalia to Pomerania, as well as three eastern Spiegelbergs and a trail of etymology from Beverungen south of Hamelin to Beveringen northwest of Berlin to Beweringen in modern Poland.

Udolph favours the hypothesis that the Hamelin youths wound up in what is now Poland. Genealogist Dick Eastman cited Udolph&#x27;s research on Hamelin surnames that have shown up in Polish phonebooks:

Linguistics professor Jürgen Udolph says that 130 children did vanish on a June day in the year 1284 from the German village of Hamelin ( in German). Udolph entered all the known family names in the village at that time and then started searching for matches elsewhere. He found that the same surnames occur with amazing frequency in the regions of Prignitz and Uckermark, both north of Berlin. He also found the same surnames in the former Pomeranian region, which is now a part of Poland.

Udolph surmises that the children were actually unemployed youths who had been sucked into the German drive to colonize its new settlements in Eastern Europe. The Pied Piper may never have existed as such, but, says the professor, &quot;There were characters known as &quot;lokators&quot; who roamed northern Germany trying to recruit settlers for the East.&quot; Some of them were brightly dressed, and all were silver-tongued.

Professor Udolph can show that the Hamelin exodus should be linked with the Battle of Bornhöved in 1227 which broke the Danish hold on Eastern Europe. That opened the way for German colonization, and by the latter part of the thirteenth century there were systematic attempts to bring able-bodied youths to Brandenburg and Pomerania. The settlement, according to the professor&#x27;s name search, ended up near Starogard in what is now northwestern Poland. A village near Hamelin, for example, is called Beverungen and has an almost exact counterpart called Beveringen, near Pritzwalk, north of Berlin and another called Beweringen, near Starogard.

Local Polish telephone books list names that are not the typical Slavic names one would expect in that region. Instead, many of the names seem to be derived from German names that were common in the village of Hamelin in the thirteenth century. In fact, the names in today&#x27;s Polish telephone directories include Hamel, Hamler and Hamelnikow, all apparently derived from the name of the original village.

=== Other ===
Some theories have linked the disappearance of the children to mass psychogenic illness in the form of dancing mania. Dancing mania outbreaks occurred during the 13th century, including one in 1237 in which a large group of children travelled from Erfurt to Arnstadt (about ), jumping and dancing all the way, in marked similarity to the legend of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, which originated at around the same time.

Others have suggested that the children left Hamelin to be part of a pilgrimage, a military campaign, or even a new Children&#x27;s Crusade (which is said to have occurred in 1212) but never returned to their parents. These theories see the unnamed Piper as their leader or a recruiting agent. The townspeople made up this story (instead of recording the facts) to avoid the wrath of the church or the king.

William Manchester&#x27;s &quot;A World Lit Only by Fire&quot; places the events in 1484, and further proposes that the Pied Piper was a psychopathic paedophile.

&quot;&quot;The Piper is coming nearer,&quot; he said, &quot;he is nearer than he was that evening I saw him before. His long, shadowy cloak is blowing around him. He pipes—he pipes—and we must follow—Jem and Carl and Jerry and I—round and round the world. Listen—listen—can&#x27;t you hear his wild music?&quot;&quot;

* In 2024, &quot;Book 1: Hamelin&quot;, the first book in &quot;The Children of the Piper&quot; series by Peter Smart, was published by PiperHaus () and is a fully illustrated twist on the classic tale told from the point of view of 13-year-old Sofia Müller, a girl living in Hamelin at the time. Instead of asking for gold or silver to get rid of the town&#x27;s rat infestation, the piper asks for a promise instead: because the adults of the town had not been treating the children very well, they must agree to start treating them as they wished they would have been treated when they were children themselves. A year later, after the townsfolk fail to keep their promise, the piper takes the children away.

==Allusions in linguistics==
In linguistics, &quot;pied-piping&quot; is the common name for the ability of question words and relative pronouns to drag other words along with them when brought to the front, as part of the phenomenon called Wh-movement. For example, in &quot;For whom are the pictures?&quot;, the word &quot;for&quot; is &quot;pied-piped&quot; by &quot;whom&quot; away from its declarative position (&quot;The pictures are for me&quot;), and in &quot;The mayor, pictures of whom adorn his office walls&quot; both words &quot;pictures of&quot; are pied-piped in front of the relative pronoun, which normally starts the relative clause.

Some researchers believe that the tale has inspired the common English phrase &quot;pay the piper&quot;. This phrase implies that the person who provides payment or funding for something has the authority to dictate how it should be done. However, the phrase &quot;pay the piper&quot; may also be a contraction of the English proverb &quot;he who pays the piper calls the tune.&quot; This proverb, in contrast to the modern interpretation of paying a debt, suggests that the person who bears the financial responsibility for something also has the right to determine how it should be carried out.

== Modernity ==
The present-day city of Hamelin continues to maintain information about the Pied Piper legend and possible origins of the story on its website. Interest in the city&#x27;s connection to the story remains so strong that, in 2009, Hamelin held a tourist festival to mark the 725th anniversary of the disappearance of the town&#x27;s earlier children. The Ratcatcher&#x27;s House is popular with visitors, although it bears no connection to the Rat-Catcher version of the legend. Indeed, the Rattenfängerhaus is instead associated with the story due to the earlier inscription upon its facade mentioning the legend. The house was built much later, in 1602 and 1603. It is now a Hamelin City-owned restaurant with a Pied Piper theme throughout. The city also maintains an online shop with rat-themed merchandise as well as offering an officially licensed Hamelin Edition of the popular board game &quot;Monopoly&quot; which depicts the legendary Piper on the cover.

In addition to the recent milestone festival, each year the city marks 26 June as &quot;Ratcatcher&#x27;s Day&quot;. In the United States, a similar holiday for exterminators based on Ratcatcher&#x27;s Day is marked on 22 July, but has not caught on.

<text>An interceptor aircraft, or simply interceptor, is a type of fighter aircraft designed specifically for the defensive interception role against an attacking enemy aircraft, particularly bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. Aircraft that are capable of being or are employed as both &quot;standard&quot; air superiority fighters and as interceptors are sometimes known as fighter-interceptors. In the post-World War 2 jet age, there are two general classes of interceptor: light fighters, designed for high performance over short range; and heavy fighters, which are intended to operate over longer ranges, in contested airspace and adverse meteorological conditions. While the second type was exemplified historically by specialized night fighter and all-weather interceptor designs, the integration of mid-air refueling, satellite navigation, on-board radar, and beyond visual range (BVR) missile systems since the 1960s has allowed most frontline fighter designs to fill the roles once reserved for specialized night/all-weather fighters. 

For daytime operations, conventional light fighters have normally filled the interceptor role. Day interceptors have been used in a defensive role since World War I, and are perhaps best known from major actions like the Battle of Britain, when the Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane were part of a successful defensive strategy. However, dramatic improvements in both ground-based and airborne radar gave greater flexibility to existing fighters and few later designs were conceived as dedicated day interceptors. Exceptions include the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet, which was the only rocket-powered, crewed military aircraft to see combat. To a lesser degree, the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15, which had heavy armament specifically intended for anti-bomber missions, was also a specialized day interceptor.

Night fighters and bomber destroyers are interceptors of the heavy type, although initially they were rarely referred to as such. In the early Cold War era the combination of jet-powered bombers and nuclear weapons created air force demand for highly capable interceptors; it is in regards to this period that the term is perhaps most recognized and used. Cold War-era interceptors became increasingly distinct from their air superiority counterparts, with the former often sacrificing range, endurance, and maneuverability for speed, rate of climb, and armament dedicated to attacking large strategic bombers. Examples of classic interceptors of this era include the Convair F-106 Delta Dart, Sukhoi Su-15, and English Electric Lightning.

Through the 1960s and 1970s, the rapid improvements in design led to most air-superiority and multirole fighters, such as the Grumman F-14 Tomcat and McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, having the performance to take on the point defense interception role, and the strategic threat moved from bombers to intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Dedicated interceptor designs became increasingly rare, with the only widely used examples designed after the 1960s being the Panavia Tornado ADV, Mikoyan MiG-25, Mikoyan MiG-31, and the Shenyang J-8.

==History==

The first interceptor squadrons were formed during World War I to defend London against attacks by Zeppelins and later against fixed-wing long-range bombers. Early units generally used aircraft withdrawn from front-line service, notably the Sopwith Pup. They were told about their target&#x27;s location before take-off from a command centre in the Horse Guards building. The Pup proved to have too low performance to easily intercept Gotha G.IV bombers, and the superior Sopwith Camels supplanted them.

The term &quot;interceptor&quot; was in use by 1929. Through the 1930s, bomber aircraft speeds increased so much that conventional interceptor tactics appeared impossible. Visual and acoustic detection from the ground had a range of only a few miles, which meant that an interceptor would have insufficient time to climb to altitude before the bombers reached their targets. Standing combat air patrols were possible but only at great cost. The conclusion at the time was that &quot;the bomber will always get through&quot;.

The invention of radar made possible early, long-range detection of aircraft on the order of , both day and night and in all weather. A typical bomber might take twenty minutes to cross the detection zone of early radar systems, time enough for interceptor fighters to start up, climb to altitude and engage the bombers. Ground controlled interception required constant contact between the interceptor and the ground until the bombers became visible to the pilots and nationwide networks like the Dowding system were built in the late 1930s to coordinate these efforts.

During World War II the effectiveness of interceptor aircraft meant that bombers often needed to be escorted by long range fighter aircraft. Many aircraft were able to be fitted with Aircraft interception radar, further facilitating the interception of enemy aircraft.

The introduction of jet power increased flight speeds from around to around in a step and roughly doubled operational altitudes. Although radars also improved in performance, the gap between offense and defense was dramatically reduced. Large attacks could so confuse the defense&#x27;s ability to communicate with pilots that the classic method of manual ground controlled interception was increasingly seen as inadequate. In the United States, this led to the introduction of the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment to computerize this task, while in the UK it led to enormously powerful radars to improve detection time.

The introduction of the first useful surface to air missiles in the 1950s obviated the need for fast reaction time interceptors as the missile could launch almost instantly. Air forces increasingly turned to much larger interceptor designs, with enough fuel for longer endurance, leaving the point-defense role to the missiles. This led to the abandonment of a number of short-range designs like the Avro Arrow and Convair F-102 in favor of much larger and longer-ranged designs like the North American F-108 and MiG-25. 

In the 1950s and 1960’s during the Cold War, a strong interceptor force was crucial for the opposing superpowers as it was the best means to defend against an unexpected nuclear attack by strategic bombers. Hence, for a brief period of time they fared rapid development in both speed, range, and altitude. At the end of the 1960s, a nuclear attack became unstoppable with the introduction of ballistic missiles capable of approaching from outside the atmosphere at speeds as high as . The doctrine of mutually assured destruction replaced the trend of defense strengthening, making interceptors less strategically logical. The utility of interceptors waned as the role merged with that of the heavy air superiority fighter.

The interceptor mission is, by its nature, a difficult one. Consider the desire to protect a single target from attack by long-range bombers. The bombers have the advantage of being able to select the parameters of the mission – attack vector, speed and altitude. This results in an enormous area from which the attack can originate. In the time it takes for the bombers to cross the distance from first detection to being on their targets, the interceptor must be able to start, take off, climb to altitude, maneuver for attack and then attack the bomber.

A dedicated interceptor aircraft sacrifices the capabilities of the air superiority fighter and multirole fighter (i.e., countering enemy fighter aircraft in air combat manoeuvring), by tuning its performance for either fast climbs or high speeds. The result is that interceptors often look very impressive on paper, typically outrunning, outclimbing and outgunning slower fighter designs. However, pure interceptors fare poorly in fighter-to-fighter combat against the same &quot;less capable&quot; designs due to limited maneuverability especially at low altitudes and speeds.

===Point-defense interceptors===


In the spectrum of various interceptors, one design approach especially shows sacrifices necessary to achieve decisive benefit in a chosen aspect of performance. A &quot;point defense interceptor&quot; is of a lightweight design, intended to spend most of its time on the ground located at the defended target, and able to launch on demand, climb to altitude, manoeuvre and then attack the bomber in a very short time, before the bomber can deploy its weapons.

At the end of Second World War, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s most critical requirement was for interceptors as the Commonwealth and American air forces pounded German targets night and day. As the bombing effort grew, notably in early 1944, the Luftwaffe introduced a rocket-powered design, the Messerschmitt Me 163 &quot;Komet&quot;, in the very-short-range interceptor role. The engine allowed about 7 minutes of powered flight, but offered such tremendous performance that they could fly right by the defending fighters. The Me 163 required an airbase, however, which were soon under constant attack. Following the Emergency Fighter Program, the Germans developed even odder designs, such as the Bachem Ba 349 &quot;Natter&quot;, which launched vertically and thus eliminated the need for an airbase. In general all these initial German designs proved difficult to operate, often becoming death traps for their pilots, and had little effect on the bombing raids. Rocket-boosted variants of both of Germany&#x27;s jet fighters; the Me 262 in its &quot;C&quot; subtype series, all nicknamed &quot;home protector&quot; (&quot;Heimatschützer&quot;, in four differing formats) and the planned He 162E subtype, using one of the same BMW 003R turbojet/rocket &quot;mixed-power&quot; engine as the Me 262C-2b &quot;Heimatschützer II&quot;, but were never produced in quantity.

In the initial stage of Cold War, bombers were expected to attack flying higher and faster, even at transonic speeds. Initial transonic and supersonic fighters had modest internal fuel tanks in their slim fuselages, but a very high fuel consumption. This led fighter prototypes emphasizing acceleration and operational ceiling, with a sacrifice on the loiter time, essentially limiting them to point defense role. Such were the mixed jet/rocket power Republic XF-91 or Saunders Roe SR.53. The Soviet and Western trials with zero-length launch were also related. None of these found practical use. Designs that depended solely on jet engines achieved more success with the F-104 Starfighter (initial A version) and the English Electric Lightning.

The role of crewed point defense designs was reassigned to uncrewed interceptors—surface-to-air missiles (SAMs)—which first reached an adequate level in 1954–1957. SAM advancements ended the concept of massed high-altitude bomber operations, in favor of penetrators (and later cruise missiles) flying a combination of techniques colloquially known as &quot;flying below the radar&quot;. By flying terrain masking low-altitude nap-of-the-earth flight profiles the effective range, and therefore reaction time, of ground-based radar was limited to at best the radar horizon. In the case of ground radar systems this can be countered by placing radar systems on mountain tops to extend the radar horizon, or through placing high performance radars in interceptors or in AWACS aircraft used to direct point defense interceptors.

===Area defense===
As capabilities continued to improve – especially through the widespread introduction of the jet engine and the adoption of high speed, low level flight profiles, the time available between detection and interception dropped. Most advanced point defence interceptors combined with long-range radars were struggling to keep the reaction time down enough to be effective. Fixed times, like the time needed for the pilot to climb into the cockpit, became an increasing portion of the overall mission time, there were few ways to reduce this. During the Cold War in times of heightened tensions, quick reaction alert (QRA) aircraft were kept piloted, fully fueled and armed, with the engines running at idle on the runway ready to take off. The aircraft being kept topped up with fuel via hoses from underground fuel tanks. If a possible intruder was identified, the aircraft would be ready to take off as soon as the external fuel lines were detached. However, keeping QRA aircraft at this state of readiness was physically and mentally draining to the pilots and was expensive in terms of fuel.

As an alternative, longer-range designs with extended loiter times were considered. These &quot;area defense interceptors&quot; or &quot;area defense fighters&quot; were in general larger designs intended to stay on lengthy patrol and protect a much larger area from attack, depending on greater detection capabilities, both in the aircraft themselves and operating with AWACS, rather than high speed to reach targets. The exemplar of this concept was the Tupolev Tu-28. The later Panavia Tornado ADV was able to achieve long range in a smaller airframe through the use of more efficient engines. Rather than focusing on acceleration and climb rate, the design emphasis is on range and missile carrying capacity, which together translate into combat endurance, look-down/shoot-down radars good enough to detect and track fast moving interdictors against ground clutter, and the capability to provide guidance to air-to-air missiles (AAM) against these targets. High speed and acceleration was put into long-range and medium-range AAMs, and agility into short range dog fighting AAMs, rather than into the aircraft themselves. They were first to introduce all-weather avionics, assuring successful operations during night, rain, snow, or fog.

Countries that were strategically dependent on surface fleet, most notably US and UK, maintained also &quot;fleet defense fighters&quot;, such as the F-14 Tomcat.

==Development==
===Soviet Union and Russia===

During the Cold War, an entire military service, not just an arm of the pre-existing air force, was designated for deployment of interceptors. The aircraft of the Soviet Air Defence Forces (PVO-S) differed from those of the Soviet Air Forces (VVS) in that they were by no means small or crudely simple, but huge and refined with large, sophisticated radars; they could not take off from grass, only concrete runways; they could not be disassembled and shipped back to a maintenance center in a boxcar. Similarly, their pilots were given less training in combat maneuvers, and more in radio-directed pursuit.

The Soviets&#x27; main interceptor was initially the Su-9, which was followed by the Su-15 and the MiG-25 &quot;Foxbat&quot;. The auxiliary Tu-128, an area range interceptor, was notably the heaviest fighter aircraft ever to see service in the world. The latest and most advanced interceptor aircraft in the Soviet (now Russian) inventory is the MiG-31 &quot;Foxhound&quot;. Improving on some of the flaws on the proceeding MiG-25, the MiG-31 has better low altitude and low speed performance, in addition to carrying an internal cannon.

Russia, despite merging the PVO into the VVS, continues to maintain its dedicated MiG-31 interceptor fleet.

===United States===

In 1937, USAAC lieutenants Gordon P. Saville and Benjamin S. Kelsey devised a pair of proposals for interceptor aircraft, the first such designation in the US. One proposal was for a single-engine fighter, the other for a twin-engine. Both were required to reach an altitude of in six minutes as a defense against bomber attack. Kelsey said later that he used the &quot;interceptor&quot; designation to sidestep a hard USAAC policy restricting fighters to of armament. He wished for at least of armament so that American fighters could dominate their battles against all opponents, fighters included. The two aircraft resulting from these proposals were the single-engine Bell P-39 Airacobra and the twin-engine Lockheed P-38 Lightning. Both aircraft were successful during World War II in standard fighter roles, not specifically assigned to point defense against bombers.

From 1946 to 1980 the United States maintained a dedicated Aerospace Defense Command, consisting primarily of dedicated interceptors. Many post-war designs were of limited performance, including designs like the F-86D and F-89 Scorpion. In the late 1940s ADC started a project to build a much more advanced interceptor under the 1954 interceptor effort, which eventually delivered the F-106 Delta Dart after a lengthy development process. Further replacements were studied, notably the NR-349 proposal during the 1960s, but came to nothing as the USSR strengthened their strategic force with ICBMs. Hence, the F-106 ended up serving as the primary USAF interceptor into the 1980s.

As the F-106 was retired, intercept missions were assigned to the contemporary F-15 and F-16 fighters, among their other roles. The F-16, however, was originally designed for air superiority while evolving into a versatile multirole fighter. The F-15, with its Mach 2.5 maximum speed enabling it to intercept the fastest enemy aircraft (namely the MiG-25 Foxbat), is also not a pure interceptor as it has exceptional agility for dogfighting based upon the lessons learned from Vietnam; the F-15E Strike Eagle variant adds air interdiction while retaining the interception and air-to-air combat of other F-15s. Presently, the F-22 is the USA&#x27;s latest combat aircraft that serves in part as an interceptor due to its Mach 2+ speed as well as supercruise capabilities, however it was designed primarily as a stealth air superiority fighter.

In the 1950s, the United States Navy led an unsuccessful F6D Missileer project. Later it launched the development of a large F-111B fleet air defense fighter, but this project was cancelled too. Finally, the role was assigned to the F-14 Tomcat, carrying AIM-54 Phoenix missiles. Like the USAF&#x27;s F-15, the USN&#x27;s F-14 was also designed primarily as an air superiority (fighter-to-fighter combat) and F-14s served the interceptor role until it received upgrades in the 1990s for ground attack. Both the fighter and the Phoenix missile were retired in 2006.

===United Kingdom===
The British Royal Air Force operated a supersonic day fighter, the English Electric Lightning, alongside the Gloster Javelin in the subsonic night/all-weather role. Efforts to replace the Javelin with a supersonic design under Operational Requirement F.155 came to naught. The UK operated its own, highly adapted version of the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom as its primary interceptor from the mid-1970s, with the air defence variant (ADV) of the Panavia Tornado being introduced in the 1980s. The Tornado was eventually replaced with a multirole design, the Eurofighter Typhoon.

===China===
The Shenyang J-8 is a high-speed, high-altitude Chinese-built single-seat interceptor. Initially designed in the early 1960s to counter US-built B-58 Hustler bombers, F-105 Thunderchief fighter-bombers and Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance planes, it still retains the ability to &#x27;sprint&#x27; at Mach 2+ speeds, and later versions can carry medium-range PL-12/SD-10 MRAAM missiles for interception purposes. The PLAAF/PLANAF currently still operates approximately 300 or so J-8s of various configurations.

===Other countries===

Several other countries also introduced interceptor designs, although in the 1950s–1960s several planned interceptors never came to fruition, with the expectation that missiles would replace bombers.

The Argentine FMA I.Ae. 37 was a prototype jet fighter developed during the 1950s. It never flew and was cancelled in 1960.

The Canadian subsonic Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck served in numbers through 1950s. Its supersonic replacement, the CF-105 Arrow (&quot;Avro Arrow&quot;), was controversially cancelled in 1959.

The Swedish Saab 35 Draken was specifically designed for intercepting aircraft passing Swedish airspace at high altitudes in the event of a war between the Soviet Union and NATO. With the advent of low flying cruise-missiles and high-altitude AA-missiles the flight profile was changed, but regained the interceptor profile with the final version J 35J.

<text>John Xiphilinus or Joannes Xiphilinos (), of Dio Cassius, lived at Constantinople during the latter half of the 11th century AD. He was a monk and a member of the Xiphilinus family, a nephew of Patriarch John VIII of Constantinople, a well-known preacher (Migne, &quot;Patrologia Graeca&quot;, cxx.).

The epitome of Dio was prepared by order of Michael Parapinaces (1071–1078), but is incomplete. It comprises books 36–80, the period included being from the times of Pompey and Caesar down to Alexander Severus. In book 70 the reign of Antoninus Pius and the early years of Marcus Aurelius appear to have been missing in his copy, while in books 78 and 79 a mutilated original must have been used. Xiphilinus divided the work into sections, each containing the life of an emperor. He omitted the names of the consuls and sometimes altered or emended the original. The epitome is valuable as preserving the chief incidents of the period for which the authority of Dio is wanting.

<text>George Pachymeres (; 1242 – 1310) was a Byzantine Greek historian, philosopher, music theorist and miscellaneous writer.

==Biography==
Pachymeres was born at Nicaea, in Bithynia, where his father had taken refuge after the capture of Constantinople by the Latins in 1204. Upon the recovery of Constantinople from the Latin Empire by Michael VIII Palaeologus, Pachymeres settled there, studied law, entered the church, and subsequently became chief advocate of the church and chief justice of the imperial court.

His literary activity was considerable, his most important work being a Byzantine history in thirteen books, in continuation of that of George Acropolites from 1261 to 1308, containing the history of the reigns of Michael and Andronicus II Palaeologus. Pachymeres was also the author of rhetorical exercises on philosophical themes; of a &quot;Quadrivium&quot; (arithmetic, music, geometry, astronomy), valuable for the history of music and astronomy in the Middle Ages; a general sketch of Aristotelian philosophy; a paraphrase of the speeches and letters of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite; poems, including an autobiography; and a description of the square of the &quot;Augustaeum&quot;, and the column erected by Justinian in the church of Hagia Sophia to commemorate his victories over the Persians.

The &quot;History&quot; was first published in print by I. Bekker (1835) in the &quot;Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae&quot;; also by J. P. Migne, in &quot;Patrologia Graeca&quot; (vol. cxliii, cxliv); for editions of the minor works see Karl Krumbacher, &quot;Geschichte der byzantinischen Litteratur&quot; (1897). A more recent edition with French translation of the &quot;History&quot; by Albert Failler (editor) and Vitalien Laurent (translator) was published in 1984. An English translation of Books I and II (up to the recovery of Constantinople in 1261), with commentary, exists in the form of a Ph.D. thesis by Nathan John Cassidy held in the Reid Library of the University of Western Australia.

<text>Lock picking is the practice of unlocking a lock by manipulating the components of the lock device without the original key.

Although lock-picking can be associated with criminal intent, it is an essential skill for the legitimate profession of locksmithing, and is also pursued by law-abiding citizens as a useful skill to learn, or simply as a hobby (locksport).

In some countries, such as Japan, lock-picking tools are illegal for most people to possess, but in many others, they are available and legal to own as long as there is no intent to use them for criminal purposes.
== History ==

Locks by definition secure or fasten something with the intention that access is possible only with the matching key. Despite this, criminal lock picking likely started with the first locks. Famed locksmith Alfred Charles Hobbs said in the mid-1800s:
Professional and recreational lock picking also has a long history. King Louis XVI of France (1754–1793) was a keen designer, picker, and manipulator of locks, and physicist Richard Feynman picked locks for fun in the 1940s while employed on the Manhattan Project. The tradition of student roof and tunnel hacking at MIT included lockpicking, and their guide to this was made widely available in 1991.

Beginning in 1997 more organized recreational lockpicking has now grown and developed a competitive aspect in &quot;locksport&quot;, along with its own governing body, Locksport International.

== Tools ==
=== Skeleton keys ===

The warded pick, also known as a skeleton key, is used for opening warded locks. It is generally made to conform to a generalized key shape relatively simpler than the actual key used to open the lock; this simpler shape allows for internal manipulations.

The keys for warded locks only require the back end manipulating which is the end which opens the lock. The other parts are there to distinguish between different varieties of their locks. For example, for a chest of drawers with a warded lock, a skeleton key for that type of warded lock can be made by filing away all but the last one or two teeth or bittings on both sides of the blade. Additionally, a series of grooves on either side of the key&#x27;s blade limit the type of lock the key can slide into. As the key slides into the lock through the keyway, the wards align with the grooves in the key&#x27;s profile to allow or deny entry into the lock cylinder.

=== Pin tumbler lock picking ===
==== Comb picking ====

Comb picks push all the key and driver pins above the shear line allowing you to open the lock.

==== Tension wrench ====

The tension wrench or torsion wrench, is generally used when picking a pin tumbler or wafer lock. It is used to apply torque to the plug of a lock to hold any picked pins in place. Once all pins are picked, the tension wrench is then used to turn the plug and open the lock. There are two basic types of tension: &quot;bottom of the keyway&quot; and &quot;top of the keyway&quot;. The bottom of the keyway wrenches is typically shaped like a letter &quot;L&quot;, although the vertical part of the letter is elongated in comparison to the horizontal part. Other tension tools, especially those for use with cars, resemble a pair of tweezers and allow the user to apply torque to both the top and the bottom of the lock. These are commonly used with double-sided wafer locks.

==== Half-diamond pick ====
This versatile pick is included in nearly all kits and is mainly used for picking individual pins, but can also be used for raking and wafer and disk locks. The triangular-shaped half-diamond is usually long. The angles that form the base of the half-diamond can be either steep or shallow, depending on the need for picking without affecting neighboring pins, or raking as appropriate. A normal set comprises around three half-diamond picks and a full-diamond pick.

==== Hook pick ====

The hook pick is similar to the half-diamond pick but has a hook-shaped tip rather than a half-diamond shape. The hook pick is sometimes referred to as a &quot;feeler&quot; or &quot;finger&quot; and is not used for raking. This is the most basic lockpicking tool and is all that a professional will usually need if the lock is to be picked in the traditional sense rather than opened by raking or using a pick gun. A variety of differently sized and shaped hooks are available in a normal set.

==== Ball pick ====
The ball pick is similar to the half-diamond pick, except the end of the pick has a half or full circle shape. This pick is commonly used to open wafer locks.

==== Rake picks ====

These picks, such as the common snake rake, are designed to &quot;rake&quot; pins by rapidly sliding the pick past all the pins, repeatedly, to bounce the pins until they reach the shear line. This method requires much less skill than picking pins individually and generally works well on cheaper locks. Advanced rakes are available which are shaped to mimic various pin height key positions and are considerably easier to use than traditional rakes. Such rakes are typically machined from a template of common key configurations since not all permutations of pin heights for adjacent pins are possible given the process by which keys are manufactured.

==== Decoder pick ====
The decoder pick is a key which has been adapted such that the height of its notches can be changed, either by screwing them into the blade base or by adjusting them from the handle while the key is in the lock. This will allow not only access to the lock but also a template for cutting a replacement key.

==== Bump keys ====

The simplest way to open the majority of pin locks is to insert a key (or variety of keys) that has been cut so that each peak of the key is equal and has been cut down to the lowest groove of the key. This key is then struck sharply with a hammer whilst applying torque. The force of the blow is carried down the length of the key and (operating as does a Newton&#x27;s cradle) will move only the driver pins, leaving the key pins in place. If done correctly, this briefly creates a gap around the shear line, allowing the plug to rotate freely. Some modern high-security locks include bumping protection, such as Master Lock&#x27;s &quot;BumpStop&quot; and ILCO&#x27;s &quot;Bump Halt&quot; technology.

=== Wafer tumbler lock picking ===
==== Jigglers or try-out keys ====
The majority of wafer tumbler locks can be opened with a set of jigglers or try-out keys. They can also be opened with pin-tumbler picks.

==== Pick guns ====
The manual pick gun (or snap gun) was invented by Ely Epstein. It usually has a &quot;trigger&quot; that creates a movement which (like bump keys) transfers sudden energy to the key pins, which communicate this to the driver pins, causing only those pins to jump, allowing the cylinder to turn freely for a brief moment, until the pin springs return the pins to their locking position. Electric versions are also common, whereby simply pressing a button vibrates the pins while a normal torsion wrench is being used.

==== Tubular lock pick ====
A tubular lock pick is a specialized lockpicking tool used for opening a tubular pin tumbler lock. Tubular lock picks are all very similar in design and come in sizes to fit all major tubular locks, including 6, 7, 8, and 10-pin locks. The tool is simply inserted into the lock and turned clockwise with medium torque. As the tool is pushed into the lock, each of the pins is slowly forced down until they stop, thus binding the driver pins behind the shear line of the lock. When the final pin is pushed down, the shear plane is clear and the lock opens. This can usually be accomplished in a matter of seconds.

Most tubular lock picks come with a &quot;decoder&quot; which lets the locksmith know at what depths the pins broke the shear plane. By using the decoding key after the lock has been picked, the locksmith can cut a tubular key to the correct pin depths and thus avoid having to replace the lock.

== Anti-picking methods ==

The history of lock development, particularly modern locks, is largely one of an arms race between lock pickers and lock inventors.

Today&#x27;s anti-picking methods in standard pin tumbler locks include the use of sidewards which obstruct the keyway and &quot;security pins&quot; or &quot;carnival pins&quot;. These are shaped like a spool, mushroom, or barrel, with the effect that they feel as though they have set when in fact they have not. Security pins can also have the effect of resetting other pins when adjusted.

== Legal status ==
=== Australia ===
In Australia, possession of lock picking equipment is legal. However, it may count toward evidence of intent to commit a crime if otherwise incriminating circumstances warrant reasonable suspicion by police. For example, Queensland state law states:

&quot;A person possessing lock picks, an electronic car door lock scanner, or a jemmy in other than easily explainable circumstances, e.g., a locksmith, carpenter, or a person undertaking home renovations, may warrant the suspicion of police that the person may intend to used [sic] the equipment for a burglary or vehicle theft. Obviously, the suspicion held by police must be reasonable and therefore will be dependent on the circumstances under which the person is found with the items.&quot;

=== Canada ===
In B.C. and Ontario Canada, a license is required to carry out locksmithing professionally. It is legal for hobbyists who are not locksmiths to pick locks that they own.

Under Section 351 of the Canadian Criminal Code, lock pick tools fit in the same category as crowbars or hammers, meaning they are legal to possess and use unless they are used to commit a crime or if it is shown there was the intention to commit a crime. 

The relevant section states: &quot;Every person who, without lawful excuse, has in their possession any instrument suitable for breaking into any place, motor vehicle, vault or safe knowing that the instrument has been used or is intended to be used for that purpose,

(a) is guilty of an indictable offense and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years; or

(b) is guilty of an offense punishable on summary conviction.&quot;

Some provinces require a license to carry lock picks. Unlike most laws in Canada, the onus is on the defendant to prove that they have a legal purpose to use the lock picks. Similar to some drug trafficking offenses, this may be automatically applied if possession is discovered, though corroborating evidence is needed to support these charges. Hobbyist use and indications thereof should constitute reasonable doubt, though the defendant must prove legal purposes, the crown must still indicate the charges are reasonable given the circumstances. For example, the discovery of lock picks in a dwelling house in absence of other indications of burglary are not grounds for this charge. It is not uncommon for hackathon events in Canada to have lock picking challenges, and this would constitute a reasonable and legal reason for possession.

=== Germany ===
There is no law or regulation on lock picking, so it is legal as long as one has permission from the owner of the lock to pick the lock in question. Lock picking tools can be freely bought and sold. There are several clubs where lock picking is practiced as a sport. Lock picking has also become a popular part of geocaching in Germany. There are also lock picking workshops at geocaching events.

=== European Union ===
Most countries of the European Union don&#x27;t regulate the possession of lockpicks. All responsibility concerning criminal or legal acts using the picks is taken by the owner of the lockpicks.

=== Hungary ===
Unusually for a country in the EU, ownership of lock picks in Hungary on public property is prohibited. 

=== Japan ===
Japan&#x27;s law prohibits possession of any lock picking tools and imposes a penalty of one-year imprisonment or a 500,000 yen fine.

=== Netherlands ===
In the Netherlands, owning lock picks is legal, but using them on someone else&#x27;s locks without permission is not. There is a lock picking championship, the Dutch Open (organized by TOOOL), which started in 2002 and features competitors from around the world. The competition is held during LockCon, an annual conference about locks.

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, lock picking tools are not illegal, but possession with the intent to use them for burglary carries a potential penalty of three years in prison.

=== Poland ===
In Poland, according to Article 129/1 of the Misdemeanor Code: both (1) possessing, producing or obtaining a lock pick by a person whose profession and occupation does not require it; and (2) delivering a lock pick to a person whose profession and occupation does not require it is punishable with arrest, freedom limitation or fine - and (3) a lock pick is forfeited even if it was not the property of the principal.

=== United Kingdom ===
In England and Wales, a person who, not within their abode, has any article to be used in the course of or in connection with any burglary or theft can potentially be prosecuted. A successful prosecution would need to prove intention to use the tools for that purpose at the time of possession. As an either way offence, the maximum penalty for this is 3 years imprisonment if tried in the Crown Court, and 12 months if tried in the Magistrates&#x27; Court.

=== United States ===
In the United States, laws concerning possession of lock picks vary from state to state. Generally, possession and use of lock picks is considered equivalent to the possession of a crowbar or any other tool that may or may not be used in a burglary. Possession of lock picks with an intent for their unlawful use is generally prosecuted as a misdemeanor under the category of possession of burglary tools or similar statutes. In many states, simple possession of lock picks is completely legal, as the statutes only prohibit the possession of lock picks or the activity of lock picking &quot;when there is a malicious intent&quot;. This is the case in Arizona, California, Utah, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Washington D.C., Washington State, and New York. Some states, such as California and New York, impose restrictions on businesses, such as prohibiting the operation of a locksmithing business without a license and imposing requirements to keep records about sales of lock picking devices.
