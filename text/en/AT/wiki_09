==History==
Located along the banks of the Clinch River, Richlands began as a farming community and was named for its fertile &quot;rich lands.&quot;

The Clinch Valley Coal &amp; Iron Company began to develop Richlands in 1890, and company officials hoped Richlands&#x27; readily available coal, iron, and timber might make it the &quot;Pittsburgh of the South.&quot; The company abandoned its plans following the stock market crash of 1893.

In February 1893, Richlands was the site of a mass lynching of five black railroad workers after it was alleged some of the men had robbed and beaten a white man. Four of the railroad workers were arrested and held in the Richlands jail, but the jailor was overpowered by a mob of white townspeople, including James Hurt, a magistrate and member of the Richlands town council, and James Crabtree, a prominent businessman, who removed the four men and hanged them from the same tree. A fifth black railroad worker was later found and lynched.

The Richlands Historic District encompasses much of downtown Richlands, and the Tazewell Avenue Historic District, and Williams House, are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="137801" wikidata="Q508358" url="?curid=137801" title="Front Royal, Virginia">
<text>Front Royal is the only incorporated town in Warren County, Virginia, United States. The population was estimated at 15,400 as of 2023. It is the county seat of Warren County.

== History ==

The entire Shenandoah Valley including the area to become Front Royal was annexed and claimed for hunting by the Iroquois Confederation during the later Beaver Wars, by 1672. Some bands of the Shawnee settled in the area as client groups to the Iroquois and alternately to the Cherokee after 1721. The Iroquois formally sold their entire claim east of the Alleghenies to the Virginia Colony at the Treaty of Lancaster in 1744. Front Royal, originally settled in 1754, had been known to European explorers as early as the 1670s, and the nearby settlement of Chester&#x27;s Ferry was in existence by 1736. The town also had a well-known nickname by the 1790s, &quot;Helltown,&quot; due to the many livestock wranglers and boatmen on the Shenandoah coming through the area, who came into town looking for alcohol. It was incorporated as &quot;Front Royal&quot; in 1788.

Rail service was established in 1854 with the construction of the Alexandria, Orange and Manassas Gap Railroad between Manassas and Riverton. This line was soon extended to Strasburg in time to become a factor in the Battle of Front Royal on May 23, 1862, and throughout the Civil War. Lumber, agriculture, manufacturing and grain mills provided employment in the region for decades after the Civil War.

The American Viscose rayon plant, once Front Royal&#x27;s principal employer, with 3,000 workers at its peak, operated between the 1930s and 1989. The plant manufactured rayon for tires during World War II and later produced rayon for rocket nozzles for the Defense Department and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

===Etymology===
Several theories regarding the origins of the name &quot;Front Royal&quot; have been suggested.

A common theory is that the town was named for a giant oak tree – the &quot;Royal&quot; Tree of England – that stood in the public square during colonial days where Chester and Main Streets now join. It was there that the local militia were drilled. During drills, a frequent command given by the drill sergeant was, &quot;front the Royal Oak!&quot; The command was repeated and eventually shortened to simply &quot;Front Royal&quot;. This theory is supported by a bulletin published by the United States Geological Survey in 1905, which states that the town was first known as Royal Oak, with the current name being derived from the commands of a confused colonel.

A second account holds that when local militia were stationed around the town during the American Revolution, the sentry would call out &quot;Front&quot;, to which the required entry password was to respond &quot;Royal&quot;. Eventually their military post became known as &quot;Camp Front Royal&quot;.

A third version holds that, in early decades of European settlement, the area was referred to in French as &quot;le front royal&quot;, meaning the British frontier. French settlers, trappers, and explorers in the Ohio Country of the mid-18th century were referring to the land grant made by King Charles II, then in control of Thomas, Lord Fairfax, Baron of Cameron. In English, &quot;le front royal&quot; is translated to the &quot;Royal Frontier&quot;.

The name was in common usage by 1788, when the town was incorporated as &quot;Front-Royal.&quot;

The plant, which was built by the American Viscose Corporation in the 1930s and at one time employed nearly 3,500 workers, was closed in 1989 after being cited for more than 2,000 environmental violations over five years, including emissions of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) into the Shenandoah River. The plant&#x27;s main buildings were demolished in 1997 as part of the cleanup.

The Front Royal Cardinals baseball team joined the Valley League in 1984. Games are played in Bing Crosby Stadium. Bing Crosby helped raise funds for the building of the original stadium by arranging for his film &quot;Riding High&quot; to have its world premiere in Front Royal on April 1, 1950. Crosby&#x27;s initial involvement came about on April 30, 1948, when after acting as grand marshal of the Grand Feature Parade of the 21st. Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival in Winchester, Virginia, he went on to Front Royal where he sang on the courthouse steps as part of a concert to help raise money for a new stadium. Bing was the first contributor to the Front Royal Recreation Center Building Fund when he donated $1,000. On April 1, 1950, Front Royal celebrated &quot;Bing Crosby Day&quot; and starting at 11 a.m., Crosby led a two-hour parade through the streets in front of a crowd of 20,000 to Recreation Park for the dedication of the baseball stadium. Park Theater was the venue for the official world premiere of &quot;Riding High&quot; at 8:30 p.m. where Crosby entertained the audience with several songs. During his appearance at the Park Theater, Bing wrote out a personal check for $3,595 to bring the gross receipts of the day to $15,000.

In 1953, Frank Nesbitt coached a Little League team from Front Royal which came in 3rd in the world tournament.

<text>Abingdon is a town in and the county seat of Washington County, Virginia, United States, southwest of Roanoke. The population was 8,376 at the 2020 census. The town encompasses several historically significant sites and features a fine arts and crafts scene centered on the galleries and museums along Main Street.

Abingdon is part of the Kingsport−Bristol (TN) Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the Johnson City−Kingsport−Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area − commonly known as the Tri-Cities region.

==History==
The region was long the territory of varying cultures of indigenous peoples, including the Chisca and Xualae. From the late 17th-century, it was occupied by the Cherokee Nation, whose territory extended from the present-day area of borders of Tennessee, Virginia, and Kentucky through the spine of North Carolina and later into Georgia.

Between 1748 and 1750, Thomas Walker, a principal in the Loyal Land Company, surveyed the land where the town of Abingdon is now situated. It was on the Great Road that Colonel William Byrd III ordered cut through the wilderness on to Kingsport, Tennessee. Walker called it the Wolf Hill Tract. In the twenty-first century, the town sponsored a public art event, in which artists created 27 wolf sculptures, which were installed around the town. Most were later sold at an auction to raise money for Advance Abingdon.

Between 1765 and 1770 James Douglas, Andrew Colville, George Blackburn, Joseph Black, Samuel Briggs and James Piper settled in and around present-day Abingdon under purchases from Thomas Walker. By 1773 there were enough settlers, primarily Scots-Irish, to establish Presbyterian congregations, and the Rev. Charles Cummings became the first settled pastor west of the Allegheny Mountains.

During Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War, Joseph Black built Black&#x27;s Fort in 1774 to protect local settlers in the region from attacks by the Cherokee of the Lower Towns. It consisted of a log stockade, with a few log cabins inside, where nearby settlers took refuge in event of attack. They retreated to the fort in 1776 when attacked by the war leader Dragging Canoe and his Chickamauga Cherokee forces. Hoping to push out the colonists, the Cherokee had allied with the British in the American Revolutionary War. The settlement was known as Black&#x27;s Fort prior to being named Abingdon. Black, Briggs and Walker donated the 120 acres of land upon which the original town was laid out.

The area was at the intersection of two great Indian trails, which had followed ancient animal migration trails through the mountains. It was a prime location as a trade center and access point to the west and south. In 1776 the community of Black&#x27;s Fort was made the county seat of the newly formed Washington county. In 1778, Black&#x27;s Fort was incorporated as the town of Abingdon, said to be named for Abingdon-on-Thames the ancestral home of Martha Washington in Oxfordshire, England. Other possible namesakes for the town include Jake Dore&#x27;s home in Abington, Pennsylvania, or Lord Abingdon, friend of settler William Campbell.

With a bequest of $10,000 from salt entrepreneur William King, the Abingdon Male Academy opened in 1824. By 1830, over forty students were enrolled. It continued to thrive until 1861 when classes were suspended during the Civil War, and eventually closed in 1905. The property later became the Abingdon High School and is now home to the William King Museum of Art.

Martha Washington College, a school for women, operated in Abingdon from 1860 to 1932 in the former residence of Gen. Francis Preston which was built about 1832. Since 1935 the building has been occupied and operated as a hotel, the Martha Washington Inn. In 1867, Roman Catholics opened Villa Maria Academy of the Visitation for the education of young ladies. The Stonewall Jackson Female Institute operated from 1868 to 1930 in the former residence of Gov. John B. Floyd next to the Preston home.

The Barter Theatre, the state theatre of Virginia, was opened in Abingdon in 1933 during the Great Depression. It is now the longest-running professional equity theatre in the United States.

Abingdon is the final stop along the Virginia Creeper Trail, which allows pedestrian, cyclist and equestrian traffic. This rail-to-trail conversion is 35 miles long, extending from Whitetop Mountain through Damascus, Virginia, with the trailhead in Abingdon. The Historical Society of Washington County, Virginia, located in Abingdon, serves as a regional genealogy center, in addition to being a repository for Washington County history.

<text>Glade Spring is a town in Washington County, Virginia, United States. The population was 1,456 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Kingsport–Bristol (TN)–Bristol (VA) Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the Johnson City–Kingsport–Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area – commonly known as the &quot;Tri-Cities&quot; region. I-81 runs through Glade Spring. It is located at exit 29.

==History==
The original name of Glade Spring derives from the Indian word Passawatami which means &quot;this is the place&quot;. According to early records, near the town is a field where Native American tribes held a type of Olympics in the fall, with athletic competitions, dancing and socializing. The Porterfield family, who arrived about 1760, were some of the earliest permanent settlers.

During its first years, the town was called Glade Spring Depot to differentiate it from the community centered on Glade Spring Presbyterian Church, two miles to the southwest on the old stage road, now U.S. Route 11. The post office was moved from Old Glade to Glade Spring Depot in 1856 due to the arrival of the railroad.

The Civil War slowed its growth, and local men made up a military unit called The Glade Spring Rifles. Federal and Confederate troops passed through the town several times, and cannon emplacements can still be seen just outside Glade Spring on the road to Saltville. Although a few new buildings were constructed before the Civil War, most of the town&#x27;s growth occurred rapidly in the decade after the war.

With the railroad access, Glade Spring turned into a prime shipping yard for produce, livestock and other local goods. An Abingdon newspaper first took note of the &quot;stirring, thriving, wide-awake community&quot; in 1870. By the time Glade Spring was incorporated in 1875, there were 31 houses (three were brick), six stores, two hotels, and a Masonic Hall. Virginia Intermont College was located in Glade from 1884 to 1892, before it moved to its location until its closure in Bristol.

After the passenger train service discontinued, the town&#x27;s growth slowed, although it still receives freight service from Norfolk Southern railway. The train tracks of the 8.91 &quot;Saltville Branch&quot;, which connected to Saltville via a junction from the main line at Glade Spring, have been removed and replaced with a hiking and biking trail called the &quot;Salt Trail&quot;.

In the early morning hours of April 28, 2011, an EF-3 tornado hit parts of the Glade Spring area, killing three people and injuring 50 others. Another person died in a traffic accident during the storm. The system that hit Glade Spring was part of the 2011 Super Outbreak that caused hundreds of deaths and widespread damage all across the South.

Brook Hall and the Glade Spring Commercial Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Glade Spring is located at (36.790338, -81.773220).

<doc id="137806" wikidata="Q1110876" url="?curid=137806" title="Colonial Beach, Virginia">
<text>Colonial Beach, Virginia (CBVA) is a river and beach town located in the northwestern part of Westmoreland County on Virginia&#x27;s Northern Neck peninsula. It is bounded by the Potomac River, Monroe Bay and Monroe Creek. It is located from Washington, D.C.; from the state capital of Richmond; and 35 nautical miles from the Chesapeake Bay.

Colonial Beach was named Best Virginia Beach for 2018 by &quot;USA Today&quot;. In 2019, Colonial Beach was named The Nicest Place in Virginia and a finalist for Nicest Places in America by Reader&#x27;s Digest.

Colonial Beach was a popular resort town in the early to mid-20th century, before the Chesapeake Bay Bridge made ocean beaches on the Eastern Shore of Maryland more accessible to visitors from Washington, D.C. The family of Alexander Graham Bell maintained a summer home in Colonial Beach, the Bell House, which still stands today. Sloan Wilson, author of &quot;The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit&quot;, retired and died in Colonial Beach. George Washington, the first President of the United States, was born near here at what is now the George Washington Birthplace National Monument. , the James Monroe Family Home Site, birthplace of President James Monroe, now has a replica of his birthplace.

==History==
Judging by excavations done on oyster pits, it would seem that Native Americans have inhabited the area of modern-day Colonial Beach since at least the Early Woodland Period (500 B.C.- A.D. 900).

The town area now known as ‘The Point’ was originally patented by John Lancelott and S. Lancelott [Odyer and Sturman Escheat] on October 29, 1651.

Colonial Beach emerged as a bathing and fishing resort in the late 19th century known as the &quot;Playground on the Potomac.&quot; Prior to automobile travel, most visitors arrived by boat from Washington, D.C.

The town was incorporated on February 25, 1892, and there was extensive construction of houses, summer cottages, and hotels. Arguably the most famous of these structures is the Bell House, built for Alexander Graham Bell as a summer home, which still stands today on Irving Avenue.

The area was at the center of the Potomac River Oyster Wars between Virginia watermen and the Maryland State Oyster Police that lasted from the late 19th century to the 1960s.

The town began to gradually decline as the automobile made travel to more distant ocean beaches more feasible. However, because gambling was legal in Maryland and the Maryland state line ends at the low-water mark of Virginia&#x27;s Potomac River shore, from 1949 to 1958, Colonial Beach offered slot machines in pier casinos extending into Maryland waters. This temporarily revitalized the town, although it was sometimes called &quot;the poor man&#x27;s Las Vegas.&quot; However, the piers burned in the 1960s in a devastating fire and the town continued to decline. 
The town is ranked fifth-safest place to live in Virginia by Safewise.

==Geography==
Colonial Beach is located at (38.253840, −76.968941), in the northwestern part of Westmoreland County in Virginia&#x27;s Northern Neck, from Washington, D.C., and from the state capital Richmond.

The Potomac River forms the northeast boundary of Colonial Beach. The southern part of the town forms a peninsula which ends just above Monroe Bay and divides Monroe Creek from the Potomac River. A short distance north of Colonial Beach is the community of Potomac Beach and the mouth of Rosier Creek. Inland from Colonial Beach lie the settlements of Monroe Hall, near the birthplace of President James Monroe, and Maple Grove.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (8.80%) is water. The town&#x27;s of beaches are second in length only to those of Virginia Beach in the Commonwealth of Virginia.

===Climate===

<doc id="137808" wikidata="Q1375253" url="?curid=137808" title="Appalachia, Virginia">
<text>Appalachia () is a town in Wise County, Virginia, United States. The population was 1,754 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The Appalachia post office was established in 1898. The community was named for the surrounding Appalachian Mountains. The Derby Historic District, Kelly View School, and Stonega Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Appalachia was formerly home to three railroad companies. The &quot;big three&quot; were the Southern Railway, Louisville &amp; Nashville, and the Interstate Railroad. As of 2022, the Norfolk Southern Railroad is the only operating line through Appalachia, hauling only coal and the occasional ammonium nitrate and limestone aggregate product. These hoppers can be easily identified behind Main Street with the markings of the former railroads painted on the ribbed sides, most reading &quot;Southern&quot; and some &quot;Norfolk &amp; Western&quot;.

In 2006, fourteen Appalachia residents, including mayor Ben Cooper and the police chief, were indicted on charges relating to an electoral fraud conspiracy. Cooper was convicted of intercepting absentee ballots and changing the votes on them; buying votes with beer, cigarettes, and pork rinds; and conspiring with his appointee, the police chief, to steal money and other items from residents, among 243 felony charges. Ten other conspirators pleaded guilty and received fines or short jail sentences.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 2.3 square miles (6.0 km2), all of it land.

Appalachia is surrounded by numerous coal camp communities, including Andover, Arno, Derby, Imboden, Exeter, Dunbar, Pardee, Osaka, Roda, and Stonega. Many of these communities formed at the beginning of the 20th-century with the arrival of the mining and railroad industry.

==Demographics==

<text>Big Stone Gap is a town in Wise County, Virginia, United States. The town was economically centered around the coal industry for much of its early development. The population was 5,254 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The community was formerly known as &quot;Mineral City&quot; and &quot;Three Forks&quot; before officially taking its name in 1888. The &quot;Big Stone Gap&quot; refers to the valley created on the Appalachia Straight, located between the town and Appalachia. The town served as an important center for coal and iron development in the 1880s and 1890s and residents hoped its coal and iron ore deposits would make it &quot;the Pittsburgh of the South.&quot;

The Big Stone Gap post office was established in 1856. The Christ Episcopal Church, John Fox, Jr. House, Southwest Virginia Museum Historical State Park, Terrace Park Girl Scout Cabin, June Tolliver House, and C. Bascom Slemp Federal Building are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In October 1978, John W. Warner, then the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate from Virginia, and his wife, British-American actress Elizabeth Taylor, stopped in Big Stone Gap to campaign for his upcoming election. At Fraley&#x27;s Coach House, a local diner where they were each meeting with voters, Taylor choked on a chicken bone in her esophagus and was transported to the nearby Lonesome Pine Regional Hospital. Taylor recovered from the event and later sent a donation to the hospital as a thank you.

In 2014, the American drama romantic comedy film &quot;Big Stone Gap&quot;, written and directed by Big Stone Gap native Adriana Trigiani and produced by Donna Gigliotti, began filming in the town. The film starred Ashley Judd, Patrick Wilson, Whoopi Goldberg, and others, including local talent for many of the background extras in larger scenes. The movie was based on Trigiani&#x27;s 2000 novel of the same name and was produced on a $3.5-million budget. The film premiered at the Virginia Film Festival on November 6, 2014, and expanded to a wider release of over 100 theaters in 2015.

The Southwest Virginia Museum Historical State Park is located in the downtown area in the former home of C. Bascom Slemp. Construction of the building was completed in 1895 and purchased by Slemp in 1929. Before his death in 1943, Slemp established the C. Bascom Slemp Foundation and hoped to see the house turned into a museum. In 1946 the state of Virginia acquired the home, and the Slemp Foundation donated the initial collection from Slemp&#x27;s personal belongings.

Big Stone Gap also hosts the Meador Coal Museum. Meador, to whom the museum is dedicated, collected many of the objects displayed in the museum from his time with the Westmoreland Coal Company during the first half of the 20th century. The museum was dedicated in 1982 after his death.

<doc id="137811" wikidata="Q1373766" url="?curid=137811" title="Pound, Virginia">
<text>Pound is a town in Wise County, Virginia, United States. The population was recorded as 1,037 in the 2010 United States Census.

==History==
The Pound area was explored in 1751 by Christopher Gist, and it is traditionally said to be the oldest settlement in Wise County. Also known as &quot;The Pound,&quot; the name may derive from a family name, or from a pounding mill built in the area in 1815. The county&#x27;s first post office was established there in 1848. Pound was not incorporated until 1950, the last town in Wise County to do so.

Historically, the town&#x27;s economy benefited from the area&#x27;s coal mining industry. In the 1940s, the town had nearly a dozen bars catering to miners from nearby Kentucky. As mining declined in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, Pound—like much of Southwest Virginia—saw its economy and tax base collapse. Over the following decades, fiscal and political difficulties led the Virginia General Assembly to pass a law in 2022 that would revoke the town&#x27;s charter in 2023 unless improvements were made. Its charter was restored on February 2, 2023.

The Flat Gap High School and Sunnydale Farm are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

=== Notable crimes ===
On November 30, 1927, Leonard Woods, a black coal miner and resident of Jenkins, Kentucky, was lynched on the Virginia-Kentucky border in Pound. Woods had been jailed in Kentucky for the murder of 29-year-old Herschel Deaton of Coeburn, Virginia, following an altercation on November 27. On the night of the lynching, a crowd estimated between 400-500 surrounded the Kentucky jail Woods was held in and demanded he be released to their custody. The crowd then transported Woods to a wooden structure located in Pound adjacent to the recently constructed US 23 highway. By this time the mob, estimated at 1,500, oversaw the hanging of Woods, followed by the firing of over 500 shots at his body, according to a local reporter. Both Virginia and Kentucky authorities claimed they were not responsible for investigating the crime, and no one was prosecuted for the death of Leonard Woods.

In 1935, Pound gained national attention for the case of Edith Maxwell, who was convicted in 1935 of murdering her father, Trigg Maxwell. She was pardoned in 1941 after appeals from Eleanor Roosevelt and the &quot;Washington Post&quot; raised funds for her legal defense.

==Geography==
Pound is located at (37.123820, -82.607859).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 2.6 square miles (6.8 km), all land.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. The Köppen Climate System describes the weather as humid subtropical, and uses the abbreviation &quot;Cfa&quot;.

==Demographics==

At the 2000 census there were 1,089 people, 455 households and 322 families in the town. The population density was 417.6 per square mile (161.1/km). There were 516 housing units at an average density of 197.9 per square mile (76.3/km). The racial makeup of the town was 98.71% White, 0.09% Native American, 0.09% from other races, and 1.10% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.18%.

Of the 455 households 31.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 52.5% were married couples living together, 15.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.2% were non-families. 25.9% of households were one person and 14.3% were one person aged 65 or older. The average household size was 2.39 and the average family size was 2.88.

The age distribution was 24.0% under the age of 18, 8.8% from 18 to 24, 29.8% from 25 to 44, 21.5% from 45 to 64, and 16.0% 65 or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females there were 87.8 males. For every 100 females aged 18 and over, there were 80.8 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $29,107, and the median family income was $33,688. Males had a median income of $32,065 versus $22,143 for females. The per capita income for the town was $14,375. About 19.4% of families and 23.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 37.9% of those under age 18 and 9.8% of those age 65 or over.

==Government==
The town is governed by an elected mayor and council. It employs a paid town manager, who has often been the same person as the mayor.

The town council adopted an ordinance forbidding dancing without a permit (Section 127-138). When the town turned down a dance application, the ordinance was challenged and overturned by the federal District Court in 1999 as &quot;unconstitutional on its face&quot;, 18 years after ordinance was created.

In the 2020s, financial and political issues plagued the town government. The town failed to pass a budget by its deadline, closed its police department, and was required by the state government to turn over its wastewater treatment facility to Wise County. Resignations and attendance problems deprived the town council of a quorum, resulting in a judge appointing replacement members. In 2021, the county board of supervisors requested that the Virginia General Assembly revoke the town&#x27;s charter. In 2022, the General Assembly passed, and the Governor signed into law, a bill to revoke the charter without a local referendum, as of November 1, 2023, unless the town government sufficiently improved before then. On February 2, 2023, the General Assembly passed, and the Governor signed into law, a bill to restore the town&#x27;s charter.

==Education==

Pound has one public school: James Woodrow Adams Combined School.

<text>Fort Chiswell is a census-designated place (CDP) in Wythe County, Virginia, United States. The population was 939 at the 2010 census.

Fort Chiswell is located at the junction of Interstates 77 and 81. Going west from Fort Chiswell, drivers find themselves on a double wrong-way concurrency - one of few in the nation. Interstate 77 northbound is overlapped with Interstate 81 southbound, drivers will find themselves oriented the right way again when exiting I-81 back to I-77 north towards Charleston or south to Charlotte.

==History==
The community name is derived from a frontier fort built in 1758 as an outpost during the French and Indian War. The fort, which was of strategic importance during the American Revolution as the guardpost over a small deposit of lead used to mold bullets, was situated at the junction of the Great Trading Path and the Richmond Road, near the New River. The fort fell into disrepair in the 18th century as both the county seat and courthouse were moved from Fort Chiswell to the county seat of Wytheville, 12 miles to the west. The remaining foundations of the Fort and its surrounding buildings were completely covered over during the construction of I-77 in Wythe County during the 1970s. There is a pyramid shaped historical marker of sandstone situated approximately 200 yards west-northwest of the fort&#x27;s original location.

The Fort Chiswell Site, The Mansion at Fort Chiswell, and McGavock Family Cemetery are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Schools==
Fort Chiswell has a few different forms of both private and public schools, however there is only one private school in the town, which is named &#x27;Kiddy Centre&#x27; which only allows for pre-school and daycare education. The public sector has two schools including the Fort Chiswell Middle School (FCMS) and the Fort Chiswell High school (FCHS) which have been merged into one secular school building.

<text>Wytheville ( ) is a town in, and the county seat of, Wythe County, Virginia, United States. It is named after George Wythe, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence and mentor to Thomas Jefferson. Wytheville&#x27;s population was 8,264 at the 2020 census. Interstate Highways 77 and 81 were constructed to intersect at the town.

During the American Civil War, Wytheville had a strategic importance. It was attacked in 1863 (Toland&#x27;s Raid) and 1865 (Stoneman&#x27;s 1865 Raid). The town is the birthplace of Edith Bolling Wilson, second wife of President Woodrow Wilson.

==History==

Wythe County was created in 1789 and named for George Wythe, the &quot;father of American Jurisprudence&quot; and signer of the Declaration of Independence. In May 1790, Chris Simmerman donated 85 acres, Robert Williams II donated 50 acres, and John Davis donated 10 acres to establish a town and county seat. Robert Adams completed a town survey in November of that year, dividing the area into half-acre lots. The town did not have an official name yet, but was generally known as Wythe Court House.

Two years later, in October 1792, the town was officially named Evansham, for prominent local citizen Jesse Evans. After a disastrous fire in March 1839, the town was renamed Wytheville. At that time, it was home to about 500 residents.

===Lynching of Raymond Byrd===

In 1926, the last documented lynching in Virginia took place here, when Raymond Byrd, an African-American man, was murdered by a large group of masked and costumed men while under arrest in the local jail. Byrd was accused of raping or assaulting the three white daughters of Grover Grubb, his employer. The two older sisters, both of whom bore Byrd&#x27;s children, were of age and revealed that the relationship was consensual and thus did not constitute a crime. He was, however, eventually arrested on the accusation that he assaulted the minor daughter. Byrd was shot and killed by the mob while he was in his jail cell. Then his dead body was dragged a few miles behind a truck, placed in the boot of a car, and then hanged from a tree on Charley Brown&#x27;s land near St. Paul Lutheran Church. The event provoked outrage and national coverage by newspapers.

Byrd&#x27;s death was a catalyst for Virginia&#x27;s passing an anti-lynching law in 1928, largely because of a campaign led by Louis I. Jaffé, editor of the &quot;Norfolk Virginian-Pilot&quot;. It was supported by Governor Harry Flood Byrd Sr., who linked the bill to his efforts to attract new businesses to the state.

===Polio epidemic===
A few cases of polio during the summer of 1950 swelled into an epidemic of hundreds. It was known to cause infantile and even adult paralysis. Of the 5,513 inhabitants of the town, 184 people contracted the disease, resulting in 17 fatalities. From the beginning of June until the end of August, parents kept children inside, and large gatherings were cancelled to diminish the chance of infection.

As the epidemic progressed, ambulances drove victims approximately to Memorial Crippled Children&#x27;s Hospital in Roanoke, Virginia. Hearses from local funeral homes were used when ambulances were unavailable. African-American patients with polio were repeatedly denied admission to Roanoke&#x27;s hospital and were forced to drive approximately to St. Philip&#x27;s Hospital in Richmond, the closest hospital to serve blacks.

The Town Council erected billboards at all five entrances to the county, warning potential visitors of the epidemic and urging tourists to return the following year. By the end of the summer, all five billboards were stolen or demolished. Though the Town Council offered a reward for information, no one came forward.

===Historic sites===
The Crockett&#x27;s Cove Presbyterian Church, Haller-Gibboney Rock House, Loretto, St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, St. John&#x27;s Lutheran Church and Cemetery, Wythe County Poorhouse Farm, and Wytheville Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="137817" wikidata="Q938699" url="?curid=137817" title="Yorktown, Virginia">
<text>Yorktown is a town in York County, Virginia. It is the county seat of York County, one of the eight original shires formed in colonial Virginia in 1682. Yorktown&#x27;s population was 195 as of the 2010 census, while York County&#x27;s population was 66,134 in the 2011 census estimate.

The town is most famous as the site of the siege and subsequent surrender of General Charles Cornwallis to General George Washington and the French Fleet during the American Revolutionary War on October 19, 1781. Although the war would last for another year, this British defeat at Yorktown effectively ended the war in North America. Yorktown also figured prominently in the American Civil War (1861–1865), serving as a major port to supply both northern and southern towns, depending upon who held Yorktown at the time.

Yorktown is one of three sites of the Historic Triangle, which also includes Jamestown and Williamsburg as important colonial-era settlements. It is the eastern terminus of the Colonial Parkway connecting these locations. Yorktown is also the eastern terminus of the TransAmerica Trail, a bicycle touring route created by the Adventure Cycling Association.

One of Yorktown&#x27;s historic sister cities is Zweibrücken in Germany, based on participation of a unit from there during the American Revolutionary War.

==History==

Yorktown was named for the ancient city of York in Yorkshire, Northern England. It was founded in 1691 as a port on the York River for English colonists to export tobacco to Europe. The lawyer Thomas Ballard was the principal founder of the city along with Joseph Ring. It became the county seat in 1696, and although it never had more than about 200 houses its trade was considerable until the American Revolutionary War. It was called &quot;York&quot; until after the war, when the name &quot;Yorktown&quot; came into common use.

The town reached the height of its development around 1750, when it had 250 to 300 buildings and a population of almost 2,000 people. It was the base of British General Charles Cornwallis during the 1781 siege, which was the last major battle of the American Revolutionary War.

When waterways were critical to transportation, Yorktown was thought to occupy a strategic location controlling upstream portions of the York River and its tributaries and their access to the Chesapeake Bay. In his &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot; published in 1781–82, Thomas Jefferson noted that the York River at Yorktown &quot;affords the best harbour in the state for vessels of the largest size. The river there narrows to the width of a mile, and is contained within very high banks, close under which the vessels may ride.&quot;

The population dropped in Yorktown and other areas of the mostly rural peninsula after the state&#x27;s capital was relocated from Williamsburg to Richmond on the James River, attracting more development there. In addition, tobacco exhausted the soil, and planters shifted to mixed crops, which required less slave labor. Many generations of younger sons migrated out of the Tidewater area to new lands further west, into the Piedmont and beyond to Kentucky, Tennessee and what became the Northwest Territory.

During the 1862 Peninsula Campaign of the American Civil War (1861–1865), the town was captured by the Union following the Siege and Battle of Yorktown. It was used as a base by the Union Army of the Potomac under General George B. McClellan to launch an attack on Richmond.

One of Yorktown&#x27;s sister cities is Zweibrücken, Germany. During the American Revolutionary War, the Royal Deux-Ponts Regiment was commanded by Comte Christian de Forbach (son of Christian IV, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken, and the deputy commander was his brother Philippe Guillaume (later renamed to Wilhelm). This was one of the four regiments that arrived at Newport, Rhode Island with Rochambeau in 1780. It participated on the side of Americans in the Battle of Yorktown in 1781.

Yorktown&#x27;s other sister city is Port-Vendres, France. It&#x27;s from this small port on the Mediterranean coast that the French expeditionary force left Europe to fight the British army in America.

During World War I, to support Atlantic defenses, the federal government in 1918 acquired about for development by the US Navy as Mine Depot, Yorktown. This large installation straddled York, Warwick and James City counties. It has since expanded and been developed as Naval Weapons Station Yorktown. Cheatham Annex, a facility which was developed over the former town of Penniman, is also included as part of the base.

Training Center Yorktown serves as a training school for the United States Coast Guard. Also relatively close to Yorktown are Camp Peary (in York County), the Huntington Ingalls Industries Newport News Shipbuilding yards and facilities, and Fort Eustis Army base (both in Newport News). Other major installations in the area are Naval Station Norfolk, located at Norfolk, and Langley Air Force Base in Hampton.

==Description==

In the early 21st century, Yorktown is popular as a destination for heritage tourism. Yorktown Village or Historic Yorktown is located close to the York River near the George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge that spans the river to Gloucester Point. Historic Yorktown is comprised first of Water Street, a small strip along the beach of the river; it contains several small restaurants, a park, a hotel, a pier, and an antiques shop. In May 2005 a building was constructed with more shops and restaurants, enhancing what is known as the &quot;Riverwalk&quot; section on the waterfront.

Next, Main Street is located on a bluff above the floodplain. Architecture in this area is almost exclusively original to the colonial era. Nine buildings, including the circa-1730 Nelson House and Somerwell House (see photo), survive from the pre-Revolutionary period. The old court house, several small shops, the Nelson House, and the Yorktown Monument are located along this road. Around the center of the town are residential streets. Grace Episcopal Church, situated on Church Street near the old courthouse, is noted for its architecture.

==Honors==

Yorktown and the nearby area are significant to the early history of the United States. Colonial National Historical Park, which contains and preserves Yorktown National Battlefield and Yorktown National Cemetery, is located on the outskirts of town. The battlefield has many of the earthworks dug by the besieging American and French forces.

The Yorktown Victory Monument, commemorating the victory, the alliance with France that brought it about, and the resulting peace with Great Britain after the war, is located just outside the current town. Designed by New York City architect Richard Morris Hunt, the monument was installed in 1884 and topped by a figure of Liberty sculpted by John Quincy Adams Ward. That element was destroyed by lightning in 1942. It was replaced in 1957 by a figure of Victory by Oskar J. W. Hansen. A memorial to the French war dead of the Yorktown campaign is being planned for construction at the French cemetery on the site of the battle.

==Transportation==
U.S. Route 17, also known as George Washington Memorial Highway, is the primary thoroughfare of Yorktown. It carries traffic via the George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge across the York River. York County has grown rapidly, and since the late 20th century, the stretch of U.S. 17 that passes through this area has become a heavily traveled route on which numerous strip malls and commercial areas have been developed. Many of the residential areas of York County branch off Route 17 or are near Interstate 64. Little of the recent residential or business development of York County has occurred close to Yorktown. It is being protected and managed as a historical colonial village, much like Williamsburg, under the guidance of the National Park Service.

Yorktown is directly accessible via Colonial Parkway, a two-line, commercial vehicle-free highway that connects with Williamsburg, Jamestown, State Route 199, U.S. Route 60 and Interstate 64. The closest city, Williamsburg, is a 20-minute ride from Yorktown.

<text>Hatton is a small incorporated town in Adams County, Washington, United States. The population was 79 at the 2020 census.

==History==
When the Northern Pacific Railway built its line through Adams County, they established a station where Hatton is and built a section and pump house. Prior to 1890, the station was named Twin Wells after the two wells that were drilled to water the railroad employees. In 1890, James Bronson established the first store and at the same time the post office was established with the name &quot;Hatton&quot;. The name for the town was derived from the last names of the first postmistress, Belle Su&quot;tton&quot;, daughter of a local settler, and her new husband John &quot;Ha&quot;ckett, a Northern Pacific Railway agent from Twin Falls, Idaho. Bronson&#x27;s store was purchased by Otis Algoe in 1897 who subsequently became postmaster.

Hatton finally began to grow after 1901 and was platted on April 30, 1901 by James Bronson. By that time the town had four large warehouses, five stores, two hotels, a bank and a school. A newspaper, &quot;The Hatton Hustler&quot; was established during that time. Hatton was officially incorporated on July 31, 1907.

Hatton is located within the region of Washington known as the Channeled Scablands and is situated on the west slope of the Providence Coulee with the Paradise Flats to the west and the Michigan Prairie to the east.

U.S. Route 395 passes just to the east of the town site, connecting the town with Interstate 90 at Ritzville in the northeast and Interstate 82 at the Tri-Cities to the southwest.

<doc id="137819" wikidata="Q1506345" url="?curid=137819" title="Lind, Washington">
<text>Lind is a town in Adams County, Washington, United States. The population was 535 at the 2020 census, a 5.1% decrease over the preceding census.

==History==
Lind was first settled in 1888 on a relatively barren area along the Northern Pacific Railway&#x27;s main line by the Neilson Brothers, James and Dugal. The site had previously been selected in 1881 for a station (an old boxcar) and section house and was named Lind by the railroad although the exact origin of that name has been lost. In the autumn of 1888 the Neilson Brothers built the first Lind residence and two years later they built and stocked a store and resumed postal service which until then had been processed in Ritzville and tossed off in town by passing trains. James Neilson became the first postmaster. The first school opened in 1889 with six students in attendance. The Neilson Brothers platted the town site on June 7, 1890, which consisted of only four square blocks. The Panic of 1893 would stave off any further development of the town site until the turn of the century.

By 1899 the panic was starting to wear off and the local wheat crop, of high quality, was growing in demand. Lind began to expand in size. A new post office and saloon were built and a lumber yard was started and by the end of the year, the population was nearing 100. By the end of 1901, several brick buildings were being constructed for a bank and other stores and hundreds of temporary dwellings were constructed by settlers. A new school and three churches were built. Between 1898 and 1903, Lind grew immensely to a population of about 600 and saw the opening of many more stores, restaurants, a second bank, real estate offices and a newspaper, &quot;The Lind Leader&quot;. Lind was incorporated on January 26, 1902. Dugal Neilson was elected mayor while his brother James was elected treasurer.

The Milwaukee Road would later lay its tracks through the south side of town, which is now the John Wayne Pioneer Trail.

When the Neilson brothers platted the town site of Lind, they named all of the north to south streets to eventually spell out their surname. The town only grew large enough to spell &quot;Neilso&quot;.

The local Jr./Sr. High School has changed mascots many times some of which are Lind Bulldogs, Lind-Kahlotus Blue Devils, Lind-Ritzville Broncos, and the current Lind-Ritzville-Sprague Broncos which is classified as a 2B school according to the WIAA. Old time rival the Rearden Indians has been kept, but due to the great success with the local football program, it has been the very challenging Colfax Bulldogs. Also, due to state funding, the local high school will move to the nearby town of Ritzville, WA. The middle school remains at Lind as same with Ritzville.

On August 4, 2022, the entire town was ordered to evacuate due to an approaching wildfire, which destroyed 10 homes. Local highways were also shut down while firefighters moved into the area to control the wildfire.

==Geography==

As the highway turns north, Lind - Hatton and Lind - Warden Roads branch off to the west.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.

<doc id="137821" wikidata="Q1510263" url="?curid=137821" title="Othello, Washington">
<text>Othello () is a city in Adams County, Washington, United States. The population was 8,549 at the 2020 census, a 16 percent increase from 2010. It is located in the heart of the Columbia Basin Project, approximately southwest of Spokane. The city is south of Interstate 90 in Moses Lake and is connected by State Route 17 and State Route 26.

==History==

The first white settlers in the area were two brothers, Ben and Sam Hutchinson, who built a cabin along the Crab Creek in 1884. An influx of homesteaders began after the start of the 20th century, and a post office was established in 1904. The post office was named Othello in a public contest after a post office also called Othello in Roane County, Tennessee.

The Chicago, Milwaukee, &amp; St. Paul Railroad ran a track through Adams County in 1907. In 1912, a hotel was built for the railroad workers. That hotel would be later known as the Old Hotel and Art Gallery. The railroad officially platted the town as a stop, with water to feed the boilers of steam trains. They kept the name Othello and built a railyard and wooden roundhouse there. Although the roundhouse burned in 1919, it was replaced with a brick structure that lasted many years. Businesses and settlers continued to follow, and the town was incorporated on May 31, 1910. At the time the railroad was the eastern terminus of the second electrified district of the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s &quot;Pacific Extension&quot; route, which extended up to Tacoma, Washington. The railroad was abandoned in 1980 following the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s bankruptcy.

The Bureau of Reclamation located offices in Othello in 1947, which prevented the decline of this town with the decline of rail shipping after World War II. In the early 1950s, the Columbia Basin Project brought irrigation to the Othello area, increasing both agriculture and commerce. Prior to this, water came only from Crab Creek and from local wells. The water arrived via the Potholes East Canal between Billy Clapp Lake and Scootenay Reservoir in Franklin County. Once there was irrigation available, a land drawing was held in Othello. On May 31, 1952, 42 names were drawn (of more than 7000 submitted) for the privilege of purchasing this newly desirable acreage.

From 1951 to 1973, the 637th Radar Squadron operated the Othello Radar Station near the town. In 1958, an ice plant was opened in town to service railroad cars moving produce. Frozen food packaging came to town in the early 1960s, and has since become the main industry.

Since 1998, Othello has also been home to the Sandhill Crane Festival, celebrating the annual arrival of sandhill cranes to the nearby Columbia National Wildlife Refuge.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Othello has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps.

==Economy==

In addition to agricultural output, Othello has several food processing and cold storage companies, especially for potatoes. The local area processes approximately of frozen potato products annually, comprising 15 percent of production in North America. More than 700 jobs in Othello are tied to potato processing, including at McCain Foods and J. R. Simplot facilities. The agricultural economy is threatened by an increasing shortage of water.

==Demographics==
Since the 1980s, Othello has become a destination for immigrants from Latin America who arrive as migrant workers or for seasonal farm jobs.

<text>Ritzville () is a city in Adams County, Washington, United States. The population was 1,767 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Adams County. The city is part of the Othello, WA Micropolitan Area, which comprises all of Adams County, and is part of the larger Moses Lake-Othello, WA Combined Statistical Area.

==History==

The first settler in what would become modern Ritzville was William McKay in 1880. The town would be named after Phillip Ritz, who had settled nearby two years earlier. By December 1880, Ritzville&#x27;s town-site had been platted by John W. Sprague on behalf of his company, The Northern Pacific Railway. In 1881, McKay built the first house on the townsite. The Northern Pacific grade was under construction in the vicinity and McKay&#x27;s home was used as a makeshift hotel for the workers and associated transients.

With the railroad came a new wave of settlers to the area. In the summer of 1881, McKay erected the first store and the railroad built a depot nearby, which also served as a hotel, theater and meeting hall. At that time the fledgeling village had a population of around 50 and the school consisted of a lean-to against a house. The town&#x27;s water supply was the railroad tank because it was not thought that water could be found in the ground. The first religious services were held in Adams County in Ritzville in April 1882 at the McKay Home and the First Congregational Church was soon organized, a church would be built in 1885. The post office was established in 1883 by J.L. Johnson of Walla Walla who also purchased McKay&#x27;s store. Soon afterwards, many more businesses would set up shop in town. As the 1880s wore on, the town was beginning to realize its position as a major wheat shipping point in the Big Bend Country and it continued to grow.

When the town&#x27;s water supply from the railroad tank began to stretch thin, a search for underground water was initiated. At first, no water was found but a well was finally struck east of the town-site. Most of the land-owners in town agreed to move towards the well, with the exception of a large hotel which couldn&#x27;t be moved. Water was eventually found at the site and the town was allowed to stay where it was. By 1887, Ritzville had three general merchandise stores, one drug store, one saloon, two blacksmith shops, two lumber yards, two livery stables, one harness shop, two hotels and a large, two-story wooden schoolhouse with an attendance of 100.

On June 6, 1888, a fire caused by a defective flue wiped out nearly all of the business section of town. Ritzville had no fire department at the time and its citizens were unable to combat the flames effectively. Rebuilding got underway quickly resulting in the town&#x27;s first brick building in 1889 built by the town&#x27;s first mayor, N.H. Greene. It still stands and is currently part of the Ritzville Historic District.

Following the rebuilding from the fire, Ritzville was incorporated as a town in 1888 and was officially re-incorporated as a city on July 17, 1890 after Washington became a state. The first banking institution, The Adams County Bank (later First National Bank) would follow in April 1891. After another downtown fire in 1894, a waterworks system was installed at a cost of $20,000. The first permanent Adams County courthouse was also built in 1892.

After the panic of 1893 had subsided in 1898, Ritzville was experiencing another boom, with demand for property rising and scores of buildings being built. Telephone service was established in August 1899. By the turn of the century, the population had exceeded 1,200. The town finally received a volunteer fire department in 1901, with equipment funded by the citizens. Also in 1901, Ritzville received the title of the greatest wheat shipping point in the world. Between August of that year and August 1902, approximately 1,967,725 bushels of wheat were received in Ritzville warehouses for shipment and 1,990 rail cars of wheat and flour were billed out. These numbers would only be exceeded in 1902. On January 17, 1902, Ritzville was electrified for the first time, run by a steam-powered dynamo. The Chamber of Commerce was formed in 1903 and the following year the courthouse was doubled in size. The city received a Carnegie Library in 1907, the only one in Adams County. It still serves as the town&#x27;s library today.

By the time of The Great Depression, growth had slowed and Ritzville settled in as a small town. In the 1960s, Interstate 90 was constructed around the south-end of town, replacing U.S. Route 10 and re-routing U.S. Route 395 and its traffic away from downtown. The town&#x27;s arrested development from then on preserved it and formed the core of the designated Ritzville Historic District in 1990.

<text>Washtucna () is a town in Adams County, Washington, United States. The population was 211 at the 2020 census, a 1% increase over the previous census. The town was named for a lake 12 miles from the town in Franklin County which was in turn named after a Palouse Native American chief.

==History==
George Bassett, an Iowan settler homesteaded the future site of Washtucna in 1878 with his wife Alice Lancaster Bassett. Their goal was to raise horses, and until 1900 their ranch was the site of an annual roundup of wild horses. In 1882, the first Post Office in Adams County was established with Bassett as postmaster. The post office was taken over by T.C. Martin in 1894 who then opened the first store in Washtucna. The town was named after a leader of the Palouse people who was purportedly called &quot;Washtucna.&quot;

The first rail line into the area was completed by the Oregon Improvement Company in 1886, and shipped 30,000 bushels of wheat in its first five years. Several attempts at large-scale irrigation projects were attempted between 1892 and 1917, but all failed. Dry land wheat farming has persisted since that time.

Washtucna was officially incorporated on October 27, 1903, with Charles T. Booth as the first mayor.

During the early 2000s recession, Washtucna faced a potential budget shortfall due to reduced state subsidies and poor wheat sales.

==Geography==
Washtucna sits at the head of Washtucna Coulee, a thin but deep valley that runs west to Connell, Washington where it merges with Providence Coulee to form Esquatzel Coulee. Being located on the floor of the coulee, Washtucna is at relatively lower elevation than the terrain that surrounds it. The floor of the coulee at Washtucna is roughy 1,027 feet above sea level, but the steep walls of the coulee quickly rise to 1,600 feet above sea level in places within a mile of the city center.

Washtucna is located at the intersection of State Routes 26 and 261; about west of Pullman, Washington, southwest of Spokane, Washington, and east of Seattle, Washington. The Columbia Plateau Trail passes through Washtucna as well.

The Palouse River currently passes within a couple of miles to the east of Washtucna, but in geological history the river previously flowed through Washtucna down Washtucna Coulee. The river eventually changed into its present-day course, abandoning the coulee. During the Missoula Floods, the former riverbed saw water once more as flood waters scoured their way through its channel. That history gives the Washtucna area features that are representative of both the Channeled Scablands region which extends to the north and west and the Palouse which extends to the south and east.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.

<text>Prosser () is a city in and the county seat of Benton County, Washington, United States. Situated along the Yakima River, it had a population of 6,062 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Prosser was long home to Native Americans who lived and fished along the river. They called the area &quot;Táptat&quot; (alternatively spelled Tap-tat, Top tut, etc.), which translates to &quot;long hair in front, short hair on the sides&quot;, referring to a style of headdress.

Colonel William Farrand Prosser first surveyed the area in 1879, then claimed homestead in 1882. The Northern Pacific Railroad laid tracks through the area two years later. A town plat was filed by Colonel Prosser in 1885, and in 1886 he was elected Yakima County Auditor. He moved to North Yakima to attend to these duties, and never returned to the town that he founded.

Lewis Hinzerling built a flour mill at Prosser falls in 1887, encouraging further settlement of the area. The first irrigation canal was completed in 1893 by the Prosser Falls Land and Irrigation Company. Prosser was officially incorporated in 1899 with a population of 229 people.

In 1905, Benton County was carved out of the eastern portions of Yakima and Klickitat Counties. The new town of Prosser was chosen as county seat. In 1907 a power plant was added and began delivering electricity to the town. The following year, a new high school was built, followed a year later by a telephone exchange. In 1910 the city received a grant from Andrew Carnegie for a public library.

Throughout the 1910s and 1920s various companies drilled in this area for oil and natural gas. There were no large findings and the Great Depression put an end to exploration.

On November 5, 1912, Benton County voters held a referendum to move the county seat from Prosser to either Kennewick or Benton City. Intense rivalry and war of words between Benton City, Kennewick, and Prosser preceded the vote. Despite getting a majority of the vote, Kennewick did not receive 60 percent of the vote as required by law. To date, Prosser remains the county seat.

In 1919, Washington State College (later WSU) established the Irrigation Experiment Station at Prosser. The program&#x27;s mandate is to study the problems faced by farmers, orchardists, and ranchers in the dry central part of the state. The station originally employed scientists from the college in Pullman, who partnered with scientists from the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The station is still currently in use, and offers a number of agricultural education programs.

Prosser at one point had three newspapers, which were consolidated in the 1920s into the Prosser &quot;Record-Bulletin&quot;, and a permanent courthouse was built in 1926. The Benton County Historical Museum was dedicated in 1968.

In more recent years, Prosser&#x27;s location on a major river (the Yakima) and highway access has encouraged a growing wine business and associated tourist industry. Several Prosser wineries are located within the Yakima Valley appellation.

<text>West Richland is a city in Benton County, Washington. The population was 16,295 at the time of the 2020 census. The city is part of the Tri-Cities metropolitan area, whose principal cities (the Tri-Cities) are Richland, Kennewick, and Pasco.

==History==

The original people of the region were the Chemnapum Indians (closely related to the Wanapum tribe), living near the mouth of the Yakima River. Lewis and Clark passed through the area in 1805, and an expedition of the Army Corps of Topographical Engineers headed by Robert E Johnson mapped the Yakima Valley in 1841. 

In 1853, a road was authorized by Congress to pass through the Yakima Valley, and passed through present-day West Richland; however, settlement did not properly begin until the late 1870s. The first schoolhouse was built in 1896 on the Van Horn Property just south of what is now Van Giesen Street. Benton County was created in 1905, Richland was incorporated in 1906, and the West Richland area was known as &#x27;Lower Yakima&#x27;. 

An irrigation canal from the north side of Horn Rapids Dam was built in 1908 to bring water into Richland. 

The Yellowstone Trail, a national highway stretching from Albany, New York, to Seattle, was located through the Yakima Valley in 1917 and 1918. It crossed the Fallon Bridge between Richland and West Richland and then proceeded directly west to Kiona. 

During the 1940s, the city of Richland was built, run and maintained by the War Department for the duration of the Manhattan Project. A number of residents had chafed at the government&#x27;s regulations, and as a result many of them had moved across the Yakima River, where it was possible to purchase land and own (rather than rent) a house. 

Carl Heminger purchased some in 1948, and laid out plans for a city. It was proposed that it be named Heminger City (presumably after himself), but in 1949 the townspeople chose the name Enterprise instead. Heminger moved a mile down the road in protest, and platted a small community there called Heminger City. This was eventually incorporated in the West Richland City limits. When the time came in 1955 to incorporate the town, it was decided to rename to West Richland, taking advantage of the already well-known status of nearby Richland. West Richland was officially incorporated on June 17, 1955, combining the two towns of Heminger City and Enterprise. 

In 2008, West Richland was the location of the speed test for the fastest production car in the world (the Aero SSC TT) at over .

<text>Cashmere is a city in Chelan County, Washington, United States. It is part of the Wenatchee–East Wenatchee Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 3,248 at the 2020 census.

==History==

===Early people===
Prior to 1850, the village Ntuatckam was estimated to have a population of 400 on the site of present day Cashmere. The indigenous people are the Sinpesquensi, a band of the Wenatchi people, who were sustained by abundant game and anadromous fish. The Wenatchee River, which runs through Cashmere, was historically home to coho, chinook, and sockeye salmon, as well as steelhead. These wild stocks have been severely impacted by the dams on the Columbia River, although several runs still exist. The Wenatchi people were displaced to the Colville Indian Reservation by the federal government, but still claim some fishing rights in the area.

===First Europeans and settlement===
The first European to enter the Mission Valley was Catholic missionary Father Respari, of the Oblate Fathers, in the 1850s. He lived among the Wenatchi people for twenty years teaching them his religion. He was succeeded in the 1870s by Jesuit missionary Father Urban Grassi who built the St. Francis Xavier Mission in 1873. After the missionaries&#x27; departure, the valley was next settled in the 1880s by ranchers and squatters. There were enough settlers in the area to necessitate the construction of a one-room schoolhouse in 1886. This sparse settlement was later known as Old Mission, after the Catholic missions of past. George Kline opened the first store further down the valley in 1888 to serve the burgeoning ranch population. A post office was soon established and Kline was appointed postmaster. The town was named &quot;Mission&quot; after the early missionaries.

===Railroad and irrigation===
In 1892, it was revealed that the Great Northern Railroad would be building its main line through the valley and Mission was platted between the right-of-way and the Wenatchee River in hopes of receiving a station stop on the new line. It did not receive a station at that time and no boom occurred when the railroad came. Not until 1900 did Cashmere become a flag stop and a small section house was built, manned by two employees. This small building was preserved and today exists on the property of the Cashmere Museum and Pioneer Village.

The prosperity the railroads brought revived local interest to irrigate the arid valley. In 1892, a stock company was formed with a capital stock of $5000. Local men took out mile contracts to help dig the ditch. At a great personal expense to many involved, the Peshastin Ditch was completed within twelve years. Following its activation, the town as well as the entire area, blossomed. Through the 1900s, Mission grew in earnest. The town was becoming a shipping point for the growing fruit and agricultural industry in the valley. Within several years, better rail passenger service was demanded by citizens and a new, larger depot was built in 1903 and is also still standing in its original place.

===Renaming of Mission through 1920===
By 1903 the town&#x27;s population had reached over 200. Citing confusion of this town with another in northern Okanogan County (that no longer exists), that same year, Mission and the entire valley were renamed for Kashmir, as local judge James H. Chase claimed it resembled the foothills of that region. The spelling was changed to a more Americanized &quot;Cashmere&quot;. Cashmere was incorporated in 1904 and continued to prosper with the opening of the Mission Canal later that year which turned hundreds of acres of dry-unusable land into fertile farm land. Seattle investors purchased large tracts of land in and around Cashmere and constructed the town&#x27;s first hotel and saloon in 1905. A library was established in 1908 by the town&#x27;s Woman&#x27;s club. By 1909, Cashmere housed three banks. Telephone service was installed in 1909 followed by paved sidewalks in 1913, electric lights in 1914 and paved streets in 1919.

=== 1920s–1930s ===
The Cashmere chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was organized in August 1922. Nearly 400 people attended a 1924 meeting at the Cashmere Methodist Episcopal Church. A Cashmere band performed in a parade for the 1926 state convention in Wenatchee.

In August 1931, a pow wow took place over the course of three days to call attention to the unfulfilled treaty agreements to the Wenatchi people, including the Wenatchupam Fishery, and boost the Cashmere economy. The encampment was composed of tipis on the land of Mary Felix, one of the few Wenatchi people living in town, in Yaksum canyon. It was estimated that nearly 700 Native Americans attended, including 250 Wenatchi who traveled from Colville and Yakama reservations. Notable guests included leaders from other tribes and Governor Roland H. Hartley. Proceeds went to restore the cemetery on the other side of Highway 2.

===Industries and agriculture===
The Cashmere area has a rich history of tree fruit production, starting with the first pioneers. With the construction of the Peshastin irrigation ditch in the 1890s, ranches and sagebrush gave way to lush orchards climbing up the walls of the valley. In addition to apples, the soils and climate are ideal for the production of pears, with Bartlett and D&#x27;Anjou varieties well represented. Beginning in the 1910s, a number of orchards were opened in Cashmere to take advantage of the area&#x27;s balmy climate. While many orchards have given way to development, the history of fruit production is still evident in the many orchards and historical fruit warehouses in the area. Overdevelopment is a real threat to the agricultural heritage of the area; the agreeable climate and outstanding scenery attract many people to the area.

The history of the area is also tied to timber production. Cashmere was the home of a large sawmill. The first settlers found abundant ponderosa pine (&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot;) and Douglas-fir trees. These timbers were of the highest quality because of the arid climate, which causes the trees to grow very slowly, keeping a tight grain.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

===Climate===
This region experiences warm and dry summers that have become increasingly hot during the past decade. On July 4, 2015, the max. temp was 106 F and the mean temp was 88 F (Wunderground.com). According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Cashmere has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps.

==Economy==

Cashmere is home to Liberty Orchards, the maker of Aplets &amp; Cotlets confectionaries. In 1997, the city renamed two of its main streets to Aplets Way and Cotlets Avenue as part of a promotion requested by the company, who had threatened to move from the area. Cashmere is also the headquarters of Cashmere Valley Bank, established in 1932 by Hy W. Rieke and H.H. Rieke after the failure of two banks during the beginning of the Great Depression. Today, they are one of the largest financial institutions in Central Washington.

<doc id="137834" wikidata="Q1207462" url="?curid=137834" title="Chelan, Washington">
<text>Chelan ( ) is a city in Chelan County, Washington, United States. The estimated population was 4,222 at the 2020 census. It lies on the southeast tip of Lake Chelan, where the lake flows into the Chelan River.

Chelan is part of the Wenatchee−East Wenatchee Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The original inhabitants of the Chelan area were the Chelan, a tribe of Salish-speaking Native Americans. Relatively little is known about the culture and lifestyle of the early Chelan, as the tribe had adopted the dress, beadwork, and equestrian culture of the Plains Indians by the time of European contact. Infectious diseases including smallpox and measles arrived sometime prior to white settlement of the area, and had killed an estimated 90% of the Indians by the time explorer David Thompson arrived on the Columbia in 1811.

Until this point tribal decision-making had been carried out by small family groups as opposed to a single chief. But as whites began to settle in the area, the Indians recognized that consolidation of power in a single representative would help them maintain control of their ancestral lands. Though not a Chelan Indian himself, Chief Moses (a Shahaptin, not Salish speaker from the Columbia Basin and Okanagan) agreed to represent the tribe and was nearly successful in securing them a large Indian reservation. However, the tribe&#x27;s relatively low population meant that they were largely unable to defend their territory from the ever-increasing number of miners looking for riches in the mountains. As the unrest continued into the 1870s, Lt. Colonel Henry Clay Merriam of the United States Army established Camp Chelan at the foot of Lake Chelan to control and safeguard the Indian population on the Moses Columbia Reservation. The lake was largely inaccessible because of its sheer cliffs on most sides, so a makeshift road was built from the fort to the Columbia River where a courier and mail service from Walla Walla were established and the small village of Chelan Falls would later develop. The fort operated for about a year and was abandoned in October 1880 when the troops relocated to Fort Spokane.

The first European settlers in the area were William Sanders (after whom one of main streets in Chelan is named) and Henry Dumpke, who arrived in 1886. After traversing several cliffs and streams and losing their horse, they safely arrived at the foot of the lake and were welcomed by the natives who encouraged them to stake claims. The presence of these settlers paved the way for more settlers to move to the valley. In 1888, Minneapolis realtor and lumber broker L.H. Woodin, after whom another street is now named, arrived in the valley and paddled up the lake in a skiff. Impressed by the area, Woodin constructed a sawmill at the foot of the lake. At the same time, local ranchers were beginning to discover that orchards could be planted without the need of irrigation.

The town was platted and lots sold quickly. A post office was established in 1890. A school was built in 1892, followed by a resort hotel which took advantage of the area&#x27;s natural beauty. Following the Panic of 1893, Chelan fell on hard times but fared better than some other towns. The town&#x27;s first bank was established in 1893. Chelan was officially incorporated on May 7, 1902. In 1903, the city gained electric lights and water service via nearby Donaldson Springs. Chelan&#x27;s first town hall was constructed in 1904 and destroyed by fire in 1927. The town continues to grow as an agricultural center and resort community which helps it thrive to this day.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

===Climate===
Chelan&#x27;s climate is typical for Eastern Washington. Located behind the rain shadow of the Cascade Mountains, it receives a near-desert amount of precipitation each year.

<text>Entiat is a city in Chelan County, Washington, United States. It is part of the Wenatchee−East Wenatchee Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,326 at the 2020 census.

The name &quot;Entiat&quot; refers to the indigenous Entiat people, whose name comes from the Moses-Columbian Salishan word /nt&#x27;yátkʷ/, [nt&#x27;iátkʷ], &quot;place of grassy water&quot;, from /na-/, &quot;place&quot;, /st&#x27;íyaʔ/, &quot;tall grass, hay&quot;, and /-atkʷ/, &quot;water&quot;.

==History==
Columbia River Chinook Indians settled the Entiat Valley in the 1800s. Chief Shil-how-Saskt (Silico Saska) selected the congruence of the Columbia and Entiat rivers as the place for his camp.

The Albert Long Museum in Entiat opened in 1980, in one of only two buildings (built 1895) that survived the opening of Rocky Reach Dam. It houses historical items from local logging and fruit industries.

===First town===
In 1877, Lewis Detwiler, the first white settler, arrived in the Entiat Valley. In 1896, Chief Silico Saska sold the town site of Entiat. He died in 1903.

This first town site was located approx. half a mile west of the Columbia River, on Entiat River&#x27;s north side. The first public school was established in Entiat in 1891. In 1895 the first Entiat Post Office was established. The Entiat Power Plant opened for business in 1908. The Keystone Fruit Company opened for business in the valley in 1910. E.P. Murphy began publishing the Entiat Times in 1913, and railroad service began in Entiat in 1914. In 1915 only six businesses survived a fire. The Entiat school opened in 1916 in its current location.

===Second town===
In 1921 a new fire razed First Town, and the second town site of Entiat was secured.

In 1920, the tradition of Numeral Mountain began as High School seniors painted their graduation class number on the Mountainside across the Entiat River from the school. Entiat was officially incorporated on April 25, 1944.

===Third town===
In 1960, Rocky Reach Dam was constructed downriver from Entiat; much of the town had to be relocated to higher ground due to the rising waters behind the dam. Most of the original buildings were razed or moved to a location north of the original town. This third town of Entiat was officially open for business in 1961.

The new Entiat Park re-opened for camping on Friday, May 22, 2015, after being closed for over a year.

<text>Leavenworth is a city in Chelan County, Washington, United States. It is part of the Wenatchee−East Wenatchee Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,263 at the 2020 census. The entire town center is modeled on a German Bavarian village as part of a civic initiative that began in the 1960s.

==History==

The area near the confluence of Icicle Creek and the Wenatchee River in modern-day Leavenworth is within the traditional territories of the indigenous Wenatchi and Yakama peoples. The tribes had settlements on both waterways, including the villages of scəm̓ ̓áw̓s and sĭnpŭsqốĭsoḣ near modern-day Leavenworth, which was also a camas and root-gathering area. The Wenatchi and Yakama were signatories to the 1855 Treaty of Walla Walla; an Indian reservation for the Wenatchi covering around a fishery at the confluence was promised in the treaty but never surveyed by the federal government. Most members of the Wenatchi relocated to the Colville Indian Reservation and Yakama Indian Reservation in the early 20th century, while few remained in the Leavenworth and Cashmere area.

The first non-native settlers in the area were John Emig and Nicholas Kinscherf, who staked their homestead claims near Icicle Creek in 1885. A community named &quot;Icicle Flats&quot; was established by other settlers on the south side of the Wenatchee River in 1891. According to surveyor Albert Hale Sylvester, the &quot;Icicle&quot; name was derived from the indigenous name &quot;Nasikelt&quot;, which translates to a narrow canyon or gorge. The Great Northern Railway purchased land on the north side of the river for a division point and railyard for its route across Stevens Pass in October 1892, which prompted residents to move across the river. A new town was established there in 1893 and named Leavenworth for Charles Leavenworth, a Portland-based land investor with the Okanogan Investment Company who surveyed the site and laid its streets. Leavenworth was a relative of U.S. Army colonel Henry Leavenworth, the founder of Fort Leavenworth and namesake of Leavenworth, Kansas. The Stevens Pass route, which connected Seattle to Wenatchee, was completed in January 1893 and was the final section of the transcontinental Great Northern Railway.

By February 1893, the new town of Leavenworth had grown to approximately 700 people and over 40 businesses, including hotels, general stores, and saloons. Lafayette Lamb arrived in 1903 from Clinton, Iowa, to build the second largest sawmill in Washington. The settlement had three major fires at the turn of the 20th century that destroyed several buildings. Leavenworth was officially incorporated as a city on September 5, 1906. A small timber community, it became a regional office of the Great Northern Railway in the early 1900s. The railroad relocated to Wenatchee in 1925, greatly affecting Leavenworth&#x27;s economy. The city&#x27;s population declined well into the 1950s as the lumber mills closed and stores relocated.

The city looked to tourism and recreation as a major economy as early as 1929, when they opened a ski jump. In 1962, the Project LIFE (Leavenworth Improvement For Everyone) Committee was formed in partnership with the University of Washington to investigate strategies to revitalize the struggling logging town. The idea to create a &quot;Bavarian-Swiss&quot; alpine theme town came from two Seattle businessmen, Ted Price and Bob Rodgers, who had bought a failing cafe at Coles Corner in 1960. Price and Rodgers had chosen the theme based on the latter&#x27;s experience in Bavaria while deployed by the U.S. Army during World War II; the cafe was renamed The Squirrel Tree and expanded with a motel and gift shop. Price was chair of the Project LIFE tourism subcommittee, and in 1965 the pair led a trip to a Danish-themed town, Solvang, California, to build support for the idea.

The Project LIFE members acquired properties in Leavenworth and were joined by architects Earl Petersen, who designed Solvang&#x27;s Danish buildings, and Germany-born designer Heinz Ulbricht. The first building to be rebuilt in the Bavarian style was the Chikamin Hotel, which had been damaged in a fire and reopened as the Edelweiss Hotel (named for the state flower of Bavaria) on July 1, 1965. Several buildings were renovated later that year after business loans were secured to prepare the city for the 1966 Washington Autumn Leaf Festival. By 1970, Leavenworth was hosting several annual festivals and had formed a design review board to enforce and maintain the standards set by Project LIFE.

On July 28, 1994, the Rat Creek Fire was ignited in the Icicle Creek basin and grew to over the next three weeks as it moved towards northeast Leavenworth. It was one of 34 fires in the Hatchery Complex Fire that were ignited in late July by thunderstorms and other causes. The city was placed under an evacuation alert for several days as the fire surrounded parts of the valley and shut down U.S. Route 2. The evacuation alert in Leavenworth was lifted by August 10, coinciding with the reopening of U.S. Route 2. Later fires in 2001, 2004, and 2012 burned areas around Leavenworth.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

===Geology===
Leavenworth sits on the southeast side of the North Cascades collage, a group of terranes that accreted to North America approximately 90 million years before present during the Cretaceous period. The presence of marine fossils in the terranes indicates that they may have been a group of islands originating in the South Pacific. They originally were oriented into north–south slices until further accretion cut the terranes into horizontal, east–west slices.

During the Eocene epoch about 50 million years before present, the area was once again cut into north–south slices that created several local fault lines, including the Leavenworth fault and the Entiat fault. The Chiwaukum graben was created between these faults; it is about wide and trends northwest from Wenatchee for about . As the graben dropped, it began to fill with clastic sediment from the surrounding hills, creating the Chumstick formation. About 30 million years before present in the Oligocene epoch, the Chiwaukum graben underwent compressional deformation creating several folds in the region that are visible today. Leavenworth is on the western edge of the graben; the Leavenworth fault runs through the western edge of town. The area to the west and southwest of Leavenworth was created in the middle Cretaceous period with the uplift of the Mount Stuart batholith, forming the granite rock seen today in Icicle Ridge and Tumwater Mountain.

During the Pleistocene and into the Holocene epochs, an alpine glacier originating from the southwest in the Mount Stuart range made its way to where the town is today. Leavenworth sits on the terminal moraine of that glacier and has many glacial erratics that originated 20 miles up the Icicle Valley near Mount Stuart. Approximately 19,000 years before present, a large rock slide dammed the Columbia River near Rock Island, just south of Wenatchee. The temporary dam, in conjunction with one of the Lake Missoula floods, caused the water to flow back up the Wenatchee Valley, where it was stopped by the glacier at Leavenworth. As the leading edge of the glacier interacted with the flood, ice rafts formed carrying granite erratics from the Stuart batholith, which ended up in the town of Dryden about 15 miles down the valley from Leavenworth. As the glacier retreated, the south side of Leavenworth was a lake dammed up by the moraine.

===Climate===
Leavenworth has a continental Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Dsb&quot;) with summers characterized by hot, sunny days and chilly nights, and cold, snowy winters.

During the summer, the weather is typically anticyclonic due to the presence of the North Pacific anticyclone, with resultant clear skies and large diurnal temperature ranges. Rainfall is limited by the Cascade rain shadow as well as by the anticyclone, and all months from May to October have recorded zero precipitation on occasions, including 114 consecutive days without precipitation from June to October 2003. When a continental flow enters the Columbia Basin, the temperature can be very hot during the day, with the hottest temperature being during the heatwave of July 1941. However, on cooler, stiller days, summer nights can still be cold and frosts have been recorded as early as August 29 in 1980.

The fall months have steady cooling and a gradual increase in the frequency of frontal storms producing rainfall, while winter weather is typically cold and snowy, with an annual mean snowfall of and a maximum monthly total of recorded in December 1996. The snowiest season has been from July 1968 to June 1969 with and the least snowy from July 1962 to June 1963 when just of snow fell. The lowest temperature recorded in Leavenworth was on December 30, 1968, but typically five mornings per year will fall at or below . Approximately of snow fell in a 48-hour period in January 2022, causing widespread disruption and a shortage of space to store plowed and collected snow.

The wettest &quot;rain year&quot; was recorded from July 1955 to June 1956 with a total of and the driest was from July 1929 to June 1930 with . The spring months see gradual warming and drying, though frosts remain frequent well into the start of April. During an average year, over 168 mornings see temperatures fall to freezing or below. May 16 is the average date of last freeze; 2016 was the first year to record a last frost in March.

==Culture and tourism==
Leavenworth was designed with an Alpine German theme from the 1960s onward, with most buildings modeled after Bavarian settlements and adopting stereotypical fonts and names. However the town retains wide streets and large parking lots which are atypical of Bavaria. The Alpine German architectural theme is regulated by a design review board that approves plans for all new businesses, including chain establishments, leading to unusual designs for local fast-food restaurants and other retailers. Leavenworth&#x27;s transformation into a theme town was inspired, and assisted, by Solvang, California. Later, the Washington town of Winthrop followed Leavenworth&#x27;s example and adopted a Western town theme.

The Bavarianization of the town waned by the 1990s but was revived through the establishment of annual events, including an Oktoberfest begun in 1998. The Oktoberfest was later cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic before the original was moved to Wenatchee beginning in 2022, and the city&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce started their own Oktoberfest event that remained in town. A Krampusnacht celebration was held in December 2020 and 2021 but later moved out of Leavenworth following complaints from religious groups.

Leavenworth is home to the Leavenworth Nutcracker Museum, which opened in 1995 and contains more than 7,000 nutcrackers dating from the 16th and 17th centuries to modern examples. The city hosts an annual Christmas tree lighting celebration in December that draws thousands of visitors and causes congestion on local highways. By 2001, Leavenworth had 19 annual weekend festivals and events, including a Maifest and Autumn Leaf Festival.

In November 2007, &quot;Good Morning America&quot; went to Leavenworth for &quot;Holiday Gifts for the Globe&quot; where GMA helped light up the town for the Christmas Holiday. Leavenworth was named the Ultimate Holiday Town USA by A&amp;E Network.

The city has also focused on outdoor recreation to draw tourists, including skiing, hiking, and mountain biking. The increased reliance on outdoor tourism has brought non-themed businesses to Leavenworth. The Leavenworth Ski Hill north of downtown was designated a U.S. historic district in 2013 due to its significance as a ski jumping area and its surviving Civilian Conservation Corps architecture. An adventure park that comprises a climbing wall and alpine coaster with of track and opened in 2023 on a hill on the southwest side of the city. , Leavenworth had a total hotel capacity of 4,288 rooms.

===Media===

The city&#x27;s weekly newspaper, the &quot;Leavenworth Echo&quot;, was founded in 1904 and independently operated until it was acquired in 2023 by Ward Media. Jazz radio station KOHO-FM was founded in 1999 and broadcast from Leavenworth until it switched to Northwest Public Radio&#x27;s feed in 2022. Leavenworth is also part of the Seattle–Tacoma television media market as defined by Nielsen Media Research.

Leavenworth&#x27;s public library is operated by the NCW Libraries system, which serves five counties in Central Washington. The library occupies inside the city hall building on U.S. Route 2; a study to move the library to a closed elementary school was approved by the Leavenworth city council in 2024.

==Government and politics==

Leavenworth has a mayor–council form of government with a mayor and seven city councilmembers all elected to four-year terms. Former councilmember Carl Florea was elected mayor in 2019 and re-elected in 2023. The day-to-day operations of the city government is led by an appointed city administrator; , the city government has 44 employees.

Leavenworth is within the 8th congressional district and 12th legislative district, which both encompass most of Chelan County and parts of neighboring King and Snohomish counties. Unlike the rest of Chelan County, Leavenworth has voted for the Democratic Party&#x27;s candidate by wide margins in presidential elections since 2012. The city had a 41-point margin for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, while Donald Trump won the county&#x27;s overall vote.

==Education==

Public schools in Leavenworth and the surrounding area are operated by the Cascade School District, which has over 1,100 students and serves the upper Wenatchee Valley. The district has one high school, located in Leavenworth, that was rebuilt in 2019.

The city is also home to the Upper Valley Christian School, a private K–12 school operated by the Leavenworth Church of the Nazarene. It was established in 1979 and has 52 students.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
Leavenworth is located on U.S. Route 2, which continues west across Stevens Pass to Snohomish County and east towards Wenatchee. The highway has turn lanes through most of the city and ranges from two to four lanes wide; it is highly congested during seasonal events, which has sometimes required law enforcement to direct traffic. The Chumstick Highway (former State Route 209) travels north from Leavenworth to Plain and Lake Wenatchee State Park.

The city is served by Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Empire Builder&quot; train, which stops daily at Icicle Station near downtown. Link Transit provides local and inter-city public transit services that connect Leavenworth to Wenatchee, as well as local paratransit and a downtown shuttle. A park-and-ride lot in downtown Leavenworth with 30 stalls is served by Link Transit, along with the Wilkommen Park and Ride opened in June 2019. The city also has several private taxi companies and inter-city bus operators, including stops for Northwestern Trailways and Amtrak Thruway.

===Utilities===

Electric power in Leavenworth and surrounding communities is provided by Chelan County Public Utility District, a nonprofit municipal corporation which serves the entire county. Over 80 percent of the utility&#x27;s electricity is sourced from hydroelectric dams.

The Leavenworth city government provides tap water to over 1,404 residential and commercial customers with an estimated annual use of . Its primary source is Icicle Creek, which originates in the Cascades near Stevens Pass and also serves a federal fish hatchery and nearby orchards. The city&#x27;s use of Icicle Creek was the subject of a decade-long dispute with the Washington State Department of Ecology and conservationists that was settled in 2023 with a revised water rights agreement. Leavenworth also sources a portion of its tap water from three wells near the Wenatchee River that were constructed from 1989 to 2014.

All curbside collection of garbage, recycling, and yard waste has been contracted by the city government to Waste Management since 2019. Prior to the agreement, Waste Management only collected recycling while the city government disposed of garbage.

===Healthcare===

Leavenworth has one public hospital, Cascade Medical Center, with 12 beds designated for acute care and an on-site rural health clinic. The hospital is operated by the Chelan County Public Hospital District No. 1 and has 150 employees. The hospital was established in 1923 as the Cascade Sanitarium with 26 beds and was expanded to 32 beds in 1947 with the construction of a new wing. A public hospital district was formed in 1965 to fund a new building, which opened in the following decade with 33 beds and was named the Cascade Medical Center.

A 16-bed satellite facility for the Cascade Medical Center in Wenatchee opened in July 1997 through a partnership with the Wenatchee Valley Clinic; the rooms included Bavarian-style artwork that was donated by Leavenworth residents. The satellite hospital was intended to improve revenues for Cascade, which had few patients in Leavenworth, but instead left the hospital with $4.7 million in debt. Cascade sold its bed licenses to the Wenatchee Valley Clinic in 2001 for $2.5 million to resolve its remaining debt and end the partnership. Funding for a new, $14 million facility for Cascade in Leavenworth was approved by voters in 2005 through a $8.8 million bond measure. The new hospital opened in November 2010 with a new acute care unit; it was followed by renovations in 2011 to the existing building to house lab space and a larger lobby.

<text>The Great Purge, or the Great Terror (), also known as the Year of &#x27;37 () and the Yezhovshchina ( , ), was a political purge in the Soviet Union that took place from 1936 to 1938. It sought to consolidate Joseph Stalin&#x27;s power over the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and aimed at removing the remaining influence of Leon Trotsky within the Soviet Union. The term &quot;great purge&quot; was popularized by the historian Robert Conquest in his 1968 book &quot;The Great Terror&quot;, whose title was an allusion to the French Revolution&#x27;s Reign of Terror (sometimes referred to as &quot;les épurations&quot;).

The purges were largely conducted by the NKVD (People&#x27;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs), which functioned as the interior ministry and secret police of the USSR. Starting in 1936, the NKVD under chief Genrikh Yagoda began the removal of the central party leadership, Old Bolsheviks, government officials, and regional party bosses. Soviet politicians who opposed or criticized Stalin were removed from office and imprisoned or executed by the NKVD. Eventually, the purges were expanded to the Red Army and military high command, which had a disastrous effect on the military. The campaigns also affected many other categories of society: the intelligentsia, wealthy peasants—especially those lending out money or wealth (&quot;kulaks&quot;)—and professionals. As the scope of the purge widened, the omnipresent suspicion of saboteurs and counter-revolutionaries, known collectively as wreckers, began affecting civilian life. The purge reached its peak between September 1936 and August 1938, when the NKVD was under chief Nikolai Yezhov, hence the name &quot;Yezhovshchina&quot;. The campaigns were carried out according to the general line of the party, often by direct orders of the politburo, headed by Stalin. Hundreds of thousands of people were accused of various political crimes (espionage, wrecking, sabotage, anti-Soviet agitation, conspiracies to prepare uprisings and coups, and more). They were executed by shooting, or sent to the Gulag labor camps. The NKVD targeted certain ethnic minorities with particular force, such as the Volga Germans or Soviet citizens of Polish origin, who were subjected to forced deportation and extreme repression. Throughout the purge, the NKVD sought to strengthen control over civilians through fear, and frequently used imprisonment, torture, violent interrogation, and executions during its mass operations. 

In 1938, Stalin reversed his stance on the purges, criticized the NKVD for carrying out mass executions, and oversaw the execution of NKVD chiefs Genrikh Yagoda and Nikolai Yezhov. Scholars estimate the death toll for the Great Purge (1936–1938) to be roughly 700,000–1.2 million. Despite the end of the Great Purge, the widespread surveillance and atmosphere of mistrust continued for decades. Similar purges took place in Mongolia and Xinjiang. While the Soviet government desired to put Trotsky on trial during the purge, his exile prevented this. Trotsky survived the purge, though he would be assassinated in 1940 by the NKVD in Mexico, on the orders of Stalin.

==Background==

Following the death of Vladimir Lenin in 1924, a power vacuum opened in the Communist Party, the ruling party in the Soviet Union (USSR). Various established figures in Lenin&#x27;s government attempted to succeed him. By 1928, Joseph Stalin, the party&#x27;s General Secretary, had triumphed over his opponents and gained control of the party. Initially, Stalin&#x27;s leadership was widely accepted; his main political adversary, Trotsky, was forced into exile in 1929, and Stalin&#x27;s doctrine of &quot;socialism in one country&quot; became enshrined party policy. However, in the early 1930s, party officials began to lose faith in his leadership, largely due to the human cost of the first five-year plan and the collectivization of agriculture, notably including the Holodomor famine in Ukraine. 

From 1930 onwards, the Party and police officials feared the &quot;social disorder&quot; caused by the upheavals of forced collectivization of peasants and the resulting famine of 1930–1933, as well as the massive and uncontrolled migration of millions of peasants into cities. The threat of war heightened Stalin&#x27;s and generally Soviet perception of marginal and politically suspect populations as the potential source of an uprising in case of invasion. Stalin began to plan for the preventive elimination of such potential recruits for a mythical &quot;fifth column of wreckers, terrorists, and spies.&quot;

The term &quot;purge&quot; in Soviet political slang was an abbreviation of the expression &quot;purge of the Party ranks&quot;. In 1933, for example, the Party expelled some 400,000 people. But from 1936 until 1953, the term changed its meaning, because being expelled from the Party came to mean almost certain arrest, imprisonment, and often execution.

The political purge was primarily an effort by Stalin to eliminate challenge from past and potential opposition groups, including the left and right wings led by Leon Trotsky and Nikolai Bukharin, respectively. Following the Civil War and reconstruction of the Soviet economy in the late 1920s, veteran Bolsheviks no longer thought necessary the &quot;temporary&quot; wartime dictatorship, which had passed from Lenin to Stalin. Stalin&#x27;s opponents inside the Communist Party chided him as undemocratic and lax on bureaucratic corruption.

This opposition to current leadership may have accumulated substantial support among the working class by attacking the privileges and luxuries the state offered to its high-paid elite. The Ryutin affair seemed to vindicate Stalin&#x27;s suspicions. Ryutin was working with the even larger secret Opposition Bloc in which Leon Trotsky and Grigory Zinoviev participated, and which later led to both of their deaths. Stalin enforced a ban on party factions and demoted those party members who had opposed him, effectively ending democratic centralism.

In the new form of Party organization, the Politburo, and Stalin in particular, were the sole dispensers of ideology. This required the elimination of all Marxists with different views, especially those among the prestigious &quot;old guard&quot; of revolutionaries. As the purges began, the government (through the NKVD) shot Bolshevik heroes, including Mikhail Tukhachevsky and Béla Kun, as well as the majority of Lenin&#x27;s Politburo, for disagreements in policy. The NKVD attacked the supporters, friends, and family of these &quot;heretical&quot; Marxists, whether they lived in Russia or not. The NKVD nearly annihilated Trotsky&#x27;s family before killing him in Mexico; the NKVD agent Ramón Mercader was part of an assassination task force put together by Special Agent Pavel Sudoplatov, under the personal orders of Stalin.

By 1934, several of Stalin&#x27;s rivals, such as Trotsky, began calling for Stalin&#x27;s removal and attempted to break his control over the party. In this atmosphere of doubt and suspicion, the popular high-ranking official Sergei Kirov was assassinated. The assassination, in December 1934, led to an investigation that revealed a network of party members supposedly working against Stalin, including several of Stalin&#x27;s rivals. Many of those arrested after Kirov&#x27;s murder, high-ranking party officials among them, also confessed plans to kill Stalin themselves, albeit often under duress. The validity of these confessions is debated by historians, but there is consensus that Kirov&#x27;s death was the flashpoint at which Stalin decided to take action and begin the purges. Some later historians came to believe that Stalin arranged the murder, or at least that there was sufficient evidence to reach such a conclusion. Kirov was a staunch Stalin loyalist, but Stalin may have viewed him as a potential rival because of his emerging popularity among the moderates. The 1934 Party Congress elected Kirov to the central committee with only three votes against, the fewest of any candidate, while Stalin received 292 votes against. After Kirov&#x27;s assassination, the NKVD charged the ever-growing group of former oppositionists with Kirov&#x27;s murder as well as a growing list of other offenses, including treason, terrorism, sabotage, and espionage.

Another justification for the purge was to remove any possible &quot;fifth column&quot; in case of a war. Vyacheslav Molotov and Lazar Kaganovich, participants in the repression as members of the Politburo, maintained this justification throughout the purge; they each signed many death lists. Stalin believed war was imminent, threatened both by an explicitly hostile Germany and an expansionist Japan. The Soviet press portrayed the country as threatened from within by fascist spies.

From the October Revolution onward, Lenin had used repression against perceived and legitimate enemies of the Bolsheviks as a systematic method of instilling fear and facilitating control over the population in a campaign called the Red Terror. As the Russian Civil War drew to a close, this campaign was relaxed although the secret police did remain active. From 1924 to 1928, the mass repression—including incarceration in the Gulag system—dropped significantly.

By 1929, Stalin had defeated his political opponents and gained full control over the party. He organized a committee to begin the process of industrialization of the Soviet Union. Backlash against industrialization and the collectivization of agriculture escalated, which prompted Stalin to increase police presence in rural areas. Soviet authorities increased repression against the kulaks (i.e., wealthy peasants that owned farmland) in a policy called dekulakization. The kulaks responded by destroying crop yields and other acts of sabotage against the Soviet government. The food shortage led to a mass famine across the USSR and slowed the Five Year Plan.

A distinctive feature of the Great Purge was that, for the first time, members of the ruling party were included on a massive scale as victims of the repression. In addition to ordinary citizens, prominent members of the Communist Party were also targets for the purges. The purge of the Party was accompanied by the purge of the whole society. Soviet historians organize the Great Purge into three corresponding trials. The following events are used for the demarcation of the period:
* 1936, the first Moscow trial.
* 1937, introduction of NKVD troikas for implementation of &quot;revolutionary justice.&quot;
* 1937, passage of Article 58-14 about &quot;counter-revolutionary sabotage.&quot;
* 1937, the second Moscow trial.
* 1937, the military purge.
* 1938, the third Moscow trial.

==Moscow trials==
===First and second Moscow trials===
Between 1936 and 1938, three very large Moscow trials of former senior Communist Party leaders were held, in which they were accused of conspiring with fascist and capitalist powers to assassinate Stalin and other Soviet leaders, dismember the Soviet Union and restore capitalism. These trials were highly publicized and extensively covered by the outside world, which was mesmerized by the spectacle of Lenin&#x27;s closest associates confessing to most outrageous crimes and begging for death sentences:
* The first trial was of 16 members of the so-called &quot;Trotskyite-Kamenevite-Zinovievite-Leftist-Counter-Revolutionary Bloc,&quot; held in August 1936, at which the chief defendants were Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev, two of the most prominent former party leaders, who had indeed been members of a Conspiratorial Bloc that opposed Stalin, although its activities were exaggerated. Among other accusations, they were incriminated with the assassination of Kirov and plotting to kill Stalin. After confessing to the charges, all were sentenced to death and executed.
* The second trial in January 1937 involved 17 lesser figures known as the &quot;anti-Soviet Trotskyite-centre&quot; which included Karl Radek, Yuri Piatakov and Grigory Sokolnikov, and were accused of plotting with Trotsky, who was said to be conspiring with Germany. Thirteen of the defendants were eventually executed by shooting and the rest received sentences in labor camps where they soon died.
* There was also a secret trial before a military tribunal of a group of Red Army commanders, including Mikhail Tukhachevsky, in June 1937.

It is now known that the confessions were given only after great psychological pressure and torture had been applied to the defendants. From the accounts of former OGPU officer Alexander Orlov and others, the methods used to extract the confessions are known: such tortures as repeated beatings, simulated drownings, making prisoners stand or go without sleep for days on end, and threats to arrest and execute the prisoners&#x27; families. For example, Kamenev&#x27;s teenage son was arrested and charged with terrorism. After months of such interrogation, the defendants were driven to despair and exhaustion.

Zinoviev and Kamenev demanded, as a condition for &quot;confessing&quot;, a direct guarantee from the Politburo that their lives and that of their families and followers would be spared. This offer was accepted, but when they were taken to the alleged Politburo meeting, only Stalin, Kliment Voroshilov, and Yezhov were present. Stalin claimed that they were the &quot;commission&quot; authorized by the Politburo and gave assurances that death sentences would not be carried out. After the trial, Stalin not only broke his promise to spare the defendants, he had most of their relatives arrested and shot.

====Dewey Commission====
In May 1937, the Commission of Inquiry into the Charges Made against Leon Trotsky in the Moscow Trials, commonly known as the Dewey Commission, was set up in the United States by supporters of Trotsky, to establish the truth about the trials. The commission was headed by the noted American philosopher and educator John Dewey. Although the hearings were obviously conducted with a view to proving Trotsky&#x27;s innocence, they brought to light evidence which established that some of the specific charges made at the trials could not be true.

For example, Georgy Pyatakov testified that he had flown to Oslo in December 1935 to &quot;receive terrorist instructions&quot; from Trotsky. The Dewey Commission established that no such flight had taken place. Another defendant, Ivan Smirnov, confessed to taking part in the assassination of Sergei Kirov in December 1934, at a time when he had already been in prison for a year.

The Dewey Commission later published its findings in a 422-page book titled &quot;Not Guilty&quot;. Its conclusions asserted the innocence of all those condemned in the Moscow Trials. In its summary, the commission wrote:

The commission concluded: &quot;We therefore find the Moscow Trials to be frame-ups.&quot;

====Implication of the Rightists====
In the second trial, Karl Radek testified that there was a &quot;third organization separate from the cadres which had passed through [Trotsky&#x27;s] school,&quot; as well as &quot;semi-Trotskyites, quarter-Trotskyites, one-eighth-Trotskyites, people who helped us, not knowing of the terrorist organization but sympathizing with us, people who from liberalism, from a Fronde against the Party, gave us this help.&quot;

By the &quot;third organization,&quot; he meant the last remaining former opposition group called the Rightists, led by Bukharin, whom he implicated by saying:

===Third Moscow trial===

The third and final trial, in March 1938, known as the Trial of the Twenty-One, is the most famous of the Soviet show trials, because of persons involved and the scope of charges which tied together all loose threads from earlier trials. Meant to be the culmination of previous trials, it included 21 defendants alleged to belong to the &quot;Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites&quot;, supposedly led by Nikolai Bukharin, the former chairman of the Communist International, former premier Alexei Rykov, Christian Rakovsky, Nikolai Krestinsky, and Genrikh Yagoda, recently disgraced head of the NKVD.

Although an Opposition Bloc led by Trotsky and with zinovievites really existed, Pierre Broué asserts that Bukharin was not involved. Differently from Broué, one of his former allies, Jules Humbert-Droz, said in his memoirs that Bukharin told him that he formed a secret bloc with Zinoviev and Kamenev in order to remove Stalin from leadership.

The fact that Yagoda was one of the accused showed the speed at which the purges were consuming their own. It was now alleged that Bukharin and others sought to assassinate Lenin and Stalin from 1918, murder Maxim Gorky by poison, partition the USSR and hand its territories to Germany, Japan, and Great Britain, and other charges.

Even previously sympathetic observers who had accepted the earlier trials found it more difficult to accept these new allegations as they became ever more absurd, and the purge expanded to include almost every living Old Bolshevik leader except Stalin and Kalinin. No other crime of the Stalin years so captivated Western intellectuals as the trial and execution of Bukharin, who was a Marxist theorist of international standing. For some prominent communists such as Bertram Wolfe, Jay Lovestone, Arthur Koestler, and Heinrich Brandler, the Bukharin trial marked their final break with communism, and even turned the first three into fervent anti-communists eventually. To them, Bukharin&#x27;s confession symbolized the depredations of communism, which not only destroyed its sons but also conscripted them in self-destruction and individual abnegation.

====Bukharin&#x27;s confession====
On the first day of trial, Krestinsky caused a sensation when he repudiated his written confession and pleaded not guilty to all the charges. However, he changed his plea the next day after &quot;special measures&quot;, which dislocated his left shoulder among other things.

Anastas Mikoyan and Vyacheslav Molotov later claimed that Bukharin was never tortured, but it is now known that his interrogators were given the order &quot;beating permitted&quot;, and were under great pressure to extract confession out of the &quot;star&quot; defendant. Bukharin initially held out for three months, but threats to his young wife and infant son, combined with &quot;methods of physical influence&quot; wore him down. But when he read his confession amended and corrected personally by Stalin, he withdrew his whole confession. The examination started all over again, with a double team of interrogators.

Bukharin&#x27;s confession in particular became subject of much debate among Western observers, inspiring Koestler&#x27;s acclaimed novel &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; and philosophical essay by Maurice Merleau-Ponty in &quot;Humanism and Terror&quot;. His confessions were somewhat different from others in that while he pleaded guilty to &quot;sum total of crimes&quot;, he denied knowledge when it came to specific crimes. Some astute observers noted that he would allow only what was in written confession and refuse to go any further.

The result was a curious mix of fulsome confessions (of being a &quot;degenerate fascist&quot; working for &quot;restoration of capitalism&quot;) and subtle criticisms of the trial. One observer noted that after disproving several charges against him, Bukharin &quot;proceeded to demolish or rather showed he could very easily demolish the whole case.&quot; He continued by saying that &quot;the confession of the accused is not essential. The confession of the accused is a medieval principle of jurisprudence&quot; in a trial that was based solely on confessions. He finished his last plea with the words:[T]he monstrousness of my crime is immeasurable especially in the new stage of struggle of the U.S.S.R. May this trial be the last severe lesson, and may the great might of the U.S.S.R. become clear to all.Romain Rolland and others wrote to Stalin seeking clemency for Bukharin, but all the leading defendants were executed except Rakovsky and two others (who were killed in NKVD prisoner massacres in 1941). Despite the promise to spare his family, Bukharin&#x27;s wife, Anna Larina, was sent to a labor camp, but she survived to see her husband posthumously rehabilitated a half-century later by the Soviet state under Mikhail Gorbachev in 1988.

==&quot;Ex-kulaks&quot; and other &quot;anti-Soviet elements&quot;==
On 2 July 1937, in a top secret order to regional Party and NKVD chiefs Stalin instructed them to produce the estimated number of &quot;kulaks&quot; and &quot;criminals&quot; in their districts. These individuals were to be arrested and executed, or sent to the gulag camps. The party chiefs complied and produced these lists within days, with figures which roughly corresponded to the individuals who were already under secret police surveillance.

On 30 July 1937, the NKVD Order No. 00447 was issued, directed against &quot;ex-kulaks&quot; and other &quot;anti-Soviet elements&quot; (such as former officials of the Tsarist regime, former members of political parties other than the communist party, etc.). They were to be executed or sent to Gulag prison camps extrajudicially, under the decisions of NKVD troikas.

The following categories appear to have been on index-cards, catalogues of suspects assembled over the years by the NKVD and were systematically tracked down: &quot;ex-kulaks&quot; previously deported to &quot;special settlements&quot; in inhospitable parts of the country (Siberia, the Urals, Kazakhstan, and the Far North), former tsarist civil servants, former officers of the White Army, participants in peasant rebellions, members of the clergy, persons deprived of voting rights, former members of non-Bolshevik parties, ordinary criminals, like thieves, known to the police and various other &quot;socially harmful elements&quot;.

However, a large number of people were arrested at random in sweeps, on the basis of denunciations or because they were related to, were friends with or knew people already arrested. Engineers, peasants, railwaymen, and other types of workers were arrested during the &quot;Kulak Operation&quot; based on the fact that they worked for or near important strategic sites and factories where work accidents had occurred due to &quot;frantic rhythms and plans&quot;. During this period the NKVD reopened these cases and relabeled them as &quot;sabotage&quot; or &quot;wrecking.&quot;

The Orthodox clergy, including active parishioners, was nearly annihilated: 85% of the 35,000 members of the clergy were arrested. Particularly vulnerable to repression were also the so-called &quot;special settlers&quot; (&quot;spetzpereselentsy&quot;) who were under permanent police surveillance and constituted a huge pool of potential &quot;enemies&quot; to draw on. At least 100,000 of them were arrested in the course of the Great Terror.

Common criminals such as thieves, &quot;violators of the passport regime&quot;, etc. were also dealt with in a summary way. In Moscow, for example, nearly one third of the 20,765 persons executed on the Butovo firing range were charged with a non-political criminal offence.

To carry out the mass arrests, the 25,000 officers of the State Security personnel of NKVD were complemented with units of ordinary police, and Komsomol (Young Communist League) and civilian Communist Party members. Seeking to fulfill the quotas, the police rounded up people in markets and train stations, with the purpose of arresting &quot;social outcasts&quot;. Local units of the NKVD, in order to meet their &quot;casework minimums&quot; and force confessions out of arrestees worked long uninterrupted shifts during which they interrogated, tortured and beat the prisoners. In many cases those arrested were forced to sign blank pages which were later filled in with a fabricated confession by the interrogators.

After the interrogations the files were submitted to NKVD troikas, which pronounced the verdicts in the absence of the accused. During a half-day-long session a troika went through several hundred cases, delivering either a death sentence or a sentence to the Gulag labor camps. Death sentences were immediately enforceable. The executions were carried out at night, either in prisons or in secluded areas run by the NKVD and located as a rule on the outskirts of major cities.

The &quot;Kulak Operation&quot; was the largest single campaign of repression in 1937–38, with 669,929 people arrested and 376,202 executed, more than half the total of known executions.

==Campaigns targeting nationalities==
A series of mass operations of the NKVD was carried out from 1937 through 1938 targeting specific nationalities within the Soviet Union, on the order of Nikolai Yezhov.

The Polish Operation of the NKVD was the largest of this kind. The Polish operation claimed the largest number of the NKVD victims: 143,810 arrests and 111,091 executions according to records. Snyder estimates that at least eighty-five thousand of them were ethnic Poles. The remainder were &#x27;suspected&#x27; of being Polish, without further inquiry.

Poles comprised 12.5% of those who were killed during the Great Terror, while comprising only 0.4% of the population. Overall, national minorities targeted in these campaigns composed 36% of the victims of the Great Purge, despite being only 1.6% of the Soviet Union&#x27;s population. 74% of ethnic minorities arrested during the Great Purge were executed while those sentenced during the Kulak Operation had only a 50% chance of being executed, (though this may have been due to the Gulag camp&#x27;s lack of space in the late stages of the Purge rather than deliberate discrimination in sentencing).

The wives and children of those arrested and executed were dealt with by the NKVD Order No. 00486. The women were sentenced to forced labour for 5 or 10 years. Their minor children were put in orphanages. All possessions were confiscated. Extended families were purposely left with nothing to live on, which usually sealed their fate as well, affecting up to 200,000–250,000 people of Polish background depending on the size of their families.
National operations of the NKVD were conducted on a quota system using album procedure. The officials were mandated to arrest and execute a specific number of so-called &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot;, compiled by administration using various statistics but also telephone books with names sounding non-Russian.

The Polish Operation of the NKVD served as a model for a series of similar NKVD secret decrees targeting a number of the Soviet Union&#x27;s diaspora nationalities: the Finnish, Latvian, Estonian, Bulgarian, Afghan, Iranian, Greek, and Chinese. Of the operations against national minorities, it was the largest one, second only to the &quot;Kulak Operation&quot; in terms of the number of victims. According to Timothy Snyder, ethnic Poles constituted the largest group of victims in the Great Terror, comprising less than 0.5% of the country&#x27;s population but comprising 12.5% of those executed.

Timothy Snyder attributes 300,000 deaths during the Great Purge to &quot;national terror&quot; including ethnic minorities and Ukrainian &quot;kulaks&quot; who had survived dekulakization and the Holodomor famine that had been used to kill millions in the early 1930s. Lev Kopelev wrote &quot;In Ukraine 1937 began in 1933&quot;, referring to the earlier Soviet political repressions in Ukraine. There was also deadly persecution of Ukrainian cultural elites, who are referred to as the Executed Renaissance. Statistics of Ukraine&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicate that about 200,000 victims of the Great Purge were Ukrainians. 

Concerning diaspora minorities, the vast majority of whom were Soviet citizens and whose ancestors had resided for decades and sometimes centuries in the Soviet Union and Russian Empire, &quot;this designation absolutized their cross-border ethnicities as the only salient aspect of their identity, sufficient proof of their disloyalty and sufficient justification for their arrest and execution&quot; (Martin, 2001: 338). Some scholars have called the national operations of the NKVD genocidal. Norman Naimark called Stalin&#x27;s policy towards Poles in the 1930s &quot;genocidal&quot;. However, he does not consider the Great Purge entirely genocidal because it also targeted political opponents.

Some scholars, however, focus on the security dilemma in the border areas suggesting the need to secure the ethnic integrity of Soviet space &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; neighboring capitalistic enemy states. They stress the role of international relations and believe that representatives of these minorities were killed not because of their ethnicity, but because of their possible relations to countries hostile to the USSR and fear of disloyalty in the case of an invasion. Nevertheless, little proof exists to suggest that Russia&#x27;s and Stalin&#x27;s alleged prejudices played a central causal role in the Great Purge.

==Purge of the army==

The purge of the Red Army and Military Maritime Fleet removed three of five marshals (then equivalent to four-star generals), 13 of 15 army commanders (then equivalent to three-star generals), eight of nine admirals (the purge fell heavily on the Navy, who were suspected of exploiting their opportunities for foreign contacts), 50 of 57 army corps commanders, 154 out of 186 division commanders, 16 of 16 army commissars, and 25 of 28 army corps commissars.

At first, it was thought 25–50% of Red Army officers had been purged; the true figure is now known to be in the area of 3.7–7.7%. This discrepancy was the result of a systematic underestimation of the true size of the Red Army officer corps, and it was overlooked that most of those purged were merely expelled from the Party. Thirty percent of officers purged in 1937–1939 were allowed to return to service.

The purge of the army was claimed to be supported by German-forged documents (alleged correspondence between Marshal Tukhachevsky and members of the German high command). This claim is unsupported by facts, as by the time the documents were supposedly created, two of Tukhachevsky&#x27;s group were already imprisoned, and by the time the document was said to reach Stalin, the purging process was already underway. Furthermore, actual evidence introduced at trial was obtained from forced confessions.

The purge had a significant effect on German decision making in World War II: many German generals opposed an Invasion of Russia, but Hitler disagreed, arguing that the Red Army was less effective after its intellectual leadership had been eliminated in the purge.

==Wider purge==

Russian Trotskyist historian Vadim Rogovin argued that Stalin had destroyed thousands of foreign communists capable of leading socialist change in their respective countries. He referenced 600 active Bulgarian communists that perished in his prison camps along with the thousands of German communists that were handed over from Stalin to the Gestapo after the signing of the German-Soviet Pact. Rogovin also noted that sixteen members of the Central committee of the Communist Party of Germany became victims of Stalinist terror. Repressive measures were also enforced upon the Hungarian, Yugoslav and other Polish Communist parties.

According to historian Eric D. Weitz, 60% of German exiles in the Soviet Union were liquidated during the Stalinist terror, and a higher proportion of the KPD Politburo membership had died in the Soviet Union than had died in Nazi Germany. Weitz also noted that hundreds of German citizens, the majority of whom were Communists, were handed over to the Gestapo from Stalin&#x27;s administration. Many Jewish figures such as Alexander Weissberg-Cybulski and Fritz Houtermans were arrested in 1937 by the NKVD and turned over to the German Gestapo. Joseph Berger-Barzilai, co-founder of the Communist Party of Palestine, spent twenty years in Stalin&#x27;s prisons and concentrations camps after the purges in 1937. 

External purges were also conducted in Spain, in which the NKVD oversaw purges of anti-Stalinist elements in the Spanish Republican forces including Trotskyist and anarchist factions. Notable cases involved the execution of Andreu Nin, Spanish POUM and former government minister, Jose Robles, a left-wing academic and translator along with many members of the POUM faction.

Out of six members of the original Politburo during the October Revolution who lived until the Great Purge, Stalin himself was the only one who remained in the Soviet Union, alive. Four of the other five were executed; the fifth, Leon Trotsky, had been forced into exile outside the Soviet Union in 1929, but was assassinated in Mexico by Soviet agent Ramón Mercader in 1940. Of the seven members elected to the Politburo between the October Revolution and Lenin&#x27;s death in 1924, four were executed, one (Tomsky) committed suicide, and two (Molotov and Kalinin) lived.

A series of documents discovered in the Central Committee archives in 1992 by Vladimir Bukovsky demonstrate that there were limits for arrests and executions as for all other activities in the planned economy.

The victims were convicted in absentia and in camera by extrajudicial organs—the NKVD troikas sentenced indigenous &quot;enemies&quot; under NKVD Order No. 00447 and the two-man dvoiki (NKVD Commissar Nikolai Yezhov and Main State Prosecutor Andrey Vyshinsky, or their deputies) those arrested along national lines.

The victims were executed at night, either in prisons, in the cellars of NKVD headquarters, or in a secluded area, usually a forest. The NKVD officers shot prisoners in the head using pistols. Other methods of dispatching victims were used on an experimental basis. In Moscow, the use of gas vans to kill the victims during their transportation to the Butovo firing range has been documented. 

===Intelligentsia===




Those who perished during the Great Purge include:

===Western émigré victims===
Victims of the terror included American immigrants to the Soviet Union who had emigrated at the height of the Great Depression to find work. At the height of the Terror, American immigrants besieged the US embassy, begging for passports so they could leave the Soviet Union. They were turned away by embassy officials, only to be arrested on the pavement outside by lurking NKVD agents. Many were subsequently shot dead at Butovo firing range. In addition, 141 American Communists of Finnish origin were executed and buried at Sandarmokh. 127 Finnish Canadians were also shot and buried there.

===Executions of Gulag inmates===
Political prisoners already serving a sentence in the Gulag camps were also executed in large numbers. NKVD Order no. 00447 also targeted &quot;the most vicious and stubborn anti-Soviet elements in camps&quot;, they were all &quot;to be put into the first category&quot;—that is, shot. NKVD Order no. 00447 decreed 10,000 executions for this contingent, but at least three times more were shot in the course of the secret mass operation, the majority in March–April 1938.

===Mongolian Great Purge===
During the late 1930s, Stalin dispatched NKVD operatives to the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic, established a Mongolian version of the NKVD troika, and proceeded to execute tens of thousands of people accused of having ties to &quot;pro-Japanese spy rings&quot;. Buddhist lamas made up the majority of victims, with 18,000 being killed in the terror. Other victims were nobility and political and academic figures, along with some ordinary workers and herders. Mass graves containing hundreds of executed Buddhist monks and civilians have been discovered as recently as 2003.

===Xinjiang Great Purge===
The pro-Soviet leader Sheng Shicai of Xinjiang province in China launched his own purge in 1937 to coincide with Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge. The Xinjiang War (1937) broke out amid the purge. Sheng received assistance from the NKVD. Sheng and the Soviets alleged a massive Trotskyist conspiracy and a &quot;Fascist Trotskyite plot&quot; to destroy the Soviet Union. The Soviet Consul General Garegin Apresoff, General Ma Hushan, Ma Shaowu, Mahmud Sijan, the official leader of the Xinjiang province Huang Han-chang and Hoja-Niyaz were among the 435 alleged conspirators in the plot. Xinjiang came under virtual Soviet control.

==Timeline==

The Great Purge of 1936–1938 can be roughly divided into four periods:

; October 1936 – February 1937: Reforming the security organizations, adopting official plans on purging the elites.
; March – June 1937: Purging the elites; adopting plans for the mass repressions against the &quot;social base&quot; of the potential aggressors, starting of purging the &quot;elites&quot; from opposition.
; July 1937 – October 1938: Mass repressions against &quot;kulaks&quot;, &quot;dangerous&quot; ethnic minorities, family members of oppositionists, military officers, saboteurs in agriculture and industry.
; November 1938 – 1939: Stopping of mass operations, abolishing of many organs of extrajudicial executions, repressions against some organizers of mass repressions.

==End==
In the summer of 1938, Yezhov was relieved from his post as head of the NKVD and was eventually tried and executed. Lavrentiy Beria succeeded him as head. On 17 November 1938, a joint decree of Sovnarkom USSR and Central Committee of VKP(b) (Decree about Arrests, Prosecutor Supervision and Course of Investigation) and the subsequent order of the NKVD undersigned by Beria cancelled most of the NKVD orders of systematic repression and suspended implementation of death sentences. The decree signaled the end of massive Soviet purges. 

Michael Parrish argues that while the Great Terror ended in 1938, a lesser terror continued in the 1940s. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (a Soviet Army officer who became a prisoner for a decade in the Gulag system) presents in &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; his view of the timeline of &quot;all&quot; the Leninist and Stalinist purges (1918–1956), in which the 1936–1938 purge may have been simply the one that got the most attention from people in a position to record its magnitude for posterity—the intelligentsia—by directly targeting them, whereas several other waves of the ongoing flow of purges, such as the first five-year plan of 1928–1933&#x27;s collectivization and dekulakization, were just as huge and just as devoid of justice but were more successfully swallowed into oblivion in the popular memory of the (surviving) Soviet public.

In some cases, high military command arrested under Yezhov were later executed under Beria. Some examples include Marshal of the Soviet Union Alexander Yegorov, arrested in April 1938 and shot (or died from torture) in February 1939 (his wife, G. A. Yegorova, was shot in August 1938); Army Commander Ivan Fedko, arrested July 1938 and shot February 1939; Flagman Konstantin Dushenov, arrested May 1938 and shot February 1940; Komkor G. I. Bondar, arrested August 1938 and shot March 1939. All the aforementioned have been posthumously rehabilitated.

When the relatives of those who had been executed in 1937–1938 inquired about their fate, they were told by NKVD that their arrested relatives had been sentenced to &quot;10 years without the right of correspondence&quot; (десять лет без права переписки). When these ten-year periods elapsed in 1947–1948 but the arrested did not appear, the relatives asked MGB about their fate again and this time were told that the arrested died in imprisonment.

==Western reactions==
Although the trials of former Soviet leaders were widely publicized, the hundreds of thousands of other arrests and executions were not. These became known in the West only as a few former gulag inmates reached the West with their stories. Not only did foreign correspondents from the West fail to report on the purges, but in many Western nations (especially France), attempts were made to silence or discredit these witnesses; according to Robert Conquest, Jean-Paul Sartre took the position that evidence of the camps should be ignored so the French proletariat would not be discouraged. A series of legal actions ensued at which definitive evidence was presented that established the validity of the former labor camp inmates&#x27; testimony.

According to Robert Conquest in his 1968 book &quot;The Great Terror: Stalin&#x27;s Purge of the Thirties&quot;, with respect to the trials of former leaders, some Western observers were unintentionally or intentionally ignorant of the fraudulent nature of the charges and evidence, notably Walter Duranty of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, a Russian speaker; the American Ambassador, Joseph E. Davies, who reported, &quot;proof ... beyond reasonable doubt to justify the verdict of treason&quot;; and Beatrice and Sidney Webb, authors of &quot;Soviet Communism: A New Civilization&quot;. While &quot;Communist Parties everywhere simply transmitted the Soviet line&quot;, some of the most critical reporting also came from the left, notably &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;. The American journalist H. R. Knickerbocker also reported on the executions. He called them in 1941 &quot;the great purges&quot;, and described how over four years they affected &quot;the top fourth or fifth, to estimate it conservatively, of the Party itself, of the Army, Navy, and Air Force leaders and then of the new Bolshevik intelligentsia, the foremost technicians, managers, supervisors, scientists&quot;. Knickerbocker also wrote about dekulakization: &quot;It is a conservative estimate to say that some 5,000,000 [kulaks] ... died at once, or within a few years.&quot;

Evidence and the results of research began to appear after Stalin&#x27;s death. This revealed the full enormity of the Purges. The first of these sources were the revelations of Nikita Khrushchev, which particularly affected the American editors of the Communist Party USA newspaper, the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;, who, following the lead of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, published the Secret Speech in full.

==Rehabilitation==


The Great Purge was denounced by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev following Stalin&#x27;s death. In his secret speech to the 20th CPSU congress in February 1956 (which was made public a month later), Khrushchev referred to the purges as an &quot;abuse of power&quot; by Stalin which resulted in enormous harm to the country. In the same speech, he recognized that many of the victims were innocent and were convicted on the basis of false confessions extracted by torture. Khrushchev later claimed in his memoirs that he had initiated the process, overcoming objections and protests from the rest of Party leadership, but the transcripts belie this, although they show differences of opinion regarding the contents.

Starting from 1954, some of the convictions were overturned. Mikhail Tukhachevsky and other generals convicted in the Trial of Red Army Generals were declared innocent (&quot;rehabilitated&quot;) in 1957. The former Politburo members Yan Rudzutak and Stanislav Kosior and many lower-level victims were also declared innocent in the 1950s. Nikolai Bukharin and others convicted in the Moscow Trials were not rehabilitated until as late as 1988. Leon Trotsky, considered a major player in the Russian Revolution and a major contributor to Marxist theory, was never rehabilitated by the USSR. The book &quot;Rehabilitation: The Political Processes of the 1930s–50s&quot; (Реабилитация. Политические процессы 30–50-х годов) (1991) contains a large amount of newly presented original archive material: transcripts of interrogations, letters of convicts, and photos. The material demonstrates in detail how numerous show trials were fabricated.

==Number of people executed==

Official figures put the total number of documentable executions during the years 1937 and 1938 at 681,692, in addition to 116,000 deaths in the Gulag, and 2,000 unofficially killed in non-article 58 shootings; whereas the total estimate of deaths brought about by Soviet repression during the Great Purge ranges from 950,000 to 1.2 million, which includes executions, deaths in detention and those who died shortly after being released from the Gulag, as a result of their treatment therein. There were also 16,500 to 50,000 deaths in the deportation of Soviet Koreans which correspond to the purge.
According to Robert Conquest, a practice of falsification for lowering the execution numbers was disguising executions with the sentence &quot;10 years without the right of correspondence&quot; which almost always meant execution. All of the bodies identified from the mass graves at Vinnitsa and Kuropaty were of individuals who had received this sentence. Despite this, the lower figure did roughly confirm Conquest&#x27;s original 1968 estimate of 700,000 &quot;legal&quot; executions and in the preface to the 40th anniversary edition of &quot;The Great Terror&quot;, Conquest claimed that he had been &quot;correct on the vital matter—the numbers put to death: about one million&quot;.

According to J. Arch Getty and Oleg V. Naumov, &quot;popular estimates of executions in the great purges vary from 500,000 to 7 million.&quot; However, according to them, &quot;the archival evidence from the secret police rejects the astronomically high estimates often given for the number of terror victims&quot; and &quot;the data available at this point make it clear that the number shot in the two worst purge years [1937–38] was more likely in the hundreds of thousands than in the millions.&quot; According to historian Corrina Kuhr, 700,000 people were executed during the Great Purge out of the 2.5 million who were arrested. Professor Nérard François-Xavier estimates the same number of people who were sentenced to death; however, he states that 1.3 million people were arrested.

The Soviets themselves made their own estimates with Vyacheslav Molotov saying &quot;The report written by that commission member…says that 1,370,000 arrests were made in the 1930s. That&#x27;s too many. I responded that the figures should be thoroughly reviewed&quot;.

==Stalin&#x27;s role==
Historians with archival access have confirmed that Stalin was intimately involved in the purge. Russian historian Oleg V. Khlevniuk states &quot;theories about the elemental, spontaneous nature of the terror, about a loss of central control over the course of mass repression, and about the role of regional leaders in initiating the terror are simply not supported by the historical record&quot;. Besides signing Yezhov&#x27;s lists, Stalin sometimes gave instructions concerning certain individuals. In one instance, he told Yezhov &quot;Isn&#x27;t it time to squeeze this gentleman and force him to report on his dirty little business? Where is he: in a prison or a hotel?&quot; In another, while reviewing one of Yezhov&#x27;s lists, he added to M. I. Baranov&#x27;s name, &quot;beat, beat!&quot; Stalin also signed 357 lists in 1937 and 1938 authorizing executions of some 40,000 people, and about 90% of these are confirmed to have been shot, this was 7.4% of those executed legally. While reviewing one such list, Stalin reportedly muttered to no one in particular: &quot;Who&#x27;s going to remember all this riff-raff in ten or twenty years time? No one. Who remembers the names now of the boyars Ivan the Terrible got rid of? No one.&quot; Stalin had ordered for 100,000 Buddhist lamas in Mongolia to be liquidated but the political leader Peljidiin Genden resisted the order.

It is quite possible that Yezhov misled Stalin about the aspects of the purge process. Many people at the time, and also a few subsequent commentators, surmised that the Great Purge wasn&#x27;t started by Stalin&#x27;s initiative, so the idea got about that the process was entirely out of control once it had begun. Stalin may have failed to anticipate the catastrophic excesses of the NKVD under Yezhov. Stalin also objected to the large numbers of people that Yezhov was purging. For example, when Yezhov announced that 200,000 party members were expelled, Stalin interrupted him, said that they were &quot;very many&quot; and suggested instead to only expel 30,000 and 600 former Trotskyists and Zinovievists which &quot;would be a bigger victory&quot;.

Stephen G. Wheatcroft posits that while the &#x27;purposive deaths&#x27; caused by Hitler constitute &#x27;murder&#x27;, those caused under Stalin fall into the category of &#x27;execution&#x27;, although in terms of &quot;causing death by criminal neglect and ruthlessness (...) Stalin probably exceeded Hitler&quot;. Wheatcroft elaborates:

Stalin undoubtedly caused many innocent people to be executed, but it seems likely that he thought many of them guilty of crimes against the state and felt that the execution of others would act as a deterrent to the guilty. He signed the papers and insisted on documentation. Hitler, by contrast, wanted to be rid of the Jews and communists simply because they were Jews and communists. He was not concerned about making any pretence at legality. He was careful not to sign anything on this matter and was equally insistent on no documentation.

==Soviet investigation commissions==
At least two Soviet commissions investigated the show-trials after Stalin&#x27;s death. The first was headed by Molotov and included Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Suslov, Furtseva, Shvernik, Aristov, Pospelov, and Rudenko. They were given the task to investigate the materials concerning Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and others. The commission worked in 1956–1957. While stating that the accusations against Tukhachevsky &quot;et al.&quot; should be abandoned, it failed to fully rehabilitate the victims of the three Moscow trials, although the final report does contain an admission that the accusations have not been proven during the trials and &quot;evidence&quot; had been produced by lies, blackmail, and &quot;use of physical influence&quot;. Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, and others were still seen as political opponents, and though the charges against them were obviously false, they could not have been rehabilitated because &quot;for many years they headed the anti-Soviet struggle against the building of socialism in USSR&quot;.

The second commission largely worked from 1961 to 1963 and was headed by Shvernik (&quot;Shvernik Commission&quot;). It included Shelepin, Serdyuk, Mironov, Rudenko, and Semichastny. The hard work resulted in two massive reports, which detailed the mechanism of falsification of the show-trials against Bukharin, Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and many others. The commission based its findings in large part on eyewitness testimonies of former NKVD workers and victims of repressions, and on many documents. The commission recommended rehabilitating every accused with the exceptions of Radek and Yagoda, because Radek&#x27;s materials required some further checking, and Yagoda was a criminal and one of the falsifiers of the trials (though most of the charges against him had to be dropped too, he was not a &quot;spy&quot;, etc.). The commission stated:

Stalin committed a very grave crime against the Communist party, the socialist state, Soviet people and worldwide revolutionary movement...Together with Stalin, the responsibility for the abuse of law, mass unwarranted repressions and death of many thousands of wholly innocent people also lies on Molotov, Kaganovich, Malenkov...

Molotov stated, &quot;We would have been complete idiots if we had taken the reports at their face value. We were not idiots.&quot; He also said, &quot;[T]he cases were reviewed and some people were released.&quot;

==Mass graves and memorials==
In the late 1980s, with the formation of the Memorial Society and similar organisations across the Soviet Union at a time of Gorbachev&#x27;s glasnost (&quot;openness and transparency&quot;) it became possible not only to speak about the Great Terror but to begin locating the killing grounds of 1937–1938 and identifying those who lay buried there.

In 1988, for instance, the mass graves at Kurapaty in Belarus were the site of a clash between demonstrators and the police. In 1990, a boulder stone was brought from the former Solovki prison camp in the White Sea, and erected next to KGB headquarters in Moscow as a memorial to all &quot;the victims of political repression&quot; since 1917.

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, many more mass graves filled with executed victims of the terror were discovered and turned into memorial sites. Some, such as the Bykivnia killing fields near Kyiv, are said to contain up to 200,000 corpses.

In 2007, one such site, the Butovo firing range near Moscow, was turned into a shrine to the victims of Stalinism. Between August 1937 and October 1938, more than 20,000 people were shot and buried there.

In 2016, the Joffe Foundation in St Petersburg launched a website, the Map of Memory (&quot;Russia&#x27;s Necropolis of Terror and the Gulag&quot;) which recorded the location and current use of 411 burial grounds and commemorative sites across Russia linked to forced resettlement, deportation, the Gulag and 149 secret execution and burial sites.

On 30 October 2017, President Vladimir Putin opened the Wall of Sorrow, an official but controversial recognition of the crimes of the Soviet regime.

In August 2021, a mass grave containing between 5,000 and 8,000 skeletons was discovered in Odesa, Ukraine, during exploration works for a planned expansion of Odesa International Airport. The graves are believed to date back to the late 1930s during the purge.

==Historical interpretations==
The Great Purge has provoked numerous debates about its purpose, scale, and mechanisms. According to one interpretation, Stalin&#x27;s regime had to maintain its citizens in a state of fear and uncertainty to stay in power (Brzezinski, 1958). Robert Conquest emphasized Stalin&#x27;s paranoia, focused on the Moscow show trial of &quot;Old Bolsheviks&quot;, and analyzed the carefully planned and systematic destruction of the Communist Party. Some others view the Great Purge as a crucial moment, or rather the culmination, of a vast social engineering campaign started at the beginning of the 1930s (Hagenloh, 2000; Shearer, 2003; Werth, 2003). According to an October 1993 study published in &quot;The American Historical Review&quot;, much of the Great Purge was directed against the widespread banditry and criminal activity which was occurring in the Soviet Union at the time. 

Historian Isaac Deutscher regarded the Moscow trials &quot;as the prelude to the destruction of an entire generation of revolutionaries&quot;.

Leon Trotsky viewed the excessive violence characteristic of the mass purges as an ideological differentiation between Stalinism and Bolshevism. He summarised his view:

&quot;The present purge draws between Bolshevism and Stalinism not simply a bloody line but a whole river of blood. The annihilation of all the older generation of Bolsheviks, an important part of the middle generation which participated in the civil war, and that part of the youth that took up most seriously the Bolshevik traditions, shows not only a political but a thoroughly physical incompatibility between Bolshevism and Stalinism. How can this not be seen?&quot;

According to Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s 1956 speech, &quot;On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences&quot;, and to historian Robert Conquest, a great number of accusations, notably those presented at the Moscow show trials, were based on forced confessions, often obtained through torture, and on loose interpretations of Article 58 of the RSFSR Penal Code, which dealt with counter-revolutionary crimes. Due legal process, as defined by Soviet law in force at the time, was often largely replaced with summary proceedings by NKVD troikas. 

Valentin Berezhkov, who became Stalin&#x27;s interpreter in 1941, suggests parallels in his memoir between Hitler&#x27;s inner party purge and Stalin&#x27;s mass repressions of Old Bolsheviks, military commanders and intellectuals. 

According to historian James Harris, contemporary archival research pokes &quot;rather large holes in the traditional story&quot; weaved by Conquest and others. His findings, while not exonerating Stalin or the Soviet state, dispel the notion that the bloodletting was merely the result of Stalin attempting to establish his own personal dictatorship; evidence suggests he was committed to building the socialist state envisioned by Lenin. The real motivation for the terror, according to Harris, was an exaggerated fear of counterrevolution:

So what was the motivation behind the Terror? The answers required a lot more digging, but it gradually became clearer that the violence of the late 1930s was driven by fear. Most Bolsheviks, Stalin among them, believed that the revolutions of 1789, 1848 and 1871 had failed because their leaders hadn&#x27;t adequately anticipated the ferocity of the counter-revolutionary reaction from the establishment. They were determined not to make the same mistake.

Two major lines of interpretation have emerged among historians. One argues that the purges reflected Stalin&#x27;s ambitions, his paranoia, and his inner drive to increase his power and eliminate potential rivals. Revisionist historians explain the purges by theorizing that rival factions exploited Stalin&#x27;s paranoia and used terror to enhance their own position. Peter Whitewood examines the first purge, directed at the Army, and comes up with a third interpretation that Stalin and other top leaders believing that they were always surrounded by capitalist enemies, always worried about the vulnerability and loyalty of the Red Army. It was not a ploy—Stalin truly believed it. &quot;Stalin attacked the Red Army because he seriously misperceived a serious security threat&quot;; thus &quot;Stalin seems to have genuinely believed that foreign‐backed enemies had infiltrated the ranks and managed to organize a conspiracy at the very heart of the Red Army.&quot; The purge hit deeply from June 1937 and November 1938, removing 35,000; many were executed. Experience in carrying out the purge facilitated purging other key elements in the wider Soviet polity. Historians often cite the disruption as factors in the Red Army&#x27;s disastrous military performance during the German invasion. Robert W. Thurston reports that the purge was not intended to subdue the Soviet masses, many of whom helped enact the purge, but to deal with opposition to Stalin&#x27;s rule among the Soviet elites.

<doc id="137842" wikidata="Q958596" url="?curid=137842" title="Wenatchee, Washington">
<text>Wenatchee ( ) is the county seat and most populous city of Chelan County, Washington, United States. The population within the city limits in 2010 was 31,925, and has increased to 35,508 as of 2020. Located in the north-central part of the state, at the confluence of the Columbia and Wenatchee rivers near the eastern foothills of the Cascade Range, Wenatchee lies on the western side of the Columbia River, across from the city of East Wenatchee. The Columbia River forms the boundary between Chelan and Douglas County. Wenatchee is the principal city of the Wenatchee–East Wenatchee, Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses all of Chelan and Douglas counties (total population around 110,884). However, the &quot;Wenatchee Valley Area&quot; generally refers to the land between Rocky Reach and Rock Island Dam on both banks of the Columbia, which includes East Wenatchee, Rock Island, and Malaga, as well as the surrounding towns of Monitor and Cashmere to the west of Wenatchee.

The city was named for the nearby Wenatchi Native American people. The name is a Sahaptin word that means &quot;river which comes [or whose source is] from canyons&quot; or &quot;robe of the rainbow&quot;. &quot;Awenatchela&quot; means &quot;people at the source [of a river]&quot;. The city of Wenatchee shares its name with the Wenatchee River, Lake Wenatchee and the Wenatchee National Forest.

Wenatchee is referred to as the &quot;Apple Capital of the World&quot; due to the valley&#x27;s many orchards. The city is also sometimes referred to as the &quot;Buckle of the Power Belt of the Great Northwest&quot; which is a metaphor for the series of hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River. Rock Island Dam is located nearest to the middle of this &quot;belt&quot;, and so was labeled the &quot;Buckle&quot;. This saying is printed at the top of every issue of Wenatchee&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Wenatchee World&quot;, but is no longer in common use elsewhere.

==History==

===Prehistoric era===
Archeological digs in nearby East Wenatchee have uncovered Clovis stone and bone tools dating back more than 11,000 years, indicating that people migrating during the last Ice Age spent time in the Wenatchee area. The Columbia River and nearby mountains and sagebrush steppes provided an ample supply of food. Clovis points are on display at the Wenatchee Valley Museum &amp; Cultural Center and research findings are available through the &quot;Wenatchee World&quot;.

===Indigenous villages and early settlers===
Several indigenous villages existed in the area prior to and during Anglo American exploration. The village Nikwikwi&#x27;estku was a fishing and gathering camp located in present-day downtown Wenatchee. In 1811, North West Company surveyor David Thompson encountered a group of Native American horsemen at Wenatchee and was invited into a village with huts, the largest measuring 209 feet long. Fur traders document friendly relations through the mid 19th century, even during the smallpox epidemic of 1817 and food shortages in 1841.

During the Yakima War in 1856, US Army Colonel Wright intervened on a possible alliance between Yakama and Wenatchi tribes by removing the Wenatchi to Kittitas. The resulting march was estimated to include 1,000 horses and extend five miles long. A contingent stayed behind to fish at Wenatchapam Fishery in preparation for winter.

In 1863, Father Respari, a Catholic priest, began his missionary work with local Native Americans. He was followed some 20 years later by Father De Grassi, who built a log cabin on the Wenatchee River near the present town of Cashmere. Throughout the 19th century, other white settlers came to homestead the land.

Wenatchee was platted in September 1888 and officially incorporated as a city on January 7, 1893. Frank and Belle Reeves founded &quot;The Wenatchee Advance&quot;, the city&#x27;s first newspaper, in 1891. The 1900 U.S. Census counted 451 residents.

===Continued growth===
The Great Northern Railway completed its railroad line between St. Paul, Minnesota, and Seattle in 1893. Its route through the Wenatchee Valley was significant to the development of this region. The railroad not only provided passenger travel to and from Wenatchee, but it provided for freight service for shipments of wheat, apples, and other products to out-of-state markets.

By the early 20th century, the Wenatchee Commercial Club, now the Wenatchee Valley Chamber of Commerce, was advertising the region as the &quot;Home of the World&#x27;s Best Apples.&quot; The tree fruit industry provided the economic backbone for the region for a century and still is an important source of revenue.

On May 22, 1910, the Wenatchee free speech fight occurred when members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) were arrested for speaking in the street in front of the local hall of the Socialist Party of America. The town had freed imprisoned IWW members by June; however, tensions resumed in September 1911 when police raided a house rented by six IWW men and arrested twenty-five migrant workers found carrying IWW literature. Again, the men were all quickly released.

In 1922, a Ku Klux Klan chapter of nearly 100 men demanded that black residents leave on threat of violence. By 1923 they hosted meetings of up to 400 members and burned a large cross above Fancher airfield in East Wenatchee. The Wenatchee chapter hosted the 1926 state Klan convention and marched in the Apple Blossom Parade. In the wave of anti-Filipino sentiment, Filipino immigrant workers were targeted by violence and deportation through the late 1920s.

On October 5, 1931, Clyde Pangborn and his copilot Hugh Herndon landed their airplane, named the &quot;Miss Veedol&quot;, in the hills of East Wenatchee, and thus became the first aviators to fly nonstop across the Pacific Ocean. The 41-hour flight from Sabishiro Beach, Misawa, Aomori Prefecture, Japan, won them the Harmon Trophy for the greatest achievement in flight of 1931. &quot;Miss Veedol&quot;″s propeller is on display at the Wenatchee Valley Museum &amp; Cultural Center.

In 1936, with the completion of Rock Island Dam, Wenatchee was protected from the summer flooding of the Columbia River, and the first of 14 hydroelectric projects on the Columbia began generating electric power. The reservoirs thus generated also made it possible to irrigate hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland in the Columbia Basin.

In 2019, the Wenatchee Valley was named by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine as one of the top 25 places to retire.

===Modern era===
In 1975, Stemilt Growers moved its headquarters from nearby Stemilt Hill to Olds Station, Wenatchee. The company grows, packs and ships tree fruit. It went on to become the largest fresh market sweet cherry shipper in the world.

Every year from the last week of April to the end of the first week of May, Wenatchee hosts the Washington State Apple Blossom Festival, which probably brings in the largest number of people Wenatchee sees annually, with the exception of migrant workers travelling for harvest. It features two relatively large parades: the Apple Blossom Youth Parade on the last Saturday in April and the Apple Blossom Grand Parade on the first Saturday in May, a food fair representing cuisine from around the world, and a traveling carnival.

The Wenatchee child abuse prosecutions in Wenatchee, Washington, also known as the &quot;Wenatchee Witch Hunt&quot;, that occurred in 1994 and 1995, are examples of the hysteria over child molestation in the 1980s and early 1990s.

In the early 1990s Wenatchee had a reputation as the &quot;happy pill town&quot; and &quot;Happy Valley&quot;, with psychologist James Goodwin, &quot;the Pied Piper of Prozac&quot;.

According to CNN&#x27;s &quot;Money Magazine&quot;, Wenatchee had the second fastest forecast real estate value growth in the country for June 2006–June 2007. In November 2018, USA Today listed Wenatchee as experiencing the 22nd highest employment growth in the country.

On July 29, 2013, a large wildfire spreading over south of Wenatchee occurred, affecting over 40 nearby homes.

The Riverfront Park Ice Arena closed its doors in July 2008, and Awaken Church was later opened at the site.

The Wenatchee Valley also boasts one of only two aluminum smelters remaining in the Northwestern United States, at the Alcoa plant in Malaga. The plant announced in November 2015 that it would be shutting down operations on January 5, 2016. Other growing areas of the regional economy are tourism and information technology.

Wenatchee Pride began organizing LGBT Pride festivals 2017. The 2023 festival was held at Memorial Park with an estimated 4,000 attendance.

==Geography==

Wenatchee is located at the confluence of the Wenatchee and Columbia rivers in the Columbia Basin, just east of the foothills of the Cascade Range. Irrigation from the Columbia River and its tributaries allows for the large amount of agriculture in Wenatchee and the surrounding areas.

The city of Wenatchee is bordered by the Wenatchee River on the north, the Columbia River to the east, and the Wenatchee Mountains to the south and west. These ridges and peaks form a wall around the western and southern sides of the city. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

=== Climate ===
Wenatchee experiences a semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;) with cold winters and hot, dry summers.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===
The 2020 U.S. census counted 35,508 people, 13,793 households, and 8,445 families in Wenatchee. The population density was 3,357.4 per square mile (1,296.3/km).

===Railroad===

Wenatchee is in the major railroad line of the BNSF Railway (formerly Great Northern Railway) to Seattle. Wenatchee was once the eastern terminus of the Great Northern electric-driven train service (1928/1929–1956) on its New Cascade Tunnel route via the Chumstick Valley, which went all the way to Skykomish. There, steam locomotives or diesel locomotives replaced electric locomotives along this route, as well as having a maintenance base for the electric locomotives. Today, Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Empire Builder&quot; passenger train serves Wenatchee at Columbia Station. The Cascade and Columbia River short line freight railroad interfaces with BNSF in Wenatchee, and runs north to Okanogan and further north to Oroville.

On August 6, 1974, a tank car belonging to Burlington Northern (now BNSF) exploded in the Appleyard Terminal in south Wenatchee, killing 2 people.

<doc id="137847" wikidata="Q226013" url="?curid=137847" title="Forks, Washington">
<text>Forks, also previously known as the unincorporated town of Quillayute, is a city in southwest Clallam County, Washington, United States. The population was 3,335 at the 2020 census. It is named after the forks in the nearby Bogachiel, Calawah, and Sol Duc rivers which join to form the Quillayute River.

For much of the 20th century, the city&#x27;s economy was fueled by the local timber industry. Forks later became a tourism destination for visitors to Olympic National Park, recreational sport fishing in nearby rivers, and fans of the novel series &quot;Twilight&quot; and films, which are set in Forks. The town is also near the Clallam Bay Corrections Center and Olympic Corrections Center.

==History==

===Indigenous settlement===

Forks was once inhabited by the Quileute Native American tribe, before they ceded their territory. In 1889 a reservation was created near Forks; that same year the village was burnt down by settler Daniel Pullen. Forks is 12 miles from tribal burning areas that area tribes used to regenerate young ferns. The phrase &quot;prairie upstream&quot; from Quileute language was translated and became the name Forks Prairie.

===Early settlement===

The first European American settlers in the modern-day Forks Prairie arrived in the 1860s by following the waterways in and around the Olympic Peninsula due to a lack of overland trails. A proposal to create Quillehuyte County from the western sides of Clallam and Jefferson counties was accepted by the territorial legislature in 1868 but dissolved a year later. The first homestead on the prairie was claimed in January 1878 by Luther and Esther Ford. Their property included the first dairy in the area, set up in 1879, and was later joined by other homesteads. A post office opened in the cabin of Ole Nelson, a local trapper, in 1884 and was named &quot;Forks&quot;; their preferred name &quot;Ford&#x27;s Prairie&quot; had already been taken by another settlement in the territory. The name &quot;Forks&quot; was chosen for the forks of three nearby rivers.

Rudimentary trails and roads were built by settlers in the 1880s and 1890s to create trade routes; the nearest markets were in Port Townsend and later Port Angeles, but the seasonal supply boats were unable to take large cargo. Timber around the prairie was cleared by settlers and small-time loggers in the late 19th century. They were followed by timber companies, including Merrill &amp; Ring around the Pysht River in 1916, until the Olympic Forest Reserve was established in 1897 by the federal government. The forest reserve was gradually reduced in size but later contributed most of the land for Olympic National Monument (now Olympic National Park), which was established in 1909, and the Olympic National Forest. Logging of non-federal land continued, but slowed during the 1907 national recession. The U.S. Army sought to use the region&#x27;s Sitka spruce to construct airplanes during World War I and built a railroad to Port Angeles to aid in transport; the railroad was not used due to the end of the war.

he Mora post moved to Forks in the early 1890s which consisted of a general store, hardware store, and a hotel. In the early 1900s, hop growing declined and the Forks Cooperative Creamery was established which operated for 70 years. The town of Forks was platted in 1912 on the homestead of Merrill Whittier, a hop farmer. It served as the economic center of the area between the Hoh River and Quillayute Prairie but only had a single block of buildings in its first decade. A fire on January 10, 1925, destroyed six buildings on the west side of the town; they were replaced later in the year along with plans for a new high school and social halls. A new road passable for automobiles opened from Lake Crescent to Forks in 1927 and was replaced by the Olympic Loop Highway (US 101) in 1931. Another fire on Main Street in 1930 caused further damage.

===Modern history===
Forks was officially incorporated on August 7, 1945, following an election of the constituents who would become its first town members.

The local timber industry boomed from the 1950s to 1970s, earning Forks the self-proclaimed title of &quot;Logging Capital of the World.&quot; Changes in environmental policy led to a significant decline in the timber industry in the 1980s and 1990s. Timber harvesting is still part of the local economy, but at levels far below the peak of the 1970s.

The city gained popularity for being a key setting in Stephenie Meyer&#x27;s &quot;Twilight&quot; series (2005 to 2008) and related film adaptations (2008 to 2012).

On the south end of town is the . Constructed in 1989 by the Forks High School carpentry class, the building provides a look into the local history of the timber industry, loggers of the past, and their tools of the trade. The museum has exhibits depicting local history dating to the 1870s.

Forks serves as the hub for numerous day excursions to the Hoh Rainforest, the Pacific Beaches, and various wilderness trails. Forks is well known for its winter steelhead fishing with the Quillayute river system – the Hoh, Sol Duc, Bogachiel and Calawah rivers. Other nearby Clallam, Sekiu, and Hoko rivers are also good for king salmon fishing and steelheading as well. Local guides are available for both native and hatchery runs and for float trips. Fishing gear and clothing is available at local stores.

Another source of tourism is Stephenie Meyer&#x27;s &quot;Twilight&quot; series, which she set in the town after searching Google for rainy settings. Tours are available of locations that resemble the places described in Meyer&#x27;s books. The majority of the films were not shot in Forks, though key scenes were shot in the town and surrounding area.

In December 2005, 74 visitors signed the guest book at the Forks Visitor Center; after the release of the &quot;Twilight&quot; series this increased substantially, with 2540 visitors signing in to the center in December 2009. In July of that year, the number was 16,186. The average annual number of tourists visiting the town rose from 10,000 before &quot;Twilight&quot; to 19,000 in 2008, the year of the first film, and 73,000 by 2010.

==Tillicum Park==
Forks displays one of a few Shay engines remaining in Washington. Shay locomotives are unusual in that they have a crank shaft running down the side, powering all wheels. They were designed to be used to transport lumber out of forests. Rayonier #10 (c/n 3348) was built for stock by Lima in 1930. It has three cylinders and three trucks. The Ozette Timber Company bought it 11 years later. In 1945 it was acquired by Rayonier for their lumber operation near Forks. It was retired near the north end of Forks in Tillicum Park in 1959.

The Forks Lions Club erected an attractive shelter over the #10 in 1999. It has also built and maintained most of the structures in the Shay Tillicum Park over the last 40 years.

==Community events==

Rainfest, a celebration of the arts sponsored by the West Olympic Council for the Arts, occurs in April. It includes a combination of arts and craft related events. In recent years quilt classes and a quilt show have been sponsored by the Piece Makers Quilt Club.

In March of every year, the Quillayute Valley Scholarship Auction occurs. This annual fundraising event raises tens of thousands of dollars for scholarships. Since the first scholarship award in 1964, to Robert Henry (now D.D.S.), the committee has awarded over US$1m in scholarships to Forks students.

In the summer, Forks hosts its traditional &quot;Old Fashioned Fourth of July&quot; celebration with a Grand Fourth of July Parade. The numerous events include a demolition derby and fireworks display. July is also the month for Quileute Days at La Push with its parade, traditional salmon bake, bone games, softball tournament, canoe races, and street fair. In August, the Forks Family Festival combines arts and crafts vendors with children activities.

In late September, the Forks Chamber of Commerce partners with the Quileute Tribe and the City of Forks to host the Last Chance Fishing Derby at La Push; cash prizes are offered to those wanting to fish for salmon on the Pacific Ocean. The first week in October is when the community celebrates its heritage during Heritage Days. One of the more celebrated events during this week-long festival is the &quot;Old Timers Round Table;&quot; this is a moderated conversation broadcast live via the local radio station, featuring longtime residents of the region talking about days long past.

The Forks City Council passed a resolution in 2007 celebrating Stephenie Meyer Day in honor of the &quot;Twilight&quot; young adult novels and film series, set for September 13, the day of the fictional Bella&#x27;s birthday. In 2015 the event was still driving tourism, with visitor numbers peaking in 2010, then settling to 50% more than before the &quot;Twilight&quot; phenomenon.
Stephenie Meyer Day has been replaced with the Forever Twilight in Forks Festival which is still celebrated annually on the week of September 13. The festival includes a movie marathon, a blood drive, and dance lessons.

<text>Neah Bay is a census-designated place (CDP) on the Makah Reservation in Clallam County, Washington, United States. The population was 935 at the 2020 census. It is across the Canada–US border from British Columbia. Europeans originally called it &quot;Scarborough Harbour&quot; in honor of Captain James Scarborough of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. It was changed to Neah in 1847 by Captain Henry Kellett. Kellett spelled it &quot;Neeah Bay&quot;. The name &quot;Neah&quot; refers to the Makah Chief Dee-ah, pronounced Neah in the Klallam language. During the summer months, Neah Bay is a popular fishing area for sports fishermen. Another attraction is the Makah Museum, which houses artifacts from a Makah village partly buried by a mudslide around 1750. Many people also visit to hike the Cape Trail or camp at Hobuck Beach. An emergency response tug is stationed at Neah Bay which has saved 41 vessels since its introduction in 1999.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Neah Bay has a total area of , all of it land. The community is approximately west-northwest of Seattle.

===Climate===
Neah Bay has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), common in the small coastal cities of Washington. Generally speaking, temperatures have little annual fluctuation being strongly influenced by the Pacific Ocean, with the warm currents and patterns of the west as well as the mountains to the east that shape an extremely light climate, even between places in close conditions. Its climate is similar to southern New Zealand, but with cool summers to cold and rarely warm as it is most common in these places. To the west of the Olympic Mountains, Neah Bay has an often rainy climate and usually in larger numbers than the Gulf Coast, the wettest place in the eastern US. Although it is a pretty damp city, its average amount of snow falling is only slightly higher than Norfolk, VA. Sunshine hours are typical for an often hazy temperate climate. Climate data is taken from a weather station on nearby Tatoosh Island.

==History==

The name &quot;Neah&quot; refers to the Makah Chief Dee-ah, pronounced Neah in the Klallam language. The town is named for the water body Neah Bay, which acquired its name in the early 19th century. A number of names were used for the bay before it was established as Neah Bay. In August 1788 Captain Charles Duncan, a British trader, charted a bay at the location of Neah Bay, but did not give it a name. In 1790 Manuel Quimper took possession of the bay for Spain and named it &quot;Bahía de Núñez Gaona&quot; in honor of Alonso Núñez de Haro y Peralta, viceroy of New Spain. In 1792 Salvador Fidalgo began to build a Spanish fort on Neah Bay, but the project failed within the year and the cannon and supplies were transported to the more northerly colony of Santa Cruz de Nuca. While Fidalgo was working on the fort George Vancouver charted but did not stop at the bay. American traders called Neah Bay &quot;Poverty Cove&quot;. In 1841 the United States Exploring Expedition under Charles Wilkes mapped the region and named Neah Bay &quot;Scarborough Harbour&quot; in honor of Captain James Scarborough of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, who had provided assistance to the expedition. The Wilkes map contained the first use of the word &quot;Neah&quot;, but for the bay&#x27;s island, now called Waadah Island. The bay was first called Neah in 1847 by Captain Henry Kellett during his reorganization of the British Admiralty charts. Kellett spelled it &quot;Neeah Bay&quot;.
In 1929, the Neah Bay Dock Company, a subsidiary of the Puget Sound Navigation Company, owned a wharf and a hotel at Neah Bay.

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Neah Bay and the Makah Reservation were closed to anyone who was not a Makah tribal member. The tribal council decided to reopen the reservation on 15 March 2022.

== Economy ==
The local economy is sustained mostly by fishing and tourism. During the summer Neah Bay is a popular fishing area for sports fishermen. Any visitor to the Makah land must buy a recreational permit for US$20. The permit is good for the calendar year.

Fishing for bottom fish, such as ling cod, kelp greenling, black rockfish (sea bass), china rockfish, yellow eye and canary rockfish, among others. Ling cod fishing is good in spring and summer, while salmon fishing is good during summer runs. However, Neah Bay is mostly known for the best halibut fishing in the lower 48 states. The United States halibut season generally lasts a handful of days in May and June, ending when a seasonal quota is attained. When the United States halibut season is closed, some fishermen obtain Canadian fishing licenses and launch from Neah Bay, running approximately to the portion of Swiftsure Bank that lies in Canadian waters.

Popular spots for halibut include &quot;The Garbage Dump&quot;, located just inside the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and Swiftsure Bank — a few miles out into the open ocean. Larger boats (including many of the commercial charter boats available) often travel or more into the open ocean, to such places as Blue Dot and 72-Square.

==Arts and culture==
Neah Bay&#x27;s significant attraction is the Makah Museum. It houses and interprets artifacts from a Makah village partly buried by a mudslide around 1750 at Ozette, providing a snapshot of pre-contact tribal life. The museum includes a replica longhouse, canoes, basketry and whaling and fishing gear. Many people visit Neah Bay to hike the Cape Trail or camp at Hobuck Beach. While camping, tourists spend time surfing and fishing.

== Coast Guard ==
The United States Coast Guard maintains a base in Neah Bay on the Makah Indian reservation. The base is maintained for search and rescue, environmental protection and maritime law enforcement operations.

The Coast Guard cutter stationed in Cleveland, Ohio is named the &quot;Neah Bay&quot; (WTGB-105).

===Response tug===
In order to prevent disabled ships and barges from grounding and causing possible oil spills in the western Strait of Juan de Fuca or off the outer coast, the state funded an emergency response tug stationed at Neah Bay. It has saved 41 vessels since its introduction in 1999.

<text>Port Angeles ( ) is a city and county seat of Clallam County, Washington, United States. The population was 19,960 at the 2020 census, it is the most populous city in the county, as well as the most populous city on the Olympic Peninsula. The population was estimated at 20,101 in 2023.

The city&#x27;s harbor was dubbed (Port of Our Lady of the Angels) by Spanish explorer in 1791. By the mid-19th century, after settlement by English speakers from the United States, the name was shortened and partially anglicized to its current form, Port Angeles Harbor.

Port Angeles is home to Peninsula College. It is the birthplace of football hall of famer John Elway and residents include writers and other celebrities. The city is served by William R. Fairchild International Airport. Ferry service is provided across the Strait of Juan de Fuca to Victoria, British Columbia, Canada on the MV &quot;Coho&quot;.

==History==

This area was long occupied by succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples. In 1791, the harbor was entered by Spanish explorer , who named it (Port of Our Lady of the Angels), claiming it for Spain. He was on an expedition from southern California. This name was shortened to the current one of Port Angeles.

It was not until the 19th century that European Americans began to settle here. A small whaling, fishing and shipping village developed, which traded with Victoria, British Columbia. In 1856–57, the first settlers arrived and were followed by the Cherbourg Land Company in 1859.

Soon afterwards the site caught the attention of Victor Smith. Smith, a protege of Salmon Chase, was Collector of Customs for the Puget Sound District. He quickly gained approval to relocate the U.S. Customs port of entry for Washington Territory from Port Townsend to Port Angeles. With Chase&#x27;s support, he also succeeded in getting President Abraham Lincoln to designate at Port Angeles as a federal reserve for lighthouse, military and naval purposes. 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers platted a federal town site on the reserve land, laying out the street plan which still exists today. The fact that Washington, D.C., was the only other city officially laid out by the federal government led the U.S. Board of Trade in 1890 to dub Port Angeles the &quot;Second National City.&quot; Settlers soon followed slowly, but Smith&#x27;s death in the sinking of the &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot; led to the loss of interest in the area. The Port of Entry was returned to Port Townsend and the area sank into obscurity until the 1880s.

In 1884, a hotel was built and the trading post was expanded into the area&#x27;s first general store. A wharf was soon built upon the site where the current ferry pier stands. A village of 300 in 1886, Port Angeles&#x27; population grew to 3,000 by 1890. Hundreds of its new residents were part of the Puget Sound Cooperative Colony, which was established in 1887 and built several of the settlement&#x27;s first permanent civic facilities, including a sawmill, church, office building, and opera house. The town was incorporated on June 11, 1890, and was named the county seat of Clallam County later that year. A depression a few years later was weathered and the town continued to grow into the new century. In 1914, large-scale logging began with construction of a large mill and a railway connecting the hinterlands to the mill. Other mills were soon built and the lumber and pulp mills supported the economy of the area until well into the century.

Tourism became increasingly important as the growing national affluence, and especially the 1961 opening of the Hood Canal Bridge that cut driving time from the populated central Puget Sound region, brought more visitors drawn by the mountains, rivers, and rainforest of Olympic National Park and by fishing and boating along the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The mills began to close in the 1970s and 1980s until only one pulp mill remained in operation; the Rayonier specialty pulp mill was shuttered in 1997.

In August 2003, a $275 million construction project known as the Graving Dock Project was started in Port Angeles near the water as part of the Hood Canal Bridge east-half replacement project. It was intended to construct an area for anchoring pontoons for the bridge. During construction, human remains and artifacts were discovered. This site was found to be the &quot;largest prehistoric Indian village and burial ground found in the United States,&quot; according to a senior archaeologist for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Seattle. The archeology site also included Native American burials of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

Archeologists were called in to conduct a professional excavation. They found about 300 graves and 785 pieces of human bones, in addition to numerous ritual and ceremonial Indian artifacts of the former Tse-whit-zen village of the federally recognized Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe. This site had appeared to have been continuously occupied for thousands of years; some of the remains date back at least 8,000 years. Because of the significance of the site for Native American history, in December 2004, the graving dock project was abandoned.

Many of the graves uncovered appeared to hold entire families, who seemed to have died suddenly. Archeologists speculate that this could have been the result of pandemics of smallpox and other infectious illnesses. These caused massive death tolls among Native American populations in 1780 and 1835, as they had no acquired immunity. Infectious diseases contracted from interactions with European fur traders are believed to have killed about 90 percent of the people living in the Northwest before European American settlement of the area.

In 2016, Port Angeles installed two street signs in English and Klallam to revitalize and preserve the area&#x27;s Klallam culture.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The city is situated on the northern edge of the Olympic Peninsula along the shore of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Port Angeles features a long and narrow glacial moraine named Ediz Hook that projects northeasterly nearly three miles into the Strait. Ediz Hook creates a large, natural deep-water harbor shielded from the storms and swells that move predominantly eastward down the Strait from the Pacific Ocean. Coast Guard Air Station / Sector Field Office (SFO) Port Angeles is situated on the end of Ediz Hook. The harbor is deep enough to provide anchorage for large ocean-going ships such as tankers and cruise ships. The south shore of Vancouver Island and the city of Victoria, British Columbia are visible across the Strait to the north.

Port Angeles is located in the rain shadow of the Olympic Mountains, which means the city gets significantly less rain than other areas of western Washington. The average annual precipitation total is approximately , compared to Seattle&#x27;s . Temperatures are moderated by the maritime location, with winter lows rarely below and summer highs rarely above . However, in the winter, the city can be vulnerable to windstorms and Arctic cold fronts that sweep across the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Port Angeles receives about of snow each year, but it rarely stays on the ground for long.

<text>Sequim ( ) is a city in Clallam County, Washington, United States. It is located along the Dungeness River near the base of the Olympic Mountains. The 2020 census counted a population of 8,018, with an estimated population in 2022 of 8,319.

Sequim lies within the rain shadow of the Olympic Mountains and receives, on average, less than of rain per year – about the same as Los Angeles, California – giving rise to the region&#x27;s local nickname of &quot;Sunny Sequim&quot;. However, the city is relatively close to some of the wettest temperate rainforests of the contiguous United States. This climate anomaly is sometimes called the &quot;Blue Hole of Sequim&quot;. Fogs and cool breezes from the Juan de Fuca Strait make Sequim&#x27;s climate more humid than would be expected from the low average rate of annual precipitation.

The city and the surrounding area are particularly known for the commercial cultivation of lavender, supported by the unique climate. It makes Sequim the &quot;Lavender Capital of North America&quot;, rivaled only in France. The area is also known for its Dungeness crab.

==Etymology==

The name Sequim is derived from the Klallam word &quot;sxʷčkʷíyəŋ&quot;, which means &quot;hunting ground&quot; or &quot;place for going to shoot&quot;. It was adopted as the name of the settlement in 1879, with the spelling replacing the earlier &quot;Seguim&quot;. The historic translation of &quot;quiet waters&quot; was disproven in 2010 by linguist Timothy Montler, who had researched the Klallam language and interviewed elders of the Jamestown S&#x27;Klallam Tribe. Sequim is pronounced as one syllable, with the &quot;e&quot; elided: &quot;skwim&quot;; a common mispronounciation is &quot;see-kwim&quot;.

Fossils discovered in the late 1970s – at a dig near Sequim known as the Manis Mastodon site, by Carl Gustafson, an archaeologist at Washington State University – included a mastodon bone with an embedded bone point, evidencing the presence of hunters in the area about 14,000 years ago. According to Michael R. Waters, an archaeologist at Texas A&amp;M University, this is the first hunting weapon found that dates to the pre-Clovis period.

The S&#x27;Klallam tribe had inhabited the region prior to the arrival of the first Europeans. S&#x27;Klallam means &quot;the strong people&quot;. The band of S&#x27;Klallam Indians disbanded into their own individual federally recognized tribes in the early 1900s. The local tribe is the Jamestown S&#x27;Klallam tribe, named after one of their early leaders, Lord James Balch. According to other tales, the town Sequim in S&#x27;Klallam means &quot;a place for going to shoot&quot;, which represents the abundance of game and wildlife of the area. Archeological excavation during construction of the U.S. Route 101 bypass in the 1990s found artifacts that were dated between 6000 to 8000 years before present.

=== Settlement ===
Manuel Quimper and George Vancouver explored the region&#x27;s coast in the 1790s. The first European settlers arrived in the Dungeness Valley in the 1850s, settling nearby Dungeness, Washington. While the lands along the river became fertile farmlands, the remainder of the area remained arid prairie, known as &quot;the desert&quot;. Irrigation canals first brought water to the prairie in the 1890s, allowing the expansion of farmlands.

Sequim was officially incorporated on October 31, 1913. For many decades small farms, mostly dairy farms, dotted the area around the small town. Near the end of World War I, Sequim became a stop for a railway that passed through from Port Angeles to Port Townsend, built primarily to carry wood products from the forests of the western Olympic Peninsula.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The forests around Sequim are dominated by Douglas-fir and western red cedar. Other trees growing in the area include black cottonwood, red alder, bigleaf maple, Pacific madrone, lodgepole pine and Garry oak, all of which can grow to a significant size. Historically, much of the area was an open, oak-studded prairie, supported by somewhat excessively-drained gravelly and sandy loam soil; agriculture and development of the Dungeness valley have changed this ecosystem. Most soils under Sequim have been placed in a series that is named after the city. This &quot;Sequim series&quot; is one of the few Mollisols in western Washington and its high base saturation, a characteristic of the Mollisol order, is attributed to the minimal leaching of bases caused by low annual rainfall.

=== Climate ===
Sequim experiences a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csb&quot;), sometimes classified as an oceanic climate owing to the relatively cool temperatures. Sequim is in the rain shadow of the Olympic Mountains, so annual precipitation is the lowest in the western portion of the state at only 16 inches,
Winters are mostly mild with very little snowfall. Many years there is no snow at all. The highest temperature recorded in Sequim was on 16 July 1941, and the lowest on 19 January 1935.

<text>Battle Ground is a city in Clark County, Washington, United States. The population was 20,743 at the 2020 census. As of 2023, its population is 22,285.

==History==
===Name===
Battle Ground got its name from a standoff between a group of the Klickitat peoples and a military force from the Vancouver Barracks, which had recently transitioned to a U.S. Army post. By 1855, members of the Klickitat peoples had been imprisoned at the Vancouver Barracks. The hostile conditions of their detainment inspired some of the Klickitats to decamp.

This group of Klickitat peoples headed north, led by Chief Umtuch (or Umtux, according to some accounts). When the community at Fort Vancouver discovered this escape, they assembled an armed contingent led by Captain William Strong to pursue the Klickitats. Captain Strong&#x27;s party eventually found the Klickitats near the present-day location of downtown Battle Ground.

Details of the standoff vary. However, accounts agree that Chief Umtuch and Captain Strong engaged in some sort of negotiations, which resulted in the Klickitats agreeing to return to the Barracks. After this decision, at least one shot was fired, resulting in the death of Chief Umtuch, reportedly by one of Captain Strong&#x27;s soldiers..

The Klickitat asked Captain Strong to leave them alone so they might properly bury their chief. After some deliberation, Captain Strong agreed, provided the Klickitats promised to return to the Fort, which they did a couple of days later.

As a result of this event, settlers at the fort began to refer to that site as &#x27;Strong&#x27;s Battle Ground&#x27;, which was later shortened to &#x27;Battle Ground.&#x27; Two schools in Battle Ground were later named after Captain Strong and Chief Umtuch.

<doc id="137858" wikidata="Q1507709" url="?curid=137858" title="Camas, Washington">
<text>Camas is a city in Clark County, Washington, with a population of 26,065 at the 2020 census. The east side of town borders the city of Washougal, Washington, and the west side of town borders Vancouver, Washington. Camas lies along the Washington side of the Columbia River, across from Troutdale, Oregon, and is part of the Portland metropolitan area.

One of the major geographical features of the city is Prune Hill. Prune Hill is an extinct volcanic vent and is part of the Boring Lava Field of northwest Oregon and southwest Washington.

==History==
Officially incorporated on June 18, 1906, the city is named after the camas lily, a plant with an onion-like bulb prized by Native Americans. A paper mill was first established in the city in 1883 with the support of Henry Pittock, a wealthy entrepreneur from England who had settled in Portland, Oregon, where he published &quot;The Oregonian&quot;. At the west end of downtown Camas is the large Georgia-Pacific paper mill from which the high school teams get their name, &quot;the Papermakers&quot;.

By 1971, there had been four attempts to merge Camas and Washougal that were denied by voters.

===Mill history===
Pittock&#x27;s LaCamas Colony bought 2,600 acres in 1883, forming the Columbia River Paper Company the following year to begin production in 1885, before merging with Oregon City&#x27;s Crown Paper Company to form Crown Columbia Paper in 1905. After converting from steam to electricity in 1913, Crown merged with Willamette Paper in 1914 and then with Zellerbach Paper in 1928. Crown Zellerbach became the largest paper manufacturer on the west coast and the Camas mill the largest of its type in the world.

During World War II, the Camas mill temporarily manufactured parts and components for US Naval vessels produced at the nearby Kaiser Shipyards. In 1950, the Camas mill was the first factory to produce folded paper napkins. &quot;Crown Z&quot; was the area&#x27;s biggest employer in 1971, with 2,643 of approximately 3,700 Clark County paper mill workers. In 1986, Crown Zellerbach was absorbed by James River Corporation; after further mergers with the Fort Howard Paper Company in 1997 and Georgia-Pacific in 2000, Koch Industries acquired Georgia-Pacific and the Camas mill in 2005. In 2018, Koch announced plans to lay off approximately 200–300 workers, shutting down all equipment related to communications paper, fine paper conversion and pulping operations.

Historically, the commercial base of the city was almost entirely the paper mill; In recent years, however, the diversity of industries in and near Camas has been enhanced considerably by the influx of several high-tech, white-collar companies. These include Hewlett-Packard, Linear Technology, WaferTech and Underwriters Laboratories.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of of which is land and is water. There are numerous bodies of water within the city limits, including Lacamas Lake, Lacamas Creek, Round Lake, Fallen Leaf Lake, Tug Lake, the Washougal River, and the Columbia River.

Camas is approximately northeast of Portland, Oregon.

==Arts and culture==
Annual events include the summer &quot;Camas Days&quot;, as well as other festivals and celebrations.

==Parks and recreation==
There are numerous parks in Camas and within the Camas area, including:
Lacamas Park encompasses Round Lake and runs against SR 500 on its west side. Across SR 500 is Lacamas Lake. The park is open year-round and includes barbecues, a playground, trails around the park and lake, and access to the Camas Potholes. The park includes trails which lead to the Camas Potholes and the Camas lily fields, as well as a loop around Round Lake. Water activities in Round Lake are also common around summer time. Bathrooms are available on a seasonal basis only.

Heritage Park has facilities for launching boats into Lacamas Lake, a playground, much open field, and trails through the trees. The parking lot is large and includes numerous long parking stalls to accommodate vehicles with trailers.

<text>Dollars Corner is a census-designated place (CDP) in Clark County, Washington, United States. The population was 1,246 at the 2020 census, up from 1,108 at the 2010 census.

==History==
In 1917, Mr. and Mrs. S. L. Dollar purchased a farm near what would later be named Dollars Corner. The couple reportedly exchanged $150 and two cows for the land. They opened a small store and service station on one corner in 1924, which became a local landmark. One story claims that the name was coined by local sheriff&#x27;s deputies, who would report to their superiors that they traveled &quot;as far as Dollar&#x27;s Corner.&quot;

In 2012, the landscape of Dollars Corner began to change drastically as a result of the realignment of Washington State Route 502. Historic buildings situated directly on the corner were demolished, with the exception of the former O&#x27;Brady&#x27;s Drive-In restaurant, which became the center of a protracted compensation dispute.

==Geography==

The community is bordered to the northeast by Cherry Grove, to the east by the city of Battle Ground, to the southeast by Meadow Glade, and to the west by Duluth.

<text>Felida is a census-designated place (CDP) in Clark County, Washington, United States. The population was 9,526 at the 2020 census.

A post office called Felida was established in 1890, and remained in operation until 1906. The community derives its name from Felidae, the family of cats.

== History ==
The area has important ties to the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804–1806, being close to the Chinookan town of Cathlapotle, then a settlement of 700–800 people, with at least 14 substantial plank houses. The community&#x27;s ties to the Chinookan people was commemorated by the construction of a replica of a Cathlapotle plank house at the nearby Ridgefield National Wildlife Refuge, which was dedicated March 29, 2005.

A post office was established for the area northeast of Vancouver Lake, in 1890. While deciding what to name the post office, the first postmaster, Marian E. McIrvin, wanted it to be named Lakeview, but postal authorities informed him that there was already a place in Washington state named Lakeview. McIrvin&#x27;s father-in-law suggested Felida for the name, and the name stuck.

A competing theory is that the town&#x27;s name came from a suggestion for the post office to be referred to as Powley, after a local resident. The post office didn&#x27;t want that name, and suggested it should be named Polly instead. C.C. Lewis, the current postmaster, thought that Polly was a name for a parrot, and that it should actually be named for his cat, Thomas. He submitted the names, Thomas, Tomcat, and Felidae. The post office thought that Felida would be a nice name, and took it.

<doc id="137869" wikidata="Q1275768" url="?curid=137869" title="Fred Rogers">
<text>Fred McFeely Rogers (March 20, 1928 – February 27, 2003), better known as Mister Rogers, was an American television host, author, producer, and Presbyterian minister. He was the creator, showrunner, and host of the preschool television series &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, which ran from 1968 to 2001.

Born in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, Rogers earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in music from Rollins College in 1951. He began his television career at NBC in New York City, returning to Pittsburgh in 1953 to work for children&#x27;s programming at NET (later PBS) television station WQED. He graduated from Pittsburgh Theological Seminary with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in divinity in 1962 and became a Presbyterian minister in 1963. He attended the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Graduate School of Child Development, where he began his thirty-year collaboration with child psychologist Margaret McFarland. He also helped develop the children&#x27;s shows &quot;The Children&#x27;s Corner&quot; (1955) for WQED in Pittsburgh and &quot;Misterogers&quot; (1963) in Canada for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In 1968, he returned to Pittsburgh and adapted the format of his Canadian series to create &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood.&quot; It ran for 33 years and was critically acclaimed for focusing on children&#x27;s emotional and physical concerns, such as death, sibling rivalry, school enrollment, and divorce.

Rogers died of stomach cancer in 2003, aged 74. His work in children&#x27;s television has been widely lauded, and he received more than forty honorary degrees and several awards, including a Lifetime Achievement Emmy in 1997 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2002. He was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1999. Rogers influenced many writers and producers of children&#x27;s television shows, and his broadcasts provided comfort during tragic events, even after his death.

==Early life==
Rogers was born in 1928, at 705 Main Street in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. His father, James Hillis Rogers, was &quot;a very successful businessman&quot; who was president of the McFeely Brick Company, one of Latrobe&#x27;s most prominent businesses. His mother, Nancy (née McFeely), knitted sweaters for American soldiers from western Pennsylvania who were fighting in Europe and regularly volunteered at the Latrobe Hospital. Initially dreaming of becoming a doctor, she settled for a life of hospital volunteer work. Her father, Fred Brooks McFeely, after whom Rogers was named, was an entrepreneur.

Rogers grew up in a large three-story brick house at 737 Weldon Street in Latrobe. He had a sister, Elaine, whom the Rogerses adopted when he was eleven years old. Rogers spent much of his childhood alone, playing with puppets, and also spent time with his grandfather. He began playing the piano when he was five. Through an ancestor who immigrated from Germany to the U.S., Johannes Meffert (born 1732), Rogers is the sixth cousin of actor Tom Hanks, who portrays him in the film &quot;A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood&quot; (2019).

Rogers had a difficult childhood. Shy, introverted, and overweight, he was frequently homebound after suffering bouts of asthma. He was bullied as a child for his weight and called &quot;Fat Freddy&quot;. According to Morgan Neville, director of the 2018 documentary &quot;Won&#x27;t You Be My Neighbor?&quot;, Rogers had a &quot;lonely childhood... I think he made friends with himself as much as he could. He had a ventriloquist dummy, he had [stuffed] animals, and he would create his own worlds in his childhood bedroom&quot;.
Rogers attended Latrobe High School, where he overcame his shyness. &quot;It was tough for me at the beginning,&quot; Rogers told NPR&#x27;s Terry Gross in 1984, &quot;and then I made a couple friends who found out that the core of me was okay. And one of them was... the head of the football team&quot;. Rogers became president of the student council, a member of the National Honor Society, and editor-in-chief of the school yearbook. He registered for the draft in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, in 1948 at age 20, where he was classified 1-A (available for military service); however, his status was changed to unqualified for military service following an Armed Forces physical on October 12, 1950. He attended Dartmouth College for one year before transferring to Rollins College, where he graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1951 with a Bachelor of Music.

He then attended Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, from which he graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1962 with a Bachelor of Divinity, and was ordained a Presbyterian minister by the Pittsburgh Presbytery of the United Presbyterian Church in 1963. His work as an ordained minister, rather than to pastor a church, was to minister to children and their families through television. He regularly appeared before church officials to maintain his ordination.

==Career==
===Early work===
Rogers wanted to enter seminary after college, but instead chose to go into the nascent medium of television after experiencing TV at his parents&#x27; home in 1951, during his senior year at Rollins College. In a CNN interview, he said, &quot;I went into television because I hated it so, and I thought there&#x27;s some way of using this fabulous instrument to nurture those who would watch and listen&quot;. After graduating in 1951, he worked at NBC in New York City as floor director of &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;, &quot;The Kate Smith Hour&quot;, and Gabby Hayes&#x27;s children&#x27;s show, and as an assistant producer of &quot;The Voice of Firestone&quot;.
In 1953, Rogers returned to Pittsburgh to work as a program developer at public television station WQED. Josie Carey worked with him to develop the children&#x27;s show &quot;The Children&#x27;s Corner&quot;, which Carey hosted. Rogers worked off-camera to develop puppets, characters, and music for the show. He used many puppet characters developed during this time, such as Daniel the Striped Tiger (named after WQED&#x27;s station manager, Dorothy Daniel, who gave Rogers a tiger puppet before the show&#x27;s premiere), King Friday XIII, Queen Sara Saturday (named after Rogers&#x27; wife), X the Owl, Henrietta, and Lady Elaine, in his later work. Children&#x27;s television entertainer Ernie Coombs was an assistant puppeteer. &quot;The Children&#x27;s Corner&quot; won a Sylvania Award for best locally produced children&#x27;s programming in 1955 and was broadcast nationally on NBC. While working on the show, Rogers attended Pittsburgh Theological Seminary and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1963. He also attended the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Graduate School of Child Development, where he began working with child psychologist Margaret McFarland—who, according to Rogers&#x27; biographer Maxwell King, became his &quot;key advisor and collaborator&quot; and &quot;child-education guru&quot;. Much of Rogers&#x27; &quot;thinking about and appreciation for children was shaped and informed&quot; by McFarland. She was his consultant for most of &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;″s scripts and songs for 30 years.

In 1963, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in Toronto contracted Rogers to come to Toronto to develop and host the 15-minute black-and-white children&#x27;s program &quot;Misterogers;&quot; it lasted from 1963 to 1967. It was the first time Rogers appeared on camera. CBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s programming head Fred Rainsberry insisted on it, telling Rogers, &quot;Fred, I&#x27;ve seen you talk with kids. Let&#x27;s put you yourself on the air&quot;. Coombs joined Rogers in Toronto as an assistant puppeteer. Rogers also worked with Coombs on the children&#x27;s show &quot;Butternut Square&quot; from 1964 to 1967. Rogers acquired the rights to &quot;Misterogers&quot; in 1967 and returned to Pittsburgh with his wife, two young sons, and the sets he developed, despite a potentially promising career with CBC and no job prospects in Pittsburgh. On Rogers&#x27; recommendation, Coombs remained in Toronto and became Rogers&#x27; Canadian equivalent of an iconic television personality, creating the children&#x27;s program &quot;Mr. Dressup&quot;, which ran from 1967 to 1996. Rogers&#x27; work for CBC &quot;helped shape and develop the concept and style of his later program for the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the U.S.&quot;

===&quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;===

&quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; (also called the &quot;Neighborhood&quot;), a half-hour educational children&#x27;s program starring Rogers, began airing nationally in 1968 and ran for 895 episodes. It was videotaped at WQED in Pittsburgh and broadcast by National Educational Television (NET), which later became the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). Its first season had 180 black-and-white episodes. Each subsequent season, filmed in color and funded by PBS, the Sears-Roebuck Foundation, and other charities, consisted of 65 episodes. By the time it ended production in December 2000, its average rating was about 0.7% of television households or 680,000 homes, and it aired on 384 PBS stations. At its peak in 1985–1986, its ratings were 2.1%, or 1.8 million homes. The last original episode aired in 2001, but PBS continued to air reruns, and by 2016 it was the third-longest-running program in PBS history.

Many of the sets and props in &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, like the trolley, the sneakers, and the castle, were created for Rogers&#x27; show in Toronto by CBC designers and producers. The program also &quot;incorporated most of the highly imaginative elements that later became famous&quot;, such as its slow pace and its host&#x27;s quiet manner. The format of &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; &quot;remained virtually unchanged&quot; for the entire run of the program. Every episode begins with a camera&#x27;s-eye view of a model of a neighborhood, then panning in closer to a representation of a house while a piano instrumental of the theme song, &quot;Won&#x27;t You be My Neighbor?&quot;, performed by music director Johnny Costa and inspired by a Beethoven sonata, is played. The camera zooms in to a model representing Mr. Rogers&#x27; house, then cuts to the house&#x27;s interior and pans across the room to the front door, which Rogers opens as he sings the theme song to greet his visitors while changing his suit jacket to a cardigan (knitted by his mother) and his dress shoes to sneakers, &quot;complete with a shoe tossed from one hand to another&quot;. The episode&#x27;s theme is introduced, and Mr. Rogers leaves his home to visit another location, the camera panning back to the neighborhood model and zooming in to the new location as he enters it. Once this segment ends, Mr. Rogers leaves and returns to his home, indicating that it is time to visit the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. Mr. Rogers proceeds to the window seat by the trolley track and sets up the action there as the Trolley comes out. The camera follows it down a tunnel in the back wall of the house as it enters the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. The stories and lessons take place over a week&#x27;s worth of episodes and involve puppets and human characters. The end of the visit occurs when the Trolley returns to the same tunnel from which it emerged, reappearing in Mr. Rogers&#x27; home. He then talks to the viewers before concluding the episode. He often feeds his fish, cleans up any props he has used, and returns to the front room, where he sings the closing song while changing back into his dress shoes and jacket. He exits the front door as he ends the song, and the camera zooms out of his home and pans across the neighborhood model as the episode ends.

&quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; emphasized young children&#x27;s social and emotional needs, and unlike another PBS show, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, which premiered in 1969, did not focus on cognitive learning. Writer Kathy Merlock Jackson said, &quot;While both shows target the same preschool audience and prepare children for kindergarten, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; concentrates on school-readiness skills while &quot;Mister Rogers Neighborhood&quot; focuses on the child&#x27;s developing psyche and feelings and sense of moral and ethical reasoning&quot;. The &quot;Neighborhood&quot; also spent fewer resources on research than &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, but Rogers used early childhood education concepts taught by his mentor Margaret McFarland, Benjamin Spock, Erik Erikson, and T. Berry Brazelton in his lessons. As &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted, Rogers taught young children about civility, tolerance, sharing, and self-worth &quot;in a reassuring tone and leisurely cadence&quot;. He tackled difficult topics such as the death of a family pet, sibling rivalry, the addition of a newborn into a family, moving and enrolling in a new school, and divorce. For example, he wrote a special segment that dealt with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy that aired on June 7, 1968, two days after the assassination occurred.

According to King, the process of putting each episode of &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; together was &quot;painstaking&quot; and Rogers&#x27; contribution to the program was &quot;astounding&quot;. Rogers wrote and edited all the episodes, played the piano and sang for most of the songs, wrote 200 songs and 13 operas, created all the characters (both puppet and human), played most of the significant puppet roles, hosted every episode, and produced and approved every detail of the program. The puppets created for the Neighborhood of Make-Believe &quot;included an extraordinary variety of personalities&quot;. They were simple puppets but &quot;complex, complicated, and utterly honest beings&quot;. In 1971, Rogers formed Family Communications, Inc. (FCI, now Fred Rogers Productions), to produce the &quot;Neighborhood&quot;, other programs, and non-broadcast materials.

In 1975, Rogers stopped producing &quot;Mr. Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; to focus on adult programming. Reruns of the &quot;Neighborhood&quot; continued to air on PBS. King reports that the decision caught many of his coworkers and supporters &quot;off guard&quot;. Rogers continued to confer with McFarland about child development and early childhood education, however. In 1979, after an almost five-year hiatus, Rogers returned to producing the &quot;Neighborhood&quot;; King calls the new version &quot;stronger and more sophisticated than ever&quot;. King writes that by the program&#x27;s second run in the 1980s, it was &quot;such a cultural touchstone that it had inspired numerous parodies&quot;, most notably Eddie Murphy&#x27;s parody on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the early 1980s.

Rogers retired from producing the &quot;Neighborhood&quot; in 2001 at age 73, although reruns continued to air. He and FCI had been making about two or three weeks of new programs per year for many years, &quot;filling the rest of his time slots from a library of about 300 shows made since 1979&quot;. The final original episode of &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; aired on August 31, 2001.

===Other work and appearances===

In 1969, Rogers testified before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Communications, which was chaired by Democratic Senator John Pastore of Rhode Island. U.S. President Lyndon Johnson had proposed a $20 million bill for the creation of PBS before he left office, but his successor, Richard Nixon, wanted to cut the funding to $10 million. Even though Rogers was not yet nationally known, he was chosen to testify because of his ability to make persuasive arguments and to connect emotionally with his audience. The clip of Rogers&#x27; testimony, which was televised and has since been viewed by millions of people on the internet, helped to secure funding for PBS for many years afterward. According to King, Rogers&#x27; testimony was &quot;considered one of the most powerful pieces of testimony ever offered before Congress, and one of the most powerful pieces of video presentation ever filmed&quot;. It brought Pastore to tears and also, according to King, has been studied by public relations experts and academics. Congressional funding for PBS increased from $9 million to $22 million. In 1970, Nixon appointed Rogers as chair of the White House Conference on Children and Youth.

In 1978, while on hiatus from &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, Rogers wrote, produced, and hosted a 30-minute interview program for adults on PBS called &quot;Old Friends... New Friends&quot;. It lasted 20 episodes. Rogers&#x27; guests included Hoagy Carmichael, Helen Hayes, Milton Berle, Lorin Hollander, poet Robert Frost&#x27;s daughter Lesley, and Willie Stargell.

In September 1987, Rogers visited Moscow to appear as the first guest on the long-running Soviet children&#x27;s TV show &quot;Good Night, Little Ones!&quot; with host Tatyana Vedeneyeva. The appearance was broadcast in the Soviet Union on December 7, coinciding with the Washington Summit meeting between Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and U.S. President Ronald Reagan in Washington, D.C. Vedeneyeva visited the set of &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; in November. Her visit was taped and later aired in March 1988 as part of Rogers&#x27; program. In 1994, Rogers wrote, produced, and hosted a special for PBS called &quot;Fred Rogers&#x27; Heroes&quot;, which featured interviews and portraits of four people from across the country who were having a positive impact on children and education. The first time Rogers appeared on television as an actor, and not himself, was in a 1996 episode of &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot;, playing a preacher.

Rogers gave &quot;scores of interviews&quot;. Though reluctant to appear on television talk shows, he would usually &quot;charm the host with his quick wit and ability to ad-lib on a moment&#x27;s notice&quot;. Rogers was &quot;one of the country&#x27;s most sought-after commencement speakers&quot;, making over 150 speeches. His friend and colleague David Newell reported that Rogers would &quot;agonize over a speech&quot;, and King reported that Rogers was at his least guarded during his speeches, which were about children, television, education, his view of the world, how to make the world a better place, and his quest for self-knowledge. His tone was quiet and informal but &quot;commanded attention&quot;. In many speeches, including the ones he made accepting a Lifetime Achievement Emmy in 1997, for his induction into the Television Hall of Fame in 1999, and his final commencement speech at Dartmouth College in 2002, he instructed his audiences to remain silent and think for a moment about someone who had a good influence on them.

==Personal life==

Rogers met Sara Joanne Byrd (called &quot;Joanne&quot;) from Jacksonville, Florida, while attending Rollins College. They were married from 1952 until he died in 2003. They had two sons, James and John. Joanne was an accomplished pianist, who, like Fred, earned a Bachelor of Music from Rollins, and went on to earn a Master of Music from Florida State University. She performed publicly with her college classmate, Jeannine Morrison, from 1976 to 2008. According to biographer Maxwell King, Rogers&#x27; close associates said he was &quot;absolutely faithful to his marriage vows&quot;.

Rogers was red-green color-blind. He became a pescatarian in 1970, after the death of his father, and a vegetarian in the early 1980s, saying he &quot;couldn&#x27;t eat anything that had a mother&quot;. He became a co-owner of &quot;Vegetarian Times&quot; in the mid-1980s and said in one issue, &quot;I love tofu burgers and beets&quot;. He told &quot;Vegetarian Times&quot; that he became a vegetarian for both ethical and health reasons. According to his biographer Maxwell King, Rogers also signed his name to a statement protesting wearing animal furs.

Rogers was a registered Republican, but according to Joanne Rogers, he was &quot;very independent in the way he voted&quot;, choosing not to talk about politics because he wanted to be impartial.

Rogers was a Presbyterian, and many of the messages he expressed in &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; were inspired by the core tenets of Christianity. Rogers rarely spoke about his faith on air; he believed that teaching through example was as powerful as preaching. He said, &quot;You don&#x27;t need to speak overtly about religion in order to get a message across&quot;. According to writer Shea Tuttle, Rogers considered his faith a fundamental part of his personality and &quot;called the space between the viewer and the television set &#x27;holy ground&#x27;&quot;. He also studied Catholic mysticism, Judaism, Buddhism, and other faiths and cultures. King called him &quot;that unique television star with a real spiritual life&quot;, emphasizing the values of patience, reflection, and &quot;silence in a noisy world&quot;.

King reported that despite Rogers&#x27; family&#x27;s wealth, he cared little about making money, and lived frugally, especially as he and his wife grew older. King reported that Rogers&#x27; relationship with his young audience was important to him. For example, since hosting &quot;Misterogers&quot; in Canada, he answered every letter sent to him by hand. After &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; began airing in the U.S., the letters increased in volume, and he hired staff member and producer Hedda Sharapan to answer them, but he read, edited, and signed each one. King wrote that Rogers saw responding to his viewers&#x27; letters as &quot;a pastoral duty of sorts&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; called Rogers &quot;a dedicated lap-swimmer&quot;, and Tom Junod, author of &quot;Can You Say... Hero?&quot;, the 1998 &quot;Esquire&quot; profile of Rogers, said, &quot;Nearly every morning of his life, Mister Rogers has gone swimming&quot;. Rogers began swimming when he was a child at his family&#x27;s vacation home outside Latrobe, where they owned a pool, and during their winter trips to Florida. King wrote that swimming and playing the piano were &quot;lifelong passions&quot; and that &quot;both gave him a chance to feel capable and in charge of his destiny&quot;, and that swimming became &quot;an important part of the strong sense of self-discipline he cultivated&quot;. Rogers swam daily at the Pittsburgh Athletic Association, after waking every morning between 4:30 and 5:30 A.M. to pray and to &quot;read the Bible and prepare himself for the day&quot;. He did not smoke or drink. According to Junod, he did nothing to change his weight from the he weighed for most of his adult life; by 1998, this also included napping daily, going to bed at 9:30 P.M., and sleeping eight hours per night without interruption. Junod said Rogers saw his weight &quot;as a destiny fulfilled&quot;, telling Junod, &quot;the number 143 means &#x27;I love you.&#x27; It takes one letter to say &#x27;I&#x27; and four letters to say &#x27;love&#x27; and three letters to say &#x27;you&#x27;&quot;.

=== Sexuality ===
According to biographer Michael Long in a 2014 &quot;HuffPost&quot; essay, Rogers&#x27; sexuality had long been a topic of curiosity due to his lack of traditional machismo. The 2018 documentary &quot;Won&#x27;t You Be My Neighbor?&quot; briefly addresses the subject, including an interview with François Clemmons, the gay actor who played Officer Clemmons on &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, who stated that as far as he knew, Rogers was not gay, saying that if he had a &quot;gay vibe,&quot; Clemmons would have noticed it.

However, in the 2018 biography &quot;The Good Neighbor: The Life and Work of Fred Rogers&quot;, Rogers recounts telling openly gay friend Dr. William Hirsch that he &quot;must be right smack in the middle&quot; of a one-to-ten sexuality scale, because &quot;I have found women attractive, and I have found men attractive.&quot; This led many social media users to identify Rogers as bisexual. 

In his 2014 essay, Long noted that there is &quot;no publicly available evidence&quot; that Rogers ever had sexual relations with men. Rogers was reportedly &quot;absolutely faithful&quot; to Joanne Byrd, to whom he was married nearly his whole adult life.

==Death and memorials==
After Rogers&#x27; retirement in 2001, he remained busy working with FCI, studying religion and spirituality, making public appearances, traveling, and working on a children&#x27;s media center named after him at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe with Archabbot Douglas Nowicki, chancellor of the college. By the summer of 2002, his chronic stomach pain became severe enough for him to see a doctor about it, and in October 2002, he was diagnosed with stomach cancer. He delayed treatment until after he served as Grand Marshal of the 2003 Rose Parade, with Art Linkletter and Bill Cosby, in January. On January 6, Rogers underwent stomach surgery. He died less than two months later, on February 27, 2003, less than a month short of his 75th birthday at his home in Pittsburgh, with his wife of 50 years, Joanne, at his side. While comatose shortly before his death, he received the last rites of the Catholic Church from Archabbot Nowicki.

The following day, the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; covered Rogers&#x27; death on the front page and dedicated an entire section to his death and impact. The newspaper also reported that by noon, the internet &quot;was already full of appreciative pieces&quot; by parents, viewers, producers, and writers. Rogers&#x27; death was widely lamented. Most U.S. metropolitan newspapers ran his obituary on their front page and some dedicated entire sections to coverage of his death. WQED aired programs about Rogers the evening he died; the &quot;Post-Gazette&quot; reported that the ratings for their coverage were three times higher than their normal ratings. That same evening, &quot;Nightline&quot; on ABC broadcast a rerun of a recent interview with Rogers; the program got the highest ratings of the day, beating the February average ratings of &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. On March 4, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution honoring Rogers sponsored by Representative Mike Doyle from Pennsylvania.

On March 1, 2003, a private funeral was held for Rogers in Unity Chapel, which was restored by Rogers&#x27; father, at Unity Cemetery in Latrobe. About 80 relatives, co-workers, and close friends attended the service, which &quot;was planned in great secrecy so that those closest to him could grieve in private&quot;. Reverend John McCall, pastor of the Rogers family&#x27;s church, Sixth Presbyterian Church in Squirrel Hill, gave the homily; Reverend William Barker, a retired Presbyterian minister who was a &quot;close friend of Mr. Rogers and the voice of Mr. Platypus on his show&quot;, read Rogers&#x27; favorite Bible passages. Rogers was interred at Unity Cemetery in his hometown of Latrobe, Pennsylvania, in a mausoleum owned by his mother&#x27;s family.

On May 3, 2003, a public memorial was held at Heinz Hall in Pittsburgh. According to the &quot;Post-Gazette&quot;, 2,700 people attended. Violinist Itzhak Perlman, cellist Yo-Yo Ma (via video), and organist Alan Morrison performed in honor of Rogers. Barker officiated the service; also in attendance were Pittsburgh philanthropist Elsie Hillman, former &quot;Good Morning America&quot; host David Hartman, &quot;The Very Hungry Caterpillar&quot; author Eric Carle, and &quot;Arthur&quot; creator Marc Brown. Businesswoman and philanthropist Teresa Heinz, PBS President Pat Mitchell, and executive director of The Pittsburgh Project Saleem Ghubril gave remarks. Jeff Erlanger, who at age 10 appeared on &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; in 1981 to explain his electric wheelchair, also spoke. The memorial was broadcast several times on Pittsburgh television stations and websites throughout the day.
==Legacy==
Marc Brown, creator of another PBS children&#x27;s show, &quot;Arthur&quot;, considered Rogers both a friend and &quot;a terrific role model for how to use television and the media to be helpful to kids and families&quot;. Josh Selig, creator of &quot;Wonder Pets&quot;, credits Rogers with influencing his use of structure and predictability, and his use of music, opera, and originality.

Rogers inspired Angela Santomero, co-creator of the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;, to earn a degree in developmental psychology and go into educational television. She and the other producers of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; used many of Rogers&#x27; techniques, such as using child developmental and educational research and having the host speak directly to the camera and transition to a make-believe world. In 2006, three years after Rogers&#x27; death and the end of production of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;, the Fred Rogers Company contacted Santomero to create a show that would promote Rogers&#x27; legacy. In 2012, &quot;Daniel Tiger&#x27;s Neighborhood&quot;, with characters from and based upon &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, premiered on PBS.

Rogers&#x27; style and approach to children&#x27;s television and early childhood education also &quot;begged to be parodied&quot;. Comedian Eddie Murphy parodied &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; during the 1980s. Rogers told interviewer David Letterman in 1982 that he believed parodies like Murphy&#x27;s were done &quot;with kindness in their hearts&quot;.

Video of Rogers&#x27; 1969 testimony in defense of public programming has experienced a resurgence since 2012, going viral at least twice. It first resurfaced after then presidential candidate Mitt Romney suggested cutting funding for PBS. In 2017, video of the testimony again went viral after President Donald Trump proposed defunding several arts-related government programs including PBS and the National Endowment for the Arts.

A roadside Pennsylvania Historical Marker dedicated to Rogers to be installed in Latrobe was approved by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission on March 4, 2014. It was installed on June 11, 2016, with the title &quot;Fred McFeely Rogers (1928–2003)&quot;.

&quot;Won&#x27;t You Be My Neighbor?&quot; director Morgan Neville&#x27;s 2018 documentary about Rogers&#x27; life, grossed over $22 million and became the top-grossing biographical documentary ever produced, the highest-grossing documentary in five years, and the twelfth-largest-grossing documentary ever made. The 2019 drama film &quot;A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood&quot; tells the story of Rogers and his television series, with Tom Hanks portraying Rogers.

According to Caitlin Gibson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Rogers became a source for parenting advice; she called him &quot;a timeless oracle against a backdrop of ever-shifting parenting philosophies and cultural trends&quot;. Robert Thompson of Syracuse University noted that Rogers &quot;took American childhood—and I think Americans in general—through some very turbulent and trying times&quot;, from the Vietnam War and the assassination of Robert Kennedy in 1968 to the 9/11 attacks in 2001. According to Asia Simone Burns of National Public Radio, in the years following the end of production on &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; in 2001 and his death in 2003, Rogers became &quot;a source of comfort, sometimes in the wake of tragedy&quot;. Burns has said Rogers&#x27; words of comfort &quot;began circulating on social media&quot; following tragedies such as the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, the Manchester Arena bombing in Manchester, England, in 2017, and the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, in 2018.

The memorial depicts Rogers and Daniel Tiger speaking with a group of children and features lyrics from &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&#x27;s&quot; theme on the base.

====Honorary degrees====
Rogers has received honorary degrees from over 43 colleges and universities.

<text>Minnehaha is a census-designated place (CDP) in Clark County, Washington, United States. The population was 11,871 at the 2020 census.

==Toponym==
This area got its name from a &quot;Columbian&quot; newspaper editorial in 1891. The editor wrote about Burnt Bridge Creek and called it &quot;Minnehaha, laughing water,&quot; from Longfellow&#x27;s poem &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;. The name appealed to the citizenry and they kept it. Before that the area was called the &quot;Black Forest&quot; for its thick timber.

While &quot;Minnehaha&quot;, a Native American word, is often translated as &quot;Laughing Water&quot;, the correct translation is &quot;curling water&quot; or &quot;waterfall&quot;, as in Minnehaha Falls, Minnesota. The name comes from the Dakota language.

==Geography==
Minnehaha is located in southwestern Clark County and is bordered on the west, south, and east by the city of Vancouver and on the north by Walnut Grove.

<text>Venersborg is a census-designated place (CDP) in Clark County, Washington, United States. The population was 3,990 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The community was established as &quot;Venner&#x27;s Villas&quot; in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when a land entrepreneur, J. C. Lanerberg, purchased land from various sources including the government, railroad companies, and other landowners. He divided the land into lots. To market the area, Lanerberg produced pamphlets written in Swedish that highlighted its resemblance to rural Sweden. The flyers were concentrated in large, urban communities throughout the United States and the first settlers who arrived in the early 1900s were mostly of Swedish ancestry. The growth of nearby Vancouver and Portland led to an influx of new residents in the 1960s.

The land was originally heavily timbered. A number of farms and orchards were established in the early 20th century, some of which have existed into the 3rd millennium that grow rare, heirloom apple varieties.

The community is considered rural and the town supports three non-residential buildings. A single commercial establishment, the Venersborg Store, reopened in 2008 but closed in 2013.

<text>Washougal ( ) is a city in Clark County, Washington, United States. The population was 17,039 as of the 2020 census.

==Etymology==
The name Washougal originated from a Chinookan term of disputed meaning that was recorded by fur trader Alexander Ross in 1811 as &quot;Wasough-ally&quot;; other variants included &quot;Washougally&quot;, &quot;Washougally Camp&quot;, &quot;Wa-Shu-Go&quot;, and &quot;Washookal&quot;.

==History==
The area around present-day Washougal was originally home to the Watlala, an indigenous Chinookan-speaking group with settlements along the Columbia River. Among the first non-indigenous people to visit the area were the Corps of Discovery led by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark in 1805 and 1806; they camped near the Washougal River during their return voyage in April 1806 and tentatively named it the &quot;Seal River&quot; and &quot;Seacalf River&quot;.

English sailor Richard Ough (also spelled Howe) built a home in what would become present-day Washougal sometime between 1838 and 1841; he had arrived in the area to work at Fort Vancouver for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and later married the daughter of Cascade Chinook chief Schluyhus. Ough was followed in 1844 by a cohort led by David C. Parker, who built Parker&#x27;s Landing and claimed under the Donation Land Claim Act; among the settlers was George Bush, among the first African American settlers in the Pacific Northwest. Parker&#x27;s Landing, later renamed Parkersville, unsuccessfully applied for incorporation in 1852 or 1854; by this time, it had a hotel, bar, and a store and was a trading post along the river. A public school—claimed to be the first American school north of the Columbia River—was established in 1852–53. A portion of Ough&#x27;s own claim was sold to Joseph E. C. Durgin, who established a townsite in 1880 that was named Washougal; the new settlement overtook Parkersville and was platted on May 6, 1880.

Washougal was connected to the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway in 1908 and was incorporated in November of that year. In 1910, a textile mill opened in the town and grew to become a major part of the area&#x27;s economy; it was acquired by Pendleton Woolen Mills two years later. A new east–west highway along the Columbia River (now part of State Route 14) opened in 1927 and aided development of summer homes and recreation areas near Washougal. In the mid-to-late 20th century, Washougal became a bedroom community for workers in Vancouver and Portland, but grew slower than neighboring Camas. Its Mount Pleasant Grange Hall is the oldest continually used grange hall in Washington.

==Education==
The city&#x27;s public school system is managed by the Dayton School District, which covers the vast majority of Columbia County.

A library within the city is operated by the Columbia County Rural Library District. People living in Dayton are in the library&#x27;s taxation base, but not in the library&#x27;s voting base; the voting area for the library only consists of unincorporated areas. The library was established in 1919 as a small reading room while a women&#x27;s civics club fundraised for a permanent building. The raised funds were transferred to the Dayton city government in 1935 and used to construct a public library in 1937 using New Deal funding; the building was later expanded in 1947.

It is the only public library in Columbia County. A ballot measure submitted in 2023 proposed to close the rural library district, and therefore the library itself, entirely due to the placement and availability of children&#x27;s books on racial issues and LGBT topics; amid then-ongoing book banning efforts in the United States, the library would have been the first one nationwide to close over such a dispute if it succeeded, according to the American Library Association. The library collection would be received by the Washington State Library if the rural library district was dissolved. The initiative was ruled unconstitutional in September 2023 by the Columbia County Superior Court due to its exclusion of voters in incorporated areas; the ruling blocked the initiative from appearing on the November 2023 ballot.

<text>Starbuck is a town in Columbia County, Washington, United States. The population was 119 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Named for railroad official W. H. Starbuck, the town was originally a junction on the main line of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company. The town was platted in 1894, and built its first bank ten years later. In 1886, the railroad completed a line eastward from Starbuck to Pomeroy and Pataha City in Garfield County; the line remained in operation until 1981. The town was officially incorporated on September 18, 1905. In 1910, a large brick school was built.

In 1914 a bridge over the Snake River was completed downstream from Lyon&#x27;s Ferry, which greatly diminished the railroad traffic through the town. The economy of the town turned to agriculture, but in 1929 the bank failed. The town&#x27;s population dwindled steadily until the mid-twentieth century. The high school shut down in 1956, and students were bussed to Dayton. In 1961, the railroad station was shut down as well.

In 1968, the Snake River Bridge, which was originally built over the Columbia at Vantage in 1927 and disassembled in 1963, was re-assembled in the area, providing additional access over the Snake River. In 1970, the Little Goose Dam was completed about nine miles northeast of Starbuck.

==Geography==

<doc id="137884" wikidata="Q1023555" url="?curid=137884" title="Castle Rock, Washington">
<text>Castle Rock is a city in Cowlitz County, Washington, United States. Located between the Willapa Hills and the western base of Mount St. Helens, Castle Rock is at the heart of Washington timber country in the Pacific temperate rain forest. Castle Rock is part of the Longview, Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area; the population was 2,446 as of the 2020 census.

==History==
Castle Rock is named for a volcanic rock outcropping over the Cowlitz River, &quot;The Rock&quot;, rising 190 feet high on the south side of the city. The rock formation, resembling a castle, became a geographic landmark for Cowlitz Indians and Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company traders as early as 1832. Today, it is the location of The Rock Community Park, with hiking trails, picnic tables, and a historical marker.

Castle Rock is centered primarily on the donation land claim of Eliza and William Huntington, who settled at the location in 1852. The city was platted December 12, 1888 and incorporated on June 20, 1890. Castle Rock prospered as a Cowlitz River steamboat port and trading center for valley farms. The local sawmill was the first to produce cedar shingles, using the Western red cedar, which grows in abundance in the region.

By 1940, the population had reached 1,182 and was supported by dairy farming, truck farming, and lumber manufacturing. Sword ferns, common in the region, were picked each year by several hundred people to be processed into medicine. In the spring, large quantities of Cascara Sagrada bark were gathered, dried, and shipped.

==Geography==
Castle Rock is located 117 miles south of Seattle and 58 miles north of Portland, Oregon. Castle Rock is situated between the Cowlitz River and Interstate 5, one mile south of the confluence of the Cowlitz and the Toutle River.

West Side Highway, running north along the Cowlitz River, connects Castle Rock to Cloud Mountain and the communities of Olequa and Vader, Washington. Continuing south, West Side Highway / State Route 411 connects Castle Rock to Longview, Washington, and Ocean Beach Highway (State Route 4), putting Castle Rock 75 miles from Willapa National Wildlife Refuge and the Pacific Ocean.

The Castle Rock Park &amp; Ride is located on Huntington Avenue next to Interstate 5 Exit 49. Bus service is provided by Lower Columbia CAP Rural Public Transit to Longview and Castle Rock, via Interstate 5.

The Riverfront Trail, a multi-use off-road trail, runs along both sides of the Cowlitz River. On the east side, the trail begins at Lions Pride Park, runs past the Rock Community Park, and 1.5 miles later reaches the PH10 bridge. On the west side, the trail runs 1100 feet to the Castle Rock Sports Complex. The City of Castle Rock was awarded the Association of Washington Cities 2004 Municipal Achievement Gold Medal Award for the city&#x27;s trail system.

<text>Kalama (ka-LAM-ma) is a city in Cowlitz County, Washington, United States. It is part of the Longview, Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,959 as of the 2020 census.

==Etymology==
James W. Phillips&#x27; &quot;Washington State Place Names&quot; states, &quot;General John W. Sprague of the Northern Pacific Railroad named the town in 1871 for the Indian word calama, meaning &quot;pretty maiden.&quot; There is an additional story: The name &quot;Kalama&quot; was first mentioned in 1806 in the Lewis and Clark Journals (&quot;Cath la haws Creek&quot;, &quot;CalamsRiver&quot;, and &quot;Calamas&quot;) in their reference to what is now known as the Kalama River (this story predates all of the others). Gabriel Franchère, in 1811, wrote of the Indian village at the mouth of the Kalama River, adding that it was called &quot;Thlakalamah&quot; .

==History==
Kalama was first settled by Native Americans, particularly members of the Cowlitz Indian Tribes. Others maintain that the town name is associated with John Kalama (), a carpenter from the Hawaiian island of Maui who came to the Pacific Northwest on a fur-trading vessel in the 1830s. (The name &quot;Kalama&quot; also originates in the Hawaiian language and means &quot;tree of ebony&quot; or &quot;the torch&quot;) John Kalama married a Nisqually tribe woman, Mary Martin, and worked on a farm repairing fish barrels, among other jobs. Mary died early and John remarried; he had a daughter about whom little is known and a son called Peter (1864–1947).

The first white settler recorded was in 1853. That first settler was Ezra Meeker and his family. Only one year later, Meeker moved to north Puyallup, Washington, but he sold his Donation Land Claim to a Mr. John Davenport, who, with a few others, permanently settled in the Kalama area. In early 1870, Northern Pacific Railway scouts came to Cowlitz County to find an ideal terminus along the Columbia River. After a failed negotiation for a Donation Land Claim in Martin&#x27;s Bluff, south of Kalama, Northern Pacific officials purchased in Kalama for the terminus of the new railroad as well as a new headquarters. The population swelled with employees of the Northern Pacific Railway.
Kalama was entirely a Northern Pacific railroad creation. It was unofficially born in May 1870 when the Northern Pacific railroad turned the first shovel of dirt. Northern Pacific built a dock, a sawmill, a car shop, a roundhouse, a turntable, hotels, a hospital, stores, homes. In just a few months in 1870, the working population skyrocketed to approximately 3,500 and the town had added tents, saloons, a brewery, and a gambling hall. Soon the town had a motto: &quot;Rail Meets Sail&quot;. Recruiters went to San Francisco and recruited Chinese labor, who moved to their own Chinatown in a part of Kalama now called China Gardens. The population of Kalama peaked at 5,000 people, but in early 1874, the railroad moved its headquarters to Tacoma, and by 1877, only 700 people remained in Kalama.

Kalama was unofficially incorporated on November 29, 1871. It served as the county seat of Cowlitz County from 1872 to 1922. Kalama was the northern terminus of a railroad ferry operated by the Northern Pacific Railway from Goble, Oregon. This was a critical link in rail service between 1883 when the service began until 1909 when the major rail bridges near Portland across the Columbia and Willamette rivers were completed.

Kalama originated with a stake driven by Gen. John W. Sprague of the Northern Pacific Railway who in March 1870 selected a spot near the mouth of the Kalama river to mark the beginning point of Northern Pacific&#x27;s Pacific Division. From that stake, the Northern Pacific began building north to Puget Sound, ultimately reaching Commencement Bay at what was to become Tacoma before going bankrupt. Construction began in April 1871 with a crew of 800 men, with the official &#x27;first spike&#x27; being driven in May 1871 Scheduled service from Tacoma to Kalama began on January 5, 1874. The Portland-Hunters rail line in Oregon across the Columbia River from Kalama was completed in 1883 by Northern Pacific, about the same time that the ceremonial spike was driven at a site west of Helena, Montana to mark the completion of the transcontinental Northern Pacific Railroad in the fall of 1883. The following year in October 1884, a 3 track, long railroad ferry, &quot;Tacoma,&quot; marked the beginning of about 25 years of ferry service across the Columbia River.
Hunters was located near the south end of Sandy Island about a mile south of Goble. However the crossing times were excessive when the &quot;Tacoma&quot; had to work against the tide, and the ferry slip was soon moved to Goble at the north end of Sandy Island and directly across from Kalama. The ferry could handle 12 passenger cars or 27 freight cars.

===Historic buildings===

St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Parish was built in 1874, around the same time the railroad between Kalama and Tacoma first became operational. This was the first and only Catholic parish in Kalama.
