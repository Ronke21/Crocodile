<text>John III ( ; 6 June 1502 – 11 June 1557), nicknamed The Pious (Portuguese: &quot;o Piedoso&quot;), was the King of Portugal and the Algarve from 1521 until he died in 1557. He was the son of King Manuel I and Maria of Aragon, the third daughter of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. John succeeded his father in 1521 at the age of nineteen.

During his rule, Portuguese possessions were extended in Asia and the Americas through the Portuguese colonization of Brazil. John III&#x27;s policy of reinforcing Portugal&#x27;s bases in India, such as Goa, secured Portugal&#x27;s monopoly over the spice trade of cloves and nutmeg from the Maluku Islands. On the eve of his death in 1557, the Portuguese Empire had a global dimension and spanned almost .

During his reign, the Portuguese became the first Europeans to contact Muromachi Japan. He abandoned Muslim territories in North Africa in favor of trade with India and investments in Brazil. In Europe, he improved relations with the Baltic region and the Rhineland, hoping that this would bolster Portuguese trade.

==Early life==

John, the eldest son of King Manuel I born from his second wife Maria of Aragon, was born in Lisbon on 6 June 1502. The event was marked by the presentation of Gil Vicente&#x27;s &quot;Visitation Play or the Monologue of the Cowherd&quot; (&quot;Auto da Visitação ou Monólogo do Vaqueiro&quot;) in the queen&#x27;s chamber.

The young prince was sworn heir to the throne in 1503, the year his youngest sister, Isabella of Portugal, Empress Consort of the Holy Roman Empire between 1527 and 1538, was born.

John was educated by notable scholars of the time, including the astrologer Tomás de Torres, Diogo de Ortiz, Bishop of Viseu, and Luís Teixeira Lobo, one of the first Portuguese Renaissance humanists, rector of the University of Siena (1476) and Professor of Law at Ferrara (1502). He studied Latin, Greek, mathematics, and cosmography.

John&#x27;s chronicler António de Castilho said that, &quot;Dom João III faced problems easily, complementing his lack of culture with a practice formation that he always showed during his reign&quot; (&quot;Elogio d&#x27;el rei D. João de Portugal, terceiro, do nome&quot;). In 1514 he was given his own house, and a few years later began to help his father in administrative duties.

At the age of sixteen John was chosen to marry his first cousin, the 20-year-old Eleanor of Austria, the eldest daughter of Philip the Handsome of Austria-Burgundy and Queen Joanna of Castile, but instead she married his widowed father Manuel. John took deep offence at this: his chroniclers say he became melancholic and was never quite the same. Some historians also argue this was one of the main reasons that John later became fervently religious, giving him the name of &quot;the Pious&quot; (Portuguese: &quot;o Piedoso&quot;).

===Initial reign===
On 19 December 1521 John was crowned king in the Church of São Domingos in Lisbon, beginning a thirty-six-year reign characterized by extensive activity in internal and overseas politics, especially in relations with other major European states. John III continued the absolutist politics of his predecessors. He called the Portuguese Cortes only three times and at great intervals: 1525 in Torres Novas, 1535 in Évora and 1544 in Almeirim. During the early part of his reign, he also tried to restructure administrative and judicial life in his realm.

The marriage of John&#x27;s sister Isabella of Portugal to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, enabled the Portuguese king to forge a stronger alliance with Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. To strengthen his ties with Austria he married his maternal first cousin Catherine of Austria, younger sister of Charles V and his erstwhile fiancée Eleanor, in the town of Crato. John III had nine children from that marriage, but most of them died at young age. By the time of John&#x27;s death, only his grandson Sebastian was alive to inherit the crown.

==Policy==

The large and far-flung Portuguese Empire was difficult and expensive to administer and was burdened with huge external debt and trade deficits. Portugal&#x27;s Indian and Far Eastern interests grew increasingly chaotic under the poor administration of ambitious governors. John III responded with new appointments that proved troubled and short-lived: in some cases, the new governors even had to fight their predecessors to take up their appointments. The resulting failures in administration brought on a gradual decline of the Portuguese trade monopoly. Considering the challenging military situation Portuguese forces faced worldwide, on 7 August 1549, John III declared every male subject between 20 and 65 years old recruitable for military service.

Among John III&#x27;s many colonial governors in Asia were Vasco da Gama, Pedro Mascarenhas, Lopo Vaz de Sampaio, Nuno da Cunha, Estêvão da Gama, Martim Afonso de Sousa, João de Castro and Henrique de Meneses.
Overseas, the Empire was threatened by the Ottoman Empire in both the Indian Ocean and North Africa, causing Portugal to increase spending on defense and fortifications. In the Atlantic, where Portuguese ships already had to withstand constant attacks of privateers, an attempted expansion of the French colonial empire in Brazil, France Antarctique, created yet another front. The French allied with indigenous peoples of South America against the Portuguese, and military and political interventions were used. Eventually, the French were forced out, but not until 1565.

In the first years of John III&#x27;s reign, explorations in the Far East continued, and the Portuguese reached China and Japan; however, these accomplishments were offset by pressure from a strengthening Ottoman Empire under Suleiman the Magnificent, and especially in India, where attacks became more frequent. The expense of defending Indian interests was huge. To pay for it, John III abandoned several strongholds in North Africa: Safim, Azemmour, Ksar es-Seghir and Arzila.

John III achieved a crucial political victory in securing the control of the Maluku Islands, the &quot;Spice Islands&quot; claimed by Spain since the Magellan expedition. After almost a decade of skirmishes in Southeast Asia, he signed the Treaty of Zaragoza with Emperor Charles V on 22 April 1529. It defined the areas of Spanish and Portuguese influence in Asia and established the anti-meridian to the Treaty of Tordesillas.

===International relations===
The reign of John III was marked by active diplomacy. With Spain, he made alliances through marriage that ensured peace in the Iberian Peninsula for years. He married Catherine of Austria, the daughter of Philip the Handsome, the king of Castile and the Burgundian Netherlands. His sister, Isabella of Portugal, married Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. His daughter Maria Manuela married King Philip II of Spain – and there were others. However, the intermarriage of these closely related royal families may have contributed to the poor health of John&#x27;s children and future King Sebastian of Portugal.

John III remained neutral during the war between France and Spain but stood firm in fighting the attacks of French privateers.

He strengthened relations with the Papal States by establishing the Portuguese Inquisition in 1536, as well as the adhesion of the Portuguese clergy to the Counter-Reformation. This relationship with the Catholic Church made it possible for John to name whoever he desired for important religious positions in Portugal: his brothers Henry and Afonso were made cardinals and his biological son, Duartem was made archbishop of Braga.

Commercial relations were intensified with England, the countries of the Baltic region, and Flanders during John III&#x27;s reign. Meanwhile, on the opposite side of the world, Portugal was the first European nation to contact Japan. In China, Macau was offered to the Portuguese, and soon, Portugal controlled significant trade routes in the area. In South Asia, the Portuguese continued their hostile stance against Muslim rivals and insurgent Indian leaders.

==Culture==

John III&#x27;s support for the humanist cause was significant. He patronized various writers, including Gil Vicente, Garcia de Resende, Sá de Miranda, Bernardim Ribeiro, Fernão Mendes Pinto, João de Barros and Luís de Camões. He also supported the mathematician Pedro Nunes and the physician Garcia de Orta. Through his links to Portuguese humanists such as Luís Teixeira Lobo, Erasmus dedicated his &quot;Chrysostomi Lucubrationes&quot; to John III of Portugal in 1527. French mathematician Jean Fernel and Spanish academic Juan Luis Vives also dedicated works to the king.

John awarded many scholarships to universities abroad, mainly in the University of Paris, where fifty Portuguese students were sent to the Collège Sainte-Barbe headed by Diogo de Gouveia. He definitively transferred the Portuguese university from Lisbon to Coimbra in 1537.

In 1547 John established in Coimbra a College of Arts and Humanities (Liberal arts) and invited André de Gouveia, principal of the College of Guienne in Bordeaux, to head the college and organize faculty. André de Gouveia assembled a group of Scottish, French, and Portuguese scholars who had been educated in France. Those included George Buchanan, Diogo de Teive, Jerónimo Osório, Nicolas de Grouchy, Guillaume Guérante and Élie Vinet, who were decisive for the dissemination of the contemporary research of Pedro Nunes. However, rivalry between the orthodox views of the &quot;Parisians&quot; group headed by Diogo de Gouveia and the more secular views of the &quot;Bordeaux&quot; school headed by his nephew André de Gouveia led to accusations of heterodoxy and Protestant sympathies, resulting in all foreign professors leaving by 1551. The Society of Jesus took over administration of the college in 1555.

Another noteworthy aspect of John III&#x27;s rule was the support he gave to missionaries in the New World, Asia and Africa. In 1540, after successive appeals to Pope Paul III asking for missionaries for the Portuguese East Indies under the &quot;Padroado&quot; agreement, John III appointed Francis Xavier to take charge as Apostolic Nuncio. He had been enthusiastically endorsed by Diogo de Gouveia, his teacher at the Collège Sainte-Barbe, and advised the king to draw the youngsters of the newly formed Society of Jesus. The Jesuits were particularly important for mediating Portuguese relations with native peoples.

==Inquisition==

John III was persuaded to establish the Inquisition in Portugal by pressure from neighboring Castile and reports that New Christians had failed to properly renounce Judaism. Following ten years of negotiations with Rome, a Portuguese Inquisition received papal dispensation in 1536. The first Grand Inquisitor was Cardinal Henry, the king&#x27;s brother (who would later himself become king).

The activities of the Inquisition extended from book censorship, repression and trial for divination, witchcraft and bigamy, as well as the prosecution of sexual crimes, especially sodomy. Because Protestants and Jews did not have a significant presence in Portugal, the Inquisition instead targeted New Christians. 

The Inquisition in Portugal gradually became a remarkably powerful entity with its own extensive bureaucracy. There were inquisitorial courts in Lisbon, Coimbra, Évora and Goa that each featured a central office and employed dozens of officials. The Inquisition&#x27;s procedures were severe and irregular, accepting any denunciation as evidence, denying prisoners the right to choose their defenders, and allowing no appeal outside the Inquisition. Punishments ranged from fines and imprisonment to property confiscation and banishment, with executions for heresy carried out by Crown justice. Between 1543 and 1684, at least 1,379 people were burned at the stake, and a minimum of 19,247 were condemned, with many dying in prison without trial.

==Imperial management==
===Luso-African relations===
In John III&#x27;s time, trade between the Portuguese and Africans was extremely intense in &quot;feitorias&quot; such Arguim, Mina, Mombasa, Sofala or Mozambique. Under John III, several expeditions started in coastal Africa and advanced to the interior of the continent. These expeditions were formed by groups of navigators, merchants, adventurers and missionaries. Missions in Africa were established by the College of Arts of Coimbra. The objective was to increase the king&#x27;s dominion, develop peaceful relations and to Christianize the indigenous peoples. Relations with local rulers were often complicated by trade in slaves, as shown by John&#x27;s correspondence with them.

John III refused to abandon all of the Portuguese North African strongholds, but he had to make choices based on the economic or strategic value of each possession. John III decided to leave Safim and Azamor in 1541, followed by Arzila and Alcácer Ceguer in 1549. The fortresses of Ceuta, Tangiers and Mazagan were strengthened &quot;to face the new military techniques, imposed by the generalization of heavy artillery, combined with light fire weapons and blades&quot;.

John III&#x27;s court jester was João de Sá Panasco, a black African, who was eventually admitted to the prestigious Order of Saint James based on his service in the Conquest of Tunis (1535).

===Luso-Asian relations===
Before the reign of John III, the Portuguese had already reached Siam (1511), the Maluku Islands (1512), the Chinese littoral (1513), Canton (1517) and Timor (1515). During John&#x27;s rule the Portuguese reached Japan, and at the end of John&#x27;s reign Macau was offered to Portugal by China. From India, John III imported an amazing variety of spices, herbs, minerals, and fabrics; from Malacca, exotic woods and spice; from Bengala, fabrics and exotic foodstuffs; from Alexandria and Cairo, exotic woods, metals, minerals, fabrics, and boullion; and from China, musk, rhubarb and silk in exchange for gromwells, pearls, horses from Arabia and Persia, non-worked silk, silk embroidery threads, fruits of the date palm, raisins, salt, sulphur and many other goods.

As Muslims and other peoples constantly attacked Portuguese fleets in India, and because it was so far away from mainland Portugal, it was extremely difficult for John III to secure Portuguese dominion in this area. A viceroy (or Governor-General with extensive powers) was nominated, but it was not enough to defend the Portuguese possessions in India. The Portuguese started by creating &quot;feitorias&quot; – commercial strongholds in Cochin, Cannanore, Coulão, Cranganore and Tanor – with the initial objective of establishing just a commercial dominion in the region.

The hostility of many Indian kingdoms and alliances between sultans and zamorins with the intent of expelling the Portuguese made it necessary for the Europeans to establish a sovereign state. Portugal thus militarily occupied some key cities on the Indian coast and Goa became the headquarters of the Portuguese Empire in the East as of 1512. Goa became a starting point for the introduction of European cultural and religious values in India, and churches, schools and hospitals were built. Goa remained an overseas possession of Portugal until India reclaimed it in 1961.

The Portuguese arrived in Japan in 1543. Japan had been known in Portugal since the time of Marco Polo, who called it &quot;Cipango&quot;. Whether Portuguese nationals were the first Europeans to arrive in Japan is debated. Some say the first Portuguese arrival was the writer Fernão Mendes Pinto, while others say it was the navigators António Peixoto, António Mota, and Francisco Zeimoto.

Portuguese traders started negotiating with Japan as early as of 1550 and established a base there in Nagasaki. By then, trade with Japan was a Portuguese monopoly under the rule of a captain. Because the Portuguese established themselves in Macau, Chinese commercial relations and the silver trade with Japan were improved under John III&#x27;s rule.

After the voyage of Ferdinand Magellan, the Crown of Castile claimed the recently discovered Maluku Islands. In 1524, a conference of experts (cartographers, cosmographers, pilots, etc.) was held to solve the dispute caused by the difficulty of determining the meridian agreed to in the Treaty of Tordesillas. The Portuguese delegation sent by John III included names such as António de Azevedo Coutinho, Diogo Lopes de Sequeira, Lopo Homem and Simão Fernandes. The dispute was settled in 1529 by the Treaty of Zaragoza, signed by John III and Charles I of Spain. The Portuguese paid 350,000 gold &quot;ducados&quot; to Spain and secured their presence in the islands, which was not actually necessary, since Portugal was actually entitled to the islands according to the Treaty of Tordesillas.

In 1553, Leonel de Sousa obtained authorization for the Portuguese to establish themselves in Canton and Macau. Macau was later offered to John III as a reward for Portuguese assistance against maritime piracy in the period between 1557 and 1564.

===Portuguese America===

During the reign of King John III the Portuguese Empire established itself in South America with the foundation of the twelve Captaincy Colonies of Brazil (from 1534 onwards). Each with its own donatary captain, the twelve colonies worked independently. In 1549, John III established the Governorate General of Brazil, and the twelve captaincy colonies became subordinate to it. The first Governor-General appointed by John III, Tomé de Sousa, founded the city of Salvador, Bahia (São Salvador da Bahia de Todos os Santos) in 1549. For his role in the colonization of South America, John III has been referred to as The Colonizer (Portuguese: &quot;o Colonizador&quot;).

Immediately following the discovery of Brazil in 1500, the Portuguese imported brazilwood, Indian slaves and exotic birds from there. Brazilian wood was a very appreciated product in Europe because it could be used to produce a type of red dye. During John III&#x27;s rule, after the initial colonization, Portuguese explorers intensified the search for brazilwood and began the cultivation of sugarcane, which was well suited to the climate of Brazil and especially around Recife and Bahia.

In the final years of John&#x27;s reign Portugal&#x27;s colony of Brazil was just beginning its rapid development as a producer of sugar that compensated for the gradual decline of revenues from Asia, a development that would continue during the reign of his grandson and successor, Sebastian (1557–1578). Since Brazil lacked a large native population and the ones who lived there weren&#x27;t adapted to the strenuous work required in the plantation fields, the Portuguese colonists began importing African slaves to strengthen the workforce present in the territory. The first slaves, from the region of Guinea, arrived in Brazil in 1539. Most of them worked in the sugarcane fields or served as house servants.

==Death and dynastic issue ==
From 1539, the heir to the throne was João Manuel, Prince of Portugal, who married Joanna of Austria, Princess of Portugal, daughter of Charles V. The sole son of John III to survive childhood, Prince John, was sick and died at young age (of juvenile diabetes), eighteen days before his wife gave birth to Prince Sebastian on 20 January 1554. When John III died of apoplexy in 1557, his only heir was his three-year-old grandson, Sebastian.
John III&#x27;s body rests in the Monastery of Jerónimos in Lisbon.

==Style==

Like his predecessors John III used the style &quot;&quot;El-rei&quot; (the king) followed by &quot;Dom&quot;&quot; (abbreviated to D.), a mark of high esteem for a distinguished Christian nobleman.

The official style was the same used by his father Manuel I: &quot;Dom João, by the grace of God, King of Portugal, of the Algarves, of either side of the sea in Africa, Lord of Guinea, &amp; of the Conquest, Navigation, &amp; Commerce of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia, &amp; India&quot; (&quot;Dom João, por graça de Deus, Rei de Portugal, e dos Algarves, d&#x27;aquém e d&#x27;além mar em África, Senhor da Guiné, e da Conquista, Navegação, &amp; Comércio da Etiópia, Arábia, Pérsia, &amp; Índia&quot;). This style would only change in the 19th century when Brazil became a Vice-Kingdom.

==Ancestry==
==In popular culture==
John III of Portugal figures in José Saramago&#x27;s 2008 novel &quot;The Elephant&#x27;s Journey&quot;.

John III features in Laurent Binet&#x27;s 2021 novel &quot;Civilizations&quot;.

John III was mentioned in the historical Thai film &quot;The Legend of Suriyothai&quot; in 2001, but his role was cut when it was released.

John III (referred to as João III) leads the Portuguese civilization in the 2016 4X video game Civilization VI, being released in the Portugal Pack on 25 March 2021, as part of the &quot;New Frontier Pass&quot; DLC. His ability and civilization focuses on maritime trade.

<text>Virtual private network (VPN) is a network architecture for virtually extending a private network (i.e. any computer network which is not the public Internet) across one or multiple other networks which are either untrusted (as they are not controlled by the entity aiming to implement the VPN) or need to be isolated (thus making the lower network invisible or not directly usable). 

A VPN can extend access to a private network to users who do not have direct access to it, such as an office network allowing secure access from off-site over the Internet. This is achieved by creating a link between computing devices and computer networks by the use of network tunneling protocols.

It is possible to make a VPN secure to use on top of insecure communication medium (such as the public internet) by choosing a tunneling protocol that implements encryption. This kind of VPN implementation has the benefit of reduced costs and greater flexibility, with respect to dedicated communication lines, for remote workers.

The term &quot;VPN&quot; is also used to refer to VPN services which sell access to their own private networks for internet access by connecting their customers using VPN tunneling protocols.

== Motivation ==
The goal of a virtual private network is to allow network hosts to exchange network messages across another network to access private content, as if they were part of the same network. This is done in a way that makes crossing the intermediate network transparent to network applications. Users of a network connectivity service may consider such an intermediate network to be untrusted, since it is controlled by a third-party, and might prefer a VPN implemented via protocols that protect the privacy of their communication.

In the case of a Provider-provisioned VPN, the goal is not to protect against untrusted networks, but to isolate parts of the provider&#x27;s own network infrastructure in virtual segments, in ways that make the contents of each segment private with respect to the others. This situation makes many other tunneling protocols suitable for building PPVPNs, even with weak or no security features (like in VLAN).

== VPN general working ==
How a VPN works depends on which technologies and protocols the VPN is built upon. A tunneling protocol is used to transfer the network messages from one side to the other. The goal is to take network messages from applications on one side of the tunnel and replay them on the other side. Applications do not need to be modified to let their messages pass through the VPN, because the virtual network or link is made available to the OS.

Applications that do implement tunneling or proxying features for themselves without making such features available as a network interface, are not to be considered VPN implementations but may achieve the same or similar end-user goal of exchanging private contents with a remote network.

== VPN topology configurations ==

Virtual private networks configurations can be classified depending on the purpose of the virtual extension, which makes different tunneling strategies appropriate for different topologies:

;Remote access
: A &quot;host-to-network&quot; configuration is analogous to joining one or more computers to a network to which they cannot be directly connected. This type of extension provides that computer access to local area network of a remote site, or any wider enterprise networks, such as an intranet. Each computer is in charge of activating its own tunnel towards the network it wants to join. The joined network is only aware of a single remote host for each tunnel. This may be employed for remote workers, or to enable people accessing their private home or company resources without exposing them on the public Internet. Remote access tunnels can be either on-demand or always-on. Because the remote host location is usually unknown to the central network until the former tries to reach it, proper implementations of this configuration require the remote host to initiate the communication towards the central network it is accessing.

;Site-to-site
: A &quot;site-to-site&quot; configuration connects two networks. This configuration expands a network across geographically disparate locations. Tunneling is only done between gateway devices located at each network location. These devices then make the tunnel available to other local network hosts that aim to reach any host on the other side. This is useful to keep sites connected to each other in a stable manner, like office networks to their headquarters or datacenter. In this case, any side may be configured to initiate the communication as long as it knows how to reach the other. 

In the context of site-to-site configurations, the terms &quot;intranet&quot; and &quot;extranet&quot; are used to describe two different use cases. An &quot;intranet&quot; site-to-site VPN describes a configuration where the sites connected by the VPN belong to the same organization, whereas an &quot;extranet&quot; site-to-site VPN joins sites belonging to multiple organizations.

Typically, individuals interact with remote access VPNs, whereas businesses tend to make use of site-to-site connections for business-to-business, cloud computing, and branch office scenarios. However, these technologies are not mutually exclusive and, in a significantly complex business network, may be combined.

Apart from the general topology configuration, a VPN may also be characterized by:
* the tunneling protocol used to tunnel the traffic.
* the tunnel&#x27;s termination point location, e.g., on the customer edge or network-provider edge.
* the security features provided.
* the OSI layer they present to the connecting network, such as Layer 2 link/circuit or Layer 3 network connectivity.
* the number of simultaneous allowed tunnels.
* the relationship between the actor implementing the VPN and the network infrastructure owner/provider, and whether the former trusts the medium of the former or not.

A variety of VPN technics exist to adapt to the above characteristics, each providing different network tunneling capabilities and different security model coverage or interpretation.

== VPN native and third-party support ==
Operating systems vendors and developers do typically offer native support to a selection of VPN protocols which is subject to change over the years, as some have been proven to be unsecure with respect to modern requirements and expectations, and some others emerged.

=== VPN support in consumer operating systems ===
Desktop, smartphone and other end-user device operating systems do usually support configuring remote access VPN from their graphical or command-line tools. However, due to the variety of, often non standard, VPN protocols there exists many third-party applications that implement additional protocols not yet or no more natively supported by the OS.

For instance, Android lacked native IPsec IKEv2 support until version 11, and people needed to install third-party apps in order to connect that kind of VPNs, while Microsoft Windows, BlackBerry OS and others got it supported in the past.

Conversely, Windows does not support plain IPsec IKEv1 remote access native VPN configuration (commonly used by Cisco and Fritz!Box VPN solutions) which makes the use of third-party applications mandatory for people and companies relying on such VPN protocol.

=== VPN support in network devices ===
Network appliances, such as firewalls, do often include VPN gateway functionality for either remote access or site-to-site configurations. Their administration interfaces do often facilitate setting up virtual private networks with a selection of supported protocols which have been integrated for an easy out-of-box setup.

In some cases, like in the open source operating systems devoted to firewalls and network devices (like OpenWrt, IPFire, PfSense or OPNsense) it is possible to add support for additional VPN protocols by installing missing software components or third-party apps.

Similarly, it is possible to get additional VPN configurations working, even if the OS does not facilitate the setup of that particular configuration, by manually editing internal configurations of by modifying the open source code of the OS itself. For instance, pfSense does not support remote access VPN configurations through its user interface where the OS runs on the remote host, while provides comprehensive support for configuring it as the central VPN gateway of such remote-access configuration scenario. 

Otherwise, commercial appliances with VPN features based on proprietary hardware/software platforms, usually support a consistent VPN protocol across their products but do not open up for customizations outside the use cases they intended to implement. This is often the case for appliances that rely on hardware acceleration of VPNs to provide higher throughput or support a larger amount of simultaneously connected users. 

==Security mechanisms==
Whenever a VPN is intended to virtually extend a private network over a third-party untrusted medium, it is desirable that the chosen protocols match the following security model:
* confidentiality to prevent disclosure of private information or data sniffing, such that even if the network traffic is sniffed at the packet level (see network sniffer or deep packet inspection), an attacker would see only encrypted data, not the raw data
* message integrity to detect and reject any instances of tampering with transmitted messages, data packets are secured by tamper proofing via a message authentication code (MAC), which prevents the message from being altered or tampered without being rejected due to the MAC not matching with the altered data packet.
VPN are not intended to make connecting users anonymous or unidentifiable from the untrusted medium network provider perspective. If the VPN makes use of protocols that do provide those confidentiality features, their usage can increase user privacy by making the untrusted medium owner unable to access the private data exchanged across the VPN.

===Authentication===
In order to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the VPN, most protocols can be implemented in ways that also enable authentication of connecting parties. This secures the joined remote network confidentiality, integrity and availability.

Tunnel endpoints can be authenticated in various ways during the VPN access initiation. Authentication can happen immediately on VPN initiation (e.g. by simple whitelisting of endpoint IP address), or very lately after actual tunnels are already active (e.g. with a web captive portal).

Remote-access VPNs, which are typically user-initiated, may use passwords, biometrics, two-factor authentication, or other cryptographic methods. People initiating this kind of VPN from unknown arbitrary network locations are also called &quot;road-warriors&quot;. In such cases, it is not possible to use originating network properties (e.g. IP addresses) as secure authentication factors, and stronger methods are needed.

Site-to-site VPNs often use passwords (pre-shared keys) or digital certificates. Depending on the VPN protocol, they may store the key to allow the VPN tunnel to establish automatically, without intervention from the administrator.

==VPN protocols to highlight==

A virtual private network is based on a tunneling protocol, and may be possibly combined with other network or application protocols providing extra capabilities and different security model coverage.

* Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) was initially developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for IPv6, and was required in all standards-compliant implementations of IPv6 before made it only a recommendation. This standards-based security protocol is also widely used with IPv4. Its design meets most security goals: availability, integrity, and confidentiality. IPsec uses encryption, encapsulating an IP packet inside an IPsec packet. De-encapsulation happens at the end of the tunnel, where the original IP packet is decrypted and forwarded to its intended destination. IPsec tunnels are set up by Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol. IPsec tunnels made with IKE version 1 (also known as IKEv1 tunnels, or often just &quot;IPsec tunnels&quot;) can be used alone to provide VPN, but have been often combined to the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP). Their combination made possible to reuse existing L2TP-related implementations for more flexible authentication features (e.g. Xauth), desirable for remote-access configurations. IKE version 2, which was created by Microsoft and Cisco, can be used alone to provide IPsec VPN functionality. Its primary advantages are the native support for authenticating via the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) and that the tunnel can be seamlessly restored when the IP address of the associated host is changing, which is typical of a roaming mobile device, whether on 3G or 4G LTE networks. IPsec is also often supported by network hardware accelerators, which makes IPsec VPN desirable for low-power scenarios, like always-on remote access VPN configurations.
* Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) can tunnel an entire network&#x27;s traffic (as it does in the OpenVPN project and SoftEther VPN project) or secure an individual connection. A number of vendors provide remote-access VPN capabilities through TLS. A VPN based on TLS can connect from locations where the usual TLS web navigation (HTTPS) is supported without special extra configurations,
* Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) – used in Cisco AnyConnect VPN and in OpenConnect VPN to solve the issues TLS has with tunneling over TCP (SSL/TLS are TCP-based, and tunneling TCP over TCP can lead to big delays and connection aborts).
* Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE) works with the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol and in several compatible implementations on other platforms.
* Microsoft Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP) tunnels Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) or Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol traffic through an SSL/TLS channel (SSTP was introduced in Windows Server 2008 and in Windows Vista Service Pack 1).
* Multi Path Virtual Private Network (MPVPN). Ragula Systems Development Company owns the registered trademark &quot;MPVPN&quot;.
* Secure Shell (SSH) VPN – OpenSSH offers VPN tunneling (distinct from port forwarding) to secure remote connections to a network, inter-network links, and remote systems. OpenSSH server provides a limited number of concurrent tunnels. The VPN feature itself does not support personal authentication. SSH is more often used to remotely connect to machines or networks instead of a site to site VPN connection.
* WireGuard is a protocol. In 2020, WireGuard support was added to both the Linux and Android kernels, opening it up to adoption by VPN providers. By default, WireGuard utilizes the Curve25519 protocol for key exchange and ChaCha20-Poly1305 for encryption and message authentication, but also includes the ability to pre-share a symmetric key between the client and server.
*OpenVPN is a free and open-source VPN protocol based on the TLS protocol. It supports perfect forward-secrecy, and most modern secure cipher suites, like AES, Serpent, TwoFish, etc. It is currently being developed and updated by OpenVPN Inc., a non-profit providing secure VPN technologies.
*Crypto IP Encapsulation (CIPE) is a free and open-source VPN implementation for tunneling IPv4 packets over UDP via encapsulation. CIPE was developed for Linux operating systems by Olaf Titz, with a Windows port implemented by Damion K. Wilson. Development for CIPE ended in 2002.

==Trusted delivery networks==
Trusted VPNs do not use cryptographic tunneling; instead, they rely on the security of a single provider&#x27;s network to protect the traffic.
* Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) often overlays VPNs, often with quality-of-service control over a trusted delivery network.
* L2TP which is a standards-based replacement, and a compromise taking the good features from each, for two proprietary VPN protocols: Cisco&#x27;s Layer 2 Forwarding (L2F) (obsolete ) and Microsoft&#x27;s Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP).

From a security standpoint, a VPN must either trust the underlying delivery network or enforce security with a mechanism in the VPN itself. Unless the trusted delivery network runs among physically secure sites only, both trusted and secure models need an authentication mechanism for users to gain access to the VPN.

==VPNs in mobile environments==
Mobile virtual private networks are used in settings where an endpoint of the VPN is not fixed to a single IP address, but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple Wi-Fi access points without dropping the secure VPN session or losing application sessions. Mobile VPNs are widely used in public safety where they give law-enforcement officers access to applications such as computer-assisted dispatch and criminal databases, and in other organizations with similar requirements such as field service management and healthcare.

==Networking limitations==
A limitation of traditional VPNs is that they are point-to-point connections and do not tend to support broadcast domains; therefore, communication, software, and networking, which are based on layer 2 and broadcast packets, such as NetBIOS used in Windows networking, may not be fully supported as on a local area network. Variants on VPN such as Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) and layer 2 tunneling protocols are designed to overcome this limitation.

<text>Wilhelmshaven (, &quot;Wilhelm&#x27;s Harbour&quot;; Northern Low Saxon: &quot;Willemshaven&quot;) is a coastal town in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is situated on the western side of the Jade Bight, a bay of the North Sea, and has a population of 76,089. Wilhelmshaven is the centre of the &quot;Jade Bay&quot; business region (which has around 330,000 inhabitants) and is Germany&#x27;s main military port.

The adjacent Lower Saxony Wadden Sea National Park (part of the Wattenmeer UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site) provides the basis for the major tourism industry in the region.

==History==
The , built before 1383, operated as a pirate stronghold; the Hanseatic League destroyed it in 1433. Four centuries later, the Kingdom of Prussia planned a fleet and a harbour on the North Sea. In 1853, Prince Adalbert of Prussia, a cousin of the Prussian King Frederick William IV, arranged the Jade Treaty (&quot;Jade-Vertrag&quot;) with the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, in which Prussia and the Grand Duchy entered into a contract whereby Oldenburg ceded of its territory at the Jade Bight to Prussia. In 1869 King William I of Prussia (later also German Emperor) founded the town as an exclave of the Province of Hanover and a naval base for Prussia&#x27;s developing fleet. All the hinterland of the city remained a part of Oldenburg.

A shipbuilding yard developed at Wilhelmshaven, the &quot;Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven&quot; (Wilhelmshaven Imperial Shipyard). On 30 June 1934 the &quot;pocket battleship&quot; &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; was launched at Wilhelmshaven. The battleship &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was subsequently laid down a year afterward, before her commissioning in 1939.

In 1937 Wilhelmshaven and the adjacent village Rüstringen merged and the united city, named Wilhelmshaven, became a part of the Free State of Oldenburg.

===World War II===

During World War II (1939–1945), Wilhelmshaven served as the main base of the Kriegsmarine. Allied bombing destroyed two thirds of the town&#x27;s buildings while the main target, the Naval Shipyard Wilhelmshaven, remained operational despite serious damage. A major attack on residential areas of Wilhelmshaven was carried out on 15 October 1944. Various churches, hospitals, schools and many residential buildings were destroyed or severely damaged. During the war, &quot;Alter Banter Weg&quot; (No. 1582 Wilhelmshaven), functioned as a subcamp of the Neuengamme concentration camp.
On 28 April 1945 the Polish First Armored Division captured Wilhelmshaven, and took the surrender of the entire garrison, including over 200 ships of the Kriegsmarine. The Poles remained as part of the Allied occupation forces until 1947.

=== Since 1945 ===
In 1947 the city council decided to seek a new emblem for the city. After the Control Commission for Germany – British Element (CCG/BE) had rejected several designs, Wilhelmshaven selected the image of a Frisian warrior (&quot;Rüstringer Friese&quot;), designed after a nail man erected in the city during the First World War to collect war donations.

Between 1947 and 1972 Wilhelmshaven was the home of Prince Rupert School, a comprehensive boarding school for children of British Army of the Rhine and Royal Air Force Germany personnel serving in West Germany. The school relocated to Rinteln in Lower Saxony in 1972, and closed in 2014. There is an active association of former Wilhelmshaven pupils called The Wilhelmshaven Association. After World War II the shipyard was totally disarmed under the British Commander in Chief, and of course many military buildings were damaged or vacant. While it was prohibited to establish any kind of military-linked businesses, Wilhelmshaven took the opportunity to provide a convenient location for Olympia Werke, which became one of the most popular quality typewriter factories in the world. A workforce of 7,000 worker was employed there in 1953.

==Today==
Wilhelmshaven is Germany&#x27;s only deep-water port, and its largest naval base. Concerning the new plans for the Bundeswehr which took shape in 2011 it has become the largest military base in Germany as well. The German defence forces (German Navy, navy arsenal, logistics centre) together with the public sector, are the main pillars of the local employment market.

The benefits of the deep shipping channel were already recognised at the end of the 1950s with the construction of the first oil tanker jetty. Wilhelmshaven has been the most important German import terminal for crude oil ever since. Pipelines from here supply refineries in the Rhine-Ruhr region and Hamburg. Other major business operations followed, and constructed jetties for crude oil and oil products, coal, and chemical products. 

Planning for a liquefied natural gas terminal for LNG ships began in 2017, but regulatory impediments delayed construction for years. 

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, as gas commitments from the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 undersea Baltic pipelines became unreliable and then unavailable, construction of the Wilhelmshaven LNG terminal was rapidly accelerated from May 2022 to displace some of the pipeline gas imported from Russia. The terminal received its first load of LNG in December 2022.

Another element of the &quot;Wilhelmshaven energy hub&quot; programme is the chemical industry (refinery, PVC, and chlorine gas production), as well as power generation (two coal-fired power stations, wind power). Two short pipelines connect the LNG reception to the industrial zone.

One of the main industrial sectors in Wilhelmshaven is the port industry with its wharves, sea port service companies, service providers and repair businesses, transhipment and handling businesses, agencies, etc... The &quot;JadeWeserPort&quot; – Container Terminal Wilhelmshaven (CTW), operational since 2012 and the development of the neighbouring Freight Village provide prospects for employment in areas such as logistics and distribution. In 2016 Eurogate increased transhipment volume up to 480,000 Container (TEU). And since Volkswagen is interested in using the deep-water facilities the number of employed workers is assumed to rise from 400 to 600.

== Geography and climate ==
Wilhelmshaven has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dolk&quot;). Wilhelmshaven is located on the coast of the North Sea and is influenced by a distinct maritime climate.

<doc id="147137" wikidata="Q471804" url="?curid=147137" title="Ryan Stiles">
<text>Ryan Lee Stiles (born April 22, 1959) is an American-Canadian comedian and actor. His work is often associated with improvisational comedy. He is best known for his work on &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; (both the original British version and the subsequent American version) and for his role as Lewis Kiniski on &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;. He also played Herb Melnick on the CBS comedy &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; and was a performer on the show &quot;Drew Carey&#x27;s Improv-A-Ganza&quot;.

==Early life and career==
The youngest of five children, Ryan Stiles was born in Seattle to Canadian parents Irene and Sonny Stiles. He grew up with his mother, a homemaker, and his father, a supervisor at a Vancouver-based Canadian fish processing plant. When he was ten, his family moved to Vancouver, British Columbia. Ryan Stiles attended R.C. Palmer Junior Secondary School and Richmond Senior Secondary in Richmond, British Columbia. Although he was a good student, Stiles has admitted that &quot;being a high-school senior gave [him] too much freedom.&quot; He got so carried away with his flexible schedule that at age 17, he quit school a few months shy of graduation.

Despite his parents&#x27; objections, he was able to support himself doing stand-up routines at clubs near his home in Vancouver. He helped Rich Elwood start Punchlines Comedy Club. During this time, he was the head writer of &quot;The Don Harron Show&quot; on CTV and the host of &quot;Comedy College&quot; on CBC. Stiles was a regular improv performer with the Vancouver Theatresports League and Punchlines&#x27; &quot;No Name Player&quot; before joining the Second City comedy ensemble at Expo 86. He continued performing with Second City in Toronto and later in Los Angeles.

==Career==
===&quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; and &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;===
By 1989, Stiles had gained the attention of the producers of the British improvisational comedy show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; Stiles was a regular on the show until its end in 1998. His performance on the program earned him both critical praise and a devoted fan following in the United Kingdom. In 1995, Stiles was asked by American comic Drew Carey to be a regular on his sitcom &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;. Stiles played Carey&#x27;s erudite but underachieving best friend, Lewis Kiniski.

In 1998, Carey successfully lobbied ABC to produce an American version of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; Following the final season of the British version in 1998, the American version premiered, with both Stiles and Carey credited as executive producers. Stiles received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program in 2002 for his work on the show. A running gag of the show is Stiles&#x27; flashy dress shoes as well as his frequent impressions of American actress Carol Channing.

Though he never appeared in the series, Stiles (along with Kaitlin Olson) performed in the taping of the unaired pilot episode of &quot;Drew Carey&#x27;s Green Screen Show&quot;, which involved improv games similar to &quot;Whose Line?&quot; games played in front of a massive green screen. Animation was later added to the improv footage.

Stiles returned as performer and executive producer for The CW&#x27;s revival of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; in the summer of 2013.

===Other television and film work===

Stiles appeared in the 1991 film &quot;Hot Shots!&quot; as Mailman Farnham and its 1993 sequel, &quot;Hot Shots! Part Deux&quot;, as marine Rabinowitz. He portrayed recurring character Dr. Herb Melnick on &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; from 2004 until the show&#x27;s end in 2015. He made short guest appearances on &quot;Parker Lewis Can&#x27;t Lose&quot;, &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, &quot;Mad About You&quot;, &quot;Mad TV&quot;, and &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot;. In July 2008, he was a guest star on &quot;Reno 911!&quot; as Sergeant Clift, an acting coach.

During the 1994 Major League Baseball strike, Stiles appeared in several commercials for Nike, hanging out in an empty ballpark, doing things such as playing the organ and attempting to do the wave alone. The commercials ended with the line: &quot;Play ball. Please.&quot;

In 2005, Stiles appeared in the mockumentary &quot;Conker: Celebrity Squirrel&quot; produced for the promotion of the Xbox video game &quot;.&quot; This role led to gamers voting to induct him into the 2015 class of the DK Vine Hall of Fame.

== Philanthropy ==
Stiles has been a frequent fundraiser for children with burn injuries, raising over $500,000 for the Burned Children Recovery Center since 2009 and helping the foundation to recover from the Great Recession.

== Personal life ==
In 1981, Stiles met Patricia McDonald at Punchlines, where she was a waitress. They married in 1988 and have three children together.

When not working, he lives at his home on Lake Samish, outside Bellingham, Washington, where he opened the Upfront Theatre, a small theatre dedicated to live improv comedy.

<text>Video on demand (VOD) is a media distribution system that allows users to access videos, television shows and films digitally on request. These multimedia are accessed without a traditional video playback device and a typical static broadcasting schedule, which was popular under traditional broadcast programming, instead involving newer modes of content consumption that have risen as Internet and IPTV technologies have become prominent, and culminated in the arrival of VOD and over-the-top (OTT) media services on televisions and personal computers.

Television VOD systems can stream content, either through a traditional set-top box or through remote devices such as computers, tablets, and smartphones. VOD users may also permanently download content to a device such as a computer, digital video recorder (DVR) or, a portable media player for continued viewing. The majority of cable and telephone company–based television providers offer VOD streaming, whereby a user selects a video programme that begins to play immediately (i.e., streaming), or downloading to a DVR rented or purchased from the provider, or to a PC or to a portable device for deferred viewing.

Streaming media has emerged as an increasingly popular medium of VOD provision over downloading, including BitTorrent. Desktop client applications such as the Apple iTunes online content store and Smart TV apps such as Amazon Prime Video allow temporary rentals and purchases of video entertainment content. Other Internet-based VOD systems provide users with access to bundles of video entertainment content rather than individual movies and shows. The most common of these systems, Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Peacock, Max and Paramount+, use a subscription model that requires users to pay a monthly fee for access to a selection of movies, television shows, and original series. In contrast, YouTube, another Internet-based VOD system, uses an advertising-funded model in which users can access most of its video content free of charge but must pay a subscription fee for premium content. Some airlines offer VOD services as in-flight entertainment to passengers through video screens embedded in seats or externally provided portable media players.

==Functionality==
Downloading and streaming VOD systems provide the user with features of portable media players and DVD players. Some VOD systems store and stream programs from hard disk drives and use a memory buffer to allow the user to fast-forward and rewind videos. It is possible to put video servers on local area networks; these can provide rapid responses to users. Cable companies have rolled out their own versions of VOD services through apps, allowing television access wherever there is a device that is Internet capable. Cable media companies have combined VOD with live streaming services. The early-2020s launches of apps from cable companies (e.g., NBC&#x27;s Peacock, CBS&#x27;s Paramount+) are attempts to compete with Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD) services because they lack live news and sports content. Streaming video servers can serve a wide community via a WAN, but responsiveness may be reduced. Download VOD services are practical in homes equipped with cable modems or DSL connections. Servers for traditional cable and telco VOD services are usually placed at the cable head-end, serving a particular market, and cable hubs in larger markets. In the telco world, they are placed in either the central office or a newly created location called a Video Head-End Office (VHO).

==History==

VOD services first appeared in the early 1990s. Until then, it was not thought possible that a television programme could be squeezed into the limited telecommunication bandwidth of a copper telephone cable to provide a VOD service of acceptable quality as the required bandwidth of a digital television signal is around 200Mbps, which is 2,000 times greater than the bandwidth of a speech signal over a copper telephone wire.

VOD services were only made possible as a result of two major technological developments: MPEG (motion-compensated DCT) video compression and asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) data transmission.

Plans such as those of the Integrated Network System, a national high-capacity fibre-optic network supporting a range of broadband services in Japan, noted in a more general 1986 publication, were interpreted as conducive to eventual VOD deployment. However, early VOD trials employed existing cable television infrastructure, notably British Telecom&#x27;s video library trial, operated through the Westminster Cable Company. This trial used the Laservision media format and featured a jukebox-like media handling system involving players served by disc carousels, with twelve such handler units capable of serving up to 6,000 customers. Other early VOD systems used tapes as the real-time source of video streams. GTE started as a trial in 1990, with AT&amp;T providing all components. By 1992, VOD servers were supplying previously encoded digital video from disks and DRAM.

In the US, the 1982 anti-trust break-up of AT&amp;T resulted in several smaller telephone companies nicknamed Baby Bells. Following this, the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 prohibited telephone companies from providing video services within their operating regions. In 1993, the National Communication and Information Infrastructure (NII) was proposed and passed by the US House and Senate, opening the way for the seven Baby Bells—Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, NYNEX, Pacific Telesis, Southwestern Bell, and US West—to implement VOD systems. These companies and others began holding trials to set up systems for supplying video on demand over telephone and cable lines.

In November 1992, Bell Atlantic announced a VOD trial. IBM was developing a video server code-named Tiger Shark. Concurrently, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) was developing a scalable video server configured from small-to-large for a range of video streams. Bell Atlantic selected IBM and in April 1993 the system became the first VOD over ADSL to be deployed outside the lab, serving 50 video streams. In June 1993, US West filed for a patent to register a proprietary system consisting of the Digital Equipment Corporation Interactive Information Server, Scientific Atlanta providing the network, and 3DO as the set-top box with video streams and other information to be deployed to 2,500 homes. In 1994–95, US West filed for a patent concerning the provision of VOD in several cities: 330,000 subscribers in Denver, 290,000 in Minneapolis, and 140,000 in Portland. In early 1994, British Telecommunications (BT) introduced a trial VOD service in the United Kingdom. It used the DCT-based MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 video compression standards, along with ADSL technology.

Many VOD trials were held with various combinations of server, network, and set-top box. Of these the primary players in the US were the telephone companies using DEC, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, USA Video, nCube, SGI, and other servers. The DEC server system was the most-used in these trials.

The DEC VOD server architecture used interactive gateways to set up video streams and other information for delivery from any of a large number of VAX servers, enabling it in 1993 to support more than 100,000 streams with full videocassette recorder (VCR)-like functionality. In 1994, it upgraded to a DEC Alpha–based computer for its VOD servers, allowing it to support more than a million users. By 1994 the Oracle scalable VOD system used massively parallel processors to support from 500 to 30,000 users. The SGI system supported 4,000 users. The servers connected to networks of increasing size to eventually support video stream delivery to entire cities.

In the UK, from September 1994, a VOD service formed a major part of the Cambridge Digital Interactive Television Trial. This provided video and data to 250 homes and several schools connected to the Cambridge Cable network, later part of NTL, now Virgin Media. The MPEG-1 encoded video was streamed over an ATM network from an ICL media server to set-top boxes designed by Acorn Online Media. The trial commenced at a speed of 2 Mbit/s to the home, subsequently increased to 25 Mbit/s. The content was provided by the BBC and Anglia Television. Although a technical success, difficulty in sourcing content was a major issue and the project closed in 1996.

In 1997, Enron Corporation had entered the broadband market, constructing and purchasing thousands of miles of fiber-optic cables throughout the United States. In 2001, Enron and Blockbuster Inc. attempted to create a 20-year deal to stream movies on demand over Enron&#x27;s fiber-optic network. The heavily promoted deal failed, with Enron&#x27;s share prices dropping following the announcement.

In 1998, Kingston Communications became the first UK company to launch a fully commercial VOD service and the first to integrate broadcast television and Internet access through a single set-top box using IP delivery over ADSL. By 2001, Kingston Interactive TV had attracted 15,000 subscribers. After several trials, Home Choice followed in 1999 but was restricted to London. After attracting 40,000 customers, they were bought by Tiscali in 2006 which was, in turn, bought by Talk Talk in 2009. Cable TV providers Telewest and (now Virgin Media) launched their VOD services in the United Kingdom in 2005, competing with the leading traditional pay-TV distributor BSkyB, which responded by launching &quot;Sky by broadband&quot;, later renamed &quot;Sky Anytime on PC&quot;. The service went live on 2 January 2006. Sky Anytime on PC uses a legal peer-to-peer approach based on Kontiki technology to provide very-high-capacity multi-point downloads of the video content. Instead of the video content all being downloaded from Sky&#x27;s servers, the content comes from multiple users of the system who have already downloaded the content. Other UK television broadcasters implemented their own versions of the same technology, such as Channel 4&#x27;s 4oD (4 on Demand, now known as All 4) which was launched on 16 November 2006 and the BBC&#x27;s iPlayer, which was launched on 25 December 2007. Another example of online video publishers using legal peer-to-peer technology is based on Giraffic technology, which was launched in early 2011, with large online VOD publishers such as US-based VEOH and UK-based Craze&#x27;s Online Movies Box movie rental service.

Unlike broadcast television, which traditionally has been the most common in the form of over-the-air television, VOD systems initially required each user to have an Internet connection with considerable bandwidth to access each system&#x27;s content. In 2000, the Fraunhofer Institute IIS developed the JPEG2000 codec, which enabled the distribution of movies via Digital Cinema Packages. This technology has since expanded its services from feature-film productions to include broadcast television programmes and has led to lower bandwidth requirements for VOD applications. Disney, Paramount, Sony, Universal and Warner Bros. subsequently launched the Digital Cinema Initiative, in 2002.

The BBC, ITV and Channel 4 planned to launch a joint platform provisionally called Kangaroo in 2008. This was abandoned in 2009 following complaints, which were investigated by the Competition Commission. In that same year, the assets of the now-defunct Kangaroo project were acquired by Arqiva, who used the technology to launch the SeeSaw service in February 2010. A year later, however, SeeSaw was shut down due to a lack of funding.

VOD services are now available in all parts of the United States, which has the highest global take-up rate of VOD. In 2010, 80% of American Internet users had watched video online, and 42% of mobile users who downloaded video preferred apps to a normal browser. Streaming VOD systems are available on desktop and mobile platforms from cable providers (in tandem with cable modem technology). They use the large downstream bandwidth present on their cable systems to deliver movies and television shows to end-users. These viewers can typically pause, fast-forward, and rewind VOD movies due to the low latency and random-access nature of cable technology. The large distribution of a single signal makes streaming VOD impractical for most satellite television systems. Both EchoStar/Dish Network and DirecTV offer VOD programming to PVR-owning subscribers of their satellite TV service. In Demand is a cable VOD service that also offers pay-per-view. Once the programs have been downloaded onto a user&#x27;s PVR, he or she can watch, play, pause, and seek at their convenience. VOD is also common in expensive hotels.

According to the European Audiovisual Observatory, 142 paying VOD services were operational in Europe at the end of 2006. The number increased to 650 by 2009. At the 2010 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, Sezmi CEO Buno Pati and president Phil Wiser showed a set-top box with a one-terabyte hard drive that could be used for video-on-demand services previously offered through cable television and broadband. A movie, for example, could be sent out once using a broadcast signal rather than numerous times over cable or fiber-optic lines, and this would not involve the expense of adding many miles of lines. Sezmi planned to lease part of the broadcast spectrum to offer a subscription service that National Association of Broadcasters President Gordon H. Smith said would provide a superior picture to that of cable or satellite at a lower cost.

Developing VOD requires extensive negotiations to identify a financial model that would serve both content creators and cable providers while providing desirable content for viewers at an acceptable price point. Key factors identified for determining the economic viability of the VOD model include VOD movie buy-rates and setting Hollywood and cable operator revenue splits. Cable providers offered VOD as part of digital subscription packages, which by 2005 primarily allowed cable subscribers to only access an on-demand version of the content that was already provided in the linear traditional broadcasting distribution. These on-demand packages sometimes include extras and bonus footage in addition to the regular content.

== Role of peer-to-peer file sharing ==
Peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing software allows the distribution of content without the linear costs associated with centralised streaming media. This innovation proved it is technically possible to offer the consumer potentially every film ever made, and the popularity and ease of use of such services may have motivated the rise of centralised video-on-demand services. Some services such as Spotify use peer-to-peer distribution to better scale their platforms. Netflix was reported to be considering switching to a P2P model to cope with net neutrality problems from downstream providers.

==Types ==
=== Transactional ===
Transactional video on demand (TVOD) is a distribution method by which customers pay for each piece of video-on-demand content. For example, a customer would pay a fee for each movie or TV show that they watch. TVOD has two sub-categories: electronic sell-through (EST), by which customers can permanently access a piece of content once purchased via the Internet; and download to rent (DTR), by which customers can access the content for a limited time upon renting. Examples of TVOD services include the Apple iTunes Store and the Google Play Store, as well as VOD rental services offered through multichannel television (i.e., cable or satellite) providers.

=== Premium ===
Premium video on demand (PVOD) is a version of TVOD which allows customers to access video-on-demand content several weeks or months earlier then their customary TVOD or home video availability – often feature films made available alongside, or in place of, a traditional release in movie theaters – but at a much higher price point. A version of the model was tested in 2011 by American satellite TV provider DirecTV under the brand name &quot;Home Premiere&quot;, which allowed viewers to rent select films from major studios for US$30 per rental as soon as 60 days after they debuted in cinemas, compared to 120 days for the regular TVOD window; this version only lasted a few months.

PVOD made a return during the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting global closures of cinemas. Certain films that had already been released including &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; were quickly also released on VOD platforms for a higher rental price than usual, while other films including &quot;Trolls World Tour&quot; were released simultaneously on PVOD and in drive-in theaters, or in some cases directly to PVOD only.

In most cases, these PVOD releases are offered through most of the same platforms as traditional TVOD, but at a higher price point, typically about US$20 for a 48-hour rental; this offering has again been branded as &quot;Home Premiere&quot; by some studios and platforms. Disney used the September 2020 release of the live-action remake of &quot;Mulan&quot; to launch a related model called Premier Access; this requires customers to pay a premium fee (approximately US$26–30 depending on country) on top of a subscription to the Disney+ streaming service, but they then retain access as long as they maintain their subscription (for &quot;Mulan&quot;, this was effectively a 90-day rental, as the film became available to all Disney+ subscribers at no extra charge in December).

It has been reported that the pandemic had contributed to a transformation in movie distribution in favor of PVOD over traditional movie houses, as studios were able to realize 80% of revenue through PVOD versus 50% of traditional theater box office receipts. Theater owners including AMC and Cinemark, as well as suppliers including IMAX and National CineMedia, all experienced significant drops in revenues during shutdowns related to COVID-19.

===Subscription models===

Subscription VOD (SVOD) services use a subscription business model in which subscribers are charged a regular fee to access unlimited programs. Examples of these services include Netflix, Hulu, Fandango at Home, Amazon Prime Video, Max, Disney+, Peacock, Paramount+, Apple TV+, Disney+ Hotstar, iQIYI, Star+, Hayu, BET+, Discovery+, Canal+, Crunchyroll, Hidive, SonyLIV, ZEE5, and GulliMax.

===Near video on demand===

Near video on demand (NVOD) is a pay-per-view consumer video technique used by multi-channel broadcasters using high-bandwidth distribution mechanisms such as satellite and cable television. Multiple copies of a programme are broadcast at short time intervals (typically staggered on a schedule of every 10–20 minutes) on linear channels providing convenience for viewers, who can watch the programme without needing to tune in at the only scheduled point in time.

A viewer may only have to wait a few minutes before the next time a movie will be programmed. This form is bandwidth-intensive, reduces the number of channels a provider can offer, and is generally provided by large operators with a great deal of redundant capacity. This concept has been reduced in popularity as video on demand is implemented, along with providers often wanting to provide the maximum throughput for their broadband services possible.

Only the satellite services DirecTV and Dish Network continue to provide NVOD services, as they do not offer broadband and much of their rural customer base only has access to slower dial-up and non-5G wireless and satellite internet options which cannot stream films or have onerous data caps (and where possible, AT&amp;T is now prioritizing their streaming service AT&amp;T TV, which utilizes a fully immediate VOD experience, over DirecTV).

Before the rise of VOD, the cable pay-per-view provider In Demand provided up to 40 channels in 2002, with several films receiving four channels on a staggered schedule to provide the NVOD experience for viewers. As of 2018, most cable pay-per-view channels now number mainly 3–5, and are used mainly for live ring sports events (boxing and professional wrestling), comedy specials, and concerts, though the latter two sources are declining due to streaming services offering much more lucrative performance contracts to performers, and several ring sports organisations (mainly UFC and WWE) now prefer direct marketing of their product via streaming services such as ESPN+, the WWE Network, and the apps of Fox Sports over pay-TV providers which require a portion of the profits they otherwise retain directly. In Australia, pay-TV broadcaster Foxtel offers NVOD for new-release movies over their satellite service.

Edge Spectrum, an American holder of low-power broadcasting licenses, has an eventual business plan to use its network and a system of digital video recorders to simulate the video-on-demand experience. Most of Edge Spectrum&#x27;s channels, where they are on air, carry televangelism.

===Push video on demand===
Push video on demand is so-named because the provider &quot;pushes&quot; the content out to the viewer&#x27;s set-top box without the viewer having requested the content. This technique is used by several broadcasters on systems that lack the connectivity and bandwidth to provide true &quot;streaming&quot; video on demand. Push VOD is also used by broadcasters that want to optimize their video streaming infrastructures by pre-loading the most popular contents to the consumers&#x27; set-top device. If the consumer requests one of these films, it is already loaded on her or his DVR.

A push VOD system uses a personal video recorder (PVR) to store a selection of content, often transmitted in spare capacity overnight or all day long at low bandwidth. Users can watch the downloaded content at the time they desire, immediately and without any buffering issues. Push VOD depends on the viewer recording content so choices can be limited.

===Advertising video on demand===
Advertising video on demand (AVOD) uses an advertising-based revenue model. This allows companies that advertise on broadcast and cable channels to reach people who watch shows using VOD. This model also allows people to watch content without paying subscription fees. Hulu was a major AVOD company before ending its free service in August 2016, transferring it to Yahoo! View using the existing Hulu infrastructure. Crackle has introduced a series of advertisements for the same company that ties into the content that is being watched.

Ad-Supported Video on Demand (ASVOD) refers to video services that provide free content supported by advertisements. Popular services include Pluto TV, Xumo, the Roku Channel, Samsung TV Plus, Amazon Freevee, Popcornflix, Crackle, Tubi, Movies Anywhere, Vudu, Dailymotion, and YouTube. Walmart is adding ASVOD original programming to Vudu, and YouTube Originals will be ASVOD by 2020.

Data analysis

When technology companies, include SVOD apps on their devices, like phones, tablets, televisions, game systems, computers, this can remove an attitude obstruction for a user to view content. This technology also provides an advantage for technology companies for data analysis of viewed content from consumers. By analyzing data of what is viewed most by consumers, companies can purchase more content that is aimed for an audience, and then in-turn market products that are based on what viewer profiles are of a group of consumers who viewer a specific amount of content. This data analysis will often provide researchers valuable data that includes: what was watched, when it was watched, what they watched after watching, and even how many people watched the same video at the same time in a day, month, and even year.

Economics of SVOD

Attendance in movie theaters had declined during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Worldwide in 2019, theatrical entertainment reach 11.4 billion dollars, but in 2020, it was only 2.2 billion. Due recovery efforts to increase those attendance numbers, along with the growing amount of marketing that is need to gain the attention of an audience, pinning down an exact budget for a film production can be difficult. Video on demand can have three release strategies that include: day-and-date (instantaneous release in theaters and on VOD), day-before-date (VOD before theatrical viewing), and VOD only. Production studios can make revenue on these types of releases until sales start to slow. After that, film companies can then license the content to other streaming services and, temporarily, make extra income like that too.

In a reflection made by 2013 Netflix Chief Content Officer, Ted Sarandos, he was quoted saying, &quot;When we launch in a territory the BitTorrent traffic drops as the Netflix traffic grows.&quot; This can be valuably interpreted as in that online piracy numbers drop the more that SVOD companies grow, which in turn means more revenue going back to the production companies.

Behavior detrimental to SVOD revenue

Online piracy is detrimental to production companies that produce digital content. In a study that offered BitTorrent users a free SVOD subscription, the results of the research provided readers with information that show download and upload speeds in those homes decreased with a free subscription, but it could not prove decreased use in BitTorrent software.

<doc id="147145" wikidata="Q217637" url="?curid=147145" title="John II of Portugal">
<text>John II (; ; 3 May 1455 – 25 October 1495), called the Perfect Prince (), was King of Portugal from 1481 until his death in 1495, and also for a brief time in 1477. He is known for reestablishing the power of the Portuguese monarchy, reinvigorating the economy of Portugal, and renewing the Portuguese exploration of Africa and Asia.

==Early life==
Born in Lisbon on 3 May 1455, John was the second son of Afonso V of Portugal and Isabella of Coimbra. At one month old, on 25 June 1455, he was declared legitimate heir to the crown and received an oath of allegiance from the three estates.

In 1468, Afonso V and Henry IV of Castile attempted to arrange a double marriage in which John would marry Henry&#x27;s daughter, Joanna, and Afonso would marry Henry&#x27;s half-sister and heir-presumptive, Isabella of Castile. However, Isabella refused to consent to the arrangement. Instead, John married Eleanor of Viseu, his first cousin and the eldest daughter of Ferdinand, Duke of Viseu, on 22 January 1471.

===Early campaigns===

John accompanied his father in the campaigns in northern Africa and was knighted after the victory in the Conquest of Arzila in August 1471.

====Participation in the War of the Castilian Succession====

Following the death of Henry IV of Castile in December 1474 and the accession of his half-sister, Isabella, a faction of the nobility hostile to Isabella offered the Castilian crown to Afonso V, provided he wed Henry&#x27;s daughter, Joanna. John urged his father to marry Joanna and invade Castile, but leading nobles, namely the Marquis of Vila Viçosa, opposed this conviction. Afonso sent an envoy to assess support for Joanna&#x27;s cause and after receiving &quot;favorable accounts respecting the partisans of the Infanta&quot;, he ordered war preparations to be made for the following spring.

On 12 May 1475, Afonso and John entered Castile with an army of 5,600 cavalry and 14,000 foot soldiers. Afonso V proceeded to Palencia to meet Joanna while John returned home to govern the kingdom. On May 25, Joanna and Afonso were betrothed and proclaimed sovereigns of Castile. In the same month, John&#x27;s wife, Eleanor, gave birth to the couple&#x27;s only child to survive infancy, Afonso.

In late 1475, Afonso, with only a fragment of his army remaining, wrote letters to John imploring him to provide reinforcements. John raised an army and left for Castile again in January 1476, appointing Eleanor regent of the kingdom.

In March 1476, at Toro, Afonso V and John and some 8,000 men faced Castilian forces of similar size led by Isabella&#x27;s husband, Ferdinand of Aragon, Cardinal Mendoza and the Duke of Alba. King Afonso V was beaten by the left and center of King Ferdinand&#x27;s army and fled from the battlefield. John defeated the Castilian right wing, recovered the lost Portuguese Royal standard, and held the field, but overall the battle was indecisive. Despite its uncertain outcome, the Battle of Toro represented a great political victory for Isabella and Ferdinand and Afonso&#x27;s prospects for obtaining the Castilian crown were severely damaged. John promptly returned to Portugal to disband the remnants of his army, arriving the first week of April.

===De facto rule===
Months after the Battle of Toro, in August 1476, Afonso V travelled to France hoping to obtain the assistance of King Louis XI in his fight against Castile. In September 1477, disheartened that his efforts to secure support had proved fruitless, Afonso abdicated the throne and embarked on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. He was eventually persuaded to return to Portugal, where he arrived in November 1477. John had been proclaimed king days prior to Afonso&#x27;s arrival, but relinquished his new title and insisted that his father reassume the crown.

From 1477 to 1481, John and Afonso V were &quot;practically corulers.&quot; John, given control of overseas policy in 1474 and concerned with consolidating Portuguese control of Africa, played a major role in negotiating the Treaty of Alcáçovas (1479) with Spain that concluded the War of the Castilian Succession and ensured Portugal hegemony in the Atlantic south of the Canary Islands. The treaty also arranged for the marriage of John&#x27;s son, Afonso, to the eldest daughter of the Catholic Monarchs, Isabella.

Following his father&#x27;s death on 28 August 1481, John was proclaimed King of Portugal and crowned at Sintra on 31 August.

==Reign==
===Consolidation of power===

 accession to the throne, John strived to diminish the power and influence of the nobility that had greatly accumulated during his father’s reign. In 1481, he assembled the Cortes in Evora and held a grand oath-taking ceremony in which magnates and other subjects were required to swear allegiance to him as their unequivocal superior. The ceremony was perceived as humiliating by members of the upper nobility who were accustomed to the feudal tradition of acknowledging the king as simply first among equals. At the Cortes, John further enraged nobles by declaring that property title deeds would undergo examination to ensure their validity, as opposed to being confirmed in mass. After representatives of commoners voiced grievances concerning abuses committed by the nobility and clergy, he deprived nobles of their right to administer justice on their estates, instead authorizing crown officials or corregedors to inspect and dispense justice throughout the realm.

Such aggressive assertions of royal supremacy roused resentment amongst the nobility. By 1482, Fernando, Duke of Braganza, the wealthiest nobleman in Portugal, and his followers had begun conspiring for John’s deposition, allegedly receiving support from the Catholic Monarchs. John responded by having Fernando arrested, tried and convicted of twenty-two counts of treason, and publicly beheaded in June 1483. Afterwards, the assets of the House of Braganza were confiscated and the family fled to Castile.

Braganza’s execution caused even more intrigue among the upper-nobility, who rallied behind Diogo, Duke of Viseu, John’s cousin and brother to his Queen Consort, Eleanor. In September 1484, John summoned Diogo to his private chambers, confronted him with evidence of treason, and stabbed him to death. Other ringleaders involved in the plot were persecuted. Ultimately, John succeeded in enriching the Crown by executing or exiling most of Portugal’s feudal lords and confiscating their estates. For the rest of his reign, he kept the creation of titles to a bare minimum.

===Economy and administration===
Under John&#x27;s direction, commercial activity in Africa became a crown monopoly. The immense profits generated by African ventures enabled the king to fund exploration expeditions, reduce his reliance on the cortes for financial support, and strengthen the monarchy&#x27;s power over the nobility.

John established a new court called the Mesa or Tribunal do Desembargo do Paco to supervise petitions for pardon, privileges, freedoms, and legislation. He also instituted annual elections for the judges, clerks, and hospital stewards under federal jurisdiction. His attempts to centralize hospitals across Portugal were not implemented fully but paved the way for the radical reforms introduced during the reign of Manuel I.

===Exploration===
John II famously restored the policies of Atlantic exploration, reviving and broadening the work of his great-uncle, Henry the Navigator. The Portuguese explorations were his main priority in government, patronising both local and foreign men, such as João Afonso de Aveiro and Martin Behaim, to further his goals. Portuguese explorers pushed south along the known coast of Africa with the purpose of discovering the maritime route to India and breaking into the spice trade. During John II&#x27;s reign, the following achievements were realised:
* 1482 – Foundation of the coastal fortress and trade post of São Jorge da Mina.
* 1484 – Discovery of the Congo River by Diogo Cão.
* 1488 – Discovery and passage of the Cape of Good Hope by Bartolomeu Dias in Mossel Bay.
* 1493 – Start of the settlement of the São Tomé and Príncipe islands by Álvaro Caminha.
* Funding of land expeditions by Afonso de Paiva and Pêro da Covilhã to India and Ethiopia in search of the kingdom of Prester John.

In 1484, John appointed a Maritime Advisory Committee, the &quot;Junta dos Mathematicos&quot;, to supervise navigational efforts and provide explorers with charts and instruments. 
Around the same time, Christopher Columbus proposed his planned voyage to John. The king relegated Columbus&#x27;s proposal to the Committee, who rejected it, correctly, on the grounds that Columbus&#x27;s estimate for a voyage of 2,400 nmi was only a quarter of what it should have been. In 1488, Columbus again appealed to the court of Portugal, and John II again granted him an audience. That meeting also proved unsuccessful, in part because not long afterwards Bartolomeu Dias returned to Portugal with news of his successful rounding of the southern tip of Africa (near the Cape of Good Hope). Columbus then sought an audience with the Catholic Monarchs and eventually secured their support.

====Conflict with Castile====

While returning home from his first voyage early in 1493, Columbus was driven by storm into the port of Lisbon. John II welcomed him warmly but asserted that under the Treaty of Alcáçovas previously signed with Spain, Columbus&#x27;s discoveries lay within Portugal&#x27;s sphere of influence. The king then prepared a fleet under Francisco de Almeida to claim the new islands. Anxious to avoid war, the Catholic Monarchs arranged negotiations in the small Spanish town of Tordesillas. The result of this meeting would be the famous Treaty of Tordesillas, which sought to divide all newly discovered lands in the New World between Spain and Portugal.

===Religious policy===
John sanctioned several anti-Jewish laws at the behest of parliamentary representatives, including restrictions on Jewish clothing and the emancipation of Christian converts owned by Jews. However, the king’s personal attitude towards Portuguese Jews has been described as pragmatic, as he valued their economic contributions and defended them against unjust harassment.

After the Catholic Monarchs expelled Jews from Castile and Aragon in 1492, John authorized the admission of tens of thousands of Jews into Portugal at the price of eight cruzados a head but refused to let them stay longer than eight months. Of the some 20,000 families that entered Portugal, only 600 of the most affluent Castilian Jewish families succeeded in obtaining permanent residence permits. Jews unable to leave the country within the specified interval (often the result of poverty) were reduced to slavery and were not liberated until the reign of John’s successor, Manuel. Many children of the enslaved Castilian Jews were seized from their parents and deported to the African island of São Tomé in order to be raised there as Christians and serve as colonists.

===Succession and death===
In July 1491, John&#x27;s only legitimate child, Prince Afonso, died in a horse accident, confronting Portugal with a succession crisis. The king wanted his illegitimate son Jorge to succeed him but Queen Eleanor was intent on securing succession for her younger brother Manuel, the legal heir presumptive. Following bitter disputes with Eleanor and a failed petition to Rome to have Jorge legitimized, John finally recognized Manuel as his heir in his will while on his deathbed in September 1495.

John died of dropsy at Alvor on 25 October 1495 and was succeeded by Manuel I. He was initially interred at the Silves Cathedral, but his remains were transferred to the Monastery of Batalha in 1499.

==Legacy==
The nickname &quot;the Perfect Prince&quot; is a posthumous appellation that is intended to refer to Niccolò Machiavelli&#x27;s work &quot;The Prince&quot;. John II is considered to have lived his life exactly according to the writer&#x27;s idea of a perfect prince. Nevertheless, he was admired as one of the greatest European monarchs of his time. Isabella I of Castile often referred to him as (The Man).

The Italian scholar Poliziano wrote a letter to John II that paid him a profound homage:

:to render you thanks on behalf of all who belong to this century, which now favours of your quasi-divine merits, now boldly competing with ancient centuries and all Antiquity.

Indeed, Poliziano considered his achievements to be more meritorious than those of Alexander the Great or Julius Caesar. He offered to write an epic work giving an account of John II accomplishments in navigation and conquests. The king replied in a positive manner in a letter of 23 October 1491, but delayed the commission.

==In popular culture==
* In the TV series &quot;Christopher Columbus&quot; (1985) he is played by Max von Sydow.
* In the film &quot;Christopher Columbus: The Discovery&quot; (1992) he is played by Mathieu Carrière.
* He appears in &quot;Civilization IV&quot; (as João II), leading the Portuguese.
* In the TV series &quot;Isabel&quot; played by Álvaro Monje

<text>Stéphane Grappelli (; 26 January 1908 – 1 December 1997) was a French jazz violinist. He is best known as a founder of the Quintette du Hot Club de France with guitarist Django Reinhardt in 1934. It was one of the first all-string jazz bands. He has been called &quot;the grandfather of jazz violinists&quot; and continued playing concerts around the world well into his eighties.

For the first three decades of his career, he was billed using a gallicised spelling of his last name, &quot;Grappelly&quot;, reverting to the Italian spelling &quot;Grappelli&quot; in 1969. The latter is used when referring to the violinist, including reissues of his early work.

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
Grappelli was born at Hôpital Lariboisière in Paris, France. His father, Italian Ernesto Grappelli, was born in Alatri, Lazio, while his French mother, Anna Emilie Hanoque, was from St-Omer. Ernesto was a scholar who taught Italian, sold translations, and wrote articles for local journals. Grappelli&#x27;s mother died when he was five, leaving his father to care for him. Although he was residing in France when World War I began, Ernesto was still an Italian citizen, and was consequently drafted into the Italian Army in 1914.

Having written about American dancer Isadora Duncan, who was living in Paris, Ernesto appealed to her to care for his son. Stéphane was enrolled in Duncan&#x27;s dance school at the age of six, and he learned to love French Impressionist music. With the war approaching, Duncan fled the country; she turned over her château to be used as a military hospital. Ernesto subsequently entrusted his son to a Catholic orphanage. Grappelli said of this time:

Grappelli compared his early life to a Dickens novel, and said that he once tried to eat flies to ease his hunger. He stayed at the orphanage until his father returned from the war in 1918, settling them in an apartment in Barbès. Having been sickened by his experiences with the Italian military, Ernesto took Stéphane to city hall, pulled two witnesses off the street, and had his son naturalized as a French citizen on 28 July 1919. His first name Stefano was Gallicized to Stéphane. 

Grappelli began playing the violin at the age of 12 on a three-quarter-sized violin, which his father purchased by pawning a suit. Although Stéphane received violin lessons, he preferred to learn the instrument on his own:

After a brief period of independent learning, Grappelli was enrolled at the Conservatoire de Paris on 31 December 1920, which his father hoped would give him a chance to learn music theory, ear-training, and solfeggio. In 1923, Grappelli graduated with a second-tier medal. Around this time, his father married a woman named Anna Fuchs and moved to Strasbourg. Grappelli remained in Paris because he disliked Fuchs.

At the age of 15, Grappelli began busking full-time to support himself. His playing caught the attention of an elderly violinist, who invited him to accompany silent films in the pit orchestra at the Théâtre Gaumont. He played there for six hours daily over a two-year period. During orchestra breaks, he visited Le Boudon, a brasserie, where he would listen to songs from an American proto-jukebox. Here he was introduced to jazz. In 1928, Grappelli was a member of the orchestra at the Ambassador Hotel while bandleader Paul Whiteman and jazz violinist Joe Venuti were performing there. Jazz violinists were rare, and though Venuti played mainly commercial jazz themes and seldom improvised, Grappelli was struck by his bowing when he played &quot;Dinah&quot;. As a result, Grappelli began developing a jazz-influenced style of violin music.

Grappelli lived with Michel Warlop, a classically trained violinist. Warlop admired Grappelli&#x27;s jazz-inspired playing, while Grappelli envied Warlop&#x27;s income. After experimenting with the piano, Grappelli stopped playing the violin, choosing simplicity, a new sound, and paid performances over familiarity. He began playing piano in a big band led by a musician called Grégor. In 1929, after a night of drinking, Grégor learned that Grappelli used to play the violin. Grégor borrowed a violin and asked Grappelli to improvise over &quot;Dinah&quot;. Delighted by what he heard, Grégor urged Grappelli to return to playing the violin.

In 1930, Grégor ran into financial trouble. He was involved in an automobile accident that resulted in several deaths, and fled to South America to avoid arrest. Grégor&#x27;s band reunited as a jazz ensemble under the leadership of pianist Alain Romans and saxophonist André Ekyan. While playing with this band, Grappelli met gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt in 1931. Looking for a violinist interested in jazz, he invited Grappelli to play with him in his caravan. Although the two played for hours that afternoon, their commitments to their respective bands prevented them from pursuing a career together.

In 1934 they met again at Claridge&#x27;s in London, England, and began a musical partnership. Pierre Nourry, the secretary of the Hot Club de France, invited Reinhardt and Grappelli to form the Quintette du Hot Club de France, with Louis Vola on bass and Joseph Reinhardt and Roger Chaput on guitar.

Also located in the Montmartre district was the artistic salon of R-26, at which Grappelli and Reinhardt performed regularly.

The Quintette du Hot Club de France disbanded in 1939 upon the outbreak of World War II; Grappelli was in London at the time, and stayed there for the duration of the war. In 1940, jazz pianist George Shearing made his debut as a sideman in Grappelli&#x27;s band.

=== Post-war ===

When the war was over, Reinhardt came to England for a reunion with Grappelli. They recorded some titles in London with the &quot;English Quintette&quot; during January and February 1946 for EMI and Decca, using a rhythm section consisting of English guitarists Jack Llewelyn and Alan Hodgkiss together with the Jamaican jazz bassist Coleridge Goode. Grappelli chose to remain in England, while Reinhardt returned to Paris before undertaking an only moderately successful visit to the United States, where he performed in a new style using an amplified archtop guitar with Duke Ellington&#x27;s orchestra. On Reinhardt&#x27;s return, he and Grappelli reunited periodically for concerts on occasions when the latter was visiting Paris; however, the pre-war Quintette was never re-formed. The pair also briefly toured Italy, where they were supported by an Italian rhythm section of piano, bass and drums; the tour was documented, with around 50 tracks recorded for an Italian radio station, about half of which can be heard on the album &quot;Djangology&quot; (released in 2005). This was to be the last set of recordings featuring the pair, with Reinhardt moving into a more bebop/modern jazz idiom and playing with younger French musicians prior to his early death in 1953, aged only 43.

Throughout the 1950s, Grappelli made occasional visits to the recording studio, but the opportunities for a swing violinist of his generation were becoming limited; despite attempts to modernise his style, Grappelli was never particularly interested in the bebop style which was then fashionable in the jazz world. He made a brief filmed appearance in Paul Paviot&#x27;s 1957 film &quot;Django Reinhardt&quot;, in which he plays &quot;Minor Swing&quot; alongside Joseph Reinhardt, Henri Crolla and others. In the 1960s, Grappelli made regular appearances on the BBC Light Programme, French Public Radio, and the pirate station Radio Luxembourg. In 1967, he returned to Paris to take up a regular engagement providing music for diners at the &quot;Le Toit de Paris&quot; restaurant in the Paris Hilton Hotel, a position he kept up until 1972, for it provided regular work plus accommodation at the hotel. He played in a standard &quot;lounge jazz&quot; format, accompanied by a pianist and drummer. Grappelli was making a living, but by now had very little impact on the jazz world.

In 1971, British chat-show host Michael Parkinson, a longtime jazz fan, came up with the idea of including Grappelli on his show &quot;Parkinson&quot;, where he would be joined by the classical violinist Yehudi Menuhin, with the two musicians performing a duet. Although Menuhin had no jazz training and a distinctly classical style of playing, the result went down very well with the British public. The pair went on to record three collaborative albums between 1972 and 1976, with Menuhin playing parts written out by Grappelli while the latter improvised in a classic jazz fashion. During their appearance on Parkinson&#x27;s show, Menuhin played his prized Stradivari dating from 1714, while Grappelli revealed his instrument was made by Goffredo Cappa in 1695.

In 1973, British guitarist Diz Disley had the idea of prising Grappelli away from his &quot;lounge jazz&quot; format with piano players to play once again with the backing of acoustic guitars and double bass, re-creating a version of the &quot;Hot Club&quot; sound, but now with Grappelli as sole leader. Grappelli&#x27;s reservations about returning to this format were dissipated following a rapturous reception for the &quot;new&quot; (old) format group at that year&#x27;s Cambridge Folk Festival, after which he favoured the guitar-based trio (with double bass) for a series of increasingly successful concert tours around the globe. These tours would virtually occupy the remainder of Grappelli&#x27;s life; away from the touring circuit, however, he also favoured numerous other instrumental combinations on record. Other guitarists in the British &quot;Diz Disley Trio&quot; providing his instrumental backing over the years included Denny Wright, Ike Isaacs, the Irish guitarist Louis Stewart, John Etheridge and Martin Taylor, while double bass was often provided by Dutchman Jack Sewing; in his later years, Grappelli also used a Parisian trio which included guitarist Marc Fosset and bassist Patrice Caratini.

In April 1973, Grappelli performed with great success during a week at &quot;Jazz Power&quot; in Milan, accompanied by Italian jazz musicians as guitarist Franco Cerri, bassist/arranger Pino Presti and drummer Tullio De Piscopo.

Grappelli played on hundreds of recordings, including sessions with Duke Ellington, jazz pianists Oscar Peterson, Michel Petrucciani and Claude Bolling, jazz violinists Svend Asmussen, Jean-Luc Ponty, and Stuff Smith, Indian classical violinist L. Subramaniam, vibraphonist Gary Burton, pop singer Paul Simon, mandolin player David Grisman, classical violinist Yehudi Menuhin, orchestral conductor André Previn, guitar player Bucky Pizzarelli, guitar player Joe Pass, cello player Yo Yo Ma, harmonica and jazz guitar player Toots Thielemans, jazz guitarist Henri Crolla, bassist Jon Burr and fiddler Mark O&#x27;Connor.

Grappelli recorded a solo for the title track of Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;. This was made almost inaudible in the mix, and so the violinist was not credited, according to Roger Waters, as it would be &quot;a bit of an insult&quot;. A remastered version with Grappelli&#x27;s contribution fully audible can be found on the 2011 editions of &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;.

Grappelli composed the score for two French films: &quot;Going Places&quot; (Bertrand Blier, 1974) and &quot;May Fools&quot; (Louis Malle, 1990).

Grappelli made a cameo appearance in the 1978 film &quot;King of the Gypsies&quot; with mandolinist David Grisman. Three years later they performed in concert. He also made a 1975 cameo as a violinist in &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; season 2, episode 8. In the 1980s he gave several concerts with British cellist Julian Lloyd Webber. In 1997, Grappelli received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He is an inductee of the &quot;Down Beat&quot; Jazz Hall of Fame.

Grappelli continued touring up to the last year of his life; in 1997, although his health was by poor, he toured the United Kingdom in March and then played concerts in Australia and New Zealand, giving his last public performance in Christchurch, New Zealand, before returning to Paris via Hong Kong. He made his final recording, four tracks with the classical violinist Iwao Furusawa, plus guitarist Marc Fosset and bassist Philippe Viret, in Paris in August 1996 (released as &quot;As Time Goes By: Stéphane Grappelli and Iwao Furusawa&quot;).

== Personal life and legacy ==

In May 1935, Grappelli had a brief affair with Sylvia Caro that resulted in a daughter named Evelyne. Sylvia remained in Paris with her daughter for the duration of World War II. Father and daughter were reunited in 1946 when Evelyne travelled to London from France to stay with Grappelli for about a year. From 1952 to 1980, he shared much of his life with a female friend, Jean Barclay, for whom he felt a deep brotherly affection. Grappelli never married, however, and it is widely accepted that he was gay; in 1981 he met Joseph Oldenhove, who would be his companion until his death.

Grappelli died in Paris on 1 December 1997, suffering heart failure after a series of minor cerebral attacks. His funeral, on 5 December, took place at the Église Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Paris, within sight of the entrance to the Lariboisière Hospital where he had been born 89 years earlier. His body was cremated and his ashes entombed in the city&#x27;s Père Lachaise Cemetery.

He is the subject of the documentary &quot;Stéphane Grappelli – A Life in the Jazz Century&quot;.

<text>The Battle of Leipzig, also known as the Battle of the Nations, was fought from 16 to 19 October 1813 at Leipzig, Saxony. The Coalition armies of Austria, Prussia, Sweden, and Russia, led by Tsar Alexander I and Karl von Schwarzenberg, decisively defeated the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon&#x27;s army also contained Polish and Italian troops, as well as Germans from the Confederation of the Rhine (mainly Saxony and Württemberg). The battle was the culmination of the German Campaign of 1813 and involved 560,000 soldiers, 2,200 artillery pieces, the expenditure of 400,000 rounds of artillery ammunition, and 133,000 casualties, making it the largest battle of the Napoleonic Wars, and the largest battle in Europe prior to World War I.

Decisively defeated, Napoleon was compelled to return to France while the Sixth Coalition kept up its momentum, dissolving the Confederation of the Rhine and invading France early the next year. Napoleon was forced to abdicate and was exiled to Elba in May 1814.

==Background==
The French Emperor Napoleon I attempted to force Emperor Alexander I of Russia into rejoining his unpopular Continental System by invading Russia on 24 June 1812 with around 685,000 troops, and eventually entered Moscow in late 1812, following the bloody, yet indecisive Battle of Borodino. However, Alexander refused to surrender even as the French occupied the city, which was set on fire by the time of its occupation. The campaign ended in complete disaster as Napoleon and his remaining forces retreated during the bitter Russian winter, with sickness, starvation, and the constant harrying by Russian Cossacks and partisans, leaving the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; virtually destroyed by the time it returned from Russia. To make matters even worse for Napoleon, in June 1813, the combined armies of Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom, under the command of the Duke of Wellington, had decisively routed the French at the Battle of Vitoria in the Peninsular War, and were now advancing towards the Pyrenees and into France itself. With this string of defeats, the French armies were in retreat on all fronts across Europe.

Anti-French forces joined Russia as its troops pursued the remnants of the virtually destroyed &quot;Grande Armée&quot; across Central Europe. The allies regrouped as the Sixth Coalition, comprising Prussia, Russia, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, the United Kingdom, as well as smaller German states whose citizens and leaders were no longer loyal to the French emperor. Napoleon hurried back to France and managed to mobilize another large army, but severe economic hardship and news of defeats had led to war-weariness and growing unrest among France&#x27;s population.

Despite disastrous campaigns in Spain and Russia in 1812, France was still able to rebuild another massive army for Napoleon. Though this new army was large in numbers, it was mostly made up of raw and young French conscripts, many of whom had no desire to fight in Napoleon&#x27;s wars. Yet Napoleon, with this new massive army, had the intention of either inducing a temporary alliance or at least cessation of hostilities, or knocking at least one of the Great Powers (Prussia or Russia) out of the war and keeping Austria neutral. Napoleon sought to regain the offensive by re-establishing his hold in Germany, winning two hard-fought tactical victories, at Lützen on 2 May and Bautzen on 20–21 May.

These victories led to a brief armistice. During the armistice, the monarchs of Russia and Prussia met Crown Prince Charles John of Sweden at Trachenberg Castle in Silesia. Charles John, a former French Marshal of the Empire (previously known as Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte), outlined a strategy for defeating Napoleon that, with added details from the Austrians following their joining of the Coalition on 12 August 1813, became known as the Trachenberg Plan. In accordance with the Trachenberg Plan, three Coalition armies were formed, the Army of Silesia of 95,000 men under the command of Gebhard von Blücher, the Army of North Germany of 120,000 (including Swedish garrisons in Stralsund) under Crown Prince Charles John, and the Army of Bohemia, the primary allied army in the field with 225,000 men, under the command of Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg. A fourth army was constituted as the Army of Poland, initially 30,000 men, but expanding to 70,000 by year&#x27;s end, under the command of Count Benningsen. As outlined by the Trachenberg Plan, the Coalition armies would avoid battle with Napoleon, retreat whenever Napoleon himself advanced, and instead target the forces under the command of his marshals. Despite the injunction to avoid battle with the Emperor, the Army of Bohemia engaged Napoleon at the Battle of Dresden on 27 August where the French won a crushing victory.

However, close adherence to the Trachenberg Plan led to Coalition victories at Großbeeren, Kulm, Katzbach, and Dennewitz. Meanwhile, Charles John had begun a concerted propaganda campaign in Germany, drawing on his experience as Minister of War during the French Revolution, to stoke German nationalist feeling and calling on the kings of Bavaria and Saxony, whose armies he had commanded in 1805 and 1809, to repudiate their French alliances. His efforts met with success as the Saxon and Westphalian armies had begun exhibiting signs of mutiny throughout late August and September, with Saxon units defecting to the Coalition at Großbeeren and Dennewitz and Westphalian troops deserting in increasing numbers. Additionally, in early September the Bavarians proclaimed neutrality following Charles John&#x27;s victory over Ney at Dennewitz. After these defeats and defections the French emperor could not capitalize on his victory at Dresden. Thinly-stretched supply lines spanning into now somewhat hostile territory, coupled with Bavaria&#x27;s switching of sides against the French just eight days prior to Leipzig, made it almost impossible to replace his army&#x27;s losses of 150,000 men, 300 guns, and 50,000 sick.

==Prelude==
With the intention of knocking Prussia out of the war as soon as possible, Napoleon sent Marshal Nicolas Oudinot to take the Prussian capital of Berlin with an army of 60,000. Oudinot was defeated at the Battle of Großbeeren, by the Swedes and Prussians of the Army of the North, just south of the city. Another attempt was made at Berlin on 6 September 1813, this time with Ney in command of 58,000 troops. However, Ney&#x27;s command disintegrated following a catastrophic defeat at the hands of von Bülow and Charles John at the Battle of Dennewitz. With an intact Army of the North threatening from the direction of Berlin, and Blücher&#x27;s army moving toward the Elbe, Napoleon was compelled to withdraw westward. He crossed the Elbe with much of his army between late September and early October, and organized his forces around Leipzig, to protect his crucial supply lines and oppose the converging Coalition armies arrayed against him. He deployed his army around the city, but concentrated his force from Taucha through Stötteritz, where he placed his command. The Prussians advanced from Wartenburg, the Austrians and Russians from Dresden (which they had recently retaken, after the Battle of Kulm), and the Swedes from the north.

==Opposing forces==
The French had around 160,000 soldiers along with 700 guns plus 15,000 Poles, 10,000 Italians, and 40,000 Germans belonging to the Confederation of the Rhine, totalling 225,000 troops. The Coalition had around 380,000 troops along with 1,500 guns, consisting of 145,000 Russians, 115,000 Austrians, 90,000 Prussians, and 23,000–30,000 Swedes. This made Leipzig the largest battle of the Napoleonic wars, surpassing Borodino, Wagram, Jena and Auerstedt, Ulm, and Dresden.

The &quot;Grande Armée&quot;, under the command of Napoleon, was in a weakened state. The majority of his troops now consisted of teenagers and inexperienced men conscripted shortly after the near destruction of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; in Russia. Napoleon conscripted these men to be readied for an even larger campaign against the newly formed Sixth Coalition and its forces stationed in Germany. While he won several preliminary battles, his army was being steadily depleted as the Allies, closely following the Trachenberg Plan, systematically defeated his marshals with weaker corps, while exhausting Napoleon&#x27;s corps with chases across Germany. The French Imperial cavalry was similarly insufficient, making it difficult for Napoleon to keep his eyes on his lines of communications or even scout enemy positions, a fact which influenced the outcome of the Battle of Großbeeren and others during the German campaign.

The Coalition army was organized into four army-level commands: the Army of Bohemia under Karl von Schwarzenberg, the Army of Silesia under Blücher, the Army of Poland under Levin August von Bennigsen and the combined Prussian, Russian, and Swedish Army of the North under Crown Prince Charles XIV John. The Swedes also had under their command a company of the British Rocket Brigade armed with Congreve rockets, led by Captain Richard Bogue.

==Preparations==

===French plans===
Despite being outnumbered, Napoleon planned to take the offensive between the Pleiße and the Parthe rivers. The position at Leipzig held several advantages for his army and his battle strategy. The rivers that converged there split the surrounding terrain into four separate sectors. Holding Leipzig and its bridges, Napoleon could shift troops from one sector to another far more rapidly than the Allies could, who had difficulty moving such large numbers of troops into a single sector.

The northern front was defended by Marshals Michel Ney and Auguste de Marmont, and the eastern front by Marshal Jacques MacDonald. The artillery reserve and parks, ambulances, and baggage stood near Leipzig, which Napoleon made his supply base for the battle. The bridges on the Pleisse and White Elster rivers were defended by infantry and a few guns. The main battery stood in reserve, and during battle was to be deployed on the Gallows Height. This battery was to be commanded by the artillery expert Antoine Drouot. The western flank of the French positions at Wachau and Liebertwolkwitz was defended by Prince Józef Poniatowski and Marshal Pierre Augereau and his young French conscripts.

===Coalition plans===
The three monarchs of the Coalition powers were present in the field, with Emperor Alexander I of Russia at the head of the three alongside King Frederick William III of Prussia and Emperor Francis I of Austria. The Swedish regent and crown prince Charles John was also present. Alexander was the supreme commander of the Coalition forces in the eastern front of the war, while Prince Karl von Schwarzenberg of Austria was the commander-in-chief of all Coalition forces in the German theatre.

There was a drafting of the battle plan, with Marshals Prince Volkonsky of Russia, Johan Christopher Toll of Sweden and Karl Friedrich von dem Knesebeck of Prussia taking part in the planning. After the first plan was drafted, Schwarzenberg submitted it to the monarchs. However, Alexander complained about his incompetence in terms of battle planning upon seeing the plan for himself. Upon learning of Schwarzenberg&#x27;s main plan – to call for a secondary attack on the bridge between Leipzig and Lindenau to be led by Blücher and Gyulay, and a main attack astride the Pleiße River to be led by General Merveldt, Hessen-Homburg and the Prussian Guard, he insisted that this was a disastrous tactic as it would not permit the Coalition armies to outflank and encircle Napoleon&#x27;s army and destroy it. Alexander thought the plan would potentially allow Napoleon to break the Coalition battle line at one point and then concentrate his forces in the gap created and the weakened sectors. This would possibly give Napoleon a chance to regain the strategic initiative in Germany. Frederick William III attempted to opine to Alexander but could do nothing so he treated the discussion as if it was none of his concern. Later events in the battle proved the Russian emperor&#x27;s judgments correct. The action he had ordered Blücher to take met with great success north of Leipzig and the actions of the Russian Guard were decisive in halting the all-out French attack on Gulden Gossa in the south. On the other hand, the actions of the Austrians along the Pleiße River, part of Schwarzenberg&#x27;s initial plan, ended in failure.

However, not willing to plan the battle by himself as he had done during his disastrous defeat at Austerlitz almost a decade earlier, Alexander had Schwarzenberg draft another battle plan based on his thoughts and views. Schwarzenberg then drafted another plan that was largely designed to let everyone do as they pleased. The plan was as follows: Blücher&#x27;s axis of advance was to be shifted northward to the Halle road, the Russian and Prussian guards and the Russian heavy cavalry was to be amassed at Rotha in general reserve. The Austrian grenadiers and cuirassiers would advance between the rivers. This strategy would ensure the encirclement of the French army in Leipzig and its vicinity, or at least inflict heavy losses upon them to assure the needed decisive results. Seemingly, though somewhat reluctantly, convinced, Alexander soon agreed to his plan, and he then ordered him to tell the other commanders to follow the plan.

==Battle==

===16 October===
The French had gained slight victories at Lindenau and Wachau, and sustained a reverse at Möckern. The Allies had lost approximately 30,000 men, including 2,000 prisoners, the French about 25,000 in all. Despite the French advantage in terms of casualties, the first day ended in a draw. Moreover, the odds seemed to be shifting in the Allies&#x27; favor, for while Napoleon could only anticipate the arrival of Jean Reynier&#x27;s 14,000 men to raise his strength to barely 200,000 troops and 900 cannon, the Allies were awaiting the appearance of Charles John&#x27;s 70,000 men and a similar number under Bennigsen, and these reinforcements would bring their total strength to over 300,000 and 1,500 guns.

Looking back on the first day&#x27;s fighting, both sides made mistakes. Napoleon had underestimated Allied aggressiveness and miscalculated the position of Blücher and the Army of Silesia, and his men had suffered a sharp repulse at Möckern as a consequence. As for the Allies, the chaotic nature of their initial attack at Wachau, coupled with the flanking of waiting French forces, nearly led to catastrophe.

====Action at Dölitz====

The Austrian II Corps, commanded by Merveldt, advanced towards Connewitz via Gautzsch and attempted to attack the position. By the time Napoleon arrived on the battlefield along with the Young Guard and some Chasseurs, Merveldt found that the avenue of advance was well covered by the French battery and some skirmishers who had occupied the houses there and did not permit the Austrians to deploy their artillery in support of the attack. Merveldt himself in an unlucky turn was wounded and captured by the French after he went straight into the Saxon-Polish lines at the Pleiße River. Repulsed, the Austrians then moved to attack nearby Dölitz, down a road crossed by two bridges and leading to a manor house and a mill. Two companies of the 24th Regiment ousted the small Polish garrison and took the position. A prompt counterattack by the Saxons and Poles ejected the Austrian troops and the battle seesawed until the Austrians brought up a strong artillery battery and blew the Poles out of the position. The Poles suffered heavy casualties during their furious defense and set fire to both the manor and the mill during their retreat.

====Action at Markkleeberg====

General Kleist, moving along the Pleiße, attacked Poniatowski and Marshal Augereau in the village of Markkleeberg. The Austrians repaired a bridge and took a school building and manor. The French counterattacked, throwing the Austrians out of the school and back over the river. French attacks on the manor only resulted in mounting casualties for the French and Poles. The Russian 14th Division began a series of flanking attacks that forced the Poles out of Markkleeberg. Poniatowski stopped the retreat and the advancing Russians. Catching four battalions of the Prussian 12th Brigade in the open, Poniatowski directed attacks by artillery and cavalry until they were relieved by Russian hussars. Poniatowski retook Markkleeberg, but was thrown out by two Prussian battalions. Austrian grenadiers then formed in front of Markkleeberg and drove the Poles and French out of the area with a flank attack.

====Action at Wachau====
The Russian II Corps attacked Wachau near Leipzig with support from the Prussian 9th Brigade. The Russians advanced, unaware that French forces were waiting. The French took them by surprise on the flank, mauling them. The Prussians entered Wachau, engaging in street-to-street fighting. French artillery blasted the Prussians out of Wachau and the French recovered the village.

====Action at Liebertwolkwitz====

Liebertwolkwitz was a large village in a commanding position, defended by Marshal MacDonald and General Lauriston with about 18,000 men. General von Klenau&#x27;s Austrian IV Corps attacked with 24,500 men backed up by Pirch&#x27;s 10th Brigade (4,550) and Zieten&#x27;s 11th Brigade (5,365). The Austrians attacked first, driving the French out of Liebertwolkwitz after hard fighting, only to be driven out in turn by a French counterattack. Russo-Prussian General Württemberg was notable for his extreme bravery directing his troops under fire. At this point, Napoleon ordered General Drouot to form a grand battery of 150 guns on Gallows hill. This was done and the guns blasted the exposed Russian II Corps, forcing the Prussian battalions supporting it to take cover.

The hole had now been opened as Napoleon wished and at this point, Marshal Murat was unleashed with 10,000 French, Italian, and Saxon cavalry. However, Murat&#x27;s choice of massive columns for the attack formation was unfortunate for the French force, as smaller mobile formations of Russian, Prussian, and Austrian cavalry were able to successfully harass Murat&#x27;s division, driving them back to their own artillery, where they were saved by the French Guard Dragoons. The Young Guard was sent in to drive out the allies and give Napoleon his breakthrough. They recaptured both Liebertwolkwitz and Wachau, but the allies countered with Russian Guard and Austrian grenadiers backed by Russian cuirassiers. The units lived up to their elite reputation, forming squares that blasted the French cavalrymen from their horses and overran the French artillery batteries. On the southern front, although Napoleon gained ground, he could not break the Allied lines.

====Northern attack====
The northern front opened with the attack by General Langeron&#x27;s Russian corps on the villages of Groß-Wiederitzsch and Klein-Wiederitzsch in the centre of the French northern lines. This position was defended by General Dąbrowski&#x27;s Polish division of four infantry battalions and two cavalry battalions. At first sign of the attack, the Polish division attacked. The battle wavered back and forth with attacks and counterattacks. General Langeron rallied his forces and finally took both villages with heavy casualties.

====Action at Möckern====

The northern front was dominated by the Battle of Möckern. This was a four phase battle and saw hard fighting from both sides. A manor, palace, walled gardens, and low walls dominated the village. Each position was turned into a fortress with the walls being loopholed for covered fire by the French. The ground to the west of the position was too wooded and swampy for emplacement of artillery. A dike ran east along the Elster River being four metres high. Marshal Marmont brought up infantry columns behind the positions in reserve and for a quick counter-attack against any fallen position. Blücher commanded Langeron&#x27;s Russian and Yorck&#x27;s Prussian corps against Marmont&#x27;s VI Corps. When the battle hung in the balance, Marmont ordered a cavalry charge, but his commander refused to attack. Later, an attack by Prussian hussars caused serious losses to the French defenders. The battle lasted well into the night. Artillery caused the majority of the 9,000 Allied and 7,000 French casualties, and the French lost another 2,000 prisoners.

====Action at Lindenau====
In the western front, the Austrian III Corps under General Gyulay attacked the suburb of Lindenau and had success at first, forcing Marshal Ney to divert General Bertrand&#x27;s IV Corps to hold the position. But soon the French held, the fighting later ground down into a stalemate, and the Austrians were driven back not far from the village. However, for the French, there was also a negative strategic consequence for this minor success. IV Corps was needed by Napoleon for his attacks on the main Austro-Russian armies positioned at the south, and since they did not take part in the attack as they were that time engaging the Austrians in Lindenau, his attack failed.

===17 October===
There were only two actions on 17 October, one an attack by Russian General Sacken on General Dąbrowski&#x27;s Polish division at the village of Gohlis. In the end, the numbers and determination of the Russians prevailed and the Poles retreated to Pfaffendorf. Blücher, who was made a field marshal the day before, ordered General Lanskoi&#x27;s Russian 2nd Hussar Division to attack General Arrighi&#x27;s III Cavalry Corps. As they had the day before, the Allied cavalry proved to be superior, driving the French away with great losses.

====Arrival of reinforcements====
The French received only 14,000 troops as reinforcements. On the other hand, the Allies were strengthened by the arrival of 145,000 troops divided into two armies, one commanded by Bennigsen from the Army of Bohemia&#x27;s first line and the other, the Army of the North which consisted mainly of Swedish troops, commanded by Charles John.

===18 October===

====Napoleon&#x27;s attempt to sue for an armistice====
It was soon evident that the Allies would encircle Napoleon and his army, and he knew that not retreating from the battle would mean capitulation for his entire army, which by this time were starting to run out of supplies and ammunition. So Napoleon began to examine whether the roads and bridges of Lindenau could be used to withdraw his troops, or at the very least to secure a bridgehead crossing on the Pleiße River. However, he was not yet in the mood for withdrawing as he thought to achieve one more great victory for France. He also thought that a strong, formidable rear guard in Leipzig itself could repulse any Allied assault, which could buy him and his forces more time to withdraw from the battle.

During this time, Napoleon sent Merveldt, who had been captured two days earlier, back to the Allies on parole. Merveldt was given a letter to Alexander I, Francis I, and Frederick William III in which Napoleon offered to surrender to the Allies the fortresses he held along the Oder and Vistula, on the condition that the Allies allow him to withdraw to a position behind the Saale. He added that, if approved, they should sign an armistice and undertake peace negotiations. However, all three monarchs declined the offer.

====Coalition armies encircle Napoleon====

The Allies launched a huge assault from all sides, this time completely encircling Napoleon&#x27;s army. In over nine hours of fighting, in which both sides suffered heavy casualties, the French troops were slowly forced back towards Leipzig. The Allies had Blücher and Charles John to the north, Barclay de Tolly and Bennigsen, and Prince von Hesse-Homburg to the south, as well as Gyulay to the west.

====Actions at Wachau, Lössnig (Lößnig), and Dölitz====
The Prussian 9th Brigade occupied the abandoned village of Wachau while the Austrians, with General Bianchi&#x27;s Hungarians, threw the French out of Lößnig. The Austrians proceeded to give a demonstration of combined arms cooperation as Austrian cavalry attacked French infantry to give the Austrian infantry time to arrive and deploy in the attack on Dölitz, but the Young Guard threw them out. At this point, three Austrian grenadier battalions began to contest for the village with artillery support.

====Action at Probstheida====

The bloodiest fighting of the battle occurred in Probstheida, a village just southeast of Leipzig. Here, about 60,000 soldiers under Barclay were marching and advancing towards the village in two columns, one under von Kleist advancing through Wachau, and one under General Wittgenstein advancing through Liebertwolkwitz. Barclay was pressured by the monarchs, especially Alexander I, to take the village since it was the key to the positions of Napoleon&#x27;s troops, and although von Kleist opposed this, the monarchs&#x27; orders were paramount, so Barclay had to follow their orders anyway.

The French dispositions at the village, however, were heavily fortified, thanks to the high and thick garden walls that gave excellent protection for the French infantry. The defense was also strengthened with artillery and strong infantry reserves behind the village. A day earlier, the Russians had taken most of the losses incurred during the battle, so it was the Prussians who took the initiative.

Prussian jägers attempted to enter the village by storm but were quickly driven back. Then the artillery of both sides opened fire upon the village; despite the enormous amount of artillery that the Allies had brought with them, the more powerful French Imperial Guard artillery gradually gained the upper hand. The Prussians conducted a series of attacks against the French positions at the village, but because the French artillery repulsed each attack, their efforts were in vain. French cuirassiers, under Murat, charged upon the weakened Prussian lines and drove them back. Counter-charges by the numerous Russian cavalry saved the infantry by repeatedly driving back the French cavalry, albeit with heavy losses. The Prussians again conducted a charge upon French lines, but this charge was less successful than the first one. The third assault was now conducted, this time, by the Russians, commanded by General Raevsky, the hero of Borodino who had arrived a few days earlier from Russia after a delay due to sickness. The assault on the village was somewhat more successful than the first two, taking the gardens and destroying several French infantry units, but it was eventually driven back by the French Imperial Guard, who had just arrived at the scene. Despite Schwarzenberg&#x27;s request that Alexander send the Russian Imperial Guard, the Russian emperor ordered that more assaults were to be undertaken against the village. However, despite their successful, stubborn defense, the French were now in dire straits as they were dangerously short of manpower, and thus the fighting became only a hollow tactical victory for them.

====Actions at Paunsdorf and Schönefeld====
During that morning, Charles John and Blücher held a conference in Breitenfeld. It was agreed that Charles John&#x27;s Army of the North would pass the Parthe River at Taucha with a reinforcement of 30,000 men drawn from Blücher&#x27;s Army of Silesia. Blücher agreed to dispatch Langeron&#x27;s army corps, and to renounce his rank and his rights as army commander, putting himself at the head of his Prussians. The advance of the Army of the North towards Leipzig had been slow, purportedly because Charles John had received word that Napoleon planned a renewed attack towards Berlin after his marshals&#x27; failure to take the city in the battles of Großbeeren and Dennewitz.
General Platov&#x27;s Russian heavy artillery began to fire on the Saxons around Paunsdorf. Langeron placed pontoon bridges over the Parthe River and a flying bridge via Mockau. Large masses of troops had now moved to the east bank of the river. Meanwhile, Russian and Austrian forces began attacking French and Saxon positions in Paunsdorf, but after counterattacks by French infantry and deadly canister shots from Franco-Saxon batteries, were driven back. After their withdrawal, the Allied troops were pursued by French infantry before being counterattacked by Austrian hussar cavalry, in turn driving the French back. The town itself was still held by five Franco-Saxon battalions. Captain Bogue of the British Rocket Brigade, advanced with his unit and began firing Congreve rockets into the town, causing the defenders to fall back in disorder. Bogue, seizing the moment, charged at the head of his escort squadron of cavalry. This small force was in turn being driven out of Paunsdorf, but a barrage of rockets fired in close support again caused the French troops to break ranks.
The French fell back to Sellerhausen pursued by two Prussian battalions, while the Rocket Brigade formed on the left of a Russian battery and began firing on the retreating columns, causing near-panic. At this time, Captain Bogue was shot in the head and killed by a skirmisher. Shortly after, the reserve French Young and Old Guard drove the Allies out of Paunsdorf again, but eventually Ney judged the position untenable and ordered a withdrawal.

More heavy fighting occurred in Schönefeld. Allied troops repeatedly assaulted French positions there, but were forced back. French infantry attacks on Allied positions produced similar results. Repeated assaults by Russian musketeers and grenadiers under Langeron finally drove the French out of Schönefeld. The heavy fighting in Paunsdorf and Schönefeld set both villages on fire.

====Sweden fully participates====

In the meantime, at the behest of his officers, who felt embarrassed that they had not participated in the battle, Charles John gave the order for his light infantry to participate in the final assault on Leipzig itself. The Swedish jägers performed very well, losing only 35 men dead and 173 wounded while capturing 647 French prisoners.

====Action at Lindenau====
On the western front, the French IV Corps under Bertrand finally drove the Austrian III Corps under Gyulay away from Lindenau. This broke the encirclement which the Allied forces earlier had made against the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;, clearing the way for its retreat which would take place later the next day.

====Pro-Napoleonic Germans defect to the Coalition====
During the fighting, 5,400 Saxons of General Reynier&#x27;s VII Corps defected to the Coalition, specifically Charles John&#x27;s Army of the North due to the esteem the Saxons had for the former French marshal. Four years prior, Charles John, while still a Marshal of the French Empire, had commanded the wholly Saxon IX Corps during the Battle of Wagram where his mild and courteous behavior toward them in the weeks prior, along with a controversial Order of the Day praising their courage after the battle, greatly endeared Charles John to them. At first, French officers saw the Saxons&#x27; rushing towards the advancing Prussians as a charge, but treachery became evident as they saw the Saxons asking the Prussians to join with them for the impending assault. Reynier himself witnessed this, and he rallied the remaining Saxons at his disposal, but to no avail, because Württemberg&#x27;s cavalry also deserted from the French, forcing the French line in Paunsdorf to fall back.

====The &quot;Grande Armée&quot; begins to retreat====
The battle during the day of 18 October was one of attrition. French troops held on to their respective positions, but were steadily being worn out and depleted by fierce and intensifying Allied attacks throughout the day. The French artillery had only 20,000 rounds left. Later that night, Napoleon was treating the battle as a lost cause. At this time, he promoted Poniatowski to the rank of &quot;Maréchal d&#x27;Empire&quot;, the only foreigner of all his marshals who was given this title, and the latter swore that he would fight to the last stand, which he did. After this, the emperor began to stage the retreat for the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; westward across the White Elster River.

During the night the French army had been ordered to withdraw silently from Connewitz, Probstheida, Stotteritz, Volkmansdorf, and Reudnitz, all to cross the river via Leipzig and the single bridge in the river. Those in Lindenau were to move to Weissenfels. Weak rear guards occupied the villages in order to conceal the retreat, and support troops were placed in the outer suburbs by the wind mills and near the walls of the city. The garden and cemetery walls by the Grimma Gate were pierced with loopholes as well as the gates themselves. Skirmishers were posted in the farm houses, in the brush, in the parks, and everywhere possible. Leipzig was to be occupied by Reynier&#x27;s VII Corps, Poniatowski&#x27;s VIII Corps and MacDonald&#x27;s XI Corps. They were ordered to hold it for a day or a bit longer, in order to allow the rest of the army, its artillery, and its equipment sufficient time to evacuate. The Allied cavalry advance posts were ordered to attack without relief the French advanced posts during the night to determine whether or not the French were attempting to withdraw. However, they failed to realize that the French were, in fact, pulling out from the battle area. Therefore, the evacuation continued throughout the night.

===19 October===

The Allies had only learned of the French evacuation at 7:00 on the morning of the 19 October. Soon thereafter between 8:00–9:00 am they launched a full-scale assault from the north, south, and east against the retreating French. But they were held up in Leipzig because of a ferocious street-to-street rearguard action fought by Marshal Oudinot&#x27;s 30,000 troops. As the Russians and Prussians entered the city through the Halle and Grimma gates they fell upon barricades and houses full of French soldiers. Civilians were forced into hiding as the bloody urban combat raged throughout the city.

Napoleon&#x27;s disorganized retreat, where he failed to order the building of more bridges for the French retreat, continued until early afternoon when General Dulauloy, tasked with destroying the only bridge over the Elster, delegated the task to Colonel Montfort. The colonel then passed this responsibility to a corporal, who was unaware of the carefully planned time schedule. The corporal ignited the fuses at 1:00 in the afternoon while the bridge was still crowded with retreating French troops and Oudinot&#x27;s rearguard was still in Leipzig. The explosion and subsequent panic caused a rout that resulted in the deaths of thousands of French troops and the capture of 30,000 others. Both Oudinot and MacDonald managed to swim their way across but Poniatowski, hampered by his wounds, was one of the many who drowned while attempting to cross the river.

==Conclusion==

By the end of the battle on the afternoon of 19 October, the remnants of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; had crossed the Elster River and begun a well-ordered retreat. The battle had ended conclusively and decisively with the nations of the Coalition as the victors, and the German Campaign was a complete failure for the French, although they achieved a minor victory when the Bavarian Army attempted to block the retreat of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; at Hanau. The heavy casualties the Coalition armies had incurred and their exhaustion from the bloody 4-day battle they fought made it impossible for them to promptly pursue the retreating &quot;Grande Armée&quot;. The French were also exhausted after the battle, and were themselves retreating at a fast pace towards the Rhine.

==Casualties==
The Battle of Leipzig was the bloodiest of the Napoleonic Wars, with over 400,000 rounds of artillery ammunition having been expended. Casualties on both sides were astoundingly high, such that locals had difficulty disposing of the corpses, with some still visible the following year. Estimates range from 80,000 to 110,000 total killed, wounded, or missing.

Napoleon lost about 38,000 killed and wounded. The Allies captured 15,000 able-bodied Frenchmen, 21,000 wounded or sick, 325 guns, 28 eagles, standards, or colours, and most of the French supply trains. Six French generals were killed, 12 wounded, and 36 captured including Lauriston and Reynier.

Out of a total force of 360,000, the Allies suffered approximately 54,000 casualties. Schwarzenberg&#x27;s Army of Bohemia lost 34,000, Blücher&#x27;s Army of Silesia lost 12,000, while Charles John&#x27;s Army of the North and Bennigsen&#x27;s Army of Poland lost about 4,000 each.

==Aftermath==
The battle ended the French Empire&#x27;s presence east of the Rhine and brought secondary German states (e.g. Baden, Saxony, and Württemberg) over to the Coalition with the largest German states of Austria and Prussia. It also dealt a harsh blow to Napoleon himself, who had a second French army destroyed in as many years, and was decisively defeated in battle again, repeating such defeats as the one suffered in 1809 at the Battle of Aspern-Essling, severely damaging his reputation of invincibility. Alexander I now urged all of his subordinate commanders including those of Austria, Prussia, and other nations to push the gigantic Coalition army on the offensive after the battle, and, having decisively won the battle, was more than ever determined to carry the war onto French soil.

Three weeks after Leipzig, having won the Battle of Hanau, Napoleon arrived at Saint-Cloud to organize the defense of France. When he went back to Paris at the year&#x27;s end, his first words on entering the Senate, after his return from the battle disaster, sad and low in mood, were, &quot;A year ago all Europe marched with us; today all Europe marches against us.&quot; Half a million troops had been lost in the German Campaign of 1813.

With the Confederation of the Rhine dissolved and Prussia once again becoming one of the continent&#x27;s great powers after its severe setbacks in 1806, the Coalition armies pressed the advantage and invaded France in early 1814. Napoleon engaged some of their units during his counter-offensive campaign. After Paris fell to the Coalition on 31 March, he abdicated on 6 April. Forced into exile on the island of Elba Napoleon arrived there on 30 May.

==Legacy==
The Monument to the Battle of the Nations (&quot;&quot;) was completed in 1913 according to a design by Bruno Schmitz at a cost of six million German gold marks. The Russian Memorial Church was also dedicated to coincide with the hundredth anniversary of the battle and honored the Russian troops who fought in the battle. The course of the battle in the city of Leipzig is marked by numerous monuments and the 50 Apel-stones that mark important lines of the French and Allied troops.

The 1913 Centennial Exhibition was held in Breslau, for which was built an extensive venue centered around the Centennial Hall. It was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006.

<text>Sir Arnold Edward Trevor Bax (8 November 1883 – 3 October 1953) was an English composer, poet, and author. His prolific output includes songs, choral music, chamber pieces, and solo piano works, but he is best known for his orchestral music. In addition to a series of symphonic poems, he wrote seven symphonies and was for a time widely regarded as the leading British symphonist.

Bax was born in the London suburb of Streatham to a prosperous family. He was encouraged by his parents to pursue a career in music, and his private income enabled him to follow his own path as a composer without regard for fashion or orthodoxy. Consequently, he came to be regarded in musical circles as an important but isolated figure. While still a student at the Royal Academy of Music Bax became fascinated with Ireland and Celtic culture, which became a strong influence on his early development. In the years before the First World War he lived in Ireland and became a member of Dublin literary circles, writing fiction and verse under the pseudonym Dermot O&#x27;Byrne. Later, he developed an affinity with Nordic culture, which for a time superseded his Celtic influences in the years after the First World War.

Between 1910 and 1920 Bax wrote a large amount of music, including the symphonic poem &quot;Tintagel&quot;, his best-known work. During this period he formed a lifelong association with the pianist Harriet Cohen – at first an affair, then a friendship, and always a close professional relationship. In the 1920s he began the series of seven symphonies which form the heart of his orchestral output. In 1942 Bax was appointed Master of the King&#x27;s Music, but composed little in that capacity. In his last years he found his music regarded as old-fashioned, and after his death it was generally neglected. From the 1960s onwards, mainly through a growing number of commercial recordings, his music was gradually rediscovered, although little of it is regularly heard in the concert hall.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Bax was born on 8 November 1883 in the London suburb of Streatham, Surrey, to a prosperous Victorian family. He was the eldest son of Alfred Ridley Bax (1844–1918) and his wife, Charlotte Ellen (1860–1940), daughter of Rev. William Knibb Lea, of Amoy, China. The couple&#x27;s youngest son, Clifford Lea Bax, became a playwright and essayist. Alfred Bax was a barrister of the Middle Temple, but having a private income he did not practise. In 1896 the family moved to a mansion in Hampstead. Bax later wrote that although it would have been good to be raised in the country, the large gardens of the family house were the next best thing. He was a musical child: &quot;I cannot remember the long-lost day when I was unable to play the piano – inaccurately&quot;.

After a preparatory school in Balham, Bax attended the Hampstead Conservatoire during the 1890s. The establishment was run – &quot;with considerable personal pomp&quot;, according to Bax – by Cecil Sharp, whose passion for English folk-song and folk-dance excited no response in his pupil. An enthusiasm for folk music was widespread among British composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including Parry, Stanford, Vaughan Williams and Holst; Sullivan and Elgar stood aloof, as did Bax, who later put into general circulation the saying, &quot;You should make a point of trying every experience once, excepting incest and folk-dancing.&quot;
In 1900 Bax moved on to the Royal Academy of Music, where he remained until 1905, studying composition with Frederick Corder and piano with Tobias Matthay. Corder was a devotee of the works of Wagner, whose music was Bax&#x27;s principal inspiration in his early years. He later observed, &quot;For a dozen years of my youth I wallowed in Wagner&#x27;s music to the almost total exclusion – until I became aware of Richard Strauss – of any other&quot;. Bax also discovered and privately studied the works of Debussy, whose music, like that of Strauss, was frowned on by the largely conservative faculty of the academy.

Although Bax won a Macfarren Scholarship for composition and other important prizes, and was known for his exceptional ability to read complex modern scores on sight, he attracted less recognition than his contemporaries Benjamin Dale and York Bowen. His keyboard technique was formidable, but he had no desire for a career as a soloist. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he had private means that made him free to pursue his musical career as he chose, without the necessity of earning an income. &quot;The Times&quot; considered that Bax&#x27;s independence and disinclination to heed his teachers ultimately damaged his art, because he did not develop the discipline to express his imagination to the greatest effect.

After leaving the Academy Bax visited Dresden, where he saw the original production of Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot;, and first heard the music of Mahler, which he found &quot;eccentric, long-winded, muddle-headed, and yet always interesting&quot;. Among the influences on the young Bax was the Irish poet W. B. Yeats; Bax&#x27;s brother Clifford introduced him to Yeats&#x27;s poetry and to Ireland. Influenced by Yeats&#x27;s &quot;The Wanderings of Oisin&quot;, Bax visited the west coast of Ireland in 1902, and found that &quot;in a moment the Celt within me stood revealed&quot;. His first composition to be performed – at an academy concert in 1902 – was an Irish dialect song called &quot;The Grand Match&quot;.

===Early career===

Musically, Bax veered away from the influence of Wagner and Strauss, and deliberately adopted what he conceived of as a Celtic idiom. In 1908 he began a cycle of tone poems called &quot;Eire&quot;, described by his biographer Lewis Foreman as the beginning of the composer&#x27;s truly mature style. The first of these pieces, &quot;Into the Twilight&quot;, was premiered by Thomas Beecham and the New Symphony Orchestra in April 1909, and the following year, at Elgar&#x27;s instigation, Henry Wood, commissioned the second in the cycle, &quot;In the Faëry Hills&quot;. The work received mixed notices. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;&#x27;s reviewer wrote, &quot;Mr Bax has happily suggested the appropriate atmosphere of mystery&quot;; &quot;The Observer&quot; found the piece &quot;very undeterminate and unsatisfying, but not difficult to follow&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; commented on the &quot;rather second-hand language&quot; at some points, derivative of Wagner and Debussy, although &quot;there is still a great deal which is wholly individual&quot;. &quot;The Musical Times&quot; praised &quot;a mystic glamour that could not fail to be felt by the listener&quot; although the coherence of the piece &quot;was not instantly discernible&quot;. A third work in the cycle, &quot;Roscatha&quot;, was not performed in the composer&#x27;s lifetime.

Bax&#x27;s private means enabled him to travel to the Russian Empire in 1910. He was in pursuit of Natalia Skarginska, a young Ukrainian whom he had met in London – one of several women with whom he fell in love over the years. The visit eventually proved a failure from the romantic point of view but musically enriched him. In Saint Petersburg he discovered and immediately loved ballet; he absorbed Russian musical influences that inspired material for the First Piano Sonata, the piano pieces, &quot;May Night in the Ukraine&quot; and &quot;Gopak&quot;, and the First Violin Sonata, dedicated to Skarginska. Foreman describes him in this period as &quot;a musical magpie, celebrating his latest discoveries in new compositions&quot;; Foreman adds that Bax&#x27;s own musical personality was strong enough for him to assimilate his influences and make them into his own. Russian music continued to influence him until the First World War. An unfinished ballet &quot;Tamara&quot;, &quot;a little-Russian fairy tale in action and dance&quot;, provided material the composer reused in post-war works.

Having given up his pursuit of Skarginska, Bax returned to England; in January 1911 he married the pianist Elsita Luisa Sobrino (b. 1885 or 1886), daughter of the teacher and pianist, Carlos Sobrino, and his wife, Luise, &quot;née&quot; Schmitz, a singer. Bax and his wife lived first in Chester Terrace, Regent&#x27;s Park, London, and then moved to Ireland, taking a house in Rathgar, a well-to-do suburb of Dublin. They had two children, Dermot (1912–1976) and Maeve Astrid (1913–1987). Bax became known in Dublin literary circles under the pseudonym &quot;Dermot O&#x27;Byrne&quot;; he mixed with the writer George William Russell and his associates, and published stories, verses and a play. Reviewing a selection of the prose and poetry reissued in 1980, Stephen Banfield found most of Bax&#x27;s earlier poems &quot;like his early music, over-written, cluttered with the secondhand lumber of early Yeats, though the weakness is one of loosely chosen language rather than complexity.&quot; Banfield had better things to say of the later poems, where Bax &quot;focuses matters, whether laconically and colloquially upon the grim futility of the 1916 Easter Uprising ... or pungently upon his recurrent disillusionment about love.&quot; Some of Bax&#x27;s writings as O&#x27;Byrne were regarded as subversively sympathetic to the Irish republican cause, and the government censor prohibited their publication.

===First World War===
At the beginning of the war Bax returned to England. A heart complaint, from which he suffered intermittently throughout his life, made him unfit for military service; he acted as a special constable for a period. At a time when fellow composers including Vaughan Williams, Arthur Bliss, George Butterworth and Ivor Gurney were serving overseas, Bax was able to produce a large body of music, finding, in Foreman&#x27;s phrase, &quot;his technical and artistic maturity&quot; in his early thirties. Among his better-known works from the period are the orchestral tone poems &quot;November Woods&quot; (1916) and &quot;Tintagel&quot; (1917–19).

During his time in Dublin, Bax had made many republican friends. The Easter rising in April 1916 and the subsequent execution of the ringleaders shocked him deeply. He expressed his feelings in some of his music such as the orchestral &quot;In Memoriam&quot; and the &quot;Elegiac Trio&quot; for flute, viola, and harp (1916), as well as in his poetry.

In addition to his Irish influences, Bax also drew on a Nordic tradition, being inspired by the Norwegian poet Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Icelandic sagas. Bax&#x27;s Symphonic Variations for Piano and Orchestra (1917) is seen by the musicologist Julian Herbage as the turning-point from the Celtic to the Nordic in Bax&#x27;s oeuvre; Herbage views it as a further indication of the shift that &quot;Winter Legends&quot;, composed thirteen years later, has a Nordic rather than a Celtic setting.

During the war Bax began an affair with the pianist Harriet Cohen, for whom he left his wife and children. Musically, she was his muse for the rest of his life; he wrote numerous pieces for her, and she was the dedicatee of eighteen of his works. He took a flat in Swiss Cottage, London, where he lived until the start of the Second World War. He sketched many of his mature works there, often taking them in short score to his favoured rural retreats, Glencolmcille in Ulster, Ireland, and then from 1928 onwards Morar in Scotland, to work on the full score at leisure.

===Inter-war years===
In a study of Bax in 1919 his friend and confidante, the critic Edwin Evans, commented on the waning of the Celtic influence in the composer&#x27;s music and the emergence of &quot;a more austere, abstract art&quot;. From the 1920s onwards Bax seldom turned to poetic legend for inspiration. In Foreman&#x27;s view, in the post-war years Bax was recognised for the first time as an important, though isolated, figure in British music. The many substantial works he wrote during the war years were heard in public, and he started writing symphonies. Few English composers had so far written symphonies that occupied a secure place in the repertoire, the best known being Elgar (A and E symphonies) and Vaughan Williams (&quot;Sea&quot;, &quot;London&quot; and &quot;Pastoral&quot; symphonies). During the 1920s and into the 1930s Bax was seen by many as the leading British symphonist.

Bax&#x27;s First Symphony was written in 1921–22, and when first given it was a great success, despite its ferocity of tone. The critics found the work dark and severe. &quot;The Daily News&quot; commented, &quot;It is full of arrogant, almost blatant, virility. Its prevailing tone colour is dark, very dark – thick clouds with only here and there a ray of sunlight.&quot; &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; suggested that if there was any humour in the piece, it was sardonic. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; noted the severity of the work, but declared it &quot;a truly great English symphony&quot;. The work was a box-office attraction at the Proms for several years after the premiere. In Foreman&#x27;s view, Bax was at his musical peak for a fairly short time, and his reputation was overtaken by those of Vaughan Williams and William Walton. The Third Symphony was completed in 1929 and, championed by Wood, remained for some time among the composer&#x27;s most popular works.

In the mid-1920s, while his affair with Cohen continued, Bax met the twenty-three-year-old Mary Gleaves, and for more than two decades he maintained relationships with both women. His affair with Cohen ripened into warm friendship and continuing musical partnership. Gleaves became his companion from the later 1920s until his death.

In the 1930s, Bax composed the last four of his seven symphonies. Other works from the decade include the popular &quot;Overture to a Picaresque Comedy&quot; (1930), several works for chamber groups, including a nonet (1930), a string quintet (1933), an octet for horn, piano, and strings (1934) and his third and last string quartet (1936). The Cello Concerto (1932) was commissioned by and dedicated to Gaspar Cassadó, who quickly dropped the work from his repertoire. Although Beatrice Harrison championed the concerto in the 1930s and 40s, Bax said, &quot;The fact that nobody has ever taken up this work has been one of the major disappointments of my musical life&quot;.

Bax was knighted in 1937; he had neither expected nor sought the honour, and was more surprised than delighted to receive it. As the decade progressed, he became less prolific; he commented that he wanted to &quot;retire, like a grocer&quot;. Among his compositions from the period was the Violin Concerto (1938). Although not written to commission, he had composed it with the violin virtuoso Jascha Heifetz in mind. Heifetz never played it, and it was premiered in 1942 by Eda Kersey with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Wood.

===1940s and 50s===
After the death of the Master of the King&#x27;s Music, Sir Walford Davies, in 1941, Bax was appointed to succeed him. The choice surprised many. Bax, despite his knighthood, was not an Establishment figure; he himself had expressed a disinclination to &quot;shuffle around in knee-breeches&quot;. In the opinion of &quot;The Times&quot; the appointment was not a good one: &quot;Bax was not cut out for official duties and found their performance irksome&quot;. Nonetheless, Bax wrote a handful of occasional pieces for royal events, including a march for the Coronation in 1953.
After the Second World War began, Bax moved to Sussex, taking up residence at the White Horse Hotel, Storrington, where he lived for the rest of his life. He abandoned composition and completed a book of memoirs about his early years, &quot;Farewell, My Youth&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; found it at times waspish, at times reticent, surprising in parts, and regrettably short. Later in the war Bax was persuaded to contribute incidental music for a short film, &quot;Malta G. C.&quot;; he subsequently wrote music for David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1948) and a second short film, &quot;Journey into History&quot; (1952). His other works from the period include the short &quot;Morning Song&quot; for piano and orchestra, and the Left-Hand Concertante (1949), both written for Cohen. Bax and the Poet Laureate, John Masefield, worked on a pageant, &quot;The Play of Saint George&quot; in 1947, but the project was not completed.

In his last years, Bax maintained a contented retirement for much of the time. Walton commented, &quot;an important cricket match at Lord&#x27;s would bring him hurrying up to town from his pub at Storrington with much greater excitement than a performance of one of his works&quot;. In 1950, after hearing his Third Symphony played at Bournemouth, he said, &quot;I ought perhaps to be thinking of an eighth&quot;, but by this time he had begun to drink quite heavily, which aged him rapidly and impaired his ability to concentrate on a large-scale composition. He wrote in 1952, &quot;I doubt whether I shall write anything else… I have said all I have to say and it is of no use to repeat myself.&quot; Celebrations were planned by the Hallé Orchestra and others to celebrate Bax&#x27;s seventieth birthday in November 1953. The celebrations became memorials: while visiting Cork in October 1953 Bax died suddenly of heart failure aged 69. He was interred in St. Finbarr&#x27;s Cemetery, Cork.

==Music==
Bax&#x27;s fellow composer Arthur Benjamin wrote that Bax was &quot;a fount of music&quot;, whose &quot;spontaneous and inexhaustible outpourings&quot;, unique among his contemporaries, were comparable to those of Schubert and Dvořák. Evans has suggested that Bax&#x27;s music paradoxically combines robustness and wistfulness, a view that later commentators including Herbage have endorsed. The early music is often instrumentally difficult or orchestrally and harmonically complex; from about 1913 onwards he moved towards a simpler, sparer style. The composer and musicologist Anthony Payne considered that Bax&#x27;s best works date from the period between 1910 and 1925: he instances &quot;The Garden of Fand&quot;,&quot; Tintagel&quot;, &quot;November Woods&quot;, the Second Piano Sonata, Viola Sonata, and first two symphonies. By the 1930s Bax&#x27;s music ceased to be regarded as new and difficult, and towards the end of that decade it was attracting less attention than before.

The conductor Vernon Handley, long associated with Bax&#x27;s music, commented that the composer&#x27;s influences include Rachmaninoff and Sibelius as well as Richard Strauss and Wagner: &quot;He was aware of jazz and many more composers on the European scene than we are now. That finds its way into a person&#x27;s psyche and personality and into his technique as a musician.&quot;

The critic Neville Cardus wrote of Bax&#x27;s music:
York Bowen thought it regrettable that Bax&#x27;s orchestral works frequently call for exceptionally large forces: &quot;When the score demands such luxuries as triple or quadruple woodwind, six horns, three or four trumpets, extra percussion and perhaps organ, it is undoubtedly throwing extra difficulties in the way of performance.&quot; The composer Eric Coates commented that Bax&#x27;s music appealed greatly to orchestral players: &quot;whichever instrument he wrote for, it was as if he played that instrument himself, so well did he seem to write for it&quot;.

===Symphonies===
While in Dresden in 1907 Bax began work on what he later called &quot;a colossal symphony which would have occupied quite an hour in performance, were such a cloud-cuckoo dream to become an actuality&quot;. He added &quot;Happily, it never has!&quot;, but he left a complete piano sketch, which was orchestrated in 2012–13 by Martin Yates, and recorded for the Dutton Vocalion label; it lasts for 77 minutes. The four-movement work, more conventional in structure than his completed symphonies, shows a strong Russian influence in its material.

Bax wrote his seven completed symphonies between 1921 and 1939. In a study of the seven, David Cox wrote in 1967 that they were &quot;often dismissed as amorphous by those who imagine that Bax consists only of Celtic mistiness and &#x27;atmosphere&#x27;. In fact they have considerable strength and frequent astringence; and formally the thematic material is presented with consistency and purpose.&quot; In Herbage&#x27;s view, the cycle can be seen to fall into two groups – the first three and the last three – with the Fourth Symphony as &quot;an extrovert interlude between these largely introspective works&quot;. Handley agreed that the first three could be grouped together; Foreman sees a Celtic influence in all three, with Bax&#x27;s emotions about the Easter rising and its aftermath discernible. The Fourth is generally regarded as a more optimistic work than its predecessors and successors. Handley calls it &quot;festive&quot;, but comments that its ideas developed into darker mood in the Fifth and Sixth. The Fifth is, for Herbage, &quot;the greatest &quot;tour-de-force&quot;&quot;; the Sixth stands out for its &quot;magnificent final movement&quot;, which the critic Peter J. Pirie said &quot;tears the earth up by its roots&quot;; and the Seventh, in the view of the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, has an elegiac tone, its simplicity far removed from the discursive and complex music of Bax&#x27;s earlier years.

===Concertante works===
Bax&#x27;s first work for solo instrument and orchestra was the 50-minute &quot;Symphonic Variations&quot; in E (1919), written for Harriet Cohen. &quot;The Times&quot; considered it &quot;like one of those deeds of recklessness which in the Army may be followed either by a Court-martial or a V.C. We incline to favour the Court-martial, and to award the V.C. to Miss Harriet Cohen for her part in the enterprise.&quot;

The Cello Concerto (1932) was Bax&#x27;s first attempt at a full-scale conventional concerto. It calls for a smaller orchestra than he customarily employed, with no trombones or tuba, and no percussion apart from timpani. Foreman points to many subtleties of scoring, but notes that it has never ranked high among the composer&#x27;s mature works. The Violin Concerto (1937–38) is, like the last symphony, in a more relaxed vein than most of Bax&#x27;s earlier music. Cardus singled it out as &quot;unusually fine&quot;, although Heifetz may have felt it not virtuosic enough. The composer described it as in the romantic tradition of Joachim Raff.

Among the minor concertante works is &quot;Variations on the Name Gabriel Fauré&quot; (1949) for harp and strings, in a style more neoclassical than most of Bax&#x27;s music. Bax&#x27;s last concertante piece was a short work for piano and orchestra (1947) written in his capacity as Master of the King&#x27;s Music, marking Princess Elizabeth&#x27;s twenty-first birthday.

===Other orchestral works===

Bax&#x27;s tone poems are in a variety of styles and have varied sharply in their popularity. His impressionistic tone poem &quot;In the Faëry Hills&quot; is described by &quot;Grove&quot; as &quot;a succinct and attractive piece&quot;. It was modestly successful, but &quot;Spring Fire&quot; (1913) is instanced by Foreman as a difficult work; it was not performed in Bax&#x27;s lifetime. During the First World War Bax wrote three tone poems, two of which – &quot;The Garden of Fand&quot; (1913–16) and &quot;November Woods&quot; (1917) – have remained on the fringes of the modern repertoire, and a third – &quot;Tintagel&quot; (1917–19) – which in the decade after his death was the only work by which Bax was known to the public. &quot;Grove&quot; characterises all three as musical evocations of nature, with little expression of subjective personal response. The orchestral piece that was neglected longest was &quot;In memoriam&quot; (1917), a lament for Patrick Pearse, who was shot for his part in the Easter rising; the work was not played until 1998. Bax reused the main melody for his incidental music to &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1948).

&quot;Oliver Twist&quot; was the second of Bax&#x27;s film scores. The first was for a short wartime propaganda film, &quot;Malta, G. C.&quot;. A four-movement suite was published after the release of the latter, containing what &quot;The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music&quot; calls &quot;a notable March with a genuine &quot;nobilmente&quot; theme in the best Elgarian tradition&quot;. Bax&#x27;s third and last cinema score was for a ten-minute short film &quot;Journey into History&quot; in 1952.

Other orchestral works include &quot;Overture, Elegy and Rondo&quot; (1927) – a lightweight piece, according to &quot;Grove&quot;. The &quot;Overture to a Picaresque Comedy&quot; (1930), was for a time one of his most popular works. It was described by the composer as &quot;Straussian pastiche&quot; and by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;gay and impudent, and with that tendency to vulgarity which so easily besets the instinctively refined composer determined to let himself go&quot;, Cardus thought the work so appealing that to live up to the overture the putative comedy would have to be &quot;written by Hofmannsthal and Shaw in collaboration. Not often is English music so free and audacious as this, so gay and winning.&quot;

===Vocal music===
The critic Peter Latham remarked that he was surprised that Bax had never set any of Yeats&#x27;s poems to music. Bax replied, &quot;What, I? I should never dare!&quot;. Latham added that Bax&#x27;s sensitiveness to poetic values made him &quot;painfully aware of the violence that even the best musical setting must do to a poem&quot;. Eventually this feeling caused him to give up song-writing completely.

At the start of his composing career, songs, together with piano music, formed the core of Bax&#x27;s work. Some of the songs, mainly the early ones, are conspicuous for the virtuosity of their piano parts, which tend to overwhelm the voice. &quot;Grove&quot; contrasts the virtuoso accompaniment of &quot;The Fairies&quot; (1905) with the simpler &quot;The White Peace&quot; (1907), one of his most popular songs. The musical analyst Trevor Hold writes that the piano &quot;goes berserk&quot; in &quot;Glamour&quot; (1920). Among the poets whose verses Bax set were his brother Clifford, Burns, Chaucer, Hardy, Housman, Joyce, Synge and Tennyson. The composer himself singled out for mention in his &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; article &quot;A Celtic Song-Cycle&quot; (1904) to words by &quot;Fiona Macleod&quot; (a pen name of the poet William Sharp). Among the post-war songs, Hold considers Bax&#x27;s &quot;In the Morning&quot; (1926) to be one of the best of all settings of Housman&#x27;s works, &quot;and it makes you wish that Bax had made further explorations into the Shropshire landscape.&quot; Hold classes that song, together with &quot;Across the Door&quot; (1921), &quot;Rann of Exile&quot; (1922) and &quot;Watching the Needleboats&quot; (1932), as &quot;truly modern, 20th-century masterpieces of song&quot;.

Bax wrote a substantial number of choral works, mostly secular but some religious. He was a nominal member of the Church of England, but in the view of the critic Paul Spicer, &quot;None of Bax&#x27;s choral music can be described as devotional or even suitable for church use… Here is a secular composer writing voluptuous music.&quot; The choral works with religious texts include his largest-scale unaccompanied vocal piece, &quot;Mater ora Filium&quot; (1921), inspired by William Byrd&#x27;s Five Part Mass; it is a setting of a medieval carol from a manuscript held by Balliol College, Oxford. The composer Patrick Hadley considered it &quot;an unsurpassed example of modern unaccompanied vocal writing&quot;. Bax&#x27;s other choral works include settings of words by Shelley (&quot;Enchanted Summer&quot;, 1910), Henry Vaughan (&quot;The Morning Watch&quot;, 1935), Masefield (&quot;To Russia&quot;, 1944), and Spenser (&quot;Epithalamium&quot;, 1947).

===Chamber and solo piano music===

In his overview of Bax&#x27;s earlier chamber works, Evans identifies as among the most successful the Phantasy for viola, the Trio for piano, violin, and viola and &quot;a String Quintet of such difficulty that an adequate performance has seldom if ever been possible&quot;. He rates the Second Violin Sonata (1915) as the composer&#x27;s most individual work to that date. For Evans, the culminating point of Bax&#x27;s early chamber music was the Piano Quintet, a work &quot;of such richness of invention that it would be an ornament to the musical literature of any country or period&quot;. Foreman makes particular mention of the First String Quartet (1918 – &quot;a classical clarity of texture and form to its Celtic inspiration&quot;, and the &quot;grittier&quot; Second Quartet (1925), the Viola Sonata (1922), the Phantasy Sonata for viola and harp (1927) and the Sonata for Flute and Harp (1928).

The composer and musical scholar Christopher Palmer points out that Bax was unusual among British composers in composing a substantial oeuvre for solo piano. Bax published four piano sonatas (1910–32), which are, in Palmer&#x27;s view, as central to the composer&#x27;s piano music as the symphonies are to the orchestral output. The first two sonatas are each in a single movement, of about twenty minutes; the third and fourth are in conventional three-movement form. The First Symphony was originally planned as a large-scale piano sonata in E (1921); the manuscript score of the latter came to light in the early 1980s and was performed for the first time in 1983. Bax&#x27;s own virtuosity as a pianist is reflected in the demands of many of his piano pieces. Palmer cites Chopin and Liszt as major influences on Bax&#x27;s piano style as well as Balakirev and the other Russians whose influence is seen throughout the composer&#x27;s work. For piano duo Bax composed two tone poems, &quot;Moy Mell&quot; (1917) and &quot;Red Autumn&quot; (1931). His shorter piano pieces include picturesque miniatures such as &quot;In a Vodka Shop&quot; (1915), &quot;A Hill Tune&quot; (1920) and &quot;Water Music&quot; (1929).

==Neglect and revival==
In his later years Bax&#x27;s music fell into neglect. Sir John Barbirolli wrote, &quot;I think he felt keenly that his richly wrought and masterly scores were no longer &#x27;fashionable&#x27; to-day, but nothing could deter him from the path of complete honesty and sincerity in his musical thought.&quot; The neglect became more complete after the composer&#x27;s death. He had always sustained a Romantic outlook, distancing himself from musical modernism and especially Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s serialism, of which Bax wrote in 1951:
Neither Bax&#x27;s views nor his works were fashionable in the two decades after his death. The critic Michael Kennedy writes that the mid-1950s were a time of &quot;immense change and transition in influential musical circles.&quot; The music favoured by the cultural establishment until then was regarded as having made Britain musically parochial and indifferent to the developments of the past half-century. In Kennedy&#x27;s words, &quot;Rubbra, Bax and Ireland found themselves out in the cold&quot;.

Foreman comments that in the years after Bax&#x27;s death his reputation was kept alive by a single work – &quot;Tintagel&quot;. Kennedy estimates that it took &quot;twenty painful years&quot; before the music of the British romantics including Bax made headway against the dominance of modernism. Foreman dates the revival of Bax&#x27;s music to Handley&#x27;s performances of the Fourth Symphony and other works with the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra in the 1960s, and the pioneering recordings by Lyrita Recorded Edition of five of the symphonies. Scholarly consideration of Bax&#x27;s life and music came with studies by Colin Scott-Sutherland (1973) and Foreman (1983). Bax&#x27;s centenary in 1983 was marked by twenty programmes on BBC Radio 3, covering a wide range of the composer&#x27;s music. In 1985 the Sir Arnold Bax Trust was established to promote the composer&#x27;s work including the sponsoring of live performances and recording and publication of his music and writings. Since then a large number of Bax&#x27;s works, major and minor, have been recorded (see below). The proliferation of Bax recordings has not been matched by a revival in his fortunes in the concert hall; the critic Stephen Moss observed in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2007, &quot;Bax is considered the promotional kiss of death.&quot; In 1999 the Oxford University Press published a complete catalogue of Bax&#x27;s works compiled and annotated by Graham Parlett; &quot;Music &amp; Letters&quot; called it &quot;a benchmark for any future researchers seeking to compile a catalogue of a composer&#x27;s works&quot;.

==Recordings==
Two recordings of Bax as a pianist were made in 1929. With Lionel Tertis he recorded his own Viola Sonata for Columbia, and with May Harrison he recorded Delius&#x27;s Violin Sonata No 1 for the rival HMV label. Of the symphonies, only the Third was recorded in the composer&#x27;s lifetime; it was played by the Hallé under Barbirolli and released in 1944. The Viola Sonata, Nonet and &quot;Mater ora Filium&quot; were recorded under the auspices of the English Music Society in 1937 and 1938. The Phantasy Sonata for Viola and Harp, the Sonata for Two Pianos and a handful of the songs were recorded on 78 rpm discs. Of the tone poems, Eugene Goossens conducted the first recording of &quot;Tintagel&quot;, in 1928; twenty years later a set of &quot;The Garden of Fand&quot; with Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra was released by HMV. By 1955 Bax on record was so scarce that &quot;The Record Guide&quot; listed only &quot;Tintagel&quot;, the &quot;Coronation March&quot;, the unaccompanied choral work &quot;What is it Like to be Young and Fair?&quot; and the solo piano piece &quot;Paean&quot;.

Parlett included an extensive discography in his 1999 &quot;A Catalogue of the Works of Sir Arnold Bax&quot;, later expanded and updated in a website. At 2015 the latter lists more than 250 works by Bax that have been recorded and published. The discography includes three complete cycles of Bax&#x27;s symphonies released on CD, two by Chandos Records, the first conducted by Bryden Thomson (recorded 1983–88) and the second by Handley (2003); between them was a cycle issued by Naxos Records conducted by David Lloyd-Jones (recorded 1997–2001). The major tone poems and other orchestral works have been recorded, many of them in several different versions. Bax&#x27;s chamber music is well represented on disc, with recordings of most of the works, and multiple versions of many, including the Elegiac Trio, the Clarinet Sonata and the Fantasy Sonata. Much of the piano music has been recorded by pianists including Iris Loveridge, John McCabe, Ashley Wass and Michael Endres, though by 2015 no integral survey had yet been recorded. Of the vocal works, by far the most often recorded is &quot;Mater ora Filium&quot;, but other choral works, and a representative selection of the songs are on disc.

==Honours and legacy==
Bax received the gold medals of the Royal Philharmonic Society (1931) and the Worshipful Company of Musicians (1931), and the Cobbett medal for chamber music (1931). He was awarded honorary doctorates by the universities of Oxford (1934) and Durham (1935) and the National University of Ireland (1947). A Bax Memorial Room at University College, Cork, was opened by Vaughan Williams in 1955. After Bax&#x27;s knighthood in 1937 he was advanced to KCVO in 1953. An English Heritage blue plaque, unveiled in 1993, commemorates Bax at his birthplace, 13 Pendennis Road in Streatham.

In 1992 Ken Russell made a television film dramatising Bax&#x27;s later years, &quot;The Secret Life of Arnold Bax&quot;. Russell himself portrayed Bax and Glenda Jackson, in her final role before leaving acting for 23 years to pursue her political career, appeared as Harriet Cohen.

In 2022 a bronze plaque was installed at the Morar Hotel in Morar to commemorate Bax, who frequently stayed there from 1928 to 1940 and composed several significant works during this period. The initiative was led by the British Music Society, with support from Historic Environment Scotland.

<text>The Second Opium War (), also known as the Second Anglo-Chinese War or &quot;Arrow&quot; War, was fought between the United Kingdom and France against the Qing dynasty of China between 1856 and 1860. It was the second major conflict in the Opium Wars, which were fought over the right to import opium to China, and resulted in a second defeat for the Qing Mandate and the forced legalization of the opium trade. It caused many Chinese officials to believe that conflicts with the Western powers were no longer traditional wars, but part of a looming national crisis.

On 8 October 1856, Qing officials seized the &quot;Arrow&quot;, a British-registered cargo ship, and arrested its Chinese sailors. The British consul, Harry Parkes, protested, upon which the viceroy of Liangguang, Ye Mingchen, delivered most of the sailors to the British on 22 October, but refused to release the rest. The next day (23 October), British gunboats shelled the city of Canton which was under viceroy Ye&#x27;s jurisdiction. The British government decided to seek redress from China and dispatched a naval force led by Michael Seymour, and France joined in the action, citing as its reason the murder of a French missionary in China. After coordination with each other, the British and French stormed Canton in December 1857. Viceroy Ye was captured and the governor of Guangdong surrendered. The alliance then moved north to demand a treaty from the Qing court, and on 20 May 1858, captured the Taku Forts, seized Tianjin, and threatened the imperial capital Beijing. The Qing sued for peace, and signed the Treaty of Tientsin with Great Britain and France in 1858.

However, the Xianfeng Emperor refused to ratify the treaty, after which the Qing general Sengge Rinchen restarted the war with the British and French that month. Allied reinforcements sailed from Hong Kong, and Sengge&#x27;s troops were defeated. As the alliance&#x27;s forces advanced toward Beijing, consul Parkes and a number of British and French officers were captured as hostages, and some were tortured or murdered. These events prompted Lord Elgin to order his soldiers to fully loot and burn the Old Summer Palace as soon as they captured Beijing. The emperor and his entourage fled to Rehe, while Prince Gong stayed to conduct the negotiations, signing the Convention of Peking with the alliance on 24 October 1860, thus ratifying the Treaty of Tientsin and bringing the Second Opium War to an end.

During and after the Second Opium War, the Qing government was also forced to sign treaties with Russia, such as the Treaty of Aigun and the Convention of Peking. As a result, China ceded more than of territory to Russia in its north-east and north-west especially Outer Manchuria. With the conclusion of the war, the Qing government was able to concentrate on countering the Taiping Rebellion and maintaining its rule. Among other things, the Convention of Peking ceded the Kowloon Peninsula to the British as part of Hong Kong.

==Names==
The terms &quot;Second War&quot; and &quot;&quot;Arrow&quot; War&quot; are both used in literature. &quot;Second Opium War&quot; refers to one of Britain&#x27;s strategic objectives, legalizing the opium trade. China&#x27;s defeat also opened up all of China to British merchants, and exempted foreign imports from internal transit duties. &quot;&quot;Arrow&quot; War&quot; refers to the name of the vessel which became the starting point of the conflict.

==Prelude==
The war followed on from the First Opium War. In 1842, the Treaty of Nanking granted an indemnity and extraterritoriality to Britain, the opening of five treaty ports, and the cession of Hong Kong Island. The failure of the treaty to satisfy British goals of improved trade and diplomatic relations led to the Second Opium War (1856–1860). In China, the First Opium War is considered to have been the beginning of modern Chinese history.

Between the two wars, repeated acts of aggression against British subjects led in 1847 to the Expedition to Canton which assaulted and took, by a &quot;coup de main&quot;, the forts of the Bocca Tigris resulting in the spiking of 879 guns.

==Outbreak==
The 1850s saw the rapid growth of Western imperialism. Some of the shared goals of the Western powers were the expansion of their overseas markets and the establishment of new ports of call. The French Treaty of Huangpu, and the American Wangxia Treaty, both contained clauses allowing renegotiation of the treaties after 12 years of being in effect. In an effort to expand its privileges in China, Britain demanded that the Qing authorities renegotiate the Treaty of Nanjing (signed in 1842), citing its most favoured nation status. The British demands included opening all of China to British merchant companies, the legalising of the opium trade, the exemption of foreign imports from internal transit duties, the suppression of piracy, the regulation of the coolie trade, permission for a British ambassador to reside in Beijing, and that the English-language version of all treaties takes precedence over their Chinese language counterparts.

===&quot;Arrow&quot; incident===
To give Chinese merchant vessels operating around treaty ports the same privileges accorded to British ships by the Treaty of Nanjing, British authorities granted the vessels British registration in Hong Kong. In October 1856, Chinese marines in Canton seized a cargo ship called the &quot;Arrow&quot; on suspicion of piracy, arresting twelve of its fourteen Chinese crew members. The &quot;Arrow&quot;, which had previously been used by pirates, was captured by the Chinese government and subsequently resold. It was then registered as a British ship and still flew the British flag at the time of its detention, though its registration had expired. Its captain, Thomas Kennedy, who was aboard a nearby vessel at the time, reported seeing Chinese marines pull the British flag down from the ship. The British consul in Canton, Harry Parkes, contacted Ye Mingchen, imperial commissioner and Viceroy of Liangguang, to demand the immediate release of the crew, and an apology for the alleged insult to the flag. Ye released nine of the crew members but refused to release the other three.

===First Battle of Canton (1856)===
On 23 October, the British destroyed four barrier forts. On 25 October, a demand was made that the British be allowed to enter Canton. The next day, the British began to bombard the city, firing one shot every 10 minutes. Ye Mingchen issued a bounty on every British head taken. On 29 October, the Royal Navy blasted a hole in the poorly defended and inadequate city walls. The troops entered Canton, with the flag of the United States being planted on the walls and residence of Ye Mingchen by James Keenan, the U.S. Consul. Losses were three killed and 12 wounded. Negotiations failed and the city was bombarded. On 6 November, 23 war junks attacked and were destroyed. There were pauses for talks, with the British bombarding at intervals, causing fires. On 5 January 1857, the British returned to Hong Kong.

On 3 March 1857, the British government lost a Parliamentary vote regarding the &quot;Arrow&quot; incident and what had taken place at Canton to the end of the previous year. This defeat led to a general election in April 1857 which increased the government&#x27;s majority.

In April, the British government asked the United States of America and Russia if they were interested in alliances, but both parties rejected the offer. In May 1857, the Indian Mutiny became serious, and British troops destined for China were diverted to India. which was considered the priority issue.

===Intervention of France===
France joined the British action against China, prompted by complaints from their envoy, Baron Jean-Baptiste-Louis Gros, over the execution of a French missionary, Auguste Chapdelaine, by Chinese local authorities in Guangxi province, which at that time was not open to foreigners.

The British and the French joined forces under Admiral Sir Michael Seymour. In late 1857, a joint British and French army attacked and occupied Canton (today Guangzhou). A joint committee of the Alliance was formed. The Allies left the city governor at his post in order to maintain order on behalf of the victors. The British-French alliance maintained control of Canton for nearly four years.

The coalition then cruised north to briefly capture the Taku Forts near Tianjin in May 1858.

===Intervention of the US and Russia===
The United States and Russia sent envoys to Hong Kong to offer military help to the British and French, though in the end Russia sent no military aid.

The U.S. was involved in a minor concurrent conflict during the war, though it ignored the UK&#x27;s offer of alliance and did not coordinate with the Anglo-French forces. In 1856, the Chinese garrison at Canton shelled a United States Navy steamer, and the U.S. Navy retaliated in the Battle of the Pearl River Forts. The ships bombarded then attacked the river forts near Canton, taking them. Diplomatic efforts were renewed afterwards, and the American and Chinese governments signed an agreement for U.S. neutrality in the Second Opium War.

===Second battle of Canton (1857)===

Throughout 1857, British forces began to assemble in Hong Kong, joined by a French force. In December 1857 they had sufficient ships and men to raise the issue of the non-fulfilment of the treaty obligations by which the right of entry into Canton had been accorded. Parkes delivered an ultimatum, supported by Hong Kong governor Sir John Bowring and Admiral Sir Michael Seymour, threatening on 14 December to bombard Canton if the men were not released within 24 hours.

The remaining crew of the &quot;Arrow&quot; were then released, with no apology from Viceroy Ye Mingchen who also refused to honour the treaty terms. Seymour, Major General van Straubenzee and Admiral de Genouilly agreed the plan to attack Canton as ordered. This event came to be known as the &quot;Arrow&quot; Incident and provided the alternative name of the ensuing conflict.
Though the British were delayed by the Indian Rebellion of 1857, they followed up the &quot;Arrow&quot; Incident in 1856 and attacked Guangzhou from the Pearl River. Viceroy Ye Mingchen ordered all Chinese soldiers manning the forts not to resist the British incursion. After taking the fort near Canton with little effort, the British Army attacked Canton.

The capture of Canton, on 1 January 1858, a city with a population of over 1,000,000 by less than 6,000 troops, resulted in the British and French forces suffering 15 killed and 113 wounded. 200–650 of the defenders and inhabitants became casualties. Ye Mingchen was captured and exiled to Calcutta, India, where he starved himself to death.

Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, there was a possible attempt to poison John Bowring and his family in January, known as the Esing Bakery incident. However, if it was deliberate, the baker who had been charged with lacing bread with arsenic bungled the attempt by putting an excess of the poison into the dough, such that his victims vomited sufficient quantities of the poison that they had only a non-lethal dose left in their system. Criers were sent out with an alert, preventing further injury.

When known in Britain, the &quot;Arrow&quot; incident (and the British military response) became the subject of controversy. The British House of Commons on 3 March passed a resolution by 263 to 249 against the Government saying:

In response, the Whig Prime Minister Lord Palmerston attacked the patriotism of the Whigs who sponsored the resolution, and Parliament was dissolved, causing the British general election of March 1857.

The Chinese issue figured prominently in the election, at which Palmerston won an increased majority, silencing the voices within the Whig faction who supported China. The new parliament decided to seek redress from China based on the report about the &quot;Arrow&quot; Incident submitted by Harry Parkes. The French Empire, the United States, and the Russian Empire received requests from Britain to form an alliance.

In June 1858, the first part of the war ended with the four Treaties of Tientsin (Tianjin), to which Britain, France, Russia, and the U.S. were parties. These treaties opened 11 more ports to Western trade. The Chinese initially refused to ratify the treaties.

The major points of the treaty were:
# Britain, France, Russia, and the U.S. would have the right to establish diplomatic legations (small embassies) in Beijing (a closed city at the time)
# Ten more Chinese ports would be opened for foreign trade, including Niuzhuang, Tamsui, Hankou, and Nanjing
# The right of all foreign vessels including commercial ships to navigate freely on the Yangtze River
# The right of foreigners to travel in the internal regions of China, which had been formerly banned
# China was to pay an indemnity of four million taels of silver to Britain and two million to France.

===Treaty of Aigun===
On 28 May 1858, the separate Treaty of Aigun was signed with Russia to revise the Chinese and Russian border as determined by the Nerchinsk Treaty in 1689. Russia gained the left bank of the Amur River, pushing the border south from the Stanovoy mountains. A later treaty, the Convention of Peking in 1860, gave Russia control over a non-freezing area on the Pacific coast, where Russia founded the city of Vladivostok in 1860.

==Second phase (1858–1860)==

===Three battles of Taku Forts===


On 20 May, the British were successful at the First Battle of Taku Forts, but the peace treaty returned the forts to the Qing army.

In June 1858, shortly after the Qing imperial court agreed to the disadvantageous treaties, hawkish ministers prevailed upon the Xianfeng Emperor to resist Western encroachment. On 2 June 1858, the Xianfeng Emperor ordered the Mongol general Sengge Rinchen to guard the Taku Forts (also romanized as Ta-ku Forts and also called Daku Forts) near Tianjin. Sengge Rinchen reinforced the forts with additional artillery pieces. He also brought 4,000 Mongol cavalry from Chahar and Suiyuan.

The Second Battle of Taku Forts took place in June 1859. A British naval force with 2,200 troops and 21 ships, under the command of Admiral Sir James Hope, sailed north from Shanghai to Tianjin with newly appointed Anglo-French envoys for the embassies in Beijing. They sailed to the mouth of the Hai River guarded by the Taku Forts near Tianjin and demanded to continue inland to Beijing. Sengge Rinchen replied that the Anglo-French envoys might land up the coast at Beitang and proceed to Beijing but he refused to allow armed troops to accompany them to the Chinese capital. The Anglo-French forces insisted on landing at Taku instead of Beitang and escorting the diplomats to Beijing. On the night of 24 June 1859, a small group of British forces blew up the iron obstacles that the Chinese had placed in the Baihe River. The next day, the British forces sought to forcibly sail into the river, and shelled the Taku Forts. Low tide and soft mud prevented their landing, however, and accurate fire from Sengge Rinchen&#x27;s cannons sank four gunboats and severely damaged two others. American Commodore Josiah Tattnall III, though under orders to maintain neutrality, declared &quot;blood is thicker than water&quot;, and provided covering fire to protect the British convoy&#x27;s retreat. The failure to take the Taku Forts was a blow to British prestige, and anti-foreign resistance reached a crescendo within the Qing imperial court.

Once the Indian Mutiny was finally quelled, Sir Colin Campbell, commander-in-chief in India, was free to amass troops and supplies for another offensive in China. A &#x27;soldiers&#x27; general&#x27;, Campbell&#x27;s experience of casualties from disease in the First Opium War led him to provide the British forces with more than enough materiel and supplies, and casualties were light.

The Third Battle of Taku Forts took place in the summer of 1860. London once more dispatched Lord Elgin with an Anglo-French force of 11,000 British troops under General James Hope Grant and 6,700 French troops under General Cousin-Montauban. They pushed north with 173 ships from Hong Kong and captured the port cities of Yantai and Dalian to seal the Bohai Gulf. On 3 August they carried out a landing near Beitang (also romanized as &quot;Pei-t&#x27;ang&quot;), some from the Taku Forts, which they captured after three weeks on 21 August.

Southern Chinese laborers served with the French and British forces. One observer reported that the &quot;Chinese coolies&quot;, as he called them, &quot;renegades though they were, served the British faithfully and cheerfully... At the assault of the Peiho Forts in 1860 they carried the French ladders to the ditch, and, standing in the water up to their necks, supported them with their hands to enable the storming party to cross. It was not usual to take them into action; they, however, bore the dangers of a distant fire with great composure, evincing a strong desire to close with their compatriots, and engage them in mortal combat with their bamboos.&quot;

===Burning of the Old Summer Palaces===
After taking Tianjin on 23 August 1860, the imperial emissary and word arrived that the British had kidnapped the prefect of Tianjin. Parkes was arrested in retaliation on 18 September. Also captured were a number of British and French officers, Sikh soldiers, and a journalist from The Times. Parkes and the others were imprisoned, tortured, and interrogated.

The prisoners had been tortured by having their limbs bound with rope until their flesh was lacerated and became infected with maggots, and by having dung and dirt forced into their throats. Several were executed by beheading, their corpses fed to animals. Captured coolies who had worked for the allies were buried up to their necks and left to dogs.
The Anglo-French forces clashed with Sengge Rinchen&#x27;s Mongol cavalry on 18 September at the battle of Zhangjiawan before proceeding toward the outskirts of Beijing for a decisive battle in Tongzhou (also romanized as Tungchow). On 21 September, at Baliqiao (Eight Mile Bridge), Sengge Rinchen&#x27;s 10,000 troops, including the elite Mongol cavalry, were annihilated after doomed frontal charges against concentrated firepower of the Anglo-French forces. The French army arrived at the Summer Palace outside Beijing on 6 October, followed by the British a day later.

With the Qing army devastated, the Xianfeng Emperor fled the capital and left behind his brother, Prince Gong, to take charge of peace negotiations. Xianfeng first fled to the Chengde Summer Palace and then to Rehe Province. Anglo-French troops began looting the Summer Palace (Yiheyuan) and Old Summer Palace (Yuanmingyuan) immediately (as they were full of valuable artwork).

After the release of Parkes and the surviving prisoners on 8 October, the extent of their mistreatment became apparent. The destruction of the Forbidden City was discussed, as proposed by Lord Elgin, to discourage the Qing Empire from using kidnapping as a bargaining tool, and to exact revenge on the mistreatment of their prisoners. However, an attack on Beijing was ruled out, as this had already been presented as threat for other terms. Elgin decided on burning the Summer Palace. In a letter, he explained that the burning of the palace was the punishment &quot;which would fall, not on the people, who may be comparatively innocent, but exclusively on the Emperor, whose direct personal responsibility for the crime committed is established&quot;.

On 18 October, British soldiers burnt the Old Summer Palace, the French refusing to assist. The razing of the buildings took two days, with imperial property in the vicinity also destroyed. Most accounts say that the Old Summer Palace was burnt for three days and three nights.

==Awards==


Both Britain (Second China War Medal) and France (Commemorative medal of the 1860 China Expedition) issued campaign medals. The British medal had the following clasps: China 1842, Fatshan 1857, Canton 1857, Taku Forts 1858, Taku Forts 1860, Peking 1860.

==Aftermath==

On 24 October, the emperor&#x27;s brother, Prince Gong, conceded to the allied demands, the emperor having fled to Chengde on 22 September. British and French troops entered Beijing, where the Treaty of Tientsin was ratified by the Convention of Peking.

At the time, the largest encyclopedia ever compiled in world history was the 1408 Ming Dynasty &quot;Yongle Encyclopedia&quot;, most of which was looted or destroyed by foreign soldiers during the sack of Beijing, leaving only 3.5 percent surviving volumes today. The British, French and—thanks to the schemes of Ignatiev—the Russians were all granted a permanent diplomatic presence in Beijing (something the Qing Empire resisted to the very end as it suggested equality between China and the European powers). The Chinese had to pay 8 million taels to Britain and France. Kowloon was ceded to the British owned Hong Kong. The opium trade was legalized and Christians were granted full civil rights, including the right to own property, and the right to evangelize.

The content of the Convention of Beijing included:
# China&#x27;s signing of the Treaty of Tianjin
# Opening Tianjin as a trade port
# Cede No.1 District of Kowloon (south of present-day Boundary Street) to Britain
# Freedom of religion established in China
# British ships were allowed to carry indentured Chinese to the Americas
# Indemnity to Britain and France increasing to 8 million taels of silver apiece
# Legalization of the opium trade

Two weeks later, Ignatiev forced the Qing government to sign a &quot;Supplementary Treaty of Peking&quot;, which ceded the Maritime Provinces east of the Ussuri River (forming part of Outer Manchuria) to the Russians, who went on to found the port of Vladivostok between 1860 and 1861.
The Anglo-French victory was heralded in the British press as a triumph for British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston, which made his popularity rise to new heights. British merchants were delighted at the prospects of the expansion of trade in the Far East. Other foreign powers were pleased with the outcome too, since they hoped to take advantage of the opening-up of China.

The defeat of the Qing army by a relatively small Anglo-French military force (outnumbered at least 10 to 1 by the Qing army) coupled with the flight (and subsequent death) of the Xianfeng Emperor, and the burning of the Summer Palace, was a shocking blow to the once powerful Qing Empire. &quot;Beyond a doubt, by 1860 the ancient civilization that was China had been thoroughly defeated and humiliated by the West.&quot; After the war, a major modernization movement, known as the Self-Strengthening Movement, began in China, and several institutional reforms were initiated. As the Qing government became increasingly obligated to pay indemnities and protect Westerners following its loss in the Second Opium War and given the Unequal Treaties, resistance to Qing rule increased.

The opium trade incurred intense opposition from the later British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone. As a member of Parliament, Gladstone called it &quot;most infamous and atrocious&quot;, referring to the opium trade between China and British India in particular. Gladstone was fiercely against both of the Opium Wars, was ardently opposed to the British trade in opium to China, and denounced British violence against Chinese. Gladstone lambasted it as &quot;Palmerston&#x27;s Opium War&quot; and said that he felt &quot;in dread of the judgments of God upon England for our national iniquity towards China&quot; in May 1840. Gladstone made a famous speech in Parliament against the First Opium War, criticising it as &quot;a war more unjust in its origin, a war more calculated in its progress to cover this country with permanent disgrace&quot;. His hostility to opium stemmed from the effects of the drug upon his sister Helen. Due to his disgust at the First Opium War, brought on by Palmerston, Gladstone was initially reluctant to join the government of Robert Peel, but did so in 1841.

 Seven awards were made of the Victoria Cross, all for gallantry shown on 21 August 1860 by soldiers of the 44th Regiment of Foot and the 67th Regiment of Foot at the Battle of Taku Forts (1860) (see List of Victoria Cross recipients by campaign)

<doc id="147156" wikidata="Q356499" url="?curid=147156" title="Michael Tippett">
<text>Sir Michael Kemp Tippett (2 January 1905 – 8 January 1998) was an English composer who rose to prominence during and immediately after the Second World War. In his lifetime he was sometimes ranked with his contemporary Benjamin Britten as one of the leading British composers of the 20th century. Among his best-known works are the oratorio &quot;A Child of Our Time&quot;, the orchestral &quot;Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli&quot;, and the opera &quot;The Midsummer Marriage&quot;.

Tippett&#x27;s talent developed slowly. He withdrew or destroyed his earliest compositions, and was 30 before any of his works were published. Until the mid-to-late 1950s his music was broadly lyrical in character, before changing to a more astringent and experimental style. New influences—including those of jazz and blues after his first visit to America in 1965—became increasingly evident in his compositions. While Tippett&#x27;s stature with the public continued to grow, not all critics approved of these changes in style, some believing that the quality of his work suffered as a consequence. From around 1976 his late works began to reflect the works of his youth through a return to lyricism. Although he was much honoured in his lifetime, critical judgement on Tippett&#x27;s legacy has been uneven, the greatest praise generally reserved for his earlier works. His centenary in 2005 was a muted affair; apart from the few best-known works, his music has not been performed frequently in the 21st century.

Having briefly embraced communism in the 1930s, Tippett avoided identifying with any political party. A pacifist after 1940, he was imprisoned in 1943 for refusing to carry out war-related duties required by his military exemption. His initial difficulties in accepting his homosexuality led him in 1939 to Jungian psychoanalysis; the Jungian dichotomy of &quot;shadow&quot; and &quot;light&quot; remained a recurring factor in his music. He was a strong advocate of music education, and was active for much of his life as a radio broadcaster and writer on music.

==Life==

===Family background===
The Tippett family originated in Cornwall. Michael Tippett&#x27;s grandfather, George Tippett, left the county in 1854 to make his fortune in London through property speculation and other business schemes. A flamboyant character, he had a strong tenor voice that was a popular feature at Christian revivalist meetings. In later life his business enterprises faltered, leading to debts, prosecution for fraud, and a term of imprisonment. His son Henry, born in 1858, was Michael&#x27;s father. A lawyer by training, he was successful in business and was independently wealthy by the time of his marriage in April 1903. Unusually for his background and upbringing, Henry Tippett was a progressive liberal and a religious sceptic.

Henry Tippett&#x27;s bride was Isabel Kemp, from a large upper-middle-class family based in Kent. Among her mother&#x27;s cousins was Charlotte Despard, a well-known campaigner for women&#x27;s rights, suffragism, and Irish home rule. Despard was a powerful influence on the young Isabel, who was herself briefly imprisoned after participating in an illegal suffragette protest in Trafalgar Square. Though neither she nor Henry was musical, she had inherited an artistic talent from her mother, who had exhibited at the Royal Academy. After their marriage the couple settled outside London in Eastcote, where two sons were born—the second, Michael, on 2 January 1905.

===Childhood and schooling===

Shortly after Michael&#x27;s birth, the family moved to Wetherden in Suffolk. Michael&#x27;s education began in 1909 with a nursery governess and various private tutors who followed a curriculum that included piano lessons—his first formal contact with music. There was a piano in the house, on which he &quot;took to improvising crazily ... which I called &#x27;composing&#x27;, though I had only the vaguest notion of what that meant&quot;. In September 1914 Michael became a boarder at Brookfield Preparatory School in Swanage, Dorset. He spent four years there, at one point earning notoriety by writing an essay that challenged the existence of God. In 1918 he won a scholarship to Fettes College, a boarding school in Edinburgh, where he studied the piano, sang in the choir, and began to learn to play the pipe organ. The school was not a happy place; sadistic bullying of the younger pupils was commonplace. When Michael revealed to his parents in March 1920 that he had formed a homosexual relationship with another boy, they removed him to Stamford School in Lincolnshire, where a decade previously Malcolm Sargent had been a pupil.

Around this time Henry Tippett decided to live in France, and the house in Wetherden was sold. The 15-year-old Michael and his brother Peter remained at school in England, travelling to France for their holidays. Michael found Stamford much more congenial than Fettes, and developed both academically and musically. He found an inspiring piano teacher in Frances Tinkler, who introduced him to the music of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, and Chopin. Sargent had maintained his connection with the school, and was present when Tippett and another boy played Bach&#x27;s &quot;C minor Concerto for Two Harpsichords&quot; on pianos with a local string orchestra. Tippett sang in the chorus when Sargent directed a local performance of Robert Planquette&#x27;s operetta . Despite his parents&#x27; wish that he follow an orthodox path by proceeding to Cambridge University, Tippett had firmly decided on a career as a composer, a prospect that alarmed them and was discouraged by his headmaster and by Sargent.

By mid-1922 Tippett had developed a rebellious streak. His overt atheism particularly troubled the school, and he was required to leave. He remained in Stamford in private lodgings, while continuing lessons with Tinkler and with the organist of St Mary&#x27;s Church. He also began studying Charles Villiers Stanford&#x27;s book &quot;Musical Composition&quot;, which, he later wrote, &quot;became the basis of all my compositional efforts for decades to come&quot;. In 1923 Henry Tippett was persuaded that some form of musical career, perhaps as a concert pianist, was possible, and agreed to support his son in a course of study at the Royal College of Music (RCM). After an interview with the college principal, Sir Hugh Allen, Tippett was accepted despite his lack of formal entry qualifications.

===Royal College of Music===

Tippett began at the RCM in the summer term of 1923, when he was 18 years old. At the time, his biographer Meirion Bowen records, &quot;his aspirations were Olympian, though his knowledge rudimentary&quot;. Life in London widened his musical awareness, especially the Proms at the Queen&#x27;s Hall, opera at Covent Garden (where he saw Dame Nellie Melba&#x27;s farewell performance in &quot;La bohème&quot;) and the Diaghilev Ballet. He heard Chaliapin sing, and attended concerts conducted by, among others, Stravinsky and Ravel—the last-named &quot;a tiny man who stood bolt upright and conducted with what to me looked like a pencil&quot;. Tippett overcame his initial ignorance of early music by attending Palestrina masses at Westminster Cathedral, following the music with the help of a borrowed score.

At the RCM, Tippett&#x27;s first composition tutor was Charles Wood, who used the models of Bach, Mozart and Beethoven to instil a solid understanding of musical forms and syntax. When Wood died in 1926, Tippett chose to study with C.H. Kitson, whose pedantic approach and lack of sympathy with Tippett&#x27;s compositional aims strained the relationship between teacher and pupil. Tippett studied conducting with Sargent and Adrian Boult, finding the latter a particularly empathetic mentor—he let Tippett stand with him on the rostrum during rehearsals and follow the music from the conductor&#x27;s score. By this means Tippett became familiar with the music of composers then new to him, such as Delius and Debussy, and learned much about the sounds of orchestral instruments.

In 1924 Tippett became the conductor of an amateur choir in the Surrey village of Oxted. Although he saw this initially as a means of advancing his knowledge of English madrigals, his association with the choir lasted many years. Under his direction it combined with a local theatrical group, the Oxted and Limpsfield Players, to give performances of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s opera &quot;The Shepherds of the Delectable Mountains&quot; and of Tippett&#x27;s own adaptation of an 18th-century ballad opera, &quot;The Village Opera&quot;. He passed his Bachelor of Music (BMus) exams, at his second attempt, in December 1928. Rather than continuing to study for a doctorate, Tippett decided to leave the academic environment. The RCM years had brought him intense and lasting friendships with members of both sexes, in particular with Francesca Allinson and David Ayerst.

===Early career===

====False start====
On leaving the RCM, Tippett settled in Oxted to continue his work with the choir and theatrical group and to compose. To support himself he taught French at Hazelwood, a small preparatory school in Limpsfield, which provided him with a salary of £80 a year and a cottage. Also teaching at the school was Christopher Fry, the future poet and playwright who later collaborated with Tippett on several of the composer&#x27;s early works.

In February 1930 Tippett provided the incidental music for a performance by his theatrical group of James Elroy Flecker&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan&quot;, and in October he directed them in his own adaptation of Stanford&#x27;s opera &quot;The Travelling Companion&quot;. His compositional output was such that on 5 April 1930 he gave a concert in Oxted consisting entirely of his own works—a Concerto in D for flutes, oboe, horns and strings; settings for tenor of poems by Charlotte Mew; &quot;Psalm in C&quot; for chorus and orchestra, with a text by Christopher Fry; piano variations on the song &quot;Jockey to the Fair&quot;; and a string quartet. Professional soloists and orchestral players were engaged, and the concert was conducted by David Moule-Evans, a friend from the RCM. Despite encouraging comments from &quot;The Times&quot; and the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, Tippett was deeply dissatisfied with the works, and decided that he needed further tuition. He withdrew the music, and in September 1930 re-enrolled at the RCM for a special course of study in counterpoint with R. O. Morris, an expert on 16th-century music. This second RCM period, during which he learned to write fugues in the style of Bach and received additional tuition in orchestration from Gordon Jacob, was central to Tippett&#x27;s eventual discovery of what he termed his &quot;individual voice&quot;.

On 15 November 1931 Tippett conducted his Oxted choir in a performance of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;, using choral and orchestral forces close to Handel&#x27;s original intentions. Such an approach was rare at that time, and the event attracted considerable interest.

====Friendships, politics and music====
In mid-1932 Tippett moved to a cottage in neighbouring Limpsfield, provided by friends as a haven in which he could concentrate on composition. His friendships with Ayerst and Allinson had opened up new cultural and political vistas. Through Ayerst he met W. H. Auden, who in due course introduced him to T. S. Eliot. Although no deep friendship developed with either poet, Tippett came to consider Eliot his &quot;spiritual father&quot;. Ayerst also introduced him to a young artist, Wilfred Franks. By this time Tippett was coming to terms with his homosexuality, while not always at ease with it. Franks provided him with what he called &quot;the deepest, most shattering experience of falling in love&quot;. This intense relationship ran alongside a political awakening. Tippett&#x27;s natural sympathies had always been leftish, and became more consciously so from his inclusion in Allinson&#x27;s circle of left-wing activists. As a result, he gave up his teaching position at Hazelwood to become the conductor of the South London Orchestra, a project financed by the London County Council and made up of unemployed musicians. Its first public concert was held on 5 March 1933 at Morley College, later to become Tippett&#x27;s professional base.

In the summers of 1932 and 1934 Tippett took charge of musical activities at miners&#x27; work camps near Boosbeck in the north of England. Known as the Cleveland Work Camps, they were run by a munificent local landowner, Major Pennyman, to give unemployed miners a sense of purpose and independence. In 1932 Tippett arranged the staging of a shortened version of John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, with locals playing the main parts, and the following year he provided the music for a new folk opera, &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, with words by Ayerst, himself and Ruth Pennyman. Both works proved hugely popular with their audiences, and although most of the music has disappeared, Tippett revived some of &quot;Robin Hood&quot; for use in his &quot;Birthday Suite for Prince Charles&quot; of 1948. In October 1934 Tippett and the South London Orchestra performed at a centenary celebration of the Tolpuddle Martyrs, as part of a grand Pageant of Labour at the Crystal Palace.

Tippett was not formally a member of any political party or group until 1935, when he joined the British Communist Party at the urging of his cousin, Phyllis Kemp. This membership was brief; the influence of Trotsky&#x27;s &quot;History of the Russian Revolution&quot; had led him to embrace Trotskyism, while the party maintained a strict Stalinist line. Tippett resigned after a few months when he saw no chance of converting his local party to his Trotskyist views. According to his obituarist J.J. Plant, Tippett then joined the Bolshevik-Leninist Group within the Labour Party, where he continued to advocate Trotskyism until at least 1938. Although Tippett&#x27;s radical instincts always remained strong, he was aware that excessive political activism would distract him from his overriding objective of becoming recognised as a composer. A significant step towards professional recognition came in December 1935, when the Brosa Quartet performed his String Quartet No. 1 at the Mercury Theatre in Notting Hill, London. This work, which he dedicated to Franks, is the first in the recognised canon of Tippett&#x27;s music. Throughout much of the 1930s Wilf Franks continued to be an important influence on Tippett both creatively and politically. Franks had a passion for the poetry of both William Blake and Wilfred Owen; Tippett claimed that Franks knew Owen&#x27;s poetry &#x27;almost word for word and draws it out for me, its meanings, its divine pity and so on...&#x27;.

===Towards maturity===

====Personal crisis====
Before the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Tippett released two further works: the Piano Sonata No. 1, first performed by Phyllis Sellick at the Queen Mary Hall, London, on 11 November 1938, and the Concerto for Double String Orchestra, which was not performed until 1940. In a climate of increasing political and military tension, Tippett&#x27;s compositional efforts were overwhelmed by an emotional crisis. When his relationship with Franks ended acrimoniously in August 1938 he was thrown into doubt and confusion about both his homosexuality and his worth as an artist. He was saved from despair when, at Ayerst&#x27;s suggestion, he undertook a course of Jungian analysis with the psychotherapist John Layard. Through an extended course of therapy, Layard gave Tippett the means to analyse and interpret his dreams. Tippett&#x27;s biographer Ian Kemp describes this experience as &quot;the major turning point in [his] life&quot;, both emotionally and artistically. His particular discovery from dream analysis was &quot;the Jungian &#x27;shadow&#x27; and &#x27;light&#x27; in the single, individual psyche ... the need for the individual to accept his divided nature and profit from its conflicting demands&quot;. This brought him to terms with his homosexuality, and he was able to pursue his creativity without being distracted by personal relationships. While still unsure of his sexuality, Tippett had considered marriage with Francesca Allinson, who had expressed the wish that they should have children together. After his psychotherapy he enjoyed several committed—and sometimes overlapping—same-sex relationships. Among the most enduring, and most tempestuous, was that with the artist Karl Hawker, whom he first met in 1941.

====&quot;A Child of Our Time&quot;====
While his therapy proceeded, Tippett was searching for a theme for a major work—an opera or an oratorio—that could reflect both the contemporary turmoil in the world and his own recent catharsis. Having briefly considered the theme of the Dublin Easter Rising of 1916, he based his work on a more immediate event: the murder in Paris of a German diplomat by a 17-year-old Jewish refugee, Herschel Grynszpan. This murder triggered &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; (Crystal Night), a coordinated attack on Jews and their property throughout Nazi Germany on 9–10 November 1938. Tippett hoped that Eliot would provide a libretto for the oratorio, and the poet showed interest. But when Tippett presented him with a more detailed scenario, Eliot advised him to write his own text, suggesting that the poetic quality of the words might otherwise dominate the music. Tippett called the oratorio &quot;A Child of Our Time&quot;, taking the title from &quot;Ein Kind unserer Zeit&quot;, a contemporary protest novel by the Austro-Hungarian writer Ödön von Horváth. Within a three-part structure based on Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;, Tippett took the novel step of using North American spirituals in place of the traditional chorales that punctuate oratorio texts. According to Kenneth Gloag&#x27;s commentary, the spirituals provide &quot;moments of focus and repose ... giving shape to both the musical and literary dimensions of the work&quot;. Tippett began composing the oratorio in September 1939, on the conclusion of his dream therapy and immediately after the outbreak of war.

====Morley, war, imprisonment====
With the South London Orchestra temporarily disbanded because of the war, Tippett returned to teaching at Hazelwood. In October 1940 he accepted the post of Director of Music at Morley College, just after its buildings were almost completely destroyed by a bomb. Tippett&#x27;s challenge was to rebuild the musical life of the college, using temporary premises and whatever resources he could muster. He revived the Morley College Choir and orchestra, and arranged innovative concert programmes that typically mixed early music (Orlando Gibbons, Monteverdi, Dowland), with contemporary works by Stravinsky, Hindemith and Bartók.
He continued the college&#x27;s established association with the music of Purcell; a performance in November 1941 of Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Ode to St Cecilia&quot;, with improvised instruments and rearrangements of voice parts, attracted considerable attention. The music staff at Morley was augmented by the recruitment of refugee musicians from Europe, including Walter Bergmann, Mátyás Seiber, and Walter Goehr, who took charge of the college orchestra.

&quot;A Child of Our Time&quot; was finished in 1941 and put aside with no immediate prospects of performance. Tippett&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia on a Theme of Handel&quot; for piano and orchestra was performed at the Wigmore Hall in March 1942, with Sellick again the soloist, and the same venue saw the première of the composer&#x27;s String Quartet No. 2 a year later. The first recording of Tippett&#x27;s music, the Piano Sonata No. 1 played by Sellick, was issued in August 1941. The recording was well received by critics; Wilfrid Mellers predicted a leading role for Tippett in the future of English music. In 1942, Schott Music began to publish Tippett&#x27;s works, establishing an association that continued until the end of the composer&#x27;s life.

The question of Tippett&#x27;s liability for war service remained unresolved until mid-1943. In November 1940 he had formalised his pacifism by joining the Peace Pledge Union and applying for registration as a conscientious objector. His case was heard by a tribunal in February 1942, when he was assigned to non-combatant duties. Tippett rejected such work as an unacceptable compromise with his principles and in June 1943, after several further hearings and statements on his behalf from distinguished musical figures, he was sentenced to three months&#x27; imprisonment in HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs. He served two months, and although thereafter he was technically liable to further charges for failing to comply with the terms set by his tribunal, the authorities left him alone.

===Recognition and controversy===
On his release, Tippett returned to his duties at Morley, where he boosted the college&#x27;s Purcell tradition by persuading the countertenor Alfred Deller to sing several Purcell odes at a concert on 21 October 1944—the first modern use of a countertenor in Purcell&#x27;s music. Tippett formed a fruitful musical friendship with Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears, for whom he wrote the cantata &quot;Boyhood&#x27;s End&quot; for tenor and piano. Encouraged by Britten, Tippett made arrangements for the first performance of &quot;A Child of Our Time&quot;, at London&#x27;s Adelphi Theatre on 19 March 1944. Goehr conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and Morley&#x27;s choral forces were augmented by the London Regional Civil Defence Choir. Pears sang the tenor solo part, and other soloists were borrowed from Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera. The work was well received by critics and the public, and eventually became one of the most frequently performed large-scale choral works of the post-Second World War period, in Britain and overseas. Tippett&#x27;s immediate reward was a commission from the BBC for a motet, &quot;The Weeping Babe&quot;, which became his first broadcast work when it was aired on 24 December 1944. He also began to give regular radio talks on music.

In 1946 Tippett organised at Morley the first British performance of Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Vespers&quot;, adding his own organ &quot;Preludio&quot; for the occasion. Tippett&#x27;s compositions in the immediate postwar years included his First Symphony, performed under Sargent in November 1945, and the String Quartet No. 3, premiered in October 1946 by the Zorian Quartet. His main creative energies were increasingly devoted to his first major opera, &quot;The Midsummer Marriage&quot;. During the six years from 1946 he composed almost no other music, apart from the &quot;Birthday Suite for Prince Charles&quot; (1948).
The musical and philosophical ideas behind the opera had begun in Tippett&#x27;s mind several years earlier. The story, which he wrote himself, charts the fortunes of two contrasting couples in a manner which has brought comparison with Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;. The strain of composition, combined with his continuing responsibilities at Morley and his BBC work, affected Tippett&#x27;s health and slowed progress. Following the death in 1949 of Morley&#x27;s principal, Eva Hubback, Tippett&#x27;s personal commitment to the college waned. His now-regular BBC fees had made him less dependent on his Morley salary, and he resigned his college post in 1951. His farewell took the form of three concerts he conducted at the new Royal Festival Hall, in which the programmes included &quot;A Child of Our Time&quot;, the British première of Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;, and Thomas Tallis&#x27;s rarely performed 40-part motet &quot;Spem in alium&quot;.

In 1951 Tippett moved from Limpsfield to a large, dilapidated house, Tidebrook Manor in Wadhurst, Sussex. As &quot;The Midsummer Marriage&quot; neared completion he wrote a song cycle for tenor and piano, &quot;The Heart&#x27;s Assurance&quot;. This work, a long-delayed tribute to Francesca Allinson (who had committed suicide in 1945), was performed by Britten and Pears at the Wigmore Hall on 7 May 1951. &quot;The Midsummer Marriage&quot; was finished in 1952, after which Tippett arranged some of the music as a concert suite, the &quot;Ritual Dances&quot;, performed in Basel, Switzerland, in April 1953. The opera itself was staged at Covent Garden on 27 January 1955. The lavish production, with costumes and stage designs by Barbara Hepworth and choreography by John Cranko, perplexed the opera-going public and divided critical opinion. According to Bowen, most &quot;were simply unprepared for a work that departed so far from the methods of Puccini and Verdi&quot;. Tippett&#x27;s libretto was variously described as &quot;one of the worst in the 350-year history of opera&quot; and &quot;a complex network of verbal symbolism&quot;, and the music as &quot;intoxicating beauty&quot; with &quot;passages of superbly conceived orchestral writing&quot;. A year after the première, the critic A.E.F. Dickinson concluded that &quot;in spite of notable gaps in continuity and distracting infelicities of language, [there is] strong evidence that the composer has found the right music for his ends&quot;.

Much of the music Tippett composed following the opera&#x27;s completion reflected its lyrical style. Among these was the &quot;Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli&quot; (1953) for string orchestra, written to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the composer Arcangelo Corelli&#x27;s birth. The &quot;Fantasia&quot; eventually became one of Tippett&#x27;s most popular works, though &quot;The Times&quot;″s critic lamented the &quot;excessive complexity of the contrapuntal writing ... there was so much going on that the perplexed ear knew not where to turn or fasten itself&quot;. Such comments helped foster a view that Tippett was a &quot;difficult&quot; composer, or even that his music was amateurish and poorly prepared. These perceptions were strengthened by controversies around several of his works in the late 1950s. The Piano Concerto (1955) was declared unplayable by its scheduled soloist, Julius Katchen, who had to be replaced before the première by Louis Kentner. The Dennis Brain Wind Ensemble, for whom Tippett had written the &quot;Sonata for Four Horns&quot; (1955), complained that the work was in too high a key and required it to be transposed down. When the Second Symphony was premièred by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Boult, in a live broadcast from the Royal Festival Hall on 5 February 1958, the work broke down after a few minutes and had to be restarted by the apologetic conductor: &quot;Entirely my mistake, ladies and gentlemen&quot;. The BBC&#x27;s Controller of Music defended the orchestra in &quot;The Times&quot;, writing that it &quot;is equal to all reasonable demands&quot;, a wording that implied the fault was the composer&#x27;s.

===International acclaim===

====&quot;King Priam&quot; and after====

In 1960 Tippett moved to a house in the Wiltshire village of Corsham, where he lived with his long-term partner Karl Hawker. By then Tippett had begun work on his second major opera, &quot;King Priam&quot;. He chose for his theme the tragedy of Priam, mythological king of the Trojans, as recorded in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, and again he prepared his own libretto. As with &quot;The Midsummer Marriage&quot;, Tippett&#x27;s preoccupation with the opera meant that his compositional output was limited for several years to a few minor works, including a &quot;Magnificat&quot; and &quot;Nunc Dimittis&quot; written in 1961 for the 450th anniversary of the foundation of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. &quot;King Priam&quot; was premièred in Coventry by the Covent Garden Opera on 29 May 1962 as part of a festival celebrating the consecration of the new Coventry Cathedral. The production was by Sam Wanamaker and the lighting by Sean Kenny. John Pritchard was the conductor. The music for the new work displayed a marked stylistic departure from what Tippett had written hitherto, heralding what a later commentator, Iain Stannard, calls a &quot;great divide&quot; between the works before and after &quot;King Priam&quot;. Some commentators questioned the wisdom of so radical a departure from his established voice, but the opera was a considerable success with critics and the public. Lewis later called it &quot;one of the most powerful operatic experiences in the modern theatre&quot;. This reception, combined with the fresh acclaim for &quot;The Midsummer Marriage&quot; following a well-received BBC broadcast in 1963, did much to rescue Tippett&#x27;s reputation and establish him as a leading figure among British composers.

As with &quot;The Midsummer Marriage&quot;, the compositions that followed &quot;King Priam&quot; retained the musical idiom of the opera, notably the Piano Sonata No. 2 (1962) and the Concerto for Orchestra (1963), the latter written for the Edinburgh Festival and dedicated to Britten for his 50th birthday. Tippett&#x27;s main work in the mid-1960s was the cantata &quot;The Vision of Saint Augustine&quot;, commissioned by the BBC, which Bowen marks as a peak of Tippett&#x27;s compositional career: &quot;Not since &quot;The Midsummer Marriage&quot; had he unleashed such a torrent of musical invention&quot;. His status as a national figure was now being increasingly recognised. He had been appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1959; in 1961 he was made an honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Music (HonFRCM), and in 1964 he received from Cambridge University the first of many honorary doctorates. In 1966 he was knighted.

====Wider horizons====
In 1965 Tippett made the first of several visits to the United States, to serve as composer in residence at the Aspen Music Festival in Colorado. His American experiences had a significant effect on the music he composed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with jazz and blues elements particularly evident in his third opera, &quot;The Knot Garden&quot; (1966–69), and in the Symphony No. 3 (1970–72). At home in 1969, Tippett worked with the conductor Colin Davis to rescue the Bath International Music Festival from a financial crisis, and became the festival&#x27;s artistic director for the next five seasons. In 1970, following the collapse of his relationship with Hawker, he left Corsham and moved to a secluded house on the Marlborough Downs. Among the works he wrote in this period were &quot;In Memoriam Magistri&quot; (1971), a chamber piece commissioned by &quot;Tempo&quot; magazine as a memorial to Stravinsky, who had died on 6 April 1971, and the Piano Sonata No. 3 (1973).
In February 1974 Tippett attended a &quot;Michael Tippett Festival&quot; arranged in his honour by Tufts University, near Boston, Massachusetts. He was also present at a performance of &quot;The Knot Garden&quot; at Northwestern University at Evanston, Illinois—the first Tippett opera to be performed in the US. Two years later he was again in the country, engaged on a lecture tour that included the Doty Lectures in Fine Art at the University of Texas. Between these American journeys, Tippett travelled to Lusaka for the first African performance of &quot;A Child of Our Time&quot;, at which the Zambian president, Kenneth Kaunda, was present.

In 1976 Tippett was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society. The following few years saw journeys to Java and Bali—where he was much attracted by the sounds of gamelan ensembles—and to Australia, where he conducted a performance of his Fourth Symphony in Adelaide. In 1979, with funds available from the sale of some of his original manuscripts to the British Library, Tippett inaugurated the Michael Tippett Musical Foundation, which provided financial support to young musicians and music education initiatives.

Tippett maintained his pacifist beliefs, while becoming generally less public in expressing them, and from 1959 served as president of the Peace Pledge Union. In 1977 he made a rare political statement when, opening a PPU exhibition at St Martin-in-the-Fields, he attacked President Carter&#x27;s plans to develop a neutron bomb.

===Later life===
In his seventies, Tippett continued to compose and travel, although now handicapped by health problems. His eyesight was deteriorating as a result of macular dystrophy, and he relied increasingly on his musical amanuensis Michael Tillett, and on Meirion Bowen, who became Tippett&#x27;s assistant and closest companion in the remaining years of the composer&#x27;s life. The main works of the late 1970s were a new opera, &quot;The Ice Break&quot;, the Symphony No. 4, the String Quartet No. 4, and the Triple Concerto for violin, viola and cello. &quot;The Ice Break&quot; was a reflection of Tippett&#x27;s American experiences, with a contemporary storyline incorporating race riots and drug-taking. His libretto has been criticised for its awkward attempts at American street vernacular, and the opera has not found a place in the general repertory. Mellers finds that its fusion of &quot;art music, rock ritual and performance art fail to gel&quot;. The Triple Concerto includes a finale inspired by the gamelan music Tippett absorbed during his visit to Java.

In 1979 Tippett was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH). The main composition that occupied him in the early 1980s was his oratorio &quot;The Mask of Time&quot;, loosely based on Jacob Bronowski&#x27;s 1973 TV series &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot;. In Tippett&#x27;s words, this is an attempt to deal &quot;with those fundamental matters that bear upon man, his relationship with Time, his place in the world as we know it and in the mysterious universe at large&quot;. The oratorio was commissioned by the Boston Symphony Orchestra for its centenary, and was one of several of Tippett&#x27;s late compositions that were premièred in America. 
In 1983 Tippett became president of the London College of Music and was appointed a Member of the Order of Merit (OM). By the time of his 80th birthday in 1985 he was blind in his right eye, and his output had slowed. Nevertheless, in his final active years he wrote his last opera, &quot;New Year&quot;. This futuristic fable involving flying saucers, time travel, and urban violence was indifferently received on its première in Houston, Texas, on 17 October 1989. Donal Henahan in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Unlike Wagner, [Tippett] does not provide music of enough quality to allow one to overlook textual absurdities and commonplaces.&quot; The opera was introduced to Britain in the Glyndebourne Festival of 1990.

Despite his deteriorating health, Tippett toured Australia in 1989–90, and also visited Senegal. His last major works, written between 1988 and 1993, were &quot;Byzantium&quot;, for soprano and orchestra; the String Quartet No. 5; and &quot;The Rose Lake&quot;, a &quot;song without words for orchestra&quot; inspired by a visit to Lake Retba in Senegal during his 1990 trip. He intended &quot;The Rose Lake&quot; to be his farewell, but in 1996 he broke his retirement to write &quot;Caliban&#x27;s Song&quot; as a contribution to the Purcell tercentenary.

===Death===
In 1997 he moved from Wiltshire to London to be closer to his friends and caregivers; in November of that year he made his last overseas trip, to Stockholm for a festival of his music. After suffering a stroke he was taken home, where he died on 8 January 1998, six days after his 93rd birthday. He was cremated on 15 January, at Hanworth crematorium, after a secular service.

==Music==
===General character===
Bowen has called Tippett &quot;a composer of our time&quot;, one who engaged with the social, political and cultural issues of his day. Arnold Whittall sees the music as embodying Tippett&#x27;s philosophy of &quot;ultimately optimistic humanism&quot;. Rather than ignoring the barbarism of the 20th century, says Kemp, Tippett chose through his works to seek &quot;to preserve or remake those values that have been perverted, while at the same time never losing sight of the contemporary reality&quot;. The key early work in this respect is &quot;A Child of Our Time&quot;, of which Clarke writes: &quot;[t]he words of the oratorio&#x27;s closing ensemble, &#x27;I would know my shadow and my light, So shall I at last be whole&#x27;, have become canonical in commentary on Tippett ... this [Jungian] statement crystallizes an ethic, and aesthetic, central to his world-view, and one which underlies all his text-based works&quot;.

Sceptical critics such as the musicologist Derrick Puffett have argued that Tippett&#x27;s craft as a composer was insufficient for him to deal adequately with the task that he had set himself of &quot;transmut[ing] his personal and private agonies into ... something universal and impersonal&quot;. Michael Kennedy has referred to Tippett&#x27;s &quot;open‐eyed, even naive outlook on the world&quot;, while accepting the technical sophistication of his music. Others have acknowledged his creative ingenuity and willingness to adopt whatever means or techniques were necessary to fit his intentions.

Tippett&#x27;s music is marked by the expansive nature of his melodic line—the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;″s Ivan Hewett refers to his &quot;astonishingly long-breathed melodies&quot;. According to Jones, a further element of the &quot;individual voice&quot; that emerged in 1935 was Tippett&#x27;s handling of rhythm and counterpoint, demonstrated in the First String Quartet—Tippett&#x27;s first use of the additive rhythm and cross-rhythm polyphony which became part of his musical signature. This approach to metre and rhythm is derived in part from Bartók and Stravinsky but also from the English madrigalists. Sympathy with the past, observed by Colin Mason in an early appraisal of the composer&#x27;s work, was at the root of the neoclassicism that is a feature of Tippett&#x27;s music, at least until the Second Symphony (1957).

In terms of tonality, Tippett shifted his ground in the course of his career. His earlier works, up to &quot;The Midsummer Marriage&quot;, are key-centred, but thereafter he moved through bitonality into what the composer Charles Fussell has called &quot;the freely-organized harmonic worlds&quot; of the Third Symphony and &quot;The Ice Break&quot;. Although Tippett flirted with the &quot;twelve-tone&quot; technique—he introduced a twelve-tone theme into the &quot;storm&quot; prelude that begins &quot;The Knot Garden&quot;—Bowen records that he generally rejected serialism as incompatible with his musical aims.

===Compositional process===
Tippett described himself as the receiver of inspiration rather than its originator, the creative spark coming from a particular personal experience, which might take one of many forms but was most often associated with listening to music. The process of composing was lengthy and laborious, the actual writing down of the music being preceded by several stages of gestation; as Tippett put it, &quot;the concepts come first, and then a lot of work and imaginative processes until eventually, when you&#x27;re ready, &quot;finally&quot; ready, you look for the actual notes&quot;. He elaborated: &quot;I compose by first developing an overall sense of the length of the work, then of how it will divide itself into sections or movements, then of the kind of texture or instruments or voices that will be performing it. I prefer not to consider the actual notes of the composition until this process ... has gone as far as possible&quot;. Sometimes the time required to see a project through from conception to completion was very long—seven years, Tippett said, in the case of the Third Symphony. In the earlier, contemplative stages he might be simultaneously engaged on other works, but once these stages were complete he would dedicate himself entirely to the completion of the work in hand.

Tippett preferred to compose in full score; once the writing began, progress was often not fluent, as evidenced by Tippett&#x27;s first pencil draft manuscripts, which show multiple rubbings-out and reworkings. In this, the musicologist Thomas Schuttenhelm says, his methods resembled those of Beethoven, with the difference that &quot;whereas Beethoven&#x27;s struggle is considered a virtue of his work, and almost universally admired, Tippett&#x27;s was the source and subject of a debate about his competency as a composer&quot;.

===Influences===

The style that emerged from Tippett&#x27;s long compositional apprenticeship was the product of many diverse influences. Beethoven and Handel were initial models (Handel above Bach, who in Tippett&#x27;s view lacked drama), supplemented by 16th- and 17th-century masters of counterpoint and madrigal—Thomas Weelkes, Monteverdi and Dowland. Purcell became significant later, and Tippett came to lament his ignorance of Purcell during his RCM years: &quot;It seems to me incomprehensible now that his work was not even recommended in composition lessons as a basic study for the setting of English&quot;.

Tippett recognised the importance to his compositional development of several 19th- and 20th-century composers: Berlioz for his clear melodic lines, Debussy for his inventive sound, Bartók for his colourful dissonance, Hindemith for his skills at counterpoint, and Sibelius for his originality in musical forms. He revered Stravinsky, sharing the Russian composer&#x27;s deep interest in older music. Tippett had heard early ragtime as a small child before the First World War; he noted in his later writings that, in the early years of the 20th century, ragtime and jazz &quot;attracted many serious composers thinking to find ... a means to refresh serious music by the primitive&quot;. His interest in these forms led to his fascination with blues, articulated in several of his later works. Among his contemporary composers, Tippett admired Britten and shared his desire to end the perception of English music as provincial. He also had a high regard for Alan Bush, with whom he joined forces to produce the 1934 Pageant of Labour. &quot;I can remember the excitement I felt when he outlined to me his plan for a major string quartet&quot;.

Although influences of folk music from all parts of the British Isles are evident in Tippett&#x27;s early works, he was wary of the English folksong revival of the early 20th century, believing that much of the music presented as &quot;English&quot; by Cecil Sharp and his followers originated elsewhere. Notwithstanding his doubts, Tippett took some inspiration from these sources. The composer David Matthews writes of passages in Tippett&#x27;s music which &quot;evoke the &#x27;sweet especial rural scene&#x27; as vividly as Elgar or Vaughan Williams ... perhaps redolent of the Suffolk landscape with its gently undulating horizons, wide skies and soft lights&quot;.

===Works===
After the withdrawn works of the 1920s and early 1930s, analysts generally divide Tippett&#x27;s mature compositional career into three main phases, with fairly fluid boundaries and some internal subdivision in each. The first phase extends from the completion of the String Quartet No. 1 in 1935 to the end of the 1950s, a period in which Tippett drew on the past for his main inspiration. The 1960s marked the beginning of a new phase in which Tippett&#x27;s style became more experimental, reflecting both the social and cultural changes of that era and the broadening of his own experiences. The mid-1970s produced a further stylistic change, less marked and sudden than that of the early 1960s, after which what Clarke calls the &quot;extremes&quot; of the experimental phase were gradually replaced by a return to the lyricism characteristic of the first period, a trend that was particularly manifested in the final works.

====Withdrawn compositions====

Tippett&#x27;s earliest compositions cover several genres. Kemp writes that the works indicate Tippett&#x27;s deep commitment to learning his craft, his early ability to manipulate traditional forms, and a general willingness to experiment. Clarke observes that in these youthful efforts, characteristics of his mature work are already discernible. Some of the early work is of high quality—the Symphony in B flat of 1933 was, in Kemp&#x27;s view, comparable to William Walton&#x27;s contemporaneous First Symphony. Tippett pondered for years whether to include this work in his formal canon before deciding that its debt to Sibelius was too great. Nevertheless, it foreshadows techniques that feature in the String Quartet No. 1 and in the &quot;Corelli Fantasia&quot;.

Other accomplished early works include the two string quartets, composed between 1928 and 1930, in which Tippett sought to combine the styles of Beethoven and Haydn respectively with folk-song, as Beethoven had in his Rasoumovsky quartets of 1806. Tippett explains the withdrawal of these and the other early works: &quot;I realised very clearly that they were not totally consonant with myself. I didn&#x27;t think they had the stamp of artistic durability. So I took the whole lot along to R.O. Morris who agreed that they didn&#x27;t show enough technical mastery.&quot;

====First period: 1935 to late 1950s====
Kemp identifies the String Quartet No. 1 (1935) as marking Tippett&#x27;s discovery of his individual voice. According to the composer Alan Ridout, the work stamped its character on Tippett&#x27;s first period, and together with the second and third quartets of 1942 and 1946 it typifies his style up to &quot;The Midsummer Marriage&quot;. In the two works that immediately followed the first quartet, Bowen finds the Piano Sonata No. 1 (1938) full of the young composer&#x27;s inventiveness, while Matthews writes of the Concerto for Double String Orchestra (1939): &quot;[I]t is the rhythmic freedom of the music, its joyful liberation from orthodox notions of stress and phrase length, that contributes so much to its vitality&quot;. Both of these works show influence of folk music, and the finale of the Piano Sonata is marked by innovative jazz syncopations. According to Schuttenhelm, the Double Concerto marks the proper beginning of Tippett&#x27;s maturity as an orchestral composer.
In &quot;A Child of Our Time&quot; Tippett was, in Kemp&#x27;s view, wholly successful in integrating the language of the spirituals with his own musical style. Tippett had obtained recordings of American singing groups, especially the Hall Johnson Choir, which provided him with a model for determining the relationships between solo voices and chorus in the spirituals. Thus, Kemp believes, the fourth spiritual &quot;O by and by&quot; sounds almost as if it had been composed by Tippett. The composer&#x27;s instructions in the score specify that &quot;the spirituals should not be thought of as congregational hymns, but as integral parts of the Oratorio; nor should they be sentimentalised but sung with a strong underlying beat and slightly &#x27;swung.

In Tippett&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 (1945), his only large-scale work between &quot;A Child of Our Time&quot; and &quot;The Midsummer Marriage&quot;, his &quot;gift for launching a confident flow of sharply characterized, contrapuntally combined ideas&quot; is acknowledged by Whittall. The same critic found the symphony&#x27;s quality uneven, and the orchestral writing weaker than in the Double Concerto. Whittall offers nearly unqualified praise for &quot;The Midsummer Marriage&quot;, a view largely echoed by Mellers, who saw the perceived &quot;difficulty&quot; of the music as &quot;an aspect of its truth&quot;. He considered the opera one of the best musical-theatrical works of its era.

Three major works of the 1950s round off Tippett&#x27;s first period: the Corelli &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1953), in which Clarke sees, in the &quot;alla pastorale&quot; section, the composer&#x27;s instrumental writing at its best; the mildly controversial Piano Concerto (1955), which Whittall regards as one of the composer&#x27;s most intriguing works—an attempt to &quot;make the piano sing&quot;; and the Symphony No. 2 (1957) which Tippett acknowledges as a turning-point in his music. Until this point, says Matthews, Tippett&#x27;s style had remained broadly tonal. The Second Symphony was his first essay in polytonality, paving the way to the dissonance and chromaticism of subsequent works. Milner, too, recognises the pivotal position of this symphony in Tippett&#x27;s development which, he says, both sums up the style of the late 1950s and presages the changes to come.

====Second period: &quot;King Priam&quot; to 1976====

In his analysis of &quot;King Priam&quot;, Bowen argues that the change in Tippett&#x27;s musical style arose initially from the nature of the opera, a tragedy radically different in tone from the warm optimism of &quot;The Midsummer Marriage&quot;. Clarke sees the change as something more fundamental, the increases in dissonance and atonality in &quot;Priam&quot; being representative of a trend that continued and reached a climax of astringency a few years later in Tippett&#x27;s third opera, &quot;The Knot Garden&quot;. Tippett&#x27;s new modernistic language, writes Clarke, was rooted in his desire to represent a wider range of human experiences, characteristic of a changing world: &quot;War, violence, sex, homoeroticism, and social and interpersonal alienation [would now feature] much more overtly in [his] dramatic works or works with text&quot;. Critics acknowledged &quot;Priam&quot; as a considerable achievement, but received the new musical style cautiously. Gloag did not think the change an absolute departure from Tippett&#x27;s earlier style, but Milner viewed &quot;King Priam&quot; as a complete break with Tippett&#x27;s previous work, pointing out the lack of counterpoint, the considerably increased dissonances, and the move towards atonality: &quot;very little of the music is in a definite key&quot;.

Many of the minor works that Tippett wrote in the wake of &quot;King Priam&quot; reflect the musical style of the opera, in some cases quoting directly from it. In the first purely instrumental post-&quot;Priam&quot; work, the Piano Sonata No. 2 (1962), Milner thought the new style worked better in the theatre than in the concert or recital hall, although he found the music in the Concerto for Orchestra (1963) had matured into a form that fully justified the earlier experiments. The critic Tim Souster refers to Tippett&#x27;s &quot;new, hard, sparse instrumental style&quot; evident in &quot;The Vision of Saint Augustine&quot; (1965), written for baritone soloist, chorus and orchestra, a work Bowen considers one of the peaks of Tippett&#x27;s career.

During the late 1960s Tippett worked on a series of compositions that reflected the influence of his American experiences after 1965: &quot;The Shires Suite&quot; (1970), &quot;The Knot Garden&quot; (1970) and the Symphony No. 3 (1972). In &quot;The Knot Garden&quot; Mellers discerns Tippett&#x27;s &quot;wonderfully acute&quot; ear only intermittently, otherwise: &quot;thirty years on, the piece still sounds and looks knotty indeed, exhausting alike to participants and audience&quot;. The Third Symphony is overtly linked by Tippett to Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony through a vocal finale of four blues songs, introduced by a direct quotation from Beethoven&#x27;s finale. Tippett&#x27;s intention, explained by the music critic Calum MacDonald, was to explore the contemporary relevance of the grand, universal sentiments in Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;, as set by Beethoven. Tippett&#x27;s conclusion is that while the need to rejoice remains, the 20th century has put paid to the Romantic ideals of universality and certainty.

After completing his Piano Sonata No. 3 (1973), &quot;a formidable piece of abstract composition&quot; according to Bowen, Tippett returned to the modern vernacular in his fourth opera, &quot;The Ice Break&quot; (1976). Describing the music in an introduction to the published libretto, Tippett identifies &quot;two archetypal sounds: one relating to the frightening but exhilarating sound of the ice breaking on the great northern rivers in the spring; the other related to the exciting or terrifying sound of the slogan-shouting crowds, which can lift you on your shoulders in triumph, or stamp you to death&quot;. The work was generally regarded as a critical and public failure, but aspects of its music have been recognised as among Tippett&#x27;s best. The critic John Warrack writes that, after the violence of the opening acts, the third act&#x27;s music has a lyrical warmth comparable to that of &quot;The Midsummer Marriage&quot;&quot;. William Mann in &quot;The Times&quot; was equally enthusiastic, finding the music compelling and worthy of many a rehearing.

====Third period: 1977 to 1995====
In the late 1970s Tippett produced three single-movement instrumental works: the Symphony No. 4 (1977), the String Quartet No. 4 (1978), and the Triple Concerto for violin, viola and cello (1979). The symphony, written in the manner of the tone poem or symphonic fantasia exemplified by Sibelius, represents what Tippett describes as a birth-to-death cycle, beginning and ending with the sounds of breathing. This effect was initially provided by a wind machine, although other means have been tried, with mixed results—according to Bowen &quot;the sounds emitted can turn out to be redolent of a space-fiction film or a bordello&quot;. The Fourth String Quartet, Tippett explains, is an exercise in &quot;finding a sound&quot; that he first encountered in the incidental music to a television programme on Rembrandt. In the Triple Concerto, which is thematically related to the Fourth Quartet and quotes from it, the three solo instruments perform individually rather than as a formal grouping. The work acknowledges Tippett&#x27;s past with quotations from &quot;The Midsummer Marriage&quot;.
Tippett described the longest and most ambitious of his late works, the oratorio &quot;The Mask of Time&quot; (1982), as &quot;a pageant of sorts with an ultimately lofty message&quot;. Mellers called the work &quot;a mind-boggling cosmic history of the universe&quot;. Paul Driver, who had been a critic of Tippett&#x27;s new style, wrote that the &quot;Mask&quot; revealed &quot;the authentic early Tippett&quot;, with a return to the lyricism of &quot;The Midsummer Marriage&quot; and multiple acknowledgements of his early compositions.

Tippett had intended &quot;The Ice Break&quot; to be his final opera, but in 1985 he began work on &quot;New Year&quot;. Bowen saw this work as a summary of ideas and images that had attracted Tippett throughout his working life. Donal Henahan was dismissive of the music: &quot;the score generally natters along in the numbing, not-quite-atonal but antimelodic style familiar from other Tippett works.&quot; In &quot;Byzantium&quot; (1990), Tippett set the five stanzas of W. B. Yeats&#x27;s poem, with added orchestral interludes. By this time he was professing little interest in his own work beyond its creation; performance and reception had become irrelevant to him. In 1996 he told an interviewer: &quot;I&#x27;m outside the music I&#x27;ve made, I have no interest in it&quot;. After the String Quartet No. 5 (1991), which connects thematically with earlier works, Tippett closed his main output with &quot;The Rose Lake&quot; (1993), described in Tippett&#x27;s &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; obituary as &quot;of luminous beauty ... a worthy ending to a remarkable career&quot;.

==Reputation and legacy==

In a joint study of Tippett and Britten published in 1982, Whittall designated the pair as &quot;the two best British composers of that ... generation born between 1900 and the outbreak of the First World War, and among the best of all composers born in the first two decades of the twentieth century&quot;. After Britten&#x27;s death in 1976, Tippett became widely regarded as the doyen of British music, but critical opinion of his later works was not always favorable. After the first performance of the Triple Concerto in 1980, Driver wrote that &quot;not since &quot;The Knot Garden&quot; has [he] produced anything worthy of his early masterpieces&quot;.

In 1982, in his comparative study of Britten and Tippett, Whittall asserted that &quot;it would be difficult to claim that any of the works [Tippett] has begun in his seventies are the equal of earlier compositions&quot;. Although both Driver and Whittall later modified their opinions, such comments represented a general view among critics that Tippett&#x27;s creative powers had begun to decline after the triumph of &quot;King Priam&quot;. This perception was strongly expressed by Derek Puffett, who argued that the decline followed Tippett&#x27;s abandonment of myth—seen as the key to the success of &quot;The Midsummer Marriage&quot; and &quot;King Priam&quot;—and stemmed from his increasingly futile efforts to universalise his private agonies and express them musically. Despite his admiration for the early works, Puffett consigned Tippett &quot;to the ranks of those noble but tragic composers who have lived beyond their time&quot;. The critic Norman Lebrecht, writing in 2005, dismissed almost all Tippett&#x27;s output, labelling him &quot;a composer to forget&quot;. With the forthcoming centenary celebrations in mind, Lebrecht wrote: &quot;I cannot begin to assess the damage to British music that will ensue from the coming year&#x27;s purblind promotion of a composer who failed so insistently to observe the rules of his craft&quot;.

Against these criticisms Kemp maintained that while the style had become less immediately accessible, Tippett&#x27;s later works showed no loss of creative power. The critic Peter Wright, writing in 1999, challenged the &quot;decline&quot; theory with the view that the later compositions are &quot;harder to come to terms with ... because of the more challenging nature of their musical language&quot;, a theme he developed in a detailed study of the Fifth String Quartet.

After Tippett&#x27;s death the more popular pieces from his first period continued to be played, but there was little public enthusiasm for the later works. After the relatively muted 2005 centenary celebrations, performances and recordings tailed off. In October 2012 Hewett wrote in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; of a &quot;calamitous fall&quot; in Tippett&#x27;s reputation since his death. Geraint Lewis acknowledges that &quot;no consensus yet exists in respect of the works composed from the 1960s onwards&quot;, while forecasting that Tippett will in due course be recognised as one of the most original and powerful musical voices of twentieth-century Britain&quot;.

Many of Tippett&#x27;s articles and broadcast talks were issued in collections between 1959 and 1995. In 1991 he published an episodic autobiography, &quot;Those Twentieth Century Blues&quot;, notable for its frank discussions of personal issues and relationships. Collectively, Tippett&#x27;s writings define his aesthetic standpoint, which Clarke summarises thus: &quot;Tippett holds that art&#x27;s role in post-Enlightenment culture is to offer a corrective to society&#x27;s spiritually injurious domination by mass technology. Art, he suggests, can articulate areas of human experience, unapproachable through scientific rationality, by presenting &#x27;images&#x27; of the inner world of the psyche.&quot;

Although Tippett did not found a compositional school, composers who have acknowledged his influence include David Matthews and William Mathias. More generally, his musical and educational influence continues through the Michael Tippett Foundation. He is also commemorated in the Michael Tippett Centre, a concert venue within the Newton Park campus of Bath Spa University. In Lambeth, home of Morley College, is Heron Academy (previously named The Michael Tippett School), an educational facility for young people aged 11–19 with complex learning disabilities. Within the school&#x27;s campus is the Tippett Music Centre, which offers music education for children of all ages and levels of ability.

<doc id="147164" wikidata="Q2272638" url="?curid=147164" title="Goldbach's weak conjecture">
<text>In number theory, Goldbach&#x27;s weak conjecture, also known as the odd Goldbach conjecture, the ternary Goldbach problem, or the 3-primes problem, states that

: Every odd number greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of three primes. (A prime may be used more than once in the same sum.)

This conjecture is called &quot;weak&quot; because if Goldbach&#x27;s &quot;strong&quot; conjecture (concerning sums of two primes) is proven, then this would also be true. For if every even number greater than 4 is the sum of two odd primes, adding 3 to each even number greater than 4 will produce the odd numbers greater than 7 (and 7 itself is equal to 2+2+3).

In 2013, Harald Helfgott released a proof of Goldbach&#x27;s weak conjecture. The proof was accepted for publication in the &quot;Annals of Mathematics Studies&quot; series in 2015, and has been undergoing further review and revision since; fully-refereed chapters in close to final form are being made public in the process.

Some state the conjecture as
:Every odd number greater than 7 can be expressed as the sum of three odd primes.
This version excludes 7 = 2+2+3 because this requires the even prime 2. On odd numbers larger than 7 it is slightly stronger as it also excludes sums like 17 = 2+2+13, which are allowed in the other formulation. Helfgott&#x27;s proof covers both versions of the conjecture. Like the other formulation, this one also immediately follows from Goldbach&#x27;s strong conjecture.

==Origins==
The conjecture originated in correspondence between Christian Goldbach and Leonhard Euler. One formulation of the strong Goldbach conjecture, equivalent to the more common one in terms of sums of two primes, is 
:Every integer greater than 5 can be written as the sum of three primes.

The weak conjecture is simply this statement restricted to the case where the integer is odd (and possibly with the added requirement that the three primes in the sum be odd).

==Timeline of results==
In 1923, Hardy and Littlewood showed that, assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis, the weak Goldbach conjecture is true for all sufficiently large odd numbers. In 1937, Ivan Matveevich Vinogradov eliminated the dependency on the generalised Riemann hypothesis and proved directly (see Vinogradov&#x27;s theorem) that all sufficiently large odd numbers can be expressed as the sum of three primes. Vinogradov&#x27;s original proof, as it used the ineffective Siegel–Walfisz theorem, did not give a bound for &quot;sufficiently large&quot;; his student K. Borozdkin (1956) derived that formula_1 is large enough. The integer part of this number has 4,008,660 decimal digits, so checking every number under this figure would be completely infeasible.

In 1997, Deshouillers, Effinger, te Riele and Zinoviev published a result showing that the generalized Riemann hypothesis implies Goldbach&#x27;s weak conjecture for all numbers. This result combines a general statement valid for numbers greater than 1020 with an extensive computer search of the small cases. Saouter also conducted a computer search covering the same cases at approximately the same time.

Olivier Ramaré in 1995 showed that every even number &quot;n&quot; ≥ 4 is in fact the sum of at most six primes, from which it follows that every odd number &quot;n&quot; ≥ 5 is the sum of at most seven primes. Leszek Kaniecki showed every odd integer is a sum of at most five primes, under the Riemann Hypothesis. In 2012, Terence Tao proved this without the Riemann Hypothesis; this improves both results.

In 2002, Liu Ming-Chit (University of Hong Kong) and Wang Tian-Ze lowered Borozdkin&#x27;s threshold to approximately formula_2. The exponent is still much too large to admit checking all smaller numbers by computer. (Computer searches have only reached as far as 1018 for the strong Goldbach conjecture, and not much further than that for the weak Goldbach conjecture.)

In 2012 and 2013, Peruvian mathematician Harald Helfgott released a pair of papers improving major and minor arc estimates sufficiently to unconditionally prove the weak Goldbach conjecture. Here, the major arcs formula_3 is the union of intervals formula_4 around the rationals formula_5 where formula_6 is a constant. Minor arcs formula_7 are defined to be formula_8.

<text>Tasmin Elizabeth Little (born 13 May 1965) is an English classical violinist. She is a concerto soloist and also performs as a recitalist and chamber musician. She has released numerous albums, winning the Critics Award at the Classic Brit Awards in 2011 for her recording of Elgar&#x27;s Violin Concerto.

==Early life and education==
Little was born in London and is the daughter of Bradford-born actor George Little, best known for his role in &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot;. She first learned to read music at age six while learning to play a recorder that her mother had given her. She grew up in northwest London, attending the Yehudi Menuhin School on a scholarship as a weekly boarder between the ages of 8 and 18; among her fellow pupils was violinist Nigel Kennedy.

In 1982 she was a finalist in the string section of &quot;BBC Young Musician of the Year&quot;. After leaving school she went on to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, where she obtained a Performance Diploma and won the Gold Medal in the school&#x27;s annual music competition in 1986.

She is known for her presence at the Menuhin Competition for Young Violinists, both as a competitor in its early days and as a member of the competition jury in recent years. She was the third prize winner in the Senior Division at the inaugural 1983 competition in Folkestone, after which she earned second prize at the following competition in 1985. 

==Career==
Little&#x27;s first professional performance as a soloist was in 1988 with The Hallé. She made her first appearance at the BBC Proms in 1990, and has appeared regularly since. Over the course of her career Little has performed with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the New York Philharmonic and other major orchestras, and has released over 20 albums.
Little has been an exponent of the works of composer Frederick Delius throughout her career, and was the artistic director of &quot;Delius Inspired&quot;, an eight-day festival held in Bradford in July 2006 celebrating his work which was broadcast on BBC Radio 3. She has also made a documentary about Delius for BBC Two.

In 2008 Little released a three-track recording, &quot;The Naked Violin&quot;, as a free download from her website in a move aimed at making classical music more accessible. The recording featured Bach&#x27;s Partita No. 3 in E major, Eugène Ysaÿe&#x27;s Sonata No.3 in D minor, and &quot;Luslawice&quot; by Paul Patterson, all performed unaccompanied. The project won the 2008 &quot;Gramophone&quot;/Classic FM Award for Audience Innovation, and was featured in an episode of &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;.

Little received an honorary doctorate from the University of Bradford in 1996, and the University&#x27;s music school, the Tasmin Little Music Centre, is named after her. In 2009 she received a British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors Gold Badge Award, and in 2011 her album &quot;Elgar: Violin Concerto&quot; won the Critics Award at the Classic Brit Awards. She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to music.

On 24 January 2020, Little announced her retirement from the concert platform for the summer of 2020, which was deferred to the end of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2023 Birthday Honours for services to music.

<text>Kanaloa kahoolawensis, the Ka palupalu o Kanaloa or kohe malama malama o kanaloa, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae and is endemic to Hawaii. &quot;Kanaloa&quot; is a monotypic genus with the single species Kanaloa kahoolawensis.

==History==
&quot;Kanaloa&quot; was discovered in 1992 by the botanists Ken Wood and Steve Perlman of the National Tropical Botanical Garden on Kahoolawe, a small island that was formerly used as a bombing range. Kahoolawe was a penal colony for the Hawaiian monarchy from 1826 to 1853, after which it was leased for ranching. Dry weather and ranching have devastated the island&#x27;s vegetation. Only two wild plants of &quot;Kanaloa kahoolawensis&quot; have been observed growing on the island. The genus and species were formally named by Lorence and Wood in 1994. The genus name honors the Hawaiian deity Kanaloa, who according to legend used the island to rest and regain his energies. Scholars and native Hawaiian activists both agree that Kanaloa is from the original name &quot;Kohemalamalama O Kanaloa&quot;., which translates as the place or womb for the resuscitation of Kanaloa. According to Lorence &amp; Wood (1994), Kanaloa means, &quot;secure, firm, immovable, established, unconquerable...Such attributes are certainly essential for this plant to have survived in spite of the severe degradation of the island&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;kahoolawensis&quot; is from the island Kahoolawe where the first species was discovered.

==Habitat and range==
Only two plants have ever been found in the wild. The single remaining plant grows on the cliffs of Aleale Puuloae on a sea stack off the coast of the Kahoolawe. Soils are oxisols derived from basaltic lavas at an elevation of 45–60 m. It is possible that the range of this species previously included other Hawaiian islands; fossilized pollen from plants likely to be in the same genus has been found in core samples taken from sinkholes in Oahu&#x27;s Ewa Plain, Maui, and Kauai&#x27;s Makauwahi Cave. Whether the pollen grains in the samples belong to &quot;K. kahoolawensis&quot; cannot be determined. As Kahoolawe was united with Maui and other islands prehistorically (&quot;see also&quot; Maui Nui), it is entirely possible that the pollen belongs to &quot;K. kahoolawensis&quot;. On the other hand, it may also be that the Oahu population remains represent another, extinct, species - possibly an ancestor of &quot;K. kahoolawensis&quot; -, judging from the biogeography of Hawaiian land plants.

==Description==
&quot;Kanaloa kahoolawensis&quot; is an unarmed shrub reaching 0.75–1 m in height. Branches are dense, decumbent and measure 0.75-1.5 m long. New growth is densely brown hirtellous-villosulous with straight and curly, white and brown simple trichomes 0.1-0.3 mm long. Stipules free, paired, ovate, villosulous, 1.5–2 mm x 1.2-1.5 mm. Leaves alternate, bipinnately compound with one pair of pinnae, each pinna bears 3 leaflets, a terminal pair and a single proximal leaflet on the abaxial side, leaflets nearly sessile, pulvinus &lt;1 mm, ovate to elliptic, asymmetrical, 2.7-4.2 cm x 1.4-3.2 cm, venation reticulate, leaflet margin entire. Tendrils absent. The inflorescence is a globose capitulum, 7.0-8.5 mm in diameter, peduncle 2.7-4.5 cm, flowers white, 20-54 per head, subtended by persistent peltate bracts, mostly unisexual, male, a few with very reduced sterile stigmas &lt;0.5 mm, hermaphroditic flowers not seen. Sepals pubescent, connate, calyx obconic, 2-2.5 mm, 5 lobed. Petals 5, free, 2.0–3 mm, oblanceolate, inflexed, pubescent, extremely hirtellous apically, midvein conspicuous. Stamens 10, distinct, anthers dorsifixed 0.6-1.0 mm, filaments 2-4.5 mm. Pollen in monads, tricolporate. Fruits stipitate, stipe 4–5 mm long, as many as 4 per capitulum, inertly dehiscent along both margins, obovate or subcircular, 2.4-3.2 x 2-2.3 cm. Each fruit contains a single seed

==Phylogeny==
Based on molecular phylogenetic studies, &quot;Kanaloa&quot; is closely related to &quot;Schleinitzia&quot; and &quot;Desmanthus&quot;. Shared features include: lack of spines or prickles, presence of sessile petiolar glands, petals free to the base, and inflorescence a capitulum. &quot;Kanaloa&quot; differs from &quot;Schleinitzia&quot; in lacking glands at the apex of the anthers and having simple rather than compound pollen grains. Fruits are dehiscent along the sutures in &quot;Kanaloa&quot;; in &quot;Schleinitzia&quot; the sutural ribs separate from the valves forming a craspedium similar to that in &quot;Mimosa&quot;. &quot;Kanaloa&quot; is most closely related to &quot;Desmanthus&quot;, sharing peltate floral bracts and inertly dehiscent fruits. &quot;Kanaloa&quot; differs from &quot;Desmanthus&quot; in having 3 leaflets per pinna and cordiform seeds.

==Conservation==
Other than preserving the wild plants, efforts have been put into establishing ex-situ stocks (in a nursery or arboretum), and increasing plant populations with a minimum of 25 individuals. Fences have been built to protect the single wild plant from grazing and trampling by introduced mammals. The plants are inspected regularly for insect damage and disease. Another plant that was grown from seed is currently kept in the National Tropical Botanical Garden’s McBryde Garden on Kauai, Hawaii.

<text>Constantin-Nicolae Silvestri (; 31 May 1913, Bucharest – 23 February 1969, London) was a Romanian conductor and composer.

==Early life==
Silvestri, born of Austro-Italian-Romanian stock, was brought up mostly by his mother, his father dying from alcoholism, and his stepfather dying when the boy was 16. He had learnt how to play the piano and organ before the age of six. He played the piano in public at 10 and was a skilled improviser. He studied at the Târgu Mureş Conservatoire, and later at the Bucharest Conservatoire. His teachers in Bucharest included Mihail Jora (composition) and Florica Musicescu (piano). Despite not having taken conducting classes, he was already appearing as conductor in his teens, making his debut in 1930 with the Bucharest Radio Symphony Orchestra in a concert which included &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; and his own composition &quot;Prelude and Fugue (Toccata)&quot;.

==Career==
Silvestri&#x27;s success in this 1930 National Radio Orchestra of Romania concert persuaded him to follow conducting as a career. He conducted at the Romanian National Opera from 1935 on, and, following the brief tenures of two caretakers, he also directed the Bucharest Philharmonic Orchestra for six years as successor to George Georgescu, in disgrace as a Nazi collaborator. Georgescu, ironically, assumed directorship of the Radio Orchestra; following Silvestri&#x27;s emigration to the West, Georgescu would resume his place at the head of the Philharmonic, shortly thereafter renamed the George Enescu Philharmonic. From 1948 to 1956, Silvestri taught at the Bucharest Conservatoire (Conservatorul din București), where he founded its Conducting Department. Among Silvestri&#x27;s students were Sergiu Comissiona, Marius Constant, Anatol Vieru, Iosif Conta, Edgar Cosma. By the 1950s Silvestri was accepting guest engagements in the USSR, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. His career in Romania came to a climax in 1958 with the highly successful Romanian premiere of &quot;Oedipe&quot; in Bucharest.

After leaving his home country Silvestri made Paris his domicile in 1959, also travelling to Australia that year, and appearing with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Philadelphia Orchestra in 1960–61, and making a number of recordings in Paris, London and Vienna for EMI.

Having made his UK début with the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1957 at the Royal Albert Hall, Silvestri defected to Great Britain in 1961 and assumed the post of Principal Conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. He raised the standard and prestige of the orchestra to one of international standing. He was demanding and meticulous in rehearsal, his scores marked in different colours; however, his performances often differed from one concert to the next.

Silvestri made his debut at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden with &quot;Khovanshchina&quot; in the Shostakovich version (in an English translation by Edward Downes) in June 1963.

He became a British citizen in 1967 shortly before his growing reputation was cut short by increasing ill health, and he died of cancer at the age of 55. His last concert was in Exeter on 29 November 1968, and he is buried at St Peter&#x27;s Church in Bournemouth. 
Biographies are available on Silvestri, by Eugen Pricope, John Gritten and Ioana Raluca Voicu-Arnăuţoiu. King&#x27;s College London holds a substantial documentary archive of his life and work.

==Recording==
In Romania and Eastern Europe, before moving to the West, Silvestri made around 20 LPs, often of repertoire he did not subsequently re-record.

Recordings for which he is particularly well known include Edward Elgar&#x27;s Overture &quot;In the South (Alassio)&quot;, and Tchaikovsky&#x27;s 5th symphony. His recordings received a First Prize from the Académie Charles Cros (for Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No.9, &quot;From the New World&quot;&quot;) and the Grand Prix du Disque (for George Enescu&#x27;s &quot;Dixtuor for Winds&quot;).

Silvestri conducted and recorded with many of the world&#x27;s leading orchestras, such as the Berlin Philharmonic, Philharmonia, Concertgebouw, Paris Conservatoire Orchestra, Suisse Romande, Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.

In addition to commercial recordings, the BBC Legends label has issued six CDs of radio performances from the 1960s with Silvestri conducting the Bournemouth orchestra. In 2013, EMI re-issued most of his recordings with that company in a 15-disc set in which one reviewer noted the performances&#x27; &quot;consistent character and quality&quot;; alongside Tchaikovsky&#x27;s symphonies 4-6 and Manfred, there was much other Russian music, Dvořák symphonies 7-9, and works by Bartok, Hindemith, Berlioz, Franck, Ravel and Debussy.

Video and audio rarities with excerpts from Silvestri&#x27;s concerts, rehearsals, live and studio recordings are featured in Anda Anastasescu Gritten&#x27;s film series &#x27;CONSTANTIN SILVESTRI: Avant-gardist, Master improviser, Homme passionné&#x27; (7 episodes: Prelude, Lead soldiers, The little shepherd, Fireworks, Pictures at an exhibition, Nocturne, Bacchanalia). In the films, Silvestri conducts the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, the ORTF Orchestra, the Bucharest Philharmonic, the Romanian National Radio Symphony Orchestra and the orchestra of the Romanian National Opera. 

On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of Silvestri’s death and after 19 years of campaigning to revive his memory, pianist Anda Anastasescu and journalist John Gritten produced a 2-CD set for the RMA label (Romanian Musical Adventure) with Silvestri conducting the Bournemouth orchestra. The album has an unusual history: many of the concerts conducted by Silvestri in Britain were broadcast by the BBC. Lack of archive space led to the destruction of the master tapes of the majority of these broadcasts but Silvestri had recorded many concerts and 350 reel-to-reel tapes were given to the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra archive by his widow. A chance re-discovery of the tapes by the orchestra’s librarian led to the involvement of Raymond Carpenter, the orchestra’s principal clarinettist during his leadership and the BSO’s and Silvestri’s archivist. The set contains works broadcast by the BBC in the 1960s from Bournemouth and Bristol: Silvestri&#x27;s own &#x27;Three Pieces for Strings&#x27;, Enescu&#x27;s Symphony No. 1, First and Second Orchestral Suites, Mozart&#x27;s Magic Flute Overture, Prokofiev&#x27;s Symphony No. 1 and Dvorak&#x27;s Slavonic Dances.

==Compositions==
Silvestri also composed over 40 orchestral, chamber and vocal works. These include &quot;Prelude and Fugue (Toccata)&quot;, Sonata quasi una fantasia, Op 19, No 2 (1940), Chants Nostalgiques, Op 27, No 1 (1944), String Quartet, Op 27, No 2 (1944), Sonata for solo harp, Three Pieces for Strings, Op 4, No 2 (1933), and Romanian Dances from Transylvania, Op 4, No 1 (1930). 

The UK premières of the following works were given by pianist Anda Anastasescu in the Wigmore Hall, London; Piano Suite &#x27;Children&#x27;s Games&#x27; No. 2 (Op. 3 No. 2) on 14 July 2003, Sonata Op. 28 No. 1 &#x27;Rapsodia in 3 episodi&#x27; on 28 December 2004 and Sonata Op. 19 No. 2 &#x27;Quasi una fantasia&#x27; and &#x27;Chants nostalgiques&#x27; Op. 27 No. 1 on 30 December 2005. The UK Première of Piano Suite &#x27;Children Games&#x27; No. 1 (Op. 3 No. 1) was given by Anda Anastasescu in the Purcell Room, London, on 15 December 1999 as part of the series &#x27;Bridging the Millenia with Four Anniversaries. Hommage to Silvestri, Shostakovich, Copland and Turina&#x27; 1999–2000. 

The UK Première of the Sonata for Clarinet and Piano Op. 19 No. 1 was given by Raymond Carpenter (Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra Principal Clarinet) and Anda Anastasescu in the Purcell Room, South Bank Centre London, 15 December 1999.
The UK Première of the &#x27;Romanian dances from Transylvania&#x27; Op.4 No.1 (Bihor Dances) for piano 4 hands, was given by pianists Anda Anastasescu and Alberto Portugheis in Kings Place, London, on 4 July 2010. 

The Piano Suites Nos. 1, 2, 3 are featured in Anastasescu&#x27;s film series &#x27;CONSTANTIN SILVESTRI: Avant-gardist, Master improviser, Homme passionné&#x27; (7 episodes: Prelude, Lead soldiers, The little shepherd, Fireworks, Pictures at an exhibition, Nocturne, Bacchanalia), dedicated to the 2021 George Enescu International Festival, Bucharest. Anastasescu recorded the three piano suites for the &#x27;Patrimoniu&#x27; archives of the Romanian National Radio in November/December 2019.
On 19 March 2005, The London Schubert Players Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Hu Kun, gave the public UK Première of the &#x27;Three pieces for strings&#x27; in the &#x27;Classicalive Festival&#x27; in the Olympia Exhibition Centre, London. A second London performance took place in the Romanian Cultural Institute on 15 November 2005 as part of Anastasescu&#x27;s festival &#x27;A Romanian Musical Adventure&#x27; 2005-2006, the first-ever British festival of Romanian composers. The work had been previously performed on 29 April 2004 in the Romanian Embassy in London by the &#x27;George Enescu Youth Orchestra&#x27; (the orchestra of the George Enescu Music School in Bucharest) conducted by Bogdan Voda. The concert was part of a concert tour in the UK, organised by Anda Anastasescu who is an alumna.

The first commercially released CD with the ‘Three Pieces for Strings’ (‘A World of Music with the London Schubert Players’) produced by Cressidia Classics in the UK in 1996 was recorded in 1990 in Bucharest’s Athenaeum concert hall by the Romanian record company ‘Electrecord’.

<doc id="147174" wikidata="Q58645" url="?curid=147174" title="Robert Ley">
<text>Robert Ley (; 15 February 1890 – 25 October 1945) was a German politician during the Nazi era, who headed the German Labour Front during its entire existence, from 1933 to 1945. He also held many other high positions in the German Nazi Party, including , and . He died by suicide in 1945 while awaiting trial at Nuremberg for crimes against humanity and war crimes.

==Early life==
Ley was born in Niederbreidenbach (now a part of Nümbrecht) in the Rhine Province, the seventh of 11 children of a farmer, Friedrich Ley, and his wife Emilie (née Wald). He studied chemistry at the universities of Jena, Bonn, and Münster. He volunteered for the army on the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and spent two years in the 10th Foot Artillery Regiment and saw action on both the eastern and western fronts. In 1916 he was promoted to and trained as an aerial artillery spotter with Artillery Flier Detachment 202. In July 1917 his aircraft was shot down over France and he was taken prisoner of war. It has been suggested that he suffered a traumatic brain injury in the crash; for the rest of his life he spoke with a stammer and suffered bouts of erratic behaviour, aggravated by heavy drinking. He earned the Iron Cross, 2nd class and the Wound Badge, in silver.

After the war Ley was released from captivity in January 1920 and returned to university, gaining a doctorate later that year. He was employed as a food chemist by a branch of the giant IG Farben company, based in Leverkusen in the Ruhr. Enraged by the French occupation of the Ruhr in 1924, Ley became an ultra-nationalist and joined the Nazi Party soon after reading Adolf Hitler&#x27;s speech at his trial following the Beer Hall Putsch in Munich. Ley proved unswervingly loyal to Hitler, which led Hitler to ignore complaints about his arrogance, incompetence and drunkenness.

Ley&#x27;s impoverished upbringing and his experience as head of the largely working-class Rhineland party region meant that he was sympathetic to the Strasserite elements in the party, but he always sided with Hitler in inner party disputes. This helped him survive the hostility of other party officials such as the party treasurer, Franz Xaver Schwarz, who regarded him as an incompetent drunk.

==Rise in the Nazi Party==
Ley rejoined the re-founded Nazi Party in March 1925, shortly after the party&#x27;s ban was lifted (membership number 18,441). He was named Deputy &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of the Southern Rhineland (later, Rhineland) that month, and was promoted to &quot;Gauleiter&quot; on 17 July. In September 1925, he became a member of the National Socialist Working Association, a short-lived group of northern and western German &quot;Gauleiters&quot;, organized and led by Gregor Strasser, which advocated a more working-class focus for the Party and unsuccessfully sought to amend the Party program. At a meeting on 24 January 1926, however, Ley joined with others in raising objections to Strasser&#x27;s proposed new draft program and it was shelved. Shortly thereafter, the Working Association was dissolved following the Bamberg Conference.

In March 1928, Ley became the editor and publisher of a virulently anti-Semitic Nazi newspaper, the &quot;Westdeutscher Beobachter&quot; (West German Observer) in Cologne. On 20 May 1928, he was elected to the Prussian Landtag, and also was appointed to the Rhenish provincial legislature. He was first elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; in September 1930 from electoral constituency 20, Cologne-Aachen. He remained as the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Rhineland until 1 June 1931 when his &quot;Gau&quot; was divided into two and new leaders named.

On 21 October 1931, Ley was brought to Munich party headquarters as the Deputy to Strasser, then the head of party organization. Ley was styled &quot;Reichsorganisationsinspekteur&quot; and conducted inspection visits to the various &quot;Gaue&quot;. On 10 June 1932, following a further organizational restructuring by Strasser, Ley was named one of two &quot;Reichsinspecteurs&quot; with oversight of approximately half the &quot;Gaue&quot;. Furthermore, he was made the Acting Landesinspekteur for Bavaria with direct responsibility for the six Bavarian &quot;Gaue&quot;. This was a short-lived initiative by Strasser to centralize control over the &quot;Gaue&quot;. However, it was unpopular with the &quot;Gauleiters&quot; and was repealed on Strasser&#x27;s fall from power. Strasser resigned on 8 December 1932 in a break with Hitler over the future direction of the Party. Hitler himself took over as &quot;Reichsorganisationsleiter&quot; and installed Ley as his &quot;Stabschef&quot; (Chief of Staff). The positions of &quot;Reichsinspecteur&quot; and &quot;Landesinspekteur&quot; were abolished. When Hitler became Reich Chancellor in January 1933, Ley accompanied him to Berlin. On 2 June 1933, Ley was among those raised to &quot;Reichsleiter&quot;, the second highest political rank in the Nazi Party. This was followed on 14 September 1933 by his appointment to the reconstituted Prussian State Council by Prussian Minister-President Hermann Göring. On 3 October 1933, Ley was named to Hans Frank&#x27;s Academy for German Law and, on 10 November 1934, Hitler finally formally promoted Ley to the position of &quot;Reichsorganisationsleiter&quot;. Ley would retain these positions until the fall of the Nazi regime.

==Labour Front head==

By April, 1933 Hitler decided to have the Nazi Party take over the trade union movement. On 10 May 1933, Hitler appointed Ley head of the newly founded German Labour Front (&quot;Deutsche Arbeitsfront&quot;, DAF). The DAF took over the existing Nazi trade union formation, the National Socialist Factory Cell Organisation (&quot;Nationalsozialistische Betriebszellenorganisation&quot;, NSBO) as well as the main trade union federation. But Ley&#x27;s lack of administrative ability meant that the NSBO leader, Reinhold Muchow, a member of the Strasserite wing of the Nazi Party, soon became the dominant figure in the DAF, overshadowing Ley. Muchow began a purge of the DAF administration, rooting out ex-Social Democrats and ex-Communists and placing his own militants in their place.

The NSBO cells continued to agitate in the factories on issues of wages and conditions, annoying the employers, who soon complained to Hitler and other Nazi leaders that the DAF was as bad as the Communists had been.

Hitler had no sympathy with the syndicalist tendencies of the NSBO, and in January 1934 a new Law for the Ordering of National Labour effectively suppressed independent working-class factory organisations, even Nazi ones, and put questions of wages and conditions in the hands of the Trustees of Labour (&quot;&quot;), dominated by the employers. At the same time Muchow was purged and Ley&#x27;s control over the DAF re-established. The NSBO was completely suppressed and the DAF became little more than an arm of the state for the more efficient deployment and disciplining of labour to serve the needs of the regime, particularly its massive expansion of the arms industry.

As head of the Labour Front, Ley invited Edward, Duke of Windsor, and Wallis, Duchess of Windsor, to conduct a tour of Germany in 1937, months after Edward had abdicated the British throne. Ley served as their host and their personal chaperone. During the visit, Ley&#x27;s alcoholism was noticed, and at one point he crashed the Windsors&#x27; car into a gate.

Once his power was established, Ley began to abuse it in a way that was conspicuous even by the standards of the Nazi regime. On top of his generous salaries as DAF head, &quot;Reichsorganisationsleiter&quot;, and Reichstag deputy, he pocketed the large profits of the &quot;Westdeutscher Beobachter&quot;, and freely embezzled DAF funds for his personal use. By 1938 he owned a luxurious estate near Cologne, a string of villas in other cities, a fleet of cars, a private railway carriage and a large art collection. He increasingly devoted his time to &quot;womanising and heavy drinking, both of which often led to embarrassing scenes in public.&quot;

On 29 December 1942 his second wife Inge Ursula Spilcker (1916–1942) shot herself after a drunken brawl. Ley&#x27;s subordinates took their lead from him, and the DAF became a notorious centre of corruption, all paid for with the compulsory dues paid by German workers. One historian says: &quot;The DAF quickly began to gain a reputation as perhaps the most corrupt of all the major institutions of the Third Reich. For this, Ley himself had to shoulder a large part of the blame.&quot;

== Strength Through Joy ==
Hitler and Ley were aware that the suppression of the trade unions and the prevention of wage increases by the Trustees of Labour system, when coupled with their relentless demands for increased productivity to hasten German rearmament, created a real risk of working-class discontent. In November 1933, as a means of preventing labour disaffection, the DAF established Strength Through Joy (&quot;Kraft durch Freude&quot;, KdF), to provide a range of benefits and amenities to the German working class and their families. These included subsidised holidays both at resorts across Germany and in &quot;safe&quot; countries abroad (particularly Italy). Two of the world&#x27;s first purpose-built cruise-liners, the &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; and the &quot;Robert Ley&quot;, were built to take KdF members on Mediterranean cruises.

Other KdF programs included concerts, opera and other forms of entertainment in factories and other workplaces, free physical education and gymnastics training and coaching in sports such as football, tennis and sailing. All this was paid for by the DAF, at a cost of a year by 1937, and ultimately by the workers themselves through their dues, although the employers also contributed. KdF was one of the Nazi regime&#x27;s most popular programs, and played a large part in reconciling the working class to the regime, at least before 1939.

The DAF and KdF&#x27;s most ambitious program was the &quot;people&#x27;s car,&quot; the Volkswagen, originally a project undertaken at Hitler&#x27;s request by the car-maker Ferdinand Porsche. When the German car industry was unable to meet Hitler&#x27;s demand that the Volkswagen be sold at or less, the project was taken over by the DAF. This brought Ley&#x27;s old socialist tendencies back into prominence. The party, he said, had taken over where private industry had failed, because of the &quot;short-sightedness, malevolence, profiteering and stupidity&quot; of the business class. Now working for the DAF, Porsche built a new Volkswagen factory at Fallersleben, at a huge cost which was partly met by raiding the DAF&#x27;s accumulated assets and misappropriating the dues paid by DAF members. The Volkswagen was sold to German workers on an installment plan, and the first models appeared in February 1939. The outbreak of war, however, meant that none of the 340,000 workers who paid for a car ever received one.

== Wartime role ==
Ley said in a speech in 1939: &quot;We National Socialists have monopolized all resources and all our energies during the past seven years so as to be able to be equipped for the supreme effort of battle.&quot; (→ German rearmament) After the beginning of World War II in September 1939, Ley&#x27;s importance declined. The militarisation of the workforce and the diversion of resources to the war greatly reduced the role of the DAF, and the KdF was largely curtailed. Ley&#x27;s drunkenness and erratic behaviour were less tolerated in wartime, and he was supplanted by Armaments Minister Fritz Todt and his successor Albert Speer as the czar of the German workforce (the head of the &quot;Organisation Todt&quot; (OT)). As German workers were increasingly conscripted, foreign workers, first &quot;guest workers&quot; from France and later slave labourers from Poland, Ukraine and other eastern countries, were brought in to replace them. Ley played some role in this program, but was overshadowed by Fritz Sauckel, General Plenipotentiary for the Distribution of Labour (&quot;Generalbevollmächtigter für den Arbeitseinsatz&quot;) since March 1942.

Nevertheless, Ley was deeply implicated in the mistreatment of foreign slave workers. In October 1942 he attended a meeting in Essen with Paul Pleiger (head of the giant Hermann Göring Works industrial combine) and leaders of the German coal industry. A verbatim account of the meeting was kept by one of the managers. A recent historian writes:

Despite his failings, Ley retained Hitler&#x27;s favour; until the last months of the war he was part of Hitler&#x27;s inner circle along with Martin Bormann and Joseph Goebbels. In November 1940 he was given a new role, as Reich Commissioner for Social Housing Construction (&quot;Reichskommissar für den sozialen Wohnungsbau&quot;), later shortened to Reich Housing Commissioner (&quot;Reichswohnungskommissar&quot;). Here his job was to prepare for the effects on German housing of the expected Allied air attacks on German cities, which began to increase in intensity from 1941 onwards. In this role he became a key ally of Armaments Minister Albert Speer, who recognised that German workers must be adequately housed if productivity was to be maintained. As the air war against Germany increased from 1943, &quot;dehousing&quot; German workers became an objective of the Allied area bombing campaign, and Ley&#x27;s organisation was increasingly unable to cope with the resulting housing crisis.

He was aware in general terms of the Nazi regime&#x27;s programme of extermination of the Jews of Europe. Ley encouraged it through the virulent anti-Semitism of his publications and speeches. In February 1941 he was present at a meeting along with Speer, Bormann and Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel at which Hitler had set out his views on the &quot;Jewish question&quot; at some length, making it clear that he intended the &quot;disappearance&quot; of the Jews one way or another. According to American historian Jeffrey Herf, Ley issued some of the most overt propaganda accusing Jews of plotting the extermination of Germans and threatening to do the reverse. In December 1939, he said that in the event of a British victory:
In April 1945, Ley became enamored with the idea of creating a &quot;death ray&quot; after receiving a letter from an unnamed inventor: &quot;I&#x27;ve studied the documentation; there&#x27;s no doubt about it. This will be the decisive weapon!&quot; Once Ley gave Speer a list of materials, including a particular model circuit breaker, Speer found that the circuit breaker had not been manufactured in 40 years.

== Postwar: arrest and suicide ==

As Nazi Germany collapsed in early 1945, Ley was among the government figures who remained fanatically loyal to Hitler. He last saw Hitler on 20 April 1945, Hitler&#x27;s birthday, in the &quot;Führerbunker&quot; in central Berlin. The next day he left for southern Bavaria, in the expectation that Hitler would make his last stand in the &quot;National Redoubt&quot; in the alpine areas. When Hitler refused to leave Berlin, Ley was effectively unemployed.

On 16 May he was captured by American paratroopers of the 101st Airborne Division in a shoemaker&#x27;s house in the village of Schleching. Ley told them he was &quot;Dr Ernst Distelmeyer,&quot; but he was identified by Franz Xaver Schwarz, the treasurer of the Nazi Party and a long-time enemy. After his arrest, he declared: &quot;You can torture or beat me or impale me on a stake. But I will never doubt the greater deeds of Hitler.&quot;

At the Nuremberg Trials, Ley was indicted under Count One (&quot;The Common Plan or Conspiracy to wage an aggressive war in violation of international law or treaties&quot;), Count Three (War Crimes, including among other things &quot;mistreatment of prisoners of war or civilian populations&quot;) and Count Four (&quot;Crimes Against Humanity – murder, extermination, enslavement of civilian populations, persecution on the basis of racial, religious or political grounds&quot;). Ley was apparently indignant at being regarded as a war criminal, telling the American psychiatrist Douglas Kelley and psychologist Gustave Gilbert who had seen and tested him in prison: &quot;Stand us against a wall and shoot us, well and good, you are victors. But why should I be brought before a Tribunal like a c-c-c- ... I can&#x27;t even get the word out!&quot;.

On 24 October, three days after receiving the indictment, Ley strangled himself to death in his prison cell using a noose made by tearing a towel into strips, fastened to the toilet pipe.

<doc id="147176" wikidata="Q27716" url="?curid=147176" title="Latin grammar">
<text>Latin is a heavily inflected language with largely free word order. Nouns are inflected for number and case; pronouns and adjectives (including participles) are inflected for number, case, and gender; and verbs are inflected for person, number, tense, aspect, voice, and mood. The inflections are often changes in the ending of a word, but can be more complicated, especially with verbs.

Thus verbs can take any of over 100 different endings to express different meanings, for example &quot;I rule&quot;, &quot;I am ruled&quot;, &quot;to rule&quot;, &quot;to be ruled&quot;. Most verbal forms consist of a single word, but some tenses are formed from part of the verb &quot;I am&quot; added to a participle; for example, &quot;I was led&quot; or &quot;he is going to lead&quot;.

Classified things (represented by common nouns) belong to one of three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter). The gender of the classified thing is realized by the last syllables of the adjectives, numbers and pronouns that refer to it: e.g. male animals such as &quot;this man&quot; and &quot;this cock&quot;, female animals such as &quot;this woman&quot; and &quot;this chicken&quot;, and either sexually undifferentiated animals such as &quot;this egg&quot; or stuff in general such as &quot;this thing&quot;. Specific kinds of stuff and abstract things also have one of the three grammatical genders. There are also two numbers: singular ( &quot;woman&quot;) and plural ( &quot;women&quot;).

As well as having gender and number, nouns, adjectives, and pronouns have different endings according to their function in the sentence, for example, &quot;the king&quot; (subject), but &quot;the king&quot; (object). These different endings are called &quot;cases&quot;. Most nouns have five cases: nominative (subject), accusative (object), 
genitive (&quot;of&quot;), dative (&quot;to&quot; or &quot;for&quot;), and ablative (&quot;with&quot; or &quot;in&quot;). Nouns for people (potential addressees) have the vocative (used for addressing someone). Nouns for places have a seventh case, the locative; this is mostly found with the names of towns and cities, e.g. &quot;in Rome&quot;.

There is no definite or indefinite article in Latin, so that can mean &quot;king&quot;, &quot;a king&quot;, or &quot;the king&quot; according to context.

Latin word order tends to be subject–object–verb; however, other word orders are common. Different word orders are used to express different shades of emphasis. (See Latin word order.)

An adjective can come either before or after a noun, e.g. or &quot;a good man&quot;, although some kinds of adjectives, such as adjectives of nationality ( &quot;a Roman man&quot;) usually follow the noun.

Latin is a pro-drop language; that is, pronouns in the subject are usually omitted except for emphasis, so for example by itself means &quot;you love&quot; without the need to add the pronoun &quot;you&quot;. Latin also exhibits verb framing in which the path of motion is encoded into the verb rather than shown by a separate word or phrase. For example, the Latin verb (a compound of  and ) means &quot;he/she/it goes out&quot;.

In this article a line over a vowel (e.g. ē) indicates that it is long.

==Nouns==
===Number===
Most Latin nouns have two numbers, singular and plural: &quot;king&quot;, &quot;kings&quot;. A few nouns, called (&quot;plural only&quot;), although plural in form, have a singular meaning, e.g. &quot;a camp&quot;, &quot;a letter&quot;, &quot;a wedding&quot;.

===Gender===
Nouns are divided into three genders, known as masculine, feminine, and neuter. The difference is shown in the pronouns and adjectives that refer to them, for example:
* &quot;the king himself&quot; (&quot;masculine&quot;)
* &quot;the queen herself&quot; (&quot;feminine&quot;)
* &quot;the war itself&quot; (&quot;neuter&quot;)

To a certain extent, the genders follow the meanings of the words (for example, winds are masculine, tree-names feminine):

*Masculine nouns include all those referring to males, such as &quot;master&quot;, &quot;boy&quot;, &quot;god&quot;, but also some inanimate objects such as &quot;garden&quot;, &quot;army&quot;, &quot;custom&quot;. Words in the 2nd declension ending in &quot;-us&quot; or &quot;-er&quot; are usually masculine.
*Feminine nouns include all those referring to females, such as &quot;girl&quot;, &quot;woman&quot;, &quot;goddess&quot;, but also inanimate or abstract nouns such as &quot;tree&quot;, &quot;city&quot;, &quot;kindness&quot;, &quot;nation&quot;. Words in the 1st declension like ending in &quot;-a&quot; are usually feminine, with a few exceptions such as &quot;poet&quot;. Also feminine are 3rd declension nouns ending in &quot;-tās&quot; and &quot;-tiō&quot;.
*Neuter nouns (apart from &quot;a sex worker (of either gender)&quot;) all refer to things, such as &quot;name&quot;, &quot;body&quot;, &quot;war&quot;, &#x27;poison&#x27;.

Neuter nouns differ from masculine and feminine in two ways: (1) the plural nominative and accusative forms end in &quot;-a&quot;, e.g. &quot;wars&quot;, &quot;bodies&quot;; (2) the subject (nominative) and object (accusative) cases are identical.

===Case===
Nouns in Latin have a series of different forms, called &quot;cases&quot; of the noun, which have different functions or meanings. For example, the word for &quot;king&quot; is when it is the subject of a verb, but when it is the object:
* &quot;the king sees&quot; (nominative case)
* &quot;(he) sees the king&quot; (accusative case)

Further cases mean &quot;of&quot; (genitive case), &quot;to/for&quot; (dative case), and &quot;with&quot; (ablative case).

Nouns for people have a separate form used for addressing a person (vocative case). In most nouns for women and girls, the vocative is the same as the nominative.

Some nouns, such as the names of cities and small islands, and the word &quot;home&quot;, have a seventh case called the locative, for example &quot;in Rome&quot; or &quot;at home&quot;; however, most nouns do not have this case.

The genitive, dative and ablative cases are called the &quot;oblique&quot; cases.

The order in which the cases are given in grammar books differs in different countries. In Britain and countries influenced by Britain, the order nominative, vocative, accusative is used as in the table below. In the United States, in grammars such as Gildersleeve and Lodge&#x27;s &quot;Latin Grammar&quot; (1895), the traditional order is used, with the genitive case in the second place and ablative last. In the popularly used Wheelock&#x27;s Latin (1956, 7th edition 2011) and Allen and Greenough&#x27;s &quot;New Latin Grammar&quot; (1903), however, the vocative is placed at the end.

The following table shows the endings of a typical noun of the 3rd declension. If Gildersleeve and Lodge&#x27;s order is preferred, click on the symbol &quot;GL&quot; in the seventh column in the table below; for Wheelock&#x27;s order click on &quot;Wh&quot;:

Sometimes the same endings, e.g. and , are used for more than one case. Since the function of a word in Latin is shown by ending rather than word order, in theory could mean either &quot;the kings lead&quot; or &quot;they lead the kings&quot;. In practice, however, such ambiguities are rare.

===Declensions===
====1st and 2nd declensions====
Latin nouns are divided into different groups according to the patterns of their case endings. These different groups are known as &quot;declensions&quot;. Nouns with &quot;-a&quot; in the nominative singular, like &quot;girl&quot; are known as &quot;1st declension nouns&quot;, and so on.

The following table shows the declension of &quot;girl&quot; (1st declension), &quot;lord, master&quot; (2nd declension masculine), and &quot;war&quot; (2nd declension neuter):

1st declension nouns are usually feminine, except for a few referring to men, such as &quot;farmer&quot; or &quot;poet&quot;. The nouns &quot;daughter&quot; and &quot;goddess&quot; have dative and ablative plural . The locative case ends in &quot;-ae&quot;, pl. &quot;-īs&quot;, e.g. &quot;in Rome&quot;, &quot;in Athens&quot;.

2nd declension nouns in &quot;-us&quot; are usually masculine, but those referring to trees (e.g. &quot;pine tree&quot;) and some place names (e.g. &quot;Egypt&quot;) are feminine. A few 2nd declension nouns, such as &quot;man&quot; and &quot;boy&quot;, lack endings in the nominative and vocative singular. In the 2nd declension, the genitive plural in some words is optionally &quot;-um&quot;, especially in poetry: or &quot;of the gods&quot;, or &quot;of men&quot;.

Neuter nouns such as &quot;war&quot; have &quot;-a&quot; in the nominative plural. In neuter nouns, the vocative and accusative are always the same as the nominative; the genitive, dative, and ablative are the same as the masculine. Most 2nd declension neuter nouns end in &quot;-um&quot; but &quot;poison&quot; and &quot;crowd&quot; end in &quot;-us&quot;.

====3rd declension====
Third declension nouns have various patterns of declension. Some decline like the following: &quot;soldier&quot;, &quot;city&quot;, &quot;body&quot;:

There are some variations, however. A few, such as &quot;force&quot;, have accusative singular &quot;-im&quot; and ablative singular &quot;-ī&quot;; some, like &quot;fire&quot;, optionally have &quot;-ī&quot; instead of &quot;-e&quot; in the ablative singular. The genitive plural in some nouns is &quot;-um&quot;, in others &quot;-ium&quot;. (For details, see Latin declension.) 3rd declension nouns can be of any gender.

It is not usually possible to guess the genitive of a noun from the nominative: &quot;leader&quot; has genitive but &quot;king&quot; has ; &quot;father&quot; has genitive but &quot;journey&quot; has . For this reason the genitive is always given in dictionaries, and can be used to discover the remaining cases.

====4th and 5th declension====
4th and 5th declension nouns are less common. They decline like the following ( &quot;hand&quot;, &quot;knee&quot;, &quot;day&quot;):


4th declension nouns are usually masculine, but a few, such as &quot;hand&quot; and &quot;old lady&quot;, are feminine. There are only four 4th declension neuter nouns.
5th declension nouns (except for (m) &quot;day&quot;) are usually feminine. &quot;thing&quot; is similar to except for a short &quot;e&quot; in the genitive and dative singular .

====Other nouns====
In addition to the above there are some irregularly declined nouns, mostly borrowed from Greek, such as the name &quot;Aeneas&quot; (1st declension masculine).

The vocative is nearly always the same as the nominative, except in 1st and 2nd declension masculine singular words, such as &quot;Aeneas!&quot; and &quot;master!/lord!&quot;. Some words, such as &quot;god&quot;, have no separate vocative, however.

===Use of cases===
====Nominative====
The nominative case is used for the subject of an active or a passive verb:
: = the king replied
: = the king was killed

It is also used for the complement of a copula verb such as &quot;he is&quot; or &quot;he became&quot;:
: = our king was Aeneas / Aeneas was our king
: = he was made king / he became king

====Vocative====
The vocative case is used when addressing someone:
: = do you order me, King Romulus, to strike a treaty?

====Accusative====
The accusative case is used for the object of a sentence:
: = they killed the king

It is also used as the subject of an infinitival clause dependent on a verb of speaking or the like:
: = they believed that the king had been killed

It can be the complement of another word which is itself accusative:
: = the people made Tullus their king

It can also be used with a place name to refer to the destination:
: = he set out for Rome

The accusative is also used after various prepositions (especially those that imply motion towards):
: = the Senate sent ambassadors to the king
: = the consul returned to the city

Another use of the accusative is to give a length of time or distance:
: = he reigned for five years
: = five foot tall

====Genitive====
A genitive noun can represent a kin:
: = the king&#x27;s daughter, daughter of the king

A genitive noun can stand for the object of mental processes such as &quot;I pity&quot; and &quot;I forget&quot;:
: = I will never forget that night

A genitive noun attached to a verbal noun can stand for the object of the implied verb (called an &quot;objective genitive&quot;):
: = my longing for the great man

A genitive noun can stand for the subject of the implied verb (called a &quot;subjective&quot; genitive):
: = Caesar&#x27;s arrival

A frequent type of genitive is the partitive genitive, expressing the quantity of something:
: = enough time

====Dative====
The dative case means &quot;to&quot; or &quot;for&quot;. It is frequently used with verbs of saying or giving: 
: = it was announced to the king
: = he entrusted the money to the king

It can also be used with certain adjectives:
: = he was very dear to the king

It is also used with certain verbs such as &quot;I obey&quot; or &quot;I persuade&quot;:
: = he was obedient to (i.e. obeyed) the king

There are also various idiomatic uses, such as the dative of possession:
: = what&#x27;s your name?

====Ablative====
The ablative case can mean &quot;with&quot;, especially when the noun it refers to is a thing rather than a person:
: = he stabbed himself with a sword

Often a phrase consisting of a noun plus participle in the ablative can express time or circumstance. This is known as an &quot;ablative absolute&quot;:
: = with the kings driven out, i.e. after the kings were driven out

It is also frequently used with prepositions, especially those meaning &quot;from&quot;, &quot;with&quot;, &quot;in&quot;, or &quot;by&quot;:
: = one from (i.e. one of) the kings
: = with the kings
: = by the kings, from the kings
: = for/on behalf of the king

Another use is in expressions of time and place (except those that give the length of time or distance):
: = at that time
: = at this place
: = in a few days

The ablative can also mean &quot;from&quot;, especially with place names:
: = he set out from Rome
: = he was dislodged from his position

====Locative====
The locative is a rare case used only with names of cities, small islands, and one or two other words such as &quot;domus&quot; &quot;home&quot;. It means &quot;at&quot; or &quot;in&quot;:
: = one of the two consuls remained in Rome
: = he lived at our house for many years

==Adjectives==
===Declension of adjectives===
Adjectives, like nouns, have different endings for the different cases, singular and plural. They also differ as to gender, having different forms for masculine, feminine, and neuter. (But masculine and neuter are identical in the genitive, dative, and ablative cases.)

Many adjectives belong to the 1st and 2nd declensions, declining in the same way as the nouns . An example is the adjective &quot;good&quot; shown below:

Other adjectives belong to the 3rd declension, in which case the masculine and feminine are usually identical. Most 3rd declension adjectives are i-stems, and have ablative singular &quot;-ī&quot; and genitive plural &quot;-ium&quot;. An example is &quot;huge&quot; shown below:

In a very few 3rd declension adjectives such as &quot;sharp, keen&quot;, the feminine is different from the masculine, but only in the nominative and vocative singular.

A few adjectives (especially comparative adjectives) decline as consonant stems, and have ablative singular &quot;-e&quot; and genitive plural &quot;-um&quot;. An example is &quot;better&quot;:

Participles such as &quot;leading&quot; usually have &quot;-e&quot; in the ablative singular, but &quot;-ium&quot; in the genitive plural.

There are no adjectives in the 4th or 5th declensions.

The adjectives &quot;only&quot; and &quot;the whole of&quot; decline like pronouns, with genitive singular &quot;-īus&quot; and dative singular &quot;-ī&quot;:
: = of the whole of Greece (genitive case)
: = to you alone (dative case)

===Agreement of adjectives===
Any adjective that describes or refers to a noun must be in the same case as the noun, as well as the same number and gender. Thus in the phrase below, where &quot;rēx&quot; is in the vocative singular case, &quot;bonus&quot; must be in the vocative singular also:
: = o good king

===Comparative and superlative adjectives===
Adjectives have positive, comparative and superlative forms. Superlative adjectives are declined according to the first and second declension, but comparative adjectives are third declension.

When used in sentences, a comparative adjective can be used in several ways:
* Absolutely (with the meaning &quot;rather&quot; or &quot;more than usual&quot;)
* With (Latin for &quot;than&quot;)
* With an ablative meaning &quot;than&quot;
* With the genitive

Examples:

* &quot;: Cornelia is a brave girl.

The comparative adjective can be used absolutely (i.e. without any overt comparison) or with the comparison made explicit:
* &quot;: Cornelia is a rather brave girl.
* &quot;&quot;: Cornelia is a braver girl than Flavia. (Here &quot;quam&quot; is used, &quot;Flavia&quot; is in the nominative to match Cornelia)
* &quot;&quot;: Cornelia is braver than Flavia. (Here &quot;Flavia&quot; is in the ablative.)
* &quot;&quot;: Cornelia is the braver of the girls

Superlative adjectives are most frequently used absolutely, but they can also be used with the genitive &quot;of all&quot;:
* &quot;: Cornelia is a very brave girl
* &quot;: Cornelia is the bravest girl of all.

&quot;Detailed information and declension tables can be found at Latin declension.&quot;

==Pronouns==
Pronouns are of two kinds, personal pronouns and 3rd person pronouns. Personal pronouns decline as follows.

 can also be used reflexively (&quot;I see myself&quot; etc.).

 is frequently used in classical Latin for &quot;I&quot;, but is never used in a singular sense.

The genitive is used partitively ( &quot;each one of us&quot;), objectively ( &quot;remembering us, mindful of us&quot;).

3rd person pronouns are those such as &quot;this&quot; and &quot;(he) himself&quot;. The 3rd person pronouns can also be used adjectivally (except that &quot;what?&quot; when adjectival becomes ). The declension of these pronouns tends to be irregular. They generally have &quot;-īus&quot; in the genitive singular, and &quot;-ī&quot; in the dative singular. In a few pronouns ( &quot;that&quot;, &quot;that (of yours)&quot;, &quot;it, that&quot;, &quot;which&quot;, &quot;anything; what?&quot;, &quot;another&quot;, &quot;something&quot;) the neuter singular ends in &quot;-d&quot;.

The declension of &quot;that&quot; is as follows:
 &quot;he himself&quot; is very similar, except that the neuter singular ends in &quot;-m&quot; instead of &quot;-d&quot;.

Other very common 3rd person pronouns are &quot;this&quot; and &quot;he, she, it; that&quot;. Like other 3rd person pronouns, these can be used either independently ( &quot;he&quot;) or adjectivally ( &quot;that man&quot;):

Before a vowel, and are pronounced as if spelled and . is pronounced as if spelled with a long first syllable.

Also very common is the relative pronoun &quot;who, which&quot;. The interrogative &quot;who? what?&quot; and indefinite &quot;anyone, anything&quot; are similar apart from the nominative singular:

Like adjectives, pronouns must agree in gender, case, and number with the nouns they refer to, as in the following, where &quot;hic&quot; is masculine agreeing with &quot;amor&quot;, but &quot;haec&quot; is feminine, agreeing with &quot;patria&quot;:
: = this is my love, this my country

There is no indefinite article or definite article (the, a, an). Sometimes the weak determiner &quot;&quot; (English &quot;that, this&quot;) can serve for the definite article:
:&quot;He persuaded the people that a fleet should be built with the money (with that money)&quot;

==Adverbs==
Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives and other adverbs by indicating time, place or manner. Latin adverbs are indeclinable and invariable. Like adjectives, adverbs have positive, comparative and superlative forms.

The positive form of an adverb can often be formed from an adjective by appending the suffix &quot;-ē&quot; (2nd declension adjectives) or &quot;-(t)er&quot; (3rd declension adjectives). Thus the adjective , which means &quot;bright&quot;, can be contrasted to the adverb , which means &quot;brightly&quot;. The adverbial ending is used to form adverbs from 3rd declension adjectives, for example &quot;quick&quot;, &quot;quickly&quot;. Other endings such as &quot;-ō&quot;, &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;-tim&quot; are also found.

The comparative form of an adverb is the same as the neuter nominative singular form of a comparative adjective and usually ends in &quot;-ius&quot;. Instead of the adjective , which means &quot;brighter&quot;, the adverb is , which means &quot;more brightly&quot;.

The superlative adverb has the same base as the superlative adjective and always ends in a long &quot;-ē&quot;. Instead of the adjective , which mean &quot;very bright&quot; or &quot;brightest&quot;, the adverb is , which means &quot;very brightly&quot; or &quot;most brightly&quot;.

==Prepositions==
===Prepositions===
A prepositional phrase in Latin is made up of a preposition followed by a noun phrase in the accusative or ablative case. The preposition determines the case that is used, with some prepositions allowing different cases depending on the meaning. For example, Latin &quot;in&quot; takes the accusative case when it indicates motion (English &quot;into&quot;) and the ablative case when it indicates position (English &quot;on&quot; or &quot;inside&quot;):
: = &quot;into the city&quot; (accusative)
: = &quot;in the city&quot; (ablative)

Most prepositions take one case only. For example, all those that mean &quot;from&quot;, &quot;by&quot;, or &quot;with&quot; take the ablative:
: = &quot;out of the city&quot;
: = &quot;(away) from the city&quot;
: = &quot;with Caesar&quot;

Other prepositions take only the accusative:
: = &quot;outside the city&quot;
: = &quot;to/near the city&quot;
: = &quot;through(out) the city&quot;
: = &quot;around the city&quot;

===Postpositions===
In addition, there are a few postpositions. &quot;as far as&quot; usually follows an ablative, sometimes a genitive plural case:
: &quot;as far as Taurus&quot;
: &quot;as far as Cumae&quot;

 &quot;towards&quot; is usually combined with or :
: &quot;towards the Alps&quot;

 &quot;for the sake of&quot; follows a genitive:
: &quot;for the sake of (doing) honour&quot;

The word &quot;with&quot; is usually a preposition, but with the personal pronouns &quot;me, you sg., him/herself/themselves, us, you pl.&quot; it follows the pronoun and is joined to it in writing:
: &quot;with him&quot;
: &quot;with me&quot;

Both and &quot;with whom&quot; are found.

==Numerals and numbers==
The first three numbers have masculine, feminine and neuter forms fully declined as follows:

 (one) can also be used in the plural, with plural-only nouns, e.g. &quot;one camp&quot;, &quot;one letter&quot;. For larger numbers plural-only nouns use special numerals: &quot;two camps&quot;, &quot;three camps&quot;. (See Latin numerals.)

The numbers (four) through (ten) are not declined:
: (4)
: (5)
: (6)
: (7)
: (8)
: (9)
: (10)

The &quot;tens&quot; numbers are also not declined:
: (20)
: (30)
: (40)
: (50)
: (60)
: (70)
: (80)
: (90)

The numbers 11 to 17 are formed by affixation of the corresponding digit to the base , hence . The numbers 18 and 19 are formed by subtracting 2 and 1, respectively, from 20: and . For the numbers 21 to 27, the digits either follow or are added to 20 by the conjunction : or or etc. The numbers 28 and 29 are again formed by subtraction: and . Each group of ten numerals through 100 follows the patterns of the 20s but 98 is and 99 is rather than * and * respectively.

Compounds ending in 1 2 and 3 are the only ones to decline:
:I saw 20 blackbirds = 
:I saw 22 blackbirds = (where changes to agree with )

The &quot;hundreds&quot; numbers are the following:
: (indeclinable)
: (200)
: (300)
: (400)
: (500)
: (600)
: (700)
: (800)
: (900)

However, 1000 is , an indeclinable adjective, but multiples such as (2000) have as a neuter plural substantive followed by a partitive genitive:
:I saw a thousand lions = 
:I saw three thousand lions = 

Ordinal numbers are all adjectives with regular first- and second-declension endings. Most are built off of the stems of cardinal numbers (for example, (30th) from (30), (609th) for (609). However, &quot;first&quot; is , and &quot;second&quot; is (literally &quot;following&quot; the first; means &quot;to follow&quot;).

==Verbs==
===Persons of the verb===
Each tense has endings corresponding to three persons in the singular, known as 1st person singular (&quot;I&quot;), 2nd person singular (&quot;you sg.&quot;), 3rd person singular (&quot;he, she, it&quot;), and three in the plural, known as 1st person plural (&quot;we&quot;), 2nd person plural (&quot;you pl.&quot;), and 3rd person plural (&quot;they&quot;). Unlike Ancient Greek, there is no dual number in the Latin verb.

Unlike in Spanish, French, and other Romance languages, there are no respectful 2nd person forms in Latin grammar: the 2nd person singular is used even when addressing a person of high status. However, the 1st person plural is often used to mean &quot;I&quot;.

===Gender===
Most verbs do not show grammatical gender: the same ending is used whether the subject is &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, or &quot;it&quot;. However, when a verb is made periphrastically out of a participle and part of the verb &quot;I am&quot;, the participle shows gender, for example:
* &quot;he was sent&quot;
* &quot;she was sent&quot;

Impersonal verbs, such as &quot;it was reported&quot;, are neuter singular.

===Voice===
Latin verbs have two voices, active (e.g. &quot;I lead&quot;) and passive (e.g. &quot;I am led&quot;).

In addition there are a few verbs (e.g. &quot;I follow&quot;) which have the endings of passive verbs but with an active meaning, a relic of the older mediopassive voice. These verbs are known as deponent verbs.
Intransitive verbs such as &quot;I am&quot; usually have no passive voice. However, some intransitive verbs can be used in the passive voice, but only when impersonal, e.g. &quot;(a battle) was fought&quot;, &quot;they came&quot; (literally, &quot;it was come&quot;).

===Mood===
Latin verbs have three moods: indicative, subjunctive, and imperative:

Ordinary statements such as &quot;I lead&quot; or &quot;he came&quot; are said to be in the indicative mood. The subjunctive mood (e.g. &quot;he may lead, he would lead&quot; or &quot;he would have led&quot;) is used for potential or hypothetical statements, wishes, and also in reported speech and certain types of subordinate clause. The imperative mood (e.g. &quot;lead!&quot;) is a command.

In addition Latin verbs have a number of non-finite forms, such as the infinitive and various participles.

===Regular and irregular verbs===
Most Latin verbs are regular and follow one of the five patterns below. These are referred to as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th conjugation, according to whether the infinitive ends in or . (Verbs like are regarded as variations of the 3rd conjugation, with some forms like those of the 4th conjugation.)

Other verbs like &quot;I am&quot; are irregular and have their own pattern.

Compound verbs such as &quot;I am present&quot;, &quot;I don&#x27;t want&quot;, &quot;I go back&quot;, etc., usually have the same endings as the simple verbs from which they are made.

===Tenses===
====A 3rd conjugation example====
Latin verbs have six basic tenses in the indicative mood. Three of these are based on the present stem (e.g. &quot;dūc-&quot;) and three on the perfect stem (e.g. &quot;dūx-&quot;).

In addition, there are four tenses in the subjunctive mood, and two in the imperative.

Further tenses can be made periphrastically by combining participles with the verbs &quot;I am&quot; or &quot;I have&quot;, for example &quot;I was going to lead&quot; or &quot;I have led&quot;.

The following table gives the various forms of a 3rd conjugation verb . As with other verbs, three different stems are needed to make the various tenses: in the three non-perfect tenses, in the three perfect tenses, and in the perfect participle and supine. The perfect and supine stems for any particular verb cannot always be predicted and usually have to be looked up in a dictionary.

A distinction between perfective aspect (&quot;I did&quot;) and imperfective aspect (&quot;I was doing&quot;) is found only in the past in Latin. In the present or future, the same tenses have both aspectual meanings.

Unlike in Ancient Greek or modern English, there is no distinction between perfect (&quot;I have done&quot;) and simple past (&quot;I did&quot;). The same tense, known in Latin grammar as the perfect tense, has both meanings.

The passive imperative is almost never used except in deponent verbs, e.g. &quot;follow me!&quot;

====Variations====
The different conjugations differ in some tenses. For example, in the future tense:
*1st and 2nd conjugation verbs and have the endings (e.g. &quot;I will love&quot;, &quot;I will see&quot;, &quot;I will go&quot;). 
*3rd and 4th conjugation verbs and and have the endings ( &quot;I will lead&quot;, &quot;I will hear&quot;). 
* and have the endings ( &quot;I will be&quot;, &quot;I will be able&quot;)

In the imperfect indicative:
*Most verbs have the endings (e.g. )
* and have (e.g. &quot;I was able&quot;)

They also differ in the present subjunctive:
*1st conjugation verbs have the endings (e.g. &quot;I may love&quot;)
*2nd, 3rd, 4th conjugations have ( &quot;I may see&quot;, &quot;I may lead&quot;, &quot;I may hear&quot;, &quot;I may go&quot;)
*, , have ( &quot;I may be&quot;, &quot;I may be able&quot;, &quot;I may wish&quot;)

The imperfect subjunctive of every verb looks like the infinitive + an ending:
*Regular:

In the various perfect tenses, all verbs have regular endings. However, the stem to which the perfect endings are added cannot always be guessed, and so is given in dictionaries.

==Word order==

Latin allows a very flexible word order because of its inflectional syntax. Ordinary prose tended to follow the pattern of subject, direct object, indirect object, adverbial words or phrases, verb (with the proviso that when noun and verb make a compound, as &quot;I attack / make an attack&quot; the noun is generally placed close to the verb). Any extra but subordinate verb, such as an infinitive, is placed before the main verb. Adjectives and participles usually directly follow nouns unless they are adjectives of beauty, size, quantity, goodness, or truth, in which case they usually precede the noun being modified. However, departures from these rules are frequent.

Relative clauses are commonly placed after the antecedent that the relative pronoun describes. Since grammatical function in a sentence is based not on word order but on inflection, the usual word order in Latin was often abandoned with no detriment to understanding but with various changes in emphasis.

While these patterns of word order were the most frequent in Classical Latin prose, they were frequently varied. The strongest surviving evidence suggests that the word order of &quot;colloquial&quot; Latin was mostly Subject-Object-Verb. That can be found in some very conservative Romance languages, such as Sardinian and Sicilian in which the verb is still often placed at the end of the sentence (see Vulgar Latin). On the other hand, subject-verb-object word order was probably also common in ancient Latin conversation, as it is prominent in the Romance languages, which evolved from Latin.

In poetry, however, word order was often changed for the sake of the meter for which vowel quantity (short vowels vs. long vowels and diphthongs) and consonant clusters, not rhyme and word stress, governed the patterns. One must bear in mind that poets in the Roman world wrote primarily for the ear, not the eye; many premiered their work in recitation for an audience. Hence, variations in word order served a rhetorical as well as a metrical purpose; they certainly did not prevent understanding.

In Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Eclogues&quot;, for example, he writes, : &quot;&quot;Love&quot; conquers &quot;all&quot;, let us too yield to &quot;love!&quot;&quot;. The words (all), &quot;amor&quot; (love) and (to love) are thrown into relief by their unusual position in their respective phrases.

The ending of the common Roman name &quot;Mārcus&quot; is different in each of the following pairs of examples because of its grammatical usage in each pair. The ordering in the second sentence of each pair would be correct in Latin and clearly understood, whereas in English it is awkward, at best, and meaningless, at worst:

:: Marcus hits Cornelia. (subject–verb–object)
:: Marcus Cornelia hits. (subject–object–verb)
:: Cornelia gave Marcus a gift. (subject–verb–indirect object–direct object)
:: Cornelia (to) Marcus a gift gave. (subject–indirect object–direct object–verb)

<text>Zhao Ziyang (; pronounced , 17 October 1919 – 17 January 2005) was a Chinese politician. He served as the 3rd premier of China from 1980 to 1987, as vice chairman of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from 1981 to 1982, and as CCP general secretary from 1987 to 1989. He was in charge of the political reforms in China from 1986, but lost power for his support of the 1989 Tian&#x27;anmen Square protests.

Zhao joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in February 1938. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, he served as the chief officer of CCP Hua County Committee, Director of the Organization Department of the CCP Yubei prefecture Party Committee, Secretary of the CCP Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Prefecture Party Committee and Political Commissar of the 4th Military Division of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region. During the Chinese Civil War of 1945–1949, Zhao served as the Deputy Political Commissar of Tongbai Military Region, Secretary of the CCP Nanyang Prefecture Party Committee and Political Commissar of Nanyang Military Division.

After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Zhao became Deputy Secretary of the South China Branch of the CCP Central Committee. He also served as Secretary of the Secretariat of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CCP, Second Secretary and First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CCP. He was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution and spent time in political exile. After being rehabilitated, Zhao then was appointed Secretary of the CCP Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee, First Secretary of the CCP Guangdong Provincial Committee, First Secretary of the CCP Sichuan Provincial Committee and First Political Commissar of the Chengdu Military Region, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference.

As a senior government official, Zhao was critical of Maoist policies and instrumental in implementing free-market reforms, first in Sichuan and subsequently nationwide. He emerged on the national scene due to support from Deng Xiaoping after the Cultural Revolution. An advocate of the privatization of state-owned enterprises, the separation of the party and the state, and general market economy reforms, he sought measures to streamline China&#x27;s bureaucracy and fight corruption and issues that challenged the party&#x27;s legitimacy in the 1980s. Many of these views were shared by the then General Secretary Hu Yaobang.

His economic reform policies and sympathies with student demonstrators during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 placed him at odds with some members of the party leadership, including Central Advisory Commission Chairman Chen Yun, CPPCC Chairman Li Xiannian, and Premier Li Peng. Zhao also began to lose favor with Deng Xiaoping, who was the Chairman of the Central Military Commission. In the aftermath of the events, Zhao was purged politically and effectively placed under house arrest for the rest of his life. After his house arrest, he became much more radical in his political beliefs, supporting China&#x27;s full transition to liberal democracy. He died from a stroke in Beijing in January 2005. Because of his political fall from grace, he was not given the funeral rites generally accorded to senior Chinese officials. His secret memoirs were smuggled out and published in English and in Chinese in 2009, but the details of his life remain censored in China.

==Early career==

Zhao was born in 1919 as Zhao Xiuye (), but changed his given name to &quot;Ziyang&quot; while attending middle school in Wuhan. He was the son of a wealthy landlord in Hua County, Henan,who was later murdered by CCP officials during a land reform movement in the early 1940s. Zhao joined the Communist Youth League in 1932, and became a full member of the Party in 1938.

Unlike many Party members active in the 1930s and 1940s who later became senior Chinese leaders, Zhao joined the Party too late to have participated in the Long March of 1934–1935. He served in the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, which was integrated into the Republic of China&#x27;s National Revolutionary Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and the subsequent civil war, but his posts were largely administrative. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, Zhao served as the party chief of Hua County. It was there he met his wife, Liang Boqi, who was Zhao&#x27;s subordinate; the couple married in 1944. Zhao&#x27;s career was not especially notable before he emerged as a Party leader in Guangdong in the early 1950s.

Zhao rose to prominence in Guangdong from 1951, initially following a ruthless ultra-leftist, Tao Zhu, who was notable for his heavy-handed efforts to force local peasants into living and working in &quot;People&#x27;s Communes&quot;. When Mao Zedong&#x27;s Great Leap Forward (1958–1961) created an artificial famine, Mao publicly blamed the nation&#x27;s food shortages on the greed of rich peasants, who were supposedly hiding China&#x27;s huge surplus production from the government. Zhao subsequently led a local campaign aimed at torturing peasants into revealing their food supplies, which did not exist. On the other hand, Zhao worked with regional party officials to put in place arrangements that allowed peasants to profit from the sale of their crops. These projects were masked by ambiguous names such as &quot;a control system for field management&quot; to hide them from Mao, who would have forbidden the projects. According to Zhao, areas where these plans were implemented had a much lower death toll from famine. Jasper Becker, however, wrote that Zhao&#x27;s torture campaign during the Great Leap meant he was partially responsible for the millions of people who died from starvation and malnutrition in Guangdong between 1958 and 1961.

Zhao&#x27;s experiences during the Great Leap Forward led him to support moderate political and economic policies. In the early 1960s, Zhao obtained permission from the Communist Party&#x27;s Central Committee to increase foreign trade in Guangdong, which helped Guangdong to recover from the Great Leap Forward. He supported policies of Deng Xiaoping and President Liu Shaoqi. He led efforts to re-introduce limited amounts of private agriculture and commerce, and dismantled the People&#x27;s Communes. Zhao&#x27;s methods of returning private plots to farmers and assigning production contracts to individual households were replicated in other parts of China, helping the country&#x27;s agricultural sector recover. After achieving senior positions in Guangdong, Zhao directed a harsh purge of cadres accused of corruption or having ties to the Kuomintang.

In 1965, Zhao became the Party secretary of Guangdong province. He was 46 at the time that he first became Party secretary, a notably young age to hold such a prestigious position. Because of his moderate political orientation, Zhao was attacked by Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976).

He was dismissed from all official positions in 1967, after which he was paraded through Guangzhou in a dunce cap and publicly denounced as &quot;a stinking remnant of the landlord class&quot;.

==Return to government==
Zhao spent four years as a fitter in Hunan, at the Xianzhong Mechanics Factory. Zhao Wujun, the youngest of his five sons, worked with him (Zhao also had a younger daughter). While in political exile, Zhao&#x27;s family lived in a small apartment near his factory, with a small suitcase in the living room that served as a dinner table.

Zhao&#x27;s rehabilitation began in 1971, when he and his family were woken in the middle of the night by someone banging on the door. Without much explanation, the Party chief of the factory that Zhao was working at informed Zhao that he was to go at once to Changsha, the provincial capital. The factory&#x27;s only means of transport was a three-wheeled motorcycle, which was ready to take him. Zhao was driven to Changsha&#x27;s airport, where a plane had been prepared to fly him to Beijing. Still unaware of what was happening, Zhao boarded the plane. He was checked into the comfortable Beijing Hotel, but was unable to sleep: he later claimed that, after years of living in poverty, the mattress was too soft. In the morning, Zhao was taken to a meeting with Premier Zhou Enlai at the Great Hall of the People. Soon after they met, Zhao began a speech that he had prepared over the previous night: &quot;I have been rethinking the Cultural Revolution during these years as a labourer...&quot; Zhou cut him off, saying &quot;You&#x27;ve been called to Beijing because the Central Committee has decided to name you as a deputy Party chief of Inner Mongolia.&quot;

After being recalled from political exile, Zhao attempted to portray himself as a Maoist, and publicly renounced any interest in encouraging private enterprise or material incentive. Zhao&#x27;s late conversion to Maoism did not last long, and he later became a &quot;principal architect&quot; of the sweeping, pro-market changes that followed the death of Mao. Despite his important role in guiding the economy of China over the course of his career, Zhao had no formal training in economics.

Throughout 1972, Zhou Enlai directed Zhao&#x27;s political rehabilitation. He was appointed to the Central Committee, and in Inner Mongolia became the Revolutionary Committee Secretary and vice-chairman in March 1972. Zhao was elevated to the 10th Central Committee in August 1973, and returned to Guangdong as 1st CCP Secretary and Revolutionary Committee Chair in April 1974. He became Political Commissar of the Chengdu Military Region in December 1975.

=== Economic reforms in Sichuan ===
Zhao was appointed Party Secretary of Sichuan in 1975, effectively the province&#x27;s highest-ranking official. Earlier in the Cultural Revolution, Sichuan had been notable for the violent battles that rival organizations of local Red Guards had fought against each other. At the time, Sichuan was China&#x27;s most populous province, but had been economically devastated by the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, whose collective policies had collapsed the province&#x27;s agricultural production to levels not seen since the 1930s, despite a great increase in the province&#x27;s population. The economic situation was so dire that citizens in Sichuan were reportedly selling their daughters for food.

During his tenure in Sichuan, Zhao introduced a series of successful market-oriented reforms, which distributed farmland to families for private use, and allowed peasants to freely sell their crops on the marketplace. His policies also permitted greater autonomy and productivity incentives for factory managers. The reforms led to an increase in industrial production by 81% and agricultural output by 25% within three years. Zhao&#x27;s reforms made him popular in Sichuan, where the local people coined the saying: . (This saying is a homophonic pun on Zhao&#x27;s name, loosely translated as: &quot;if you want to eat, look for Ziyang.&quot;)

==Reformist leader==
After ousting Hua Guofeng as China&#x27;s &quot;paramount leader&quot; in 1978, Deng Xiaoping recognized the &quot;Sichuan Experience&quot; as a model for Chinese economic reform. Deng promoted Zhao to a position as an alternate member of the CCP Politburo in 1977, and as a full member in 1979. He joined the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, China&#x27;s highest ruling organ, in 1980. Zhao became the Leader of the Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs and Vice Chairman of the CCP in 1980 and 1981 separately.

After 1978 Zhao&#x27;s policies were replicated in Anhui, with similar success. After serving under Hua Guofeng as vice premier for six months, Zhao was promoted by Deng Xiaoping to replace Hua as the Premier of the State Council in September 1980, with a mandate to introduce his rural reforms across China. Between 1980 and 1984, China&#x27;s agricultural production rose by 50%.

Zhao developed &quot;preliminary stage theory&quot;, a model for transforming the socialist system via gradual economic reform. As premier, Zhao implemented many of the policies that were successful in Sichuan at a national scale, increasingly de-centralizing industrial and agricultural production. Zhao successfully sought to establish a series of special economic zones in coastal provinces in order to attract foreign investment and create export hubs. Inspired by futurists, especially Alvin Toffler, he led the 863 Program to respond to rapid global technological change. Zhao&#x27;s reforms led to a rapid increases in both agricultural and light-industrial production throughout the 1980s, but his economic reforms were criticized for causing inflation. Zhao promoted an open foreign policy, improving China&#x27;s relations with Western nations in order to support China&#x27;s economic development.

One of Zhao&#x27;s major cultural reforms included allowing the band Wham! to make a 10-day visit to China, the first by a Western pop group. Wham!&#x27;s 1985 visit, engineered by the band&#x27;s manager Simon Napier-Bell, was a highly publicized cultural exchange and seen as a major step in increasing friendly bilateral relations between China and the West.

In the 1980s, Zhao was branded by conservatives as a revisionist of Marxism, but his advocacy of government transparency and a national dialogue that included ordinary citizens in the policymaking process made him popular with many. Zhao was a solid believer in the Party, but he defined socialism very differently from Party conservatives. Zhao called political reform &quot;the biggest test facing socialism.&quot; He believed economic progress was inextricably linked to democratization. Zhao was a fan of golf, and is credited with popularizing the game&#x27;s reintroduction to the mainland in the 1980s.

While Zhao focused on economic reforms during the early 1980s, his superior, Hu Yaobang, promoted a number of political reforms. In the late 1980s Hu and Zhao collaborated to promote a series of large-scale political reforms with vaguely defined goals. The political reforms of Hu and Zhao included proposals to have candidates directly elected to the Politburo, more elections with more than one candidate, more government transparency, more consultation with the public on policy, and increased personal responsibility directed to officials for their mistakes.

Zhao and Hu also began a large-scale anti-corruption programme, and permitted the investigations of the children of high-ranking Party elders, who had grown up protected by their parents&#x27; influence. Hu&#x27;s investigation of Party officials belonging to this &quot;Crown Prince Party&quot; made Hu unpopular with many powerful Party officials. In January 1987 a clique of Party elders forced Hu to resign, on the grounds that he had been too lenient in his response to the student protests that had taken place over the last year. After Hu&#x27;s dismissal, Deng promoted Zhao to replace Hu as CCP general secretary, putting Zhao in the position to succeed Deng as &quot;paramount leader&quot;. One month before Zhao was appointed to the position of general secretary, Zhao stated to an American reporter that &quot;I am not fit to be the general secretary... I am more fit to look after economic affairs.&quot; Zhao&#x27;s vacated premiership was in turn filled by Li Peng, a conservative who opposed many of Zhao&#x27;s economic and political reforms.

At the 13th National Party Congress in 1987, Zhao declared that China was in &quot;a primary stage of socialism&quot; that could last 100 years. Under this premise, Zhao believed that China needed to experiment with a variety of economic reforms in order to stimulate production. Zhao also proposed to separate the roles of the Party and state, a proposal that has since become taboo. In Zhao&#x27;s view, developing a state civil service separate from the Party would enhance bureaucratic efficiency, professionalism, and correct what he deemed as Party &quot;overinterference&quot; in state administration.

The 13th Congress was also notable because no women were elected to the Politburo and Central Committee secretariat; according to Zhao, the results &quot;[did not] mean [the party leadership had] adjusted [their] policies on women.&quot; According to Ellen Judd, members of women&#x27;s organizations, including the All-China Women&#x27;s Federation, attributed the reduced number of women in lower party positions to &quot;open comments&quot; by Zhao against female political participation. The number of women occupying leadership positions at various party levels had been declining since the latter half the 1970s.

Western observers generally view the year that Zhao served as general secretary as the most open in the history of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Many limitations on freedom of speech and freedom of press were relaxed, allowing intellectuals to freely express themselves, and to propose &quot;improvements&quot; for the country.

=== Introduction of the stock market and financial reforms ===
Zhao introduced the stock market in China and promoted futures trading there. In 1984, with his support, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou became experimental cities of a joint-stock system; however, some companies only issued stock to their workers. In November 1985, the first share-issuing enterprise was established in Shanghai and publicly issued 10,000 shares of 50 RMB par value stock, which attracted investors. Zhao hosted a financial meeting on 2 August 1986, calling for the joint stock system to be implemented nationwide in the following year.

Zhao played a major role in the approach to price liberalization and the question of whether China should adopt a sudden price liberalization approach akin to shock therapy or a more gradual model. &quot;Confronted with the diverse, authoritative warnings about the unforeseeable risks of imposing the shock of price reform and the uncertainty about its benefits&quot; he ultimately rejected shock price reform. Zhao had accepted the argument that the basic concern in economic reform was energizing enterprises. By late summer of 1986, what started under the rubric of &quot;coordinated comprehensive package reform&quot; had been diluted to an adjustment in the price of steel (although its price was both important and carried symbolic weight) as well as partial tax and financial reform. Zhao&#x27;s reform program in 1987 and early 1988 focused on combining enterprise contracting and a coastal development strategy.

However, Zhao&#x27;s proposal in May 1988 to accelerate price reform led to widespread complaints about rampant inflation, giving opponents of rapid reform the opportunity to call for greater centralization of economic controls and stricter prohibitions against Western influence. This precipitated a political debate, which grew more heated through the winter of 1988 to 1989.

===Relationship with party elders===
Because Zhao had risen to power through his work in the provinces, he never enjoyed strong connections among the Party leadership in Beijing. Because he had led the Communist Youth League in the 1950s, Zhao often relied on its former members for support, and Zhao&#x27;s enemies accused him of promoting a &quot;Communist Youth League faction&quot; within the CCP. Among Beijing&#x27;s Party elders, Chen Yun and Li Xiannian were notably critical of Zhao and his policies.

Despite his criticism of Zhao, Chen Yun was the Party elder most respected by Zhao, and Zhao would frequently attempt to consult with Chen before implementing new policies. Li Xiannian resented Zhao personally for Zhao&#x27;s interest in foreign culture, and his willingness to learn from economic models that had been successful outside of China. According to Zhao, Li Xiannian &quot;hated me because I was implementing Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s reforms, but since it was difficult for him to openly oppose Deng, he made me the target of the opposition.&quot;

Zhao wrote warmly of Hu Yaobang in his memoirs, and generally agreed with Hu on the direction of China&#x27;s economic reforms. Although Deng Xiaoping was Zhao&#x27;s only firm supporter among the Party elders, Deng&#x27;s support was sufficient to protect Zhao throughout Zhao&#x27;s career. As late as April 1989, one month before the dramatic end to Zhao&#x27;s career, Deng assured Zhao that he had secured the support of Chen Yun and Li Xiannian for Zhao to serve two more full terms as Party general secretary.

The second half of 1988 saw the increasing deterioration of Zhao&#x27;s political support. Zhao found himself in multi-front turf battles with the Party elders, who grew increasingly dissatisfied with Zhao&#x27;s hands-off approach to ideological matters. The conservative faction in the politburo, led by Premier Li Peng and Vice-premier Yao Yilin, were constantly at odds with Zhao in economic and fiscal policy making. Zhao was under growing pressure to combat runaway corruption by rank-and-file officials and their family members. In the beginning of 1989, it was evident that Zhao was faced with an increasingly difficult uphill battle, and he may have seen that he was fighting for his own political survival. If Zhao was unable to turn things around rapidly, a showdown with the Party conservatives would be all but inevitable. The student protests triggered by the sudden death of former CCP general secretary Hu Yaobang, widely admired as a reform-minded leader, created a crisis in which Zhao was forced into a confrontation with his political enemies.

==Tiananmen Square protests==
Zhao was general secretary for little more than a year before the death of Hu Yaobang on 15 April 1989, which, coupled with a growing sense of public outrage caused by high inflation and economic uncertainty, provided the backdrop for the large-scale protest of 1989 by students, intellectuals, and other parts of a disaffected urban population. The Tiananmen protests initially began as a spontaneous public mourning for Hu, but evolved into nationwide protests supporting political reform and demanding an end to Party corruption.

Student demonstrators, taking advantage of the loosening political atmosphere, reacted to a variety of causes of discontent. The diverse demands of protesters included greater economic liberalization, political democracy, media freedom, freedom of speech and association, rule of law, and to have the legitimacy of the movement recognized. Some protest leaders spoke against official corruption and speculation, price stability, social security, and the democratic means to supervise the reform process. Ironically, some of the original invective was also directed against Zhao. Party hard-liners increasingly came to the conclusion that the demonstrations were due to Zhao&#x27;s rapid pace of reform, which they believed caused a sense of confusion and frustration among college students. The protesters may have also been encouraged by the imminent collapse of other Communist governments in Eastern Europe.

Zhao treated the protesters sympathetically. While the protests were dying down on 26 April, Zhao was obliged (as the Party General Secretary) to leave for North Korea on a state visit. While he was away, Premier Li Peng organized a meeting between Deng Xiaoping and the Politburo Standing Committee, in which Li and his allies convinced Deng that the protests were threatening to the Party. Following the meeting, Li had the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; publish an article (which he attributed to Deng), which criticized the protests as &quot;premeditated and organized turmoil with anti-Party and anti-socialist motives.&quot; Following the publication of Li&#x27;s article, the protests grew to over 10,000 and spread to cities across China, notably including Shanghai and Guangzhou.

Zhao attempted to mollify the protesters by engaging in dialogue with student groups. He attempted to institute numerous government reforms, including the creation of a special commission to investigate government corruption; but, according to Zhao, the commission was ineffective because &quot;Li Peng and others in his group actively attempted to block, delay and even sabotage the process.&quot; Zhao attempted to arrange a meeting with Deng in order to convince him to retract Li&#x27;s &quot;April 26 article&quot;. He was granted a meeting with Deng on 17 May; but, instead of the private meeting he expected, he found that the entire Standing Committee was present. When Zhao advocated modifying the editorial, President Yang Shangkun proposed declaring martial law according to the decision of National People&#x27;s Congress, which Zhao refused. The next day, Zhao wrote a letter to Deng, suggesting he retract the 26 April editorial to reduce tensions between protesters and the government. In the letter, Zhao also warned that &quot;imposing harsh measures while a majority of people are adamantly opposed may result in serious repercussions that threaten the fate of the Party and the state.&quot; He did not receive a reply.

Deng eventually decided on declaring martial law. According to the Tiananmen Papers, the standing committee vote was split 2–2 with one abstention, and retired CCP veterans were called in to determine the vote. According to Zhao however, there was no vote, and the decision to declare martial law was illegal according to the Party&#x27;s rules.

===Speech to students===
Shortly before 5 am on 19 May, Zhao appeared in Tiananmen Square and wandered among the crowd of protesters. Using a megaphone, he delivered a now-famous speech to the students gathered at the square. It was first broadcast through China Central Television nationwide, and reported on by the Xinhua News Agency. Below is a translated version:

After a bow, people began to applaud and some students burst into tears. That was Zhao&#x27;s last public appearance, for Zhao had been ousted by party elders just before coming to the square. The phrase &quot;We are already old, and do not matter&quot; () and Zhao&#x27;s speech, have since become a well known part of the protests. What motivated Zhao&#x27;s visit remains, even today, a topic of debate. According to Wu Guoguang, Zhao&#x27;s former speechwriter, some say he went into the square hoping a conciliatory gesture would gain him leverage against hard-liners like Premier Li Peng. Others believe he supported the protesters and misjudged the risk of breaking with the leadership.

=== Aftermath ===
The protesters did not disperse. A day after Zhao&#x27;s 19 May visit to Tiananmen Square, Premier Li Peng publicly declared martial law, leading to the deaths of hundreds of protesters on the 4th of June. At the same day, Deng held another meeting with senior leaders, where he decided to remove Zhao as General Secretary, replacing him with Jiang Zemin.

Around two weeks later, from 19 to 21 June, an enlarged meeting of the Politburo was held to make decisions on the upcoming Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee. The meeting included the Party&#x27;s most influential elders, and aimed to shape the government&#x27;s response to the events of 4 June, by consolidating support for the armed crackdown and removing Zhao from office. Participants were invited to display their loyalty to Deng by endorsing two documents: Deng&#x27;s 9 June speech which justified the use of military force, and a report issued by Li Peng criticizing Zhao&#x27;s handling of the crisis. Zhao was also allowed to leave his home on 20 June to speak in his own defense. Zhao acknowledged &quot;shortcomings, errors, and mistakes&quot; in his work, but defended his economic work, and refused to accept that he &quot;supported the unrest&quot; and &quot;split the party&quot;. He also called for political reforms to remain a priority. Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong attacked Zhao by saying &quot;I feel that Comrade Ziyang is making excuses&quot;.

Party hardliners that had opposed Zhao&#x27;s reforms took the opportunity to criticize him, with elder Wang Zhen stating that Zhao lacked ideological toughness and was bringing China closer to the West. Zhao likewise received no support from his political allies, who wanted forgiveness from the leadership. Hu Qili, who was then a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, acknowledged he had sided with Zhao in opposing martial law, but said that Deng&#x27;s 9 June speech made him realize his &quot;thinking was not clear in the face of great issues of right and wrong affecting the Party&#x27;s and the state&#x27;s future and fate&quot;. Hu was subsequently purged from his position, but held several ministerial and ceremonial positions in the 1990s, along with the benefits granted to retired leaders. Zhao himself later described some of the speeches at the meeting as &quot;entirely in the style of the Cultural Revolution&quot;, saying his opponents engaged in &quot;reversing black and white, exaggerating personal offenses, taking quotes out of context, [and] issuing slanders and lies&quot;. The full details of this meeting were not made public until 2019, when transcripts from the meeting were published by New Century Press in Hong Kong, who had obtained copies from a party official.

After the fourth plenum of the 13th Central Committee on 23–24 June, Zhao was dismissed from all his positions. The plenum praised Zhao for his economic reforms, but accused him of &quot;[making] the mistake of supporting the turmoil and splitting the party&quot;, and that he had &quot;unshirkable responsibilities for the development of the turmoil&quot;. Zhao was subsequently placed under house arrest, but was allowed to maintain his party membership. Following Zhao&#x27;s dismissal, Jiang Zemin replaced Zhao as General Secretary of the CCP and successor of Deng Xiaoping. Over thirty ministers were dismissed as Zhao loyalists, and Zhao was widely criticized in the Chinese media. In the end, mentioning his name in the media was severely restricted, and he was airbrushed from photographs and deleted from textbooks.

Zhao&#x27;s rival, Li Peng, later accused Zhao of fomenting the Tiananmen Protests exclusively for political gain. According to Li, &quot;Zhao liaised with Bao Tong immediately after his arrival in Beijing (from Pyongyang). Bao gathered some other of Zhao&#x27;s supporters to hash out the situation. They feared that Zhao&#x27;s political future was at stake: Zhao did not succeed in [managing] the economy, was not stellar politically, does not have a power base of his own, and his son was suspected of illegal business dealings. As such, it was likely that Zhao would become the &#x27;scapegoat&#x27; of the student movement. These advisors suggested to Zhao that he maintain distance with Deng Xiaoping [and] attempt to win the people&#x27;s hearts in order to save himself; there were no other options.&quot; Because Zhao was never formally charged with any wrongdoing, it cannot be known what evidence Li had to support his claims.

==House arrest==

Zhao lived for the next fifteen years under house arrest, accompanied by his wife, at the No. 6 , in the Dongcheng District of central Beijing, near Zhongnanhai. Supplied by the Beijing government, the Hutong residence had once belonged to a hairdresser of the Qing Dynasty Empress Dowager Cixi, and Hu Yaobang before his death in 1989. The home was a traditional siheyuan, with three courtyards. The front courtyard consisted of an office and sleeping room, and was occupied with guards. Zhao&#x27;s study was in the second courtyard, while the innermost courtyard housed the living quarters, where Zhao lived with his wife and his daughter&#x27;s family.

Zhao remained under tight supervision, and was reportedly locked in his home with a bicycle lock. He was only allowed to leave his courtyard compound or receive visitors with permission from the highest echelons of the Party. Beginning in the 1990s, Zhao was allowed to vacation within China under watch, which included travelling to southern China to play golf, with permission from high-ranking party officials. Over that period, only a few snapshots of a gray-haired Zhao leaked out to the media.

Despite Zhao&#x27;s house arrest, no formal charges were ever laid against him, and he was not expelled from the CCP. He also retained permission to read classified documents. According to Hong Kong-based , Deng considered Zhao neither a &quot;party splittist&quot; nor a &quot;supporter of the upheaval&quot;, telling Zhao that his record was 70% good and 30% bad, similar to Deng&#x27;s own situation under Mao in 1976. Becker, however, contended in Zhao&#x27;s obituary that Deng and his subordinates &quot;certainly believed Zhao was behind the protests&quot;.

After 1989, Zhao remained ideologically estranged from the Chinese government. He remained popular among those who believed that the government was wrong in ordering the Tiananmen Massacre, and that the Party should reassess its position on the student protests. He continued to hold China&#x27;s top leadership responsible for the assault, and refused to accept the official Party line that the demonstrations had been a part of a &quot;counter-revolutionary rebellion&quot;. On at least two occasions Zhao wrote letters, addressed to the Chinese government, in which he put forward the case for a reassessment of the Tiananmen Massacre. One of those letters appeared on the eve of the 15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. The other came during a 1998 visit to China by U.S. President Bill Clinton. Neither was ever published in mainland China. Zhao eventually came to hold a number of beliefs that were much more radical than any positions he had ever expressed while in power. Zhao came to believe that China should adopt a free press, freedom of assembly, an independent judiciary, and a multiparty parliamentary democracy.

==Death==
In February 2004, Zhao had a pneumonia attack that led to a pulmonary failure, hospitalizing him for three weeks. Zhao was hospitalized again with pneumonia on 5 December 2004. Reports of his death were officially denied in early January 2005. Later, on 15 January, he was reported to be in a coma after multiple strokes. According to Xinhua, Vice President Zeng Qinghong, representing the party&#x27;s central leadership, visited Zhao in hospital. Zhao died on 17 January in a Beijing hospital at 07:01, at the age of 85. He was survived by his second wife, Liang Boqi, and five children (a daughter and four sons).

=== Government and domestic response ===
After Zhao&#x27;s death, China&#x27;s leaders feared an episode of civil disturbance similar to the events that followed the death of Hu Yaobang. In order to manage the news of Zhao&#x27;s death, the Chinese government created an &quot;Emergency Response Leadership Small Group&quot;, which declared &quot;a period of extreme sensitivity&quot;, and placed the People&#x27;s Armed Police on special alert. In order to prevent any mass demonstrations in the capital, the Emergency Group directed the Ministry of Railways to screen travellers headed to Beijing. In order to prevent any public commemoration of Zhao, Chinese authorities increased security in Tiananmen Square and at Zhao&#x27;s house. Security was also increased at universities in Beijing, with faculty members being told to monitor their students to prevent demonstrations. At the time, most university students that were interviewed by &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; knew very little about Zhao, which was linked to government censorship and restrictions on political speech.

The Chinese government also successfully directed China&#x27;s domestic TV and radio stations not to broadcast the news. The very few that were granted permission to report the story were told to refer to him only as &quot;comrade&quot; without mentioning his past leadership posts.

Under the headline &quot;Comrade Zhao Ziyang has Passed Away&quot;, Zhao&#x27;s official obituary stated, &quot;Comrade Zhao had long suffered from multiple diseases affecting his respiratory and cardiovascular systems, and had been hospitalized for medical treatment several times. His conditions worsened recently, and he passed away Monday after failing to respond to all emergency treatment.&quot; All Chinese newspapers carried exactly the same 59-word obituary on the day following his death, leaving the main means of mass dissemination through the Internet. Chinese Internet forums, including the Strong Nation Forum and forums hosted by SINA.com, Xinhua, and the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;, were flooded with messages expressing condolences for Zhao: &quot;Time will vindicate him&quot;, wrote one commenter; &quot;We will miss you forever&quot; wrote another. These messages were promptly deleted by moderators, leading to more postings attacking the moderators for their actions. The Chinese government was successful in keeping Zhao&#x27;s death fairly muted within mainland China. Open, public response was absent, though some online commenters stated that they planned to buy wreaths to mourn his death, or had stood in three minutes of silence to honour Zhao&#x27;s memory.

In Hong Kong, 10,000–15,000 people attended a candlelight vigil in remembrance of Zhao, organized by the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China. 

=== International response ===
Similar memorials were held around the world, notably in New York City and Washington, DC where American government officials and exiled political dissidents attended.

In New York City, a public memorial for Zhao was organized by Human Rights in China, a New York-based non-governmental organization. The event was held on 20 January 2005, in the basement of the Sheraton Hotel in Flushing, Queens. It was announced through the local Chinese-language press and over the Internet, which, according to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, attracted a &quot;standing-room-only crowd&quot;. Most of the speakers at the memorial were exiled Chinese dissidents and intellectuals, including Yan Jiaqi, who was Zhao&#x27;s former advisor. John Liu, then a New York City Councillor from Queens, also attended, making a speech in English.

=== Funeral and burial ===

On 29 January 2005, the government held a funeral ceremony for him at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery, a place reserved for revolutionary heroes and high government officials, that was attended by some 2,000 mourners, who were pre-approved to attend. Several dissidents, including Zhao&#x27;s secretary Bao Tong and Tiananmen Mothers leader Ding Zilin, were kept under house arrest and therefore could not attend. Xinhua reported that the most senior official to attend the funeral was Jia Qinglin, fourth in the party hierarchy, and other officials who attended included He Guoqiang, Wang Gang and Hua Jianmin. Mourners were forbidden to bring flowers or to inscribe their own messages on the government-issued flowers. There was no eulogy at the ceremony because the government and Zhao&#x27;s family could not agree on its content: while the government wanted to say he made mistakes, his family refused to accept he did anything wrong. On the day of his funeral, state television mentioned Zhao&#x27;s death for the first time. Xinhua issued a short article on the funerary arrangements, acknowledging Zhao&#x27;s &quot;contributions to the party and to the people&quot;, but said he made &quot;serious mistakes&quot; during the 1989 &quot;political disturbance&quot;. 

According to Du Daozheng, who wrote the foreword to the Chinese edition of Zhao&#x27;s memoirs, the use of the term &quot;serious mistakes&quot; instead of the former verdict of supporting a &quot;counter-revolutionary riot&quot; represented a backing down by the Party. After the ceremony, Zhao was cremated. His ashes were taken by his family to his Beijing home, since the government had denied him a place at Babaoshan. In October 2019, Zhao was finally laid to rest at the Tianshouyuan cemetery north of Beijing. Three months later, on the 15th anniversary of Zhao&#x27;s death, his son reported tightened security at the cemetery, with the addition of facial recognition surveillance cameras, ID checks and security guards patrolling Zhao&#x27;s grave. A tree was also planted in front of the grave, obstructing access to it.

== Legacy ==

===Push for rehabilitation===
After Zhao&#x27;s death, there were a number of calls in the PRC and abroad urging the PRC to reconsider Zhao&#x27;s role in history. Within mainland China, these calls were largely led by Zhao&#x27;s former secretary, Bao Tong. Outside of mainland China, Zhao&#x27;s death produced calls from the governments of Taiwan and Japan urging the PRC to move toward granting the greater political freedoms that Zhao promoted. The Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, said as part of a statement on Zhao&#x27;s death: &quot;I want them to make efforts for democratization&quot;. A representative of the ROC cabinet, Chen Chi-mai, stated that Beijing should &quot;face the truth about Tiananmen Square&quot; and &quot;push for democratic reforms&quot;. The White House praised Zhao, saying that Zhao &quot;was a man of moral courage who suffered great personal sacrifices for standing by his convictions during difficult times.&quot;

Although some of his followers have occasionally attempted to push for Zhao&#x27;s formal rehabilitation since Zhao&#x27;s arrest, the Party has been largely successful in removing his name from most public records available in China. Government efforts to delete Zhao&#x27;s memory from public consciousness include airbrushing his picture from photographs released in China, deleting his name from textbooks, and forbidding the media from mentioning him in any way. These efforts expanded to Chinese online encyclopedia Baidu Baike, which did not have an entry for Zhao. This lasted until February 2012, when the page was unblocked for unknown reasons; according to &quot;World Journal,&quot; the page received over 2 million visits in a day, before it was blocked again. However, as of December 2019 both major crowdsourced encyclopedias subject to government censorship in mainland China contain articles about the life of Zhao, omitting references to the activities surrounding his dismissal from the party and subsequent house arrest.

Since 1989, one of the few publications that has printed a non-government-approved memorial praising Zhao&#x27;s legacy has been &quot;Yanhuang Chunqiu&quot;, a magazine which released a pro-Zhao article in July 2010. The article was written by Zhao&#x27;s former aide, Yang Rudai.

===Memoirs===

On 14 May 2009, a published edition of Zhao&#x27;s memoirs was released to the public, under the English title &quot;Prisoner of the State: The Secret Journal of Premier Zhao Ziyang&quot;. The 306-page book was crafted over four years from tapes recorded in secret by Zhao while under house arrest. In the last chapter, Zhao praises the Western system of parliamentary democracy and says it is the only way China can solve its problems of corruption and a growing gap between the rich and poor.

Zhao&#x27;s published autobiography is based on approximately thirty cassette tapes which Zhao secretly recorded between 1999 and 2000. According to Zhao&#x27;s friend and former co-worker, Du Daozheng, Zhao only recorded the tapes after being convinced by his friends to do so. The tapes were smuggled out to Hong Kong by Zhao&#x27;s friends, one of which was Bao Tong. The tapes were then translated to English by his son Bao Pu, who then approached Adi Ignatius to edit the memoir in 2008. The material in his biography was largely consistent with the information from the &quot;Tiananmen Papers&quot;, an unauthorized collection of Chinese government documents published in 2001. The book was also consistent with material from &quot;Captive Conversations&quot;, a record of conversations between Zhao and his friend Zong Fengming, which was published only in Chinese.

&quot;Prisoner of the State&quot; contained minor historical errors, which commenters noted may reflect how out of touch China&#x27;s leaders are with Chinese society. Although the Beijing populace did spontaneously attempt to block Chinese troops&#x27; entrance into Beijing, Zhao&#x27;s assertion that &quot;groups of old ladies and children slept in the roads&quot; was not correct. Zhao noted that the astrophysicist Fang Lizhi (the Chinese government&#x27;s most wanted dissident following the Tiananmen Protests) was out of the country in 1989 and publicly critical of Deng Xiaoping, when in fact Fang was living just outside Beijing and deliberately kept silent about politics during the 1989 protests.

As of 2009 his memoir was being sold (in both Chinese and English) in Hong Kong but not in mainland China, though a Microsoft Word document containing the memoir&#x27;s entire Chinese-language text became available on the Internet and was downloaded widely throughout mainland China.

The recordings highlighted Zhao&#x27;s heavy Henan accent (Central Plains Mandarin), making his Mandarin at times hard to follow.

<text>In telecommunications, broadband or high speed is the wide-bandwidth data transmission that exploits signals at a wide spread of frequencies or several different simultaneous frequencies, and is used in fast Internet access. The transmission medium can be coaxial cable, optical fiber, wireless Internet (radio), twisted pair cable, or satellite.

Originally used to mean &#x27;using a wide-spread frequency&#x27; and for services that were analog at the lowest level, nowadays in the context of Internet access, &#x27;broadband&#x27; is often used to mean any high-speed Internet access that is seemingly always &#x27;on&#x27; and is faster than dial-up access over traditional analog or ISDN PSTN services.

The ideal telecommunication network has the following characteristics: &quot;broadband&quot;, &quot;multi-media&quot;, &quot;multi-point&quot;, &quot;multi-rate&quot; and economical implementation for a diversity of services (multi-services). The Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (B-ISDN) was planned to provide these characteristics. Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) was promoted as a target technology for meeting these requirements.

==Overview==
Different criteria for &quot;broad&quot; have been applied in different contexts and at different times. Its origin is in physics, acoustics, and radio systems engineering, where it had been used with a meaning similar to &quot;wideband&quot;, or in the context of audio noise reduction systems, where it indicated a single-band rather than a multiple-audio-band system design of the compander. Later, with the advent of digital telecommunications, the term was mainly used for transmission over multiple channels. Whereas a passband signal is also modulated so that it occupies higher frequencies (compared to a &quot;baseband&quot; signal which is bound to the lowest end of the spectrum, see line coding), it is still occupying a single channel. The key difference is that what is typically considered a &quot;broadband signal&quot; in this sense is a signal that occupies multiple (non-masking, orthogonal) passbands, thus allowing for much higher throughput over a single medium but with additional complexity in the transmitter/receiver circuitry.

The term became popularized through the 1990s as a marketing term for Internet access that was faster than dial-up access (dial-up being typically limited to a maximum of 56 kbit/s). This meaning is only distantly related to its original technical meaning.

Since 1999, broadband Internet access has been a factor in public policy. In that year, at the World Trade Organization Biannual Conference called “&quot;Financial Solutions to Digital Divide&quot;” in Seattle, the term “Meaningful Broadband” was introduced to the world leaders, leading to the activation of a movement to close the digital divide. Fundamental aspects of this movement are to suggest that the equitable distribution of broadband is a fundamental human right.

Personal computing facilitated easy access, manipulation, storage, and exchange of information, and required reliable data transmission. Communicating documents by images and the use of high-resolution graphics terminals provided a more natural and informative mode of human interaction than do voice and data alone. Video teleconferencing enhances group interaction at a distance. High-definition entertainment video improves the quality of pictures, but requires much higher transmission rates.

These new data transmission requirements may require new transmission means other than the present overcrowded radio spectrum. A modern telecommunications network (such as the broadband network) must provide all these different services (&quot;multi-services&quot;) to the user.

== Differences from old telephony ==
Conventional telephony communication used:
* the voice medium only,
* connected only two telephones per telephone call, and
* used circuits of fixed bit-rates.

Modern services can be:
* multimedia,
* multi-point, and
* multirate.

These aspects are examined individually in the following three sub-sections.

=== Multimedia ===
A multimedia call may communicate audio, data, still images, or full-motion video, or any combination of these media. Each medium has different demands for communication quality, such as:
* bandwidth requirement,
* signal latency within the network, and
* signal fidelity upon delivery by the network.

The information content of each medium may affect the information generated by other media. For example, voice could be transcribed into data via voice recognition, and data commands may control the way voice and video are presented. These interactions most often occur at the communication terminals, but may also occur within the network.

=== Multipoint ===
Traditional voice calls are predominantly two party calls, requiring a point-to-point connection using only the voice medium. To access pictorial information in a remote database would require a point-to-point connection that sends low bit-rate queries to the database and high bit-rate video from the database. Entertainment video applications are largely point-to-multi-point connections, requiring one way communication of full motion video and audio from the program source to the viewers. Video teleconferencing involves connections among many parties, communicating voice, video, as well as data. Offering future services thus requires flexible management of the connection and media requests of a multipoint, multimedia communication call.

=== Multirate ===
A multirate service network is one which flexibly allocates transmission capacity to connections. A multimedia network has to support a broad range of bit-rates demanded by connections, not only because there are many communication media, but also because a communication medium may be encoded by algorithms with different bit-rates. For example, audio signals can be encoded with bit-rates ranging from less than 1 kbit/s to hundreds of kbit/s, using different encoding algorithms with a wide range of complexity and quality of audio reproduction. Similarly, full motion video signals may be encoded with bit-rates ranging from less than 1 Mbit/s to hundreds of Mbit/s. Thus a network transporting both video and audio signals may have to integrate traffic with a very broad range of bit-rates.

== A single network for multiple services ==

Traditionally, different telecommunications services were carried via separate networks: voice on the telephone network, data on computer networks such as local area networks, video teleconferencing on private corporate networks, and television on broadcast radio or cable networks.

These networks were largely engineered for a specific application and are not suited to other applications. For example, the traditional telephone network is too noisy and inefficient for bursty data communication. On the other hand, data networks which store and forward messages using computers had limited connectivity, usually did not have sufficient bandwidth for digitised voice and video signals, and suffer from unacceptable delays for the real-time signals. Television networks using radio or cables were largely broadcast networks with minimum switching facilities.

It was desirable to have a single network for providing all these communication services to achieve the economy of sharing. This economy motivates the general idea of an integrated services network. Integration avoids the need for many overlaying networks, which complicates network management and reduces flexibility in the introduction and evolution of services. This integration was made possible with advances in broadband technologies and high-speed information processing of the 1990s.

While multiple network structures were capable of supporting broadband services, an ever-increasing percentage of broadband and MSO providers opted for fibre-optic network structures to support both present and future bandwidth requirements.

CATV (cable television), HDTV (high definition television), VoIP (voice over internet protocol), and broadband internet are some of the most common applications now being supported by fibre optic networks, in some cases directly to the home (FTTh – Fibre To The Home). These types of fibre optic networks incorporate a wide variety of products to support and distribute the signal from the central office to an optic node, and ultimately to the subscriber (end-user).

== Broadband technologies ==

=== Telecommunications ===
In telecommunications, a broadband signalling method is one that handles a wide band of frequencies. &quot;Broadband&quot; is a relative term, understood according to its context. The wider (or broader) the bandwidth of a channel, the greater the data-carrying capacity, given the same channel quality.

In radio, for example, a very narrow band will carry Morse code, a broader band will carry speech, and a still broader band will carry music without losing the high audio frequencies required for realistic sound reproduction. This broad band is often divided into channels or &quot;frequency bins&quot; using passband techniques to allow frequency-division multiplexing instead of sending a higher-quality signal.

In data communications, a 56k modem will transmit a data rate of 56 kilobits per second (kbit/s) over a 4-kilohertz-wide telephone line (narrowband or voiceband). In the late 1980s, the Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (B-ISDN) used the term to refer to a broad range of bit rates, independent of physical modulation details. The various forms of digital subscriber line (DSL) services are &quot;broadband&quot; in the sense that digital information is sent over multiple channels. Each channel is at a higher frequency than the baseband voice channel, so it can support plain old telephone service on a single pair of wires at the same time. However, when that same line is converted to a non-loaded twisted-pair wire (no telephone filters), it becomes hundreds of kilohertz wide (broadband) and can carry up to 100 megabits per second using very high-bit rate digital subscriber line (VDSL or VHDSL) techniques.

Modern networks have to carry integrated traffic consisting of voice, video and data. The Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (B-ISDN) was designed for these needs. The types of traffic supported by a broadband network can be classified according to three characteristics:

* Bandwidth is the amount of network capacity required to support a connection.
* Latency is the amount of delay associated with a connection. Requesting low latency in the quality of service (QoS) profile means that the cells need to travel quickly from one point in the network to another.
* Cell-delay variation (CDV) is the range of delays experienced by each group of associated cells. Low cell-delay variation means a group of cells must travel through the network without getting too far apart from one another.

Cellular networks utilize various standards for data transmission, including 5G which can support one million separate devices per square kilometer.

=== Requirements of the types of traffic ===
The types of traffic found in a broadband network (with examples) and their respective requirements are summarised in Table 1.
=== Computer networks ===
Many computer networks use a simple line code to transmit one type of signal using a medium&#x27;s full bandwidth using its baseband (from zero through the highest frequency needed). Most versions of the popular Ethernet family are given names, such as the original 1980s 10BASE5, to indicate this. Networks that use cable modems on standard cable television infrastructure are called broadband to indicate the wide range of frequencies that can include multiple data users as well as traditional television channels on the same cable. Broadband systems usually use a different radio frequency modulated by the data signal for each band.

The total bandwidth of the medium is larger than the bandwidth of any channel.

The 10BROAD36 broadband variant of Ethernet was standardized by 1985, but was not commercially successful.

The DOCSIS standard became available to consumers in the late 1990s, to provide Internet access to cable television residential customers. Matters were further confused by the fact that the 10PASS-TS standard for Ethernet ratified in 2008 used DSL technology, and both cable and DSL modems often have Ethernet connectors on them.

===TV and video===
A television antenna may be described as &quot;broadband&quot; because it is capable of receiving a wide range of channels, while e.g. a low-VHF antenna is &quot;narrowband&quot; since it receives only 1 to 5 channels. The U.S. federal standard FS-1037C defines &quot;broadband&quot; as a synonym for wideband. &quot;Broadband&quot; in analog video distribution is traditionally used to refer to systems such as cable television, where the individual channels are modulated on carriers at fixed frequencies. In this context, baseband is the term&#x27;s antonym, referring to a single channel of analog video, typically in composite form with separate baseband audio. The act of demodulating converts broadband video to baseband video. Fiber optic allows the signal to be transmitted farther without being repeated. Cable companies use a hybrid system using fiber to transmit the signal to neighborhoods and then changes the signal from light to radio frequency to be transmitted over coaxial cable to homes. Doing so reduces the use of having multiple head ends. A head end gathers all the information from the local cable networks and movie channels and then feeds the information into the system.

However, &quot;broadband video&quot; in the context of streaming Internet video has come to mean video files that have bit-rates high enough to require broadband Internet access for viewing. &quot;Broadband video&quot; is also sometimes used to describe IPTV Video on demand.

===Alternative technologies===
Power lines have also been used for various types of data communication. Although some systems for remote control are based on narrowband signaling, modern high-speed systems use broadband signaling to achieve very high data rates. One example is the ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides a way to create a local area network up to 1 Gigabit/s (which is considered high-speed as of 2014) using existing home business and home wiring (including power lines, but also phone lines and coaxial cables).

In 2014, researchers at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology made developments on the creation of ultra-shallow broadband optical instruments.

==Internet broadband==
In the context of Internet access, the term &quot;broadband&quot; is used loosely to mean &quot;access that is always on and faster than the traditional dial-up access&quot;.

A range of more precise definitions of speed have been prescribed at times, including:

* &quot;Greater than the primary rate&quot; (which ranged from about 1.5 to 2 Mbit/s) —CCITT in &quot;broadband service&quot; in 1988.
* &quot;Internet access that is always on and faster than the traditional dial-up access&quot; —US National Broadband Plan of 2009
* 4 Mbit/s downstream, 1 Mbit/s upstream —Federal Communications Commission (FCC), 2010
* 25 Mbit/s downstream, 3 Mbit/s upstream —FCC, 2015
*50 Mbit/s downstream, 10 Mbit/s upstream —Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)

Broadband Internet service in the United States was effectively treated or managed as a public utility by net neutrality rules until being overturned by the FCC in December 2017.

===Speed qualifiers===
A number of national and international regulators categorize broadband connections according to upload and download speeds, stated in Mbit/s (megabits per second).

In Australia, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also requires Internet Service Providers to quote speed during night time and busy hours 

===Global bandwidth concentration===
Bandwidth has historically been very unequally distributed worldwide, with increasing concentration in the digital age. Historically only 10 countries have hosted 70–75% of the global telecommunication capacity (see pie-chart Figure on the right). In 2014, only three countries (China, the US, and Japan) host 50% of the globally installed telecommunication bandwidth potential. The U.S. lost its global leadership in terms of installed bandwidth in 2011, being replaced by China, which hosts more than twice as much national bandwidth potential in 2014 (29% versus 13% of the global total).

<text>Christian Ernest Dior (; 21 January 1905 – 24 October 1957) was a French fashion designer and founder of one of the world&#x27;s top fashion houses, Christian Dior SE. His fashion house is known all around the world, having gained prominence &quot;on five continents in only a decade.&quot;

Dior&#x27;s skills led to his employment and design for various fashion icons in attempts to preserve the fashion industry during World War II. After the war, he founded and established the Dior fashion house, with his collection of the &quot;New Look&quot;. In 1947, the collection debuted featuring rounded shoulders, a cinched waist, and very full skirt. The New Look celebrated ultra-femininity and opulence in women&#x27;s fashion.

Throughout his lifetime, he won numerous awards for Best Costume Design. He died in 1957.

==Early life==

Dior was born in Granville, a seaside town on the coast of Normandy, France. He was the second of five children born to Maurice Dior, a wealthy fertilizer manufacturer (the family firm was Dior Frères), and his wife, formerly Madeleine Martin. He had four siblings: Raymond (father of Françoise Dior), Jacqueline, Bernard, and Catherine Dior. When Christian was about five years old, the family moved to Paris.

Dior&#x27;s family had hoped he would become a diplomat, but Dior was interested in art. To make money, he sold his fashion sketches outside his house for about 10 cents each ($ in dollars ). In 1928, he left school and received money from his father to finance a small art gallery, where he and a friend sold art by the likes of Pablo Picasso. Alongside managing his art gallery, Dior cultivated friendships with influential artists, including Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dalí, Jean Cocteau, and Alberto Giacometti. Immersed in this creative environment, Dior drew inspiration from their work, which shaped his later approach in fashion design. The gallery closed three years later, following the deaths of Dior&#x27;s mother and brother, as well as financial trouble during the Great Depression that resulted in his father losing control of the family business. Dior had no choice but to find another source of income to support himself.

In search of work, Dior again created and sold fashion sketches. Those sketches were discovered by Robert Piguet. From 1937, Dior was employed by fashion designer Piguet, who gave him the opportunity to design for three collections. Dior later said that &quot;Robert Piguet taught me the virtues of simplicity through which true elegance must come.&quot; One of his original designs for Piguet, a day dress with a short, full skirt that was in his collection called &quot;Cafe Anglais&quot;, was particularly well received. Whilst at Piguet, Dior worked alongside Pierre Balmain, and was succeeded as house designer by Marc Bohan – who would, in 1960, become head of design for Christian Dior Paris. Dior left Piguet when he was called up for military service.

In 1942, when Dior left the army, he joined the fashion house of Lucien Lelong, where he and Balmain were the primary designers. For the duration of World War II, Dior, as an employee of Lelong, designed dresses for the wives of Nazi officers and French collaborators, as did other fashion houses that remained in business during the war, including Jean Patou, Jeanne Lanvin, and Nina Ricci. His sister, Catherine (1917–2008), a member of the French Resistance, was captured by the Gestapo and sent to the Ravensbrück concentration camp, where she was incarcerated until her liberation in May 1945. In 1947, Dior named his debut fragrance Miss Dior in tribute to her.

Dior was known for being superstitious. He often consulted his astrologer before making decisions, and his collections frequently featured talismanic symbols. He also carried a cluster of lucky charms with him, believing they brought him good fortune. At a pivotal moment when industrialist Marcel Boussac offered six million francs to establish Maison Christian Dior, Dior accepted only after receiving approval from two separate clairvoyants.

==The Dior fashion house==

In 1946, Marcel Boussac, a successful entrepreneur, invited Dior to design for Philippe et Gaston, a Paris fashion house launched in 1925. Dior refused, wishing to make a fresh start under his own name rather than reviving an old brand. In 1946, with Boussac&#x27;s backing, Dior founded his fashion house, ensuring exclusive control over the company and securing a third of all profits in addition to his salary. The name of the line of his first collection, presented on 12 February 1947, was &quot;Corolle&quot; (literally the botanical term &quot;corolla&quot; or &quot;circlet of flower petals&quot; in English). Dior&#x27;s debut collection included a launch of 90 garments displayed in outfits. The phrase &quot;New Look&quot; was coined for it by Carmel Snow, the editor-in-chief of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;.

Dior&#x27;s designs were more voluptuous than the boxy, fabric-conserving shapes of the recent World War II styles that had been influenced by the wartime rationing of fabric. Despite being called &quot;New,&quot; the Corolle line was clearly drawn from styles of the Edwardian era, refining and crystallizing trends in skirt shape and waistline that had been burgeoning in high fashion since the late 1930s. The house employed Pierre Cardin as head of its tailoring atelier for the first three years of its existence, and it was Cardin who designed one of the most popular of the Corolle ensembles, the 1947 Bar suit.

The &quot;New Look&quot; revolutionized women&#x27;s dress, reestablished Paris as the centre of the fashion world after World War II, and made Dior a virtual arbiter of fashion for much of the following decade. Dior&#x27;s collection was an inspiration to many women post-war and helped them regain their love for fashion. Dior believed that fashion was more than clothing; it was an art form and a continuation of French cultural heritage. He described maintaining the tradition of fashion as &#x27;an act of faith,&#x27; a way to preserve the mystery and beauty that fashion brought to society. Each season featured a newly titled Dior &quot;line,&quot; in the manner of 1947&#x27;s &quot;Corolle&quot; line, that would be trumpeted in the fashion press: the Envol and Cyclone/Zigzag lines in 1948; the Trompe l&#x27;Oeil and Mid-Century lines in 1949; the Vertical and Oblique lines in 1950; the Oval and Longue/Princesse lines in 1951; the Sinueuse and Profilėe lines in 1952; the Tulipe and Vivante/Cupola lines in 1953; the Muguet/Lily of the Valley line and H-Line in 1954; the A-Line and Y-Line in 1955; the Flèche/Arrow/F-Line and Aimant/Magnet line in 1956; and the Libre/Free and Fuseau/Spindle lines in 1957, followed by successor Yves Saint Laurent&#x27;s Trapeze line in 1958.

Dior&#x27;s last collections, such as the “Libre” and “Fuseau” lines, marked a shift toward a more fluid, relaxed silhouette, distancing from the structured designs of earlier years. These changes reflected Dior&#x27;s response to the era&#x27;s evolving social dynamics, foreshadowing styles that would become iconic in the late 1950s and 1960s.

In 1955, 19-year-old Yves Saint Laurent became Dior&#x27;s design assistant. Dior told Saint Laurent&#x27;s mother in 1957 that he had chosen Saint Laurent to succeed him at Dior. She indicated later that she was confused by the remark, as Dior was only 52 at the time.

==Death==
Dior died of a sudden heart attack while on vacation in Montecatini, Italy, on 24 October 1957 in the late afternoon while playing a game of cards. He was survived by Jacques Benita, a North African singer three decades his junior, the last of a number of discreet male lovers.

==Awards and honors==

Dior was nominated for the 1955 Academy Award for Best Costume Design in black and white for the &quot;Terminal Station&quot; directed by Vittorio De Sica (1953). He was also nominated in 1967 for a BAFTA for Best British Costume (Colour) for the &quot;Arabesque&quot; directed by Stanley Donen (1966). For the 11th César Awards in 1986, he was nominated for Best Costume Design (Meilleurs costumes) for the 1985 film &quot;Bras de fer&quot;.

<doc id="147190" wikidata="Q850776" url="?curid=147190" title="Ground stone">
<text>In archaeology, ground stone is a category of stone tool formed by the grinding of a coarse-grained tool stone, either purposely or incidentally. Ground stone tools are usually made of basalt, rhyolite, granite, or other cryptocrystalline and igneous stones whose coarse structure makes them ideal for grinding other materials, including plants and other stones.

Organic and inorganic materials are processed on ground stones into edible products. They are sometimes the only artefacts preserved on archaeological sites and are found worldwide.

== Origin ==
The adoption of ground stone technology is associated closely with the Neolithic, also called the New Stone Age. The Stone Age comes from the three-age system developed by Christian Jürgensen Thomsen. In the Levant ground stones appear in Mesolithic 2 (Natufian). In prehistoric Japan, ground stone tools appear during the Japanese Paleolithic, possibly predating adoption elsewhere in the Neolithic by 25,000 years.

==Creation==
Ground stones were created and used for a wide variety of reasons. Each use resulted in a different development and process by which a person created their ground stone. For example, the process for creating the head of a hammer is different from the process used to create a detailed decoration piece for one’s home. That being said, some processes are basic to most ground stone making.
When choosing what type of stone to use for a ground stone tool, toughness is the most important factor. If the stone is not tough enough to withstand hard hits and instead just flakes and cracks easily, the work done to create the tool has gone to waste. A stone that will not shear, flake, or crack when tested against large impacts is the most important aspect when choosing what kind of stone to use. Examples of this kind of stone include limestone, sandstone, granite, basalt, rhyolite and other igneous and cryptocrystalline rocks.

Cryptocrystalline rocks are good to use for ground stones because they have a very fine grain structure. This is helpful because the smaller the grains are in a rock, the harder the rock is.

Holes could be ground out of stones with the use of sharp pointed stones or hardened sticks. By spinning the ground stone with one&#x27;s hands and applying substantial pressure to the sharp point into the ground stone, a hole could be drilled into the stone with a large amount of time and effort. Sand would be used to help quicken the process by putting it in the partially formed hole as the sharp point was being pressed. The sand would help grind more of the stone away. To put a hole all the way through a piece of stone, it would be first drilled half way in one direction and be finished on the opposite side.

Some ground stone tools are incidental, caused by use with other tools: manos, for example, are hand stones used in conjunction with metates and other grinding slabs (querns), and develop their ground surfaces through wear. Other ground stone tools include adzes, celts, and axes, which are manufactured using a labor-intensive, time-consuming method of repeated grinding against a harder stone or with sand, often using water as a lubricant. These tools are often made using durable finer-grained materials rather than coarse materials. In the North American arctic, tools made of ground slate were used by the Norton, Dorset, and Thule tool cultures, among others. Common forms of these tools were projectile points and ulus. These tools were often purpose-made by creating a blank, either by chipping or using a technique where the slate was sawed partway through on one or both sides and then snapped into a blank, then finished by grinding with abraders or whetstones.

==Uses==

When making the head of an axe out of stone, the piece would be made so it could be hafted. In order to have the stone hafted onto a larger piece, like wood or bone, the ground stone may have at least two notches ground out of one side of the stone, making grooves for the hafting material to lie inside. These grooves would ensure that the stone would not move when struck with a large force. Tough hide would then be wound around the handle and inside the grooves, binding the ground stone and the handle together.

Ground stones were often used as dinnerware. Using large stones, lithic reduction would be done for long periods of time to create bowls and pots for food. Jewelry, beads, ear spools and other decorative ground stones were a sign of high status due to the time and effort needed to make pieces of such small size and detail.

When mashing up seeds and leaves into powders, rounded and smooth ground stones would be used inside a stone bowl. This pair of tools is called a mortar and pestle. The material would be placed into the mortar and the pestle would be moved and pressed into the mortar to grind the material into a fine powder. This process could be used for medicine and cooking. The mortar and pestle are still used today for many cooking recipes.

==Ground stones life==

Once shaped into an active (making the action, e.g. handstones) or passive (receiving the action, e.g. slab) tool, the stone is used to process a large range of products. At the end of its life, the stone can be recycled - either reused as a ground stone, used as a construction stone, or discarded 

==Analytical methods==

In archaeology, ground stones are studied to document past activities, agriculture strategies and the process of domestication. Ground stones technology was identified as daily life technology associated with cereals processing. However, their study has shown that they are more complex to understand and have multi-function. Ethnographic studies are essential to define the research question but are not enough to correctly determine the function of ground stones. Typology, ethnographic studies and experimental replicas help understand groundstone technologies. 
Typical methods are used to analyse them: the trace of wear and the analysis of botanical residues (starch grains and phytoliths).

===Use-wear analysis===

This technique analyses the trace of wear left by the types of actions (pounding, grinding, cutting). The trace of wear is specific to the action but also the type of product (organic or inorganic) process. Handstones for cereals and hide processing were distinguished using this method.

===Botanical remains===

Starch grains and phytoliths are botanical remains which are well preserved in archaeological context and are small enough to be trapped in the micro-crevice of a ground stone. Analyzing the botanical remains is essential to precise the function of the stones. 
A standardized protocol is used to study plant remains. First, there are extracts from the ground stones, using a toothbrush and an ultrasonic bath. Then, the residues are observed under a polarised microscope. And finish, starch are compared to a reference collection of experimental modern starch grains.

<doc id="147197" wikidata="Q18927938" url="?curid=147197" title="Heechee Saga">
<text>The Heechee Saga, also known as the Gateway series, is a series of science fiction novels and short stories by Frederik Pohl. The Heechee are an advanced alien race that visited the Solar System hundreds of millennia ago and then mysteriously disappeared. They left behind bases containing artifacts, including working starships, which are discovered and exploited by humanity. 

==Plot overview==
A prospector on Venus finds an abandoned Heechee spaceship and launches it, with himself aboard. The ship automatically returns to a hollowed out asteroid within the Solar System, later named Gateway. Before he dies from lack of food and water, he manages to signal the rest of humanity his location. On Gateway is a priceless treasure: nearly a thousand small starships, many of them still functional. They come in three sizes, barely capable of carrying one, three or five passengers along with supplies.

The Gateway Corporation takes control of the asteroid on behalf of the United States of America, the Soviet Union, the New People&#x27;s Asia, the Venusian Confederation, and the United States of Brazil. Through trial and error, they figure out how to use the ships, but not well enough to set the terminus and duration of a trip. Individuals and groups are allowed to depart on these ships, risking (and often losing) their lives in the hope of finding something at their unknown destination that will make them rich.

As the series progresses, humans are able to use and sometimes reverse engineer Heechee artifacts, including a working Heechee plant that converts simple elements into food.

==Publication history==
The original Heechee novella, &quot;The Merchants of Venus&quot; (sometimes called &quot;The Merchants of Venus Underground&quot;), was published in the July–August 1972 issue of &quot;Worlds of If&quot; – or &quot;If&quot;, a magazine Pohl had edited from 1961 to 1969 – and almost simultaneously in &quot;The Gold at the Starbow&#x27;s End&quot; (Ballantine Books, 1972), a collection of short fiction by Pohl. The 1972 magazine story was illustrated by Jack Gaughan.

Five novels published from 1977 to 2004 also feature the Heechee:

* &quot;Gateway&quot;. This was serialized in &quot;Galaxy&quot; beginning November 1976, with illustrations by Vincent DiFate, and was published as a book by St. Martin&#x27;s Press in April 1977. Translations into French, German, Dutch, and Italian were all published during 1978 and 1979.
* &quot;Beyond the Blue Event Horizon&quot; (Del Rey, 1980)
* &quot;Heechee Rendezvous&quot; (Del Rey, 1984). It was serialized in &quot;Amazing Science Fiction&quot; starting in January 1984, with illustrations by Jack Gaughan.
* &quot;The Annals of the Heechee&quot; (Del Rey, 1987)
* &quot;The Boy Who Would Live Forever: A Novel of Gateway&quot; (Tor Books, 2004), which incorporated three previously published stories:
:* &quot;The Boy Who Would Live Forever&quot; (split into &quot;From Istanbul to the Stars&quot; and &quot;In the Steps of Heroes&quot;), &quot;Far Horizons&quot;, ed. Robert Silverberg (Avon Books, May 1999), pp. 295–342
:* &quot;Hatching the Phoenix&quot;, illustrated by Vincent DiFate, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, Fall 1999, pp. 32–43, and Winter 2000, pp. 84–96
:* &quot;A Home for the Old Ones&quot;, &quot;Science Fiction: DAW 30th Anniversary&quot; (DAW Books, May 2002), pp. 159–74

In 1990, nine new short stories were published in the first three 1990 issues of &quot;Aboriginal Science Fiction&quot;. These, and &quot;The Merchants of Venus&quot;, made up the collection, &quot;The Gateway Trip: Tales and Vignettes of the Heechee&quot; (Del Rey Books); both the serial and the book, also released in 1990, were illustrated by Frank Kelly Freas.

A German-language edition of the first three novels was published 20 years later as &quot;The Gateway Trilogy&quot;: &quot;Die Gateway-Trilogie&quot; (Munich: Heyne Verlag, 2004).

==Other media==
&quot;Gateway&quot;, a series of two video games, was released in 1992 and 1993 by Legend Entertainment.

On January 6, 2019; Skybound Entertainment announced that they have reached an agreement to option Frederik Pohl’s 1977 science fiction novel, &quot;Gateway&quot;. The deal includes all other volumes in the Heechee saga. Although without a time frame for it, Skybound plans to produce a TV series based on &quot;Gateway&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;Gateway&quot;, the first novel and second publication in the series, won four major awards as the year&#x27;s best English-language speculative fiction or science fiction novel: the 1978 Hugo Award for Best Novel, the 1978 Locus Award for Best Novel, the 1977 Nebula Award for Best Novel, and the 1978 John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; stated that &quot;Since it began with the novel Gateway (1977), Pohl&#x27;s Heechee series has been among the most consistently daring of SF&#x27;s continuing enterprises&quot;.

<doc id="147202" wikidata="Q2107863" url="?curid=147202" title="Cape Gelidonya">
<text>Cape Gelidonya (, from , &quot;Chelidonia&quot;; ), formerly Kilidonia or Killidonia is a cape or headland on the Teke Peninsula in the chain of Taurus Mountains, located on the southern coast of Anatolia between the Gulf of Antalya and the Bay of Finike.

During the classical Greek and Hellenistic eras, it was called Chelidonia (meaning swallows), and a group of five small islands, as Chelidoniai nesoi (Swallow Islands, now Beşadalar Adasi). In Roman times, it was known as &quot;Promontorium Sacrum&quot; (Latin for &quot;Holy Promontory&quot;), and the group of islands as Chelidoniae Insulae.

==Bronze Age shipwreck==
The cape is the site of a late Bronze Age shipwreck (c. 1200 BC). In view of the cargo&#x27;s nature and composition the findings are of a Mycenean Greek provenance. The remains of the ship sat at a depth of about , on irregular rocky bottom. It was located in 1954, and the excavation began in 1960 by Peter Throckmorton, George F. Bass, Joan du Plat Taylor and Frédéric Dumas. Among the finds were Mycenaean pottery, scrape copper, copper and tin ingots, and merchant weights.

===Discovery and excavation===
The eccentric photojournalist Peter Throckmorton, out of New York, arrived there in the mid-1950s after a controversial campaign where he was profiling the Algerian War from the point of view of the Algerian rebels fighting against French troops, which would later lead to an alleged altercation between himself and another team member, Claude Duthuit, who was fighting with the French. Throckmorton arrived in the small city of Bodrum in the southwest of Turkey, built on the ancient city of Halicarnassus, where the remnants of one of the ancient wonders of the world, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, can still be seen today. He had received word that a bronze statue of the Greek goddess Demeter was pulled up by fishing nets and left on the beach, but by the time he had arrived the statue was taken and would eventually find a home in the Museum of İzmir, north of Bodrum.

Throckmorton came to know Captain Kemal of the &quot;Mandlinci&quot;, a sponge fishing boat. The captain told Throckmorton that he knew of many ancient sites that were lying on the seabed, one of which he planned to dynamite the following year. Throckmorton urged him to preserve the site and convinced the Captain to draw a map, allegedly on the back of a napkin. He would return in 1958 under the flag of the Explorers&#x27; Club, with filmmaker Stan Waterman among others, including Honor Frost. They set out to visit a number of underwater archaeological sites and finally arrived at Cape Gelidonya, where they spent most of their time trying to identify the site. Finally, on the last day, they located the site on one of the small islands off the Cape.

Throckmorton convinced the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology to sponsor an excavation of the site, while Frost convinced Joan du Plat Taylor to be a co-director with whoever Throckmorton found. At this time, the young archaeologist George Bass was working on his PhD at the university and was sent to co-direct the archaeological excavation of the site. Neither co-director had completed a diving qualification before they arrived but Bass had some practice in a YMCA pool and knew how to swim. He was also much younger than Taylor, who was well-known and respected within the archaeological community. The group of divers arrived in 1960 and began to complete the first archaeological excavation of an underwater shipwreck in its entirety, though divers still find missed artefacts on occasion. The British side of the expedition is generally written out of history because most of the funding came from America.

This was the oldest known shipwreck at the time, only being surpassed by the discovery of the Uluburun shipwreck in the early 1980s. This was one of the first projects that led to the development of the field of nautical archaeology, along with the excavation of the Viking Skuldelev ships at Roskilde in 1962, and the discovery and raising of the Swedish warship the &quot;Vasa&quot; in 1961.

=== Medical uses ===
* Pharmaceutical-grade PEG is used as an excipient in many pharmaceutical products, in oral, topical, and parenteral dosage forms.
* PEG is the basis of a number of laxatives (as &quot;MiraLax, RestoraLAX, MoviPrep, etc.&quot;). Whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol and added electrolytes is used for bowel preparation before surgery or colonoscopy or for children with constipation. Macrogol (with brand names such as Laxido, Movicol and Miralax) is the generic name for polyethylene glycol used as a laxative. The name may be followed by a number that represents the average molecular weight (e.g. macrogol 3350, macrogol 4000, or macrogol 6000).
* The possibility that PEG could be used to fuse axons is being explored by researchers studying peripheral nerve and spinal cord injury.
*An example of PEG hydrogels (see Biological uses section) in a therapeutic has been theorized by Ma et al. They propose using the hydrogel to address periodontitis (gum disease) by encapsulating stem cells in the gel that promote healing in the gums. The gel with encapsulated stem cells was to be injected into the site of disease and crosslinked to create the microenvironment required for the stem cells to function.
*PEGylation of adenoviruses for gene therapy can help prevent adverse reactions due to pre-existing adenovirus immunity.
* A PEGylated lipid is used as an excipient in both the Moderna and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Both RNA vaccines consist of messenger RNA, or mRNA, encased in a bubble of oily molecules called lipids. Proprietary lipid technology is used for each. In both vaccines, the bubbles are coated with a stabilizing molecule of polyethylene glycol. PEG could trigger allergic reaction, and allergic reactions are the driver for both the United Kingdom and Canadian regulators to issue an advisory, noting that: two &quot;individuals in the U.K. ... were treated and have recovered&quot; from anaphylactic shock. The US CDC stated that in their jurisdiction six cases of &quot;severe allergic reaction&quot; had been recorded from more than 250,000 vaccinations, and of those six only one person had a &quot;history of vaccination reactions&quot;.

===Chemical uses===
* Polyethylene glycol can serve as a green reaction medium in a variety of organic reactions.
* Polyethylene glycol is also commonly used as a polar stationary phase for gas chromatography, as well as a heat transfer fluid in electronic testers.
* PEG is frequently used to preserve waterlogged wood and other organic artifacts that have been salvaged from underwater archaeological contexts, as was the case with the warship &quot;Vasa&quot; in Stockholm, and similar cases. It replaces water in wooden objects, making the wood dimensionally stable and preventing the warping or shrinking of the wood when it dries. In addition, PEG is used when working with green wood as a stabilizer, and to prevent shrinkage.
* PEG has been used to preserve the painted colors on Terracotta Warriors unearthed at a UNESCO World Heritage site in China. These painted artifacts were created during the Qin Shi Huang (first emperor of China) era. Within 15 seconds of the terra-cotta pieces being unearthed during excavations, the lacquer beneath the paint begins to curl after being exposed to the dry Xi&#x27;an air. The paint would subsequently flake off in about four minutes. The German Bavarian State Conservation Office developed a PEG preservative that when immediately applied to unearthed artifacts has aided in preserving the colors painted on the pieces of clay soldiers.
* PEG is often used (as an internal calibration compound) in mass spectrometry experiments, with its characteristic fragmentation pattern allowing accurate and reproducible tuning.
* PEG derivatives, such as narrow range ethoxylates, are used as surfactants.
* PEG has been used as the hydrophilic block of amphiphilic block copolymers used to create some polymersomes.
*PEG is a component of the propellent used in UGM-133M Trident II Missiles, in service with the United States Navy.
* PEG has been used as a solvent for aryl thioether synthesis.
===Biological uses===
*An example study was done using PEG-diacrylate hydrogels to recreate vascular environments with the encapsulation of endothelial cells and macrophages. This model furthered vascular disease modeling and isolated macrophage phenotype&#x27;s effect on blood vessels. 
*PEG is commonly used as a crowding agent in &quot;in vitro&quot; assays to mimic highly crowded cellular conditions. Although polyethylene glycol is considered biologically inert, it can form non-covalent complexes with monovalent cations such as Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+, affecting equilibrium constants of biochemical reactions.
* PEG is commonly used as a precipitant for plasmid DNA isolation and protein crystallization. X-ray diffraction of protein crystals can reveal the atomic structure of the proteins.
* PEG is used to fuse two different types of cells, most often B-cells and myelomas to create hybridomas. César Milstein and Georges J. F. Köhler originated this technique, which they used for antibody production, winning a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1984.
* In microbiology, PEG precipitation is used to concentrate viruses. PEG is also used to induce complete fusion (mixing of both inner and outer leaflets) in liposomes reconstituted &quot;in vitro&quot;.
* Gene therapy vectors (such as viruses) can be PEG-coated to shield them from inactivation by the immune system and to de-target them from organs where they may build up and have a toxic effect. The size of the PEG polymer is important, with larger polymers achieving the best immune protection.
* PEG is a component of stable nucleic acid lipid particles (SNALPs) used to package siRNA for use &quot;in vivo&quot;.
* In blood banking, PEG is used as a potentiator to enhance detection of antigens and antibodies.
* When working with phenol in a laboratory situation, PEG 300 can be used on phenol skin burns to deactivate any residual phenol.
* In biophysics, polyethylene glycols are the molecules of choice for the functioning ion channel diameter studies, because in aqueous solutions they have a spherical shape and can block ion channel conductance.

===Commercial uses===
* PEG is the basis of many skin creams (as &quot;cetomacrogol&quot;) and personal lubricants.
* PEG is used in a number of toothpastes as a dispersant. In this application, it binds water and helps keep xanthan gum uniformly distributed throughout the toothpaste.
* PEG is under investigation for use in liquid body armor, and in tattoos to monitor diabetes.
* Polymer segments derived from PEG polyols impart flexibility to polyurethanes for applications such as elastomeric fibers (spandex) and foam cushions.
* In low-molecular-weight formulations (e.g. PEG 400), it is used in Hewlett-Packard designjet printers as an ink solvent and lubricant for the print heads.
* PEG is used as an anti-foaming agent in food and drinks – its INS number is 1521 or E1521 in the EU.

===Industrial uses===
* A nitrate ester-plasticized polyethylene glycol (NEPE-75) is used in Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile solid rocket fuel.
* Dimethyl ethers of PEG are the key ingredient of Selexol, a solvent used by coal-burning, integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plants to remove carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from the syngas stream.
* PEG has been used as the gate insulator in an electric double-layer transistor to induce superconductivity in an insulator.
* PEG is used as a polymer host for solid polymer electrolytes. Although not yet in commercial production, many groups around the globe are engaged in research on solid polymer electrolytes involving PEG, to improve their properties, and in permitting their use in batteries, electro-chromic display systems, and other products in the future.
* PEG is injected into industrial processes to reduce foaming in separation equipment.
* PEG is used as a binder in the preparation of technical ceramics.
* PEG was used as an additive to silver halide photographic emulsions.
* PEG is used as an active ingredient in agricultural soil wetter, which improves water-retention and seedling growth.

===Entertainment uses===
* PEG is used to extend the size and durability of very large soap bubbles.
* PEG is an ingredient in some personal lubricants. (Not to be confused with propylene glycol.)
* PEG is the main ingredient in the paint (known as &quot;fill&quot;) in paintballs.

== Human health effects ==

PEO&#x27;s have &quot;very low single dose oral toxicity&quot;, on the order of tens of grams per kilogram of human body weight when ingested by mouth. Because of its low toxicity, PEO is used in a variety of edible products. It is also used as a lubricating coating for various surfaces in aqueous and non-aqueous applications.

The precursor to PEGs is ethylene oxide, which is hazardous. Ethylene glycol and its ethers are nephrotoxic (poisonous to the kidneys) if applied to damaged skin.

The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA or US FDA) regards PEG as biologically inert and safe. 

A 2015 study appears to challenge the FDA&#x27;s conclusion. In the study, a high-sensitivity ELISA assay detected anti-PEG antibodies in 72% of random blood plasma samples collected from 1990 to 1999. According to the study&#x27;s authors, this result suggests that anti-PEG antibodies may be present, typically at low levels, in people who were never treated with PEGylated drugs. Due to its ubiquity in many products and the large percentage of the population with antibodies to PEG, which indicates an allergic reaction, hypersensitive reactions to PEG are an increasing health concern. Allergy to PEG is usually discovered after a person has been diagnosed with an allergy to several seemingly unrelated products—including processed foods, cosmetics, drugs, and other substances—that contain or were manufactured with PEG.

==Available forms and nomenclature==
&quot;PEG&quot;, &quot;PEO&quot;, and &quot;POE&quot; refer to an oligomer or polymer of ethylene oxide. The three names are chemically synonymous, but historically &quot;PEG&quot; is preferred in the biomedical field, whereas &quot;PEO&quot; is more prevalent in the field of polymer chemistry. Because different applications require different polymer chain lengths, &quot;PEG&quot; has tended to refer to oligomers and polymers with a molecular mass below 20,000g/mol, &quot;PEO&quot; to polymers with a molecular mass above 20,000g/mol, and &quot;POE&quot; to a polymer of any molecular mass. PEGs are prepared by polymerization of ethylene oxide and are commercially available over a wide range of molecular weights from 300g/mol to 10,000,000g/mol.

PEG and PEO are liquids or low-melting solids, depending on their molecular weights. While PEG and PEO with different molecular weights find use in different applications and have different physical properties (e.g. viscosity) due to chain length effects, their chemical properties are nearly identical. Different forms of PEG are also available, depending on the initiator used for the polymerization process – the most common initiator is a monofunctional methyl ether PEG, or methoxypoly(ethylene glycol), abbreviated mPEG. Lower-molecular-weight PEGs are also available as purer oligomers, referred to as monodisperse, uniform, or discrete. Very high-purity PEG has recently been shown to be crystalline, allowing the determination of a crystal structure by x-ray crystallography. Since purification and separation of pure oligomers is difficult, the price for this type of quality is often 10–1000 fold that of polydisperse PEG.

PEGs are also available with different geometries.
* &quot;Branched&quot; PEGs have three to ten PEG chains emanating from a central core group.
* &quot;Star&quot; PEGs have 10 to 100 PEG chains emanating from a central core group.
* &quot;Comb&quot; PEGs have multiple PEG chains normally grafted onto a polymer backbone.

The numbers that are often included in the names of PEGs indicate their average molecular weights (e.g. a PEG with would have an average molecular weight of approximately 400 daltons, and would be labeled PEG 400). Most PEGs include molecules with a distribution of molecular weights (i.e. they are polydisperse). The size distribution can be characterized statistically by its weight average molecular weight (&quot;M&quot;w) and its number average molecular weight (&quot;M&quot;n), the ratio of which is called the polydispersity index (&quot;Đ&quot;M). &quot;M&quot;w and &quot;M&quot;n can be measured by mass spectrometry.

PEGylation is the act of covalently coupling a PEG structure to another larger molecule, for example, a therapeutic protein, which is then referred to as a &quot;PEGylated&quot; protein. PEGylated interferon alfa-2a or alfa-2b are commonly used injectable treatments for hepatitis C infection.

PEG is soluble in water, methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, benzene, and dichloromethane, and is insoluble in diethyl ether and hexane. It is coupled to hydrophobic molecules to produce non-ionic surfactants.

PEG and related polymers (PEG phospholipid constructs) are often sonicated when used in biomedical applications. However, as reported by Murali et al., PEG is very sensitive to sonolytic degradation and PEG degradation products can be toxic to mammalian cells. It is, thus, imperative to assess potential PEG degradation to ensure that the final material does not contain undocumented contaminants that can introduce artifacts into experimental results.

PEGs and methoxypolyethylene glycols are manufactured by Dow Chemical under the trade name &quot;Carbowax&quot; for industrial use, and &quot;Carbowax Sentry&quot; for food and pharmaceutical use. They vary in consistency from liquid to solid, depending on the molecular weight, as indicated by a number following the name. They are used commercially in numerous applications, including foods, cosmetics, pharmaceutics, biomedicine, dispersing agents, solvents, ointments, suppository bases, as tablet excipients, and as laxatives. Some specific groups are lauromacrogols, nonoxynols, octoxynols, and poloxamers.

==Production==

The production of polyethylene glycol was first reported in 1859. Both A. V. Lourenço and Charles Adolphe Wurtz independently isolated products that were polyethylene glycols. Polyethylene glycol is produced by the interaction of ethylene oxide with water, ethylene glycol, or ethylene glycol oligomers. The reaction is catalyzed by acidic or basic catalysts. Ethylene glycol and its oligomers are preferable as a starting material instead of water because they allow the creation of polymers with a low polydispersity (narrow molecular weight distribution). Polymer chain length depends on the ratio of reactants.

:HOCH2CH2OH + n(CH2CH2O) → HO(CH2CH2O)n+1H

Depending on the catalyst type, the mechanism of polymerization can be cationic or anionic. The anionic mechanism is preferable because it allows one to obtain PEG with a low polydispersity. Polymerization of ethylene oxide is an exothermic process. Overheating or contaminating ethylene oxide with catalysts, such as alkalis or metal oxides, can lead to runaway polymerization, which can end in an explosion after a few hours.

Polyethylene oxide, or high-molecular-weight polyethylene glycol, is synthesized by suspension polymerization. It is necessary to hold the growing polymer chain in solution in the course of the polycondensation process. The reaction is catalyzed by magnesium-, aluminium-, or calcium-organoelement compounds. To prevent coagulation of polymer chains from solution, chelating additives, such as dimethylglyoxime, are used.

Alkaline catalysts, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), or sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), are used to prepare low-molecular-weight polyethylene glycol.

<text>Hermosillo (), formerly called Pitic (as in &quot;Santísima Trinidad del Pitic&quot; and &quot;Presidio del Pitic&quot;), is a city in the center of the northwestern Mexican state of Sonora. It is the municipal seat of the Hermosillo municipality, the state&#x27;s capital and largest city, as well as the primary economic center for the state and the region. As of 2020, the city has a population of 936,263, making it the 18th largest city in Mexico. The recent increase in the city&#x27;s population is due to expanded industrialization, especially within the automotive industry.

Hermosillo was ranked as one of the five best cities to live in, in Mexico, as published in the study &quot;The Most Livable Cities of Mexico 2013&quot; by the Strategic Communications Cabinet of the Mexican Federal Government. Hermosillo was also ranked in 2016 as the seventh most competitive city in the country according to the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness (IMCO), based on factors such as its economic diversification, geographical location, access to education, government, innovation and international relations. The major manufacturing sector has been the production of automobiles since the 1980s. It is one of the richest cities in Mexico by GDP per capita.

Hermosillo has a subtropical hot desert climate (&quot;BWh&quot;). Temperatures have been as high as in the summer months, making it one of the hottest cities in the country.

==History==

Evidence from a site called the San Dieguito Complex, located in the El Pinacate Zone, suggests the area has been inhabited by humans for about 3,000 years. Evidence of agriculture dates back 2,500 years. In the pre-Hispanic era, this area was inhabited by the historic Seri, Tepoca, and Pima peoples.

The first encounter between the Spanish and the indigenous peoples of the area occurred in the middle of the 16th century, when European explorers came in search of gold. The Spanish explorers were followed by Jesuit missionaries in the state of Sonora around 1614. Eusebio Francisco Kino arrived in 1687, founding a mission in nearby Cucurpe. The present-day states of Sonora and Sinaloa were loosely organized as the provinces of Sonora, Ostimuri, and Sinaloa.

In 1700, three small Spanish villages were founded in what is now the outskirts of Hermosillo: Nuestra Señora del Pópulo, Nuestra Señora de Los Angeles, and la Santísima Trinidad del Pitic. The native peoples here soon became hostile to the colonists and repeatedly drove them out in the early 18th century. In 1716, the Spanish offered irrigated lands for farmers to the native peoples, who agreed to abide by Spanish law. Around 1726, a fort named the Presidio of Pitic was constructed to stop the domination of this area by the natives, especially the Seri. However, the situation remained contentious. The first church was not built until 1787, and the first formal parish was not established until 1822.

During the Mexican War of Independence, Sonora and the town of Pitic stayed loyal to the Spanish Crown. Local general Alejo García Conde defeated insurgent José María González Hermosillo, who had been sent by Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla. Following independence from Spain, in 1825 the village of Pitic was made the seat of the department of the same name. In 1828, the settlement changed its name to Hermosillo to honor the insurgent leader José María González de Hermosillo.

A battle between imperial and republican forces occurred in 1866 during the French Intervention in Mexico. In 1879, the capital of the state of Sonora was moved from Arizpe to Hermosillo. In 1881 the railroad linking Hermosillo with Guaymas and Nogales was finished, allowing for economic expansion in the area by bringing in mining equipment and modern agricultural equipment. Since then, the city has been an economic center for northwest Mexico.

During the Mexican Revolution, beginning in 1910, forces loyal to Pancho Villa were expelled from the city by General Manuel M. Diéguez. After the assassination of Francisco I. Madero in 1913, Venustiano Carranza, then governor of Coahuila, sought refuge in Hermosillo. Here, Carranza began the Constitutionalist Movement. As a result, Hermosillo is nicknamed the &quot;revolutionary capital of the country.&quot;

From the late 19th century, until around 1920, Chinese immigrants entered the state of Sonora as laborers. A significant number settled in the city of Hermosillo. Some of these immigrants established businesses, especially shoe manufacturing and clothing. Some of the most successful Chinese-owned businesses in Sonora were based in Hermosillo, and sold their merchandise to other parts of the country. But by the 1920s, anti-Chinese sentiment had become strong in Sonora state, and many Chinese left for Mexico City or the United States.

In the 1980s, Ford Motor Company built a plant. This strongly influenced the city and state economy.

Hermosillo was the site of a tragic fire, at the ABC Child Care Center, on June 5, 2009. According to the Procuraduría General de Justicia en el Estado (State Attorney General Office) de Sonora, the fire resulted in 49 deaths at the center; nearly half of them were children. The fire is believed to have started at an adjacent automobile shop, before spreading to the child care center. Most of the children died of asphyxiation. There were about a hundred children inside the building. Firefighters had to smash holes in the walls to rescue the children, who ranged in age from six months to five years.

=== Origins ===
The origin of Hermosillo dates to the 1700s, when the mission villages of Our Lady of The Populace, Our Lady of Angels, and the Holy Trinity of Pitic were founded. They collected members of the Yaqui, Seri, Tepoca, and Pima Bajo peoples.

Years earlier, internal difficulties had occurred between the Tepoca and the Bajo Pima peoples. The Spanish wanted to bring them into the mission villages to have more control over their work.

The villages and city were intended to contain the Seri and Tepoca Indians, to protect the Hispanic expansion. It was called the Real Presidio de San Pedro de la Conquista, named after Viceroy Don Pedro de Castro y Figueroa, Duke of the Conquest and Marquis of Grace. The explorer in charge of the foundation of the peoples was , who pacified tensions.

On May 18, 1700, he gave a speech that was documented, in part: 
&quot;Sending them to have no wars from now on, but to live as Christians and to deal with each other with fairs of the clothes of their use and seeds of their plantings, to which they responded from one and the other, which they would do thank ingsands thank ing best for the good that they made peace of way.&quot;

In 1718, on the orders of Governor Manuel de San Juan y Santa Cruz, the town of the Holy Trinity of Pitic was repopulated; on September 29, 1725, the Seri settled in the Pópulo rose in the son of war and invaded the people of Opodepe. The Seri were persecuted for the purpose of punishing them until they signed the peace in January 1726, and they were settled in the Porplo and in the points called Alares and Moraga; subsequently given the uncertainty due to the bellicoseness of the indigenous, the Pitic presidio was formed.

====Presidio de San Pedro de la Conquista del Pitic====
In June 1741, Don Agustin de Vildósola established the Presidio de San Pedro de la Conquista del Pitic.
Nine years later, the troops of the Pupium were transferred to El Pópulo, in the present municipality of San Miguel de Horcasitas. As a result of this action, Pitic was left in a very precarious situation, because numerous residents emigrated for fear of the Seri.

While the Presidio&#x27;s settlement was about to disappear, senior authorities ordered a group of soldiers to remain on site to ensure the safety of the settlers. In 1772, the mayor Pedro de Corbalán ordered the construction of a canal on the left bank of the Rio Sonora, to irrigate the lands and orchards.

Pitic&#x27;s Villa .A.
Before the end of the eighteenth century the former Presidio of San Pedro de la Conquista del Pitic became Villa del Pitic.

On February 9, 1825, the Villa del Pitic was established as the head of the party, dependent on the Department of Horcasitas. This coincided with the urbanization that the royal surveyors gave it, as it progressed steadily.

In 1827, the city had approximately eight thousand inhabitants, and its urbanization was very particular, as the houses were scattered in all directions. The region was fertile, well-cultivated and provided an abundance of what was necessary for life and even many luxuries. Already then it was very cheap, high-quality beef that to this day is famous.

====The Village of Hermosillo====
On September 5, 1828, by decree no. 77 of the H. Legislature of the State of the West, the name &quot;Villa del Pitic&quot; was deleted and the name of the &quot;City of Hermosillo&quot; was imposed, in honor of the general jalisciense José María González de Hermosillo who in the late 1810s had carried the task of the national insurrection to lands Sinaloenses, then part of the Western State as well.

On March 12, 1831, the State of Sonora was founded and Hermosillo was its first capital from 14 May of that year to May 25, 1832, when the capital powers were transferred to the city of Arizpe. In 1837, the city was erected at the head of the district of its name. On the same date, Don Pascual Iñigo began the construction of the Chapel of Our Lady of Carmen.

On October 14, 1852, in the city, a section of filibusters under the command of Gastón de Raousset-Boulbon faced and defeated the national forces, who were under the leadership of General Miguel Blanco de Estrada; this was part of a revolutionary campaign of independence that was intended however to turn Sonora and Lower California into colonial territories of France. However, Raousset remained only a few days in the city, choosing to go to Guaymas to continue his campaign where he would eventually be defeated by General José María Yáñez Carrillo in Battle of Guaymas in 1854.

On May 4, 1866, under the Second Mexican Empire of Maximilian of Habsburg, republican troops commanded by the general attacked and seized the city, which was being defended by the Second Mexican Empire under Colonel María Tranquilino Almada. However, a few hours later, it fell back into the hands of the forces of the Second Empire. On November 13, 1866, General Martinez again took the city in blood and fire, causing the imperialists to flee; but they returned and regained it eight days later.

In 1879 Hermosillo was once again the headquarters of state powers, thanks to the management of the acting governor Don Francisco Serna, at least on an interim date. However, when the new Political Constitution of the State of Sonora was issued on September 15, 1917, it was definitively confirmed that the city of Hermosillo is the headquarters of the state powers, as referred to in article 28 thereof.

On November 4 in front of the wooden station of Sonora, dozens of people gathered at the opening of the Guaymas-Hermosillo railway section. On the train came Don Carlos Rodrigo Ortiz Retes, accompanied by the commander of the Military Zone, brigadier Colonel José Guillermo Carbó. Months later, both cargo and passenger service would be established between Guaymas and the Noals.

===20th century===

At the beginning of the 20th century, Hermosillo had about 14,000 inhabitants. During the Mexican Revolution, forces loyal to Francisco &#x27;Pancho&#x27; Villa were expelled from the city by General Manuel M. Diéguez. After the assassination of Francisco I. Madero in 1913, Venustiano Carranza, then governor of Coahuila sought refuge in Hermosillo. Here Carranza began the Constitutionalist Movement; because of this, Hermosillo has the nickname &quot;&quot;the revolutionary capital of the country&#x27;&quot;.

In the late 19th century and the first two decades of the 20th century, Chinese immigrants arrived in Sonora. One of the settlements with a significant number was the city of Hermosillo. Some of these immigrants had money and used it to set up businesses, especially shoe and clothing manufacturing. Some of the most successful businesses with Chinese owners in Sonora were in Hermosillo and sold merchandise to other parts of the country. However, in the 1920s, sentiment against the Chinese population in Sonora grew, resulting in many fleeing to Mexico City or the United States.

In the 1980s, Ford built Hermosillo Stamping &amp; Assembly in the city, which had a major impact on the city&#x27;s economy and that of the state. A whole chain of suppliers was also developed around the assembly plant, which further contributed to economic growth in Hermosillo. Hermosillo was selected partly due to its proximity to the United States.

===21st century===

In 2000, the businessman Pancho Búrquez was elected as municipal president for National Action Party, in that triennium, the municipality won national awards (such as that of the Secretariat of Comptroller ship and Administrative Development of the federal government, as well as of the International City/County Management Association as one of the most transparent cities in the world. Investment grew in the early decade thanks to the ease of doing business.

One of the most important events in Hermosillo was the ABC Nursery Fire on June 5, 2009. According to the Attorney General&#x27;s Office of the State of Sonora, there were 49 deaths in the fire. The fire apparently began in a warehouse, then expanded to the daycare. Most of the children died of asphyxiation. There were about 100 children inside the building; firefighters and the population had to make holes in the walls to rescue the children, ranging from six months to five years.

The fire caused a stir both nationally and internationally. As a result of these events, on June 3, 2010, a decree was published in the Official Journal of the Federation declaring June 5 a Day of national mourning. The National Flag is flown at half-mast on June 5 of each year. Parents of victims and citizen organizations annually remind the nation by releasing pink and blue balloons on behalf of the nursery children who died. Changes were made in the General Law on Provision of Services for Child Care, Care and Integral Child Development, a legal framework that regulates the operation of nurseries at the national level, to ensure the tragedy would not be repeated. The changed standard was published in the [Official Journal of the Federation], on October 27, 2011.

==Geography==

As the municipal seat, the city of Hermosillo is the local government of over 3,800 other localities, with a combined territory of .

The two most important rivers are the Sonora and the San Miguel. Both of these are used for irrigation purposes with the Abelardo L. Rodriguez Dam located on the San Miguel River. The population increase of the municipality, currently at 2.5% annually, puts pressure on the infrastructure of the city, especially its water supply. Decades of overpumping of ground water have led to the aquifer levels being lower than sea levels, and sea water creeping in as an &quot;artificial recharge.&quot;

===Climate and ecology===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Hermosillo features a borderline hot arid (&quot;BWh&quot;)/hot semi-arid (&quot;BSh&quot;) climate. Temperatures can range from as low as freezing in December and January to in June and July. Rain falls mostly between July and September, with annual precipitation between . Hermosillo&#x27;s all-time weather record for high temperature is , which was achieved in June 2014. In recent years, the lowest temperature was , in December.

Most of the regional flora consists of mesquite trees, with an added mixture of blue agave, desert ironwood, palo verde and the huisache. Native fauna includes the desert tortoise, several species of rattlesnake and kingsnake, mule deer (locally called ‘coues’ deer), collared peccary, ringtail, ocelot, puma, desert bighorn sheep, opossum, raccoon, coyote, and bobcat. Black bear may be observed on occasion, on the fringes of settled areas. In August 2022, the once-common jaguar was finally witnessed in the Hermosillo area. Locals nicknamed the lone male “El Jefe”, meaning “boss”. The critically endangered Sonoran pronghorn antelope was once common in the area; less than 200 are thought to exist today, with an additional -200 (declining) surviving in the U.S. state of Arizona. Populations of feral red-masked parakeets and monk parakeets are a local sightseeing attraction here.

==Demographics==

According to the results of INEGI, Hermosillo is Mexico&#x27;s 16th largest city, with 812,229 people. Other important communities in the municipality include Miguel Alemán (30,869), Bahía Kino (6,050), San Pedro el Saucito (2,938), El Tazajal (2,062), La Victoria (1,966), Zamora (1,049), and Mesa Del Seri (908). The recent city population spur is due to its recent strong industrialization, especially in the automotive industry and its providers.

==Economy==

Most of the municipality&#x27;s population lives in the city proper, with most jobs located in the manufacturing and commerce sectors here. About 250,000 hectares are under cultivation in the city&#x27;s outskirts, most of which is near the coast. Crops include wheat, grapes, flowers, chickpeas, alfalfa and walnuts. Livestock has been traditionally important here, especially beef cattle. Pigs, sheep, goats, horses, domestic fowl and bees are also raised here as well. Fishing is practiced along the coast with shrimp being the most important catch.

Industry and manufacturing has been the most dynamic sector of the economy. Much of this began in the 1980s with the establishment of the automobile industry, specifically the Hermosillo Stamping &amp; Assembly plant owned and operated by Ford Motor Company. Electronics and IT are the largest employers by both revenue and number of employees. Today, there are twenty-six major manufacturers, which generate about 68,300 jobs, employing about thirty percent of the population.

Other than cars, products manufactured here include televisions, computers, food processing, textiles, wood products, printing, cellular phones, chemicals, petroleum products and plastics. Lanix electronics has a major research and design facility and its main manufacturing plant in Hermosillo. The city and its municipality have twelve industrial parks, which house over one hundred smaller manufacturing enterprises. There has been slowing of this sector especially the automobile industry because of the global economic downturn that began in 2008.

Commerce employs more than half of the population; besides small local businesses, chains are well represented; these are locally, regionally (Northwest Mexico), nationally, and U.S.-based. Tourism is mostly limited to the coastal communities of Bahia de Kino, Kino Nuevo and Punta Chueca, where there are cave paintings and a recreational park named La Sauceda.
In 2009, Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s rated the municipality of Hermosillo as (mxA/Estable/-) based on its administrative practices, financial flexibility and limited financial risks. Financial management of the municipality has been prudent, with adequate documentation of practices. Debt levels have also been prudent at about 33% of gross income, which might decline in 2010. However, the municipality has limited liquid capital.

==Parks and recreation==
Hermosillo is located on a plain in the Sonoran Desert, surrounded by grassy flat areas, beyond which are greener hills with serrated peaks in the distance. The city is a common stopover for North Americans traveling by car toward the coast, and is the only city in Mexico that purifies all drinking water before it goes to homes. The city is the major economic center for the state, with about thirty percent of the state&#x27;s population living in the city.

The center of the city is Plaza Zaragoza, which was built in 1865 and has a Moorish-style gazebo which was brought from Florence, Italy in the early 20th century. It also has a flower garden and statues of General Ignacio Pesqueira and General García Morales.

The plaza is framed by the State Government Palace and the cathedral. The &quot;Palacio de Gobierno&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Government Palace&quot;) was constructed in 1881 using stone from the nearby Cerro de la Campana mountain. It has a white Neoclassical facade, with the central portion extended slightly out from the rest of the building. This central part is flanked by Ionic columns and is topped by a semicircular pediment and a clock tower. To either side are windows on the first level and balconies on the second, with the corners having thick pilasters. The interior has a courtyard with a main staircase, decorated with murals depicting scenes from Sonora&#x27;s history, painted in 1982–1984 by Teresa Moran, Enrique Estrada, and Héctor Martínez Arteche. The building was officially inaugurated in 1906 and reflects elements of French style, which was popular at the time.
The cathedral, named the Catedral de la Asunción, is located next to Plaza Zaragoza. It was begun in the 18th century but was not finished until the beginning of the 20th. However, the first chapels associated with the cathedral were begun in the 18th century. Construction of the cathedral began in 1861 and is a mix of predominantly Neoclassical architecture with Neogothic decorative elements. The main entrance is flanked by paired columns on pedestals and the smaller side doors are topped with semicircular pediments. Above the main doors are two ogival or pointed windows, over which is a crest with a balustrade. The church&#x27;s towers have three levels with a dome-like top and are decorated with crosses from Caravaca de la Cruz. The interior of the church is of very austere Neoclassical design.

The Regional Museum was opened in 1960 with only one small hall, which exhibited archeological finds from the region. Today, there are two large halls, one dedicated to anthropology and the other to history. The anthropology hall displays archeological finds such as tools, utensils, textiles, stone objects and more from both the pre-Hispanic and colonial periods. The second focuses on the colonial period and contains items such as documents, maps, tools, coins and more.

The Museo de Sonora (Museum of Sonora) is housed in a building that originally functioned as a prison. It was completed in 1907 and built by the mostly indigenous prisoners themselves. The prison closed in 1979. In the 1980s, the building was reconditioned, reopening as the current museum in 1985. This museum has eighteen rooms covering various aspects of the state including its paleontology, history, archeology and ethnography. It has also conserved some of the cells of the original prison. Some of the most important items in the collection include a serpent&#x27;s head from the Teotihuacan period, a collection of coins from the 16th century and various antique weapons.

The Museo de Culturas Populares e Indígenas de Sonora (Museum of Popular and Indigenous Cultures of Sonora) was the former residence of Dr. Alberto Hoeffer. It was constructed in 1904 and restored in 1997, conserving its original French-inspired style. Today, it houses a museum mostly dedicated to the indigenous cultures of the state, including crafts, clothing, customs and ways of life.

The Plaza Hidalgo area of the city was a very fashionable area during the first half of the 20th century when a number of the wealthy and influential of the city built homes there. Today, many of these constructions now house institutions such as the Instituto Sonorense de Cultura, the Colegio de Sonora, Radio Sonora, the Colegio Library and the Colegio de Notarios. Each weekend, the plaza becomes a cultural center, hosting various activities and events such as concerts, exhibitions, theatrical works and more.

The Cerro de la Campana mountain is one of the symbols of Hermosillo. Its summit is above the valley floor and contains a lookout called El Caracol, which was inaugurated in 1909. There are two theories as to the origin of the mountain&#x27;s name. One states that it is from a peculiar metallic sound that is made when the mountain&#x27;s rocks fall against each other. The other is based on the bell-like shape of the elevation.

Just outside the city proper on the highway to Guaymas is the Centro Ecológico de Sonora (Ecological Center of Sonora). The center has more than 300 species of plants and 200 species of animals from both Sonora and other parts of the world. All of the animals live in recreated natural habitats. The Sonoran collection is part of one of CES&#x27;s main functions, which is to preserve the flora and fauna of the state. The collection contains representations of animals and plants from the four main habitats of the state: mountains, grassland, desert and sea. Some of the species are in danger of extinction such as the bighorn sheep, the white-tailed deer as well as a number of bird and reptile species.

The Dr. Alfonso Ortiz Tirado Festival has been an annual event since 1985 and is the most important cultural event in northwest Mexico. It takes place in Hermosillo and a number of other municipalities in the state. Representatives from various Mexican states and countries such as Spain, the United States, Brazil, Germany and others send artists to perform and exhibit their work. The event is organized by the Sonoran state government and the Instituto Sonorense de Cultura.

In the Coloso neighborhood of Hermosillo, and other locations in Sonora, the Yaqui people are known for their celebrations of Holy Week, which mix Catholic and indigenous religious practices. In Hermosillo, the main brotherhood that sponsors this event is called the Fariseos. Rites performed during this week are intended to combat evil and sickness, calling upon both saints and &quot;temastians&quot; or medicine men to use magic to expel evil spirits. During this time participants dress in traditional Yaqui clothing and perform native dances such as El Coyote (The Coyote), Matachines, Los Pascolas and especially the Danza del Venado (Deer Dance), animal sacred to the Yaqui as a symbol of good.

Two other major festivals there include the Fiesta de la Vendimia (Grape Harvest Festival) in July and the Feria Exposición Ganadera e Industrial (Livestock and Industry Exposition and Fair) in May.

<text>Shoah is a 1985 French documentary film about the Holocaust (known as &quot;Shoah&quot; in Hebrew since the 1940s), directed by Claude Lanzmann. Over nine hours long and eleven years in the making, the film presents Lanzmann&#x27;s interviews with survivors, witnesses and perpetrators during visits to German Holocaust sites across Poland, including extermination camps.

Released in Paris in April 1985, &quot;Shoah&quot; won critical acclaim and several prominent awards, including the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Non-Fiction Film and the BAFTA Award for Best Documentary. Simone de Beauvoir hailed it as a &quot;sheer masterpiece&quot;, while documentarian Marcel Ophüls (who would go on to win the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for &quot;Hotel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie&quot; three years later) called it &quot;the greatest documentary about contemporary history ever made&quot;. Conversely, it was not well received in Poland, wherein the government argued that it accused Poland of &quot;complicity in Nazi genocide&quot;.

&quot;Shoah&quot; premiered in New York at the Cinema Studio in October 1985 and was broadcast in the United States by PBS over four nights in 1987.

==Synopsis==
===Overview===

The film is concerned chiefly with three topics: the Chełmno extermination camp, where mobile gas vans were first used by Germans to exterminate Jews; the death camps of Treblinka and Auschwitz-Birkenau; and the Warsaw ghetto, with testimonies from survivors, witnesses and perpetrators.

The sections on Treblinka include testimony from Abraham Bomba, who survived as a barber; Richard Glazar, an inmate; and Franz Suchomel, an SS officer. Bomba breaks down while describing how he came across the wife and sister of a barber friend of his while cutting hair in the gas chamber. This section includes Henryk Gawkowski, who drove transport trains while intoxicated with vodka. Gawkowski&#x27;s photograph appears on the poster used for the film&#x27;s marketing campaign.

Testimonies on Auschwitz are provided by Rudolf Vrba, who escaped from the camp before the end of the war; and Filip Müller, who worked in an incinerator burning the bodies from the gassings. Müller recounts what prisoners said to him and describes the experience of personally going into the gas chamber: bodies were piled up by the doors &quot;like stones&quot;. He breaks down as he recalls the prisoners starting to sing while being forced into the gas chamber. Accounts include some from local villagers, who witnessed trains heading daily to the camp and returning empty; they quickly guessed the fate of those on board.
Lanzmann also interviews bystanders. He asks whether they knew what was going on in the death camps. Their answers reveal that they did, but they justified their inaction by their fear of death. Two survivors of Chełmno are interviewed: Simon Srebnik, who was forced to sing military songs to entertain the Nazis; and Mordechaï Podchlebnik. Lanzmann also has a secretly filmed interview with Franz Schalling, a German security guard, who describes the workings of Chełmno. Walter Stier, a former Nazi bureaucrat, describes the workings of the railways. Stier insists he was simply managing railroad traffic and was not aware that he was transporting Jews directly to their deaths, though he admits to being aware that the destinations were concentration camps.

The Warsaw ghetto is described by Jan Karski, a member of the Polish Underground who worked for the Polish government-in-exile, and Franz Grassler, a Nazi administrator in Warsaw who liaised with Jewish leaders. A Christian, Karski sneaked into the Warsaw ghetto and travelled using false documents to England to try to convince the Allied governments to intervene more strongly on behalf of the Jews.

Memories from Jewish survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising conclude the documentary. Lanzmann also interviews Holocaust historian Raul Hilberg, who discusses the significance of Nazi propaganda against the European Jews and the Nazi development of the Final Solution and a detailed analysis of railroad documents showing the transport routes to the death camps. The complete text of the film was published in 1985.

===Franz Suchomel===
Corporal Franz Suchomel, interviewed by Lanzmann in Germany on 27 April 1976, was an SS officer who had worked at Treblinka. Suchomel agreed to be interviewed for 500 Deutschmarks, but refused to be filmed, so Lanzmann used hidden recording equipment while assuring Suchomel that he would not use his name.

Suchomel talks in detail about the camp&#x27;s gas chambers and the disposal of bodies. He states that he did not know about the extermination at Treblinka until he arrived there. On his first day, he says he vomited and cried after encountering trenches full of corpses, 6–7 m deep, with the earth around them moving in waves because of the gases seeping from the decomposing bodies. The smell of the bodies carried for kilometres depending on the wind, he said, but local people were scared to act in case they were sent to the work camp, Treblinka I.

He explained that from arrival at Treblinka to death in the gas chambers took 2–3 hours for a trainload of people. They would undress, the women would have their hair cut, then they would wait naked outside, including during the winter in minus 10–20 °C, until there was room in the gas chamber. Suchomel told Lanzmann that he would ask the hairdressers to slow down so that the women would not have to wait so long outside.

Compared to the size and complexity of Auschwitz, Suchomel calls Treblinka &quot;primitive. But a well-functioning assembly line of death.&quot;

===Man in the poster===

The publicity poster for the film features Henryk Gawkowski, a Polish railway worker from Malkinia, who, in 1942–1943 when he was 20–21 years old, worked on the trains to Treblinka as an &quot;assistant machinist with the right to drive the locomotive&quot;. Conducted in Poland in July 1978, the interview with Gawkowski is shown 48 minutes into the film, and is the first to present events from the victims&#x27; perspective. Lanzmann hired a steam locomotive similar to the one Gawkowski worked on and shows the tracks and a sign for Treblinka.

Gawkowski told Lanzmann that every train had a Polish driver and assistant, accompanied by German officers. What happened was not his fault, he said; had he refused to do the job, he would have been sent to a work camp. He would have killed Hitler himself had he been able to, he told Lanzmann. Lanzmann estimated that 18,000 Jews were taken to Treblinka by the trains Gawkowski worked on. Gawkowski said he had driven Polish Jews there in cargo trains in 1942, and Jews from France, Greece, Holland and Yugoslavia in passenger trains in 1943. A train carrying Jews was called a &quot;Sonderzug&quot; (special train); the &quot;cargo&quot; was given false papers to disguise that humans were being hauled. The Germans gave the train workers vodka as a bonus when they drove a &quot;Sonderzug&quot;; Gawkowski drank liberally to make the job bearable.

Gawkowski drove trains to the Treblinka train station and from the station into the camp itself. He said the smell of burning was unbearable as the train approached the camp. The railcars would be driven into the camp by the locomotive in three stages; as he drove one convoy into Treblinka, he would signal to the ones that were waiting by making a slashing movement across his throat. The gesture would cause chaos in those convoys, he said; passengers would try to jump out or throw their children out. Dominick LaCapra wrote that the expression on Gawkowski&#x27;s face when he demonstrated the gesture for Lanzmann seemed &quot;somewhat diabolical&quot;. Lanzmann grew to like Gawkowski over the course of the interviews, writing in 1990: &quot;He was different from the others. I have sympathy for him because he carries a truly open wound that does not heal.&quot;

==Production==

Lanzmann was commissioned by Israeli officials to make what they thought would be a two-hour film, delivered in 18 months, about the Holocaust from &quot;the viewpoint of the Jews&quot;. As time went on, Israeli officials withdrew as his original backers. Over 350 hours of raw footage were recorded, including the verbatim questions, answers, and interpreters&#x27; translations. Most of this footage has been digitized by the United States Holocaust Museum, and is available online. &quot;Shoah&quot; took eleven years to make. It was plagued by financial problems, difficulties tracking down interviewees, and threats to Lanzmann&#x27;s life. The film was unusual in that it did not include any historical footage, relying instead on interviewing witnesses and visiting the crime scenes. Five feature-length films have since been released from the outtakes.

Some German interviewees were reluctant to talk and refused to be filmed, so Lanzmann used a hidden camera, producing a grainy, black-and-white appearance. The interviewees in these scenes are sometimes obscured or distinguished by technicians watching the recording. During one interview, with Heinz Schubert, the covert recording was discovered by Schubert&#x27;s family, and Lanzmann was physically attacked. He was hospitalized for a month and charged by the authorities with &quot;unauthorized use of the German airwaves&quot;.

Lanzmann arranged many of the scenes, but not the testimony, before filming witnesses. For example, Bomba was interviewed while cutting his friend&#x27;s hair in a working barbershop; a steam locomotive was hired to recreate the journey the death train conductor had taken while transporting Jews; and the opening scene shows Srebnik singing in a rowboat, similarly to how he had &quot;serenaded his captors&quot;.

The first six years of production were devoted to the recording of interviews in 14 countries. Lanzmann worked on the interviews for four years before first visiting Poland. After the shooting, editing of the 350 hours of raw footage continued for five years. Lanzmann frequently replaced the camera shot of the interviewee with modern footage from the site of the relevant death camp. The matching of testimony to places became a &quot;crucial trope of the film&quot;.

&quot;Shoah&quot; was made without voice-over translations. The questions and answers were kept on the soundtrack, along with the voices of the interpreters, with subtitles where necessary. Transcripts of the interviews, in original languages and English translations, are held by the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. Videos of excerpts from the interviews are available for viewing online, and linked transcripts can be downloaded from the museum&#x27;s website.

==Reception==
===Awards===
The film received numerous nominations and awards at film festivals around the world. Prominent awards included the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Non-Fiction Film in 1985, a special citation at the 1985 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards, and the BAFTA Award for Best Documentary in 1986. That year it also won the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Non-Fiction Film and Best Documentary at the International Documentary Association.

===Critical response===
Hailed as a masterpiece by many critics, &quot;Shoah&quot; was described in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;an epic film about the greatest evil of modern times&quot;. According to Richard Brody, François Mitterrand attended the first screening in Paris in April 1985 when he was president of France, Václav Havel watched it in prison, and Mikhail Gorbachev arranged public screenings in the Soviet Union in 1989.

In 1985, critic Roger Ebert described it as &quot;an extraordinary film&quot; and &quot;one of the noblest films ever made&quot;. He wrote: &quot;It is not a documentary, not journalism, not propaganda, not political. It is an act of witness.&quot; Rotten Tomatoes shows a 100% score, based on 37 reviews, with an average rating of 9.2/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;Expansive in its beauty as well as its mind-numbing horror, &quot;Shoah&quot; is a towering – and utterly singular – achievement in cinema.&quot; Metacritic reports a 99 out of 100 rating, based on four critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. As of July 2019, it is the site&#x27;s 20th highest-rated film, including re-releases.

&quot;Time Out&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; listed &quot;Shoah&quot; as the best documentary of all time in 2016 and 2013 respectively. In a 2014 British Film Institute (BFI) &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; poll, film critics voted it second of the best documentary films of all time. In 2012 it ranked 29th and 48th respectively in the BFI&#x27;s critics&#x27; and directors&#x27; polls of the greatest films of all time. The same polls in 2022 placed it 27th among critics and 72nd among directors.

The film had detractors, however, and it was criticized in Poland. Mieczyslaw Biskupski wrote that Lanzmann&#x27;s &quot;purpose in making the film was revealed by his comments that he &#x27;fears&#x27; Poland and that the death camps could not have been constructed in France because the &#x27;French peasantry would not have tolerated them. Government-run newspapers and state television criticized the film, as did numerous commentators; Jerzy Turowicz, editor of the Catholic weekly &quot;Tygodnik Powszechny&quot;, called it partial and tendentious. The Socio-Cultural Association of Jews in Poland (&quot;Towarzystwo Społeczno-Kulturalne Żydów w Polsce&quot;) called it a provocation and delivered a protest letter to the French embassy in Warsaw. Foreign Minister Władysław Bartoszewski, an Auschwitz survivor and an honorary citizen of Israel, criticized Lanzmann for ignoring the thousands of Polish rescuers of Jews, focusing instead on impoverished rural Poles, allegedly selected to conform with his preconceived notions.

Gustaw Herling-Grudziński, a Jewish-Polish writer and dissident, was puzzled by Lanzmann&#x27;s omission of anybody in Poland with advanced knowledge of the Holocaust. In his book &quot;Dziennik pisany nocą&quot;, Herling-Grudziński wrote that the thematic construction of &quot;Shoah&quot; allowed Lanzmann to exercise a reduction method so extreme that the plight of the non-Jewish Poles must remain a mystery to the viewer. Grudziński asked a rhetorical question in his book: &quot;Did the Poles live in peace, quietly plowing farmers&#x27; fields with their backs turned on the long fuming chimneys of death-camp crematoria? Or, were they exterminated along with the Jews as subhuman?&quot; According to Grudziński, Lanzmann leaves this question unanswered, but the historical evidence shows that Poles also suffered widespread massacres at the hands of the Nazis.

The American film critic Pauline Kael, whose parents were Jewish immigrants to the U.S. from Poland, called the film &quot;a form of self-punishment&quot;, describing it in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1985 as &quot;logy and exhausting right from the start ...&quot; &quot;Lanzmann did all the questioning himself,&quot; she wrote, &quot;while putting pressure on people in a discursive manner, which gave the film a deadening weight.&quot; Writing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2010, Richard Brody suggested that Kael&#x27;s &quot;misunderstandings of &quot;Shoah&quot; are so grotesque as to seem willful.&quot;

==Home media==
In 2000, the film was released on VHS, and in 2010 on DVD. Lanzmann&#x27;s 350 hours of raw footage, along with the transcripts, are available on the website of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. The entire 566-minute film was digitally restored and remastered by The Criterion Collection over 2012–13 in 2K resolution, from the original 16 mm negatives. The monaural audio track was remastered without compression. A Blu-ray edition in three disks was then produced from these new masters, including three additional films by Lanzmann.

==Legacy==
Lanzmann released four feature-length films based on unused material shot for &quot;Shoah&quot;. The first three are included as bonus features in the Criterion Collection DVD and Blu-ray release of the film. All four are included in the Masters of Cinema Blu-ray release of the film.
* &quot;&quot; (1997), about a Red Cross representative, Maurice Rossel, who in 1944 wrote a favorable report about the Theresienstadt concentration camp.
* &quot;Sobibor, October 14, 1943, 4 p.m.&quot; (2001), about Yehuda Lerner, who participated in an uprising against the camp guards and managed to escape.
* &quot;The Karski Report&quot; (2010), about Polish resistance fighter Jan Karski&#x27;s visit to Franklin Roosevelt in 1943.
* &quot;The Last of the Unjust&quot; (2013), about Benjamin Murmelstein, a controversial Jewish rabbi in the Theresienstadt ghetto during World War II.
* &quot;&quot; (2018), a French documentary film that aired as a four-part series on French TV on 23 January 2018. It is both Lanzmann&#x27;s final film and a continuation of &quot;Shoah&quot; and chronicles the lives of four women who escaped the concentration camps and tried to find a life after the Holocaust. The four-and-a-half hour cut of the film (nearly half of Shoah&#x27;s length) debuted in American theaters on 14 November 2018. It was on France&#x27;s shortlist to compete in the Best Documentary category.

Previously unseen &quot;Shoah&quot; outtakes have been featured in Adam Benzine&#x27;s Oscar-nominated HBO documentary &quot;Claude Lanzmann: Spectres of the Shoah&quot; (2015), which examines Lanzmann&#x27;s life from 1973 to 1985, the years he spent making &quot;Shoah&quot;.

Ziva Postec&#x27;s work as the film&#x27;s editor was profiled in the 2018 documentary film &quot;Ziva Postec: The Editor Behind the Film Shoah (Ziva Postec : La monteuse derrière le film Shoah)&quot;, by Canadian documentarian Catherine Hébert.

<doc id="147219" wikidata="Q43675" url="?curid=147219" title="Philip the Apostle">
<text>Philip the Apostle (; Aramaic: ܦܝܠܝܦܘܣ; , &quot;Philippos&quot;) was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament. Later Christian traditions describe Philip as the apostle who preached in Greece, Syria, and Asia-Minor.

In the Roman Rite, the feast day of Philip, along with that of James the Less, is traditionally observed on 1 May, the anniversary of the dedication of the church dedicated to them in Rome (now called the Church of the Twelve Apostles). In the short-lived calendar reform of 1960, it was transferred to 11 May, but since 1969 it has been assigned to 3 May. The Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates Philip&#x27;s feast day on 14 November. 
==New Testament==
All three Synoptic Gospels and the Book of Acts list Philip as one of the apostles; he is always listed on the fifth place. The Gospel of John recounts Philip&#x27;s calling as a disciple of Jesus. Philip is described as a disciple from the city of Bethsaida, and the evangelist connects him with Andrew and Peter, who were from the same town. He also was among those surrounding John the Baptist when the latter first pointed out Jesus as the Lamb of God. It was Philip who first introduced Nathanael (sometimes identified with Bartholomew) to Jesus. According to Butler, Philip was among those attending the wedding at Cana.

Of the four Gospels, Philip figures most prominently in the Gospel of John. Jesus tests Philip (John 6:6) when he asks him how to feed the 5,000 people. Later he appears as a link to the Greek community. Philip bore a Greek name, could likely speak Greek, and may have been known to the Greek pilgrims in Jerusalem. He advises Andrew that certain Greeks wish to meet Jesus, and together they inform Jesus of this (John 12:21). During the Last Supper, when Philip asked Jesus to show them the Father, he provides Jesus the opportunity to teach his disciples about the unity of the Father and the Son.

===Distinct from Philip the Evangelist===
Philip the Apostle should not be confused with Philip the Evangelist, who was appointed with Stephen and five others to oversee charitable distributions (Acts 6:5).

==Apocryphal accounts==
===Nag Hammadi texts===
One of the Gnostic codices discovered in the Nag Hammadi library in 1945 bears Philip&#x27;s name in its title, on the bottom line.
An early extra-biblical story about St. Philip is preserved in the apocryphal &quot;Letter from Peter to Philip&quot;, also one of the texts in the Nag Hammadi Library, and dated to the end of the 2nd century or early 3rd. This text begins with a letter from St. Peter to St. Philip, asking him to rejoin the other apostles who had gathered at the Mount of Olives. Fred Lapham believes that this letter indicates an early tradition that &quot;at some point between the Resurrection of Jesus and the final parting of his risen presence from the disciples, Philip had undertaken a sole missionary enterprise, and was, for some reason, reluctant to return to the rest of the Apostles.&quot;

===&quot;Acts&quot;: miracles and martyrdom===
Later stories about Philip&#x27;s life can be found in the anonymous &quot;Acts of Philip&quot;, probably written by a contemporary of Eusebius. This non-canonical book recounts the preaching and miracles of Philip. According to these accounts, following the resurrection of Jesus, Philip was sent with his sister Mariamne and Bartholomew to preach in Greece, Phrygia, and Syria. Included in the &quot;Acts of Philip&quot; is an appendix, entitled &quot;Of the Journey of Philip the Apostle: From the Fifteenth Act Until the End, and Among Them the Martyrdom.&quot; This appendix gives an embellished account of Philip&#x27;s martyrdom in the city of Hierapolis. According to this account, through a miraculous healing and his preaching Philip converted the wife of the proconsul of the city. This enraged the proconsul, and he had Philip, Bartholomew, and Mariamne all tortured. Philip and Bartholomew were then crucified upside-down, and Philip preached from his cross. As a result of Philip&#x27;s preaching the crowd released Bartholomew from his cross, but Philip insisted that they not release him, and Philip died on the cross. Philip is also said to have been martyred by beheading, rather than crucifixion, in the city of Hierapolis.
==Relics==
The relics of Philip the Apostle are currently found in the crypt of Basilica Santi Apostoli, Rome, as well as the Church of St. Philip the Apostle in Cheektowaga, New York.

==Possible tomb location==
In 2011, Italian archaeologist Francesco D&#x27;Andria claimed to have discovered the original tomb of Philip during excavations in ancient Hierapolis, close to the modern Turkish city of Denizli. The 1st-century tomb, found to be empty of relics, stood at the centre of the 4th- or 5th-century three-naved basilica, the Church of the Sepulchre, which was one of the focal points of an entire ancient pilgrimage hill complex dedicated to Philip. Ancient Greek prayers are carved into the walls of the tomb and church venerating Philip the Apostle, and a 6th-century bread stamp (&quot;&quot;) shows Philip holding bread (John 6) with this specific three-naved church on his left side, and the previously identified nearby martyrion church to his right, removing all doubts about the basilica being the one to contain the original tomb of the apostle. The church built on his tomb and the martyrion church some 40 yards away were places of intense veneration for centuries: In Philip&#x27;s Church of the Sepulchre the marble floors were worn down by thousands of people.

In 2012, Bartholomew, the patriarch of Constantinople and primate of the Orthodox church, celebrated the liturgy of St. Philip in the Church of the Sepulchre and in the martyrion church of the apostle.

==Iconography==

Philip is commonly associated with the symbol of the Latin cross. Other symbols assigned to Philip include: the cross with the two loaves (because of his answer to the Lord in John 6:7), a basket filled with bread, a spear with the patriarchal cross, and a cross with a carpenter&#x27;s square.

== Veneration ==
Philip is remembered (with James) in the Church of England with a Festival on 1 May.

=== Eastern Orthodoxy ===
The Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates Philip on several days of the year.

* November 14: Primary Feast Day.
* June 30: Synaxis of the Twelve Apostles.
* July 31: Translation of Philip&#x27;s Relics to Cyprus.

His feast day begins the Nativity Fast in the Eastern Orthodox Church, that is called Philip&#x27;s Fast (or the Philippian Fast), the Fast is Eastern equivalent of Western Advent.

==Patronage==
Saint Philip is the patron saint of hatters.

<text>The Shatt al-Arab (; ) is a river about in length that is formed at the confluence of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers in the town of al-Qurnah in the Basra Governorate of southern Iraq. The southern end of the river constitutes the Iran–Iraq border down to its mouth, where it discharges into the Persian Gulf. The Shatt al-Arab varies in width from about at Basra to at its mouth. It is thought that the waterway formed relatively recently in geological time, with the Tigris and Euphrates originally emptying into the Persian Gulf via a channel further to the west. Kuwait&#x27;s Bubiyan Island is part of the Shatt al-Arab delta.

The Karun, a tributary which joins the waterway from the Iranian side, deposits large amounts of silt into the river; this necessitates continuous dredging to keep it navigable.

The area used to hold the largest date palm forest in the world. In the mid-1970s, the region included 17–18 million date palms: an estimated one-fifth of the world&#x27;s 90 million palm trees. However, by 2002, more than 14 million of the palms had been wiped out by the combined factors of war, salt and pests; this count includes around 9 million palms in Iraq and 5 million in Iran. Many of the remaining 3–4 million trees are in poor health.

==Geography==

The Shatt al-Arab is formed by the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers at Al-Qurnah, and flows into the Persian Gulf south of the city of Al-Faw. It receives the Karun at Khorramshahr.

==History==
3,000 years ago, the Persian Gulf was larger and the Shatt al-Arab had not then formed.

Dispute over the river occurred during the Ottoman-Safavid era, prior to the establishment of an independent Iraq in the 20th century. In the early 16th century, the Iranian Safavids gained most of what is present-day Iraq, including Shatt al-Arab. They later lost these territories to the expanding Ottomans following the Peace of Amasya (1555). 

In the early 17th century, the Safavids under king (&quot;shah&quot;) Abbas I (r. 1588–1629) once again regained Shatt al-Arab. Control of the river was at last permanently ceded to the Ottomans with the Treaty of Zuhab in 1639. Control of the waterway was also temporarily lost by the Safavids to the Ottomans in this treaty. In general, the Treaty of Zuhab roughly re-established the common borders of the Ottomans and Safavid Empires the way they had been in 1555. However, the treaty never demarcated a precise and fixed boundary regarding the frontier in the south. 

Later, Nader Shah (r. 1736–1747) succeeded in restoring Iranian control over Shatt al-Arab for a time. With the Treaty of Kerden (1746), however, the Zuhab boundaries were restored, ceding the river to the Turks once again. The First Treaty of Erzurum (1823) concluded between Ottoman Turkey and Qajar Iran, resulted in the same.

The Second Treaty of Erzurum was signed by Ottoman Turkey and Qajar Iran in 1847 after protracted negotiations, which included British and Russian delegates. Even afterwards, backtracking and disagreements continued, until British Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston, was moved to comment in 1851 that &quot;the boundary line between Turkey and Persia can never be finally settled except by an arbitrary decision on the part of Great Britain and Russia&quot;. A protocol between the Ottomans and the Persians was signed in Istanbul in 1913, which declared that the Ottoman-Persian frontier run along the &quot;thalweg&quot;, but World War I canceled all plans.
During the Mandate of Iraq (1920–1932), the British advisors in Iraq were able to keep the waterway binational under the thalweg principle that worked in Europe: the dividing line was a line drawn between the deepest points along the stream bed. In 1937, Iran and Iraq signed a treaty that settled the dispute over control of the Shatt al-Arab. The 1937 treaty recognized the Iranian-Iraqi border as along the low-water mark on the eastern side of the Shatt al-Arab except at Abadan and Khorramshahr where the frontier ran along the &quot;thalweg&quot; (the deep water line) which gave Iraq control of almost the entire waterway; provided that all ships using the Shatt al-Arab fly the Iraqi flag and have an Iraqi pilot, and required Iran to pay tolls to Iraq whenever its ships used the Shatt al-Arab. Shah Reza Shah of Iran together with his close friend President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk of Turkey had been promoting the Saadabad pact intended to protect the neutrality of Muslim nations if the world should be plunged into war again. In return for the Shatt al-Arab treaty, Iraq joined the Saadabad pact and Iranian-Iraqi relations were friendly for decades afterward. The Saadabad pact ultimately brought together Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan in an alliance intended to protect their neutrality. In 1955, both Iran and Iraq were founding members of the Baghdad Pact alliance.

The Shatt al-Arab and the forest were depicted in the middle of the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Iraq, from 1932 to 1959. 


Under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in the late 1960s, Iran developed a strong military and took a more assertive stance in the Near East. In April 1969, Iran abrogated the 1937 treaty over the Shatt al-Arab and Iranian ships stopped paying tolls to Iraq when they used the Shatt al-Arab. The Shah argued that the 1937 treaty was unfair to Iran because almost all river borders around the world ran along the &quot;thalweg&quot;, and because most of the ships that used the Shatt al-Arab were Iranian. Iraq threatened war over the Iranian move, but on 24 April 1969, an Iranian tanker escorted by Iranian warships (Joint Operation Arvand) sailed down the Shatt al-Arab, and Iraq—being the militarily weaker state—did nothing. The Iranian abrogation of the 1937 treaty marked the beginning of a period of acute Iraqi-Iranian tension that was to last until the Algiers Accords of 1975.

All United Nations attempts to intervene and mediate the dispute were rebuffed. Baathist Iraq claimed the frontier agreed to in 1937 was still the legitimate frontier. In response, Iran in the early 1970s became the main patron of Iraqi Kurdish groups fighting for independence from Iraq. In 1974 with the open encouragement and support of Iran, the Iraqi Kurdish &quot;peshmerga&quot; rebelled against Iraq, and instead of waging a guerrilla war, the &quot;peshmerga&quot; fought a conventional war against Iraq, leading to very intense fighting. In the winter of 1974–75, Iran and Iraq almost went to war over Iran&#x27;s support of the Kurds in Iraq (see 1974–75 Shatt al-Arab conflict). However, given Iran&#x27;s greater military strength and population, the Iraqis decided against war, and chose to make concessions to Tehran to end the Kurdish rebellion. In March 1975, Vice President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and the Shah signed the Algiers Accord in which Iraq recognized a series of straight lines closely approximating the &quot;thalweg&quot; (deepest channel) of the waterway, as the official border, in exchange for which Iran ended its support of the Iraqi Kurds. The Algiers Accord was seen as a national humiliation in Iraq, causing much bitterness over what was seen as Iranian bullying. However, the Algiers Accord saw Iran cease supporting the &quot;peshmerga&quot; as the Iranians closed the frontier, causing the Kurdish rebellion to promptly collapse. The British journalist Patrick Brogan wrote that &quot;the Iraqis celebrated their victory in the usual manner, by executing as many of the rebels as they could lay their hands on&quot;.

In 1980, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq abrogated the 1975 treaty and Iraq invaded Iran. The main thrust of the military movement on the ground was across the waterway which was the stage for most of the military battles between the two armies. The waterway was Iraq&#x27;s only outlet to the Persian Gulf, and thus, its shipping lanes were greatly affected by continuous Iranian attacks.

When Al-Faw peninsula was captured by the Iranians in 1986, Iraq&#x27;s shipping activities virtually came to a halt and had to be diverted to other Arab ports such as Kuwait and even Aqaba, Jordan. On 17 April 1988, Operation Ramadan Mubarak Materialized which saw Al-Faw peninsula recaptured after three days of fighting. After retaking Al-Faw, the Iraqis began a sustained drive to clear the Iranians out of all of southern Iraq. In May 1988, the Iraqis expelled the Iranians from Salamchech and took Majnun Island. During the fighting in the spring of 1988, the Iranians showed all the signs of collapsing morale. Brogan reported: 

During the 1988 battles, the Iranians seemed tired and worn out by the nearly eight years of the war, and &quot;put up very little resistance&quot; to the Iraqi offensives. After the Iran–Iraq War, both sides agreed to once again treat the Algiers Accord as binding.

===Conflicts===
====Iranian–Iraqi dispute====
Conflicting territorial claims and disputes over navigation rights between Iran and Iraq were among the main factors for the beginning of the Iran–Iraq War that lasted from 1980 to 1988, when the pre-1980 &quot;status quo&quot; was restored. The Iranian cities and major ports of Abadan and Khorramshahr and the Iraqi cities and major ports of Basra and Al-Faw are situated along this river.

====Gulf War and Iraq War====

During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the waterway was a key military target for the coalition forces. Since it is the only outlet to the Persian Gulf, its capture was important in delivering humanitarian aid to the rest of the country, and stopping the flow of operations trying to break the naval blockade against Iraq. The British Royal Marines staged an amphibious assault to capture the key oil installations and shipping docks located at Umm Qasr on the al-Faw peninsula at the onset of the conflict.

Following the end of the war, the UK was given responsibility, subsequently mandated by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1723, to patrol the waterway and the area of the Persian Gulf surrounding the river mouth. They were tasked until 2007 to make sure that ships in the area were not being used to transport munitions into Iraq. British forces also trained Iraqi naval units to take over the responsibility of guarding their waterways after the Coalition Forces left Iraq in December 2011.

On two separate occasions, Iranian forces operating on the Shatt al-Arab captured British Royal Navy sailors who they claim trespassed into their territory:
* In 2004, several British servicemen were held for two days after purportedly straying into the Iranian side of the waterway. After being initially threatened with prosecution, they were released after high-level conversations between British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi. The initial hardline approach came down to power struggles within the Iranian government. The British marines&#x27; weapons and boats were confiscated.
* In 2007, a seizure of fifteen more British personnel became a major diplomatic crisis between the two nations. It was resolved after thirteen days when the Iranians unexpectedly released the captives under an &quot;amnesty&quot;.

==Naming==
The river is also known in Iraq as the Dijla al-Awara (دجلة العوراء) and in Iran as the Arvand Rud (Persian: اروندرود, lit. &#x27;Swift River&#x27;). 

The Persian epic poem &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (written between ) and many other works of Middle Persian literature use the name &quot;Arvand&quot; () for the Tigris, the confluent of the Shatt al-Arab. Iranians also used this name specifically to designate the Shatt al-Arab during the later Pahlavi period, and continue to do so since the 1979 Iranian Revolution.

<doc id="147230" wikidata="Q2638" url="?curid=147230" title="Golomb coding">
<text>Golomb coding is a lossless data compression method using a family of data compression codes invented by Solomon W. Golomb in the 1960s. Alphabets following a geometric distribution will have a Golomb code as an optimal prefix code, making Golomb coding highly suitable for situations in which the occurrence of small values in the input stream is significantly more likely than large values.

== Rice coding ==

Rice coding (invented by Robert F. Rice) denotes using a subset of the family of Golomb codes to produce a simpler (but possibly suboptimal) prefix code. Rice used this set of codes in an adaptive coding scheme; &quot;Rice coding&quot; can refer either to that adaptive scheme or to using that subset of Golomb codes. Whereas a Golomb code has a tunable parameter that can be any positive integer value, Rice codes are those in which the tunable parameter is a power of two. This makes Rice codes convenient for use on a computer, since multiplication and division by 2 can be implemented more efficiently in binary arithmetic.

Rice was motivated to propose this simpler subset due to the fact that geometric distributions are often varying with time, not precisely known, or both, so selecting the seemingly optimal code might not be very advantageous.

Rice coding is used as the entropy encoding stage in a number of lossless image compression and audio data compression methods.

== Overview ==
===Construction of codes===

Golomb coding uses a tunable parameter to divide an input value into two parts: , the result of a division by , and , the remainder. The quotient is sent in unary coding, followed by the remainder in truncated binary encoding. When formula_1, Golomb coding is equivalent to unary coding.

Golomb–Rice codes can be thought of as codes that indicate a number by the position of the &quot;bin&quot; (), and the &quot;offset&quot; within the &quot;bin&quot; (). The example figure shows the position and offset for the encoding of integer using Golomb–Rice parameter , with source probabilities following a geometric distribution with .

Formally, the two parts are given by the following expression, where is the nonnegative integer being encoded:

:formula_2

and

:formula_3.

Both and will be encoded using variable numbers of bits: by a unary code, and by bits for Rice code, or a choice between and bits for Golomb code (i.e. is not a power of 2), with formula_4. If formula_5, then use bits to encode ; otherwise, use +1 bits to encode . Clearly, formula_6 if is a power of 2 and we can encode all values of with bits.

The integer treated by Golomb was the run length of a Bernoulli process, which has a geometric distribution starting at 0. The best choice of parameter is a function of the corresponding Bernoulli process, which is parameterized by formula_7 the probability of success in a given Bernoulli trial. is either the median of the distribution or the median ±1. It can be determined by these inequalities:
: formula_8
which are solved by 
: formula_9.

For the example with :
: formula_10.

The Golomb code for this distribution is equivalent to the Huffman code for the same probabilities, if it were possible to compute the Huffman code for the infinite set of source values.

===Use with signed integers===

Golomb&#x27;s scheme was designed to encode sequences of non-negative numbers. However, it is easily extended to accept sequences containing negative numbers using an &quot;overlap and interleave&quot; scheme, in which all values are reassigned to some positive number in a unique and reversible way. The sequence begins: 0, −1, 1, −2, 2, −3, 3, −4, 4, ... The &quot;n&quot;-th negative value (i.e., ) is mapped to the &quot;n&quot;th odd number (), and the &quot;m&quot;th positive value is mapped to the &quot;m&quot;-th even number (). This may be expressed mathematically as follows: a positive value is mapped to (formula_11), and a negative value is mapped to (formula_12). Such a code may be used for simplicity, even if suboptimal. Truly optimal codes for two-sided geometric distributions include multiple variants of the Golomb code, depending on the distribution parameters, including this one.

== Simple algorithm ==

Below is the Rice–Golomb encoding, where the remainder code uses simple truncated binary encoding, also named &quot;Rice coding&quot; (other varying-length binary encodings, like arithmetic or Huffman encodings, are possible for the remainder codes, if the statistic distribution of remainder codes is not flat, and notably when not all possible remainders after the division are used). In this algorithm, if the &quot;M&quot; parameter is a power of 2, it becomes equivalent to the simpler Rice encoding:

# Fix the parameter &quot;M&quot; to an integer value.
# For &quot;N&quot;, the number to be encoded, find
## quotient = &quot;q&quot; = floor(&quot;N&quot;/&quot;M&quot;)
## remainder = &quot;r&quot; = &quot;N&quot; modulo &quot;M&quot;
# Generate codeword
## The code format : &lt;Quotient code&gt;&lt;Remainder code&gt;, where
## Quotient code (in unary coding)
### Write a &quot;q&quot;-length string of 1 bits (alternatively, of 0 bits)
### Write a 0 bit (respectively, a 1 bit)
## Remainder code (in truncated binary encoding)
### Let formula_4
#### If formula_14 code &quot;r&quot; in binary representation using &quot;b&quot; bits.
#### If formula_15 code the number formula_16 in binary representation using &quot;b&quot; + 1 bits.

Decoding:
# Decode the unary representation of &quot;q&quot; (count the number of 1 in the beginning of the code)
# Skip the 0 delimiter
# Let formula_4
## Interpret next &quot;b&quot; bits as a binary number &quot;r&quot;&#x27;. If formula_18 holds, then the reminder formula_19
## Otherwise interpret &quot;b + 1&quot; bits as a binary number &quot;r&quot;&#x27;, the reminder is given by formula_20
# Compute formula_21

== Example ==

Set . Thus formula_22. The cutoff is formula_23.

For example, with a Rice–Golomb encoding using parameter , the decimal number 42 would first be split into = 4 and = 2, and would be encoded as qcode(),rcode() = qcode(4),rcode(2) = 11110,010 (you don&#x27;t need to encode the separating comma in the output stream, because the 0 at the end of the code is enough to say when ends and begins; both the qcode and rcode are self-delimited).

== Use for run-length encoding ==

:&quot;Note that and are reversed in this section compared to the use in earlier sections.&quot;

Given an alphabet of two symbols, or a set of two events, &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;, with probabilities &quot;p&quot; and () respectively, where , Golomb coding can be used to encode runs of zero or more &quot;P&quot;′s separated by single &quot;Q&quot;′s. In this application, the best setting of the parameter &quot;M&quot; is the nearest integer to formula_24. When &quot;p&quot; = 1/2, &quot;M&quot; = 1, and the Golomb code corresponds to unary ( &quot;P&quot;′s followed by a &quot;Q&quot; is encoded as &quot;n&quot; ones followed by a zero). If a simpler code is desired, one can assign Golomb–Rice parameter (i.e., Golomb parameter formula_25) to the integer nearest to formula_26; although not always the best parameter, it is usually the best Rice parameter and its compression performance is quite close to the optimal Golomb code. (Rice himself proposed using various codes for the same data to figure out which was best. A later JPL researcher proposed various methods of optimizing or estimating the code parameter.)

Consider using a Rice code with a binary portion having bits to run-length encode sequences where &quot;P&quot; has a probability . If formula_27 is the probability that a bit will be part of an -bit run (formula_28 &quot;P&quot;s and one &quot;Q&quot;) and formula_29 is the compression ratio of that run, then the expected compression ratio is

:formula_30

Compression is often expressed in terms of formula_31, the proportion compressed. For formula_32, the run-length coding approach results in compression ratios close to entropy. For example, using Rice code formula_33 for formula_34 yields compression, while the entropy limit is .

== Adaptive run-length Golomb–Rice encoding ==

When a probability distribution for integers is not known, the optimal parameter for a Golomb–Rice encoder cannot be determined. Thus, in many applications, a two-pass approach is used: first, the block of data is scanned to estimate a probability density function (PDF) for the data. The Golomb–Rice parameter is then determined from that estimated PDF. A simpler variation of that approach is to assume that the PDF belongs to a parametrized family, estimate the PDF parameters from the data, and then compute the optimal Golomb–Rice parameter. That is the approach used in most of the applications discussed below.

An alternative approach to efficiently encode integer data whose PDF is not known, or is varying, is to use a backwards-adaptive encoder. The RLGR encoder achieves that using a very simple algorithm that adjusts the Golomb–Rice parameter up or down, depending on the last encoded symbol. A decoder can follow the same rule to track the variation of the encoding parameters, so no side information needs to be transmitted, just the encoded data. Assuming a generalized Gaussian PDF, which covers a wide range of statistics seen in data such as prediction errors or transform coefficients in multimedia codecs, the RLGR encoding algorithm can perform very well in such applications.

== Applications ==
Numerous signal codecs use a Rice code for prediction residues.
In predictive algorithms, such residues tend to fall into a two-sided geometric distribution, with small residues being more frequent than large residues, and the Rice code closely approximates the Huffman code for such a distribution without the overhead of having to transmit the Huffman table.
One signal that does not match a geometric distribution is a sine wave, because the differential residues create a sinusoidal signal whose values are not creating a geometric distribution (the highest and lowest residue values have similar high frequency of occurrences, only the median positive and negative residues occur less often).

Several lossless audio codecs, such as Shorten, FLAC, Apple Lossless, and MPEG-4 ALS, use a Rice code after the linear prediction step (called &quot;adaptive FIR filter&quot; in Apple Lossless).
Rice coding is also used in the FELICS lossless image codec.

The Golomb–Rice coder is used in the entropy coding stage of Rice algorithm based &quot;lossless image codecs&quot;. One such experiment yields the compression ratio graph shown.

The JPEG-LS scheme uses Rice–Golomb to encode the prediction residuals.

The adaptive version of Golomb–Rice coding mentioned above, the RLGR encoder ,is used for encoding screen content in virtual machines in the RemoteFX component of the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol.

<text>The Comics Code Authority (CCA) was formed in 1954 by the Comics Magazine Association of America as an alternative to government regulation. The CCA enabled comic publishers to self-regulate the content of comic books in the United States. The code was voluntary, as there was no law requiring its use, although some advertisers and retailers looked to it for reassurance. Some publishers including Dell, Western, and Classics Illustrated, never used it. Its code, commonly called &quot;the Comics Code&quot;, lasted until the early 21st century. The CC formation followed a moral panic centered around a series of Senate hearings and the publication of psychiatrist Fredric Wertham&#x27;s book &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot;.

Members submitted comics to the CCA, which screened them for adherence to its code, then authorized the use of their seal on the cover if the book was found to be in compliance. At the height of its influence, it was a &quot;de facto&quot; censor for the entire U.S. comic book industry, with most comics requiring a seal to be published.

By the early 2000s, publishers bypassed the CCA and Marvel Comics abandoned it in 2001. By 2010, only three major publishers still adhered to it: DC Comics, Archie Comics, and Bongo Comics. Bongo broke with the CCA in 2010. DC and Archie followed in January 2011, rendering the code .

==Beginning==

The Comics Magazine Association of America (CMAA) was formed in September 1954 in response to a widespread public concern over graphic violence and horror imagery in comic books. It named New York magistrate Charles F. Murphy (1920–1992), a specialist in juvenile delinquency, to head the organization and devise a self-policing &quot;code of ethics and standards&quot; for the industry. He established the Comics Code Authority (CCA), basing its code upon the largely unenforced code drafted by the Association of Comics Magazine Publishers in 1948, which in turn had been modeled loosely after the 1940 Hollywood Production Code, also known as the &quot;Hays Code&quot;.

Before the CCA was adopted, some cities already had organized public burnings and bans on comic books. The city councils of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Houston, Texas, passed ordinances banning crime and horror comics, although an attempt by Los Angeles County, California, was deemed unconstitutional by the courts. In his introduction to &quot;Archie Americana Series Best of the Fifties&quot;, editor Victor Gorelick reminisced about the code, writing, &quot;My first assignment, as a new art assistant, was to remove cleavages and lift up low cut blouses on Katy Keene.&quot; He also wrote of Archie artist Harry Lucey that, &quot;His sometimes suggestive storytelling–and he was one of the best–almost cost him his job. When his pencilled stories came in, the characters were dressed on one page only. A woman who was an inker, a woman, Terry Szenics, later had to draw clothes on the characters on the remaining pages.&quot;

Although the CCA had no official control over the comics publishers, most distributors refused to carry comics which did not carry the seal. However, two major publishers of comics–Dell Comics and Gold Key Comics–did not display the seal, because their output was subject to a higher authority: their licensors which included Walt Disney and the producers of many TV shows aimed at children.

=== Criticism and enforcement ===
Some publishers thrived under these restrictions, while others adapted by cancelling titles and focusing on code-approved content; still others went out of business. In practice, the negative effect of not having CCA approval was lack of distribution by the comic book wholesalers, who, as one historian observed, &quot;served as the enforcement arm of the Comics Code Authority by agreeing to handle only those comics with the seal.&quot;

Publisher William Gaines believed that clauses forbidding the words &quot;crime&quot;, &quot;horror&quot;, and &quot;terror&quot; in comic book titles had been deliberately aimed at his own best-selling titles &quot;Crime SuspenStories&quot;, &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot;, and &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;.

Wertham dismissed the code as an inadequate half-measure. Comics analyst Scott McCloud, on the other hand, later commented that it was as if, in drawing up the code, &quot;the list of requirements a film needs to receive a G rating was doubled, and there were no other acceptable ratings!&quot;

=== &quot;Judgment Day&quot; ===
In one early confrontation between a comic-book publisher and the code authorities, EC Comics&#x27; William Gaines reprinted the story &quot;Judgment Day&quot;, from the pre-code &quot;Weird Fantasy&quot; #18 (April 1953), in &quot;Incredible Science Fiction&quot; #33 (February 1956). The reprint was a replacement for the Code-rejected story &quot;An Eye for an Eye&quot;, drawn by Angelo Torres, though &quot;Judgment Day&quot; was itself also objected to because of the central character being black, despite there being nothing in the Code which prohibited a black protagonist. The story, by writer Al Feldstein and artist Joe Orlando, was an allegory against racial prejudice, a point which was necessarily nullified if the lead character was not black. After an order by code administrator Charles Murphy to change the final panel, which depicted a black astronaut, Gaines engaged in a heated dispute with Murphy. He threatened to inform the press of Murphy&#x27;s objection to the story if they did not give the issue the Code Seal, causing Murphy to reverse his initial decision and allow the story to run. Soon after, however, facing the severe restrictions placed upon his comics by the CCA, and with his &quot;New Direction&quot; titles floundering, Gaines quit publishing comic books to concentrate on &quot;Mad&quot;.

== 1954 Code criteria ==
The following shows the complete Code as it stood in 1954:

* Crimes shall never be presented in such a way as to create sympathy for the criminal, to promote distrust of the forces of law and justice, or to inspire others with a desire to imitate criminals.
* Scenes of excessive violence shall be prohibited. Scenes of brutal torture, excessive and unnecessary knife and gunplay, physical agony, the gory and gruesome crime shall be eliminated.
* Criminals shall not be presented so as to be rendered glamorous or to occupy a position which creates a desire for emulation.
* Policemen, judges, government officials, and respected institutions shall never be presented in such a way as to create disrespect for established authority.
* All scenes of horror, excessive bloodshed, gory or gruesome crimes, depravity, lust, sadism, masochism shall not be permitted.
* No comic magazine shall use the words &quot;horror&quot; or &quot;terror&quot; in its title.
* All lurid, unsavory, gruesome illustrations shall be eliminated.
* Inclusion of stories dealing with evil shall be used or shall be published only where the intent is to illustrate a moral issue and in no case shall evil be presented alluringly, nor so as to injure the sensibilities of the reader.
* In every instance good shall triumph over evil and the criminal punished for his misdeeds.
* If crime is depicted it shall be as a sordid and unpleasant activity.
* Scenes dealing with, or instruments associated with walking dead, torture, vampires and vampirism, ghouls, cannibalism, and werewolfism are prohibited.
* Profanity, obscenity, smut, vulgarity, or words or symbols which have acquired undesirable meanings are forbidden.
* Females shall be drawn realistically without exaggeration of any physical qualities.
* Suggestive and salacious illustration or suggestive posture is unacceptable.
* Nudity with meretricious purpose and salacious postures shall not be permitted in the advertising of any product; clothed figures shall never be presented in such a way as to be offensive or contrary to good taste or morals.
* Nudity in any form is prohibited, as is indecent or undue exposure.
* Illicit sex relations are neither to be hinted at nor portrayed. Rape scenes, as well as sexual abnormalities, are unacceptable.
* Sex perversion or any inference to same is strictly forbidden.
* Seduction and rape shall never be shown or suggested.
== 1960s–1970s ==
===&quot;Wolfman&quot; and credits===
Writer Marv Wolfman&#x27;s name was briefly a point of contention between DC Comics and the CCA. In the supernatural-mystery anthology &quot;House of Secrets&quot; #83 (Jan. 1970), the book&#x27;s host introduces the story &quot;The Stuff that Dreams are Made of&quot; as one told to him by &quot;a wandering wolfman&quot;. The CCA rejected the story and flagged the &quot;wolfman&quot; reference as a violation. Fellow writer Gerry Conway explained to the CCA that the term referred to Marv Wolfman. The CCA agreed that it would not be a violation, as long as Wolfman received a writer&#x27;s credit on the first page of the story; that led to DC beginning to credit creators in its supernatural-mystery anthologies.

=== Updating the Code ===
The Code was revised a number of times during 1971, initially on January 28, to allow for, among other things, the sometimes &quot;sympathetic depiction of criminal behavior... [and] corruption among public officials&quot; (&quot;as long as it is portrayed as exceptional and the culprit is punished&quot;) as well as permitting some criminal activities to kill law-enforcement officers and the &quot;suggestion but not portrayal of seduction.&quot; The clause &quot;suggestive posture is unacceptable&quot; was removed. Also newly allowed were &quot;vampires, ghouls and werewolves... when handled in the classic tradition such as Frankenstein, Dracula, and other high calibre literary works written by Edgar Allan Poe, Saki, Conan Doyle and other respected authors whose works are read in schools around the world&quot;. Zombies, lacking the requisite &quot;literary&quot; background, remained taboo. To get around this restriction, Marvel in the mid-1970s called the apparently deceased, mind-controlled followers of various Haitian supervillains &quot;zuvembies&quot;. This practice carried over to Marvel&#x27;s superhero line: in &quot;The Avengers&quot;, when the reanimated superhero Wonder Man returns from the dead, he is referred to as a &quot;zuvembie&quot;. DC comics published their own zombie story in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; #16 (May 1975), where the deceased rise from their graves, while a soul-devouring demon appears in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; #15 (April 1975).

Around this time, the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare approached Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Stan Lee to do a story about drug abuse. Lee agreed and wrote a three-part &quot;Spider-Man&quot; story, portraying drug use as dangerous and unglamorous. While the Code did not specifically forbid depictions of drugs, a general clause prohibited &quot;All elements or techniques not specifically mentioned herein, but which are contrary to the spirit and intent of the code, and are considered violations of good taste or decency&quot;. The CCA had approved at least one previous story involving drugs, the premiere of Deadman in &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; #205 (Oct. 1967), which clearly depicted the title character fighting opium smugglers (as well as the name &quot;Deadman&quot; being classed as a violation that was eventually allowed). However, Code administrator Leonard Darvin &quot;was ill&quot; at the time of the Spider-Man story, and acting administrator John L. Goldwater (publisher of Archie Comics) refused to grant Code approval because of the depiction of narcotics being used, regardless of the context, whereas the &quot;Deadman&quot; story had depicted only a wholesale business transaction.

Confident that the original government request would give him credibility, and with the approval of his publisher Martin Goodman, Lee ran the story in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #96–98 (May–July 1971), without CCA approval. The storyline was well received, and the CCA&#x27;s argument for denying approval was deemed counterproductive. &quot;That was the only big issue that we had&quot; with the Code, Lee recalled in a 1998 interview:

Lee and Marvel drew criticism from DC head Carmine Infantino &quot;for defying the code&quot;, stating that DC will not &quot;do any drug stories unless the code is changed&quot;. As a result of publicity surrounding the Department of Health, Education and Welfare&#x27;s sanctioning of the storyline, however, the CCA revised the Code to permit the depiction of &quot;narcotics or drug addiction&quot; if presented &quot;as a vicious habit&quot;. DC itself then broached the topic in the Code-approved &quot;Green Lantern/Green Arrow&quot; #85 (Sept. 1971), with writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil and artist Neal Adams beginning a story arc involving Green Arrow&#x27;s teen sidekick Speedy as a heroin addict. A cover line read, &quot;DC attacks youth&#x27;s greatest problem... Drugs!&quot;

== 1980s–1990s ==
Throughout the 80s and 90s, there was a break away from the Comics Code Authority. In 1984, the Comics Code Authority denied &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; issue #29 the seal of approval; however, DC decided to continue publishing the title without the approval. Some subsequent DC series, including &quot;Watchmen&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; (1986), launched without ever receiving the CCA Seal of approval. For example, the adult content-geared 1993 DC Vertigo imprint did not launch with CCA approval.

A late adopter of the code was Now Comics, which began displaying the Code seal on titles released in early 1989.

== Abandonment and legacy ==
The CCA rejected an issue of the Marvel Comics series &quot;X-Force&quot;, requiring changes to be made in 2001. Instead, Marvel stopped submitting its comics to the CCA and subsequently established its own rating system.

Bongo Comics discontinued using the Code without any announcements regarding its abandonment in 2010.

The CMAA, at some point in the 2000s, was managed by the trade-organization management firm the Kellen Company, which ceased its involvement in 2009. In 2010, some publishers, including Archie, placed the seal on their comics without submitting them to the CMAA. Archie Comics President Mike Pellerito said that the code did not affect his company the way that it did others as &quot;we aren&#x27;t about to start stuffing bodies into refrigerators.&quot; DC Comics announced on January 20, 2011, that it would discontinue participation, adopting a rating system similar to Marvel&#x27;s. The company noted that it submitted comics for approval through December 2010, but would not say to whom they were submitted. A day later, Archie Comics, the only other publisher still participating in the Code, announced it also was discontinuing it, rendering the Code defunct.

The vast majority of advertisers had ceased making decisions on the basis of the CCA stamp over the past few years, according to a January 24, 2011 Newsarama report. Most new publishers to emerge during this time did not join the CCA, regardless of whether their content conformed to its standards. The Comic Book Legal Defense Fund announced that it would acquire the intellectual property rights to the Comics Code seal from the defunct CMAA on September 29, 2011.

The Comics Code seal can be seen among the production logos in the opening shots of the 2018 superhero film &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot;, and its 2023 sequel, &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot;. Binge Books announced that it had used the seal on the one-shot comic &quot;Heroes Union&quot;, produced by Roger Stern, Ron Frenz, and Sal Buscema in May 2021.

<text>Chinese units of measurement, known in Chinese as the shìzhì (&quot;market system&quot;), are the traditional units of measurement of the Han Chinese. Although Chinese numerals have been decimal (base-10) since the Shang, several Chinese measures use hexadecimal (base-16). Local applications have varied, but the Chinese dynasties usually proclaimed standard measurements and recorded their predecessor&#x27;s systems in their histories.

In the present day, the People&#x27;s Republic of China maintains some customary units based upon the market units but standardized to round values in the metric system, for example the common &quot;jin&quot; or catty of exactly 500g. The Chinese name for most metric units is based on that of the closest traditional unit; when confusion might arise, the word &quot;market&quot; (, &quot;shì&quot;) is used to specify the traditional unit and &quot;common&quot; or &quot;public&quot; (, &quot;gōng&quot;) is used for the metric value. Taiwan, like Korea, saw its traditional units standardized to Japanese values and their conversion to a metric basis, such as the Taiwanese &quot;ping&quot; of about 3.306m2 based on the square &quot;ken&quot;. The Hong Kong SAR continues to use its traditional units, now legally defined based on a local equation with metric units. For instance, the Hong Kong catty is precisely .

Note: The names &quot;lí&quot; ( or ) and &quot;fēn&quot; () for small units are the same for length, area, and mass; however, they refer to different kinds of measurements.

==History==
According to the &quot;Liji&quot;, the legendary Yellow Emperor created the first measurement units. The &quot;Xiao Erya&quot; and the &quot;Kongzi Jiayu&quot; state that length units were derived from the human body. According to the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, these human body units caused inconsistency, and Yu the Great, another legendary figure, unified the length measurements. Rulers with decimal units have been unearthed from Shang dynasty tombs.

In the Zhou dynasty, the king conferred nobles with powers of the state and the measurement units began to be inconsistent from state to state. After the Warring States period, Qin Shi Huang unified China, and later standardized measurement units. In the Han dynasty, these measurements were still being used, and were documented systematically in the Book of Han.

Astronomical instruments show little change of the length of chi in the following centuries, since the calendar needed to be consistent. It was not until the introduction of decimal units in the Ming dynasty that the traditional system was revised.

===Republican Era===

On 7 January 1915, the Beiyang government promulgated a measurement law to use not only metric system as the standard but also a set of Chinese-style measurement based directly on the Qing dynasty definitions ().

On 16 February 1929, the Nationalist government adopted and promulgated &quot;The Weights and Measures Act&quot; to adopt the metric system as the official standard and to limit the newer Chinese units of measurement () to private sales and trade in Article 11, effective on 1 January 1930. These newer &quot;market&quot; units are based on rounded metric numbers.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===
The Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China continued using the market system along with metric system, as decreed by the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on 25 June 1959, but 1 catty being 500 grams, would become divided into 10 (new) taels, instead of 16 (old) taels, to be converted from province to province, while exempting Chinese prescription drugs from the conversion to prevent errors.

On 27 February 1984, the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China decreed the market system to remain acceptable until the end of 1990 and ordered the transition to the national legal measures by that time, but farmland measures would be exempt from this mandatory metrication until further investigation and study.

===Hong Kong===

In 1976 the Hong Kong Metrication Ordinance allowed a gradual replacement of the system in favor of the International System of Units (SI) metric system. The Weights and Measures Ordinance defines the metric, Imperial, and Chinese units. As of 2012, all three systems are legal for trade and are in widespread use.

===Macau===
On 24 August 1992, Macau published &quot;Law No. 14/92/M&quot; to order that Chinese units of measurement similar to those used in Hong Kong, Imperial units, and United States customary units would be permissible for five years since the effective date of the Law, 1 January 1993, on the condition of indicating the corresponding SI values, then for three more years thereafter, Chinese, Imperial, and US units would be permissible as secondary to the SI.

== Ancient Chinese units ==
===Length===

Traditional units of length include the &quot;chi&quot; (), &quot;bu&quot; (), and &quot;li&quot; (). The precise length of these units, and the ratios between these units, has varied over time. 1 &quot;bu&quot; has consisted of either 5 or 6 &quot;chi&quot;, while 1 &quot;li&quot; has consisted of 300 or 360 &quot;bu&quot;.

== Modern Chinese units ==
All &quot;metric values&quot; given in the tables are exact unless otherwise specified by the approximation sign &#x27;~&#x27;.

Certain units are also listed at List of Chinese classifiers → Measurement units.
=== Length ===

====Chinese length units promulgated in 1915====
====Chinese length units effective in 1930====

====Metric length units====
The Chinese word for metre is &quot;mǐ&quot;; this can take the Chinese standard SI prefixes (for &quot;kilo-&quot;, &quot;centi-&quot;, etc.). A kilometre, however, may also be called &quot;gōnglǐ&quot;, i.e. a metric &quot;lǐ&quot;.

In the engineering field, traditional units are rounded up to metric units. For example, the Chinese word (T) or (S) &quot;sī&quot; is used to express 0.01 mm.
==== Hong Kong and Macau length units ====
These correspond to the measures listed simply as &quot;China&quot; in &quot;The Measures, Weights, &amp; Moneys of All Nations&quot;
=== Area ===

====Chinese area units promulgated in 1915====


====Chinese area units effective in 1930====


====Metric and other area units====
Metric and other standard length units can be squared by the addition of the prefix &quot;píngfāng&quot;. For example, a square kilometre is &quot;píngfāng gōnglǐ&quot;.

==== Macau area units ====
=== Volume ===
These units are used to measure cereal grains, among other things. In imperial times, the physical standard for these was the jialiang.

====Chinese volume units promulgated in 1915====
====Chinese volume units effective in 1930====
====Metric volume units====
In the case of volume, the market and metric &quot;shēng&quot; coincide, being equal to one litre as shown in the table. The Chinese standard SI prefixes (for &quot;milli-&quot;, &quot;centi-&quot;, etc.) may be added to this word &quot;shēng&quot;.

Units of volume can also be obtained from any standard unit of length using the prefix &quot;lìfāng&quot; (&quot;cubic&quot;), as in &quot;lìfāng mǐ&quot; for one cubic metre.

==== Macau volume units ====
=== Mass ===
These units are used to measure the mass of objects. They are also famous for measuring monetary objects such as gold and silver.

====Chinese mass units promulgated in 1915====
====Mass units in the Republic of China since 1930====
====Mass units in the People&#x27;s Republic of China since 1959====
====Metric mass units====
The Chinese word for gram is &quot;kè&quot;; this can take the Chinese standard SI prefixes (for &quot;milli-&quot;, &quot;deca-&quot;, and so on). A kilogram, however, is commonly called &quot;gōngjīn&quot;, i.e. a metric &quot;jīn&quot;.

==== Hong Kong and Macau mass units ====
==== Hong Kong troy units ====
These are used for trading precious metals such as gold and silver.

==Historiography==
As there were hundreds of unofficial measures in use, the bibliography is quite vast. The editions of Wu Chenglou&#x27;s 1937 &quot;History of Chinese Measurement&quot; were the usual standard up to the 1980s or so, but rely mostly on surviving literary accounts. Newer research has put more emphasis on archeological discoveries. Qiu Guangming &amp; Zhang Yanming&#x27;s 2005 bilingual &quot;Concise History of Ancient Chinese Measures and Weights&quot; summarizes these findings. A relatively recent and comprehensive bibliography, organized by period studied, has been compiled in 2012 by Cao &amp; al.; for a shorter list, see Wilkinson&#x27;s year 2000 &quot;Chinese History&quot;.

<doc id="147236" wikidata="Q150668" url="?curid=147236" title="Heptane">
<text>Heptane or &quot;n&quot;-heptane is the straight-chain alkane with the chemical formula H3C(CH2)5CH3 or C7H16. When used as a test fuel component in anti-knock test engines, a 100% heptane fuel is the zero point of the octane rating scale (the 100 point is 100% iso-octane). Octane number equates to the anti-knock qualities of a comparison mixture of heptane and iso-octane which is expressed as the percentage of iso-octane in heptane, and is listed on pumps for gasoline (petrol) dispensed globally.

== History ==
Normal heptane was discovered in 1862 by Carl Schorlemmer, who, while analyzing pyrolysis products of the cannel coal mined in Wigan, identified, separated by fractional distillation and studied a series of liquid hydrocarbons inert to nitric and sulfuric acids. One of them, which he called hydride of heptyl (oenanthyl), had an empirical formula of C7H16, density of 0.709 at 18 °C and boiled between 98 and 99 °C. In the next year he identified the same compound in the Pennsylvanian oil. By 1872 he switched his nomenclature to the modern one.

During the American Civil War and shortly thereafter Californians discovered that some pines gave turpentine with unusual properties. It took until 1879 to identify heptane as the cause of that (see below for details), and only by the end of the century was this fact accepted by European chemists.

==Uses==
Heptane and its many isomers are widely used in laboratories as a non-polar solvent. As a liquid, it is ideal for transport and storage. In the grease spot test, heptane is used to dissolve an oil spot to show the previous presence of organic compounds on a stained paper. This is done by shaking the stained paper in a heptane solution for about half a minute.

Aqueous bromine may be distinguished from aqueous iodine by its appearance after extraction into heptane. In water, both bromine and iodine appear brown. However, iodine turns purple when dissolved in heptane, whereas the bromine solution remains brown.

Heptane is commercially available as both pure and mixed isomers for use in paints and coatings, as the rubber cement solvent &quot;Bestine&quot;, the outdoor stove fuel &quot;Powerfuel&quot; by Primus, as pure &quot;n&quot;-heptane for research and development and pharmaceutical manufacturing and as a minor component of gasoline (petrol). On average, gasoline is about 1% heptane.

Heptane is also used as an adhesive remover by stamp collectors. Since 1974, the United States Postal Service has issued self-adhesive stamps that some collectors find difficult to separate from envelopes via the traditional method of soaking in water. Heptane-based products like Bestine, as well as limonene-based products, have become popular solvents for removing stamps more easily.

===Octane rating scale===
&quot;n&quot;-Heptane is defined as the zero point of the octane rating scale. It is a lighter component in gasoline and burns more explosively, causing engine pre-ignition (knocking) in its pure form, as opposed to octane isomers, which burn more slowly and give less knocking. It was originally chosen as the zero point of the scale because of the availability of very high purity &quot;n&quot;-heptane, unmixed with other isomers of heptane or other alkanes, distilled from the resin of Jeffrey pine and from the fruit of &quot;Pittosporum resiniferum&quot;. Other sources of heptane and octane, produced from crude oil, contain a mixture of different isomers with greatly differing ratings, and do not give as precise a zero point.

==Isomers and enantiomers==

Heptane has nine isomers, or eleven if enantiomers are counted:
* Heptane (&quot;n&quot;-heptane), H3C–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3,
* 2-Methylhexane (isoheptane), H3C–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH3,
* 3-Methylhexane, H3C–CH2–C*H(CH3)–CH2–CH2–CH3 (chiral),
* 2,2-Dimethylpentane (neoheptane), H3C–C(CH3)2–CH2–CH2–CH3,
* 2,3-Dimethylpentane, H3C–CH(CH3)–C*H(CH3)–CH2–CH3 (chiral),
* 2,4-Dimethylpentane, H3C–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH3,
* 3,3-Dimethylpentane, H3C–CH2–C(CH3)2–CH2–CH3,
* 3-Ethylpentane, H3C–CH2–CH(CH2CH3)–CH2–CH3,
* 2,2,3-Trimethylbutane, H3C–C(CH3)2–CH(CH3)–CH3, also known as pentamethylethane and triptane.

==Preparation==
The linear &quot;n&quot;-heptane can be obtained from Jeffrey pine oil. The six branched isomers without a quaternary carbon can be prepared by creating a suitable secondary or tertiary alcohol by the Grignard reaction, converting it to an alkene by dehydration, and hydrogenating the latter. The 2,2-dimethylpentane isomer can be prepared by reacting &quot;tert&quot;-butyl chloride with &quot;n&quot;-propyl magnesium bromide. The 3,3-dimethylpentane isomer can be prepared from &quot;tert&quot;-amyl chloride and ethyl magnesium bromide.

==Health risks==

Acute exposure to heptane vapors can cause dizziness, stupor, incoordination, loss of appetite, nausea, dermatitis, chemical pneumonitis, unconsciousness, or possible peripheral neuropathy.

In a CDC study, it was found that prolonged exposure to heptane may also cause a state of intoxication and uncontrolled hilarity in some participants and a stupor lasting for 30 minutes after exposure for others. Prolonged exposure can also lead to skin dryness or cracking, since the substance defats skin.

According to information from the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services, &quot;n&quot;-heptane can penetrate the skin, and further health effects may occur immediately or shortly after exposure to it. Exposure to &quot;n&quot;-heptane may lead to short-term health effects like irritation of the eyes, nose, or throat, headache, dizziness, or loss of consciousness; and chronic health effects, like reduced memory and concentration, sleep disturbance, and reduced coordination due to its effects on the nervous system.

Upon chronic exposure, it can pose a reproductive hazard or cancer risks.

<text>Koudou Laurent Gbagbo (Gagnoa Bété: ; ; born 31 May 1945) is an Ivorian politician who was the president of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire from 2000 until his arrest in April 2011. He was the first president in the history of the country that was a centre-left politician. A historian, Gbagbo was imprisoned in the early 1970s and again in the early 1990s, and he lived in exile in France during much of the 1980s as a result of his union activism. Gbagbo founded the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) in 1982 and ran unsuccessfully for president against Félix Houphouët-Boigny at the start of multi-party politics in 1990. He won a seat in the National Assembly of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire in 1990.

Gbagbo claimed victory after Robert Guéï, head of a military junta, barred other leading politicians from running in the October 2000 presidential election. The Ivorian people took to the streets, toppling Guéï. Gbagbo was then installed as president.

In the 2010 presidential election, Alassane Ouattara defeated Gbagbo, and was recognized as the winner by election observers, the international community, the African Union (AU), and the Economic Community of West African States. However, Gbagbo refused to step down, despite mounting international pressure. The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) announced that Ouattara had won the race with 54% of the vote, a tally that the United Nations concluded was credible; however, the Constitutional Council, a body dominated by pro-Gbagbo members, annulled the results in Ouattara&#x27;s electoral strongholds in the north, claiming fraud, and declared Gbagbo the winner with 51% of the vote. In December 2010, both Gbagbo and Ouattara assumed the presidency, triggering a short period of civil conflict in which about 3,000 people were killed.

Gbagbo was arrested in 2011 by pro-Ouattara forces, who were supported by French troops. Gbagbo was extradited to The Hague in November 2011, where he was charged with four counts of crimes against humanity in the International Criminal Court (ICC) in connection with the post-election violence. Gbagbo was the first former head of state to be taken into the court&#x27;s custody. In January 2019, an ICC panel dismissed the charges against Gbagbo and one of his former ministers, Charles Blé Goudé, determining that the evidence presented was insufficient to prove that the pair committed crimes against humanity. Prosecutors appealed the decision, and Gbagbo was prohibited from returning to Côte d&#x27;Ivoire pending the appeal proceedings. The ICC ultimately upheld Gbagbo&#x27;s acquittal, and in April 2021, Ouattara stated he and Blé Goudé were free to return to the country.

== Early life and academic career ==
Laurent Gbagbo was born on 31 May 1945 to a Roman Catholic family of the Bété people in Gagnoa in the then French West Africa. He became a history professor and an opponent of the regime of President Félix Houphouët-Boigny. He was imprisoned from 31 March 1971 to January 1973. In 1979, he obtained his doctorate at Paris Diderot University. In 1980, he became Director of the Institute of History, Art, and African Archeology at the University of Abidjan. He participated in a 1982 teachers&#x27; strike as a member of the National Trade Union of Research and Higher Education. Gbagbo went into exile in France.

During the 1982 strike, Koudou Gbagbo formed what would become the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI). He returned to Côte d&#x27;Ivoire on 13 September 1988 and at the FPI&#x27;s constitutive congress, held on 19–20 November 1988, he was elected as the party&#x27;s Secretary-General.

Gbagbo said in July 2008 that he had received crucial support from Blaise Compaoré, formerly the President of Burkina Faso, while he was part of the underground opposition to Houphouët-Boigny.

Following the introduction of multiparty politics in 1990, Gbagbo challenged Houphouët-Boigny in the October 1990 presidential election. Gbagbo contended that Houphouët-Boigny, who was either 85 or 90 years old (depending on the source), was not likely to survive a seventh five-year term. This failed to resonate with voters, and Gbagbo officially received 18.3% of the vote against Houphouët-Boigny. In the November 1990 parliamentary election, Gbagbo won a seat in the National Assembly, along with eight other members of the FPI.

Gbagbo was elected to a seat from Ouragahio District in Gagnoa Department and was President of the FPI Parliamentary Group from 1990 to 1995. In 1992 he was sentenced to two years in prison and charged with inciting violence, but was released later in the year. The FPI boycotted the 1995 presidential election. In 1996 Gbagbo was re-elected to his seat in the National Assembly from Ouragahio, following a delay in the holding of the election there, and in the same year he was elected as President of the FPI.

At the FPI&#x27;s 3rd Ordinary Congress on 9–11 July 1999, Gbagbo was chosen as the FPI&#x27;s candidate for the October 2000 presidential election. That election took place after a December 1999 coup in which retired general Robert Guéï took power. Guéï refused to allow his predecessor as president, Henri Konan Bédié, or former prime minister Alassane Ouattara to run, leaving Gbagbo as the only significant opposition candidate. Guéï claimed victory in the election, held on 22 October 2000. However, after it emerged that Gbagbo had actually won by a significant margin, street protests forced Guéï to flee the capital. Gbagbo installed himself as president on 26 October.

==Civil war==

Following the contested election of 2000, there were violent clashes between supporters of the FPI and supporters of the RDR. A mass grave of 57 bodies was found in Yopougon, Abidjan, in November 2000, containing the corpses of RDR supporters killed by FPI-aligned militias. The RDR launched an electoral boycott of the December 2000 elections to the parliament. The following month, an attempted coup d&#x27;etat against Gbagbo occurred. The government then intensified a crackdown on northerners and those thought to be Alassane Ouattara supporters; many were jailed or killed.

On 19 September 2002 a revolt by northerners against Gbagbo&#x27;s government partly failed. The rebels, calling themselves the &quot;Forces Nouvelles&quot;, attempted to seize the cities of Abidjan, Bouaké, and Korhogo. They failed to take Abidjan, but were successful in the other two cities, as Gbagbo loyalists, with French military assistance, repulsed the attack. Rebels of the Patriotic Movement of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire took control of the northern part of the country.

In March 2003, a new cross-party agreement was made for the formation of a new government led by a consensus figure, Seydou Diarra, and including nine ministers from the rebels, and one year later, UN peacekeeping forces arrived in the country. In March 2004, however, an anti-Gbagbo rally took place in Abidjan; government soldiers responded by killing some 120 people. A subsequent UN report concluded that Ivorian government was responsible for the massacre.

==Post-Civil War==

The peace agreement effectively collapsed in early November 2004 following elections that critics claimed were undemocratic and the rebels&#x27; subsequent refusal to disarm. During an airstrike in Bouaké on 6 November 2004, nine French soldiers were killed. While the Ivorian government has claimed the attack on the French soldiers was accidental, French governmental sources claimed it was deliberate and responded by destroying most Ivorian military aircraft.

With the late October deadline approaching in 2006, it was regarded as very unlikely that the election would in fact be held by that point, and the opposition and the rebels rejected the possibility of another term extension for Gbagbo. The UN Security Council endorsed another one-year extension of Gbagbo&#x27;s term on 1 November 2006; to not forget, many of the rebels held their guns and were prepared to advance again, however, the resolution provided for the strengthening of Prime Minister Charles Konan Banny&#x27;s powers. Gbagbo said the next day that elements of the resolution deemed to be constitutional violations would not be applied.

A peace deal between the government and the rebels, or New Forces, was signed on 4 March 2007, in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, and subsequently Guillaume Soro, leader of the New Forces, became prime minister. Those events were seen by some observers as substantially strengthening Gbagbo&#x27;s position.

Gbagbo visited the north for the first time since the outbreak of the war for a disarmament ceremony, the &quot;peace flame&quot;, on 30 July 2007. This ceremony involved burning weapons to symbolize the end of the conflict. At the ceremony, Gbagbo declared the war over and said that the country should move quickly to elections, which were then planned for early 2008.

On 30 August 2008, Gbagbo was designated the FPI&#x27;s candidate for the November 2008 presidential election at a party congress; he was the only candidate for the FPI nomination. The presidential election was again postponed to 2010.

==2010 presidential election and post-election violence==

In 2010, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire had a presidential election. Gbagbo, whose mandate had expired in 2005, had delayed the election several times. In the first round, Gbagbo faced 14 challengers; the two main ones were Henri Konan Bédié, who had been deposed in a coup eleven years earlier, and Alassane Ouattara, a former prime minister and IMF official. In the first round, no candidate secured a majority of more than 50%, triggering a runoff between the top two vote-getters: Gbagbo (who had received 38% of the vote in the first round) and Ouattara (who received 32% of the vote in the first round).

On 28 November 2010, the second round of the presidential election was held. Four days later the Independent Election Commission (CEI) declared Ouattara the winner with 54.1% of the vote. Gbagbo&#x27;s party complained of fraud and ordered that votes from nine regions occupied by the ex-rebels &quot;became FN after the Ouagadougou agreement&quot; be annulled, but the claims were disputed by the Ivorian Electoral Commission and international election observers. The Constitutional Council nullified the CEI&#x27;s declaration based on alleged voting fraud, and excluded votes from nine northern areas.

The Constitutional Council concluded that without these votes Gbagbo won with 51% of the remaining vote. The constitutional restriction on Presidents serving more than ten years was not addressed. With a significant portion of the country&#x27;s vote nullified, especially in areas where Ouattara polled well, tensions mounted in the country. Gbagbo ordered the army to close the borders and foreign news organizations were banned from broadcasting from within the country. United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged the government to &quot;act responsibly and peacefully.&quot;

Gbagbo declared that &quot;I will continue to work with all the countries of the world, but I will never give up our sovereignty.&quot; On 4 December 2010, one day after military leadership pledged their continuing loyalty to him, Gbagbo again took the oath of office in a ceremony broadcast on state television. Gbagbo&#x27;s claim to continue in office was not accepted internationally, and rejected by the France, the U.S., the United Nations, the African Union, and the regional bloc ECOWAS, all of which recognized Ouattara as the duly elected president and called for Gbagbo to respect the will of the people.

Gbagbo responded by launching ethnic attacks on northerners living in Abidjan with his army made up partly of Liberian mercenaries, and rumours (unconfirmed because of restrictions on the movement of peacekeeping forces) of pro-Gbagbo death squads and mass graves have been reported to representatives of the UN. Gbagbo is mainly supported by the largely Christian south; his opponents are mostly concentrated in the Muslim north. When Nigeria demanded Gbagbo step down and the EU began imposing sanctions and freezing assets, Gbagbo demanded that UN peacekeepers and French troops leave the country. Leaders of the Forces Nouvelles (former rebels) asserted that Gbagbo was not the head of state and could not make such a request and also asserted that the demand was a part of a plan to commit genocide against northerners, as stated by Gbagbo&#x27;s Minister of Youth and Employment.

The ensuing post-election violence resulted in the death of 3,000 people, and the displacement of between a half-million to a million other people. On 11 April 2011, forces loyal to Ouattara supported by the French and UN forces moved to seize Gbagbo at his residence in Abidjan after failed negotiations to end the presidential succession crisis. According to Ouattara, his forces established a security perimeter at the residence, where Gbagbo had sought refuge in a subterranean level, and were waiting for him to run out of food and water. The UN had insisted that he be arrested, judged and tried for crimes against humanity during his term and since the election of Ouattara.

===Arrest and transfer to the International Criminal Court===
On 10 April 2011, UN and French helicopters fired rockets at the presidential residence. French special forces assisted forces loyal to Ouattara, the internationally recognized president, in their advance upon the compound. Gbagbo was captured in the bunker below the compound and placed under arrest by the Ouattara forces. Gbagbo&#x27;s lawyer stated that the government forces were able to storm the residence after French troops blasted a wall, opening up a &quot;getaway&quot; tunnel that had been dug on the orders of Gbagbo&#x27;s predecessor, Félix Houphouët-Boigny, and subsequently walled up by Gbagbo.

Gbagbo was held in the Golf Hotel in Abidjan by Ouattara&#x27;s forces, and requested protection from UN peacekeepers. Speaking from the hotel, Gbagbo told the regular armies to stop fighting. U.S. President Barack Obama welcomed news of the developments and CNN quoted U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as saying that Gbagbo&#x27;s capture &quot;sends a strong signal to dictators and tyrants. ... They may not disregard the voice of their own people&quot;.

In October 2011, the International Criminal Court opened an investigation into acts of violence committed during the conflict after the election, and ICC chief prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo visited the country. The following month, the ICC formally issued an arrest warrant for Gbagbo, charging him with four counts of crimes against humanity – murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, persecution and other inhuman acts allegedly committed between 16 December 2010 and 12 April 2011.

Gbagbo was arrested in Korhogo, where he had been placed under house arrest, and was placed on a flight to The Hague on 29 November 2011. An adviser to Gbagbo described the arrest as &quot;victors&#x27; justice&quot;. Conversely, human rights groups hailed Gbagbo&#x27;s arrest while also stating that pro-Ouattara forces that committed crimes should also be held accountable.

In 2012, Gbagbo&#x27;s former budget minister Justin Kone Katinan, a close Gbagbo ally, was arrested on an international warrant in Accra, Ghana, on charges of robbery arising from looting of banks in Ivory Coast. The following year, a Ghanaian magistrate rejected the extradition request, determining that the warrant issued by the Ivorian government was politically motivated.

===Proceedings in the ICC and acquittal===
The confirmation of charges hearing was scheduled for 18 June 2012, but was postponed to 13 August 2012, to give his defense team more time to prepare. The hearing was then postponed indefinitely, citing concerns over Gbagbo&#x27;s health.

Gbagbo&#x27;s trial at the ICC began on 28 January 2016, where he denied all charges against him; crimes against humanity including murder, rape and persecution, as did his co-accused Charles Blé Goudé. Due to presenting a flight risk and maintaining a network of supporters, judges ordered him to remain in detention during his trial. From January 2016 to January 2018, ICC prosecutors presented the testimony of 82 witnesses and thousands of pieces of evidence. Gbagbo filed a &quot;no case to answer&quot; motion in July 2018, and hearings were held in November 2018.

On 15 January 2019 Gbagbo and Goudé were acquitted by an ICC panel and their release was ordered. Presiding Judge Cuno Tarfusser and Judge Geoffrey Henderson ruled in favor of release; Judge Olga Carbuccia issued a dissenting opinion.

Many within the Ivory Coast celebrated Gbagbo&#x27;s acquittal. Amnesty International called the acquittal of Gbagbo and Blé Goudé &quot;a crushing disappointment to victims of post-election violence in Cote d’Ivoire&quot; but noted that the Office of the Prosecutor was likely to appeal. The proceedings against Gbagbo were the first against a head of state undertaken by the ICC, and the failure of the ICC to convict Gbagbo for the mass atrocities was said by analysts to significantly impair the credibility of the ICC as a court of last resort.

===Appeal===
The ICC (International Criminal Court) panel ordered Gbagbo&#x27;s immediate release, but the ICC Appeals Chamber ordered that Gbagbo remain in custody pending consideration of ICC prosecutors&#x27; appeal against Gbagbo&#x27;s acquittal. On 1 February 2019, he was released after ICC Appeals Chamber granted Gbagbo conditional release from detention; he was allowed to live in Belgium, but had to be available to return to court, and could not leave Belgium. Gbagbo&#x27;s lawyers then petitioned the ICC for Gbagbo&#x27;s unconditional release.

On 28 May 2020, the International Criminal Court gave Gbagbo permission to leave Belgium if certain conditions were met. At the time, it was unclear if he would be allowed to return to Côte d&#x27;Ivoire.

On 30 October 2020, Gbagbo said the 2020 Ivorian presidential election spells &quot;disaster&quot; for the country, in his first public comments since being toppled in 2011. He gave the interview in Belgium, where he was awaiting the outcome of proceedings against him.

In March 2021, the ICC upheld Gbagbo&#x27;s acquittal. Shortly afterwards, Ouattara stated he was free to return to Côte d&#x27;Ivoire.

=== Return to Cote d&#x27;Ivoire ===
After his acquittal was confirmed, current Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara, Gbagbo&#x27;s rival, invited him back to Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. He arrived in Adbidjan on 17 June 2021, on a commercial flight from Brussels, where he had been living for the previous three years after being released from detention. Ouattara arranged him a diplomatic passport, and promised him the benefits that are typically given to ex-presidents, including state-provided security and a state pension.

Six of Gbagbo&#x27;s former allies also returned after spending years in exile after being encouraged by the current president Ouattara. In October 2021, Gbagbo launched a new political party called the African People&#x27;s Party – Cote d&#x27;Ivoire (PPA-CI). In December 2021, he spent four days in Ghana. According to a statement from his party, he went there to attend the funeral of Captain Kojo Tsikata, a man close to the former president of Ghana Jerry Rawlings. Laurent Gbagbo also visited the Ivorian exiles, whose return he wanted to the country since the Ivorian crisis, 11,000 Ivorians fled the post-election crisis to seek asylum in neighboring Ghana.

On 10 March 2024, Gbagbo said that he would run again for president as leader of the PPA-CI in elections to be held in October 2025.
