<doc id="141361" wikidata="Q2119451" url="?curid=141361" title="Thomas D'Arcy McGee">
<text>Thomas D&#x27;Arcy McGee (13 April 18257 April 1868) was an Irish-Canadian politician, Catholic spokesman, journalist, poet, and a Father of Canadian Confederation. The young McGee was an Irish Catholic who opposed British rule in Ireland, and was part of the Young Ireland attempts to overthrow British rule and create an independent Irish Republic. He escaped arrest and fled to the United States in 1848, after which some of his political positions reversed. He remained ardently Catholic, but his Irish nationalism moderated. He became disgusted with American republicanism, Anti-Catholicism, and classical liberalism. McGee became intensely monarchistic in his political beliefs and in his religious support for the embattled Pope Pius IX.

He moved to the Province of Canada in 1857 and worked hard to convince fellow Irish Canadians to cooperate with Canadian Protestants in forming a self-governing Canada within the British Empire. His passion for Confederation garnered him the title: &#x27;Canada&#x27;s first nationalist&#x27;. McGee also vocally denounced the activities of the Fenian Brotherhood, a paramilitary secret society of exiled Irish Republicans who resembled his younger self politically, in Ireland, Canada, and the United States. McGee succeeded in helping achieve Confederation in 1867, but was assassinated by the Fenian Brotherhood, which considered McGee guilty of Shoneenism, in 1868. Montreal Fenian Brotherhood member Patrick J. Whelan was convicted of McGee&#x27;s murder and executed.

==Early life==

Widely known as D&#x27;Arcy McGee, he was born on 13 April 1825 in Carlingford, Ireland, and raised as a Roman Catholic. From his mother, the daughter of a Dublin bookseller he learned the history of Ireland, which later influenced his writing and political activity. When he was eight years old, his family moved to Wexford, where his father, James McGee, was employed by the Irish coast guard (then under His Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard and likely at the Wexford Town Station near Customs House Quay.

In Wexford he attended a local hedge school, where the teacher, Michael Donnelly, fed his hunger for knowledge and where he learned of the long history of British rule and Irish opposition, including the more recent uprising of 1798. In 1842 at age 17, McGee left Ireland with his sister due to a poor relationship with their stepmother, Margaret Dea, who had married his father in 1840 after the death of his mother 22 August 1833. In 1842 he sailed from Wexford harbour aboard the brig &quot;Leo&quot;, bound for the United States. On the &quot;Leo&quot; he wrote many of his early poems, mostly about Ireland.

He soon found work as assistant editor of Patrick Donahoe&#x27;s &quot;Boston Pilot&quot;, a Catholic newspaper in Boston, Massachusetts. He specialized in articles expounding the movement for Irish self-determination led by Daniel O’Connell. He became the lead editor in 1844, While writing widely as well on Irish literature and politics. He advocated the union of Canada into the United States, saying, &quot;Either by purchase, conquest, or stipulation, Canada must be yielded by Great Britain to this Republic.&quot;

In 1845, he returned to Ireland where he became politically active and edited &quot;The Nation&quot;, the voice of the Young Ireland movement. In 1847, he married Mary Theresa Caffrey; they had six children but only two daughters survived their father. His involvement in the Irish Confederation and Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848 resulted in a warrant for his arrest. McGee escaped disguised as a priest and returned to the United States.

==United States==
In the United States, he achieved prominence in Irish-American circles and founded and edited the New York-based &quot;Nation&quot; and the Boston-based &quot;American Celt&quot;. He also wrote a number of history books. In common with several other Young Ireland &quot;émigrés&quot;, McGee espoused proslavery thought and defended the continuation of slavery in the United States. In the 4 August 1849 edition of the &quot;Nation&quot;, McGee attacked supporters of the abolitionist Daniel O&#x27;Connell in the United States, writing that &quot;Their task is to liberate their slaves, not to travel across the Atlantic for foreign objects of sympathy.&quot;

McGee eventually grew disillusioned with democracy, republicanism and the United States. Historian David Gerber traces a dramatic transformation from the Young Ireland revolutionary who sought a peasant insurrection to expel the British from Ireland. Gerber writes:
:After 1851, however, he veered increasingly toward the opposite pole, espousing an ultramontane conservatism... Catholic dogma and triumphalism, anti-Protestantism, cultural nationalism, and social conservatism were the framework of McGee&#x27;s thought during the 1850s.

He emigrated to Montreal in 1857, believing Canada was far more hospitable to the Catholic Irish than was the United States. He downplayed the importance of the Orange Order in Canada. He remained a persistent critic of American institutions, and of the American way of life. He accused the Americans of hostile and expansionist motives toward Canada and of desiring to spread its republican ideas over all of North America. McGee worked energetically for continued Canadian devotion to the British Empire seeing in imperialism the protection Canada needed from all American ills.

==Canada==
In 1857, he set up the publication of the &quot;New Era&quot; in Montreal, Quebec. In his editorials and pamphlets he attacked the influence of the Orange Order and defended the Irish Catholic right to representation in the assembly. In terms of economics he promoted modernisation, calling for extensive economic development by means of railway construction, the fostering of immigration, and the application of a high protective tariff to encourage manufacturing. Politically active, he advocated a new nationality in Canada, to escape the sectarianism of Ireland. In 1858, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada and worked for the creation of an independent Canada. McGee earned a law degree at McGill University and was called to the bar in 1861.

McGee became the minister of agriculture, immigration, and statistics in the Conservative government which was formed in 1863. He retained that office in the &quot;Great Coalition&quot;, and was a Canadian delegate to the Charlottetown and Quebec conferences of 1864. At Quebec, McGee introduced the resolution which called for a guarantee of the educational rights of religious minorities in the two Canadas.

===Fenians===
Moderating his radical Irish nationalist views, McGee denounced the Fenian Brotherhood in America that advocated a forcible takeover of Canada from Britain by the United States.
Following the Confederation of Canada, McGee was elected to the 1st Canadian Parliament in 1867 as a Liberal-Conservative representing the riding of Montreal West. However, he had lost much of his Irish Catholic support.

On 5 November 1867 McGee delivered an oration titled &quot;The Mental Outfit of the New Dominion.&quot; The address surveyed the literary status of Canada on the eve of the first Dominion Parliament. McGee&#x27;s views were a combination of Tory principle, revelation, and empirical method. He suggested a national literature inspired by the creativity and ingenuity of the Canadian people.

==Assassination==
On 7 April 1868, McGee participated in a parliamentary debate that went on past midnight. After finishing, he walked back to the boarding house where he was staying. McGee was opening the door to Mrs. Trotter&#x27;s Boarding House in Ottawa when he was shot in the head by someone waiting for him on the inside. Several people came running to the scene; however, there was no sign of the assassin. It was later determined that McGee was assassinated with a shot from a handgun by Patrick J. Whelan.

McGee was given a state funeral in Ottawa known to be one of the largest funerals in Canadian history. He was interred in a crypt at the Cimetière Notre-Dame-des-Neiges in Montreal. His funeral procession in Montreal drew an estimated crowd of 80,000, out of a total city population of 105,000.

Patrick J. Whelan, a Fenian sympathiser and a Catholic, was accused, tried, convicted, and hanged for the crime on 11 February 1869 in Ottawa. The jury was decisively swayed by the forensic evidence that Whelan&#x27;s gun had been fired shortly before the killing, together with the circumstantial evidence that he had threatened and stalked McGee. Historian David Wilson points out that forensic tests conducted in 1972 show that the fatal bullet was compatible with both the gun and the bullets that Whelan owned. Wilson concludes:
:The balance of probabilities suggests that Whelan either shot McGee, or was part of a hit-squad, but there is still room for reasonable doubt as to whether he was the man who actually pulled the trigger.

Conspiracy theorists questioned his guilt, suggesting that he was a scapegoat for a Protestant plot.

The government of Canada&#x27;s Thomas D&#x27;Arcy McGee Building stands near the site of the assassination.

The case is dramatised in the Canadian play &quot;Blood on the Moon&quot; by Ottawa actor/playwright Pierre Brault. Patrick J. Whelan was hanged in front of an audience of 5,000 people. The assassination of McGee is also a major component of &quot;Away,&quot; a novel about Irish immigration to Canada by Canadian novelist Jane Urquhart. 

==Impact of the assassination==
P. M. Toner argues that the assassination was an important historical marker in Irish-Canadian history. He argues that the Fenian element among the Canadian Catholic Irish was powerful in the 1860s. The reasons for Fenian influence included McGee&#x27;s failure to rally moderate Irish support before his death, and the fact that no convincing moderate leader replaced McGee after his death.

In addition the Catholic bishops proved unable to control the Fenians in either the US or Canada. A final factor explaining the influence of the Fenians was the courting of the Irish Catholic vote by Canadian non-Catholic politicians. Behind all these reasons was Canadian fear of the &#x27;Green Ghost&#x27;: American Fenianism. After 1870, the failure of American Fenian raids into Canada, followed by the collapse of American Fenianism, led to the decline of Canadian Fenian power.

==Honours==
A monument to McGee stands at Tremone Bay, in north County Donegal, Ireland near the bay from which he escaped to North America in 1848. There is a monument to him in his native Carlingford, County Louth, unveiled during a visit in 1991 by then Prime Minister of Canada Brian Mulroney and Irish Taoiseach Charles Haughey. His parents&#x27; grave in the grounds of Wexford&#x27;s historic Selskar Abbey is marked by a plaque presented by the government of Canada.

On 20–22 August 2012, the inaugural Thomas D&#x27;Arcy McGee Summer School was held in Carlingford, County Louth, Ireland to commemorate and celebrate his legacy.

On Sparks Street, in downtown Ottawa, the Thomas D&#x27;Arcy McGee Building is a prominent government-owned office building. D&#x27;Arcy McGee&#x27;s Pub stands on the corner of Sparks and Elgin streets.

McGee also has several schools named in his honour including:
* D&#x27;Arcy McGee Catholic School (elementary, Toronto Catholic District School Board, Toronto, Ontario);
*Thomas D&#x27;Arcy McGee Catholic School (elementary, Ottawa-Carleton Catholic School Board, Ottawa, Ontario);
* D&#x27;Arcy McGee High School, Western Quebec School Board (Aylmer, Quebec);
* Thomas D&#x27;Arcy McGee Catholic High School in Montreal (closed in 1992).

The Quebec provincial electoral district (riding) of D&#x27;Arcy-McGee is named in his honour, as well as two villages in central Saskatchewan: D&#x27;Arcy and McGee, located approximately 20 kilometres apart.

In 1986, a Chair of Irish Studies was set up in his honour at Saint Mary&#x27;s University, Halifax.
In 2005, the gun that was used to assassinate McGee was purchased at auction for $105,000 by the Canadian Museum of Civilization.

<doc id="141390" wikidata="Q358519" url="?curid=141390" title="Gordie Howe">
<text>Gordon Howe (March 31, 1928 – June 10, 2016) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. From 1946 to 1980, he played 26 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) and six seasons in the World Hockey Association (WHA); his first 25 seasons were spent with the Detroit Red Wings. Nicknamed &quot;Mr. Hockey&quot;, Howe is often considered the most complete player ever to play the game and one of the greatest of all time. At his retirement, his 801 goals, 1,049 assists, and 1,850 total points were all NHL records that stood until they were broken by Wayne Gretzky, who himself has been a major champion of Howe&#x27;s legacy. A 23-time NHL All-Star, he shares the NHL record for seasons played with Chris Chelios, and his all-time NHL games played record of 1,767 was only surpassed in 2021 by Patrick Marleau. In 2017, Howe was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest NHL Players&quot;.

Howe made his NHL debut with the Red Wings in 1946. He won the Art Ross Trophy for leading the league in points each year from 1950–51 to 1953–54, then again in 1956–57 and 1962–63, for a total of six times, which is the second most in NHL history. He led the NHL in goal-scoring four times. He ranked among the top ten in the NHL scoring for 21 consecutive years. He set an NHL record for points in a season (95) in 1953, a record that was broken six years later. He won the Stanley Cup with the Red Wings four times and won six Hart Trophies as the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player. He also led the NHL in playoff points six times.

Howe retired for the first time in 1971 and was immediately inducted into the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame that same year. He was then inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame the following year but came back two years later to join his sons Mark and Marty on the Houston Aeros of the WHA. Although in his mid-40s, he scored over 100 points twice in six years, won two straight Avco World Trophies (1974 and 1975), and was named most valuable player in 1974. He made a brief return to the NHL in 1979–80, playing one season with the Hartford Whalers, then retired at age 52. His involvement with the WHA was central to their brief pre-NHL merger success, forcing the NHL to recruit European talent and expand to new markets.

Howe was most famous for his scoring prowess, physical strength, and career longevity, and he redefined the ideal qualities of a forward. He is the only player to have competed in the NHL in five different decades (1940s through 1980s); he also played a shift in a 1997 game for the Detroit Vipers of the IHL, playing professional hockey for a sixth decade. He became the namesake of the &quot;Gordie Howe hat trick&quot;: a goal, an assist, and a fight in the same game, though he only recorded two such games in his career. He was the inaugural recipient of the NHL Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008.

==Early life==
Howe was born in a farmhouse in Floral, Saskatchewan, the son of Katherine (Schultz) and Albert Howe. He was one of nine siblings. When Gordie was nine days old, the Howes moved to Saskatoon, where his father worked as a labourer during the Depression. In the summers, Howe would work construction with his father. Howe was mildly dyslexic growing up but was physically beyond his years at an early age. Already six feet tall in his mid-teens, doctors feared a calcium deficiency and encouraged him to strengthen his spine with chin-ups. He began playing organized hockey at age eight. Howe quit school during the Depression to work in construction, then left Saskatoon at 16 to pursue his hockey career.

==Playing careers==
Howe was an ambidextrous player, one of just a few skaters able to use the straight sticks of his era to shoot either left- or right-handed. As a young teen, he played bantam hockey with the King George Athletic Club in Saskatoon, winning his first championship with them in the 1942 Saskatchewan Provincial Bantam Hockey Finals. He received his first taste of professional hockey at age 15 in 1943 when he was invited by the New York Rangers to their training camp held at &quot;The Amphitheatre&quot; in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He played well enough there that the Rangers wanted Howe to sign a &quot;C&quot; form, which would have given that club his National Hockey League rights, and to play that year at the College of Notre Dame, a Catholic high school in Wilcox, Saskatchewan, that was known for producing good hockey players. However, Howe did not feel that was a good fit for him and wanted to go back home to play hockey with his friends; he declined the Rangers&#x27; offer and returned to Saskatoon.

In 1944, Howe was noticed by Detroit Red Wings scout Fred Pinkney and was invited to their camp in Windsor, Ontario. He was signed by the Red Wings to a &quot;C&quot; form and assigned to their junior team, the Galt Red Wings. Due to the maximum number of Western players allowed by the league and the Red Wings&#x27; preference to develop older players, Howe&#x27;s playing time with the team was initially limited. However, in 1945, he was promoted to the Omaha Knights of the minor professional United States Hockey League (USHL), where he scored 48 points in 51 games as a 17-year-old. While playing in Omaha, Frank Selke of the Toronto Maple Leafs noticed Howe&#x27;s rights needed to be properly listed as Red Wings property. Having a good relationship with Detroit head coach Jack Adams, he notified Adams of the clerical error, and Howe was quickly put on the team&#x27;s protected list.

===Detroit Red Wings===
Howe made his NHL debut on October 16, 1946, playing right wing for the Detroit Red Wings, scoring in his first game at age 18. He wore number 17 as a rookie. However, when Roy Conacher joined the Chicago Black Hawks after the 1946–47 season, Howe was offered Conacher&#x27;s number 9, which he would wear for the rest of his career. Although he had not requested the change, Howe accepted it when he was informed &quot;9&quot; would entitle him to a lower Pullman berth on road trips. He quickly established himself as a great goalscorer and a gifted playmaker with a willingness to fight. Howe fought so often in his rookie season that head coach Jack Adams told him, &quot;I know you can fight. Now can you show me you can play hockey?&quot; The term &quot;Gordie Howe hat trick&quot; (consisting of a goal, an assist, and a fight) was coined in reference to his penchant for fighting; however, Howe himself only recorded two such hat tricks in his career, on October 10, 1953, and March 21, 1954. Using his great physical strength, he was able to dominate the opposition in a career that spanned six decades (including one game with the Detroit Vipers of the IHL in 1997). In a feat unsurpassed by any hockey player, he finished in the top five in scoring for 20-straight seasons. Howe also scored 20 or more goals in 22 consecutive seasons between 1949 and 1971, an NHL record.

Howe led Detroit to four Stanley Cup championships and to first place in regular-season play for seven consecutive years (1948–49 to 1954–55), a feat never equalled in NHL history. During this time, Howe and his linemates—Sid Abel and Ted Lindsay—were known collectively as &quot;The Production Line&quot;, both for their scoring and as an allusion to Detroit auto factories. The trio dominated the NHL in such a fashion that in 1949–50, they finished one-two-three in NHL scoring. This was despite the fact Howe&#x27;s career prime was during a defensive era, when scoring was difficult and checking was tight.

However, as he was emerging as one of the top players in the league, Howe sustained the worst injury of his career - his skull was fractured and his cheekbone and nose were broken after his attempt to check the Toronto Maple Leafs captain Ted Kennedy into the boards went awry during the 1950 playoffs. The severity of the fracture was such that he was taken to the hospital for emergency surgery in order to relieve the pressure on his brain. He missed the rest of the playoffs, but his dominant teammates were still able to win the Stanley Cup.

The next season, 1950–51, Howe came back, responding to his severe injuries by playing in every game, by leading the NHL in goals, assists, and total points (86), and by winning the scoring title by 20 points. This was the first year of a four-year period of dominance by Howe which the NHL had never seen before. He won four straight scoring titles and in two of the years (1950–51 and 1952–53) he led the NHL in both goals and assists, which has only been done by five other players in history (a total of 10 times aside from Howe). In three of those years, he led the NHL in goals. In 1952–53, Howe became the first NHL player to score 90 points, finishing the season with 95 points and a career-best 49 goals which just missed tying the league record of 50 goals held by Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard (albeit in a 50-game season). Prior to Howe, no NHLer had led the NHL in points more than two times in a row. Only three other players have ever matched the feat of winning four straight scoring titles since—Phil Esposito, Jaromír Jágr, and Wayne Gretzky (who won seven in a row).

As Howe emerged as one of the game&#x27;s superstars, he was frequently compared to the Montreal Canadiens&#x27; Maurice Richard. Both were right wingers who wore #9, were regular challengers for the league scoring title, and could also play roughly if needed. Their first NHL match-up was in 1946, where Richard hit Howe with a hard check and an elbow to the chin. Howe and Richard never got to fight due to Sid Abel intervening. Abel received a broken nose. Howe recalled &quot;They always thought there was bad blood because I hit [Richard] once coming across the line and he spun like a rocket and fell down. He wasn&#x27;t hurt that much and I started to laugh. But the laughter stopped when there were eight guys on me&quot;. Howe also had a rivalry with the Canadiens&#x27; centre Jean Béliveau, who wrote in his autobiography that &quot;trying to strong-arm Gordie off the puck in a corner was akin to wrestling with a telephone pole&quot;. The Red Wings and Canadiens faced off in four Stanley Cup Finals during the 1950s, and again in the 1966 final; Detroit prevailed in 1952, 1954 and 1955, but Montreal triumphed in 1956 and 1966.

The Red Wings also had a fierce rivalry with the Chicago Blackhawks who defeated them in the 1961 Stanley Cup Finals. Chicago&#x27;s Stan Mikita recalled one time as a rookie when he slashed Howe saying &quot;he was an old man who didn&#x27;t belong on the ice&quot;; later in the season Howe exacted revenge with a check that gave Mikita a concussion. Bobby Hull recalled the times he and Howe played against each other saying &#x27;I enjoyed every high-sticking minute of it&#x27;, describing Howe as &quot;strong as a bull and tougher than a night in jail&quot;. In the 1968 All-Star Game where Hull and Howe were teammates for the first time, Hull said &quot;it was nice finally having Gordie on my side. He was no fun playing against&quot;. Hull and Howe would also be rivals in the World Hockey Association (WHA), as members of the Winnipeg Jets and Houston Aeros, respectively, and would be reunited as teammates on the Hartford Whalers where they finished off their playing careers.

After being consistent contenders through the 1950s and early 1960s, the Red Wings began to slump in the late 1960s. When Howe turned 40 in 1967–68, the NHL expanded from 6 to 12 teams and the number of scoring opportunities grew as the game schedule increased. Howe played the 1968–69 season on a line with Alex Delvecchio and Frank Mahovlich. Mahovlich was a scorer, and Delvecchio was a gifted playmaker. The three were dubbed &quot;The Production Line 3&quot;, and at age 40, Howe scored 103 points, surpassing 100 points for the only time in his NHL career by scoring 44 goals and a career-high 59 assists.

Following his personal best 103-point season, conflict arose with the Red Wings after Howe discovered he was just the third-highest paid player on the team with a $45,000 salary. While team owner Bruce Norris increased Howe&#x27;s salary to $100,000, he blamed Howe&#x27;s wife, Colleen, for the demand. Howe remained with the club for two more seasons, but after 25 years, a chronic wrist problem forced him to retire after the 1970–71 season and he took a job in the Red Wings front office. At the beginning of 1972, he was offered the job as first head coach of the New York Islanders, but declined it.

By the end of his NHL career, Howe had won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player six times: 1952, 1953, 1957, 1958, 1960 and 1963—at that time the most of any player, and as of 2019 second only to Gretzky&#x27;s nine. He also finished second or third in the voting for the Hart a further six times. Howe was named to the NHL&#x27;s First All-Star Team 12 times and to the Second All-Star Team eight times.

Howe was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1971. His number 9 jersey was retired by the Red Wings on March 12, 1972.

===World Hockey Association===
One year later, Howe was offered a contract to play with the Houston Aeros of the newly formed World Hockey Association (WHA), which had also signed his sons Mark and Marty to contracts. Dissatisfied with not having any meaningful influence in the Red Wings&#x27; office, he underwent wrist surgery to make a return to hockey possible, and he led his new team to consecutive league championships in 1974 and 1975. In 1974, at age 46, Howe won the Gary L. Davidson Trophy, awarded to the WHA&#x27;s Most Valuable Player (the trophy was renamed the Gordie Howe Trophy the following year). Howe played with the Aeros until 1977, when he and his sons joined the New England Whalers. After Marty&#x27;s cheekbone was broken by Robbie Ftorek, in the next game Howe used his stick to cross-check Ftorek in the face. Writer Michael Farber recounted &quot;Mark told Gordie, &#x27;Dad, he&#x27;s [Robbie] my friend, he&#x27;s an old teammate on Team Canada, he has been a mentor to me,&#x27; But none of that mattered. Robbie had mussed up a Howe. Gordie Howe grew up on the prairie. He believed in prairie justice.&quot;

===1974 Summit Series===

Howe was named with sons Mark and Marty to the WHA version of Team Canada for an eight-game series against the Soviet Union. Playing on a line with son Mark and Ralph Backstrom, Howe contributed seven points in seven games at age 46. The Soviets won the series four wins to Canada&#x27;s one, and with three ties.

In the final season of the WHA, Howe had the opportunity to play with Wayne Gretzky in the 1979 WHA All-Star Game. The format of the game was a three-game series between the WHA All-Stars and Dynamo Moscow. The WHA All-Stars were coached by Jacques Demers, and Demers asked Howe if it was okay to put him on a line with Gretzky and his son Mark. In game one, the line scored seven points, as the WHA All-Stars won by a score of 4–2. In game two, Gretzky and Mark Howe each scored a goal and Gordie Howe picked up an assist as the WHA won 4–2. WHA also won Game Three to ensure a clean sweep.

===Hartford Whalers===
When the WHA folded in 1979, the renamed Hartford Whalers joined the NHL. While the Red Wings still held Howe&#x27;s NHL rights even though he had retired eight years earlier, the Whalers and Red Wings reached a gentleman&#x27;s agreement in which Detroit agreed not to reclaim him. Howe had experienced dizzy spells in the latter part of the 1978–79 WHA season, and underwent an &quot;extensive battery of tests&quot; before deciding to play the 1979–80 NHL season. Howe played one final season, appearing in all 80 games of the schedule and helping his team to make the playoffs by scoring 41 points (15 goals and 26 assists). At 52 years and 10 days, Howe became the oldest man to play an NHL game where his Whalers lost 4–3 to the Canadiens. Late in the season, the Whalers signed Bobby Hull and put Howe, Hull and Dave Keon on the same line. One particular honour came when Wales Conference head coach Scotty Bowman selected Howe, Phil Esposito and Jean Ratelle to the mid-season All-Star Game—which was to take place in Detroit—as a nod to their storied careers before they retired. Howe had played in five decades of All-Star Games and he would skate alongside the second-youngest to ever play in an All-Star Game, 19-year-old Wayne Gretzky. The Joe Louis Arena crowd gave him a standing ovation twice, lasting so long he had to skate to the bench to stop people from cheering. He had one assist in the Wales Conference&#x27;s 6–3 win.

==Retirement==

Howe was named to Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1975. In 1998, &quot;The Hockey News&quot; released their List of Top 100 NHL Players of All Time and listed Howe third overall, behind Wayne Gretzky and Bobby Orr. Of the list, Gretzky and Orr were quoted as regarding Howe as the greatest player. In 2000, Howe was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

On April 10, 2007, Howe was honoured with the unveiling of a new bronze statue in Joe Louis Arena, where the West Entrance is named the &quot;Gordie Howe Entrance&quot; in his honour. The statue is tall and weighs about . The statue contains all of Howe&#x27;s stats and history. Another statue of Howe was erected in downtown Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, on the corner of 20th Street and 1st Ave. He is depicted wearing a Detroit Red Wings sweater. The statue has since been relocated to the SaskTel Centre.

In February 2011, various groups proposed naming the New International Trade Crossing bridge, a proposed bridge that will connect Detroit and Windsor by linking Highway 401 in Ontario with Interstate 75 and Interstate 94 in Michigan, in honour of Howe. On May 14, 2015, during an event attended by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, it was officially announced that the bridge would be known as the Gordie Howe International Bridge.

Canadian actor Michael Shanks portrayed Howe in the television film &quot;Mr. Hockey: The Gordie Howe Story&quot;. The film aired April 28, 2013, on CBC Television in Canada, and on the Hallmark Channel in the US on May 5.

After the death of his wife Colleen Howe in 2009, Howe turned his charitable activity towards degenerative diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer&#x27;s, and founded the Gordie and Colleen Howe Fund for Alzheimer&#x27;s, in partnership with the University of Toronto&#x27;s aging and brain health facility at Baycrest Health Sciences.

==Personal life and death==
Howe met his wife, Colleen, at a bowling alley when she was 17 years old, and they were married four years later on April 15, 1953. 
In the midst of his playing career, Howe appeared as himself on the March 27, 1967, episode of the CBS game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. He received two of four possible votes. Although hockey was not as popular as other sports in America in 1967, panellist Peggy Cass was a hockey fan and recognized Howe. She disqualified herself from voting.
A middle school in Abbotsford, British Columbia, is named after Gordie and Colleen Howe, and a traffic bridge, campground, and football stadium are named after Gordie Howe in his hometown of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. An arena is named for Gordie Howe in Traverse City, Michigan, where Howe lived from 1987 to 1999. Two of their sons, Marty and Mark, were his teammates on the WHA Houston Aeros and the New England (WHA)/Hartford (NHL) Whalers. Mark had a long NHL career, playing 16 seasons for the Hartford Whalers, the Philadelphia Flyers, and the Red Wings, and was one of the dominant two-way defencemen of the 1980s. He followed his father by being elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2011. Their third son, Murray, is a radiologist in Toledo, Ohio, while their only daughter, Cathy, lives in Lubbock, Texas.

Colleen Howe was one of the founders of the Detroit Junior Red Wings and represented both Gordie and Mark financially during their careers. She died in 2009 at age 76 after a long battle with Pick&#x27;s disease.

Howe&#x27;s younger brother, Vic Howe, also played in the NHL appearing in 33 games with the New York Rangers between 1950 and 1955. He died at the age of 85 in Moncton, New Brunswick, on January 31, 2015.

Due to dementia, Howe spent most of his time after his wife&#x27;s death residing with all four of his children on a rotating basis. While staying at his daughter&#x27;s home, he suffered a major stroke on October 26, 2014. He died on June 10, 2016, at his son Murray&#x27;s house in the Toledo suburb of Sylvania, Ohio, at the age of 88. No cause was given. Howe&#x27;s casket was brought to Joe Louis Arena, the then-home of the Detroit Red Wings, for a public visitation on June 14, 2016, that lasted from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. in honour of the #9 that Howe wore on his jersey. Wayne Gretzky, Scotty Bowman, and Detroit Tigers great Al Kaline acted as pallbearers. Howe&#x27;s funeral, which was also opened to the public, was held on June 15, 2016, at Detroit&#x27;s Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament. Howe&#x27;s cremated remains, along with those of his wife Colleen, were returned to Canada for the last time and interred in Saskatoon in September 2016, at the base of his statue outside of SaskTel Centre.

== Legacy ==

Howe&#x27;s name and nickname, &quot;Mr. Hockey&quot;, as well as his late wife&#x27;s nickname as &quot;Mrs. Hockey&quot;, are registered trademarks. Howe was also referred to during his career as Power, Mr. Everything, Mr. All-Star, The Most, The Great Gordie, The King of Hockey, The Legend, The Man, No. 9, and &quot;Mr. Elbows&quot; (for his tough physical play). Howe is widely considered the most complete player in all of hockey history. Once Howe began dominating the NHL, NHL scouts were given new directives to discover players that played the way he did. Howe&#x27;s strength, scoring ability, and speed exemplified the perfect example of the modern-day role of a power forward and someone who can play the 200-foot game. Howe&#x27;s brawn and physical play inspired the coining of the &quot;Gordie Howe hat-trick&quot;—a goal, an assist and a fight—which is now a standard part of hockey&#x27;s vocabulary. Ironically, Howe himself only achieved his namesake hat-trick twice in his long career, both in the early 1950s, because few players dared to fight him after Howe soundly defeated New York Rangers enforcer Lou Fontinato at Madison Square Garden in 1959. (For comparison, the current leader in Gordie Howe hat-tricks, Rick Tocchet, achieved the feat 18 times in his career.)

Howe was known for being a well-mannered and trusting person off the ice who never questioned the salary the Detroit Red Wings owners paid him. When it became public knowledge Howe had scored more than 600 goals for the organization before it reluctantly offered to pay him over $40,000, his linemate, Ted Lindsay, began a campaign to establish a player&#x27;s association to unite for fair wages against the NHL owners. This would be the nucleus of the movement that became the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association.

Howe&#x27;s time playing with the WHA with his sons allowed the fledgling professional league to gain much-needed legitimacy and the ability to fill stadiums. The increased competition for hockey talent forced the insular NHL to seek players beyond its traditional North American sources and recruit professional European players and to expand into new cities to gain new fans. Wayne Gretzky was one of the players who elected to join the WHA instead of the NHL. Over the years, Howe became good friends with Gretzky, who had idolized him as a young player and who would later break many of Howe&#x27;s scoring records and milestones. While Gretzky surpassed Howe statistically, it was Howe who had first set the standard for consistent, high-level play. Howe&#x27;s number 9 has been worn as a tribute to him—Gretzky wore number 99 as a direct tribute to Howe since 9 was taken during the early parts of his career.

Another milestone was reached in 1997 when Howe played professional hockey in a sixth decade. He was signed to a one-game contract by the Detroit Vipers of the International Hockey League and at age 69, made a return to the ice for one shift. In so doing, he became the only player in hockey history to compete in six different decades at the professional level, having played in the USHL, NHL, WHA and IHL from the 1940s to 1990s.

Howe&#x27;s first 20 seasons came during an era when the schedule was only 70 games, scoring was difficult, and checking was tight; he never scored 50 goals in a single season. Howe is currently fourth on the NHL&#x27;s all-time points list with 1850 total points (801 goals and 1,049 assists) after Wayne Gretzky, Mark Messier and Jaromír Jágr. Howe is still third on the all-time goals list, with only Gretzky and Alexander Ovechkin ahead of him. When career regular season goals from both the NHL and the WHA are combined, he ranks first in goals with 975, ahead of Gretzky&#x27;s 940.

At the time of his retirement, Howe&#x27;s professional totals, including playoffs, for the NHL and WHA combined, were first. He finished with 2,421 games played, 1,071 goals, 1,518 assists, and 2,589 points. However, Gretzky would later pass him in goals (1,072), assists (2,297) and points (3,369), but not in games played or games played with one team. After Howe&#x27;s death, Gretzky called Howe &quot;the greatest hockey player ever&quot;, and said that if it were up to him Howe&#x27;s No. 9 would be retired for all NHL teams the same as his own No. 99. Howe&#x27;s record of 1,767 NHL games played was surpassed in April 2021 by Patrick Marleau. However, combining his games played in the WHA, he holds the record for most regular season games played in the major leagues with 2,186. Howe played internationally on one occasion, at the 1974 Summit Series.

=== Popular culture ===
In the 1986 film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, the character Cameron Frye wears Howe&#x27;s Red Wings jersey throughout most of the film, even though it is set in Chicago. Howe had provided one to the filmmakers personally.

Howe was featured in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Bart the Lover&quot;. In it, a photograph of Howe is used by Bart Simpson to fool his teacher into thinking he is a grown man who has answered her personal ad. At the end of the episode, Howe&#x27;s career statistics are shown.

In Season 3 of the NBC television crime drama series &quot;Good Girls&quot;, in an episode entitled &quot;The Eye in Survivor&quot;, the character of Ruby (Retta) steals an autographed Stanley Cup Finals game-worn Gordie Howe jersey from a sports bar only to have it appraised and learn that it is counterfeit.

In 2023, a children&#x27;s book called &quot;Gordie&#x27;s Skate&quot;, written by Saskatchewan historian Bill Waiser, was published. The book shares the story of Howe&#x27;s family acquiring a pair of skates during the Great Depression in Saskatchewan, and how Howe had to share the pair with his sister.

=== Namesake ===
In 1993, a statue created by Michael Martin of Eston, Saskatchewan, was installed across from Midtown Plaza in Howe&#x27;s hometown of Saskatoon, and then moved to what is now SaskTel Centre in 2005. Following his death, Howe&#x27;s ashes along with wife Colleen were interred below the statue.

In May 2015, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Michigan Governor Rick Snyder announced that a new international bridge spanning the Detroit River would be named in honour of Howe. The Gordie Howe International Bridge is currently under construction, and is set to open in 2025.

On June 27, 2016, it was announced that a bridge in Saskatoon would be named after Howe. There is also an arena and sports complex in Saskatoon named after Howe.

<text>Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc., doing business as Esri (), is an American multinational geographic information system (GIS) software company headquartered in Redlands, California. It is best known for its ArcGIS products. With 40% market share as of 2011, Esri is one of the world&#x27;s leading supplier of GIS software, web GIS and geodatabase management applications.

Founded in 1969 as a land-use consulting firm, Esri currently has 49 offices worldwide including 11 research and development centers in the United States, Europe, the Middle East and Africa and Asia Pacific. There are 10 regional U.S. offices and over 3,000 partners globally, with users in every country and a total of over a million active users in 350,000 organizations. These include Fortune 500 companies, most national governments, 20,000 cities, all 50 US States and 7,000+ universities. The firm has 4,000 total employees, and is privately held by its founders. Strategic partners include Microsoft, Salesforce, Amazon Web Services, and SAP, among others. In a 2016 Investor&#x27;s Business Daily article, Esri&#x27;s annual revenues were indicated to be $1.1 billion.

== History ==
In 1969, Esri was founded by the couple, Jack and Laura Dangermond, as Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), in Redlands, California. Esri was established when the couple started working on the technology to integrate human development with environmental stewardship at Harvard University’s lab for computer graphics and spatial analysis in the early 1960s. Inspired by the early mapmaking software in development at the lab, Jack and Laura Dangermond conceptualized using computer-powered mapping and analysis for complex problem-solving.

The company released Arc/Info, the first commercial GIS program, containing maps attached to relational database. In the late 1990s, Esri reengineered Arc/Info and developed it into a modular and scalable GIS platform. Esri then switched from providing contract mapping services to developing mapping software products. The first ArcGIS software offering (8.1) was announced at the Esri International User Conference (Esri UC) in 2000. ArcGIS 8.1 was officially released on April 24, 2001.

== Products ==

Esri uses the name ArcGIS to refer to its suite of GIS software products, which operate on desktop, server, and mobile platforms. ArcGIS also includes developer products and web services. In a general sense, the term GIS describes any information system that integrates, stores, edits, analyzes, shares and displays geographic information for informing decision making. The term GIS-Centric, however, has been specifically defined as the use of the Esri ArcGIS geodatabase as the asset and feature data repository central to computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) as a part of enterprise asset management and analytical software systems. GIS-centric certification criteria have been specifically defined by NAGCS, the National Association of GIS-Centric Solutions.

=== Desktop GIS ===
As of October 2024, the company&#x27;s desktop GIS suite is ArcGIS Pro 3.3.2, with the older ArcGIS Desktop (or ArcMap) version 10.8.2 in mature support (to be fully retired in March of 2026). The older ArcGIS Desktop consisted of several integrated applications, including ArcMap, ArcCatalog, ArcToolbox, ArcScene, and ArcGlobe. Esri&#x27;s main desktop, or thick client, application is ArcGIS Pro which is slowly replacing the former main components of ArcGIS Desktop: ArcMap, ArcCatalog and ArcToolbox. Esri&#x27;s desktop products allow users to author, analyze, map, manage, share, and publish geographic information.

ArcGIS Pro was introduced in early 2015 as a modern and fully 64-bit application with integrated 2D and 3D functionality. The product suite is available in three levels of licensing: Basic (formerly called ArcView), Standard (formerly called ArcEditor) and Advanced (formerly called ArcInfo). Basic provides a basic set of GIS capabilities suitable for many GIS applications. Standard, at added cost, allows more extensive data editing and manipulation, including server geodatabase editing. Advanced, at the high end, provides full, advanced analysis and data management capabilities, including geostatistical and topological analysis tools. Additionally, ArcGIS is compatible with following OGC standards: WFS, WCS, GFS and various others.

ArcGIS Explorer, ArcReader, and ArcExplorer are basic freeware applications for viewing GIS data.

ArcGIS Desktop extensions are available, including Spatial Analyst for raster analysis, and 3D Analyst for terrain mapping and analysis. Other more specialized extensions are available from Esri and third parties.

Esri&#x27;s original product, ARC/INFO, was a command line GIS product available initially on minicomputers, then on UNIX workstations. In 1992, a GUI GIS, ArcView GIS, was introduced. Over time, both products were offered in Windows versions, and ArcView also as a Macintosh product. The names ArcView and ArcInfo were used for a while to name different levels of licensing in ArcGIS Desktop, and less often refer to these original software products. The Windows version of ArcGIS is now the only ArcGIS Desktop platform that is undergoing new development for future product releases.

=== Server GIS ===
Server GIS products provide GIS functionality and data deployed from a central environment. ArcGIS Server is an Internet application service, used to extend the functionality of ArcGIS Desktop software to a browser based environment. It is available on Solaris and Linux as well as Windows. ArcSDE (Spatial Database Engine) is used as a relational database connector for other Esri software to store and retrieve GIS data within a commercially available database: currently, it can be used with Oracle, PostgreSQL, DB2, Informix and Microsoft SQL Server databases. It supports its native SDE binary data format, Oracle Spatial, and ST_geometry.
ArcIMS (Internet Mapping Server) provides browser-based access to GIS. As of ArcGIS 10.1, ArcIMS has been deprecated in favor of ArcGIS Server, but there are still many instances of ArcIMS (10.0 and older) in production environments.
Other server-based products include Geoportal Server, ArcGIS Image Server and Tracking Server as well as several others.

=== Mobile GIS ===
Mobile GIS conflates GIS, GPS, location-based services, hand-held computing, and the growing availability of geographic data. ArcGIS technology can be deployed on a range of mobile systems from lightweight devices to PDAs, laptops, and Tablet PCs. The firm&#x27;s products for this use include Collector for ArcGIS, Survey123 for ArcGIS, ArcGIS QuickCapture and more. Former products and applications in this category included ArcPad and ArcGIS for Mobile.

===Online GIS (ArcGIS Online)===
ArcGIS includes Internet capabilities in all Esri software products. The services, provided through ArcGIS Online at www.arcgis.com, include web APIs, hosted map and geoprocessing services, and a user sharing program. A variety of basemaps is a signature feature of ArcGIS Online. The Esri Community Maps program compiles detailed user basemap information into a common cartographic format called Topographic Basemap.

==Data formats==

===Vector===
* Shapefile – Esri&#x27;s proprietary, hybrid vector data format using SHP, SHX and DBF files. Originally invented in the early 1990s, it is still commonly used as a widely supported interchange format.
* Enterprise Geodatabase – Esri&#x27;s geodatabase format for use in an relational database system.
* File Geodatabase – Esri&#x27;s file-based geodatabase format, stored as folders in a file system.
* Personal Geodatabase – Esri&#x27;s closed, integrated vector data storage strategy using Microsoft&#x27;s Access MDB format is a legacy format generally replaced by the file geodatabase in most contemporary use.
* Coverage – Esri&#x27;s closed, hybrid vector data storage strategy. Legacy ArcGIS Workstation / ArcInfo format with reduced support in modern application.

=== Raster ===
* Esri grid – binary and metadataless ASCII raster formats.
* Mosaic - data structure for managing and analyzing multidimensional raster and imagery data, including netCDF, GRIB, and Hierarchical Data Format

== Esri Technical Certification ==
The Esri Technical Certification program was launched in January 2011. The program provides an exam based certification for Esri software. The core groups for the certification include Desktop, Developer, and Enterprise. Each subcategory under these groups have two certification levels, Associate and Professional.

== Conference ==
The company hosts the Esri International User Conference, which was first held on the Redlands campus in 1981 with 16 attendees. The 44th User Conference was held in San Diego at the San Diego Convention Center from July 15th - 19th, 2024. In 2022, 31,590 users from 142 countries attended either in person or digitally.

== Philanthropy ==
Esri provides low-cost access to ArcGIS software via special programs. The company has provided free access to ArcGIS Online to over 100,000 K-12 schools in the U.S. as part of Barack Obama’s ConnectED initiative.

== Conservation and sustainability ==
In 1989, Esri created the Esri Conservation Program to assist in changing the operations of non-profit organizations for their objectives of nature conservation and social change. Esri’s ArcGIS platform has provided GIS data, analytics software, and training to thousands of non-profit organizations and individual conservation projects since 1993.

In 2017, Esri began a partnership with the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) to create a data hub, Federated Systems, based on Esri&#x27;s ArcGIS platform. The data hub will allow countries to measure, monitor, and report on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in a geographic context.

In 2019, Esri partnered with the Jane Goodall Institute to develop tools to help communities map and manage their surrounding ecosystems using GIS software. In 2022, they partnered again to publish a book “Local Voices, Local Choices,” to describe the success of the Tacare approach to community-led conservation.

<text>Damage is a 1991 novel by Josephine Hart about a British politician who, in the prime of life, causes his own downfall through an inappropriate relationship. It was adapted into a film of the same title by Louis Malle in 1992, starring Jeremy Irons and Juliette Binoche, as well as into an opera, called &quot;Damage, an Opera in Seven Meals&quot;, by Greek composer Kharálampos Goyós which premiered as part of the Athens Festival in 2008. A second screen adaptation has been released in April 2023 as a four-part limited series for Netflix, under the title &quot;Obsession&quot;.

==Plot summary==

The first-person narrator of the novel is an unnamed medical doctor turned politician (called Dr Stephen Fleming in the Louis Malle film) whose promotion from Member of Parliament (MP) to cabinet member is imminent. Just then the MP is casually introduced to his grown-up son&#x27;s enigmatic girlfriend Anna and helplessly falls for her. For as long as it lasts, Martyn, his son, has no idea that his father is having an extramarital affair with his girlfriend (and later fiancée), and Anna does not seem to mind being a young man&#x27;s partner and simultaneously his father&#x27;s lover and object of desire. The MP enjoys a brief period of sexual bliss, meeting Anna in various European cities and having sex with her in unlikely places. Eventually, he buys them a small flat in central London where they meet on a regular basis.

On the day before his wedding to Anna, her stepfather, whom she is close to, has a heart attack, and Martyn while looking for her, finds the address to her secret flat. He climbs up a flight of stairs to the top floor, opens the unlocked door to the apartment, and is shocked to see his father making love to his fiancée. Dazed and utterly confused, he tumbles backward, hits the low banister and falls down the stairwell. The MP runs down the stairs completely naked, finding Martyn dead, sprawled out on the ground floor. He kneels on the floor and clutches Martyn&#x27;s body to him until the police arrive. In the final scene, the MP, stripped of his political office and living abroad as a recluse, sits in his solitary room staring at oversized photographs of Anna and Martyn on the wall.

==Reception==
The novel had received a positive reception. In a review for &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;, it was said that &quot;this spare, dreamlike first novel comes festooned with blurbs from the likes of Ruth Rendell and Iris Murdoch, and no wonder, for it&#x27;s an unforgettable tale of sexual obsession and its calamitous consequences&quot;, while being described as &quot;Elliptical, haunting, and altogether extraordinary.&quot;

<doc id="141480" wikidata="Q673175" url="?curid=141480" title="French Wars of Religion">
<text>The French Wars of Religion were a series of civil wars between French Catholics and Protestants (called Huguenots) from 1562 to 1598. Between two and four million people died from violence, famine or disease directly caused by the conflict, and it severely damaged the power of the French monarchy. One of its most notorious episodes was the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre in 1572. The fighting ended with a compromise in 1598, when Henry of Navarre, who had converted to Catholicism in 1593, was proclaimed King Henry IV of France and issued the Edict of Nantes, which granted substantial rights and freedoms to the Huguenots. However, Catholics continued to disapprove of Protestants and of Henry, and his assassination in 1610 triggered a fresh round of Huguenot rebellions in the 1620s.

Tensions between the two religions had been building since the 1530s, exacerbating existing regional divisions. The death of Henry II of France in July 1559 initiated a prolonged struggle for power between his widow Catherine de&#x27; Medici and powerful nobles. These included a fervently Catholic faction led by the Guise and Montmorency families, and Protestants headed by the House of Condé and Jeanne d&#x27;Albret. Both sides received assistance from external powers, with Spain and Savoy supporting the Catholics, and England and the Dutch Republic backing the Protestants.

Moderates, also known as Politiques, hoped to maintain order by centralising power and making concessions to Huguenots, rather than the policies of repression pursued by Henry II and his father Francis I. They were initially supported by Catherine de&#x27; Medici, whose January 1562 Edict of Saint-Germain was strongly opposed by the Guise faction and led to an outbreak of widespread fighting in March. She later hardened her stance and backed the 1572 St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre in Paris, which resulted in Catholic mobs killing between 5,000 and 30,000 Protestants throughout France.

The wars threatened the authority of the monarchy and the last Valois kings, Catherine&#x27;s three sons Francis II, Charles IX, and Henry III. Their Bourbon successor Henry IV responded by creating a strong central state and extending toleration to Huguenots; the latter policy would last until 1685, when Henry&#x27;s grandson Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes.

== Name and periodisation ==
Along with &quot;French Wars of Religion&quot; and &quot;Huguenot Wars&quot;, the wars have also been variously described as the &quot;Eight Wars of Religion&quot;, or simply the &quot;Wars of Religion&quot; (only within France).

The exact number of wars and their respective dates are subject to continued debate by historians: some assert that the Edict of Nantes (13 April 1598) and the Peace of Vervins (2 May 1598) concluded the wars, while the ensuing 1620s Huguenot rebellions lead others to believe the Peace of Alès in 1629 is the actual conclusion. However, the agreed upon beginning of the wars is the Massacre of Wassy in 1562, and the Edict of Nantes at least ended this series of conflicts. During this time, complex diplomatic negotiations and agreements of peace were followed by renewed conflict and power struggles.

American military historians Kiser, Drass &amp; Brustein (1994) maintained the following divisions, periodisations and locations:
* Massacre of Vassy (1562) – Western France
* First War of Religion (1562–63) – Western and Southwestern France
* Second War of Religion (1567–68) – Western and Southwestern France
* Third War of Religion (1568–70) – Western and Southwestern France
* St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre (1572) – Northeastern France
* Fourth War of Religion (1572–73) – Western and Southwestern France
* Fifth War of Religion (1575–76) – Western and Southwestern France
* Sixth War of Religion (1576–77) – Western and Southwestern France
* Seventh War of Religion (1580) – Western and Southwestern France
* Eighth War of Religion (1585–89) – Western and Southwestern France
* Ninth War of Religion (1589–98) – Western and Southwestern France

Both Kohn (2013) and Clodfelter (2017) followed the same counting and periodisation and noted that &quot;War of the Three Henrys&quot; was another name for the Eighth War of Religion, with Kohn adding &quot;Lovers&#x27; War&quot; as another name for the Seventh War. In her Michel de Montaigne biography (2014), Elizabeth Guild concurred with this chronology as well, except for dating the Seventh War of Religion to 1579–1580 rather than just 1580. Holt (2005) asserted a rather different periodisation from 1562 to 1629, writing of &#x27;civil wars&#x27; rather than wars of religion, dating the Sixth War to March–September 1577, and dating the Eight War from June 1584 (death of Anjou) to April 1598 (Edict of Nantes); finally, although he didn&#x27;t put a number on it, Holt regarded the 1610–1629 period as &#x27;the last war of religion&#x27;.

== Background ==
=== Introduction of Reformation ideas ===
Renaissance humanism began during the 14th century in Italy and arrived in France in the early 16th, coinciding with the rise of Protestantism in France. The movement emphasised the importance of &quot;ad fontes&quot;, or study of original sources, and initially focused on the reconstruction of secular Greek and Latin texts. It later expanded into the reading, study and translation of works by the Church Fathers and the New Testament, with a view to religious renewal and reform. Humanist scholars argued interpretation of the Bible required an ability to read the New Testament and Old Testaments in the original Greek and Hebrew, rather than relying on the 4th century Latin translation known as the &quot;Vulgate Bible&quot;.

In 1495, the Venetian Aldus Manutius began using the newly invented printing press to produce small, inexpensive, pocket editions of Greek, Latin, and vernacular literature, making knowledge in all disciplines available for the first time to a wide audience. Cheap pamphlets and broadsides allowed theological and religious ideas to be disseminated at an unprecedented pace. In 1519, John Froben published a collection of works by Martin Luther and noted in his correspondence that 600 copies were being shipped to France and Spain and sold in Paris.

In 1521, a group of reformers including Jacques Lefèvre and Guillaume Briçonnet, recently appointed bishop of Meaux, formed the Circle of Meaux, aiming to improve the quality of preaching and religious life in general. They were joined by François Vatable, an expert in Hebrew, along with Guillaume Budé, a classicist and Royal librarian. Lefèvre&#x27;s &quot;Fivefold Psalter&quot; and his commentary on the Epistle to the Romans emphasised the literal interpretation of the Bible and the centrality of Jesus Christ. Many of the tenets behind Lutheranism first appeared in Luther&#x27;s lectures, which in turn contained many of the ideas expressed in the works of Lefèvre.

Other members of the Circle included Marguerite de Navarre, sister of Francis I and mother of Jeanne d&#x27;Albret, as well as Guillaume Farel, who was exiled to Geneva in 1530 due to his reformist views and persuaded John Calvin to join him there. Both men were banished from Geneva in 1538 for opposing what they viewed as government interference with religious affairs; although the two fell out over the nature of the Eucharist, Calvin&#x27;s return to Geneva in 1541 allowed him to forge the doctrine of Calvinism.

A key driver behind the Reform movement was corruption among the clergy which Luther and others attacked and sought to change. Such criticisms were not new but the printing press allowed them to be widely shared, such as the &quot;Heptaméron&quot; by Marguerite, a collection of stories about clerical immorality. Another complaint was the reduction of Salvation to a business scheme based on the sale of Indulgences, which added to general unrest and increased the popularity of works such as Farel&#x27;s translation of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, &quot;The True and Perfect Prayer&quot;. This focused on &quot;Sola fide&quot;, or the idea salvation was a free gift from God, emphasised the importance of understanding in prayer and criticised the clergy for hampering the growth of true faith.

=== Growth of Calvinism ===

The Italian revival of classical learning appealed to Francis I (1494-1547), who set up royal professorships in Paris to better understand ancient literature. However, this did not extend to religion, especially after the 1516 Concordat of Bologna when Pope Leo X increased royal control of the Gallican church, allowing Francis to nominate French clergy and levy taxes on church property. Unlike Germany, the French nobility also generally supported the status quo and existing policies.

Despite his personal opposition, Francis tolerated Martin Luther’s ideas when they entered France in the late 1520s, largely because the definition of Catholic orthodoxy was unclear, making it hard to determine precisely what was or was not heresy. He tried to steer a middle course in the developing religious schism, but in January 1535, Catholic authorities made a definitive ruling by classifying &quot;Lutherans&quot; as heretical Zwinglians. Calvin, originally from Noyon in Picardy, went into exile in 1535 to escape persecution and settled in Basel, where he published the &quot;Institutes of the Christian Religion&quot; in 1538. This work contained the key principles of Calvinism, which became immensely popular in France and other European countries.

Lutheranism was widespread within the French commercial class; it flourished in the cities but was not adopted among the peasantry. However, it cut across social class and strata and encompassed the entire country. Its rapid growth was driven by the nobility, where being a Huguenot became fashionable. It is believed to have started when Condé passed through Geneva while returning home from a military campaign and heard a Calvinist sermon. Jeanne d&#x27;Albret, Queen of Navarre, converted to Calvinism in 1560, possibly due to the influence of Theodore de Beze. Along with Condé and her husband Antoine of Navarre, she and their son Henry of Navarre became Huguenot leaders.

===Rise in factionalism===

The crown continued efforts to remain neutral in the religious debate until the Affair of the Placards in October 1534, when Protestant radicals put up posters in Paris and other provincial towns that rejected the Catholic doctrine of the &quot;Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist&quot;. This allowed Protestantism to be clearly defined as heresy, while Francis was furious at the breach of security which had allowed one of the posters to be placed on the door of his bedchamber. Having been severely criticised for his initial tolerance, he was now encouraged to punish those responsible. On 21 February 1535, a number of those implicated in the Affair were executed in front of Notre-Dame de Paris, an event attended by Francis and members of the Ottoman embassy to France.

The fight against heresy intensified in the 1540s, forcing Protestants to worship in secret. In October 1545, Francis ordered the punishment of Waldensians based in the south-eastern village of Mérindol. A long-standing Proto-Protestantism tradition dating back to the 13th century, the Waldensians had recently affiliated with the Reformed church and became increasingly militant in their activities. In what became known as the Massacre of Mérindol, Provençal troops killed numerous residents and destroyed another 22 to 28 nearby villages, while hundreds of men were forced to become Galley slaves.

Francis I died on 31 March 1547 and was succeeded by his son Henry II, who continued the religious repression pursued by his father in the last years of his reign. His policies were even more severe since he sincerely believed all Protestants were heretics; on 27 June 1551, the Edict of Châteaubriant sharply curtailed their right to worship. Prohibitions were placed upon the distribution of &#x27;heretical&#x27; literature, with the property of &#x27;heretics&#x27; seizable by the crown.

From his base in Geneva, Calvin provided leadership and organisational structures for the Reformed Church of France. Calvinism proved attractive to people from across the social hierarchy and occupational divides and was highly regionalised, with no coherent pattern of geographical spread. Despite persecution, their numbers and power increased markedly, driven by the conversion to Calvinism of large sections of the nobility. Historians estimate that by the outbreak of war in 1562, there were around two million French Calvinists, including more than half of the nobility, backed by 1,200–1,250 churches. This constituted a substantial threat to the monarchy.

===Amboise conspiracy===

In 1559, the Italian wars between France and Spain ended with the treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis. These wars had nearly bankrupted both countries. Additionally, the death of Henry II in July 1559 created a political vacuum and an internal struggle for power between rival factions, which the 15-year-old Francis II lacked the ability to control. Francis, Duke of Guise, whose niece Mary, Queen of Scots, was married to the king, exploited the situation to establish dominance over their rivals, the House of Montmorency. Within days of the King&#x27;s accession, the English ambassador reported &quot;the house of Guise ruleth and doth all about the French King&quot;.

On 10 March 1560, a group of disaffected nobles led by Jean du Barry, attempted to break the power of the Guise by abducting the young king. Their plans were discovered before being carried out and hundreds of suspected plotters executed, including du Barry. The Guise suspected Condé of involvement in the plot, and he was arrested and sentenced to death before being freed in the political chaos that followed the sudden death of Francis II, adding to the tensions of the period.

In the aftermath of the plot, the term &quot;Huguenot&quot; for France&#x27;s Protestants came into widespread usage. Shortly afterwards, the first instances of Protestant iconoclasm or the destruction of images and statues in Catholic churches, occurred in Rouen and La Rochelle. This continued throughout 1561 in more than 20 cities and towns, sparking attacks on Protestants by Catholic mobs in Sens, Cahors, Carcassonne, Tours and elsewhere.

===Regency of Catherine de&#x27; Medici===
When Francis II died on 5 December 1560, his mother Catherine de&#x27; Medici became regent for her second son, the nine year old Charles IX. With the state financially exhausted by the Italian Wars, Catherine had to preserve the independence of the monarchy from a range of competing factions led by powerful nobles, each of whom controlled what were essentially private armies. To offset the Guise or &quot;Guisard&quot;, she agreed a deal in which Antoine of Navarre renounced any claim to the regency in return for Condé&#x27;s release and the position of Lieutenant-General of France.

Catherine had several options for dealing with &quot;heresy&quot;, including continuing Henry&#x27;s II&#x27;s failed policy of eradication, an approach backed by Catholic ultras such as François de Tournon, or converting the monarchy to Calvinism, as preferred by de Bèze. A middle path between these two extremes was allowing both religions to be openly practised in France at least temporarily, or the Guisard compromise of scaling back persecution but not permitting toleration. For the moment she held to the Guisard line.

Before his death, Francis II had called the first Estates General held since 1484, which in December 1560 assembled in Orléans to discuss topics which included taxation and religion. It made little progress on the latter, other than agreeing to pardon those convicted of religious offences in the prior year. Since this was clearly unacceptable to Condé and his followers, Catherine bypassed the Estates and enacted conciliatory measures such as the Edict of 19 April 1561 and the Edict of July. This recognised Catholicism as the state religion but confirmed previous measures reducing penalties for &quot;heresy&quot;.

The Estates then approved the Colloquy of Poissy, which began its session on 8 September 1561, with the Protestants led by de Bèze and the Catholics by Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine, brother of the Duke of Guise. The two sides initially sought to accommodate Protestant forms of worship within the existing church but this proved impossible. By the time the Colloquy ended on 8 October, it was clear the divide between Catholic and Protestant theology was too wide to be bridged. With their options narrowing, the government attempted to quell escalating disorder in the provinces by passing the Edict of Saint-Germain, which allowed Protestants to worship in public outside towns and in private inside them. On 1 March, Guise family retainers attacked a Calvinist service in Champagne, leading to what became known as the massacre of Vassy. This seemed to confirm Huguenot fears that the Guisards had no intention of compromising and is generally seen as the spark which led to open hostilities between the two religions.

===Turn to violence===
Guyenne was the epicentre of the turn to religious violence in late 16th-century France. Many explanations have been proffered for the rise of violence. Traditional explanations focus on the influence of Jeanne d&#x27;Albret and Antoine of Navarre. Other explanations focus on the rise of seigneurialism in the 1550s and see the turn to violence as a response of the peasant class. The murder of the baron of by a Protestant mob in 1561 is often cited as an example. Recent analyses, on the other hand, have turned the focus on religious explanations. Denis Crouzet fingers the fiery eschatological preaching of the Franciscan Thomas Illyricus, who toured the region in the 1510s and 1520s. Stuart Carroll, however, argues for politicisation: &quot;the violence was directly caused by politicized factions and was not the result of a spontaneous intercommunal eruption.&quot;

== 1562–1570 ==

=== &quot;First&quot; war (1562–1563) ===

Although the Huguenots had begun mobilising for war before the Vassy massacre, many claimed that the massacre confirmed claims that they could not rely on the Edict of Saint Germain. In response, a group of nobles led by Condé proclaimed their intention of &quot;liberating&quot; the king from &quot;evil&quot; councillors and seized Orléans on 2 April 1562. This example was quickly followed by Protestant groups around France, who seized and garrisoned Angers, Blois and Tours along the Loire and assaulted Valence in the Rhône River. After capturing Lyon on 30 April, the attackers first sacked, then demolished all Catholic institutions in the city.

Hoping to turn Toulouse over to Condé, local Huguenots seized the &quot;Hôtel de ville&quot; but met resistance from angry Catholic mobs which resulted in street battles and over 3,000 deaths, mostly Huguenots. On 12 April 1562, there were massacres of Huguenots at Sens, as well as at Tours in July. As the conflict escalated, the Crown revoked the Edict under pressure from the Guise faction.

The major engagements of the war occurred at Rouen, Dreux, and Orléans. At the Siege of Rouen (May–October 1562), the crown regained the city, but Antoine of Navarre died of his wounds. In the Battle of Dreux (December 1562), Condé was captured by the crown, and the constable Montmorency was captured by those opposing the crown. In February 1563, at the Siege of Orléans, Francis, Duke of Guise, was shot and killed by the Huguenot Jean de Poltrot de Méré. As he was killed outside of direct combat, the Guise considered this an assassination on the orders of the duke&#x27;s enemy, Admiral Coligny. The popular unrest caused by the assassination, coupled with the resistance by the city of Orléans to the siege, led Catherine de&#x27; Medici to mediate a truce, resulting in the Edict of Amboise on 19 March 1563.

=== &quot;Armed Peace&quot; (1563–1567) and the &quot;second&quot; war (1567–1568) ===

The Edict of Amboise was generally regarded as unsatisfactory by all concerned, and the Guise faction was particularly opposed to what they saw as dangerous concessions to heretics. The crown tried to re-unite the two factions in its efforts to re-capture Le Havre, which had been occupied by the English in 1562 as part of the Treaty of Hampton Court between its Huguenot leaders and Elizabeth I of England. That July, the French expelled the English. On 17 August 1563, Charles IX was declared of age at the Parlement of Rouen ending the regency of Catherine de Medici. His mother continued to play a principal role in politics, and she joined her son on a Grand Tour of the kingdom between 1564 and 1566, designed to reinstate crown authority. During this time, Jeanne d&#x27;Albret met and held talks with Catherine at Mâcon and Nérac.

Reports of iconoclasm in Flanders led Charles IX to lend support to the Catholics there; French Huguenots feared a Catholic re-mobilisation against them. Philip II of Spain&#x27;s reinforcement of the strategic corridor from Italy north along the Rhine added to these fears, and political discontent grew. After Protestant troops unsuccessfully tried to capture and take control of King Charles IX in the Surprise of Meaux, a number of cities, such as La Rochelle, declared themselves for the Huguenot cause. Protestants attacked and massacred Catholic laymen and clergy the following day in Nîmes, in what became known as the &quot;Michelade&quot;.

This provoked the second war and its main military engagement, the Battle of Saint-Denis, where the crown&#x27;s commander-in-chief and lieutenant general, the 74-year-old Anne de Montmorency, died. The war was brief, ending in another truce, the Peace of Longjumeau (March 1568), which was a reiteration of the Peace of Amboise of 1563 and once again granted significant religious freedoms and privileges to Protestants. News of the truce reached Toulouse in April, but such was the antagonism between the two sides that 6,000 Catholics continued their siege of Puylaurens, a notorious Protestant stronghold in the Lauragais, for another week.

=== &quot;Third&quot; war (1568–1570) ===
In reaction to the Peace, Catholic confraternities and leagues sprang up across the country in defiance of the law throughout the summer of 1568. Huguenot leaders such as Condé and Coligny fled court in fear for their lives, many of their followers were murdered, and in September, the Edict of Saint-Maur revoked the freedom of Huguenots to worship. In November, William of Orange led an army into France to support his fellow Protestants, but, the army being poorly paid, he accepted the crown&#x27;s offer of money and free passage to leave the country.

The Huguenots gathered a formidable army under the command of Condé, aided by forces from south-east France, led by Paul de Mouvans, and a contingent of fellow Protestant militias from Germanyincluding 14,000 mercenary &quot;reiters&quot; led by the Calvinist Duke of Zweibrücken. After the Duke was killed in action, his troops remained under the employ of the Huguenots who had raised a loan from England against the security of Jeanne d&#x27;Albret&#x27;s crown jewels. Much of the Huguenots&#x27; financing came from Queen Elizabeth of England, who was likely influenced in the matter by Sir Francis Walsingham. The Catholics were commanded by the Duke d&#x27;Anjoulater King Henry IIIand assisted by troops from Spain, the Papal States, and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.

The Protestant army laid siege to several cities in the Poitou and Saintonge regions (to protect La Rochelle), and then Angoulême and Cognac. At the Battle of Jarnac (16 March 1569), the prince of Condé was killed, forcing Admiral de Coligny to take command of the Protestant forces, nominally on behalf of Condé&#x27;s 16-year-old son, Henry, and the 15-year-old Henry of Navarre, who were presented by Jeanne d&#x27;Albret as the legitimate leaders of the Huguenot cause against royal authority. The Battle of La Roche-l&#x27;Abeille was a nominal victory for the Huguenots, but they were unable to seize control of Poitiers and were soundly defeated at the Battle of Moncontour (30 October 1569). Coligny and his troops retreated to the south-west and regrouped with Gabriel, comte de Montgomery, and in spring of 1570, they pillaged Toulouse, cut a path through the south of France, and went up the Rhone valley up to La Charité-sur-Loire. The staggering royal debt and Charles IX&#x27;s desire to seek a peaceful solution led to the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (8 August 1570), negotiated by Jeanne d&#x27;Albret, which once more allowed some concessions to the Huguenots.

== St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre and &quot;fourth&quot; war (1572–1573) ==
With the kingdom once more at peace, the crown began seeking a policy of reconciliation to bring the fractured polity back together. One key part of this was to be a marriage between Navarre, the son of Jeanne d&#x27;Albret and Antoine of Navarre, and Margaret of Valois, the king&#x27;s sister. Albret was hesitant, worried it might lead to the abjuration of her son, and it took until March 1572 for the contract to be signed.

Coligny, who had a price on his head during the third civil war, was restored to favour through the peace, and received lavishly at court in August 1571. He firmly believed that France should invade the Spanish Netherlands to unify the Catholics and Huguenots behind the king. Charles, however, was unwilling to provide more than covert support to this project, not wanting open war with Spain. The council was unanimous in rejecting Coligny&#x27;s policy and he left court, not finding it welcoming.

In August, the wedding was finally held, and all the most powerful Huguenot aristocracy had entered Paris for the occasion. A few days after the wedding, Coligny was shot on his way home from council. The outraged Huguenot nobility demanded justice which the king promised to provide. Catherine, Guise, Anjou, and Alba were all variously suspected, though the Huguenot nobility directed their anger primarily at Guise, threatening to kill him in front of the king.

The court, increasingly alarmed at the possibility of Protestant forces marching on the capital, or a new civil war, decided to pre-emptively strike at the Huguenot leadership. On the morning of 24 August, several kill squads were formed, one going out under Guise, which killed Coligny around 4am, leaving his body on the street where it was mutilated by Parisians and thrown into the Seine.

By dawn it was clear the assassinations had not gone according to plan, with militant factions of the population slaughtering their Huguenot neighbours under the claim that &#x27;the king willed it&#x27;. For the next five days, the violence continued as Catholics massacred Calvinist men, women, and children and looted their houses. King Charles IX informed ambassadors that he had ordered the assassinations to prevent a Huguenot coup and proclaimed a day of jubilee in celebration even as the killings continued. Over the next few weeks, the disorder spread to more than a dozen cities across France. Historians estimate that 2,000 Huguenots were killed in Paris and thousands more in the provinces; in all, perhaps 10,000 people were killed. Henry of Navarre and his cousin, the young Prince of Condé, managed to avoid death by agreeing to convert to Catholicism. Both repudiated their conversions after they escaped Paris.

The massacre provoked horror and outrage among Protestants throughout Europe, but both Philip II of Spain and Pope Gregory XIII, following the official version that a Huguenot coup had been thwarted, celebrated the outcome. In France, Huguenot opposition to the crown was seriously weakened by the deaths of many of the leaders. Many Huguenots emigrated to Protestant countries. Others reconverted to Catholicism for survival, and the remainder concentrated in a small number of cities where they formed a majority.

=== &quot;Fourth&quot; war (1572–1573) ===
The massacres provoked further military action, which included Catholic sieges of the cities of Sommières (by troops led by Henri I de Montmorency), Sancerre, and La Rochelle (by troops led by the duke of Anjou). The end of hostilities was brought on by the election (11–15 May 1573) of the Duke of Anjou to the throne of Poland and by the Edict of Boulogne (signed in July 1573), which severely curtailed many of the rights previously granted to French Protestants. Based on the terms of the treaty, all Huguenots were granted amnesty for their past actions and the freedom of belief. However, they were permitted the freedom to worship only within the three towns of La Rochelle, Montauban, and Nîmes, and even then only within their own residences. Protestant aristocrats with the right of high-justice were permitted to celebrate marriages and baptisms, but only before an assembly limited to ten persons outside of their family.

== 1574–1580 ==

=== Death of Charles IX and the &quot;fifth&quot; war (1574–1576) ===
In the absence of the duke of Anjou, disputes between Charles and his youngest brother, the duke of Alençon, led to many Huguenots congregating around Alençon for patronage and support. A failed coup at Saint-Germain (February 1574), allegedly aiming to release Condé and Navarre who had been held at court since St Bartholemew&#x27;s, coincided with rather successful Huguenot uprisings in other parts of France such as Lower Normandy, Poitou, and the Rhône valley, which reinitiated hostilities.

Three months after Henry of Anjou&#x27;s coronation as King of Poland, his brother Charles IX died (May 1574) and his mother declared herself regent until his return. Henry secretly left Poland and returned via Venice to France, where he faced the defection of Montmorency-Damville, ex-commander in the Midi (November 1574). Despite having failed to have established his authority over the Midi, he was crowned King Henry III, at Rheims (February 1575), marrying Louise Vaudémont, a kinswoman of the Guise, the following day. By April, the crown was already seeking to negotiate, and the escape of Alençon from court in September prompted the possibility of an overwhelming coalition of forces against the crown, as John Casimir of the Palatinate invaded Champagne. The crown hastily negotiated a truce of seven months with Alençon and promised Casimir&#x27;s forces 500,000 livres to stay east of the Rhine, but neither action secured a peace. By May 1576, the crown was forced to accept the terms of Alençon, and the Huguenots who supported him, in the Edict of Beaulieu, known as the Peace of Monsieur.

=== Catholic League and the &quot;sixth&quot; war (1576–1577) ===

The Edict of Beaulieu granted many concessions to the Calvinists, but these were short-lived in the face of the Catholic League – which the ultra-Catholic, Henry I, Duke of Guise, had formed in opposition to it. The House of Guise had long been identified with the defense of the Roman Catholic Church and the Duke of Guise and his relations – the Duke of Mayenne, Duke of Aumale, Duke of Elbeuf, Duke of Mercœur, and the Duke of Lorraine – controlled extensive territories that were loyal to the League. The League also had a large following among the urban middle class.

King Henry III at first tried to co-opt the head of the Catholic League and steer it towards a negotiated settlement. This was anathema to the Guise leaders, who wanted to bankrupt the Huguenots and divide their considerable assets with the King. A test of King Henry III&#x27;s leadership occurred at the meeting of the Estates-General at Blois in December 1576. At the meeting of the Estates-General, there was only one Huguenot delegate present among all of the three estates; the rest of the delegates were Catholics with the Catholic League heavily represented. Accordingly, the Estates-General pressured Henry III into conducting a war against the Huguenots. In response Henry said he would reopen hostilities with the Huguenots but wanted the Estates-General to vote him the funds to carry out the war. Yet, the Third Estate refused to vote for the necessary taxes to fund this war.

The Estates General of 1576 failed to resolve matters, and by December, the Huguenots had already taken up arms in Poitou and Guyenne. While the Guise faction had the unwavering support of the Spanish Crown, the Huguenots had the advantage of a strong power base in the southwest; they were also discreetly supported by foreign Protestant governments, but in practice, England or the German states could provide few troops in the ensuing conflict. After much posturing and negotiations, Henry III rescinded most of the concessions that had been made to the Protestants in the Edict of Beaulieu with the Treaty of Bergerac (September 1577), confirmed in the Edict of Poitiers passed six days later.

=== &quot;Seventh&quot; war (1579–1580) ===
Despite Henry according his youngest brother Francis the title of Duke of Anjou, the prince and his followers continued to create disorder at court through their involvement in the Dutch Revolt. Meanwhile, the regional situation disintegrated into disorder as both Catholics and Protestants armed themselves in &#x27;self defence&#x27;. In November 1579, Condé seized the town of La Fère, leading to another round of military action, which was brought to an end by the Treaty of Fleix (November 1580), negotiated by Anjou.

== War of the Three Henrys (1585–1589) ==
=== Death of Anjou and ensuing succession crisis (1584–1585) ===
The fragile compromise came to an end in 1584, when the Duke of Anjou, the King&#x27;s youngest brother and heir presumptive, died. As Henry III had no son, under Salic Law, the next heir to the throne was the Calvinist Prince Henry of Navarre, a descendant of Louis IX. When it became clear that Henry of Navarre would not renounce his Protestantism, the Duke of Guise signed the Treaty of Joinville (31 December 1584) on behalf of the League, with Philip II of Spain, who supplied a considerable annual grant to the League over the following decade to maintain the civil war in France, with the hope of destroying the French Calvinists. Under pressure from the Guise, Henry III reluctantly issued the Treaty of Nemours (7 July 1585) and an edict suppressing Protestantism (18 July 1585) and annulling Henry of Navarre&#x27;s right to the throne.

=== Escalation into war (1585) ===

The situation degenerated into open warfare even without the King having the necessary funds. Henry of Navarre again sought foreign aid from the German princes and Elizabeth I of England. Meanwhile, the solidly Catholic people of Paris, under the influence of the Committee of Sixteen, were becoming dissatisfied with Henry III and his failure to defeat the Calvinists. On 12 May 1588, the Day of the Barricades, a popular uprising raised barricades on the streets of Paris to defend the Duke of Guise against the alleged hostility of the king, and Henry III fled the city. The Committee of Sixteen took complete control of the government, while the Guise protected the surrounding supply lines. The mediation of Catherine de&#x27;Medici led to the Edict of Union, in which the crown accepted almost all the League&#x27;s demands: reaffirming the Treaty of Nemours, recognizing Cardinal de Bourbon as heir, and making Henry of Guise Lieutenant-General.

=== Estates-General of Blois and assassination of Henry of Guise (1588) ===

Refusing to return to Paris, Henry III called for an Estates General to meet at Blois. During the Estates-General, Henry III suspected that the members of the third estate were being manipulated by the League and became convinced that Guise had encouraged the duke of Savoy&#x27;s invasion of Saluzzo in October 1588. Viewing the House of Guise as a dangerous threat to the power of the Crown, Henry III decided to strike first. On 23 December 1588, at the Château de Blois, Henry of Guise and his brother, the Cardinal de Guise, were lured into a trap by the King&#x27;s guards. The Duke arrived in the council chamber where his brother the Cardinal waited. The Duke was told that the King wished to see him in the private room adjoining the royal chambers. There guardsmen seized the duke and stabbed him in the heart, while others arrested the Cardinal who later died on the pikes of his escort. To make sure that no contender for the French throne was free to act against him, the King had the Duke&#x27;s son imprisoned. The Duke of Guise had been highly popular in France, and the Catholic League declared open war against King Henry III. The Sorbonne declared Henri deposed. Henri for his part now joined forces with his cousin, the Huguenot, Henry of Navarre, to war against the League.

=== Assassination of Henry III (1589) ===

It thus fell upon the younger brother of the Duke of Guise, the Duke of Mayenne, to lead the Catholic League. The League presses began printing anti-royalist tracts under a variety of pseudonyms, while the Sorbonne proclaimed on 7 January 1589 that it was just and necessary to depose Henry III, and that any private citizen was morally free to commit regicide. In July 1589, in the royal camp at Saint-Cloud, a Dominican friar named Jacques Clément gained an audience with the King and drove a long knife into his spleen. Clément was killed on the spot, taking with him the information of who, if anyone, had hired him. On his deathbed, Henry III called for Henry of Navarre, and begged him, in the name of statecraft, to become a Catholic, citing the brutal warfare that would ensue if he refused. In keeping with Salic Law, he named Henry as his heir. However, many Catholics considered Navarre&#x27;s Protestantism to be unacceptable. Navarre later declared that he would uphold the Catholic faith without changes.

== Henry IV&#x27;s &quot;conquest of the kingdom&quot; (1589–1593) ==

The state of affairs in 1589 was that Henry of Navarre, now Henry IV of France, held the south and west, and the Catholic League the north and east. The leadership of the Catholic League had devolved to the Duke de Mayenne, who was appointed Lieutenant-General of the kingdom. He and his troops controlled most of rural Normandy. However, in September 1589, Henry inflicted a severe defeat on the Duke at the Battle of Arques. Henry&#x27;s army swept through Normandy, taking town after town throughout the winter.
The King knew that he had to take Paris if he stood any chance of ruling all of France. This, however, was no easy task. The Catholic League&#x27;s presses and supporters continued to spread stories about atrocities committed against Catholic priests and the laity in Protestant England (see Forty Martyrs of England and Wales). The city prepared to fight to the death rather than accept a Calvinist king.

The Battle of Ivry, fought on 14 March 1590, was another decisive victory for Henry against forces led by the Duke of Mayenne. Henry&#x27;s forces then went on to besiege Paris, but after a long and desperately fought resistance by the Parisians, Henry&#x27;s siege was lifted by a Spanish army under the command of the Duke of Parma. Then, what had happened at Paris was repeated at Rouen (November 1591 – March 1592).

Parma was subsequently wounded in the hand during the Siege of Caudebec whilst trapped by Henry&#x27;s army. Having then made a miraculous escape from there, he withdrew into Flanders, but with his health quickly declining, Farnese called his son Ranuccio to command his troops. He was, however, removed from the position of governor by the Spanish court and died in Arras on 3 December. For Henry and the Protestant army at least, Parma was no longer a threat.

=== War in Brittany ===

Meanwhile, Philippe Emmanuel, Duke of Mercœur, whom Henry III had made governor of Brittany in 1582, was endeavouring to make himself independent in that province. A leader of the Catholic League, he invoked the hereditary rights of his wife, Marie de Luxembourg, who was a descendant of the dukes of Brittany and heiress of the Blois-Brosse claim to the duchy as well as Duchess of Penthièvre in Brittany, and organized a government at Nantes. Proclaiming his son &quot;prince and duke of Brittany&quot;, he allied with Philip II of Spain, who sought to place his own daughter, infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia, on the throne of Brittany. With the aid of the Spanish under Juan del Águila, Mercœur defeated Henry IV&#x27;s forces under the Duke of Montpensier at the Battle of Craon in 1592, but the royal troops, reinforced by English contingents, soon recovered the advantage; in September 1594, Martin Frobisher and John Norris with eight warships and 4,000 men besieged Fort Crozon, also known as the &quot;Fort of the Lion (El León)&quot; near Brest and captured it on November 7, killing 400 Spaniards including women and children as only 13 survived.

== Toward peace (1593–1598) ==

=== Conversion ===

Despite the campaigns between 1590 and 1592, Henry IV was &quot;no closer to capturing Paris&quot;. Realising that Henry III had been right and that there was no prospect of a Protestant king succeeding in resolutely Catholic Paris, Henry agreed to convert, reputedly stating &quot;Paris vaut bien une messe&quot; (&quot;Paris is well worth a Mass&quot;). He was formally received into the Catholic Church in 1593, and was crowned at Chartres in 1594 as League members maintained control of the Cathedral of Reims, and, sceptical of Henry&#x27;s sincerity, continued to oppose him. He was finally received into Paris in March 1594, and 120 League members in the city who refused to submit were banished from the capital. Paris&#x27; capitulation encouraged the same of many other towns, while others returned to support the crown after Pope Clement VIII absolved Henry, revoking his excommunication in return for the publishing of the Tridentine Decrees, the restoration of Catholicism in Béarn, and appointing only Catholics to high office. Evidently Henry&#x27;s conversion worried Protestant nobles, many of whom had, until then, hoped to win not just concessions but a complete reformation of the French Church, and their acceptance of Henry was by no means a foregone conclusion.

=== War with Spain (1595–1598) ===
By the end of 1594, certain League members still worked against Henry across the country, but all relied on Spain&#x27;s support. In January 1595, the king declared war on Spain to show Catholics that Spain was using religion as a cover for an attack on the French stateand to show Protestants that his conversion had not made him a puppet of Spain. Also, he hoped to reconquer large parts of northern France from the Franco-Spanish Catholic forces. The conflict mostly consisted of military action aimed at League members, such as the Battle of Fontaine-Française, though the Spanish launched a concerted offensive in 1595, taking Le Catelet, Doullens and Cambrai (the latter after a fierce bombardment), and in the spring of 1596 capturing Calais by April. Following the Spanish capture of Amiens in March 1597 the French crown laid siege until its surrender in September. With that victory Henry&#x27;s concerns then turned to the situation in Brittany where he promulgated the Edict of Nantes and sent Bellièvre and Brulart de Sillery to negotiate a peace with Spain. The war was drawn to an official close after the Edict of Nantes, with the Peace of Vervins in May 1598.

=== Resolution of the war in Brittany (1598–1599) ===
In early 1598, the king marched against Mercœur in person, and received his submission at Angers on 20 March 1598. Mercœur subsequently went to exile in Hungary. Mercœur&#x27;s daughter and heiress was married to the Duke of Vendôme, an illegitimate son of Henry IV.

== Edict of Nantes (1598) ==
Henry IV was faced with the task of rebuilding a shattered and impoverished kingdom and uniting it under a single authority. Henry and his advisor, the Duke of Sully saw that the essential first step in this was the negotiation of the Edict of Nantes, which to promote civil unity granted the Huguenots substantial rightsbut rather than being a sign of genuine toleration, was in fact a kind of grudging truce between the religions, with guarantees for both sides. The Edict can be said to mark the end of the Wars of Religion, though its apparent success was not assured at the time of its publication. Indeed, in January 1599, Henry had to visit the &quot;parlement&quot; in person to have the Edict passed. Religious tensions continued to affect politics for many years to come, though never to the same degree, and Henry IV faced many attempts on his life; the last succeeding in May 1610.

== Aftermath ==
Although the Edict of Nantes concluded the fighting during Henry IV&#x27;s reign, the political freedoms it granted to the Huguenots (seen by detractors as &quot;a state within the state&quot;) became an increasing source of trouble during the 17th century. The damage done to the Huguenots meant a decline from 10% to 8% of the French population. The decision of King Louis XIII to reintroduce Catholicism in a portion of southwestern France prompted a Huguenot revolt. By the Peace of Montpellier in 1622, the fortified Protestant towns were reduced to two: La Rochelle and Montauban. Another war followed, which concluded with the Siege of La Rochelle, in which royal forces led by Cardinal Richelieu blockaded the city for fourteen months. Under the 1629 Peace of La Rochelle, the &quot;brevets&quot; of the Edict (sections of the treaty that dealt with military and pastoral clauses and were renewable by letters patent) were entirely withdrawn, though Protestants retained their prewar religious freedoms.

Over the remainder of Louis XIII&#x27;s reign, and especially during the minority of Louis XIV, the implementation of the Edict varied year by year. In 1661 Louis XIV, who was particularly hostile to the Huguenots, started assuming control of his government and began to disregard some of the provisions of the Edict. In 1681, he instituted the policy of dragonnades, to intimidate Huguenot families to convert to Roman Catholicism or emigrate. Finally, in October 1685, Louis issued the Edict of Fontainebleau, which formally revoked the Edict and made the practice of Protestantism illegal in France. The revocation of the Edict had very damaging results for France. While it did not prompt renewed religious warfare, many Protestants chose to leave France rather than convert, with most moving to the Kingdom of England, Brandenburg-Prussia, the Dutch Republic, Switzerland and the Americas.

At the dawn of the 18th century, Protestants remained in significant numbers in the remote Cévennes region of the Massif Central. This population, known as the Camisards, revolted against the government in 1702, leading to fighting that continued intermittently until 1715, after which the Camisards were largely left in peace.

<doc id="141495" wikidata="Q173843" url="?curid=141495" title="List of regents">
<text>A regent is a person selected to act as head of state (ruling or not) because the ruler is a minor, not present, or debilitated. The following is a list of regents throughout history.

== Regents in extant monarchies ==
Those who held a regency briefly, for example during surgery, are not necessarily listed, particularly if they performed no official acts; this list is also not complete, presumably not even for all monarchies included. The list includes some figures who acted as regent, even if they did not themselves hold the title of regent.

=== Asia ===
==== Cambodia ====
* Prince Sisowath Monireth, Chairman of the Regency Council of Cambodia in 1960
* Chea Sim, Acting Head of State of Cambodia from 1993 to 1994, and again from 1994 to 1995, and twice in 2004

<doc id="141496" wikidata="Q653260" url="?curid=141496" title="Depth charge">
<text>A depth charge is an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) weapon designed to destroy submarines by detonating in the water near the target and subjecting it to a destructive hydraulic shock. Most depth charges use high explosives with a fuze set to detonate the charge, typically at a specific depth from the surface. Depth charges can be dropped by ships (typically fast, agile surface combatants such as destroyers or frigates), patrol aircraft and helicopters.

Depth charges were developed during World War I, and were one of the first viable methods of attacking a submarine underwater. They were widely used in World War I and World War II, and remained part of the anti-submarine arsenals of many navies during the Cold War, during which they were supplemented, and later largely replaced, by anti-submarine homing torpedoes.

A depth charge fitted with a nuclear warhead is also known as a &quot;nuclear depth bomb&quot;. These were designed to be dropped from a patrol plane or deployed by an anti-submarine missile from a surface ship, or another submarine, located a safe distance away. By the late 1990s all nuclear anti-submarine weapons had been withdrawn from service by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia and China. They have been replaced by conventional weapons whose accuracy and range had improved greatly as ASW technology improved.

==History==
The first attempt to fire charges against submerged targets was with aircraft bombs attached to lanyards which triggered them. A similar idea was a guncotton charge in a lanyarded can. Two of these lashed together became known as the &quot;depth charge Type A&quot;. Problems with the lanyards tangling and failing to function led to the development of a chemical pellet trigger as the &quot;Type B&quot;. These were effective at a distance of around .

A 1913 Royal Navy Torpedo School report described a device intended for countermining, a &quot;dropping mine&quot;. At Admiral John Jellicoe&#x27;s request, the standard Mark II mine was fitted with a hydrostatic pistol (developed in 1914 by Thomas Firth and Sons of Sheffield) preset for firing, to be launched from a stern platform. Weighing , and effective at , the &quot;cruiser mine&quot; was a potential hazard to the dropping ship. The design work was carried out by Herbert Taylor at the RN Torpedo and Mine School, HMS &quot;Vernon&quot;. The first effective depth charge, the Type D, became available in January 1916. It was a barrel-like casing containing a high explosive (usually TNT, but amatol was also used when TNT became scarce). There were initially two sizes—Type D, with a charge for fast ships, and Type D* with a charge for ships too slow to leave the danger area before the more powerful charge detonated.

A hydrostatic pistol actuated by water pressure at a pre-selected depth detonated the charge. Initial depth settings were . Because production could not keep up with demand, anti-submarine vessels initially carried only two depth charges, to be released from a chute at the stern of the ship. The first success was the sinking of &quot;U-68&quot; off County Kerry, Ireland, on 22 March 1916, by the Q-ship &quot;Farnborough.&quot; Germany became aware of the depth charge following unsuccessful attacks on &quot;U-67&quot; on 15 April 1916, and &quot;U-69&quot; on 20 April 1916. The only other submarines sunk by depth charge during 1916 were &quot;UC-19&quot; and &quot;UB-29&quot;.

Numbers of depth charges carried per ship increased to four in June 1917, to six in August, and 30–50 by 1918. The weight of charges and racks caused ship instability unless heavy guns and torpedo tubes were removed to compensate. Improved pistols allowed greater depth settings in increments, from . Even slower ships could safely use the Type D at below and at or more, so the relatively ineffective Type D* was withdrawn. Monthly use of depth charges increased from 100 to 300 per month during 1917 to an average of 1745 per month during the last six months of World War I. The Type D could be detonated as deep as by that date. By the war&#x27;s end, 74,441 depth charges had been issued by the RN, and 16,451 fired, scoring 38 kills in all, and aiding in 140 more.

The United States requested full working drawings of the device in March 1917. Having received them, Commander Fullinwider of the U.S. Bureau of Naval Ordnance and U.S. Navy engineer Minkler made some modifications and then patented it in the U.S. It has been argued that this was done to avoid paying the original inventor.

The Royal Navy Type D depth charge was designated the &quot;Mark VII&quot; in 1939. Initial sinking speed was with a terminal velocity of at a depth of if rolled off the stern, or upon water contact from a depth charge thrower. Cast iron weights of were attached to the Mark VII at the end of 1940 to increase sinking velocity to . New hydrostatic pistols increased the maximum detonation depth to . The Mark VII&#x27;s amatol charge was estimated to be capable of splitting a submarine pressure hull at a distance of , and forcing the submarine to surface at twice that. The change of explosive to Torpex (or Minol) at the end of 1942 was estimated to increase those distances to .

The British Mark X depth charge weighed and was launched from the torpedo tubes of older destroyers to achieve a sinking velocity of . The launching ship needed to clear the area at 11 knots to avoid damage, and the charge was seldom used. Only 32 were actually fired, and they were known to be troublesome.

The teardrop-shaped United States Mark 9 depth charge entered service in the spring of 1943. The charge was of Torpex with a sinking speed of and depth settings of up to . Later versions increased depth to and sinking speed to with increased weight and improved streamlining.

Although the explosions of the standard United States Mark 4 and Mark 7 depth charge used in World War II were nerve-wracking to the target, a U-boat&#x27;s pressure hull would not rupture unless the charge detonated within about . Getting the weapon within this range was a matter of luck and quite unlikely as the target took evasive action. Most U-boats sunk by depth charges were destroyed by damage accumulated from an extended barrage rather than by a single charge, and many survived hundreds of depth charges over a period of many hours, such as &quot;U-427&quot;, which survived 678 depth charges in April 1945.

==Delivery mechanisms==

The first delivery mechanism was to simply roll the &quot;ashcans&quot; off racks at the stern of the moving attacking vessel. Originally depth charges were simply placed at the top of a ramp and allowed to roll. Improved racks, which could hold several depth charges and release them remotely with a trigger, were developed towards the end of the First World War. These racks remained in use throughout World War II because they were simple and easy to reload.

Some Royal Navy trawlers used for anti-submarine work during 1917 and 1918 had a thrower on the forecastle for a single depth charge, but there do not seem to be any records of it being used in action. Specialized depth charge throwers were developed to generate a wider dispersal pattern when used in conjunction with rack-deployed charges. The first of these was developed from a British Army trench mortar. 1277 were issued, 174 installed in auxiliaries during 1917 and 1918. The bombs they launched were too light to be truly effective; only one U-boat is known to have been sunk by them.

Thornycroft created an improved version able to throw a charge . The first was fitted in July 1917 and became operational in August. In all, 351 torpedo boat destroyers and 100 other craft were equipped. Projectors called &quot;Y-guns&quot; (in reference to their basic shape), developed by the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Ordnance from the Thornycroft thrower, became available in 1918. Mounted on the centerline of the ship with the arms of the &quot;Y&quot; pointing outboard, two depth charges were cradled on shuttles inserted into each arm. An explosive propellant charge was detonated in the vertical column of the Y-gun to propel a depth charge about over each side of the ship. The main disadvantage of the Y-gun was that it had to be mounted on the centerline of a ship&#x27;s deck, which could otherwise be occupied by superstructure, masts, or guns. The first were built by New London Ship and Engine Company beginning on 24 November 1917.

The K-gun, standardized in 1942, replaced the Y-gun as the primary depth charge projector. The K-guns fired one depth charge at a time and could be mounted on the periphery of a ship&#x27;s deck, thus freeing valuable centerline space. Four to eight K-guns were typically mounted per ship. The K-guns were often used together with stern racks to create patterns of six to ten charges. In all cases, the attacking ship needed to be moving fast enough to get out of the danger zone before the charges exploded.
Depth charges could also be dropped from an aircraft against submarines. At the start of World War II, Britain&#x27;s primary aerial anti-submarine weapon was the anti-submarine bomb, but it was too light to be effective. To replace it, the Royal Navy&#x27;s Mark VII depth charge was modified for aerial use by the addition of a streamlined nose fairing and stabilising fins on the tail; it entered service in 1941 as the Mark VII Airborne DC. Other designs followed in 1942.

Experiencing the same problems as the RAF with ineffective anti-submarine bombs, Captain Birger Ek of Finnish Air Force squadron LeLv 6 contacted a navy friend to use Finnish Navy depth charges from aircraft, which led to his unit&#x27;s Tupolev SB bombers being modified in early 1942 to carry depth charges.

Later depth charges for dedicated aerial use were developed. These are still useful today and remain in use, particularly for shallow-water situations where a homing torpedo may not be effective. Depth charges are especially useful for &quot;flushing the prey&quot; in the event of a diesel submarine hiding on the bottom.

==Effectiveness==
The effective use of depth charges required the combined resources and skills of many individuals during an attack. Sonar, helm, depth charge crews and the movement of other ships had to be carefully coordinated. Aircraft depth charge tactics depended on the aircraft using its speed to rapidly appear from over the horizon and surprising the submarine on the surface (where it spent most of its time) during the day or night (at night using radar to detect the target and a Leigh light to illuminate it immediately before attacking), then quickly attacking once it had been located, as the submarine would normally crash dive to escape attack.

As the Battle of the Atlantic wore on, British and Commonwealth forces became particularly adept at depth charge tactics, and formed some of the first destroyer hunter-killer groups to actively seek out and destroy German U-boats.

Surface ships usually used ASDIC (sonar) to detect submerged submarines. However, to deliver its depth charges a ship had to pass over the contact to drop them over the stern; sonar contact would be lost just before attack, rendering the hunter blind at the crucial moment. This gave a skilful submarine commander an opportunity to take evasive action. In 1942 the forward-throwing &quot;hedgehog&quot; mortar, which fired a spread salvo of bombs with contact fuzes at a &quot;stand-off&quot; distance while still in sonar contact, was introduced, and proved to be effective.

===Pacific theater and the May Incident===
In the Pacific Theater during World War II, Japanese depth charge attacks were initially unsuccessful because they were unaware that the latest United States Navy submarines could dive so deep. Unless caught in shallow water, an American submarine could dive below the Japanese depth charge attack. The Japanese had used attack patterns based on the older United States S-class submarines (1918–1925) that had a test depth of ; while the WWII Balao-class submarines (1943) could reach .

This changed in June 1943 when U.S. Congressman Andrew J. May of the House Military Affairs Committee caused The May Incident. The congressman, who had just returned from the Pacific theater where he had received confidential intelligence and operational briefings from the US Navy, revealed at a press conference that there were deficiencies in Japanese depth-charge tactics. After various press associations reported the depth issue, the Japanese Imperial Navy began setting their depth charges to explode at a more effective average depth of . Vice Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, commander of the U.S. submarine fleet in the Pacific, later estimated that May&#x27;s ill-advised comments cost the US Navy as many as ten submarines and 800 seamen killed in action.

==Later developments==
For the reasons expressed above, the depth charge was generally replaced as an anti-submarine weapon. Initially, this was by ahead-throwing weapons such as the British-developed Hedgehog and later Squid mortars. These weapons threw a pattern of warheads ahead of the attacking vessel to bracket a submerged contact. The Hedgehog was contact fuzed, while the Squid fired a pattern of three large, depth charges with clockwork detonators. Later developments included the Mark 24 &quot;Fido&quot; acoustic homing torpedo (and later such weapons), and the SUBROC, which was armed with a nuclear depth charge. The USSR, United States and United Kingdom developed nuclear depth bombs. , the Royal Navy retains a depth charge labelled as Mk11 Mod 3, which can be deployed from its AgustaWestland Wildcat and Merlin HM.2 helicopters.

Russia has also developed homing (but unpropelled) depth charges including the S3V Zagon and the 90SG. China has also produced such weapons.

===Signaling===
During the Cold War when it was necessary to inform submarines of the other side that they had been detected but without actually launching an attack, low-power &quot;signalling depth charges&quot; (also called &quot;practice depth charges&quot;) were sometimes used, powerful enough to be detected when no other means of communication was possible, but not destructive.

==Underwater explosions==

The high explosive in a depth charge undergoes a rapid chemical reaction at an approximate rate of . The gaseous products of that reaction momentarily occupy the volume previously occupied by the solid explosive, but at very high pressure. This pressure is the source of the damage and is proportional to the explosive density and the square of the detonation velocity. A depth charge gas bubble expands to equalize with the pressure of the surrounding water.

This gas expansion propagates a shock wave. The density difference of the expanding gas bubble from the surrounding water causes the bubble to rise toward the surface. Unless the explosion is shallow enough to vent the gas bubble to the atmosphere during its initial expansion, the momentum of water moving away from the gas bubble will create a gaseous void of lower pressure than the surrounding water. Surrounding water pressure then collapses the gas bubble with inward momentum causing excess pressure within the gas bubble. Re-expansion of the gas bubble then propagates another potentially damaging shock wave. Cyclical expansion and contraction can continue for several seconds until the gas bubble vents to the atmosphere.

Consequently, explosions where the depth charge is detonated at a shallow depth and the gas bubble vents into the atmosphere very soon after the detonation are quite ineffective, even though they are more dramatic and therefore preferred in movies. A sign of an effective detonation depth is that the surface just slightly rises and only after a while vents into a water burst.

Very large depth charges, including nuclear weapons, may be detonated at sufficient depth to create multiple damaging shock waves. Such depth charges can also cause damage at longer distances, if reflected shock waves from the ocean floor or surface converge to amplify radial shock waves. Submarines or surface ships may be damaged if operating in the convergence zones of their own depth charge detonations.

The damage that an underwater explosion inflicts on a submarine comes from a primary and a secondary shock wave. The primary shock wave is the initial shock wave of the depth charge, and will cause damage to personnel and equipment inside the submarine if detonated close enough. The secondary shock wave is a result of the cyclical expansion and contraction of the gas bubble and will bend the submarine back and forth and cause catastrophic hull breach, in a way that can be likened to bending a plastic ruler rapidly back and forth until it snaps. Up to sixteen cycles of secondary shock waves have been recorded in tests. The effect of the secondary shock wave can be reinforced if another depth charge detonates on the other side of the hull in close time proximity to the first detonation, which is why depth charges are normally launched in pairs with different pre-set detonation depths.

The killing radius of a depth charge depends on the depth of detonation, the payload of the depth charge and the size and strength of the submarine hull. A depth charge of approximately of TNT (400 MJ) would normally have a killing radius (resulting in a hull breach) of only against a conventional 1000-ton submarine, while the disablement radius (where the submarine is not sunk but is put out of commission) would be approximately . A larger payload increases the radius only slightly because the effect of an underwater explosion decreases as the cube of the distance to the target.

<doc id="141541" wikidata="Q215327" url="?curid=141541" title="Helsinki Airport">
<text>Helsinki-Vantaa Airport (, ) , or simply Helsinki Airport, is the main international airport serving Helsinki, the capital of Finland, as well as its surrounding metropolitan area, and the Uusimaa region in Finland. The airport is located in the neighbouring city of Vantaa, about west of Tikkurila, the administrative centre of Vantaa and north of Helsinki&#x27;s city centre. The airport is operated by state-owned Finavia. The facility covers a total of 1,800 hectares (4,448 acres) of land and contains three runways.

The airport is by far the busiest in Finland (with 20 times the traffic of the next-busiest, Rovaniemi) and the fourth busiest in the Nordic countries in terms of passenger numbers. About 90% of Finland&#x27;s international air traffic passes through Helsinki Airport. In 2023, Helsinki Airport had a total of 15.3 million passengers, 88% of whom were international passengers and 12% domestic passengers. On average, the airport handles around 350 departures a day.

The airport is the main hub for Finnair, the flag carrier of Finland, and its subsidiary Nordic Regional Airlines. It is also a hub for CityJet (on behalf of SAS) and an operating base for Jettime, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Sunclass Airlines and TUI fly Nordic. Helsinki Airport has around 50 regularly-operating airlines. The airport has around 80 scheduled destinations to other parts of Europe and 21 direct long-haul routes to Asia, the Middle East, and North America. There are also 35 charter destinations including numerous long-haul charter destinations.

Originally built for the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, the airport today provides jobs for 25,000 people and 1,500 companies operate at the airport.

Finavia aims to strengthen the position of Helsinki Airport in transit passenger traffic between Europe and Asia, and to increase the number of direct connections to Europe. Helsinki Airport&#x27;s minimum transit time of 35 minutes is among the shortest in Europe. According to Finavia&#x27;s survey, as many as one in every three passengers select their flight route based on the transit airport.

== History ==

=== Opening and the first intercontinental service (1952–1960s) ===
The planning of a new airport for Helsinki began in the 1940s, when it became obvious that the Helsinki-Malmi Airport could not handle the increasing number of passengers or the new, heavier aircraft. A new site was found some from Helsinki city centre, in an area that today belongs to the city of Vantaa (until 1971 Vantaa was called &quot;Helsingin maalaiskunta&quot;). Some of the construction work was done by prison laborers. The airport opened temporarily in July 1952 for that year&#x27;s Summer Olympics, held in Helsinki.

The first two Aero Oy DC-3 aircraft, OH-LCC &quot;Tiira&quot; with its captain Olli Puhakka and first officer Pertti Uuksulainen, and OH-LCD &quot;Lokki&quot;, landed in Vantaa on 26 June 1952, and the first scheduled international airplane to land on the airport was the DC-6 B &quot;Torgil Viking&quot; of Scandinavian Airlines on 26 October 1952. While Aero (now Finnair) used Helsinki-Malmi Airport, charter flights were directed to the new airport on 26 October 1952. The airport originally had a single runway, the second runway being built four years later in 1956, and the first airplane hangar was also built in the same year. The airport also received its first radar in the same year. Regular jet flight operations began in 1959.

A new passenger terminal opened in 1969, while the first transatlantic service to New York was inaugurated on 15 May 1969. A contiguous fence around the entire airport area was built in spring 1973.

During this time period, the airport was also called &quot;Seutula Airport&quot; after the nearby village Seutula.

=== New terminal and first Asian flights (1970s–1990s) ===
The year 1973 saw the first security checks being carried out for international flights. The name Helsinki-Vantaa Airport was used from 1977, with the airport being known as the Helsinki Airport before this. The postal code of the airport was &quot;01530 Helsinki-Lento&quot; until 1974, &quot;01530 Helsinki-Vantaa-Lento&quot; from 1974 to 1983 and &quot;01530 Vantaa&quot; from 1983 onwards.

The Finnish Defence Forces surrounded the airport in late autumn 1977, in order to protect the airport from a possible terrorist strike by the Red Army Faction.

In 1983, the airport began offering the first non-stop service from Western Europe to Japan as Finnair commenced regular service between Helsinki and Tokyo with a single McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30ER. In the 1970s, Pan Am operated flights from Helsinki to the US. The passenger terminal was expanded for the first time in 1983 and five years later, in 1988, the airport handled over six million passengers annually.

In 1991, Delta Air Lines began its operations at the airport. A new terminal was constructed for domestic flights in 1993. In 1996, the international terminal was expanded and merged with the domestic terminal. At the same time, the new control tower was completed. In 1997, a new VIP President terminal was opened for official international state visits. In November 1999, the international terminal was further expanded and the lobby for arriving and departing passengers was built.

=== New millennium and expansion of non-Schengen area (2000–2009) ===
A historical event in 2000 was that the annual number of visitors to the Helsinki-Vantaa Airport surpassed 10 million. Approach traffic control moved from the so-called &quot;cave&quot; into its new overground premises.

New border controls of the Schengen Agreement were taken into use in 2001. The third runway was inaugurated on 28 November 2002 and the first user was Finnair&#x27;s McDonnell Douglas MD-11 en route to New York. In 2004, the international terminal was again expanded and a new shopping area was opened for long-haul passengers. A new air cargo service was opened for passengers with overweight luggage. 24 new automatic check-in terminals were taken into use in 2006.

On 13 August 2007 a new Hilton hotel, Hilton Helsinki-Vantaa Airport was opened near the airport, with 330 rooms. Independent use of parallel runways started in November 2007.

A free-of-charge WLAN network was opened at the airport on 25 November 2008.

In autumn 2009, the airport saw a great deal of industrial action, as Finavia outsourced check-in security controls. The security controls were moved over to the cleaning and building service concern SOL. The labour agreements also changed. SOL started co-operation negotiations for 80 employees in January 2010. Outsourcing the security services had a positive impact on Finavia&#x27;s economy, as this allowed the company to reach significant cost savings during the first half of 2010 compared to the second half of the previous year. This was largely because of the outsourcing of the security services at the Helsinki Airport. In late 2012, the Labour Court of Finland gave a statement that the security services at the airport were under the labour agreement of the security guard industry. After this, SOL terminated its contract, to end at the end of 2014 in the middle of its contract period.

Finnair outsourced its baggage handling services from its daughter company Northport to Barona Handling in November to December 2009, after which the baggage handling employees went on an illegal strike for four days. During New Year from 2009 to 2010, thousands of bags lay untouched at the airport, inaccessible to their owners. According to the employees, there were one tenth less people handling the loading of the baggage than before. The Aviation Union accused Barona of neglecting safety regulations when unloading the accumulated pile of baggage during the industrial action. In January 2010, the Finnish News Agency wrote that some of the employees had sent baggage to the wrong destination on purpose. In 2009, the airport dropped out of the list of the Airport Service Quality research.

In 2009, an expansion of Terminal 2 was completed. The total floor area was . The same year witnessed the opening of a new shopping area and spa for passengers on long-haul flights, the removal of a terminal-specific division between domestic and international flights in favour a division by airline, and the renovation of Terminal 1 for international flights. In the same year, TAP Air Portugal commenced service between Helsinki and Lisbon.

Five new passenger bridges for wide-body aircraft were opened in 2009. The spa was closed down in 2012 because of lack of use. In 2011, the annual number of passengers at the airport grew by 15.5% to 14.9 million passengers. About 25% of passengers were transferring to a connecting flight at the airport. 12.2 million passengers were on international flights and 2.7 million on domestic flights. A total of 1.63 million passengers were on flights to Asia.

=== Significant growth and expansion (2010–present) ===
During the 2010s, Helsinki Airport experienced large increases in the number of annual passengers. In 2010, the airport handled 12,883,399 passengers, an increase of 2.2 percent compared to 2009. Air freight increased by 29.4 percent.

In April 2010, Norwegian Air Shuttle opened its first routes to Oslo and Stockholm using Boeing 737 jets. Now the airline is one of the largest operators at the airport with almost 40 destinations in Europe, Asia, and Africa. In 2011, Helsinki Airport saw its biggest growth in a single year in the number of passengers. The number of annual passengers was increased by 2 million passengers and the airport reached the milestone of 14 million passengers. However, easyJet canceled three routes, from Helsinki to Manchester, London–Gatwick, and Paris–Charles de Gaulle, citing weak demand at Helsinki.

In November 2011, Austrian Airlines canceled its Vienna–Helsinki operations. In the same year, Czech Airlines ceased its Helsinki operations due to low demand. A year after, LOT Polish Airlines canceled its service to Helsinki. In 2014, a number of airlines such as Aer Lingus, Germanwings, and S7 Airlines canceled services to Helsinki.

In the 2010s, the airport saw a huge growth of long-haul flights in terms of weekly flights (see Long-haul traffic below).

In the beginning of 2015, the renovation and construction work related to the development of Helsinki Airport started. For example, the Baggage Claim Hall 2B and Arrival Hall 2A were renovated and in July 2015, train operation on the Ring Rail Line and connection to Helsinki Central Railway Station were opened. In March 2015, Swiss International Air Lines started operations to Helsinki but canceled it a year later. In late 2015, Blue1 ceased all operations from Helsinki which was the airline&#x27;s only base. The airline flew to 28 destinations in Europe. Scandinavian Airlines sold Blue1 to CityJet, which continues to operate the company on behalf of SAS as part of a larger relationship. In 2015, the airport handled up to 16 million passengers for the first time. In March 2016, Czech Airlines resumed flights from Prague to Helsinki using Airbus A319 aircraft. On 10 October 2016, the first Gulf carrier Qatar Airways began operations at the airport and now operates to Helsinki by Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The carrier was initially planning to launch the service as early as 2012. Finavia expects that the airport will handle over 18.5 million passengers in 2017 and around 20 million in 2018, or in 2019 at the latest. Also in 2017, the airport experienced huge growth in numbers of passengers flying intercontinental.

As of 2013, Finavia has been expanding the airport (see Future expansion below).

Life in HEL (#lifeinhel) was a Finavia marketing campaign which took place from 10 October to 9 November 2017 at Helsinki Airport. The campaign mixed TV, game shows, and social media. Ryan Zhu, a Chinese actor and TV personality, lived in a little cabin inside Helsinki Airport for 30 days. Helsinki Airport was awarded the title of best airport in the world by Travellink; by the campaign, Finavia wanted to prove this claim.

A new terminal expansion was opened in 2012. The terminals 1 and 2 were combined on 21 June 2022 so that all flights are now operated from a single terminal.

== Construction projects ==
In spring 2010, a new baggage handling centre utilising the latest technology was taken into use at the airport, concentrating all handling of departing and transferring baggage. Handling of arriving baggage remains at its current handling facility.

The parts of the airport that were completed in 1969 and 1983 were thoroughly renovated. Basic repairs were completed in 2012.

Runway 3 (22R/04L) was repaired from April to June 2012, during which time the runway was out of use. After this the taxiway next to runway 2 (15/33) was repaired, during which time runway 2 served as a temporary taxiway. The repairs were completed in September 2012.

The main runway 04R/22L was repaired in summer 2015 and was reopened in early August.

The Helsinki Airport station was opened on 10 July 2015. The Ring Rail Line connects the Helsinki–Riihimäki railway in the north with the Vantaankoski railway in the west. The trip from the airport to the Helsinki Central station takes about half an hour, and the trip to Tikkurila railway station takes about ten minutes. The Helsinki Airport station was built underground between the parking garages P3A and P1/P2. The station has a walking connection to the connecting corridor between terminals 1 and 2.

Expansion of the terminals started in early 2016 from the southern wing of the long-distance flight area, which was completed in summer 2017. After this, construction of the western wing was started, which was completed in autumn 2019. Expansion of terminal 1 was also started in 2017, giving the terminal an additional 3,500 square metres of floor area. Terminal 1 was lengthened by 230 metres and gained seven new departure gates.

As part of the development program, a new parking garage was also opened, with a connection to the terminal. The new parking garage is equipped with solar panels, and it has an area for recharging 200 electric cars. The development program also included about 2000 new parking places.

Expansion of the terminal is undergoing to the north of the terminal building, including expansion of the number of commercial services, gates and docks for airplanes. The expansion also includes improvement of passenger connections to the terminal. The expansion was taken into use in late 2021.

The development program was completed in September 2023. Before this, new lobbies for departing and arriving passengers and a connecting travel centre were taken into use. Also the old departure lobby of Terminal 2 will be changed into part of the Schengen gate area, expanding the size of the area considerably.

During New Year 2020 to 2021, a three-year repair project of the station level was completed, not included in the development program. The purpose of the repair project, which cost 32 million euro, is to ensure the safety of taxiing and parking the airplanes and to improve the capacity and effectiveness of air traffic. The infrastructure of the station level will be modernised, allowing a further decrease of environmental impacts of air traffic.

A two-part &quot;Avia Pilot&quot; building with 13 floors was built within walking distance of the terminal, with Finavia as its main tenant. In early 2018, a new Scandic Hotels hotel with 148 rooms was opened in the building. This is the third hotel in the immediate vicinity of the airport.

== Interior gallery ==
== Composition ==
The airport has one terminal. The terminal capacity of the airport is approximately 16–17 million passengers per year.

Domestic flights, as well as flights to European Schengen countries, are operated from gates 11–34. Long-haul and European non-Schengen flights are operated from gates 34–55.

In 2014, Helsinki Airport introduced the world&#x27;s first passenger tracking system, which automatically monitors crowd congestion and prevents bottlenecks at the airport.

The airport&#x27;s signage is in English, Finnish, Swedish, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and Russian.

Current terminal (former Terminal 2) opened in 1969 for international operations and, at present, also serves domestic flights. The non-Schengen area of the terminal was enlarged in 2009 enabling the airport to accommodate eight wide-body aircraft at gates simultaneously while a new shopping area and a spa were opened for passengers on long-distance flights, and the division between domestic and international flights was removed. Terminal 2 has many restaurants, bars and shopping areas. The terminal is equipped with 26 aircraft parking stands with passenger bridges. The terminal has a train connection to Helsinki Central railway station.

Passenger facilities include numerous tax-free shops, Avis, Europcar and Hertz-car rentals, free wireless Internet access, power sockets, lockers, sleeping pods and transfer service desks. Currency exchange, cash machines (ATM), tourist information and an Alepa grocery store and pharmacy are also available. For children, there are also several playrooms. Dining facilities include Burger King and O&#x27;Learys Sports Bar as well as numerous other restaurants and cafés. Terminal 2 also includes two Finnair lounges: Finnair Lounge in the Schengen-area and Finnair Premium Lounge in the non-Schengen area.

As a part of Helsinki Airport&#x27;s expansion plan, the new South Pier was inaugurated in June 2017 and Aukio in February 2019. The new pier features moving walkways and dual boarding jet bridges to enable handling larger aircraft more efficiently. In November 2019, the West Pier opened and it is able to accommodate the Airbus A380 superjumbo. Five of the gates are able to accommodate two regional jets, such as Boeing 737s or Airbus A320s, simultaneously at a single gate. Passengers arriving and departing are divided into two floors: one for arriving passengers, the other for departures. In June 2016, the new bus terminal for remote aircraft stand operations was opened to increase the airport&#x27;s capacity with gates 50A-M.

=== Other buildings ===

There are several airport hotels and office buildings on the grounds of the airport. The Aviapolis is a new international business park adjacent to the Helsinki airport area, already hosting the operations of numerous companies around the airport. In 2013, Finnair opened its new head office, known as House of Travel and Transportation, or &quot;HOTT&quot;. The construction of HOTT began in July 2011 and finished on time in June 2013.

=== Ground handling ===
Airpro, Aviator, and Swissport provide ground handling services for airlines.

== Runways ==

Helsinki Airport has three runways. The runways can handle take-offs and landings of the heaviest aircraft in use today such as the Airbus A380. The use of three runways allows two runways to be kept in operation when clearing of snow and ice is needed (if one runway is being cleared at a time).

=== Runway usage principles ===

There are about twenty different runway combinations in use. The primary runway for landings is Runway 2 (15) from the northwest, i.e. from the direction of Nurmijärvi, or Runway 1 (22L) from the northeast, i.e., from the direction of Kerava, while the primary runway for take-offs is Runway 3 (22R) towards the southwest, in the direction of Western Vantaa and Espoo. Aircraft with low noise can take off from Runway 1 (22L) towards the south at the same time. When the wind is from the north or east, Runway 3 (04L) or Runway 1 (04R) are usually used for landings, i.e., for approaches from the southwest, the direction of Western Vantaa and Espoo, while take-offs are made from Runway 1 (04R) towards the northeast in the direction of Kerava.

During the night time, landings are primarily made using Runway 2 (15) from the northwest, i.e., from the direction of Nurmijärvi, and take-offs using Runway 3 (22R) towards the southwest, in the direction of Espoo. Jet plane landings to Runway 2 (33) from the southeast and take-offs from Runway 2 (15) towards the southeast are avoided due to dense population in the affected areas. During night time, propeller plane operations towards the southeast are also prohibited unless otherwise dictated by air traffic safety. Air traffic safety is the main reason for not always being able to choose the optimal runway for noise control.

== Technology ==

=== Airport-CDM ===

In October 2012, Finavia implemented Airport CDM (Collaborative Decision Making) at Helsinki Airport. It is a procedure by Eurocontrol, the European Organization for Safety of Air Navigation, that develops airport operation by increasing co-operation between partners at the airport. Airport CDM aims to reduce costs, achieve lower emissions, improve punctuality of operations and increase customer satisfaction at the airport. Helsinki Airport was the seventh European and first Northern European airport to adopt the program.

== Operations ==
=== Passenger operations ===

Helsinki Airport is connected to over 140 destinations worldwide and over 50 countries by passenger services. Helsinki Airport has around 50 airlines operating regularly. In addition, there are numerous charter airlines operating at the airport. The airport is the main hub for Finnair, that operates over 1100 flights weekly to Europe, Asia, and North America. The airport is also used as an operating base for Norwegian Air Shuttle, and the low-cost airline operates over 230 flight weekly to elsewhere in Europe as well as the United Arab Emirates and Morocco.

==== Main airlines ====
The following airlines maintain hub or base operations at Helsinki Airport:

* Finnair is the largest airline operating at the airport, with an all-Airbus fleet of 48 aircraft (excluding Norra) based at Helsinki, providing scheduled services to the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and North-America. Finnair operates flights from Helsinki to over 100 destinations, including around 20 intercontinental routes. All flights are operated from Terminal 2.
* Jet Time is a charter airline that operates several flights from Helsinki to Europe.
* Nordic Regional Airlines (Norra) is a subsidiary of Finnair that operates to around 30 destinations in Europe. Norra has a fleet of 23 ATR and Embraer aircraft, all operated for Finnair. This airline operates from Terminal 2.
* Norwegian Air Shuttle is a low-cost airline which operates to over 30 destinations from Helsinki to Europe and the Middle East, operating from Terminal 2. The airline is the biggest operator at the airport after Finnair (including Norra) and has served over 10 million passengers since 2010.
* SunClass Airlines uses Helsinki Airport as a focus city with many charter flights to Southeast Asia and Europe. The airline operates from Terminal 2.
* TUI fly Nordic is a charter airline that operates to Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Caribbean in North America. The airline operates from Terminal 2. On 10 September 2018, TUI announced plans to close its Helsinki base in the near future with Jet Time taking over the company&#x27;s short-haul operations at the airport.

Passenger numbers have been growing rapidly since 2010, but especially since 2014. In 2017, Helsinki Airport experienced the third highest growth rate and the second biggest increase in passenger numbers in the last 20 years. On 13 December 2017, the airport reached the milestone of 18 million passengers for the first time ever.

=== Cargo operations ===

Helsinki Airport has been one of the busiest airports among the Nordic countries by freight handled. In 2012, the airport handled 192,204 tonnes cargo making the airport the largest one in the Nordics in terms of tonnes of cargo handled that year.

Helsinki Airport has extensive cargo flight activity. There is a cargo area with cargo terminals and cargo transit facilities in the southeastern part of the airport area. ASL Airlines Belgium (formerly TNT Airways) and DHL have their own cargo terminals at the airport. Currently scheduled cargo operating airlines are AirBridgeCargo Airlines operated with Boeing 747 cargo aircraft, ASL Airlines Belgium, DHL Aviation (operated by EAT Leipzig and DHL Air UK), FedEx, UPS Airlines, and Turkish Airlines that operates cargo services to HEL from Istanbul, Oslo, and Stockholm with Airbus A310F and A330F aircraft. In addition to scheduled cargo operations, many other cargo airlines have random operations at Helsinki Airport.

The construction of a new freight terminal () began in March 2015 and was inaugurated on 8 January 2018. The capacity of the terminal is 350,000 tonnes but the theoretical capacity is up to 450,000 tonnes. The freight capacity of the airport is being expanded to accommodate the growing freight capacity that will be provided by Finnair&#x27;s Airbus A350 XWB fleet. Finnair&#x27;s freight operations continued in the previous location until relocation to the new freight terminal in December 2017. The name of the new terminal is Cool Nordic Cargo Hub, but is branded COOL for its modern technology and capacity to handle high volumes of temperature-controlled cargo. A new operations monitoring and tracking platform, &quot;Cargo Eye&quot;, is used in the new freight terminal. That gives the new Cargo Control Center a live view of what is happening across the cargo network and where everything is located. The terminal has 29 stands for truck transports.

== Long-haul traffic ==
The airport&#x27;s first long-haul route began on 15 May 1969 when Finnair commenced flights to New York City via Copenhagen and Amsterdam. The first non-stop route to East Asia started in 1983 with Finnair&#x27;s flight to Tokyo, with Beijing following five years later.

Today 36 intercontinental routes to North America, Asia, and the Middle East operate from Helsinki Airport. Long-haul traffic is a major part of the airport&#x27;s operations, in large part thanks to Finnair, the largest carrier at the airport. Helsinki Airport is an important transfer airport between Europe and Asia. In 2018, Helsinki Airport handled approximately 3.7 million transfer passengers, which was 21.0% more than in 2017. At the beginning of 2018, over 140 weekly flights were flown directly from Helsinki to Asia.

Finnair and Japan Airlines had long been the only carriers flying to Asia from Helsinki, but in 2019, Tibet Airlines, Juneyao Airlines and Sichuan Airlines launched non-stop flights from Jinan, Shanghai and Chengdu respectively. Helsinki Airport offers far fewer flights to North America.

== Airlines and destinations ==

=== Passenger ===

Helsinki Airport offers non-stop flights to 162 destinations in over 50 countries around the world operated by over 20 airlines. These include more than 100 cities in Europe and the Middle East, over 20 in Asia, and eight in North America. The following airlines offer flights at Helsinki Airport:

=== Cargo ===
== Traffic statistics ==
Helsinki Airport is the fourth-busiest airport in the Nordics, serving over 15 million passengers in 2023.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Helsinki Airport was the busiest Nordic airport in terms of Asian passengers and in 2015, the airport was the fifth busiest airport in Europe in terms of flights to Asia. In 2018, Helsinki Airport was connected to Asia with over 140 weekly flights. When ranked by connectivity, the airport was the best-connected airport in Northern Europe with around 10,000 connections worldwide, 85% more than in Copenhagen which was the 2nd best-connected airport in the Nordics. The number of connections from Helsinki Airport had grown by 96% during the 2010s. In Europe, the airport was the 12th best-connected airport. According to Airports Council International (ACI), Helsinki Airport was one of the fastest-growing airports in Europe in 2017.

In 2016, passengers from Japan, China, South Korea and United States made up the four largest groups of non-European travelers at Helsinki Airport. The airport handled around 386,000 Japanese passengers, 321,000 Chinese passengers, 136,000 Korean passengers and 98,000 US citizens. Other major nationalities were Singapore, Thailand, Turkey, Malaysia, Ukraine, Vietnam, Taiwan, Israel and Indonesia.

In the 2010s, Helsinki Airport&#x27;s passenger volumes grew significantly. In 2010, the airport handled 12.9 million passengers while by 2019, the number of annual passengers had nearly doubled to over 21.8 million passengers.

In 2024, Finavia stated that &quot;transfer travel from Asia to Europe via Helsinki Airport is (...) approximately 30% lower than in 2019&quot; due to Russian reciprocal sanctions prohibiting Finnair among others, to use Russian airspace, making the flight time on some routes several hours longer, more fuel consuming and previous flight connections impossible.






== Ground transport ==
The airport is located in the immediate vicinity of Ring III and Finnish national road 45. The railway running beneath the airport in a tunnel is connected to the Helsinki commuter rail.

=== Rail ===

The railway link to the airport opened for traffic in July 2015 and serves local commuter trains running at 10-minute intervals during peak periods. On evenings the train run every 15 minutes and at quieter times every 30 minutes. The railway is trafficked by low-floor Stadler FLIRT trains, operated by the VR Group.

The westbound commuter line &quot;I&quot; runs to Helsinki Central Station via Huopalahti, while the eastbound commuter line &quot;P&quot; runs to Helsinki Central Station via Tikkurilas. Eastbound trains stop at Tikkurila where passengers can transfer to long-distance trains going away from Helsinki, in the directions of Tampere and Lahti, including lines to Saint Petersburg and Moscow.

The P service is not in service through the night. Bus lines 570 to Mellunmäki and 600 to downtown Helsinki provide night service to and from the Airport.

Plans also exist for a direct connection between Helsinki Central, the airport, and the long-distance rail network via Kerava. This line, known as Lentorata, is projected to run in a tunnel for most of its approximately 30 km length.

=== Taxi ===
Taxi ranks are located outside Terminal 1 and Terminal 2.

Since 1 January 2022, contracted taxis at the Helsinki Airport are operated by Mankkaan Taksi Oy, Taksi Helsinki Oy and Menevä Oy. Other taxi companies can also provide their services, with the customer negotiating the transport price themselves.

=== Bus ===
There is regular bus service by bus line 600 from the airport to Helsinki Central railway station (mainly through the Tuusulanväylä) and to railway stations in the Helsinki metropolitan area. The chief operator of these services is the Helsinki Regional Transport Authority (HSL).

Coach connections to all parts of Finland are provided by Matkahuolto and ExpressBus.

Until 2020 the Finnair City Bus, operated by Pohjolan Liikenne, provided a direct bus connection from the Eliel Square in central Helsinki to the airport. In spring 2020, the service was suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in autumn 2020 Pohjolan Liikenne announced it would discontinue the service permanently. The service operated for the last time on 22 March 2020.

There are also daily bus connections to the Helsinki Airport from Turku and Tampere.

=== Parking ===
In August 2016, there were about 13 thousand parking spaces at the Helsinki Airport. Some of the spaces were taken out of use in January 2019 when the parking garage P1/P2 located near the terminal was dismantled to make way for the new entrance to the airport.

The airport has two parking garages (P3 and P5) as well as two outdoor parking areas (P4A and P4B). The free-of-charge bus service AirPortBus operated by Finavia travels between the parking areas and the terminal.

There are also companies providing airport parking services near the airport, where passengers can leave their cars in a guarded area and get transport to the airport.

== Accidents and hijackings ==

* On 2 December 1957, the approach of an Aeroflot Ilyushin Il-14 from Leningrad went too far in the thick fog, and the pilots failed to stop the plane until the end of the runway. The plane overran the runway and finally stopped at a highway embankment to the south of the airport area. The plane was carrying sixteen passengers and five crewmembers, of which ten people were injured. The accident site was closed off. There was no attempt to fix the plane in Finland. The plane was the size of a Convair Metropolitan, and it was disassembled and taken to the Soviet Union by car.
* On 19 August 1963, a Karair Convair CV-440 Metropolitan (OH-VKM) was damaged during landing to Helsinki Airport. During the landing in a thunderstorm the plane bounced three times off the runway and finally its nose wheel assembly broke. The plane fell down on its nose, both of its propellers hit the ground and the plane dragged along the runway for 1300 metres.
:The plane was fixed by January the next year and remained in service until 1973.
*On 21 August 1963, another Karair Convair CV-440-98 Metropolitan (OH-VKN) was damaged during landing to Helsinki Airport. The plane bounced three times off the runway, and on its last impact its nose wheel assembly broke, and the left middle wing was bent and twisted. The plane fell down on its nose, its propellers hit the ground, and the plane finally dragged onto the lawn to the left of the runway.
:Both Convair Metropolitan accidents were partly caused because air traffic control had been forbidden to provide complete information about the weather at the airport to approaching planes. Only the direction and speed of the wind were reported, not any approaching or present thunderstorms. The pilot of OH-VKN lost sight of the airport at a critical moment because of heavy rain and temporary blindness caused by a lightning flash.
*On 10 July 1977, two young Soviet men hijacked an Aeroflot Tupolev Tu-134 traveling from Petrozavodsk to Leningrad, trying to get to Stockholm. Because of lack of fuel, the plane had to land at Helsinki Airport. The hijacking situation lasted for three days, after which the hijackers surrendered to the police and were transported back to the Soviet Union.
*On 30 September 1978, 37-year-old former contractor Aarno Lamminparras hijacked a Finnair Sud Aviation Caravelle from Oulu to Helsinki. The plane visited Amsterdam and then returned to Helsinki Airport. Lamminparras surrendered to the police on 1 October. None of the 44 passengers on the plane were injured or killed.
*On 31 January 2005, a Nord-Flyg AB Cessna C208B on a cargo flight to Sweden crashed on the ground between the first and third runways soon after take-off. The reason of the accident was stalling caused by snow and ice left on the upper surface of the wing. The pilot, the only person on the plane, was slightly injured in the accident.

== Future expansion and plans ==


=== Master plan 2020 ===
In October 2013, Finavia received a capital injection of €200,000,000 from the Finnish Government. The investment enabled Finavia to start a development program worth €900,000,000 at Helsinki Airport, aiming at maintaining the strong position of Helsinki Airport in transit traffic between Europe and Asia. The program started in January 2014 and is planned to last until February 2020. It is expected to generate about 14,000 person-years of employment. Helsinki Airport was expected to serve 20 million passengers per year by 2020 and create about 5,000 new jobs at the airport. However, the airport served almost 21 million passengers in 2018; two years before the target. The expansion will increase capacity at the airport to 30 million passengers. In order to achieve this, the airport will expand both of its terminals and open a new entrance in place of the current parking and public transport area.

The Suomi-rata project, started in 2019, aims to build a new railway connection to the airport. It would create a new, twice as fast connection from the airport to the Helsinki Central railway station as well as a connection to the Finnish Main Line, allowing direct rail access to the airport also from elsewhere in Finland.

** Expansion of Schengen gate area – 2023

==== Terminal expansion ====
Helsinki Airport has capacity for about 17 million passengers annually, although this number was passed in 2016. Finavia decided to expand the current terminal building to respond to the expected passenger growth within the following years.

Part of the plan was to build a satellite terminal next to Terminal 2, but the plan was cancelled in favour of expansion under a single terminal building. In September 2014, Finavia revealed more detailed plans for the future expansion that will take place between 2014 and 2020. According to the plan Terminals 1 and 2 will be combined and expanded under one roof. This expansion work is one of Finland&#x27;s largest construction projects. The expansion was designed by the Finnish architects&#x27; office PES-Architects. The same office designed the previous Helsinki Airport expansions completed in 1996 and 1999, as well as the circular parking buildings in front of the terminal. The surface area will increase by 45%, luggage handling capacity will increase by 50%. The entire surface area of the terminal in 2020 will be approximately .

===== Expansion of Terminal 1 =====
Finavia plans to expand Terminal 1, which is used for flights within the Schengen area. The construction is scheduled to be started in November 2017. Terminal 1 will be expanded by four separate departure gate buildings which will be connected by walking corridors. Each building will have one departure gate excluding one, which will have three gates. Gates (5–11) will not be equipped with jet bridges. Buildings will have two floors.

===== Expansion of Terminal 2 =====
Terminal 2 will have new gates (8 additional gates to Terminal 2) and aircraft stands on the apron. All gates for long-haul flights will have double jet bridges (such as the ones at Incheon International Airport) to enable handling larger aircraft more efficiently. Finavia has signed a contract with Thyssen Krupp Airport Systems for 16 widebody aircraft stands with up to 33 new jet bridges. New jet bridges were installed to gates 38 and 39 (now 53 and 54). Gate 48 can accommodate the Airbus A380 superjumbo and there are new aircraft stands on the apron accommodating the A380. Five of the gates will be able to accommodate two regional jets, such as Boeing 737s or Airbus A320s, simultaneously at a single gate. Two of these gates are located at West Pier.

In June 2016, the new bus terminal for remote aircraft stand operations was opened to increase the airport&#x27;s capacity with gates 50A-M.

The new South Pier of Terminal 2 was inaugurated on 10 July 2017. The first scheduled flight from the new pier, AY006 departed from Gate 54 to New York City. The new pier covers . In addition to the new terminal building, new dual boarding gates S54 and S55 as well as aircraft stands 171 and 172 were opened. Construction of the southern wing of Terminal 2 started on 4 January 2016. The construction took around 18 months. There are two floors: one for arriving passengers, the other for departures and gates 52 to 55. All the gates have dual boarding jet bridges. The new wing also features the first moving walkway at any airport in Finland.

On 20 September 2016, the construction on the West Pier began, even though it was expected to start in summer 2017. The first part of the west wing is expected to be finished in April 2019 while the entire pier was completed in October 2019. The west wing represents some €300,000,000 of Finavia&#x27;s substantial total investment of €900,000,000. The first part of the west wing built is the large central plaza, &quot;Aukio&quot;, which was opened in February 2019. It brings of new passenger and baggage facilities to the airport. The pier is equipped with nine gates for widebody jets. Gate 48 is able to accommodate the Airbus A380.

The area of the apron to be renovated covers a total of .

The Helsinki Airport development program also includes plans to expand Terminal 2 to the area currently used for parking and public transport. This would provide more space for check-in, security control and baggage operations, allowing the airport to concentrate all departure and arrival services in a single terminal. On 1 December 2021, a new multimodal travel center will be opened in connection with Terminal 2, among other things, to streamline access to the airport from the train station and bus terminal.

==== New cargo terminal ====
The construction of a new freight terminal () began in March 2015. The capacity of the terminal is being expanded to accommodate the growing freight capacity that will be provided by Finnair&#x27;s Airbus A350 XWB fleet. Finnair&#x27;s freight operations will continue in the current location until relocation to the new freight terminal in spring 2017.

==== Contextual engine ====
Part of the rehaul of Helsinki Airport has included the development of a contextual engine that uses artificial intelligence to digest passenger data in ways that make passing through the airport a more pleasant experience. The benefits come from an array of small improvements; for example, digital signs change language according to the nationalities of those getting off a flight. Passengers are also continuously kept abreast of how long it will take them to reach their gates or pass through security control. Monocle named the contextual engine built by technology firm Reaktor as one of the top transportation innovations of 2018.

=== Planned third terminal ===
In addition to the terminal expansion, Finavia has also contemplated building a third terminal at Helsinki Airport. According to Finavia&#x27;s tentative plan, the new terminal would be located between runways 04R/22L and 04L/22R, while runway 15/33 would be removed. The terminal would be the principal terminal at the airport but the check-in area would stay in the current terminal building. The decision to build the third terminal has not yet been taken.

<doc id="141557" wikidata="Q471619" url="?curid=141557" title="Joe Shuster">
<text>Joseph Shuster ( ; July 10, 1914 – July 30, 1992) was a Canadian-American comic book artist best known for co-creating the DC Comics character Superman, with Jerry Siegel, in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 (cover-dated June 1938).

Shuster was involved in a number of legal battles over ownership of the Superman character. His comic book career after Superman was relatively unsuccessful, and by the mid-1970s, Shuster had left the field completely due to partial blindness.

He and Siegel were inducted into both the comic book industry&#x27;s Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1992 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1993. In 2005, the Canadian Comic Book Creator Awards Association instituted the Joe Shuster Awards, named to honor the Canada-born artist.

==Early life and career==
Joseph Shuster was born in Toronto, Ontario, to a Jewish family. His father, Julius Shuster (originally Shusterowich), an immigrant from Rotterdam, had a tailor shop in Toronto&#x27;s garment district. His mother, Ida (Katharske), had come from Kiev, Russian Empire (now Kyiv, Ukraine). His family, including his sister, Jean, lived on Bathurst, Oxford, and Borden Streets. In 1922 Julius Shuster was listed as living at 48 Major Street, and in 1923 and 1924 at 101 Oxford Street. Joe attended Ryerson and Lansdowne Public Schools (now Ryerson Community School and Lord Lansdowne Junior Public School with the Toronto District School Board). One of his cousins was comedian Frank Shuster of the Canadian comedy team Wayne and Shuster. He also had a brother named Frank.

As a youngster, Shuster worked as a newspaper boy for the &quot;Toronto Daily Star&quot;. The family barely made ends meet, and the budding young artist would scrounge for paper, which the family could not afford. He recalled in 1992,

Sometime in 1924, when Shuster was 9 or 10, his family moved to Cleveland, Ohio. There Shuster attended Glenville High School and befriended his later collaborator, writer Jerry Siegel, with whom he began publishing a science fiction fanzine called &quot;Science Fiction&quot;. Siegel described his friendship with the similarly shy and bespectacled Shuster: &quot;When Joe and I first met, it was like the right chemicals coming together.&quot;

The duo broke into comics at Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson&#x27;s National Allied Publications, the future DC Comics, working on the landmark &quot;New Fun&quot;—the first comic-book series to consist solely of original material rather than using any reprinted newspaper comic strips—debuting with the musketeer swashbuckler &quot;Henri Duval&quot; and the occult detective Doctor Occult, both in &quot;New Fun&quot; #6 (Oct. 1935). In a 1992 interview, in which he used the fledgling publisher&#x27;s future name, he said the two sample strips were not the ones eventually published:

==Creation of Superman==
Siegel and Shuster created a bald telepathic villain, bent on dominating the world, as the title character in the short story &quot;The Reign of the Superman&quot;, published in Siegel&#x27;s 1933 fanzine &quot;Science Fiction&quot; #3. The story was not successful, and the character was not used again.

The following year, Siegel re-used the name &quot;The Superman&quot; to develop a new character who became one of the most famous superheroes of all time. Shuster modelled the hero on Douglas Fairbanks Sr., and modelled his bespectacled alter ego, Clark Kent, on a combination of Harold Lloyd and Shuster himself, with the name &quot;Clark Kent&quot; derived from movie stars Clark Gable and Kent Taylor. Lois Lane was modeled on Joanne Carter, a model hired by Shuster. (She later married co-creator Jerry Siegel in 1948.) Siegel and Shuster&#x27;s origins as children of Jewish immigrants is also thought to have influenced their work. Timothy Aaron Pevey argued that they crafted &quot;an immigrant figure whose desire was to fit into American culture as an American&quot;, something which Pevey feels taps into an important aspect of American identity.

Siegel and Shuster then began a four-year quest to find a publisher. Titling the character &quot;The Superman&quot;, Siegel and Shuster offered it to Consolidated Book Publishing, who had published a 48-page black-and-white comic book entitled &quot;Detective Dan: Secret Operative&quot; #48. Siegel and Shuster each compared this character to Slam Bradley, an adventurer the pair had created for &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #1 (March 1937). Although the duo received an encouraging letter, Consolidated never again published comic books. Shuster was distraught over the rejection, and, by varying accounts, either burned every page of the story, with the cover surviving only because Siegel saved it from the fire, or he tore the story to shreds, with only two cover sketches remaining. 

In 1938, the proposal was languishing among others at &quot;More Fun Comics&quot;, published by National Allied Publications, the primary precursor of DC Comics. Editor Vin Sullivan chose it as the cover feature for National&#x27;s &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 (June 1938). The following year, Siegel &amp; Shuster initiated the syndicated &quot;Superman&quot; comic strip.
When &quot;Superman&quot; first appeared, Superman&#x27;s alter ego Clark Kent worked for the &quot;Daily Star&quot; newspaper, named by Shuster after the &quot;Toronto Daily Star&quot;, his old employer in Toronto. When the comic strip received international distribution, the company permanently changed the name to the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. Shuster said he modeled the cityscape of Superman&#x27;s home city, Metropolis, on that of his old hometown.

As part of the deal which saw Superman published in &quot;Action Comics&quot;, Siegel and Shuster sold the rights to the character in return for $130 and a contract to supply the publisher with material.

Due to financial difficulties, Wheeler-Nicholson had formed a corporation with Harry Donenfeld and Jack Liebowitz called Detective Comics, Inc. It was under the DC label that &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 (cover-dated June 1938) was published. A series of mergers and name changes resulted in the publisher becoming National Periodical Publications, and then, in 1977, DC Comics (which had been its nickname since 1940).

=== Legal issues ===
In 1946, near the end of their ten-year contract to produce Superman stories, Siegel and Shuster sued Detective Comics, Inc. to have their contract annulled and regain their rights to Superman. The following year, the New York State Supreme Court ruled the publisher had validly purchased the rights to Superman when it bought the first Superman story, saying the duo had &quot;transferred to Detective Comics, Inc., all of their rights in and to the comic strip Superman, including the title, names, characters and conception...&quot; 

A subsequent interlocutory judgment found that rights to Superboy, however, belonged to Siegel. Detective Comics Inc. subsequently paid Siegel and Shuster $94,000 for the rights to Superboy and the duo&#x27;s written agreement acknowledging the rights to Superman belonged to the publisher. 

Afterward, the company removed Shuster and Siegel&#x27;s byline from Superman stories.

==Later career==
In 1947, the team rejoined editor Sullivan, by then the founder and publisher of the comic-book company Magazine Enterprises where they created the short-lived comical crime-fighter Funnyman. Shuster continued to draw comics after the failure of &quot;Funnyman&quot;, although exactly what he drew is uncertain. Comic historian Ted White wrote that Shuster continued to draw horror stories into the 1950s. 

Shuster was also the anonymous illustrator for &quot;Nights of Horror&quot;, an underground sadomasochistic fetish paperback book series. In 1954, &quot;Nights of Horror&quot; garnered controversy because of its involvement in the trial of the Brooklyn Thrill Killers, where it was alleged by psychiatric expert and anti-comics crusader Fredric Wertham that the gang&#x27;s leader had read the books and that they were responsible for his crimes. The &quot;Nights of Horror&quot; series was seized and banned in the State of New York, and the case eventually went to the Supreme Court. However, the books&#x27; artist was never identified at the time. In 2004, Gerard Jones revealed that Shuster had drawn the books. The claim was backed in 2009 by comics historian Craig Yoe. This was based on character similarities, and comparison of the artistic style between the illustrations and those of the cast of the Superman comics.
In 1964, when Shuster was living on Long Island with his elderly mother, he was reported to be earning his living as a freelance cartoonist; he was also &quot;trying to paint pop art—serious comic strips—and hope[d] eventually to promote a one-man show in some chic Manhattan gallery&quot;. At one point, his worsening eyesight prevented him from drawing, and he worked as a deliveryman in order to earn a living. Jerry Robinson claimed Shuster had delivered a package to the DC building, embarrassing the employees. He was summoned to the CEO, given one hundred dollars, and told to buy a new coat and find another job. 

In 1967, when the Superman copyright came up for renewal, Siegel launched a second lawsuit, which also proved unsuccessful. 

In 1975, Siegel launched a publicity campaign, in which Shuster participated, protesting DC Comics&#x27; treatment of him and Shuster. The Association of American Editorial Cartoonists&#x27; president, Jerry Robinson, was involved in the campaign along with comic-book artist Neal Adams. By 1976, Shuster was almost blind and living in a California nursing home. Due to a great deal of negative publicity over their handling of the affair, and the upcoming &quot;Superman&quot; movie, DC&#x27;s parent company Warner Communications reinstated the byline dropped more than thirty years earlier and granted the pair a lifetime pension of $20,000 a year, later increased to $30,000, plus health benefits. The first issue with the restored credit was &quot;Superman&quot; #302 (Aug. 1976).

Although Shuster was now supported by a lifetime stipend from DC Comics, he fell into debt—close to $20,000 by the time of his death. After he died, DC Comics agreed to pay off his unpaid debts in exchange for an agreement from his heirs to not challenge ownership over Superman.

==Death==
Shuster died on July 30, 1992, at his West Los Angeles home of congestive heart failure and hypertension. He was 78.

<doc id="141558" wikidata="Q435324" url="?curid=141558" title="Princess Christina of the Netherlands">
<text>Princess Christina of the Netherlands (Maria Christina; 18 February 1947 – 16 August 2019) was the youngest of four daughters of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands and Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld. She taught singing in New York and was a long-term supporter of the Youth Music Foundation in the Netherlands. Born visually impaired, she worked to share her knowledge of dance and sound therapy with the blind.

She renounced her and her descendants&#x27; rights to the throne before marrying Cuban exile Jorge Guillermo in 1975, and converted to Catholicism in 1992. The couple had three children and built up an extensive art collection, before they divorced in 1996. Christina died of bone cancer in 2019.

==Early life==
Princess Christina, who was known as Princess &quot;Marijke&quot; in her youth, was born on 18 February 1947, at Soestdijk Palace, Baarn, the Netherlands. Her parents were Crown Princess Juliana, the only child of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, and Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld. At the time of her birth, she was fifth in the line to the throne after her mother and three older sisters: Princess Beatrix, Princess Irene and Princess Margriet.

She was baptised on 9 October 1947 and her godparents included Queen Wilhelmina (her maternal grandmother), her eldest sister Princess Beatrix, Sir Winston Churchill (for whom her father stood proxy), her paternal grandmother Princess Armgard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, Prince Felix of Luxembourg, and his niece Princess Anne of Bourbon-Parma.

On 4 September 1948, after a reign of nearly 58 years, Christina&#x27;s grandmother Queen Wilhelmina (68) abdicated the throne and her mother was inaugurated as Queen of the Kingdom of the Netherlands on 6 September 1948.

== Childhood and education ==

While her mother was pregnant with Christina, she contracted either measles or rubella and as a result, Christina was born nearly blind. With medical treatment and custom eyeglasses, her vision improved to a point that she could attend school and live a relatively normal life.

In 1963, she stopped using her first name Maria, from then on referring to herself merely as Christina. She graduated from secondary school (Amersfoort Lyceum) in 1965 and went on to attend the University of Groningen where she studied teaching theory. At age 21 she moved to Canada to study classical music at the &quot;École de musique Vincent-d’Indy&quot; in Montreal where she studied vocal teaching.

==Marriage==
While living in New York as Christina van Oranje, the Princess started a relationship with Cuban exile Jorge Guillermo.

Although societal attitudes were changing, because Guillermo was a Catholic, it was still possible that a marriage could cause a public scandal in the Netherlands such as the one that occurred in 1964 when Christina&#x27;s sister Princess Irene married the Catholic Prince Carlos Hugo of Bourbon-Parma. Accordingly, Princess Christina, at that time ninth in line for the Dutch throne, renounced her and her descendants&#x27; rights to the throne before officially announcing her engagement on St. Valentine&#x27;s Day, 1975. She converted to Catholicism in 1992.

The couple were married on 28 June 1975, civilly in Baarn and then religiously in an ecumenical ceremony in the Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht. After their wedding, they lived in New York but later moved to the Netherlands, where they built in Wassenaar, near The Hague. The couple built up an extensive art collection. They had three children: 
* &quot;Bernardo&quot; Federico Thomas Guillermo (born 17 June 1977, Utrecht), married 2 March 2009, New York City (USA), &quot;Eva-Marie&quot; Prinz-Valdez (born 2 August 1979) and has two children:
** &quot;Isabel&quot; Christina Guillermo (13 April 2009).
** &quot;Julián&quot; Jorge Guillermo (21 September 2011).
* &quot;Nicolás&quot; Daniel Mauricio Guillermo (born 6 July 1979, Utrecht), has two children with &quot;Leah-Michelle&quot; Pilon:
** &quot;Joaquín&quot; Christiaan Guillermo (16 September 2020).
** &quot;Carmen&quot; Ester Ruby Guillermo (10 April 2023).
* &quot;Juliana&quot; Edenia Antonia Guillermo (born 8 October 1981, Utrecht), has three children with &quot;Tao&quot; Bodhi:
** &quot;Kai&quot; Bodhi Guillermo (12 September 2014).
** &quot;Numa&quot; Bodhi Guillermo (born in 2016).
** &quot;Aida&quot; Bodhi Guillermo (born in 2019).

By her request, the couple divorced on 25 April 1996.

==Career==

She began teaching singing in New York after completing her vocal teaching studies at the &quot;École de musique&quot; Vincent-d’Indy in Montreal. She recorded and released several CDs (classical, Broadway) in 2000 and 2002, and was a long-term supporter of the Youth Music Foundation in the Netherlands. In 1989, she allowed her name to be used for the &quot;Prinses Christina Concours&quot; an annual competition held in the Netherlands to encourage the musical talents of children in the Netherlands.

She performed at the marriage of her nephew Prince Bernhard Jr. and this was one of her few public performances. She also sang at the funerals of both of her parents Princess Juliana and Prince Bernhard in the New Church (Delft).

She completed a dance therapist training and worked, in the later part of her career, with sound and dance therapy. She worked to share her knowledge in the fields of dance/sound therapy and physical contact, with the blind. She worked for the Visio foundation in the towns of Huizen and Breda to achieve this.

Early 2019, Christina made headlines when she decided to sell several works of art. These works came to her through inheritance from the Dutch royal family: art lover William II of the Netherlands. Dutch institutions including the Museum Boymans Van Beuningen did not have enough funds to purchase the major piece of the auction, an anatomical drawing by Peter Paul Rubens. It was sold by Sotheby&#x27;s for $8.2 million.

==Death==
In June 2018, it was announced that Princess Christina had been diagnosed with bone cancer. She died on 16 August 2019, aged 72. Her body was taken to Fagel&#x27;s Garden Pavilion nearby Noordeinde Palace for a private service held on 22 August, and her remains were cremated.

<text>Layamon or Laghamon (, ; ) – spelled Laȝamon or Laȝamonn in his time, occasionally written Lawman – was an English poet of the late 12th/early 13th century and author of the &quot;Brut&quot;, a notable work that was the first to present the legends of Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table in English poetry (the first Arthurian poems were by Frenchman Chrétien de Troyes).

J. R. R. Tolkien valued him as a transmitter of early English legends in a fashion comparable to the role played with respect to Icelandic legend by Snorri Sturluson.

==Life and influence==

Layamon describes himself in his poem as a priest living at Areley Kings in Worcestershire. His poem had a significant impact on medieval history writing in England and the development of Arthurian literature and subsequently provided inspiration for numerous later writers, including Sir Thomas Malory and Jorge Luis Borges.

==Brut==

&quot;Brut&quot; (ca. 1190) is a Middle English poem compiled and recast by Layamon. It is named after Britain&#x27;s mythical founder, Brutus of Troy. It is contained in the manuscripts Cotton Caligula A.ix, written in the first quarter of the 13th century, and in the Cotton Otho C.xiii, written about fifty years later (though in this edition it is shorter). Both are kept at the British Library.

The &quot;Brut&quot; is 16,095 lines long and narrates the history of Britain. It is largely based on the Anglo-Norman &quot;Roman de Brut&quot; by Wace, which is in turn inspired by Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. It is, however, longer than both and includes an enlarged section on the life and exploits of King Arthur. Among the new material Layamon provided were an account of the birth of Merlin and one of the origins of the Round Table, as well as details of Arthur&#x27;s departure by ship to Avalon to be healed by the elf-queen.

It is written in a combination of alliterative verse, deriving from Old English, and rhyme, influenced by Wace&#x27;s &quot;Roman de Brut&quot; and used in later Middle English poetry.

==Spelling of name==
Print-era editors and cataloguers have spelled his name in various ways, including &quot;Layamon&quot;, &quot;Lazamon&quot;, or &quot;Lawman&quot;. Brown University suggests that the form &quot;Layamon&quot; is etymologically incorrect; the Fifth International Conference on &quot;Brut&quot; at Brown University stated, &quot;BL MS Cotton Caligula A.ix spells it &quot; (the third letter is called a &quot;yogh&quot;). BL MS Cotton Otho C.xiii spelled it &#x27;Laweman&#x27; and &#x27;Loweman&#x27;.&quot;

<doc id="141575" wikidata="Q1189533" url="?curid=141575" title="Inwood, Manhattan">
<text>Inwood is a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Manhattan, at the northern tip of Manhattan Island, in the U.S. state of New York. It is bounded by the Hudson River to the west, Spuyten Duyvil Creek and Marble Hill to the north, the Harlem River to the east, and Washington Heights to the south.

Inwood is part of Manhattan Community District 12, and its primary ZIP Code is 10034. It is served by the 34th Precinct of the New York City Police Department and Engine Company 95/Ladder Company 36 of the New York City Fire Department. Politically, it is part of the New York City Council&#x27;s 10th district.

==History==

=== Lenape history ===
The north end of Manhattan, with its clam beds, cornfields, and annual fish runs, was described by the National Museum of the American Indian as the &quot;best place to live&quot; on the island before the Dutch and British colonists arrived in the 17th century. There was a large Lenape town straddling the Manhattan and Bronx sides of what is now called the Harlem River. &quot;Shorakapkok&quot; means &#x27;sitting-down place&#x27; in the Munsee language.

=== Colonial history ===

On May 24, 1626, according to legend, Peter Minuit, the director general of the Dutch colony of New Netherland, bought the island from the indigenous Lenape people for 60 Dutch guilders and, the story goes, some trinkets. On the southern tip of the island Minuit founded New Amsterdam. A plaque (on a rock) marking what is believed to be the spot of the sale is in Inwood Hill Park, the only natural forest left in Manhattan.

During the British occupation of Manhattan in the American Revolutionary War, there was an encampment containing more than sixty huts occupied by Hessian troops between 201st and 204th Streets along Payson Avenue. The camp was discovered in 1914 by local archeologist and historian Reginald Bolton after a series of digs around the neighborhood.

=== 19th century to present ===
The area between 190th and 192nd Streets was occupied by the Fort George Amusement Park, a trolley park/amusement park, from 1895 to 1914. Its site is now a seating area in Highbridge Park, which itself was laid out in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Inwood was a very rural section of Manhattan well into the early 20th century. Once the New York City Subway&#x27;s IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, the modern , reached Inwood in 1906, speculative developers constructed numerous apartment buildings on the east side of Broadway. Construction continued into the 1930s, when the IND Eighth Avenue Line, the modern , reached Dyckman and 207th Streets along Broadway and the large estates west of Broadway (Seaman, Dyckman, Isham, etc.) were sold off and developed. Many of Inwood&#x27;s impressive Art Deco apartment buildings were constructed during this period. The area around Dyckman Street and 10th Avenue formerly contained a stadium called the Dyckman Oval, with a capacity of 4,500 spectators, which hosted football games, boxing matches, and Negro league baseball games until it was demolished in 1938 and replaced by the Dyckman Houses public housing development in 1951.

The last family-owned farm in Manhattan is believed to have been in Inwood, close to the intersection of Broadway and 214th Street. It was operated by the Benedetto family and occupied an entire city block. The farm site was developed after being sold in 1954.

==Demographics==
For census purposes, the New York City government classifies Inwood as part of a larger neighborhood tabulation area called Inwood and Marble Hill. Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Inwood and Marble Hill was 46,746, a change of −2,341 (−5%) from the 49,087 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of . The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 15.1% (7,060) White, 9.1% (4,239) African American, 0.1% (64) Native American, 1.9% (884) Asian, 0% (5) Pacific Islander, 0.4% (179) from other races, and 1% (458) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 72.4% (33,857) of the population.

The racial composition of Inwood and Marble Hill changed moderately from 2000 to 2010, with the most significant changes being the Black population&#x27;s decrease by 13% (661) and the Hispanic / Latino population&#x27;s decrease by 5% (1,880). Meanwhile, the White population grew by 5% (335) and remained a minority, as with the Asian population which grew by 11% (86); the small population of all other races decreased by 24% (221).

The entirety of Community District 12, which comprises Inwood and Washington Heights, had 195,830 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 81.4 years. This is about the same as the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are children and middle-aged adults: 33% are between the ages of 25 and 44, while 25% are between 45 and 64, and 19% are between 0 and 17. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 10% and 13% respectively.

As of 2019, the median household income in Community District 12 was $42,000, compared to $73,000 in Manhattan and $53,000 in the entire city. In 2019, an estimated 25% of Community District 12 residents lived in poverty, compared to 18% in all of Manhattan and 21% in all of New York City. One in eight residents (12%) were unemployed, compared to 7% in Manhattan and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 53% in Community District 12, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 45% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Community District 12 is considered to be gentrifying: according to the Community Health Profile, the district was low-income in 1990 and has seen above-median rent growth up to 2010.

===Trends===
The residents of Inwood were substantially of Irish descent for much of the 20th century. The neighborhood exhibited a strong Irish identity with many Irish shops, pubs, and even a Gaelic football field in Inwood Hill Park. The second-largest group during this time was Jewish, an extension of the large Jewish population of Washington Heights. However, in the 1960s through the 1980s, many Irish and Jewish residents moved out to adjoining areas in other boroughs of New York City (such as the Riverdale and Spuyten Duyvil sections of the Bronx) and the suburbs (including communities in nearby Bergen County, New Jersey; Westchester County, New York; and Rockland County, New York) in a pattern consistent with overall trends in the city at that time. During the same period, there was a rise in the number of Dominican immigrants to the area.

Today, Inwood has a predominantly Dominican population, especially in the areas east of Broadway; it has the highest concentration of residents of Dominican descent in New York City. Hispanic residents make up 74 percent of Inwood&#x27;s population as a whole, according to census data. Nearly half of the residents were born outside the US.

==Land use and terrain==
===Geography===

Inwood is physically bounded by the Harlem River to the north and east, and the Hudson River to the west. It extends southward to Fort Tryon Park and alternatively Dyckman Street or Fairview Avenue farther south, depending on the source.

While Inwood is the northernmost neighborhood on the &quot;island&quot; of Manhattan, it is not the northernmost neighborhood of the entire &quot;borough&quot; of Manhattan. That distinction is held by Marble Hill, a neighborhood situated just north of Inwood, on what is properly the North American mainland bordering the Bronx. Marble Hill was isolated from Inwood and the rest of Manhattan in 1895 when the route of the Harlem River was altered by the construction of the Harlem River Ship Canal.

===Geology===
Inwood marble, a soft, white, metamorphic rock found in northern Manhattan, takes its name after the neighborhood. From the mid-17th to the late 18th century, commercial quarries dotted the area as the material was used for building construction. However, due to its susceptibility to erosion, builders eventually used alternate construction materials. Inwood marble was quarried for government buildings in lower Manhattan and Washington, D.C. Small pieces of marble can still be seen in the stone retaining walls around Isham Park.

The development of Inwood in the early 20th century resulted in the demolition of many rock outcroppings. However, several outcroppings still exist, including on Cooper Street between 204th and 207th Streets; at Broadway and West 216th Street; and in the garden of Holy Trinity Episcopal Church at Seaman Avenue and Cumming Street. The rock on Cooper Street contains a garden maintained by a nearby housing cooperative at 60 Cooper Street, which owns half of the rock.

The seismologically active Dyckman Street Fault runs east-west beneath the Dyckman Valley. As recently as 1989, activity of this fault caused a magnitude 2 earthquake.

===Land use===
Commercial retail uses are mainly located along Broadway, Dyckman Street and West 207th Street. In recent years Dyckman Street west of Broadway has become a popular entertainment district with many restaurants and lounges. Offices are typically located on second floors over retail, or in the neighborhood&#x27;s sole office building (a converted telephone building) at Broadway and West 215th Street. Inwood also contains one of Manhattan&#x27;s few remaining C-8 zoning districts, which concentrates automotive uses on the northern stretches of Broadway.

Industrial uses, including depots for subway (207th Street Yard), bus (Kingsbridge Bus Depot), and sanitation (Manhattan North), exist primarily along Sherman Creek, an inlet of the Harlem River. The creek and surrounding industrial area is bounded by Dyckman Street to the south, Tenth Avenue to the west, and 207th Street to the north. There has been an initiative among politicians over the last few years to re-zone this area for residential and commercial use, and to create public access to the waterfront. Utility company Consolidated Edison and the City of New York own some of the property in this area.

The major residential land use in Inwood is multifamily five- to eight-story prewar apartment buildings. New construction is rare. Most of the remaining detached and semi-detached houses on Manhattan Island are located in Inwood, nestled between apartment buildings. Adjacent to Sherman Creek is Inwood&#x27;s public housing development, known as the Dyckman Houses and constructed in 1951.

===Real estate===
Inwood&#x27;s real estate rents and values are sharply bifurcated between east and west. According to Manhattan Community Board 12, the districts east of Broadway are predominantly lower-income. This area is also more industrial and commercial and has fewer parks and street trees. Real estate values and rents are correspondingly lower than the area west of Broadway. Almost all of Inwood&#x27;s co-ops and all of the private houses are located on the west side of Broadway. According to one study in 2019, Inwood had the lowest average rents in Manhattan.

In 2015, New York City began soliciting community comments on a major rezoning proposal for Inwood. The New York City Economic Development Corporation proposed to alter the area&#x27;s 50-year-old current zoning plan by dividing Inwood into five sub-districts called &quot;the tip of Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Upland Wedge&quot;, &quot;Upland Core&quot;, &quot;Commercial U&quot; and &quot;Sherman Creek&quot;. Some of these sub-districts would be rezoned to encourage the construction of new commercial space and housing. A resident recalls being told by a city planner, &quot;Don&#x27;t think you can keep this nice neighborhood all to yourselves.&quot; The rezoning proposal has triggered much feedback from the community, including a sleep-in at Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez&#x27;s office. In August 2018, the New York City Council approved a measure to rezone the neighborhood. The rezoning of Inwood allows for the construction of buildings of up to 30 stories in some areas targeted for redevelopment while introducing an 8 story height limit to many existing residential areas. Following the rezoning, over $610 million in real estate was purchased.

The rezoning includes 2,600 units of affordable housing. It was met with pushback from locals, who formed a group called &quot;Northern Manhattan is Not for Sale&quot;. Expressing concerns about gentrification and rezoning, the group sued to halt the rezoning in December 2018. The plaintiffs cited concerns over the city&#x27;s environmental review process, saying the review should have included a racial impact study. The city stated that the review complied with the city&#x27;s legal standards and that a racial impact study was unnecessary. The New York Supreme Court initially ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in December 2019, but it was overturned on appeal in July 2020. In part as a result of the lawsuit, the City Council passed a bill in June 2021, requiring developers to conduct a study of up to two years of potential displacement and gentrification trends and effects before starting a new project.

==Institutions and landmarks==
===Museums and cultural centers===

The area&#x27;s largest cultural attraction is The Cloisters in Fort Tryon Park. This branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art is devoted to Medieval art and culture, and is located in a medieval-style building, portions of which were purchased in Europe, brought to the United States, and reassembled. Its tower dominates the skyline of the area and the museum can be easily accessed via steep pathways leading up from Dyckman Street.

The oldest building in Inwood is the Dyckman House, the oldest farmhouse in Manhattan, on Broadway at 204th Street. It is a New York City designated landmark and operates as a historic house museum.

In 2024, the state allocated $10 million for the Dominican Center for the Arts and Culture. The cultural center and museum is planned to be located on 207th Street.

===Other points of interest===


From Inwood Hill Park, one can view a -tall Columbia &quot;C&quot; painted on the face of a rock cut across the Harlem River on the Bronx shore. This collegiate logo has been in place for approximately a half-century, though it is not clear who exactly maintains the painted letter in the present day. Looking west from Inwood Hill Park across the Hudson River, one can view the New Jersey Palisades. Looking east from Inwood, the former NYU campus in University Heights, Bronx, now Bronx Community College, towers above the east end of the University Heights Bridge.

Bridges spanning Spuyten Duyvil Creek include the Henry Hudson Bridge, the longest fixed arch bridge in the world when built in 1936, and the Spuyten Duyvil Bridge, a railroad swing bridge reconstructed numerous times since originally opening in 1849. Road bridges are the Broadway Bridge and the University Heights Bridge, both important local structures.

Inwood has one small historic district, the Park Terrace West-West 217th Street district, designated in 2018.

A farmers&#x27; market takes place on Isham Street on Saturdays, year-round.

The Seaman-Drake Arch, located on Broadway at 216th Street, is one of only two free-standing arches in Manhattan, the other being the Washington Square Arch. The Seaman-Drake Arch was built in 1855 of local Inwood marble. It is the last remaining structure of the mansion that formerly stood there.

At the North Cove at 207th Street and the Harlem River, both the shoreline and the water just off it have been rehabilitated from their former derelict polluted state by James Cataldi (also known as the &quot;Birdman of Inwood&quot;) into a flourishing wetland teeming with geese, ducks, and other varieties of fowl.

==Parks==

=== NYC Parks facilities ===
Inwood Hill Park, on the Hudson River, is a very large and old-growth forested city park. It is known for its caves that were used by the Lenape before Europeans arrived, and the last salt marsh in Manhattan. Birdwatchers come to the park to see waterbirds, raptors, and a wide variety of migratory birds. The wooded section, consisting mostly of abandoned former summer estates, features the last natural forest standing on Manhattan Island. Tennis courts, three playgrounds, a waterfront promenade and ten miles of hiking trails are also prominent components of the park. The ballfields at 214th Street, surrounded by the land that comprises Inwood Hill Park, are considered to be part of neighboring Isham Park

Isham Park sits roughly between Broadway, Isham Street, Seaman Avenue, and West 214th and 215th Streets. The park once extended to the Harlem River, but after the creation of Inwood Hill Park and the reconfiguration of area streets, the northwest boundary became, for the most part, Seaman Avenue. The extent of the current park now equals that of the original Isham estate. The Isham mansion, which originally came with the park gift, was torn down in the 1940s due to its deteriorating condition.

Other parks in or adjoining Inwood include Sherman Creek Park (Swindler Cove), Fort Washington Park, Fort Tryon Park, and Highbridge Park.

=== Columbia facilities ===
Columbia University&#x27;s athletic fields have been located in Inwood since the 1920s. They are known today as the Baker Athletics Complex, though locals still use the historical name of &quot;Baker Field&quot;. The football stadium within the complex, officially Robert K. Kraft Field at Lawrence A. Wien Stadium, can accommodate 17,000 fans and was noted by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; as &quot;one of the most beautiful places in the country to watch a football game&quot; due to the scenic views of the Henry Hudson Bridge and the New Jersey Palisades from the home stands.

In January 2014, a park called Muscota Marsh opened to the public between Inwood Hill Park and Baker Field as part of an agreement with the city for the development of the Campbell Athletic Center at West 218th Street and Broadway. This waterfront park was built by Columbia and is jointly administered by the city parks department and the university.

The Inwood waterfront is also home to Columbia University&#x27;s Boathouse, the &quot;1929 Boathouse&quot;. It stands next to the &quot;Gould-Remmer Boathouse&quot; which was originally constructed in 1895 as the Gould Boathouse at 116th Street on the Hudson River and was relocated here in 1989. This new structure now houses the Ivy League school&#x27;s Crew team and hosts inter-collegiate rowing competitions. In July 2018, a harbor seal nicknamed &quot;Sealy&quot; started showing up by the structure, garnering media attention.

=== Community gardens ===
The Lt. William Tighe Triangle, aka the Riverside-Inwood Neighborhood Garden (RING), is the northernmost piece of Ft. Tryon Park and lies at the confluence of Riverside Drive, Dyckman Street, Broadway, and Seaman Avenue. It is Inwood&#x27;s oldest community garden, having been founded in 1984. Bruce&#x27;s Garden is another notable community garden, located in the northeast corner of Isham Park.

==Local newspaper==

&quot;Manhattan Times&quot; is a free English/Spanish bilingual community newspaper serving Spanish-speaking areas of Upper Manhattan, including Washington Heights. It was founded in 1999 or 2000 by Luís A. Miranda Jr., Roberto Ramírez Sr., and David Keisman. The newspaper features stories about news and events of interest to residents on the city and neighborhood level, and is funded in part by private advertisements in addition to public service announcements.

==Police and crime==

Inwood is served by the 34th Precinct of the NYPD, located at 4295 Broadway, along with Washington Heights north of 179th Street. The 34th Precinct ranked 23rd safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. , the neighborhood has a non-fatal assault hospitalization rate of 43 per 100,000 people, lower than the citywide rate of 59 per 100,000; however, its incarceration rate of 482 per 100,000 adults is slightly higher than the citywide rate of 425 per 100,000.

In 2020, the 34th Precinct reported 7 murders, 16 rapes, 205 robberies, 213 felony assaults, 226 burglaries, 444 grand larcenies, and 166 grand larcenies auto. Crime in these categories fell by 42.1% between 1998 and 2020.

==Fire safety==
Inwood is served by the New York City Fire Department (FDNY)&#x27;s Engine Company 95/Ladder Company 36/Foam Unit 95, located at 29 Vermilyea Avenue.

<text>Kenneth &quot;Ken&quot; McVay (born  1940), a Canadian-American dual citizen, is an Internet activist against Holocaust denial. He is the founder of the Nizkor Project, one of the first websites against Holocaust denial.

An active participant on the newsgroup &quot;alt.revisionism&quot;, McVay describes himself as a person who found himself moved to action by the efforts of Holocaust deniers on the newsgroup to promote &quot;evidence&quot; that he found to be poorly presented and claims that were vague at best. He also opposed the idea of censoring and suppressing the deniers, as authorities and experts on hate groups often did.

A former active-duty United States Marine and retired service station manager, McVay found that he had an ample amount of spare time to dedicate to researching and transcribing historical documents, so that they could be made available online to counter the arguments of the deniers. In various interviews, he has stated his belief that of the many reasons for the deniers to oppose him and despise him, one of the most frustrating to them is the fact that their arguments have been so thoroughly debunked by a man who is not Jewish and has never professed to be a world-class scholar.

McVay&#x27;s efforts in combatting Holocaust denial with speech and documentation instead of censorship won him praise among many activists, and in 1995 he was awarded the Order of British Columbia by the Province of British Columbia.

<text>Wace ( 1110 – after 1174), sometimes referred to as Robert Wace, was a Medieval Norman poet, who was born in Jersey and brought up in mainland Normandy (he tells us in the &quot;Roman de Rou&quot; that he was taken as a child to Caen), ending his career as Canon of Bayeux.

==Life==
All that is known of Wace&#x27;s life comes from autobiographical references in his poems. He neglected to mention his birthdate; some time between 1099 and 1111 is the most commonly accepted period for his birth.

The name &quot;Wace&quot;, used in Jersey until the 16th century, appears to have been his only name; surnames were not universally used at that time. It was quite a common first name in the Duchy of Normandy, derived from the Indo-European personal name &quot;Wasso&quot;. The spelling and the pronunciation of this name were rendered different ways in the texts, according to the place where the copyists were from. In the various versions of the &quot;Roman de Rou&quot;, his name appears five times as &quot;Wace&quot;, then &quot;Gace&quot; (once), &quot;Vace, Vacce, Vaicce&quot; (three times all together). Until the 11th century, the &quot;w&quot; spelling corresponded to the pronunciation [w] (like in English) in Northern Normandy (including the Channel Islands), but it shifted to [v] in the 12th century. South to an isogloss corresponding more or less to the Joret line, [w] had been turned to [gw] and later [g] (like in common French). Today the name survives as the patronymic surname &quot;Vasse&quot; in Normandy and in the North of France and &quot;Gasse&quot; further south (including also Normandy).

His name is pronounced (rhyming with &#x27;place&#x27;) or (&#x27;waz&#x27;).

It is speculated that he may have been of aristocratic origin, as he was sent to Caen to be educated, which would have been virtually impossible for most. His detailed writing on maritime matters may have stemmed from his island upbringing.

Around 1130 Wace returned to Caen and took ecclesiastical work, possibly as a teacher.

The date of Wace&#x27;s death is uncertain. The most recent event described in the &quot;Roman de Rou&quot; may be dated to 1174. In the &quot;Rou&quot;, Wace also mentions Henry the Young King as living. The latter lived until 1183, which means that Wace probably did not revise the &quot;Rou&quot; after that date.

==Works==
His extant works include the &quot;Roman de Brut&quot;, a verse history of Britain, the &quot;Roman de Rou&quot;, and other works in verse, including the &quot;Lives&quot; of Margaret the Virgin and Saint Nicholas.

===&quot;Roman de Brut&quot;===
&quot;Roman de Brut&quot; (c. 1155) was based on the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; of Geoffrey of Monmouth. It cannot be regarded as a history in any modern sense, although Wace often distinguishes between what he knows and what he does not know, or has been unable to find out. Wace narrates the founding of Britain by Brutus of Troy to the end of the legendary British history created by Geoffrey of Monmouth. The popularity of this work is explained by the new accessibility to a wider public of the Arthur legend in a vernacular language. In the midst of the Arthurian section of the text, Wace was the first to mention the legend of King Arthur&#x27;s Round Table, although on the whole he adds only minor details to Geoffrey&#x27;s text.

The &quot;Roman de Brut&quot; became the basis, in turn, for Layamon&#x27;s &quot;Brut&quot;, an alliterative Middle English poem, and Peter Langtoft&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot;. Historian Matthew Bennett, in an article entitled &quot;Wace and warfare,&quot; has pointed out that Wace clearly had a good understanding of contemporary warfare, and that the details of military operations he invents to flesh out his accounts of pseudo-historical conflicts can therefore be of value in understanding the generalities of warfare in Wace&#x27;s own time.

===&quot;Roman de Rou&quot;===
His later work, the &quot;Roman de Rou&quot;, was, according to Wace, commissioned by Henry II of England. A large part of the &quot;Roman de Rou&quot; is devoted to William the Conqueror and the Norman Conquest of England. Wace&#x27;s reference to oral tradition within his own family suggests that his account of the preparations for the Conquest and of the Battle of Hastings may have been reliant not only on documentary evidence but also on eyewitness testimony from close relations – though no eyewitnesses would have been still alive when he began work on the text. The &quot;Roman de Rou&quot; also includes a mention of the appearance of Halley&#x27;s Comet. The relative lack of popularity of the &quot;Roman de Rou&quot; may reflect the loss of interest in the history of the Duchy of Normandy following the incorporation of continental Normandy into the kingdom of France in 1204.

==Language==

The Romance language Wace wrote in is variously regarded as an Old Norman dialect of the Norman language, a dialect of Old French, or specifically the precursor of Jèrriais. Writers in Jersey have looked on Wace as the founder of Jersey literature, and Jèrriais is sometimes referred to as &quot;the language of Wace&quot; although the poet himself predated the development of Jèrriais as a literary language. Wace is the earliest known Jersey writer.

Although the name Robert has been ascribed to Wace, this is a tradition resting on little evidence. It is generally believed nowadays that Wace only had one name. As a clerc lisant, he was proud of his title of Maistre (master) and is consequently sometimes referred to as Maistre Wace.

There is a granite memorial stone to Wace built into the side of the States Building in Jersey&#x27;s Royal Square. This includes a quote from the &quot;Roman de Rou&quot; that expresses the poet&#x27;s pride in his place of birth:

:&quot;Jo di e dirai ke jo sui&quot;
:&quot;Wace de l’isle de Gersui&quot;

Modern Jèrriais:&lt;br&gt;
:&quot;J&#x27;dis et dithai qu&#x27;jé sis&quot;
:&quot;Wace dé l&#x27;Île dé Jèrri&quot;

Modern French:&lt;br&gt;
:&quot;Je dis et dirai que je suis&quot;
:&quot;Wace de l&#x27;île de Jersey&quot;

English:&lt;br&gt;
:&quot;I say and will say that I am&quot;
:&quot;Wace from the Island of Jersey&quot;

<doc id="141607" wikidata="Q5298233" url="?curid=141607" title="Dorothea Beale">
<text>Dorothea Beale LL.D. (21 March 1831 – 9 November 1906) was a suffragist, educational reformer and author. As Principal of Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College, she became the founder of St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford.

==Early and family life==
Dorothea Beale was born on 21 March 1831 at 41 Bishopsgate Street, London, the fourth child and third daughter of Miles Beale, a surgeon, of a Gloucestershire family who took an active interest in educational and social issues. Her mother, Dorothea Margaret Complin, of Huguenot extraction, would have eleven children. She was first cousin to Caroline Frances Cornwallis, a relationship that influenced the young Dorothea. Educated till the age of 13 partly at home and partly at a school at Stratford, Essex, Dorothea then attended lectures at Gresham College and at the Crosby Hall Literary Institution, and developed an aptitude for mathematics.

In 1847, she and two older sisters began attending Mrs Bray&#x27;s fashionable school for English girls in Paris, where Dorothea remained till the revolution of 1848 closed the school. Dorothea and her sisters then were among the earliest students at the newly opened Queen&#x27;s College, Harley Street, London. Their companions included Frances Buss and Adelaide Procter.

==Career==

In 1849, Dorothea Beale was appointed mathematics tutor at Queen&#x27;s College, London, and in 1854 she became head teacher in the school attached to the college, under Miss Parry. 

In holidays Beale visited schools in Switzerland and Germany. In 1856, for instance, she spent time at the Deaconess&#x27;s Institute of Kaiserswerth, where she made the acquaintance of Elizabeth Ferard. In the same year, Beale anonymously published a small pamphlet in which she promoted the institute. At the end of 1856, she left Queen&#x27;s College, dissatisfied with its administration, and in January 1857 became head of the Clergy Daughters&#x27; School, Casterton, Westmorland (founded in 1823 by William Carus Wilson at Cowan Bridge). There Beale&#x27;s insistence on the need of reforms led to her resignation the following December, although many changes in the management of the school were made the next year. In 1858, Beale established a scholarship for Casterton School students to attend Cheltenham.

While seeking fresh work Beale taught mathematics and Latin at Miss Elwall&#x27;s school at Barnes, and compiled her &quot;Students&#x27; Text-Book of English and General History from B.C. 100 to the Present Time&quot;, for the use of teachers.

On 16 June 1858 Miss Beale was chosen out of 50 candidates to be principal of the Ladies&#x27; College, Cheltenham, the earliest proprietary girls&#x27; school in England. The school had been opened on 13 February 1854 with 82 pupils on a capital of £2,000. Beale spent the rest of her educational career at Cheltenham. When she began as principal, the school had 69 pupils and only £400 of its original capital remained. For the next two years the college struggled. In 1860, the financial arrangements were reorganised, and by 1863 the pupil count had risen to 126. Thenceforward the college&#x27;s survival was assured. In 1873, it moved to buildings of its own, which were enlarged three years later, when the school had 310 pupils. In 1880, the college was incorporated as an independent company, by which time the pupil count had reached 500. Numerous additions were made to the buildings between 1882 and 1905. In 1912, the school comprised over 1,000 pupils and 120 teachers, 14 boarding houses, a secondary and a kindergarten teachers&#x27; training department, a library of over 7,000 volumes, and 15 acres of playing-fields.

As early as 1864, Beale&#x27;s success as a headmistress was acknowledged. In 1865 she gave evidence before the endowed schools inquiry commission, the seven other lady witnesses including Buss and Miss Emily Davies. The evidence, published in 1868, gave an immense impetus to the education of girls in England. In 1869, Beale published, with a preface by herself, the commissioners&#x27; &quot;Reports on the Education of Girls. With Extracts from the Evidence.&quot; It is a remarkable exposure of the low average standard of the teaching in girls&#x27; secondary schools before 1870.

Dorothea Beale saw that the absence of all means of training teachers was a main obstacle to improvement. An endeavour to meet the need was made by a friend at Cheltenham in 1876. Next year, on her friend&#x27;s death, Beale carried on the work. Progress was rapid: the country&#x27;s first residential training college, called St Hilda&#x27;s College, was built in Cheltenham and opened in 1885.
However, to give teachers in training the benefit of a year at Oxford, Beale purchased in 1892 for £5,000, Cowley House, Oxford, which was opened as St Hilda&#x27;s Hall of Residence for Women in 1893, and was in 1901 joined with the Cheltenham training college as St Hilda&#x27;s Incorporated College. The students at St Hilda&#x27;s Hall, Oxford, were mainly, but not exclusively old Cheltonians. A kindergarten class was also started by Beale at Cheltenham in 1876, and a department for the training of kindergarten teachers soon followed, becoming an integral part of the college work.

In 1880, mainly with a view to supplying a link between past and present pupils, Beale founded &quot;The Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College Magazine&quot;, and remained its editor until her death. With the same aim, she established in 1884 &#x27;The Guild of the Ladies&#x27; Cheltenham College,&#x27; which by 1912 numbered 2,500 members. On 26 October 1889, the Guild started in Bethnal Green the Cheltenham Settlement, which continues as St Hilda&#x27;s East Community Centre, a house built by past and present pupils and opened on 26 April 1898. As an earnest churchwoman of high church principles guided through life by deep religious feeling, Beale instituted at Cheltenham in 1884 Quiet Days – devotional meetings for teachers – generally at the end of the summer term, when addresses were given by distinguished churchmen.

Outside her college work Beale associated herself with nearly every effort for educational progress, and with local philanthropic institutions. She was president of the Headmistresses&#x27; Association from 1895 to 1897, and was a member of numerous educational societies. In 1894 she gave evidence before the Royal Commission on Secondary Education, of which James Bryce was chairman. In collaboration with Soulsby and Dove, she embodied her matured views on girls&#x27; education in &quot;Work and Play in Girls&#x27; Schools&quot; (1898). 

Beale identified herself with the movement for women&#x27;s suffrage, being a vice-president of the Kensington Society.

==Final years and legacy==
Beale&#x27;s activities remained unimpaired in her later years, despite deafness and signs of cancer, which became apparent in 1900. On 21 October 1901, the honorary freedom of the Borough of Cheltenham was awarded to her, for her work with the ladies′ college. 

On 11 April 1902, the University of Edinburgh awarded her the honorary degree of LL.D., in recognition of her services to education. Until that time, entomologist Eleanor Anne Ormerod had been the only woman who had received such an honorary degree. Cheltenham&#x27;s staff presented Miss Beale with the academic robes.

Dorothea Beale died after an operation for cancer in a nursing home in Cheltenham on 9 November 1906. The body was cremated at Perry Barr, Birmingham, and the ashes buried in a small vault on the south side of the Lady Chapel of Gloucester Cathedral.

<text>Robert Baldwin Ross (25 May 18695 October 1918) was a British journalist, art critic and art dealer, best known for his relationship with Oscar Wilde, to whom he was a devoted friend, lover and literary executor. A grandson of the Canadian reform leader Robert Baldwin, and son of John Ross and Augusta Elizabeth Baldwin, Ross was a pivotal figure on the London literary and artistic scene from the mid-1890s to his early death, and mentored several literary figures, including Siegfried Sassoon. His open homosexuality, in a period when male homosexual acts were illegal, brought him many hardships.

==Biography==

===Family===
Ross was born in Tours, France. His mother, Elizabeth Baldwin, was the eldest daughter of Robert Baldwin, a Toronto lawyer and politician who in the 1840s, together with his political partner Louis Hippolyte Lafontaine, led Canada to autonomy from Britain. Ross&#x27;s father, John Ross, was a Baldwinite and a Toronto lawyer who had a very successful political career, serving as Solicitor General for Upper Canada, Attorney General, Speaker of the Legislative Council, President of the Legislative Council, director, and, for a time, president, of the Grand Trunk Railway, and Canadian senator. He became Speaker of the Senate in 1869.

Ross was the youngest of five children, with two sisters, Mary and Maria, and two brothers, John and Alexander. The family moved to Tours, France, in 1866 while Elizabeth was pregnant with Maria, who was born in 1867, the year of Canadian Confederation. John fulfilled his duties as senator largely in absentia until he was chosen as Speaker of the Senate in 1869, the year of Robbie&#x27;s birth, making his return to Canada unavoidable. The rest of the family followed in 1870. John died in January 1871 and Elizabeth moved the family to London, England, the following April.

===At Cambridge===
In 1888, Ross was accepted at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he became a victim of bullying, probably because of his sexuality, of which he made no secret, and perhaps also his outspoken journalism in the university paper. Ross caught pneumonia after being dunked in a fountain by other students who had, according to Ross, the full support of Arthur Augustus Tilley, the Junior Tutor of King&#x27;s. After recovering, he fought for an apology from his fellow students, which he received, but he also sought the dismissal of Tilley. The college refused to punish Tilley (though he resigned as Junior Tutor) and Ross dropped out. Soon after that, he chose to &quot;reveal his sexuality&quot; to his parents.

===Oscar Wilde===

Ross found work as a journalist and critic but he did not escape scandal. He is believed to have become Oscar Wilde&#x27;s first male lover in 1886, even before he went to Cambridge. In 1893, a few years before Wilde&#x27;s imprisonment, Ross had a sexual relationship with a boy of sixteen, the son of friends. The boy confessed to his parents that he had engaged in sexual activity with Ross and also admitted to a sexual encounter with Lord Alfred Douglas while he was a guest at Ross&#x27;s house. After a good deal of panic and frantic meetings with solicitors, the parents were persuaded not to go to the police, since at that time their son might be seen as equally guilty and face the possibility of going to prison.

On 1 March 1895, Wilde, Douglas, and Ross approached a solicitor, Charles Octavius Humphreys, with the intention of suing the Marquess of Queensberry, Douglas&#x27;s father, for criminal libel. Humphreys asked Wilde directly whether there was any truth to Queensberry&#x27;s allegations of homosexual activity between Wilde and Douglas, to which Wilde replied “No.” Humphreys applied for a warrant for Queensberry&#x27;s arrest, and approached Sir Edward Clarke and Charles Willie Mathews to represent Wilde. His son, Travers Humphreys, appeared as junior counsel for the prosecution in the subsequent case of &quot;Wilde v Queensberry&quot;.

The libel hearings unearthed evidence that caused Wilde to drop his charges and led to an arrest warrant for him on charges of sodomy and gross indecency.
Ross found Wilde at the Cadogan Hotel, in Knightsbridge, with Reginald Turner. Both men advised Wilde to get a boat-train to France, but he refused. His mother had advised him to stay and fight, and Wilde reportedly said: &quot;The train has gone. It&#x27;s too late.&quot; Following Wilde&#x27;s imprisonment in 1895, Ross went abroad but he returned to offer both financial and emotional support to Wilde during his last years. Ross remained loyal to Wilde and was with him when he died in Paris on 30 November 1900.

===After Oscar Wilde===
Ross became Wilde&#x27;s literary executor, which meant that he had to track down and purchase the rights to all of Wilde&#x27;s texts, which had been sold off along with Wilde&#x27;s possessions when Wilde was declared bankrupt. It also meant fighting the rampant trade in black market copies of his books and, in particular, books, usually erotic, that Wilde did not write, but which were published illegally under his name.

Ross was assisted in this task by Christopher Sclater Millard, who compiled a definitive bibliography of Wilde&#x27;s writings. Ross gave Wilde&#x27;s sons the rights to all their father&#x27;s works along with the money earned from their publication or performance while he was executor. In 1905, he attended the first performances in England of Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot; at the Bijou Theatre. One of the actors was Frederick Stanley Smith (1885–1953) with whom Ross had a relationship.

About 1902, he arranged for the transfer of Wilde&#x27;s remains &quot;from the obscure Bagneux cemetery to Père Lachaise, the most celebrated cemetery in France&quot; and later instructed his heirs to have his own ashes buried in Wilde&#x27;s tomb.

In 1908, some years after Wilde&#x27;s death, Ross produced the definitive edition of his works. Ross was also responsible for commissioning Jacob Epstein to produce the sculpture that can now be seen on Wilde&#x27;s tomb. He even requested that Epstein design a small compartment for Ross&#x27;s own ashes. As a result of his faithfulness to Wilde even in death, Ross was vindictively pursued by Lord Alfred Douglas, who repeatedly attempted to have him arrested and tried for homosexual conduct.

From 1901 to 1908, in personal and professional partnership with the art critic More Adey, Ross managed the Carfax Gallery, a small commercial gallery in London co-founded by John Fothergill and the artist William Rothenstein. The Carfax held exhibitions of works by such artists as Aubrey Beardsley, William Blake, Sylvia Gosse, and John Singer Sargent. After leaving the Carfax, Ross worked as an art critic for &quot;The Morning Post&quot;.

During the First World War, Ross mentored a group of young, mostly homosexual, poets and artists including Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen. He was also a close friend of Wilde&#x27;s sons Vyvyan Holland and Cyril Holland.

In early 1918, during the German spring offensive, Noel Pemberton Billing, a right-wing member of Parliament, published an article entitled &quot;The Cult of the Clitoris&quot; in which he accused members of Ross&#x27;s circle of being among 47,000 homosexuals who were betraying the nation to the Germans. Maud Allan, an actress who had played Wilde&#x27;s Salome in a performance authorised by Ross, was identified as a member of the &quot;cult&quot;. She unsuccessfully sued Billing for libel, causing a national sensation in Britain. The incident brought embarrassing attention to Ross and his associates.

Later, in 1918, Ross was preparing to travel to Melbourne, to open an exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria, when he died suddenly in London on 5 October 1918.

In 1950, on the 50th anniversary of Wilde&#x27;s death, an urn containing Ross&#x27;s ashes was placed into Wilde&#x27;s tomb in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

==Ross&#x27;s work==
Ross was able to rely on an allowance and then an inheritance from his wealthy family, leaving him free to pursue his interests. His main contribution to literature lies in his work, not only as Wilde&#x27;s executor, but also, earlier, as a friendly but critical reader of many of Wilde&#x27;s texts. If Ross is to be believed, he frequently suggested changes and improvements.

Ross also tried his hand as a writer. He provided an introduction to Wilde&#x27;s play &quot;Salome&quot;. His book &quot;Masques and Phases&quot; is a collection of previously published short stories and reviews. As an art critic, Ross was highly critical of the post-impressionist painters.

<doc id="141624" wikidata="Q714416" url="?curid=141624" title="John Lilburne">
<text>John Lilburne (c. 161429 August 1657), also known as Freeborn John, was an English political Leveller before, during and after the English Civil Wars 1642–1650. He coined the term &quot;freeborn rights&quot;, defining them as rights with which every human being is born, as opposed to rights bestowed by government or human law. In his early life he was a Puritan, though towards the end of his life he became a Quaker. His works have been cited in opinions by the United States Supreme Court.

==Early life==
John Lilburne was the son of Richard Lilburne, heir to &quot;a modest manorial holding&quot; at Thickley Punchardon near Bishop Auckland, County Durham, and his wife Margaret (d. 1619), daughter of Thomas Hixon. He was probably born in Sunderland, but the exact date of his birth is unknown; there is some dispute as to whether he was born in 1613, 1614, or 1615. His father, Richard Lilburne, was the last man in England to insist that he should be allowed to settle a legal dispute with a trial by combat until Abraham Thornton did so in 1818. John&#x27;s elder brother Robert Lilburne also later became active in the Parliamentary cause but seems not to have shared John&#x27;s Leveller beliefs. By his own account Lilburne received the first ten years of his education in Newcastle, almost certainly at the Royal Free Grammar School. He also had some schooling in Bishop Auckland.

In the 1630s, he was apprenticed to John Hewson, who introduced him to the Puritan physician John Bastwick, an active pamphleteer against Episcopacy who was prosecuted by Archbishop William Laud. Lilburne&#x27;s connection with Bastwick, whose &quot;Litany&quot; he had a hand in printing, obliged him to flee to the Netherlands.

==&quot;Freeborn John&quot;==
On his return from Holland, Lilburne was arrested (11 December 1637) for printing and circulating unlicensed books, particularly William Prynne&#x27;s &quot;News from Ipswich&quot;, that were not licensed by the Stationers&#x27; Company. At that time all printing presses and publications were required to be licensed, and publishers were liable to the Court of High Commission.

Upon his arrest on information from a Stationers&#x27; Company informant, Lilburne was brought before the Court of Star Chamber. Instead of being charged with an offence, he was asked how he pleaded. In his examinations he refused to take the oath known as the &quot;ex officio&quot; oath (on the grounds that he was not bound to incriminate himself), and thus called into question the court&#x27;s usual procedure. As he persisted in his contumacy, he was sentenced on 13 February 1638 to be fined £500, whipped, pilloried, and imprisoned till he obeyed.

On 18 April 1638, Lilburne was flogged with a three-thonged whip on his bare back, as he was dragged by his hands tied to the rear of an ox cart from Fleet Prison to the pillory at Westminster. He was then forced to stoop in the pillory, where he still managed to campaign against his censors while distributing more unlicensed literature to the crowds. He was then gagged. Finally he was taken back to the court and again imprisoned. During his imprisonment in Fleet he was cruelly treated.

While in prison, however, he managed to write and to get printed in 1638 an account of his own punishment styled &quot;The Work of the Beast&quot;, and in 1639 an apology entitled &quot;Come out of her, my people&quot; for separation from the Church of England.

Upon his release, Lilburne married Elizabeth Dewell (a London merchant&#x27;s daughter) in September 1641. Lilburne&#x27;s agitation continued: the same year he led a group of armed citizens against a group of Royalist officers, who retreated. That was the first in a long series of trials that lasted throughout his life for what John Lilburne called his &quot;freeborn rights&quot;, including the right to hear the accusation, the right to face one&#x27;s accusers, and the right to avoid self-incrimination. As a result of these trials a growing number of supporters began to call him &quot;Freeborn John&quot; and even struck a medal in his honour to that effect. It is this trial that has been cited by constitutional jurists and scholars in the United States of America as being one of the historical foundations of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It is also cited within the 1966 majority opinion of &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot; by the U.S. Supreme Court.

==English Civil War==

In the First English Civil War he enlisted as a captain in Lord Brooke&#x27;s regiment of foot in the Parliamentary army commanded by the Earl of Essex and fought at the Battle of Edgehill. He was a member of the Parliament&#x27;s garrison at Brentford against Prince Rupert during the Battle of Brentford that took place on 12 November 1642 as the Royalists advanced on London and, after trying to escape by jumping in the Thames, was taken as a prisoner to Oxford. The Royalists planned to try Lilburne, as the first prominent Roundhead captured in the war, for high treason. But when Parliament threatened to execute Royalist prisoners in reprisal (see the Declaration of Lex Talionis), Lilburne was exchanged for a Royalist officer.

He then joined the Eastern Association under the command of the Earl of Manchester as a volunteer at the siege of Lincoln, and on 7 October 1643 he was commissioned as a major in Colonel King&#x27;s regiment of foot. On 16 May 1644 he was transferred to Manchester&#x27;s own dragoons with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.

He became friends with Oliver Cromwell, who was second in command, supporting him in his disputes with Manchester. He fought with distinction at the Battle of Marston Moor in 1644. Shortly afterwards he asked permission to attack the Royalist stronghold at Tickhill Castle, because he had heard it was willing to surrender. Manchester refused, dismissing him as a madman. Taking that as a yes, he went and took the castle without a shot being fired.

In April 1645, Lilburne resigned from the army, because he refused to sign the Presbyterian Solemn League and Covenant, on the grounds that the covenant deprived those who might swear it of freedom of religion, namely members of the parliamentary army. Lilburne argued that he had been fighting for this liberty among others. This was practically a treaty between England and Scotland for the preservation of the reformed religion in Scotland, the reformation of religion in England and Ireland &quot;according to the word of God and the example of the best reformed churches&quot;, and the &quot;extirpation of popery [and] prelacy&quot;. The Scots, he maintained, were free to believe as they saw fit but not to bind anyone to the same faith if they did not share it.

The historian C. H. Firth argued Lilburne had gained a great reputation for courage and seems to have been a good officer, but his military career was unlucky. He spent about six months in prison at Oxford, was plundered of all he had at Rupert&#x27;s relief of Newark (22 March 1644), was shot through the arm at the taking of Walton Hall, near Wakefield (3 June 1644), and received very little pay. His arrears when he left the service amounted to £880. He also succeeded in quarrelling, first with Colonel King and then with the Earl of Manchester, both of whom he regarded as lukewarm, incapable and treacherous. He did his best to get King cashiered, and was one of the authors of the charge of high treason against him, which was presented to the House of Commons by some of the committee of Lincoln in August 1644. The dispute with Manchester was due to Lilburne&#x27;s summoning and capturing Tickhill Castle against Manchester&#x27;s orders, and Lilburne was one of Cromwell&#x27;s witnesses in his charge against Manchester.

==Quarrels with William Prynne==

Besides the feuds he had with officers in the army, Lilburne soon engaged in a quarrel with William Prynne. 
On 7 January 1645 he addressed a letter to Prynne, attacking the intolerance of the Presbyterians, and claiming freedom of conscience and freedom of speech for the independents, Prynne, bitterly incensed, procured a vote of the Commons summoning Lilburne before the committee for examinations (17 January 1645). When he appeared (17 May 1645) the committee discharged him with a caution. A second time (18 June 1645) Prynne caused Lilburne to be brought before the same committee, on a charge of publishing unlicensed pamphlets, but he was again dismissed unpunished. Prynne vented his malice in a couple of pamphlets: &quot;A Fresh Discovery of prodigious Wandering: Stars and Firebrands&quot;, and &quot;The Liar Confounded&quot;, to which Lilburne replied in &quot;Innocency and Truth Justified&quot; (1645). Dr. John Bastwick took a minor part in the same controversy.

==Agitation==
Lilburne then began in earnest his campaign of agitation for freeborn rights, the rights that all Englishmen are born with, which are different from privileges bestowed by a monarch or a government. He also advocated extended suffrage, equality before the law, and religious tolerance. His enemies branded him as a Leveller but Lilburne responded that he was a &quot;Leveller so-called&quot;. To him it was a pejorative label which he did not like. He called his supporters &quot;Agitators&quot;. It was feared that &quot;Levellers&quot; wanted to level property rights, but Lilburne wanted to level human basic rights which he called &quot;freeborn rights&quot;.

At the same time that Lilburne began his campaign, another group led by Gerrard Winstanley styling themselves &quot;True Levellers&quot; (that became known as Diggers), advocated equality in property as well as political rights.

Some recent scholarship suggests that Lilburne&#x27;s role in the development of radical ideas may be more nuanced than traditionally thought. While Lilburne is often credited with originating key concepts, research by David Como indicates that ideas like the Norman yoke and the supremacy of the House of Commons were already circulating in radical circles before Lilburne began publishing on them. As Como argues, &quot;...celebrated print propagandists were merely collating, synthesizing, and subtly reshaping ideas, programs, and assumptions which they knew from experience were widely shared in the radical parliamentarian circles they occupied.&quot; This suggests that Lilburne&#x27;s contribution lay in systematizing and disseminating these ideas through his prolific pamphlet writing, exemplified by works like &quot;The Free Man&#x27;s Freedom Vindicated&quot;.

==Putney Debates==
Lilburne was imprisoned from July to October 1645 for denouncing Members of Parliament who lived in comfort while the common soldiers fought and died for the Parliamentary cause. It was while he was incarcerated that he wrote his tract, &quot;England&#x27;s Birthright Justified&quot;.

In July 1646, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London for denouncing his former commander the Earl of Manchester as a traitor and Royalist sympathiser. It was the campaign to free him from prison which spawned the political party called the Levellers. Lilburne called them &quot;Levellers so-called&quot; because he viewed himself as an agitator for freeborn rights.

The Levellers had a strong following in the New Model Army with whom his work was influential. When the army held the Putney Debates between 28 October and 11 November 1647, the debate centred upon a pamphlet influenced by the writings of Lilburne called &quot;An Agreement of the People for a firm and present peace upon grounds of common right&quot;.

==Written constitution==
Lilburne was instrumental in the writing of two more editions of this famous document. The second, &quot;An Agreement of the People of England, and the places therewith incorporated, for a secure and present peace, upon grounds of common right, freedom and safety&quot;, was presented to Parliament on 11 September 1648 after amassing signatories including about a third of all Londoners.

Following the defeat of the Royalists and the abolition of the monarchy and House of Lords, England became a commonwealth in 1649 with the regicide of Charles I. It was while he was in the Tower of London that Lilburne, William Walwyn, Thomas Prince and Richard Overton wrote the third edition of &quot;An Agreement of the Free People of England. Tendered as a Peace-Offering to this distressed Nation&quot;. They hoped that this document would be signed like a referendum so that it would become a written constitution for the Commonwealth of England. The United States Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, who often cited the works of Lilburne in his opinions, wrote in an entry for &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; that he believed Lilburne&#x27;s constitutional work of 1649 was the basis for the basic rights contained in the US Constitution and Bill of Rights.

==On trial for high treason==
When Hugh Peters visited Lilburne in the Tower on 25 May 1649, Lilburne told him that he would rather have had seven years under the late king&#x27;s rule than one under the present regime, and that in his opinion if the current regime remained as tyrannical as it was, then people would be prepared to fight for &quot;Prince Charles&quot;. Three months later in &quot;Outcry of the Apprentices to the Soldiers&quot; Lilburne stated that apprentices and soldiers fought to maintain the fundamental constitution of the Commonwealth and rights of the people in their Parliaments by regulating the Crown not against the person of the King.
There had been rumours after the Broadway meeting of January 1648, that Levellers were conspiring with Royalists to overthrow the new republic. During the Oxford mutiny this was confirmed when Parliament acquired a letter from a Royalist prisoner in the Tower of London to Lord Cottington, an advisor in exile with Charles II in France, which suggested that the Royalists should finance the Levellers, as a method by which Charles could be restored to the throne. Armed with this evidence parliament published a long declaration against the Levellers and passed a motion to try Lilburne for high treason, using a court similar to that which had tried Charles I. As in the trial of the King, sentence would be passed by appointed commissioners (forty for Lilburne&#x27;s trial), but unlike in the case of the King (who had no peers) a jury of 12 would decide Lilburne&#x27;s guilt or innocence. The trial took place in the London Guildhall. It started on 24 October 1649, and lasted two days. When the jury found him not guilty, the public shouted their approval so loudly and for so long that it was another half hour before the proceedings could be formally closed.

Lilburne was not released immediately and was held for a further two weeks before pressure from the populace and some friends in Parliament finally secured his release. Although some members of parliament were irked at Lilburne&#x27;s release, Parliament had succeeded in suppressing open Leveller dissent. The Levellers gave up all attempts to rouse the country and army to open rebellion, and started to conspire ineffectually in secret.

==1649–1651==
So far as politics was concerned, Lilburne for the next two years remained quiet. He was elected on 21 December 1649 a common councilman for the city of London, but on the 26th his election was declared void by Parliament, although he had taken the required oath to be faithful to the commonwealth. No disposition, however, was shown to prosecute him. On 22 December 1648 he had obtained an ordinance granting him £3,000, in compensation for his sufferings from the Star Chamber, the money being made payable from the forfeited estates of various Royalists in the county of Durham. As this source had proved insufficient, Lilburne, by the aid of Marten and Cromwell, obtained another ordinance (30 July 1650), charging the remainder of the sum on confiscated chapter-lands, and thus became owner of some of the lands of the Durham chapter.

Ever since 1644, when he found himself prevented by the monopoly of the merchant adventurers from entering the cloth trade, Lilburne had advocated the release of trade from the restrictions of chartered companies and monopolists. He now took up the case of the soap-makers, and wrote petitions for them demanding the abolition of the excise on soap, and apparently became a soap manufacturer himself. The tenants of the manor of Epworth held themselves wronged by enclosures which had taken place under the schemes for draining Hatfield Chase and the Isle of Axholme. Lilburne took up their cause, assisted by his friend, John Wildman, and headed a riot (19 October 1650), by means of which the commoners sought to obtain possession of the disputed lands. His zeal was not entirely disinterested, as he was to have two thousand acres for himself and Wildman if the claimants succeeded. John Morris, &quot;alias&quot; Poyntz, complained of being swindled out of some properties by potent enemies, with the assistance of John Browne, late clerk to the House of Lords. Lilburne, who had exerted himself on behalf of Morris as far back as 1648, now actively took up his cause again.

Much more serious in its consequences was Lilburne&#x27;s adoption of the quarrel of his uncle, George Lilburne, with Sir Arthur Hesilrige. In 1649, Lilburne had published a violent attack on Hesilrige, whom he accused of obstructing the payment of the money granted him by the parliamentary ordinance of 28 December 1648. George Lilburne&#x27;s quarrel with Hesilrige was caused by a dispute about the possession of certain collieries in Durham—also originally the property of Royalist delinquents— from which he had been ejected by Hesilrige in 1649. In 1651 the committee for compounding delinquents&#x27; estates had confirmed Hesilrige&#x27;s decision. John Lilburne intervened with a violent attack on Hesilrige and the committee, terming them &quot;unjust and unworthy men, fit to be spewed out of all human society, and deserving worse than to be hanged&quot;. He next joined with Josiah Primat—the person from whom George Lilburne asserted that he had bought the collieries—and presented to parliament, on 23 December 1651, a petition repeating; and specifying the charges against Hesilrige. Parliament thereupon appointed a committee of fifty members to examine witnesses and documents; who reported on 16 Jan. 1652, that the petition was &quot;false, malicious, and scandalous&quot;. Lilburne was sentenced to pay a fine of £3,000 to the state, damages of £2,000 to Hesilrige, and £500 apiece to four members of the Committee for Compounding with Delinquents.

In addition John Lilburne was sentenced to be banished for life, and an Act of Parliament for that purpose was passed on 30 January 1652.

Lilburne spent his exile in the Netherlands at Bruges and elsewhere, where he published a vindication of himself, and an attack on the government. In his hostility to the army leaders Lilburne had often contrasted the present governors unfavourably with Charles I. Now he frequented the society of cavaliers of note, such Lords Hopton, Colepeper and Percy. If he were furnished with ten thousand pounds, he undertook to overthrow Cromwell, the Parliament, and the Council of State, within six months. &quot;I know not&quot;, he was heard to say, &quot;why I should not vye with Cromwell, since I had once as great a power as he had, and greater too, and am as good a gentleman&quot;. But with the exception of the Duke of Buckingham, none of the royalists placed any confidence in him.

==Return, trial and imprisonment==
The news of the expulsion of the Rump in April 1653 excited Lilburne&#x27;s hopes of returning to England. Counting on Cromwell&#x27;s placid disposition, he boldly applied to him for a pass to return to England, and, when it was not granted, came over without one on 14 June. The government at once arrested him, and lodged him in Newgate, whence he continued to importune Cromwell for his protection, and to promise to live quietly if he might stay in England. His trial began at the Old Bailey on 13 July, and concluded with his acquittal on 20 August. As usual Lilburne contested every step with the greatest pertinacity. &quot;He performed the great feat which no one else ever achieved, of extorting from the court a copy of his indictment, in order that he might put it before counsel, and be instructed as to the objections he might take against it&quot;. Throughout the trial popular sympathy was on his side. Petitions on his behalf were presented to parliament, so strongly worded that the petitioners were committed to prison. Crowds flocked to see him tried; threats of a rescue were freely uttered; and tickets were circulated with the legend:
The government filled London with troops, but in spite of their officers, the soldiers shouted and sounded their trumpets when they heard that Lilburne was acquitted. Such was his popularity that two medals were struck in celebration of his acquittal. The government, however, declined to leave Lilburne at large. The jurymen were summoned before the Council of State, and the Council of State was ordered to secure Lilburne. On 28 August he was transferred from Newgate Prison to the Tower of London, and the Lieutenant of the Tower was instructed by parliament to refuse obedience to any writ of habeas corpus. On 16 March 1654, the Council ordered that he should be removed to Mont Orgueil Castle, Jersey. Colonel Robert Gibbon, the governor, complained that he gave more trouble than ten cavaliers.

The Protector offered Lilburne his liberty if he declined to act against the government, but he answered that he would own no way for his liberty but the way of the law. Lilburne&#x27;s health suffered from his confinement, and in 1654 his death was reported and described. His wife and father petitioned for his release, and in October 1655 he was brought back to England and lodged in Dover Castle.

==Quakerism and death==
In 1656, he was allowed to leave Dover Castle during the daytime to visit his wife and children, who had settled in Dover. It was here that Lilburne met Luke Howard, a Quaker whose serenity impressed him and began the process of his own conversion. Lilburne declared himself a convert to the tenets of the Quakers, and announced his conversion in a letter to his wife. General Fleetwood showed a copy of this letter to the Protector, who was at first inclined to regard it merely as a politic device to escape imprisonment. When Cromwell was convinced that Lilburne really intended to live peaceably, he released him on parole from prison, and seems to have continued till his death the pension of 40&quot;s&quot;. a week allowed him for his maintenance during his imprisonment. Later he was permitted to stay away from prison for several days at a time and took to visiting Quaker congregations in Kent.

In the summer of 1657, while visiting his wife, who was expecting their tenth child, Lilburne died at Eltham 29 August 1657, and was buried at Moorfields, &quot;in the new churchyard adjoining to Bedlam&quot;.

On 21 January 1659 Elizabeth Lilburne petitioned Richard Cromwell for the discharge of the fine imposed on her husband by the act of 30 Jan. 1652, and her request was granted. Parliament on a similar petition recommended the repealing of the act, and the recommendation was carried by the restored Long Parliament on 15 August 1659.

==Family==
Lilburne married Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Dewell. During his imprisonment in 1649 he lost two sons, but a daughter and other children survived him.

==Importance==
Charles Harding Firth, writing in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, considered Lilburne&#x27;s political importance easy to explain: In a revolution where others argued about the respective rights of King and Parliament, he spoke always of the rights of the people. His dauntless courage and his powers of speech made him the idol of the people. With Coke&#x27;s &quot;Institutes&quot; in his hand he was willing to tackle any tribunal. He was ready to assail any abuse at any cost to himself, but his passionate egotism made him a dangerous champion, and he continually sacrificed public causes to personal resentments. It would be unjust to deny that he had a real sympathy with sufferers from oppression or misfortune; even when he was himself an exile he could interest himself in the distresses of English prisoners of war, and exert the remains of his influence to get them relieved. In his controversies he was credulous, careless about the truth of his charges, and insatiably vindictive. He attacked in turn all constituted authorities—lords, commons, council of state, and council of officers—and quarrelsome though he was, it is fair to note that he never fell out with his closer comrades, Walwyn and Overton. A life of Lilburne published in 1657 supplies this epitaph:
==Images==
There are the following contemporary portraits of Lilburne:
# an oval, by G. Glover, prefixed to &#x27;The Christian Man&#x27;s Trial.&#x27; 1641.
# the same portrait republished in 1646, with prison bars across the face to represent Lilburne&#x27;s imprisonment.
# a full-length representing Lilburne&#x27; pleading at the bar with Coke&#x27;s &#x27;Institutes&#x27; in his hand; prefixed to &#x27;The Trial of Lieut.-col. John Lilburne, by Theodorus Varax,&#x27; 1649.

==Bibliography==
A bibliographical list of Lilburne&#x27;s pamphlets compiled by Edward Peacock is printed in &quot;Notes and Queries&quot; for 1898. Most of them contain autobiographical matter.

==Fictional portrayal==
Lilburne was portrayed by Tom Goodman-Hill in the 2008 television drama &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Whore&quot;. In this fictional work, Lilburne is shown to have died in prison while being visited by his wife, Elizabeth. He was also played by Michael Pennington in the 1981 television play &quot;A Last Visitor for Mr. Hugh Peter&quot;, and by Gerald Kyd in the 2012 premiere of the play &quot;55 Days&quot;.

Lt-Colonel John Lilburne has a regiment in his honour in the Sealed Knot Society (which re-enacts historical battles).

In 1997 the singer-songwriter Rev Hammer released a concept album called &quot;Freeborn John&quot; telling John Lilburne&#x27;s story. The album featured musical and vocal contributions from Maddy Prior, Rose Kemp, Eddi Reader, Rory McLeod, members of Levellers, and Justin Sullivan alongside other members of New Model Army.

<doc id="141628" wikidata="Q3307150" url="?curid=141628" title="Moral universalism">
<text>Moral universalism (also called moral objectivism) is the meta-ethical position that some system of ethics, or a universal ethic, applies universally, that is, for &quot;all similarly situated individuals&quot;, regardless of culture, race, sex, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other distinguishing feature. Moral universalism is opposed to moral nihilism and moral relativism. However, not all forms of moral universalism are absolutist, nor are they necessarily value monist; many forms of universalism, such as utilitarianism, are non-absolutist, and some forms, such as that of Isaiah Berlin, may be value pluralist.

In addition to the theories of moral realism, moral universalism includes other cognitivist moral theories, such as the subjectivist ideal observer theory and divine command theory, and also the non-cognitivist moral theory of universal prescriptivism.

==Overview==
According to philosophy professor R. W. Hepburn: &quot;To move towards the objectivist pole is to argue that moral judgements can be rationally defensible, true or false, that there are rational procedural tests for identifying morally impermissible actions, or that moral values exist independently of the feeling-states of individuals at particular times.&quot;

Linguist and political theorist Noam Chomsky states: &quot;if we adopt the principle of universality: if an action is right (or wrong) for others, it is right (or wrong) for us. Those who do not rise to the minimal moral level of applying to themselves the standards they apply to others—more stringent ones, in fact—plainly cannot be taken seriously when they speak of appropriateness of response; or of right and wrong, good and evil.&quot;

==History==
An early example of moral universalism can be found in Judaism: the Seven Laws of Noah (, &quot;Sheva Mitzvot B&#x27;nei Noach&quot;), a set of imperatives which, according to the Talmud, were given by God as a binding set of universal moral laws for the &quot;sons of Noah&quot; – that is, all of humanity. The Seven Laws of Noah include prohibitions against worshipping idols, cursing God, murder, adultery, bestiality, sexual immorality, theft, eating flesh torn from a living animal, as well as the obligation to establish courts of justice. The Jewish sages expanded the concept of universal morality within the Seven Laws of Noah and added several other laws beyond the seven listed in the Talmud and Tosefta, such as prohibitions against committing incest, cruelty to animals, pairing animals of different species, grafting trees of different kinds, castration, emasculation, homosexuality, pederasty, and sorcery among others, with some of the sages going so far as to make a list of 30 laws. The Talmud expands the scope of the Seven Laws of Noah to cover about 100 of the 613 Jewish commandments.

The United Nations&#x27; Universal Declaration of Human Rights can be read as assuming characteristics and attributes akin to moral universalism. The drafting committee of the Universal Declaration did assume, or at least aspired to, a &quot;universal&quot; approach to articulating international human rights. Although the Declaration has undeniably come to be accepted throughout the world as a cornerstone of the international system for the protection of human rights, a belief among some that the Universal Declaration does not adequately reflect certain important worldviews has given rise to more than one supplementary declaration, such as the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam and the Bangkok Declaration.

Global environmental treaties may also assume and present a moral universalism. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is founded upon the &quot;common heritage of mankind&quot;. Protecting this heritage is presented in the treaty as a shared moral duty requiring protective actions based on &quot;common but differentiated responsibilities&quot;. This has been criticized as anthropocentric and state-centric but it does assert universal goals.

=== Attempts to define a universal morality ===
In his &quot;Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals&quot; (1785), Immanuel Kant attempts to derive a supreme principle of morality that binds all rational agents. 

Similarly, divine command theory presents a form of universalism, by way of the unconditional morality of God&#x27;s commandments. It revolves around the idea that morality is synonymous with following God&#x27;s commands. While various religions may have Gods that endorse different beliefs and behaviors, divine command theory encompasses all instances of a deity dictating a society&#x27;s morals. Plato&#x27;s &quot;Euthyphro dilemma&quot; is a dialogue written to point out the inconsistencies of this philosophy.

== Modern studies and measurement ==
There is a body of work studying moral universalism using experimental and survey data in Economics, recently reinvigorated by Harvard Economist Ben Enke. The body broadly attempts to describe correlates with universalist preferences and to study the moral origins of political preferences or polarization. These efforts can be attributed as loosely inspired by the work of social psychologist, Jonathan Haidt, and his Moral Foundations Theory. 

The Moral Foundations theory, developed by Jonathan Haidt and colleagues, proposes that there are “intuitive ethics,” or morals that individuals subscribe to within cultures. There are five foundations that a person&#x27;s behaviors tend to adhere to: care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and sanctity/degradation. Haidt argues that these morals are cross-cultural, and alignment with them is present at birth. Of note, the Moral Foundations Theory does not assert that every culture has the same morals, but rather each has developed their own set of acceptable behaviors, and there tends to be overlaps in the aforementioned areas listed earlier.

=== Universalism and politics ===
Measurement regarding universalism and politics typically seeks to explain political divides from the moral &quot;origins&quot; of their supporters. Enke et al. have published a number of studies, including their canonical study, where they find that heterogeneity in universalism descriptively explains why the left and right both simultaneously support and oppose different types of government spending. They find that you can explain the left-right divide on topics such as redistribution through the level and quality of universalism in their respective politics (e.g., redistribution to US veterans, which is more morally loyalist, compared to redistribution via foreign aid). They find the political left to be broadly more universalistic. Haidt too has written about how his (broader) Moral Foundations theory can be applied to modern US politics.

The idea of a universal basic income has also been put forward within politics.

=== Determinants of universalism ===
Enke and his coauthors also find that universalism is significantly related to observables: older people, men, the rich, the rural, and the religious exhibit less moral universalism. Moreover, universalists donate less money but to more global recipients. Behaviorally, universalists have fewer friends, spend less time with them, and feel more lonely.

These studies also allow us to compare the prevalence of universalism across countries and cultures. A large, cross-country survey study finds that socioeconomic experiences determine levels of universalism, with experience of democracy greatly helping. Anthropologists at the University of Oxford published a study in 2019 examining 60 different cultures and their principles. This study was conducted by reviewing ethnographic content from each culture. Seven fundamentals were identified beforehand, and historic writings were analyzed to search for either positive or negative moral valence of each one. It was found that 99.9% of the time, these seven behaviors were considered “moral”: helping kin, helping group, reciprocating, being brave, respecting superiors, dividing resources, and respecting property. These principles appeared across all cultures studied, and only one counterexample was found: an instance of the “respecting property” value clashing with “being brave.”

<text>Gerald Raphael Finzi (14 July 1901 – 27 September 1956) was a British composer. Finzi is best known as a choral composer, but also wrote in other genres. Large-scale compositions by Finzi include the cantata &quot;Dies natalis&quot; for solo voice and string orchestra, and his concertos for cello and clarinet.

==Life==

Gerald Finzi was born in London, the son of John Abraham (Jack) Finzi and Eliza Emma (Lizzie) Leverson. Finzi became one of the most characteristically English composers of his generation. Despite his being an agnostic of Jewish descent, several of his choral works incorporate Christian texts.

Finzi&#x27;s father, a successful shipbroker, died a fortnight before his son&#x27;s eighth birthday. Finzi was educated privately. During World War I the family settled in Harrogate, and Finzi began to study music at Christ Church, High Harrogate, under Ernest Farrar from 1915. Farrar, a former pupil of Charles Villiers Stanford, was then aged thirty and he described Finzi as &quot;very shy, but full of poetry&quot;. Finzi found him a sympathetic teacher, and Farrar&#x27;s death on the Western Front affected him deeply. 

During those formative years, Finzi also suffered the loss of all three of his brothers, adversities that contributed to Finzi&#x27;s bleak outlook on life. He found solace in the poetry of Thomas Traherne and his favourite, Thomas Hardy, whose poems, as well as those by Christina Rossetti, he began to set to music. In the poetry of Hardy, Traherne, and later William Wordsworth, Finzi was attracted by the recurrent motif of the innocence of childhood corrupted by adult experience. From the very beginning most of his music was elegiac in tone.

Finzi was, at one time, a vegetarian but gave it up and favoured eggs, fish and sometimes bacon or chicken.

===1918–33: Studies and early compositions===
After Farrar&#x27;s death, Finzi studied privately at York Minster with the organist and choirmaster Edward Bairstow, a strict teacher compared with Farrar. In 1922, after five years of study with Bairstow, Finzi moved to Painswick in Gloucestershire, where he began composing in earnest. His first Hardy settings, and the orchestral piece &quot;A Severn Rhapsody&quot;, were soon performed in London to favourable reviews.

In 1925, at the suggestion of Adrian Boult, Finzi took a course in counterpoint with R. O. Morris and then moved to London, where he became friendly with Howard Ferguson and Edmund Rubbra. He was also introduced to Gustav Holst, Arthur Bliss and Ralph Vaughan Williams. Vaughan Williams obtained a teaching post (1930–1933) for him at the Royal Academy of Music.

===1933–39: Musical development===
Finzi never felt at home in London and, having married the artist Joyce Black, settled with her in Aldbourne, Wiltshire, where he devoted himself to composing and apple-growing, saving a number of rare English apple varieties from extinction. He also amassed a large library of some 3,000 volumes of English poetry, philosophy and literature, which is now kept at the University of Reading. His collection of about 700 volumes of 18th-century English music, including books, manuscripts and printed scores, is now held by the University of St Andrews.

During the 1930s, Finzi composed only a few works, but it was in them, notably the cantata &quot;Dies natalis&quot; (1939) to texts by Thomas Traherne, that his fully mature style developed. He also worked on behalf of the poet-composer Ivor Gurney, who had been committed to a mental hospital. Finzi and his wife catalogued and edited Gurney&#x27;s works for publication. They also studied and published English folk music and music by older English composers such as William Boyce, Capel Bond, John Garth, Richard Mudge, John Stanley and Charles Wesley.

In 1939, the Finzis moved to Ashmansworth in Hampshire, where he founded the Newbury String Players, an amateur chamber orchestra that he conducted until his death, reviving 18th-century string music, as well as giving premieres of works by his contemporaries and offering talented young musicians such as Julian Bream and Kenneth Leighton the chance to perform.

===1939–56: Growth of reputation===
The outbreak of World War II delayed the first performance of &quot;Dies natalis&quot; at the Three Choirs Festival, an event that could have established Finzi as a major composer. He was directed to work at the Ministry of War Transport and lodged German and Czech refugees in his home. After the war, he became somewhat more productive than before, writing several choral works as well as the Clarinet Concerto (1949), perhaps his most popular work today.

By then, Finzi&#x27;s works were being performed frequently at the Three Choirs Festival and elsewhere. But that happiness was not to last. In 1951, he learned that he was suffering from the then incurable Hodgkin&#x27;s disease and had ten years to live, at most. His feelings after that revelation are probably reflected in the agonized first movement of his Cello Concerto (1955), Finzi&#x27;s last major work. However its second movement, originally intended as a musical portrait of his wife, is more serene.

In 1956, following an excursion near Gloucester with Vaughan Williams, Finzi developed shingles, probably as a result of immune suppression caused by Hodgkin&#x27;s disease. Biographies refer to him subsequently developing chickenpox, which developed into a &quot;severe brain inflammation&quot;. That probably means that his shingles developed into disseminated shingles, which resembles chickenpox, and was complicated by encephalitis. He died soon afterwards, aged 55, in the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, the first performance of his Cello Concerto having been given on the radio the night before. His ashes were scattered on May Hill near Gloucester in 1973.

==Works==
Finzi’s output includes nine song cycles, six of them on the poems of Thomas Hardy. The first of these, &quot;By Footpath and Stile&quot; (1922), is for voice and string quartet; the others, including &quot;A Young Man’s Exhortation&quot; and &quot;Earth and Air and Rain&quot;, for voice and piano. Among his other songs, the settings of Shakespeare poems in the cycle &quot;Let Us Garlands Bring&quot; (1942) are the best known. He also wrote incidental music to Shakespeare’s &quot;Love’s Labour’s Lost&quot; (1946). For voice and orchestra he composed the above-mentioned &quot;Dies natalis&quot;, and the pacifist &quot;Farewell to Arms&quot; (1944).

Finzi’s choral music includes the popular anthems &quot;Lo, the full, final sacrifice&quot; and &quot;God is gone up&quot; as well as unaccompanied partsongs, but he also wrote larger-scale choral works such as &quot;For St. Cecilia&quot; (text by Edmund Blunden), &quot;Intimations of Immortality&quot; (William Wordsworth) and the Christmas scene &quot;In terra pax&quot; (Robert Bridges and the Gospel of Luke), all from the last ten years of his life.

The number of Finzi’s purely instrumental works is small even though he took great pains over them in the early part of his career. He began what is believed to have been intended as a piano concerto. This was never finished or given a title, but after his death his publisher gave two of the individual movements names and published them as the separate works &quot;Eclogue&quot; and &quot;Grand Fantasia and Toccata&quot;. The latter demonstrates Finzi’s admiration for Johann Sebastian Bach as well as the Swiss-American composer Ernest Bloch. He also completed a violin concerto which was performed in London under the baton of Vaughan Williams, but was not satisfied with it and withdrew the two outer movements; the surviving middle movement is called &quot;Introit&quot;. This concerto thus received only its second performance in 1999 and its first recording is now on Chandos. Finzi&#x27;s Clarinet Concerto and his Cello Concerto are possibly his most famous and frequently performed instrumental works, with recordings of these works done by clarinetist John Denman and a young Yo-Yo Ma.

Of Finzi&#x27;s few chamber works, only the &quot;Five Bagatelles&quot; for clarinet and piano, published in 1945, have survived in the regular repertoire. The Prelude and Fugue for string trio (1938) is his only piece for string chamber ensemble. It was written as a tribute to R O Morris, and shares the austere and melancholy mood of his teacher&#x27;s music.

Finzi had a long-standing friendship with the composer Howard Ferguson who, as well as offering advice on his works during his life, helped with the editing of several of Finzi&#x27;s posthumous works.

==Legacy==
Finzi&#x27;s elder son, Christopher, became a conductor and exponent of his father&#x27;s music. Finzi&#x27;s younger son Nigel was a violinist, and worked closely with their mother in promoting his father&#x27;s music.
