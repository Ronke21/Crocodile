<text>A yeshiva (; ; pl. , or ) is a traditional Jewish educational institution focused on the study of Rabbinic literature, primarily the Talmud and halacha (Jewish law), while Torah and Jewish philosophy are studied in parallel. The studying is usually done through daily &quot;shiurim&quot; (lectures or classes) as well as in study pairs called &quot;chavrusas&quot; (Aramaic for &#x27;friendship&#x27; or &#x27;companionship&#x27;). &quot;Chavrusa&quot;-style learning is one of the unique features of the yeshiva.

In the United States and Israel, different levels of yeshiva education have different names. In the U.S., elementary-school students enroll in a &quot;cheder&quot;, post-bar mitzvah-age students learn in a &quot;mesivta&quot;, and undergraduate-level students learn in a &quot;beit midrash&quot; or &quot;yeshiva gedola&quot; (). In Israel, elementary-school students enroll in a Talmud Torah or &quot;cheder&quot;, post-bar mitzvah-age students learn in a &quot;yeshiva ketana&quot; (), and high-school-age students learn in a &quot;yeshiva gedola&quot;. A &quot;kollel&quot; is a yeshiva for married men, in which it is common to pay a token stipend to its students. Students of Lithuanian and Hasidic &quot;yeshivot gedolot&quot; (plural of &quot;yeshiva gedola&quot;) usually learn in yeshiva until they get married.

Historically, yeshivas were for men only. Today, all non-Orthodox yeshivas are open to women. Although there are separate schools for Orthodox women and girls, (&quot;midrasha&quot; or &quot;seminary&quot;) these do not follow the same structure or curriculum as the traditional yeshiva for boys and men.

==Etymology==
Alternate spellings and names include &quot;yeshivah&quot;; &quot;metivta&quot; and &quot;mesivta&quot; ( &quot;methivta&quot;); &quot;beth midrash&quot;; Talmudical academy, rabbinical academy and rabbinical school. The word &quot;yeshiva&quot; is applied to the activity of learning in class, and hence to a learning &quot;session.&quot;

The transference in meaning of the term from the learning session to the institution itself appears to have occurred by the time of the Talmudic Academies in Babylonia, Sura and Pumbedita, which were known as &quot;shte ha-yeshivot&quot; (the two colleges).

==History==
===Origins===
The Mishnah tractate Megillah contains the law that a town can only be called a &quot;city&quot; if it supports ten men (&quot;batlanim&quot;) to make up the required quorum for communal prayers. Similarly, every beth din (&#x27;house of judgement&#x27;) was attended by a number of pupils up to three times the size of the court (Mishnah, tractate Sanhedrin). According to the Talmud, adults generally took two months off every year to study. These being Elul and Adar the months preceding the pilgrimage festivals of Sukkot and Pesach, called &quot;Yarḥei Kalla&quot; (Aramaic for &#x27;Months of Kallah&#x27;). The rest of the year, they worked.

===Geonic period===

The Geonic period takes its name from &quot;Gaon&quot;, the title given to the heads of the three yeshivas which existed from the third to the thirteenth century. The Geonim acted as the principals of their individual yeshivot, and as spiritual leaders and high judges for the wider communities tied to them. The yeshiva conducted all official business in the name of its Gaon, and all correspondence to or from the yeshiva was addressed directly to the Gaon.

Throughout the Geonic Period there were three yeshivot, each named for the cities in which they were located: Jerusalem, Sura, and Pumbedita; the yeshiva of Jerusalem would later relocate to Cairo, and the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita to Baghdad, but retain their original names. Each Jewish community would associate itself with one of the three yeshivot; Jews living around the Mediterranean typically followed the yeshiva in Jerusalem, while those living in the Arabian Peninsula and modern-day Iraq and Iran typically followed one of the two yeshivot in Baghdad. There was no requirement for this, and each community could choose to associate with any of the yeshivot.

The yeshiva served as the highest educational institution for the Rabbis of this period. In addition to this, the yeshiva wielded great power as the principal body for interpreting Jewish law. The community regarded the Gaon of a yeshiva as the highest judge on all matters of Jewish law. Each yeshiva ruled differently on matters of ritual and law; the other yeshivot accepted these divisions, and all three ranked as equally orthodox. The yeshiva also served as an administrative authority, in conjunction with local communities, by appointing members to serve as the head of local congregations. These heads of a congregation served as a link between the congregation and the larger yeshiva it was attached to. These leaders would also submit questions to the yeshiva to obtain final rulings on issues of dogma, ritual, or law. Each congregation was expected to follow only one yeshiva to prevent conflict with different rulings issued by different yeshivot.

The yeshivot were financially supported by a number of means, including fixed voluntary, annual contributions; these contributions being collected and handled by local leaders appointed by the yeshiva. Private gifts and donations from individuals were also common, especially during holidays, consisting of money or goods.

The yeshiva of Jerusalem was finally forced into exile in Cairo in 1127, and eventually dispersed entirely. Likewise, the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita were dispersed following the Mongol invasions of the 13th century. After this education in Jewish religious studies became the responsibility of individual synagogues. No organization ever came to replace the three great yeshivot of Jerusalem, Sura and Pumbedita.

===To 19th century===
After the Geonic Period Jews established more Yeshiva academies in Europe and in Northern Africa, including the Kairuan yeshiva in Tunisia (Hebrew: ישיבת קאירואן) that was established by Chushiel Ben Elchanan (Hebrew: חושיאל בן אלחנן) in 974.

Traditionally, every town rabbi had the right to maintain a number of full or part-time pupils in the town&#x27;s beth midrash (study hall), which was usually adjacent to the synagogue. Their cost of living was covered by community taxation. After a number of years, the students who received &quot;semikha&quot; (rabbinical ordination) would either take up a vacant rabbinical position elsewhere or join the workforce.

====Lithuanian====

Organised Torah study was revolutionised by Chaim Volozhin, an influential 18th-century Lithuanian leader of Judaism and disciple of the Vilna Gaon. In his view, the traditional arrangement did not cater to those looking for more intensive study.

With the support of his teacher, Volozhin gathered interested students and started a yeshiva in the town of Valozhyn, located in modern-day Belarus. The Volozhin yeshiva was closed some 60 years later in 1892 following the Russian government&#x27;s demands for the introduction of certain secular studies. Thereafter, a number of yeshivot opened in other towns and cities, most notably Slabodka, Panevėžys, Mir, Brisk, and Telz. Many prominent contemporary &quot;yeshivot&quot; in the United States and Israel are continuations of these institutions, and often bear the same name.

In the 19th century, Israel Salanter initiated the Mussar movement in non-Hasidic Lithuanian Jewry, which sought to encourage yeshiva students and the wider community to spend regular times devoted to the study of Jewish ethical works. Concerned by the new social and religious changes of the Haskalah (the Jewish Enlightenment), and other emerging political ideologies (such as Zionism) that often opposed traditional Judaism, the masters of Mussar saw a need to augment Talmudic study with more personal works. These comprised earlier classic Jewish ethical texts (mussar literature), as well as a new literature for the movement. After early opposition, the Lithuanian yeshiva world saw the need for this new component in their curriculum, and set aside times for individual mussar study and mussar talks (&quot;mussar shmues&quot;). A &quot;mashgiach ruchani&quot; (spiritual mentor) encouraged the personal development of each student. To some degree, this Lithuanian movement arose in response, and as an alternative, to the separate mystical study of the Hasidic Judaism world. Hasidism began in the previous century within traditional Jewish life in Ukraine, and spread to Hungary, Poland and Russia. As the 19th century brought upheavals and threats to traditional Judaism, the Mussar teachers saw the benefit of the new spiritual focus in Hasidism, and developed their alternative ethical approach to spirituality.

Some variety developed within Lithuanian yeshivas to methods of studying Talmud and &quot;mussar&quot;, for example whether the emphasis would be placed on &quot;beki&#x27;ut&quot; (breadth) or &quot;iyyun&quot; (depth). &quot;Pilpul&quot;, a type of in-depth analytical and casuistic argumentation popular from the 16th to 18th centuries that was traditionally reserved for investigative Talmudic study, was not always given a place. The new analytical approach of the Brisker method, developed by Chaim Soloveitchik, has become widely popular. Other approaches include those of Mir, Chofetz Chaim, and Telz. In &quot;mussar&quot;, different schools developed, such as Slabodka and Novhardok, though today, a decline in devoted spiritual self-development from its earlier intensity has to some extent levelled out the differences.

====Hasidic====


With the success of the yeshiva institution in Lithuanian Jewry, the Hasidic world developed their own yeshivas, in their areas of Eastern Europe. These comprised the traditional Jewish focus on Talmudic literature that is central to Rabbinic Judaism, augmented by study of Hasidic philosophy (Hasidism). Examples of these Hasidic yeshivas are the Chabad Lubavitch yeshiva system of Tomchei Temimim, founded by Sholom Dovber Schneersohn in Russia in 1897, and the Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva established in Poland in 1930 by Meir Shapiro, who is renowned in both Hasidic and Lithuanian Jewish circles for initiating the Daf Yomi daily cycle of Talmud study.
(For contemporary &quot;yeshivas&quot;, see, for example, under Satmar, Belz, Bobov, Breslov and Pupa.)

In many Hasidic &quot;yeshivas&quot;, study of Hasidic texts is a secondary activity, similar to the additional mussar curriculum in Lithuanian yeshivas. These paths see Hasidism as a means to the end of inspiring emotional &quot;devekut&quot; (spiritual attachment to God) and mystical enthusiasm. In this context, the personal pilgrimage of a Hasid to his Rebbe is a central feature of spiritual life, in order to awaken spiritual fervour. Often, such paths will reserve the Shabbat in the yeshiva for the sweeter teachings of the classic texts of Hasidism.

In contrast, Chabad and Breslov, in their different ways, place daily study of their dynasties&#x27; Hasidic texts in central focus; see below. Illustrative of this is Sholom Dovber Schneersohn&#x27;s wish in establishing the Chabad yeshiva system, that the students should spend a part of the daily curriculum learning Chabad Hasidic texts &quot;with &quot;pilpul&quot;&quot;. The idea to learn Hasidic mystical texts with similar logical profundity, derives from the unique approach in the works of the Rebbes of Chabad, initiated by its founder Schneur Zalman of Liadi, to systematically investigate and articulate the &quot;Torah of the Baal Shem Tov&quot; in intellectual forms. Further illustrative of this is the differentiation in Chabad thought (such as the &quot;Tract on Ecstasy&quot; by Dovber Schneuri) between general Hasidism&#x27;s emphasis on emotional enthusiasm and the Chabad ideal of intellectually reserved ecstasy. In the Breslov movement, in contrast, the daily study of works from the imaginative, creative radicalism of Nachman of Breslov awakens the necessary soulfulness with which to approach other Jewish study and observance.

====Sephardi====


Although the yeshiva as an institution is in some ways a continuation of the Talmudic Academies in Babylonia, large scale educational institutions of this kind were not characteristic of the North African and Middle Eastern Sephardi Jewish world in pre-modern times: education typically took place in a more informal setting in the synagogue or in the entourage of a famous rabbi. In medieval Spain, and immediately following the expulsion in 1492, there were some schools which combined Jewish studies with sciences such as logic and astronomy, similar to the contemporary Islamic madrasas. In 19th century Jerusalem, a college was typically an endowment for supporting ten adult scholars rather than an educational institution in the modern sense; towards the end of the century a school for orphans was founded providing for some rabbinic studies. Early educational institutions on the European model were Midrash Bet Zilkha founded in 1870s Iraq and Porat Yosef Yeshiva founded in Jerusalem in 1914. Also notable is the Bet El yeshiva founded in 1737 in Jerusalem for advanced Kabbalistic studies. Later Sephardic yeshivot are usually on the model either of Porat Yosef or of the Ashkenazi institutions.

The Sephardic world has traditionally placed the study of Kabbalah (esoteric Jewish mysticism) in a more mainstream position than in the European Ashkenazi world. This difference of emphasis arose as a result of the Sabbatean heresy in the 17th century, that suppressed widespread study of Kabbalah in Europe in favour of Rabbinic Talmudic study. In Eastern European Lithuanian life, Kabbalah was reserved for an intellectual elite, while the mystical revival of Hasidism articulated Kabbalistic theology through Hasidic thought. These factors did not affect the Sephardi Jewish world, which retained a wider connection to Kabbalah in its traditionally observant communities. With the establishment of Sephardi yeshivas in Israel after the immigration of the Arabic Jewish communities there, some Sephardi yeshivas incorporated study of more accessible Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum. The European prescriptions to restrict advanced Kabbalistic study to mature and elite students also influence the choice of texts in such yeshivas.

===19th century to present===

====Conservative movement====

In 1854, the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau was founded. It was headed by Zecharias Frankel, and was viewed as the first educational institution associated with &quot;positive-historical Judaism&quot;, the predecessor of Conservative Judaism. In subsequent years, Conservative Judaism established a number of other institutions of higher learning (such as the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York City) that emulate the style of traditional yeshivas in significant ways. Many do not officially refer to themselves as &quot;yeshivas&quot; (one exception is the Conservative Yeshiva in Jerusalem), and all are open to both women and men, who study in the same classrooms and follow the same curriculum. Students may study part-time, as in a kollel, or full-time, and they may study &quot;lishmah&quot; (for the sake of studying itself) or towards earning rabbinic ordination.

====Nondenominational or mixed====

Non-denominational yeshivas and kollels with connections to Conservative Judaism include Yeshivat Hadar in New York, whose leaders include Rabbinical Assembly members Elie Kaunfer and Shai Held. The rabbinical school of the Academy for Jewish Religion in California is led by Conservative rabbi Mel Gottlieb. The faculty of the Academy for Jewish Religion in New York and of the Rabbinical School of Hebrew College in Newton Centre, Massachusetts also includes many Conservative rabbis.
See also Institute of Traditional Judaism.

More recently, several non-traditional, and nondenominational (also called &quot;transdenominational&quot; or &quot;postdenominational&quot;) seminaries have been established. These grant semikha in a shorter time, and with a modified curriculum, generally focusing on leadership and pastoral roles. These are JSLI, RSI, PRS and Ateret Tzvi. The Wolkowisk Mesifta is aimed at community professionals with significant knowledge and experience, and provides a tailored program to each candidate.

====Reform and Reconstructionist seminaries====

Hebrew Union College (HUC), affiliated with Reform Judaism, was founded in 1875 under the leadership of Isaac Mayer Wise in Cincinnati, Ohio. HUC later opened additional locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Jerusalem. It is a rabbinical seminary or college mostly geared for the training of rabbis and clergy specifically. Similarly, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College of Reconstructionist Judaism, founded in Pennsylvania in 1968, functions to train its future clergy. Some Reform and Reconstructionist teachers also teach at the non-denominational seminaries mentioned above. In Europe, Reform Judaism trains rabbis at Leo Baeck College in London, UK and Abraham Geiger Kolleg in Potsdam, Germany. None of these institutions describes itself as a &quot;yeshiva&quot;.

====Contemporary Orthodox====

World War II and the Holocaust brought the yeshivot of Eastern and Central Europe to an end; although many scholars and rabbinic students who survived the war established yeshivot in Israel as well a number of Western countries. The Yeshiva of Nitra was the last surviving in occupied Europe. Many students and faculty of the Mir Yeshiva were able to escape to Siberia, with the Yeshiva ultimately continuing to operate in Shanghai; see Yeshivas in World War II.

From the mid-20th century
the greatest number of yeshivot, and the most important were centered in Israel and in the U.S.;
they were also found in many other Western countries, prominent examples being Gateshead Yeshiva in England (one of the descendants of Novardok) and the Yeshiva of Aix-les-Bains, France.
The Chabad movement was particularly active in this direction, establishing yeshivot also in France, North Africa, Australia, and South Africa; this &quot;network of institutions&quot; is known as &quot;Tomchei Temimim&quot;.
Many prominent contemporary yeshivot in the U.S. and Israel are continuations of European institutions, and often bear the same name.

=====Israel=====
Yeshivot in Israel have operated since Talmudic times, 
as above;
see Talmudic academies in Eretz Yisrael.
More recent examples include the Ari Ashkenazi Synagogue (since the mid-1500s); the Bet El yeshiva (operating since 1737); and Etz Chaim Yeshiva (since 1841). 
Various yeshivot were established in Israel in the early 20th century: Shaar Hashamayim in 1906, Chabad&#x27;s Toras Emes in 1911, Hebron Yeshiva in 1924, Sfas Emes in 1925, Lomza in 1926. 
After (and during) World War II, numerous other Haredi and Hasidic Yeshivot were re-established there by survivors. The Mir Yeshiva in Jerusalem – today the largest Yeshiva in the world – was established in 1944, by Rabbi Eliezer Yehuda Finkel who had traveled to Palestine to obtain visas for his students; Ponevezh similarly by Rabbi Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman; and Knesses Chizkiyahu in 1949.
The leading Sephardi Yeshiva, Porat Yosef, was founded in 1914; its predecessor, Yeshivat Ohel Moed was founded in 1904. From the 1940s and onward, especially following immigration of the Arabic Jewish communities, Sephardi leaders, such as Ovadia Yosef and Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel, established various yeshivot to facilitate Torah education for Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews (and alternative to Lithuanian yeshivot).

The Haredi community has grown with time – In 2018, 12% of Israel&#x27;s population was Haredi, including Sephardic Haredim – supporting numerous yeshivot correspondingly. Boys and girls here attend separate schools, and proceed to higher Torah study, in a yeshiva or seminary, respectively, starting anywhere between the ages of 13 and 18; see &quot;Chinuch Atzmai&quot; and &quot;Bais Yaakov&quot;. A significant proportion of young men then remain in yeshiva until their marriage; thereafter many continue their Torah studies in a kollel. (In 2018, there were 133,000 in full-time learning .) Kollel studies usually focus on deep analysis of Talmud, and those Tractates not usually covered in the standard &quot;undergraduate&quot; program; see below. Some Kollels similarly focus on halacha in total, others specifically on those topics required for &quot;Semikha&quot; (Rabbinic ordination) or &quot;Dayanut&quot; (qualification as a Rabbinic Judge). The certification in question is often conferred by the Rosh Yeshiva.

Mercaz Harav, the foundational and leading Religious-Zionist yeshiva was established in 1924 by Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook. Many in the Religious Zionist community today attend a Hesder yeshiva (discussed below) during their national service; these offer a kollel for Rabbinical students. (Students generally prepare for the &quot;Semikha&quot; test of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel; until his recent passing (2020) commonly for that of the posek R. Zalman Nechemia Goldberg.)
Training as a &quot;Dayan&quot; in this community is usually through &quot;Machon Ariel&quot; (&quot;Machon Harry Fischel&quot;), also founded by Rav Kook, or &quot;Kollel Eretz Hemda&quot;. Women in this community, as above, study in a Midrasha. High school students study at &quot;Mamlachti dati&quot; schools, often associated with &quot;Bnei Akiva&quot;. Bar Ilan University allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; Jerusalem College of Technology similarly, which also offers a Haredi track; there are several colleges of education associated with Hesder and the &quot;Midrashot&quot; (these often offer specializations in &quot;Tanakh&quot; and &quot;Machshavah&quot; – discussed below).

=====United States=====
The first Orthodox yeshiva in the U.S. was Etz Chaim of New York (1886), modeled after Volozhin. It developed into the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (1896; &quot;RIETS&quot;) and eventually Yeshiva University in 1945. It was established in the wake of the immigration of Central and Eastern European Jews (1880s – 1924). Mesivtha Tifereth Jerusalem, founded in 1907, was led by Rabbi Moshe Feinstein from the 1940s through 1986; Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin, est 1904, was headed by Rabbi Yitzchok Hutner from 1943 to 1980. Many Hasidic dynasties have their main Yeshivot in America, typically established in the 1940s; the Central Lubavitcher Yeshiva has over 1000 students.

The postwar establishment of Ashkenazi yeshivot and &quot;kollelim&quot; parallels that in Israel; as does the educational pattern in the American Haredi community, although more obtain a secular education at the college level. Beth Medrash Govoha in Lakewood, New Jersey with 3,000 students in the early 2000s was founded in 1943 by R. Aaron Kotler on the &quot;rigid Lithuanian model&quot; that demanded full-time study; it now offers a Bachelor of Talmudic Law degree which allows students to go on to graduate school. The best known of the numerous Haredi yeshivas are, additional to &quot;Lakewood&quot;, Telz, &quot;Rabbinical Seminary of America&quot;, Ner Yisroel, Chaim Berlin, and Hebrew Theological College; &quot;Yeshivish&quot; (i.e. satellite) communities often maintain a community kollel.
Many Hasidic sects have their own yeshivas, such as Satmar and Bobov, while Chabad operates its &quot;Tomchei Temimim&quot; nationwide.
The first Sephardic yeshiva in the Americas was Yeshivat Mikdash Melech, established in 1972 by Rabbi Haim Benoliel. (In 1988, the yeshiva opened a branch in Israel, Mikdash Melech Jerusalem, to serve English-speaking Sephardic students.) There are over today 600 junior and high schools, typically a Mesivta or Bais Yaakov;
see Torah Umesorah.

Modern Orthodox typically spend a year, often two, post-high school in a yeshiva (sometimes Hesder) or &quot;Midrasha&quot; in Israel. Many thereafter, or instead, attend Yeshiva University, undertaking a dual curriculum, combining academic education with Torah study; see &quot;Torah Umadda&quot;, and S. Daniel Abraham Israel Program. (A percentage stay in Israel, &quot;making &quot;Aliyah&quot;&quot;; many also go on to higher education in other American colleges.) Semikha is usually through RIETS, although many Modern Orthodox Rabbis study through &quot;Hesder&quot;, or other Yeshivot in Israel such as Yeshivat HaMivtar, Mizrachi&#x27;s &quot;Musmachim&quot; program, and Machon Ariel.
RIETS also houses several post-semikha kollelim, including one focused on &quot;Dayanut&quot;. Dayanim also train through Kollel Eretz Hemda and Machon Ariel; while Mizrachi&#x27;s post-semikha &quot;Manhigut Toranit&quot; program focuses on leadership and scholarship, with the advanced semikha of &quot;Rav Ir&quot;. Communities will often host a &quot;Torah MiTzion&quot; kollel, where &quot;Hesder&quot; graduates learn and teach, generally for one year. 
There are numerous Modern Orthodox Jewish day schools, typically offering a &quot;beit midrash&quot; / &quot;metivta&quot; program in parallel with the standard curriculum, (often) structured such that students are able to join the first &quot;shiur&quot; in an Israeli yeshiva.

The US educational pattern is to be found around the Jewish world, with regional differences; see :Category:Orthodox yeshivas in Europe and :Category:Orthodox yeshivas by country.

==Structure and features==
Yeshiva study is differentiated from, for example university study, by several features, apart from the curriculum. The year is structured into &quot;&quot;zmanim&quot;; the day is structured into &quot;seders&quot;. The learning itself is delivered through a &quot;shiur&quot;, a discursive-lecture with pre-specified sources, or &quot;marei mekomot&quot;&quot; (מראה מקומות; &quot;bibliography&quot;, lit. &quot;indication of the (textual) locations&quot;); study in general, and particularly the preparation for &quot;shiur&quot;, takes place in &quot;&quot; or paired-study. This study is in a common venue called the &quot;bet midrash&quot; (Yiddish, &quot;zal&quot; i.e. &quot;hall&quot;).

The institution is headed by its &quot;rosh yeshiva&quot;, while other senior rabbis are referred to as &quot;Ram&quot; (&quot;rosh mesivta or reish metivta&quot;); the &quot;mashgiach&quot; assumes responsibility for students&#x27; spiritual development (&quot;mashpia&quot;, in Hasidic yeshivot). A &quot;kollel&quot; is headed by its &quot;rosh kollel&quot;, even when it is part of a yeshiva. A &quot;sho&#x27;el u&#x27;meishiv&quot; (; ask and he answers; often simply &quot;&quot;meishiv&quot;, or alternately &quot;nosay v&#x27;notayn&quot;&quot;) is available to consult to students on difficult points in their day&#x27;s Talmudic studies. The rabbi responsible for the Talmudic &quot;shiur&quot; is known as a &quot;maggid shiur&quot;. Students are known as &quot;talmidim&quot; (sing. &quot;talmid&quot;).
&quot;Rav muvhak&quot; is sometimes used in reference to one&#x27;s primary teacher; correspondingly, &quot;talmid muvhak&quot; may refer to a primary, or outstanding, student.

===Academic year===

In most yeshivot, the year is divided into three periods (terms) called &quot;zmanim&quot; (lit. times; sing. &quot;zman&quot;). &quot;Elul zman&quot; starts from the beginning of the Hebrew month of Elul and extends until the end of Yom Kippur. The six-weeks-long semester is the shortest yet most intense session, as it comes before the High Holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Winter &quot;zman&quot; starts after Sukkot and lasts until about two weeks before Passover, a duration of five months (six in a Jewish leap year). Summer &quot;zman&quot; starts after Passover and lasts until Rosh Chodesh Av or Tisha B&#x27;Av, a duration of about three months.

===Chavruta-style learning===

Yeshiva students prepare for and review the &quot;shiur&quot; (lecture) with their &quot;chavruta&quot; during a study session known as a &quot;seder&quot;. In contrast to conventional classroom learning, in which a teacher lectures to the student, &quot;chavruta&quot;-style learning requires the student to analyze and explain the material, point out the errors in their partner&#x27;s reasoning, and question and sharpen each other&#x27;s ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights of the meaning of the text. A &quot;chavruta&quot; is intended to help a student keep their mind focused on the learning, sharpen their reasoning powers, develop their thoughts into words, organize their thoughts into logical arguments, and understand another person&#x27;s viewpoint. The shiur-based system was innovated at the Telshe yeshiva, where there were five levels.

Chavruta-style learning tends to be animated, as study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud to each other, and then analyze, question, debate, and argue their points of view to arrive at an understanding of the text. In the heat of discussion, they may wave their hands, pound the table, or shout at each other. Depending on the size of the yeshiva, dozens or even hundreds of pairs of &quot;chavrutas&quot; can be heard discussing and debating each other&#x27;s viewpoints. Students need to learn the ability to block out other discussions in order to focus on theirs.

===Types===


# Yeshiva Ketana (junior yeshiva) or &quot;Talmud Torah&quot; – Many Haredi (non-Hasidic and Hasidic) yeshivot ketanot in Israel, and some (primarily Hasidic) in the Diaspora, do not have a secular course of studies, with all students learning Judaic Torah studies full-time.
# Yeshiva High School – also called &quot;Mesivta&quot; (Metivta) or &quot;Mechina&quot; or &quot;Yeshiva Ketana&quot;, or in Israel, &quot;Yeshiva Tichonit&quot; – combines the intensive Jewish religious education with a secular high school education. The dual curriculum was pioneered by the Manhattan Talmudical Academy of Yeshiva University (now known as Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy) in 1916; &quot;Aluma&quot; was established in Jerusalem in 1936, and &quot;ha-Yishuv&quot; in Tel Aviv in 1937.
# Mechina – For Israeli high-school graduates who wish to study for one year before entering the army. In Telshe yeshivas and in Ner Yisroel of Baltimore, the Mesivtas/Yeshiva ketanas are known as Mechinas.
# Beth midrash – For high school graduates, and is attended from one year to many years, dependent on the career plans and affiliation of the student.
# Yeshivat Hesder – Yeshiva that has an arrangement with the Israel Defense Forces by which the students enlist together in the same unit and, as much as is possible serve in the same unit in the army. Over a period of about 5 years there will be a period of service starting in the second year of about 16 months. There are different variations. The rest of the time will be spent in compulsory study in the yeshiva. The Hesder Yeshiva concept is attributed to Rav Yehuda Amital. The first was Yeshivat Kerem B&#x27;Yavneh, established in 1954; the largest is the Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot with over 800 students.
# Kollel – Yeshiva for married men. The kollel idea has its intellectual roots in the Torah; Mishnah tractate Megillah mentions the law that a town can only be called a &quot;city&quot; if it supports ten men (&quot;batlanim&quot;) to make up the required quorum for communal learning. It is mostly a modern innovation of 19th-century Europe. A kollel will often be in the same location as the yeshiva.
# Baal Teshuva yeshivot catering to the needs of the newly Orthodox.

A post-high school for women is generally called a &quot;seminary&quot;, or &quot;midrasha&quot; (plural &quot;midrashot&quot;) in Israel, and not a yeshiva. (Although there are exceptions such as Prospect Park Yeshiva.) The Haredi Bais Yaakov system was started in 1918 under the guidance of Sarah Schenirer. These institutions provide girls with a Torah education, using a curriculum that skews more toward practical &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law) and the study of Tanakh, rather than Talmud. The curriculum at Religious Zionist and Modern Orthodox &quot;midrashot&quot; includes some study of Talmud: often Mishnah, sometimes &quot;Gemara&quot;; in further distinction, curricula generally entail &quot;chavruta&quot;-based study of the texts of Jewish philosophy, and likewise Tanakh is studied with commentaries. See for further discussion.

===Languages===
Classes in most Lithuanian and Hasidic yeshivot (throughout the world) are taught in Yiddish; Kol Torah, established in 1939 in Jerusalem and headed by Shlomo Zalman Auerbach for over 40 years, was the first mainstream Haredi yeshiva to teach in Hebrew, as opposed to Yiddish. Sephardi, Modern Orthodox, Zionist, and &quot;baal teshuvah&quot; yeshivot use Modern Hebrew or the local language. In many American non-Hassidic Yeshivos, the language generally used is English.

Students learn with each other in whatever language they are most proficient, with Hasidic students usually learning in Yiddish, Israeli Lithuanian students in Hebrew, and American Lithuanian students in English.

=== College credit ===

Some yeshivas permit students to attend college. Often there are arrangements for the student to receive credit towards a college degree for their yeshiva studies. Yeshiva University in New York provides a year&#x27;s worth of credit for yeshiva studies. Institutions with similar arrangements in place include Lander College for Men, Yeshivas Ner Yisroel and Hebrew Theological College.

As above, some American &quot;yeshivot&quot; in fact &quot;award&quot; the degrees Bachelor of Talmudic Law (4 years cumulative study), Master of Rabbinic Studies / Master of Talmudic Law (six years), and (at &quot;Ner Yisroel&quot;) the Doctorate in Talmudic Law (10 years).
These degrees are nationally accredited by the Association of Advanced Rabbinical and Talmudic Schools, and may then grant access to graduate programs such as law school.

Non-Orthodox institutions, typically, require that students earn a master&#x27;s degree, inherent in the Ordination program. The program is then often credit-based, and may require a thesis.

==Curriculum==

Torah study at an Orthodox yeshiva comprises the study of rabbinic literature - essentially along the lines established in the Lithuanian Yeshivas as above - principally the Talmud, along with the study of &quot;halacha&quot; (Jewish law); Musar and Hasidic philosophy are often studied also. In some institutions, classical Jewish philosophy or Kabbalah are formally studied, or the works of individual thinkers (such as Abraham Isaac Kook). 

See also .

Non-Orthodox institutions offer a synthesis of traditional and critical methods, allowing Jewish texts and tradition to encounter social change and modern scholarship. The curriculum is thus also focused on classical Jewish subjects – e.g. Talmud, Tanakh, Midrash, &quot;halacha&quot;, and Philosophy –
but differs from Orthodox yeshivot in that the subject-weights are more even (correspondingly, Talmud and halacha are less emphasized), and the approach entails an openness to modern scholarship;
the curriculum also emphasizes &quot;the other functions of a modern rabbi such as preaching, counseling, and pastoral work&quot;.
As mentioned, often, in these institutions less emphasis is placed on Talmud and Jewish law, &quot;but rather on sociology, cultural studies, and modern Jewish philosophy&quot;.

Conservative Yeshivot occupy a position midway, in that their training places (significantly) more emphasis on Halakha and Talmud than other non-Orthodox programs.
See Conservative halakha.

The sections below discuss the Orthodox approach, but may also be seen as overviews of the traditional content.

===Talmud study===


In a typical Orthodox yeshiva, the main emphasis is on Talmud study, and particularly on its analytic component, &quot;Gemara&quot;:- an often intensive &quot;dialectic give and take&quot; (Aramaic: &quot;shakla v&#x27;tarya&quot;) where the cases brought in the underlying &quot;Mishnah&quot; are analyzed, thereby explicating all inherent teachings and insights. 
For discussion of the nature, structure and characteristics of this activity, see and .

Generally, two parallel Talmud streams are covered during a (trimester). 
The first is , or in-depth study (variants described below), often confined to selected legally focused tractates with an emphasis on analytical skills and close reference to the classical commentators.
The second stream, &quot;beki&#x27;ut&quot; (&quot;expertise&quot;), seeks to build general knowledge of the Talmud. In some Hasidic yeshivas, (&quot;text&quot;), is the term used for , but may also incorporate an element of memorization.

In the yeshiva system of Talmudic study, the undergraduate yeshivot focus on the &quot;mesechtohs&quot; (tractates) that cover civil jurisprudence and monetary law (&quot;Nezikin&quot;) and those dealing with contract and marital law (&quot;Nashim&quot;); through them, the student can best master the proper technique of Talmudic analysis, and in parallel, the halakhic application of Talmudic principles. With these mastered, the student goes on to other areas of the Talmud. Tractates &quot;Berachot&quot;, &quot;Sukkah&quot;, &quot;Pesachim&quot; and &quot;Shabbat&quot; are often included. See for example under . Sometimes tractates dealing with an upcoming religious holiday are studied before and during the holiday (e.g. &quot;Shabbat&quot; 21a–23b for Chanukah, Tractate &quot;Megilla&quot; for Purim, etc.).

Works initially studied to clarify the Talmudic text are the commentary by Rashi, and the related work &quot;Tosafot&quot;, a parallel analysis and running critique.
The integration of Talmud, Rashi and Tosafot, is considered as foundational – and prerequisite – to further analysis (in fact, this combination is sometimes referred to by its own acronym, &quot;gefet&quot; גפ״ת – &quot;Gemara&quot;, &quot;perush Rashi&quot;, &quot;Tosafot&quot;). 
The super-commentaries by &quot;Maharshal&quot;, &quot;Maharam&quot; and &quot;Maharsha&quot; address the three components together: being at a further remove from the underlying Talmudic debate, these - with their interplay - constitute a higher-order of analysis.

At more advanced levels, additional &quot;mefarshim&quot; (commentators) are similarly studied: other &quot;rishonim&quot;, from the 11th to 14th centuries, as well as &quot;acharonim&quot;, from later generations. There are two main schools of &quot;rishonim&quot;, from France and from Spain, who will hold different interpretations and understandings of the Talmud; the &quot;acharonim&quot; collate and clarify these opinions, and constitute, then, a further layer of analysis. Widely referenced here are the &quot;Meiri&quot;, &quot;Ramban&quot;, &quot;Rashba&quot;, &quot;Ritva&quot;, &quot;Ran&quot; and &quot;Rim&quot;, as well as the parallel &quot;Shitah Mekubetzet&quot; compilation.

At these levels, students link the Talmudic discussion to codified law – particularly &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; (i.e. Maimonides), Arba&#x27;ah Turim and Shulchan Aruch – by studying, also, the halakha-focused commentaries of Asher ben Jehiel, Isaac Alfasi and Mordechai ben Hillel, respectively referred to as &quot;Rosh&quot;, &quot;Rif&quot;, and the &quot;Mordechai&quot;. Here, too, any differences give rise to further analysis - especially where these have implications re &quot;practice&quot; - and the underlying Talmudic opinions, and the other commentaries, are in turn revisited.
As the level of the &quot;shiur&quot; progresses, so the student must integrate more of these commentaries into their analysis of the &quot;sugya&quot; (loosely, Talmudic &quot;unit of analysis&quot;), simultaneously understanding the specific &quot;chidush&quot;, i.e. novel contribution, as well as any implication re practical-halakha. This &quot;iyyun&quot; will generally take one of the following forms, each the &quot;derech ha-limud&quot; or &quot;way of learning&quot; of the Yeshiva (see the Hebrew article &quot;Approaches to Learning Talmud&quot;):

* At the higher levels, in many Lithuanian influenced Yeshivot, the highly analytic &quot;Brisker method&quot; is employed, as mentioned. The method - often referred to simply as &quot;lomdus&quot; - seeks to identify the principles underlying each commentator&#x27;s approach, abstracting beyond the context of the specific &quot;sugya&quot;, by placing each within a categorical structure.
* Elsewhere, and generally, the approach is more traditional: Students work through each &quot;sugya&quot; in light of the various rishonim, successively specifying and understanding - and if possible, reconciling - differences (legal and conceptual) between these, such that &quot;every particular contributes to the clarification of the others.&quot; Through this, the study builds and deepens the concepts and principles arising from the tractate. Throughout, an important simultaneous requirement is that the &quot;simple interpretation&quot; of the underlying &quot;sugyas&quot; must maintain.
* Many Yeshivot proceed &quot;aliba dehilchasa&quot; (אליבא דהלכתא, Seph. pronunciation, &quot;dehilchata&quot;; lit. &quot;according to the Law&quot;), where the learning focuses more on the Halachik-rules that develop from the &quot;sugya&quot;, delineating how the opinions of the rishonim and acharonim relate to practice. There are two sub-approaches: The first, often the approach taken at Sephardic Yeshivot, analyzes the &quot;sugya&quot; as the source of the &quot;halacha&quot;, understanding how it inheres in each &quot;rishon&quot;, and is undertaken even for topics with limited application (prototypical are &quot;ir nidachat&quot; and &quot;ben sorer umoreh&quot;). The second, often applied when the &quot;sugya&quot; is studied by &quot;semikha&quot; students - see below - focuses on the implication re practical-halacha, the &quot;nafka mina&quot;, of each commentary, somewhat limiting consequent theoretical and abstract discussion.
* Some Yeshivot – such as Birkat Moshe – particularly emphasize the Rambam, analyzing the &quot;sugya&quot; in light of the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; and its numerous commentaries. (&quot;Brisker&quot; yeshivot invariably reference Rambam also: the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; covers all of halacha, and thus provides a consistent reference for the treatment of other &quot;rishonim&quot;; see &quot;Chiddushei Rabbeinu Chaim&quot;.)

The &quot;Rosh Yeshiva&quot; gives the most senior &quot;shiur&quot;. It is here that the student consolidates the yeshiva&#x27;s approach to &quot;iyyun&quot;, i.e. its &quot;derech ha-limud&quot;; see . 
At many yeshivot, students are thus expected to learn in this &quot;shiur&quot; for at least two years before proceeding to &quot;Kollel&quot; or &quot;semikha&quot; study (and with the &quot;Rosh Yeshiva&#x27;s&quot; sanction).
The &quot;Rosh Yeshiva&quot; also delivers the weekly &quot;shiur klali&quot; (&quot;comprehensive lecture&quot;), which sums up the week&#x27;s learning, and revisits a selected topic or concept in further detail; this is attended by all levels, and will often have its own &quot;marei mekomot&quot;.

Typically, boys begin their study of Talmud in late elementary school, initially studying Mishnah, the component of Talmud where, as outlined above, the underlying &quot;cases&quot; are presented. (At this stage, they have completed their survey of &quot;Chumash&quot;, with these cases expanding on the legal precepts there; see below.) In early middle school, &quot;gemara&quot;, the analytic component, is introduced; by high school some are able to work with &quot;Tosafot&quot;. Some systems more closely follow &quot;Pirkei Avot&quot; ch 5:21 as a guideline; where Mishna-study begins at age 10, and &quot;Gemara&quot; at 15. See Zilberman Method for further discussion.

===Jewish law===

Generally, a period is devoted to the study of practical &quot;halakha&quot; (&quot;Halakha LeMaaseh&quot;), emphasizing application as opposed to derivation. The text most commonly studied in Ashkenazi yeshivot is the &quot;Mishnah Berurah&quot;, a commentary on the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; originally published between 1884 and 1907. 
In Sephardic yeshivot, the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; itself is more commonly studied, along with the &quot;Bet Yosef&quot; commentary; the &quot;Yalkut Yosef&quot; and &quot;Kaf Hachaim&quot; are also often studied, while &quot;Ben Ish Hai&quot; is a standard reference. In Chabad yeshivot, emphasis is placed upon study of &quot;Shulchan Aruch HaRav&quot;. Beginning students are encouraged to also work through the &quot;Kitzur Shulchan Aruch&quot;, so as to survey all areas of applicable &quot;halacha&quot; and to consolidate their prior, high school, Torah knowledge; this is also often the practice outside of Chabad. More advanced students, additionally and similarly, review the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; through its daily study cycle (this is often outside of any &quot;seder&quot;), here including &quot;halachot&quot; relating to, for example, the Temple.

Students in &quot;Semikha&quot; (Rabbinic ordination) programs, and often those in kollel, devote the largest portion of their schedule to &quot;halakha&quot;. The focus is on in-depth, source-based study of those areas where (community) Rabbis will typically be asked &quot;shaylas&quot;, i.e. halachic questions: the testing invariably covers Kashrut (referred to as &quot;Issur v&#x27;Heter&quot;), usually Shabbat, often Niddah, sometimes Avelut (mourning) and/or marriage. This study, typically of two to four year&#x27;s duration, encompasses a detailed analysis of the &quot;halakha&quot; in the &quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim&quot; and &quot;Bet Yosef&quot;, through its final presentation in the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, with its major commentaries (especially &quot;&quot;Shakh&quot; and &quot;Taz&quot;&quot;), complemented by a survey of key &quot;She&#x27;elot u-Teshuvot&quot; (responsa), recent and historical. The analysis, in turn, is built on a detailed knowledge of all relevant Talmudic &quot;sugyas&quot;, which are studied accordingly within the schedule,
emphasizing the legal commentaries mentioned. Students in an Orthodox Semikha program will thus have a thorough 

background in Talmud, typically
having spent at least four
preceding years in Yeshiva; Kollel students likewise. (See and .) 
During the morning &quot;seder&quot;, Semikha students continue their Talmud studies, learning the same &quot;masechet&quot; as the rest of the Yeshiva,
often independently, but in many yeshivot, participating in the &quot;Rosh Yeshiva&#x27;s&quot; &quot;shiur&quot;. (Rabbis, then, will have been direct &quot;students of the &quot;Rosh Yeshiva&quot;&quot; for their final four, or more, years of study.)

===Ethics, mysticism and philosophy===
Haredi &quot;Yeshivot&quot; (with the exception of Brisker yeshivot) typically devote a &quot;seder&quot; to &quot;mussar&quot; (ethics and character development). The preeminent text studied is the &quot;Mesillat Yesharim&quot; (&quot;Path of the Just&quot;) of Moshe Chaim Luzzatto. Other works of mussar literature studied include:
*&quot;Orchot Tzaddikim&quot; (&quot;Paths of the Righteous&quot;); its authorship and time of writing is uncertain, but as it quotes Maimonides, it was written some time after his works were disseminated.
*&quot;Chovot ha-Levavot&quot; (&quot;Duties of the Hearts&quot;) by Bahya ibn Paquda.
*&quot;Ma&#x27;alot ha-Middot&quot; (&quot;Benefit [of good character] traits&quot;) by Jehiel Anav
*&quot;Mishnat R&#x27; Aharon&quot;, Mussar Lectures on many topics by Aharon Kotler.
*&quot;Mikhtav me-Eliyahu&quot;, the works of Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler.
*&quot;Tomer Devorah&quot; by Moses Cordovero.
*&quot;Sichos Mussar&quot; by Chaim Leib Shmuelevitz.
*&quot;Pele Yoetz&quot; by Eliezer Papo.
* &quot;Kav ha-Yashar&quot; by Tzvi Hirsch Kaidanover.

As above, these sessions focus the student on self-understanding and introspection, internalizing the spiritual aims of Judaism, and developing the character-traits, or &quot;middos&quot;, appropriately. Topics in applied Jewish ethics, such as the &quot;laws of speech&quot;, are often studied separately.

Hasidic yeshivot study the mystical, spiritual works of Hasidic philosophy (&quot;Chassidus&quot;). These draw on the earlier esoteric theology of &quot;Kabbalah&quot;, but articulates it in terms of inner psychological awareness and personal analogies. This study thus makes Jewish mysticism accessible and tangible, so that it inspires emotional &quot;dveikus&quot; (cleaving to God) and embeds a deep spiritual element in daily Jewish life; it thereby serves a similar purpose to &quot;mussar&quot;, but through different means and with different contributions to intellectual and emotional life. Chabad yeshivot, for example, study the &quot;Tanya&quot;, the &quot;Likutei Torah&quot;, and the voluminous works of the &quot;Rebbes&quot; of Chabad for an hour and a half each morning, before prayers, and an hour and a half in the evening.

As mentioned, Sephardi &quot;yeshivot&quot; often incorporate study of selected Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum – standard texts, as well as works by Yosef Hayyim, Yehuda Fatiyah and Yaakov Chaim Sofer. Kabbalistic sources are brought in &quot;halachik&quot; works such as &quot;Kaf Hachaim&quot; and &quot;Ben Ish Hai&quot; – and are then studied indirectly also; see .

In Hesder, Religious Zionist and Modern Orthodox yeshivot,
&quot;Machshavah&quot; (Jewish philosophy generalized / applied as &quot;Jewish thought&quot;; also &quot;Hashkafa&quot;, &quot;worldview&quot;) is taught formally,
with &quot;shiurim&quot; systematically covering the classic topics, as well as contemporary issues, in light of the leading works here, with the treatment mirroring Talmud-study as above. 
These works (&quot;Kuzari, Moreh Nevukhim, Sefer ha-Ikkarim, Emunot ve-Deot, Derech Hashem, Nefesh Ha-Chaim, Kad ha-Kemach&quot; and others) in turn draw on &quot;Talmudic-Aggadah&quot; / &quot;Midrash&quot;, and on &quot;Tanach&quot; (see below). 
Hesder yeshivot additionally devote specific time to the writings of Abraham Isaac Kook, &quot;Rav Kook&quot;, who articulated a unique personal blend of mysticism, creative exegesis and philosophy (as well as to &quot;Torat Eretz Yisrael&quot; generally). The Modern Orthodox, similarly, study the works of Joseph B. Soloveitchik, &quot;Rav Soloveitchik&quot;.
Hasidic philosophy and Mussar are also often taught; and &quot;Maharal&quot; may have a dedicated &quot;shiur&quot;. Machshava is also a focus-area of many &quot;Midrashot&quot;.

Some Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas also include formal study of &quot;Hashkafa&quot;, especially at &quot;ba&#x27;al teshuva&quot; focused institutions; many &quot;Semikha&quot; programs likewise, particularly those with an outreach, or &quot;kiruv&quot;, component. Regardless, students here typically study the major works independent of a &quot;shiur&quot;.

===Torah and Bible study===
Intensive study of &quot;Chumash&quot; (Torah) with the commentary of Rashi is stressed and taught in all elementary grades. In Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas, this is often done with Yiddish translations. The rest of the &quot;Tanach&quot; (Hebrew Bible; acronym: &quot;Torah&quot; and &quot;Nach&quot; = &quot;Torah, Nevi&#x27;im u&#x27;Ketuvim&quot;; &quot;Torah, Prophets and Writings&quot;) is usually taught through high school, although less intensively.

In Yeshivot, thereafter, &quot;Chumash&quot;, and especially &quot;Nach&quot;, are studied less directly. Yeshiva students typically follow the practice of &quot;Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum&quot;, independently reviewing the upcoming &quot;parashah&quot; (weekly Torah portion) twice in the original Hebrew and once in Targum Onkelos (an Aramaic translation), together with Rashi&#x27;s commentary. Students often also study Ramban&#x27;s commentary, functioning in relation to Rashi here, somewhat as Tosafot above; less frequently, other commentaries from the &quot;Mikraot Gedolot&quot; edition are reviewed. 
Students may similarly study &quot;Nach&quot; independently (often using the &quot;Metzudos&quot; commentary); usually, &quot;Tanach&quot; is not taught &quot;per se&quot;, with exceptions being the five Megilloth and Tehillim. The &quot;Rosh Yeshiva&quot; delivers a weekly &quot;shiur&quot; on the &quot;parashah&quot;, exploring a particular question or theme, with a related ethical or &quot;hashkafic&quot; teaching; this is often open to the public.

At Hesder, Religious Zionist and Modern Orthodox yeshivot, the study of &quot;Chumash&quot; and &quot;Nach&quot; continues in parallel with Talmud study. These institutions offer formal &quot;shiurim&quot; in many, if not all, of the books of &quot;Nevi&#x27;im&quot; and &quot;Ketuvim&quot;. These are often structured by level, similar to Talmud study, where the text, and its overall structure, is then analyzed in light of the various commentaries and &quot;Midrashim&quot;, typically complementing the &quot;Machshavah&quot; &quot;shiurim&quot;. 
(See further re this approach under .)
More recent commentaries especially studied are &quot;&quot;Netziv&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;Malbim&quot;&quot;; as well as reference works such as &quot;Da&#x27;at Miqra&quot; by Mordechai Breuer and others.
The commentaries by Ramban, Abarbanel, &quot;Rabbeinu Behaye&quot;, and &quot;Rav Hirsch&quot; provide much philosophical content. 
The &quot;Sefer ha-Chinuch&quot;, although not a commentary &quot;per se&quot;, offers a systematic legal and philosophic discussion of the commandments, and is similarly referenced. 
Intensive study of Tanach, as for Machshava, is likewise a feature of many &quot;Midrashot&quot;.

<doc id="142495" wikidata="Q581846" url="?curid=142495" title="Randori">
<text>is a term used in Japanese martial arts to describe free-style practice (sparring). The term denotes an exercise in 取り &quot;tori&quot;, applying technique to a random (乱 &quot;ran&quot;) succession of &quot;uke&quot; attacks. 

The actual connotation of &quot;randori&quot; depends on the martial art it is used in. In judo, jujutsu, and Shodokan aikido, among others, it most often refers to one-on-one sparring where partners attempt to resist and counter each other&#x27;s techniques. In other styles of aikido, in particular Aikikai, it refers to a form of practice in which a designated aikidoka defends against multiple attackers in quick succession without knowing how they will attack or in what order.

==In Japan==
The term is used in aikido, judo, and Brazilian jiu-jitsu dojos outside Japan. In Japan, this form of practice is called , which literally means multiple attackers.

==In judo==
The term was described by Jigoro Kano, the founder of judo, in a speech at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympic Games: &quot;Randori, meaning &quot;free exercise&quot;, is practiced under conditions of actual contest. It includes throwing, choking, holding the opponent down, and bending or twisting of the arms. The two combatants may use whatever methods they like provided they do not hurt each other and obey the rules of judo concerning etiquette, which are essential to its proper working.&quot;

There are 2 types of randori.

==In aikido==
Most commonly, one or more attackers rush toward tori and try to grab both elbows. The tori&#x27;s goal is to perform quick tai sabaki and avoid hurting the attackers as much as possible. Therefore, the tori does not punch, but rather tries to avoid the attacks or to throw the attackers. In some aikido styles, the attack is free, and so are the techniques applied, as long as they follow the principles of aikido.

==In karate==
Although in karate the word &quot;kumite&quot; is usually reserved for sparring, some schools also employ the term &quot;randori&quot; with regard to &quot;mock-combat&quot; in which both karateka move with speed, parrying and attacking with all four limbs (including knees and elbows). In these schools, the distinction between randori and &quot;kumite&quot; is that in randori, the action is uninterrupted when a successful technique is applied. (Also known as ju kumite or soft sparring.)

==In ninjutsu==
Randori is also practiced in Bujinkan ninjutsu and usually represented to the practitioner when he reaches the &quot;Shodan&quot; level. In ninjutsu, randori puts the practitioner in a position where he is armed or unarmed and is attacked by multiple attackers.

<doc id="142509" wikidata="Q60676411" url="?curid=142509" title="Magical Mystery Tour">
<text>Magical Mystery Tour is a record by the English rock band the Beatles that was released as a double EP in the United Kingdom and an LP in the United States. It includes the soundtrack to the 1967 television film of the same title. The EP was issued in the UK on 8 December 1967 on the Parlophone label, while the Capitol Records LP release in the US and Canada occurred on 27 November and features an additional five songs that were originally released as singles that year. In 1976, Parlophone released the eleven-track LP in the UK.

When recording their new songs, the Beatles continued the studio experimentation that had typified &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967) and the psychedelic sound they had pursued since &quot;Revolver&quot; (1966). The project was initiated by Paul McCartney in April 1967, but after the band recorded the song &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, it lay dormant until the death of their manager, Brian Epstein, in late August. Recording then took place alongside filming and editing, and as the Beatles furthered their public association with Transcendental Meditation under teacher Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

The sessions have been characterised by some biographers as aimless and unfocused, with the band members overly indulging in sound experimentation and exerting greater control over production. McCartney contributed three of the soundtrack songs, including the widely covered &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot;, while John Lennon and George Harrison contributed &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; and &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot;, respectively. The sessions also produced &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;, issued as a single accompanying the soundtrack record, and items of incidental music for the film, including &quot;Flying&quot;. Further to the Beatles&#x27; desire to experiment with record formats and packaging, the EP and LP included a 24-page booklet containing song lyrics, colour photos from film production, and colour story illustrations by cartoonist Bob Gibson.

Despite the mixed reception of the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; film, the soundtrack was a critical and commercial success. In the UK, it topped the EPs chart compiled by &quot;Record Retailer&quot; and peaked at number 2 on the magazine&#x27;s singles chart (later the UK Singles Chart) behind &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;. The album topped &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top LPs listings for eight weeks and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1969. With the international standardisation of the Beatles&#x27; catalogue in 1987, &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; became the only Capitol-generated LP to supersede the band&#x27;s intended format and form part of their core catalogue.

==Background==

After the Beatles completed &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; in April 1967, Paul McCartney wanted to create a film that captured a psychedelic theme similar to that represented by author and LSD proponent Ken Kesey&#x27;s Merry Pranksters on the US West Coast. Titled &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, it would combine Kesey&#x27;s idea of a psychedelic bus ride with McCartney&#x27;s memories of Liverpudlians holidaying on coach tours. The film was to be unscripted: various &quot;ordinary&quot; people were to travel on a coach and have unspecified &quot;magical&quot; adventures. The Beatles began recording music for the soundtrack in late April, but the film idea then lay dormant. Instead, the band continued recording songs for the United Artists animated film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; and, in the case of &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;, for their appearance on the &quot;Our World&quot; satellite broadcast on 25 June, before travelling over the summer months and focusing on launching their company Apple.

In late August, while the Beatles were attending a Transcendental Meditation seminar held by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Wales, their manager Brian Epstein died of a prescription drug overdose. During a band meeting on 1 September, McCartney suggested they proceed with &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, which Epstein had given his approval to earlier in the year. McCartney was keen to ensure the group had a point of focus after the loss of their manager. His view was at odds with his bandmates&#x27; wishes, with George Harrison especially eager to pursue their introduction to meditation. According to publicist Tony Barrow, McCartney envisaged &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; as &quot;open[ing] doors for him&quot; personally and as a new career phase for the band in which he would be the &quot;executive producer&quot; of their films. John Lennon later complained that the project was typical of McCartney&#x27;s &quot;tendency&quot; to want to work as soon as he had songs ready to record, yet he himself was unprepared and had to set about writing new material.

==Recording and production==
===Recording history===
The Beatles first recorded the film&#x27;s title song, with sessions taking place at EMI Studios in London between 25 April and 3 May. An instrumental jam was recorded on 9 May for possible inclusion in the film, although it was never completed. According to Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; sessions &quot;began in earnest&quot; on 5 September; filming started on 11 September, and the two activities became increasingly &quot;intertwined&quot; during October. Most of the 16 September session was dedicated to taping a basic track for McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot;, only for McCartney to then decide to return to the version he had previously discarded, from 22–23 August. The latter sessions marked the Beatles&#x27; first in close to two months and took place at a facility new to the band – Chappell Recording Studios in central London – since they were unable to book EMI at short notice.

Many Beatles biographers characterise the group&#x27;s post-&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; recording sessions of 1967 as aimless and undisciplined.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris/Mojo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Beatles&#x27; use of psychedelic drugs such as LSD was at its height during that summer and, in author Ian MacDonald&#x27;s view, this resulted in a lack of judgment in their recordings as the band embraced randomness and sonic experimentation. George Martin, the group&#x27;s producer, chose to distance himself from their work at this time, saying that much of the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; recording was &quot;disorganised chaos&quot;. Ken Scott, who became their senior recording engineer during the sessions, recalled, &quot;the Beatles had taken over things so much that I was more their right-hand man than George Martin&#x27;s&quot;.

Early, pre-overdub mixes of some of the film songs were prepared on 16 September, before the Beatles performed the music sequences during a six-day shoot at RAF West Malling, a Royal Air Force base in Kent. The recording sessions continued alongside editing of the film footage, which took place in an editing suite in Soho and was mostly overseen by McCartney. The process led to a struggle between him and Lennon over the film&#x27;s content. The Beatles also recorded &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; for release as a single accompanying the soundtrack record. That his film song &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; was relegated to the B-side of the single, in favour of McCartney&#x27;s pop-oriented &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;, was another source of rancour for Lennon. He later recalled, &quot;I began to submerge.&quot;
During this time, the band&#x27;s commitment to the Maharishi&#x27;s teachings remained strong. Barrow later wrote that Lennon, Harrison and Ringo Starr were &quot;itching&quot; to travel to India and study with their teacher, but they agreed to postpone the trip and complete the film&#x27;s soundtrack and editing. Harrison and Lennon promoted Transcendental Meditation with two appearances on David Frost&#x27;s TV show &quot;The Frost Programme&quot;, and Harrison and Starr visited the Maharishi in Copenhagen. All four band members attended the 17 October memorial service for Epstein, held at the New London Synagogue on Abbey Road, close to EMI Studios, and the 18 October world premiere of &quot;How I Won the War&quot;, a film in which Lennon had a starring role. Recording for &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; was completed on 7 November. That day, the title song was given a new barker-style introduction by McCartney (replacing Lennon&#x27;s effort, which was nevertheless retained in the version used in the film) and an overdub of traffic sounds.

Three pieces of incidental music were recorded but omitted from the soundtrack record. In the case of &quot;Shirley&#x27;s Wild Accordion&quot;, the scene was cut from the film. Featuring an accordion score by arranger Mike Leander, it was performed by Shirley Evans with percussion contributions from Starr and McCartney, and recorded at De Lane Lea Studios in October. &quot;Jessie&#x27;s Dream&quot; was taped privately by the Beatles and copyrighted to McCartney–Starkey–Harrison–Lennon, while the third item was a brief Mellotron piece used to orchestrate the line &quot;The magic is beginning to work&quot; in the film.
===Production techniques and sounds===

In their new songs, the Beatles continued the studio experimentation that had typified &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; and the psychedelic sound they had introduced in 1966 with &quot;Revolver&quot;. Author Mark Hertsgaard highlights &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; as the fulfilment of the band&#x27;s &quot;guiding principle&quot; during the sessions – namely to experiment and be &quot;different&quot;. To satisfy Lennon&#x27;s request that his voice should sound like &quot;it came from the moon&quot;, the engineers gave him a low-quality microphone to sing into and saturated the signal from the preamp microphone. In addition to the song&#x27;s string and horn arrangement, Martin wrote a score for the sixteen backing vocalists (the Mike Sammes Singers), in which their laughter, exaggerated vocalising and other noises evoked the LSD-inspired mood that Lennon sought for the piece. The orchestral arrangement and the vocal score were recorded on a separate four-track tape, which Martin and Scott then manually synchronised with the tape containing the band&#x27;s performance. The track was completed with Lennon overdubbing live radio signals found at random, finally settling on a BBC Third Programme broadcast of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tragedy of King Lear&quot;.

According to musicologist Thomas MacFarlane, &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; shows the Beatles once more &quot;focusing on colour and texture as important compositional elements&quot; and exploring the &quot;aesthetic possibilities&quot; of studio technology. &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot; features extensive use of three studio techniques employed by the Beatles over 1966–67: flanging, an audio delay effect; sound-signal rotation via a Leslie speaker; and (in the stereo mix only) reversed tapes. In the case of the latter technique, a recording of the completed track was played backwards and faded in at key points during the performance, creating an effect whereby the backing vocals appear to answer each line of Harrison&#x27;s lead vocal in the verses. Due to the limits of multitracking, the process of feeding in reversed sounds was carried out live during the final mixing session. A tape loop of decelerated guitar sounds was used on &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot; to create a swooshing bird-like effect towards the end of that song. Lennon and Starr prepared seven minutes&#x27; worth of tape loops as a coda to &quot;Flying&quot;, but this was discarded, leaving the track to end with a 30-second burst of Mellotron sounds.

Although he recognises &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; as the highpoint of the Beatles&#x27; application of sound &quot;colorisation&quot;, musicologist Walter Everett says that the band introduced some effective &quot;new touches&quot; during this period. He highlights the slow guitar tremolo on &quot;Flying&quot;, the combination of female and male vocal chorus, cello glissandi and found sounds on &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;, and the interplay between the lead vocal and violas on &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;. In MacFarlane&#x27;s description, the songs reflect the Beatles&#x27; growing interest in stereo mixes, as &quot;remarkable sonic qualities&quot; are revealed in the placement of sounds across the stereo image, making for a more active listening experience.

==Songs==
===Soundtrack===
&quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; included six tracks, a number that posed a challenge for the Beatles and their UK record company, EMI, as there were too few for an LP album but too many for an EP. One idea considered was to issue an EP that played at 33⅓ rpm, but this would have caused a loss of audio fidelity that was deemed unacceptable. The solution chosen was to issue the music in the innovative format of a double EP. It was the first example of a double EP in Britain.

According to music journalist Rob Chapman, each of the new tracks &quot;represents a distinct facet of the group&#x27;s psychedelic vision&quot;. He gives these as, in order of the EP&#x27;s sequencing: celebration, nostalgia, absurdity, innocence, bliss and dislocation. Musicologist Russell Reising says that the songs variously further the Beatles&#x27; exploration of the thematic links between a psychedelic trip and travelling, and address the relationship between travel and time. Ethnomusicologist David Reck comments that despite the Beatles&#x27; association with Eastern culture at the time, through their championing of the Maharishi, just two of the EP&#x27;s songs directly reflect this interest.

====&quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;====

&quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; was written as the main theme song shortly after McCartney conceived the idea for the film. In Hunter Davies&#x27; contemporary account of the 25 April session, McCartney arrived with the chord structure but only the opening refrain (&quot;Roll up / Roll up for the mystery tour&quot;), necessitating a brainstorming discussion the following day to complete the lyrics. Like &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, the song serves to welcome the audience to the event and uses a trumpet fanfare.

====&quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot;====
&quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot; is a song in the music hall style similar to McCartney&#x27;s &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot; from &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. Its lyrical premise centres on the history of hit songs across generations. He originally offered it for the &quot;Our World&quot; broadcast, but the Beatles favoured Lennon&#x27;s &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; for its social significance. McCartney later said he wrote the song as a production number for &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, where it provides the film&#x27;s closing, Busby Berkeley–style dance sequence. In author Doyle Greene&#x27;s view, the lyrics advocate generational understanding in the manner of &quot;She&#x27;s Leaving Home&quot; but, unlike in the latter song, to the point of &quot;maternal authority and youth compliance&quot;, and contrast sharply with the confrontational message of the EP&#x27;s next track.

====&quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;====
&quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; was Lennon&#x27;s main contribution to the film and was primarily inspired by both his experiences with LSD and Lewis Carroll&#x27;s poem &quot;The Walrus and the Carpenter&quot; from &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;. The impetus came from a fan letter Lennon received from a student at his former high school, Quarry Bank, in which he learned that an English literature teacher there was interpreting the Beatles&#x27; lyrics in a scholarly fashion. Amused by this, Lennon set out to write a lyric that would confound analysis from scholars and music journalists. In addition to drawing on Carroll&#x27;s imagery and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;, he reworked a nursery rhyme from his school days, and referenced Edgar Allan Poe and (in the vocalised &quot;googoogajoob&quot;s) James Joyce. Author Jonathan Gould describes &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; as &quot;the most overtly &#x27;literary&#x27; song the Beatles would ever record&quot;, while MacDonald deems it &quot;[Lennon&#x27;s] ultimate anti-institutional rant – a damn-you-England tirade that blasts education, art, culture, law, order, class, religion, and even sense itself&quot;.

====&quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot;====
McCartney wrote the melody for &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot; during the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; sessions but the lyrics remained incomplete until September. The song is about a solitary figure who is not understood by others, but is actually wise. In Everett&#x27;s interpretation, the fool&#x27;s innocence leaves him adrift from and unwilling to engage with a judgmental society. McCartney said the idea was inspired by the Dutch design collective the Fool, who derived their name from the tarot card of the same name, and possibly by the Maharishi. A piano ballad, its musical arrangement includes flutes and bass harmonicas, and a recorder solo played by McCartney. The song&#x27;s sequence in &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; involved a dedicated film shoot, featuring McCartney on a hillside overlooking Nice, in the South of France, which added considerably to the film&#x27;s production costs.

====&quot;Flying&quot;====
&quot;Flying&quot; is an instrumental and the first Beatles track to be credited to all four members of the band. It was titled &quot;Aerial Tour Instrumental&quot; until late in the sessions and appears in the film over footage of clouds and outtakes from Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;. The track&#x27;s musical structure is similar to a 12-bar blues and set to what music historian Richie Unterberger terms a &quot;rock–soul rhythm&quot;. It consists of three rounds of the 12-bar pattern, led first by guitars, then Mellotron and organ, and finally a chanted vocal chorus.

====&quot;Blue Jay Way&quot;====
&quot;Blue Jay Way&quot; was named after a street in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles where Harrison stayed in August 1967. The lyrics document his wait for music publicist Derek Taylor to find his way to Blue Jay Way through the fog-ridden hills, while Harrison struggled to stay awake after the flight from London to Los Angeles. MacDonald describes the song as Harrison&#x27;s &quot;farewell to psychedelia&quot;, since his subsequent visit to Haight-Ashbury led to him seeking an alternative to hallucinogenic drugs and opened the way to the Beatles&#x27; embrace of Transcendental Meditation. The composition marked a rare example of the Lydian mode being used in pop music and, in Reck&#x27;s view, incorporates scalar elements from the Carnatic raga Ranjani.

===Singles===
Because EPs were not popular in the US at the time, Capitol Records released the soundtrack as an LP by adding tracks from that year&#x27;s non-album singles. The first side contained the film soundtrack songs, although in a different order from the EP. Side two contained both sides of the band&#x27;s two singles released up to this point in 1967, along with &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;, which was issued as a single backed by &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;. Three of the previously released tracks – &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, &quot;Baby, You&#x27;re a Rich Man&quot; and &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; – were presented in duophonic (or &quot;processed&quot;) stereo sound on Capitol&#x27;s stereo version of the LP.

The Beatles were displeased about this reconfiguration, since they believed that tracks released on a single should not then appear on a new album. Lennon referred to the LP at a May 1968 press conference to promote Apple Corps in the US, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s not an album, you see. It turned into an album over here, but it was just [meant to be] the music from the film.&quot;

==Artwork and packaging==

As part of the unusual format, the Beatles decided to package the two EPs in a gatefold sleeve with a 24-page booklet. The record&#x27;s cover featured a photo of the Beatles in animal costumes, taken during the shoot for &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;, and marked the first time that the band members&#x27; faces were not visible on one of their EP or LP releases. The booklet contained song lyrics, photographer John Kelly&#x27;s colour stills from the filming, and colour story illustrations in the comic strip style by &quot;Beatles Book&quot; cartoonist Bob Gibson. It was compiled by Barrow, with input from McCartney. Of the double-EP package, film studies academic Bob Neaverson later commented: &quot;While it certainly solved the song quota problem, one suspects that it was also partly born of the Beatles&#x27; pioneering desire to experiment with conventional formats and packaging.&quot; In line with the band&#x27;s wishes, the packaging reinforced the idea that the release was a film soundtrack rather than a follow-up to &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, which was still receiving critical plaudits and enjoying commercial success in late 1967.

When preparing the US release, Capitol enlarged the photos and illustrations to LP size inside a gatefold album sleeve. The cover design was done by John Van Hamersveld, the head of Capitol&#x27;s art department, working from the artwork sent from EMI in London. He recalled that Capitol&#x27;s vice-president of distribution was concerned about how to market a record where the Beatles&#x27; faces were hidden behind their costumes, since cover portraits had been key to the success of the group&#x27;s US LPs. Van Hamersveld therefore augmented the &quot;underground graphic&quot; cover image with a design concept that highlighted the songs.

In Gould&#x27;s description, the LP cover &quot;had the garish symmetry of a movie poster&quot; through the combination of the Beatles&#x27; animal costumes, the &quot;rainbow&quot; film logo, and the song titles rendered in art-deco lettering &quot;amid a border of op-art clouds&quot;. The artwork was later cited by proponents of the Paul is dead theory as evidence of McCartney&#x27;s alleged demise in November 1966. Clues included the appearance of a black walrus (Lennon in costume) on the front cover, which was thought to signify death in some areas of Scandinavia; McCartney wearing a black carnation in an image from the &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot; film sequence; and, on another page from the booklet, McCartney seated behind a sign reading &quot;I WaS&quot;.

==Release==
In advance of the EP&#x27;s release, Lennon promoted the soundtrack in an interview on the BBC Radio 1 show &quot;Where It&#x27;s At&quot;. Lennon discussed the studio effects used on the new songs, including &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;, which received its only contemporary airing on BBC radio when disc jockey Kenny Everett played it as part of the interview broadcast on 25 November 1967. According to author John Winn, because the lyrics included the word &quot;knickers&quot;, the song &quot;remained unofficially prohibited from BBC playlists for the time being&quot;. &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; was also banned from American airwaves.

&quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; was issued in the UK on 8 December, the day after the opening of their Apple Boutique in central London, and just over two weeks before the film was broadcast by BBC Television. It retailed at the sub-£1 price of 19s 6d (equivalent to £ today). It was their thirteenth British EP and only their second, after 1964&#x27;s &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot;, to consist of entirely new recordings. With the broadcast rights for North America assigned to NBC, the Capitol album was scheduled for a mid-December release. The company instead issued the album on 27 November. In Britain only, the film was then screened on Boxing Day to an audience estimated at 15 million. It was savaged by reviewers, giving the Beatles their first public and critical failure. As a result, the American broadcaster withdrew its bid for the local rights, and the film was not shown there at the time.
In its first three weeks on sale in the US, &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; set a record for the highest initial sales of any Capitol LP. It was number 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top LPs listings for eight weeks at the start of 1968 and remained in the top 200 until 8 February 1969. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1969.

In Britain, the EP peaked at number 2 on the national singles chart, behind &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;, and became the Beatles&#x27; ninth release to top the national EPs chart compiled by &quot;Record Retailer&quot;. In the UK singles listings compiled by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; magazine, it replaced &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; at number 1 for a week. The EP sold over 500,000 copies there. Walter Everett highlights its UK chart performance as a significant achievement, given that the EP&#x27;s retail price far exceeded that of the singles with which it was competing at the time. As an American import, the Capitol album release peaked on the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; LPs chart at number 31 in January 1968. In the US, the album sold 1,936,063 copies by 31 December 1967 and 2,373,987 copies by the end of the decade.

According to music historian Clinton Heylin, the release of &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; and of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;, which was the Stones&#x27; answer to &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, inadvertently brought an end to psychedelic pop. Music journalist John Harris cites the critical maligning of the film as the excuse the British authorities were looking for to begin targeting the Beatles, despite the band&#x27;s status as MBE holders, for their wayward influence on youth. Within the Beatles, McCartney&#x27;s role as the group&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; leader, a role he had assumed with Lennon&#x27;s withdrawal before &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, was destabilised as individual creative agendas were increasingly pursued over 1968.

In 1968, jazz musician Bud Shank released the album &quot;Magical Mystery&quot;, which included five of the EP&#x27;s tracks and &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;. &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot; was highly popular among other artists, particularly cabaret performers, and became one of the most covered Lennon–McCartney compositions.
==Critical reception==
===Contemporary reviews===

Reviewing the EP a month before the film&#x27;s screening, Nick Logan of the &quot;NME&quot; enthused that the Beatles were &quot;at it again, stretching pop music to its limits&quot;. He continued: &quot;The four musician-magicians take us by the hand and lead us happily tripping through the clouds, past Lucy in the sky with diamonds and the fool on the hill, into the sun-speckled glades along Blue Jay Way and into the world of Alice in Wonderland ... This is The Beatles out there in front and the rest of us in their wake.&quot; Bob Dawbarn of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; described the EP as &quot;six tracks which no other pop group in the world could begin to approach for originality combined with the popular touch&quot;. In &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, Norman Jopling wrote that, whereas on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; &quot;the effects were chiefly sound and only the album cover was visual&quot;, on &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; &quot;the visual side ... has dominated the music&quot;, such that &quot;Everything from fantasy, children&#x27;s comics, acid (psychedelic) humour is included on the record and in the booklet.&quot;

Among reviews of the American LP, Mike Jahn of &quot;Saturday Review&quot; hailed &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; as the Beatles&#x27; best work yet, superior to &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; in emotion and depth, and &quot;distinguished by its description of the Beatles&#x27; acquired Hindu philosophy and its subsequent application to everyday life&quot;. &quot;Hit Parader&quot; said that &quot;the beautiful Beatles do it again, widening the gap between them and 80 scillion other groups.&quot; Remarking on how the Beatles and their producer &quot;present a supreme example of team work&quot;, the reviewer compared the album with &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; and opined that &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; and &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot; alone &quot;accomplish what the Stones attempted&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was launched in October 1967 with a cover photo of Lennon from &quot;How I Won the War&quot;; in its fourth issue, the magazine&#x27;s review of &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; consisted of a single-sentence quote from him: &quot;There are only about 100 people in the world who understand our music.&quot;

Having been one of the few critics to review &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; unfavourably, Richard Goldstein of &quot;The New York Times&quot; rued that the new songs furthered the gap between true rock values and studio effects, and that the band&#x27;s &quot;fascination with motif&quot; was equally reflected in the elaborate packaging. Goldstein concluded: &quot;Does it sound like heresy to say that the Beatles write material which is literate, courageous, genuine, but spotty? It shouldn&#x27;t. They are inspired posers, but we must keep our heads on their music, not their incarnations.&quot; Rex Reed of &quot;HiFi/Stereo Review&quot; wrote a scathing critique in which he derided the group&#x27;s &quot;farcical, stagnant, helpless bellowing&quot; and &quot;confused musical ideas&quot;. Reed said that exchanging drugs for meditation as their subject matter had left the Beatles &quot;totally divorced from reality&quot;, and he especially ridiculed &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; on an LP he deemed a &quot;platter of phony, pretentious, overcooked tripe&quot;. In his May 1968 column in &quot;Esquire&quot;, Robert Christgau considered three of the new songs to be &quot;disappointing&quot;, among which &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot; &quot;may be the worst song the Beatles have ever recorded&quot;. Christgau still found it a valid album, &quot;for all the singles, which are good music, after all; for the tender camp of &#x27;Your Mother Should Know&#x27;; and especially for Harrison&#x27;s hypnotic &#x27;Blue Jay Way,&#x27; an adaptation of Oriental modes in which everything works, lyrics included&quot;.

===Retrospective assessments===
In his review for &quot;Blender&quot;, Paul Du Noyer writes: &quot;They lost the plot with their dopey TV film, but 1967 was still their zenith as songwriters. For once, the U.S. release went better than the British original ... The result was simply the best set of Beatles tunes so far on a single disc.&quot; AllMusic critic Richie Unterberger opines that the psychedelia is &quot;even spacier in parts&quot; than on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, but &quot;there&#x27;s no vague overall conceptual/thematic unity to the material, which has made &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; suffer slightly in comparison. Still, the music is mostly great.&quot; Scott Plagenhoef of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; describes the EP-exclusive tracks as &quot;low key marvels&quot;. He says that while the album lacks a progressive quality from the band&#x27;s previous work, it &quot;is quietly one of the most rewarding listens in the Beatles&#x27; career&quot;, and the mixed nature of the collection &quot;matters little when the music itself is so incredible&quot;.

Writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Rob Sheffield says that the album is &quot;a lot goopier than &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, though lifted by the cheerful &#x27;All You Need Is Love&#x27; and the ghostly &#x27;Strawberry Fields Forever.&#x27; Her Majesty the Queen had the best comment: &#x27;The Beatles are turning awfully funny, aren&#x27;t they?&#x27;&quot; Neil McCormick of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; writes that the combination of soundtrack and singles means the album lacks cohesion, but he still finds it an &quot;intriguing psychedelic companion piece&quot; to &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; and highlights &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; as a &quot;mad, surrealist epic ... in which Lennon takes the concept of lyrical and musical nonsense and just explodes it all over the speakers&quot;. Reviewing for &quot;Mojo&quot; in 2002, Charles Shaar Murray said &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; was the Beatles album he turned to most often following Harrison&#x27;s death the previous year and that it evokes an era &quot;when society still seemed to be opening up rather than closing down&quot;. Given its experimental qualities, he deemed it &quot;the other half of the double-album that &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; should have been&quot;. Writing for &quot;Paste&quot;, Mark Kemp views &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; as a work of &quot;symphonic sprawl&quot; that marks the culmination of a five-year period in which the Beatles led pop music&#x27;s expansion into world music, psychedelia, avant-pop and electronica, while bringing the genre a bohemian audience for the first time. He says that while the album resembles a &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; &quot;Part 2&quot;, it &quot;breathes easier and includes stronger songs&quot; and benefits from the lack of a &quot;forced concept&quot;.

Among Beatles biographers, Jonathan Gould says the album&#x27;s resequencing of the EP songs heightens the project&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Pepper&quot; redux&quot; quality, with its opening title track recalling &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; and &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; providing the &quot;weighty end&quot; in the manner of &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;. He similarly views &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot; as the &quot;Fixing a Hole&quot;–style &quot;cool, contemplative ballad&quot;, just as Harrison provides &quot;another droning epic&quot; and McCartney offers &quot;another archaic number&quot; in &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot;, which he finds a &quot;halfhearted attempt at satiric nostalgia&quot;. Chris Ingham, writing in &quot;The Rough Guide to the Beatles&quot;, says that the soundtrack&#x27;s reputation suffers from its association with the film&#x27;s failure, yet while three of the tracks are rightly overlooked, &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot;, &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot; and &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; remain &quot;essential Beatlemusic&quot;.

&quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; was ranked at number 138 in Paul Gambaccini&#x27;s 1978 book &quot;Critic&#x27;s Choice: Top 200 Albums&quot;, based on submissions from a panel of 47 critics and broadcasters. In 2000, it was voted 334th in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In his book &quot;The Ambient Century&quot;, Mark Prendergast describes it as &quot;the most psychedelic album The Beatles ever released&quot; and, along with &quot;Revolver&quot;, an &quot;essential purchase&quot;. He ranks the album at number 27 in his list of &quot;Twentieth-century Ambience – the Essential 100 Recordings&quot;. In 2007, the album was included in Robert Christgau and David Fricke&#x27;s &quot;40 Essential Albums of 1967&quot; for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Christgau wrote in an accompanying essay: &quot;Because it begins with the lame theme to their worst movie and the sappy &#x27;Fool on the Hill,&#x27; few realize that this serves up three worthy obscurities forthwith – bet Beck knows the sour-and-sweet instrumental &#x27;Flying&#x27; by heart. Then it A/Bs three fabulous singles.&quot;

==Release history==
In 1968 and 1971, true-stereo mixes were created for &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, &quot;Baby, You&#x27;re a Rich Man&quot; and &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;, which allowed the first true-stereo version of the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; LP to be issued in West Germany in 1971. In the face of continued public demand for the imported Capitol album, EMI officially released the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; LP in the UK in November 1976, although it used the Capitol fake-stereo masters of the same three singles tracks. In 1981, the soundtrack EP was reissued in both mono and stereo as part of Parlophone&#x27;s 15-disc box set &quot;The Beatles EP Collection&quot;.

When standardising the Beatles&#x27; releases for the worldwide compact disc release in 1987, EMI issued &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; as a full-length album in true stereo. It was the only example of an American reconfigured release being favoured over the EMI version. The inclusion of the 1967 singles on CD with this album meant that the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; CD would be of comparable length to the band&#x27;s CDs of its original albums, and that the additional five tracks originally featured on the American LP would not need to be included on &quot;Past Masters&quot;, a two-volume compilation designed to accompany the initial CD album releases and provide all non-album tracks (mostly singles) on CD format.

The 2012 remastered &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; DVD entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Music Video chart at number 1. The CD album climbed to number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Catalog Albums chart, number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Soundtrack albums chart, and re-entered at number 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart for the week ending 27 October 2012.

<text>Christopher George Latore Wallace (May 21, 1972 – March 9, 1997), better known by his stage names the Notorious B.I.G., Biggie Smalls, and Biggie, was an American rapper. Rooted in the New York rap scene and gangsta rap traditions, he is widely considered one of the greatest rappers of all time. Wallace became known for his distinctive, laidback lyrical delivery, offsetting his lyrics&#x27; often grim content. His music was usually semi-autobiographical, telling of hardship and criminality but also of debauchery and celebration.

Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York City, Wallace was the first artist to sign with Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs&#x27;s Bad Boy Records in 1993. That same year, he gained recognition for his guest appearances on other artists&#x27; singles. His debut studio album, &quot;Ready to Die&quot; (1994), received widespread critical acclaim and included signature tracks &quot;Juicy&quot; and &quot;Big Poppa&quot;. This album made him the central figure in East Coast hip hop, helping to restore New York&#x27;s prominence at a time when the West Coast was dominating the genre. In 1995, Wallace was named Rapper of the Year at the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards. That same year, Wallace and his protégé group, Junior M.A.F.I.A.—which included longtime friends like Lil&#x27; Kim—released their debut album, &quot;Conspiracy&quot; (1995).

While working on his second album in 1995, he became embroiled in the growing East Coast–West Coast hip hop feud. After Tupac Shakur was murdered in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in September 1996, rumors circulated suggesting that criminal elements connected to the Bad Boy camp might have been involved, given Wallace&#x27;s public feud with Shakur. In March 1997, six months after Shakur&#x27;s death, Wallace was also killed in a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles by an unknown assailant. Two weeks later, his second album, &quot;Life After Death&quot; (1997), was issued as a posthumous double album; it debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, yielded two &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-number one singles: &quot;Hypnotize&quot; and &quot;Mo Money Mo Problems&quot; (featuring Puff Daddy and Mase), and received diamond certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

With two posthumous albums released, Wallace&#x27;s certified U.S. sales exceed 28million copies, including 21million albums. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called him the &quot;greatest rapper that ever lived&quot;, and, in 2015, &quot;Billboard&quot; named him the greatest rapper of all time. &quot;The Source&quot; magazine named him the greatest rapper of all time in its 150th issue. In 2006, MTV ranked him at No. 3 on their list of The Greatest MCs of All Time, calling him possibly &quot;the most skillful ever on the mic&quot;. In 2020, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

== Life and career ==
=== 1972–1991: Early life ===
Christopher George Latore Wallace was born at Cumberland Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, on May 21, 1972. Wallace was the only child of Jamaican immigrant parents; his mother Voletta Wallace (1947–2025), was a preschool teacher, while his father Selwyn George Latore (1933–1996), was a welder and politician. At the age of five, he began attending preschool at Quincy-Lexington Open Door Day Care Center, where he was already bigger than most of the other children. Three months before Wallace&#x27;s third birthday, his father left the family, leaving his mother to raise him while working two jobs. He grew up in Brooklyn&#x27;s Clinton Hill, near the border of Bedford-Stuyvesant. As a child, Wallace spent most of his time on Fulton Street, where he was introduced to drug dealing, alcoholism, and gambling. Raised as a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness, Wallace attended St. Peter Claver Church in Brooklyn, graduating from the parish elementary school in 1982. He excelled in English at Queen of All Saints Middle School. He attended Westinghouse High School, a public school attended by several future celebrities, including Jay-Z and Busta Rhymes.

While attending Westinghouse High School, Wallace weighed , which earned him the nickname &quot;Big&quot;. During this period, his interest in drug dealing intensified, being influenced by the crack epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s. A friend introduced him to buying and selling marijuana when he was around the age of twelve. Having grown up in a strict household, Wallace concealed the money he earned on the roof of his apartment. His mother had no idea about this; she only discovered it when he was twenty years old. Despite being an honor student, Wallace dropped out of school at the age of sixteen due to his growing interest in drug dealing. In 1989, he was arrested in Brooklyn on weapons charges and sentenced to five years of probation. The following year, he was arrested for violating that probation. A year later, Wallace was arrested in North Carolina for dealing crack cocaine and spent nine months in jail before making bail.

Early in his life, Wallace was influenced by black artists like the Dramatics, Blue Magic, Teddy Pendergrass, Stevie Wonder, and Marvin Gaye. He was also well acquainted with the performances of Parliament-Funkadelic, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Kool &amp; the Gang, and Chic. During visits to Jamaica he was influenced by its prominent native genres, including jazz, reggae, soul, and mento. As Wallace entered adolescence, he started listening to artists like Run-DMC and LL Cool J. Wallace adopted the stage name CWest and formed the Techniques with his two friends Michael Bynum and Hubert Sams. Wallace met Donald Harrison, a saxophonist from New Orleans, and the Techniques worked on their first songs together at Harrison&#x27;s home studio. As the trio grew older, their interests shifted; Sams became focused on high school football, while Bynum lost interest in the music industry. Wallace adopted his second stage name, Biggie Smalls, from Calvin Lockhart&#x27;s character in the 1975 film &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot;.

=== 1991–1994: Early career and first child ===
After his release from jail, Wallace produced his first demo tape in 1991 called &quot;Microphone Murderer&quot; with a disc jockey named 50 Grand. Although Wallace reportedly had little ambition for the tape, local disc jockey Mister Cee, known for his work with Big Daddy Kane and the Juice Crew, discovered and promoted it. Mister Cee sent the tape to Matteo Capoluongo, an editor at &quot;The Source&quot; magazine, who featured the track in the &quot;Unsigned Hype&quot; section in March 1992, a chart dedicated to showcasing promising rappers. That year, Wallace started gaining exposure; after reading the &quot;Unsigned Hype&quot; section, Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs arranged to meet him. Combs connected Wallace to rhyme on the remix of Mary J. Blige&#x27;s hit &quot;Real Love&quot;.

In 1992, Wallace&#x27;s girlfriend, Jan Jackson, became pregnant, and he was signed to Uptown Records in March by Combs. Wallace&#x27;s first chance to record a solo track for Uptown Records, rather than featuring on another artist&#x27;s remix, came in 1993 when Combs was creating a song for the soundtrack of the hip-hop comedy &quot;Who&#x27;s the Man?&quot;. The song was &quot;Party and Bullshit&quot;, produced by the Brooklyn-based Easy Mo Bee. The song was heavily inspired by &quot;When the Revolution Comes&quot; by the Last Poets, which uses sarcasm, frustration, and humor to critique young Black people&#x27;s lack of seriousness in the struggle for equality. In the track, vocalist Umar Bin Hassan delivers lines like &quot;niggas will party and bullshit, and party and bullshit&quot;. Development on Wallace&#x27;s first album began at Capoluongo&#x27;s apartment in late 1992. Wallace appeared on Heavy D &amp; the Boyz&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Blue Funk&quot;, on the track &quot;A Buncha Niggas&quot;.

In July 1993—a month before Wallace&#x27;s first child was born—Combs was fired from Uptown Records by his mentor Andre Harrell, resulting in the loss of access to the songs recorded at that time. Jan gave birth to T&#x27;yanna Dream Wallace on August 8, 1993. Wallace promised his daughter &quot;everything she wanted,&quot; believing that if he had experienced the same support in his own childhood, he would have graduated at the top of his class. Soon after he was fired, Combs started his own record, Bad Boy Records, and took Wallace with him. Combs discovered that Wallace continued dealing drugs and insisted he stop. When Wallace found out the name Biggie Smalls was already taken, he adopted a new moniker, settling on the Notorious B.I.G. Wallace explained that the acronym &quot;B.I.G.&quot; stood for &quot;Business Instead of Game&quot;. Combs and Clive Davis, then CEO of Arista Records, reached an agreement in which Davis provided Combs with a $1.5 million advance and full creative control. Combs promptly used the money to repurchase the tracks recorded for Wallace&#x27;s album from Harrell.

The &quot;Real Love&quot; remix single was followed by a remix of a Mary J. Blige song, &quot;What&#x27;s the 411?&quot;. Wallace&#x27;s success continued, though to a lesser extent, with remixes of Neneh Cherry&#x27;s &quot;Buddy X&quot; and reggae artist Super Cat&#x27;s &quot;Dolly My Baby&quot; in 1993. In July 1994, Wallace appeared alongside LL Cool J and Busta Rhymes on a remix of Craig Mack&#x27;s track &quot;Flava in Ya Ear&quot;, which reached No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Flava in Ya Ear&quot; reached No. 1 on the rap chart for three consecutive weeks.

=== 1994: &quot;Ready to Die&quot; and marriage to Faith Evans ===

On August 4, 1994, Wallace married R&amp;B singer Faith Evans, whom he first met in June 1994 at a promotional photoshoot. Wallace and Mo Bee originally wanted &quot;Machine Gun Funk&quot; as the upcoming album&#x27;s first single due to its &quot;funky, upbeat&quot; sound, but Combs preferred a &quot;smoother&quot; sound for the release. The upcoming album&#x27;s first song to be released was the title track, &quot;Ready to Die&quot;, followed by &quot;Gimme the Loot&quot;, &quot;Things Done Changed&quot;, &quot;Machine Gun Funk&quot;, and &quot;Warning&quot;. Five days after his marriage, Wallace had his first pop chart success as a solo artist with double A-side, &quot;Juicy / Unbelievable&quot;, which reached No. 27 as the lead single to his debut album.

Recorded at the Hit Factory between 1993 and 1994, Wallace released his debut studio album, &quot;Ready to Die&quot;, on September 13, 1994. Inspired by Snoop Dogg&#x27;s bold, violent, and darkly humorous hit records, Wallace sought to create a similar style with &quot;Ready to Die&quot;, infused with an East Coast influence. Wallace originally wanted to name the album &quot;The Teflon Don&quot;, drawing inspiration from John Gotti, who was then making headlines for his ability to avoid legal troubles. Combs disagreed, arguing that the title should make an impact in a way that would &quot;represent for the masses&quot;. Wallace agreed to follow Combs&#x27; decision, and the two conceived the name &quot;Ready to Die&quot;.

&quot;Ready to Die&quot; reached No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, sold 500,000 copies in its first week, and certified four times platinum. The album shifted attention back to East Coast hip-hop at a time when West Coast hip-hop dominated U.S. charts. It received positive reviews upon release and has been widely praised in retrospect. In addition to &quot;Juicy&quot;, the album produced two other hit singles: the platinum-selling &quot;Big Poppa&quot;, which topped the U.S. rap chart and &quot;One More Chance&quot;, which sold onemillion copies in 1995 (the year of its release). Busta Rhymes recalled seeing Wallace handing out copies of &quot;Ready to Die&quot; from his home, which the former saw as &quot;his way of marketing himself&quot;. In 1994, Wallace formed the hip-hop group Junior M.A.F.I.A., which included many of his childhood friends, such as Lil&#x27; Kim and Lil&#x27; Cease. The name is a backronym for &quot;Masters at Finding Intelligent Attitudes&quot;.

Around the time of the album&#x27;s release, Wallace formed a friendship with fellow rapper Tupac Shakur in Los Angeles. Lil&#x27; Cease remembered the two as being very close, often traveling together when they were not working. He noted that Wallace frequently visited Shakur&#x27;s home, and they spent time together whenever Shakur was in California or Washington, D.C. Yukmouth, an Oakland emcee, stated that Wallace&#x27;s style was influenced by Shakur. Wallace also befriended basketball player Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. O&#x27;Neal said they were introduced during a listening session for &quot;Gimme the Loot&quot;; Wallace mentioned him in the lyrics and attracted O&#x27;Neal to his music. O&#x27;Neal requested a collaboration with Wallace, which resulted in the song &quot;You Can&#x27;t Stop the Reign&quot;. According to Combs, Wallace would not collaborate with &quot;anybody he didn&#x27;t really respect&quot; and that Wallace paid O&#x27;Neal his respect by &quot;shouting him out&quot;. In 2015, Daz Dillinger, a frequent collaborator with Shakur, said that he and Wallace were &quot;cool&quot;, with Wallace traveling to meet him to smoke cannabis and record two songs.

=== 1995: Collaboration with Michael Jackson, Junior M.A.F.I.A. success and coastal feud ===
Junior M.A.F.I.A. began working on their debut studio album in 1994. On August 29, 1995, &quot;Conspiracy&quot; was released via Undeas Recordings. It achieved gold certification and sold over 500,000 copies. The first single, &quot;Player&#x27;s Anthem&quot;, features Wallace, Lil&#x27; Kim, and Lil&#x27; Cease, and was produced by Clark Kent. The third single, &quot;Get Money&quot;, a battle-of-the-sexes track featuring Wallace and Lil&#x27; Kim, became their most popular song. &quot;Player&#x27;s Anthem&quot; and &quot;Get Money&quot; also earned gold and platinum status, respectively. Wallace continued collaborating with R&amp;B artists, working with groups like 112 on &quot;Only You&quot; and Total on &quot;Can&#x27;t You See&quot;, both of which reached the top 20 on the Hot 100. By the end of the year, Wallace had become the top-selling male solo artist and rapper on both the U.S. pop and R&amp;B charts. In July 1995, Wallace appeared on the cover of &quot;The Source&quot; with the caption &quot;The King of New York Takes Over,&quot; a nod to his alias Frank White, inspired by the character from the 1990 film &quot;King of New York&quot;. At &quot;The Source&quot; Awards in August 1995, he won Best New Artist, Lyricist of the Year, and Live Performer of the Year, while his debut album was named Album of the Year. He was also honored as Rap Artist of the Year at the &quot;Billboard&quot; Awards.

In 1995, Wallace became embroiled in the East Coast–West Coast hip-hop rivalry, which involved his now-former friend, Shakur. In an April 1995 interview with &quot;Vibe&quot; while serving time in Clinton Correctional Facility, Shakur accused Harrell, Combs, and Wallace of having prior knowledge of a robbery on November 30, 1994, during which he was shot five times and lost thousands of dollars worth of jewelry. They denied any involvement. Wallace stated, &quot;I had nothing to do with that, it just happened to be a coincidence that he was in the studio. He couldn&#x27;t really say who really had something to do with it at the time, so he just kind of leaned the blame on me&quot;. In 2012, Dexter Isaac, who was serving a life sentence for unrelated crimes, claimed responsibility for the attack on Shakur that night, stating that the robbery was orchestrated by entertainment executive and former drug trafficker James Rosemond. After his release from prison, Shakur signed with Death Row Records in October 1995. This made Bad Boy Records and Death Row business rivals, further escalating the conflict between Shakur and Wallace.

In October 1995, Wallace revealed that he still had not received any earnings from &quot;Ready to Die&quot;, despite the album having sold twomillion copies at the time. With each CD priced at $15 (), the album should have generated approximately $30 million ($million in ) in revenue. Amid the rivalry between Wallace and Shakur, many speculated that &quot;Who Shot Ya?&quot;, released in late February 1995 as a secondary B-side to &quot;Big Poppa&quot;, was intended to taunt Shakur. According to Lil&#x27; Cease, the song was not intended to be a comment on the shooting, stating, &quot;He knew that song wasn&#x27;t about him[...] he was around at that time&quot;. Lil&#x27; Cease stated that the song was an introduction for Mary J. Blige&#x27;s second album, however, &quot;the shit was too hard, so Big kept it and said, &#x27;I&#x27;m gonna put it out&#x27;&quot;.
In June 1995, Wallace guest appeared with pop singer Michael Jackson on the album &quot;&quot;, providing vocals for the song &quot;This Time Around&quot;. Lil&#x27; Cease claimed that when Wallace met Michael Jackson, he was made to stay behind, with Wallace explaining that he didn’t &quot;trust Michael with kids&quot; due to the 1993 child sexual abuse allegations against Jackson. The engineer John Van Nest recalled that Wallace was excited to meet Jackson and was nearly brought to tears when it happened. Wallace began recording his second studio album in late 1995, working on it over the course of eighteen months in New York City, Trinidad, and Los Angeles. The recording process was disrupted by injuries, legal issues, and the publicized hip-hop feud between Wallace and Shakur.

=== 1996: More arrests, accusations regarding Shakur&#x27;s death and second child ===
In 1996, Lil&#x27; Kim became pregnant with Wallace&#x27;s child while the two were having a love affair, but she later decided to abort it. Wallace also started a relationship with Charli Baltimore, a Philadelphia native who portrayed Evans in the &quot;Get Money&quot; music video. Although Wallace shared his plans to include her in a supergroup called the Commission, she was aware that she was not the only woman in his life. On March 23, 1996, Wallace was arrested outside a Manhattan nightclub for chasing and threatening two fans who were asking for autographs, smashing the windows of their taxi, and punching one of them. He pleaded guilty to second-degree harassment and was sentenced to 100 hours of community service. Later that year, he was arrested at his home in Teaneck, New Jersey, on drug and weapons possession charges.

At the Soul Train Music Awards in 1996, &quot;One More Chance (Remix)&quot; was nominated for Song of the Year and received the R&amp;B/Soul or Rap Song of the Year award in the same year. In June 1996, Shakur released &quot;Hit &#x27;Em Up&quot;. A diss track directed towards Wallace and other East Coast rappers, Shakur claimed to have had an affair with Evans, who was estranged from Wallace at the time, and accused Wallace of copying his style and image. Described as &quot;manic&quot;, &quot;Hit &#x27;Em Up&quot; disses Wallace, Combs, and their associates, including Junior M.A.F.I.A., Evans, and Bad Boy Records. In 1996, Wallace collaborated with rising rapper Jay-Z on his debut album, &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot;, recording a duet titled &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s Finest&quot;. The track used humor to address speculation surrounding Wallace and Shakur: &quot;If Faith has twins, she&#x27;ll probably have two Pacs. Get it? Tu... Pac&#x27;s.&quot; According to Wallace, humor had always been his way of coping with hardship since elementary school, explaining, &quot;I gotta make jokes about it [...] I can&#x27;t be the [guy] running around all serious&quot;.

On September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot four times in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas and died six days later. Because of Shakur&#x27;s accusations in his records, Wallace, along with other New York rappers like Mobb Deep, Capone, and Noreaga, became suspects in his murder. In a 2002 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; series titled &quot;Who Killed Tupac Shakur?&quot;, journalist Chuck Philips reported, based on police reports and multiple sources, that the shooting was carried out by the Southside Crips, a Compton gang, seeking revenge for a beating Shakur had allegedly inflicted earlier that day. The report also claimed that Wallace had financed the gun used in the shooting. The night Shakur died, Wallace called Evans in tears; Evans recalled that &quot;he was in shock[...] and it&#x27;s fair to say he was probably afraid&quot;. Wallace expressed regret over Shakur&#x27;s death but declined to attend his funeral when asked by a friend. He explained his decision by saying, &quot;[Shakur] made my life miserable[...] he told lies, fucked with my marriage, [and] turned [my] fans against me&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; editor Mark Duvoisin stated that &quot;Philips&#x27; story has withstood all challenges to its accuracy,[...] [and] remains the definitive account of the Shakur slaying&quot;. Wallace&#x27;s family denied the report, providing documents that claimed he was in New Jersey at the time of the incident. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the documents inconclusive, stating:

The pages purport to be three computer printouts from Daddy&#x27;s House, indicating that Wallace was in the studio recording a song called &quot;Nasty Boy&quot; on the night Shakur was shot. They indicate that Wallace &quot;wrote half the session&quot;, was &quot;in and out/sat around&quot; and &quot;laid down a ref&quot;, shorthand for a reference vocal, the equivalent of a first take. But nothing indicates when the documents were created. And Louis Alfred, the recording engineer listed on the sheets, said in an interview that he remembered recording the song with Wallace in a late-night session, not during the day. He could not recall the date of the session but said it was likely not the night Shakur was shot. &quot;We would have heard about it&quot;, Mr. Alfred said.

Wayne Barrow, Wallace&#x27;s co-manager at the time, stated that Wallace was recording the track &quot;Nasty Girl&quot; on the night Shakur was shot. Shortly after Shakur&#x27;s death, Wallace met with Snoop Dogg, who recalled that Wallace played him the song &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Gotta Die&quot;, which mentioned Snoop Dogg. During their meeting, Wallace expressed that he never hated Shakur. During the recording of his second album, &quot;Life After Death&quot;, Wallace and Lil&#x27; Cease were arrested for public marijuana use, resulting in the repossession of their car. Wallace opted to rent a Chevrolet Lumina rental SUV, despite Lil&#x27; Cease&#x27;s concerns about its faulty brakes. The car was ultimately crashed into a rail, breaking Wallace&#x27;s left leg and fracturing Lil&#x27; Cease&#x27;s jaw. Wallace spent months in the hospital, initially confined to a wheelchair, later relying on a cane (which he used until his death), and undergoing therapy. Despite his hospitalization, he continued working on the album, referencing the accident in &quot;Long Kiss Goodnight&quot; with the line, &quot;Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be / Til Lil&#x27; Cease crippled me&quot;.

On October 29, 1996, Evans gave birth to Wallace&#x27;s son, Christopher &quot;C.J.&quot; Wallace Jr. Around this time, Wallace began recording the songs for &quot;Life After Death&quot;. The following month, Junior M.A.F.I.A. member Lil&#x27; Kim released her debut album &quot;Hard Core&quot;. Lil&#x27; Kim described herself as Wallace&#x27;s &quot;biggest fan&quot; and referred to herself as &quot;his pride and joy&quot;. In a 2012 interview, Lil&#x27; Kim revealed that Wallace stopped her from recording a remix of Jodeci&#x27;s single &quot;Love U 4 Life&quot; by locking her in a room. According to Kim, Wallace told her she was &quot;not gonna go do no song with them&quot;, likely due to Jodeci&#x27;s association with Shakur and Death Row Records. While working on &quot;Life After Death&quot;, Wallace began to lose weight, losing around , according to his mother.

=== 1997: Conclusion of development on &quot;Life After Death&quot; ===

In January 1997, Wallace was ordered to pay $41,000 in damages following an incident involving a friend of a concert promoter who claimed Wallace and his entourage beat him following a dispute in May 1995. He faced criminal assault charges for the incident, which remains unresolved, but all robbery charges were dropped. Following the events, Wallace spoke of a desire to focus on his &quot;peace of mind&quot; and his family and friends.

The development of &quot;Life After Death&quot; concluded in January 1997 for a March 25 release. In February 1997, Wallace traveled to California to promote &quot;Life After Death&quot;. On the morning of February 16, Wallace began preparations for the day&#x27;s work. He had arrived in Los Angeles two weeks before the Soul Train Music Awards to film the video for his album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Hypnotize&quot;. The three-day shoot, with a budget of $700,000, was both a promotional effort and a statement of his return to the music scene. &quot;Hypnotize&quot; was officially released on March 4, 1997, debuting at the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number two, just behind Combs&#x27; &quot;Can&#x27;t Nobody Hold Me Down&quot;, and later reached number one.

After production of the video had ended, Wallace recorded his vocals for Combs&#x27; upcoming album, &quot;Hell Up in Harlem&quot;; following the former&#x27;s death, the album was retitled &quot;No Way Out&quot;. He posthumously featured on the tracks &quot;Victory&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s All About the Benjamins&quot;.

== Murder ==
On March 8, 1997, Wallace attended a Soul Train Awards after-party hosted by &quot;Vibe&quot; and Qwest Records at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles, California. Guests included Evans, Aaliyah and members of the Bloods and Crips gangs. With over 2,000 people overcrowding the venue, fire marshals shut it down at 12:35a.m. on March 9. After taking a few photos, Wallace and his crew headed downstairs to the Chevrolet Suburbans they had rented from Budget Rent a Car. He traveled in the front passenger seat alongside associates Damion &quot;D-Roc&quot; Butler, Lil&#x27; Cease, and driver Gregory &quot;G-Money&quot; Young. Combs traveled in the other Suburban with three bodyguards. The two trucks were trailed by a Chevrolet Blazer carrying Bad Boy director of security Paul Offord.

Soon after Wallace&#x27;s Suburban stopped at the red light, a black Chevrolet Impala pulled up to the right side of the car Wallace was in. The Impala&#x27;s driver, described as an unidentified African-American man in a blue suit and bow tie, rolled down his window, drew a blue-steel pistol, and fired at Wallace&#x27;s vehicle. Wallace was struck by four bullets. His entourage rushed him to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where an emergency thoracotomy was performed, but he was pronounced dead at 1:15 a.m. He was twenty-four years old. An autopsy report, released fifteen years after his death, revealed that only the final shot proved fatal. The bullet entered through his right hip, damaging his colon, liver, heart, and left lung before coming to rest in his left shoulder.

Wallace&#x27;s funeral was held at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel in Manhattan on March 18. There were more than 350 mourners at the funeral, including Lil&#x27; Cease, Queen Latifah, Flavor Flav, Mary J. Blige, Lil&#x27; Kim, Run-D.M.C., DJ Kool Herc, Busta Rhymes, Salt-N-Pepa, DJ Spinderella, Foxy Brown, and Sister Souljah. David Dinkins and Clive Davis also attended the funeral. After the funeral, his body was cremated at the Fresh Pond Crematory in Fresh Pond, Queens, and the ashes were given to his family.

== Posthumous releases ==
Sixteen days after his death, Wallace&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Life After Death&quot;, was released on March 25, 1997. The album achieved four-time platinum certification and became the highest-selling release of the year, tying with MC Hammer&#x27;s &quot;Please Hammer Don&#x27;t Hurt &#x27;Em&quot; as one of the best-selling rap albums at the time. &quot;Life After Death&quot; debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It had briefly appeared earlier at No. 176 due to street-date violations. The follow-up single of &quot;Hypnotize&quot;, &quot;Mo Money Mo Problems&quot;, featuring Combs and Mase, became Wallace&#x27;s biggest chart success, reaching No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making him the first artist to achieve two posthumous No. 1 singles. The third single, &quot;Sky&#x27;s the Limit&quot;, featuring the band 112, featured a Spike Jonze-directed video with children portraying Wallace and his contemporaries, including Combs, Lil&#x27; Kim, and Busta Rhymes. In December 1997, &quot;Spin&quot; named Wallace Artist of the Year, with &quot;Hypnotize&quot; as Single of the Year.

In mid-1997, Combs released his debut album, &quot;No Way Out&quot;, which featured Wallace on five tracks, including the single &quot;Victory&quot;. The album&#x27;s most second track, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Missing You&quot;, featuring Combs, Evans, and 112, was dedicated to Wallace&#x27;s memory. At the 1998 Grammy Awards, &quot;Life After Death&quot; and its first two singles—&quot;Hypnotize&quot; and &quot;Mo Money Mo Problems&quot;—received nominations in the rap category. Combs&#x27; &quot;No Way Out&quot; won Best Rap Album, while &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Missing You&quot; won Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group, where Wallace’s &quot;Mo Money Mo Problems&quot; was also nominated. In December 1999, Bad Boy Records released &quot;Born Again&quot;, an album featuring previously unreleased material from Wallace, mixed with new guest appearances from artists he had not collaborated with during his lifetime, including Eminem and Missy Elliott. It spawned two singles: &quot;Dead Wrong&quot; and &quot;Notorious B.I.G.&quot;, released on October 26, 1999, and December 11, 1999, respectively. &quot;Notorious B.I.G.&quot; peaked at No. 82 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Wallace featured on Michael Jackson&#x27;s album &quot;Invincible&quot;, providing lead vocals for the track &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, which was released on October 30, 2001. Wallace&#x27;s vocals appeared on Ashanti&#x27;s &quot;Unfoolish&quot; in 2002, and the track &quot;Runnin&#x27; (Dying to Live)&quot; with Shakur in 2003. &quot;&quot;, a remix album, was released on December 20, 2005, which spawned the singles &quot;Nasty Girl&quot; and &quot;Spit Your Game&quot;. &quot;Nasty Girl&quot; features Combs, Nelly, Jagged Edge and Avery Storm, and &quot;Spit Your Game&quot; includes guest appearances from Krayzie Bone, Twista, and 8Ball &amp; MJG. The album peaked at No. 3 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while &quot;Nasty Girl&quot; peaked at No. 44 on the Hot 100. Combs and Voletta both stated &quot;Duets: The Final Chapter&quot; would be the last album primarily featuring new material. A compilation album, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, was released on March 6, 2007—three days before the tenth anniversary of Wallace&#x27;s death. It included tracks like &quot;Juicy&quot; and &quot;Big Poppa&quot;, but was criticized by AllMusic for not containing hits like &quot;Mo Money Mo Problems&quot; and &quot;Going Back to Cali&quot;. The album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. On May 19, 2017, &quot;The King &amp; I&quot;, a duet album featuring Evans and Wallace, was released, showcasing mostly unreleased tracks. The album peaked at No. 65 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

== Artistry ==
=== Vocals ===

Wallace had the vocal range of a baritone. He typically rapped in a deep tone that &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described as a &quot;thick, jaunty grumble&quot;, which became even deeper on &quot;Life After Death&quot;. Wallace was frequently joined by Combs, who contributed ad libs to his tracks. &quot;The Source&quot; &quot;Unsigned Hype&quot; column described his style as &quot;cool, nasal, and filtered, blessing his own material&quot;. AllMusic noted Wallace’s talent for layering multiple rhymes in rapid succession, while &quot;Time&quot; magazine highlighted his ability to deliver multi-syllabic rhymes smoothly. Scholar Adam Krims described his rhythmic style as &quot;effusive&quot;. Wallace often used onomatopoeic sounds, like &quot;uhhh&quot; at the start of tracks such as &quot;Hypnotize&quot; and &quot;Big Poppa&quot;.

Lateef of Latyrx described Wallace as having &quot;intense and complex flows&quot;, while Onyx&#x27;s Fredro Starr called him &quot;a master of the flow&quot;. Bishop Lamont praised Wallace&#x27;s ability to capture &quot;all the hemispheres of the music&quot;. Wallace often employed single-line rhyme schemes to bring variety and depth to his flow. Big Daddy Kane noted that Wallace did not need an extensive vocabulary to impress; instead, he &quot;just put his words together a slick way, and it worked well for him&quot;. Known for composing lyrics in his head rather than writing them down, Wallace occasionally deviated from his usual style. For example, he sang in a slow falsetto on &quot;Playa Hater&quot; and adapted to the rapid-fire rhyme flow of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony on &quot;Notorious Thugs&quot;.

=== Musical style ===
Wallace&#x27;s lyrics explored a range of themes, including mafioso narratives (&quot;Niggas Bleed&quot;), reflections on his drug-dealing past (&quot;Ten Crack Commandments&quot;), materialistic boasting (&quot;Hypnotize&quot;), humor (&quot;Just Playing (Dreams)&quot;), and romantic experiences (&quot;Me &amp; My Bitch&quot;). In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised him as &quot;one of the few young male songwriters in any pop style writing credible love songs&quot;. In the book &quot;How to Rap&quot;, rapper Guerilla Black highlighted Wallace&#x27;s ability to &quot;glorify the upper echelon&quot; while also making listeners &quot;feel his struggle&quot;. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; journalist Touré, Wallace&#x27;s lyrics &quot;[mixed] autobiographical details about crime and violence with emotional honesty&quot;. Another writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Michel Marriott, noted in 1997 that his lyrics were not entirely autobiographical, as he had a talent for exaggeration to improve his storytelling and sales appeal. Wallace described his debut album, &quot;Ready to Die&quot;, as &quot;a big pie, with each slice indicating a different point in [his] life involving bitches and niggaz[...] from the beginning to the end&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described Ready to Die as a contrast of &quot;bleak&quot; street visions and being &quot;full of high-spirited fun, bringing the pleasure principle back to hip-hop&quot;. AllMusic noted &quot;a sense of doom&quot; in some of his songs, while Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described a thread of paranoia in others. Wallace himself stated that he felt &quot;broke and depressed&quot; while creating his debut album. The final track on &quot;Ready to Die&quot;, &quot;Suicidal Thoughts&quot;, portrays a character contemplating and ultimately committing suicide. On his follow-up album, &quot;Life After Death&quot;, Wallace&#x27;s lyrics delved even &quot;deeper&quot;, as observed by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Krims observed that the record alternates between upbeat, dance-oriented tracks and gritty &quot;reality rap,&quot; reflecting a thematic shift toward a more &quot;pimp&quot; persona. &quot;XXL Mag&quot; noted that Wallace &quot;revamped his image&quot; between the two albums, evolving from a &quot;mid-level hustler&quot; on his debut to a &quot;drug lord&quot; on his sophomore effort. AllMusic credited Wallace&#x27;s storytelling ability as a key factor in the success of &quot;Ready to Die&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Widely regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time, AllMusic described Wallace as &quot;the savior of East Coast hip-hop&quot;. &quot;The Source&quot; named him the greatest rapper of all time in its 150th issue in March 2002. MTV ranked him No. 3 on their 2006 list of The Greatest MCs of All Time, calling him potentially &quot;the most skillful ever on the mic&quot;. In 2012, he was listed on &quot;The Source&quot; Top 50 Lyrical Leaders. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; hailed him as the &quot;greatest rapper that ever lived&quot;, and in 2015, &quot;Billboard&quot; named Wallace the greatest rapper of all time.

Wallace&#x27;s lyrics have been extensively sampled and quoted by artists across genres, including Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Eminem, Lil Wayne, Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Ludacris, and Kanye West. Tributes to him have featured prominently in hip-hop culture, such as at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, where Combs and Snoop Dogg honored him with an orchestral performance of his songs &quot;Juicy&quot; and &quot;Warning&quot;. At the 2005 VH1 Hip Hop Honors, a tribute to Wallace headlined the show. At the same show in 2016, Rich Homie Quan performed &quot;Get Money&quot; but faced criticism after forgetting the lyrics. Before he died, Wallace had begun promoting a clothing line, Brooklyn Mint, focused on plus-sized apparel. The brand became dormant after his death but was relaunched in 2004 by his managers, Mark Pitts and Wayne Barrow, with assistance from Jay-Z. Proceeds benefitted several charitable organizations, including Christopher Wallace Foundation and the Shawn Carter Scholarship Foundation.

The Christopher Wallace Memorial Foundation hosts an annual black-tie charity event, &quot;B.I.G. Night Out&quot;, to raise funds for children&#x27;s educational resources. The acronym &quot;B.I.G.&quot; is repurposed to stand for &quot;Books Instead of Guns&quot;. In Brooklyn, Wallace&#x27;s legacy is preserved through art and community efforts. A mural depicting Wallace can be found on Fulton Street, near his childhood neighborhood. In 2019, the corner of Fulton Street and St. James Place was renamed in his honor. Wallace&#x27;s image and persona inspired elements of the Marvel Cinematic Universe&#x27;s portrayal of Cornell &quot;Cottonmouth&quot; Stokes in the Netflix series &quot;Luke Cage&quot;. In August 2020, Wallace&#x27;s son, C.J. Wallace, released a house remix of &quot;Big Poppa&quot;. 

=== Biopics ===
&quot;Notorious&quot; is a 2009 biographical film depicting the life and career of Wallace, starring rapper Jamal Woolard in the lead role. Directed by George Tillman Jr. and distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, the film was produced by his managers, Combs, Barrow, and Pitts, and his mother, Voletta. On January 16, 2009, the film&#x27;s debut at the Grand 18 theater in Greensboro, North Carolina, was delayed after a shooting occurred in the parking lot before the screening. The film grossed $44.4 million worldwide with a $20 million budget, and received mixed reviews from critics.

In October 2007, open casting calls began for the role of Wallace, attracting actors, rappers, and aspiring performers. Beanie Sigel auditioned but was not selected, while Sean Kingston expressed interest in the role, though producers denied his involvement. Ultimately, Woolard was cast as Wallace, and Wallace&#x27;s son, C. J., portrayed his father. To accompany the film, Bad Boy Records released a soundtrack album on January 13, 2009, featuring many of Wallace&#x27;s prominent tracks such as &quot;Hypnotize&quot; and &quot;Juicy&quot;.

Another biopic, the 2021 Netflix documentary &quot;&quot;, explores Wallace&#x27;s life before fame, and features &quot;unprecedented access granted by the Wallace estate featuring rare access and insights&quot;. It was executive-produced by Voletta and Combs.

<text>A is a hall or place for immersive learning, experiential learning, or meditation. This is traditionally in the field of martial arts. The term literally means &quot;place of the Way&quot; in Japanese.

== History ==
The word &quot;dōjō&quot; originates from Buddhism. Initially, &quot;dōjō&quot; were adjunct to temples and were formal training places for any of the Japanese arts ending in &quot;-dō&quot;, from the Chinese &quot;Dao&quot;, meaning &quot;way&quot; or &quot;path&quot;. Sometimes meditation halls where Zen Buddhists practice &quot;zazen&quot; meditation were called &quot;dōjō&quot;. The alternative term &quot;zen-do&quot; is more specific, and more widely used. European &quot;Sōtō Zen&quot; groups affiliated with the International Zen Association prefer to use &quot;dōjō&quot; instead of &quot;zendo&quot; to describe their meditation halls as did their founding master, Taisen Deshimaru.

In Japan, any facility for physical training, including professional wrestling, may be called a &quot;dōjō&quot;. In the Western world, the term &quot;dōjō&quot; (when related to physical activity) is used exclusively for Japanese martial arts such as &quot;aikidō&quot;, &quot;jūdō&quot;, &quot;karate-dō&quot;, etc.

== In martial arts ==
A proper Japanese martial arts &quot;dōjō&quot; is considered special and is well cared for by its users. Shoes are not worn in a &quot;dōjō&quot;, which is in line with the Japanese custom to keep the premises clean and respectable. In many styles it is traditional to conduct a ritual cleaning (&quot;sōji&quot;; 掃除) of the &quot;dōjō&quot; at the beginning and/or end of each training session. Besides the obvious hygienic benefits of regular cleaning it also serves to reinforce the fact that &quot;dōjō&quot; are supposed to be supported and managed by the student body (or by special students, e.g., uchi-deshi). In some cases, the instructional staff may choose to help the students clean, as a sign of modesty, setting a personal example. In Modern Times, even when a school has a Dojo to train inside of, the training may sometimes be conducted outside, often in parks. 

Many traditional &quot;dōjō&quot; follow a prescribed pattern with &quot;shomen&quot; (正面; &quot;front&quot;) and various entrances that are used based on student and instructor rank laid out precisely. The Shomen is designated as a wall, usually in the North of the Dojo and facing the entrance. Typically students will enter in the lower-left corner of the &quot;dōjō&quot; (in reference to the shomen) with instructors in the upper right corner. Shomen typically has a shelf attached to it. On the shelf would traditionally be presented a miniature Shintō shrine with a sculpture, flower arrangement, or other artifacts. Pictures of past Masters are generally found aside the shrine, and not on it. The term &quot;kamiza&quot; means &quot;place of honor&quot; and a related term, &quot;kamidana&quot; refers to the shrine itself. Other artifacts may be displayed throughout the &quot;dōjō&quot;, such as &quot;kanban&quot; (看板; signboard) that authorize the school in a style or strategy, and items such as &quot;taiko&quot; drums or armor (&quot;Ō-yoroi&quot;). It is not uncommon to find the name of the &quot;dōjō&quot; and the &quot;dōjō kun&quot; (roughly &quot;&quot;dōjō&quot; rules&quot;) displayed prominently at shomen as well. Visitors may have a special place reserved, depending on their rank and station. Weapons and other training gear will normally be found on the back wall.

===&quot;Honbu dōjō&quot;===
A &quot;honbu dōjō&quot; (本部道場) is the central training facility and administrative headquarters of a particular martial arts style.

Some well-known &quot;dōjō&quot; located in Japan are:
:* Kodokan Judo Institute (Judo)
:* Aikikai Hombu Dōjō (Aikido)
:* Noma Dōjō (Kendo)
:* Nakazato Karate Weapons Gym (Shōrin-ryū Shōrinkan)

==Similar Cultural Establishments==
In Japan and other countries, there are additional names for training halls, that are equivalent to &quot;dōjō&quot;. These include the following:

===Japan===
::*Heya (sumo). The name means &#x27;Room&#x27;. As opposed to a Dojo, the Heya is a &#x27;stable&#x27; for professional athletes. It also has its own special rules and etiquette. The attire is minimalistic, and the atmosphere is that of competitive comradery. It is also often a place where the wrestlers live, and not only train. 

===India===
::*Akhara (Indian martial arts)
::*Kalari (kalaripayat) 

===Korea===
::*Dojang (Korean martial arts). This type of martial arts school is fairly similar to the Japanese variety. 

===Indonesia===
::*Gelanggang (silat Melayu)
::* Sasaran (pencak silat)

===Vietnam===
::* Võ Đường (Việt Võ Đạo).

===Greater China===
::* Wuguan, mou kwen 武馆 (Traditional Chinese Martial Arts). Literally: &#x27;Martial Hall&#x27;. Similarly to a Dojo, there is a Confucian-like hierarchy between the students and teachers. However, the hierarchy often more so resembles a &#x27;family&#x27;, than a bureaucracy. The altar, which only exists in some of the Wuguan, may be dedicated to past Masters, deities, or both. That is unlike in a Dojo, where the pictures of Masters are usually not placed within the shrine itself. Historically, and sometimes still in our time, this type of cultural enterprise was used as a community center. This is the opposite of many Dojos today, which join an extant community center, to become a part of it. The Wuguan is a central establishment in many kung fu movies, such as those of the Shaw Brothers company, and the films about late Wing Chun grandmaster Yip Man and martial arts folk hero Wong Fei-hong. 
::* Dojo/dojang is pronounced in Mandarin as &quot;daochang&quot; and Cantonese as &quot;dou cheung&quot; due to its Chinese characters used for the Japanese and Korean martial arts schools established in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. 

== In other fields ==
The term &quot;dōjō&quot; is also increasingly used for other forms of immersive-learning space. 

===Zen Buddhism===
The term &quot;dōjō&quot; is sometimes used to describe the meditation halls where Zen Buddhists practice &quot;zazen&quot; seated meditation. The alternative term &quot;zen-do&quot; is more specific, and more widely used. European &quot;Sōtō Zen&quot; groups affiliated with the International Zen Association prefer to use &quot;dōjō&quot; instead of &quot;zendo&quot; to describe their meditation halls as did their founding master, Taisen Deshimaru.

===Internet Culture===
The term &#x27;Dojo&#x27; has been used for various software, digital learning applications and by related companies.

<text>Yeshivish (), also known as Yeshiva English, Yeshivisheh Shprach, or Yeshivisheh Reid, is a sociolect of English spoken by Yeshiva students and other Jews with a strong connection to the Orthodox Yeshiva world.

&quot;Yeshivish&quot; may also refer to non-Hasidic Haredi Jews. Sometimes it has an extra connotation of non-Hasidic Haredi Jews educated in yeshiva and whose education made a noticeable specific cultural impact onto them. In the latter case the term has ambivalent (both positive and negative) connotations comparable to those of the term &quot;&quot;.

James Lambert writes that the term may be a portmanteau word of &quot;yeshiva&quot; and &quot;English&quot;, or may simply be formed from &quot;yeshiva&quot; + the adjectival suffix &quot;-ish&quot;.

==Research==
The first serious study about Yeshivish is a master&#x27;s thesis by Steven Ray Goldfarb (University of Texas at El Paso, 1979) called &quot;A Sampling of Lexical Items in Yeshiva English.&quot; The work lists, defines, and provides examples for nearly 250 Yeshivish words and phrases. The second, more comprehensive work is &quot;Frumspeak: The First Dictionary of Yeshivish&quot; by Chaim Weiser. Weiser (1995) maintains that Yeshivish is not a pidgin, creole, or an independent language, nor is it precisely a jargon. Baumel (2006) following Weiser notes that Yeshivish differs from English primarily in phonemic structure, lexical meaning, and syntax.

Benor (2012) offers a detailed list of distinctive features used in Yeshivish. Katz describes it in &quot;Words on Fire: the Unfinished Story of Yiddish&quot; (2004) as a &quot;new dialect of English&quot;, which is &quot;taking over as the vernacular in everyday life in some ... circles in America and elsewhere&quot;. Heilman (2006) and others consider code-switching a part of Yeshivish. Though Kaye (1991) would exclude English speakers in the context of a Yeshiva, studying the Talmud, from code-switching where he considers the terms &quot;Yiddish English&quot; or &quot;Yiddishized English&quot; (&quot;= Yinglish&quot;) may be more appropriate.

==Patterns of usage==
Yeshivish is primarily a male-spoken dialect. Fathers and sons, particularly of teenage years and above, might speak Yeshivish, while mothers and daughters generally speak a milder variety of it, which generally features Yeshivish phonology but excludes many Talmudic words. This can be explained as much of the Yeshivish lexicon is learned in Yeshiva where the studying takes place using a specialist nomenclature. Familiarity with these terms develops and they are then re-applied to other situations. There is a higher incidence of Yeshivish being spoken amongst Orthodox Jews that are regularly involved in Torah study, or belong to a community that promotes its study.

Commonly used platitudes among Orthodox Jews are frequently expressed with their Yeshivish equivalent. Examples include using &quot;shkoyakh&quot; for &quot;thank you&quot;, a contraction from the Hebrew &quot;Yishar Koach&quot;, which literally translates as &quot;May your strength be firm&quot; and is used to indicate to someone that they have done a good job, and &quot;Barukh HaShem&quot; (sometimes written as B&quot;H, using the quotation mark used for abbreviations in Hebrew), meaning &quot;Blessed is HaShem [The Name (of God)]&quot;. Yeshivish dialogue may include many expressions that refer to HaShem.

Some observers predict that the English variant of Yeshivish may develop further to the point that it could become one of the historical Judeo-hybrid languages like Yiddish, Judeo-Spanish or the Judeo-Arabic languages. Judeo-hybrid languages were spoken dialects which mixed elements of the local vernacular, Hebrew, Aramaic and Jewish religious idioms. What Yiddish was to Middle High German, Yeshivish may be to Standard American English. However, the integration of modern-day Jews with non-Jews may keep their speech from diverging as far from the standard language as it did in the past.

<doc id="142516" wikidata="Q842168" url="?curid=142516" title="Penny Lane">
<text>&quot;Penny Lane&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that was released as a double A-side single with &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; in February 1967. It was written primarily by Paul McCartney and credited to the Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership. The lyrics refer to Penny Lane, a street in Liverpool, and make mention of the sights and characters that McCartney recalled from his upbringing in the city.

The Beatles began recording &quot;Penny Lane&quot; in December 1966, intending it as a song for their album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. Instead, after it was issued as a single to satisfy record company demand for a new release, the band adhered to their policy of omitting previously released singles from their albums. The song features numerous modulations that occur mid-verse and between its choruses. Session musician David Mason played a piccolo trumpet solo for its bridge section.

&quot;Penny Lane&quot; was a top-five hit across Europe and topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In Britain, it was the first Beatles single since &quot;Please Please Me&quot; in 1963 to fail to reach number 1 on the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart. In November 1967, &quot;Penny Lane&quot; was included on the US &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; album. In 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the track at number 280 on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Mojo&quot; ranked the song at number 9 of &quot;The 101 Greatest Beatles Songs&quot;.

In 2011, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Background and inspiration==
Penny Lane is a road in the south Liverpool suburb of Mossley Hill. The name also applies to the area surrounding its junction with Smithdown Road and Allerton Road, and to the roundabout at Smithdown Place that was the location for a major bus terminus, originally an important tram junction of Liverpool Corporation Tramways. The roundabout was a frequent stopping place for John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison during their years as schoolchildren and students. Bus journeys via Penny Lane and the area itself subsequently became familiar elements in the early years of the Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership. In 2009, McCartney reflected:
&quot;Penny Lane&quot; was kind of nostalgic, but it was really [about] a place that John and I knew ... I&#x27;d get a bus to his house and I&#x27;d have to change at Penny Lane, or the same with him to me, so we often hung out at that terminus, like a roundabout. It was a place that we both knew, and so we both knew the things that turned up in the story.

Lennon&#x27;s original lyrics for &quot;In My Life&quot; had included a reference to Penny Lane. Soon after the Beatles recorded &quot;In My Life&quot; in October 1965, McCartney mentioned to an interviewer that he wanted to write a song about Penny Lane. A year later, he was spurred to write the song once presented with Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;. McCartney also cited Dylan Thomas&#x27;s nostalgic poem &quot;Fern Hill&quot; as an inspiration for &quot;Penny Lane&quot;. Lennon co-wrote the lyrics with McCartney. He recalled in a 1970 interview: &quot;The bank was &quot;there&quot;, and &quot;that&quot; was where the tram sheds were and people waiting and the inspector stood &quot;there&quot;, the fire engines were down &quot;there&quot;. It was reliving childhood.&quot;

Writing for the song took place early in the sessions for what became the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album, which commenced following a three-month period when the Beatles had pursued individual interests. Beatles biographer Ian MacDonald suggested an LSD influence, saying that the lyrical imagery points to McCartney first taking LSD in late 1966. MacDonald concluded that the lyric &quot;And though she feels as if she&#x27;s in a play / She is anyway&quot; was one of the more &quot;LSD-redolent phrases&quot; in the Beatles&#x27; catalogue. Music critics Roy Carr and Tony Tyler similarly described the subject matter as &quot;essentially &#x27;Liverpool-on-a-sunny-hallucinogenic-afternoon&#x27;&quot;.

==Composition==
===Music===

&quot;Penny Lane&quot; begins in the key of B major and is in common time throughout.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollack/Notes&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The song comprises three rounds of two verses and a chorus, with the chorus repeated during the final round. In its melody, the composition has a double tonic structure of B major verse (in I–vi–ii–V cycles) and A major chorus connected by formal pivoting dominant chords. In the opening bars in B major, after singing &quot;In Penny Lane&quot; (in an F–B–C–D melody note ascent) McCartney sings the major third of the first chord in the progression (on &quot;Lane&quot;) and major seventh (on &quot;barber&quot;) then switches to a Bm chord, singing the flattened third notes (on &quot;know&quot; with a i7 [Bm7] chord) and flattened seventh notes (on &quot;come and &quot;go&quot; [with a VImaj7 [Gmaj7] chord] and &quot;say&quot; hello&quot; [with a V7sus4 [F7sus4] chord]). Musicologist Dominic Pedler describes this as a profound and surprising innovation involving abandoning mid-cycle what initially appears to be a standard I–vi–ii–V doo-wop pop chord cycle.

The song features contrasting verse–chorus form. To get from the verse &quot;In the pouring rain – very strange&quot; McCartney uses an E chord as a pivot, (it is a IV chord in the preceding B key and a V in the looming A key) to take listeners back into the chorus (&quot;Penny Lane is in my ears ...&quot;). Likewise to get back from the chorus of &quot;There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile back ...&quot;, McCartney uses an F7 pivot chord, which is a VI in the old A key and a V in the new B key. The lyrics &quot;very strange&quot; and &quot;meanwhile back&quot; reflect these tonal shifts.

===Lyrics===

Lyrically there are several ambiguous and surreal images. The song is seemingly narrated on a fine summer day (&quot;beneath the blue suburban skies&quot;), yet at the same time it is raining (&quot;the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain&quot;) and approaching winter (&quot;selling poppies from a tray&quot; implies Remembrance Day, 11 November). MacDonald stated: &quot;Seemingly naturalistic, the lyric scene is actually kaleidoscopic. As well as raining and shining at the same time, it is simultaneously summer and winter.&quot; The fireman and fire engine referred to in the lyrics were based on memories of the fire station at Mather Avenue, while the barber shop was Bioletti&#x27;s, where McCartney, Harrison and Lennon each had their hair cut as children. The line &quot;A four of fish and finger pies&quot; is British slang. &quot;A four of fish&quot; refers to fourpennyworth of fish and chips, while &quot;finger pie&quot; is sexual slang for fingering.

According to music critic and musicologist Wilfrid Mellers, writing in his 1973 book &quot;Twilight of the Gods&quot;: &quot;For both musical and verbal reasons, the song comes out as childishly merry yet dreamily wild at the same time. The hallucinatory feeling concerns problems of identity rather than drugs specifically, asking what, among our childhood memories, is reality and what is illusion.&quot;

==Production==
===Main recording===

Production began in Studio 2 at EMI Studios on 29 December 1966 with piano as the main instrument. McCartney intended the song to have a &quot;clean&quot; sound akin to the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; album. Engineer Geoff Emerick recalled McCartney playing &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; repeatedly during recording session breaks, adding that &quot;it wasn&#x27;t altogether unsurprising [when] he wanted &#x27;a really clean American sound&#x27;&quot; for &quot;Penny Lane&quot;. Initially, McCartney recorded keyboard parts onto the individual tracks of the four-track tape: a basic piano rhythm on track one; a second piano, recorded through a Vox guitar amplifier with added reverb, on track two; a prepared piano producing a &quot;honky-tonk&quot; sound on track three; and percussion effects and a harmonium playing high notes fed through the guitar amplifier on track four. On 30 December, the four tracks were mixed together to form the first track of a new tape.

On 4 January 1967, the Beatles&#x27; first session of the new year, Lennon and Harrison overdubbed contributions on piano and lead guitar, respectively, and McCartney added a lead vocal, which he then replaced the following day. Further overdubs, on 6 January, included Ringo Starr&#x27;s drums, McCartney&#x27;s bass guitar and Lennon&#x27;s rhythm guitar, as well as handclaps, congas, harmony vocals and more piano. Following another reduction mix, brass and woodwind instruments, including four flutes, were added on 9 and 12 January, from a score by producer George Martin, guided by McCartney&#x27;s suggested melody lines. On 10 January, the Beatles overdubbed effects such as scat harmony singing and a handbell, the latter in recognition of the fireman and fire engine mentioned in the lyrics. The second overdubbing session for the classical instrumentation, on 12 January, featured two further trumpets, two oboes, two cors anglais and a double bass.

===Piccolo trumpet solo===

McCartney was dissatisfied with the initial attempts at the song&#x27;s instrumental fill, and was inspired to use a piccolo trumpet after seeing trumpeter David Mason play the instrument during a BBC television broadcast of the second Brandenburg Concerto by Johann Sebastian Bach. On 17 January, Mason recorded the instrumental solo used for the final mix. Martin later wrote, &quot;The result was unique, something which had never been done in rock music before.&quot; The solo is in a mock-Baroque style for which the piccolo trumpet (a small instrument built about one octave higher than the standard instrument) is particularly suited, having a clean and clear sound which penetrates well through thicker midrange textures. According to Emerick, Mason &quot;nailed it&quot; at some point during the recording; McCartney tried to get him to do another take but Martin insisted it was not necessary, sensing Mason&#x27;s fatigue. He also played over the song&#x27;s final chorus, replacing the oboe parts from that portion of the track.

Mason later said he was impressed that Lennon, Harrison and Starr were present at the session, demonstrating a common interest in shaping the result, although he was taken aback by their new look of moustaches and psychedelic clothing. Mason was paid £27 and 10 shillings for the session and achieved international renown for his performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Millington/Guardian&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In author Mark Hertsgaard&#x27;s description, the trumpet solo is the recording&#x27;s &quot;pièce de résistance&quot; and evokes a &quot;sense of freedom, energy, and sheer happiness&quot;. Author Jonathan Gould describes the sound as &quot;impossibly high and bright&quot;, and says that the solo represents a &quot;neo-Baroque pastiche of every fanfare ever blown&quot; and casts a magical spell that allows the Beatles to insert the risqué &quot;Four of fish and finger pies&quot; line into the chorus that follows. Classical music scholar Barry Millington described Mason&#x27;s contribution as &quot;surreal, unearthly ... a fusion of classical and rock&quot; and commented that &quot;so high does the part go&quot;, it was mistakenly assumed to have been sped up after recording.

===Alternative mixes===

The original US promo single mix of &quot;Penny Lane&quot; had an additional flourish of piccolo trumpet notes at the end of the song. This mix was quickly superseded by one without the last trumpet passage, but not before copies had been pressed and sent to radio stations. By the late 1980s, these discs were among the rarest and most valuable Beatles collectibles. &quot;Penny Lane&quot; was mixed in stereo for the first time in 1971, for a West German issue of the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; LP and, in 1980, this mix, with the addition of the trumpet ending, was included on the US &quot;Rarities&quot; compilation and the UK set &quot;The Beatles Box&quot;. A remix of the song released on the outtakes compilation &quot;Anthology 2&quot; in 1996 included the closing trumpet flourish and the solo (by cor anglais and trumpet) that had been replaced by Mason&#x27;s overdub for the 1967 single. The original promo single mix was made available again in 2017, when it was included on a CD of mono mixes in the six-disc 50th-anniversary edition of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. The two- and six-disc anniversary editions also featured a new remix of &quot;Penny Lane&quot; prepared by Giles Martin, designed to allow the keyboard parts to be heard distinctly.

==Promotional film==
The Beatles&#x27; low public profile since completing their 1966 US tour in late August caused concern for Brian Epstein, their manager, who feared that the band&#x27;s popularity might suffer. Wary also of the threat presented by the Monkees, an American television and recording act formed in the Beatles&#x27; image, Epstein conceded to pressure from EMI in January 1967 and approached Martin for a new single by the band. Martin told him that they had recorded &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, which he considered to be the group&#x27;s best songs up to that point.
The promotional film for &quot;Penny Lane&quot; was, together with the clip for &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, one of the first examples of what became known as a music video. The films were directed by Peter Goldmann, a Swedish television director, and produced by Tony Bramwell for Epstein&#x27;s company Subafilms. The clip for &quot;Penny Lane&quot; includes footage of Liverpool&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris/Mojo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; – such as the number 46 bus to Penny Lane, the shelter on the roundabout, and a fireman riding a white horse – but street scenes featuring the Beatles were instead filmed in and around Angel Lane in Stratford, in the east of London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wawzenek/UCR&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This filming includes the band members riding horses and took place on 5 February. Another street scene features only Lennon, walking along King&#x27;s Road, Chelsea among a crowd in a manner that author Robert Rodriguez terms &quot;as if in a nostalgic reverie&quot;.

More filming was done in Knole Park in Sevenoaks, where the clip for &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; had been filmed the week before. Shot on 7 February, this footage includes further horse-riding scenes, with the band members dressed in matching red tunics, and the closing scene, when they arrive at a table set up in the park, bearing a large candelabra. During the horse ride, they pass by a stage filled with their guitars and drum kit, the latter bearing the familiar Beatles logo. The musicians sit at the table, where they are waited on by two attendants (played by Bramwell and Mal Evans) dressed in Renaissance-era costumes and wigs, and presented with their musical instruments. According to music critic Chris Ingham, the film appears to be &quot;little more than an extra-curricular afterthought&quot; relative to the surreal and experimental &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; clip. He adds that it nevertheless closes with &quot;another iconoclastic gesture&quot; as Lennon overturns the table and scatters its contents.
In their avoidance of any performance-related content, the clips developed the promotional medium the Beatles had introduced in 1966 with their clips for &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; and &quot;Rain&quot;. According to Hertsgaard, since the band avoided any attempt to play or sing, the clip for &quot;Penny Lane&quot; consists of images that &quot;amplify or somehow comment on&quot; the song&#x27;s themes. He says the &quot;most arresting&quot; scenes are Lennon&#x27;s walk along the sun-lit city street, the Beatles riding their horses through a stone archway, and the four band members &quot;sitting at an immaculately set table in the middle of a field, where they are served tea in what is very plainly bitterly cold weather&quot;. Journalist and broadcaster Joe Cushley described the film as &quot;Lewis-Carroll-goes-to-Liverpool&quot;. McCartney predicted at the time of the single&#x27;s release: &quot;In the future all records will have vision as well as sound. In twenty years&#x27; time, people will be amazed to think we just listened to records.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot; were released as a double A-side single, in a fashion identical to that of the Beatles&#x27; previous single, &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; / &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. The release took place in the United States on 13 February 1967 and in the United Kingdom on 17 February. It was the first single by the Beatles to be sold with a picture sleeve in the UK, a practice rarely used there at that time. Expectations were high for the release, since it was the band&#x27;s first new music since they had decided to abandon touring, a decision that had led to speculation in the press in late 1966 that the group would disband.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unterberger/AM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing the two sides, author Clinton Heylin writes that McCartney was possibly &quot;fearful of alienating fans unduly&quot; with the more dense and experimental &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;. He says that with &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, McCartney was &quot;again cast in the role of the great populariser&quot; by providing the &quot;more prosaic depiction of the Liverpool of their youth ... set to another of his eminently hummable melodies&quot;. In his book &quot;Electric Shock&quot;, Peter Doggett describes &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; as art pop, &quot;self-consciously excluding the mass audience&quot;, and likens &quot;Penny Lane&quot; to pop art in its evoking &quot;multifaceted substance out of the everyday&quot;.

The promotional films for the single presented the Beatles&#x27; moustachioed look to their audience for the first time. The new look was the focus of much scrutiny, as facial hair went against convention for pop idols and implied maturation. Promotion for the single and its musical content left many listeners unable to recognise the act as the Beatles. In author Kevin Courrier&#x27;s description, the picture sleeve showed the Beatles dressed and posing formally as if they were &quot;arcane artifacts from the nineteenth century&quot;, with the portrait set inside a gold picture frame. The reverse was a collage of photos of the band members as infants.

The clips were first broadcast in America on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and in Britain on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, a day before the respective release dates in those two countries. On 25 February, they aired on &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;, a traditional US variety program hosted by actor Van Johnson, who claimed that the Beatles had created the films especially for his show. Amid screams from female members of the studio audience, Johnson described the &quot;Penny Lane&quot; clip as &quot;the most imaginative treatment of a song I have ever seen&quot;. According to Rodriguez, however, Johnson&#x27;s reaction was clearly bemusement at &quot;what youth entertainment had become&quot;, as demonstrated in his mannered introduction to &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;. The films attracted a similar level of confusion on the more youth-focused &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, on 11 March, where host Dick Clark invited comments from his studio audience. Clark introduced the clip with a warning that it showed a &quot;very interesting and different looking Beatles&quot;, after which he sought opinions from his teenage audience with what author Doyle Greene describes as &quot;an urgent solemnity as if he were discussing the Zapruder film&quot;. The responses were less dismissive than those given to &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;. Male reaction was marginally more favourable than female, as the women variously focused on the &quot;weird&quot;, &quot;ugly&quot; or supposedly aged appearance of the band members. After &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, one young man complained that the Beatles were &quot;as bad as the Monkees&quot;, while another said, &quot;They went out with the Twist.&quot;

Since the Beatles usually did not include songs released as singles on their albums, both &quot;Penny Lane&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; were left off &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. With their omission, the Liverpool childhood theme that had been a loose concept behind the album was abandoned. Courrier describes the single as &quot;a conceptual 45 if ever there was one&quot;. Martin came to regret the decision to omit the two songs, describing it as &quot;the biggest mistake of my professional life&quot;. Against the Beatles&#x27; wishes, &quot;Penny Lane&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; were included on the US &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; album in November 1967. In 2017, both songs were included on the two-disc and six-disc 50th-anniversary editions of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;.

==Reception==
In Britain, most reviewers were initially confused by the single and predicted that the Beatles&#x27; creative advances might not be rewarded in record sales. The commercial qualities of &quot;Penny Lane&quot; ensured that it was the more favourably received of the two songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;O&#x27;Gorman/MojoSpecial&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Melody Maker&quot; said the brass parts were &quot;beautifully arranged&quot; and concluded: &quot;Tinged with sentimentality, the number slowly builds into an urgent, colourful and vivid recollection of the Liverpool street that the Beatles remember so clearly.&quot; An editorial in &quot;The Times&quot; said: &quot;&#x27;Penny Lane&#x27; looks back to the days when parochialism was not an attitude to be derided. While it may seem that the commonplace suburb is a pleasanter source of inspiration than a psychedelic ecstasy, it may also be that the song is instinctively satisfying a youthful appetite for simplicity ...&quot;

&quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; / &quot;Penny Lane&quot; was the first Beatles single since &quot;Please Please Me&quot; in 1963 to fail to reach number 1 on &quot;Record Retailer&quot;″s chart (later the UK Singles Chart). With &quot;Penny Lane&quot; as the side favoured by the chart, the single was held at number 2 behind Engelbert Humperdinck&#x27;s &quot;Release Me&quot;, even though the Beatles&#x27; record sold considerably more. This was due to chart protocol whereby only the sales of the better-selling side of a double A-side were eligible, and the record&#x27;s overall sales were effectively halved. On the national chart compiled by &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, the combination was number 1 for three weeks. Its failure to top the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart provoked comments in the UK press that the Beatles&#x27; position of eminence was at an end, with headlines such as &quot;Has the Bubble Burst?&quot; The band were unperturbed by the result. In Starr&#x27;s recollection, it was a &quot;relief&quot; and &quot;took the pressure off&quot; the group, while Lennon said in a late 1966 interview: &quot;We sort of half hope for the downfall. A nice downfall. Then we would just be a pleasant old memory.&quot;
In the United States, the song became the band&#x27;s 13th single to reach number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, doing so for a week before being knocked off by the Turtles&#x27; &quot;Happy Together&quot;. With &quot;Penny Lane&quot; as the favoured side, the single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on 20 March 1967. There, the single initiated an upsurge in the ongoing critical discourse on the aesthetics and artistry of pop music, as, centring on the Beatles&#x27; work, writers sought to elevate pop in the cultural landscape for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamilton/Slate&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One of these laudatory appraisals came from &quot;Time&quot; magazine, whose writers said that the Beatles had &quot;bridged the heretofore impassable gap between rock and classical, mixing elements of Bach, Oriental and electronic music with vintage twang to achieve the most compellingly original sounds ever heard in pop music&quot;. In his television show &quot;Inside Pop: The Rock Revolution&quot;, American composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein highlighted the trumpet solo on &quot;Penny Lane&quot; among examples of the genre&#x27;s eclectic qualities that made contemporary pop music worthy of recognition as art.

The single was also number 1 in Australia (for five weeks), West Germany (four weeks), the Netherlands and New Zealand (each for three weeks), Canada, Denmark and Malaysia. In France, it peaked at number 4.

==Influence and legacy==
According to historian David Simonelli, further to &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; in 1966, &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot; &quot;establish[ed] the Beatles as the most avant-garde [pop] composers of the postwar era&quot;. He also says:
With this double-sided single, the Beatles planted the flag of Romanticism squarely at the center of psychedelic rock. They emphasized innocence, childhood as purity, improvisation, and the spirits of individuality and community united as one. For the next three to five years, these ideals would dominate rock music on both sides of the Atlantic. The Beatles&#x27; vision dominated the entire rock music world.

Ian MacDonald comments on &quot;Penny Lane&quot;&#x27;s place in an era of high optimism in Britain marked by a vibrant arts scene, England&#x27;s victory in the 1966 World Cup, and the Beatles&#x27; standing as &quot;arbiters of a positive new age&quot; in which outdated social mores would be superseded by a young, classless worldview. He writes: &quot;With its vision of &#x27;blue suburban skies&#x27; and boundlessly confident vigour, &#x27;Penny Lane&#x27; distills the spirit of that time more perfectly than any other creative product of the mid-Sixties. Couched in the primary colours of a picture-book, yet observed with the slyness of a gang of kids straggling home from school, &#x27;Penny Lane&#x27; is both naive and knowing – but above all thrilled to be alive.&quot; MacDonald adds that although the song &quot;fathered a rather smug English pop vogue for brass bands and gruff Northern imagery&quot;, its sequence in the 1968 animated film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; demonstrated it to be &quot;as subversively hallucinatory as &#x27;Strawberry Fields&#x27;&quot;. Music critic Tim Riley praised the musical arrangement and said the song was &quot;as perfect as pop gets&quot;. He also wrote: &quot;&#x27;Penny Lane&#x27; survives as a classic because its surface charm masks its structural intelligence – the appeal is as simple and sweet as the youthful glow it recaptures.&quot;

Some commentators have described the pairing as pop music&#x27;s best double A-side. In 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Penny Lane&quot; at number 456 on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. On the magazine&#x27;s 2021 revised list, the song appears at number 280. In &quot;Mojo&quot;″s list of &quot;The 101 Greatest Beatles Songs&quot;, published in 2006, the song appeared at number 9. In his commentary on the track, Neil Innes admired McCartney&#x27;s melodic gifts and the key changes, and he described the song as &quot;mould-breaking&quot; with lyrics that &quot;ran like a movie&quot;. Sociologist Andy Bennett views the characters in the lyrics as representing a &quot;story book version of British suburban life&quot;, an approach that he says anticipated television soap operas such as &quot;Brookside&quot; and &quot;EastEnders&quot;. Bennett writes that a similar notion of &quot;Britishness&quot; informed music videos by Britpop acts in the 1990s, particularly Blur&#x27;s &quot;Parklife&quot;, which brought to life some of the lyrical imagery of Lennon–McCartney songs and the &quot;utopian reminiscing&quot; evident in &quot;Penny Lane&quot;.
The promotional clips for &quot;Penny Lane&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; are recognised as pioneering works in the medium of music video. In 1985, they were the oldest selections included in the New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)&#x27;s exhibition of the most influential music videos. The two films occupied a similar place in MoMA&#x27;s 2003 &quot;Golden Oldies of Music Video&quot; exhibition, where they were presented by avant-garde artist Laurie Anderson.
Liverpool poet Roger McGough credited &quot;Penny Lane&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; as the first examples of British streets and locations being celebrated in pop music and of the Beatles creating a &quot;mythology&quot; for Liverpool. The song&#x27;s popularity led to the regular theft of Penny Lane street signs and the area becoming one of the city&#x27;s major tourist attractions. As of 2014, the roundabout was home to the Sgt. Pepper Bistro &amp; Bus Shelter, although the business had long ceased operating. The feature films &quot;Wonderwall&quot; (for which Harrison supplied the instrumental musical score in 1968) and &quot;Almost Famous&quot; include characters named after the song.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fontenot/About&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Former adult film star Jennifer Ketcham said she chose her pseudonym Penny Flame to reflect her fondness of the Beatles song and marijuana.

German politician Martin Schulz once described the song as a working class anthem. He said that it is his favourite &quot;Beatles&quot; song and it can reduce him to tears sometimes. It is a symbol of class consciousness for him and the Beatles&#x27; working-class background reminds him of his own.

==Song ownership, McCartney live performances and cover versions==
In 1969, the Beatles&#x27; publishing company Northern Songs was acquired by ATV, a media company owned by Lew Grade. By 1985, ATV was being run by Australian entrepreneur Robert Holmes à Court, who decided to sell the catalogue to Michael Jackson. Before the sale, Jackson allowed the rights for &quot;Penny Lane&quot; to be exempt from the deal and given instead to Holmes à Court&#x27;s teenage daughter. As of 2009, Catherine Holmes à Court-Mather was still the copyright owner of &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, which is one of the few Lennon–McCartney songs not owned by Sony Music Publishing.

&quot;Penny Lane&quot; was instantly popular with both contemporary pop artists and supper club entertainers. According to author Alan Clayson, it was one of several McCartney compositions that &quot;walked a safe and accessible line&quot; and allowed easy interpretation during a period when &quot;schmaltz was represented in the charts as much as psychedelia&quot;. Artists who have covered the song include Amen Corner, Judy Collins, Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops, Engelbert Humperdinck, James Last, Enoch Light, Kenny Rankin, John Valby, Newton Wayland and Kai Winding. The Rutles&#x27; 1978 song &quot;Doubleback Alley&quot; is a parody of &quot;Penny Lane&quot;. Written by Innes, it was part of the Rutles&#x27; TV film satirising the Beatles&#x27; career, &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot;.

McCartney has regularly included the song in his tour set lists. He first performed it on his New World Tour in 1993. Elvis Costello performed &quot;Penny Lane&quot; during a concert at the White House in June 2010 when McCartney received the Gershwin Prize from President Barack Obama. In his introduction to the song, Costello said that his mother had grown up less than a mile from Penny Lane, and so hearing the Beatles single had been a powerful moment for him and his family.

<doc id="142517" wikidata="Q317232" url="?curid=142517" title="Carausius">
<text>Marcus Aurelius Mausaeus Carausius (died 293) was a military commander of the Roman Empire in the 3rd century. He was a Menapian from Belgic Gaul, who usurped power in 286, during the Carausian Revolt, declaring himself emperor in Britain and northern Gaul (Imperium Britanniarum). He did this only 13 years after the Gallic Empire of the Batavian Postumus was ended in 273. He held power for seven years, fashioning the name &quot;Emperor of the North&quot; for himself, before being assassinated by his finance minister Allectus.

==Early life and assumption of Imperial title==
Carausius was of humble origin, a Menapian who distinguished himself during Maximian&#x27;s campaign against the Bagaudae rebels in northern Gaul in 286. This success, and his former occupation as a pilot, led to his appointment to command the &quot;Classis Britannica&quot;, a fleet based in the English Channel, with the responsibility of eliminating Frankish and Saxon pirates who had been raiding the coasts of Armorica and Belgica. He was suspected of allowing pirates to carry out raids and collect loot before attacking them, then keeping captured treasure for himself, and Maximian ordered his execution. In late 286 or early 287 Carausius learned of this sentence and responded by declaring himself Emperor in Britain and northern Gaul. His forces comprised not only his fleet, augmented by new ships he had built and the three legions stationed in Britain, but also a legion he had seized in Gaul, a number of foreign auxiliary units, a levy of Gaulish merchant ships, and barbarian mercenaries attracted by the prospect of booty.

British historian and archaeologist Sheppard Frere wonders how Carausius was able to win support from the army when his command had been sea-based, and speculates that he had perhaps been involved in an unrecorded victory in Britain, connected with Diocletian&#x27;s assumption of the title &quot;Britannicus Maximus&quot; in 285, and signs of destruction in Romano-British towns at this time. The campaign against the Bagaudae, however, was evidently land-based and may have been responsible for Carausius&#x27;s popularity with the army. Equally, if the accusations of larceny are true, he could perhaps have afforded to buy their loyalty.

Maximian prepared an invasion of Britain in 288 or 289 to oust him, but it failed. A panegyric delivered to Constantius Chlorus attributes this failure to bad weather, but notes that Carausius claimed a military victory. Eutropius says that hostilities were in vain thanks to Carausius&#x27;s military skill, and peace was agreed. Carausius began to entertain visions of legitimacy and official recognition.

It has been suggested that Carausius may have been responsible for the series of fortifications on both sides of the English Channel known as the Saxon Shore, another factor that could explain the failure of Maximian&#x27;s invasion.
==Overthrow and death==
This situation continued until 293, when Constantius Chlorus (Constantius I), now the western Caesar, marched into Gaul and reclaimed it for the empire. He isolated Carausius by besieging the port of Gesoriacum (Boulogne-sur-Mer) and invading Batavia in the Rhine delta, securing his rear against Carausius&#x27;s Frankish allies. He could not yet mount an invasion of Britain until a suitable fleet could be built. Nevertheless, Carausius&#x27;s grip on power was fatally undermined. Allectus, whom he had put in charge of his treasury, assassinated him and assumed power himself. His reign would last only three years, after which he was defeated and killed by Constantius&#x27;s subordinate Julius Asclepiodotus.

==Coinage and inscriptions==
Coinage is the main source of information about the rogue emperor; his coinage was issued from mints in Londinium, Rotomagus (Rouen) and a third site, possibly Colonia Claudia Victricensis (Colchester). He also used them for sophisticated propaganda. He issued the first proper silver coins that had appeared in the Roman Empire for generations, knowing that good quality bullion coinage would enhance his legitimacy and make him look more successful than Diocletian and Maximian.

In April 2010 a large hoard of over 52,500 Roman coins was unearthed in a field near Frome, Somerset. 766 of these coins were determined to have been produced during Carausius&#x27;s reign, of which only 5 were silver denarii. This find roughly equates to four years&#x27; pay for a Roman legionary, but the presence of later coin issues implies that the group was not deposited until after Carausius&#x27;s death. 

===Character portrayal===
His initial issues show him as rough and thuggish, though the technical standard of die cutting on good specimens can be seen to be excellent. The intention was to portray a rough and thuggish man; his later coins show him as trim and beneficent. 

===Claims of Imperial legitimacy===
He struck coins that showed three portrait heads on the reverse instead of the usual one, and a legend on the obverse including PAX AVGGG, the peace of &quot;three&quot; Augusti. This would imply that he was recognized by the other two current Augusti, Diocletian and Maximian, but their own coins of the time proclaim the attributes of only two Augusti, PAX AVGG. Carausius also had himself depicted as a member of the Tetrarchy&#x27;s college of emperors, issuing coins with the legend CARAVSIVS ET FRATRES SVI, &#x27;Carausius and his brothers&#x27; with portraits of himself with Diocletian and Maximian. 

===Virgilian and other literary references===
Carausius appears to have appealed to native British dissatisfaction with Roman rule; he issued coins with legends such as &quot;Restitutor Britanniae&quot; (Restorer of Britain) and &quot;Genius Britanniae&quot; (Spirit of Britain). Some of these silver coins bear the legend &quot;Expectate veni&quot;, &quot;Come long-awaited one&quot;, recognised to allude to a messianic line in the Aeneid by the Augustan poet Virgil, written more than 300 years previously. 

Some of the silver coins bear the legend RSR in the exergue (an area on a coin below the legend). This was considered a mystery for some time. Three Carausian copper-alloy medallions, now in the British Museum, have also survived. One has the reverse legend VICTOR CARAVSIUS AVG GERM MAX with RSR in the exergue; the second has the reverse legend VICTOR CARAVSI AVG (&#x27;The Victory of Carausius Augustus&#x27;) with INPCDA in the exergue; and the third is too damaged for an exergue legend to be visible but bears the reverse legend PACATOR ORBIS &#x27;Peace-bringer to the world&#x27;. The medallions depict Carausius in consular garb and are around 34-35 mm, weighing ~22 g. The medals appeared on the market in the twentieth century and reached the British Museum in 1972, 1967 (this one was first shown to the Museum in 1931) and 1997 respectively. All bear evidence of chemical corrosion resulting from burial of some sort as can be seen from their present appearance.

Since 1998 these letters have been recognised as representing the sixth and seventh lines of the Fourth Eclogue of Virgil, which reads &quot;Redeunt Saturnia Regna, Iam Nova Progenies Caelo Demittitur Alto&quot;, meaning &quot;The Golden Ages are back, now a new generation is let down from Heaven above&quot;. Virgil&#x27;s works, or at any rate quotations from them, were current in Roman popular culture. Suetonius cites three instances in which Virgilian lines were quoted. Cassius Dio cites an instance of a praetorian tribune quoting Virgil as a means of criticising Septimius Severus after an attack on Hatra went badly in 199. 

Copper-alloy medallions already existed in the contemporary repertoire of imperial Roman coinage so Carausius&#x27;s production should not be considered exceptional. Numerian (283-4) and his brother Carinus (283-5) both issued copper-alloy medallions of similar size and weight to those of Carausius, often depicting the three Monetae (goddesses of the mint). Another depicts Numerian in consular garb and on the reverse himself and his father Carus in a quadriga pulled by Victory with the legend TRIVNF.QVADOR, &#x27;the triumph over the Quadi tribe&#x27;, and is clearly similar in tone to the Carausian INPCDA medallion.

Although the Virgilian reference might seem remarkable in the context of late third century Roman Britain it is apparent from other contemporary literature that the Tetrarchy legitimist regime was utilising Virgilian allusions and references in its propaganda, and claiming itself to have restored a Golden Age. &#x27;The rule of Saturn over a golden age is a literary commonplace ... as is the association of any emperor&#x27;s reign with the same thing&#x27;.

An imperial panegyric to Maximian states &#x27;Indeed, as the fact is, those golden ages which once flourished briefly in the reign of Saturn, are now reborn under the perpetual guidance of Jove and Hercules.&#x27; Lactantius, a Christian writer of the period and opponent of the Tetrarchs, makes a number of disparaging references to the Tetrarchs and their Saturnian pretensions which seem to be a refutation of official propaganda.

Carausius was claiming to represent a revival of traditional Roman virtues and the great traditions of the Empire as established by Augustus in the last decades of the first century BC, not in Rome but in Britain. However, he appears to have adopted a propaganda theme that was already current in Tetrarchal publicity which corresponds with the use of similar literary allusions. 

An alternative school of thought exists which argues the medallions must be eighteenth-century fantasy pieces on the basis that such arcane literary allusions would have been too obscure to Carausius and his army. This argument contends that the antiquarian William Stukeley or someone like him found the RSR on Carausius&#x27;s silver coinage, and noted that this matched the Redeunt Saturnia Regna (RSR) of the 6th line of the Fourth Eclogue. Thus inspired, the medallions were created with the next line of the Eclogue included on one of them. The central points of this argument are that Stukeley had published a detailed book on Carausius and his coinage, and that the medallions have no known provenance. However, this published argument does not offer any evidence to support Stukeley&#x27;s involvement or motives (since Stukeley never mentions the medals or a Virgilian expansion of the RSR coins known to him), or include discussion of the literary evidence of the contemporary panegyrics or any of the scholarly publications concerning them, or explain why the medallions appear on the basis of their present appearance to have been buried and why they were unknown until 1931 when the INPCDA one was first brought to the British Museum.

===Milestones===
A milestone from Carlisle with his name on it suggests that the whole of Roman Britain was in Carausius&#x27;s grasp. The inscription reads (with expansions in square brackets) &quot;IMP[eratori] C[aesari] M[arco] | AVR[elio] MAVS[aeo] | CARAVSIO P[io] F[elici] | INVICTO AVG[usto]&quot;, this translates as &quot;For the Emperor Caesar Marcus Aurelius Mausaeus Carausius Pius Felix Invictus Augustus&quot;. The title indicates he considered himself equal to the Tetrarchy&#x27;s &quot;senior&quot; emperors (&quot;Augusti&quot;), rather than their subordinate junior emperors (&quot;Caesares&quot;). The milestone was reused in about 306, burying the first inscription and adding a new one at the other end, which translates as &quot;For Flavius Valerius Constantinus, most noble Caesar&quot; and refers to Marcus Flavius Valerius Constantius Herculius Augustus (Constantius I). Some more text on the stone, probably a continuation of the Carausius inscription after a gap because it is orientated the same way, was chiselled away, presumably when the stone was reused; the traces remaining suggest it included (translated) &quot;... the Emperor ...&quot;.

==In medieval legend==
In Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot; (1136) Carausius is a Briton of humble birth, who by his courage persuades the Roman Senate to give him command of a fleet to defend Britain from barbarian attack. Once given the fleet, however, he sails around Britain stirring up unrest and raises an army against Bassianus, the historical Caracalla, here a king of Britain. Carausius defeats Bassianus by persuading his Pictish allies to desert him in exchange for grants of land in Scotland and sets himself up as king. Hearing of Carausius&#x27;s treachery, the Romans send Allectus to Britain with three legions. Allectus defeats Carausius, kills him, and sets himself up as king in his place.

Hector Boece later built on this to make &quot;Carantius&quot; a Scottish prince, exiled on suspicion of involvement in his brother&#x27;s murder, who entered Roman service passing himself off as a commoner, and later allied with his nephew King Crathlinthus against the Romans.

==In literature==
The assassination of Carausius is central to Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s 1957 novel, &quot;The Silver Branch&quot;.

Carausius features as the character &#x27;Caros&#x27; in James Macpherson&#x27;s &quot;Fingal, An Epic Poem in Six Books&quot; (1761), in which he is defeated by the blind poet Ossian&#x27;s son, Oscar.

<doc id="142518" wikidata="Q6403623" url="?curid=142518" title="Ki Society">
<text>The is an aikido organization founded by Koichi Tohei in 1971, while he was the chief instructor at the Aikikai Hombu Dojo. The official Japanese name of the organization is Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido Kai (心身統一合気道会), but it is also known in English-speaking countries as &quot;Ki Society&quot;. Its foundation reflected Tohei&#x27;s differences with the Aikikai, and his own emphasis on developing the concept of Ki. Students of the art are graded in Ki and Aikido classes. Tohei&#x27;s Ki lessons come from Shin Shin Tōitsu-dō (心身統一道), meaning &quot;the way of realizing the [original] unity of mind and body&quot;. The martial discipline of the art is frequently referred to as Ki-Aikido, particularly in the Western world.

The Ki Society has its organizational headquarters in Chiyoda-ku in central Tokyo, and its head dojo at the Tenshinkan in Tochigi Prefecture, a large facility built on the Tohei family ancestral land.

==Principles and Practice==
At the Ki Society, Tohei envisioned a place where Ki could be taught to students of all ages, including the handicapped and infirm, and others who are incapable of Aikido martial art practice. Aikido is just one of the disciplines in Tohei&#x27;s holistic art of Shin Shin Toitsudo; there are five disciplines learned by students at a Ki Society Dojo:

* Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido, the martial art
* Kiatsu (personal health and healing)
* Ki Breathing
* Ki Meditation
* Ki Development Exercises (methods for realizing oneness of mind and body are Oneness Rhythm Exercise, Sokushin no Gyo, and Senshin no Gyo)

Being one of the first to bring Aikido to the West from Japan in 1953, Tohei discovered numerous obstacles in teaching. Western students did not accept teachings at face value, and bombarded Tohei with questions, and even occasional &quot;attacks&quot; to test Tohei&#x27;s real ability. Due to these teaching situations, Tohei was forced to create a clear system of teaching that combines Western methods to teach Eastern concepts such as ki, one-point, relaxing completely while maintaining the full flow of ki, etc. Through his lifetime in wars abroad and at home, and through his experiences with Aikido, in Sokushin no Gyo at the Ichikukai dojo, and the Japanese Yoga teachings of Tempu Nakamura, Tohei realized four universal principles that he felt should be used in all Ki Society practice, and in everyone&#x27;s daily life.

* Keep One Point
* Relax Completely 
* Keep Weight Underside
* Extend Ki

==Taigi Competition==
Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido Kai hosts an All-Japan Taigi Competition every year at Ki no Kenkyukai (HQ), and every four years the World Taigi Competition is held there. Various techniques are grouped into 31 sets of about 6 throws, each of which are called a &#x27;Taigi&#x27;, often based around a specific attack or another theme. Participant teams perform several taigi, selected each year. The competition measures the nage&#x27;s form and movement with uke, rather than a competition between two opponents. It could be compared to paired figure skating competition. Judges award points for size, rhythm, calmness, balance, and the use of ki. The World Taigi Competition has not taken place since the death of Koichi Tohei.

<doc id="142520" wikidata="Q1320698" url="?curid=142520" title="Strawberry Field">
<text>Strawberry Field is a visitor attraction and training centre in the Liverpool suburb of Woolton that is owned and operated by the Salvation Army. It operated as a children&#x27;s home between 1936 and 2005. The house and grounds had originally been built as a private residence in the Victorian era, before being acquired by the Salvation Army in the 1930s. The house was demolished in 1973 due to structural problems and replaced with purpose-built units. After being closed as a children&#x27;s home, the site has continued to be used by the Salvation Army for other purposes.

The location gained worldwide fame following the release of the Beatles&#x27; 1967 single &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;. The song&#x27;s writer, John Lennon, had grown up nearby and played in the grounds of the home as a child. In time, the old red-painted entrance gates on Beaconsfield Road became a place of pilgrimage for Beatles fans. In 2019, Strawberry Field was opened to the public for the first time, with an exhibition on its history, cafe, and shop, alongside a training centre for young people with special educational needs.

The gates were stolen on 11 May 2000, allegedly by two men in a transit van. The gates were sold to an unsuspecting antiques dealer who never realised they were the actual gates from Strawberry Field. He returned them to the police upon request, and they now stand in the grounds of Strawberry Field.

==History==
The earliest reference to the Gothic Revival mansion Strawberry Field dates from 1870, when it was owned by wealthy shipping magnate George Warren. On an 1891 Ordnance Survey map, the building and its grounds appear as the plural Strawberry Fields, although this had changed by the 1905 survey. In 1912, it was transferred to another wealthy merchant whose widow sold the estate to the Salvation Army in 1934. It opened as a children&#x27;s home on 7 July 1936 by Lady Bates in the presence of General Evangeline Booth, daughter of Salvation Army founders William Booth and Catherine Booth. With a capacity of up to 40 girls, boys under the age of five were introduced in the 1950s. Later, older boys also became resident.

==The Beatles==
The name of the home became famous in 1967 with the release of the Beatles&#x27; single &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, written by John Lennon, who had grown up at nearby 251 Menlove Avenue. Beaconsfield Road, where Strawberry Field is located, is a side street from Menlove Avenue. One of Lennon&#x27;s childhood treats was the garden party that took place each summer, on the grounds of Strawberry Field. Lennon&#x27;s Aunt Mimi recalled, &quot;As soon as we could hear the Salvation Army Band starting, John would jump up and down shouting, &#x27;Mimi, come on. We&#x27;re going to be late.&#x27;&quot;

==Legacy==

Strawberry Field was recognised by Nikolaus Pevsner in his 1969 survey of the buildings of South Lancashire. However, by then, the building was increasingly unfit for purpose. By 1973, structural problems such as dry rot meant that it was more cost-effective to demolish the building and replace it with a purpose-built children&#x27;s home. This new home provided three family units, each accommodating 12 children. The driveway entrance to the building was moved further west along Beaconsfield Road so the gateposts bearing the name of Strawberry Field were no longer used. Throughout the 1970s and beyond, the disused entrance and its gates became a mecca for Beatles fans from around the world. As a result, the gates continued to be painted bright red; the painted nameplates were also maintained.

The children&#x27;s home closed in January 2005, and the building was used by the Salvation Army as a church and prayer centre. The famous gates marking its entrance were removed and replaced with replicas in May 2011. The Salvation Army opened Strawberry Field to the public for the first time in September 2019, allowing visitors to explore the grounds. Incorporated in the grounds is a training centre for young people with special educational needs and a new exhibition space dedicated to the story of the place, together with a cafe and shop.

<text>Allectus (died 296) was a Roman-Britannic usurper-emperor in Britain and northern Gaul from 293 to 296.

==History==
Allectus was treasurer to Carausius, a Menapian officer in the Roman navy who had seized power in Britain and northern Gaul in 286. In 293 Carausius was isolated when the western Caesar, Constantius Chlorus, retook some of his Gallic territories, particularly the crucial port of Bononia (modern Boulogne), and defeated Frankish allies of Carausius in Batavia. Allectus assassinated Carausius and assumed command himself.
His reign has left little record, although his coin issues display a similar distribution to those of Carausius. They are found in north western Gaul, indicating that the recapture of Bononia did not spell the end of the rebel empire on that side of the English Channel.

Constantius launched an invasion to depose him in September 296. His forces sailed in several divisions. Constantius led one division from Bononia, but seems to have been delayed by bad weather. Another division, under the praetorian prefect Asclepiodotus, took advantage of fog to avoid Allectus&#x27;s ships stationed at the Isle of Wight, and landed near Southampton Water, where they burnt their ships. Allectus&#x27;s forces were forced to retreat from the coast, but were cut off by another of Constantius&#x27;s divisions and defeated. Allectus himself was killed in the battle, having removed all insignia in the hope that his body would not be identified. Archaeology suggests that Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester) was the site of his defeat or the area surrounding the town. A group of Roman troops, who had been separated from the main body by the fog during the channel crossing, caught up with the remnants of Allectus&#x27;s men, mostly Franks, at Londinium (London), and massacred them. Constantius himself, it seems, did not reach Britain until it was all over, and his panegyrist claims he was welcomed by the Britons as a liberator.

Carausius had deliberately used his coinage for propaganda purposes, and some of his slogans, such as a claim to have restored &#x27;liberty&#x27;, were designed to appeal to British sentiment. Constantius answered such claims in a famous medal struck on the morrow of his victory, in which he described himself as &quot;redditor lucis aeternae&quot;, &#x27;restorer of the eternal light (viz. of Rome).&#x27;

In March 2019 an ancient coin showing the head of Allectus was found in Dover by a 30-year-old metal detectorist. The coin sold for £552,000 at an auction by Dix Noonan Webb.

==Legend==
Geoffrey of Monmouth included Allectus in his legendary &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot; (ca. 1136). Here, Allectus is an officer sent with three legions by the Romans to depose Carausius, a native British king. He does so, but his rule proves oppressive, and he is in turn deposed by Asclepiodotus, here the Duke of Cornwall. The last of Allectus&#x27;s troops are besieged in London, and surrender on the condition they are granted safe passage out of Britain. Asclepiodotus agrees, but the surrendering soldiers are massacred, and their heads thrown into the river Galobroc, by his allies the Venedoti.

==In fiction==
Allectus&#x27;s assassination of Carausius and the opposition to his regime, culminating in Constantius&#x27;s invasion, are central to Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s 1957 novel, &quot;The Silver Branch&quot;.

<doc id="142523" wikidata="Q32921" url="?curid=142523" title="Halothane">
<text>Halothane, sold under the brand name Fluothane among others, is a general anaesthetic. It can be used to induce or maintain anaesthesia. One of its benefits is that it does not increase the production of saliva, which can be particularly useful in those who are difficult to intubate. It is given by inhalation.
Side effects include an irregular heartbeat, respiratory depression, and hepatotoxicity. Like all volatile anesthetics, it should not be used in people with a personal or family history of malignant hyperthermia. It appears to be safe in porphyria. It is unclear whether its usage during pregnancy is harmful to the fetus, and its use during a C-section is generally discouraged. Halothane is a chiral molecule that is used as a racemic mixture.
Halothane was discovered in 1951. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1958. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Its use in developed countries has been mostly replaced by newer anesthetic agents such as sevoflurane. It is no longer commercially available in the United States. Halothane also contributes to ozone depletion.

==Medical uses==
It is a potent anesthetic with a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of 0.74%. Its blood/gas partition coefficient of 2.4 makes it an agent with moderate induction and recovery time. It is not a good analgesic and its muscle relaxation effect is moderate.

Halothane is colour-coded red on anaesthetic vaporisers.
==Side effects==
Side effects include irregular heartbeat, respiratory depression, and hepatotoxicity. It appears to be safe in porphyria. It is unclear whether use during pregnancy is harmful to the baby, and it is not generally recommended for use during a C-section.
In rare cases, repeated exposure to halothane in adults was noted to result in severe liver injury. This occurred in about one in 10,000 exposures. The resulting syndrome was referred to as halothane hepatitis, immunoallergic in origin, and is thought to result from the metabolism of halothane to trifluoroacetic acid via oxidative reactions in the liver. About 20% of inhaled halothane is metabolized by the liver and these products are excreted in the urine. The hepatitis syndrome had a mortality rate of 30% to 70%. Concern for hepatitis resulted in a dramatic reduction in the use of halothane for adults and it was replaced in the 1980s by enflurane and isoflurane. By 2005, the most common volatile anesthetics used were isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane. Since the risk of halothane hepatitis in children was substantially lower than in adults, halothane continued to be used in pediatrics in the 1990s as it was especially useful for inhalation induction of anesthesia. However, by 2000, sevoflurane, excellent for inhalation induction, had largely replaced the use of halothane in children.

Halothane sensitises the heart to catecholamines, so it is liable to cause cardiac arrhythmia, occasionally fatal, particularly if hypercapnia has been allowed to develop. This seems to be especially problematic in dental anesthesia.

Like all the potent inhalational anaesthetic agents, it is a potent trigger for malignant hyperthermia. Similarly, in common with the other potent inhalational agents, it relaxes uterine smooth muscle and this may increase blood loss during delivery or termination of pregnancy.

=== Occupational safety ===
People can be exposed to halothane in the workplace by breathing it in as waste anaesthetic gas, skin contact, eye contact, or swallowing it. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 2 ppm (16.2 mg/m3) over 60 minutes.

==Pharmacology==
The exact mechanism of the action of general anaesthetics has not been delineated. Halothane activates GABAA and glycine receptors. It also acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist, inhibits nACh and voltage-gated sodium channels, and activates 5-HT3 and twin-pore K+ channels. It does not affect the AMPA or kainate receptors.

==Chemical and physical properties==
Halothane (2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane) is a dense, highly volatile, clear, colourless, nonflammable liquid with a chloroform-like sweet odour. It is very slightly soluble in water and miscible with various organic solvents. Halothane can decompose to hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen bromide in the presence of light and heat.

Chemically, halothane is an alkyl halide (not an ether like many other anesthetics). The structure has one stereocenter, so (&quot;R&quot;)- and (&quot;S&quot;)-optical isomers occur.

==Synthesis==
The commercial synthesis of halothane starts from trichloroethylene, which is reacted with hydrogen fluoride in the presence of antimony trichloride at 130 °C to form 2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane. This is then reacted with bromine at 450 °C to produce halothane.

==Related substances==
Attempts to find anesthetics with less metabolism led to halogenated ethers such as enflurane and isoflurane. The incidence of hepatic reactions with these agents is lower. The exact degree of hepatotoxic potential of enflurane is debated, although it is minimally metabolized. Isoflurane is essentially not metabolized and reports of associated liver injury are quite rare. Small amounts of trifluoroacetic acid can be formed from both halothane and isoflurane metabolism and possibly accounts for cross sensitization of patients between these agents.

The main advantage of the more modern agents is lower blood solubility, resulting in faster induction of and recovery from anaesthesia.

==History==
Halothane was first synthesized by C. W. Suckling of Imperial Chemical Industries in 1951 at the ICI Widnes Laboratory and was first used clinically by M. Johnstone in Manchester in 1956. Initially, many pharmacologists and anaesthesiologists had doubts about the safety and efficacy of the new drug. But halothane, which required specialist knowledge and technologies for safe administration, also afforded British anaesthesiologists the opportunity to remake their speciality as a profession during a period, when the newly established National Health Service needed more specialist consultants. In this context, halothane eventually became popular as a nonflammable general anesthetic replacing other volatile anesthetics such as trichloroethylene, diethyl ether and cyclopropane. In many parts of the world it has been largely replaced by newer agents since the 1980s but is still widely used in developing countries because of its lower cost.

Halothane was given to many millions of people worldwide from its introduction in 1956 through the 1980s. Its properties include cardiac depression at high levels, cardiac sensitization to catecholamines such as norepinephrine, and potent bronchial relaxation. Its lack of airway irritation made it a common inhalation induction agent in pediatric anesthesia. 
Its use in developed countries has been mostly replaced by newer anesthetic agents such as sevoflurane. It is not commercially available in the United States.

==Society and culture==
===Availability===
It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a volatile liquid, at 30, 50, 200, and 250 ml per container but in many developed nations is not available having been displaced by newer agents.

It is the only inhalational anesthetic containing bromine, which makes it radiopaque. It is colorless and pleasant-smelling, but unstable in light. It is packaged in dark-colored bottles and contains 0.01% thymol as a stabilizing agent.

===Greenhouse gas===
Owing to the presence of covalently bonded fluorine, halothane absorbs in the atmospheric window and is therefore a greenhouse gas. However, it is much less potent than most other chlorofluorocarbons and bromofluorocarbons due to its short atmospheric lifetime, estimated at only one year vis-à-vis over 100 years for many perfluorocarbons. Despite its short lifespan, halothane still has a global warming potential 47 times that of carbon dioxide, although this is over 100 times smaller than the most abundant fluorinated gases, and about 800 times smaller than the GWP of sulfur hexafluoride over 500 years. Halothane is believed to make a negligible contribution to global warming.

===Ozone depletion===
Halothane is an ozone depleting substance with an ODP of 1.56 and it is calculated to be responsible for 1% of total stratospheric ozone layer depletion.

<text>In Japanese martial arts a is a short shout uttered when performing an assault.

Traditional Japanese dojo generally uses single syllables beginning with a vowel. The practice has become a part of Asian martial arts in popular culture, especially in martial arts films, in writing often rendered in variants such as &quot;Hi-yah!&quot;, &quot;Aiyah!&quot;, &quot;Eeee-yah!&quot; or &quot;Hyah!&quot;. A &quot;kiai&quot; is usually not the word &quot;kiai&quot; itself.

==Etymology==
The term is a compound of &quot;ki&quot; (), meaning &quot;energy&quot; or &quot;mood&quot; and &quot;a(u)&quot; (, infinitive &quot;ai&quot;), an emphatic marker. The same concept is known as &quot;kihap&quot; in many Korean martial arts, such as taekwondo and Tang Soo Do, &quot;ki&quot; being the &quot;energy&quot; and &quot;hap&quot; meaning &quot;to join&quot;, &quot;to harmonize&quot; or &quot;to amplify&quot;, based on the Korean reading of the same characters; its Hangul spelling is 기합.

In the board game &quot;Go&quot;, the term describes fighting spirit.

==Use in martial arts==

Students of Japanese martial arts such as aikido, karate, kobudo, kendo, taido or judo (or related arts such as taiko drumming) use &quot;kiai&quot; to startle an opponent, intimidate, express confidence or express victory. In kendo, for example, a point is only given by the Shinpan (referees) if the hit is accompanied by a strong, convincing &quot;kiai&quot;. A &quot;kiai&quot; can also be used besides tightening the core muscles to prevent damage to the stomach. The physical aspects of a &quot;kiai&quot; are often used to teach a student proper breathing technique when executing an attack which is a common trait adopted by many other foreign martial arts and combat sports. A &quot;kiai&quot; is also sometimes used to intimidate.

This is especially useful for longer series of attacks such as &quot;kirikaeshi&quot;, &quot;kakari geiko&quot; (rapid partner exercise creating openings) and &quot;uchikomi geiko&quot; (responding fast to openings made by the partner).

Mental imagery techniques are used to teach the martial artist to imagine starting a &quot;kiai&quot; in the hara or dantian; from a physiological perspective, this means the yell should start in the diaphragm, not the throat.

<text>Jeffrey Preston Bezos ( ; ; born January 12, 1964) is an American businessman best known as the founder, executive chairman, and former president and CEO of Amazon, the world&#x27;s largest e-commerce and cloud computing company. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, as of 17 February 2025, Bezos&#x27; estimated net worth stood at US$241.9 billion, making him the third richest individual in the world. He was the wealthiest person from 2017 to 2021, according to &quot;Forbes&quot; and the &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot;.

Bezos was born in Albuquerque and raised in Houston and Miami. He graduated from Princeton University in 1986 with degrees in electrical engineering and computer science. He worked on Wall Street in a variety of related fields from 1986 to early 1994. Bezos founded Amazon in mid-1994 on a road trip from New York City to Seattle. The company began as an online bookstore and has since expanded to a variety of other e-commerce products and services, including video and audio streaming, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. It is the world&#x27;s largest online sales company, the largest Internet company by revenue, and the largest provider of virtual assistants and cloud infrastructure services through its Amazon Web Services branch.

Bezos founded the aerospace manufacturer and sub-orbital spaceflight services company Blue Origin in 2000. Blue Origin&#x27;s New Shepard vehicle reached space in 2015 and afterwards successfully landed back on Earth; he flew into space on Blue Origin NS-16 in 2021. He purchased the major American newspaper &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2013 for $250 million and manages many other investments through his venture capital firm, Bezos Expeditions. In September 2021, Bezos co-founded Altos Labs with Mail.ru founder Yuri Milner.

The first centibillionaire on the &quot;Forbes&quot; Real Time Billionaires Index and the second ever to have achieved the feat since Bill Gates in 1999, Bezos was named the &quot;richest man in modern history&quot; after his net worth increased to $150 billion in July 2018. In August 2020, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;, he had a net worth exceeding $200 billion. On July 5, 2021, Bezos stepped down as the CEO and president of Amazon and took over the role of executive chairman. Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy succeeded Bezos as the CEO and president of Amazon.

== Early life and education ==
Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen was born on January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, as the son of Jacklyn (née Gise) and Ted Jorgensen. At the time of Jeff&#x27;s birth, his mother was a 17-year-old high-school student and his father was 19. Ted was a Danish American unicyclist born in Chicago to a family of Baptists. After completing high school despite challenging conditions, Jacklyn attended night school, bringing her baby with her. Jeff attended a Montessori school in Albuquerque when he was 2.

Ted struggled with alcohol and with his finances. Jacklyn left her husband to live with her parents, filing for divorce in June 1965 when Jeff was 17 months old. After his parents divorced, his mother married Cuban immigrant Miguel &quot;Mike&quot; Bezos in April 1968. Shortly after the wedding, Mike adopted 4-year-old Jeff, whose surname was then legally changed from Jorgensen to Bezos. Jacklyn, her husband, and her son left the area and asked Ted to discontinue contact, to which he agreed.

After Mike received his degree from the University of New Mexico, the family moved to Houston, Texas, so that he could begin working as an engineer for Exxon. Jeff attended River Oaks Elementary School in Houston from fourth to sixth grade. Jeff&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Lawrence Preston Gise, a regional director of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in Albuquerque.

Lawrence retired early to his family&#x27;s ranch near Cotulla, Texas, where his grandson would spend many summers in his youth and which he would later purchase and expand from to . Jeff displayed scientific interests and technological proficiency and once rigged an electric alarm to keep his younger half-siblings out of his room. The family moved to Miami, Florida, where Jeff attended Miami Palmetto High School. In high school, he worked at McDonald&#x27;s as a short-order line cook during the breakfast shift.

Bezos attended the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida. He was high school valedictorian, a National Merit Scholar, and a Silver Knight Award winner in 1982. In his graduation speech, Bezos told the audience that he dreamed of the day when mankind would colonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention &quot;to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge national park&quot;.

After graduating from high school in 1982, Bezos attended Princeton University. He initially majored in physics but later switched to electrical engineering and computer science. In 2018, during a talk at The Economic Club of Washington, D.C., Bezos revealed that, some thirty years ago, his Princeton classmate Yasantha Rajakarunanayake had defeated him in solving a mathematical problem, causing him to give up on his dreams of becoming a theoretical physicist.

Bezos was a member of the Quadrangle Club, one of Princeton&#x27;s 11 eating clubs. Additionally, he was the president of the Princeton chapter of the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS). He had a 4.2 GPA and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and Tau Beta Pi. Bezos graduated from Princeton in 1986 with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering (BSE), &quot;summa cum laude&quot;.

== Business career ==
=== Early career ===
After Bezos graduated from college in 1986, he was offered jobs at Intel, Bell Labs, and Andersen Consulting, among others. He first worked at Fitel, a fintech telecommunications start-up, where he was tasked with building a network for international trade. Bezos was promoted to head of development and director of customer service. He transitioned into the banking industry when he became a product manager at Bankers Trust from 1988 to 1990. From 1990 to 1994, he worked at D. E. Shaw &amp; Co, a newly created hedge fund with a strong emphasis on mathematical modelling. Bezos became D. E. Shaw&#x27;s fourth senior vice-president by age 30.

=== Amazon ===

In spring 1994, Bezos read that web usage was growing at a rate of 2300% a year and eventually decided to establish an online bookstore. He and his then-wife, MacKenzie Scott, left their jobs at D. E. Shaw and founded Amazon in a rented garage in Bellevue, Washington on July 5, 1994, after writing its business plan on a cross-country drive from New York City to Seattle. With Bezos at the helm and Scott taking an integral role in its operation—writing checks, keeping track of the books, and negotiating the company&#x27;s first freight contracts—the foundation was laid for this garage-run operation to grow exponentially. Prior to settling in Seattle, Bezos had investigated setting up his company at an Indian reservation near San Francisco in order to avoid paying taxes. Bezos initially named his new company &quot;Cadabra&quot; but later changed the name to &quot;Amazon&quot; after the Amazon River in South America, in part because the name begins with the letter &quot;A&quot;, which is at the beginning of the alphabet. At the time, website listings were alphabetized, so a name starting with &quot;A&quot; would appear sooner when customers conducted online searches. In addition, he regarded &quot;Amazon,&quot; the name of the world&#x27;s largest river as fitting for what he hoped would become the world&#x27;s largest online bookstore. He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents as an investment in Amazon. He warned many early investors that there was a 70% chance that Amazon would fail or go bankrupt. Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products. Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he took it public with an initial public offering (IPO). In response to critical reports from &quot;Fortune&quot; and &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot;, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake competition from larger book retailers such as Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble.

In 1998, Bezos diversified into the online sale of music and video, and by the end of the year he had expanded the company&#x27;s products to include a variety of other consumer goods. Bezos used the $54 million raised during the company&#x27;s 1997 equity offering to finance the aggressive acquisition of smaller competitors. Among these acquisitions were his purchase of a majority stake in pets.com in 1999 and a purchase of a portion of kozmo.com for $60 million, both of which would fail after the dot-com bubble collapse in 2000. By the end of 2000, Bezos borrowed $2 billion from banks, as its cash balances dipped to only $350 million. However, the company continued to expand despite its losses, and in 2002, Bezos led Amazon to launch Amazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels and website traffic. Revenues stagnated later that year, and after the company nearly went bankrupt, he closed distribution centers and laid off 14% of the Amazon workforce. In 2003, Amazon rebounded from financial instability and turned a profit of $35 million.

In November 2007, Bezos launched the Amazon Kindle. According to a 2008 &quot;Time&quot; profile, Bezos wished to create a device that allowed a &quot;flow state&quot; in reading similar to the experience of video games. In 2013, Bezos secured a $600-million contract with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on behalf of Amazon Web Services. In October of that year, Amazon was recognized as the largest online shopping retailer in the world.
In May 2016, Bezos sold slightly more than one million shares of his holdings in the company for $671 million, the largest sum he had ever raised from selling some of his Amazon stock. On August 4, 2016, Bezos sold another million of his shares for $756.7 million. A year later, Bezos took on 130,000 new employees when he ramped up hiring at company distribution centers. By January 19, 2018, his Amazon stock holdings had appreciated to slightly over $109 billion; months later he began to sell stock to raise cash for other enterprises, in particular, Blue Origin. On January 29, 2018, he was featured in Amazon&#x27;s Super Bowl commercial. On February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its highest ever profit with quarterly earnings of $2 billion. Due to the growth of Alibaba in China, Bezos has often expressed interest in expanding Amazon into India. On July 27, 2017, Bezos momentarily became the world&#x27;s wealthiest person over Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates when his estimated net worth increased to just over $90 billion. His wealth surpassed $100 billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, and he was formally designated the wealthiest person in the world by &quot;Forbes&quot; on March 6, 2018, with a net worth of $112 billion.
In March 2018, Bezos dispatched Amit Agarwal, Amazon&#x27;s global senior vice president, to India with $5.5 billion to localize operations throughout the company&#x27;s supply chain routes. Later in the month, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Amazon and Bezos, specifically, of sales tax avoidance, misusing postal routes, and anti-competitive business practices. Amazon&#x27;s share price fell by 9% in response to the President&#x27;s negative comments; this reduced Bezos&#x27;s personal wealth by $10.7 billion. Weeks later, Bezos recouped his losses when academic reports out of Stanford University indicated that Trump could do little to regulate Amazon in any meaningful way. During July 2018, a number of members of the U.S. Congress called on Bezos to detail the applications of Amazon&#x27;s face recognition software, Rekognition.
Criticism of Amazon&#x27;s business practices continued in September 2018 when Senator Bernie Sanders introduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act and accused Amazon of receiving corporate welfare. This followed revelations by the non-profit group New Food Economy which found that one third of Amazon workers in Arizona, and one tenth of Amazon workers in Pennsylvania and Ohio, relied on food stamps. While preparing to introduce the bill, Sanders opined: &quot;Instead of attempting to explore Mars or go to the moon, how about Jeff Bezos pays his workers a living wage?&quot; He later said: &quot;Bezos could play a profound role. If he said today, nobody who is employed at Amazon will receive less than a living wage, it would send a message to every corporation in America.&quot; Sanders&#x27;s efforts elicited a response from Amazon which pointed to the 130,000 jobs it created in 2017 and called the $28,446 figure for its median salary &quot;misleading&quot; as it included part-time workers. However, Sanders countered that the companies targeted by his proposal have placed an increased focus on part-time workers to escape benefit obligations. On October 2, 2018, Bezos announced a company-wide wage increase, which Sanders applauded. The American workers who were being paid the minimum wage had this increased to $15 per hour, a decision that was interpreted as support for the Fight for $15 movement.

In February 2021, Bezos announced that in the third quarter of 2021 he would step down from his role as CEO of Amazon to become the Executive Chairman of the Amazon Board. He was succeeded as CEO by Andy Jassy. On February 2, 2021, Bezos sent an email to all Amazon employees, telling them the transition would give him &quot;the time and energy [he] need[s] to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and [his] other passions.&quot; In February 2024, Bezos sold 24 million shares in Amazon at a total value of $4 billion. Bezos announced that he intended to sell 50 million shares in Amazon over the next year. During an interview at the DealBook Summit in December 2024, Bezos said that he was dedicating 95% of his time to artificial intelligence initiatives at Amazon.

=== Blue Origin ===


In September 2000, Bezos founded Blue Origin, a human spaceflight startup. Bezos has long expressed an interest in space travel and the development of human life in the Solar System. His 1982 high school valedictorian senior graduation speech was followed up with a &quot;Miami Herald&quot; interview in which he expressed an interest to build and develop hotels, amusement parks, and colonies for human beings who were in orbit. The 18-year-old Bezos stated that he wanted to preserve Earth from overuse through resource depletion. Rob Meyerson led Blue Origin from 2003 to 2017 and served as its first president.

After its founding, Blue Origin maintained a low profile until 2006 when it purchased a large tract of land in West Texas for a launch and test facility. After the company gained the public&#x27;s attention during the late 2000s, Bezos additionally indicated his interest in reducing the cost of space travel for humans while also increasing the safety of extraterrestrial travel. In September 2011, one of the company&#x27;s uncrewed prototype vehicles crashed during a short-hop test flight. Although the crash was viewed as a setback, news outlets noted how far the company went from its founding-to-date in advancing spaceflight. After the crash, Bezos has been superstitiously wearing his &quot;lucky&quot; Texas Cowboy boots to all rocket launches. In May 2013, Bezos met with Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Galactic, to discuss commercial spaceflight opportunities and strategies. He has been compared to Branson and Elon Musk as all three are billionaires who prioritize spaceflight among their business interests.

In 2015, Bezos announced that a new orbital launch vehicle was under development and would make its first flight in the late-2010s. Later in November, Blue Origin&#x27;s New Shepard space vehicle successfully rocketed into space and reached its planned test altitude of 329,839 feet (100.5 kilometers) before executing a vertical landing back at the launch site in West Texas. In 2016, Bezos allowed select journalists to visit, tour, and photograph his facility. He has repeatedly called for increased inter-space energy and industrial manufacturing to decrease the negative costs associated with business-related pollution.

In December 2017, New Shepard successfully flew and landed dummy passengers, amending and pushing its human space travel start date into late 2018. To execute this program, Blue Origin built six of the vehicles to support all phases of testing and operations: no-passenger test flights, flights with test passengers, and commercial-passenger weekly operations. Since 2016, Bezos has spoken more freely about his hopes to colonize the solar system, and has been selling $1 billion in Amazon stock each year to capitalize Blue Origin in an effort to support this endeavor. In May 2018, Bezos maintained that the primary goal of Blue Origin is to preserve the natural resources of Earth by making the human species multi-planetary. He announced that &quot;New Shepard&quot; would begin transporting humans into sub-orbital space by November 2018. In July 2018, it was announced that Bezos had priced commercial spaceflight tickets from $200,000 to $300,000 per person.

====Spaceflight====

On July 20, 2021, he launched on the NS-16 mission with his half-brother Mark Bezos, Wally Funk, and Oliver Daemen. He launched nine days after Richard Branson launched on board the Virgin Galactic Unity 22 mission. Bezos&#x27;s suborbital flight lasted over 10 minutes, reaching a peak altitude of .

=== &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ===

On August 5, 2013, Bezos announced his purchase of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; for $250 million in cash, at the suggestion of his friend, Don Graham. To execute the sale, he established limited liability company Nash Holdings to serve as a holding company through which he would own the newspaper. The sale closed on October 1, 2013, and Nash Holdings took control. In March 2014, Bezos made his first significant change at &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and lifted the online paywall for subscribers of a number of U.S. local newspapers in Texas, Hawaii, and Minnesota. In January 2016, Bezos set out to reinvent the newspaper as a media and technology company by reconstructing its digital media, mobile platforms, and analytics software. After a surge in online readership in 2016, the paper was profitable for the first time since Bezos made the purchase in 2013. However, Bezos&#x27; ownership of the &quot;Post&quot; has been subject to scrutiny and criticism regarding his treatment of employees as well as his influence on the paper&#x27;s content, in particular 2024-25 interference with the editorial and opinion pages.

=== Bezos Expeditions ===

Bezos makes personal investments through his venture capital vehicle, Bezos Expeditions. He was one of the first shareholders in Google, when he invested $250,000 in 1998. That $250,000 investment resulted in 3.3 million shares of Google stock, worth about $3.1 billion in 2017. He also invested in Unity Biotechnology, a life-extension research firm hoping to slow or stop the process of aging. Bezos is involved in the healthcare sector, which includes investments in Unity Biotechnology, GRAIL, Juno Therapeutics, and Zocdoc. In January 2018, an announcement was made concerning Bezos&#x27;s role within a new, unnamed healthcare company. This venture, later named Haven, is expected to be a partnership between Amazon, JPMorgan, and Berkshire Hathaway.

Bezos also supports philanthropic efforts through direct donations and non-profit projects funded by Bezos Expeditions. Bezos used Bezos Expeditions to fund several philanthropic projects, including an Innovation center at the Seattle Museum of History and Industry and the Bezos Center for Neural Circuit Dynamics at Princeton Neuroscience Institute. In 2013, Bezos Expeditions funded the recovery of two Saturn V first-stage Rocketdyne F-1 engines from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. They were positively identified as belonging to the Apollo 11 mission&#x27;s S-1C stage from July 1969. The engines are currently on display at the Seattle Museum of Flight.

=== Altos Labs ===

In September 2021, Bezos co-founded Altos Labs with Mail.ru founder Yuri Milner. Altos Labs is a well-funded biotechnology company dedicated to harnessing cellular reprogramming to develop longevity therapeutics. The company has recruited prominent scientists such as Juan Carlos Izpisúa Belmonte (known for work on rejuvenation through reprogramming), Steve Horvath (known for work in epigenetic aging clocks), and Shinya Yamanaka (the Nobel Prize-winning inventor of cellular reprogramming in mammalian cells). The company left stealth mode and launched on January 19, 2022, with a start capital of $3 billion and an executive team led by Hal Barron.

== Public image ==

Journalist Nellie Bowles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; has described the public persona and personality of Bezos as that of &quot;a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan&quot;. During the 1990s, Bezos earned a reputation for relentlessly pushing Amazon forward, often at the expense of public charity and social welfare. Journalist Mark O&#x27;Connell criticized Bezos&#x27;s relentless customer focus as &quot;very small&quot; in terms of impact on humanity as a whole, a sentiment technologist Tim O&#x27;Reilly agreed with. His business practices projected a public image of prudence and parsimony with his own wealth and that of Amazon. In 1999, Bezos was worth $10 billion yet drove a 1996 Honda Accord. Throughout the early 2000s, he was perceived to be geeky or nerdy.

Bezos was seen by some as needlessly quantitative and data-driven. This perception was detailed by Alan Deutschman, who described him as &quot;talking in lists&quot; and &quot;[enumerating] the criteria, in order of importance, for every decision he has made&quot;. Select accounts of his persona have drawn controversy and public attention. Notably, journalist Brad Stone wrote a book that described Bezos as a demanding boss as well as hyper-competitive, and opined that Bezos perhaps &quot;bet the biggest on the Internet&quot; than anyone else. Bezos has been characterized as a notoriously opportunistic CEO who operates with little concern for obstacles and externalities.

During the early 2010s, Bezos solidified his reputation for aggressive business practices, and his public image began to shift. Bezos started to wear tailored clothing; he weight trained, pursued a regimented diet and began to freely spend his money. His physical transformation has been compared to the transformation of Amazon; he is often referred to as the metonym of the company. Since 2017, he has been portrayed by Kyle Mooney and Steve Carell on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, usually as an undercutting, domineering figure. His physical appearance increased the public&#x27;s perception of him as a symbolically dominant figure in business and in popular culture, wherein he has been parodied as an enterprising supervillain.

In May 2014, the International Trade Union Confederation named Bezos the &quot;World&#x27;s Worst Boss&quot;, with its general secretary Sharan Burrow saying: &quot;Jeff Bezos represents the inhumanity of employers who are promoting the North American corporate model&quot;, while in 2019, &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot;, which ranked Bezos the best-performing CEO for 4 years in a row since 2014, did not rank him even in the top 100, citing Amazon&#x27;s &quot;relatively low ESG (environment, social, and governance) scores&quot; that reflect &quot;risks created by working conditions and employment policies, data security, and antitrust issues&quot;.

During the late 2010s, Bezos reversed his reputation for being reluctant to spend money on non-business-related expenses. His relative lack of philanthropy compared to other billionaires has drawn a negative response from the public since 2016. Bezos has been known to publicly contest claims made in critical articles, as exemplified in 2015 when he sent a memo to employees denouncing a &quot;New York Times&quot; piece.

=== Leadership style ===
Bezos used what he called a &quot;regret-minimization framework&quot; while working at D. E. Shaw and again during the early years of Amazon. He described this life philosophy by stating: &quot;When I&#x27;m 80, am I going to regret leaving Wall Street? No. Will I regret missing the beginning of the Internet? Yes.&quot; During the 1990s and early 2000s at Amazon, he was characterized as trying to quantify all aspects of running the company, often listing employees on spreadsheets and basing executive decisions on data. To push Amazon forward, Bezos developed the mantra &quot;Get Big Fast&quot;, establishing the company&#x27;s need to scale its operations to produce market dominance. He favored diverting Amazon profits back into the company in lieu of allocating it amongst shareholders in the form of dividends.

Bezos uses the term &quot;work–life harmony&quot; instead of the more standard &quot;work–life balance&quot; because he believes that &quot;balance&quot; implies that you can only have one and not the other. He believes that work and home life are interconnected, informing and calibrating each other. Journalist Walt Mossberg dubbed the idea that someone who cannot tolerate criticism or critique should not do anything new or interesting &quot;&quot;. Bezos does not schedule early morning meetings and enforces a two-pizza rule—a preference that meetings are small enough for two pizzas to feed everyone in the boardroom. When interviewing candidates for jobs at Amazon, he has stated he considers three inquiries: can he admire the person, can the person raise the common standard, and under what circumstances could the person become exemplary.

In 2018, it was reported that he met with Amazon investors for just six hours a year. Instead of using presentation slides, Bezos requires high-level employees to present information with six-page narratives. Since 1998, Bezos has published an annual letter for Amazon shareholders wherein he frequently refers to five principles: focus on customers, not competitors; take risks for market leadership; facilitate staff morale; build a company culture; and empower people. Bezos maintains the email address jeff@amazon.com as an outlet for customers to reach out to him and the company. Although he does not respond to the emails, he forwards some of them with a question mark in the subject line to executives, who then attempt to address the issues. Bezos has cited Jeff Immelt of New Enterprise Associates, Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, and Bob Iger of The Walt Disney Company as major influences on his leadership style.

== Wealth ==
Bezos first became a millionaire in 1997 after raising $54 million through Amazon&#x27;s initial public offering (IPO). He was first included on the &quot;Forbes&quot; &quot;World&#x27;s Billionaires&quot; list in 1999 with an estimated net worth of $10.1 billion, which placed his on the 19th position in the world and 10th in the USA. His net worth decreased to $6.1 billion a year later, a 40.5% drop. His wealth plummeted even more the following year, dropping 66.6% to $2.0 billion. He lost $500 million the following year, which brought his net worth down to $1.5 billion. The following year, his net worth increased by 66.66% to $2.5 billion. From 2005 to 2007, he quadrupled his net worth to $8.7 billion. After the financial crisis and succeeding economic recession, his net worth would decrease to $6.8 billion—a 17.7% drop. His wealth rose by 85.2% in 2010, leaving him with $12.6 billion. This percentage increase ascended him to the 43rd spot on the ranking from 68th.

After a rumor broke out that Amazon was developing a smartphone, Bezos&#x27;s net worth rose to $30.5 billion in 2014. A year later, he entered the top ten when he increased his net worth to a total of $50.3 billion. Bezos rose to become the fifth richest person in the world hours before market close; he gained $7 billion in one hour. By the time the &quot;Forbes&quot; list was calculated in March 2016, his net worth was registered at $45.2 billion. However, just months later in October 2016, his wealth increased by $16.2 billion to $66.5 billion, unofficially ranking him the third-richest person in the world, behind Warren Buffett. After sporadic jumps in Amazon&#x27;s share price, in July 2017 he briefly unseated Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the wealthiest person in the world.

Bezos would continue to sporadically surpass Gates throughout the month of October 2017 after Amazon&#x27;s share price fluctuated. His net worth surpassed $100 billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, after Amazon&#x27;s share price increased by more than 2.5%. When the 2017 list was issued, Bezos&#x27;s net worth was registered at $72.8 billion, adding $27.6 billion from the previous year. His wealth&#x27;s rapid growth from 2016 to 2017 sparked a variety of assessments about how much money Bezos earned on a controlled, reduced time scale. On October 10, 2017, he made an estimated $6.24 billion in 5 minutes, slightly less than the then annual gross domestic product of Kyrgyzstan.

On March 6, 2018, Bezos was designated the wealthiest person in the world, with a registered net worth of $112 billion. He unseated Bill Gates ($90 billion), who was $6 billion ahead of Warren Buffett ($84 billion), ranked third. He is considered the first registered centi-billionaire (not adjusted for inflation).

His wealth, in 2017–18 terms, equaled that of 2.7 million Americans. Bezos&#x27;s net worth increased by $33.6 billion from January 2017 to January 2018. This increase outstripped the economic development (in GDP terms) of more than 96 countries around the world. During March 9, Bezos earned $230,000 every 60 seconds. &quot;The Motley Fool&quot; estimated that if Bezos had not sold any of his shares from its original public offering in 1997, his net worth would sit at $181 billion in 2018. According to &quot;Quartz&quot;, his net worth of $150 billion in July 2018 was enough to purchase the entire stock markets of Nigeria, Hungary, Egypt, Luxembourg, and Iran. Following the report by &quot;Quartz&quot;, Amazon workers in Poland, (Germany), and Spain participated in demonstrations and labor strikes to draw attention to his growing wealth and the lack of compensation, labor rights, and satisfactory working conditions of select Amazon workers. On July 17, 2018, he was designated the &quot;wealthiest person in modern history&quot; by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, &quot;Fortune&quot;, &quot;MarketWatch&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and &quot;Forbes&quot;.

In 2019, Bezos&#x27;s wealth was reduced by the divorce from his wife MacKenzie Bezos. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, had the Washington state common law applied to their divorce without a prenuptial agreement, Bezos&#x27;s wealth could have been equitably divided with his ex-wife; however, she eventually received 25% of Bezos&#x27;s Amazon shares, then valued at approximately $36 billion, making her the third-richest woman in the world. Bezos retained his interest in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and Blue Origin, as well as voting control of the shares received by his ex-wife.

In June 2019, Bezos purchased three adjoining apartments overlooking Madison Square Park in Manhattan, including a penthouse, for a combined total of $80 million, making this one of the most expensive real estate purchases within New York City in 2019. Bezos had also purchased three adjoining apartments at 25 Central Park West in Manhattan for $7.65 million in 1999; he bought a fourth unit in that building for $5.3 million in 2012.

In February 2020, Bezos purchased the Warner Estate from David Geffen for $165 million, a record price paid for a residence in the Los Angeles area. The previous record high price of $150 million was paid by Lachlan Murdoch for the Chartwell Mansion. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was reported that Bezos&#x27;s fortune had grown by $24 billion, citing a surge in demand from households on lockdown shopping on Amazon. He further expanded his residential holdings in February 2022, purchasing a $16.13-million-dollar apartment at a 24-story boutique condominium, located across from Madison Square Park in the Flatiron neighbourhood, where he already owns all the units on the top floors. Bezos is the owner of the &quot;Y721&quot;, a luxury superyacht estimated to cost more than $500,000,000; it is the largest yacht in the world. According to &quot;Forbes&quot; Bezos was the second-wealthiest person in America and the third-wealthiest person in the world in 2023. Bezos is the second-wealthiest person in the world according to &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot;. His net worth is about $197 billion as of February 2024.

== Criticism ==
Bezos is known for creating an adversarial environment at Amazon, as well as insulting and verbally abusing his employees. As journalist Brad Stone revealed in his book &quot;The Everything Store&quot;, Bezos issued remarks to his employees such as &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, did I take my stupid pills today?&quot;, &quot;Are you lazy or just incompetent?&quot;, and &quot;Why are you ruining my life?&quot; Additionally, Bezos reportedly pitted Amazon teams against each other, and once refused to give Amazon employees city bus passes in order to discourage them from leaving the office.

Throughout his early years of ownership of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Bezos was accused of having a potential conflict of interest with the paper. Bezos and the newspaper&#x27;s editorial board have dismissed accusations that he unfairly controlled the paper&#x27;s content, and Bezos maintains that the paper is independent. Bezos&#x27; treatment of employees at &quot;The Washington Post&quot; has also drawn scrutiny. In 2018, more than 400 &quot;Washington Post&quot; employees wrote an open letter to Bezos criticizing his poor wages and benefits for his employees. The letter demanded &quot;Fair wages; fair benefits for retirement, family leave and health care; and a fair amount of job security&quot;. Around 750 employees at &quot;The Washington Post&quot; went on a brief strike in December 2023 in response to Bezos&#x27; plans to lay off staff.

In 2024, Bezos blocked the &quot;Washington Post&quot;″s editorial board from endorsing Kamala Harris in the presidential election. The move was criticized by former editor Marty Baron, who considered it to be an act of &quot;disturbing spinelessness at an institution famed for courage&quot; and said that it would invite intimidation of Bezos by Donald Trump. Editor-at-large Robert Kagan and columnist Michele Norris also resigned in the wake of the decision, and editor David Maraniss said that the paper was &quot;dying in darkness.&quot; &quot;Post&quot; opinion columnists jointly authored an article calling the decision to not endorse a &quot;terrible mistake&quot;, and it was condemned by the Washington Post Guild, a union unit representing &quot;Post&quot; employees. More than 250,000 people (about ten percent of the &quot;Post&quot;″s subscribers) cancelled their subscriptions, and three members of the editorial board left the board. Condemning the &quot;Post&quot;″s decision, several columnists, including Will Bunch, Jonathan Last, Dan Froomkin, Donna Ladd and Sewell Chan, described it as an example of what historian Timothy Snyder calls . Snyder, too, condemned the decision.

In January 2025, editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned from the &quot;Post&quot; after it refused to run a satirical cartoon critical of the relationship between American billionaires and President Donald Trump, sparking conversations about the paper&#x27;s ownership under Bezos; Telnaes called the decision &quot;dangerous for a free press.&quot; In February 2025, Bezos announced that the opinion section of the &quot;Post&quot; will give voice only to opinions that support &quot;personal liberties&quot; and &quot;free markets,&quot; and that divergent opinions will not be published by the &quot;Post&quot;. David Shipley, &quot;The Post&quot;’s opinion editor, resigned after trying to persuade Bezos to reconsider the new direction.

Due to his considerable influence on industry, politics, and media, Bezos has been described as an oligarch.

== Personal life ==

In 1992, while working for D. E. Shaw in Manhattan, Bezos met novelist MacKenzie Tuttle, who was a research associate at the firm; the couple married a year later. In 1994, they moved across the country to Seattle, Washington, where Bezos founded Amazon. Bezos and his now ex-wife MacKenzie are the parents of four children: three sons, and a daughter adopted from China.

In March 2003, Bezos was a passenger in a helicopter that crashed in West Texas while surveying land to buy for Blue Origin; the other three occupants in the helicopter were pilot Charles &quot;Cheater&quot; Bella, Amazon lawyer Elizabeth Korrell, and local rancher Ty Holland. All survived; Bezos sustained only minor injuries and was discharged from a local hospital the same day.

Bezos portrayed a Starfleet official in the 2016 movie &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot;, and joined the cast and crew at a San Diego Comic-Con screening. He had lobbied Paramount for the role apropos of Alexa and his personal/professional interest in speech recognition. His one line consisted of a response to an alien in distress: &quot;Speak Normally.&quot; In his initial discussion of the project which became Alexa with his technical advisor Greg Hart in 2011, Bezos told him that the goal was to create &quot;the &quot;Star Trek&quot; computer.&quot; Bezos&#x27;s family corporation Zefram LLC is named after Zefram Cochrane, a character from &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

In January 2019, Bezos and his wife MacKenzie released a joint statement which revealed that they would be getting divorced after 25 years together. Subsequently, &quot;National Enquirer&quot; revealed that Bezos had an affair with media personality Lauren Sánchez; the affair with Sánchez had lasted for months. Later, Bezos published an online essay on February 7, 2019, in which he accused American Media, Inc. owner David Pecker of &quot;extortion and blackmail&quot; for threatening to publish intimate photos of Bezos and current girlfriend Lauren Sánchez if he did not stop his investigation into how his text messages and other photos had been leaked to the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;. Media reports have accused Sánchez&#x27;s brother Michael of being the source for the photos obtained by &quot;National Enquirer&quot;; however, Bezos has speculated that it may have been the Saudi Arabian government.

On April 4, 2019, the divorce was finalized, with Bezos keeping 75% of the couple&#x27;s Amazon stock and MacKenzie getting the remaining 25% ($35.6 billion). However, Bezos would keep all of the couple&#x27;s voting rights. On May 22, 2023, Sánchez and Bezos became engaged. He is the Honorary Chair of the Explorers Club.

== Politics ==
According to public campaign finance records, Bezos supported the electoral campaigns of Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, two Democratic U.S. senators from Washington. He has also supported Democrats U.S. representative John Conyers, as well as Patrick Leahy and Republican Spencer Abraham, U.S. senators serving on committees dealing with Internet-related issues. Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Bezos have supported the legalization of same-sex marriage, and in 2012 contributed $2.5 million to Washington United for Marriage, a group supporting a yes vote on Washington Referendum 74, which affirmed a same-sex marriage law enacted in the state. Bezos donated $100,000 towards a movement against a Washington state income tax in 2010 for &quot;top earners&quot;. In 2012, he donated to Amazon&#x27;s political action committee (PAC), which has given $56,000 and $74,500 to Democrats and Republicans, respectively.

After the 2016 presidential election, Bezos was invited to join Donald Trump&#x27;s Defense Innovation Advisory Board, an advisory council to improve the technology used by the Defense Department. Trump has repeatedly criticized Bezos via Twitter, accused Bezos of avoiding corporate taxes, gaining undue political influence, and undermining his presidency by spreading &quot;fake news&quot;. Nevertheless, Bezos congratulated Trump on his second election victory, posting on X, “Big congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory. No nation has bigger opportunities. Wishing Donald Trump all success in leading and uniting the America we all love”.

In 2014, Amazon won a bid for a cloud computing contract with the CIA valued at $600 million. A 2018, $10 billion contract known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) project, this time with the Pentagon, was allegedly written up in a way that favors Amazon. Controversy over this was raised when General James Mattis accepted a headquarters tour invitation from Bezos and co-ordinated the deal through Sally Donnelly, a lobbyist who previously worked for Amazon. In November 2019, when the contract was awarded to Microsoft instead, Amazon filed a lawsuit with allegations that the bidding process was biased. On July 6, 2021, the Pentagon cancelled the JEDI contract with Microsoft, citing that &quot;due to evolving requirements, increased cloud conversancy, and industry advances, the JEDI Cloud contract no longer meets its needs.&quot; Despite Bezos&#x27;s support for an open borders policy towards immigrants, Amazon has actively marketed facial recognition software to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

In 2019, a political action committee linked to Bezos spent over $1 million in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat the reelection bid of Seattle city council member and activist Kshama Sawant. On November 22, 2021, Jeff Bezos donated $100 million to the Obama Foundation to &quot;help expand the scope of programming that reaches emerging leaders&quot;, and requested the Obama Presidential Center&#x27;s plaza to be named after John Lewis.

=== Saudi hacking claim ===

In March 2018, Bezos met in Seattle with Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, to discuss investment opportunities for Saudi Vision 2030. In March 2019, Bezos&#x27;s security consultant accused the Saudi government of hacking Bezos&#x27;s phone. According to BBC, Bezos&#x27;s top security staffer, Gavin de Becker, &quot;linked the hack to the &quot;Washington Post&quot;″s coverage of the murder of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul&quot;. Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and dissident was employed as a writer at the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, owned by Bezos. Khashoggi was killed in late 2018 in Turkey&#x27;s Saudi consulate for his critical stance and journalism against the Saudi government and its leader. In January 2020, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the hack was initiated before the murder but after Khashoggi wrote critically about the crown prince in the &quot;Washington Post&quot;. Forensic analysis of Bezos&#x27;s mobile phone conducted by advisory firm FTI Consulting, concluded it &quot;highly probable&quot; that the hack was achieved using a malicious file hidden in a video sent in a WhatsApp message to Bezos from the personal account of the crown prince on May 1, 2018. Saudi Arabia has denied the claim.

== Philanthropy ==

Bezos donated to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center several times between 2009 and 2017. In 2013, he pledged $500,000 to Worldreader, a non-profit founded by a former Amazon employee. In September 2018, &quot;Business Insider&quot; reported that Bezos was the only one of the top five billionaires in the world who had not signed the Giving Pledge, an initiative created by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett that encourages wealthy people to give away a majority of their wealth. That same month, Janet Camarena, director of transparency initiatives at Foundation Center, was quoted by CNBC as having questions about Bezos&#x27;s new Day 1 Fund, including the fund&#x27;s structure and how exactly it will be funded.

In May 2017, Bezos gave $1 million to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which provides pro bono legal services for American journalists. On June 15, 2017, he posted a message on Twitter asking for ideas for philanthropy: &quot;I&#x27;m thinking about a philanthropy strategy that is the opposite of how I mostly spend my time—working on the long term&quot;. At the time of the post, Bezos&#x27;s lifetime spending on charitable causes was estimated to be $100 million. Multiple opinion columnists responded by asking Bezos to pay higher wages to Amazon warehouse workers. A year later in June, he tweeted that he would announce two philanthropic foci by the end of summer 2018. Bezos announced in September 2018 that he would commit approximately $2 billion to a fund to deal with American homelessness and establish a network of non-profit preschools for low income communities. As part of this announcement, he committed to establishing the &quot;Day 1 Families Fund&quot; to finance &quot;night shelters and day care centers for homeless families&quot; and the &quot;Day 1 Academies Fund&quot; for early childhood education.

In January 2018, Bezos made a $33 million donation to TheDream.US, a college scholarship fund for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as minors. In June 2018, Bezos donated to Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a private philanthropic fund founded by Bill Gates aimed at promoting emissions-free energy. In September 2018, Bezos donated $10 million to With Honor, a nonpartisan organization that works to increase the number of veterans in political office.

In February 2020, Bezos pledged $10 billion to combat climate change through the Bezos Earth Fund. Later that year, in November, Bezos announced $791M of donations to established, well-known groups, with $100M each going to Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council, The Nature Conservancy, World Resources Institute and World Wildlife Fund, and the remainder going to 11 other groups. In April 2020, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Bezos donated $100 million to food banks through Feeding America. In November 2021, Bezos pledged to donate $2 billion towards restructuring food systems and nature conservation at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference.

In July 2021, Bezos announced Courage and Civility Award and donated $100 million each to lawyer Van Jones and chef José Andrés. Next year, he donated $100 million to singer Dolly Parton in recognition of her charity work focused on improving children&#x27;s literacy around the world. In March 2024, he donated $50 million each to actress Eva Longoria and retired admiral Bill McRaven.

Bezos Academy is a group of tuition-free preschools for students from low-income families, which was created by Bezos, and which operate in a manner similar to the Montessori method (but are not accredited as Montessori schools). On November 22, 2022, Bezos awarded $123 million to organizations that are engaged in relocating homeless families to permanent housing. Day 1 Families Fund grants, the amounts of which vary in monetary terms, will be sent to 40 organizations across the country.

<text>A kollel (, , , a &quot;gathering&quot; or &quot;collection&quot; [of scholars]) is an institute for full-time, advanced study of the Talmud and rabbinic literature. Like a yeshiva, a kollel features shiurim (lectures) and learning &quot;sedarim&quot; (sessions); unlike most yeshivot, the student body of a kollel typically consists mostly of married men. A kollel generally pays a regular monthly stipend to its members.

==History==

===Original sense===

Originally, the word was used in the sense of &quot;community&quot;. Each group of European Jews settling in Israel established their own community with their own support system. Each community was referred to as the &quot;kollel of &quot; to identify the specific community of the Old Yishuv. The overwhelming majority of these Jews were scholars who left their homelands to devote themselves to study Torah and serve God for the rest of their lives. The kollel was the umbrella organization for all their needs.

The first examples were Kolel Perushim (students of the Vilna Gaon who established the first Ashkenazi Jewish settlement in Jerusalem) and Colel Chabad for the Russian Hasidim. The Polish Jews were divided into many kollelim: Kolel Polen (Poland), headed by Rabbi Chaim Elozor Wax; Kolel Vilna Zamość was under different leadership; and the Galicians were incorporated under Kolel Chibas Yerushalayim. The last initially included the entire Austro-Hungarian Kingdom, but as each subparty looking for more courteous distribution, the Hungarians separated into Kolel Shomrei HaChomos.

===Modern sense===
The first kollel – in the modern sense of the term – in the Jewish diaspora was the Kovno Kollel (&quot;Kolel Perushim&quot;) founded in Kovno (Kaunas, Lithuania) in 1877. It was founded by Rabbi Yisrael Salanter and directed by Rabbi Isaac Blaser. The ten students enrolled were required to separate from their families, except for the Sabbath, and devote themselves to studying for the Rabbinate. There was a four-year limit on one&#x27;s membership in the kollel.

Two people can be considered to have spearheaded the kollel philosophy and outgrowth in today&#x27;s world: Rabbi Aharon Kotler (founder of Beth Medrash Govoha, Lakewood, New Jersey, the largest yeshiva in the US) and Rabbi Elazar Shach, one of the most prominent leaders of the Jewish community in Israel until his death in 2001. The community kollel movement was also fostered by Torah Umesorah, the National Society for Hebrew Day Schools.

Currently, the term is applied in America to any stipend given for yeshiva study and is now a general term for the yeshivah approach to life.

==Philosophy==
The philosophy of the kollel, in which members are subsisting on support from others, is part of an overall philosophy of some Orthodox Jews, that God desires that the children of Israel primarily occupy themselves in this world with the study of the Torah, and gave certain Jews more of a propensity to work with the intention that they should support the &#x27;learners&#x27;. In Orthodox Judaism this has become known as the &#x27;Yissachar-Zebulun&#x27; partnership, after the Midrashic legend that the tribe of Zevulun financially supported the tribe of Issachar so that they could occupy themselves with Torah study. The reward of the supporter in the World-to-Come is seen to be equal to that of the scholar&#x27;s reward.

==Structure==
===Leadership===
Most kollels have a scholar serving as a &quot;rosh kollel&quot;, or head of the kollel. He decides on the subject matter studied by the kollel. In many cases he also has to spend considerable time fund-raising to support the kollel. 

Many kollels employ former students – (), () – as fundraisers, often giving them titles such as Executive Director or Director of Community Programming. Fundraising projects may include sponsorships of specific events or &quot;day(s) of learning.&quot; 

===Student body===

Many Orthodox Jewish yeshiva students study in kollel for a year or two after they get married, whether or not they will pursue a rabbinic career. Modest stipends, or the salaries of their working wives, and the increased wealth of many families have made kollel study commonplace for yeshiva graduates. The largest United States kollel is at Beth Medrash Govoha in Lakewood, New Jersey. More than 4,500 kollel scholars are attached to the yeshiva, which has 6500 students in total. Large kollels also exist in Ner Israel Rabbinical College, numbering 180 scholars, and in Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin, with more than 100 scholars. In the Israeli Haredi Jewish community, thousands of men study full-time for many years in hundreds of kollelim.

Kollel has been known at times to cause a great deal of friction with the secular Israeli public at large. It has been criticized by the Modern Orthodox, non-Orthodox, and secular Jewish communities. The Haredi community defends the practice of kollel on the grounds that Judaism must cultivate Torah scholarship in the same way that the secular academic world conducts research into subject areas. While costs may be high in the short run, in the long run the Jewish people will benefit from having numerous learned laymen, scholars, and rabbis. (See also: Religious relations in Israel)

Yeshiva students who learn in kollel often continue their studies and 
become rabbis, poskim (&quot;deciders&quot; of Jewish law), or teachers of Talmud and Judaism. Others enter the world of business. If successful, they may financially support the study of others while making time to continue their own learning.

==Community kollelim==
In the late 20th century, community kollelim were introduced. They are an Orthodox outreach tool, aimed to decrease assimilation and propagate Orthodox Judaism among the wider Jewish population. In the early 1990s community kollelim (or kollels) in North America were functioning in Los Angeles, Toronto, and Detroit; a kollel was also established in Montreal. Other locations with community kollelim include Atlanta, Dallas, Jacksonville, Las Vegas, Miami Beach, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Phoenix, St. Louis, and Seattle.

In the past years about 30 Haredi community kollelim in North America have been opened by yeshiva-trained scholars to serve, in addition to the full-time study by the members of the kollel, as centers for adult education and outreach to the Jewish communities in which they located 
themselves. Topics include everything from basic Hebrew to advanced Talmud. In addition to imparting Torah knowledge, such kollels function to impart technical skills required for self-study.

Many Modern Orthodox communities host a &quot;Torah MiTzion&quot; kollel, where &quot;Hesder&quot; graduates learn and teach, generally for one year.

In recent years there have been established a number of Chassidishe Kollelim as well, such as the Chicago Chassidishe Kollel, the Los Angeles Kollel Yechiel Yehudah, and others.
Unlike most community Kollelim that primarily focus on in depth Talmud study, Chassidishe Kollelim usually focus more on the study of Shulchan Aruch and poskim, including tests on the material by leading Poskim.

==Criticism==

Maimonides in his code of Jewish law, is very critical of those that study Torah without having a source of income and rely on charity, to the extent that he calls it a disgrace to God and to the Torah.

However, the kollel system is both a popular and accepted one in many Orthodox Jewish circles, yet some maintain that a distinction must be made between a situation of mutual desire for such by both the learner and the supporter and, on the other hand, communities that put pressure on the learner to join and remain in a kollel while simultaneously putting pressure on the community to support such an individual.

Some other criticisms of the modern kollel system include:
*The difficult financial burden placed on individuals who are less than willing to support institutions for kollel studies.
*The complex halachic permissibility of receiving financial support for Torah study, while avoiding preparation for a future occupation.
*The community-wide poverty that often accompanies the system along with its effect on the larger economy.
*The convention of isolation from daily life, social interactions and a career resulting in studies being divorced from actual day-to-day practice.
*The lack of standardized testing and regular supervision which allows for misuse of time intended for study.
*The focus on thorough examination of a relatively few number of pages of Talmud, as opposed to completion of the entire Talmud with a focus on practical halachah and other areas of Jewish literature.

<text>Chang-lin Tien (; July 24, 1935 – October 29, 2002) was a Taiwanese-American academic, mechanical engineer, and university administrator. He was the seventh chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley (1990–1997), and in that capacity was the first person of Asian descent to head a major research university in the United States.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Born in Huangpi, Hubei, China, Tien and his family fled to Taiwan in 1949 at the end of the Chinese Civil War. He earned a B.S. in mechanical engineering from the National Taiwan University in 1955 and went on to a fellowship at the University of Louisville in 1956, where he received a Master of Science in heat transfer in 1957. He then earned his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in mechanical engineering from Princeton University in 1959.

===Career===
Tien joined UC Berkeley faculty as an assistant professor of mechanical engineering in 1959, and three years later, at the age of 26, became the youngest professor ever to be honored with UC Berkeley&#x27;s Distinguished Teaching Award. He was promoted to full professor in 1968 and served as the chair of the Department of Mechanical Engineering from 1974 to 1981. From 1983 to 1985, he served as vice chancellor of research. Tien spent his entire career at Berkeley, except for 1988–90 when he was executive vice-chancellor of UC Irvine. In 1999, Tien received the prestigious title of &quot;University Professor&quot;.

Tien was an expert in thermal science and researched on thermal radiation, thermal insulation, microscale thermal phenomena, fluid flow, phase-change energy transfer, heat pipes, reactor safety, cryogenics, and fire phenomena, authoring more than 300 research journal and monograph articles, 16 edited volumes, and one book. Up until 2005, his work was posthumously published in the &quot;Annual Review of Heat Transfer&quot;.

As chancellor, Tien was a leading supporter of affirmative action. After the Regents banned the use of racial preferences in 1995 for university admissions, Tien launched the &quot;Berkeley Pledge,&quot; an outreach program designed to recruit disadvantaged students from the state&#x27;s public schools. Amid an 18% budget cut, Tien launched &quot;The Promise of Berkeley – Campaign for the New Century&quot;, a fundraising drive that raised $1.44 billion. In December 1996, President Bill Clinton put him on the shortlist of candidates for United States Secretary of Energy, but Tien was removed after the Chinese campaign finance scandal made headlines; the unsealed Federal Bureau of Investigation file for Tien showed he had been investigated as a potential foreign agent as early as 1973, but no evidence ever was found to support this assumption.

Known for his &quot;Go Bears!&quot; spirit, Tien was very popular with students, often showing up at student rallies and sporting events wearing his &quot;Cal&quot; baseball cap. He was commonly seen picking up trash in Sproul Plaza, appearing in the library in the middle of the night during finals week, or checking up on students in the residence halls and classrooms.

After stepping down from the chancellorship in 1997, Tien was appointed to the National Science Board and the National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st Century in 1999. He was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2000 and suffered a stroke during surgery to treat it, prompting his resignation in 2001.

Tien was a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the Academia Sinica (in Taiwan), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (in mainland China).

===Personal life===
During his residency in the United States, Tien became an American citizen.

Shortly before instruction for the 1992–93 academic year started, a young woman named Rosebud Denovo was killed by police after she broke into University House, the chancellor&#x27;s residence, during an apparent assassination attempt. Tien and his family were unharmed.

Tien died in Redwood City, California at the age of 67. A brain tumor had forced him into hospitalization two years earlier; while hospitalized, he suffered a stroke from which he never fully recovered. He was survived by his wife Di-Hwa; his son Norman Tien, currently Taikoo Professor of Engineering and Chair Professor of Microsystems Technology at The University of Hong Kong (HKU), and Dean of Faculty of Engineering at HKU from June 2012 to May 2018; and daughters Christine Tien, Stockton&#x27;s former deputy city manager; and Dr. Phyllis Tien, a UC San Francisco physician.

<doc id="142534" wikidata="Q651050" url="?curid=142534" title="Electron hole">
<text>In physics, chemistry, and electronic engineering, an electron hole (often simply called a hole) is a quasiparticle denoting the lack of an electron at a position where one could exist in an atom or atomic lattice. Since in a normal atom or crystal lattice the negative charge of the electrons is balanced by the positive charge of the atomic nuclei, the absence of an electron leaves a net positive charge at the hole&#x27;s location.

Holes in a metal or semiconductor crystal lattice can move through the lattice as electrons can, and act similarly to positively-charged particles. They play an important role in the operation of semiconductor devices such as transistors, diodes (including light-emitting diodes) and integrated circuits. If an electron is excited into a higher state it leaves a hole in its old state. This meaning is used in Auger electron spectroscopy (and other x-ray techniques), in computational chemistry, and to explain the low electron-electron scattering-rate in crystals (metals and semiconductors). Although they act like elementary particles, holes are rather quasiparticles; they are different from the positron, which is the antiparticle of the electron. (See also Dirac sea.)

In crystals, electronic band structure calculations lead to an effective mass for the electrons that is typically negative at the top of a band. The negative mass is an unintuitive concept, and in these situations, a more familiar picture is found by considering a positive charge with a positive mass.

== Solid-state physics ==

In solid-state physics, an electron hole (usually referred to simply as a hole) is the absence of an electron from a full valence band. A hole is essentially a way to conceptualize the interactions of the electrons within a nearly &quot;full&quot; valence band of a crystal lattice, which is &quot;missing&quot; a small fraction of its electrons. In some ways, the behavior of a hole within a semiconductor crystal lattice is comparable to that of the bubble in a full bottle of water.

The hole concept was pioneered in 1929 by Rudolf Peierls, who analyzed the Hall effect using Bloch&#x27;s theorem, and demonstrated that a nearly full and a nearly empty Brillouin zones give the opposite Hall voltages. The concept of an electron hole in solid-state physics predates the concept of a hole in Dirac equation, but there is no evidence that it would have influenced Dirac&#x27;s thinking.

=== Simplified analogy: Empty seat in an auditorium ===
Hole conduction in a valence band can be explained by the following analogy:

Imagine a row of people seated in an auditorium, where there are no spare chairs. Someone in the middle of the row wants to leave, so he jumps over the back of the seat into another row, and walks out. The empty row is analogous to the conduction band, and the person walking out is analogous to a conduction electron.

Now imagine someone else comes along and wants to sit down. The empty row has a poor view; so he does not want to sit there. Instead, a person in the crowded row moves into the empty seat the first person left behind. The empty seat moves one spot closer to the edge and the person waiting to sit down. The next person follows, and the next, et cetera. One could say that the empty seat moves towards the edge of the row. Once the empty seat reaches the edge, the new person can sit down.

In the process everyone in the row has moved along. If those people were negatively charged (like electrons), this movement would constitute conduction. If the seats themselves were positively charged, then only the vacant seat would be positive. This is a very simple model of how hole conduction works.

Instead of analyzing the movement of an empty state in the valence band as the movement of many separate electrons, a single equivalent imaginary particle called a &quot;hole&quot; is considered. In an applied electric field, the electrons move in one direction, corresponding to the hole moving in the other. If a hole associates itself with a neutral atom, that atom loses an electron and becomes positive. Therefore, the hole is taken to have positive charge of +e, precisely the opposite of the electron charge.

In reality, due to the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics, combined with the energy levels available in the crystal, the hole is not localizable to a single position as described in the previous example. Rather, the positive charge which represents the hole spans an area in the crystal lattice covering many hundreds of unit cells. This is equivalent to being unable to tell which broken bond corresponds to the &quot;missing&quot; electron. Conduction band electrons are similarly delocalized.

=== Detailed picture: A hole is the absence of a negative-mass electron ===

The analogy above is quite simplified, and cannot explain why holes create an opposite effect to electrons in the Hall effect and Seebeck effect. A more precise and detailed explanation follows.

A dispersion relation is the relationship between wavevector (k-vector) and energy in a band, part of the electronic band structure. In quantum mechanics, the electrons are waves, and energy is the wave frequency. A localized electron is a wavepacket, and the motion of an electron is given by the formula for the group velocity of a wave. An electric field affects an electron by gradually shifting all the wavevectors in the wavepacket, and the electron accelerates when its wave group velocity changes. Therefore, again, the way an electron responds to forces is entirely determined by its dispersion relation. An electron floating in space has the dispersion relation , where &quot;m&quot; is the (real) electron mass and ℏ is reduced Planck constant. Near the bottom of the conduction band of a semiconductor, the dispersion relation is instead ( is the &quot;effective mass&quot;), so a conduction-band electron responds to forces &quot;as if&quot; it had the mass .

The dispersion relation near the top of the valence band is with &quot;negative&quot; effective mass. So electrons near the top of the valence band behave like they have negative mass. When a force pulls the electrons to the right, these electrons actually move left. This is solely due to the shape of the valence band and is unrelated to whether the band is full or empty. If you could somehow empty out the valence band and just put one electron near the valence band maximum (an unstable situation), this electron would move the &quot;wrong way&quot; in response to forces.

A perfectly full band always has zero current. One way to think about this fact is that the electron states near the top of the band have negative effective mass, and those near the bottom of the band have positive effective mass, so the net motion is exactly zero. If an otherwise-almost-full valence band has a state &quot;without&quot; an electron in it, we say that this state is occupied by a hole. There is a mathematical shortcut for calculating the current due to every electron in the whole valence band: Start with zero current (the total if the band were full), and &quot;subtract&quot; the current due to the electrons that &quot;would&quot; be in each hole state if it wasn&#x27;t a hole. Since &quot;subtracting&quot; the current caused by a &quot;negative&quot; charge in motion is the same as &quot;adding&quot; the current caused by a &quot;positive&quot; charge moving on the same path, the mathematical shortcut is to pretend that each hole state is carrying a positive charge, while ignoring every other electron state in the valence band.

This fact follows from the discussion and definition above. This is an example where the auditorium analogy above is misleading. When a person moves left in a full auditorium, an empty seat moves right. But in this section we are imagining how electrons move through k-space, not real space, and the effect of a force is to move all the electrons through k-space in the same direction at the same time. In this context, a better analogy is a bubble underwater in a river: The bubble moves the same direction as the water, not the opposite.

Since force = mass × acceleration, a negative-effective-mass electron near the top of the valence band would move the opposite direction as a positive-effective-mass electron near the bottom of the conduction band, in response to a given electric or magnetic force. Therefore, a hole moves this way as well.

From the above, a hole (1) carries a positive charge, and (2) responds to electric and magnetic fields as if it had a positive charge and positive mass. (The latter is because a particle with positive charge and positive mass respond to electric and magnetic fields in the same way as a particle with a negative charge and negative mass.) That explains why holes can be treated in all situations as ordinary positively charged quasiparticles.

=== Role in semiconductor technology ===

In some semiconductors, such as silicon, the hole&#x27;s effective mass is dependent on a direction (anisotropic), however a value averaged over all directions can be used for some macroscopic calculations.

In most semiconductors, the effective mass of a hole is much larger than that of an electron. This results in lower mobility for holes under the influence of an electric field and this may slow down the speed of the electronic device made of that semiconductor. This is one major reason for adopting electrons as the primary charge carriers, whenever possible in semiconductor devices, rather than holes. This is also why NMOS logic is faster than PMOS logic.
OLED screens have been modified to reduce imbalance resulting in non radiative recombination by adding extra layers and/or decreasing electron density on one plastic layer so electrons and holes precisely balance within the emission zone. 
However, in many semiconductor devices, both electrons &quot;and&quot; holes play an essential role. Examples include p–n diodes, bipolar transistors, and CMOS logic.

== Holes in quantum chemistry ==
An alternate meaning for the term electron hole is used in computational chemistry. In coupled cluster methods, the ground (or lowest energy) state of a molecule is interpreted as the &quot;vacuum state&quot;—conceptually, in this state, there are no electrons. In this scheme, the absence of an electron from a normally filled state is called a &quot;hole&quot; and is treated as a particle, and the presence of an electron in a normally empty state is simply called an &quot;electron&quot;. This terminology is almost identical to that used in solid-state physics.

<text>Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) is a generic file container format for storing data in tagged chunks. It is primarily used for audio and video, though it can be used for arbitrary data.

The Microsoft implementation is mostly known through container formats like AVI, ANI and WAV, which use RIFF as their basis.

== History ==
RIFF was introduced in 1991 by Microsoft and IBM and used as the default format for Windows 3.1 multimedia files. It is based on Interchange File Format introduced by Electronic Arts in 1985 on the Amiga. IFF uses the big-endian convention of the Amiga&#x27;s Motorola 68000 CPU, but in RIFF multi-byte integers are stored in the little-endian order of the x86 processors used in IBM PC compatibles. A RIFX format, which is big-endian, was also introduced.

In 2010 Google introduced the WebP picture format, which uses RIFF as a container.

== Explanation ==
RIFF files consist entirely of &quot;chunks&quot;. The overall format is identical to IFF, except for the endianness as previously stated, and the different meaning of the chunk names.

All chunks have the following format:
* 4 bytes: an ASCII identifier for this chunk (examples are &quot;fmt &quot; and &quot;data&quot;; note the space in &quot;fmt &quot;).
* 4 bytes: an unsigned, little-endian 32-bit integer with the length of this chunk (except this field itself and the chunk identifier).
* variable-sized field: the chunk data itself, of the size given in the previous field.
* a pad byte, if the chunk&#x27;s length is not even.

Two chunk identifiers, &quot;RIFF&quot; and &quot;LIST&quot;, introduce a chunk that can contain subchunks. The RIFF and LIST chunk data (appearing after the identifier and length) have the following format:
* 4 bytes: an ASCII identifier for this particular RIFF or LIST chunk (for RIFF in the typical case, these 4 bytes describe the content of the entire file, such as &quot;AVI &quot; or &quot;WAVE&quot;).
* rest of data: subchunks.

The file itself consists of one RIFF chunk, which then can contain further subchunks: hence, the first four bytes of a correctly formatted RIFF file will spell out &quot;RIFF&quot;.

More information about the RIFF format can be found in the Interchange File Format article.

RF64 is a multichannel file format based on RIFF specification, developed by the European Broadcasting Union. It is BWF-compatible and allows file sizes to exceed 4 gigabytes. It does so by providing a &quot;ds64&quot; chunk with a 64-bit (8-byte) size.

== Use of the INFO chunk ==
The optional INFO chunk allows RIFF files to be &quot;tagged&quot; with information falling into a number of predefined categories, such as copyright (&quot;ICOP&quot;), comments (&quot;ICMT&quot;), artist (&quot;IART&quot;), in a standardised way. These details can be read from a RIFF file even if the rest of the file format is unrecognized. The standard also allows the use of user-defined fields. Programmers intending to use non-standard fields should bear in mind that the same non-standard subchunk ID may be used by different applications in different (and potentially incompatible) ways.

== Compatibility issues ==
=== Initial difficulties with MIDI files ===
In line with their policy of using .RIFF for all Windows 3.1 &quot;multimedia&quot; files, Microsoft introduced a new variant on the existing MIDI file format used for storing song information to be played on electronic musical instruments. Microsoft&#x27;s MIDI file format consisted of a standard MIDI file enclosed in a RIFF wrapper, and had the file extension .RMI. Since the existing MIDI file format already supported embedded &quot;tagging&quot; information, this caused the disadvantage of having to deal with two file formats for the same type of information.

The MIDI Manufacturers Association have since embraced the RIFF-based MIDI file format, and used it as the basis of an &quot;extended midifile&quot; that also includes instrument data in &quot;DLS&quot; format, embedded within the same .RMI file.

=== INFO chunk placement problems ===
For cataloguing purposes, the optimal position for the INFO chunk is near the beginning of the file. However, since the INFO chunk is optional, it is often omitted from the detailed specifications of individual file formats, leading to some confusion over the correct position for this chunk within a file.

When dealing with large media files, the expansion or contraction of the INFO chunk during tag-editing can result in the following &quot;data&quot; section of the file having to be read and rewritten back to disk to accommodate the new header size. Since media files can be gigabytes in size, this is a potentially disk-intensive process. One workaround is to &quot;pad out&quot; the leading INFO chunk using dummy data (using a &quot;dummy chunk&quot; or &quot;pad chunk&quot;) when the file is created. Later editing can then expand or contract the &quot;dummy&quot; field to keep the total size of the file header constant: an intelligently written piece of software can then overwrite just the file header when tagging data is changed, without modifying or moving the main body of the file.

Some programs have tried to address the problem by placing the INFO chunk at the end of a media file, after the main body of the file. This has resulted in two different conventions for chunk placement, with the attendant risk that some combinations of software can cause a file&#x27;s INFO data to be ignored or permanently overwritten during editing. More sophisticated programs will take into account the possibility of &quot;unexpected&quot; chunk placement in files and respond accordingly. For instance, when the audio-editing program Audacity encounters a .WAV file with end-placed INFO data, it will correctly identify and read the data, but on saving, will relocate the INFO chunk back to the file header.

Although CorelDRAW 10 nominally uses a RIFF file structure, the program&#x27;s initial release placed the INFO chunk at the end, so that any embedded preview bitmap would not be displayed under Windows&#x27; file manager by default. A &quot;patch&quot; utility supplied with the program fixes this problem.

== RIFF info tags ==

RIFF information tags are found in WAV audio and AVI video files.

=== Converting DTIM time to normal time ===
The field consists of two values (v[0] and v[1]) separated with a space (0x20). Sample code:

// time in seconds - &quot;concatenate&quot; date &amp; time elements with a decimal point delimiter
TimeInSeconds = (v[0] * (2^32) + v[1]) * 10^(-7);

// shift basis from Jan 1, 1601 to Unix epoch Jan 1, 1970 (369 years &amp; leap days)
UnixTimeStamp = TimeInSeconds - 134774 * 24 * 3600;
== Some common RIFF file types ==
* WAV (Windows audio)
* AVI (Windows audiovisual)
* RMI (Windows &quot;RIFF MIDIfile&quot;)
* CDR (CorelDRAW vector graphics file)
* ANI (Animated Windows cursors)
* PAL (Palette)
* DLS (Downloadable Sounds)
* WebP (An image format developed by Google)
* XMA (Microsoft Xbox 360 console audio format based on WMA Pro)

* AIFF
* BWF Broadcast Wave Format

<doc id="142537" wikidata="Q624790" url="?curid=142537" title="Hole (band)">
<text>Hole was an American alternative rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1989. It was founded by singer and guitarist Courtney Love and guitarist Eric Erlandson. It had several different bassists and drummers, the most prolific being drummer Patty Schemel, and bassists Kristen Pfaff (d. 1994) and Melissa Auf der Maur. Hole released a total of four studio albums between two incarnations spanning the 1990s and early-2010s and became one of the most commercially successful rock bands in history fronted by a woman.

Influenced by Los Angeles&#x27; punk rock scene, the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot; (1991), was produced by Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, and attracted critical interest from British and American alternative press. Their second album, &quot;Live Through This&quot;, released in 1994 by DGC Records, combined elements of punk, grunge, and pop rock music, and was widely acclaimed, reaching platinum status within a year of its release. Their third album, &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; (1998), marked a notable departure from their earlier punk influences, boasting a more commercially viable sound; the album sold around 2 million copies worldwide, and earned them significant critical acclaim.

They disbanded in 2002, and the members individually pursued other projects. Eight years later in 2010, Hole was reformed by Love with new members, despite Erlandson&#x27;s claim that the reformation breached a mutual contract he had with her. The reformed band released the album &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2010), which was conceived as Love&#x27;s second solo album. In 2013, Love retired the Hole name, releasing new material and touring as a solo artist.

Hole received several accolades, including four Grammy Award nominations. They were also commercially successful, selling over three million records in the United States alone, and had a far-reaching influence on contemporary female artists. Music and feminist scholars have also recognized the band as the most high-profile musical group of the 1990s to discuss gender issues in their songs, due to Love&#x27;s aggressive and violent lyrical content, which often addressed themes of body image, abuse, and sexual exploitation.

==Background==
Hole formed after Eric Erlandson responded to an advertisement placed by Courtney Love in &quot;The Recycler&quot; in the summer of 1989. The advertisement read: &quot;I want to start a band. My influences are Big Black, Sonic Youth, and Fleetwood Mac.&quot; Erlandson recalled of their first meeting: &quot;We met at this coffee shop, and I saw her and I thought &#x27;Oh, God. Oh, no, What am I getting myself into?&#x27; She grabbed me and started talking, and she&#x27;s like &#x27;I know you&#x27;re the right one&#x27;, and I hadn&#x27;t even opened my mouth yet.&quot; In retrospect, Love said that Erlandson &quot;had a Thurston [Moore] quality about him&quot; and was an &quot;intensely weird, good guitarist&quot;. In his 2012 book, &quot;Letters to Kurt&quot;, Erlandson revealed that he and Love had a sexual relationship during their first year together in the band, which Love also confirmed.

Love had been living a nomadic life prior, immersing herself in numerous music scenes and living in various cities along the West Coast. After unsuccessful attempts at forming bands in San Francisco (where she was briefly a member of Faith No More) and Portland, Love relocated to Los Angeles, where she found work as an actress in two Alex Cox films (&quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; and &quot;Straight to Hell&quot;). Erlandson, a Los Angeles native and a graduate of Loyola Marymount University, was working as an accountant for Capitol Records at the time he met Love.

Love originally wanted to name the band Sweet Baby Crystal Powered by God, but opted for the name Hole instead. During an interview on &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;, she claimed the name for the band was partly inspired by a quote from Euripides&#x27; &quot;Medea&quot; that read: &quot;There is a hole that pierces right through me.&quot; She also cited a conversation with her mother as the primary inspiration for the band&#x27;s name, in which her mother told her that she couldn&#x27;t live her life &quot;with a hole running through her&quot;. Love also acknowledged the &quot;obvious&quot; genital reference in the band&#x27;s name, alluding to the vagina.

==History==
===1989–1991: Early work and indie success===

In the months preceding the band&#x27;s full formation, Love and Erlandson would write and record in the evenings at a rehearsal space in Hollywood, loaned to them by the Red Hot Chili Peppers; during the day, Love worked as a stripper to support the band and purchase amplifiers and their backline for live shows. Hole&#x27;s first official rehearsal took place at Fortress Studios in Hollywood with Love, Erlandson and Lisa Roberts on bass. According to Erlandson, &quot;these two girls show up dressed completely crazy, we set up and they said, &quot;okay, just start playing something.&quot; I started playing and they started screaming at the top of their lungs for two or three hours. Crazy lyrics and screaming. I said to myself, &quot;most people would just run away from this really fast. But I heard something in Courtney&#x27;s voice and lyrics.&quot; Initially, the band had no percussion until Love met drummer Caroline Rue at a Gwar and L7 concert in Long Beach. The band subsequently recruited a third guitarist, Mike Geisbrecht. Hole&#x27;s first show took place at Raji&#x27;s, a small bar in Hollywood, in October 1989. By early 1990, Geisbrecht and Roberts had both left the band, which led to the recruitment of bassist Jill Emery. According to Caroline Rue, Love fired Roberts after she threatened a Long Beach club owner—the wife of mobster Eddie Nash—with a screwdriver when the club refused to pay them for their performance.

Hole released their no wave-influenced debut single &quot;Retard Girl&quot; in April 1990, and followed it with &quot;Dicknail&quot; in 1991, released on Sympathy for the Record Industry and Sub Pop, respectively. According to disc jockey Rodney Bingenheimer, Love would often approach him at a Denny&#x27;s on Sunset Blvd. where he went for coffee in the mornings, and convinced him to give &quot;Retard Girl&quot; airtime on his station KROQ-FM.

In 1991, the band signed onto Caroline Records to release their debut album, and Love sought Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth to produce the record. She sent a letter, a Hello Kitty barrette, and copies of the band&#x27;s early singles to her, mentioning that the band greatly admired Gordon&#x27;s work and appreciated &quot;the production of the SST record&quot; (either referring to Sonic Youth&#x27;s album &quot;Sister&quot; or &quot;EVOL&quot;). Gordon, impressed by the band&#x27;s singles, agreed to produce the album, with assistance from Gumball&#x27;s Don Fleming. The album, titled &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot;, was released in September 1991 to positive reception from underground critics, branded &quot;loud, ugly and deliberately shocking&quot;, and earned a spot on &quot;Spin&quot;″s &quot;20 Best Albums of the Year&quot; list. It was also voted album of the year by New York&#x27;s &quot;Village Voice&quot; and peaked at number 59 on the UK albums chart. The album spawned one single, &quot;Teenage Whore&quot;, which entered the UK Indie Chart at number one, as well as the band&#x27;s debut music video for the song &quot;Garbadge Man&quot;.

Musically and lyrically, &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot; was abrasive and drew on elements of punk rock and sludge metal, characterized by overt noise and feedback, chaotic guitar riffs, contrasting tempos, graphic lyrics, and a variation of Love&#x27;s vocals ranging from whispers to guttural screaming. In later years, Love referred to the album as &quot;unlistenable&quot;, despite its critical accolades and eventual cult following. The band embarked on a European tour in the fall of 1991 supporting Mudhoney. They also toured intermittently in the United States between July and December 1991, playing primarily at hard rock and punk clubs, including CBGB and the Whisky a Go Go, where they opened for the Smashing Pumpkins. In a write-up by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on the band&#x27;s final show of the tour, it was noted that Love smashed the headstock of her Rickenbacker guitar onstage.

In mid-1991, the band began to get the attention of the major labels. The first to court them was Maverick — a Warner subsidiary founded by Madonna and music executive Freddy DeMann. Love, however, was uninterested: &quot;[They] would have me riding on elephants. They don&#x27;t know what I am. For them, I&#x27;m a visual, period.&quot; She was also uneasy about sharing the spotlight on a label so heavily associated with one of the industry&#x27;s most iconic female performers. In a 1992 interview with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Love described Madonna&#x27;s interest as &quot;kind of like Dracula&#x27;s interest in his latest victim&quot;.

===1992–1999: Mainstream success===
====1992–1995: &quot;Live Through This&quot;====

Love and Erlandson began writing new material for a second Hole album in 1992, in the midst of Love&#x27;s pregnancy with Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. Love&#x27;s desire to take the band in a more melodic and controlled rock format led bassist Emery to leave the band, and drummer Caroline Rue followed. In an advertisement to find a new bass player, Love wrote: &quot;[I want] someone who can play ok, and stand in front of 30,000 people, take off her shirt and have &#x27;fuck you&#x27; written on her tits. If you&#x27;re not afraid of me and you&#x27;re not afraid to fucking say it, send a letter. No more pussies, no more fake girls, I want a whore from hell.&quot; In April 1992, drummer Patty Schemel was recruited after an audition in Los Angeles, but the band spent the remainder of the year without a bassist; Love, Schemel, and Erlandson began to write material together in the interim.

Hole signed to Geffen&#x27;s subsidiary DGC label with an eight-album contract in late 1992. In the spring of 1993, the band released their single &quot;Beautiful Son&quot;, which was recorded in Seattle with producer Jack Endino as a fill-in bass player; Love also played bass on the single&#x27;s b-side &quot;20 Years In the Dakota&quot;, as well as on their contribution to the 1993 Germs tribute album &quot;A Small Circle of Friends&quot;. In the spring of 1993, Love and Erlandson recruited Janitor Joe bassist Kristen Pfaff, and the band toured the United Kingdom in the summer of that year (including the Phoenix Festival on July 16), mainly performing material from their upcoming major label debut, &quot;Live Through This&quot;, which they recorded at Triclops Studios in Marietta, Georgia in October 1993.

&quot;Live Through This&quot; was released on April 12, 1994, one week after Love&#x27;s husband, Kurt Cobain, was found dead in his Seattle home. In the wake of Love&#x27;s family tragedy, &quot;Live Through This&quot; was a critical success. It spawned several popular singles, including &quot;Doll Parts&quot;, &quot;Violet&quot;, and &quot;Miss World&quot;, going multi-platinum and being hailed &quot;Album of the Year&quot; by &quot;Spin&quot; magazine. &quot;NME&quot; called the album &quot;a personal but secretive thrash-pop opera of urban nihilism and passionate dumb thinks&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said the album &quot;may be the most potent blast of female insurgency ever committed to tape&quot;.

Despite the critical praise for &quot;Live Through This&quot;, rumors circulated insinuating that Cobain had actually written the majority of the album, though the band vehemently denies this. The band&#x27;s drummer Patty Schemel, who had been friends with Cobain since the late 1980s, said: &quot;There&#x27;s that myth that Kurt [Cobain] wrote all our songs— it&#x27;s not true. Courtney and Eric wrote &quot;Live Through This&quot;.&quot; The band did, however, state that Love convinced Cobain to provide backing vocals on &quot;Asking for It&quot; and &quot;Softer, Softest&quot; while visiting the studio, and music producers and engineers present during the recording sessions noted that Cobain seemed &quot;completely unfamiliar&quot; with the songs. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; rock journalist Gavin Edwards, Love and Cobain had written songs together in the past, but opted to not release them because it was &quot;a bit too redolent of John and Yoko&quot;.

In 1994, bassist Kristen Pfaff went into a drug treatment facility to treat her heroin addiction. Pfaff contemplated leaving the band for health reasons. In June 1994, she was found dead of a heroin overdose in the bathroom of her Seattle home, 2 months after the death of Cobain. The band put their impending tour on hold, pulling out of the upcoming Lollapalooza festival.

Recruiting bassist Melissa Auf der Maur over the summer, they commenced their world tour on August 26 at the Reading Festival in England, giving a performance that John Peel described as &quot;teetering on the edge of chaos&quot;. The band embarked on a worldwide tour throughout late 1994 and for the duration of 1995, with appearances at the KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, the Big Day Out festival, &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, the 1995 Reading Festival, Lollapalooza 1995, and at the &quot;MTV Video Music Awards&quot;, where they were nominated for the &quot;Doll Parts&quot; music video.

Love&#x27;s reckless stage presence during the tour became a media spectacle, drawing press from MTV and other outlets due to her unpredictable performances. While touring with Sonic Youth, Love got into a physical fight with Kathleen Hanna backstage at a 1995 Lollapalooza festival and punched her in the face. In an August 1995 band interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, drummer Patty Schemel formally came out as a lesbian, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s important. I&#x27;m not out there with that fucking pink flag or anything, but it&#x27;s good for other people who live somewhere else in some small town who feel freaky about being gay to know that there&#x27;s other people who are and that it&#x27;s okay.&quot; In a retrospective interview, Schemel said:

Toward the end of the tour, the band released their first EP, titled &quot;Ask for It&quot;, in September 1995; it featured 1991 Peel session recordings, as well as covers of songs by Wipers and The Velvet Underground. The band performed its last show of the year on September 3, 1995, at the Molson Polar Beach Party in Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories, Canada. The concert was a promotional event for the Molson Brewery, and also featured performances by Metallica, Veruca Salt, and Moist.

====1996–1999: &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;====
In 1996, the band recorded and released a cover of Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; for &quot;The Crow: City of Angels&quot; (1996) soundtrack, the band&#x27;s first studio song to feature Melissa Auf der Maur on bass, and produced by Ric Ocasek. Hole released two retrospective albums during this time: firstly, their second EP, titled &quot;The First Session&quot; (1997), which consisted of a complete version of the band&#x27;s first recording session at Rudy&#x27;s Rising Star in Los Angeles in March 1990, some of which had been bootlegged widely years prior. It featured the group&#x27;s first ever recorded track, &quot;Turpentine&quot;, which had previously been unreleased to the public. The same year, the band released their first compilation album, &quot;My Body, The Hand Grenade&quot; (1997), featuring early singles, b-sides and recent live tracks.

In 1997, the band entered Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles after attempts to write new material in Miami, New Orleans, London, and New York. Recorded over a ten-month period, Hole&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; (1998), adopted a complete new sound for the band, incorporating elements of power pop, and had Love drawing influences from Fleetwood Mac and My Bloody Valentine. According to Erlandson, Love was more focused on song-writing and singing than playing guitar on the record; Love stated that her aim for the album was to &quot;deconstruct the California sound&quot; in the L.A. tradition of bands like The Doors, The Beach Boys and The Byrds. In addition to Hole, Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan entered the studio and helped perfect five of the album&#x27;s twelve songs. Love, who felt she was in a creative slump, likened Corgan&#x27;s presence in the studio to &quot;a math teacher who wouldn&#x27;t give you the answers but was making you solve the problems yourself&quot;.

Upon the album&#x27;s release, Corgan told CNN that he should have &quot;been given credit [for writing the entire album]&quot;. Erlandson responded to Corgan&#x27;s statements in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, commenting: &quot;We were working on all the stuff that Courtney and I had already written. Billy really facilitated things, in a way ... I would bring in the music, Courtney would start coming up with lyrics right away, and [Billy] would help map it all out.&quot; Erlandson also stated: &quot;Courtney writes all her own lyrics. Nobody else is writing those lyrics and nobody ever has.&quot; One journalist took note of the controversy when reviewing the album, stating: &quot;Back in 1994, the acclaim for &quot;Live Through This&quot; was undercut by whispers that Love&#x27;s late husband wrote the album. Combine those conspiracy theories with the unfounded but persistent rumor that Cobain was actually murdered, and it is no surprise that, in the song &#x27;Celebrity Skin&#x27;, Love calls herself a walking study in demonology.&quot;

Although Schemel is listed as drummer in the liner notes of the record, her drumming does not actually appear on the record; she was replaced by session drummer Deen Castronovo, under pressure from producer Michael Beinhorn. After the replacement, Schemel quit the band. Though Love and Erlandson had authorized Schemel&#x27;s replacement, both expressed regret in retrospect, and Love stated in 2011 that Beinhorn was notorious for replacing drummers on records, and referred to him as &quot;a Nazi&quot;. After Schemel&#x27;s departure, the band hired drummer Samantha Maloney for their upcoming tours and music videos.

&quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; was a critical success with strong sales and successful singles, including the title track, &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;, &quot;Malibu&quot;, and &quot;Awful&quot;. The album received largely positive reviews, with praise from music periodicals such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, and &quot;Blender&quot;, as well as a four-star review from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, calling it a &quot;wild emotional ride&quot; sure to be &quot;one of the most dissected and debated collections of the year&quot;. The album peaked at number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and garnered the band its first and only number 1 single, &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;, which topped the Modern Rock Tracks. &quot;Malibu&quot;, released December 29, 1998, was the album&#x27;s second single; it charted at number 3 on the Modern Rock Tracks.

===1999–2002: Final tour and disbandment===
In the winter of 1998–99, Hole went on tour to promote &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;, joining Marilyn Manson, who was promoting his album, &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; (1998) on the Beautiful Monsters Tour. The tour turned into a publicity magnet, and Hole dropped out of the tour nine dates in, due to both the majority of the fans being Manson&#x27;s, and the 50/50 financial arrangement between the groups, with Hole&#x27;s production costs being disproportionately less than Manson&#x27;s. Manson and Love often mocked one another onstage, and Love attacked Manson&#x27;s stage antics, which included tearing up a Bible during performances: &quot;You know, whenever somebody rips up the Bible in front of 40,000 people, I think it&#x27;s a big deal&quot;, she said during a 1999 interview. Hole officially announced that they would be dropping out of the tour after a poorly received concert at the Rose Garden Arena in Portland, Oregon, which ended with Manson fans booing the band.

The band continued to book shows and headline festivals after dropping off Manson&#x27;s tour, and according to Auf der Maur, it was a &quot;daily event&quot; for Love to invite audience members onstage to sing with her for the last song at nearly every concert performance. On June 17, 1999, during Hole&#x27;s set at the Hultsfred Festival in Sweden, a 19-year-old girl died after being crushed by the mosh pit behind the mixing board. Hole played its final show at Thunderbird Stadium in Vancouver on July 14, 1999.

In October 1999, Auf der Maur quit Hole and went on to become a touring bassist for The Smashing Pumpkins. Samantha Maloney also quit a few months later. The band&#x27;s final release was a single for the movie &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; (1999). &quot;Be a Man&quot;, released in March 2000, was an outtake from the &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; sessions. In April 2002, Love called The Howard Stern Show and said she had written nine songs with songwriter Linda Perry, but less than a month later Love and Erlandson officially disbanded Hole via a message posted on the band&#x27;s website. After the split, the four musicians each took on projects of their own: Erlandson continued to work as a producer and session musician, eventually forming the experimental group RRIICCEE with controversial artist Vincent Gallo. Love began a solo career, releasing her debut, &quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot;, in 2004, featuring several of the songs written with Perry. Melissa Auf der Maur also embarked on a solo career, and released her self-titled debut album in 2004, which included Erlandson performing lead guitar on the track, &quot;Would If I Could&quot;. Her second album, &quot;Out of Our Minds&quot;, was released in March 2010. Hole&#x27;s body of work from its inception to its first disbandment includes thirteen singles, three LPs, three EPs, and one compilation album.

===2009–2013: Reformation===
On June 17, 2009, seven years after Hole&#x27;s disbandment, &quot;NME&quot; reported that Love was re-forming the band with guitarist Micko Larkin for an upcoming album, on which Melissa Auf der Maur would be providing backup vocals. Days later, Melissa Auf der Maur stated in an interview that she was unaware of any reunion, but said Love had asked her to contribute harmonies to an upcoming album. In response, Eric Erlandson stated in an interview with &quot;Spin&quot; magazine that a reunion could not take place without his involvement, citing that he and Love &quot;have a contract&quot;.

Hole launched a new website and various social media pages on January 1, 2010, and performed on &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; in February. On February 17, 2010, they played a full set at the O2 Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire, with support from Little Fish. On March 16, the first Hole single in ten years was released, titled &quot;Skinny Little Bitch&quot;; it peaked at No. 29 on the Billboard Rock Chart, and at No. 21 on the Alternative Singles chart. The track also received airplay on Active rock and alternative radio.

&quot;Nobody&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was released on April 26, 2010, worldwide on Mercury Records, and was received moderately well by music critics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album three out of five stars, but noted &quot;[while Love] was an absolute monster vocalist in the nineties, the greatest era ever for rock singers ... She doesn&#x27;t have that power in her lungs anymore – barely a trace. But at least she remembers, and that means something in itself.&quot; The magazine also referred to the album as &quot;not a true success&quot;, but a &quot;noble effort&quot;. Love&#x27;s voice, which had become noticeably raspier, was compared to the likes of Bob Dylan. &quot;NME&quot; gave the album a 6/10 rating, and Robert Christgau rated it an &quot;A−&quot;, saying, &quot;Thing is, I can use some new punk rage in my life, and unless you&#x27;re a fan of Goldman Sachs and BP Petroleum, so can you. What&#x27;s more, better it come from a 45-year-old woman who knows how to throw her weight around than from the zitty newbies and tattooed road dogs who churn most of it out these days. I know—for her, BP Petroleum is just something else to pretend about. But the emotion fueling her pretense is cathartic nevertheless.&quot; In support of the release, Hole toured extensively between 2010 and 2012 throughout North America and Europe, as well as performing in Russia and Brazil.

On March 28, 2011, Love, Erlandson, Patty Schemel and Auf der Maur appeared at the New York screening of Schemel&#x27;s documentary &quot;Hit So Hard: The Life and Near-Death Story of Patty Schemel&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art. The appearance was the first time in thirteen years that all four members appeared together in public. Schemel had expressed a desire to record with Love, Erlandson and Auf der Maur stating &quot;nothing has been discussed, but I have a feeling.&quot; After the screening, the four took part in a Q&amp;A session where Love stated: &quot;For me, as much as I love playing with Patty – and I would play with her in five seconds again, and everyone onstage – if it&#x27;s not moving forward, I don&#x27;t wanna do it. That&#x27;s just my thing. There&#x27;s rumblings; there&#x27;s always bloody rumblings. But if it&#x27;s not miserable and it&#x27;s going forward and I&#x27;m happy with it ... that&#x27;s all I have to say about that question.&quot;

In May 2011, a music video for &quot;Samantha&quot; was shot in Istanbul, although it remained officially unreleased. In September 2011, Scott Lipps joined the band, replacing drummer Stu Fisher. In April 2012, Love, Erlandson, Auf der Maur and Schemel reunited at the Public Assembly in New York for a two-song set, including &quot;Miss World&quot; and the Wipers&#x27; &quot;Over the Edge&quot;, at an after-party for the &quot;Hit So Hard&quot; documentary. The performance marked the first time the four members performed together since 1998 after Schemel&#x27;s departure and the 2002 breakup of the band.

On December 29, 2012, Love performed a solo acoustic set in New York City, and in January 2013, performed at the Sundance Film Festival under her own name. She booked further performances across North America as a solo act, with Larkin, bassist Shawn Dailey, and Lipps as her backing band.

===2014–2016: Second disbandment===

On December 28, 2013, Love posted two photos of herself with Erlandson on Facebook and Twitter, with a caption reading: &quot;And this just happened ... 2014 going to be a very interesting year.&quot; Love also tagged Melissa Auf der Maur as well as Hole&#x27;s former manager, Peter Mensch, in the post, alluding to a reconciliation with Erlandson and possible reunion in 2014.

On April 2, 2014, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reported that the &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; line-up of the band had reunited (with Patty Schemel in lieu of Samantha Maloney). &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; erroneously reported Love&#x27;s upcoming solo single, &quot;Wedding Day&quot; to be a product of this reunion. Shortly after, Love curtailed her statement, saying: &quot;We may have made out but there is no talk of marriage. It&#x27;s very frail, nothing might happen, and now the band are all flipping out on me.&quot; On May 1, in an interview with &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Love discussed the possibility of a reunion, and also stated it had been &quot;a mistake&quot; releasing &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Daughter&quot; as a Hole record in 2010. &quot;Eric was right—I kind of cheapened the name, even though I&#x27;m legally allowed to use it. I should save &#x27;Hole&#x27; for the lineup everybody wants to see and had the balls to put &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Daughter&quot; under my own name.&quot; Love further discussed the possibility of reuniting the band, saying:

No one&#x27;s been dormant. Patty teaches drumming and drums in three indie bands. Melissa has her metal-nerd thing going on—her dream is to play Castle Donington with Dokken. Eric hasn&#x27;t flipped—I jammed with him, he&#x27;s still doing his Thurston [Moore]-crazy tunings, still corresponding with Kevin Shields. We all get along great. There are bands who reunite and hate each others&#x27; guts.

===2019–present: Possible reformation and attempted reunions===
In October 2019, Hole rehearsed at the Hollywood Walk of Fame, in Los Angeles. Nothing transpired after the event, since Love had relocated to the United Kingdom afterwards. In March 2020, Love and Auf Der Maur planned a performance at the &quot;Bans Off My Body&quot; event, which was eventually canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Artistry==
===Composition===
Initially, Hole drew inspiration from no wave and experimental bands, which is evident in their earliest recordings, specifically &quot;Retard Girl&quot;, but frontwoman Love also drew from a variety of influences. Love cited post-punk group Echo &amp; the Bunnymen and classic rock such as Neil Young and Fleetwood Mac. The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot;, was heavily influenced by noise and punk rock, using discordant melodies, distortion, and feedback, with Love&#x27;s vocals ranging from whispers to guttural screams. Love described the band&#x27;s earliest songwriting as being based on &quot;really crazy Sonic Youth tunings&quot;. Nonetheless, Love claimed to have aimed for a pop sound early on: &quot;There&#x27;s a part of me that wants to have a grindcore band and another that wants to have a Raspberries-type pop band&quot;, she told &quot;Flipside&quot; magazine in 1991. Both Love and Erlandson were fans of the notorious LA punk band the Germs. In a 1996 interview for a Germs tribute documentary, Erlandson said: &quot;I think every band is based on one song, and our band was based on &quot;Forming&quot; ... Courtney brought it into rehearsal, and she knew, like, three chords and it was the only punk rock song we could play.&quot;

The band&#x27;s second album &quot;Live Through This&quot;, captured a less abrasive sound, while maintaining the group&#x27;s original punk roots. &quot;I want this record to be shocking to the people who don&#x27;t think we have a soft edge, and at the same time, [to know] that we haven&#x27;t lost our very, very hard edge&quot;, Love told VH1 in 1994. The group&#x27;s third album, &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;, incorporated power pop into their hard rock sound, and was heavily inspired by California bands; Love was also influenced by Fleetwood Mac and My Bloody Valentine while writing the album. The group&#x27;s 2010 release, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, featured a more folk rock-oriented sound, utilizing acoustic guitar and softer melodies.

The group&#x27;s chord progressions by and large drew on elements of punk music, which Love described as &quot;grungey&quot;, although not necessarily grunge. Critics described their song style as &quot;deceptively wispy and strummy&quot;, combined with &quot;gunshot guitar choruses&quot;. Although the group&#x27;s sound changed over the course of their career, the dynamic between beauty and ugliness has often been noted, particularly due to the layering of harsh and abrasive riffs which often bury more sophisticated arrangements.

===Lyrical content===
In a 1991 interview, Love stated that lyrics were &quot;the most important&quot; element of songwriting for her. Her lyrics explored a variety of themes throughout Hole&#x27;s career, including body image, rape, child abuse, addiction, celebrity, suicide, elitism, and inferiority complex; all of which were addressed mainly from a female, and often feminist standpoint. This underlying feminism in Love&#x27;s lyrics often led the public and critics to mistakenly associate her with the riot grrrl movement, of which Love was highly critical.

In a 1991 interview with Everett True, Love said: &quot;I try to place [beautiful imagery] next to fucked up imagery, because that&#x27;s how I view things ... I sometimes feel that no one&#x27;s taken the time to write about certain things in rock, that there&#x27;s a certain female point of view that&#x27;s never been given space.&quot; Charles Cross has referred to her lyrics on &quot;Live Through This&quot; as being &quot;true extensions of her diary&quot;, and she has admitted that a great deal of the lyrics from &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot; were excisions from her journals.

Throughout Hole&#x27;s career, Love&#x27;s lyrics were often influenced by literature: The title of the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Live Through This&quot;, for example (as well as lyrics from the track &quot;Asking for It&quot;) is directly drawn from &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;; and the group&#x27;s single &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; (the title track to their 1998 album), contains quotes from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; and Dante Rossetti&#x27;s poem &quot;A Superscription&quot;. Love had had a minor background in literature, having briefly studied English literature in her early twenties.

===Performances===
Throughout the duration of the 1990s, the band received widespread media coverage due to Love&#x27;s often rambunctious and unpredictable behavior onstage. The band often destroyed equipment and guitars at the end of concerts, and Love would ramble between songs, bring fans onstage, and stage dive, sometimes returning with her clothes torn off of her or sustaining injuries. In a 1995 &quot;New York&quot; magazine article, journalist John Homans addressed Love&#x27;s frequent stage diving during Hole&#x27;s concerts:

The most shocking, frightening, and fascinating image in rock in the last few years is Courtney Love&#x27;s stage dive ... When some male performers do it, it looks like muscular, frat-boy fun, controlled aggression ... For obvious reasons, the practice was strictly no-girls-allowed, but Love, typically, decided that she wanted to do it, too. Groped, ravaged, she compared the experience to being raped, wrote a song about it, and now does it just about every show.

Nina Gordon of Veruca Salt, who toured with Hole in 1995, recalled Love&#x27;s erratic behavior onstage, saying &quot;She would just go off and [the rest of the band] would just kind of stand there.&quot; The majority of Love&#x27;s chaotic behavior onstage was a result of heavy drug use at the time, which she admitted: &quot;I was completely high on dope; I cannot remember much about it.&quot; She later criticized her behavior during that time, saying: &quot;I [saw] pictures of how I looked. It&#x27;s disgusting. I&#x27;m ashamed. There&#x27;s death and there&#x27;s disease and there&#x27;s misery and there&#x27;s giving up your soul ... The human spirit mixed with certain powders is not the person, it&#x27;s [a] demonic presence.&quot;

Love&#x27;s stage attire also garnered notoriety, influenced in part by Carroll Baker&#x27;s wardrobe in the film &quot;Baby Doll&quot; (1956). The style was later dubbed &quot;kinderwhore&quot; by the media, and consisted of babydoll dresses, slips and nightgowns, and smeared makeup. Kurt Loder likened her onstage attire to a &quot;debauched ragdoll&quot;, and John Peel noted in his review of the band&#x27;s 1994 Reading Festival performance, that &quot;[Love], swaying wildly and with lipstick smeared on her face, hands and, I think, her back, as well as on the collar of her dress, ... would have drawn whistles of astonishment in Bedlam. The band teetered on the edge of chaos, generating a tension which I cannot remember having felt before from any stage.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; referred to the style as &quot;a slightly more politically charged version of grunge; apathy turned into ruinous angst, which soon became high fashion&#x27;s favorite pose.&quot;

The band&#x27;s set lists for live shows were often loose, featuring improvisational jams and rough performances of unreleased songs. By 1998, their live performances had become less aggressive and more restrained, although Love continued to bring fans onstage, and would often go into the crowd while singing.

==Legacy==
Hole was one of the most commercially successful female-fronted alternative rock bands in history, selling over 3 million records in the United States between 1991 and 2010. In spite of Love&#x27;s often polarizing reputation in the media, Hole received consistent critical praise for their output, and was often noted for the predominant feminist commentary found in Love&#x27;s lyrics, which scholars have credited as &quot;articulating a third-wave feminist consciousness&quot;. Love&#x27;s subversive onstage persona and public image coincided with the band&#x27;s songs, which expressed &quot;pain, sorrow, and anger, but [an] underlying message of survival, particularly survival in the face of overwhelming circumstances&quot;. Music journalist Maria Raha expressed a similar sentiment in regard to the band&#x27;s significance to third-wave feminism, stating, &quot;Whether you love Courtney [Love] or hate her, Hole was the highest-profile female-fronted band of the &#x27;90s to openly and directly sing about feminism.&quot;

While &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; compared the effect of Love&#x27;s marriage to Cobain on the band to that of John Lennon and Yoko Ono, they noted that &quot;Love&#x27;s confrontational stage presence, as well as her gut-wrenching vocals and powerful punk-pop songcraft, made her an alternative-rock star in her own right.&quot; Author Nick Wise made a similar comparison in discussion of the band&#x27;s public image, stating, &quot;Not since Yoko Ono&#x27;s marriage to John Lennon has a woman&#x27;s personal life and exploits within the rock arena been so analyzed and dissected.&quot;

The band has been cited as a major influence on several contemporary artists, including indie singer-songwriter Scout Niblett, Brody Dalle (of The Distillers and Spinnerette), Sky Ferreira, Lana Del Rey, Tove Lo, Tegan and Sara, Annie Hardy (of Giant Drag), Victoria Legrand (of Beach House), and the British rock band Nine Black Alps. The band ranked at number 77 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Hard Rock Artists&quot; list.

==Materials loss==
In 2008 a fire swept through Universal Studios Hollywood destroying buildings belonging to Universal Music Group. News reports said that many artists including Hole had lost recordings in the fire. Love and the band were one of the artists suing UMG for the loss; however, on August 16, 2019, the band was removed from that lawsuit as it was amended &quot;based on UMG&#x27;s representations that none of Hole&#x27;s original masters were destroyed (subject to confirmation)&quot;.

<text>Andrew Lang (31 March 1844 – 20 July 1912) was a Scottish poet, novelist, literary critic, and contributor to the field of anthropology. He is best known as a collector of folk and fairy tales. The Andrew Lang lectures at the University of St Andrews are named after him.

== Biography ==
Lang was born in 1844 in Selkirk, Scottish Borders. He was the eldest of the eight children born to John Lang, the town clerk of Selkirk, and his wife Jane Plenderleath Sellar, who was the daughter of Patrick sellar, factor to the first Duke of Sutherland. On 17 April 1875, he married Leonora Blanche Alleyne, youngest daughter of C. T. Alleyne of Clifton and Barbados. She was (or should have been) variously credited as author, collaborator, or translator of &quot;Lang&#x27;s Colour/Rainbow Fairy Books&quot; which he edited.

He was educated at Selkirk Grammar School, Loretto School, and the Edinburgh Academy, as well as the University of St Andrews and Balliol College, Oxford, where he took a first class in the final classical schools in 1868, becoming a fellow and subsequently honorary fellow of Merton College. He soon made a reputation as one of the most able and versatile writers of the day as a journalist, poet, critic, and historian. He was a member of the Order of the White Rose, a Neo-Jacobite society which attracted many writers and artists in the 1890s and 1900s. In 1906, he was elected FBA.

He died of angina pectoris on 20 July 1912 at the Tor-na-Coille Hotel in Banchory, Banchory, survived by his wife. He was buried in the cathedral precincts at St Andrews, where a monument can be visited in the south-east corner of the 19th century section.

== Scholarship ==

=== Folklore and anthropology ===
Lang is now chiefly known for his publications on folklore, mythology, and religion. The interest in folklore was from early life; he read John Ferguson McLennan before coming to Oxford, and then was influenced by E. B. Tylor.

The earliest of his publications is &quot;Custom and Myth&quot; (1884). In &quot;&quot; (1887) he explained the &quot;irrational&quot; elements of mythology as survivals from more primitive forms. Lang&#x27;s &quot;Making of Religion&quot; was heavily influenced by the 18th century idea of the &quot;noble savage&quot;: in it, he maintained the existence of high spiritual ideas among so-called &quot;savage&quot; races, drawing parallels with the contemporary interest in occult phenomena in England. His &quot;Blue Fairy Book&quot; (1889) was an illustrated edition of fairy tales that has become a classic. This was followed by many other collections of fairy tales, collectively known as Andrew Lang&#x27;s Fairy Books despite most of the work for them being done by his wife Leonora Blanche Alleyne and a team of assistants. In the preface of the Lilac Fairy Book he credits his wife with translating and transcribing most of the stories in the collections. Lang examined the origins of totemism in &quot;Social Origins&quot; (1903).

=== Psychical research ===
Lang was one of the founders of &quot;psychical research&quot; and his other writings on anthropology include &quot;The Book of Dreams and Ghosts&quot; (1897), &quot;Magic and Religion&quot; (1901) and &quot;The Secret of the Totem&quot; (1905). He served as president of the Society for Psychical Research in 1911.

Lang extensively cited nineteenth- and twentieth-century European spiritualism to challenge the idea of his teacher, Tylor, that belief in spirits and animism were inherently irrational. Lang used Tylor&#x27;s work and his own psychical research in an effort to posit an anthropological critique of materialism. Andrew Lang fiercely debated with his Folklore Society colleague Edward Clodd over &#x27;Psycho-folklore&#x27; a strand of the discipline which aimed to connect folklore with psychical research.

=== Classical scholarship ===

He collaborated with S. H. Butcher in a prose translation (1879) of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and with E. Myers and Walter Leaf in a prose version (1883) of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, both still noted for their archaic but attractive style. He was a Homeric scholar of conservative views. Other works include &quot;Homer and the Study of Greek&quot; found in &quot;Essays in Little&quot; (1891), &quot;Homer and the Epic&quot; (1893); a prose translation of &quot;The Homeric Hymns&quot; (1899), with literary and mythological essays in which he draws parallels between Greek myths and other mythologies; &quot;Homer and his Age&quot; (1906); and &quot;Homer and Anthropology&quot; (1908).

=== Historian ===

Lang&#x27;s writings on Scottish history are characterised by a scholarly care for detail, a piquant literary style, and a gift for disentangling complicated questions. &quot;The Mystery of Mary Stuart&quot; (1901) was a consideration of the fresh light thrown on Mary, Queen of Scots, by the Lennox manuscripts in the University Library, Cambridge, approving of her and criticising her accusers.

He also wrote monographs on &quot;The Portraits and Jewels of Mary Stuart&quot; (1906) and &quot;James VI and the Gowrie Mystery&quot; (1902). The somewhat unfavourable view of John Knox presented in his book &quot;John Knox and the Reformation&quot; (1905) aroused considerable controversy. He gave new information about the continental career of the Young Pretender in &quot;Pickle the Spy&quot; (1897), an account of Alastair Ruadh MacDonnell, whom he identified with Pickle, a notorious Hanoverian spy. This was followed by &quot;The Companions of Pickle&quot; (1898) and a monograph on Prince Charles Edward (1900). In 1900 he began a &quot;History of Scotland from the Roman Occupation&quot; (1900). &quot;The Valet&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; (1903), which takes its title from an essay on Dumas&#x27;s &quot;Man in the Iron Mask&quot;, collects twelve papers on historical mysteries, and &quot;A Monk of Fife&quot; (1896) is a fictitious narrative purporting to be written by a young Scot in France in 1429–1431.

=== Other writings ===
Lang&#x27;s earliest publication was a volume of metrical experiments, &quot;The Ballads and Lyrics of Old France&quot; (1872), and this was followed at intervals by other volumes of dainty verse, &quot;Ballades in Blue China&quot; (1880, enlarged edition, 1888), &quot;Ballads and Verses Vain&quot; (1884), selected by Mr Austin Dobson; &quot;Rhymes à la Mode&quot; (1884), &quot;Grass of Parnassus&quot; (1888), &quot;Ban and Arrière Ban&quot; (1894), &quot;New Collected Rhymes&quot; (1905). His 1890 collection, &quot;Old Friends: Essays in Epistolary Parody&quot;, contains letters combining characters from different sources, in what is now known as a crossover, including one based on Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; and Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; – an early example of a published derivative work based on Austen.

Lang was active as a journalist in various ways, ranging from sparkling &quot;leaders&quot; for the &quot;Daily News&quot; to miscellaneous articles for the &quot;Morning Post&quot;, and for many years he was literary editor of &quot;Longman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;; no critic was in more request, whether for occasional articles and introductions to new editions or as editor of dainty reprints.

He edited &quot;The Poems and Songs of Robert Burns&quot; (1896), and was responsible for the &quot;Life and Letters&quot; (1897) of JG Lockhart, and &quot;The Life, Letters and Diaries&quot; (1890) of Sir Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh. Lang discussed literary subjects with the same humour and acidity that marked his criticism of fellow folklorists, in &quot;Books and Bookmen&quot; (1886), &quot;Letters to Dead Authors&quot; (1886), &quot;Letters on Literature&quot; (1889), etc.

<text>Yasiin Bey ( ; born Dante Terrell Smith; December 11, 1973), formerly known as Mos Def ( ), is an American rapper, singer, and actor. A prominent figure in conscious hip hop, he is recognized for his use of wordplay and commentary on social and political issues, such as police brutality, American exceptionalism, and the status of African Americans in the United States.

After embarking on his career in 1994, he joined his siblings in the short-lived rap group Urban Thermo Dynamics (UTD) and guest appeared on albums by Da Bush Babees and De La Soul. In 1996, he and fellow Brooklyn-based rapper Talib Kweli formed the duo Black Star, whose debut album &quot;Mos Def &amp; Talib Kweli Are Black Star&quot; (1998) spawned the singles &quot;Definition&quot; and &quot;Respiration&quot; (featuring Common). His debut solo album, &quot;Black on Both Sides&quot; (1999) was met with critical acclaim, along with his fourth album &quot;The Ecstatic&quot; (2009). Bey&#x27;s 2000 single, &quot;Oh No&quot; (with Pharoahe Monch featuring Nate Dogg) remains his sole entry on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 as a solo act. In 2014, About.com listed him 14th on its &quot;50 Greatest Rappers of All Time&quot;.

A former child actor in television films, sitcoms, and theater, Bey has appeared in the films &quot;Something the Lord Made&quot;, &quot;Next Day Air&quot;, &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, &quot;16 Blocks&quot;, &quot;Be Kind Rewind&quot;, &quot;The Italian Job&quot;, &quot;The Woodsman&quot;, &quot;Bamboozled&quot;, and &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and in television series such as &quot;Dexter&quot; and &quot;House&quot;. He hosted &quot;Def Poetry Jam&quot; from 2002 to 2007.

==Early life==
Yasiin Bey was born Dante Terrell Smith on December 11, 1973, in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of Sheron Smith and Abdulrahman Smith. The eldest of 12 children and step-children, he was raised by his mother in Brooklyn, while his father lived in New Jersey.

His father was initially a member of the Nation of Islam and later followed Imam Warith Deen Mohammed, who merged into the mainstream Sunni Islam from the Nation of Islam. Bey was not exposed to Islam until the age of 13. He is close friends with fellow Muslim hip-hop artists Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Q-Tip.

Bey attended middle school at Philippa Schuyler Middle School in Bushwick, Brooklyn, where he developed his love for acting. After returning from filming &quot;You Take the Kids&quot; in Los Angeles, and getting into a relationship with an older girl, Bey dropped out of high school during sophomore year. Growing up in New York City, during the crack epidemic of the 1980s and early 1990s, he has spoken about witnessing widespread instances of gang violence, theft, and poverty in society, which he largely avoided by working on plays, Off-Off-Broadway and arts programs. In a particularly traumatic childhood experience, Bey witnessed his then five-year-old younger brother, Ilias Bey (born Denard Smith), get hit by a car. Ilias later adopted the alias DCQ and was described by Bey as &quot;my first partner in hip hop&quot;.

==Music career==

===1994–1998: Beginnings with Rawkus and Black Star===
Bey began his music career in 1994, forming the group UTD (or Urban Thermo Dynamics) along with younger brother DCQ and high-school friend Ces. In 2004, they released the album &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;, their first and only release to date. The album features a compilation of previously unreleased and re-released tracks recorded during the original UTD run.

In 1996, Bey emerged as a solo artist and worked with De La Soul and Da Bush Babees, before he released his own first single, &quot;Universal Magnetic&quot; in 1997.
Bey signed with Rawkus Records and formed the rap group Black Star with Talib Kweli. The duo released an album, &quot;Mos Def &amp; Talib Kweli Are Black Star&quot;, in 1998. Mostly produced by Hi-Tek, the album featured the singles &quot;Respiration&quot; and &quot;Definition&quot;, which both reached in the Billboard Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

===1999–2006: Solo career and various projects===
Bey released his solo debut album &quot;Black on Both Sides&quot; in October 1999, also through Rawkus. The single &quot;Ms. Fat Booty&quot; charted, while the album reached #25 on the Billboard 200. Around this time, he also contributed to the Scritti Politti album &quot;Anomie &amp; Bonhomie&quot;.
In January 2002, Rawkus Records was taken over by Geffen Records, which released his second solo album &quot;The New Danger&quot; in October 2004. It included contributions by Shuggie Otis and Bernie Worrell, Doug Wimbish, and Will Calhoun as the Black Jack Johnson Band. The album reached #5 on the Billboard 200, making it the most successful for the artist to date. The single &quot;Sex, Love &amp; Money&quot; charted, and was nominated for a Grammy Award. Bey&#x27;s final solo album for Geffen Records, titled &quot;True Magic&quot;, was released in 2006.

===2007–2011: Good Music era and name change===
On November 7, 2007, Bey performed live in San Francisco at The Mezzanine venue. The performance was recorded for an upcoming &quot;Live in Concert&quot; DVD. During the event, he announced that he would be releasing a new album to be called &quot;The Ecstatic&quot;. He performed a number of new tracks; in later shows, he previewed tracks produced by Madlib and was rumored to be going to Kanye West for new material. Producer and fellow Def Poet Al Be Back revealed he would be producing on the album as well. The album was released on June 9, 2009; but only Madlib&#x27;s production had made the cut, along with tracks by Preservation, The Neptunes, Mr. Flash, Madlib&#x27;s brother Oh No, J. Dilla, and Georgia Anne Muldrow.

Bey appears alongside Kanye West on the track &quot;Two Words&quot; from &quot;The College Dropout&quot; album, the track &quot;Drunk and Hot Girls&quot; and the bonus track &quot;Good Night&quot; off West&#x27;s third major album, &quot;Graduation&quot;. In 2002, he released the 12&quot; single &quot;Fine&quot;, which was produced by West and featured on the &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; soundtrack.

In 2007, Bey appeared on Stephen Marley&#x27;s debut album &quot;Mind Control&quot; on the song &quot;Hey Baby&quot;. He also appeared on the debut album from Apollo Heights on a track titled &quot;Concern&quot;. That October, he signed a deal with Downtown Records and appeared on a remix to the song &quot;D.A.N.C.E.&quot; by Justice.

In April 2008, he appeared on the title track for a new album by The Roots titled &quot;Rising Down&quot;. The single, &quot;Life In Marvelous Times&quot;, was made officially available through iTunes on November 4, 2008, and was also available for stream on the Roots&#x27; website Okayplayer.

In 2009, he worked with Somali-Canadian rapper K&#x27;naan to produce the track &quot;America&quot; for K&#x27;naan&#x27;s album &quot;Troubadour&quot;.

In April 2009, Bey traveled to South Africa for the first time, and performed with The Robert Glasper Experiment at the renowned Cape Town International Jazz Festival. He treated the South African audience with an encore, introduced by his own rendition of John Coltrane&#x27;s &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;, followed by a sneak preview of the track &quot;M.D. (Doctor)&quot;.

Bey has designed two pairs of limited edition Converse shoes. The shoes were released through Foot Locker stores on August 1, 2009, in limited amounts.

In late 2009, he created his own clothing line with the &quot;UNDRCRWN&quot; brand called the &quot;Mos Def Cut &amp; Sew Collection&quot;. The items were released in select U.S. stores and almost exclusively on the UNDRCRWN website. That year, he was among the MCs aligned with American entrepreneur Damon Dash&#x27;s DD172 and collaborating with American blues rock band the Black Keys on the &quot;Blakroc&quot; album, a project headed by the Black Keys and Damon Dash. Bey appeared with Harlem-bred rapper Jim Jones and the Black Keys on the Late Show with David Letterman to perform the &quot;Blakroc&quot; track &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothing Like You (Hoochie Coo)&quot;.

In 2010, Bey featured on the first single, &quot;Stylo&quot;, from the third Gorillaz album, &quot;Plastic Beach&quot;, alongside soul legend Bobby Womack. He also appeared on the track titled &quot;Sweepstakes&quot;. In March 2010, Bey&#x27;s song &quot;Quiet Dog Bite Hard&quot; was featured in Palm&#x27;s &quot;Life moves fast. Don&#x27;t miss a thing.&quot; campaign.

In September 2010, after appearing on Kanye West&#x27;s G.O.O.D. Friday track &quot;Lord Lord Lord&quot;, Bey confirmed he had signed with GOOD Music. Bey has been an active contributor to the recovery of the oil spill in the Gulf, performing concerts and raising money towards repairing its damages. In June 2010, he recorded a cover of the classic New Orleans song originally by Smokey Johnson, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t My Fault&quot; with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Lenny Kravitz and Trombone Shorty.

In September 2011, the rapper announced that he legally changed his name to Yasiin Bey and would go by that name, retiring his Mos Def moniker (short for &quot;Most Definitely&quot;). Bey told a reporter &quot;I began to fear that Mos Def was being treated as a product, not a person, so I’ve been going by Yasiin since ’99. At first it was just for friends and family, but now I&#x27;m declaring it openly.&quot; Bey also stated &quot;Mos Def is a name that I built and cultivated over the years, it&#x27;s a name that the streets taught me, a figure of speech that was given to me by the culture and by my environment, and I feel I&#x27;ve done quite a bit with that name. ...it&#x27;s time to expand and move on.&quot; Yasiin is a name in the Qur&#x27;an&#x27;s 36th surah and was important to the rapper who converted to Islam in his teens. Bey said the name change would eliminate &quot;having any moniker or separation between the self that I see and know myself as.&quot;

Shortly after the name change announcement, Bey recorded as the narrator of the children&#x27;s hip hop musical, &quot;Pacha&#x27;s Pajamas: A Story Written By Nature&quot;.

===2012–present: Later career and retirement===
In January 2012, it was reported that Bey and Talib Kweli had begun &quot;to resurrect&quot; Black Star. In 2015, Bey was featured on A$AP Rocky&#x27;s second studio album &quot;At. Long. Last. ASAP&quot;, on the track &quot;Back Home&quot;, alongside Acyde and the deceased A$AP Yams. Bey again revived his Mos Def moniker for two new songs in August 2015, titled &quot;Basquiat Ghostwriter&quot; and &quot;Sensei on the Block&quot;.

On January 19, 2016, Bey announced his retirement from both the music and film industries on Kanye West&#x27;s website: &quot;I&#x27;m retiring from the music recording industry as it is currently assembled today, and also Hollywood, effective immediately. I&#x27;m releasing my final album this year, and that&#x27;s that.&quot; After announcing his retirement, he expressed gratitude to everyone who has supported him over the years and revealed his intention to enter the fashion industry and complete a handful of films. Bey also confirmed he still planned to release a collaborative project with Ferrari Sheppard called Dec 99th.

In October 2016, a planned concert in London was cancelled due to travel restrictions imposed on the artist; other European dates suffered the same fate. On October 14, Bey posted a video to Facebook where he announced that he was still planning to retire: &quot;I&#x27;m retiring for real this year, this week. With the 17th anniversary of &quot;Black on Both Sides&quot; being released, I am grateful to have had the career that I have been able to enjoy.&quot; He also announced one last concert which he said he would be live streaming from Cape Town, South Africa. In November 2016, he was granted the ability to leave but not reenter South Africa and was put on &quot;South Africa&#x27;s &#x27;undesirable persons&#x27; list&quot;. He said he would perform one show in Harlem and three in Washington D.C. after leaving South Africa. He announced that Dec 99th, his final album, would be released on December 9. He released three singles from it, &quot;Local Time&quot;, &quot;N.A.W.&quot; and &quot;Seaside Panic Room&quot;. On December 5, 2016, he announced the title of two albums, &quot;Negus in Natural Person&quot; and &quot;As Promised&quot;, the latter of which is a collaboration with Southern hip hop producer Mannie Fresh, initially titled &quot;OMFGOD&quot;. In 2017, his claims of retirement were seen as questionable as he played shows on September 13, at the Fox Theater in Oakland as part of Black Star and performed on Gorillaz&#x27; Humanz World Tour, performing &quot;Stylo&quot; with Peven Everett, who filled in for Bobby Womack, who died in 2014. He also has yet to release or announce a release date for the last two albums of his career.

In February 2018, Bey announced, on stage, a new Black Star studio album, produced by Madlib, would be released in 2018. However, no specific release date was made available. Later on that year, Bey appeared on the titular track of &quot;Kids See Ghosts&quot;, the collaborative effort of Kanye West and Kid Cudi. In March 2019, he debuted his album, &quot;ንጉሥ (pronounced Negus)&quot; at a listening session as part of Art Basel Hong Kong. In a press release, he said that the album &quot;will continue to unfold as a series of varied installations around the world&quot;. He has no plans of releasing the album digitally or physically.

On June 28, 2019, Bey appeared on &quot;Bandana&quot;, an album by Freddie Gibbs and Madlib, alongside Black Thought, on a track named &quot;Education&quot;. In November 2019, he stated that unreleased music, such as his collaborative album with Mannie Fresh, was still &quot;on deck&quot; for release. In 2021, he launched &quot;The Midnight Miracle&quot; podcast on Luminary, along with Dave Chappelle and Talib Kweli.

==Acting career==
===Beginnings as child actor===
Prior to his career in music, Bey entered public life as a child actor, having played roles in television movies, sitcoms and theater, some of which were under the name Dante Beze. At the age of 14, he appeared in the TV movie &quot;God Bless the Child&quot;, starring Mare Winningham, which aired on ABC in 1988. He played the oldest child in the 1990 family sitcom &quot;You Take the Kids&quot;, shortly before it was cancelled. In 1995, he played the character Dante, Bill Cosby&#x27;s sidekick on the short-lived detective show &quot;The Cosby Mysteries&quot;. In 1996, he starred in a Visa check card commercial featuring Deion Sanders. He also had a small role alongside Michael Jackson in his short film and music video &quot;Ghosts&quot; (1996).

===Feature films, theater and television===
After brief appearances in &quot;Bamboozled&quot; and &quot;Monster&#x27;s Ball&quot;, Bey played a rapper who is reluctant to sign with a major label in &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;. He was nominated for an Image Award and a Teen Choice Award.

In 2001, he took a supporting role to Beyoncé Knowles and Mehki Phifer in the MTV movie &quot;&quot; as Lt. Miller, a crooked cop.

In 2002, he played the role of Booth in Suzan-Lori Parks&#x27; &quot;Topdog/Underdog&quot;, a Tony-nominated and Pulitzer-winning Broadway play. He and co-star Jeffrey Wright won a Special Award from the Outer Critics Circle Award for their joint performance. He played Left Ear in the 2003 film &quot;The Italian Job&quot;. That same year, he appeared in the Alicia Keys music video You Don&#x27;t Know My Name.

In television, Bey has appeared on &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;, and hosted the award-winning HBO spoken word show &quot;Def Poetry&quot;. He also appeared on the sitcom &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot; as the disabled friend of Michael Kyle (Damon Wayans).

Bey won &quot;Best Actor, Independent Movie&quot; at the 2005 Black Reel Awards for his portrayal of Detective Sgt. Lucas in &quot;The Woodsman&quot;. For his portrayal of Vivien Thomas in HBO&#x27;s film &quot;Something the Lord Made&quot;, he was nominated for an Emmy and a Golden Globe, and won the Image Award. He also played a bandleader in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Lackawanna Blues&quot;. He then landed the role of Ford Prefect in the 2005 movie adaptation of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;.

In 2006, Bey appeared in &quot;Dave Chappelle&#x27;s Block Party&quot; alongside Black Star partner Talib Kweli, while also contributing to the film&#x27;s soundtrack. He was also featured as the banjo player in the Pixie Sketch&quot; from &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show: The Lost Episodes&quot;, though his appearance was edited out of the DVD. He starred in the action film &quot;16 Blocks&quot; alongside Bruce Willis and David Morse. He also landed a recurring guest role on &quot;Boondocks&quot;, starring as Gangstalicious. He is set to be in &quot;Toussaint&quot;, a film about Haitian revolutionary Toussaint Louverture, opposite Don Cheadle and Wesley Snipes. He made a cameo appearance as himself in the movie &quot;Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot;.

In 2007, Bey narrated the PBS-broadcast documentary &quot;Prince Among Slaves&quot;.

In 2008, Bey starred in the Michel Gondry movie &quot;Be Kind Rewind&quot;, playing a video rental store employee whose best friend is played by co-star Jack Black. He also portrayed Chuck Berry in the film &quot;Cadillac Records&quot;, for which he was nominated for a Black Reel Award and an Image Award.

In 2009, he appeared in the &quot;House&quot; episode titled &quot;Locked In&quot; as a patient suffering from locked-in syndrome. His performance was well received, with E! saying that Mos Def &quot;delivers an Emmy-worthy performance&quot;. He was also in the 2009 film &quot;Next Day Air&quot;.

In 2010, he appeared on the children&#x27;s show &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot; as Super Mr. Superhero. He also appeared in &quot;A Free Man of Color&quot;, John Guare&#x27;s play at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre.

In 2011, he began a multi-episode appearance on the sixth season of Showtime television series &quot;Dexter&quot;. He played Brother Sam, an ex-convict who has supposedly found religion despite finding himself in violent situations.

In January 2016, Bey announced his retirement from the music and the film industries on Kanye West&#x27;s website. In March 2016, it was announced that he had been attached to star in &quot;his last live-action film&quot;, &quot;The Disconnected&quot;, a science fiction thriller dealing with policing, identity, and the intersection of technology and humanity.

== Social and political views ==
In 2000, paired with Talib Kweli, Bey organized the Hip Hop for Respect project to speak out against police brutality. It was created in response to the 1999 police shooting of Amadou Diallo, and sought to accumulate 41 artists to the roster, one to match each of the 41 gunshots fired on Diallo.

Bey is well known for his leftist activism. In 2000, he performed a benefit concert for death row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal. In May 2005, Bey, Talib Kweli, R&amp;B singer Martin Luther and City Councilman Charles Barron approached New York City Hall, demanding the withdrawal of the $1 million bounty for Assata Shakur.

In September 2005, Bey released the single &quot;Katrina Clap&quot;, renamed &quot;Dollar Day&quot; for &quot;True Magic&quot; (utilizing the instrumental for New Orleans rappers UTP&#x27;s &quot;Nolia Clap&quot;). The song is a criticism of the Bush administration&#x27;s response to Hurricane Katrina. On the night of the MTV Video Music Awards, Bey pulled up in front of Radio City Music Hall on a flatbed truck and began performing the &quot;Katrina Clap&quot; single in front of a crowd that quickly gathered around him. He was subsequently arrested for not having a public performance permit in his possession.

In October 2006, Bey appeared on &quot;4Real&quot;, a documentary television series. Appearing in the episode &quot;City of God&quot;, he and the 4Real crew traveled to City of God, a favela in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to meet Brazilian MC MV Bill and learn about the crime and social problems of the community.

On September 7, 2007, Bey appeared on &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot; where he spoke about racism against African Americans, citing the government response to Hurricane Katrina, the Jena Six case, and the murder conviction of Mumia Abu-Jamal. He appeared on &quot;Real Time&quot; again on March 27, 2009, and spoke about the risk of nuclear weapons.

In September 2011, Bey joined the cast of the environmental children&#x27;s hip hop musical &quot;Pacha&#x27;s Pajamas: A Story Written By Nature&quot; as narrator. In July 2013, he appeared in a short film released by the human rights organization Reprieve, depicting the forced-feeding methods used at the Guantanamo Bay detention camps. This transpired after a document containing the military instructions for the procedure was leaked.

In September 2018, Bey and advertising executive Free Richardson opened an art exhibition to the public in an art gallery in the South Bronx, called the Compound, centered around hip-hop and fine art. The goal of this gallery was to help bridge the gap between the two fields, by showcasing artists from marginalized backgrounds who normally would not be represented in art galleries. Art forms with negative connotations, such as graffiti, as presented in a more optimal context. &quot;The purpose of the gallery is to say all art is equal,&quot; Richardson said. &quot;But we are in the borough that created hip-hop, which is the biggest art form in the world, so it&#x27;s always an extending arm. It&#x27;s always present.&quot;

==Legacy==
About.com ranked him #14 on its list of the Top 50 MCs of Our Time, and &quot;The Source&quot; ranked him #23 on their list of the Top 50 Lyricists of All Time. AllMusic called him one of the most promising rappers to emerge in the late 1990s, and one of hip-hop&#x27;s brightest hopes entering the 21st century. He has influenced numerous hip hop artists throughout his career, including Lupe Fiasco, Jay Electronica, Kid Cudi, and Saigon, and Logic. Kendrick Lamar once mentioned him as a very early inspiration as a young rapper, though Lamar denied being a part of the conscious rap movement. He has also directly influenced artists outside of hip-hop, including English singer-songwriters Adele and Amy Winehouse.

==Personal life==
Bey married Maria Yepes in 1996. He filed for divorce from her in 2006. She took him to court over failure in child-support obligations, paying $2,000 short of the monthly $10,000 he had been ordered to pay for their two daughters. He has four other children, including R&amp;B singer and record producer Laila Smith, best known as Laila!.

Bey&#x27;s mother, Sheron Smith, managed part of her son&#x27;s career. She was a motivational speaker and authored the book &quot;Shine Your Light: A Life Skills Workbook&quot;, where she details her experience as a single mother raising him. Smith died in 2023.

In January 2016, Bey was ordered to leave South Africa and not return for five years, having stayed in the country illegally on an expired tourist visa granted in May 2013. That month, he was charged with using an unrecognized World Passport and having lived illegally in South Africa since 2014. He had reportedly recruited Kanye West to help defend him, and posted a message on West&#x27;s website announcing his retirement from show business. There was a court case in relation to immigration offenses involving him and his family. He was allowed to leave South Africa on November 22, 2016, but was barred from coming back.

<doc id="142543" wikidata="Q1396507" url="?curid=142543" title="Sorley MacLean">
<text>Sorley MacLean (; 26 October 1911 – 24 November 1996) was a Scottish Gaelic poet, described by the Scottish Poetry Library as &quot;one of the major Scottish poets of the modern era&quot; because of his &quot;mastery of his chosen medium and his engagement with the European poetic tradition and European politics&quot;. Nobel Prize Laureate Seamus Heaney credited MacLean with saving Scottish Gaelic poetry.

He was raised in a strict Presbyterian family on the island of Raasay, immersed in Gaelic culture and literature from birth, but abandoned religion for socialism. In the late 1930s, he befriended many Scottish Renaissance figures, such as Hugh MacDiarmid and Douglas Young. He was wounded three times while serving in the Royal Corps of Signals during the North African Campaign. MacLean published little after the war, due to his perfectionism. In 1956, he became head teacher at Plockton High School, where he advocated for the use of the Gaelic language in formal education.

In his poetry, MacLean juxtaposed traditional Gaelic elements with mainstream European elements, frequently comparing the Highland Clearances with contemporary events, especially the Spanish Civil War. His work was a unique fusion of traditional and modern elements that has been credited with restoring Gaelic tradition to its proper place and reinvigorating and modernizing the Gaelic language. Although his most influential works, &quot;Dàin do Eimhir&quot; and &quot;An Cuilthionn&quot;, were published in 1943, MacLean did not become well known until the 1970s, when his works were published in English translation. His later poem &quot;Hallaig&quot;, published 1954, achieved &quot;cult status&quot; outside Gaelic-speaking circles for its supernatural representation of a village depopulated in the Highland Clearances and came to represent all Scottish Gaelic poetry in the English-speaking imagination.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Sorley MacLean was born in Òsgaig, Raasay on 26 October 1911; Scottish Gaelic was his first language. Before he went to school at the age of six, he spoke very little English. He was the second of five sons born to Malcolm (1880–1951) and Christina MacLean (1886–1974). The family owned a small croft and ran a tailoring business, but they later gave up the croft to move to a better house, which proved detrimental to their finances when the Great Depression took a high toll on the tailoring business. His brothers were John (1910–1970), a schoolteacher and later rector of Oban High School, who was also a piper; Calum (1915–1960), a noted folklorist and ethnographer; and Alasdair (1918–1999) and Norman (c.1917–c.1980), who became general practitioners. Sorley&#x27;s two younger sisters, Isobel and Mary, were also schoolteachers. His patronymic was Somhairle mac Chaluim &#x27;ic Chaluim &#x27;ic Iain &#x27;ic Tharmaid &#x27;ic Iain &#x27;ic Tharmaid; he could not trace his genealogy with certainty to the eighth generation.

At home, he was steeped in Gaelic culture and beul-aithris (the oral tradition), especially old songs. His mother, a Nicolson, had been raised near Portree, although her family was of Lochalsh origin; her family had been involved in Highland Land League activism for tenant rights. His father had been raised on Raasay, but his family was originally from North Uist and, before that, probably Mull. Both sides of the family had been evicted during the Highland Clearances, of which many people in the community still had a clear recollection. Both his mother&#x27;s and father&#x27;s families contained individuals who were considered accomplished by their communities, whether through formal education or extensive knowledge of the oral tradition.

What MacLean learned of the history of the Gaels, especially of the Clearances, had a significant impact on his worldview and politics. On his mother&#x27;s side were three noteworthy singers, two pipers, and a village bard.. He said that &#x27;The most intellectual of my relations was a sceptic and Socialist (my uncle in Jordanhill, Alex Nicolson)&#x27;. Nicolson had been involved in the ILP and imprisoned as a conscientious objector in WWI and was also a noted historian and Gaelic scholar. Of especial note was MacLean&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Mary Matheson, whose family had been evicted from Lochalsh in the 18th century. Until her death in 1923, she lived with the family and taught MacLean many traditional songs from Kintail and Lochalsh, as well as Skye. As a child, MacLean enjoyed fishing trips with his aunt Peigi, who taught him other songs. Unlike other members of his family, MacLean could not sing, a fact that he connected with his impetus to write poetry.

===Calvinism===

MacLean was raised in the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland, which he described as &quot;the strictest of Calvinist fundamentalism&quot;. Calvinism taught that God would save a small portion of humanity, the elect, while the vast majority were doomed by the sinfulness inherent in human nature. Only 5% of the congregation took communion; the remainder were considered mere &quot;adherents&quot; who were probably destined for eternal torment in hell. Free Presbyterians believed that the Free Church was too lenient, let alone the Church of Scotland. They prohibited any form of amusement on the Sabbath, but had a rich tradition of unaccompanied psalm singing.

MacLean later said that he had abandoned religion for socialism at the age of twelve, as he refused to accept that a majority of human beings were consigned to eternal damnation. In 1941, he wrote that &quot;perhaps my obsession with the cause of the unhappy, the unsuccessful, the oppressed comes from this.&quot; The pessimism of the Calvinist tradition had a strong impact on his world-view, and he also retained &quot;a puritanical contempt for mere worldly riches and power&quot;. Later in life, he had a complicated view of the church and religion. Although he criticized the Presbyterian church&#x27;s suppression of Gaelic song, Scottish traditional music, and the oral tradition, as well as the negative effect of church teachings on some social groups, especially women, Professor Donald Meek wrote that at times MacLean seemed to articulate the ideas of liberation theology. John MacInnes has argued that his evangelical Presbyterian background was an important influence on his choice of Gaelic as the medium for his poetry and the manner of its expression. MacLean defended the Free Presbyterian Church against opponents who had little familiarity with it, once describing Free Presbyterian Church elders as &quot;saintly, just saintly men&quot;. Sometimes he altered his poetry to avoid offending the religious members of his family. He also admired the linguistic and literary sophistication and creativity of Protestant sermons in Gaelic. The wide vocabulary, high register, and passion of these sermons had a significant impact on his poetic style.

===1930s===
He was educated at Raasay Primary School and Portree Secondary School. In 1929, he left home to attend the University of Edinburgh. For economic reasons, he chose to study English literature instead of Celtic studies, a decision he later regretted &quot;because I was interested only in poetry and only in some poetry at that.&quot; He intensely disliked the head of the English department, Herbert Grierson, who favoured different poets than MacLean; MacLean also felt that Grierson imposed his aesthetic preferences on the department. MacLean&#x27;s academic work has been described as merely &quot;dutiful&quot;. While at Edinburgh, MacLean also took classes in the Celtic Department, then under William J. Watson. He was involved in literary circles, played for the university shinty team, and, like many other British intellectuals of the same era, was Pro-Soviet and, while never an official member, he was involved as a &quot;fellow traveller&quot; with the Communist Party of Great Britain. MacLean later described an occasion in which he joined a demonstration against Sir Oswald Mosley, the leader of the British Union of Fascists. According to Celtic scholar Emma Dymock, MacLean&#x27;s education at Edinburgh broadened his horizons and the city itself was significant in his life. While in Edinburgh, he also observed urban poverty, slums, and overcrowding, which was especially severe due to the continuing Great Depression. After his graduation in 1933 with a first-class degree, he remained in Edinburgh and studied at Moray House Teachers&#x27; Training College, where he met Hugh MacDiarmid.

In 1934, he returned to Skye to teach English at Portree High School. After the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, he considered volunteering to fight in the International Brigades; according to his daughter, he would have gone if not for the poverty of his family and his own responsibilities as their provider. At the time, his mother was seriously ill and his father&#x27;s business was failing. In January 1938, MacLean accepted a teaching position at Tobermory High School on the Isle of Mull, where he stayed until December. The year he spent on Mull had a profound effect on him, because Mull was still devastated from nineteenth-century Highland Clearances, during which MacLean&#x27;s own ancestors had been evicted. MacLean later said, &quot;I believe Mull had much to do with my poetry: its physical beauty, so different from Skye&#x27;s, with the terrible imprint of the clearances on it, made it almost intolerable for a Gael.&quot; He believed that fascism was likely to emerge victorious in Europe, and was further dismayed by the continuing decline of the Gaelic language.

Between 1939 and 1941, he taught at Boroughmuir High School in Edinburgh, and in Hawick. During this period, he wrote most of the poetry that would become &quot;Dàin do Eimhir&quot;, including the epic &quot;An Cuilthionn&quot;. MacLean cultivated friendships with Scottish Renaissance poets, including MacDiarmid, Robert Garioch, Norman MacCaig, Douglas Young, and George Campbell Hay. MacLean, also a noted historian, published two influential papers on nineteenth-century Gaelic poetry in &quot;Transactions of the &quot; in 1938 and 1939, which challenged the Celtic Twilight view of Scottish Gaelic literature. MacLean accused the &quot;Celtic Twilightists&quot; of &quot;attributing to Gaelic poetry the very opposite of every quality which it actually has&quot;, and stated that their claims only succeeded because the Twilightists catered solely to an English-speaking audience. He pointed out that the apparent sentimentality and sense of impotence within surviving poetry about the Highland Clearances may well have been due to the fact that Anglo-Scottish landlords would not have tolerated poetry that was openly critical of them. His use of Gaelic poetry as a potential source material for historical studies was also radically innovative at the time.

===World War II===
Upon the outbreak of war in 1939, MacLean wanted to volunteer for the Cameron Highlanders but was prevented due to the shortage of teachers. He was drafted into the Royal Corps of Signals in September 1940 and was sent overseas to North Africa in December 1941. In the North African Campaign, he served in the Royal Horse Artillery and was wounded on three occasions, but on the first two not severely enough to be classified as a casualty. His military career ended in November 1942 during the Second Battle of El Alamein. A land mine exploded near the command post where MacLean was working, throwing him through the air. He was wounded in the leg and broke several bones in his feet. MacLean wrote a few poems about the war in which he challenged the traditional Gaelic exaltation of heroism, exemplified by the lament for Alasdair of Glengarry; he viewed physical courage as morally neutral, since it was also valued by Nazis and used for evil ends.

MacLean returned to Britain for convalescence in March 1943. He was discharged from Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in August 1943 and released from the army in September. In the fall of 1943, he resumed teaching at Boroughmuir, where he met Renee Cameron in 1944. They married on 24 July 1946 in Inverness and had three daughters and six grandchildren. According to friends, their marriage was happy and peaceful, as they complemented each other well, and MacLean &quot;mellowed&quot; with age and family life. He had never been a card carrying member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, and the Soviet occupation of Poland after the war caused MacLean to break with his former admiration for the Soviet Union and Stalinism. As a member of the Anti-Stalinist left, however, MacLean always remained a strong believer in social justice. During this period, he frequently reviewed poetry and continued to make friends in literary circles, including the younger poets Iain Crichton Smith and George Mackay Brown. He became particularly close to Sydney Goodsir Smith, who shared a flat with MacLean and his family for more than a year. In 1947 he was promoted to Principal Teacher of English at Boroughmuir, but MacLean wanted to return to the western Highlands.

===Later life===

In 1956, MacLean was offered the position of head teacher of Plockton High School in Wester Ross, not far from where his paternal grandmother&#x27;s family had lived. It was a difficult assignment as the remote location was not attractive to teacher candidates, and MacLean frequently had to teach due to vacancies. While at Plockton, he promoted the use of Scottish Gaelic medium education and campaigned for a Highers exam for learners of Gaelic. Before 1968, there was no separate exam for Gaelic learners, who had to compete with native speakers if they took Gaelic Highers. MacLean felt that this unfair policy discouraged many students from studying Gaelic, although he encouraged his students to take the exam even if they were not native speakers. In 1966, he presented a paper to the Gaelic Society of Inverness outlining the practical issues in Gaelic education. MacLean pointed out that in continental Europe, it was not uncommon to study three or four languages in school. According to MacLean, Scottish children would benefit from studying three languages in school alongside English, and &quot;surely it is not expecting too much of Gaelic patriotism to demand that Gaelic should be one of the three?&quot; MacLean set high academic expectations for his students and also promoted shinty; in 1965, the Plockton team won the cup for Ross and Cromarty.

MacLean&#x27;s many friends and visitors commented on his prodigious knowledge and deep interest in genealogy and local history. He continued to participate in politics, eventually joining the Scottish Labour Party. During his later years, he published few poems due to his &quot;concern with quality and authenticity over quantity&quot;; his family responsibilities and career left him little spare time to write. MacLean said that he had burned his poetry instead of publishing it because of his &quot;long years of grinding school-teaching and [his] addiction to an impossible lyric ideal&quot;. 
After his retirement in 1972, MacLean moved to his great-grandmother&#x27;s house at Peinnachorrain in Braes on Skye, with views over the Sound of Raasay, where he entertained frequently. Following the English publication of his poetry, he began to be in demand internationally for poetry readings, for which he traveled to such places as Rotterdam, Baddeck Cape Breton, and Berlin. MacLean was writer in residence at the University of Edinburgh from 1973 to 1975, where he reportedly kept an open door and warm welcome for aspiring Gaelic poets. Later, he was the second &quot;filidh&quot; at the recently founded Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, a Gaelic-medium university on Skye, from 1975 to 1976. He was involved in founding the institution and also served on its board. In 1993, his daughter Catrìona died at the age of 41; MacLean and his wife helped to raise her three children. The poet died of natural causes on 24 November 1996, aged 85, at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness.

==Poetry==
===Influences===

Before he went to university, MacLean was writing in both English and Gaelic. After writing a Gaelic poem, &quot;A&#x27; Chorra-ghritheach&quot; (&quot;The Heron&quot;), in 1932, he decided to write only in Gaelic and burned his earlier poems. MacLean later said, &quot;I was not one who could write poetry if it did not come to me in spite of myself, and if it came, it had to come in Gaelic&quot;. However, it is also clear from his correspondence with MacDiarmid that his choice was also motivated by his determination to preserve and develop the Gaelic language. The Gaelic language had been in decline for several centuries; the 1931 census registered 136,135 Gaelic speakers in Scotland, only 3% of the Scottish population. Despite his decision to write in the language, at times MacLean doubted that Gaelic would survive and his poetry would be appreciated.

For 1,500 years, Scottish Gaelic literature had developed a rich corpus of song and poetry across &quot;literary, sub-literary, and non-literate&quot; registers; it retained the ability to convey &quot;an astonishingly wide range of human experience&quot;. MacLean&#x27;s work drew on this &quot;inherited wealth of immemorial generations&quot;; according to MacInnes, few people were as intimately familiar with the entire corpus of Gaelic poetry, written and oral, as MacLean. In particular, MacLean was inspired by the intense love poetry of William Ross, written in the eighteenth century. Of all poetry, MacLean held in highest regard the Scottish Gaelic songs composed before the nineteenth century by anonymous, illiterate poets and passed down via the oral tradition. He once said that Scottish Gaelic song-poetry was &quot;the chief artistic glory of the Scots, and of all people of Celtic speech, and one of the greatest artistic glories of Europe&quot;.

MacLean once said that various Communist figures meant more to him than any poet, writing to Douglas Young in 1941 that &quot;Lenin, Stalin and Dimitroff now mean more to me than Prometheus and Shelley did in my teens&quot;. Other left-wing figures that inspired MacLean included James Connolly, an Irish trade union leader executed for leading the Easter Rising; John Maclean, Scottish socialist and pacifist; and John Cornford, Julian Bell, and Federico García Lorca, who were killed by the Francoist regime during the Spanish Civil War. Many of these figures were not Gaels, and some critics have noted MacLean&#x27;s unusual generosity to non-Gaelic people in his work. Perhaps the one uniting theme in his work is MacLean&#x27;s anti-elitism and focus on social justice.

Nevertheless, MacLean read widely and was influenced by poets from a variety of styles and eras. Of contemporary poets, Hugh MacDiarmid, Ezra Pound, and William Butler Yeats had the greatest impact. After reading &quot;A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle&quot; by MacDiarmid, MacLean decided to try his hand at extended narrative poetry, resulting in the unfinished &quot;An Cuilthionn&quot;. He was also influenced by the Metaphysical school. However, he disdained the popular left-wing poets of the 1930s, such as W. H. Auden or Stephen Spender, and sometimes regarded poetry as a useless aesthetic hobby.

===&quot;Dàin do Eimhir&quot;===
In 1940, eight of MacLean&#x27;s poems were printed in &quot;17 Poems for 6d&quot;, along with Scots poems by Robert Garioch. The pamphlet sold better than expected and was reprinted a few weeks later; it received favourable reviews. While MacLean was in North Africa, he left his poetry with Douglas Young, who had promised to help publish it. In November 1943, the poems were published as &quot;&quot; (). &quot;Dàin do Eimhir&quot; was a sequence of sixty numbered poems, with twelve missing; of the other poems, the most significant was the long narrative poem &quot;An Cuilthionn&quot;. The book marked a sharp break in style and substance of Gaelic poetry from earlier eras. In his poetry, MacLean emphasized the struggle between love and duty, which was personified in the poet&#x27;s difficulty in choosing between his infatuation with a female figure, Eimhir, and what he sees as his moral obligation to volunteer in the Spanish Civil War.

The book has been the subject of scholarly debate. Attempting to explain why MacLean&#x27;s earlier poetry has had the greatest influence, Derick Thomson wrote that it is love poetry which is most timeless, while MacLean&#x27;s political poetry has not aged as well. According to Maoilios Caimbeul, &quot;There is not, and I doubt there will ever be, a series of love poems&quot; that would have as much influence on Gaelic literature. Ronald Black suggested that &quot;duty [is not]... a comprehensible emotion nowadays&quot; and therefore &quot;the greatest universal in MacLean&#x27;s verse is the depiction of that extraordinary psychosis which is called being in love&quot;. However, this type of commentary has been criticized as an attempt to depoliticize MacLean&#x27;s work. Seamus Heaney argued that Eimhir was similar to Beatrice in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, in that Eimhir &quot;resolves at a symbolic level tensions which would otherwise be uncontainable or wasteful&quot;. Scottish poet Iain Crichton Smith said, &quot;there is a sense in which the Spanish Civil War does not form the background to these poems, but is the protagonist&quot;.

MacLean&#x27;s work was innovative and influential because it juxtaposed elements from Gaelic history and tradition with icons from mainstream European history. He described his poetry as &quot;radiating from Skye and the West Highlands to the whole of Europe&quot;. By this juxtaposition, he implicitly asserted the value of the Gaelic tradition and the right of Gaels to participate as equals in the broader cultural landscape. According to John MacInnes, MacLean put the much-denigrated Gaelic language and tradition in its proper place, which has a profound effect on Gaelic-speaking readers and is fundamental to their reading of his poetry. &quot;An Cuilthionn&quot;, the mountains of Skye are used as a synecdoche for rifts in European politics, and the suffering of the Gaels due to the Highland Clearances is compared to the suffering of European people under Francoism and other fascist regimes. MacLean frequently compared the injustice of the Highland Clearances with modern-day issues; in his opinion, the greed of the wealthy and powerful was responsible for many tragedies and social problems.

The book won him recognition as &quot;the major force in modern Gaelic poetry&quot;, according to &quot;The Cambridge Companion to British Poetry&quot;. Caimbeul writes that the poems &quot;capture the uncertainty, pain, yearning, and the search for stability that are at the heart of Modernism&quot;. Summarizing the impact of the book, Professor Donald MacAulay wrote, &quot;After the publication of this book Gaelic poetry could never be the same again.&quot;

===Recognition===
Although his poetry had a profound impact on the Gaelic-speaking world, it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that MacLean&#x27;s work became accessible in English translation. His poetry was not very accessible to Gaelic speakers either, since &quot;Dàin do Eimhir&quot; was not reprinted. To English-speakers, MacLean remained virtually unknown until 1970, when issue 34 of &quot;Lines Review&quot; was dedicated to his work and some of his poems were reproduced in the anthology &quot;Four Points of the Saltire.&quot; In the preface to the collection, Tom Scott forcefully argued for the merit of MacLean&#x27;s poetry. Iain Crichton Smith published an English translation of &quot;Dàin do Eimhir&quot; in 1971. MacLean was part of the delegation that represented Scotland at the first Cambridge Poetry Festival in 1975, establishing his reputation in England. He was one of five Gaelic poets to be anthologized in the influential 1976 collection &quot;Nua-Bhàrdachd Ghàidhlig / Modern Scottish Gaelic Poems&quot; with verse translations by the authors. MacLean&#x27;s verse translations were also included in later publications.

In 1977, Canongate Books published &quot;Reothairt is Contraigh: Taghadh de Dhàin 1932–72&quot; (). MacLean changed the ordering of the &quot;Dàin do Eimhir&quot; sequence, altering many poems and omitting others. In the original version of &quot;An Cuilthionn&quot;, MacLean had asked the Red Army to invade Scotland. This passage was expunged, among other alterations and omissions that led the Scottish Poetry Library to describe the 1977 version as having been &quot;bowdlerized&quot;. MacLean said that he would only consent to publishing the parts of his older work that he found &quot;tolerable&quot;. The critical acclaim and fame that MacLean achieved was almost entirely from critics who did not understand his poetry in the original Gaelic. In 1989, a further compilation of his poetry, &quot;O Choille gu Bearradh / From Wood to Ridge: Collected Poems in Gaelic and English&quot; won him lasting critical acclaim. Complete annotated editions of his work have since been published.

From the early 1970s, MacLean was in demand internationally as a reader of his own poetry. He would start a reading of a poem by describing the images, then read the poem first in Gaelic and again in English, emphasizing that the translations were not to be read as poems in themselves. His readings were described as deeply moving even by listeners who did not speak Gaelic; according to Seamus Heaney, &quot;MacLean&#x27;s voice had a certain bardic weirdness that sounded both stricken and enraptured&quot;. Gaelic poet George Campbell Hay wrote in a review that MacLean &quot;is gifted with what the Welsh call Hwyl, the power of elevated declamation, and his declamation is full of feeling.&quot; These readings helped establish his international reputation as a poet. MacLean&#x27;s poetry was also translated into German, and he was invited to poetry readings in Germany and Austria.

In the English-speaking world, MacLean&#x27;s best-known poem is &quot;Hallaig&quot;, a meditation on a Raasay village which had been cleared of its inhabitants. Raasay was cleared between 1852 and 1854 under George Rainy; most of its inhabitants were forced to emigrate. Many of MacLean&#x27;s relatives were affected, and Hallaig was one of the villages to be depopulated. The poem was written a century later, during MacLean&#x27;s time in Edinburgh, and originally published in 1954 in the Gaelic-language magazine &quot;Gairm&quot;. Beginning with the famous line, &quot;Time, the deer, is in the wood of Hallaig&quot;, the poem imagines the village as it was before the Clearances, with the long-dead eternally walking through the trees. It is also filled with local names of individuals and places, which have deeper meanings to those intimately familiar with Raasay oral tradition. Unlike most of MacLean&#x27;s output, &quot;Hallaig&quot; has no overt political references, and never directly mentions eviction or clearance. For this reason, it was seen as politically &quot;safer&quot; than others of MacLean&#x27;s poems. Translated and promoted by Irish Nobel Prize Laureate Seamus Heaney, &quot;Hallaig&quot; achieved &quot;cult status&quot; and came to symbolize Scottish Gaelic poetry in the English-speaking imagination.

===Style===

MacLean&#x27;s poetry generally followed an older style of metre, based on the more dynamic patterns of the oral tradition rather than the strict, static metres of the written Gaelic poetry of the nineteenth century. He frequently combined metrical patters and shifted in the middle of a poem, achieving &quot;sensuous effects&quot; that cannot be translated. He typically used the traditional vowel rhymes, both internal and end-rhymes, that are ubiquitous in the oral tradition, but a few of his poems have less traditional rhyme schemes. However, he was flexible in his use of metre, &quot;[combining] old and new in such a way that neither neutralizes each other,&quot; extending rather than repudiating tradition, in a way that is unique in Gaelic poetry. In MacInnes&#x27; analysis, &quot;rhythmic patterns become a vital part of the meaning&quot; of MacLean&#x27;s poetry. Over time, his poems became less strict in their application of rhyme and metre. According to MacInnes, labels such as &quot;classical&quot; and &quot;romantic&quot;, which have been applied respectively to the form and content of MacLean&#x27;s poetry, are misleading because MacLean did not limit himself by those styles. Despite MacLean&#x27;s reliance on the oral tradition, his poetry was not intended to be sung. Although he abandoned the &quot;verbal codes&quot; and intricate symbolism of the Gaelic tradition, MacLean occasionally used outmoded devices, such as the repeating of adjectives.

MacLean&#x27;s poetry frequently used Gaelic themes and references, such as place names, trees, and sea symbolism. A knowledge of that tradition would bring additional interpretations and appreciation to a reading of MacLean&#x27;s poetry. Another important symbol in his work is the face, which represents romantic love.

According to John MacInnes, MacLean&#x27;s poetry &quot;exhibits virtually an entire spectrum of language&quot;. Some of his poetry is transparent to a fluent Gaelic speaker, but the meaning of other poems needs to be untangled. MacLean coined very few neologisms; however, he revived or repurposed many obscure or archaic words. MacLean often said that he had heard these old words in Presbyterian sermons. According to MacInnes and Maoilios Caimbeul, MacLean&#x27;s revival of these old, forgotten Gaelic words revolutionized literary Gaelic, by adding senses and a newness and modernity. Caimbeul wrote that MacLean&#x27;s vocabulary is not &quot;simple&quot;, but it is &quot;natural&quot; and arises naturally from everyday speech, although mixed with other influences.

In contrast, the English translations were all written in a very straightforward style, flattening the language by the necessity to choose one English word for the ambiguity and connotations of the Gaelic one. According to Christopher Whyte, the English translations produce &quot;an official interpretation, one that restricts and deadens the range of possible readings of the poem&quot;. English could not convey the pop that MacLean&#x27;s revival of disused words brought to his Gaelic poetry. While the Gaelic poems were noted for their acoustic properties, the translations did not pay any particular attention to sound, instead focusing narrowly on literal meaning. MacLean emphasized that his &quot;line-by-line translations&quot; were not poetry; of the prose translation of &quot;An Cuilthionn&quot; that appeared in &quot;Dàin do Eimhir&quot;, he wrote, &quot;my English version has not even the merit of very strict literal accuracy as I find more and more when I look over it&quot;. Seamus Heaney called the translations &quot;&quot;.

==Awards and honours==
In June 1987, MacLean became the first freeman of Skye and Lochalsh. He received seven honorary degrees. Twice, he was the honorary head of the Gaelic Society of Inverness, in 1970 and 1982; he was made honorary president of the Saltire Society in 1985. In 1989, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. The next year, he was named the first University of Edinburgh Alumnus of the Year, and awarded a Queen&#x27;s Gold Medal for Poetry. &quot;O Choille gu Bearradh&quot; was the Saltire Society Scottish Book of the Year for 1990, and MacLean won the McVitie&#x27;s Prize for Scottish Writer of the Year. He became a Fellow of the Educational Institute of Scotland in 1991, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1992, an honorary fellow of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland in 1996, and an honorary Royal Scottish Academician the same year. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1992; it has been suggested that he might have won if he had not written in such a marginalized language. MacLean is commemorated by a stone in Makars&#x27; Court, outside the Writers&#x27; Museum, Lawnmarket, Edinburgh, unveiled in 1998 by Iain Crichton Smith.

==Legacy==
Hugh MacDiarmid wrote a letter to MacLean in 1977, a year before his death, stating that he and MacLean were the best Scottish poets of the twentieth century. MacDiarmid and MacLean influenced each other&#x27;s work and maintained an extensive correspondence which has been published. Douglas Young wrote that &quot;the best poetry written in our generation in the British Isles has been in Scottish Gaelic, by Sorley MacLean.&quot; John MacInnes called him a &quot;magisterial writer&quot; who &quot;[pushed] Gaelic to its limits&quot;. He said that it is &quot;truly astonishing&quot; that Gaelic, so long minoritized, could have produced a writer like MacLean, who could not express what he had to say in any other language: &quot;Somhairle MacGill-Eain needed Gaelic, and Gaelic needed Somhairle MacGill-Eain&quot;. According to Iain Crichton Smith, translator of MacLean&#x27;s poetry, &quot;Dàin do Eimhir&quot; was &quot;the greatest Gaelic book of this century&quot;, an assessment with which Christopher Whyte agreed. According to Maoilios Caimbeul, MacLean was the best Scottish Gaelic poet of all time. Smith compared the calibre of MacLean&#x27;s love poetry to that of Catallus and William Butler Yeats. Nobel Prize Laureate Seamus Heaney said that MacLean had &quot;saved Gaelic poetry... for all time&quot;.

While acknowledging the literary merit of MacLean&#x27;s work, Whyte suggested that it was unfortunate that in the 1980s it stood in for all Scottish Gaelic poetry in the Anglophone world. According to Whyte, MacLean&#x27;s poetry is &quot;comparatively unGaelic, elitist rather than populist, and permeable only with difficulty to the community which uses the language in its day to day existence&quot;. MacInnes concedes that MacLean does not cater to his readers; however, in his opinion it would be incorrect to call the poetry elitist because of its &quot;artistic sincerity&quot;, speaking &quot;with affective directness and a simple passionate intensity&quot;. Compounding the difficulty is that the traditional medium of Gaelic poetry is song, and many fluent speakers do not have strong reading skills. In an effort to make MacLean&#x27;s work more accessible to Scottish Gaelic speakers, the Sorley MacLean Trust commissioned several musicians to set some of MacLean&#x27;s poems to music.

In the Gaelic-speaking world, MacLean&#x27;s influence has been pervasive and persistent. Poet Aonghas MacNeacail started writing in English, because &quot;My education gave me to believe that Gaelic literature was dead&quot;; he credited MacLean with convincing him otherwise and inspiring him to write in Gaelic. The Gaelic rock band Runrig once invited MacLean to come onstage for a poetry reading. However, MacLean had less impact on rural Gaelic-speaking communities. Novelist Angus Peter Campbell wrote that he preferred the work of local Uist bards to MacLean, and he believed that other Uist people felt the same. Australian poet Les Murray acknowledged MacLean&#x27;s influence on his work.

A film, &quot;Hallaig&quot;, was made in 1984 by Timothy Neat, including a discussion by MacLean of the dominant influences on his poetry, with commentary by Smith and Heaney, and substantial passages from the poem and other work, along with extracts of Gaelic song. The poem also forms part of the lyrics of Peter Maxwell Davies&#x27; opera &quot;The Jacobite Rising&quot;; and MacLean&#x27;s own reading of it in English and in Gaelic was sampled by Martyn Bennett in his album &quot;Bothy Culture&quot; for a track of the same name.

A controversy erupted in 2000, when John MacLeod, chief of Clan MacLeod, put the Black Cuillin mountain range of Skye on the market in order to finance the repair of Dunvegan Castle. His real estate agency, Savills, used excerpts from &quot;An Cuilthionn&quot; to advertise the property. Many people found this to be an inappropriate use of MacLean&#x27;s work. Savills apologized unreservedly, which was accepted by Renee MacLean.

<text>Jomo Kenyatta International Airport is an international airport serving Nairobi, the capital and largest city of Kenya. The other three important international airports in Kenya include Kisumu International Airport, Moi International Airport and Eldoret International Airport. Located in the Embakasi suburb southeast of Nairobi&#x27;s central business district, the airport has scheduled flights to destinations in over 50 countries. Originally named Embakasi Airport, the airport&#x27;s name was changed in 1978 to honour Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya&#x27;s first president and Prime Minister. The airport served over 7 million passengers in 2016, making it the seventh busiest airport in passenger traffic on the continent.

The postal code for Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) is 00501.

==History==
===1950s and 1960s===

Discussions about building the airport date back to 1945. At that time, the colonial power—Britain—and its national airline, BOAC, were worried that the existing airport at Eastleigh was inadequate for post-War civilian airliners. The costs of improving Eastleigh versus developing a new airport occupied planners for eight years. Who would pay was a major issue.

Plans for the airport were drawn up in 1953, work started in January 1954, and by mid-1957 it was found possible to bring the operational date forward to mid-March 1958. The task was by no means straightforward, and many problems —largely of a civil engineering nature—had to be overcome before the runway could be built. An extensive amount of the airport&#x27;s construction was done utilizing forced labour, many of whom were suspected of being Mau Mau members. Due to the enormous pressure to finish the airport and the high amount of labour necessary, it was not uncommon to work the labourers to the point where some of them died of exhaustion. The working conditions were so poor that were reports of suicides and self-mutilation among the labourers. The site chosen, on a lava plain from the centre of Nairobi (the city&#x27;s two other airports, Eastleigh and Wilson, are closer), has approaches free from any obstruction for at least in any direction. The nearest mountain (&quot;high ground&quot;) would be a misnomer when Embakasi itself is AMSL), away, and 10 degrees off the runway centre-line. Visibility rarely falls below this obstruction-distance in the clear air of the plains, and it may have been possible to see the summit of Mount Meru in Northern Tanzania, about away; both Kilimanjaro away and Mount Kenya could be clearly seen.

On Sunday 9 March 1958, &quot;Embakasi Airport&quot; (now JKIA) was opened by the last colonial governor of Kenya, Sir Evelyn Baring. The airport was due to be opened by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother; however, she was delayed in Australia due to an engine failure on her Qantas Lockheed Super Constellation aircraft. Due to this, the Queen was unable to attend the ceremony.

The runway at the then Embakasi Airport was a big improvement on Eastleigh&#x27;s murram runway, which in the rainy months was unsuitable for Britannias. The runway was long between thresholds, and was sited roughly 06–24. The 06 approach was used on 90 per cent of the time. A basic strip long and wide was prepared for the wide runway. There were shoulders each side; and consequently run-offs beyond the shoulders. After cambering, weak spots were reset, and finally paving machinery was used to lay the asphalt surface. The result was an engineering success of which the contractors were very proud; so accurate was the cambering that the wet surface of the runway dried out evenly on each side of the centre-line. Physically, the great care taken in the engineering resulted in a load classification number of 100 being achieved. The surface at the time was strong enough to accept the Boeing 707 at maximum gross weight, although rather than length was the probable all-weather length requirement. There was no physical limit to extending the paved length to this figure, but more definite plans for the operation of the big jets into Kenya was required before such an increase was contemplated.

At the time in 1958, Nairobi was one of the few towns in the world that could boast of a 1965 airport with an expansion option at hand. The number of aircraft movements then was less than 600 per month. The airport architect was strongly influenced by the design of Kloten, Zurich, in the planning and design of Embakasi, although similarities were by no means obvious. Both airports are arranged so that arrival passengers can see completely through the building; the minimum of signs is required. And although Embakasi was designed to meet Nairobi&#x27;s particular needs, both airports shared a lightness and spaciousness that was at the time extraordinarily refreshing. The fitting and colour schemes employed at the then Embakasi Airport were first-class.

===1970s, 1980s and 1990s===
In 1972, the World Bank approved funds for further expansion of the airport, including a new international and domestic passenger terminal building, the airport&#x27;s first dedicated cargo and freight terminal, new taxiways, associated aprons, internal roads, car parks, police and fire stations, a State Pavilion, airfield and roadway lighting, fire hydrant system, water, electrical, telecommunications and sewage systems, a dual carriageway passenger access road, security, drainage and the building of the main access road to the airport (Airport South Road). The total cost of the project was over US$29 million (US$111.8 million in 2013 dollars). On 14 March 1978, construction of the current terminal building was completed on the other side of the airport&#x27;s single runway and opened by President Kenyatta. The airport was again renamed, this time in honour of President Kenyatta after his death about five months later on 22 August 1978.

In October 1994, a British Airways Concorde landed at the airport for purposes of testing the aircraft&#x27;s performance at high altitude.

===2000–present===
On 10 June 2008, Kenya Vision 2030 was launched by President Mwai Kibaki. Under the vision, JKIA&#x27;s aging infrastructure was to be upgraded to World Class standards. New terminals and runway upgrades were to be added in phases. The African Development Bank carried out an Environmental Impact Assessment on the development of Phase 1 of the proposed Green Field Terminal (GFT) which was expected to increase the capacity of JKIA to about 18.5 million passengers annually by the year 2030. The Greenfield Terminal project was to encompass the construction of a four level terminal building comprising a central processing area, a transit hotel, landside retail centers, arrivals and departures plaza. Ancillary facilities which would have included an access road, car parking, access taxiways, Ground Service Equipment (GSE) and bus parking areas.

On 29 March 2016, the KES 56 billion (US$560 million) Greenfield Terminal Project was terminated by Kenya Airports Authority because the contractor failed to secure funds, thus ending Kenya&#x27;s vision of having the largest terminal in Africa.

In February 2017, the airport was awarded a Category One Status by the Federal Aviation Administration of the United States, thus allowing possible direct flights between the US and Nairobi. Five other African countries have direct flights to the US (South Africa, Ethiopia, Egypt, Morocco, and Cabo Verde).

===2013 fire===

On 7 August 2013, a fire originating in the immigration area caused massive damage to the airport and forced it to suspend operations temporarily. Unit 3, usually dedicated to domestic operations, was used temporarily for international traffic. The worst fire in the airport&#x27;s history occurred on the fifteenth anniversary of the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, but no connection was immediately obvious and no terrorist group has claimed responsibility. The cause is not believed to be intentional, as no explosive devices were discovered during the initial investigation. According to Kenyan officials, firefighting efforts were hampered by some of the first responders choosing to loot the airport instead of fighting the blaze. International arrivals had been bused to a temporary facility set up in the ground floor of the new parkade until the reconstruction of the damaged areas. In June 2015, a new, fully functional temporary terminal building became operational. This terminal building was planned for a design life of 10 years, until completion of the planned new permanent facility.

===2024 strike===
On 11 September 2024, a strike was held by airport workers against proposals to lease the facility to the Adani Group of India for 30 years. The Law Society of Kenya and the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights also criticised the proposal, citing the airport being a &quot;strategic national asset&quot;. The two groups also filed petitions in the High Court against the proposal, which led to it being suspended pending a final decision.

==Facilities==

===Terminals===

There are two terminals. Terminal 1 is arranged in a semi-circular orientation and is divided into four parts: 1A, 1B, 1C, and 1E are used for international arrivals and departures while terminal 1D is used for domestic departures and arrivals. Terminal 2 is used by low-cost carriers. The original terminal, located on the north side of the runway, is used by the Kenya Air Force and is sometimes referred to as &quot;Old Embakasi Airport&quot;.

Figures from KAA indicate that the airport&#x27;s Terminal 1-A has a capacity of 2.5 million passengers The Kenyan government is targeting over 25 million passengers annually by 2025 on the expansion of JKIA&#x27;s terminals. In 2016, JKIA accounted for more than 70 per cent of overall passenger traffic in the country. It also had over 7 million passengers pass through it. Domestic travellers through the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) made up 40% cent of overall passengers in 2016. This is an increase from 32% five years prior (2012).

====Terminal 1A: International departures and arrivals====
Terminal 1A has a capacity of 2.5 million passengers a year and three levels, 30 check-in counters, 12 departure gates, ample seating, and food and retail options. The arrivals area houses five baggage carousels. This terminal is used primarily by Skyteam member airlines.

====Terminal 1B: International departures====
Terminal 1B houses common-use check-in counters, with security check points leading to the departure lounge on level 1. On level one is the Aspire lounge as well as duty-free shopping outlets and cafes.

====Terminal 1C: International departures====
This terminal houses common-use check-in counters, with security checkpoints leading to the departure lounge on level 1. On level 1 are duty-free shops, Kenya Airways Simba Lounge and the Turkish Airlines Lounge and a cafe.

====Terminal 1D: Domestic flights====
This terminal serves departing and arriving passengers on domestic flights. It is occupied only by Kenya Airways and its subsidiary, Jambojet.

====Terminal 1E: International arrivals====
Following the closure of the main international arrivals and departures terminal after a fire, a parking facility was converted into the temporary international arrivals terminal.

This terminal was subsequently opened to serve arriving passengers on airlines operating out of Terminals 1B and 1C.

Remodeling and extending Terminals 1B, 1C and 1D was scheduled for 2017, after which JKIA was predicted to be able to handle 12 million passengers.

====Terminal 2: Low-cost carriers====
This terminal serves mainly low-cost carrier airlines (LCCs). The prefabricated terminal opened in April 2015 with a capacity of 2.5M passengers. It was originally intended to relieve overcrowding. Terminal 2 houses international and domestic check-in desks and boarding gates. Current lounges at Terminal 2 include the Mara Lounge and Mount Kenya Lounge, both at airside, Level 1, and open 24 hours.

====Terminal 3====
Terminal 3, also referred to as the &quot;Greenfield Terminal&quot;, is a projected new terminal building with a capacity of 20 million passengers per year. Construction first began in 2014, but was cancelled in 2016.

With passenger numbers at the airport nearing the capacity limit, Roads, Transport, and Public Works Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen announced in 2023 that the President William Ruto&#x27;s government would resume the project in 2024 as a public-private partnership (PPP) with an expected completion in 2027.

===Lounges===
In January 2015, the Simba Lounge and Pride Lounge on the second floor of Terminal 1A were opened. The two facilities, with a combined capacity of 350 people, were developed at a cost of KES 135 million ($1.35 million), and are for the use of KQ&#x27;s Premier World and SkyTeam&#x27;s Sky Priority passengers. There is also a Turkish Airlines TAV Lounge (T1B), as well as the Swissport Aspire Lounge (T1C). Both are regular lounges, which can be accessed by elite status or a paid-pass.

===Second runway===
In January 2017, a new instrument landing system-equipped runway in length was approved for construction at a cost of KES 37 billion shillings (approximately US$370 million). According to KAA&#x27;s managing director John Anderson, construction of the new runway (which will be bigger than the existing one) was scheduled to begin in 2017. It would have doubled aircraft movement from 25 to 45 per hour. The new runway was designed as a category 2 runway and would have complemented the older runway built in the 1970s. The proposed design of the project was a long and wide runway. The current runway is wide and long. This is an ICAO code F which can handle the new generation wide bodied aircraft like the Airbus A380 and the Boeing 747-8. The new runway was designed with fog lights, whereas the current runway is only lit at the sides. The runway would also have enabled long haul flights to destinations like New York city carrying up to 32 tonnes of passengers and cargo. In 2019, however, the government signaled that this project was no longer a priority.

==Early life==

Lucy Liu was born in the Jackson Heights neighborhood of the New York City borough of Queens. In high school, she adopted a middle name, Alexis. She is the youngest of three children born to Cecilia, who worked as a biochemist, and Tom Liu, a civil engineer who sold digital clock pens. Liu&#x27;s parents originally came from Beijing and Shanghai and immigrated to Taiwan as adults before meeting in New York. She has an older brother, John, and an older sister, Jenny. Her parents had many jobs while Lucy and her siblings were growing up.

Liu has stated that she grew up in a diverse neighborhood. She learned to speak Mandarin at home and began studying English when she was five. She studied the martial art &quot;kali-eskrima-silat&quot; as a hobby when she was young. Liu attended Joseph Pulitzer Middle School (I.S.145), and graduated from Stuyvesant High School. She later enrolled at New York University and transferred to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where she was a member of the Chi Omega sorority and studied Asian languages and cultures.

==Career==

Liu became interested in acting as a child, after hearing about someone her own age who had been in a television commercial. At the age of 19 she was discovered by an agent while traveling on the subway, and appeared in one commercial as a result. As a member of the Basement Arts student-run theater group, she auditioned in 1989 for the University of Michigan&#x27;s production of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; during her senior year of college. Although she had originally tried out for only a supporting role, Liu was cast in the lead. While in line to audition for the musical &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; in 1990, she told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;There aren&#x27;t many Asian roles, and it&#x27;s very difficult to get your foot in the door.&quot; In May 1992, Liu made her New York stage debut in &quot;Fairy Bones&quot;, directed by Tina Chen.

Liu had small roles in films and TV, marking her debut. In 1992, she made her big-screen debut in the Hong Kong film &quot;Rhythm of Destiny&quot;, which starred Danny Lee and Aaron Kwok. In 1993, she appeared in an episode of &quot;L.A. Law&quot; as a Chinese widow giving her evidence in Mandarin. Liu co-starred on the Rhea Perlman sitcom &quot;Pearl&quot;, which lasted one season. Shortly after the end of &quot;Pearl&#x27;s&quot; run in 1997, Liu was cast in a role on &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;. Liu originally auditioned for the role of Nelle Porter (played by Portia de Rossi), and the character Ling Woo was later created specifically for her. Liu&#x27;s part on the series was originally temporary, but high audience ratings secured Liu as a permanent cast member. Additionally, she earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series.

Liu has been vegetarian since childhood. Liu has studied various religions, mainly Buddhism and Taoism, and briefly Kabbalah. She has stated, &quot;I&#x27;m into all things spiritual—anything to do with meditation or chants or any of that stuff. I studied Chinese philosophy in school. There&#x27;s something in the metaphysical that I find very fascinating.&quot; She has been a member of the Chinese-American organization Committee of 100 since 2004.

She has a son, Rockwell, who was born in 2015 via gestational surrogate.

She was involved in Tylenol&#x27;s #HowWeFamily Mother&#x27;s Day Campaign, which celebrated non-traditional families.

===Health===
In 1991, Liu had surgery after a breast cancer scare. She said: &quot;The doctor sort of felt and said it was cancer and it needs to come out. I went into shell-shock. It was pretty traumatizing.&quot; The lump was removed two days after the doctor&#x27;s examination and was found to be benign.

<text>Peritonitis is inflammation of the localized or generalized peritoneum, the lining of the inner wall of the abdomen and cover of the abdominal organs. Symptoms may include severe pain, swelling of the abdomen, fever, or weight loss. One part or the entire abdomen may be tender. Complications may include shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Causes include perforation of the intestinal tract, pancreatitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, stomach ulcer, cirrhosis, a ruptured appendix or even a perforated gallbladder. Risk factors include ascites (the abnormal build-up of fluid in the abdomen) and peritoneal dialysis. Diagnosis is generally based on examination, blood tests, and medical imaging.
Treatment often includes antibiotics, intravenous fluids, pain medication, and surgery. Other measures may include a nasogastric tube or blood transfusion. Without treatment death may occur within a few days. About 20% of people with cirrhosis who are hospitalized have peritonitis.

==Signs and symptoms==
===Abdominal pain===
The main manifestations of peritonitis are acute abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, abdominal guarding, rigidity, which are exacerbated by moving the peritoneum, e.g., coughing (forced cough may be used as a test), flexing one&#x27;s hips, or eliciting the Blumberg&#x27;s sign (meaning that pressing a hand on the abdomen elicits less pain than releasing the hand abruptly, which will aggravate the pain, as the peritoneum snaps back into place). Rigidity is highly specific for diagnosing peritonitis (specificity: 76–100%). The presence of these signs in a person is sometimes referred to as peritonism. The localization of these manifestations depends on whether peritonitis is localized (e.g., appendicitis or diverticulitis before perforation), or generalized to the whole abdomen. In either case, pain typically starts as a generalized abdominal pain (with involvement of poorly localizing visceral innervation of the visceral peritoneal layer), and may become localized later (with involvement of the somatic innervation of the parietal peritoneal layer). Peritonitis is an example of an acute abdomen.

===Other symptoms===
* Diffuse abdominal rigidity (abdominal guarding) is often present, especially in generalized peritonitis
* Fever
* Sinus tachycardia
* Development of ileus paralyticus (i.e., intestinal paralysis), which also causes nausea, vomiting and bloating
* Reduced or no passage of abdominal gas and bowel sound

===Complications===
* Sequestration of fluid and electrolytes, as revealed by decreased central venous pressure, may cause electrolyte disturbances, as well as significant hypovolemia, possibly leading to shock and acute kidney failure.
* A peritoneal abscess may form (e.g., above or below the liver, or in the lesser omentum)
* Sepsis may develop, so blood cultures should be obtained.
* Complicated peritonitis typically involves multiple organs.

==Causes==
===Infection===
* Perforation of part of the gastrointestinal tract is the most common cause of peritonitis. Examples include perforation of the distal esophagus (Boerhaave syndrome), of the stomach (peptic ulcer, gastric carcinoma), of the duodenum (peptic ulcer), of the remaining intestine (e.g., appendicitis, diverticulitis, Meckel diverticulum, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), intestinal infarction, intestinal strangulation, colorectal carcinoma, meconium peritonitis), or of the gallbladder (cholecystitis). Other possible reasons for perforation include abdominal trauma, ingestion of a sharp foreign body (such as a fish bone, toothpick or glass shard), perforation by an endoscope or catheter, and anastomotic leakage. The latter occurrence is particularly difficult to diagnose early, as abdominal pain and ileus paralyticus are considered normal in people who have just undergone abdominal surgery. In most cases of perforation of a hollow viscus, mixed bacteria are isolated; the most common agents include Gram-negative bacilli (e.g., &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;) and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., &quot;Bacteroides fragilis&quot;). Faecal peritonitis results from the presence of faeces in the peritoneal cavity. It can result from abdominal trauma and occurs if the large bowel is perforated during surgery.
* Disruption of the peritoneum, even in the absence of perforation of a hollow viscus, may also cause infection simply by letting micro-organisms into the peritoneal cavity. Examples include trauma, surgical wound, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, and intra-peritoneal chemotherapy. Again, in most cases, mixed bacteria are isolated; the most common agents include cutaneous species such as &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, and coagulase-negative staphylococci, but many others are possible, including fungi such as &quot;Candida&quot;.
* Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a peculiar form of peritonitis occurring in the absence of an obvious source of contamination. It occurs in people with ascites, including children.
* Intra-peritoneal dialysis predisposes to peritoneal infection (sometimes named &quot;primary peritonitis&quot; in this context).
* Systemic infections (such as tuberculosis) may rarely have a peritoneal localisation.
* Pelvic inflammatory disease

===Non-infection===
* Leakage of sterile body fluids into the peritoneum, such as blood (e.g., endometriosis, blunt abdominal trauma), gastric juice (e.g., peptic ulcer, gastric carcinoma), bile (e.g., liver biopsy), urine (pelvic trauma), menstruum (e.g., salpingitis), pancreatic juice (pancreatitis), or even the contents of a ruptured dermoid cyst. While these body fluids are sterile at first, they frequently become infected once they leak out of their organ, leading to infectious peritonitis within 24 to 48 hours.
* Sterile abdominal surgery, under normal circumstances, causes localised or minimal generalised peritonitis, which may leave behind a foreign body reaction or fibrotic adhesions. However, peritonitis may also be caused by the rare case of a sterile foreign body inadvertently left in the abdomen after surgery (e.g., gauze, sponge).
* Much rarer non-infectious causes may include familial Mediterranean fever, TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome, porphyria, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

===Risk factors===
* Previous history of peritonitis
* History of alcoholism
* Liver disease
* Fluid accumulation in the abdomen
* Weakened immune system
* Pelvic inflammatory disease

==Diagnosis==
A diagnosis of peritonitis is based primarily on the clinical manifestations described above. Rigidity (involuntary contraction of the abdominal muscles) is the most specific exam finding for diagnosing peritonitis. If focal peritonitis is detected, further work-up should be done. If diffuse peritonitis is detected, then urgent surgical consultation should be obtained, and may warrant surgery without further investigations. Leukocytosis, hypokalemia, hypernatremia, and acidosis may be present, but they are not specific findings. Abdominal X-rays may reveal dilated, edematous intestines, although such X-rays are mainly useful to look for pneumoperitoneum, an indicator of gastrointestinal perforation. The role of whole-abdomen ultrasound examination is under study and is likely to expand in the future. Computed tomography (CT or CAT scanning) may be useful in differentiating causes of abdominal pain. If reasonable doubt still persists, an exploratory peritoneal lavage or laparoscopy may be performed. In people with ascites, a diagnosis of peritonitis is made via paracentesis (abdominal tap): More than 250 polymorphonuclear cells per μL is considered diagnostic. In addition, Gram stain is almost always negative, whereas culture of the peritoneal fluid can determine the microorganism responsible and determine their sensitivity to antimicrobial agents.

===Pathology===
In normal conditions, the peritoneum appears greyish and glistening; it becomes dull 2–4 hours after the onset of peritonitis, initially with scarce serous or slightly turbid fluid. Later on, the exudate becomes creamy and evidently suppurative; in people who are dehydrated, it also becomes very inspissated. The quantity of accumulated exudate varies widely. It may be spread to the whole peritoneum, or be walled off by the omentum and viscera. Inflammation features infiltration by neutrophils with fibrino-purulent exudation.

==Treatment==
Depending on the severity of the person&#x27;s state, the management of peritonitis may include:
* Antibiotics are usually administered intravenously, but they may also be infused directly into the peritoneum. The empiric choice of broad-spectrum antibiotics often consist of multiple drugs, and should be targeted against the most likely agents, depending on the cause of peritonitis (see above); once one or more agents grow in cultures isolated, therapy will be targeted against them.
* Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms must be covered. Out of the cephalosporins, cefoxitin and cefotetan can be used to cover Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and anaerobic bacteria. Beta-lactams with beta-lactamase inhibitors can also be used; examples include ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ticarcillin/clavulanate. Carbapenems are also an option when treating primary peritonitis as all of the carbapenems cover Gram-positives, Gram-negatives, and anaerobes except for ertapenem. The only fluoroquinolone that can be used is moxifloxacin because this is the only fluoroquinolone that covers anaerobes. Tigecycline is a tetracycline that can be used due to its coverage of Gram-positives and Gram-negatives. Empiric therapy will often require multiple drugs from different classes.
* Surgery (laparotomy) is needed to perform a full exploration and lavage of the peritoneum, as well as to correct any gross anatomical damage that may have caused peritonitis. The exception is spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which does not always benefit from surgery and may be treated with antibiotics in the first instance.

==Prognosis==
If properly treated, typical cases of surgically correctable peritonitis (e.g., perforated peptic ulcer, appendicitis, and diverticulitis) have a mortality rate of about &lt;10% in otherwise healthy people. The mortality rate rises to 35% in peritonitis patients who develop sepsis, and patients who have underlying renal insufficiency and complications have a higher mortality rate.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;peritonitis&quot; comes from Greek περιτόναιον &quot;peritonaion&quot; &quot;peritoneum, abdominal membrane&quot; and -itis &quot;inflammation&quot;.

<doc id="142550" wikidata="Q234891" url="?curid=142550" title="Yo-Yo Ma">
<text>Yo-Yo Ma (born October 7, 1955) is a French-American cellist. Born to Chinese parents in Paris, he was regarded as a child prodigy there and began to study the cello with his father at age four. At the age of seven, Ma moved with his family to Boston and later to New York City, where he continued his cello studies at the Juilliard School before pursuing a liberal arts education at Harvard University. He has performed as a soloist with orchestras around the world, recorded more than 92 albums, and received 19 Grammy Awards.

In addition to recordings of the standard classical repertoire, Ma has recorded a wide variety of folk music, such as American bluegrass music, traditional Chinese melodies, the tangos of Argentine composer Astor Piazzolla, and Brazilian music. He has also collaborated with artists from a diverse range of genres, including Bobby McFerrin, Carlos Santana, Chris Botti, Diana Krall, James Taylor, Miley Cyrus, Zakir Hussain, and Sting.

Ma has been a United Nations Messenger of Peace since 2006. He has received numerous awards, including the Avery Fisher Prize in 1978, The Glenn Gould Prize in 1999, the National Medal of Arts in 2001, the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011, Kennedy Center Honors in 2011, the Polar Music Prize in 2012, and the Birgit Nilsson Prize in 2022. He was named as one of &quot;Time&quot;″s 100 Most Influential People of 2020.

Ma&#x27;s primary performance instrument is the &quot;Davidov&quot; cello, made in 1712 by Antonio Stradivari.

==Early life and education==
Ma&#x27;s mother, Marina Lu, was a singer, and his father, Hiao-Tsiun Ma, was a violinist, composer and professor of music at Nanjing National Central University (now relocated in Taoyuan, Taiwan; predecessor of the present-day Nanjing University and Southeast University). They both migrated from the Republic of China to France during the Chinese Civil War. Ma&#x27;s sister, Ya tong sang, played the viola and piano professionally before obtaining a medical degree from Harvard and becoming a pediatrician. The family moved to Boston when Ma was seven.

From the age of three, Ma played the drums, violin, piano, and later viola, but settled on the cello in 1960 at age four. When three-year-old Yo-Yo said he wanted a big instrument, his father went to see Etienne Vatelot, a foremost violin maker in Paris who, after a chat, lent him a 1/16th cello. He jokes that his first choice was the double bass due to its large size, but he compromised and took up the cello instead. While Hiao-Tsiun handled much of his son&#x27;s early music education, he eventually conceded that Yo-Yo required a more skilled teacher, and signed his son up for cello lessons with the renowned Mme Michelle Lepinte. He began performing before audiences at age five and played for presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy when he was seven. At age eight, he appeared on American television with his sister in an event introduced by Leonard Bernstein. In 1964, Isaac Stern introduced them on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, and they performed the Sonata of Sammartini. After moving to New York, Ma enrolled at the Juilliard School, where he studied under renowned cellist Leonard Rose, and attended Trinity School in New York but transferred to the Professional Children&#x27;s School, where he graduated at age 15. He appeared as a soloist with the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra in a performance of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Rococo Variations&quot;.

Ma attended Columbia University, but dropped out. He later enrolled at Harvard College. Prior to entering Harvard, Ma played in the Marlboro Festival Orchestra under the direction of cellist, conductor and Ma&#x27;s childhood hero Pablo Casals. He spent four summers at the Marlboro Music Festival after meeting and falling in love with Mount Holyoke College sophomore and festival administrator Jill Hornor during his first summer there in 1972.

Even before that time, Ma gained fame and performed with many of the world&#x27;s major orchestras. He has also played chamber music, often with pianist Emanuel Ax, with whom he has a close friendship from their days at Juilliard. Ma received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in anthropology from Harvard in 1976, and in 1991 received an honorary doctorate from Harvard.

==Career==

In 1997, Ma was featured on John Williams&#x27;s soundtrack to the Hollywood film &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot;. In 2000, he was heard on the soundtrack of &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;, and of &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot; in 2003. He collaborated with Williams again on the score for the 2005 film &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;. He has also worked with Italian composer Ennio Morricone and has recorded Morricone&#x27;s compositions of the Dollars Trilogy, including &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&quot;, as well as &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;, &quot;The Mission&quot;, and &quot;The Untouchables&quot;. He has recorded over 90 albums, 19 of which are Grammy Award winners. He received the Award of Excellence from New York&#x27;s International Center.

In addition to his prolific musical career, Ma collaborated in 1999 with landscape architects to design a Bach-inspired garden. Known as the Music Garden, it interprets Bach&#x27;s Suite No. 1 in G Major for unaccompanied cello (BWV 1007), where the garden&#x27;s sections were designed to correspond with the suite&#x27;s dance movements. Toronto enthusiastically embraced the design, originally planned for Boston, and it was subsequently built in the Harbourfront neighborhood.

Ma was named Peace Ambassador by then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan in January 2006. He is a founding member of the influential Chinese-American Committee of 100, which addresses the concerns of Americans of Chinese heritage.
On November 3, 2009, President Barack Obama appointed Ma to serve on the President&#x27;s Committee on the Arts and Humanities. His music was featured in the 2010 documentary &quot;Jews and Baseball: An American Love Story&quot;, narrated by Academy Award winner Dustin Hoffman. In 2010, President Obama announced that he would recognize Ma with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which Ma received in February 2011.

In 2010, Ma was named Judson and Joyce Green Creative Consultant of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He launched the Citizen Musician initiative partnership in partnership with the orchestra&#x27;s music director, Riccardo Muti. Also in 2010, he appeared on a solo album by guitarist Carlos Santana, &quot;Guitar Heaven: The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time&quot;, playing alongside Santana and singer India Arie on a Beatles classic, &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;.

In 2015, Ma performed with singer-songwriter and guitarist James Taylor on three tracks of Taylor&#x27;s chart-topping album Before This World: &quot;You And I Again&quot;. In 2019, Ma directed the orchestra at the annual Youth Music Culture Guangdong. Ma is represented by the independent artist management firm Opus 3 Artists. Ma contributed to the charity tribute album &quot;The Metallica Blacklist&quot;, released in September 2021, backing Miley Cyrus on a cover of the Metallica song &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;.

Ma serves on the Board of Trustees of the World Economic Forum.

===Silk Road Ensemble===

Ma formed his own collective, the Silk Road Ensemble, named after the route across Asia which for more than 2,000 years was used for trade between Europe and China. His goal was to bring together musicians from diverse countries that were historically linked via the Silk Road. The ensemble&#x27;s recordings are issued on the Sony Classical label. He also founded the Silk Road Connect, an educational pilot program for children from middle schools in the United States, including New York City.

==Playing style==
Yo-Yo Ma has been referred to by critics as &quot;omnivorous&quot; and possesses an eclectic repertoire. In addition to numerous recordings of the standard classical repertoire, he has recorded Baroque pieces using period instruments; American bluegrass music; traditional Chinese melodies, including the soundtrack to the film &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;; the tangos of Argentinian composer Astor Piazzolla; Brazilian music, recording traditional and contemporary songs composed by Antônio Carlos Jobim and Pixinguinha; a collaboration with Bobby McFerrin (where Ma admitted to being terrified by McFerrin&#x27;s improvisation); and the music of modern minimalist Philip Glass, in such works as the 2002 &quot;Naqoyqatsi&quot;.

Ma is known for his smooth, rich tone, soulful lyricism, and virtuosity. He released a cello recording of Niccolò Paganini&#x27;s Caprice No. 24 for solo violin and Zoltán Kodály&#x27;s Solo Sonata.

==Instruments==
Ma&#x27;s primary performance instrument is the &quot;Davidov&quot; cello, made in 1712 by Antonio Stradivari. It was previously owned by Jacqueline du Pré, who bequeathed it to him. Du Pré voiced her frustration with the cello&#x27;s &quot;unpredictability&quot;, but Ma attributed du Pré&#x27;s sentiment to her impassioned style of playing, adding that the Stradivarius cello must be &quot;coaxed&quot; by the player. Prior to the &quot;Davidov&quot;, he performed on a 1722 Matteo Gofriller cello which he used for much of his early career. The instrument was previously in the possession of the French cellist Pierre Fournier.

Ma also plays on a 1733 Domenico Montagnana cello, named the &quot;Petunia&quot;. In 2005, it was valued at US$2.5 million (US$ million in prices). A student approached Ma after one of his classes in Salt Lake City and asked if the cello had a nickname. Ma replied, &quot;No, but if I play for you, will you name it?&quot; The student chose Petunia, and it stuck. In 1999, Ma inadvertently left the cello in a taxicab in New York City, but it was quickly returned undamaged. That year, when its neck was damaged during X-ray baggage inspection, he borrowed the &quot;Pawle Stradivarius&quot; cello from the Chimei Museum for a concert in Taiwan. The damage was repaired in time, but Ma played both &quot;Petunia&quot; and &quot;Pawle&quot; in the concert nonetheless.

Ma also owns a modern cello made by Peter and Wendela Moes of Warrenton, Virginia, one of carbon fiber by the Luis and Clark company of Boston, and a Samuel Zygmuntowicz cello. According to Zygmuntowicz, he &quot;wants to give (Ma) a reason to leave his Montagnana at home.&quot;

==Notable performances==
 On July 5, 1986, Ma performed in the New York Philharmonic&#x27;s tribute to the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty, which was televised live on ABC Television. The orchestra, with conductor Zubin Mehta, performed in Central Park.

Ma performed a duet with Condoleezza Rice at the presentation of the 2001 National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal Awards. He was the first performer on September 11, 2002, at the site of the World Trade Center, while the first of the names of the dead were read on the first anniversary of the attack on the WTC; he played the Sarabande from Bach&#x27;s &quot;Cello Suite #5 in C Minor&quot;. He performed a special arrangement of Sting&#x27;s &quot;Fragile&quot; with Sting and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in the opening ceremonies of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. He also appeared as a &quot;Pennington Great Performers&quot; series artist with the Baton Rouge Symphony Orchestra in 2005.

He performed John Williams&#x27;s &quot;Air and Simple Gifts&quot; at the first inauguration of Barack Obama on January 20, 2009, along with Itzhak Perlman (violin), Gabriela Montero (piano), and Anthony McGill (clarinet). While the quartet played live, the music, played simultaneously over speakers and on television, was a recording made two days prior due to concerns over the cold weather damaging the instruments. Ma said, &quot;A broken string was not an option. It was wicked cold.&quot;

On May 3, 2009, Ma performed the world premiere of Bruce Adolphe&#x27;s &quot;Self Comes to Mind&quot; for solo cello and two percussionists with John Ferrari and Ayano Kataoka at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. The work is based on a poetic description written for the composer of the evolution of brain into mind by neuroscientist Antonio Damasio. A film of brain scans provided by Hanna Damasio, and other images, were coordinated with the performance.
On August 29, 2009, Ma performed at the funeral mass for Senator Edward M. Kennedy. Pieces he performed included the Sarabande movement from Bach&#x27;s &quot;Cello Suite No. 6&quot; and Franck&#x27;s &quot;Panis angelicus&quot; with Plácido Domingo.

On October 3, 2009, Ma appeared with Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper at the National Arts Centre gala in Ottawa. Harper, a fan of The Beatles, played the piano and sang a rendition of &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; while Ma accompanied him on cello. On October 16, 2011, Ma performed at the memorial of Steve Jobs at Stanford University&#x27;s Memorial Church.

In 2011, Ma performed with American dancer Charles &quot;Lil Buck&quot; Riley in the United States and in China at the U.S.-China Forum on the Arts and Culture.

On April 18, 2013, he performed at an interfaith service to honor the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing, held at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross, where he played the Sarabande from Bach&#x27;s &quot;Cello Suite No. 5 in C Minor&quot;. He and other musicians also accompanied members of the Boston Children&#x27;s Chorus in a hymn.

On September 9, 2015, Ma performed all six of Bach&#x27;s cello suites at the Royal Albert Hall (London) as part of the BBC Proms season.

On September 12, 2017, Ma performed all six of Bach&#x27;s cello suites at the Hollywood Bowl (Los Angeles). After the first three suites, there was a &quot;ten-minute pause&quot; (as the Bowl video screen described it). The audience of around 17,000 also heard him play an encore, a tribute to &quot;cellist Pablo Casals, who as a 13-year-old in 1890 discovered an old copy of the Bach suites in a secondhand music store, bringing them to modern attention. Ma&#x27;s memorable last words were, &quot;If there are any 13-year-here—don&#x27;t throw anything away.&quot;

On November 11, 2018, Ma performed at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, with violinist Renaud Capuçon, in front of a crowd of world leaders during a ceremony marking the centenary of the armistice that ended World War I.
On May 1, 2019, he performed at Paranal Observatory in the Atacama desert. He said that his interest in astronomy motivated him to visit and perform there.

On June 20, 2019, Ma performed the Bach &quot;Complete Cello Suites&quot; at Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Chicago, Illinois. The free performance attracted what might have been his largest audience, with a pavilion capacity of 11,000, and many thousands more listening from surrounding Millennium Park.

On January 20, 2021, Ma&#x27;s performance of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;—pre-recorded due to the COVID-19 pandemic—was played during the inauguration of Joe Biden. In March 2021, Ma played &quot;Ave Maria&quot; in an impromptu waiting room concert, after receiving his second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine at Berkshire Community College in Massachusetts.

On September 14, 2021, Ma again performed Bach&#x27;s six cello suites at the Hollywood Bowl, this time without intermission, pausing only briefly for applause between suites, and to announce his dedications for two of them.

On December 7, 2024, on the Reopening of Notre-Dame in Paris, Ma performed the prelude of the First Cello Suite from Bach.

==Media appearances==
Ma appeared as himself in an episode (&quot;My Music Rules&quot;) of the animated children&#x27;s television series &quot;Arthur&quot;, and on &quot;The West Wing&quot; (the episode &quot;Noël&quot;), where he played the prelude to Bach&#x27;s &quot;Cello Suite No.1&quot; at a Congressional Christmas party. He made five appearances on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, all of which first aired during the show&#x27;s 17th season in 1986. He appeared in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Puffless&quot;, where he played a serenade and theme music. Ma&#x27;s likeness appeared in another &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode, &quot;&quot;, but he was played by regular &quot;Simpsons&quot; cast member Hank Azaria rather than Ma himself. Ma appeared twice on &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;, developed a friendship with creator and host Fred Rogers, and later received the inaugural Fred Rogers Legacy Award.

He also starred in the visual accompaniment to his recordings of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Six Suites for Unaccompanied Cello&quot;.

Ma was often invited to press events by Apple Inc. and Pixar CEO Steve Jobs, performed during the company&#x27;s major events, and appeared in a commercial for the Macintosh computer. Ma&#x27;s Bach recordings were used in a memorial video released by Apple on the first anniversary of Jobs&#x27;s death.

Ma was a guest on the &quot;Not My Job&quot; segment of &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; on April 7, 2007, where he won for listener Thad Moore.

On October 27, 2008, Ma appeared as a guest and performer on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;. He was also one of the show&#x27;s guests on November 1, 2011, where he performed songs from the album &quot;The Goat Rodeo Sessions&quot; with musicians Stuart Duncan, Edgar Meyer and Chris Thile. He also performed several of Bach&#x27;s cello suites for the 2012 film &quot;Bill W.&quot; On October 5, 2015, he appeared on Colbert&#x27;s new program, &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, in support of ballerina Misty Copeland, and prematurely celebrating his 60th birthday.

In August 2018, Ma appeared on NPR&#x27;s Tiny Desk Concerts.

On June 19, 2020, the same group of musicians who recorded &quot;The Goat Rodeo Sessions&quot; released a second album, &quot;Not Our First Goat Rodeo&quot;.

On September 1, 2020, the same group performed a virtual concert of some songs from &quot;Not Our First Goat Rodeo&quot; on NPR&#x27;s Tiny Desk Concerts.

On June 13, 2021, Ma was the guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. His musical choices included &quot;Tin Tin Deo&quot; by the Oscar Peterson Trio and &quot;Podmoskovnye Vechera – Moscow Nights&quot; by Vasily Solovyov-Sedoi. He selected as his book the 24 volumes of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, and as his luxury item a Swiss Army knife. He revealed that his career in music felt like a &quot;gift&quot; after scoliosis threatened his ability to play in his 20s.

In 2022, Ma made a cameo appearance as himself in the Netflix film &quot;Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery&quot;.

==Personal life==
Since 1978, Ma has been married to Jill Hornor, an arts consultant. They have two children, Nicholas and Emily. Although he personally considers it the &quot;worst epithet he&#x27;s ever faced,&quot; he was &quot;tagged&quot; in 2001 as &quot;Sexiest Classical Musician&quot; by &quot;People&quot;. He has continued to receive such accolades over the years, including from AARP in 2012, when Ma was named one of the &quot;21 sexiest men over 50&quot;.

According to research presented by Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. for the PBS series &quot;Faces of America&quot;, a relative hid the Ma family genealogy in his home in China to save it from destruction during the Cultural Revolution. Ma&#x27;s paternal ancestry can be traced back 18 generations to the year 1217. The genealogy was compiled in the 18th century by an ancestor, tracing everyone with the surname Ma, through the paternal line, back to one common ancestor in the 3rd century BC. Ma&#x27;s generation name, Yo, was decided by his fourth great grand-uncle, Ma Ji Cang, in 1755. DNA research revealed that Ma is distantly related to actress Eva Longoria.

Aside from English, Ma is fluent in Mandarin Chinese and French.

==Discography==
Ma&#x27;s albums include recordings of cello concertos, sonatas for cello and piano, works for solo cello, and a variety of chamber music. He has also recorded in non-classical styles, notably in collaboration with artists such as Bobby McFerrin, Carlos Santana, Chris Botti, Chris Thile, Diana Krall, James Taylor, Miley Cyrus and Sting.

<doc id="142552" wikidata="Q215284" url="?curid=142552" title="Jerry Yang">
<text>Jerry Chih-Yuan Yang (; born Yang Chih-Yuan; November 6, 1968) is a Taiwanese-born American billionaire computer programmer, internet entrepreneur, and venture capitalist. He is the co-founder and former CEO of Yahoo! Inc. and founding partner of AME Cloud Ventures. Yang has a net worth of $2.6 billion.

== Early life and education ==
Yang was born Yang Chih-Yuan in Taipei, Taiwan, on November 6, 1968. His mother was a professor of English and drama and his father died when he was two, by which time Yang had a younger brother, Chih-Kong Ken Yang. In 1978, his mother moved the family to San Jose, California, where his grandmother and extended family took care of the boys while his mother taught English to other immigrants. After moving to the US, Yang took the American name Jerry; his mother, Lily; and his younger brother, Ken. He says that he only knew one English word, &quot;shoe&quot;, when he came to America, but became fluent in English in about three years.

During his time at San Jose, Yang attended Ruskin Elementary School, Sierramont Middle, and Piedmont Hills High School. He graduated from Piedmont Hills High School and went on to earn both a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science in electrical engineering from Stanford University in four years. He met David Filo at Stanford in 1989, and the two went to Japan in 1992 for a six-month exchange program, where he met his future wife, Akiko Yamazaki, also participating in the exchange program.

== Career ==
Yang founded Yahoo! in 1994 and was CEO from 2007 to 2009. He left Yahoo! in 2012. He founded a venture capital firm called AME Cloud Ventures and, as of 2015, is on several corporate boards. According to Rob Solomon, a venture capitalist at Accel Partners, Yang was &quot;a great founder, evangelist, strategist and mentor,&quot; having &quot;created the blueprint for what is possible on the Internet.&quot;

=== 1994–2012: Yahoo! years ===
While studying at Stanford in 1994, Yang and David Filo co-created an Internet website called &quot;Jerry and David&#x27;s Guide to the World Wide Web,&quot; which consisted of a directory of other websites. As it grew in popularity they renamed it &quot;Yahoo! Inc.&quot; Yahoo! received around 100,000 unique visitors by the fall of 1994. In April 1995, Yahoo! received a $2 million investment from Sequoia Capital, Tim Koogle was hired as CEO, and Yang and Filo were each appointed &quot;Chief Yahoo.&quot; Yahoo! received a second round of funding in the Fall of 1995 from Reuters and Softbank. It went public in April 1996 with 49 employees. In 1999, Yang was named to the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35. Terry Semel, who replaced Tim Koogle as CEO after the dot-com bubble crash, was CEO until 2007 when the rise of Google led the board to fire him and appoint Yang as interim CEO.

==== Alibaba ====

Yang met Alibaba founder Jack Ma in 1997 during Yang&#x27;s first trip to China. Ma, a government-employed tour guide and former English teacher, gave Yang a tour of the Great Wall of China. The two hit it off and discussed the growth of the Web. Ma created Alibaba several months later. A 1997 photo of Yang and Ma at the Great Wall still hangs on the wall in Alibaba&#x27;s Hangzhou office.

In 2005, under Yang&#x27;s direction but before he took over as CEO in 2007, Yahoo! purchased a 40% stake in Alibaba for $1 billion plus the assets of Yahoo! China, valued at $700 million. In 2012, Yahoo! sold a portion of its stake in Alibaba for $7.6 billion. The company made an additional $9.4 billion in Alibaba&#x27;s 2014 IPO. Eric Jackson, the founder of hedge fund Ironfire Capital, called Yahoo!&#x27;s investment in Alibaba &quot;the best investment an American company has ever made in China,&quot; and stated, &quot;Jerry deserves enormous credit for that.&quot;

==== Chinese government controversies ====

In the fall 2005, a month after the Alibaba investment, news broke that Yahoo! had cooperated with Chinese authorities in the arrest of Chinese journalist Shi Tao in November 2004. Shi had used a Yahoo email address to anonymously notify a pro-democracy website in the US that the Chinese government had ordered the Chinese media not to cover the fifteenth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989 on June 4. Yahoo! provided the Chinese security agencies with the IP addresses of the senders, the recipients and the time of the message. Shi was subsequently convicted for &quot;divulging state secrets abroad.&quot;

Yang justified the action, stating: &quot;To be doing business in China or anywhere else in the world, we have to comply with local law[s].&quot; Yang and Yahoo! were heavily criticized, and Reporters Without Borders called Yahoo! &quot;a Chinese police informant.&quot;

In April 2007, Wang Xiaoning and other journalists brought a civil suit against Yahoo! for allegedly aiding and abetting the Chinese government which, it was claimed, resulted in torture that included beatings and imprisonment.

In early November 2007, Yang faced questions from a Congressional committee with respect to Yahoo!&#x27;s role in the arrests of Tao and other journalists in China. During the hearings he apologized to Tao&#x27;s mother, who was also at the hearing.

A week later, Yahoo! agreed to settle with the affected Chinese dissidents, paying them undisclosed compensation. Yang stated, &quot;After meeting with the families, it was clear to me what we had to do to make this right for them, for Yahoo, and for the future.&quot; That week, Yang established the Yahoo! Human Rights Fund, a fund to provide &quot;humanitarian and legal support&quot; to online dissidents.

In February 2008, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that she raised issues about jailed Chinese journalists with her Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi; she cited a letter from Jerry Yang requesting her assistance in freeing the jailed dissidents. Late in 2008, the Laogai Museum opened; the museum was run by noted Chinese dissident Harry Wu and showcased China&#x27;s &quot;laogai&quot; penal system. It was funded by the Yahoo! Human Rights Fund.

On September 2, 2020, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of Chinese activist Ning Xianhua against past Yahoo! executives, including Yang and Semel. The lawsuit was filed in the US District Court in San Jose, California. It alleges that Yahoo! provided Xianhua&#x27;s private emails to the Chinese government in exchange for commercial access to more Chinese internet users.

==== Microsoft negotiations ====
In February 2008, Microsoft made an unsolicited offer to buy Yahoo! for $44.6 billion; at the time Yahoo! was still struggling to catch up to Google, while Microsoft was still seeking an internet search strategy. The offer was a 62% premium to Yahoo!&#x27;s market value at the time. The negotiations were difficult, as Yang had no desire to sell Yahoo! and would not make a counter offer. Once the negotiations ended in failure in May 2008, Yahoo!&#x27;s stock price plunged. Yang and board chairman Roy Bostock were strongly criticized by investors for their handling of negotiations, which later led to several shareholder lawsuits and a proxy fight led by Carl Icahn, which was settled in July 2008.

Yang&#x27;s response to the Microsoft takeover was to make a commercial search advertising arrangement with Google but they ended negotiation after U.S. authorities voiced concerns regarding the effect on competition in the market.

==== Resignation as CEO to departure ====
On November 17, 2008, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported Yang would step down as CEO as soon as the company found a replacement. He was CEO until 2009, when Yahoo! named Carol Bartz as CEO. He regained his former position as &quot;Chief Yahoo&quot; and remained on Yahoo&#x27;s board of directors.

In January 2012, Yahoo! announced that Yang was leaving the company and would be resigning from the board and all other positions at the company. The company also announced his resignation from the boards of Yahoo! Japan and Alibaba Corp.

=== AME Cloud Ventures ===
After leaving Yahoo! he became a mentor to technology startups and an investor through his firm, AME Cloud Ventures. AME (pronounced &quot;ah-meh&quot;) invests primarily in companies that work with data and has provided funding to more than 50 startups, including Tango, Evernote, Wattpad, Wish, Zoom and Vectra Networks Inc., and Chinese travel site Shijiebang. &quot;Ame&quot; means &quot;rain&quot; in Japanese, a nod to Yang&#x27;s interest in cloud computing.

== Personal life ==
Yang is married to Japan-born Akiko Yamazaki, who was raised in Costa Rica. They met in 1992 during a 6-month Stanford exchange program. Yamazaki graduated from Stanford University with a degree in industrial engineering and is a director with the Wildlife Conservation Network. Yang currently lives in Los Altos Hills, California.

== Philanthropy and impact ==
In February 2007, Yang and his wife gave $75 million to Stanford University, their alma mater, $50 million of which went to building the &quot;Jerry Yang and Akiko Yamazaki Environment and Energy Building&quot;, a multi-disciplinary research, teaching and lab building designed with sustainable architecture principles.

In late 2012 and early 2013, the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco exhibited selections from the Chinese calligraphy collection belonging to Yang and his wife. He began the collection in the late 1990s; it contains about 250 pieces. These selections also appeared at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the 2014 exhibition &quot;Out of Character: Decoding Chinese Calligraphy.&quot;

In September 2017, Yang and Yamazaki pledged $25 million to the Asian Art Museum, the largest donation in the museum&#x27;s history.

A new pavilion at the museum, funded by Yang and Yamazaki&#x27;s donation and named in their honor, opened in 2020.

Yang and Yamazaki loaned more than 50 Chinese ink paintings to Stanford&#x27;s Cantor Arts Center in summer 2018 for its &quot;Ink Worlds&quot; exhibition.

Yang was featured in &quot;Asian Americans&quot;, a PBS documentary series on Asian American history, in 2020.

In 2021, he was among the co-founders of The Asian American Foundation, a $250 million initiative to address racism against Asian Americans and provide services to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Yang sits on the board of the foundation, described by its organizers as the largest-ever philanthropic effort to support the AAPI community.

<doc id="142554" wikidata="Q717203" url="?curid=142554" title="Connie Chung">
<text>Constance Yu-Hwa Chung Povich (née Chung; born August 20, 1946) is an American journalist who has been a news anchor and reporter for the U.S. television news networks ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, and MSNBC. Some of her more famous interview subjects include Claus von Bülow and U.S. representative Gary Condit, whom Chung interviewed first after the Chandra Levy disappearance, and basketball legend Magic Johnson after he went public about being HIV-positive. In 1993, she became the second woman to co-anchor a network newscast as part of &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;.

== Early life and education ==

The youngest of ten children, Chung was born in Washington, D.C., less than a year after her family emigrated from China, and was raised in Washington, D.C. Her father, William Ling Chung, was an intelligence officer in the Chinese Nationalist Government, and five of her siblings died during wartime. She was named after singer and actress Constance Moore.

Chung attended Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Maryland. In 1969, she graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park with a degree in journalism.

== Career ==
===Early career===
Chung was a Washington, D.C.–based correspondent for the &quot;CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite&quot; in the early 1970s during the Watergate political scandal. Chung left to anchor evening newscasts for KNXT, a CBS owned and operated station in Los Angeles (now KCBS-TV). Her co-anchors at KNXT included Joe Benti, Brent Musburger and Jess Marlow. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; TV columnist said Chung &quot;helped give Channel 2 an agreeable, respectable, middle-road identity&quot;. Chung also anchored CBS&#x27;s primetime news updates (&quot;CBS Newsbreak&quot;) for West Coast stations from the KNXT studios at Columbia Square during her tenure there.

In early 2018, Chung was asked if she was sexually harassed in her career. She replied, &quot;Oh, yeah! Oh, sure. Yeah. Every day. I mean, a lot. Especially when I started out&quot;. Later that year, following Christine Blasey Ford&#x27;s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee alleging she was sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh, Chung wrote an open letter to Blasey-Ford in which Chung said she was assaulted in college by the doctor who delivered her, during an appointment when she approached him for birth control.

=== NBC ===
In 1983, Chung returned to network news as anchor of NBC&#x27;s new early program, &quot;NBC News at Sunrise&quot;, which was scheduled as the lead-in to the &quot;Today&quot; program. She was also anchor of the Saturday edition of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; and filled in for Tom Brokaw on weeknights. NBC also created two newsmagazines, &quot;American Almanac&quot; and &quot;1986&quot;, which she co-hosted with Roger Mudd.

=== CBS ===
In 1989, Chung returned to CBS to host &quot;Saturday Night with Connie Chung&quot; (later renamed &quot;Face to Face with Connie Chung&quot;) (1989–90) and anchor &quot;CBS Sunday Evening News&quot; (1989–1993). The former show was also planned to move to Mondays, but Chung&#x27;s increasing health commitments and pregnancy led to the show being replaced by &quot;The Trials of Rosie O&#x27;Neill&quot;. On June 1, 1993, she became the second woman (after Barbara Walters with ABC in 1976) to co-anchor a major network&#x27;s national weekday news broadcast. While hosting the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, Chung also hosted a side project on CBS, &quot;Eye to Eye with Connie Chung&quot;. After her co-anchoring duties with Dan Rather ended in 1995, Chung left CBS. She eventually jumped to ABC News, where she co-hosted the Monday edition of &quot;20/20&quot; with Charles Gibson and began independent interviews.

==== Kathleen Gingrich interview ====
In an interview by Chung on &quot;Eye to Eye&quot; with Kathleen Gingrich on January 5, 1995, (mother of Republican politician Newt Gingrich), Mrs. Gingrich said she could not say what her son thought about First Lady Hillary Clinton on the air. Chung asked Mrs. Gingrich to &quot;just whisper it to me, just between you and me&quot;; Mrs. Gingrich&#x27;s microphone volume was turned up as she replied, &quot;He thinks she&#x27;s a bitch&quot;. Many people interpreted Chung&#x27;s suggestion to Mrs. Gingrich that she whisper her response as a promise that it would be off the record. Bill Carter for &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;Ms. Chung had become the object of some of the most ferocious criticism, justified or not, ever directed at any network anchor as a result of her now infamous interview with Speaker Newt Gingrich&#x27;s mother, Kathleen&quot;. The interview was parodied on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

==== Oklahoma City bombing interview ====
A few months later, in the wake of the April 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, Chung was widely criticized for sarcasm as she asked an Oklahoma City Fire Department spokesman, &quot;Can the Oklahoma City Fire Department handle &quot;this?&quot;&quot; Many Oklahomans felt the question was insensitive to the situation. A few women created &quot;Bite Me, Connie Chung&quot; shirts in response to the interview. Thousands of viewers in Oklahoma and elsewhere called and wrote letters of protest over the tone of the questions. Moreover, co-anchor Dan Rather was irate that Chung was sent from New York to the assignment while he was already in nearby Texas. Consequently, after public outcry, and Rather&#x27;s complaints, Chung left the network after being removed as co-anchor of &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;.

=== ABC ===
In 1997, Chung moved to ABC News as a reporter on &quot;20/20&quot; and cohost of the Monday edition of the program alongside Charles Gibson. In 2001, she conducted an interview with Gary Condit on &quot;Primetime Thursday&quot;, focusing on his relationship with murdered Washington, D.C., intern Chandra Levy.

She was a guest host of the morning program &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. After short-lived host Lisa McRee left the program, Chung declined to take over on a permanent basis. She also was on &quot;ABC 2000 Today&quot; in Las Vegas.

=== CNN ===
Chung, for a short time, hosted her own show on CNN titled &quot;Connie Chung Tonight&quot;, for which she was paid $2 million per year. Though her arrival at CNN was heavily hyped by the network, her show was panned by critics. CNN changed her show from live to tape-delay to improve its continuity. Although it performed moderately well in the ratings (a 500,000 increase in viewers), her show was suspended once the 2003 Iraq War began. During the war, she was reduced to reading hourly headlines. Once CNN resumed regular programming, Chung requested that CNN resume broadcasting her show as soon as possible. The network responded by cancelling it, even though her contract had not yet expired. In an interview, CNN founder Ted Turner called the show &quot;just awful&quot;.

==== Martina Navratilova interview ====
In July 2002, Chung interviewed tennis player Martina Navratilova, who at that time had been a naturalized U.S. citizen for more than 20 years, about her recent criticisms of the U.S. political system. Chung labeled these criticisms &quot;un-American&quot; and &quot;unpatriotic&quot; and suggested Navratilova should &quot;go back to Czechoslovakia&quot; (which had ceased to be a united nation nine years earlier) rather than use her celebrity status to gain a platform for her complaints. When Navratilova asked why it was unpatriotic to speak out, Chung replied, &quot;Well, you know the old line, love it or leave it&quot;.

=== MSNBC ===
In January 2006, Chung and Maury Povich began hosting a show titled &quot;Weekends with Maury and Connie&quot; on MSNBC. It was Chung&#x27;s first appearance as a television host since 2003. The show was canceled shortly thereafter; in its final episode that aired June 17, 2006, Chung—dressed in a white evening gown and dancing on top of a black piano—sang a parody to the tune of &quot;Thanks for the Memory&quot;. Video clips of the off-key farewell performance circulated on internet video sites. Chung commented, &quot;All I want to be sure of is that viewers understood it was a giant self-parody. If anyone took it seriously, they really need to get a life&quot;.

== Interview style ==
Chung&#x27;s interviews were largely gentle, but often they were punctuated by a rapid-fire barrage of sharp questions. Consequently, her interviews were often used as a public relations move by those looking to overcome scandal or controversy. Some of her more famous interview subjects include Claus von Bülow and U.S. representative Gary Condit, whom Chung interviewed first after the Chandra Levy disappearance.

== Teaching ==
Chung accepted a teaching fellowship at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. While at Harvard, she wrote a discussion paper titled &quot;The Business of Getting &quot;The Get&quot;: Nailing an Exclusive Interview in Prime Time&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Chung has been married to talk show host Maury Povich since 1984. They have one son, Matthew Jay Povich, whom they adopted on June 20, 1995. 

On September 17, 2024, Chung released a memoir, &quot;Connie&quot;.

== Impact ==
In her early career, Chung was only the second woman and the first American of Asian descent to anchor a major nightly news program in the U.S. As such, for the growing number of new Chinese immigrants to the U.S. from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s, she was a rare, nationally visible representative. Many of these immigrant families, wanting their daughters to achieve and succeed, named their girls Connie after the one woman on mainstream media who could be seen as a role model for them.

<doc id="142556" wikidata="Q235254" url="?curid=142556" title="Michelle Kwan">
<text>Michelle Wingshan Kwan (born July 7, 1980) is a retired American competitive figure skater and diplomat who served as United States Ambassador to Belize from 2022 to 2025. In figure skating Kwan is a two-time Olympic medalist (silver in 1998, bronze in 2002), a five-time world champion (1996, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2003) and a nine-time U.S. champion (1996, 1998–2005). She is tied with Maribel Vinson for the all-time National Championship record.

She competed at the senior level for over a decade and is the most decorated figure skater in U.S. history. Known for her consistency and expressive artistry on ice, she is widely considered one of the greatest figure skaters of all time.

For well over a decade, Kwan maintained her status not only as America&#x27;s most popular figure skater but as one of America&#x27;s most popular female athletes. Kwan landed numerous major endorsement deals, starred in multiple TV specials and was the subject of extensive media coverage. From 1997 to 2005, she was the U.S. Figure Skating Association&#x27;s top-paid skater in appearance fees and prize money, as well as one of the highest paid Winter Olympic athletes in endorsements. Kwan was also the highest-paid skater on the Champions on Ice tours.

Following her figure skating career, Kwan became active in politics, particularly with the Democratic Party. In January 2022, President Joe Biden nominated Kwan to be U.S. Ambassador to Belize. She was confirmed by the Senate on September 29, 2022, took the oath of office on October 22, and presented her credentials on December 5.

==Early life and education==
Born in Torrance, California, Kwan was the third child of Danny Kwan and Estella Kwan, immigrants from Hong Kong. Her father was a native of Canton and emigrated from Hong Kong to California in 1971. Kwan grew up speaking both Cantonese and English at home.

Kwan&#x27;s interest in figure skating began at the age of five when she followed her two older siblings (ice hockey player Ron and figure skater Karen) onto the ice. Karen and Michelle began serious training when Michelle was about eight years old. They practiced three to four hours a day, waking up at 4:30am and arriving at the rink at 5:00am to skate before school, and then going back to the rink right after school to skate again. Paying for their increased skating-rink time led to financial hardship for Kwan&#x27;s working-class family. When Kwan was ten years old, her family could no longer afford a coach, but they were offered financial assistance by a fellow member of the Los Angeles Figure Skating Club that allowed them to train at the Ice Castle International Training Center in Lake Arrowhead, California.

Kwan attended Soleado Elementary School in Palos Verdes, California, but left public school to be homeschooled in 1994, when she was in the 8th grade. After graduation from Rim of the World High School in 1998, Kwan attended University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) for one year.

In the fall of 2006, she transferred to the University of Denver (DU). Kwan mentioned that her attendance at DU marked a significant &quot;turning point&quot; in her life. She made the shift from having tutors since 7th grade and being a full-time skater to becoming a full-time student. During her initial weeks at DU, she had to use crutches due to hip surgery.

Shortly after her arrival at DU, Kwan engaged in an international studies internship. Condoleezza Rice, the former Secretary of State, appointed Kwan as the inaugural American Public Diplomacy Envoy. Her role was to foster a better understanding of America by sharing her personal story through cross-cultural dialogues with international students.

Kwan mentioned the challenges of balancing travel and school, recounting instances when she had to take exams on campus shortly after returning from a 15-hour flight. She applied the knowledge gained in her classroom to her international endeavors.

In June 2009, she graduated from Denver&#x27;s Josef Korbel School of International Studies with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in international studies and a minor in political science. In 2009, she began graduate studies in international relations at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and graduated in 2011. On May 8, 2010, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Southern Vermont College.

== Career ==
Kwan won five World Championships (1996, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2003), tying her with Carol Heiss (1956–1960) for the most world titles by an American. Kwan&#x27;s nine world medals overall is the all-time record for an American skater in any discipline. The only ladies&#x27; singles skater with more world titles or medals is Sonia Henie of Norway. Kwan won nine U.S. Championships (1996, 1998–2005), tying the record for most wins set by Maribel Vinson-Owen (1928–1933, 1935–1937). She holds the record for the most consecutive U.S. titles (eight) and most consecutive U.S. Championship medals (twelve). She also earned the silver medal at the 1998 Nagano Olympics and the bronze medal in the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics. Kwan has received a combined total of 57 perfect marks (6.0s) at major competitions, the singles record under the former 6.0 judging system.

===Early competition===
In 1991, Michelle Kwan and her sister Karen began training with Frank Carroll in Lake Arrowhead, California. After one year of coaching by Carroll, 11-year-old Michelle placed 9th at the junior level at the United States Figure Skating Championships. At the age of 12 in 1992, Michelle passed the gold test to become a senior-level figure skater despite the disapproval of her coach. In 1993, Kwan finished sixth at her first senior U.S. championships. The next season, she won the 1994 World Junior Championships.

In 1994, Kwan finished second to Tonya Harding at the U.S. Championships, which ordinarily would have placed her on the U.S. team to the 1994 Olympic Games in Lillehammer, Norway. That place was instead given to 1993 national champion Nancy Kerrigan, who had been sidelined by an assault and battery (eventually connected to Harding&#x27;s ex-husband Jeff Gillooly) after a practice session at those championships. The 13-year-old Kwan went to Norway as an alternate but did not compete. Kerrigan and Harding both dropped out of eligible competition before the 1994 World Championships. Because of this (and teammate Nicole Bobek not making it out of the qualifying round), Kwan had the sole responsibility to ensure two entries for the U.S. at the 1995 World Championships by placing in the top ten. Kwan had an unusual mistake in the short program and placed eleventh in that portion of the competition, but skated a strong freestyle program and finished eighth overall.

At the 1995 U.S. Championships, Nicole Bobek won the gold medal, while Kwan again placed second after struggling with her lutz jump in both the short program and free skate. At the 1995 World Championships, Kwan was in fifth place after the short program. She skated last in the free skate, giving the best performance of her career up to that point, completing all seven of her triple jumps, and &quot;exuding joy and enthusiasm&quot;. She finished in third place in the free skate, behind Chen Lu from China, who came in first place, and French skater Surya Bonaly, who came in second. Kwan came in fourth place overall, behind American Nicole Bobeck, who came in third place overall, even though she came in fourth place in the free skate and despite Kwan&#x27;s successful execution of her jumps, which were second in difficulty behind Bonaly&#x27;s.

===Artistic development and 1998 Olympics===
Kwan began to develop a more mature style during the 1995 season. She used &quot;Romanza&quot; for her short program and in her free skate, music from &quot;Salome&#x27;s dance&quot; from the film score &quot;King of Kings&quot; by Miklós Rózsa and &quot;The Dance of the Seven Veils&quot; from the Richard Strauss opera &quot;Salome&quot;, both pieces depicting the Biblical story of Salome seducing King Herod. She also improved her extension, speed and jump technique, and performed to more difficult choreography. Carroll defended their decision to make Kwan appear more mature by stating that they were giving the judges what they wanted, saying, &quot;The judges were looking for the ladies&#x27; champion of the world, not the girls&#x27; champion of the world&quot;.

In both her practices and during her performance at Skate America, Kwan wore her hair in a bun instead of a ponytail and wore heavy theatrical makeup, including rhinestones pasted near the corner of her eyes. Her costume consisted of &quot;a short-sleeved rich purple dress with rhinestone-studded flesh-colored fabric across the midriff and deep front and black necklines, ornamated with elaborate sequined floral patterns in gold and bright pastels&quot;. According to writer Ellyn Kestnbaum, Kwan was inspired more to the music than to the narrative, which as Kestnbaum criticized, revealed Kwan as &quot;a sexual being&quot;. Kestnbaum stated, however, that she found it difficult to construct a linear narrative about the seductive Salome, but that Kwan&#x27;s moves &quot;might better represent a young woman venturing confidently into the world, encountering loss and confusion, but ultimately finding peace and triumph&quot;. Kestnbaum also stated that Kwan&#x27;s movements in the program evoked &quot;images of a sensual, luxurious, exotic Middle East&quot;.

Kwan&#x27;s free skate consisted of seven successfully-executed triple jumps, including two triple Lutz jumps, one of which was done in combination and was debuted at Skate America and the other preceded by intricate steps. Other elements, such as the complexity of her steps that connected these elements and her spin positions&#x27; originality and variety, also contributed to the program&#x27;s difficulty and artistry. Kestnbaum insists that Kwan&#x27;s increased speed, the strong debut of her triple-triple jump, and her improved poise, precision, and posture &quot;say more than her hairstyle or makeup about her new maturity as a skater&quot;. Kestnbaum states that Kwan&#x27;s fellow competitors were better in how they executed flow across the ice, speed, and height of their jumps and that although Kwan exhibited more caution and control than her competitors, she skated with &quot;new power and excitement compared to her younger self&quot;. Kestnbaum credits the success of the &quot;Salome&quot; program to Kwan&#x27;s intricate choreography, which featured emotional depth during the program&#x27;s heavier moments and frequent reversals of direction that often unexpectedly led to spins or jumps. Kwan ended up winning Skate America in 1995.

Kwan won both the U.S. Championships and the World Championships in 1996. In the later event, she edged out defending champion Chen Lu in a very close competition in which both competitors garnered two perfect 6.0s for Presentation in the free skate. She was the third youngest figure skater to hold both titles. The1996-97 season marked the beginning of a winning streak for Kwan that lasted more than a year, from the fall of 1995 to the fall of 1996. As Kestnbaum put it, Kwan became &quot;the most consistent and well-rounded skater in the [women&#x27;s] field, taking on an almost legendary mystique as she continued to mature as a feminine artistic skater emphasizing beauty, musicality, and dramatic storylines concerned with love and death&quot;.

In the 1996–97 season, Kwan skated to &quot;Dream of Desdemona&quot; (short program) and &quot;Taj Mahal&quot; (free skate). During this season, Kwan struggled with her jumps because of a growth spurt, which affected her balance on her jump, and problems with new skating boots which she wore for an endorsement contract with the manufacturer. She won the short program at the 1997 U.S. Nationals, but fell early in her free skate and as she later stated, &quot;panicked&quot; and made several more errors. She lost to Tara Lipinski, who came in first place in her free skate. Three weeks later, at the Champion Series Final, she again lost to Lipinski, who completed more successful jumps than Kwan in both the short program and free skate. At the 1997 World Championships, Kwan came in second place, behind Lipinski, who won the gold medal. Kwan came in fourth place in her short program due to an unsuccessful jump combination while Lipinski came in first place and Irina Slutskaya, who missed her combination jump, came in sixth place. All three skaters performed well during their free skates, each earning first-place ordinals from three of the nine judges. Kwan won the free skate, with Lipinski coming in second place and Slutskaya coming in third place. Kwan&#x27;s jumps in her free skate were not as difficult as Lipinski and Slutskaya&#x27;s, but her skating between her jumps was more complex and demonstrated &quot;more polished refinement&quot;. Overall, Lipinski came in first place, Kwan came in second place, and Slutskaya came in fourth place behind Vanessa Gusmeroli of France.

Going into the 1997—98 Olympic season, the American press &quot;play[ed] up the Kwan-Lipinski rivalry for all it was worth&quot;. According to Kestnbaum, Kwan&#x27;s programs emphasized sophistication and pure skating, which Kestnbaum called &quot;a change of pace&quot; from her previous two seasons, which featured dramatic storylines. Kestbaum also called both Kwan&#x27;s programs &quot;carefully choreographed expressions of joy&quot;. For Kwan&#x27;s short program, she chose piano music by Rachmaninoff, and for her free skating program, she chose music from the concerto &quot;Lyra Angelica&quot; by William Alwyn. She came in first place at Skate America, winning both the short program and free skate, while Lipinski came in second place. She also won Skate Canada, but suffered a stress fracture on her foot and was forced to withdraw from her third Champions Series Final. Kwan regained her U.S. title from Lipinski at the 1998 National Championships, despite her fractured toe. Her injury prevented her from attempting her triple toe-triple toe combination, but she completed all seven jumps in her free program earning 6.0s from eight of the nine judges. As Kestnbaum put it, Kwan &quot;skated with a transcendent floating quality that was becoming her trademark&quot;. Many people consider her performances at the 1998 U.S. Championships to be the high point of her career from both a technical and artistic standpoint. Both performances earned her fifteen perfect 6.0s and left two judges in tears.

Kwan and Lipinski were co-favorites to win the 1998 Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan. Kwan placed first in the short program, winning eight first place votes out of nine judges, while Lipinski came in second place. In the free skate, Kwan, who skated first in the final group, executed a clean seven-triple performance but placed behind Lipinski, who also did seven triples including a triple loop/triple loop combination and a triple toe-loop/half-loop/triple Salchow. Kwan&#x27;s performance was &quot;graceful and well-measured, filled with complex edging and unusual moves such as a sequence of spins in both directions&quot;. Kestnbaum called Kwan&#x27;s free skate &quot;tentative and slow&quot; as compared to her performance at Nationals. Her jumps were more difficult and bigger than Lipinski&#x27;s, but Kwan&#x27;s were not as high and did not cover as much ice as her competitors&#x27; jumps. Lipinski&#x27;s spins were faster than Kwan&#x27;s. The judges awarded Lipinski with higher technical scores and gave both Lipinski and Kwan the same presentation scores, mostly 5.9s, although Lipinski won the free skate. Kwan ended up winning the silver medal, with the gold medal going to Lipinski and the bronze medal to Chen Lu.

Lipinski and Chen both retired from competitive skating shortly after the Olympics, while Kwan went on to win the 1998 World Championships in Minneapolis.

===From 1998 to 2002 Olympics===

Kwan continued to compete as an eligible skater in the 1998–99 season, although she bypassed the fall Grand Prix season and instead chose to skate in a series of made-for-television pro-am events. Her &quot;regular&quot; competitive programs that season were &quot;Fate of Carmen&quot; (short program) and &quot;Lamento D&#x27;Ariane&quot; (free skate). Kwan won her third national title at the 1999 U.S. Championships, competing against a weak field. At the 1999 World Championships, Kwan did not skate her best, and placed second behind Russian competitor Maria Butyrskaya.

Kwan&#x27;s win at the 2000 U.S. Nationals was controversial to some. She was criticized for planning an easier solo jump in her short program than some of her competitors (a triple toe loop rather than a triple flip), and fell on this element in the competition. The judges nevertheless placed her third in that segment behind younger challengers Sasha Cohen and Sarah Hughes; however, the placement still kept her in contention for the title. Ultimately, she won the free skate with the best performance of the night, capturing 8 of the 9 first-place ordinals. At the 2000 World Championships, Kwan was again in third place after the short program, behind Maria Butyrskaya and Irina Slutskaya. In her free skate, Kwan landed seven triple jumps, including a triple toe loop/triple toe loop combination, and won that segment of the competition. Butyrskaya lost her commanding lead by finishing third behind Slutskaya in the free skate, allowing Kwan to win the overall title as well.

During the 2000–2001 season, Kwan began working with the famed designer (and former figure skater) Vera Wang, who designed most of her competition and exhibition costumes for the next six years. Kwan was only the second figure skater Wang designed for, following Nancy Kerrigan. At that year&#x27;s national championships, Kwan again won the title, receiving first-place ordinals from all 9 judges in both the short program and free skate. At the 2001 World Championships, Kwan was second behind Slutskaya in the short program. Kwan won the title with her &quot;Song of the Black Swan&quot; free skate, executing 7 triples, including a triple toe loop/triple toe loop combination.

Kwan and Carroll decided to end their coaching relationship two days before the start of the 2001 Skate America competition. In interviews, Kwan said she needed to &quot;take responsibility&quot; for her skating. Coachless, Kwan arrived at the 2002 U.S. Championships in Los Angeles amid the media&#x27;s scrutiny over her separation with Carroll and her season&#x27;s inconsistencies. Kwan won the competition with a revived &quot;Rachmaninoff&quot; short program and a new &quot;Scheherazade&quot; program for her free skate, securing a place on the 2002 Olympic team. Joining her on the team were Sasha Cohen (second) and Sarah Hughes (third). The 21-year-old Kwan and Russia&#x27;s Irina Slutskaya were favorites to win the gold. Kwan led after the short program, followed by Slutskaya, Cohen, and Hughes. In the free skate, Kwan two-footed her triple toe loop combination and fell on her triple flip, while Sarah Hughes skated a clean program. Kwan won the bronze medal behind Hughes and Slutskaya. Kwan&#x27;s final event of the season was the 2002 Worlds, where she won the silver medal behind Slutskaya.

===2002–2006===

Kwan began working with coach Scott Williams in the summer of 2002. She continued to compete on the Olympic-eligible circuit, although in a more limited way. During the fall seasons of 2002 to 2004, Kwan competed in only one Grand Prix event, Skate America in the fall of 2002, which she entered as a last-minute replacement. She won the event and qualified for the Grand Prix Final but chose not to compete in it. Kwan chose to not compete in Grand Prix events in the 2003 and 2004 seasons where the new judging system was being used. Kwan won all phases of every competition she entered in the 2002–2003 competitive season with her programs: Peter Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;The Feeling Begins&quot; from &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (short program) and &quot;Concierto de Aranjuez&quot; (free skate). She won the U.S. Championships again and regained her World title.

In autumn 2003, she hired the noted technician Rafael Arutyunyan as her coach, with whom she attempted to increase the technical difficulty of her programs and hone her jump technique. In the 2003–2004 competitive season, she skated again to &quot;The Feeling Begins&quot; for her short program, and Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot; for her long program. Again, Kwan won the U.S. Championships, earning seven more 6.0s for presentation during the free skating. At the 2004 World Championships, after a difficult qualifying round, Kwan was penalized in her short program for going two seconds over the time limit. This caused her to place fourth going into the long program, behind American Sasha Cohen, Japan&#x27;s Shizuka Arakawa, and Miki Ando. Kwan skated a clean performance with five triples and received the last 6.0 marks given at the World Championships. She placed second in the free skating portion (she was one judge short from winning the free skating) and placed third overall, behind Arakawa (who performed seven triples, including two triple-triple combinations) and Cohen.

For the 2004–2005 competitive season, Kwan skated her long program to &quot;Boléro&quot;, choreographed by British ice dancer Christopher Dean who had famously skated to the music with Jayne Torvill two decades before, and debuted a new short program, &quot;Adagio&quot; from Aram Khachaturian&#x27;s ballet &quot;Spartacus&quot;. At the U.S. Championships, she won her 9th title, tying the all-time record previously set by Maribel Vinson-Owen. Vinson-Owen had coached Frank Carroll, who in turn coached Kwan. At the 2005 World Championship, Kwan competed for the first time under the new judging system. She had a rough qualifying round and placed third in the short program. In the free skate, Kwan fell on her triple salchow and two-footed a triple lutz. Although she finished third in both the short and long program portion of the competition, Kwan was edged by Carolina Kostner for the bronze medal and finished fourth overall, missing third place by 0.37 points. It was the first time since 1995 that Kwan had failed to medal at any international competition, and would be her final competitive event.

====2006 Olympics====

Kwan looked at the 2005 Worlds as a learning experience in the ISU Judging System. She continued to train and stated that she would attempt to qualify for the 2006 Olympic Games in Turin, Italy. However, following a hip injury, she was forced to withdraw from her three planned competitions in the fall of 2005. Kwan skated her new short program (&quot;Totentanz&quot;) at a made-for-TV event in December 2005, but her performance was well below her usual standard. On January 4, 2006, Kwan withdrew from the U.S. Figure Skating Championships with an abdominal injury incurred in December 2005. One week later, she filed a petition with the USFSA for a medical waiver to be placed on the 2006 Olympic figure skating team. On January 14, 2006, after the United States ladies&#x27; figure skating event, the USFSA&#x27;s International Committee met and in a 20 to 3 vote approved Kwan&#x27;s petition under the stipulation that she show her physical and competitive readiness to a five-member monitoring panel by January 27.

Kwan performed her long and short programs for the panel on the stipulated day, and her spot on the Olympic team was established, as the panel felt she was fit to compete. However, on February 12, 2006, the United States Olympic Committee announced that Kwan had withdrawn from the Games after suffering a new groin injury in her first practice in Turin. Kwan remarked that she &quot;respected the Olympics too much to compete&quot;. The Turin organizing committee accepted the USOC&#x27;s application for Emily Hughes (who had finished third at the U.S. Championships) to compete as Kwan&#x27;s replacement.

After her withdrawal from the Olympic team, Kwan turned down an offer to stay in Turin as a figure skating commentator for NBC Sports. During an interview with Bob Costas and Scott Hamilton, Kwan said she was not retiring yet.

Kwan underwent elective arthroscopic surgery in August 2006 to repair a torn labrum in her right hip, an old injury which she traces back to 2002. According to Kwan, the surgery allowed her to skate pain-free for the first time in four years.

===After 2006===
Kwan did not compete during the 2006–2007 figure skating season.

Kwan told the Associated Press in October 2007 that she would decide in 2009 if she planned to compete in the 2010 Winter Olympics, but she ultimately decided not to do so, focusing instead on graduate school. She has said &quot;Representing the United States as an American Public Diplomacy Envoy the past three years has been very rewarding, and I want to do more.&quot; After graduating from the University of Denver in 2009, Kwan said &quot;Furthering my education will bring me closer to that goal, and I don&#x27;t want to wait any longer to continue the journey.&quot;

On February 17, 2010, Kwan told ABC News in an interview that she was continuing her studies as a graduate student at the Tufts University Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, as well as continuing her work as a Public Diplomacy Envoy. Kwan also said she would be commentating for Good Morning America at the 2010 Winter Olympics. 

In August 2009, Kwan made her first on-ice appearance in several years, performing at Ice All Stars, a show headlined by South Korean world champion Yuna Kim in Seoul, South Korea. Kim considered Kwan her idol growing up. Kwan also later appeared in Kim&#x27;s All That Skate shows in South Korea and Los Angeles.

She was chosen as the guest of honor to help open a new synthetic skating rink at the Marina Bay Sands resort in Singapore in December 2010, where she performed a modified routine to &quot;Winter Song&quot;, a program she self-choreographed with her sister. She returned to Singapore a month later as a Public Diplomacy Envoy to meet local students and to promote ice skating in the tropical country.

As of 2008, Kwan is a member of the Chinese-American organization Committee of 100. In 2014, Kwan joined Fox Sports 1 for its Winter Olympics broadcast.

==Skating technique==
Kwan was known for her unrivaled consistency in delivering clean programs, as well as her strong skating skills and deep, quiet edges that have been described as &quot;silent blades&quot; that &quot;barely whispered&quot;. She was also known for her musicality and ability to combine grace and artistry with athleticism.

Although not of the greatest height nor explosive spring, Kwan, for most of her career, included all of the triples (except for the Axel) in her programs, including two lutzes (the most difficult jump after the Axel). She landed the triple toe-triple toe combination cleanly eleven times in competition, including at her 2000 and 2001 world championship victories. During the 2004–2005 season, she debuted a triple flip-double toe-double loop combination.

Beginning in the 1996–1997 season, Kwan debuted a change of edge spiral that soon became her signature move. Kwan&#x27;s spiral was famed by commentators not only for its great extension and line, but also its speed, the strength and security of the edge, the deep lean and the easy smoothness of the change of edge. In the 1998–1999 season, Kwan revived a variation of the Charlotte spiral, a move innovated by German skater Charlotte Oelschlägel which had not been performed in decades.

Kwan&#x27;s split falling leaf was praised by fellow skaters Dick Button and Peggy Fleming during competitions, for its effortlessness and perfect split position in the air. Kwan has done multiple split falling leaves in immediate succession (without any turns or steps in between) while maintaining a split position on both.

Another of her trademark moves is a Y-spin done consecutively on both feet. Kwan is also one of the few skaters who can spin in both directions.

==Awards and accolades==
Kwan is a recipient of the prestigious James E. Sullivan Award (2001), which is given to America&#x27;s best amateur athlete; she was the first figure skater to win the award since Dick Button in 1949. In 2003, she was named the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) &quot;Sportswoman of the Year&quot;, and is the 5th figure skater in history to receive this honor. She has also been named USOC &quot;Athlete of the Month&quot; fourteen times, which is more than any other athlete, male or female, as well as being named &quot;Female Figure Skating Athlete of the Year&quot; by the USOC multiple times. She is also the recipient of the USOC&#x27;s &quot;Citizenship Through Sports Alliance Award&quot; (2004).

Kwan is one of only two multiple winners of the &quot;Readers&#x27; Choice Figure Skater of the Year&quot; award given by &quot;Skating&quot; magazine, winning it an unprecedented seven times (1994, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2001–2003). In 2003, the United States Figure Skating Association, which publishes &quot;Skating&quot;, announced that the award would be renamed the &quot;Michelle Kwan Trophy&quot;. The USFSA stated that although Kwan may continue to skate competitively, she would no longer be eligible for the award. The only other skater to win the award multiple times, Johnny Weir, only won it twice in comparison.

===Endorsements===
Kwan has had many endorsement contracts throughout her career, including Aim Funds, Campbell&#x27;s, Caress soap, Chevrolet, Coca-Cola, Disney, East West Bank, Got Milk?, Kraft, Mattel, Maxxis, McDonald&#x27;s, Minute Maid, Riedell Skates, Royal Caribbean International, Starbucks, United Airlines, Visa, and Yoplait.

Kwan&#x27;s multi-year deal with Chevrolet (starting in 2000) was estimated to be worth over $1 million. The Chevrolet/Michelle Kwan R.E.W.A.R.D.S. Scholarship program was established by the Chevrolet Motor Division of General Motors in cooperation with Kwan.

In 2002, Kwan was named a &quot;celebrity representative&quot; and spokeswoman for The Walt Disney Company in a three-year deal reported to be worth $1 million a year. This deal was renewed and expanded in 2006.

==Personal life==
In September 2012, Kwan announced her engagement to Clay Pell, an American lawyer, military officer and former director for strategic planning on the National Security staff at the White House. In February 2014, he declared his candidacy for Governor of Rhode Island. He was unsuccessful in his bid. Pell is the grandson of the late Rhode Island Senator Claiborne Pell. The couple, who met in April 2011, were married on January 19, 2013, in Providence, Rhode Island. Vera Wang designed Kwan&#x27;s wedding gown.

After four years of marriage, Pell filed for divorce from Kwan in March 2017 citing irreconcilable differences. 

On January 5, 2022, Kwan announced the birth of her first child, a daughter named Kalista Belle Kwan.

=== Political views and activism ===
Kwan worked as a surrogate to Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign as an outreach coordinator. When asked why she decided to join the campaign she explained, &quot;There was no way that I could sit on the sidelines.&quot;

She added that, for her, supporting Clinton was a no-brainer, given her family&#x27;s own immigrant history. &quot;Every day I&#x27;m reminded about my personal story, about what&#x27;s at stake in these elections. I think of my parents, and as I look around the room, we probably share similar stories, of how our parents, grandparents, or great-grandparents might have immigrated to the U.S. It&#x27;s so the next generation of Americans have the ability to dream that dream.&quot;

In May 2021, it was announced that Kwan would executive produce &quot;Recipe for Change&quot; for YouTube alongside LeBron James, Maverick Carter, Dennis Cheng, Jamal Henderson and Philip Byron. The special, set to air June 16, 2021 and produced by the SpringHill Company, brings together Asian American celebrities, chefs, activists, and creators to celebrate Asian and Pacific Islanders culture and discuss the recent and historic acts of hate and violence against the Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders community. &quot;Recipe for Change&quot; was nominated for &quot;Outstanding Daytime Special&quot; at the 49th Daytime Creative Arts &amp; Lifestyle Emmy Awards.

<text>Maxine Hong Kingston (; born Maxine Ting Ting Hong; October 27, 1940) is an American novelist. She is a professor emerita at the University of California, Berkeley, where she graduated with a B.A. in English in 1962. Kingston has written three novels and several works of non-fiction about the experiences of Chinese Americans.

Kingston has contributed to the feminist movement with such works as her memoir &quot;The Woman Warrior&quot;, which discusses gender and ethnicity and how these concepts affect the lives of women. She has received several awards for her contributions to Chinese American literature, including the National Book Award for Nonfiction in 1981 for &quot;China Men&quot;.

Kingston has received significant criticism for reinforcing racist stereotypes in her work and for fictionalizing traditional Chinese stories in order to appeal to Western perceptions of Chinese people. She has also garnered criticism from female Asian scholars for her &quot;&#x27;over-exaggeration&#x27; of Asian American female oppression&quot;.

==Life and career==
Kingston was born Maxine Ting Ting Hong on October 27, 1940, in Stockton, California, to first-generation Chinese immigrants parents: her father, Tom Hong (d. 1991) and her mother, Ying Lan Chew. She was the third of eight children and the oldest of the six born in the United States.

In China, Tom Hong worked as a professional scholar and teacher in his home village of Sun Woi, near Canton. In 1925, Hong left China for the United States in search of better prospects. However, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882—a xenophobic response to the influx of Chinese workers in the nineteenth century—was still in effect, preventing Hong from legally entering the United States. He attempted to enter from Cuba twice before finally succeeding in 1927.

Furthermore, early-twentieth-century U.S. employment laws were rife with racism, leaving little interest in hiring a well-educated Chinese immigrant. Hong had been a scholar in his home village of Sun Woi, near Canton. However, in America, Hong was limited to working menial jobs - washing windows and doing laundry. He saved his earnings and became the manager of an illegal gambling house, which led him to get arrested numerous times. Hong &quot;was canny about his arrests, never giving his real name and—because he apparently sensed that quite a few people thought that all Chinese looked alike—inventing a different name for each arrest. Consequently, he never acquired a police record in his own name.&quot; Hong was able to bring his wife over in 1939. During the fifteen years they were separated, Kingston&#x27;s mother, Chew, had studied Western medicine and become a doctor. Yet in Stockton, she was just another immigrant. 

Shortly thereafter, Kingston was born; she was named &quot;Maxine&quot; after a blonde patron at the gambling house who was always remarkably lucky. Kingston, a quiet child, didn’t learn English until age five. She recalls an I.Q. test once recording her score as zero. Asked to paint a picture for class, she presented a black sheet, representing stage curtains before a show. Her earliest memories are of World War II—cousins in uniform. Fascinated by war and soldiers, she grew up hearing her mother recount China&#x27;s history as a continuous cycle of conquest and conflict: “We were always losers. We were always on the run.” 
At a young age, Kingston was drawn to writing and won a five-dollar prize from &quot;Girl Scout Magazine&quot; for an essay she wrote titled &quot;I Am an American.&quot; She majored in engineering at The University of California, Berkeley, before switching to English. She met her husband, actor Earll Kingston, while they were both students at Berkeley, and they married in 1962. Kingston then began her career as a high school teacher.

Their son, Joseph Lawrence Chung Mei, was born in 1963. From 1965 to 1967, Maxine taught English and mathematics at Sunset High School in Hayward, California. After relocating to Hawaii, her boredom in a lonely hotel 80 miles north of Oahu caused Maxine to begin writing extensively, finally completing and publishing her first book, &quot;The Woman Warrior: Memoir of a Girlhood Among Ghosts&quot;, in 1976. She began teaching English at the University of Hawai&#x27;i at Mānoa that same year. By 1981 she had moved on to teach at Berkeley.

Her writing often reflects on her cultural heritage and blends fiction with non-fiction. Among her works are &quot;The Woman Warrior&quot; (1976), awarded the National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction, and &quot;China Men&quot; (1980), awarded the National Book Award. She has written one novel, &quot;Tripmaster Monkey,&quot; a story depicting a protagonist based on the mythical Chinese character Sun Wu Kong. Subsequent books include &quot;To Be the Poet&quot; and &quot;The Fifth Book of Peace.&quot;

A public television documentary produced by Joan Saffa, Stephen Talbot and Gayle K. Yamada, &quot;Maxine Hong Kingston: Talking Story,&quot; was released in 1990. Narrated by actor B.D. Wong and featuring notable Asian-American authors such as Amy Tan and David Henry Hwang, it explored Kingston&#x27;s life, paying particular attention to her commentary on cultural heritage and both sexual and racial oppression. The production was awarded the CINE Golden Eagle in 1990. Kingston also participated in the production of Bill Moyers&#x27; PBS historical documentary, &quot;Becoming American: The Chinese Experience&quot;.

Kingston was awarded the 1997 National Humanities Medal by President of the United States Bill Clinton. She was a member of the committee to choose the design for the California commemorative quarter.

In 2003, Kingston was arrested in Washington, D.C. while protesting against the impending Iraq War. The protest, which took place on International Women&#x27;s Day (March 8), was coordinated by the women-initiated organization Code Pink. Kingston refused to leave the street after being instructed to do so by local police forces. She shared a jail cell with authors Alice Walker and Terry Tempest Williams, who were also participants in the demonstration. Kingston&#x27;s anti-war stance has significantly trickled into her work; she has stated that writing &quot;The Fifth Book of Peace&quot; was initiated and inspired by growing up during World War II.

Kingston was honored as a 175th Speaker Series writer at Emma Willard School in September 2005. In April, 2007, Kingston was awarded the Northern California Book Award Special Award in Publishing for &quot;Veterans of War, Veterans of Peace&quot; (2006), an anthology which she edited.

In July, 2014, Kingston was awarded the 2013 National Medal of Arts by President of the United States Barack Obama. In Spring 2023, Kingston was awarded the Emerson-Thoreau Medal for distinguished achievement in the field of literature by the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences

She currently resides in Oakland, California where she is retired and maintains her garden.

==Influences==

In an interview published in &quot;American Literary History&quot;, Kingston disclosed her admiration for Walt Whitman, Virginia Woolf, and William Carlos Williams, who were inspirational influences for her work, shaping her analysis of gender studies. Kingston said of Walt Whitman&#x27;s work,

I like the rhythm of his language and the freedom and the wildness of it. It&#x27;s so American. And also his vision of a new kind of human being that was going to be formed in this country—although he never specifically said Chinese—ethnic Chinese also—I&#x27;d like to think he meant all kinds of people. And also I love that throughout &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; he always says &#x27;men and women,&#x27; &#x27;male and female.&#x27; He&#x27;s so different from other writers of his time, and even of this time. Even a hundred years ago he included women and he always used [those phrases], &#x27;men and women,&#x27; &#x27;male and female.&#x27;

Kingston named the main character of &quot;Tripmaster Monkey&quot; (1989) Wittman Ah Sing, after Walt Whitman.

Of Woolf, Kingston stated:

I found that whenever I come to a low point in my life or in my work, when I read Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;Orlando&quot;, that always seems to get my life force moving again. I just love the way she can make one character live for four hundred years, and that Orlando can be a man. Orlando can be a woman. Virginia broke through constraints of time, of gender, of culture.

Similarly, Kingston&#x27;s praise of William Carlos Williams expresses her appreciation of his seemingly genderless work:

I love &quot;In the American Grain&quot; because it does the same thing. Abraham Lincoln is a &#x27;mother&#x27; of our country. He talks about this wonderful woman walking through the battlefields with her beard and shawl. I find that so freeing, that we don&#x27;t have to be constrained to being just one ethnic group or one gender – both [Woolf and Williams] make me feel that I can now write as a man, I can write as a black person, as a white person; I don&#x27;t have to be restricted by time and physicality.

==Criticism==
Though Kingston&#x27;s work is acclaimed by some, it has also received negative criticism, especially from some members of the Chinese American community. Playwright and novelist Frank Chin has severely criticized Kingston&#x27;s &quot;The Woman Warrior&quot;, stating that Kingston deliberately tarnished the authenticity of Chinese tradition by altering traditional stories and myths to appeal to white sensitivities. Chin has accused Kingston of &quot;liberally adapting [traditional stories] to collude with white racist stereotypes and to invent a &#x27;fake&#x27; Chinese-American culture that is more palatable to the mainstream.&quot;

Kingston commented on her critics&#x27; opinions in a 1990 interview in which she stated that men believe that minority women writers have &quot;achieved success by collaborating with the white racist establishment,&quot; by &quot;pander[ing] to the white taste for feminist writing... It&#x27;s a one-sided argument because the women don&#x27;t answer. We let them say those things because we don&#x27;t want to be divisive.&quot;

However, several female Asian scholars have also criticized Kingston&#x27;s work. Shirley Geok-lin Lim, a professor of English at the University of California, Santa Barbara, stated that Kingston&#x27;s &quot;representations of patriarchal, abusive Chinese history were playing to a desire to look at Asians as an inferior spectacle&quot;. Writer Katheryn M. Fong took exception to Kingston&#x27;s &quot;distortion of the histories of China and Chinese America&quot; and denounced Kingston for her &quot;over-exaggerated&quot; depiction of Chinese and Chinese American cultural misogyny. &quot;The problem is that non-Chinese are reading [Kingston&#x27;s] fiction as true accounts of Chinese and Chinese American history,&quot; wrote Fong, who noted that her own father &quot;was very loving&quot; towards her.

<text>An ad hoc routing protocol is a convention, or standard, that controls how nodes decide which way to route packets between computing devices in a mobile ad hoc network.

In ad hoc networks, nodes are not familiar with the topology of their networks. Instead, they have to discover it: typically, a new node announces its presence and listens for announcements broadcast by its neighbors. Each node learns about others nearby and how to reach them, and may announce that it too can reach them.

Note that in a wider sense, ad hoc protocol can also be used literally, to mean an improvised and often impromptu protocol established for a specific purpose.

The following is a list of some ad hoc network routing protocols.

== Table-driven (proactive) routing==
This type of protocols maintains fresh lists of destinations and their routes by periodically distributing routing tables throughout the network. The main disadvantages of such algorithms are:

# Respective amount of data for maintenance.
# Slow reaction on restructuring and failures.

Examples of proactive algorithms are:
* Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) RFC 3626, RFC 7181.
* Babel RFC 6126
* Destination Sequence Distance Vector (DSDV)
* DREAM
* B.A.T.M.A.N.

==On-demand (reactive) routing==
This type of protocol finds a route on demand by flooding the network with Route Request packets. The main disadvantages of such algorithms are:

# High latency time in route finding.
# Excessive flooding can lead to network clogging.

Examples of on-demand algorithms are:
* ABR - Associativity-Based Routing
* Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector(AODV) (RFC 3561)
* Dynamic Source Routing (RFC 4728)
* Power-Aware DSR-based
* Link-life base routing protocols 

==Hybrid (both proactive and reactive) routing==
This type of protocol combines the advantages of proactive and reactive routing. The routing is initially established with some proactively prospected routes and then serves the demand from additionally activated nodes through reactive flooding. The choice of one or the other method requires predetermination for typical cases. The main disadvantages of such algorithms are:

# Advantage depends on number of other nodes activated.
# Reaction to traffic demand depends on gradient of traffic volume.
Examples of hybrid algorithms are:
* ZRP (Zone Routing Protocol) ZRP uses IARP as pro-active and IERP as reactive component.
* ZHLS (Zone-based Hierarchical Link State Routing Protocol) 

==Hierarchical routing protocols==
With this type of protocol the choice of proactive and of reactive routing depends on the hierarchic level in which a node resides. The routing is initially established with some proactively prospected routes and then serves the demand from additionally activated nodes through reactive flooding on the lower levels. The choice for one or the other method requires proper attributation for respective levels. The main disadvantages of such algorithms are:

# Advantage depends on depth of nesting and addressing scheme.
# Reaction to traffic demand depends on meshing parameters.

Examples of hierarchical routing algorithms are:
* CBRP (Cluster Based Routing Protocol)
* FSR (Fisheye State Routing protocol)
* Order One Network Protocol; Fast logarithm-of-2 maximum times to contact nodes. Supports large groups.
* ZHLS (Zone-based Hierarchical Link State Routing Protocol)
