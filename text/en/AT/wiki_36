<text>3rd Bass is an American hip hop group that was most active in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Formed by MC Serch, Pete Nice, and DJ Richie Rich, the group was notable for being one of the first successful interracial hip hop acts. Along with Beastie Boys and producer Rick Rubin, MC Serch and Pete Nice were two of the very few white hip hop artists who were widely respected in the community. The group dissolved in 1994 and again in 2000 and 2013 after short-lived reunions. The group released two studio albums in their initial career and both of them were certified gold by the RIAA.

== Career ==
MC Serch (Michael Berrin), Prime Minister Pete Nice (Peter J. Nash), and DJ Richie Rich (Richard Lawson) were the three founding members of the group. Richie Rich was a local D.J., while Nice was an English major at Columbia University and hosted a hip hop show on Columbia&#x27;s student radio station, WKCR-FM. Serch performed at clubs and block parties, and released a single called &quot;Hey Boy&quot; (b/w &quot;Beware of the Death&quot;) on independent label Idlers.

The two first performed as &#x27;3 the Hard Way&#x27;, a name referred to in the song &quot;Wordz of Wisdom&quot; but later redubbed themselves &#x27;3rd Bass&#x27; before recording their first album. Sam Sever, Prince Paul, and the Bomb Squad produced their 1989 debut, &quot;The Cactus Album&quot;, a critically acclaimed LP that went gold and contained a minor hit in &quot;The Gas Face.&quot; The accompanying video, which featured a bevy of humorous cameo appearances that included a then-unknown MF Doom, DJ Subroc, Gilbert Gottfried, Flavor Flav, Salt-n-Pepa, Kid &#x27;N Play and EPMD, garnered respectable MTV airplay and the single peaked at #5 on Billboard&#x27;s Top Rap Singles, though it did not chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The video also contained insults aimed at rapper MC Hammer and record executive Lyor Cohen.

As reported in many interviews, Serch had tried (unsuccessfully) to join up with fellow New Yorkers the Beastie Boys. Upon signing with Def Jam, 3rd Bass inherited their label&#x27;s feud with the Beasties. &quot;The Cactus Album&quot; was released shortly after the Beastie Boys—riding high on the success of &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot;—walked out of their contract with the label. In addition to containing multiple potshots directed at M.C. Hammer (referred to as &quot;M.C. Household Tool&quot; in the liner notes), &quot;Cactus&quot; also attacked the Beastie Boys and their defection to Capitol Records in the song &quot;Sons of 3rd Bass.&quot;

3rd Bass&#x27;s 1991 follow-up, &quot;Derelicts of Dialect&quot;, had a new target in fellow white rapper Vanilla Ice, who was the focal point of several tracks on the album, most notably &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot;. The track depicted Ice as a culture thief who watered down the sound of rap in order to pander to a mainstream audience, while depicting 3rd Bass as more respectful of the genre&#x27;s traditions. Ice was also criticized for his refusal to credit artists whose music he had sampled for his 1990 smash &quot;Ice Ice Baby.&quot; The video featured punk rock icon Henry Rollins dressed up as Ice, who received a &quot;beatdown&quot; by 3rd Bass at the end.

Fueled by the heavy backlash against Vanilla Ice at the time of its release, &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot; reached #1 on Billboard&#x27;s Top Rap Singles chart, gave the group their only Top 30 single (peaking at #29 on the Hot 100), and helped propel the album to gold status. The track was described by Allmusic as &quot;much-needed damage control in the hip-hop community,&quot; in part because it featured Caucasian rappers openly distancing themselves from one of their peers. Vanilla Ice answered back with &#x27;The Wrath&#x27; and &#x27;Hit &#x27;em Hard&#x27; which he played at concerts in 1992, though the songs were not officially released until 1994.

3rd Bass&#x27;s final collaboration was the title track to the soundtrack of the 1992 film &quot;Gladiator&quot; before the group called it quits. That same year—three years after &quot;The Cactus Album&quot;—the Beastie Boys retaliated against 3rd Bass on &quot;Check Your Head&quot;; the track &quot;Professor Booty&quot; contained the lyric &quot;dancing around like you think you&#x27;re Janet Jackson,&quot; which was interpreted as a swipe at Serch&#x27;s dancing in 3rd Bass&#x27;s videos.

== Breakup ==
In 1992, Serch co-wrote and produced several tracks for Detroit rapper Boss&#x27;s only album, &quot;Born Gangstaz.&quot; He released a solo record, &quot;Return of the Product&quot;, in August of that year, which included the second major label recording of Nas (credited in the liner notes as &quot;Nasty Nas&quot;) and featured the single &quot;Back To The Grill Again.&quot; Meanwhile, Nice and Rich teamed up as Prime Minister Pete Nice &amp; Daddy Rich, and released their only album, &quot;Dust to Dust&quot; in 1993. The leadoff single, &quot;Rat Bastard,&quot; contained voice samples from &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; and was rumored to reflect bad blood between the pair and Serch, though it was not confirmed. The follow-up was &quot;Kick the Bobo,&quot; which received light airplay on MTV and BET but was unable to become a sizeable hit. Neither Nice nor Serch were able to achieve much popularity on their own after 3rd Bass disbanded.

Around the time of the split, Serch was involved with the production of the movie &quot;Zebrahead&quot;. As recalled by actor Michael Rapaport, Serch originally wanted to star in the film but was unable to secure the role, and ended up producing the film&#x27;s soundtrack instead. After serving a stint at now-defunct Wild Pitch Records, he founded Serchlite, a record label and publishing company responsible for signing another group of white New York hip-hop artists, Non Phixion (who broke up in 2006).

3rd Bass reunited for a gig at the birthday party of Andy Hilfiger (brother of Tommy Hilfiger) in 1998. They also performed at Woodstock 1999, and released a non-charting single, &quot;Hail to the Chief.&quot; There had also been talks of a new album entitled &quot;Ichabod&#x27;s Cranium&quot;, but any long-term reunion and album plans were ultimately scrapped.

Nice retired from the music business and opened a baseball memorabilia store in Cooperstown, New York. He published a book, &quot;Baseball Legends of Brooklyn&#x27;s Green-Wood Cemetery,&quot; under his real name in 2003, in addition to attempting to secure property for an official gravesite of Negro league players. Serch hosted the VH1 reality TV series &quot;Ego Trip&#x27;s The White Rapper Show&quot;. Nash also produced a documentary about the Rooters, with interviews filmed in an old gas station in Cooperstown that he was turning into a museum of baseball fan history stocked with much of the memorabilia he was gathering. In 2007 Nice, along with Dropkick Murphys member Ken Casey, opened &quot;McGreevy&#x27;s 3rd Base Saloon&quot;, a baseball history-themed sports bar, in Boston in April 2008. In 2009 MC Serch was featured on rapper Kurious&#x27;s album &quot;II&quot; and music video by Amalgam Digital.

On April 6, 2013, MC Serch announced on Facebook that 3rd Bass would reunite after over 20 years to tour in celebration of The Cactus Album&#x27;s 25th anniversary. However, they only did two shows that year: a reunion show at a club in Brooklyn in July, and a cameo appearance on Labor Day at a festival in Indianapolis.

On November 8, 2024, the group performed together for the first time in 11 years at WBLS&#x27; 50th anniversary concert. A 2025 North American tour has been announced.

<doc id="140864" wikidata="Q977833" url="?curid=140864" title="Duplicating machines">
<text>Duplicating machines were the predecessors of modern document-reproduction technology. They have now been replaced by digital duplicators, scanners, laser printers, and photocopiers, but for many years they were the primary means of reproducing documents for limited-run distribution. The duplicator was pioneered by Thomas Edison and David Gestetner, with Gestetner dominating the market up until the late 1990s.

Like the typewriter, these machines were products of the second phase of the Industrial Revolution which started near the end of the 19th century (also called the Second Industrial Revolution). This second phase brought to mass markets technologies like the small electric motors and the products of industrial chemistry without which the duplicating machines would not have been economical. By bringing greatly increased quantities of paperwork to daily life, the duplicating machine and the typewriter gradually changed the forms of the office desk and transformed the nature of office work.

They were often used in schools, churches, and small organizations, where revolutionarily economical copying was in demand for the production of newsletters and worksheets. Self-publishers also used these machines to produce fanzines.
A few alternatives to hand copying were invented between the mid-17th century and the late 18th century, but none were widely adopted for business use.

==Polygraphs==
In document duplication (as opposed to law enforcement and such), a polygraph is a mechanical device that moves a second pen parallel to one held by a writer, enabling the writer to make a duplicate of a document as it is written. Polygraphs appeared in the 17th century but did not become popular until 1800. John Isaac Hawkins and Charles Willson Peale patented a polygraph in the US in 1803, and beginning in 1804 Thomas Jefferson collaborated with them in working on improvements in the machine. He used a polygraph for the rest of his life. However, polygraphs were not practical for most office purposes and were never widely used in businesses. Hawkins &amp; Peale lost money producing polygraphs. The problem was their &quot;inherent instability, and constant need for repair and adjustment.&quot;

==Letter copying presses==


In 1780 James Watt obtained a patent for letter copying presses, which James Watt &amp; Co. produced beginning in that year. Letter copying presses were used by the early 1780s by the likes of Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Henry Cavendish, and Thomas Jefferson. In 1785, Jefferson was using both stationary and portable presses made by James Watt &amp; Co.

Using letter copying presses, copies could be made up to twenty-four hours after a letter was written, though copies made within a few hours were best. A copying clerk would begin by counting the number of master letters to be written during the next few hours and by preparing the copying book. Suppose the clerk wanted to copy 20 one-page letters. In that case, he would insert a sheet of oiled paper into the copying book in front of the first tissue on which he wanted to make a copy of a letter. He would then turn 20 sheets of tissue paper and insert a second oiled paper. To dampen the tissue paper, the clerk used a brush or copying paper damper. The damper had a reservoir for water that wet a cloth, and the clerk wiped the cloth over the tissues on which copies were to be made. As an alternative method of dampening the tissue paper, in 1860 Cutter, Tower &amp; Co., Boston, advertised Lynch&#x27;s patent paper moistener.

Then letters were written with special copying ink which was not blotted. The copying clerk arranged the portion of the letter book to be used in the following sequence starting from the front: a sheet of oiled paper, then a sheet of letter book tissue, then a letter placed face up against the back of the tissue on which the copy was to be made, then another oiled paper, etc.

Prior to the introduction of inks made with aniline dyes in 1856, the quality of copies made on letter copying presses was limited by the properties of the available copying inks. Some documents that were to be copied with copying presses were written with copying pencils rather than copying ink. The cores of copying pencils, which appear to have been introduced in the 1870s, were made from a mixture of graphite, clay, and aniline dye.

By the late 1870s, an improved method for moistening pages in copying books had been invented, and by the late 1880s it had been widely adopted. Rather than using a brush or damper to wet the tissues, the clerk inserted a thin moist cloth or pad between each oil paper and the following tissue.

In the late 1880s, adoption of improvements in office systems for filing unbound documents increased the demand for copying machines that made unbound copies of letters, as opposed to copies in bound books. In 1886, Schlicht &amp; Field of Rochester, N.Y., introduced the Rapid Roller Damp-Leaf Copier, a roller copier, which used pressure supplied by rollers to copy letters onto a roll of dampened paper. After copies were pressed onto the paper, the paper entered the cabinet under the copier, where it dried on a large roller. An attachment was used to cut dried copies off the roll.

Copies could be made more quickly with a roller copier than with a letter copying press. It was claimed that nearly 100 papers could be copied in two minutes with a roller copier. Roller copiers competed with carbon paper technology. It was claimed that a roller copier could make a half dozen copies of a typewritten letter if the letter was run through the copier several times. It could make a dozen copies if the letter was written with a pen and good copying ink.

The Process Letter Machine Co. of Muncie, Indiana, offered the New Rotary Copying Press, a loose-leaf copier, in 1902. This machine was similar to roller copiers but copied onto loose-leaf paper.

==Hectographs==
The hectograph introduced in 1876 or shortly before, was a technology in which a dye-impregnated master copy, not unlike a spirit master, was laid on top of a cake pan full of firm gelatin. After the dye soaked into the gelatin, sheets of paper could be laid on top of the gelatin to transfer the image. This was good for 50 copies at most. Hectography was slow and clunky, but it could inspire great intrepidity in its users.

While good-quality, reasonably rapid copies from a hectograph require fairly specific materials (Aniline dye is the most effective), passable copies can be produced from a bewildering array of improvised materials on makeshift equipment. Practically speaking, any dye that soaks into the gelatin and can then be drawn out by the available paper will work. This meant that improvised hectography assumed the role of reproducing nearly every sort of censored material from subversive literature to pornography. 

==Mimeographs==

The mimeograph invented by Albert Blake Dick in 1884 used heavy waxed-paper &quot;stencils&quot; that a pen or a typewriter could cut through. The stencil was wrapped around the drum of the (manual or electrical) machine, which forced ink out through the cut marks on the stencil. The paper had a surface texture (like bond paper), and the ink was black and odorless. A person could use special knives to cut stencils by hand, but handwriting was impractical, because any closed loop letterform would cut a hole and thus print as a black blob. The technology was soon refined to control this problem, also allowing the use of typewriters to prepare mimeograph masters. If the user put the stencil on the drum wrong-side-out, the copies came out mirror-imaged.

==Spirit duplicators==
The spirit duplicator invented in 1923 and sold by Ditto, Inc., used two-ply &quot;spirit masters&quot; or &quot;ditto masters&quot;. The top sheet could be typed, drawn, or written upon. The second sheet was coated with a layer of colored wax. The pressure of writing or typing on the top sheet transferred colored wax to its back side, producing a mirror image of the desired marks. (This acted like a reverse of carbon paper.) The wax-supply sheet was then removed and discarded, and the other sheet (containing the images) was fastened onto the drum of the (manual or electrical) machine, with the waxed (back, or reverse-image) side out.

The usual wax color was aniline purple, a cheap, moderately durable pigment that provided good contrast, though other colors were also available. Unlike mimeo, ditto had the useful ability to print multiple colors in a single pass, which made it popular with cartoonists. Spirit duplicators were incapable of double-sided printing, since the saturation of the paper with solvent inherent to the process would destroy a previously printed image. One well-made spirit master could at most print about 500 copies, far fewer than a mimeograph stencil could manage. To produce further copies, an entirely new master would have to be reconstructed in the same way as the original master.

Notoriously, images would gradually fade with exposure to light, limiting their usability for permanent labels and signage. Copies made by spirit duplicators now pose a serious challenge to archivists responsible for document textual and artistic preservation.

==Comparison of mimeographs and spirit duplicators==

Spirit duplicators and mimeograph machines were competing and complementary technologies during the first half of the 20th century. Mimeography was in general a more forgiving technology, and still survives in various forms into the 21st century.

Spirit duplicators required much finer operating tolerances and careful adjustments to operate correctly. Overall print quality of spirit duplicators was frequently poor, though a capable operator could overcome this with careful adjustment of feed rate, pressure, and solvent volume.

During their heyday, tabletop duplicators of both sorts were the inexpensive and convenient alternatives to conventional typesetting and offset or letterpress printing. They were well suited for the short runs used for school worksheets, church newsletters, and apazines. Even the least technically minded teachers, professors, clergy, and self-publishers could make use of them. The machines owed most of their popularity to this relative ease of use, and in some cases, to their lack of a requirement for an external power source.

Mimeograph machines predated the spirit duplicator, had a lower cost per impression, superior print quality, finer resolution, and if properly adjusted could be used for multi-pass and double-sided printing. Also, mimeographed images were as durable as the paper they were printed on, and didn&#x27;t bleach to illegibility if exposed to sunlight, the way that spirit duplicator pages did. A good mimeograph master could produce many more copies than the best spirit master. As with spirit masters, mimeograph stencils could be saved and reused for later print jobs.

There are still mimeography enthusiasts in the United States and Canada, and mimeograph technology is still in everyday use in the Third World, since many low-cost mimeograph machines do not require electricity to operate.

==Offset duplicators==

In the United States, an offset press with a sheet size smaller than is classified as a duplicator. In Europe, the distinction is made between presses that have cylinder bearings, and duplicators, which do not. Duplicators were manufactured by Heidelberg (T-offset), American Type Founders (Chief and Davidson lines), A.B. Dick Company, and Addressograph-Mulitilith.

==Digital duplicators==

In 1986, the RISO Kagaku Corporation introduced the digital duplicator. It uses the basic mimeograph technology but improves on it, in that the operator does not have to create the stencil directly. The stencil, called a master, is made by use of a scanner and thermal print head. A used master is automatically removed and placed in a disposal box, as a new one is created. This way the operator should not have to touch the used master material that is coated in ink.

There are also cost advantages over a copier at higher volume. For smaller print runs, the main cost is in the master material. This ranges between 40 – 80 cents per master depending on the manufacturer. When spread over 20 or more copies, the cost per copy (2 to 4 cents) is close to photocopiers. But for every additional copy, the average cost decreases. At 100 prints, the master cost per copy was only 0.4–0.8 cents per copy, and the cost of the paper printed upon will start to dominate. A master is capable of making 4000–5000 prints, and then a new master easily be made if needed for further copies.

Other manufacturers have adapted the technology including:
* Riso Kagaku Corporation
* Gestetner
* Ricoh
* Duplo

===How digital duplicators work===
Like the mimeo machine, digital duplicators have a stencil (called a master), ink, and drum—but the process is all automated.
# The original is placed on a flat bed scanner or fed through a sheet feed scanner, depending on the model.
# When the start button is pressed, the image is scanned into memory by reflecting light off the original and into a CCD.

<text>Edgar John Bergen (né Berggren; February 16, 1903 – September 30, 1978) was an American ventriloquist, comedian, actor, vaudevillian and radio performer. He was best known for his characters Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd. Bergen pioneered modern-day ventriloquism and has been described by puppetry organization UNIMA as the “quintessential ventriloquist of the 20th century”. He was the father of actress Candice Bergen.

==Early life==

Bergen was born in Chicago, one of five children and the younger of two sons of Swedish immigrants Nilla Svensdotter (née Osberg) and Johan Henriksson Berggren. He lived on a farm near Decatur, Michigan until he was four, when his family returned to Sweden, where he learned the language. After his family had returned to Chicago, when he was eleven, he taught himself ventriloquism from a pamphlet called &quot;The Wizard&#x27;s Manual&quot;. He attended Lake View High School. After his father died, when Edgar was 16, he went out to work as an apprentice accountant, a furnace stoker, a player-piano operator, and a projectionist in a silent-movie house.

Edgar so impressed the famous ventriloquist Harry Lester that he gave the teenager almost daily lessons for three months in the fundamentals of ventriloquism. In the fall of 1919, Edgar paid Chicago woodcarver Theodore Mack $36 to sculpt a likeness of a rascally red-headed Irish newspaper boy he knew. The head went on a dummy named Charlie McCarthy, which became Bergen&#x27;s lifelong sidekick. He had created the body himself, using a nine-inch length of broomstick for the backbone, and rubber bands and cords to control the lower jaw mechanism of the mouth.

For college, he attended Northwestern University, where he enrolled in the pre-med program to please his mother. He later switched to speech and drama, but never completed his degree. He gave his first public performance at Waveland Avenue Congregational Church located on the northeast corner of Waveland and Janssen. He lived across the street from the church. In 1965, he gave the church a generous contribution, a thoughtful letter, and a photograph of himself which had been requested by the minister and was displayed in the church&#x27;s assembly room which was dedicated to Bergen. He cut out an &quot;R&quot; and a &quot;G&quot; from his family name and went from Berggren to Bergen on the showbills. Between June 1922 and August 1925, he performed every summer on the professional Chautauqua circuit and at the Lyceum theater in Chicago. Bergen had an interest in aviation, becoming a private pilot.

==&quot;The Chase and Sanborn Hour&quot;==

His first performances were in vaudeville, at which point he legally changed his last name to the easier-to-pronounce &quot;Bergen&quot;. He worked in one-reel movie shorts, but his real success was on the radio. He and Charlie were seen at a New York party by Elsa Maxwell for Noël Coward, who recommended them for an engagement at the famous Rainbow Room. It was there that two producers saw Bergen and Charlie perform. They then recommended them for a guest appearance on Rudy Vallée&#x27;s program.

Their initial appearance (December 17, 1936) was so successful that the following year they were given regular cast roles as part of &quot;The Chase and Sanborn Hour&quot;. Under various sponsors (and two different networks), they were on the air from May 9, 1937, to July 1, 1956. The popularity of a ventriloquist on radio, when one could see neither the dummies nor his skill, surprised and puzzled many critics, then and now. Even knowing that Bergen provided the voice, listeners perceived Charlie as a genuine person. In 1947, Sam Berman caricatured Bergen and McCarthy for the network&#x27;s glossy promotional book, &quot;NBC Parade of Stars: As Heard Over Your Favorite NBC Station&quot;.

Bergen&#x27;s skill as an entertainer, especially his characterization of Charlie, carried the show (many recordings of which have survived). Bergen&#x27;s success on radio was paralleled in the United Kingdom by Peter Brough and his dummy Archie Andrews (&quot;Educating Archie&quot;).

For the radio program, Bergen developed other characters, notably the slow-witted Mortimer Snerd and the man-hungry Effie Klinker. The star remained Charlie, who was always presented as a highly precocious child (albeit in top hat, cape, and monocle)—a debonair, girl-crazy, child-about-town. As a child, and a wooden one at that, Charlie could get away with double entendres which were otherwise impossible under broadcast standards of the time.

:Charlie: &quot;May I have a kiss good-bye?&quot;
:Dale Evans: &quot;Well, I can&#x27;t see any harm in that!&quot;
:Charlie: &quot;Oh. I wish you could. A harmless kiss doesn&#x27;t sound very thrilling.&quot;

Charlie and Mae West had this conversation in 1937.
:Charlie: &quot;Not so loud, Mae, not so loud! All my girlfriends are listening.&quot;
:Mae: &quot;Oh, yeah! You&#x27;re all wood and a yard long.&quot;
:Charlie: &quot;Yeah.&quot;
:Mae: &quot;You weren&#x27;t so nervous and backward when you came up to see me at my apartment. In fact, you didn&#x27;t need any encouragement to kiss me.&quot;
:Charlie: &quot;Did I do that?&quot;
:Mae: &quot;Why, you certainly did. I got marks to prove it. An&#x27; splinters, too.&quot;

Charlie&#x27;s feud with W. C. Fields was a regular feature of the show.
:W. C. Fields: &quot;Well, if it isn&#x27;t Charlie McCarthy, the woodpecker&#x27;s pinup boy!&quot;

:Charlie: &quot;Well, if it isn&#x27;t W.C. Fields, the man who keeps Seagram&#x27;s in business!&quot;

:W. C. Fields: &quot;I love children. I can remember when, with my own little unsteady legs, I toddled from room to room.&quot;
:Charlie: &quot;When was that? Last night?&quot;

:W. C. Fields: &quot;Quiet, Wormwood, or I&#x27;ll whittle you into a venetian blind.&quot;
:Charlie: &quot;Ooh, that makes me shutter!&quot;

:W. C. Fields: &quot;Tell me, Charles, is it true that your father was a gate-leg table?&quot;
:Charlie: &quot;If it is, your father was under it.&quot;

:W. C. Fields: &quot;Why, you stunted spruce, I&#x27;ll throw a Japanese beetle on you.&quot;
:Charlie: &quot;Why, you bar-fly you, I&#x27;ll stick a wick in your mouth, and use you for an alcohol lamp!&quot;

:Charlie: &quot;Pink elephants take aspirin to get rid of W. C. Fields.&quot;

:W.C. Fields: &quot;Step out of the sun Charles. You may come unglued.&quot;
:Charlie: &quot;Mind if I stand in the shade of your nose?&quot;

Bergen was not a technically skilled ventriloquist, and Charlie McCarthy frequently twitted him for moving his lips. However, Bergen&#x27;s sense of comedic timing was superb, and he handled Charlie&#x27;s snappy dialog with aplomb. Bergen&#x27;s wit in creating McCarthy&#x27;s striking personality and that of his other characters was the making of the show. Bergen&#x27;s popularity as a ventriloquist on radio, where the trick of &quot;throwing his voice&quot; was not visible, suggests his appeal was primarily the personality he applied to his characters.

Bergen and McCarthy are sometimes credited with &quot;saving the world&quot; because, on the night of October 30, 1938, when Orson Welles performed his &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; radio play that panicked many listeners, most of the American public had instead tuned to Bergen and McCarthy on another station and never heard Welles&#x27; play. Conversely, it has also been theorized that Bergen inadvertently contributed to the hysteria. When the musical portion of Bergen&#x27;s show, &quot;The Chase and Sanborn Hour&quot;, aired approximately 12 minutes into the show, many listeners adjusted their dial and found the &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; presentation already underway with a realistic-sounding reporter detailing terrible events.

Ray Noble was the musical director and composer, and teenage singer Anita Gordon provided the songs on his show. Gordon was said to have been discovered by Charlie, who had a crush on her.

In the fall (autumn) of 1948, Edgar and Charlie faced serious competition from ABC&#x27;s &quot;jackpot&quot; quiz show, &quot;Stop the Music&quot;, which suddenly drew more listeners (Fred Allen faced a similar problem because he directly appeared before them). In December 1948, Edgar announced he was temporarily &quot;retiring&quot; from radio, admitting that &quot;Stop the Music&quot; was too popular to compete with. His final NBC broadcast was on December 26, 1948.

==&quot;The Charlie McCarthy Show&quot;==
In October 1949, Bergen went to CBS, with a new weekly program, &quot;The Charlie McCarthy Show&quot;, sponsored by Coca-Cola. After their sponsorship ended in June 1952, Warner-Hudnut, Inc., on behalf of &quot;Lanolin Plus&quot; cosmetics, primarily sponsored the series until the end of the 1953–54 season. In October 1954, Kraft Foods sponsored a new &quot;Edgar Bergen Hour&quot;. After Kraft&#x27;s departure, the series continued with participating sponsors as a 55-minute series in the fall of 1955. However, because more people were watching television on Sunday nights than listened to radio (and advertisers preferred to sponsor TV shows by then), the series finally ended on July 1, 1956.

==Comic strip==
In addition to his work as a ventriloquist, Bergen was also an actor and comic strip creator. He established the syndicated comic strip &quot;Mortimer and Charlie&quot;, which ran in newspapers from July 10, 1939, to May 1940, illustrated first by Ben Batsford and then by Carl Buettner. The comic strip&#x27;s writer was uncredited, but some of the gags certainly were lifted from the hit radio show. Between 1947 and 1954 Harvey Eisenberg also drew a comic strip based on Charlie McCarthy, scripted by Bergen.

==Films==
Bergen and his alter ego Charlie McCarthy were given top billing in several films, including the Technicolor extravaganza &quot;The Goldwyn Follies&quot; (1938), opposite the Ritz Brothers. That year they also appeared in &quot;You Can&#x27;t Cheat an Honest Man&quot; with W. C. Fields. At the height of their popularity in 1937, Bergen was presented an Honorary Oscar (in the form of a wooden Oscar statuette, the only wooden Oscar given so far) for his creation of Charlie McCarthy. Bergen, along with Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd, was also featured in the 1938 film &quot;Letter of Introduction&quot;.

As an actor alone, Bergen portrayed the timid suitor of the sister Trina in &quot;I Remember Mama&quot; (1948), and appeared in &quot;Captain China&quot; (1949), &quot;The Hanged Man&quot; (1964) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Waves&quot; (1967). Other film roles for the team include &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Laughing&quot; (1941) and &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; (1942), both with Fibber McGee and Molly. Charlie McCarthy wore a US Army uniform in &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot; (1943) with Mortimer Snerd. Bergen, McCarthy and Snerd were also featured in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fun and Fancy Free&quot; (1947). He later cameoed in all-star films such as &quot;The Phynx&quot; (1970), &quot;Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood&quot; (1976), and &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; (1979). In 1977, Bergen had made a guest appearance on a second-season episode of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, the highly acclaimed television comedy/variety program produced by Jim Henson who considered Bergen a major inspiration. His daughter Candice had also guest-starred on the show during its first season. Bergen died shortly after filming his &quot;Muppet Movie&quot; scene, which was also his final public appearance, and was subsequently dedicated to him. In 2009 Bergen was featured in the comedy documentary &quot;I&#x27;m No Dummy&quot;, directed by Bryan W. Simon.

==Television appearances==


Although his regular series never made the transition to television, Bergen made numerous appearances on the medium during his career. His first appearance was with Charlie McCarthy on NBC&#x27;s pioneering television variety show &quot;Hour Glass&quot; in November 1946. In a filmed Thanksgiving special, billed as his official TV debut, sponsored by Coca-Cola on CBS in 1950, the new character Podine Puffington was introduced; this saucy Southern belle was as tall as a real woman, in contrast to Bergen&#x27;s other sit-on-the-knee sized characters. On Christmas Day that same year, Bergen and McCarthy appeared as guests on Walt Disney&#x27;s first television show, &quot;One Hour in Wonderland&quot;.

In 1954, Bergen was a co-host on a memorable TV musical special, &quot;General Foods 25th Anniversary Show: A Salute to Rodgers and Hammerstein&quot;.

On December 26, 1954, Bergen appeared on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot; as a mystery guest. Bergen also hosted the television game show &quot;Do You Trust Your Wife?&quot; in 1956–1957, later succeeded, in a daytime edition, by Johnny Carson.

He appeared in the Christmas 1957 episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Gisele MacKenzie Show&quot;. In 1958, Bergen appeared with his 12-year-old daughter Candice on an episode of &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; starring Groucho Marx. In 1959, he appeared in the second episode titled &quot;Dossier&quot; of the NBC espionage series &quot;Five Fingers&quot; starring David Hedison. On May 21, 1959, he guest-starred with Charlie McCarthy on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot;. Bergen continued to appear regularly on television during the 1960s and into the 1970s, appearing on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; as late as 1977. He guest-starred as Charlie in the 1960 episode &quot;Moment of Fear&quot; of CBS&#x27;s &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot;. He did a stint as one of the &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; mystery guests on the popular Sunday night CBS series. His colleague Paul Winchell happened to be a panel member during that episode. Bergen appeared on the NBC interview program &quot;Here&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;.
Bergen hosted the ABC-TV variety Hour THE HOLLYWOOD PALACE in the 1960&#x27;s---when daughter Candice walked onstage,Charlie Mc Carthy cracked--&quot;Just my tough luck she has to be my sister!&quot;

Bergen appeared as Grandpa Zeb Walton in the original &quot;Waltons&quot; television movie, &quot;The Homecoming: A Christmas Story&quot; (1971). The role was played by Will Geer in the subsequent TV series. During the run of &quot;The Waltons&quot;—which took place throughout the 1930s and 1940s—the voices of Bergen and Charlie McCarthy were sporadically heard from the Waltons&#x27; radio, as family members regularly tuned in for that program.

He appeared on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; in Season 2. His daughter, Candice Bergen had appeared in Season 1.

==Family==

In 1941, Bergen met 18-year-old Frances Westerman, a young fashion model who had graduated from Los Angeles High School the prior year. He spotted her in the audience of his radio program, where she was the guest of one of his staff members. A long-distance courtship, spanning years, ensued. The two were married in Mexico on June 28, 1945.

On May 9, 1946, Frances gave birth to future actress Candice Bergen, whose first performances were on Bergen&#x27;s radio show. By 1950, the family lived on Beverly Grove Drive in Los Angeles. The couple&#x27;s second child was film and TV editor Kris Bergen. Frances also acted in several movies, co-starred in the 1958 TV series &quot;Yancy Derringer&quot;, and guest-starred in many other shows.

==Death==

In mid-September 1978, Bergen announced his retirement and sent his monocled, top-hatted partner, Charlie McCarthy, to the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. He opened at Caesar&#x27;s Palace Hotel Las Vegas on September 27, for a two-week &quot;Farewell to Show Business&quot; engagement. Three days later, on September 30, 1978, he died of kidney disease. Bergen was interred with his parents (buried under their true surname of &quot;Berggren&quot;) in Inglewood Park Cemetery, Inglewood, California.

In his will, according to Candice Bergen&#x27;s memoir, &quot;A Fine Romance&quot;, he left his daughter nothing but bequeathed his dummy, Charlie McCarthy, $10,000. &quot;I&#x27;d chased my father&#x27;s approval all my life, and here was proof I&#x27;d never get it,&quot; the actress wrote. &quot;I was hurt, shocked, when I discovered he had left me out of his will.&quot; She further explained that her father had provided this inheritance for the dummy so that the funds could be managed, invested, and reinvested to provide for his future performances. She said her father wrote in his will: &quot;I make this provision for sentimental reasons, which to me are vital due to the association with Charlie McCarthy, who has been my constant companion and who has taken on the character of a real person and from whom I have never been separated even for a day.&quot; Throughout the book, she suggested that her father seemed to have a stronger kinship with Charlie than with her. The dummy &quot;dominated&quot; her childhood, she explained, and even had his own bedroom in their house. &quot;Those were unique circumstances to grow up in,&quot; she wrote. &quot;Sometimes I have to give myself credit for being a functional human being. I knew my father loved me, but with his Swedish reserve, it wasn&#x27;t his nature to tell me.&quot;

A message in the closing credits dedicates &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; (which featured Bergen and Charlie in their last screen appearance) to the memory and magic of Bergen. In 1990, Bergen was elected to the Radio Hall of Fame, the same year that &quot;The Charlie McCarthy Show&quot; was selected as an honored program. In 1991, the United States Postal Service honored him with a 29-cent commemorative stamp.

On October 2, 2006, Bergen&#x27;s widow, Frances Westerman Bergen, died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, aged 84, from undisclosed causes. Unlike her husband, she is buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).

==Hollywood Walk of Fame==
Bergen was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with three stars in 1960, for his contributions to television, motion pictures, and radio. The stars are located at 6425, 6766, and 6801 Hollywood Boulevard, respectively.

<text>Six Dynasties (; 220–589 or 222–589) is a collective term for six Han-ruled Chinese dynasties that existed from the early 3rd century AD to the late 6th century AD, between the end of the Eastern Han dynasty and the beginning of the Sui dynasty. The Six Dynasties period overlapped with the era of the Sixteen Kingdoms, a chaotic warring period in northern China after the collapse of the Western Jin dynasty, as well as the Northern and Southern dynasties period. The terms &quot;Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern dynasties&quot; (魏晉南北朝) and &quot;Three Kingdoms, Two Jins, Southern and Northern dynasties&quot; (三國兩晉南北朝) are also used by Chinese historians to refer to the same historical era as the Six Dynasties, although the three terms do not refer to the same group of dynasties.

==Six Dynasties with capital in Jiankang==
The six dynasties based in Jiankang (modern-day Nanjing) were:

# Eastern Wu dynasty (222–280)
# Eastern Jin dynasty (317–420)
# Liu Song dynasty (420–479)
# Southern Qi dynasty (479–502)
# Liang dynasty (502–557)
# Chen dynasty (557–589)

The &quot;Veritable Records of Jiankang&quot; (建康實錄) by Xu Song (许嵩) of the Tang dynasty provides a historical account of Jiankang, which gave rise to this list.

===Northern Six Dynasties===
The list of dynasties above is sometimes referred to as the &quot;southern Six Dynasties&quot; to distinguish from the &quot;northern Six dynasties&quot;, which were:

# Cao Wei dynasty (220–266)
# Western Jin dynasty (266–316)
# Northern Wei dynasty (386–535)
# Northern Qi dynasty (550–577)
# Northern Zhou dynasty (557–581)
# Sui dynasty (581–619)

==Poetry in the Six Dynasties==
The Six Dynasties was an important era in the history of Chinese poetry, especially remarkable for its frank (for Classical Chinese poetry) descriptions of love and beauty. Especially important, and frequently translated into English, is the anthology &quot;New Songs from the Jade Terrace&quot;, compiled by Xu Ling (507–83), under the patronage of Crown Prince Xiao Gang (Later Emperor Jian Wen) of the Liang dynasty. Also significant, is the &quot;Zi Ye&quot;, or &quot;Lady Midnight&quot; style, supposedly originating with an eponymously named fourth-century professional singer of the Jin dynasty.

==Legacy==

The Six Dynasties period was the first time in history that the political centre of China was located in the south, which spurred a surge in population as well as economic and cultural development. This transformed southern China from remote territories to the economic centre that came to rival the north from Tang dynasty onwards.

Buddhism, which first reached China via the Silk Road during the Eastern Han dynasty, flourished in the Six Dynasties (and simultaneously in the Northern Dynasties) and has been a major religion in China ever since.

The Japanese scholar Tanigawa Michio analysed the Six Dynasties period to test general theories of China&#x27;s historical development. Some thinkers, Tanigawa writes, argue that China followed the set European pattern which Marxists and liberal thinkers thought to be universal, that is, from ancient slavery to medieval feudalism to modern capitalism, while others argue that &quot;Chinese society was extraordinarily saturated with stagnancy, as compared to the West, and they assume that it existed in a qualitatively different historical world from Western society.&quot; In other words, there is an argument between those who see &quot;uni-linear, monistic world history&quot; and those who conceive of a &quot;two-tracked or multitracked world history.&quot; Tanigawa&#x27;s conclusion is that China did not have &quot;feudalism&quot; in the sense that Marxists use, but that the military governments did not develop a military aristocracy of the sort that developed in Europe. The period established social and political patterns which shaped China&#x27;s history from that point on.

<doc id="140886" wikidata="Q243519" url="?curid=140886" title="Velvet">
<text>Velvet is a type of woven fabric with a dense, even pile that gives it a distinctive soft feel. Historically, velvet was typically made from silk. Modern velvet can be made from silk, linen, cotton, wool, synthetic fibers, silk-cotton blends, or synthetic-natural fiber blends.

== Construction and composition ==
Velvet is woven on a special loom that weaves two thicknesses of the material at the same time; the two layers are connected with an extra warp yarn that is woven over rods or wires. The two pieces are then cut apart to create the fabric&#x27;s pile, and the two lengths of fabric are wound on separate take-up rolls. This complicated process meant that velvet was expensive to make before industrial power looms became available, and well-made velvet remains a fairly costly fabric. Velvet is difficult to clean because of its pile, but modern dry cleaning methods make cleaning more feasible. Velvet pile is created by cutting the warp yarns, while velveteen pile is created by cutting the weft yarns.

Velvet can be made from several different kinds of fibers, the most expensive of which is silk. Much of the velvet sold today as &quot;silk velvet&quot; is a blend of silk and another fiber, often rayon or cotton. Velvet made entirely from silk is rare and usually has market prices of several hundred US dollars per yard. Cotton is also used to make velvet, though this often results in a less luxurious fabric. Velvet can also be made from fibers such as linen, mohair, and wool. A cloth made by the Kuba people of the Democratic Republic of Congo from the raffia palm is often referred to as &quot;Kuba velvet&quot;. Modern velvet can be polyester, nylon, viscose, acetate, or blends of synthetics and natural fibers (for example, viscose mixed with silk produces a very soft, reflective fabric). A small percentage of spandex is sometimes added to give the final material a certain amount of stretch (hence &quot;stretch velvet&quot;).

Velvet has a thick pile and can be cut &#x27;pile up&#x27; or &#x27;pile down&#x27; for more shine or more saturated color.

== History ==

Because of its unusual softness and appearance as well as its high cost of production, velvet has often been associated with nobility. Velvet was introduced to Baghdad during the rule of Harun al-Rashid (786–809) by Kashmiri merchants and to Al-Andalus by Ziryab. In the Mamluk era, Cairo was the world&#x27;s largest producer of velvet. Much of it was exported to Venice (whence it spread to most of Europe), Iberia and the Mali Empire. Mansa Musa, the ruler of the Mali Empire, visited Cairo on his pilgrimage to Mecca. Many Arab velvet makers accompanied him back to Timbuktu. Later Ibn Battuta mentions how Suleyman, the ruler of Mali, wore a locally produced complete crimson velvet kaftan on Eid. During the reign of Mehmed II, assistant cooks wore blue dresses (), conical hats (, ) and baggy trousers (, ) made from Bursa velvet.

King Richard II of England directed in his will that his body should be clothed in 1399.

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition described velvet and its history thus:
As mechanization was incorporated into the production of textiles in the 19th century, velvet became a more attainable fabric for the middle class. The development of &quot;double velvet&quot; in the 1830s allowed for two pieces of the textile to be woven at the same time on Jacquard looms which doubled the production capacity and cut the previous cost of the textile in half. 

== Types ==

;Chiffon (&quot;or transparent&quot;) velvet: very lightweight velvet on a sheer silk or rayon chiffon base.
;Ciselé: velvet where the pile uses cut and uncut loops to create a pattern.
;Crushed: lustrous velvet with patterned appearance that is produced by either pressing the fabric down in different directions, or alternatively by mechanically twisting the fabric while wet.
;Devoré or burnout: a velvet treated with a caustic solution to dissolve areas of the pile, creating a velvet pattern upon a sheer or lightweight base fabric.
;Embossed: velvet on which a metal roller has been used to heat-stamp the fabric, producing a pattern.
;Hammered: an extremely lustrous velvet with a crushed and dappled appearance.
;Lyons: a densely woven, stiff, heavier-weight pile velvet used for hats, coat collars and garments.
;Mirror: a type of exceptionally soft and light crushed velvet.
;Nacré: velvet with an effect similar to shot silk where the pile is woven in one or more colours and the base fabric in another, creating a changeable, iridescent effect.
;Panne: a type of crushed velvet produced by forcing the pile in a single direction by applying heavy pressure. Sometimes, less frequently, called &quot;paon velvet&quot;. However, since the 1970s, &quot;panne velvet&quot; as used in ordinary fabric stores has referred to a pile knit, perhaps better called a velour, with a short pile that falls in many directions; usually of polyester.
;Pile-on-pile, also called double velvet: a particularly luxurious type of velvet woven with piles of differing heights to create a pattern. It is one of the oldest known velvet weaving techniques.
;Plain: velvet commonly made of cotton with a firm hand.
;Ponson: A very heavy and quite expensive velvet made either entirely with silk or having a pile exclusively of silk, used at one point for women&#x27;s dresses and cloaks
;Utrecht: a pressed and crimped velvet associated with Utrecht, the Netherlands.
;Voided: velvet deliberately woven with areas of pile-free ground &quot;(&quot;usually&quot; &quot;satin&quot;) forming a pattern.
;Wedding ring or ring velvet: another term for devoré and/or chiffon velvets which are allegedly fine enough to be drawn through a wedding ring.

== Fibers ==
;Cotton: Cotton velvet is highly durable, but lacks much of the luxuriousness of other varieties of velvet, and its colors tend not to be as deep or rich
;Silk: Silk velvet is one of the more expensive kinds of velvet, and is usually shinier and softer than the cotton variety
;Microfiber: Microfiber velvet is a synthetic polyester variety of the fabric that resists stains easily and is lightweight
;Nylon/rayon blend: Nylon/rayon blend velvet has much of the feel and drape of silk-based velvet, but is usually much less expensive; also, it is easier to care for than silk velvet
;Polyester/spandex: Polyester/spandex velvet (often called &quot;stretch velvet&quot;) can be made of polyester with a small percentage of spandex to allow it to stretch in one or two directions
;Viscose: In terms of quality, viscose velvet is more similar to silk velvet than cotton velvet as it is softer and richer than the cotton

<doc id="140893" wikidata="Q55642869" url="?curid=140893" title="American mythology">
<text>American mythology is the body of traditional stories pertaining to America&#x27;s most legendary stories and folktale, dating back to the late 1700s when the first colonists settled. &quot;American mythology&quot; may also refer to the modern study of these representations, and to the subject matter as represented in the literature and art of other cultures in any period.

Stories from American mythology are the primary sources of inspiration for stories and tall tales such as Bigfoot, Paul Bunyan, and The Lone Ranger.

==American frontier==

==Native American Buffalo==
Native American culture is very much involved with mythology. They used mythology to tell great stories about their lives and the lives of their ancestors. They also would use stories to explain the supernatural connection between humans and certain animals. One very important aspect of the Native American mythology was the buffalo, also known as the Bison. The buffalo was seen as a potential food source to the Native Americans but were too hard to hunt, especially before the invention of guns so instead they were used in many rituals that included dancing and prayer. Most of the rituals were related to the difficulty of the catching and the killing of the buffalo.

The buffalo were considered to be sacred animals with knowledge about medicine, they were also seen as very powerful within the spirit world. Their body parts were used in many important religious rituals.

== Bigfoot == 
Bigfoot, also commonly referred to as Sasquatch, is a large and hairy human-like mythical creature alleged by some to inhabit forests in North America, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. Bigfoot is featured in both American and Canadian folklore, and since the mid-20th century has grown into a cultural icon, permeating popular culture and becoming the subject of its own distinct subculture.

== Fearsome critters ==
Fearsome critters In North American folklore were tall-tale animals jokingly said to inhabit the wilderness in or around logging camps, especially in the Great Lakes region. Today, the term may also be applied to similar fabulous beasts.

Fearsome critters include the Agropelter, Axehandle hound, Ball-tailed cat, Bigfoot, Cactus cat, Dungavenhooter, Glawackus, Gumberoo, Hidebehind, Hodag, Jackalope, Jersey Devil, Sidehill gouger, Splintercat, Squonk,Teakettler, Wampus cat, Belled buzzard, Gillygaloo bird, Goofus bird, Fur-bearing trout, Hoop snake, Joint snake, Snallygaster,
and the Snow snake.

<text>Dragonriders of Pern is a science fantasy series written primarily by American-Irish author Anne McCaffrey, who initiated it in 1967. Beginning in 2003, her middle child Todd McCaffrey has written Pern novels, both solo and jointly with Anne. The series (as of 2024) comprises 24 novels and two collections of short stories. The two novellas included in the first novel, &quot;Dragonflight&quot;, made McCaffrey the first woman to win a Hugo Award for writing fiction as well as the first to win a Nebula Award.

==Overview==

Humans have colonized the planet Pern in the Rukbat star system, but have lost much of their technology and history (including their origin on Earth) due to periodic onslaughts of Thread, a mycorrhizoid spore that voraciously consumes all organic material, including humans and their crops, given the opportunity. Thread comes from the Red Star, actually another planet. The Red Star has a 250-Turn (Pernese year) elliptic orbit around Rukbat, and when its orbit brings it close enough, Thread rains down on Pern at predictable intervals over about 50 Turns.

The Pernese use intelligent firebreathing dragons to fight Thread. A human rider has a telepathic bond with their dragon, formed by Impression at the dragon&#x27;s hatching. The bonding instantly creates a very close, lifelong relationship – the dragon almost invariably commits suicide at the rider&#x27;s death, and a rider whose dragon died bears a deep emotional wound which can never be fully healed. Later books deal with the initial colonization of Pern and the genetic modification of small native animals into creatures capable of carrying humans in flight.

The Pernese live in a pre-industrial society, with lords, holds, harpers (musicians, entertainers, and teachers), and dragons, with occasional examples of higher technology (like flamethrowers, the telegraph, chemical fertilizers, and powerful microscopes and telescopes). There are four basic social classes: Weyrfolk (centered on Dragonriders) who live in Weyrs, Holders who rule Holds (cities, towns and farms), Crafters, and the Holdless who have no permanent home (including traders, displaced Holders, and brigands). The society resembles feudal Europe, but with some significant differences – especially, farmers are organized in their own guild, independent of the Holders – rather than being serfs as in historical feudal societies. Also, there is no formal religion and nothing like the Medieval Church, the closest equivalent being in fact the Dragonriders, who have a planet-wide organization and to whom a tithe is due – though they are in no way sworn to celibacy (rather the reverse).

The series as a whole covers over two and a half millennia.

==Publications by the McCaffreys==
:&quot;This list is arranged in publication order. For Pern historical order see the chronological list of Pern books&quot;.

There are 24 &quot;Dragonriders of Pern&quot; novels and two story collections, the latest published in 2018. Anne McCaffrey once requested reading the works in the order they were written. That differs greatly from Pern historical order, for several reasons. The McCaffreys have published stories set in several different periods of Pern&#x27;s history from initial exploration to more than 2,500 years after landing (AL). Multiple stories feature the same events from different viewpoints. Some stories feature travel between times, even across centuries. Todd McCaffrey, writing alone or with his mother after 2002, has specialized in an early time period.

===Original trilogy===
These stories take place immediately before and during the Ninth Pass, about 2,500 years after landing (AL):

==Other works==
===Gamebooks and companion books===

===Graphic novel===
In 1991, &quot;Dragonflight&quot;, the first Pern book published, was released as a set of three graphic novels by Eclipse Books of Forestville, California. The story was adapted across all three graphic novels by Brynne Stephens. The first two graphic novels were illustrated by Lela Dowling and Fred Von Tobel, the third by Lela Dowling and Cynthia Martin.

===Music of Pern===
There are two CDs of music relating to the Teaching Ballads and the works of Masterharper Robinton and Menolly.

&quot;The Masterharper of Pern&quot; was made in 1998 by Anglo-Alaskan duo Tania Opland and Mike Freeman in collaboration with Anne McCaffrey at her request, and features the music of Robinton. The project began as an idea to include written music in the book of the same name, printed on the inner faces of the cover. By the time the composers had written and auditioned the early drafts at the author&#x27;s table it was clear that making the songs a reality to their creator&#x27;s satisfaction was finally possible. The CD project was completed some eighteen months later (1998) and released to the approval of the author and fans of the series worldwide.

The second CD pertaining mainly to the work another Pernese harper, Menolly, was completed in December 2008. Entitled &quot;Sunset&#x27;s Gold&quot;, this features Opland and Freeman with other musicians, and comprises twelve tracks of music recorded from 2006 to 2008. The CD includes the ballad &quot;Four Hundred Turns&quot; written by Anne McCaffrey shortly after she completed &quot;Dragonflight&quot;. It was placed in a desk drawer where it lay forgotten for almost forty years until the author rediscovered it just as the CD project was underway. It had never been seen or published before.

Songbooks are also available containing the music from the first CD, with a similar book for the second in the works.

===Television and film adaptations===
Prior to 1995, the motion picture and ancillary rights to the literary property were optioned by various entities, including Robert Mandell (for a cartoon series adaptation that was eventually redeveloped into &quot;Princess Gwenevere and the Jewel Riders&quot;) and Kerry Skogland.

In 1996, McCaffrey sold the motion picture rights to an Irish company, Zyntopo Teoranta, who entered into a co-production agreement with Alliance Atlantis, covering development including advanced 3-D animation and compositing effects for television budgets. Distribution pre-sale efforts failed, and Zyntopo Teoranta entered into an agreement with Ronald D. Moore as showrunner to present the project to Warner Brothers Network.

In 2002, Warner Brothers Network and writer Ronald D. Moore had completed sets and casting for a pilot episode, and were within a few days of filming. Moore had sent the pilot episode to Warners for final approval. It was returned with so many changes to the basic structure of Pern - making it more like &quot;Buffy: The Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;&quot; - that it no longer much resembled the world created by Anne McCaffrey. As a fan of the &quot;Dragonriders of Pern&quot; series, Moore refused to continue. Filming was canceled, and rights ownership remained with Zyntopo Teoranta&#x27;s assign, Kua Media Corporation (Canada).

In May 2006, rights to the entire &quot;Dragonriders of Pern&quot; series were optioned by Oscar-winning production company Copperheart Entertainment. Copperheart announced their intention to bring Pern to the big screen. In April 2011, Copperheart signed David Hayter as screenwriter and Don Murphy as executive producer for a film version of &quot;Dragonflight&quot;; the production was expected to begin in 2012.

In July 2014, Warner Bros. optioned all 22 volumes of the series for a feature live-action film. Later in November, Warner Bros. hired author-screenwriter Sarah Cornwell to adapt the first installment of the series.

===Games===
There have been several games released based on the &quot;Pern&quot; series:
* In 1983, Mayfair Games created a board game &quot;Dragonriders of Pern&quot; featuring cards with Pern characters and locations. This game is now rare and valuable to Pern collectors.
* In 1984, Gallimard published &quot;Dragonriders of Pern: The Book Game&quot;, a game in which two players use illustrated books to resolve aerial engagement against the &quot;threads&quot;.
* In 1983, Epyx released the video game &quot;Dragonriders of Pern&quot; for the Atari 8-bit computers and Commodore 64 in which the player could battle Thread and engage in diplomacy on Pern.
* In 2001, a video game &quot;&quot; was created by Ubisoft for the PC and Dreamcast under license from Zyntopo Teoranta, the Irish corporation which owns the motion picture, gaming and ancillary rights. This game follows a dragonrider as he searches for young women to be candidates for impressing a new gold dragon, and battles the &quot;bad guys&quot; on an adventure across Pern.

McCaffrey threatened legal action against unauthorized text-based, online, role-playing game communities based on the Pern world. She approved of strict rules for the communities that cleared some of these MUDs. In the 1990s, &quot;PernMUSH&quot; was one such community. The community&#x27;s rules discouraged straying out of character from the Pern world.

==Fandom==

The Pern fandom consists of a large variety of fan communities. The largest part of the fandom is made up by clubs that allow their members to &#x27;play&#x27; Pern by creating original characters within the setting of Anne McCaffrey&#x27;s world. To avoid conflicts with Pern canon and trademarks, each club typically chooses a particular location and timeline as a unique setting different from Anne McCaffrey&#x27;s established history of Pern. Most commonly, clubs are named for the main Weyr chosen as playing location.

Historically, the first clubs started out publishing printed fanzines containing fanfiction and artwork. With the advent of the internet, clubs using online technology such as roleplay via chat or email (PBeM) became popular. Text-based online virtual reality games, primarily MUSH and MUCK variants such as &quot;PernMUSH&quot;, have modeled Pern since the early 1990s. In the mid &#x27;90s, stringent rules were placed on the creation of new clubs and the governance of existing clubs, resulting in legal action against some fans. For example, no new fan-created MU* games were allowed while the game rights were licensed to Ubisoft for the development of the &quot;Dragon Riders: Chronicles of Pern&quot; computer game (released in 2001).

In November 2004, Anne McCaffrey relaxed her fandom rules significantly and allowed Pernese fanfiction to be posted freely throughout the Internet. Soon after, fanfiction sites such as FanFiction.net started offering the opportunity to post and read fanfiction based on Anne McCaffrey&#x27;s works. The relaxing of the rules also resulted in the appearance of message board–based games as another popular club type. Fan sites no longer require approval and are not bound to the formerly strict canon rules, resulting in fan clubs testing out alternatives such as new dragon colors or off-Pern scenarios.

From 2000 until 2005, Anne McCaffrey&#x27;s website offered a popular discussion forum and chat (The Kitchen Table) for fans to interact with each other and with the author. After its discontinuation in January 2005, several fan-organized discussion forums have taken its place as an outlet for fan activity.

Offline, the largest Pern fan gathering was WeyrFest, held yearly at Dragon*Con beginning in 1992. Anne McCaffrey and Todd McCaffrey were frequent attendees at WeyrFest, offering fans a chance to meet the authors in person. Anne was originally scheduled to attend the 2011 Dragon*Con, but had deferred her appearance until the 2012 event due to heart problems, just a few months before her death in late November of that year. In 2013, Weyrfest was folded into Dragon*Con&#x27;s Fantasy Literature track, along with Robert Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series.

<text>In lithic analysis (a subdivision of archaeology), an eraillure is a flake removed from a lithic flake&#x27;s bulb of force, which is a lump left on the ventral surface of a flake after it is detached from a core of tool stone during the process of lithic reduction. The mechanics of eraillure formation are related to the propagation of a Hertzian cone of force through the cryptocrystalline matrix of the stone, but the particulars are poorly understood. Eraillures usually form only when a hammerstone is used for lithic reduction, and then only occasionally; use of &#x27;soft&#x27; hammer fabricators made from bone, antler, and wood produce different flake characteristics but may also produce an eraillure in rare cases.

<text>Lake Tahoe (; Washo: &quot;Dáʔaw&quot;) is a freshwater lake in the Sierra Nevada of the Western United States, straddling the border between California and Nevada. Lying at above sea level, Lake Tahoe is the largest alpine lake in North America, and at it trails only the five Great Lakes as the largest by volume in the United States. Its depth is , making it the second deepest in the United States after Crater Lake in Oregon ().

The lake was formed about two million years ago as part of the Lake Tahoe Basin, and its modern extent was shaped during the ice ages. It is known for the clarity of its water and the panorama of surrounding mountains on all sides. The area surrounding the lake is also referred to as Lake Tahoe, or simply Tahoe; its English name is derived from its Washo name, . More than 75% of the lake&#x27;s watershed is national forest land, covered by the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit of the United States Forest Service.

Lake Tahoe is a major tourist attraction in both Nevada and California. It is home to winter sports, summer outdoor recreation, and scenery enjoyed throughout the year. Snow and ski resorts are a significant part of the area&#x27;s economy and reputation. The Nevada side also offers several lakeside casino resorts, with highways providing year-round access to the entire area.

==Toponym==
The name for Lake Tahoe derives from the Washo word for the lake, , meaning &#x27;the lake.&#x27; Even though is used in the names of other lakes with modifiers (for example, for Pyramid Lake, meaning &#x27;trout lake&#x27;), it often is used without a modifier to refer to Lake Tahoe. This may be because of Tahoe&#x27;s importance to Washo culture.

==Geography==

Lake Tahoe is the second deepest lake in the U.S., with a maximum depth of , trailing Oregon&#x27;s Crater Lake at . Tahoe is the 17th deepest lake in the world, and the sixth deepest in average depth. It is about long and wide and has of shoreline and a surface area of . The lake is so large that its surface is noticeably convex due to the curvature of the Earth. At lake level the opposing shorelines are below the horizon at its widest parts; by nearly at its maximum width, and by some along its length. Visibility may vary somewhat with atmospheric refraction; when the air temperature is much greater than the lake temperature, looming may occur where the lake surface or opposing shoreline is lifted above the horizon. Fata Morgana may be responsible for Tahoe Tessie sightings.
Approximately two-thirds of the shoreline is in California. The south shore is dominated by the lake&#x27;s largest city, South Lake Tahoe, California, which adjoins the town of Stateline, Nevada, while Tahoe City, California, is located on the lake&#x27;s northwest shore. Kings Beach, California, and Incline Village, Nevada, anchor the lake&#x27;s north shore. Although highways run within sight of the lake shore for much of Tahoe&#x27;s perimeter, many important parts of the shoreline lie within state parks or are protected by the United States Forest Service. The Lake Tahoe Watershed (USGS Huc 18100200) of is the land area that drains to the lake and the Lake Tahoe drainage divide traverses the same general area as the Tahoe Rim Trail.
Lake Tahoe is fed by 63 tributaries. These drain an area about the same size as the lake and produce half its water; the other half is produced by direct precipitation.


The Truckee River is the lake&#x27;s only outlet, flowing northeast through Reno, Nevada, into Pyramid Lake which has no outlet. It accounts for one third of the water that leaves the lake, the rest evaporating from the lake&#x27;s surface. Evaporation is thought to account for 40 to 60 percent of the water usage. The flow of the Truckee River and the height of the lake are controlled by Lake Tahoe Dam at the outlet. The natural rim is at above sea level. The maximum legal limit to which the lake can be allowed to rise in order to store water is at ; a spillway at the dam controls overflow. Around New Year 1996/1997 a Pineapple Express atmospheric river melted snow and caused the lake and river to overflow, inundating Reno and surrounding areas.

==Natural history==

===Geology===
The Lake Tahoe Basin was formed by vertical motion (normal) faulting. Uplifted blocks created the Carson Range on the east and the main Sierra Nevada crest on the west. Down-dropping and block tilting (half-grabens) created the Lake Tahoe Basin in between. This kind of faulting is characteristic of the geology of the adjoining Great Basin to the east.

Lake Tahoe is the youngest of several extensional basins of the Walker Lane deformation zone that accommodates nearly per year of dextral shear between the Sierra Nevada-Great Valley Block and the North America plate.

Three principal faults form the Lake Tahoe basin: the West Tahoe Fault, aligned between Meyers and Tahoe City, and which is the local segment of the Sierra Nevada Fault, extending on shore north and south of these localities; the Stateline/North Tahoe Fault, starting in the middle of the lake and creating the relief that forms Stateline, NV; and the Incline Village Fault, which runs parallel to the Stateline/North Tahoe Fault offshore and into Incline Village. The West Tahoe Fault appears to be the most active and potentially hazardous fault in the basin. A study in Fallen Leaf Lake, just south of Lake Tahoe, used seafloor mapping techniques to image evidence for paleoearthquakes on the West Tahoe and revealed the last earthquake occurred between 4,100 and 4,500 years ago. Subsequent studies revealed submarine landslides in Fallen Leaf Lake and Lake Tahoe that are thought to have been triggered by earthquakes on the West Tahoe fault and the timing of these events suggests a recurrence interval of 3,000–4,000 years.

Some of the highest peaks of the Lake Tahoe Basin that formed during the process of Lake Tahoe creation are Freel Peak at , Monument Peak at , Pyramid Peak at (in the Desolation Wilderness), and Mount Tallac at . The north shore boasts three peaks at over : Mount Rose at , Mount Houghton at and Relay Peak at . Mt. Rose is a very popular hiking and backcountry skiing destination.

Eruptions from the now-extinct volcano Mount Pluto formed a volcanic dam on the north side. Melting snow filled the southern and lowest part of the basin to form the ancestral Lake Tahoe. Rain and runoff added additional water.

The Sierra Nevada adjacent to Lake Tahoe were carved by scouring glaciers during the Ice Ages, which began a million or more years ago, and retreated ~15,000 years ago at the end of the Pleistocene. The glaciers carved canyons that are today iconic landmarks such as Emerald Bay, Cascade Lake, and Fallen Leaf Lake, among others. Lake Tahoe itself never held glaciers, but instead water is retained by damming Miocene volcanic deposits.

Soils of the basin come primarily from andesitic volcanic rocks and granodiorite, with minor areas of metamorphic rock. Some of the valley bottoms and lower hill slopes are mantled with glacial moraines, or glacial outwash material derived from the parent rock. Sandy soils, rock outcrops and rubble and stony colluvium account for over 70% of the land area in the basin. The basin soils (in the &lt; 2 mm fraction) are generally 65–85% sand (0.05–2.0 mm).

Given the great depth of Lake Tahoe, and the locations of the normal faults in the deepest portions of the lake, modeling suggests that earthquakes on these faults can trigger tsunamis. Wave heights of these tsunamis are predicted to be on the order of in height, capable of traversing the lake in just a few minutes. A massive collapse of the western edge of the basin that formed McKinney Bay around 50,000 years ago is thought to have generated a tsunami/seiche wave with a height approaching .

===Climate===

Lake Tahoe has a dry-summer continental climate (&quot;Dsb&quot; in the Köppen climate classification), featuring warm, dry summers and chilly winters with regular snowfall. Mean annual precipitation ranges from over for watersheds on the west side of the basin to about near the lake on the east side of the basin. Most of the precipitation falls as snow between November and April, although rainstorms combined with rapid snowmelt account for the largest floods. There is a pronounced annual runoff of snowmelt in late spring and early summer, the timing of which varies from year to year. In some years, summertime monsoon storms from the Great Basin bring intense rainfall, especially to high elevations on the northeast side of the basin.

August is normally the warmest month at the Lake Tahoe Airport (elevation ) with an average maximum of and an average minimum of . January is the coolest month with an average maximum of and an average minimum of . The all-time maximum of was recorded on July 22, 1988. The all-time minimum of was recorded on December 9, 1972. Temperatures exceed on an average of 2.0 days annually. Minimum temperatures of or lower occur on an average of 231.8 days annually, and minimum temperatures of or lower occur on an average of 7.6 days annually. Freezing temperatures have occurred in every month of the year.


===Ecology===
Vegetation in the basin is dominated by a mixed conifer forest of jeffrey pine (&quot;Pinus jeffreyi&quot;), lodgepole pine (&quot;P. contorta&quot;), white fir (&quot;Abies concolor&quot;), red fir (&quot;A. magnifica&quot;), sugar pine (&quot;P. lambertiana&quot;), California incense-cedar (&quot;Calocedrus decurrens&quot;), ponderosa pine (&quot;P. ponderosa&quot;), and western white pine (&quot;P. monticola&quot;). The basin also contains significant areas of wet meadows and riparian areas, dry meadows, brush fields (with &quot;Arctostaphylos&quot; and &quot;Ceanothus&quot;) and rock outcrop areas, especially at higher elevations. &quot;Ceanothus&quot; is capable of fixing nitrogen, but mountain alder (&quot;Alnus tenuifolia&quot;), which grows along many of the basin&#x27;s streams, springs and seeps, fixes far greater quantities, and contributes measurably to nitrate-N concentrations in some small streams. The beaches of Lake Tahoe are the only known habitat for the rare Lake Tahoe yellowcress (&quot;Rorippa subumbellata&quot;), a plant which grows in the wet sand between low- and high-water marks. Vegetation in the lake itself formerly consisted of native &quot;Chara&quot; and &quot;Gomphoneis&quot; algae and coontail (&quot;Ceratophyllum demersum&quot;), but the later introduction of curlyleaf pondweed (&quot;Potamogeton crispus&quot;), Eurasian watermilfoil (&quot;Myriophyllum spicatum&quot;), and &quot;Zygnema&quot; and &quot;Cladophora&quot; algae has transformed the nearshore environment.

Native fish of the lake include Lahontan cutthroat trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi&quot;), mountain whitefish (&quot;Prosopiurm williamsoni&quot;), Lahontan speckled dace (&quot;Rhinichthys osculus robustus&quot;), Lahontan redside (&quot;Rhinichthys egregious&quot;), Lahontan Lake tui chub (&quot;Siphateles bicolor pectinifer&quot;), Tahoe sucker (&quot;Catostomus tahoensis&quot;), Lahontan mountain sucker (&quot;Catostomus platyrhynchus lahontan&quot;), and Paiute sculpin (&quot;Cottus beldingi&quot;). Most of these fish populations have been significantly reduced due to the introduction of nonnative fish, Asian clam (&quot;Corbicula fluminea&quot;), and mysid shrimp. Competition from introduced fish led cutthroat trout to be completely extirpated from the lake in the early 20th century until reintroduction efforts started in 2019.

Introduced fish species include lake trout (&quot;Salvelinus namaycush&quot;), rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri&quot;), sockeye salmon (&quot;Oncorhyncus nerka&quot;), brown trout (&quot;Salmo trutta&quot;), brook trout (&quot;Salvelinus fontinalis&quot;), common carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;), golden shiner (&quot;Notemigonus crysoleucas&quot;), western mosquitofish (&quot;Gambusia affinis&quot;), bluegill (&quot;Lepomis macrochirus&quot;), black (&quot;Pomoxis nigromaculatus&quot;) and white (&quot;P. annularis&quot;) crappie, largemouth (&quot;Micropterus salmoides&quot;) and smallmouth (&quot;Micropterus dolomieu&quot;) bass, and brown bullhead (&quot;Ameiurus nebulosus&quot;). Each autumn, from late September through mid-October, mature sockeye salmon transform from silver-blue color to a fiery vermilion, and run up Taylor Creek, near South Lake Tahoe. As spawning season approaches the fish acquire a humpback and protuberant jaw. After spawning they die and their carcasses provide a feast for gatherings of mink (&quot;Neogale vison&quot;), bears (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;), and bald eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;). The non-native salmon were transplanted from the North Pacific to Lake Tahoe in 1944.

North American beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;) were re-introduced to the Tahoe Basin by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the U.S. Forest Service between 1934 and 1949. Descended from no more than nine individuals, 1987 beaver populations on the upper and lower Truckee River had reached a density of 0.72 colonies (3.5 beavers) per kilometer. At the present time beaver have been seen in Tahoe Keys, Taylor Creek, Meeks Creek at Meeks Bay on the western shore, and Kings Beach on the north shore, so the descendants of the original nine beavers have apparently migrated around most of Lake Tahoe. Recently novel physical evidence has demonstrated that beaver were native to the Sierra until at least the mid-nineteenth century, via radiocarbon dating of buried beaver dam wood uncovered by deep channel incision in the Feather River watershed. That report was supported by a summary of indirect evidence of beaver including reliable observer accounts of beaver in multiple watersheds from the northern to the southern Sierra Nevada, including its eastern slope. A specific documented record of beaver living historically in Lake Tahoe&#x27;s North Canyon Creek watershed above Glenbrook includes a description of Spooner Meadow rancher Charles Fulstone hiring a caretaker to control the beaver population in the early 20th century. A recent study of Taylor Creek showed that beaver dam removal decreased wetland habitat, increased stream flow, and increased total phosphorus pollutants entering Lake Tahoe – all factors which negatively impact the clarity of the lake&#x27;s water. In addition, beaver dams located in Ward Creek, located on the west shore of Lake Tahoe, were also shown to decrease nutrients and sediments traveling downstream.

The lake&#x27;s low temperatures and extreme depth can slow the decomposition rate of organic matter. For example, the almost perfectly preserved body of a diver was found at a depth of 17 years after he went missing.

==Human history==
===Native peoples===
The area around Lake Tahoe was previously inhabited by the Washoe Native Americans. Lake Tahoe was the center and heart of Washoe Indian territory, including the upper valleys of the Walker, Carson and Truckee Rivers.

Cave Rock is a large rock formation located on the southeastern shore of the lake and considered a sacred site for the Washoe Indians. The Washoe people called Cave Rock &quot;deʔek wadapush&quot; (Washo for Standing Gray Rock). Part of why the Washoe felt the Cave was sacred was due to &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot; a rock formation on the side of the Cave which looks like the profile of a woman&#x27;s face gazing out towards the lake. Washoe ancestors performed religious ceremonies inside the cave. There were significant but ultimately unsuccessful protests from the tribe when a tunnel was blasted through the rock in 1931 for Highway 50.

===Exploration and naming===
Lt. John C. Frémont was the first European-American to see Lake Tahoe, during his second exploratory expedition on February 14, 1844. Fremont named it &quot;Lake Bonpland&quot; after Aimé Bonpland (a French botanist who had accompanied Prussian explorer Alexander von Humboldt in his exploration of Mexico, Colombia and the Amazon River). Lake Bonpland&#x27;s usage never became popular, and the name changed from &quot;Mountain Lake&quot; to &quot;Fremont&#x27;s Lake&quot; several years after. John Calhoun Johnson, Sierra explorer and founder of &quot;Johnson&#x27;s Cutoff&quot; (now U.S. Route 50), named it Fallen Leaf Lake after his Indian guide. Johnson&#x27;s first job in the west was in the government service carrying the mail on snowshoes from Placerville to Nevada City, during which time he named it &quot;Lake Bigler&quot; after California&#x27;s third governor John Bigler. In 1853 William Eddy, the surveyor general of California, identified the lake as Lake Bigler.
The usage never became universal. By the start of the American Civil War in 1861, former Governor Bigler, once a Free Soil Democrat, had become such an ardent Confederate sympathizer that Union advocates objected to the name. Unionists and Republicans alike derided the former governor&#x27;s name on the lake on official state maps. Pro-Union papers called for a &quot;change from this Secesh appellation&quot; and &quot;no Copperhead names on our landmarks for us.&quot; Several Unionist members in the Legislature suggested changing the name to the fanciful sounding &quot;Tula Tulia&quot;. The &quot;Sacramento Union&quot; jokingly suggested the name &quot;Largo Bergler&quot; for Bigler&#x27;s widely perceived financial incompetency in his final term and contemporary Southern sympathies. Within a year, different maps referred to the lake not only as Bigler, but also as &quot;Mountain Lake&quot; and &quot;Maheon Lake&quot;.

The debate took a new direction when William Henry Knight, mapmaker for the federal U.S. Department of the Interior, and colleague Dr. Henry DeGroot of the &quot;Sacramento Union&quot; joined the political argument in 1862. As Knight completed a new map of the lake, the mapmaker asked DeGroot for a new name of the lake. DeGroot suggested &quot;Tahoe&quot;, a local tribal name he believed meant &quot;water in a high place&quot;. Knight agreed, and telegraphed to the Land Office in Washington, D.C., to officially change all federal maps to now read &quot;Lake Tahoe&quot;. Knight later explained his desire for a name change, writing, &quot;I remarked (to many) that people had expressed dissatisfaction with the name &quot;Bigler&quot;, bestowed in honor of a man who had not distinguished himself by any single achievement, and I thought now would be a good time to select an appropriate name and fix it forever on that beautiful sheet of water.&quot;

&quot;Lake Tahoe&quot;, also like &quot;Lake Bigler&quot;, did not gain universal acceptance. Mark Twain, a critic of the new name, called it an &quot;unmusical cognomen&quot;. In an 1864 editorial regarding the name in the Virginia City &quot;Territorial Enterprise&quot;, Twain cited Bigler as being &quot;the legitimate name of the Lake, and it will be retained until some name less flat, insipid and spooney than &quot;Tahoe&quot; is invented for it.&quot; In Twain&#x27;s 1869 novel &quot;Innocents Abroad&quot;, Twain continued to deride the name in his foreign travels. &quot;People say that Tahoe means &#x27;Silver Lake&#x27; – &#x27;Limpid Water&#x27; – &#x27;Falling Leaf.&#x27; Bosh! It means grasshopper soup, the favorite dish of the digger tribe – and of the Paiutes as well.&quot; The Placerville &quot;Mountain Democrat&quot; began a notorious rumor that &quot;Tahoe&quot; was actually an Indian renegade who plundered upon White settlers. To counter the federal government, the California State Legislature reaffirmed in 1870 that the lake was indeed called &quot;Lake Bigler&quot;.

But to most surveys and the general public it was known as Lake Tahoe. By the end of the 19th century &quot;Lake Bigler&quot; had nearly completely fallen out of popular use in favor of &quot;Tahoe&quot;. The California State Legislature reversed its previous decision in 1945, officially changing the name to Lake Tahoe.

===Mining era===
Upon discovery of gold in the South Fork of the American River in 1848, thousands of gold seekers going west passed near the basin on their way to the gold fields. Europeans first impinged upon the Lake Tahoe basin with the 1858 discovery of the Comstock Lode, a silver deposit just to the east in Virginia City, Nevada. From 1858 until about 1890, logging in the basin supplied large timbers to shore up the underground workings of the Comstock mines. The logging was so extensive that loggers cut down almost all of the native forest.

Lake Tahoe became a transportation hub for the surrounding area as mining and logging commenced prior to development of railroads. The first mail delivery was via a sailboat which took a week to visit each of the lakeside communities. The first steamboat on Lake Tahoe was the paddle wheel tugboat &quot;Governor Blasdel&quot; towing log rafts to a sawmill on the south side of Glenbrook Bay from 1863 until her boiler exploded in 1877. The &quot;Truckee&quot; and propeller-driven &quot;Emerald&quot; were also towing log rafts in 1870. J.A. Todman brought steam-powered passenger service to Lake Tahoe in 1872 with the 125-passenger side-wheel steamer &quot;Governor Stanford&quot; which reduced the mail delivery trip around Lake Tahoe to eight hours. Todman expanded service with steamboats &quot;Mamie&quot;, &quot;Niagara&quot;, and &quot;Tod Goodwin&quot;. Lawrence &amp; Comstock provided competition with their steel-hulled steamboat &quot;Tallac&quot; in 1890 and later purchased Todman&#x27;s steamboats &quot;Mamie&quot; and &quot;Tod Goodwin&quot;. The Carson and Tahoe Lumber and Fluming Company purchased the &quot;Niagara&quot; and built the iron-hulled steamboats &quot;Meteor&quot; in 1876 and &quot;Emerald (II)&quot; in 1887. The &quot;Meteor&quot; was the fastest boat on Lake Tahoe with a speed of per hour. Lake Tahoe Railway and Transportation Company dominated the passenger and mail route after launch of their 200-passenger steamboat &quot;Tahoe&quot; on June 24, 1896. The 154-ton &quot;Tahoe&quot; was long with a slender beam so her engines could push her over the lake at 18.5 knots. Lake Tahoe Railway and Transportation Company purchased &quot;Tallac&quot; and rebuilt her as &quot;Nevada&quot; with length increased by to serve as a backup steamboat when &quot;Tahoe&quot; required maintenance.

&quot;Tod Goodwin&quot; burned at Tallac, and most of the other steamboats were retired as the sawmills ran out of trees and people began traveling by automobile. &quot;Niagara&quot; was scrapped at Tahoe City in 1900. &quot;Governor Stanford&quot; was beached at Glenbrook where its boiler was used until 1942 heating cottages at Glenbrook Inn and Ranch. Steamboats continued to carry a mail clerk around Lake Tahoe until 1934, when the mail contract was given to the motorboat &quot;Marian B&quot; powered by two Chevrolet engines. Mail delivery moved ashore after the &quot;Marian B&quot; was lost on May 17, 1941, when her owner and the mail clerk attempted mail delivery during a storm. The &quot;Emerald (II)&quot; left Lake Tahoe in 1935 to become a fishing boat in San Diego. Historic &quot;Tahoe&quot;, &quot;Nevada&quot;, and &quot;Meteor&quot; were purchased with hope they might be preserved; but were scuttled in deep water after deterioration made preservation impractical. The latter two lie in Glenbrook Bay, but &quot;Tahoe&quot; sank in deeper water.

===Development===
Even in the mining era, the potential of the basin as a tourist destination was recognized. Tahoe City was founded in 1864 as a resort community for Virginia City.

Public appreciation of the Tahoe basin grew, and during the 1912, 1913 and 1918 Congressional sessions, congressmen tried unsuccessfully to designate the basin as a national park.

While Lake Tahoe is a natural lake, it is also used for water storage by the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District (TCID). The lake level is controlled by Lake Tahoe Dam built in 1913 at the lake&#x27;s only outlet, the Truckee River, at Tahoe City. The high dam can increase the lake&#x27;s capacity by .

During the first half of the 20th century, development around the lake consisted of a few vacation homes. The post-World War II population and building boom, followed by construction of gambling casinos in the Nevada part of the basin during the mid-1950s, and completion of the interstate highway links for the 1960 Winter Olympics held at Olympic Valley (then known as &quot;Squaw Valley&quot;), resulted in a dramatic increase in development within the basin. From 1960 to 1980, the permanent residential population increased from about 10,000 to greater than 50,000, and the summer population grew from about 10,000 to about 90,000. Since the 1980s, development has slowed due to controls on land use.

===Government and politics===
====Interstate boundary dispute====
Lake Tahoe is divided by the prominent interstate boundary between California and Nevada, where the two states&#x27; edges make their iconic directional turn near the middle of the lake. This boundary has been disputed since the mid-nineteenth century.

As part of the compromise of 1850, California was speedily admitted to the Union. In doing so, Congress approved the California Constitution which defined the state&#x27;s boundary in reference to geographical coordinates. This includes the section of the 120th meridian that is between the 42nd parallel at the Oregon border to the 39th parallel amid Lake Tahoe, and an oblique line continuing from that point southward to where the Colorado River crosses the 35th parallel. Fourteen years later, Congress approved the Nevada Constitution when it was admitted as a state in 1864, which defined its western border at the forty third degree of Longitude West from Washington, D.C., and its southwestern border along the oblique section of the boundary line of California. While 43 degrees of longitude west from the Washington Meridian does not really coincide with the 120 degrees longitude west of Greenwich, the 1864 Congress was of the belief that the two lines were identical; the former was abandoned nationally in 1884. The centuries long dispute that erupted began with boundary discrepancies across many surveys within which were valuable mineral deposits; Nevada also had a wish that California would assent to cede its land east of the pacific crest as had been preauthorized by Congress in 1850. The first consequential attempt to mark the California-Nevada boundary was the 1863 J.F. Houghton and Butler Ives line. An 1867–1868 survey of the California-Oregon border by Daniel G. Major for the United States General Land Office found the 120th meridian more than two miles west of the prior line, so it was followed by the 1872 survey by Alexey W. Von Schmidt. Against initial instructions, Von Schmidt began his survey with the 1872 California-Nevada State Boundary Marker which was six-tenths of a mile east of the Houghton-Ives line. When he discovered the Colorado River had shifted at the 35th parallel, he simply changed the endpoint resulting in a survey that was neither straight nor accurate. Substantial doubts led Congress in 1892 to fund the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey to remark the oblique line. This new survey found the Von Schmidt line to be 1,600 to 1,800 feet too far west, but both surveys were then used by both states. Unsurprisingly, the combination of the 1893 C.G.S. survey&#x27;s oblique line and Schmidt&#x27;s well marked north–south line do not intersect precisely at the 39th parallel as mandated by the California Constitution. Congress does not have the constitutional power to unilaterally move state boundaries.

The wealth in natural resources between the Sierra Crest and the easternmost sections of survey lines created a powerful source for conflict. Major mining sites in the Tahoe area were in disputed territory. In a striking display of opportunism which ostensibly occurred because the boundary was still &quot;officially&quot; unsurveyed, settlers arrogated parts of California up to the irregular Sierra Crest tens of miles east of the boundary—defined over six years prior—in an attempt to create Nataqua Territory. An armed skirmish known as the Sagebrush War included gunshots exchanged between militia. Even after six surveys, conflict remained over which of them, if any, were legally binding in marking the boundary; this was partially heard by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1980, where the doctrine of acquiescence was invoked.

A boundary defined in terms of geographical coordinates is theoretically precise, but poses pragmatic challenges to implement. Where a particular coordinate actually lies on the surface of the earth is dependent on the figure of the Earth. In the mid-1800s the Bessel ellipsoid of 1841 or the Clarke ellipsoid of 1866 were widely used; the Hayford ellipsoid of 1910 may later have been used by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. The standard ellipsoid for western states in 1849—which is generally congruent with that year&#x27;s version of the Astronomical Almanac—is implicit in California&#x27;s constitutional boundary definition; incessant invention of new datums by new and potentially interested parties do not re-render the old boundary definition. Holding assumptions of the earth back-in-time, modern satellite assisted survey techniques can determine location and transform them onto old ellipsoids to within a centimeter. Celestial navigation techniques by contrast, are accurate up to two-fifths of a mile; uncertainty in the latter was known, but precision then was unobtainable.

The legacy of this dispute continues. There is an official federal obelisk-shaped monument marking the oblique California border, which is now surrounded by Edgewood Tahoe golf resort that is claimed and taxed by Nevada. A federal survey monument was removed to the Lake Tahoe Historical Society circa 2018. The Von Schmidt line crosses US 50 on the west edge of present-day Applebee&#x27;s, and the east edge of the Marcus Ashley Gallery in Tahoe Crescent V Shopping Center. The Nevada community of Stateline has been moved east.

The boundary splits Lake Tahoe unevenly, with two-thirds in California and one-third in Nevada. In California, Lake Tahoe is divided between Placer County and El Dorado County. In Nevada, Lake Tahoe is divided among Washoe County, Douglas County and Carson City (an independent city).

====Shorezone and beach ownership====
Lake Tahoe is a U.S. Navigable Waterway, under federal jurisdiction, and the public is allowed to occupy any watercraft as close to any shore as the craft is navigable. Public capacity to navigate across any land formerly inundated by the waterway is not extinguished by the lowering of the lake level; this federal easement is maintained under United States law. Because small fluctuations in the height of the shoreline can result in substantive temporal immersions by the lake surface, the irreversible public easement slowly grows larger in size.

While the submerged lands generally belong to the state, the water held in the lake is federally controlled by the US Bureau of Reclamation, and immersion of the shoreline itself would be a common law trespass against east lakefront property owners if it were not for the land—below the theoretical maximum elevation of the lake—being in a perpetual federal easement. Neither state has the authority to rescind navigability along the shoreline below the highmark of the waterbody, because it has been granted under federal law through the Enumerated powers of the United States. The entire waterbody is navigable; it is common for the majority of users to be operating negligible draft one-person craft such as kayaks and standup paddleboards. The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency does not have the authority to override existing federal law even if it was also created by Congress.

Like the interstate boundary itself, the high watermark has been disputed as well. The theoretical maximum elevation of the lake is , using the Lake Tahoe datum. The yearly maximum is commonly lower. Strong winds across the lake&#x27;s substantial fetch can create a surge which further lifts the high-water line on leeward shores, known as a seiche.

=====California side=====
On the California side, the shorezone is expressly maintained in a constitutionally and statutorily protected public trust, analogous to an easement, which is managed by the California State Lands Commission and under a concurrent federal easement. As public land, the shorezone on this side may be used for nearly any purpose, rather than just travel. Upland owner is not entitled to utilize their land subject to public trust in any manner incompatible with public&#x27;s interest in the property—which includes broad recreational uses. Owner is akin to a trustee of public trust for benefit of all the people, and as such has fiduciary responsibilities to the beneficiaries; state remains trustee with duty to supervise trust. It is a crime for anyone who hinders, prevents, or obstructs free passage over the state lands, trusts, easements, or federal public easement.

Building new piers can infringe on the public trust, which among many things, is purposed to preserve the land in its natural state. Accretions created in the shorezone by artificial means remain as public land because they are part of the public trust. The private Lakeside Park Association has made such an artificial accretion of land that is freely open for public use. Access to and from the shorezone across private land on publicly enjoyed paths is by right-of-way or prescriptive easement. Recent attempts by Lakefront Homeowners to use piers as &quot;easement fences&quot; to obstruct beach travel are encroaching centuries of established easement and admiralty law.

=====Nevada side=====
The accessibility of the Nevada beach-land below the high watermark has been the source of practical rather than legal controversy. The land is a public trust or easement under the Rivers and Harbors Act, the Submerged Lands Act, the several Coast Guard Authorization Acts, but affluent beachfront landowners and their elected civic leaders maintain the land is effectively private under state law because state law enforcement is not charged with enforcing federal law. They dispute the high water mark itself by arguing that the state of Nevada has not agreed to either a highwater level or datum with California and the US. Some Civic leaders for the Nevada shore have been pushing a frivolous states rights theory of property law—which intermittently nullifies federal easements whenever the lake level recedes—which has never been tested in federal court. Instilling public fear of criminal trespassing is the core goal under the theory, which if actually prosecuted would be a risky power play. The sheriffs in Nevada are elected officials; false arrest can lead to an official&#x27;s imprisonment and cost their electorate hundreds of thousands of dollars. To be convicted of trespassing, one must be beyond reasonable doubt above the highwater mark, which under their states rights theory is an arbitrary fact to be found. The land is concurrently claimed by the Nevada Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (Nevada Division of State Lands). It is a crime to prevent or obstruct use of Nevada state lands.

====Protection====
As the population grew and development expanded in the 1960s, the question of protecting the lake became more imperative. In 1969, the U.S. Congress and the California and Nevada State Legislatures created a unique compact to share resources and responsibilities. The Compact established the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA), a bi-state agency charged with environmental protection of the Basin through land-use regulation and planning. In 1980, the U.S. Congress amended the Compact with public law 96-551. The law designated a new agency, the Tahoe Transportation District (TTD), to facilitate and implement Basin and regional transportation improvements/additions for the protection, restoration and use of the lake. Schisms between both agencies and local residents have led to the formation of grass-roots organizations that hold to even stricter environmentalism.

===Historical locations===
Lake Tahoe is also the location of several 19th and 20th century palatial homes of historical significance. The Thunderbird Lodge built by George Whittel Jr once included nearly of the Nevada shoreline. Vikingsholm was the original settlement on Emerald Bay and included an island teahouse and a 38-room home. The Ehrman Mansion is a summer home built by a former Wells Fargo president in Sugar Pine Point and is now a state park. The Pony Express had a route that went from Genoa Station over Daggett Pass to Friday&#x27;s Station and Yanks Station; it succeeded the route through Woodford&#x27;s Station and Fountain Place Station both on the way to Strawberry Station.

==Environmental issues==

===Water quality===
Despite land-use planning and export of treated sewage effluent from the basin, the lake is becoming increasingly eutrophic (having an excessive richness of nutrients), with primary productivity increasing by more than 5% annually, and clarity decreasing at an average rate of per year. Until the early 1980s, nutrient-limitation studies showed that primary productivity in the lake was nitrogen-limited. Now, after a half-century of accelerated nitrogen input (much of it from direct atmospheric deposition), the lake is phosphorus limited. Theodore Swift et al., concluded that &quot;suspended inorganic sediments and phytoplanktonic algae both contribute significantly to the reduction in clarity, and that suspended particulate matter, rather than dissolved organic matter, are the dominant causes of clarity loss.&quot; The largest source of fine sediment particles to Lake Tahoe is urban stormwater runoff, constituting 72 percent of the total fine sediment particle load. Recent research has shown that the urban uplands also provide the largest opportunity to reduce fine sediment particle and phosphorus contributions to the lake. Historic clarity of approximately can be achieved with total reduction of approximately 75 percent from urban sources.

Historically, the clarity of Lake Tahoe continued to decrease through 2010, when the average Secchi depth, , was the second lowest ever recorded (the lowest was in 1997). This represented a decrease of from the previous year. However, the lake&#x27;s clarity increased from 2011 to 2014, improving by nearly 20 percent.

A water quality study by the Lahontan Water Quality Control Board and the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection determined the largest source of fine sediment particles: 71 percent is developed area (urban) erosion and run-off, much of it associated with transportation infrastructure and services.

Lake Tahoe is a tributary watershed drainage element within the Truckee River Basin, and its sole outlet is the Truckee River, which continues on to discharge to Pyramid Lake. Because of the sensitivity of Truckee River water quality (involving two protected species, the cui-ui sucker fish and the Lahontan cutthroat trout), this drainage basin has been studied extensively. The primary investigations were stimulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which funded the development of the DSSAM model to analyze water quality below Lake Tahoe.

Lake Tahoe never freezes. Since 1970, it has mixed to a depth of at least a total of six or seven times. Dissolved oxygen is relatively high from top to bottom. Analysis of the temperature records in Lake Tahoe has shown that the lake warmed (between 1969 and 2002) at an average rate of per year. The warming is caused primarily by increasing air temperatures, and secondarily by increasing downward long-wave radiation. The warming trend is reducing the frequency of deep mixing in the lake and may have important effects on water clarity and nutrient cycling.

===Ecosystem changes===
Since the 1960s, the Lake&#x27;s food web and zooplankton populations have undergone major changes. In 1963–65, opossum shrimp (&quot;Mysis diluviana&quot;) were introduced to enhance the food supply for the introduced Kokanee salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus nerka&quot;). The shrimp began feeding on the lake&#x27;s cladocerans (&quot;Daphnia&quot; and &quot;Bosmina&quot;), and their populations virtually disappeared by 1971. The shrimp provide a food resource for salmon and trout, but also compete with juvenile fish for zooplankton. Since the 1970s, the cladoceran populations have somewhat recovered, but not to former levels. Since 2006, goldfish have been observed in the lake, where they have grown to &quot;giant size&quot;. An invasive species, they may have descended from former pets which owners dumped, or when used as fishing bait.

In June 2007, the Angora Fire burned approximately throughout the South Lake Tahoe area. While the impact of ash on the lake&#x27;s ecosystem is predicted to be minimal, the impact of potential future erosion is not yet known.

===Environmental protection===
Construction activities have resulted in a clouding of the lake&#x27;s blue waters. Currently, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is regulating construction along the shoreline (and has won two Federal Supreme Court battles over recent decisions). These regulations are unpopular with many residents, especially those in the Tahoe Lakefront Homeowners Association.

The League to Save Lake Tahoe (Keep Tahoe Blue) has been an environmental watchdog in the Lake Tahoe Basin for 50 years. Founded when a proposal to build a four-lane highway around the lake—with a bridge over the entrance to Emerald Bay—was proposed in 1957, the League has opposed many development projects in the area, which it alleges were environmentally harmful. The League embraces responsible and diversified use of the Lake&#x27;s resources while protecting and restoring its natural attributes.

Since 1980, the Lake Tahoe Interagency Monitoring Program (LTIMP) has been measuring stream discharge and concentrations of nutrients and sediment in up to 10 tributary streams in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California-Nevada. The objectives of the LTIMP are to acquire and disseminate the water quality information necessary to support science-based environmental planning and decision making in the basin. The LTIMP is a cooperative program with support from 12 federal and state agencies with interests in the Tahoe Basin. This data set, together with more recently acquired data on urban runoff water quality, is being used by the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board to develop a program (mandated by the Clean Water Act) to limit the flux of nutrients and fine sediment to the Lake.

Microplastics were found for the first time in 2019 by the Desert Research Institute. This pollution in the water could be local or from locations around the world as particles from discarded plastic products can be transported long distances through the atmosphere by wind, rain and falling snow. In 2023, updated measurements of microplastics in the lake revealed that Lake Tahoe contained some of the highest microplastic pollution concentrations found among 38 lakes and reservoirs measured. Restoring the Lake Depths Foundation uses a BlueROV2 to survey the bottom of Lake Tahoe in an organized grid pattern to remove microplastics and trash.

The UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center is dedicated to research, education and public outreach, and to providing objective scientific information for restoration and sustainable use of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Each year, it produces a &quot;State of the Lake&quot; report, assessing changes such as lake clarity, nutrients and particles, or meteorology around the lake.
==Tourism==
Much of the area surrounding Lake Tahoe is devoted to the tourism industry and there are many restaurants, ski slopes, golf courses and casinos catering to visitors. The Nevada side of Tahoe provides additional tourist amenities due to Nevada&#x27;s legal gambling, lower regulatory environment and tax burden than California. Nevada also had fewer restrictions than California during the COVID-19 Pandemic which resulted in California hotels suffering economically while the Nevada casinos were described as &quot;living large&quot;.

===Winter sports===

During ski season, thousands of people from all over Nevada and California, including Reno, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, and Sacramento, flock to the slopes for downhill skiing. Lake Tahoe, in addition to its panoramic beauty, is well known for its blizzards.

Lake Tahoe is home to 15 ski areas and some of the major ski areas include:
* Heavenly Mountain Resort: the largest ski area in California and Nevada, located near Stateline on the South Shore
* Palisades Tahoe: the second largest ski area, known for its hosting of the 1960 Winter Olympics, located near Tahoe City
* Alpine Meadows: a medium-sized ski area on the north shore only a few miles from Olympic Valley and operated as part of Palisades Tahoe
* Diamond Peak: a small ski area located in Incline Village, Nevada
* Northstar California: a popular north shore ski area, known for its consistently rated top 10 North American terrain park
* Kirkwood Mountain Resort: a ski area which gets more snow than any other ski area in the Tahoe region
* Sierra-at-Tahoe: a medium-sized south shore ski area
* Boreal Mountain Resort: a small ski area on Donner Pass
* Sugar Bowl Ski Resort: a medium-sized ski area on Donner Pass
* Donner Ski Ranch: a very small ski area on Donner Pass
* Homewood Mountain Resort: a medium-sized ski area on the west shore
* Mount Rose Ski Resort: a medium-sized ski area north-east of the Lake, on Slide Mountain

The majority of the ski resorts in the Lake Tahoe region are on the northern end of the lake, near Truckee, California and Reno, Nevada. Kirkwood, Sierra-at-Tahoe and Heavenly are located on the southern side of the lake, from Reno.
Scattered throughout Tahoe are public and private sled parks. Some, such as Granlibakken are equipped with rope tows to help sledders get up the hill.

Many ski areas around Tahoe also have snow tubing, such as Olympic Valley. Throughout Tahoe, cross-country skiing, snowmobile riding and snowshoeing are also popular.

The NHL hosted 2 outdoor games at Lake Tahoe in 2021.

===Water sports===

During late Spring to early Fall, the lake is popular for water sports and beach activities. The two cities most identified with the Lake Tahoe tourist area are South Lake Tahoe, California and the smaller Stateline; smaller centers on the northern shoreline include Tahoe City and Kings Beach.

Other popular activities include parasailing, jet ski rentals, eco-friendly paddle sport rentals and fishing. There are rental locations around Lake Tahoe. Kayaking and stand-up paddle boards have also become very popular.

Boating is a primary activity in Tahoe in the summer. The lake is home to one of the most prestigious wooden boat shows in the country, the Lake Tahoe Concours d&#x27;Elegance, held every August. There are lake front restaurants all over the lake, most equipped with docks and buoys. There are all sorts of boating events, such as sailboat racing, firework shows over the lake, guided cruises, and more. As an interstate waterway, Lake Tahoe is subject to the United States Coast Guard. Lake Tahoe is home to Coast Guard Station Lake Tahoe.

SCUBA diving is popular at Lake Tahoe, with some dive sites offering dramatic drop-offs or wall dives. Diving at Lake Tahoe is considered advanced due to the increased risk of decompression sickness (DCS) while diving at such a high altitude.

Fred Rogers became the first person to swim the length of Lake Tahoe in 1955, and Erline Christopherson became the first woman to do so in 1962.

=== Motorcycling ===

The lake and its scenic environs provide many opportunities for motorcyclists to ride both on and off-road. The most popular circuit that goes around the lake runs clockwise and starts in South Lake Tahoe on the California side. Riding north via route 89 allows riders to pull over to the right to admire the views without crossing traffic. Continuing onto highway 28 East, and finally, onto US-50 West will complete the full tour. Doing it in reverse allows experiencing the views from a different perspective. Kingsbury Grade (highway 207) is another popular route with local motorcyclists. It is only 11 miles long from South Lake Tahoe to Mottsville and can also be ridden in both directions. Some of the most scenic motorcycling stops and views around the lake:
* Emerald Bay – southwest Lake Tahoe, off Highway 89
* Fallen Leaf Lake – 6 miles southwest of South Lake, via Highway 89
* Zephyr Cove – 6 miles north of South Lake, off Highway 50
* Cave Rock – 9 miles north of South Lake, off Highway 50
* Sand Harbor – northwest Lake Tahoe, off Highway 28
* Kings Beach – North Lake Tahoe, off Highway 28
* Donner Lake – 21 miles north of Lake Tahoe, off I-80

===Hiking and bicycling===
There are numerous hiking and mountain biking trails around the lake. They range widely in length, difficulty and popularity. One of the most famous of Tahoe&#x27;s trails is the Tahoe Rim Trail, a 165-mile (270-km) trail that circumnavigates the lake. Directly to the west of the lake is the Granite Chief Wilderness, which provides great hiking and wilderness camping. Also, to the southwest is the very popular Desolation Wilderness. One of the most popular trailheads used to access these popular destinations is Eagle Lake trailhead, located near Emerald Bay on Tahoe&#x27;s west shore. The Flume Trail of the east shore is one of Mountain Biking Magazine&#x27;s Top 10 Trails in the U.S. There are also many paved off-road bicycle paths that meander through communities on all sides of the lake.

===Gambling===

Gambling is legal on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe. Casinos, each with a variety of slot machines and table games are available. Four are located on the South Shore in Stateline, and four on the North Shore; three in Crystal Bay and one in Incline Village.

When Nevada legalized gambling in 1931, the first casino at the lake had already been open for years. First built on the North Shore in Crystal Bay by Robert Sherman in 1926, the Cal-Neva Lodge became the property of Norman Henry Biltz and was sold to Bill Graham and Jim McKay in 1929.

The Cal-Neva was rebuilt after a fire in 1937 and expanded several times, most noticeably in 1969 when the high-rise hotel was built. Along the way, Frank Sinatra owned the property in the early 1960s, shared his cabins with the likes of Sam Giancana and Marilyn Monroe, and sold out at the height of the area&#x27;s popularity.

Other casinos at the North Shore include the Crystal Bay Club, first built in 1937 as the Ta-Neva-Ho; the defunct Tahoe Biltmore, and the Nugget. The Hyatt Regency is found at Incline Village.

At South Shore, Bill Harrah purchased the Stateline Country Club, which had stood since 1931 and built Harrah&#x27;s Tahoe. Other casinos include Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Lake Tahoe, Harveys Lake Tahoe, and Bally&#x27;s Lake Tahoe.

==Transportation==
Lake Tahoe can be reached directly by car and bus, and indirectly by train or air. The nearest passenger train service is the Amtrak station in Truckee, and is served by Amtrak&#x27;s train, the &quot;California Zephyr&quot;, which runs daily between Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area. An Amtrak Thruway bus also connects South Lake Tahoe to the &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot; in Sacramento. The closest scheduled passenger airline service is available via the Reno-Tahoe International Airport (RNO).

The Tahoe Transportation District provides fare-free local mass transit in and around South Lake Tahoe and connects the basin to the Carson Valley and Carson City, and Tahoe Truckee Area Regional Transit (TART) serves the north and northwest shores of the lake, also connecting to Truckee and Amtrak.

===Highways===
Visitors can reach Lake Tahoe under ideal conditions within two hours from the Sacramento area, one hour from Reno or thirty minutes from Carson City. In winter months, chains or snow tires are often necessary to reach Tahoe from any direction. Traffic can be heavy on weekends due to tourists if not also from weather.

The primary routes to Lake Tahoe are on Interstate 80 via Truckee, U.S. Route 50, and Nevada State Route 431 via Reno. Most of the highways accessing and encircling Lake Tahoe are paved two-lane mountain roads. US 50 is a four-lane highway (from the canyon of the South Fork American River at Riverton, over the Sierra Nevada at Echo Summit, and into the Lake Tahoe Basin, is a mainly two-lane road) passing south of the lake and along part of the eastern shore.

California State Route 89 follows the western shore of the lake through the picturesque wilderness and connects camping, fishing and hiking locations such as those at Emerald Bay State Park, DL Bliss State Park and Camp Richardson. Farther along are communities such as Meeks Bay and Tahoe City. Finally, the highway turns away from the lake and heads northwest toward Truckee.

California State Route 28 completes the circuit from Tahoe City around the northern shore to communities such as Kings Beach, Crystal Bay, and into Incline Village, Nevada where the road becomes Nevada State Route 28. Route 28 returns along the eastern shore to US 50 near Spooner Lake.

== Folklore ==
Lake Tahoe is home to various legends that have been passed down through local Native American traditions and other sources. These include stories about Water Babies, the Ong, Tahoe Tessie, and the Ghosts of Fannette Island.

=== Water Babies ===

In Washoe tradition, Water Babies are powerful spirits believed to inhabit bodies of water including those of Lake Tahoe. They were thought to have the ability to cause harm or even death. Washoe healers would visit sacred places, such as Cave Rock, to consult with the Water Babies, bringing offerings in the hope of gaining their favor and strength.

=== Ong ===

The Ong is a figure from Washoe legend, described as a large bird that lived in Lake Tahoe. It was said to prey on animals and humans. One legend recounts that a young man named Tahoe was captured by the Ong but managed to escape by feeding it poisoned arrowheads. The bird was believed to have died and sunk into the lake.

=== Tahoe Tessie ===

Tahoe Tessie is a reported creature said to live in Lake Tahoe. Descriptions of Tessie resemble those of other lake monsters, such as the Loch Ness Monster, with many believing it to be a large aquatic animal, potentially a sturgeon.

=== Ghosts of Fannette Island ===
Fannette Island in Emerald Bay is purportedly haunted by the ghost of Captain Richard Barter, a man who lived on the island in the late 1800s. He died while returning to the island in 1873, and some local stories claim that his ghost can be seen wandering the island.

==In the media==
The Ponderosa Ranch of the TV series &quot;Bonanza&quot; was formerly located on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe. The opening sequence of the TV series was filmed at the McFaul Creek Meadow, with Mount Tallac in the background. In September 2004 the Ponderosa Ranch closed its doors, after being sold to developer David Duffield for an undisclosed price.

The 1974 film &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; used the lakeside estate Fleur de Lac as the location of several scenes, including the elaborate First Communion celebration, the Senator&#x27;s shakedown attempt of Michael, the assassination attempt on Michael, Michael disowning Fredo, Carmela Corleone&#x27;s funeral, Fredo&#x27;s execution while fishing, and the closing scene of Michael sitting alone outside. Fleur de Lac, on the western California shore of Lake Tahoe, was formerly the Henry Kaiser estate. The surrounding lakeside area has been developed into a private gated condominium community and some of the buildings of the &quot;Corleone compound&quot; still exist, including the boathouse.

The 2014 film &quot;Last Weekend&quot;, starring Patricia Clarkson and directed by Tom Dolby and Tom Williams, used the west shore lakefront home of Ray and Dagmar Dolby as the primary location for its interiors and exteriors. The house, built in 1929, was also the site for the exteriors for &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot;, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift. The 1988 film &quot;Things Change&quot; was also filmed here.

British rock band A&#x27;s song &quot;Here We Go Again (I Love Lake Tahoe)&quot; and the accompanying music video centers around the band&#x27;s love for the lake and the surrounding holiday locations.

The lake is mentioned in the lyrics to the song &quot;Unfair&quot; by cult indie rock band Pavement.

The lake is the setting for Kate Bush&#x27;s song of the same name from the album 50 Words for Snow. In the song, a woman who drowned in the lake is reunited with her beloved dog in the afterlife. The song was accompanied by a video written and directed by Bush.

<text>In archaeology, a lithic flake is a &quot;portion of rock removed from an objective piece by percussion or pressure,&quot; and may also be referred to as simply a &quot;flake&quot;, or collectively as debitage. The objective piece, or the rock being reduced by the removal of flakes, is known as a core. Once the proper tool stone has been selected, a percussor or pressure flaker (e.g., an antler tine) is used to direct a sharp blow, or apply sufficient force, respectively, to the surface of the stone, often on the edge of the piece. The energy of this blow propagates through the material, often (but not always) producing a Hertzian cone of force which causes the rock to fracture in a controllable fashion. Since cores are often struck on an edge with a suitable angle (&lt;90°) for flake propagation, the result is that only a portion of the Hertzian cone is created. The process continues as the flintknapper detaches the desired number of flakes from the core, which is marked with the negative scars of these removals. The surface area of the core which received the blows necessary for detaching the flakes is referred to as the striking platform.

==Production==

Flakes may be produced by a variety of means. Force may be introduced by direct percussion (striking the core with a percussor such as a rock or antler), indirect percussion (striking the core with an object, sometimes referred to as a &quot;punch&quot;, which itself is struck by a percussor, similar to the use of a hammer and chisel to shape stone), or by pressure. Additionally, flakes may be initiated in a Hertzian, bending, or wedging fashion. When a flake is detached from its core in a Hertzian fashion, the flake propagates in a conchoidal manner from the point of impact or pressure, usually producing a partial Hertzian cone. The cone of force often leaves a distinctive bulb of applied force on the flake and a corresponding flake scar on the core. A bending initiation results when a flake initiates not at the point where the force was applied, but rather further away from the edge of the core, resulting in a flake with no Hertzian cone or bulb of applied force and few if any of the characteristics ripples or undulations seen on the ventral surface of conchoidally produced flakes. Wedging initiation is the result of a strong hammer blow. At impact, concentric radii emanate from the point of percussion, but unlike conchoidal fracture, the force travels along what would be the center of the Hertzian cone. The bipolar reduction technique is typified by its use of wedge initiation. Like bending initiation, no bulb of applied force results from wedging initiation, although in the bipolar technique, flakes may appear to have two points of percussion, on opposite ends, because the core has been fractured by a hammer and anvil technique. The core is placed on a hard surface or &quot;anvil&quot; and is struck above by a hammer, thus the fracture may propagate from both ends simultaneously.

The end which received the blow or pressure is referred to as the proximal end of the flake; the terminal end is referred to as the distal end. The side displaying the bulb of force but without flake scars (barring an errailure flake scar or additional working of the flake) is called the ventral (or interior) surface, while the opposite side, displaying the flake scars of previous removals, or the cortical or original rock surface, is the dorsal (or exterior) surface.

On most natural cobbles or nodules of source material, a weathered outer rind called a cortex covers the unweathered inner material. Flakes are often differentiated by the amount of cortex present on their dorsal surfaces, because the amount of cortex indicates when in the sequence of reduction the flake came from. Primary flakes are those whose dorsal surfaces are entirely covered with cortex; secondary flakes have at least a trace of cortex on the dorsal surface; and tertiary (interior) flakes lack cortex, having derived entirely from the interior of the core. Primary flakes and secondary flakes are usually associated with the initial stages of lithic reduction, while tertiary flakes are more likely to be associated with retouching and bifacial reduction activities.

Prominent bulbs of force generally indicate that a hard hammer percussor (hammerstone) was used to detach the flake; flakes displaying this characteristic are referred to as conchoidal flakes. Hard hammer flakes are indicative of primary reduction strategies (e.g., core reduction, roughing of blanks and preforms, and the like). More moderate and diffuse bulbs may indicate the use of a soft hammer percussor—such as bone, wood, or antler—which produces the bending flakes often associated with bifacial thinning and trimming. The relative abundance of each type of flake can indicate what sort of lithic work was going on at a particular spot at a particular point in time.

A blade is defined as a flake with parallel or subparallel margins that is usually at least twice as long as it is wide. There are numerous specialized types of blade flakes. Channel flakes are characteristic flakes caused by the fluting of certain Paleo-Indian projectile points; such fluting produced grooves in the projectile points which may have facilitated hafting. Prismatic blades are long, narrow specialized blades with parallel margins which may be removed from polyhedral blade cores, another common lithic feature of Paleo-Indian lithic culture. Prismatic blades are often triangular in cross section with several facets or flake scars on the dorsal surface. Prismatic blades begin to appear in high frequencies during the transition between the Middle and Upper Paleolithic.This lithic technology basically replaces the Levallois reduction technology.

==Other flake characteristics==
The striking platform is the point on the proximal portion of the flake on which the detachment blow fell or pressure was placed. This may be natural or prepared. Termination type is a characteristic indicating the manner in which the distal end of a flake detached from a core. Flake terminations may be feathered, hinged, stepped, or plunging (also known as overshot or &quot;outrepassé&quot;). Feathered terminations are often very sharp, as the flake gradually reduces to a very fine thickness before the force exits the core and removes the flake. Hinged terminations are the result of the force rolling away from the core, resulting in a rounded distal end. Step terminations result when a flake prematurely breaks or snaps during removal, leaving a distal end that is often squared off. Plunging flakes are the result of the force rolling back towards the core and often taking off its &quot;bottom&quot;. Hinge, step, and plunging terminations, although sometimes deliberately formed, are usually errors called &quot;abrupt terminations&quot;. Abrupt terminations are often indicative of internal flaws in a core or previously formed Hertzian cones on the surface. Eraillures, also referred to as &quot;bulbar scars&quot;, are tiny flake scars that appear on some bulbs of applied force. The reason they form is not entirely understood. Of those flakes that do exhibit eraillures, very few have more than one.

Secondary and tertiary flakes display dorsal flake scars, which are simply the markings left behind by flakes detached prior to the detachment of the subject flake. These flake scars are one of the lines of evidence used to infer the method of lithic reduction, or the process by which raw material is turned into useful objects.

===Tools===

Flakes can be modified into formal tools, which result from additional working of the piece to shape a flake into a desired form, or they can be used without further modification, and are then referred to as expedient tools. For example, scrapers, which may be made by additional removals, known as retouchings, to the edge of a piece, or burins, which are created by a burin blow on the tip of a blade which produces a chisel-like edge which may have been used for graving and carving wood or bone. Because they require less labor to create, expedient flakes can be used strategically as a useful tool for a situation that does not necessarily require a sharpened tool necessary for cutting.

<text>In lithic analysis, a subdivision of archaeology, a bulb of applied force (also known as a bulb of percussion or simply bulb of force) is a defining characteristic of a lithic flake. Bulb of applied force was first correctly described by Sir John Evans, the cofounder of prehistoric archeology. However, bulb of percussion was coined scientifically by W.J. Sollas. When a flake is detached from its parent core, a portion of the Hertzian cone of force caused by the detachment blow is detached with it, leaving a distinctive bulb on the flake and a corresponding flake scar on the core. In the case of a unidirectional core, the bulb of applied force is produced by an initiated crack formed at the point of contact, which begins producing the Hertzian cone. The outward pressure increases causing the crack to curve away from the core and the bulb formation. The bulb of applied force forms below the striking platform as a slight bulge. If the flake is completely crushed the bulb will not be visible. Bulbs of applied force may be distinctive, moderate, or diffuse, depending upon the force of the blow used to detach the flake, and upon the type of material used as a fabricator. The bulb of applied force can indicate the mass or density of the tool used in the application of the force. The bulb may also be an indication of the angle of the force. This information is helpful to archaeologists in understanding and recreating the process of flintknapping. Generally, the harder the material used as a fabricator, the more distinctive the bulb of applied force. Soft hammer percussion has a low diffuse bulb while hard hammer percussion usually leaves a more distinct and noticeable bulb of applied force. Pressure flake also allowed for diffuse bulbs. The bulb of percussion of a flake or blade is convex and the core has a corresponding concave bulb. The concave bulb on the core is known as the negative bulb of percussion. Bulbs of applied force are not usually present if the flake has been struck off naturally. This allows archaeologists to identify and distinguish natural breakage from human artistry. The three main bulb types are flat or nondescript, normal, and pronounced. A flat or nondescript bulb is poorly defined and does not rise up on the ventral surface. A normal bulb on the ventral side has average height and well-defined. A pronounced bulb rises up on ventral side and is very large.

When explained visually, the bulb of percussion is visible on the ventral face as opposed to the dorsal face (where it is smoother) and considered to be on the &quot;inside&quot; of the parent core. The bulb of percussion is the primary feature that identifies the ventral surface of a flake or blade artifact. Locating its position reveals which is the proximal end of an artifact. Along the proximal end there may be the formation of ripple marks. These ripple marks allow for the direction traveled by the applied force through the lithic when it was detached. Typically, the striking of the flake is produced by knapping (or flintknapping), a process in which requires the user to chip away material from high-silica stones like &quot;flint&quot; in a carefully controlled manner with special tools to produce sharp projectile points or tools. A common characteristic that is associated with the bulb of applied force is a bulbar scar. This scar is from a small chip or flake on the bulb. This is known as an eraillure flake scar. It is produced during the initial impact of flake removal. Occasionally, there is more than one contact point on a striking platform which creates a series of superimposed waves. The eraillure flake is a chip removed through contact of a dominant force wave that creates the conchoidal flake and inferior waves. Bulb of applied force is not produced by bipolar technology or wedging initiation.

<doc id="140905" wikidata="Q1992523" url="?curid=140905" title="J. Jonah Jameson">
<text>John Jonah Jameson Jr. is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, most commonly in association with the superhero Spider-Man. The character was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, and he first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; issue #1 (March 1963).

Jameson is typically depicted as the publisher or editor-in-chief of the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;, a fictional New York City newspaper. Recognizable by his toothbrush moustache, flattop haircut, and ever-present cigar, he carries out a smear campaign against Spider-Man (and to a lesser extent, other superheroes such as Daredevil and the Avengers), frequently referring to him as a &quot;menace&quot; and a criminal, but occasionally and reluctantly allying with him. This usually stems from his deep-seated belief in law enforcement and government agencies. Jameson thus despises superheroes for working outside the system. In the early comics as well as most media interpretations, he employs photojournalist Peter Parker to take pictures of Spider-Man in the hopes of catching him in the middle of wrongdoing, unaware that Peter is the superhero himself. Over the course of the comics, Jameson has done various other jobs, such as being the Mayor of New York City for several years before resigning. Peter has revealed his identity to Jameson twice: first during the &quot;Civil War&quot; event, which was undone by the events of &quot;One More Day&quot;; and the second time years later, which caused him to finally give up his crusade on Spider-Man and become a permanent ally and advocate of him.

Portrayals of Jameson in both the comics and external media have varied throughout the years. Sometimes he is shown as a foolishly grumpy, stubborn and pompous demagogue and micromanager whose resentment of Spider-Man is actually a thinly-veiled exercise in envy. Other writers have portrayed him more empathetically, as a humorously obnoxious yet caring boss and family man who nevertheless has shown great bravery and integrity in the face of the assorted villains with which the &quot;Bugle&quot; comes into contact, and whose campaign against Spider-Man comes more from the aforementioned political motivations. He and Peter Parker are related by marriage as a result of his father&#x27;s wedding to May Parker. Jameson&#x27;s son John Jameson is a Marvel Universe supporting character who, in addition to his job as a famous astronaut, has become Man-Wolf and Star-God and also married She-Hulk, making Jonah her father-in-law before she and John divorced. In addition to Man-Wolf, he also serves as a principal figure in the creation of Spider-Man foes Spider-Slayer and Scorpion.

The character has appeared in numerous media adaptations related to Spider-Man; he usually assumes his early role as Peter&#x27;s employer, but this has lessened in recent years as depictions of Spider-Man focused around his science and superhero careers, with Jameson simply being Spider-Man&#x27;s tormentor. Most famously, J. K. Simmons portrayed the character in Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy (2002–2007) and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot; (2019) and &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021). Simmons also voices him in various additional works, such as &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; (2012–2017) and the animated film &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot; (2023).

==Publication history==
Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, Jameson first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; issue #1 (March 1963). Stan Lee stated in an interview on &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot; that he modeled J. Jonah Jameson as a much grumpier version of himself. Later Spider-Man writers Tom DeFalco and Gerry Conway agreed that J. Jonah Jameson was as close as Lee ever came to a self-portrayal, with Conway elaborating that &quot;just like Stan is a very complex and interesting guy who both has a tremendously charismatic part of himself and is an honestly decent guy who cares about people, he also has this incredible ability to go immediately to shallow. Just, BOOM, right to shallow. And that&#x27;s Jameson&quot;. Conway stated that whenever he wrote Jameson&#x27;s dialogue, he would hear it in Lee&#x27;s voice, and on one occasion even wrote a Jameson speech that was almost directly quoted from a Stan Lee speech.

The Spider-Man creative staff considered Jameson&#x27;s wedding to Marla Madison in &quot;Amazing Spider-Man Annual&quot; #18 (1984) a momentous enough event that they asked Stan Lee to script the story, while the art team on the issue emulated Steve Ditko&#x27;s style.

Jameson has been a mainstay of the Spider-Man supporting cast, and on a few rare occasions has been given a starring role, including &quot;Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; #80 (July 1983), &quot;Web of Spider-Man&quot; #52 (July 1989) (in which Spider-Man himself only appears in a single panel), and &quot;Spider-Man&#x27;s Tangled Web&quot; #20 (January 2003).

==Fictional character biography==
===Background===
According to &quot;Behind the Mustache&quot;, a story featured in &quot;Spider-Man&#x27;s Tangled Web&quot; #20 (January 2003), Jameson was raised as a child by David and Betty Jameson. David was an officer of the United States Army, a war veteran decorated as a hero; at home, however, David regularly abused his wife and son. As a result, J. Jonah Jameson grew convinced that &quot;No one&#x27;s a hero every day of the week&quot; and &quot;Even the real heroes can&#x27;t keep it up all the time&quot;. Later issues of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; clarified that David Jameson was in fact Jonah&#x27;s foster father, and the brother of J. Jonah Jameson Sr., Jonah&#x27;s biological father, who had to leave his son behind for undisclosed reasons.

He was a Boy Scout during his childhood. In high school, his interests were mainly boxing and photography. He met his first wife Joan when they both joined their high school&#x27;s photo club. When the school&#x27;s three top athletes started bullying him, he fought back and beat all three of them to a pulp. This impressed Joan and they started dating. They married as soon as they finished school.

After school, Jameson sought employment as a journalist. In &quot;Marvels&quot; #1, a young reporter brags to his colleagues that he would one day run the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;; according to writer Kurt Busiek, he and artist Alex Ross intended this to be J. Jonah Jameson, but the editor of the Spider-Man line objected that Jameson was too young to have been alive during the early 1940s, when the story was set. Since it was too late to redraw the scene, the editor settled for having Jameson&#x27;s name removed from the issue. When the U.S.A. joined World War II in 1941, Jameson served as a war correspondent in Europe. &quot;Sergeant Fury and His Howling Commandos&quot; #110 featured him as covering a mission of Sergeant Nicholas Fury, who was heading a team of commandos during the war.

After the war, he and Joan had a son John Jonah Jameson III, who grew up to become an astronaut. When Jameson returned from a journalistic mission in Korea, he was grieved to find that his wife Joan Jameson had died in a mugging incident. Focusing on his professional life to dull the pain, he was promoted to editor-in-chief of the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;, and eventually came to own the paper, thereby fulfilling his earlier boasts.

Jameson gained a mostly deserved reputation for journalistic integrity, but his greedy opportunism and unyielding belligerent stubbornness made him more than a few enemies.

=== Spider-Man ===

J. Jonah Jameson was part of the audience that saw Spider-Man&#x27;s first TV broadcast. However, when Spider-Man becomes a masked vigilante, Jameson strives to blacken Spider-Man&#x27;s reputation; casting the masked hero as an unhinged vigilante not only boosts the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;″s circulation, but also punishes Spider-Man for overshadowing Jameson&#x27;s astronaut son. When Spider-Man tries to counter the bad press by rescuing his son from danger, Jameson accuses the hero of staging the situation for his own benefit.

This episode sets a pattern with Jameson&#x27;s and Spider-Man&#x27;s relationship: Jameson publicly accusing Spider-Man of numerous crimes and misdeeds, only to feel continually obliged to print almost as many retractions after being proven wrong. The lead story of &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #2 (May 1963) sets another part of the pattern: Peter Parker selling pictures of himself as Spider-Man to the &quot;Bugle&quot; with few questions asked, and Jonah using the pictures to support his editorials against Spider-Man, unaware that he is giving him gainful employment in the process. After his accusations that Spider-Man is the notorious criminal overlord The Big Man are debunked, Jameson admits that he is jealous of Spider-Man&#x27;s courage and selflessness. Jameson believes that he cannot look at himself as a good man while a hero like Spider-Man exists. Despite this, he openly idolizes Captain America, and Mary Jane Watson-Parker has suggested that Jameson hates Spider-Man mainly because he acts outside the law. A psychiatrist suggests that it is the mask that bothers him, and that when Jameson sees people who &quot;claimed to be heroes, but covered their faces&quot;, he is subconsciously sure that they&#x27;re hiding a horrible secret like his foster father was. While interviewing Spider-Man years later, Jameson says that he used to think that he was jealous, or worried about children endangering themselves by following the hero&#x27;s example, but says that the mask is why he dislikes Spider-Man.

Though Jonah&#x27;s rancor against Spider-Man at times subsides after he saves the life of one of his loved ones, his determination to find some flaw in the hero always returns before long. For his part, Spider-Man&#x27;s reaction ranges from frustration and anger at the ungrateful publisher, which leads to occasional pranks to antagonize him, to an amused acceptance of his self-destructive stubbornness.

Jameson posts rewards for Spider-Man&#x27;s capture or secret identity, hunts him with Spencer Smythe&#x27;s Spider-Slayer robots, and even commissions superpowered agents to defeat the masked man. He hires a private detective named MacDonald Gargan, puts him through a regimen of genetic enhancement, and transforms him into the Scorpion — only to have Gargan go insane and turn on his benefactor. Although Spider-Man protects Jameson from the Scorpion, Jameson keeps his role in creating the Scorpion secret for years. He later enlisted Harlan Stillwell to make an opponent for Spider-Man. Harlan created the Human Fly and had his own vendetta against Jameson. He hires Silver Sable and her Wild Pack to hunt Spider-Man down, and also hires Luke Cage to capture Spider-Man when he is wanted for the deaths of Gwen Stacy and Norman Osborn. On another occasion, he offers Electro a five-thousand-dollar reward (1970 dollars, worth $19,300 today) to mount a surprise attack against Spider-Man during a television interview.

Though best known for his crusades against vigilante superheroes like Spider-Man, Jameson never hesitates to use the power of his paper against supervillains, crooked politicians, and crime bosses, including the Kingpin. After initially supporting Sam Bullitt, a candidate for New York Attorney General who had pledged to arrest Spider-Man if elected, Jameson reverses his stance after learning that Bullitt is a racist crook. Jameson publishes a major exposé on mayoral candidate Randolf Cherryh&#x27;s criminal ties, acknowledging in advance that a retaliatory lawsuit from Cherryh could bankrupt the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;. Jameson later takes an aggressive stance against presidential candidate Graydon Creed, attacking him for his anti-mutant agenda and investigating the shadowy , though Jameson never manages to uncover the truth. He is also a longtime crusader for civil rights, having expressed disgust for racial prejudice on several occasions and has also campaigned for labor and mutant rights.

===Family ties===
In &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #162 (November 1976), Jameson introduces himself to Dr. Marla Madison, a distinguished scientist and daughter of a deceased friend of his. He asks for her help in creating a new Spider-Slayer, one of a series of robots created to defeat Spider-Man, although Spider-Man has managed to survive their attacks and destroy each of them. Madison is interested in the challenge, and joins Jameson in his efforts. The two grow closer, eventually marrying but not without another attack from the Scorpion, who kidnaps Marla and is defeated by Spider-Man. Jameson remains a devoted, if a little overprotective, husband to his second wife.

Marla Madison adopts Mattie Franklin, her niece and the daughter of one of Jonah&#x27;s friends. Though Jonah is initially opposed to having a roguish teenager in his house, especially one who insists on affectionately calling him &quot;Unca Jonah&quot;, he soon warms up to Mattie, coming to regard her almost as a surrogate daughter. Two weeks after Mattie is abducted for illegal harvesting of mutant growth hormone, private investigators Jessica Drew and Jessica Jones track her down and inform Jonah and Marla that Mattie is also the vigilante Spider-Woman. For saving Mattie, Jonah heavily promotes Jones&#x27; agency and later hires her as a reporter for the &quot;Bugle&quot;″s new &quot;Pulse&quot; magazine.

===Relinquishing control===
The guilt for creating the Scorpion catches up with Jameson when the Hobgoblin blackmails him about it. When he receives the threats, rather than succumb to the Hobgoblin, Jameson chooses instead to reveal it to the world in a public editorial. He steps down as the &quot;Bugle&quot;&#x27;s editor-in-chief, delegating the post to his immediate subordinate, Joseph &quot;Robbie&quot; Robertson, but Jameson remains its publisher.

Jonah&#x27;s control of the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; is bought out from under him by multimillionaire Thomas Fireheart. Fireheart had felt that he owed Spider-Man a debt of honor and in an attempt to repay the hero, he purchases the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; and begins a pro-Spider-Man campaign. Jameson starts up a rival magazine which continues to produce anti-Spider-Man articles. Spider-Man finds Fireheart&#x27;s campaign embarrassing at best, and after he repeatedly demands that he stop, Fireheart challenges the web-slinger to a battle to the death in New Mexico. He then sells the &quot;Bugle&quot; back to Jameson for the sum of one dollar, on the condition that he print an obituary &quot;For either me, or Spider-Man&quot;. Jameson, though shocked by the request, takes the deal.

He is blackmailed into selling the &quot;Bugle&quot; to Norman Osborn after threats were made against his family; simultaneously, he is attacked and hounded by the supervillain Mad Jack. The time spent as a subordinate to Osborn took a heavy mental toll, almost driving him to attempted murder, but he is finally able to reclaim the &quot;Bugle&quot; after Osborn is driven underground by temporary insanity.

===&quot;Death&quot;===
When a duplicate of Spider-Man created by Mysterio jumps in front of Jameson&#x27;s car while he is driving home from work one day, Jameson crashes his car into a tree. He is believed to have been killed in the car crash, dying upon impact, and the media blames Spider-Man for his tragic and untimely demise. Later, he is shown ascending to &quot;the light&quot;, only for him to be condemned for all the injustices he committed in life. He is then shown descending into Mysterio&#x27;s staged version of Hell, where he is tormented by a Spider-Man-themed demon, though this is revealed to just be a part of Mysterio&#x27;s revenge on Jameson, but Spider-Man rescues him.

===Spider-Man unmasked===
Jameson&#x27;s influence on the paper as its publisher is shown in the 2006–2007 &quot;Civil War: Front Line&quot; when he pressures his staff into supporting the federal government&#x27;s Superhuman Registration Act, still directing the general tone of the paper, despite losing his more hands-on position. When Spider-Man unmasks and reveals himself to be Peter Parker, Jameson faints in shock at the realization that the man he had been calling a menace had actually been on his payroll for years. On top of the Parker revelation, Jameson is forced to deal with the notion that She-Hulk had now become his daughter-in-law. This was not helped by the fact that She-Hulk and Spider-Man had previously sued him for libel.
It has been since revealed that Jameson had always believed that between him and Peter Parker was a bond of trust, and he had always regarded him as another son, the &quot;last honest man&quot; in the world; he had always bought Parker&#x27;s photos, even the ones that he considered inferior, to help him financially in a discreet manner. After Peter&#x27;s public confession, Jameson feels so betrayed and humiliated that it shatters their bond. He is determined to make Peter &quot;pay&quot;, despite Parker (as enforcer) and Jameson both actively supporting the Superhuman Registration Act. He plans to sue Parker for fraud, demanding back all the money he paid Peter over the years. However, he learns that the government has granted Parker amnesty for all the acts he had done to protect his secret identity, which included taking photos of himself. Both this and his son&#x27;s marriage to She-Hulk drive Jameson into a fit of rage, and he attacks his new daughter-in-law with the original Spider-Slayer. She easily destroys it, and to smooth things over, remarks that she will handle the lawsuit for fraud against Spider-Man (while privately intending to drag it out as long as possible).

Spider-Man later defects from the government&#x27;s side in enforcing the Registration Act and joins with Captain America&#x27;s Secret Avengers, openly rebelling against the new law and fighting those attempting to enforce it. Issues of &quot;Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man&quot; reveal that Jameson posted a reward to capture Parker. He also commits libel against Parker by coercing Peter&#x27;s former girlfriend Debra Whitman into writing an untrue account of him; Betty Brant secretly supplies information about this to &quot;The Daily Globe&quot;, which publishes a front-page exposé.

Jameson&#x27;s editor-in-chief and closest friend Robbie Robertson stands up to Jameson and his shoddy treatment of Peter/Spider-Man over the years. Unable or unwilling to admit that he has gone too far in his hatred of Spider-Man, Jameson fires Robertson. Later, Spider-Man learns of this from Betty Brant and decides that he and Jameson should have a long overdue &quot;chat&quot;. Some time later, Jameson visits the Robertson house with a bottle of wine, two black eyes, and a broken hand. He tells Robbie that he discovered his office at the &quot;Bugle&quot; covered with webbing, with a note attached telling him to meet Spider-Man at an old gangster lair. Spider-Man tried to persuade Jameson to rehire Robbie, and Jameson gave him a choice: to have the lawsuit against him dropped, or for Robbie to be rehired. Spider-Man chose the former, revealing that he did so because he believes Jameson only fired Robbie to antagonize him. Spider-Man then told Jameson to hit him, as many times as he&#x27;d like, to finally work out his frustrations. Jameson was initially reluctant, until Spider-Man started goading him, threatening to inform his wife and son of his &quot;cowardice&quot;. Jameson snapped and started hitting Spider-Man again and again and again, resulting in his broken hand. When it was over, Spider-Man went into the rafters and brought Jameson back a roll of film, containing pictures of their &quot;fight&quot;, telling him the photographs depicting him standing back and letting Jameson beat him up would sell &quot;a gazillion copies&quot;, and left. Later, at the &quot;Bugle&quot;, Jameson crushed the film with his foot, not knowing quite why he was doing it. As he turned to leave, Betty Brant accidentally hit him in the face with a door, resulting in his two black eyes. Back in the present, Jameson tells Robbie of his decision to rehire him and to drop the lawsuit against Peter.

===Heart attacks and recuperation===
Jameson has his first heart attack, a mild one, in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #70, while being threatened by Spider-Man when the latter finally loses his temper after many years of abuse and defamation.

After the status quo was revised in the &quot;Brand New Day&quot; storyline, Peter&#x27;s identity is once again a secret. &quot;The Daily Bugle&quot; is suffering financially with Peter not selling as many Spider-Man pictures as usual and star reporter Ben Urich gone. These circumstances lead to Jonah facing a buyout from the wealthy Dexter Bennett. Jonah must stop everyone&#x27;s paychecks to build the capital needed to save the paper, with everyone at the &quot;Bugle&quot; working temporarily for free as a sign of solidarity. Needing money for an apartment, Peter goes to the &quot;Bugle&quot;, claiming he is owed money. Jonah yells at him, causing Peter to snap and yell back, stating that his photographs kept the &quot;Bugle&quot; selling while Jonah raked in the profits and paid Peter a pittance. This causes Jonah to yell at Peter again, but he stops short, owing to a second heart attack. Peter provides CPR for Jonah to try and save him until the paramedics arrive; they rush Jonah to the hospital where he rests before surgery. His wife talks to a lawyer about power of attorney and selling the final shares of the &quot;Bugle&quot; without Jonah having a say. When Peter, as Spider-Man, visits Jonah, he accidentally let slip that the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; has sold to Dexter Bennett, which caused Jonah to have another heart attack, forcing Spider-Man to once again give him CPR. Surprisingly, Jonah does not blame Spider-Man for once, but instead he continues muttering, &quot;Dexter Bennett&quot;.

Jonah&#x27;s condition improves to the point where he has physiotherapy sessions and tai chi classes. However, he loses his temper if he sees or hears about Dexter Bennett and the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;. He is also apparently facing problems with his wife, as he has yet to forgive her for selling the &quot;Bugle&quot;.

===Mayor of New York===
In a 2009 storyline, Jameson is elected the Mayor of New York City Spider-Man is in another dimension with the Fantastic Four, resulting in a month going by on Earth while they are only away for a few hours. In his new office, Jonah receives a visit from his estranged father, J. Jonah Jameson Sr., demanding that Jonah cease his vendetta against Spider-Man — the reasons being Spider-Man&#x27;s many heroic deeds and the fact that the Avengers and even Captain America had accepted Spider-Man. Spider-Man then enters the mayor&#x27;s office (hoping to establish a truce with Jameson) only for Jonah to announce that he has assembled an &quot;Anti-Spider Squad&quot; to capture Spider-Man. Spider-Man responds by increasing his superhero work, committing heroic deeds all over the city simply to enrage Jameson. Jameson responds by putting his squad on double-shifts, severely straining the city council&#x27;s budget.

====Dark Reign====
In the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline, with Norman&#x27;s rise to power, Dark Avengers member Spider-Man (really Mac Gargan) seeks revenge on Jameson. When Jameson arrives home, he finds a dead stripper on his bed. When Gargan starts a gang war, Jameson goes to Osborn to help and is given &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. He later discovers this Spider-Man has caused the gang war and tries to confront Norman, though Spider-Man&#x27;s name is cleared when he appears to save the Big Apple Festival from Bullseye, Daken, and the gangs involved. Jameson&#x27;s popularity jumps from having worked with Spider-Man to solve the problem, though he does not realize during the course of the events that he is dealing with a different Spider-Man.

Jameson also eventually learns that his father is marrying May Parker, something he personally does not like. But, he begrudgingly accepts it in the end. He even offers to pay for their ceremony out of his own pocket, and preside over it. The marriage also technically makes him Peter Parker&#x27;s brother/cousin, something he very clearly dislikes.

====The Gauntlet====
During &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; storyline, Spider-Man tries to stop the Chameleon from exploding a bomb that would kill thousands. Jameson has his squad wearing Mandroid suits to attack Spider-Man, but Spider-Man cleverly uses his knowledge of the Mandroid suits to disarm the bomb instead. The squad decide not to follow their orders to arrest Spider-Man. Instead, they let him go. The next day, Jameson is shocked to learn that every member of the squad has resigned, and his aide tells him that Jonah is getting out of control, and that Spider-Man&#x27;s heroics do not deserve a criminal&#x27;s treatment. When Jameson yells about how much the public has to see Spider-Man as a menace, the aide snaps that this was not the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;. The aide then resigns, telling Jameson that he has to choose between Spider-Man or actually helping the city.

Jameson later gives a financial bailout to Dexter Bennett to keep the &quot;Bugle&quot; afloat. This leads to a public backlash which the villain Electro uses to his advantage. Electro espouses taking down the &quot;Bugle&quot;. He sees it as a greedy corporation and draws energy from his citywide supporters by turning on all their electrical appliances. In a showdown with Spider-Man inside the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; building, Dexter Bennett is crushed by rubble, and the building is completely destroyed. The destruction of the &quot;Bugle&#x27;s&quot; longtime headquarters proves heartbreaking for Jameson, who is upset with his life&#x27;s work being destroyed.

During Spider-Man&#x27;s encounter with the latest Vulture in &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #623–624, it is falsely stated by a mob boss that Jameson was responsible for his creation to get that Vulture to attack Jameson. As a result, Spider-Man has to fight with the Vulture to protect Jameson. Security guard Gabriel Graham, whom Jameson did not even know the name of before, gives up his life to protect Jameson from the Vulture. The self-sacrifice of Gabriel Graham greatly affects Jameson, and makes Peter decide to make a doctored photo showing Jameson trying to fight back against the Vulture. While the picture does, in fact, get back support for Jameson from the public, and eventually makes several people admit the truth of the situation, Jameson exposes the picture as a fake, and publicly fires Peter Parker.

====Heroic Age====
During the &quot;Heroic Age&quot; storyline, J. Jonah Jameson witnesses the reformation of the Avengers. and is later targeted by an assassin called the Extremist.

After Spider-Man saves New York from a bomb planted by Doctor Octopus, Jameson is met by his son and Steve Rogers and talked into holding a ceremony to give Spider-Man the key to the city (much to his chagrin). At the same time, he cashes his shares of the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;, giving the money to Robbie Robertson so that he can rebuild &quot;Front Line&quot; into the new &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;.

During the events of the &quot;Big Time&quot; storyline, Alistair Smythe attempts to kill J. Jonah Jameson at the time when Marla hooked Peter up with Max Modell of Horizon Labs. Marla shields her husband, saving his life, but she dies in the process. Holding Marla, Jameson does not blame Spider-Man this time, but instead blames himself.

During the attacks of the villain Massacre, Jameson comforts a boy named Liam who lost his mother when Massacre attacked the bank she was visiting. Jameson plans to have Alistair Smythe receive the death penalty (not only because he is a murderer, but also for what happened to his wife Marla). After Spider-Man defeats Massacre, he prevents the police from killing him then hands him over to the police. Jameson berates Spider-Man for saving the life of a murderer. However, Spider-Man reminds Jameson of Spider-Man&#x27;s personal policy that &quot;no one dies&quot;.

During the &quot;Spider-Island&quot; storyline, J. Jonah Jameson&#x27;s popularity as the mayor has plummeted and his Anti-Spider-Man Squad is considered to be a huge tax drain. Jameson is shown to have been infected with spider powers and soon mutates into a spider-like creature. As this mutated creature, Jameson nearly kills Allistair Smythe, partly due to fact that he was responsible for the death of Jameson&#x27;s wife. Jameson is eventually cured of the spider-virus, along with the rest of the citizens of New York.

During the &quot;Ends of the Earth&quot; storyline, Mayor Jameson shuts down Horizon Labs (albeit without a court order) on the accusation that it conducts dangerous experiments and harbors criminals such as Morbius. Max Modell&#x27;s lawyer Hector Baez fights the company&#x27;s accusations. Jameson places the city under martial law, with his Anti-Spider-Man Squad patrolling the streets to prevent any looting during the &quot;Ends of the Earth&quot; storyline. However, when Horizon Labs returns as heroes, Jameson is forced to re-open their New York facilities to save face, though he still demands the expulsion of Morbius.

====Working with Superior Spider-Man====
After Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus&#x27; mind in Spider-Man&#x27;s body) stops the Sinister Six, Mayor J. Jonah Jameson comes to thank him personally, while Peter Parker&#x27;s consciousness is shocked to see Jameson&#x27;s drastically changed attitude towards the hero. On the top of the police station building Jameson, Chief Pratchett and Carlie Cooper stand near to the improvised &quot;Spider-Signal&quot;. Jameson boasts about his wise ruling policy while Carlie doubts Superior Spider-Man will ever show up. But he finally does and short-circuits the signal. Jameson discharges oaths about wasted taxpayer dollars, and Superior Spider-Man explains they can hinder him using the signal, humiliating Jameson between the lines. When Massacre rigs the doors of Grand Central Station to explode, this even worries Jameson. While speaking in a press conference, Jameson is suddenly attacked by criminal pranksters Jester and Screwball who assault their victims and broadcast it through the internet in a web-show called &quot;Jested&quot; (similar to popular TV show &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot;). Both pranksters humiliate Jameson and transmit it all over the world, where even Superior Spider-Man laughs it off. Then he gets summoned by Jameson himself to the City Hall where he asks him to arrest Jester and Screwball. Superior Spider-Man dismisses it at first, but after Jameson reminded him of all the times Superior Spider-Man has pulled pranks on him (and even Otto remembers Peter&#x27;s quips against him), he agrees to catch them putting his Patrol App on course. Superior Spider-Man beats up Jester and Screwball where his brutality being watched all over the city including Jameson (who is enjoying the punishment).

Jameson argues with his father about the actions of Superior Spider-Man. Jameson later enlists Superior Spider-Man to help oversee the execution of Alistair Smythe. Jameson arrives to the Raft for a final inspection before Smythe&#x27;s execution, where he has told that all of the Raft&#x27;s inmates will be transferred once Jameson shuts it down, highlighting the infirmary where Boomerang, Vulture and Scorpion are being attended. Jameson, alongside Superior Spider-Man, his assistant Glory Grant and Bugle reporter Norah Jones, watch the procedure of Smythe&#x27;s execution, while he claims to be a &quot;better person&quot;

Jameson reflecting on the moment whose Smythe killed his wife Marla right in front on him, sadly proclaiming that he will not keep the promise to fulfill her dying wish until Smythe dies, swearing that he will not leave the island. After Smythe&#x27;s escape, Jameson, Glory Grant, Norah Winters, and the remaining civilians are surrounded by Superior Spider-Man&#x27;s Spider-Bots and then are informed by Otto (in a pre-recorded hologram) that he has taken measures to counteract any attempt of escape so his Spider-Bots will safeguard them in a force field while the reinforcements arrive, but Jonah refuses to stand still inside the force field, willing to go and help Superior Spider-Man against Smythe. When Smythe has the upper hand over Superior Spider-Man, Jameson poses as a prison guard to narrowly shoot Smythe. Superior Spider-Man accuses Jameson of leaving the force field, but Jameson confronts Superior Spider-Man to tell him he brought him to ensure that Smythe gets executed by any means necessary, implying that he has giving permission to Superior Spider-Man to directly kill him. Superior Spider-Man accepts and tells Jameson to go back to the force field with the others. Smythe sends Scorpion to target Jameson. Jameson is assaulted by Scorpion who was more than willing to kill him only to be stopped by the Lizard. Once aboard the rescue boat, Jameson prepares himself for a press conference musing that he will be happy once the Raft is destroyed. Superior Spider-Man sways him apart and tells him that he should give him the Raft for his new base of operations. Jameson refuses only to be blackmailed by Superior Spider-Man with a recording of their meeting at the Raft where Jameson grants permission to Superior Spider-Man to kill Smythe. Fearing the repercussions (and in the process reigniting his hatred towards Superior Spider-Man), Jameson agrees and makes the announcement in his press conference where he publicly gives Superior Spider-Man the Raft as his new Super Hero Headquarters which Superior Spider-Man rechristens it as &quot;Spider-Island II&quot;.

During the attacks of the Goblin King&#x27;s Goblin Underground, Mayor Jameson unveils the Goblin-Slayers (which Mary Jane thinks might be former Spider-Slayers) which he plans to use to combat the Goblin threat. Jameson orders to send one of the Goblin Slayers to the robbery location and then head to chase Superior Spider-Man. His Spider-Slayers confront Superior Spider-Man as Spider-Slayers with Jameson&#x27;s face projected on the front faceplate. Jameson replies that he is done with being blackmailed by him and does not care if Jameson loses everything as long as he can finally bring down Superior Spider-Man, but his Spider-Slayers are reactivated by Green Goblin and voice rings out declaring that he has taken control of the Spider-Slayers as Green Goblin comments that Norman Osborn now runs this city. In New York City Hall, Jameson is coming under heavy fire for the fact that his Spider-Slayers have turned against the people. He tries to blame Alchemax, but his accusations are swiftly rebuked by Liz Allan who appears via video link declares that Alchemax is severing all ties with Jameson. Jameson shows his frustration for his personal downfall after the Spider Slayers&#x27; failure, but Tiberius Stone uses this as a chance to sell them as weapons to other nations. In the aftermath, Spider-Man is restored to his body Octavius sacrificing his own mind to bring Peter back as he recognizes that Peter Parker is the true Spider-Man and Green Goblin&#x27;s plan is thwarted, Spider-Man visiting Jameson&#x27;s office to confront him after what happened and returns him the Spider-Bot that Doctor Octopus used to record his blackmail material. Jameson replies that he will not accept it since he would not believe whatever Spider-Man says, regarding him now as a &quot;monster&quot; that does not own up to the consequences of his actions and instead stomps on others. Spider-Man replies that he will not expect him to believe this but says that he should not fear him, and should not take the blame for everything that Green Goblin caused, but to stay and fight. Once Spider-Man leaves, Jameson reveals that he had already resigned his post as Mayor of New York City and leaves the office, promising that from now on he will kick back.

===A new direction===
During the &quot;Original Sin&quot; storyline, the eye of the murdered Uatu the Watcher revealed that J. Jonah Jameson had fired a former &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; employee for viewing an embarrassing article that he wrote in which he praised Spider-Man in his early days of being a wrestler. Jameson later established the Fact Channel. As Silk battles against Electro and Spider-Man deals with Black Cat, Jameson remains on the channel forcing the cameraman to film the action. Black Cat deviate one of Electro&#x27;s bolts hitting Spider-Man, knocking him down in the process. Black Cat attempts to unmask Spider-Man as Jameson (who hears the truth concerning Doctor Octopus) aims the camera. However, Jameson&#x27;s angle prevents anyone seeing Spider-Man&#x27;s face long enough for Silk to knock Black Cat back and Spider-Man to put his mask back on. He would later be seen taking charge of the Fact Channel&#x27;s operations acting like he was head of the company and taking interest in Silk.

Following Regent&#x27;s defeat and Betty Brant&#x27;s exposé, Jameson brags to Glory Grant that their time at the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; was when real journalism had happened. Jameson and Peter Parker later got word that his estranged father Jay coughed up blood and collapsed.

While visiting his father in a private room at Mount Sinai Hospital at the start of the &quot;Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy&quot; storyline, Jameson accuses Peter where their traveling around the world might have caused him to catch some type of disease. Jay calms his son down. Jameson was visited by the doctor of New U Technologies upon being called in by his father&#x27;s doctor. Jameson suspects that there is a &quot;price&quot; for this and storms off. Later on, Jameson visits New U Technologies to speak to the doctor. To give proof to Jameson that their talents of using a subject&#x27;s DNA to clone replacement parts work, Jameson is surprised when the doctor calls in an apparent revived Marla Jameson. With his father&#x27;s health having taken a turn for the worse, Peter has to endure Jameson&#x27;s and May&#x27;s concerns for his extreme skepticism for using New U, with his secret identity preventing him from informing them of the real reason he doubts them. Peter remains adamant of sticking to the conventional procedure and Jay has sided with him. Peter&#x27;s superheroic endeavors prevent him from accompanying May and Jameson as Jay&#x27;s health reaches critical status and he undergoes conventional surgery. To make matters worse, this is not enough and Jay passes away.

It is revealed that the revived Marla Jameson is a clone that the Jackal had gathered to grow clones with false memories that span all the way to their deaths. Later, Jameson was granted a revived clone of Mattie Franklin. When Jameson wants one of his workers to investigate the New U scenario in San Francisco, Cindy volunteers to go to get away from the city as Hector Cervantez (now calling himself Spectro) accompanies her. Jameson is enthusiastic for her that her family is back together and leaves for dinner, but Cindy found something off about his behavior. Cindy&#x27;s suspicions are confirmed when she finds Jameson talking with his formerly-deceased wife while Spectro finds a room with a number of test subjects in capsules. Cindy is then approached in her apartment by Jameson. Cindy gives him Rafferty and Lola&#x27;s research to voice skepticism on the New U Technologies and Jameson invites her to join him on a quick trip to the facility. He tells Cindy that he believes they are doing good work and introduces her to Mattie and Marla.

After J. Jonah Jameson is taken to Haven with his clone wife, he asked the Jackal to revive his father. Jackal told him to head upstairs to promote New U Technologies on television. When Jameson is about to send out a broadcast message of the New U Technologies, Jackal reactivated the broadcast to tell the world that they will all die and be reborn as the Carrion Virus in all of the clones and causes them to start rapidly decaying. Jameson&#x27;s broadcast causes the Carrion Virus to start spreading worldwide. Spider-Man and Anna Maria Marconi arrive to stop the broadcast as Mattie reveals to Jameson her superpowers. After Spider-Man sends out the Webware Emergency Signal, Jameson and Silk find Marla and Mattie reduced to dust. Following the Carrion Virus being thwarted, Jameson is heartbroken as Spider-Man and Anna arrive. Jameson pleads to Spider-Man not to tell Peter that he was right about his suspicion towards New U Technologies. Afterwards, Jameson clean his office after he is fired by the Fact Channel.

Following a tense confrontation with Spider-Man provoked by a rogue branch of S.H.I.E.L.D., Spider-Man agreed to an exclusive interview with Jameson that culminated in the wall-crawler revealing his secret identity, prompting Jameson to vow to be more supportive of the hero&#x27;s efforts in future.

During the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, J. Jonah Jameson was in Manhattan at the time when Baron Helmut Zemo used the Darkhold to amplify Blackout&#x27;s powers to surround the city in Darkforce following Hydra&#x27;s takeover of the United States. When Kraven the Hunter raided the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; looking for information on the identity of Spider-Man, Phil Sheldon&#x27;s daughter Jennie ran to warn Jameson thinking that he could be in danger. When Jameson was attacked by Kraven the Hunter, Jennie Sheldon fired a signal flare into the sky enough to attract the attention of Spider-Woman who defeated Kraven the Hunter.

Jameson is later abducted by Norman Osborn to find out who Spider-Man is. Osborn takes a brief interval from the torture to kill Phil Urich as the self-proclaimed Goblin King tried to raid one of his old storehouses. After Osborn suited up as the Green Goblin, Jameson informed the villain that he could not stop Spider-Man since Gwen Stacy&#x27;s death. Those words made Norman remember that Spider-Man is Peter Parker, breaking the mental block on Spider-Man&#x27;s identity. This left Jameson devastated at what he has done. Sure enough, his increasing guilt and fear for Parker&#x27;s safety quickly motivated Jameson to help defend Spider-Man&#x27;s inner circle against Osborn, who has bonded himself with the Carnage symbiote to become the Red Goblin. Jameson sends Venom to defend Mary Jane at the Stark Tower. Jameson and Superior Octopus later help to defend Aunt May from Red Goblin where Jameson operates an older version of the Spider-Slayer. When Spider-Man removes the Carnage symbiote from Green Goblin, Spider-Man persuades Jameson not to shoot him.

During the &quot;Blood Hunt&quot; storyline, J. Jonah Jameson and John Jameson were planning on having lunch together when the Darkforce blocks out the Sun and a vampire invasion occurs. John becomes Man-Wolf and works to protect his father so that he can get him to his studio and inform people how to keep themselves protected against the attacking vampires.

==In other media==
===Television===

* J. Jonah Jameson appears in &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1967), voiced by Paul Kligman. This version is an egotistical, greedy, and cowardly braggart who constantly berates his employees and automatically accuses Spider-Man of any crime, even when the evidence contradicts him. While he maintains these traits throughout the series, the second season prequel episode &quot;King Pinned&quot; portrays Jameson&#x27;s attitude toward Spider-Man as being originally warmer, even going as far as to stand up to the Kingpin, help the web-slinger defeat him, and expose the Kingpin&#x27;s drug counterfeiting racket during their first meeting.
* J. Jonah Jameson appears in &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; (1978), portrayed by David White and Robert F. Simon respectively. Both versions are portrayed as a more avuncular figure, with his abrasive, flamboyant personality being toned down.

* J. Jonah Jameson appears in &quot;Spider-Man: The Animated Series&quot;, voiced by Ed Asner.

Furthermore, he owns a station called &quot;J3 Communications&quot; in addition to the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; and previously worked as a cub reporter nicknamed &quot;Jigsaw&quot;. The series also portrays his integrity as a journalist as he refuses to cover up the truth even when it is in his best interests and demonstrates loyalty to his employees, such as helping Peter Parker by hiring Matt Murdock as his defense attorney when Parker was framed by Richard Fisk for selling government secrets to foreign powers and aiding Robbie Robertson when Tombstone and Fisk frame him for their crimes.

=== Film ===
* James Cameron&#x27;s original script for what eventually became &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002) depicted Jameson as a TV executive instead of editor-in-chief of the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; who has a strong dislike for the titular hero and attempts to defame him. Additionally, Cameron had wanted R. Lee Ermey for the role.
* While J. Jonah Jameson does not appear in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; film series, he is referenced as Peter Parker&#x27;s employer in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot; (2014) and tie-in comics. J. K. Simmons, who previously portrayed Jameson in Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy, expressed interest in returning as Jameson for the films.

==== Raimi trilogy ====

This version is a blustering, bombastic, obsessed, and hyperactive man who retains his dislike for Spider-Man, taking delight in anything that might discredit or defame him. Nonetheless, he remains a good man at his core.

====&quot;Spider-Verse&quot;====

J. Jonah Jameson, based on his counterpart from &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1967), appears in the post-credits scene of &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot; (2018), voiced by the film&#x27;s editorial associate production manager, Adam Brown.

In the sequel &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot; (2023), J. K. Simmons reprised his role as several alternate reality versions of Jameson from Earth-1610, Earth-65, and Earth-42, designed after the balding MCU Jameson, providing original dialogue; a Lego figure of Jameson from Earth-13122 also makes a cameo appearance, voiced by archival audio of Simmons as Jameson from Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002).

====Marvel Cinematic Universe====

J. Jonah Jameson appears in media set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), portrayed by J. K. Simmons. He appears in the film &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot; (2019), &quot;The Daily Bugle&quot; web series (2019–present), and the film &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021). Simmons also makes an uncredited cameo appearance as the MCU Jameson in the mid-credits scene of the Sony&#x27;s Spider-Man Universe (SSU) film &quot;&quot; (2021), and in a deleted scene in &quot;Morbius&quot; (2022).

Introduced in &quot;Far From Home&quot;, this version is unrelated to the version that Simmons first portrayed in Raimi&#x27;s trilogy. Instead, this Jameson appears as the host of &quot;TheDailyBugle.net&quot;, a sensationalist &quot;&quot;InfoWars&quot;-type video platform&quot;. While he has the same hair color as his Raimi films&#x27; counterpart, Simmons does not wear a toupée to emulate Jameson&#x27;s flattop hairstyle; appearing bald instead to differentiate his differing portrayals. Additionally, Simmons announced that he has signed on to play Jameson for more films in the MCU and SSU.

<text>Njáls saga ( ), also Njála ( ), or Brennu-Njáls saga ( ) (Which can be translated as The Story of Burnt Njáll, or The Saga of Njáll the Burner), is a thirteenth-century Icelandic saga that describes events between 960 and 1020.
The saga deals with a process of blood feuds in the Icelandic Commonwealth, showing how the requirements of honor could lead to minor slights spiralling into destructive and prolonged bloodshed. Insults where a character&#x27;s manhood is called into question are especially prominent and may reflect an author critical of an overly restrictive ideal of masculinity. Another characteristic of the narrative is the presence of omens and prophetic dreams. It is disputed whether this reflects a fatalistic outlook on the part of the author.

The principal characters in the saga are the friends Njáll Þorgeirsson, a lawyer and a sage, and Gunnar Hámundarson, a formidable warrior. Gunnar&#x27;s wife, Hallgerðr langbrók, instigates a feud that leads to the death of many characters over several decades including the killing by fire of the eponymous &quot;Burnt Njáll&quot;.

The work is anonymous, although there has been extensive speculation on the author&#x27;s identity. The major events described in the saga are probably historical but the material was shaped by the author, drawing on oral tradition, according to his artistic needs. &quot;Njáls saga&quot; is the longest and most highly developed of the sagas of Icelanders. It is often considered the peak of the saga tradition.

==Authorship and sources==

The author of &quot;Njáls saga&quot;, like the other sagas of Icelanders, is anonymous. There are, however, several hypotheses about the saga&#x27;s authorship. The oldest idea, attested in the early 17th century, is that Sæmundr fróði wrote the work. Other suggested authors include Sæmundr&#x27;s sons, Jón Loftsson, Snorri Sturluson, Einarr Gilsson, Brandr Jónsson and Þorvarðr Þórarinsson.

The saga is now believed to have been composed in the period from 1270 to 1290. Among written sources which the author likely used are &quot;Laxdæla saga&quot;, &quot;Eyrbyggja saga&quot; and &quot;Ljósvetninga saga&quot; as well as the lost sagas &quot;Brjáns saga&quot; and &quot;Gauks saga Trandilssonar&quot;. However, the author probably derived the bulk of the material in the saga from oral tradition, which he manipulated for his own artistic purposes. Opinions on the historicity of the saga have varied greatly, ranging from pure fiction to nearly verbatim truth to any number of nuanced views. It can be regarded as certain that Njáll and Gunnarr were real historical people and their fateful deaths are referred to in other sources. Gabriel Turville-Petre said, &quot;It was not the author&#x27;s purpose to write a work of history, but rather to use a historical subject for an epic in prose&quot;.

==Themes==
&quot;Njáls saga&quot; explores the consequences of vengeance as a defence of family honor by dealing with a blood feud spanning some 50 years. The saga shows how even worthy people can destroy themselves by disputes and demonstrates the tensions in the Icelandic Commonwealth which eventually led to its destruction. Any insult to one&#x27;s honor had to be revenged: sometimes this includes slights which seem trivial to modern readers. Magnus Magnusson finds it &quot;a little pathetic, now, to read how vulnerable these men were to calls on their honour; it was fatally easy to goad them into action to avenge some suspicion of an insult&quot;.

Insults involving a character&#x27;s manliness are especially prominent in the saga. Thus, Njáll&#x27;s lack of a beard is repeatedly referred to and used by his opponents to call his manhood into question. Another example, among many, is when the gift of a silk garment is considered an insult by Flosi and a hard-won settlement breaks down as a consequence. Ármann Jakobsson has argued that it is &quot;difficult to find a man whose manhood is not vulnerable&quot; and that &quot;Njáls saga&quot; criticizes the idea of a misogynistic society by showing that the ideal of masculinity can be so restrictive that it becomes oppressive to men and destructive to society.

Omens, prophetic dreams and supernatural foresight figure prominently in &quot;Njáls saga&quot;. The role of fate and, especially, of fatalism is, however, a matter of scholarly contention. Halldór Laxness argued that the saga is primarily a book about the fatalism inherent in Norse paganism. In his view, the course of events is foreordained from the moment Hrútr sees the thieves&#x27; eyes in his niece and until the vengeance for Njáll&#x27;s burning is completed to the southeast in Wales. In this way, Laxness believed that &quot;Njáls saga&quot; attested to the presence of a &quot;very strong heathen spirit&quot;, antithetical to Christianity, in 13th century Iceland. Magnus Magnusson wrote that &quot;[t]he action is swept along by a powerful under-current of fate&quot; and that Njáll wages a &quot;fierce struggle to alter its course&quot; but that he is nevertheless &quot;not a fatalist in the heathen sense&quot;. Thorsteinn Gylfason rejects the idea that there is any fatalism in &quot;Njáls saga&quot;, arguing that there is no hostile supernatural plan which its characters are subject to.

==Synopsis==

===Hrútur and Hallgerður===


The first episode covers the period from the betrothal of Hrútur Herjólfsson and Unnur to the ugly legacy of their divorce. We are shown Hrútur&#x27;s exploits in Norway where he gains honour at court and in battle, but he ruins his subsequent marriage by becoming the lover of the Norwegian queen mother Gunnhildur. When he denies having a woman in Iceland, she curses him so that he is unable to consummate his marriage. After Unnur divorces him, he retains the dowry by challenging Unnur&#x27;s father, Mörður, to combat. Mörður refuses, as he knows Hrútur&#x27;s reputation and that he will lose the fight. Because of this, Hrútur keeps the dowry. While this conforms to Icelandic law, it offends justice.

The first chapter gives one of Hrútur&#x27;s insights when he makes comments about his beautiful niece, &quot;I do not know how thieves&#x27; eyes came into the family&quot;. The saga next follows this niece, Hallgerður, through her first two marriages. Both husbands die by the axe of Hallgerður&#x27;s doting, brutish foster-father, Þjóstólfur. Hallgerður provokes the first death but not the second, although it follows from a disagreement between her and her husband. It is Hrútur who, despite the family ties, avenges the death by killing Þjóstólfur.

===Gunnar and Njáll===
Gunnar Hámundarson and Njáll Þorgeirsson are now introduced. Gunnar is a man of outstanding physical prowess, and Njáll has outstanding sagacity; they are close friends. When Gunnar is obliged to revive Unnur&#x27;s dowry-claim against Hrútur, Njáll gives him the means to do so. By skillful play-acting, Gunnar begins the legal process in Hrútur&#x27;s own house. He follows Hrútur&#x27;s doubtful example when it comes to court, and Hrútur, who has previously won by threat of violence, loses to a threat of violence. Despite his humiliation, he sees future links with Gunnar.

This comes about when Gunnar returns with honours from a trip to Scandinavia. He goes to the Althing – the annual assembly – in splendour, and meets Hallgerður. They are impressed with one another and are soon betrothed, despite Hrútur&#x27;s warnings about Hallgerður&#x27;s character, and Njáll&#x27;s misgivings.

Hrútur and Njáll are proven right when Hallgerður clashes with Njáll&#x27;s wife, Bergþóra. Hallgerður charms a number of dubious characters into killing members of Njáll&#x27;s household and the spirited Bergþóra arranges vengeance. After each killing, their husbands make financial settlements according to the status of the victims. The fifth victim is Þórður, foster-father of Njáll&#x27;s sons. Þráinn Sigfússon, Gunnar&#x27;s uncle and Hallgerður&#x27;s son-in-law, accompanies the killers. When the feud ends and settlements are made, Þráinn&#x27;s presence at that killing later causes conflict.

===Gunnar&#x27;s feuds===
Hallgerður now has one of her slaves, Melkólfur, burgle the home of a churlish man named Otkell. Gunnar immediately seeks to make amends, but his handsome offers are not accepted. A lawsuit is started against him which, with Njáll&#x27;s help, he wins, gaining great honour. However, while remonstrating with Hallgerður about the burglary, Gunnar slaps her.

This is followed by Otkell accidentally wounding Gunnar. Insult follows injury and Gunnar reluctantly goes to avenge himself. With belated help from his brother Kolskeggur, he kills Otkell and his companions.

Under Njáll&#x27;s influence a new settlement is arranged, and Gunnar&#x27;s reputation grows. Njáll warns him that this will be the start of his career of killings.

Next, Gunnar accepts a challenge to a horse-fight from a man called Starkaður. In the course of the fight, his opponents cheat, and Gunnar finds himself in a fresh squabble. Njáll tries to mediate but Þorgeir Starkaðsson refuses to accept it. On a journey with his two brothers, Gunnar is ambushed by Starkaður and his allies. In the battle, fourteen attackers and Gunnar&#x27;s brother Hjörtur are killed.

Worming through all this is Unnur&#x27;s son, Mörður Valgarðsson. Mörður envies and hates Gunnar, and uses other men to attain his aims. He has learned that Njáll prophesied that Gunnar will die if he kills twice in the same family and subsequently breaks the settlement for his death. He instigates an attack on Gunnar by persons dissatisfied by the settlement. Again, Gunnar wins the fight, but he kills a second man in the same family. The settlement that follows requires that Gunnar and Kolskeggur leave Iceland for three years.

Arrangements are made for exile. But as Gunnar leaves home, he looks homeward and, touched by the beauty of his homestead, resolves not to leave Iceland, thus becoming an outlaw. He goes about as though nothing has changed but his enemies, Mörður among them, seek revenge. He defends himself in his home until his bowstring is cut. Hallgerður refuses to give him strands of her hair to restring his bow; this is in revenge for the slap he once gave her. Gunnar&#x27;s enemies resist Mörður&#x27;s proposal to burn him in the house as shameful, but eventually they take the roof off to get to Gunnar. Njáll&#x27;s son Skarphéðinn assists Högni Gunnarsson in some acts of vengeance before a settlement is achieved.

===Kári and the sons of Njáll===
Scandinavian rulers honor two Icelandic expeditions: those of Þráinn Sigfússon and of Njáll&#x27;s two younger sons. Both return with enhanced honor, but also with companions. Þráinn brings back the malevolent Hrappur, the sons of Njáll and the noble Kári Sölmundarson, who marries their sister. But Njáll&#x27;s sons also bring back a grievance, blaming Þráinn for the way in which the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Norway, Jarl Hákon, has treated them while looking for Hrappur, who had been hidden by Þráinn. While Njáll says they have been foolish in raising the matter, he advises them to publicise it so that it will be seen as a matter of honor. Þrainn refuses a settlement, and his retainers, including Hallgerður, on her last appearance, insult them.

The most dramatic of the saga&#x27;s battles follows. Njáll&#x27;s sons, with Kári, prepare to ambush Þráinn and his followers. There is a bridge of ice over the river between them. Skarphéðinn overtakes his brothers, leaps the river, and slides on the ice past Þráinn, splitting his skull in passing. Between them the attackers kill four men, including Hrappur.

Þráinn&#x27;s brother, Ketill, has married Njáll&#x27;s daughter, and between them they bring about a settlement. Wishing to stop further contention, Njáll adopts Þráinn&#x27;s son Höskuldur as his foster-son. Höskuldur grows up in Njáll&#x27;s household, and is loved and favoured by him. When he is fully grown, Njáll attempts to find a suitable wife for him, Hildigunnur. However, she refuses, saying that she will only marry Höskuldur if he becomes a chieftain. Njáll manages to get Höskuldur a chieftaincy by instituting the Fifth Court at the Althing, and Höskuldur and Hildigunnur are married.

At this point, the saga recounts the conversion of Iceland to Christianity in 999.

===Höskuldur and Flosi, the burning===
Mörður Valgarðsson now finds Höskuldur to be such a successful chief that his own chieftaincy is declining. He sets the sons of Njáll against Höskuldur; the tragedy of the saga is that they are so susceptible to his promptings that they, with Mörður and Kári, murder him as he sows in his field. As one character says, &quot;Höskuldur was killed for less than no reason; all men mourn his death; but none more than Njáll, his foster-father&quot;.

Flosi, the uncle of Höskuldur&#x27;s wife, takes revenge against the killers, and seeks help from powerful chieftains. He is pressured (against his better judgement) by Hildigunnur to accept only blood vengeance. Njáll&#x27;s sons find themselves at the Althing having to plead for help. Skarphéðinn has become grimly fatalistic, and insults many who might help them.

After some legal sparring, arbitrators are chosen, including Snorri goði, who proposes a wergild of three times the normal compensation for Höskuldur. This is so much that it can only be paid if the arbitrators, and many at the Althing, contribute. The great collection is gathered, and Njáll adds a gift of a fancy cloak. Flosi claims to be insulted by the offer of a unisex garment (an insult from Skarphéðinn also adds fuel to the fire) and the settlement breaks down, with Njáll&#x27;s silence on the matter remaining unexplained.

Everyone leaves the Althing and prepares, amid portents and prophecies, for the showdown. A hundred men descend on Njáll&#x27;s home, Bergþórshvoll, to find it defended by about thirty. Any victory for Flosi will be at some cost. But Njáll suggests that his sons defend from within the house, and they, while realizing that this is futile, follow their father into certain death. Flosi and his men set fire to the building.

Both the innocent and the guilty are surrounded. Flosi allows the women to leave but beheads Helgi Njálsson, who attempts to escape disguised as a woman. Although Flosi invites Njáll and Bergþóra to leave, they refuse, preferring to die with their sons and their grandson Þórður (the son of Kári). Eventually eleven people die, not including Kári, who escapes under cover of the smoke by running along the beam of the house. Flosi knows that Kári will exact vengeance for the burning.

===The Althing===
At the Althing, both sides gather. Flosi bribes Eyjólfur Bölverksson, one of the finest lawyers in Iceland, into taking over the case, while his opponents blackmail Mörður Valgarðsson into prosecuting, advised by Þórhallur, Njáll&#x27;s foster-son, who was trained in the law by Njáll, but is kept away from the proceedings by an infected leg. There is a legal joust between the parties. Eventually, when his legal action seems to be failing, Þórhallur lances his boil with his spear and begins fighting. Flosi&#x27;s men are driven back until Snorri separates the parties. In the confusion, several are killed including Ljótur, Flosi&#x27;s brother-in-law.

Ljótur&#x27;s father, Hallur of Síða, takes advantage of the truce to appeal for peace, and seeks no compensation for his son. Moved by this, all but Kári and Njáll&#x27;s nephew Þorgeir reach a settlement, while everyone contributes to Ljótur&#x27;s weregild, which in the end amounts to a quadruple compensation. The burners are exiled.

Before the sons of Sigfús reach home, Kári attacks them, and most of the rest of the saga describes his vengeance for the burning. He is supported by Þorgeir and an attractive anti-hero named Björn. He pursues them to Orkney and Wales. The most dramatic moment is when he breaks into the earl&#x27;s hall in Orkney and kills a man who is giving a slanderous account of those killed at the burning.

After a pilgrimage to Rome, Flosi returns to Iceland. Kári follows, and is shipwrecked near Flosi&#x27;s home. Testing Flosi&#x27;s nobility he goes to him for help, and they arrange a final peace. Kári marries Höskuldur&#x27;s widow. Finally, there is a full reconciliation.

==Popular culture==
&quot;Njáls saga&quot; has influenced popular culture in different ways across a variety of media. A number of modern novels draw inspiration from the saga&#x27;s plot. These include, for example, Friðrik Ásmundsson Brekkan&#x27;s novels &quot;Ulveungernes broder/Saga af Bróður Ylfing&quot; (1924/1929) and &quot;Drottningarkyn&quot; (1947), Dorothy James Roberts&#x27; &quot;Fire in the Ice&quot; (1961), Henry Treece&#x27;s &quot;The Burning of Njal&quot; (1964), Tim Severin&#x27;s &quot;Viking-Trilogy&quot; (2005), Þórunn Erlu-Valdimarsdóttir&#x27;s crime novel &quot;Kalt er annars blóð&quot; (2007), Robert Jansson&#x27;s &quot;Kári&#x27;s Saga: A Novel of Viking Iceland&quot; (2008), Janni Lee Simner&#x27;s &quot;Thief Eyes&quot; (2011), and Bjarni Harðarson&#x27;s &quot;Mörður&quot; (2014). The Red Romance Book, a collection of heroic tales and legends published in 1905 and lavishly illustrated by Henry Justice Ford, includes three stories based on the saga: &quot;The Slaying of Hallgerda&#x27;s Husbands&quot;, &quot;The Death of Gunnar&quot;, and &quot;Njal&#x27;s Burning&quot;. Robert E. Howard&#x27;s story &quot;The Grey God Passes, or The Twilight of the Grey Gods&quot; (1962) also draws inspiration from the saga.

There are also a number of poetic works inspired by &quot;Njáls saga&quot;. These include Thomas Gray&#x27;s &quot;The Fatal Sisters&quot; (1768), Richard Hole&#x27;s &quot;The Tomb of Gunnar&quot; (1789), Jónas Hallgrímsson&#x27;s &quot;Gunnarshólmi&quot; (1838), Sigurður Breiðfjörð&#x27;s &quot;Rímur af Gunnari á Hlíðarenda&quot; (1860), Grímur Thomsen&#x27;s &quot;Gunnarsríma&quot; (1890) and his &quot;Íslenzkar konur frá söguöldinni&quot; (1895), and Helen von Engelhardt&#x27;s &quot;Gunnar von Hlidarendi&quot; (1909). Dramatic works deriving from the saga&#x27;s plot and characters include Gordon Bottomley&#x27;s &quot;The Riding to Lithend&quot; (1909), Jóhann Sigurjónsson&#x27;s &quot;Logneren/Lyga-Mörður&quot; (1917), Thit Jensen&#x27;s &quot;Nial den Vise&quot; (1934), and Sigurjón Jónsson&#x27;s Þiðrandi - sem dísir drápu (1950). Embla Ýr Bárudóttir and Ingólfur Örn Björgvinsson&#x27;s graphic novel adaptation of the saga, consisting of the four volumes &quot;Blóðregn&quot;, &quot;Brennan&quot;, &quot;Vetrarvíg&quot;, and &quot;Hetjan&quot;, was published in Iceland between 2003 and 2007.

In terms of film, television, and radio, the Icelandic short film called &quot;Brennu-Njálssaga&quot; (known by its English title in Europe as &quot;The Saga of Burnt Njal&quot;) was directed by Friðrik Þór Friðriksson and released 1981. It sarcastically depicted the burning of the book itself, not of the events described within it. The film is featured on the Icelandic DVD release of Angels of the Universe. Featured in the soundtrack is a song called &quot;Brennu-Njálssaga,&quot; composed by the Icelandic new wave band, Þeyr with the collaboration of Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson. This song later appeared in 1981 when the group released its single &quot;Iður til Fóta&quot; (in the cassette version only). The 1995 adventure film &quot;The Viking Sagas&quot; is inspired heavily by the saga, through it features an original plot. Episode 27 of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; is titled &quot;Njorl&#x27;s Saga&quot;. The &quot;saga&quot; in question is quite unrelated to any events in Njáls saga, despite the similarities between the names. In DreamWorks&#x27; animated series &quot;Dragons: Race to the Edge&quot; season 3 episode 3 a small excerpt from Njáls saga is chiseled into a sword and a wall in a cave using the Futhorc runic alphabet. The trope of a man trapped in a building and burned to death drives the Icelandic TV series &quot;Trapped&quot; (Ófærð). BBC Radio 3 broadcast &quot;The Saga of Burnt Njal&quot;, an audio adaptation by Hattie Naylor based on a translation by Benjamin Danielsson and directed by Gemma Jenkins, on 24 October 2021, with Justin Salinger as &quot;Njal&quot;, Christine Kavanagh as &quot;Bergthora&quot;, Justice Ritchie as &quot;Gunnar&quot;, Lisa Hammond as &quot;Hattgerd&quot;, Jasmine Hyde as &quot;Mord&quot; and Salomé Gunnarsdottir as &quot;The Voice of the Saga.&quot;

The saga&#x27;s influence is also discernible in other aspects of popular culture. In numerous Shanghai magazines, the Chinese composer Nie Er went by the English name &quot;George Njal&quot;, after a character in the saga. The Hallgerda Mons, a mountain on Venus, is named for Hallgerðr.

==Manuscripts and editions==

&quot;Njáls saga&quot; survives in around 60 manuscripts and fragments, 21 of which – an unusually large number – are from the Middle Ages. None of the vellum manuscripts survives complete, but they tended to be copied conservatively, indicating the reverence which Icelandic scribes have had for the saga and making it relatively easy to reconstruct a complete medieval text. The vellum manuscripts were classified most recently by Einar Ólafur Sveinsson in 1953, en route to his 1954 Íslenzk fornrit edition of the saga, which remains the standard edition. However, a project on &#x27;The Variance of &quot;Njáls saga&quot; &#x27;, based in the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies, is reassessing the complete history of the manuscript transmission of the saga.

The first printed edition of the saga, by Ólafur Ólafsson, based primarily on Reykjabók, with reference to Kálfalækjabók and Möðruvallabók, was published in Copenhagen in 1772. A major step in the editing of the saga was the 1875–89 critical edition of Konráð Gíslason and Eiríkur Jónsson. The current main edition is that of Einar Ólafur Sveinsson from 1954.

<doc id="140914" wikidata="Q9211" url="?curid=140914" title="Lao language">
<text>Lao (Lao: , ), sometimes referred to as Laotian, is the official language of Laos and a significant language in the Isan region of northeastern Thailand, where it is usually referred to as the Isan language. Spoken by over 3 million people in Laos and 3.7 million in all countries, it serves as a vital link in the cultural and social fabric of these areas. It is written in the Lao script, an abugida that evolved from ancient Tai scripts.

Lao is a tonal language, where the pitch or tone of a word can alter its meaning, and is analytic, forming sentences through the combination of individual words without inflection. These features, common in Kra-Dai languages, also bear similarities to Sino-Tibetan languages like Chinese or Austroasiatic languages like Vietnamese. Lao&#x27;s mutual intelligibility with Thai and Isan, fellow Southwestern Tai languages, allows for effective intercommunication among their speakers, despite differences in script and regional variations.

In Laos, Lao is not only the official language but also a lingua franca, bridging the linguistic diversity of a population that speaks many other languages. Its cultural significance is reflected in Laotian literature, media, and traditional arts. The Vientiane dialect has emerged as the de facto standard, though no official standard has been established. Internationally, Lao is spoken among diaspora communities, especially in countries like the United States, France, and Australia, reflecting its global diasporic presence.

***** Lao language (PDR Lao, Isan language)
The Lao language falls within the Lao-Phuthai group of languages, including its closest relatives, Phuthai (BGN/PCGN &quot;Phouthai&quot;, RTGS &quot;Phu Thai&quot;) and Tai Yo. Together with Northwestern Tai—which includes Shan, Ahom and most Dai languages of China, the Chiang Saen languages—which include Standard Thai, Khorat Thai, and Tai Lanna—and Southern Tai form the Southwestern branch of Tai languages. Lao (including Isan) and Thai, although they occupy separate groups, are mutually intelligible and were pushed closer through contact and Khmer influence, but all Southwestern Tai languages are mutually intelligible to some degree. The Tai languages also include the languages of the Zhuang, which are split into the Northern and Central branches of the Tai languages. The Tai languages form a major division within the Kra-Dai language family, distantly related to other languages of southern China, such as the Hlai and Be languages of Hainan and the Kra and Kam-Sui languages on the Chinese Mainland and in neighbouring regions of northern Vietnam.

==History==
=== Tai migration (8th–12th century) ===

The ancestors of the Lao people were speakers of Southwestern Tai dialects that migrated from what is now southeastern China, specifically what is now Guangxi and northern Vietnam where the diversity of various Tai languages suggests an &quot;Urheimat&quot;. The Southwestern Tai languages began to diverge from the Northern and Central branches of the Tai languages, covered mainly by various Zhuang languages, sometime around 112 CE, but likely completed by the sixth century. Due to the influx of Han Chinese soldiers and settlers, the end of the Chinese occupation of Vietnam, the fall of Jiaozhi and turbulence associated with the decline and fall of the Tang dynasty led some of the Tai peoples speaking Southwestern Tai to flee into Southeast Asia, with the small-scale migration mainly taking place between the eighth and twelfth centuries. The Tais split and followed the major river courses, with the ancestral Lao originating in the Tai migrants that followed the Mekong River.

===Divergence and convergence===
As the Southwestern Tai-speaking peoples diverged, following paths down waterways, their dialects began to diverge into the various languages today, such as the Lao-Phuthai languages that developed along the Mekong River and includes Lao and its Isan sub-variety and the Chiang Saen languages which includes the Central Thai dialect that is the basis of Standard Thai. Despite their close relationship, there were several phonological divergences that drifted the languages apart with time such as the following examples:

; PSWT *&quot;ml&quot; &gt; Lao /m/, &gt; Thai /l/

; PSWT *&quot;r&quot; (initial) &gt; Lao /h/, &gt; Thai /r/

; PSWT *&quot;ɲ&quot; &gt; Lao /ɲ/, &gt; Thai /j/
Similar influences and proximity allowed for both languages to converge in many aspects as well. Thai and Lao, although separated, passively influenced each other through centuries of proximity. For instance, the Proto-Southwestern Tai *&quot;mlɛːŋ&quot; has produced the expected Lao /m/ outcome &quot;maeng&quot; ( &quot;mèng&quot;, ) and the expected Thai /l/ outcome &quot;laeng&quot; ( ), although this is only used in Royal Thai or restricted academic usage, with the common form &quot;malaeng&quot; ( ), actually an archaic variant. In slang and relaxed speech, Thai also has &quot;maeng&quot; ( ), likely due to influence of Lao.

Thai and Lao also share similar sources of loan words. Aside from many of the deeply embedded Sinitic loan words adopted at various points in the evolution of Southwestern Tai at the periphery of Chinese influence, the Tais in Southeast Asia encountered the Khmer. Khmer loan words dominate all areas and registers of both languages and many are shared between them. Khmer loan words include body parts, urban living, tools, administration and local plants. The Thai, and likely the Lao, were able to make Khmer-style coinages that were later exported back to Khmer. The heavy imprint of Khmer is shown in the genetics of Tai speakers, with samples from Thai and Isan people of Lao descent showing proof of both the Tai migration but also intermarriage and assimilation of local populations. Scholars such as Khanittanan propose that the deep genetic and linguistic impact of the autochthonous Khmer and their language indicates that the earliest days of Ayutthaya had a largely bilingual population. Although evidence and research in Lao is lacking, major Lao cities were known to have been built atop existing Khmer settlements, suggesting assimilation of the locals. Isan and Lao commonly use a Khmer loan not found in Thai, &quot;khanong&quot; ( &quot;khanông&quot;, ), &#x27;doorframe&#x27;, from Khmer &quot;khnâng&quot; (, ), which means &#x27;building&#x27;, &#x27;foundation&#x27; or &#x27;dorsal ridge&#x27;.

Indic languages also pushed Thai and Lao closer together, particularly Sanskrit and Pali loan words that they share. Many Sanskrit words were adopted via the Khmer language, particularly concerning Indian concepts of astrology, astronomy, ritual, science, kingship, art, music, dance and mythology. New words were historically coined from Sanskrit roots just as European languages, including English, share Greek and Latin roots used for these purposes, such as &#x27;telephone&#x27; from Greek roots &quot;tēle&quot;, &#x27;distant&#x27; and &quot;phōnē&quot; which was introduced in Thai as &quot;thorasap&quot; (, ) and spread to Isan as &quot;thorasap&quot; ( &quot;thôrasap&quot;, ) from Sanskrit &quot;dura&quot; (, ), &#x27;distant&#x27;, and &quot;śabda&quot; (, ), &#x27;sound&#x27;. Indic influences also came via Pali, the liturgical language of Theravada Buddhism.

The effects of Khmer and Indic vocabulary did not affect all the Tai languages of Southeast Asia equally. The Tai Dam of northern Vietnam were shielded from the influence of the Khmer language and the Indic cultural influences that came with them and remain traditionally a non-Buddhist people. Although the Tai Dam language is a Chiang Saen language, albeit with a lexicon and phonology closer to Lao, the lack of Khmer, Sanskrit and Pali loan words makes the language unintelligible to Thai and Lao speakers.

=== Lan Xang (1354–1707) ===

Taking advantage of rapid decline in the Khmer Empire, Phra Chao Fa Ngoum ( ) defeated the Khmer and united the Tai &quot;mueang&quot; of what is now Laos and Isan into the mandala kingdom of Lan Xang in 1354. Fa Ngoum was a grandson of the ruler of Muang Xoua (RTGS &quot;Mueang Sawa&quot;), modern-day Louang Phrabang. Lan Xang was powerful enough to thwart Siamese designs from their base at Sukhothai and later Ayutthaya.

Khmer, and Sanskrit via Khmer, continued to influence the Lao language. Since Fa Ngoum was raised in the Khmer court, married to a Khmer princess and had numerous Khmer officials in his court, a now-extinct speech register known as &quot;rasa sap&quot; ( ) was developed to address or discuss the king and high-ranking clergy. Khmer and Sanskrit also contributed many belles-lettres as well as numerous technical, academic and cultural vocabulary, thus differentiating the Lao language from the tribal Tai peoples, but pushing the language closer to Thai, which underwent a similar process. The end of the Lao monarchy in 1975 made the Lao &quot;raxasap&quot; obsolete, but as Thailand retains its monarchy, Thai &quot;rachasap&quot; is still active.

The 16th century would see the establishment of many of the hallmarks of the contemporary Lao language. Scribes abandoned the use of written Khmer or Lao written in the Khmer alphabet, adopting a simplified, cursive form of the script known as &quot;Tai Noi&quot; that with a few modifications survives as the Lao script. Lao literature was also given a major boost with the brief union of Lan Xang with Lan Na during the reign of Xay Xétthathirat ( ) (1546–1551). The libraries of Chiang Mai were copied, introducing the &quot;tua tham&quot; (BGN/PCGN &quot;toua tham&quot;, RTGS &quot;tua tham&quot;) or &#x27;dharma letters&#x27; which was essentially the Mon-influenced script of Lan Na but was used in Lao specifically for religious literature. The influence of the related Tai Lan Na language was strengthened after the capitulation of Lan Na to the Burmese, leading many courtiers and people to flee to safety to Lan Xang.

==== Theravada Buddhism ====
Lan Xang was religiously diverse, with most of the people practicing Tai folk religion albeit somewhat influenced by local Austroasiatic animism, as well as the Brahmanism and Mahayana Buddhism introduced via the Khmer and Theravada Buddhism which had been adopted and spread by the Mon people. Although Lao belief is that the era of Lan Xang began the period of Theravada Buddhism for the Lao people, it was not until the mid-sixteenth century that the religion had become the dominant religion.

With Theravada Buddhism came its liturgical language, Pali, an Indic language derived from the Prakrit. Many Pali terms existed alongside earlier Sanskrit borrowings or were Sanskritized, leading to doublets such as Sanskrit &quot;maitri&quot; ( ) and Pali &quot;metta&quot; ( ), both of which signify &#x27;loving kindness&#x27; although the Sanskrit term is more generally used for &#x27;friendship&#x27;. The spread of Theravada Buddhism spread literacy, as monks served as teachers, teaching reading and writing as well other basic skills to village boys, and the Tai Noi script was used for personal letters, record-keeping, and signage, as well as to record short stories and the &quot;klon&quot; ( ) poetry that were often incorporated into traditional folksongs.
=== Lao Three Kingdoms period (1713–1893) ===
Despite the long presence of Lan Xang and Lao settlements along the riverbanks, the Khorat Plateau remained depopulated since the Post-Angkor Period and a long series of droughts during the 13th–15th centuries. The Lao settlements were found only along the banks of the Mekong River and in the wetter northern areas such as Nong Bua Lamphu, Loei, Nong Khai, with most of the population inhabiting the wetter left banks. This began to change when the golden age of Lao prosperity and cultural achievements under King Sourignavôngsa ( ) (1637–1694) ended with a successional dispute, with his grandsons, with Siamese intervention, carving out their separate kingdoms in 1707. From its ashes arose the kingdoms of Louang Phrabang, Vientiane and later in 1713, the Champasak. The arid hinterlands, deforested and depopulated after a series of droughts, likely led to the collapse of the Khmer Empire, was only occupied by small groups of Austroasiatic peoples and scattered outposts of Lao &quot;mueang&quot; in the far north. In 1718, Mueang Suwannaphum ( &quot;Muang Souvannaphoum&quot;, ) in 1718 in what is now Roi Et Province, was founded as an outpost of Champasak, establishing the first major Lao presence and the beginning of the expansion of Lao settlement along the Si ( ) and Mun () rivers.

The bulk of the Lao, however, settled after 1778 when King Taksin, Siamese king during the Thonburi Period (1767–1782) conquered Champasak and Vientiane and raided Phuan areas for slaves, seizing the Emerald Buddha and Phra Bang (although the latter was eventually returned) and forcing some of the Lao across the river to settle in Isan. Louang Phrabang was spared most of the destruction by submitting to Siamese overlordship. Although the kingdoms remained nominally autonomous, the Siamese demanded tribute and taxes, kept members of the respective royal houses as hostages to ensure loyalty and required the three Lao kings to come to the capital several times a year to hold an audience with the Siamese king. When the kingdoms revolted, the Siamese armies retaliated by rounding up entire villages, tattooing them to mark them as slaves and forced to settle what is now Isan, forced to serve as soldiers or manpower in corvée projects to build roads, to grow food, build canals, or serve as domestics. The greatest population transfer occurred after the Laotian Rebellion by Chao Anouvông (, ) in 1828 which led to the death of Anouvông and most of his family. The Siamese abducted nearly the entire population of Vientiane and its surrounding area and forced them to the right bank. Continued raids of people continued until the end of the nineteenth century.

In addition to forced transfers, many Lao were encouraged to settle in Isan, with some disillusioned princes granted lofty titles in exchange for loyalty and taxation, robbing the Lao kings of taxation and wealth as well as what little nominal authority they had left. This greatly expanded the Lao population of Isan and caused assimilation of the local peoples into the mix, a process that is occurring on a smaller scale even now. Siamese intervention paradoxically strengthened the Lao character of the region as the Siamese left the Lao areas alone as long as they continued to produce rice and continued to pay tribute. Direct Siamese rule did not extend past Nakhon Ratchasima, and the Lao &quot;mueang&quot;, whether paying their tribute directly to Bangkok or the remaining Lao kings and princes, were still nominally part of the separate kingdoms. Temples built in what is now Isan still featured the Tai Noi script on its murals and although Siam would intervene in some matters, daily administration was still left to the remaining kings and various Lao princes that served as governors of the larger &quot;mueang&quot;. The result of the population movements re-centered the Lao world to the right bank, as today, if Isan and Lao speakers are counted together, Isan speakers form 80 percent of the Lao-speaking population.

===French Laos (1893–1953)===

During French rule, missing words for new technologies and political realities were borrowed from French or Vietnamese, repurposed from old Lao vocabulary as well as coined from Sanskrit. These Sanskrit-derived neologisms were generally the same, although not always, as those that developed in Thai.

Whilst previously written in a mixture of etymological and phonetical spellings, depending on audience or author, Lao underwent several reforms that moved the language towards a purely phonetical spelling. During the restoration of the king of Louang Phabang as King of Laos under the last years of French rule in Laos, the government standardized the spelling of the Lao language, with movement towards a phonetical spelling with preservation of a semi-etymological spelling for Pali, Sanskrit and French loan words and the addition of archaic letters for words of Pali and Sanskrit origin concerning Indic culture and Buddhism.

===Independence and Communist rule (1953–present)===

Spelling reforms under the communist rule of Laos in 1975 were more radical, with the complete abolition of semi-etymological spelling in favor of phonetical spelling, with the removal of silent letters, removal of special letters for Indic loan words, all vowels being written out explicitly and even the elimination or replacement of the letter &#x27;ຣ&#x27; (but usually pronounced /l/) in official publications, although older people and many in the Lao diaspora continue to use some of the older spelling conventions.

==Dialects==
The standard written Lao based on the speech of Vientiane has leveled many lexical differences between dialects found in Laos, and although spoken regional variations remain strong, speakers will adjust to it in formal situations and in dealings with outsiders.

===Vientiane Lao dialect===
In Laos, the written language has been mainly based on Vientiane Lao for centuries after the capital of Lan Xang was moved in 1560. The speech of the old élite families was cultivated into Standard Lao as emulated by television and radio broadcasts from the capital as well as taught to foreign students of Lao. The speech of the Isan city of Nong Khai, which sits on the opposite bank of the Mekong, is almost indistinguishable in tone and accent from the speech of Vientiane. Vientiane Lao predominates in Vientiane City, the surrounding Vientiane Province and portions of Bolikhamxai and some areas of Xaisômboun.

In Isan, Vientiane Lao is the primary form of Isan spoken in the northern third of the region which was long settled since the days of Lan Xang and was ruled as part of the Kingdom of Vientiane, including most of Nong Khai, Nong Bua Lamphu, eastern Loei and portions of Saiyaphum and Bueng Kan. As a result of the Lao rebellion of 1826 the &quot;Tai Wiang&quot; (), ), &#x27;Vientiane people&#x27; of the city and surrounding parts of the kingdom, were rounded up by Siamese armies and forced to the right bank, greatly boosting the Lao population of what is now Isan. The Tai Wiang strengthened numbers in the northern third, where Vientiane Lao was traditionally spoken, but were scattered across the Isan region overall, with heavier concentrations in Yasothon, Khon Kaen, and Hoi Et provinces. This likely had a leveling effect on the Lao language as spoken in Isan, as most Isan speakers regardless of speech variety are prone to using /ʋ/ as opposed to /w/ and the informal conversion of syllable-initial /k/ to /tɕ/ in relaxed, informal speech, which in Laos, is particularly characteristic of Vientiane speech. For example, the word &quot;kaem&quot; ( &quot;kèm&quot;, ), &#x27;cheek&#x27;, is often pronounced *&quot;chaem&quot; (* &quot;chèm&quot;, *).

===Northern Lao (Louang Phrabang) dialect===
Northern Lao is a very distinct dialect, exhibiting several features and lexical differences quite apart from other Lao dialects except Northeastern Lao (Phuan). Even though it borders the Vientiane Lao dialect region, there is a sharp boundary that divides them. The dialect shares many similarities with Tai Lanna and is classified accordingly as a Chiang Saen language by Ethnologue. The dialect is not common in Isan, restricted to western portions of Loei and pockets of villages spread throughout Udon Thani provinces. The Isan people of Phitsanulok and Uttaradit provinces, particularly the narrow strip hugging the shore of the Mekong and bordering Loei, outside of Isan are generally speakers of Northern Lao. In Laos, it is the primary dialect spoken in Louang Phrabang and Xaignabouli provinces. In the other northern Laotian provinces of Oudômxai, Houaphan, Louang Namtha and Phôngsali, native Lao speakers are a small minority in the major market towns but Northern Lao, highly influenced by the local languages, is spoken as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; across ethnic groups of the area.

Northern Lao, specifically the speech of the city of Louang Phrabang was originally the prestigious variety of the language with the city serving as the capital of Lan Xang for the first half of its existence, with the kings of the city made kings of all of Laos by the French. Although the language lost its prestige to Vientiane Lao, Northern Lao is important for its history, as many of the earliest Lao literary works were composed in the dialect, and it served, in a refined form, as the royal speech of the Laotian kings until 1975 when the monarchy was abolished. Louang Phrabang remains the largest city in the northern region of Laos, serving as an important center of trade and communication with the surrounding areas.

Despite the proximity to speakers of Vientiane Lao, Northern Lao is quite distinct. Unlike other Lao dialects with six tones, Northern Lao speakers use only five. Due to the distinctive high-pitch, high-falling tone on words with live syllables starting with low-class consonants, the dialect is said to sound softer, sweeter and more effeminate than other Lao dialects, likely aided by the slower speed of speaking. Similar in tonal structure and quality to Tai Lanna, likely facilitated by the immigration of Lanna people to Louang Phrabang after Chiang Mai&#x27;s fall to the Burmese in 1551, the dialect is classified apart from other Lao dialects as Chiang Saen language by Ethnologue. Northern Lao also resisted the merger of Proto-Tai * and * that occurred in all other Lao dialects, except Northeastern Lao. This affects the twenty or so words represented by Thai &quot; and Lao &quot;, which preserve /aɰ/ in Northern Lao. This vowel has become /aj/, similar to Thai &quot; and Lao &quot; which is also /aj/. Northern Lao also contains numerous terms not familiar to other Lao speakers.



===Northeastern Lao dialect (Tai Phouan)===

The Phuan language is a Chiang Saen (Thai) language rather than part of the Lao–Phutai languages, but it is considered a Lao dialect in Laos. As a Tai language of northern Southeast Asia, it shares many similarities with Tai Dam and Tai Lan Na. In contrast to other minority languages of Isan, it is not losing ground to the Thai or Isan language in Isan.

===Central Lao===
Central Lao represents a transitional variety, with northern varieties closer to Vientiane Lao and southern varieties, roughly south of the confluence of the Xé Noi river with the Mekong, the speech varieties begin to approach Southern Lao. Some linguists, such as Hartmann, place Vientiane Lao and Central Lao together as a singular dialect region. More Vientiane-like speech predominates in the Isan provinces of Bueng Kan, Sakon Nakhon, most of Nakhon Phanom and some areas of Nong Khai provinces and on the Laotian side, portions of eastern and southern Bolikhamxai and Khammouan provinces. More Southern Lao features are found in the speech of Mukdahan and southern Nakhon Phanom provinces of Thailand and Savannakhét Province of Laos.

Nevertheless, the tones of the southern Central varieties, such as spoken in Mukdahan, Thailand and Savannakhét, Laos have a tonal structure more akin to Vientiane Lao, sharing certain splits and contours. These areas do, however, exhibit some Southern features of their lexicon, such as the common use of &quot;se&quot; ( &quot;xé&quot;, ), &#x27;river&#x27;, which is typical of Southern Lao as opposed to &quot;nam&quot; (, ), which is the more common word and also signifies &#x27;water&#x27; in general. Mukdahan-Savannakhét area speakers also understand &quot;mae thao&quot; (, ) as a respectful term for an &#x27;old lady&#x27; (as opposed to Vientiane &#x27;mother-in-law&#x27;) and use &quot;pen sang&quot; (, ) instead of Vientiane &quot;pen yang&quot; (, ), &#x27;what&#x27;s wrong?&#x27;, as is typical of Southern Lao.

===Southern Lao===
Southern Lao is spoken along the southern third of Isan and Laos. This region covers the Thai provinces of Surin, Buriram and Sisaket, where a large minority of speakers are Khmer people speaking the archaic northern variety of Khmer and another Austroasiatic people, the Kuy people, use Southern Lao as a second language to engage with their Isan neighbors. It is also spoken in Ubon Ratsathani, Amnat Charoen and portions of Yasothon and Nakhon Ratsasima. In Laos, it is the primary dialect of Champasak, Salavan, Attapeu and Xékong provinces. There are also small pockets of speakers located in Steung Treng Province, Cambodia or &quot;Siang Taeng&quot; (, ), particularly near the Mekong River close to the Laotian border. Many of the areas where Southern Lao is spoken were formerly part of the Kingdom of Champasak, one of the three successor states to the Kingdom of Lan Xang, prior to the division of the Lao-speaking world between France and Siam.

Compared to other Isan and Lao dialects, Southern Lao has low tones in syllables that begin with high- or middle-class consonants and have long vowels. High- and middle-class consonants marked with the &quot;mai tho&quot; tone mark are low and low-falling, respectively, but in these cases are pronounced with very strong glottalization, which can be described as &#x27;creaky&#x27;. Combined with the somewhat faster manner of speaking and reduced tendency to soften consonants at the end of words, Southern Lao sounds very rough and harsh to speakers of other dialects. Many of these features, such as the faster speaking pace and glottalization may be influences from Austroasiatic languages as most of the region was inhabited by the Khmer, Kuy and various other Austroasiatic peoples until the eighteenth century when the Lao began to settle and even now, Khmer speakers comprise half the population of Surin and roughly a quarter each of the populations of Sisaket and Buriram provinces.

Specific dialectal words include &quot;don&quot; (, ), &#x27;riparian island&#x27;, &quot;se&quot; ( xé, /sȅː/)) and many of the words used in Savannakhét that are more typical of Southern Lao such as &quot;mae thao&quot; (, ) as a respectful term for an &#x27;old lady&#x27; (as opposed to Vientiane &#x27;mother-in-law&#x27;) and use &quot;pen sang&quot; (, ) instead of Vientiane &quot;pen yang&quot; ( &quot;pén gnang&quot;, ), &#x27;what&#x27;s wrong?&#x27;. Possibly as a result of historical Khmer influence and current influences from Thai, Southern dialects tend to pronounce some words with initial Proto-Southwestern Tai * as either the rhotic tap or a strongly velarized which is confused with by speakers of other Lao dialects which have /h/. For example, Vientiane Lao &quot;hap&quot; (, ), &#x27;to receive&#x27;, and &quot;hong haem&quot; ( &quot;hônghèm&quot;, ) are pronounced as &quot;lap&quot; (, ) and &quot;honglaem&quot; ( &quot;hônglèm&quot;, ), respectively but may sound like *&quot;dap&quot; and *&quot;hongdaem&quot; (&quot;hông dèm&quot;) to other Lao, but are really a strongly velarized /ɬ/ or a rhotic tap /ɾ/. Southerners also tend to use &quot;chak&quot; (, ) to mean &#x27;to know someone&#x27; as opposed to &quot;hu chak&quot; ( &quot;hou chak&quot;, ) used in all other dialects.

===Western Lao===
Western Lao (Standard Isan) does not occur in Laos but is the primary dialect of Khon Kaen, Kalasin, Roi Et, and Maha Sarakham in Isan, Thailand. It is also spoken in much of Chaiyaphum and portions of Nakhon Ratsasima.

==Vocabulary==

The Lao language consists primarily of native Lao words. Because of Buddhism, however, Pali has contributed numerous terms, especially relating to religion and in conversation with members of the sangha. Due to their proximity, Lao has influenced the Khmer and Thai languages and vice versa.

Formal writing has a larger number of loanwords, especially Pali and Sanskrit, much as Latin and Greek have influenced European languages. For politeness, pronouns (and more formal pronouns) are used, plus ending statements with (dae ) or (doe ). Negative statements are made more polite by ending with (dok ). The following are formal register examples.
* (khop chai lai lai doe, ) &quot;Thank you very much&quot;.
* (kha noi het bo lai dok, ) &quot;I cannot&quot;.
* (khai patu hai dae, ) &quot;Open the door, please&quot;.

=== French loanwords ===
After the division of the Lao-speaking world in 1893, French would serve as the administrative language of the French Protectorate of Laos, carved from the Lao lands of the left bank, for sixty years until 1953 when Laos achieved full independence. The close relationship of the Lao monarchy with France continued the promotion and spread of French until the end of the Laotian Civil War when the monarchy was removed and the privileged position of French began its decline. Many of the initial borrowings for terms from Western culture were imported via French. For instance, Lao uses &quot;sangtimet&quot; ( ) in an approximation of French &quot;centimètre&quot; (). Lao people also tend to use French forms of geographic place names, thus the Republic of Guinea is &quot;kine&quot; ( ) from French &quot;Guinée&quot; ().

Although English has mostly surpassed French as the preferred foreign language of international diplomacy and higher education since the country began opening up to foreign investment in the 1990s, the position of French is stronger in Laos than in Cambodia and Vietnam. Since 1972, Laos has been associated with La Francophonie, achieving full-member status in 1992. Many of the royalists and high-ranking families of Laos left Laos in the wake of the end of the Laotian Civil War for France, but as of 2010, it was estimated that 173,800 people, or three percent of the population, were fluent in French and French is studied by 35% of the population as a second language as a required subject and many courses in engineering, medicine, law, administration and other advanced studies are only available in French.

Laos maintains the French-language weekly &quot;Le Rénovateur&quot;, but French-language content is sometimes seen alongside English in publications in older issues of &quot;Khaosane Phathét Lao News&quot; and sporadically on television ad radio. French still appears on signage, is the language of major civil engineering projects and is the language of the élite, especially the older generations that received secondary and tertiary education in French-medium schools or studied in France. France maintains a large Lao diaspora and some of the very well-to-do still send their children to France for study. The result of this long-standing French influence is the use of hundreds of loan words of French origin in the Lao language of Laos—although many are old-fashioned and somewhat obsolete or co-exist alongside more predominant native usages. They may be contrasted with the neighbouring languages in Thailand, which borrowed from English instead of French.

=== Vietnamese loanwords ===
Because of the depopulation of the left bank to Siam prior to French colonization, the French who were already active in Vietnam brought Vietnamese to boost the population of the cities and help administer the region. Many Lao that received a French-language education during the period of French Indochina were educated in French-language schools in Vietnam, exposing them to French and Vietnamese languages and cultures. As the Vietnamese communists supported the &quot;Pathét Lao&quot; forces, supplying Lao communist militia with weaponry and training during the two-decade-long Laotian Civil War, large numbers of Vietnamese troops have been stationed at various times in Laos&#x27; post-independence history, although the Vietnamese military presence began to wane in the late 1980s as Laos pursued closer relations with its other neighbors and entered the market economy. Since market reforms in Vietnam, market liberalization has been the main focus between the two countries now.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
Many consonants in Lao have a labialized and plain form, thus creating a phonemic contrast. The complete inventory of Lao consonants is as shown in the table below:

==== Initial consonants ====
==== Final consonants ====
All plosive sounds (besides the glottal stop ) are unreleased in final position. Hence, final , , and sounds are pronounced as , , and respectively.

:* The glottal stop appears at the end when no final follows a short vowel.

===Vowels===
All vowels make a phonemic length distinction. Diphthongs are all centering diphthongs with falling sonority. The monophthongs and diphthongs are as shown in the following table:


===Tones===
Lao has six lexical tones. However, the Vientiane and the Luang Prabang dialects have five tones (see below) (Brown 1965; Osatananda, 1997, 2015).

==== Smooth syllables ====
There are six tones in smooth syllables, that is, in syllables ending in a vowel or other sonorant sound ( and ).


==== Checked syllables ====
The number of contrastive tones is reduced to four in checked syllables, that is, in syllables ending in an obstruent sound ( or the 
glottal stop ).

===Syllables===
Lao syllables are of the form (C)V(C), i.e., they consist of a vowel in the syllable nucleus, optionally preceded by a single consonant in the syllable onset and optionally followed by a single consonant in the syllable coda. The only consonant clusters allowed are syllable initial clusters . Any consonant may appear in the onset, but the labialized consonants do not occur before rounded vowels.

One difference between Thai and Lao is that in Lao initial clusters are simplified. For example, the official name of Laos is Romanized as &quot;Sathalanalat Paxathipatai Paxaxon Lao&quot; or &quot;Sathalanalat Pasathipatai Pasason Lao&quot;, with the Thai analog being &quot;Satharanarat Prachathipatai Prachachon Lao&quot; (), indicating the simplification of Thai &quot;pr&quot; to Lao &quot;p&quot;.

Only may appear in the coda. If the vowel in the nucleus is short, it must be followed by a consonant in the coda; in the coda can be preceded only by a short vowel. Open syllables (i.e., those with no coda consonant) and syllables ending in one of the sonorants take one of the six tones, syllables ending in take one of four tones, and syllables ending in take one of only two tones.

==Grammar==

The majority of Lao words are monosyllabic, and are not inflected to reflect declension or verbal tense, making Lao an analytic language. Special particle words serve the purpose of prepositions and verb tenses in lieu of conjugations and declensions. Lao is a subject–verb–object (SVO) language, although the subject is often dropped. In contrast to Thai, Lao uses pronouns more frequently.

===Numbers===
==Writing system==
===Lao script===
The Lao script, derived from the Khmer alphabet of the Khmer Empire in the 14th century, is ultimately rooted in the Pallava script of Southern India, one of the Brahmi scripts. Although the Lao script bears resemblance to Thai, the former contains fewer letters than Thai because by 1960 it was simplified to be fairly &quot;phonemic&quot;, whereas Thai maintains many etymological spellings that are pronounced the same.

The script is traditionally classified as an abugida, but Lao consonant letters are conceived of as simply representing the consonant sound, rather than a syllable with an inherent vowel. Vowels are written as diacritic marks and can be placed above, below, in front of, or behind consonants. The script also contains distinct symbols for numerals, although Arabic numerals are more commonly used.

Lao is written in the Tai Tham script for liturgical purposes and is still used in temples in Laos and Isan.

====Indication of tones====
Experts disagree on the number and nature of tones in the various dialects of Lao. According to some, most dialects of Lao and Isan have six tones, those of Luang Prabang have five. Tones are determined as follows:

A silent () placed before certain consonants will place the proceeding consonant in the high class tone. This can occur before the letters , , , and and combined in special ligatures (considered separate letters) such as , , and . In addition to (low tone) and (falling tone), there also exists the rare (high) (rising) tone marks.

===Tai Tham script===
Traditionally, only secular literature was written with the Lao alphabet. Religious literature was often written in &quot;Tai Tham&quot;, a Mon-based script that is still used for the Tai Khün, Tai Lü, and formerly for Kham Mueang. The Lao style of this script is known as &quot;Lao Tham&quot;.

===Khom script===
Mystical, magical, and some religious literature was written in &quot;Khom script&quot; (Aksar Khom), a modified version of the Khmer script.

<doc id="140917" wikidata="Q47519411" url="?curid=140917" title="History of Baden-Württemberg">
<text>The history of Baden-Württemberg covers the area included in the historical state of Baden, the former Prussian Hohenzollern, and Württemberg, part of the region of Swabia since the 9th century.

In the 1st century AD, Württemberg was occupied by the Romans, who defended their control of the territory by constructing a &quot;limes&quot; (fortified boundary zone). Early in the 3rd century, the Alemanni drove the Romans beyond the Rhine and the Danube, but they in turn succumbed to the Franks under Clovis I, the decisive battle taking place in 496. The area later became part of the Holy Roman Empire.

The history of Baden as a state began in the 12th century, as a fief of the Holy Roman Empire. As a fairly inconsequential margraviate that was divided between various branches of the ruling family for much of its history, it gained both status and territory during the Napoleonic era, when it was also raised to the status of grand duchy. In 1871, it became one of the founder states of the German Empire. The monarchy came to an end with the end of the First World War, but Baden itself continued in existence as a state of Germany until the end of the Second World War.

Württemberg, often spelled &quot;Wirtemberg&quot; or &quot;Wurtemberg&quot; in English, developed as a political entity in southwest Germany, with the core established around Stuttgart by Count Conrad (died 1110). His descendants expanded Württemberg while surviving Germany&#x27;s religious wars, changes in imperial policy, and invasions from France. The state had a basic parliamentary system that changed to absolutism in the 18th century. Recognised as a kingdom in 1806–1918, its territory now forms part of the modern German state of Baden-Württemberg, one of the 16 states of Germany, a relatively young federal state that has only existed since 1952. The coat of arms represents the state&#x27;s several historical component parts, of which Baden and Württemberg are the most important.

== Celts, Romans and Alemani ==

The origin of the name &quot;Württemberg&quot; remains obscure. Scholars have universally rejected the once-popular derivation from &quot;Wirth am Berg&quot;. Some authorities derive it from a proper name: &quot;Wiruto&quot; or &quot;Wirtino,&quot; others from a Celtic place-name, &quot;Virolunum&quot; or &quot;Verdunum&quot;. In any event, from serving as the name of a castle near the Stuttgart city district of Rotenberg, the name extended over the surrounding country and, as the lords of this district increased their possessions, so the name covered an ever-widening area, until it reached its present extent. Early forms included &quot;Wirtenberg&quot;, &quot;Wirtembenc&quot; and &quot;Wirtenberc&quot;. &quot;Wirtemberg&quot; was long accepted, and in the latter part of the 16th century &quot;Würtemberg&quot; and &quot;Wurttemberg&quot; appeared. In 1806, &quot;Württemberg&quot; became the official spelling, though &quot;Wurtemberg&quot; also appears frequently and occurs sometimes in official documents, and even on coins issued after that date.

Württemberg&#x27;s first known inhabitants, the Celts, preceded the arrival of the Suebi. In the first century AD, the Romans conquered the land and defended their position there by constructing a rampart (&quot;limes&quot;). Early in the third century, the Alemanni drove the Romans beyond the Rhine and the Danube, but they in turn succumbed to the Franks under Clovis, the decisive battle taking place in 496. For about 400 years, the district was part of the Frankish empire and was administered by counts until it was in the ninth century by the German Duchy of Swabia.

== Duchy of Swabia ==


The Duchy of Swabia is to a large degree comparable to the territory of the Alemanni. The Suevi (Sueben or Swabians) belonged to the tribe of the Alemanni, reshaped in the 3rd century. The name of Swabia is also derived from them. From the 9th century on, in place of the area designation &quot;Alemania,&quot; came the name &quot;Schwaben&quot; (Swabia). Swabia was one of the five stem duchies of the medieval Kingdom of the East Franks, and its dukes were thus among the most powerful magnates of Germany. The most notable family to hold Swabia were the Hohenstaufen, who held it, with a brief interruption, from 1079 until 1268. For much of this period, the Hohenstaufen were also Holy Roman Emperors. With the death of Conradin, the last Hohenstaufen duke, the duchy itself disintegrated although King Rudolf I attempted to revive it for his Habsburg family in the late 13th century.

With the decline of East Francia power, the House of Zähringen appeared to be ready as the local successor of the power in southwestern Germany and in the northwest in the Kingdom of Burgundy-Arles. Duke Berthold V of Zähringen founded the city of Bern in 1191, which became one of the House of Zähringen power centers. East of the Jura Mountains and west of the Reuss was described as Upper Burgundy, and Bern was part of the Landgraviate of Burgundy, which was situated on both sides of the Aar, between Thun and Solothurn. However Berthold died without an heir in 1218 and Bern was declared a Free imperial city by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. Berthold&#x27;s death without heirs meant the complete disintegration of southwest Germany and led to the development of the Old Swiss Confederacy and the Duchy of Burgundy. Bern joined Switzerland in the year 1353.

Swabia takes its name from the tribe of the Suebi, and the name was often used interchangeably with &quot;Alemannia&quot; during the existence of the stem-duchy in the High Middle Ages. Even Alsace belonged to it. Swabia was otherwise of great importance in securing the pass route to Italy. After the fall of the Staufers there was never again a Duchy of Swabia. The Habsburgs and the Württembergers endeavored in vain to resurrect it.

== Hohenstaufen, Welf and Zähringen ==


Three of the noble families of the southwest attained a special importance: the Hohenstaufen, the Welf and the Zähringen. The most successful appear from the view of that time to be the Hohenstaufen, who, as dukes of Swabia from 1079 and as Frankish kings and emperors from 1138 to 1268, attained the greatest influence in Swabia. To the Zähringer sphere of influence originally belonged Freiburg and Offenburg, Rottweil and Villingen, and, in modern Switzerland, Zürich and Bern. The three prominent noble families were in vigorous competition with one another, even though they were linked by kinship. The mother of the Stauffer King Friedrich Barbarossa (Red beard) was Judith Welfen. The Staufers, as well as the Zähringers, based their claims of rule on ties with the family of the Frankish kings from the House of Salier.

During the Middle Ages, various counts ruled the territory that now forms Baden, among whom the counts and duchy of Zähringen figure prominently. In 1112, Hermann, son of Hermann, Margrave of Verona (died 1074) and grandson of Duke Berthold II of Carinthia and the Count of Zähringen, having inherited some of the German estates of his family, called himself Margrave of Baden. The separate history of Baden dates from this time. Hermann appears to have called himself &quot;margrave&quot; rather than &quot;count,&quot; because of the family connection to the margrave of Verona. His son and grandson, both called Hermann, added to their territories, which were then divided, and the lines of Baden-Baden and Baden-Hochberg were founded, the latter of which divided about a century later into Baden-Hochberg and Baden-Sausenberg. The family of Baden-Baden was very successful in increasing the area of its holdings.

The Hohenstaufen family controlled the duchy of Swabia until the death of Conradin in 1268, when a considerable part of its lands fell to the representative of a family first mentioned in about 1080, the count of Württemberg, Conrad von Beutelsbach, who took the name from his ancestral castle of Württemberg.

The earliest historical details of a Count of Württemberg relate to one Ulrich I, Count of Württemberg, who ruled from 1241 to 1265. He served as marshal of Swabia and advocate of the town of Ulm, had large possessions in the valleys of the Neckar and the Rems, and acquired Urach in 1260. Under his sons, Ulrich II and Eberhard I, and their successors, the power of the family grew steadily.

== Further Austria and the Palatinate ==
Other than the Margraviate of Baden and the Duchy of Württemberg, Further Austria and the Palatinate lay on the edge of the southwestern area. Further Austria (in German: Vorderösterreich or &quot;die Vorlande&quot;) was the collective name for the old possessions of the Habsburgs in south-western Germany (Swabia), the Alsace, and in Vorarlberg after the focus of the Habsburgs had moved to Austria.

Further Austria comprised the Sundgau (southern Alsace) and the Breisgau east of the Rhine (including Freiburg im Breisgau after 1386) and included some scattered territories throughout Swabia, the largest being the margravate Burgau in the area of Augsburg and Ulm. Some territories in Vorarlberg that belonged to the Habsburgs were also considered part of Further Austria. The original homelands of the Habsburgs, the Aargau and much of the other original Habsburg possessions south of the Rhine and Lake Constance were lost in the 14th century to the expanding Old Swiss Confederacy after the battles of Morgarten (1315) and Sempach (1386) and were never considered part of Further Austria, except the Fricktal, which remained a Habsburg property until 1805.

Further Austria was ruled by the Duke of Austria until 1379. After that, the regent of Further Austria was the Count of Tyrol.

The Palatinate arose as the County Palatine of the Rhine, a large feudal state lying on both banks of the Rhine, which seems to have come into existence in the 10th century. The territory fell to the Wittelsbach Dukes of Bavaria in the early 13th century, and during a later division of territory among the heirs of Duke Louis II of Upper Bavaria in 1294, the elder branch of the Wittelsbachs came into possession not only of the Rhenish Palatinate, but also of that part of Upper Bavaria itself which was north of the Danube, and which came to be called the Upper Palatinate (&quot;Oberpfalz&quot;), in contrast to the Lower Palatinate along the Rhine. In the Golden Bull of 1356, the Palatinate was made one of the secular electorates, and given the hereditary offices of Archsteward of the Empire and Imperial Vicar of the western half of Germany. From this time forth, the Count Palatine of the Rhine was usually known as the Elector Palatine.

Due to the practice of division of territories among different branches of the family, by the early 16th century junior lines of the Palatine Wittelsbachs came to rule in Simmern, Kaiserslautern, and Zweibrücken in the Lower Palatinate, and in Neuburg and Sulzbach in the Upper Palatinate. The Elector Palatine, now based in Heidelberg, converted to Lutheranism in the 1530s.

When the senior branch of the family died out in 1559, the Electorate passed to Frederick III of Simmern, a staunch Calvinist, and the Palatinate became one of the major centers of Calvinism in Europe, supporting Calvinist rebellions in both the Netherlands and France. Frederick III&#x27;s grandson, Frederick IV, and his adviser, Christian of Anhalt, founded the Evangelical Union of Protestant states in 1608, and in 1619 Elector Frederick V (the son-in-law of King James I of England) accepted the throne of Bohemia from rebellious Protestant noblemen. He was soon defeated by the forces of Emperor Ferdinand II at the Battle of White Mountain in 1620, and Spanish and Bavarian troops soon occupied the Palatinate itself. In 1623, Frederick was put under the ban of the Empire, and his territories and Electoral dignity granted to the Duke (now Elector) of Bavaria, Maximilian I.

At the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, the Sundgau became part of France, and in the 18th century, the Habsburgs acquired a few minor new territories in southern Germany such as Tettnang. In the Peace of Pressburg of 1805, Further Austria was dissolved and the formerly Habsburg territories were assigned to Bavaria, Baden, and Württemberg, and the Fricktal to Switzerland.

By the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, Frederick V&#x27;s son, Charles Louis, was restored to the Lower Palatinate, and given a new electoral title, but the Upper Palatinate and the senior electoral title remained with the Bavarian line. In 1685, the Simmern line died out, and the Palatinate was inherited by the Count Palatine of Neuburg (who was also Duke of Jülich and Berg), a Catholic. The Neuburg line, which moved the capital to Mannheim, lasted until 1742, when it, too, became extinct, and the Palatinate was inherited by the Duke Karl Theodor of Sulzbach. The childless Karl Theodor also inherited Bavaria when its electoral line became extinct in 1777, and all the Wittelsbach lands save Zweibrücken on the French border (whose Duke was, in fact, Karl Theodor&#x27;s presumptive heir) were now under a single ruler. The Palatinate was destroyed in the Wars of the French Revolution—first its left bank territories were occupied, and then annexed, by France starting in 1795, and then, in 1803, its right bank territories were taken by the Margrave of Baden. The provincial government in Alsace was alternately administered by the Palatinate (1408–1504, 1530–1558) and by the Habsburgs (13th and 14th centuries, 1504–1530). Only the margraves of Baden and the counts and dukes of Württemberg included both homelands within their territories. With the political reordering of the southwest after 1800, Further Austria and the Electorate Palatine disappeared from history.

== Baden and Württemberg before the Reformation ==


The family of Baden-Baden was very successful in increasing the area of its holdings, which after several divisions were united by the margrave Bernard I in 1391. Bernard, a soldier of some renown, continued the work of his predecessors and obtained other districts, including Baden-Hochberg, the ruling family of which died out in 1418.

During the 15th century, a war with the Count Palatine of the Rhine deprived the Margrave Charles I (died 1475) of a part of his territories, but these losses were more than recovered by his son and successor, Christoph I of Baden (&quot;illustration, right&quot;). In 1503, the family Baden-Sausenberg became extinct, and the whole of Baden was united by Christophe. In Baden, however, a partitioning occurred that lasted from 1515 to 1771. Moreover, the various parts of Baden were always physically separated one from the other.

The lords of Württemberg were first named in 1092. Supposedly a Lord of Virdeberg by Luxembourg had married an heiress of the lords of Beutelsbach. The new Wirtemberg Castle (castle chapel dedicated in 1083) was the central point of a rule that extended from the Neckar and Rems valleys in all directions over the centuries.

Eberhard I, Count of Württemberg opposed, sometimes successfully, three Holy Roman emperors. He doubled the area of his county and transferred his residence from Württemberg Castle to the &quot;Old Castle&quot; in today&#x27;s city centre of Stuttgart.

His successors were not as prominent, but all added something to the land area of Württemberg. In 1381, the Duchy of Teck was bought, and marriage to an heiress added Montbéliard in 1397. The family divided its lands among collateral branches several times but, in 1482, the Treaty of Münsingen reunited the territory, declared it indivisible, and united it under Count Eberhard V, called &quot;im Bart&quot; (The Bearded). This arrangement received the sanction of the Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian I, and of the Imperial Diet, in 1495.

Unusually for Germany, from 1457 Württemberg had a bicameral parliament, the &quot;Landtag&quot;, known otherwise as the &quot;diet&quot; or &quot;Estates&quot; of Württemberg, that had to approve new taxation.

In 1477, Eberhard V founded the University of Tübingen and expelled the Jews. At Eberhard&#x27;s death in 1496, his cousin, Duke Eberhard II, succeeded for a short reign of two years, terminated by a deposition.
Eberhard V proved one of the most energetic rulers that Württemberg ever had, and, in 1495, his county became a duchy. Eberhard was now Duke Eberhard I of Württemberg. Württemberg, after the partition from 1442 to 1482, had no further land partitions to endure and remained a relatively closed country.

== Reformation period ==


Martin Luther&#x27;s theses and his writings left no one in Germany untouched after 1517. In 1503, the family Baden-Sausenberg became extinct, and the whole of Baden was united by Christoph, who, before his death in 1527, divided it among his three sons. Religious differences increased the family&#x27;s rivalry. During the period of the Reformation some of the rulers of Baden remained Catholic and some became Protestants. One of Christoph&#x27;s sons died childless in 1533. In 1535, his remaining sons Bernard and Ernest, having shared their brother&#x27;s territories, made a fresh division and founded the lines of Baden-Baden and Baden-Pforzheim, called Baden-Durlach after 1565. Further divisions followed, and the weakness caused by these partitions was accentuated by a rivalry between the two main branches of the family, culminating in open warfare.

The long reign (1498–1550) of Duke Ulrich, who succeeded to the duchy while still a child, proved a most eventful period for the country, and many traditions cluster round the name of this gifted, unscrupulous and ambitious man. Duke Ulrich of Württemberg had been living in his County of Mömpelgard since 1519. He had been exiled from his duchy by his own fault and controversial encroachments into non-Württembergish possessions. In Basel, Duke Ulrich came into contact with the Reformation.

Aided by Philip, landgrave of Hesse, and other Protestant princes, he fought a victorious battle against Ferdinand&#x27;s troops at Lauffen in May 1534. Then, by the treaty of Cadan, he again became duke, but perforce duke of the duchy as an Austrian fief. He subsequently introduced the reformed religious doctrines, endowed Protestant churches and schools throughout his land, and founded the Tübinger Stift seminary in 1536. Ulrich&#x27;s connection with the Schmalkaldic League led to another expulsion but, in 1547, Charles V reinstated him, albeit on somewhat onerous terms.

The total population during the 16th century was between 300,000 and 400,000. Ulrich&#x27;s son and successor, Christoph (1515–1568), completed the work of converting his subjects to the reformed faith. He introduced a system of church government, the Grosse Kirchenordnung, which endured in part into the 20th century. In this reign, a standing commission started to superintend the finances, and the members of this body, all of whom belonged to the upper classes, gained considerable power in the state, mainly at the expense of the towns, by means of the Oberamture and later, in addition, the Landkreis.

Christopher&#x27;s son Louis, the founder of the Collegium illustre in Tübingen, died childless in 1593. A kinsman, Frederick I (1557–1608) succeeded to the duchy. This energetic prince disregarded the limits placed on his authority by the rudimentary constitution. By paying a large sum of money, he induced the emperor Rudolph II in 1599 to free the duchy from the suzerainty of Austria. Austria still controlled large areas around the duchy, known as &quot;Further Austria&quot;. Thus, once again, Württemberg became a direct fief of the empire, securing its independence. Even the Margraviate of Baden-Baden went over to Lutheranism that same year, but indeed only for a short time. Likewise, after the Peace of Augsburg the Reformation was carried out in the County of Hohenlohe. At the same time, however, the Counter-Reformation began. It was persistently supported by the Emperor and the clerical princes.

== Peasants&#x27; War ==
The living conditions of the peasants in the German southwest at the beginning of the 16th century were quite modest, but an increase in taxes and several bad harvests, with no improvement in sight, led to crisis. Under the sign of the sandal (&quot;Bundschuh&quot;), that is, the farmer&#x27;s shoe that tied up with laces, rebellions broke out on the Upper Rhine, in the Bishopric of Speyer, in the Black Forest and in the upper Neckar valley at the end of the 15th century. The extortions by which he sought to raise money for his extravagant pleasures excited an uprising known as the &quot;arme Konrad&quot; (Poor Conrad), not unlike the rebellion in England led by Wat Tyler. The authorities soon restored order, and, in 1514, by the Treaty of Tübingen, the people undertook to pay the duke&#x27;s debts in return for various political privileges, which in effect laid the foundation of the constitutional liberties of the country. A few years later, Ulrich quarrelled with the Swabian League, and its forces (helped by Duke William IV of Bavaria, angered by the treatment meted out by Ulrich to his wife Sabina, a Bavarian princess), invaded Württemberg, expelled the duke and sold his duchy to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, for 220,000 gulden.

Charles handed Württemberg over to his brother, the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I, who served as nominal ruler for a few years. Soon, however, the discontent caused by the oppressive Austrian rule, the disturbances in Germany leading to the German Peasants&#x27; War and the commotions aroused by the Reformation gave Ulrich an opportunity to recover his duchy. Thus Marx Sittich of Hohenems went against the Hegenau and Klettgau rebels. On 4 November 1525 he struck down a last attempt by the peasants in that same countryside where the peasants&#x27; unrest had begun a year before. Emperor Karl V and even Pope Clement VII thanked the Swabian Union for its restraint in the Peasants&#x27; War.

== Thirty Years&#x27; War ==


The longest war in German history became, with the intervention of major powers, a global war. The cause was mainly the conflict of religious denominations as a result of the Reformation. Thus, in the southwest of the empire, Catholic and Protestant princes faced one another as enemies—the Catholics (Emperor, Bavaria) united in the League, and the Protestants (Electorate Palatine, Baden-Durlach, Württemberg) in the Union. Unlike his predecessor, the next duke, Johann Frederick (1582–1628), failed to become an absolute ruler, and perforce recognised the checks on his power. During his reign, which ended in July 1628, Württemberg suffered severely from the Thirty Years&#x27; War although the duke himself took no part in it. His son and successor Eberhard III (1628–1674), however, plunged into it as an ally of France and Sweden as soon as he came of age in 1633, but after the battle of Nordlingen in 1634, Imperial troops occupied the duchy and the duke himself went into exile for some years. The Peace of Westphalia restored him, but to a depopulated and impoverished country, and he spent his remaining years in efforts to repair the disasters of the lengthy war. Württemberg was a central battlefield of the war. Its population fell by 57% between 1634 and 1655, primarily because of death and disease, declining birthrates, and the mass migration of terrified peasants.

From 1584 to 1622, Baden-Baden was in the possession of one of the princes of Baden-Durlach. The house was similarly divided during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Baden suffered severely during this struggle, and both branches of the family were exiled in turn. The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 restored the status quo, and the family rivalry gradually died out. For one part of the southwest, a peace of 150 years began. On the Middle Neckar, in the whole Upper Rhine area and especially in the Electorate Palatine, the wars waged by the French King Louis XIV from 1674 to 1714 caused further terrible destruction. The Kingdom of France penetrated through acquired possessions in Alsace to the Rhine border. Switzerland separated from the Holy Roman Empire.

== Swabian Circle until the French Revolution ==




The duchy survived mainly because it was larger than its immediate neighbours. However, it was often under pressure during the Reformation from the Catholic Holy Roman Empire, and from repeated French invasions in the 17th and 18th centuries. Württemberg happened to be in the path of French and Austrian armies engaged in the long rivalry between the Bourbon and Habsburg dynasties.

During the wars of the reign of Louis XIV of France, the margravate was ravaged by French troops and the towns of Pforzheim, Durlach, and Baden were destroyed. Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden (died 1707), figured prominently among the soldiers who resisted the aggressions of France.

It was the life&#x27;s work of Charles Frederick of Baden-Durlach to give territorial unity to his country. Beginning his reign in 1738, and coming of age in 1746, this prince is the most notable of the rulers of Baden. He was interested in the development of agriculture and commerce, sought to improve education and the administration of justice, and proved in general to be a wise and liberal ruler in the Age of Enlightenment.

In 1771, Augustus George of Baden-Baden died without sons, and his territories passed to Charles Frederick, who thus finally became ruler of the whole of Baden. Although Baden was united under a single ruler, the territory was not united in its customs and tolls, tax structure, laws or government. Baden did not form a compact territory. Rather, a number of separate districts lay on both banks of the upper Rhine. His opportunity for territorial aggrandisement came during the Napoleonic wars.

During the reign of Eberhard Louis (1676–1733), who succeeded as a one-year-old when his father Duke William Louis died in 1677, Württemberg had to face another destructive enemy, Louis XIV of France. In 1688, 1703 and 1707, the French entered the duchy and inflicted brutalities and suffering upon the inhabitants. The sparsely populated country afforded a welcome to fugitive Waldenses, who did something to restore it to prosperity, but the extravagance of the duke, anxious to provide for the expensive tastes of his mistress, Christiana Wilhelmina von Grävenitz, undermined this benefit.

In 1704, Eberhard Ludwig started to build Ludwigsburg Palace to the north of Stuttgart, in imitation of Versailles.

Charles Alexander, who became duke in 1733, had become a Roman Catholic while an officer in the Austrian service. His favourite adviser was the Jew Joseph Süß Oppenheimer, and suspicions arose that master and servant were aiming at the suppression of the diet (the local parliament) and the introduction of Roman Catholicism. However, the sudden death of Charles Alexander in March 1737 put an abrupt end to any such plans, and the regent, Duke Carl Rudolf of Württemberg-Neuenstadt, had Oppenheimer hanged.

Charles Eugene (1728–1793), who came of age in 1744, appeared gifted, but proved to be vicious and extravagant, and he soon fell into the hands of unworthy favourites. He spent a great deal of money in building the &quot;New Castle&quot; in Stuttgart and elsewhere, and sided against Prussia during the Seven Years&#x27; War of 1756–1763, which was unpopular with his Protestant subjects. His whole reign featured dissension between ruler and ruled, the duke&#x27;s irregular and arbitrary methods of raising money arousing great discontent. The intervention of the emperor and even of foreign powers ensued and, in 1770, a formal arrangement removed some of the grievances of the people. Charles Eugene did not keep his promises, but later, in his old age, he made a few further concessions.

Charles Eugene left no legitimate heirs, and was succeeded by his brother, Louis Eugene (died 1795), who was childless, and then by another brother, Frederick Eugene (died 1797). This latter prince, who had served in the army of Frederick the Great, to whom he was related by marriage, and then managed his family&#x27;s estates around Montbéliard, educated his children in the Protestant faith as francophones. All of the subsequent Württemberg royal family were descended from him. Thus, when his son Frederick II became duke in 1797, Protestantism returned to the ducal household, and the royal house adhered to this faith thereafter. Nevertheless, the district legislatures as well as the imperial diets offered a possibility of regulating matters in dispute. Much was left over from the trials before the imperial courts, which often lasted decades.

== Southwest Germany up to 1918 ==


In the wars after the French Revolution in 1789, Napoleon, the emperor of the French, rose to be the ruler of the European continent. An enduring result of his policy was a new order of the southwestern German political world. When the French Revolution threatened to be exported throughout Europe in 1792, Baden joined forces against France. Its countryside was devastated in the ensuing battles. In 1796, the margrave was compelled to pay an indemnity and to cede his territories on the left bank of the Rhine to France. Fortune, however, soon returned to his side.

In 1803, largely owing to the good offices of Alexander I, emperor of Russia, the margrave received the Bishopric of Konstanz, part of the Rhenish Palatinate, and other smaller districts, together with the dignity of a prince-elector. Changing sides in 1805, he fought for Napoleon, with the result that, by the peace of Pressburg in that year, he obtained the Breisgau and other territories at the expense of the Habsburgs (see Further Austria). In 1806, the Baden margrave joined the Confederation of the Rhine, declared himself a sovereign prince, became a grand duke, and received additional territory.

On 1 January 1806, Duke Frederick II assumed the title of King Frederick I, abrogated the constitution, and united old and new Württemberg. Subsequently, he placed church lands under the control of the state and received some formerly self-governing areas under the &quot;mediatisation&quot; process. In 1806, he joined the Confederation of the Rhine and received further additions of territory containing 160,000 inhabitants. A little later, by the peace of Vienna in October 1809, about 110,000 more persons came under his rule.

In return for these favors, Frederick joined Napoleon Bonaparte in his campaigns against Prussia, Austria and Russia. Some 16,000 of his subjects marched as soldiers with the French invasion of Russia to take Moscow; only a few hundred survived to return. After the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813, King Frederick deserted the waning fortunes of the French emperor. By a treaty made with Metternich at Fulda in November 1813, he secured the confirmation of his royal title and of his recent acquisitions of territory. He directed his forces to fight with allies in their attack on France.

In 1815, the king joined the German Confederation, but the Congress of Vienna made no change in the extent of his lands. In the same year, he proposed a new constitution to the representatives of his people, but they rejected it. In the midst of this controversy, Frederick died on 30 October 1816.

The new king, William I (reigned 1816–1864), at once took up the constitutional question and, after much discussion, granted a new constitution in September 1819. This constitution, with subsequent modifications, remained in force until 1918 (see Württemberg). A period of quiet was established. The condition of the kingdom, its education, agriculture trade and manufactures, began to receive earnest attention. King William I helped to repair the shattered finances of the country. But the people&#x27;s desire for greater political freedom did not fade away under the 1819 constitution. After 1830, a certain amount of unrest occurred. This, however, soon died. The inclusion of Württemberg in the German Zollverein and the construction of railways fostered trade.

The revolutionary movement of 1848 did not leave Württemberg untouched, although no associated violence took place within the kingdom. King William had to dismiss Johannes Schlayer (1792–1860) and his other ministers, calling to power men with more liberal ideas and the exponents of the idea of a united Germany. King William did proclaim a democratic constitution but, as soon as the movement had spent its force, he dismissed the liberal ministers. In October 1849, Schlayer and his associates returned to power. In Baden, by contrast, there was a serious uprising that had to be put down by force.

By interfering with popular electoral rights, the king and his ministers succeeded in assembling a servile &quot;diet&quot; in 1851, which surrendered all the privileges gained since 1848. In this way, the authorities restored the constitution of 1819, and power passed into the hands of a bureaucracy. A concordat with the Papacy proved almost the last act of William&#x27;s long reign. But the &quot;diet&quot; repudiated the agreement, preferring to regulate relations between church and state in its own way.

In July 1864, Charles (1823–1891, reigned 1864–91) succeeded his father William I as king. Almost at once, he was faced with considerable difficulties. In the duel between Austria and Prussia for supremacy in Germany, William I had consistently taken the Austrian side. The new king and his advisers continued this policy.

In 1866, Württemberg took up arms on behalf of Austria in the Austro-Prussian War, but three weeks after the Battle of Königgrätz on 3 July 1866, her troops suffered a comprehensive defeat at Tauberbischofsheim, and the country lay at the mercy of Prussia. The Prussians occupied the northern part of Württemberg and negotiated a peace in August 1866. By this, Württemberg paid an indemnity of 8,000,000 gulden, but she at once concluded a secret offensive and defensive treaty with her conqueror. Württemberg was a party to the Saint Petersburg Declaration of 1868.

The end of the struggle against Prussia allowed a renewal of democratic agitation in Württemberg. This had not achieved any changes before the great war between France and Prussia broke out in 1870. Although the policy of Württemberg had continued to be antagonistic to Prussia, the kingdom shared in the national enthusiasm that swept over Germany, and its troops took a creditable part in the Battle of Wörth and in other operations of the war.

In 1871, Württemberg became a member of the new German Empire, but retained control of her own post office, telegraphs and railways. She had also certain special privileges with regard to taxation and the army and, for the next 10 years, Württemberg&#x27;s policy enthusiastically supported the new order. Many important reforms, especially in the area of finance, ensued, but a proposal for a union of the railway system with that of the rest of Germany failed. After reductions in taxation in 1889, the reform of the constitution became the question of the hour. King Charles and his ministers wished to strengthen the conservative element in the chambers, but the laws of 1874, 1876 and 1879 only effected slight reforms pending a more thorough settlement. On 6 October 1891, King Charles died suddenly. His nephew, William II (1848–1921, reigned 1891–1918), succeeded and continued the policy of his predecessor.

Discussions on the reform of the constitution continued, and the election of 1895 memorably returned a powerful party of democrats. King William had no sons, nor had his only Protestant kinsman, Duke Nicholas (1833–1903). Consequently, the succession would ultimately pass to a Roman Catholic branch of the family, and this prospect raised certain difficulties about the relations between church and state. The heir to the throne in 1910 was the Roman Catholic Duke Albert (born 1865).

Between 1900 and 1910, the political history of Württemberg centred round the settlement of the constitutional and the educational questions. The constitution underwent revision in 1906, and a settlement of the education difficulty occurred in 1909. In 1904, the railway system integrated with that of the rest of Germany.

The population in 1905 was 2,302,179, of whom 69% were Protestant, 30% Catholic and 0.5% Jewish. Protestants largely preponderated in the Neckar district, and Roman Catholics in that of the Danube. In 1910, an estimated 506,061 people worked in the agricultural sector, 432,114 in industrial occupations and 100,109 in trade and commerce. (see Demographics of Württemberg)

In the confusion at the end of World War I, Frederick abdicated on 22 November 1918. A republic had already been declared on 14 November. Württemberg became a state (&quot;Land&quot;) in the new Weimar Republic. Baden named itself a &quot;democratic republic,&quot; Württemberg a &quot;free popular state.&quot; Instead of monarchs, state presidents were in charge. They were elected by the state legislatures, in Baden by an annual change, in Württemberg after each legislative election.

Politics between 1918 and 1919 towards a merger of Württemberg and Baden remained largely unsuccessful. After the excitements of the 1918–1919 revolution, its five election results between 1919 and 1932 show a decreasing vote for left-wing parties.

In the &quot;Reichstag&quot; election of 5 March 1933, about 86% of the people of Württemberg voted in the election with the Nazis winning 42% of their vote, up from the 26% of the vote that they had won in the last election of November 1932. On 8 March 1933, Adolf Hitler used his powers under the Reichstag fire degree&#x27; to appoint the local SA leader Dietrich von Jagow as the police commissioner for Württemberg. Jagow started what was called a &quot;reign of terror&quot; as he ruthlessly employed the SA and the police against Jews, Social Democrats and Communists. Jagow founded a concentration camp at Heuberg that held 1,902 people at its opening in March 1933 with the number rising to 15,000 by the time it was shut down in December 1933. The Württemberg Nazis were torn by a feud between the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; Wilhelm Murr and his archenemy the Minister President Christian Mergenthaler, and throughout the Nazi era, the local NSDAP was highly dysfunctional as Murr and Mergenthaler battled each other for control. After the seizure of power by the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP) in the year 1933, the state borders initially remained unchanged. The state of Baden, the state of Württemberg and the Hohenzollern states (the government district of Sigmaringen) continued to exist, albeit with much less autonomy with regard to the &quot;Reich&quot;. From 1934, the Gau of Württemberg-Hohenzollern added the Province of Hohenzollern.

Though the Jewish population of Württemberg was small, Jewish traders played a significant role in linking the rural markets to the urban ones, and most farmers in Württemberg disapproved of the efforts of the Nazi regime to put the Jewish traders out of business, albeit only for self-interested reasons. The majority of the Jews living in urban areas tended to secular and assimilated into German culture while the majority of the Jews living in rural areas tended to be Orthodox and to keep a &quot;certain reserve&quot; from their Gentile neighbors. By 1939, the majority of the Jews who had lived in Württemberg had moved abroad with only a quarter of the Jews who had been living in 1933 in Württemberg were still there by 1939. The primary destination of the Jews of Württemberg was the United States through a significant number also went to the United Kingdom, France, the Palestine Mandate (modern Israel) and Argentina. During the 1930s it was difficult for women to obtain employment, and as such, it was more common for Jewish women to stay in Württemberg as they feared that they would be unable to find a job if they went abroad. Besides the sexual divide, older Jews were more likely to choose to stay in Württemberg than younger Jews.

Starting in January 1939, the Nazi regime launched the Action T4 program to kill all Germans with physically disabilities and/or learning disabilities in order to cleanse the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; (&quot;people&#x27;s community&quot;) of all &quot;useless eaters&quot; (so-called because they consumed food that according to the regime should have gone to the healthy members of the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;). In October 1939, the Action T4 program arrived in Württemberg when the Schloss Grafeneck, a home for &quot;cripples&quot; outside of Stuttgart started to be converted into a killing center with its gas chambers and crematorium. Opening in its new role as a killing center for &quot;life unworthy of life&quot; in January 1940, by December of that year, 10,654 people were killed at the Schloss Grafeneck, of which 3,884 were from Württemberg, 4,451 were from Baden and 1,864 were from Bavaria. The first 13 people killed in January 1940 were all people suffering from epilepsy with the official story that they had been killed by a highly virulent strain of the flu, which required that their bodies be burned immediately. People living near the Schloss Grafeneck complained constantly about the smell of burned human flesh being in the air.

Doctors who were assigned the role of &quot;racial engineers&quot; were overrepresented in the NSDAP. In Württemberg, 36% of all doctors were NSDAP members, and the majority willingly went along with the effort to kill their &quot;worthless&quot; patients, arranging for those with physical and/or intellectual disabilities to be sent to the Schloss Grafeneck. Typical of those classified by their doctors as an &quot;useless eater&quot; was a farmer who had been injured in a work accident in 1929 and had been living on disability ever since; in May 1940, his doctor classified him as an &quot;useless eater&quot;, causing him to go Schloss Grafeneck, where he was gassed. Otto Küstner, the president of the Württemberg supreme court had a brother who was living in a mental asylum. Through Küstner was a loyal supporter of the regime, twice he took his brother home to prevent him from going to Schloss Grafeneck while denying to other people with relatives at the same asylum that people were being killed at Schloss Grafeneck. Those selected to die at Schloss Grafeneck were always taken in buses painted in a very distinctive shade of grey. Through the Nazi regime mocked people living in asylums as &quot;life unworthy of life&quot; who were too incompetent to understand what was happening around them, in many cases people had to be dragged kicking and screaming from the asylums into the grey buses that were to take them to Schloss Grafeneck. Other people taken from the asylums broke down in tears as they boarded the buses, knowing that they would die at the Schloss Grafeneck. Farmers living around Schloss Grafeneck noted the correlation between the arrival of the grey buses, which was followed up shortly afterwards by the smell of burned human flesh coming from the crematorium, leading to the conclusion that people could not possibly be dying of the flu that swiftly all the time.

Württemberg&#x27;s location in southwestern Germany provided a considerable flying distance from Britain while its topography with its steep hills punctured by deep valleys provided additional defenses from bombing. For these reasons, the Bomber Command of the Royal Air Force only infrequently bombed Württemberg at first with the first bombing raid occurred in May 1940. Stuttgart was an important railroad junction and a center of industry, making it into a prime bombing target. Stuttgart was first bombed on 25 August 1940 with raid causing the deaths of 4 people. Besides for Stuttgart, the cities that were most bombed in Württemberg were Friedrichshafen, Heilbronn, and Ulm.

On 8 July 1940, the parents of a young man suffering from schizophrenia who had been gassed wrote to the &quot;Reich&quot; Justice Minister Franz Gürtner to say their son had been &quot;murdered&quot;, saying they had &quot;absolutely reliable information&quot; that all of the patients at Grafeneck were being killed, going on to ask that Gürtner prosecute those responsible. In October 1940, the Stuttgart public prosecutor wrote to Gürtner say the &quot;rumors of mass murder are spreading like wildfire&quot; and that many people were afraid to take elderly relatives to hospitals out of the fear that they might go to Grafeneck. In some areas of Württemberg, the Action T4 program caused much shock, and in a form of passive resistance, many ordinary people banded together to find jobs for the &quot;useless eaters&quot; and thereby prove them to be &quot;useful&quot; to the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;. Despite the horror caused by the Action T4 program, most people in Württemberg did not blame Hitler, believing that he was unaware of what was happening and would stop it if he knew. In December 1940, the Schloss Grafeneck was shut down as the majority of the people classified as &quot;useless eaters&quot; in Württemberg were now dead.

In World War Two, the demographics of Württemberg changed as hundreds of thousands of men were called up for service in the Wehrmacht while hundreds of thousands of Poles and French were brought to Württemberg to do both industrial and agricultural work as slaves in everything but name. Before 1943, the Nazi regime was most reluctant to have German women engaged in war production, and instead brought in foreigners to replace the men serving in the Wehrmacht. Hitler believed that having women work in factories would damage their wombs, and thereby prevent them from bearing the next generation of the &quot;Herrnvolk&quot;, making him very much against having women being work in war production. Adding to the difficulties of the farming households was that the Wehrmacht had taken thousands of horses for its quartermasters. By October 1940, there were 17,500 Poles working on the farms of Württemberg, and the number of Poles was to increase as the war went on and the Nazi regime was forced to conscript more and more farmers to replace the Wehrmacht&#x27;s losses. The rules governing the Poles in Württemberg stated that they were to observe a curfew between 9 pm-5 am in summertime and between 8:00 pm-6 am in the wintertime; could only use public transportation with a special permit granted by the police; were banned from eating in restaurants and using telephones; were forbidden to own radios, bicycles, and cameras; and those permitted to use public transportation were forbidden to use the seats in buses and trams. Through the rules stated the Poles were to attend separate church services from the Germans, in practice several Catholic priests in the countryside ignored this rule and allowed the Poles to attend Mass alongside the Germans, much to the displeasure of the Nazi regime.

Starting in the summer of 1941 the ranks of the slaves were vastly increased by Soviet POWs, though the tendency of the Nazi regime to allow them to starve to death led to the deaths of almost all of the Red Army POWs by the end of 1941. Only in December 1941, when it became clear that the Soviet Union would not be defeated in 1941 as expected, were proper rations provided to the Red Army POWs as their labor was now needed to maintain German war production. By 1942, the language of the majority of the workers at the Daimler-Benz factory in Stuttgart was Russian. The Daimler-Benz executives argued that providing the Soviet POWs with only &quot;starvation rations&quot; was bad for the productivity of the factory as the POWs tended to quite literally drop dead on the factory floor. On 1 December 1941, the first deportation of Jews from Württemberg took place when about 1,000 Jews were rounded up, loaded onto a train in Stuttgart that took all the way to Riga, where all of the Jews were shot upon arrival. There were to be 11 more deportations via trains that took the local Jews to be exterminated in Latvia. Of the 2,500 Jews who were deported from Württemberg, only 180 survived. By the time the French and the Americans occupied Württemberg in April 1945, there were only 200 Jews living in all of Württemberg.

The Nazis mocked the Poles, most of whom came from the countryside, for their &quot;primitive levels of hygiene&quot; and expected all Germans to do likewise. However, the regime was apparently not aware that the level of hygiene on farms in Württemberg was about the same as on Polish farms. The majority of the Württemberg farms lacked electricity and running water and it was common for families of farmers to share their homes with their farm animals, which were precisely the same conditions that existed on Polish farms. Many of the families of farmers in Württemberg did not have the same level of contempt for the Poles that Germans from an urban background had, and the rules forbidding friendships between Germans and Poles were often ignored. Furthermore, in marked contrast to the attitudes towards Jews, many Catholic farmers saw the Polish workers as merely fellow Catholics who came from a similar background as themselves who just happened to speak another language. However, the historian Jill Stephenson noted that how well a German family treated their Polish workers often depended on the degree that the labor was needed with farmers who needed Polish labor the most tending to treat them the best. In households headed by women, almost invariably the farmwife would take one or more of her Polish laborers as her lover.

As there was a shortage of German men in the countryside due to so many men serving in the Wehrmacht, sexual relationships between Polish men and German women were very common, to the intense fury of the Nazi regime which tried very hard to stamp out such relationships. The Nazi &quot;Kreisleiter&quot; of Esslingen am Neckar, Eugen Hund, later stated that he was so harsh with German women who had foreign lovers because: &quot;Females, I would not call them women, who in 1940 in a time of war, turned a battling and struggling Fatherland into a whorehouse, had to be treated like whores&quot;. The State Prosecutor of Württemberg noted in 1940 that the overwhelming majority of German women found guilty of &quot;racial defilement&quot; were &quot;farm maids, farmer&#x27;s wives, farmer&#x27;s daughters, and women from the rural middle class&quot;. Unlike the workers in urban areas who were kept segregated from the rest of German society, in the countryside, Polish and other foreign laborers lived alongside the Germans. The close proximity allowed for more closer relationships. One Nazi district leader in a rural area of Württemberg complained in 1944: &quot;Does it not make a mockery of our &quot;Weltanschauung&quot; if I enter a German peasant home and there in a German pram lies the child of a Russian woman, sired by a Frenchman and cared for by German women?&quot;

The first public pillorying of German women in Württemberg for &quot;racial defilement&quot; took place in September 1940 with 12 women being put on display to be mocked and humiliated. Three of the women had French lovers, and claimed that they believed it was only illegal to have sex with Poles, an explanation that was not accepted by the Württemberg State prosecutor. In July 1941, six Polish men who had slept with German women were publicly hanged in various villages in Württemberg as a warning against &quot;racial defilement&quot;. The State Prosecutor approvingly reported that such executions were having an effect, through Stephenson wrote the actual effect of the executions was merely to inspire Polish and French men in relationships with German women to be more &quot;discreet&quot;. There were many complaints in the Württemberg countryside about the sexual double standard of the Nazi regime as German men who had relationships with foreign women were generally given a warning while foreign men who had relationships with German women, especially if they were from Eastern Europe, were executed. German women found guilty of &quot;racial defilement&quot; were publicly humiliated with their heads being shaven by members of the local SA and NSDAP members and being forced to wear signs reading &quot;I went with a Pole and polluted German blood&quot;. Afterwards, the women were sent to the concentration camp at Ravensbruck. Such rituals of public humiliation was deeply unpopular with the local people who found such rituals &quot;repellent&quot;. By contrast, in 1943 when three members of the Hitler Youth, all under the age of 18, together with another young German man who was about 20 were found to be having sex with a group of Frenchwomen working in Stuttgart; the Stuttgart public prosecutor had the three Hitler Youth charged under the Youth Protection Order, but the young man escaped charges as the prosecutor stated &quot;because there is no penalty for having sex with foreign women workers, even if they belong to enemy states and it constitutes a major national disgrace&quot;. Even with the Hitler Youth charged under the Youth Protection Order, the public prosecutor saw them more as victims, charging that most of the Frenchwomen working in Germany for the &quot;Service du travail obligatoire&quot; were &quot;big city prostitutes&quot; who were corrupting innocent Hitler Youth into lives of debauchery, leading him to seek lenient sentences.

On the night 5 May 1942, Stuttgart was bombed for the fourth time, a raid that killed 13 people, which marked the first time since 1940 that any air raid had killed anyone in Stuttgart. Later on in May–June 1942, Bomber Command tried hard to destroy the Bosch factory in Stuttgart where generators were manufactured, but the raids were unsuccessful. An attempt to destroy the SKF factory that made ball-bearings in Stuttgart in September 1943 by Bomber Command was equally unsuccessful at a high cost. Daimler-Benz chose to spread out its production around the Stuttgart area, which proved successful, through the dispersal slowed down its production of aircraft engines and cylinders, valve and camshafts for military vehicles. From April 1943 onward, Bomber Command started to regularly bomb the cities and towns of Württemberg on a nightly basis, causing much damage. On the night of 27 April 1943, Bomber Command launched an especially heavy raid on the town of Friedrichshafen in an attempt to destroy the three factories that made tank engines in that town. On 6 September 1943, Stuttgart was bombed in the daylight for the first time when the United States Army Air Force bombed the city in a raid that left 107 people dead in Stuttgart. On April 27–28, 1944, Friedrichshafen was again heavily bombed in a series of Anglo-American air raids with the raids destroying 40% of all the buildings in Friedrichshafen.

The heaviest bombing raids yet occurred between 25 and 30 July 1944 when Bomber Command struck at Stuttgart in a series of nightly raids that destroyed all of downtown Stuttgart while killing about 1,000 people and leaving another 100,000 people homeless. On 27 July 1944, Friedrichshafen was again heavily bombed by the RAF in an attempt to destroy the factory that made jet engines. Stuttgart was again struck hard in a series of Anglo-American bombing raids in September–October 1944 aimed at destroying the railroad system, but which also seriously damaged the water and sewage systems. The heaviest bombing raids occurred on 19–20 October 1944, which left 338 people dead while wounding 872. By this point, the Lord Mayor, Dr. Karl Strölin had asked all non-essential people leave Stuttgart. By the fall of 1944 Daimler-Benz had been forced to move its Stuttgart factories underground to keep them functioning. In September 1944, Heilbronn was being bombed on such a regular basis that the local Nazi &quot;kreislater&quot;, Richard Drauz, the mayor and the police chief all asked Murr for permission to move the non-essential people out of Heilbronn, permission that was denied by Murr who insisted that it would depress morale. On 4 December 1944, Heilbronn was badly damaged in an air raid that saw about 6,000 people killed while the entire downtown of the city turned into a ruin. Ulm was badly damaged in an air raid on 17 December 1944. The only city in Württemberg that escaped major damage was the university city of Tübingen, which had no industry to bomb.

In October 1944, American and French forces entered Baden, to be followed shortly by Württemberg. Many of the &quot;French&quot; soldiers fighting in Württemberg were actually Algerians and Moroccans, both of whom were greatly feared by Germans. The soldiers from the Maghreb were believed to be especially prone to rape. In the village of Mössingen, Moroccan soldiers were said to have raped 220 women after taking the village while the Moroccans were said to raped 200 women in the village of Ditzigen. The Americans took Stuttgart on Easter Sunday 1945. By 30 April 1945, all of Baden, Württemberg and Hohenzollern were completely occupied by American and French forces.

== Southwest Germany after the war ==
After World War II was over, the states of Baden and Württemberg were split between the American occupation zone in the north and the French occupation zone in the south, which also got Hohenzollern. The border between the occupation zones followed the district borders, but they were drawn purposely in such a way that the autobahn from Karlsruhe to Munich (today the Bundesautobahn 8) ended up inside the American occupation zone. In the American occupation zone, the state of Württemberg-Baden was founded; in the French occupation zone, the southern part of former Baden became the new state of Baden while the southern part of Württemberg and Hohenzollern were fused into Württemberg-Hohenzollern.

Article 29 of the Basic Law of Germany provided for a way to change the German states via a community vote; however, it could not enter into force due to a veto by the Allied forces. Instead, a separate article 118 mandated the fusion of the three states in the southwest via a trilateral agreement. If the three affected states failed to agree, federal law would have to regulate the future of the three states. This article was based on the results of a conference of the German states held in 1948, where the creation of a Southwest State was agreed upon. The alternative, generally favored in South Baden, was to recreate Baden and Württemberg (including Hohenzollern) in its old, pre-war borders.

The trilateral agreement failed because the states couldn&#x27;t agree on the voting system. As such, federal law decided on 4 May 1951 that the area be split into four electoral districts: North Württemberg, South Württemberg, North Baden and South Baden. Because it was clear that both districts in Württemberg as well as North Baden would support the merger, the voting system favored the supporters of the new Southwest State. The state of Baden brought the law to the German Constitutional Court to have it declared as unconstitutional, but failed.

The plebiscite took place on 9 December 1951. In both parts of Württemberg, 93% were in favor of the merger, in North Baden 57% were in favor, but in South Baden only 38% were. Because three of four electoral districts voted in favor of the new Southwest State, the merger was decided upon. Had Baden as a whole formed a single electoral district, the vote would have failed.

== State of Baden-Württemberg from 1952 to the present ==
The members of the constitutional convention were elected on 9 March 1952, and on 25 April the Prime Minister was elected. With this, the new state of Baden-Württemberg was founded. After the constitution of the new state entered force, the members of the constitutional convention formed the state parliament until the first election in 1956. The name &quot;Baden-Württemberg&quot; was only intended as a temporary name, but ended up the official name of the state because no other name could be agreed upon.

In May 1954, the Baden-Württemberg &quot;Landtag&quot; (legislature) decided on adoption of the following coat of arms: three black lions on a golden shield, framed by a deer and a griffin. This coat of arms once belonged to the Staufen family, emperors of the Holy Roman Empire and Dukes of Swabia. The golden deer stands for Württemberg, the griffin for Baden. Conversely the former Württemberg counties of Calw, Freudenstadt, Horb, Rottweil and Tuttlingen were incorporated into the Baden governmental districts of Karlsruhe and Freiburg. The last traces of Hohenzollern disappeared. Between county and district, regional associations were formed that are responsible for overlapping planning.

The opponents of the merger did not give up. After the General Treaty gave Germany full sovereignty, the opponents applied for a community vote to restore Baden to its old borders by virtue of paragraph 2 of Article 29 of the Basic Law, which allowed a community vote in states which had been changed after the war without a community vote. The Federal Ministry of the Interior refused the application on the grounds that a community vote had already taken place. The opponents sued in front of the German Constitutional Court and won in 1956, with the court deciding that the plebiscite of 1951 had not been a community vote as defined by the law because the more populous state of Württemberg had had an unfair advantage over the less populous state of Baden. Because the court did not set a date for the community vote, the government simply did nothing. The opponents eventually sued again in 1969, which led to the decision that the vote had to take place before 30 June 1970. On 7 June, the majority voted against the proposal to restore the state of Baden.

<doc id="140927" wikidata="Q370932" url="?curid=140927" title="Larry Holmes">
<text>Larry Holmes (born November 3, 1949) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1973 to 2002 and was world heavyweight champion from 1978 until 1985. He is often considered to be one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time. He grew up in Easton, Pennsylvania, which led to his boxing nickname of &quot;the Easton Assassin&quot;.

Holmes&#x27;s left jab is often rated among the best in heavyweight boxing history. In addition to holding the WBC heavyweight title from 1978 to 1983, 
Holmes held the &quot;Ring&quot; magazine and lineal heavyweight titles from 1980 to 1985 and the inaugural IBF heavyweight title from 1983 to 1985.

Holmes won his first 48 professional bouts, including victories over Ken Norton (the man he defeated in 1978 for the WBC championship), Muhammad Ali, Earnie Shavers, Mike Weaver, Gerry Cooney, Tim Witherspoon, Carl Williams, and Marvis Frazier. Holmes fell one short of matching Rocky Marciano&#x27;s career record of 49–0 when he lost to Michael Spinks in a 1985 upset. Holmes retired after losing a rematch to Spinks the following year but made repeated comebacks. He was unsuccessful in four further comeback attempts (against Mike Tyson in 1988, Evander Holyfield in 1992, Oliver McCall in 1995 and Brian Nielsen in 1997) to regain a variation of the heavyweight title. Holmes fought for the final time in 2002, at age 52, against the 334lb Eric &quot;Butterbean&quot; Esch and ended his career with a record of 69 wins and 6 losses, with all of his losses coming in world title fights.

Holmes is frequently ranked as one of the greatest heavyweights of all time and has been inducted into both the International Boxing Hall of Fame and World Boxing Hall of Fame. He is the only boxer to have defeated Muhammad Ali by stoppage and the last living boxer to have defeated Ali.

==Early life==
Holmes was the fourth of twelve children born to John and Flossie Holmes. In 1954, the family moved to Easton, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania. Holmes&#x27; father went to Connecticut, where he visited the family every three weeks and worked as a gardener until his death in 1970. &quot;He didn&#x27;t forsake us&quot;, said Flossie Holmes. &quot;He just didn&#x27;t have anything to give.&quot; The family survived on welfare. To help support his family, Holmes dropped out of school when he was in the seventh grade and went to work at a car wash for $1 an hour. He later drove a dump truck and worked in a Lehigh Valley quarry.

==Amateur career==
Holmes began boxing at age 18. In his twenty-first bout, he boxed Nick Wells in the semifinals of the 1972 National Olympic Trials in Fort Worth, Texas. Wells, a southpaw known for unprecedently high knockout-to-win percentage for an amateur boxer, with a majority of knockouts coming in the first round, stopped Holmes in the first round. Nevertheless, Holmes was chosen by a selection committee of the National Olympic authorities to fight at the Olympic box-offs in West Point, New York, where he had a match-up versus Duane Bobick. Holmes was dropped in the first round with a right to the head. He got up and danced out of range, landing several stiff jabs in the process. Bobick mauled Holmes in the second round but could not corner him. The referee warned Holmes twice in the second round for holding. In the third, Bobick landed several good rights and started to corner Holmes, who continued to hold. Eventually, Holmes was disqualified for excessive holding.

==Professional career==
===Early years===
After compiling an amateur record of 19–3, Holmes turned professional on March 21, 1973, winning a four-round decision against Rodell Dupree. Early in his career he worked as a sparring partner for Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Earnie Shavers, and Jimmy Young. He was paid well and learned a lot. &quot;I was young, and I didn&#x27;t know much. But I was holding my own sparring those guys&quot;, Holmes said. &quot;I thought, &#x27;hey, these guys are the best, the champs. If I can hold my own now, what about later?&#x27;&quot;

Holmes first gained credibility as a contender when he upset the hard-punching Earnie Shavers in March 1978. Holmes won by a lopsided twelve-round unanimous decision, winning every round on two scorecards and all but one on the third. Holmes&#x27;s victory over Shavers set up a title shot between Holmes and WBC Heavyweight Champion Ken Norton in Las Vegas on June 9, 1978.

===Defeating Norton and winning WBC heavyweight championship===
Holmes met Ken Norton on June 9, 1978, for a tough, competitive fight. After fourteen rounds, each of the three judges scored the fight dead even at seven rounds each. Holmes rallied late in the fifteenth to win the round on two scorecards and take the WBC title by a split decision.

In his first two title defenses, Holmes easily knocked out Alfredo Evangelista and Ossie Ocasio. His third title defense was a tough one. On June 22, 1979, Holmes faced future WBA Heavyweight Champion Mike Weaver, who was lightly regarded going into the fight sporting an uninspiring 19–8 record. After ten tough rounds, Holmes dropped Weaver with a right uppercut late in round eleven. In the twelfth, Holmes immediately went on the attack, backing Weaver into the ropes and pounding him with powerful rights until the referee stepped in and stopped it. &quot;This man knocked the devil out of me&quot;, Holmes said. &quot;This man might not have had credit before tonight, but you&#x27;ll give it to him now.&quot;

Three months later, on September 28, 1979, Holmes had a rematch with Shavers, who got a title shot by knocking out Norton in one round. Holmes dominated the first six rounds, but in the seventh, Shavers sent Holmes down with a devastating overhand right. Holmes got up, survived the round, and went on to punish Shavers in the eleventh round and the referee stopped the fight.

His next three defenses were knockouts of Lorenzo Zanon, Leroy Jones, and Scott LeDoux.

===Defeating Ali===

On October 2, 1980, at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Holmes defended his title against Muhammad Ali, who was coming out of retirement in an attempt to become the first four-time world heavyweight champion. Holmes dominated the 38-year-old Ali, winning every round on all three judges&#x27; scorecards. At the end of the tenth round, Ali&#x27;s trainer stepped in to stop the fight as Holmes was inflicting major blows on Ali, handing Ali the only stoppage defeat of his career. After the win, Holmes received recognition as World Heavyweight Champion by &quot;The Ring&quot;.

Ali blamed his poor performance on thyroid medication which he had been taking, saying that it helped him lose weight (he weighed 217½, his lowest weight since he fought George Foreman in 1974), but it also left him drained for the fight.

Holmes seemed to show signs of sadness in punishing Ali so much during the fight. Tears appeared in Holmes&#x27;s eyes during a post-fight interview. When asked why he was crying, he said that he respected Ali &quot;a whole lot&quot; and &quot;he fought one of the baddest heavyweights in the world today, and you cannot take credit from him.&quot;

Holmes&#x27;s trainer Richie Giachetti called Holmes&#x27;s pummeling of Ali &quot;awful ... the worst sports event I ever had to cover.&quot; Actor Sylvester Stallone was ringside for the fight and said that it was like watching an autopsy on a man who is still alive. The Holmes fight is said to have contributed to Ali&#x27;s Parkinson&#x27;s syndrome.

===Defeating Berbick, Leon Spinks &amp; Snipes===

After eight consecutive knockouts, Holmes was forced to go the distance when he successfully defended his title against future WBC Heavyweight Champion Trevor Berbick on April 11, 1981. In his next fight, two months later, Holmes knocked out former Undisputed World Heavyweight Champion Leon Spinks in three rounds. On November 6, 1981, Holmes rose from a seventh-round knockdown, during which he staggered into the turnbuckle, to stop Renaldo Snipes in the eleventh.

===Defeating Cooney===

On June 11, 1982, Holmes defended his title against Gerry Cooney, the undefeated #1 contender and an Irish-American. The lead-up to the fight had many racial overtones, with promoter Don King and others hyping Cooney as the &quot;.&quot; Holmes said that if Cooney wasn&#x27;t white, he would not be getting the same purse as the champion (both boxers received $10 million for the bout). Although Cooney tried to deflect questions about race, members of his camp wore shirts that said &quot;Not the White Man, but the Right Man.&quot; In their fight previews, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; put Cooney on the cover, not Holmes. Boxing tradition dictates that the champion be introduced last, but the challenger, Cooney, was introduced last.

The bout was held in a 32,000-seat stadium erected in a Caesar&#x27;s Palace Parking lot, with millions more watching around the world. After an uneventful first round, Holmes dropped Cooney with a right in the second. Cooney came back well in the next two rounds, jarring Holmes with his powerful left hook. Holmes later said that Cooney &quot;hit me so damned hard, I felt it—boom—in my bones.&quot; Cooney was tiring by the ninth, a round in which he had two points deducted for low blows. In the tenth, they traded punches relentlessly. At the end of the round, the two nodded to each other in respect. Cooney lost another point because of low blows in the eleventh. By then, Holmes was landing with ease. In the thirteenth, a barrage of punches sent Cooney down. He got up, but his trainer, Victor Valle, stepped into the ring and stopped the fight.

After the fight, Holmes and Cooney became close friends.

===Trouble with the WBC===

Holmes&#x27;s next two fights were one-sided decision wins over Randall &quot;Tex&quot; Cobb and ex-European champion Lucien Rodriguez. On May 20, 1983, Holmes defended his title against Tim Witherspoon, the future WBC and WBA Heavyweight Champion. Witherspoon, a six to one underdog and with only 15 professional bouts to his name, surprised many by giving Holmes a difficult fight. After twelve rounds, Holmes retained the title by a disputed split decision.

On September 10, 1983, Holmes successfully defended the WBC title for the sixteenth time, knocking out Scott Frank in five rounds. Holmes then signed to fight Marvis Frazier, son of Joe Frazier, on November 25, 1983. The WBC refused to sanction the fight against the unranked Frazier. They ordered Holmes to fight Greg Page, the #1 contender, or be stripped of the title. Promoter Don King offered Holmes $2.55 million to fight Page, but the champion didn&#x27;t think that was enough. He was making $3.1 million to fight Frazier and felt he should get as much as $5 million to fight Page.

Holmes had an easy time with Frazier, knocking him out in the first round. The following month, Holmes relinquished the WBC championship.

===IBF heavyweight champion===
Despite his no longer being recognized by the WBC as champion, Holmes was still regarded as the lineal champion as well as being recognized as world champion by &quot;The Ring&quot;. On December 11, 1983, the newly formed International Boxing Federation extended recognition to Holmes, and he accepted.

As 1984 began, Holmes and Gerrie Coetzee, the WBA champion, were signed to unify the titles on June 15, 1984, at Caesars Palace. The fight was being promoted by JPD Inc., but it was canceled when Caesars Palace said the promoters failed to meet the financial conditions of the contract. Holmes was promised $13 million and Coetzee was promised $8 million. Even after cutting the purses dramatically, they still couldn&#x27;t come up with enough financial backing to stage the fight. Don King then planned to promote the fight, but Holmes lost a lawsuit filed by Virginia attorney Richard Hirschfeld, who said he had a contract with Holmes that gave him right of first refusal on a Holmes-Coetzee bout. Holmes then decided to move on and fight someone else.

On November 9, 1984, after a year out of the ring, Holmes made his first defense of the IBF title, stopping James &quot;Bonecrusher&quot; Smith on a cut in the twelfth round. In the first half of 1985, Holmes stopped David Bey in ten rounds for his 19th title defense. His next against Carl &quot;The Truth&quot; Williams was unexpectedly tough. The younger, quicker Williams was able to out-jab the aging champion, who was left with a badly swollen eye by the end of the bout. Holmes emerged with a close, and disputed, fifteen-round unanimous decision.

===Holmes vs. Michael Spinks 1 &amp; 2===
Holmes&#x27;s next fight had the potential to make boxing history. He agreed to terms to fight Michael Spinks, the undisputed champion at light heavyweight, for his twentieth world title defense September 21, 1985. A victory for Holmes would have tied Rocky Marciano&#x27;s mark of 49 consecutive wins without a loss. Spinks, meanwhile, was looking to join Bob Fitzsimmons as the only other boxer at the time to win titles at both light heavyweight and heavyweight. In addition, if he defeated Holmes, Spinks would become the first ever reigning light heavyweight champion to win the heavyweight title.

Before the fight Archie Moore, the long-time light heavyweight champion who unsuccessfully challenged for the heavyweight crown himself twice, predicted an easy win for Holmes: &quot;I&#x27;m afraid Larry will chew him up. Michael may be faster than Larry, but you can only go so fast.&quot; Despite the assessment, it indeed would be Spinks whose historical destiny would be fulfilled, as he defeated Holmes via unanimous decision to become the first reigning light heavyweight champion to win the heavyweight title. After the fight, a bitter Holmes said, &quot;Rocky Marciano couldn&#x27;t carry my jockstrap.&quot;

Holmes had a rematch with Spinks on April 19, 1986. Spinks retained the title with a disputed fifteen-round split decision. The judges scored the fight: Judge Joe Cortez 144–141 (Holmes), Judge Frank Brunette 141–144 (Spinks) and Judge Jerry Roth 142–144 (Spinks.) In a post-fight interview with HBO, Holmes said, &quot;the judges, the referees and promoters can kiss me where the sun don&#x27;t shine—and because we&#x27;re on HBO, that&#x27;s my big black behind.&quot;

On November 6, 1986, three days after his 37th birthday, Holmes announced his retirement.

===Comebacks===
 
On January 22, 1988, Holmes was lured out of retirement by a $2.8 million purse to challenge reigning Undisputed World Heavyweight Champion Mike Tyson. Tyson dropped Holmes in the fourth round with an overhand right. Holmes got up, but Tyson put him down two more times in the round, and the fight was stopped. It was the only time Holmes was knocked out in his career. After the fight, Holmes again retired.

Holmes returned to the ring in 1991 and became a much more active fighter, usually fighting on &quot;USA Tuesday Night Fights&quot; cards every few weeks against up and comers and journeymen. After five straight wins, he fought Ray Mercer, the undefeated 1988 Olympic Gold Medalist, on February 7, 1992. Holmes pulled off the upset and won by a 12-round unanimous decision. (Holmes later claimed that he fought Mercer in spite of having a detached retina.) The win got Holmes a shot at Evander Holyfield for the Undisputed World Heavyweight Championship. On June 19, 1992, Holyfield defeated Holmes by a twelve-round unanimous decision.

On April 8, 1995, he fought Oliver McCall for the WBC title. Holmes lost by a close 12-round unanimous decision. Two of the judges had him losing by one point, while the other judge had him losing by three points.

Holmes was back in the ring five months later, resuming the pace he had set since his comeback. However, he was growing tired of the sport and, after he fought and knocked out Anthony Willis in June 1996 on another USA boxing event, Holmes announced that unless he received a shot at the title, the fight against Willis was likely to be his last.

On January 24, 1997, Holmes got his last opportunity to fight for a heavyweight championship when he traveled to Copenhagen to fight undefeated International Boxing Organization champion Brian Nielsen. Nielsen won by a 12-round split decision to retain the title.

Holmes and George Foreman signed to fight on January 23, 1999, at the Astrodome in Houston. Foreman called off the fight several weeks before it was to take place because the promoter failed to meet the deadline for paying him the remaining $9 million of his $10 million purse. Foreman received a nonrefundable $1 million deposit, and Holmes got to keep a $400,000 down-payment of his $4 million purse.

Holmes&#x27;s next two fights were rematches with old foes. On June 18, 1999, he stopped &quot;Bonecrusher&quot; Smith in eight rounds, and on November 17, 2000, he stopped Mike Weaver in six.

Holmes&#x27;s final fight was on July 27, 2002, in Norfolk, Virginia, in which he defeated Eric &quot;Butterbean&quot; Esch in a 10-round unanimous decision.

==Post-boxing life==
Holmes invested the money he earned from boxing and settled in his hometown of Easton. When he retired from boxing, Holmes employed more than 200 people through his various business holdings. In 2008, he owned two restaurants and a nightclub, a training facility, an office complex, a snack food bar and slot machines. As of 2009, Holmes co-hosted a talk show entitled &quot;What The Heck Were They Thinking?&quot;

In 2014, Holmes sold his business complex in Easton to entrepreneur Gerald Gorman, CEO of mail.com.

In 2016, Holmes guest starred as himself in an episode of &quot;Mike Tyson Mysteries&quot;, titled &quot;Unsolved Situations&quot;.

==Honors==
Holmes was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2008.

==Personal life==
In 1979, Larry Holmes married Diane Robinson, with whom he has two children. He also has three daughters from two previous relationships.

As of 2019, Holmes is living in Palmer Township, Pennsylvania, near Easton.

Holmes&#x27;s younger brother, Mark Holmes, was a middleweight boxer from 1980 to 1987.

<doc id="140929" wikidata="Q1287651" url="?curid=140929" title="Jack Webb">
<text>John Randolph Webb (April 2, 1920 – December 23, 1982) was an American actor, television producer, director, and screenwriter, most famous for his role as Joe Friday in the &quot;Dragnet&quot; franchise, which he created. He was also the founder of his own production company, Mark VII Limited.

Webb started his career in the 1940s as a radio personality, starring in several radio shows and dramas—including &quot;Dragnet&quot;, which he created in 1949—before entering television in the 1950s, creating the television adaptation of &quot;Dragnet&quot; for NBC as well as other series. Throughout the 1960s, Webb worked in both acting and television production, creating &quot;Adam-12&quot; in 1968, and in 1970, Webb retired from acting to focus on producing, creating &quot;Emergency!&quot; in 1972. Webb continued to make television series, and although many of them were less successful and short-lived, he wished to rekindle his prior successes, and had plans to return to acting in a &quot;Dragnet&quot; revival before he died.

Webb&#x27;s production style aimed for significant levels of detail and accuracy. Many of his works focused on law enforcement and emergency services in the Los Angeles area, most prominently the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), which directly supported the production of &quot;Dragnet&quot; and &quot;Adam-12&quot;.

==Early life==
Webb was born in Santa Monica, California, on April 2, 1920, son of Samuel Chester Webb and Margaret (née Smith) Webb. He grew up in the Bunker Hill section of Los Angeles. His father left home before Webb was born, and Webb never knew him.

In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Webb lived in the parish of Our Lady of Loretto Catholic Church and attended Our Lady of Loretto Elementary School in Echo Park, where he served as an altar boy. He then attended Belmont High School, near downtown Los Angeles, where he was elected student body president. He wrote to Belmont&#x27;s student body in the 1938 edition of its yearbook, &quot;Campanile&quot;, &quot;You who showed me the magnificent warmth of friendship which I know, and you know, I will carry with me forever.&quot; Webb attended St. John&#x27;s University, Minnesota, where he studied art.
During World War II, Webb enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps, but he &quot;washed out&quot; of flight training. He later received a hardship discharge because he was the primary financial support for both his mother and grandmother.

==Career==

===Acting===
Following his discharge, Webb moved to San Francisco, where a wartime shortage of announcers led to a temporary appointment to his own radio show on ABC&#x27;s KGO Radio. &quot;The Jack Webb Show&quot; was a half-hour comedy that had a limited run on ABC radio in 1946. Prior to that, he had a one-man program, &quot;One Out of Seven,&quot; on KGO in which he dramatized a news story from the previous week.

By 1949, Webb had abandoned comedy for drama, and starred in &quot;Pat Novak, for Hire,&quot; a radio show originating from KFRC about a man who worked as an unlicensed private detective. The program co-starred Raymond Burr. &quot;Pat Novak&quot; was notable for writing that imitated the hardboiled style of such writers as Raymond Chandler, with lines such as: &quot;She drifted into the room like 98 pounds of warm smoke. Her voice was hot and sticky — like a furnace full of marshmallows.&quot; Early in 1949, Webb served as the main antagonist of Alan Ladd&#x27;s protagonist character Dan Holliday in &quot;The Better Man&quot; episode of the radio series &quot;Box 13&quot;, which aired on January 2, 1949.

Webb&#x27;s radio shows included &quot;Johnny Madero, Pier 23;&quot; &quot;Jeff Regan, Investigator;&quot; &quot;Murder and Mr. Malone;&quot; &quot;Pete Kelly&#x27;s Blues;&quot; and &quot;One Out of Seven.&quot; Webb provided all of the voices on &quot;One Out of Seven,&quot; often vigorously attacking racial prejudice.

In 1950, Webb appeared in three films that would become cult classics. In &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, he is the fiancé of William Holden&#x27;s love interest Nancy Olson (his performance is very animated and jovial, unlike his later deadpan style). He played a war veteran in Marlon Brando&#x27;s first feature, &quot;The Men&quot;. And in the film noir &quot;Dark City&quot;, he co-starred with Harry Morgan, his future partner on the second &quot;Dragnet&quot; series.

Webb&#x27;s most famous motion-picture role was as the combat-hardened Marine Corps drill instructor at Parris Island in the 1957 film &quot;The D.I.&quot;, with Don Dubbins as a callow Marine private. Webb&#x27;s hard-nosed approach to this role, that of Drill Instructor Technical Sergeant James Moore, would be reflected in much of his later acting, but &quot;The D.I.&quot; was a box office failure.

Webb was approached to play the role of Vernon Wormer, dean of Faber College, in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House,&quot; but he refused, saying &quot;the movie didn&#x27;t make any damn sense&quot;; John Vernon ultimately played the role.

===&quot;Dragnet&quot; and stardom ===
Webb had a featured role as a crime-lab technician in the 1948 film &quot;He Walked by Night,&quot; based on the real-life murder of California Highway Patrolman Loren Cornwell Roosevelt, by Erwin Walker. The film was produced in semidocumentary style with technical assistance provided by Detective Sergeant Marty Wynn of the Los Angeles Police Department. &quot;He Walked By Night&#x27;s&quot; thinly veiled fictionalized recounting of the 1946 Walker crime spree gave Webb the idea for &quot;Dragnet:&quot; a recurring series based on real cases from LAPD police files, featuring authentic depictions of the modern police detective, including methods, mannerisms, and technical language.

With much assistance from Wynn and legendary LAPD chief William H. Parker, &quot;Dragnet&quot; premiered on NBC Radio in 1949 and ran until 1957. It was also picked up as a television series by NBC, which aired episodes each season from 1952 to 1959. Webb played Sgt. Joe Friday and Barton Yarborough co-starred as Sgt. Ben Romero. After Yarborough&#x27;s death, Ben Alexander joined the cast.
Webb was a stickler for attention to detail. He believed viewers wanted &quot;realism&quot; and tried to give it to them. Webb had tremendous respect for those in law enforcement. He often said, in interviews, that he was angry about the &quot;ridiculous amount&quot; of abuse to which police were subjected by the press and the public. Webb was also impressed by the long hours, the low pay, and the high injury rate among police investigators of the day, particularly in the LAPD, which had by then acquired a notorious reputation for jettisoning officers who had become ill or injured in the line of duty; in Webb&#x27;s book, &quot;The Badge&quot;, one of Erwin Walker&#x27;s victims, LAPD detective Lt. Colin Forbes, was among those whose experiences were so noted.

In announcing his vision of &quot;Dragnet,&quot; Webb said he intended to perform a service for the police by showing them as low-key working-class heroes. &quot;Dragnet&quot; moved away from earlier portrayals of the police in shows such as &quot;Jeff Regan&quot; and &quot;Pat Novak,&quot; which had often shown them as brutal and even corrupt. &quot;Dragnet&quot; became a successful television show in 1952. Barton Yarborough died of a heart attack in 1951, after filming only two episodes, and Barney Phillips (Sgt. Ed Jacobs) and Herbert Ellis (Officer Frank Smith) temporarily stepped in as partners. Veteran radio and film actor Ben Alexander took over the role of jovial, burly Officer Frank Smith. Alexander was popular and remained a cast member until the show&#x27;s cancellation in 1959. In 1954, a full-length feature-film adaptation of the series was released, starring Webb, Alexander, and Richard Boone.

The television version of &quot;Dragnet&quot; began with this narration by George Fenneman: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, the story you are about to see is true. The names have been changed to protect the innocent.&quot; Webb would intone, &quot;This is the city: Los Angeles, California.&quot; He would then make a historical or topical point, describe his duties, his partner, and superior on the episode. The radio series had a similar opening, though Webb, as Friday, did not give a unique Los Angeles-themed opening. Webb then set the plot by describing a typical day and then led into the story. &quot;It was Wednesday, March 19th. It was cool in Los Angeles. I was at headquarters, working narcotics ...&quot; At the end of each show, Fenneman repeated his opening narration, revised to read: &quot;The story you have just seen is true. The names were changed to protect the innocent.&quot;

A second announcer, Hal Gibney, usually gave dates when and specific courtrooms where trials were held for the suspects, announcing the trial verdicts after commercial breaks. Many suspects shown to have been found guilty at the end were also shown as having been confined at San Quentin State Prison. Webb frequently recreated entire floors of buildings on sound stages, such as the police headquarters at Los Angeles City Hall and a floor of the &quot;Los Angeles Herald Examiner.&quot;

During &quot;Dragnet&quot;″s early days, Webb continued to appear in movies, notably as Artie Green, the best friend of William Holden&#x27;s character in the 1950 Billy Wilder film &quot;Sunset Boulevard.&quot; The character Green was an assistant director and fiancé to script reader Betty Schaefer (played by Nancy Olson).

In &quot;Dark City&quot;, Webb played a vicious card sharp and Harry Morgan a punch-drunk ex-fighter, in contrast to the pair&#x27;s straight-arrow image in the later &quot;Dragnet&quot;. Also in 1950, Webb appeared in &quot;The Men&quot;, Marlon Brando&#x27;s debut film. Both actors played paraplegics undergoing rehabilitation at a veterans&#x27; hospital. In a subplot, Webb&#x27;s character, a cynical intellectual, is fleeced of his life savings by a woman who feigns romantic interest.

In 1951, Webb introduced a short-lived radio series, &quot;Pete Kelly&#x27;s Blues&quot;, in an attempt to bring the music he loved to a broader audience. That show became the basis for a 1955 film of the same name. In 1959, a television version was made. Neither was very successful. The character of Pete Kelly was a cornet player who supplemented his income from playing in a nightclub band by working as a private investigator.

==1960s==
From September 1962 through May 1963, Webb was the executive producer of &quot;GE True&quot;, an anthology series that ran for 33 episodes, each of which Webb acted as host-narrator for while also directing and acting in some episodes. At the beginning of June 1963, it was reported that &quot;GE True&quot; would not continue.

In February 1963, Webb succeeded William T. Orr as executive in charge of Warner Bros. Television, with Orr moving to the motion picture part of Warner Bros. Webb brought about wholesale changes to the ABC/Warner Bros. detective series &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; retaining only Efrem Zimbalist Jr., in the role of private detective Stuart Bailey. The result was a disaster, and critics accused Webb of being out of touch with the younger generation of viewers. 

That same year, Webb sold &quot;Temple Houston&quot; to NBC. The show, starring Jeffrey Hunter, followed the exploits of Temple Lea Houston, a circuit-riding lawyer and the youngest son of Sam Houston. Despite Webb and Hunter&#x27;s high profiles, however, it ended after its 26-week run. In a 1965 interview with &quot;The Milwaukee Journal&quot;, Hunter described the situation:

Webb&#x27;s role with Warner ended in December 1963.

===1967: &quot;Dragnet&quot; returns===

Shortly after leaving his position at Warner Bros., he first attempted to produce an adaptation of the &quot;Selena Mead&quot; books by Patricia McGerr for CBS, then Webb teamed with Universal Television to begin work on a new &quot;Dragnet&quot; series. A pilot television film, based on the Harvey Glatman serial killings, was produced in 1966 for NBC, with Webb&#x27;s Sgt. Joe Friday joined by Harry Morgan as Officer Bill Gannon. Webb had tried to get Ben Alexander to reprise his role as Frank Smith, but Alexander would not leave the ABC series &quot;Felony Squad.&quot;

The new &quot;Dragnet&quot; premiered as a midseason replacement series on January 12, 1967, and aired until April 16, 1970. To distinguish it from the original series, the year of production was added to the title (&quot;Dragnet 1967,&quot; &quot;Dragnet 1968,&quot; etc.). The revival emphasized crime prevention and outreach to the public. Its attempts to address the contemporary youth-drug culture (such as the revival&#x27;s first episode, &quot;The LSD Story&quot;, guest-starring Michael Burns as Benjamin John &quot;Blue Boy&quot; Carver, voted 85th-best TV episode of all time by &quot;TV Guide&quot; and TV Land) have led certain episodes on the topic to achieve cult status due to their strained attempts to be &quot;with-it&quot;, such as Joe Friday grilling &quot;Blue Boy&quot; by asking him, &quot;You&#x27;re pretty high and far out, aren&#x27;t you? What kind of kick are you on, son?&quot; Don Dubbins, who had acted alongside Webb in &quot;The D.I.&quot; in 1957, was featured in the second &quot;Dragnet 1967&quot; episode, &quot;The Big Explosion,&quot; and was another featured actor in Mark VII Limited programs beginning in the 1960s. Other Webb-affiliated actors featured in the revived series many times in different roles were Virginia Gregg, Peggy Webber, Clark Howat, Olan Soule, Bobby Troup, Tim Donnelly, and Marco Lopez.

In 1968, Webb and his production partner R.A. Cinader launched &quot;Adam-12&quot; on NBC. A spinoff of &quot;Dragnet,&quot; &quot;Adam-12&quot; starred Martin Milner and Kent McCord as a pair of LAPD officers, and followed their escapades while on patrol. Running until 1975 for a total of seven seasons, &quot;Adam-12&quot; was Webb&#x27;s second-longest running television series, with the eight seasons recorded by the original &quot;Dragnet&quot; being the longest.

Also in 1968, Webb and Johnny Carson performed a sketch on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; that has since become known as the &quot;Copper Clapper Caper&quot; sketch. Webb, in character as Joe Friday, was working on the case of a robbery at a school-bell factory. Carson played the owner of the factory and victim of the theft, which consisted of each bell being relieved of its clapper (the device that makes the bell ring). The sketch&#x27;s dialogue consisted of Webb and Carson discussing the situation in deadpan style and using alliteration and tongue twisters to describe the incident, each word having either a &quot;c&quot; or &quot;cl&quot; sound at the beginning. Both Webb and Carson tried desperately not to lose composure, but both did, near the end of the sketch.

==1970s and 1980s==

In 1970, Webb decided to bring an end to &quot;Dragnet&quot; and cease acting to focus on expanding Mark VII Limited&#x27;s production profile. In 1971, Webb entered the world of district attorneys and federal government work with two series. The first, &quot;The D.A.&quot;, starred Robert Conrad and Harry Morgan as a pair of Los Angeles County ADAs, with Conrad playing a junior ADA and Morgan his superior. The second, &quot;O&#x27;Hara, United States Treasury,&quot; was a co-production of Webb and David Janssen, the former star of &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and future star of &quot;Harry O,&quot; for CBS (a rare non-NBC Mark VII effort) and featured Janssen as a Nebraska county sheriff-turned-United States Treasury Department agent. Neither series lasted very long, as &quot;The D.A.,&quot; Webb&#x27;s last 30-minute series, was cancelled after 15 episodes and &quot;O&#x27;Hara&quot; ended after 22.

Later in the 1971–72 season, Webb and Cinader launched &quot;Emergency!&quot;, which focused on the fictional Station 51 Rescue Squad of the L.A. County Fire Department, and its work in coordination with the emergency department staff of the fictional Rampart General Hospital. LACoFD&#x27;s paramedic program was among the first paramedic services in the United States. Webb cast his ex-wife, Julie London, as well as her second husband and &quot;Dragnet&quot; ensemble player Bobby Troup, as head nurse Dixie McCall and Dr. Joe Early, respectively, with Randolph Mantooth and Kevin Tighe playing paramedics John Gage and Roy DeSoto and Robert Fuller playing Dr. Kelly Brackett, Rampart&#x27;s Chief of Emergency Medicine.

&quot;Emergency!&quot; ran as part of NBC&#x27;s Saturday-night lineup for six entire seasons, and it was a hugely popular series, sometimes winning its time slot against CBS&#x27;s popular Saturday-night comedy block, which included &quot;All in the Family.&quot; The series came to an end in 1977, but it spawned a series of telefilms that ran until 1979. Webb&#x27;s company and Universal also contracted with animator Fred Calvert to produce a spin-off Saturday-morning cartoon show for NBC titled &quot;Emergency +4,&quot; which ran for three seasons (the last in reruns) and featured the paramedics Gage and DeSoto assisted by four youngsters and their three pets. The franchise was also credited in performing a social good in easing acceptance of the emergency medical service and encouraging communities to establish the service locally.

&quot;Emergency!&quot; was Webb&#x27;s last sustained success. Of the remaining series his company produced, the only two that lasted longer than one season were &quot;Hec Ramsey,&quot; a two-season component of the &quot;NBC Mystery Movie&quot; wheel series that featured former &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; star Richard Boone as a pioneering forensic scientist in the Old West, and &quot;Project UFO&quot;, an anthology based on the investigations into UFOs as compiled by Project Bluebook that also ran for two seasons beginning in 1978. In 1977, he quit Universal Studios, and set up Mark VII Limited independently, signing a distribution deal with Worldvision Enterprises, and set up offices in the Samuel Goldwyn Studios.

Despite his string of short-lived series in the late 1970s, Webb still kept trying to recapture his previous success and decided to bring &quot;Dragnet&quot; back to television for a third series in 1983. Five scripts had been produced and Kent McCord, one of the stars of &quot;Adam-12,&quot; was cast as Joe Friday&#x27;s new partner.

In 1987, Dan Aykroyd and Tom Hanks starred in a movie parody (and homage) to Webb, titled &quot;Dragnet&quot;, along with Harry Morgan, who reprised his role from the television series as Bill Gannon, who had by now become a captain of detectives. The comedy film was written and directed by Tom Mankiewicz, in his directorial debut. Aykroyd played the role of Joe Friday, described as the namesake nephew of the original series lead, while Hanks co-starred as Detective Officer Pep Streebeck, Friday&#x27;s new smart-alecky and streetwise partner.

==Personal life==
Webb&#x27;s personal life was better defined by his love of jazz than his interest in police work. He had a collection of more than 6,000 jazz recordings. Webb&#x27;s own recordings reached cult status, including his deadpan delivery of &quot;Try A Little Tenderness&quot;. His lifelong interest in the cornet allowed him to move easily in the jazz culture, where he met singer and actress Julie London. They married in 1947 and had daughters Stacy and Lisa. They divorced in 1954. He was married three more times after that, to Dorothy Towne for two years beginning in 1955, to former Miss USA Jackie Loughery for six years beginning in 1958, and to his longtime associate, Opal Wright, for the last two years of his life.

Stacy Webb authorized and collaborated on a book, &quot;Just the Facts, Ma&#x27;am: The Authorized Biography of Jack Webb, Creator of Dragnet, Adam-12, and Emergency!,&quot; of which Daniel Moyer and Eugene Alvarez were the primary authors. It was published in 1999. Stacy did not live to see the publication of the book, having been killed in a collision with a California Highway Patrol vehicle three years earlier.

==Death==

Webb died of an apparent heart attack in the early morning hours of December 23, 1982, at age 62. He is interred at Sheltering Hills Plot 1999, Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles, and was given a funeral with full Los Angeles police honors. On Webb&#x27;s death, Chief Daryl Gates announced that badge number 714, which was used by Joe Friday in &quot;Dragnet,&quot; would be retired. Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley ordered all flags lowered to half staff in Webb&#x27;s honor for a day, and Webb was buried with a replica LAPD badge bearing the rank of sergeant and the number 714.

==Legacy==
Webb has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for radio (at 7040 Hollywood Boulevard) and the other for television (at 6728 Hollywood Boulevard). In 1992, Webb was posthumously inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.

<text>Alfred Vaino Aho (born August 9, 1941) is a Canadian computer scientist best known for his work on programming languages, compilers, and related algorithms, and his textbooks on the art and science of computer programming.

Aho was elected into the National Academy of Engineering in 1999 for his contributions to the fields of algorithms and programming tools.

He and his long-time collaborator Jeffrey Ullman are the recipients of the 2020 Turing Award, generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science.

==Career==
Aho received a B.A.Sc. (1963) in Engineering Physics from the University of Toronto, then an M.A. (1965) and Ph.D. (1967) in Electrical Engineering/Computer Science from Princeton University. He conducted research at Bell Labs from 1967 to 1991, and again from 1997 to 2002 as Vice President of the Computing Sciences Research Center. Since 1995, he has held the Lawrence Gussman Professorship in Computer Science at Columbia University. He served as chair of the department from 1995 to 1997, and again in the spring of 2003.

In his PhD thesis Aho created indexed grammars and the nested-stack automaton as vehicles for extending the power of context-free languages, but retaining many of their decidability and closure properties. One application of indexed grammars is modelling parallel rewriting systems, particularly in biological applications.

After graduating from Princeton, Aho joined the Computing Sciences Research Center at Bell Labs where he devised efficient regular expression and string-pattern matching algorithms that he implemented in the first versions of the Unix tools codice_1 and codice_2. The codice_3 algorithm has become known as the Aho–Corasick algorithm; it is used by several bibliographic search-systems, including the one developed by Margaret J. Corasick, and by other string-searching applications.

At Bell Labs, Aho worked closely with Steve Johnson and Jeffrey Ullman to develop efficient algorithms for analyzing and translating programming languages. Steve Johnson used the bottom-up LALR parsing algorithms to create the syntax-analyzer generator yacc, and Michael E. Lesk and Eric Schmidt used Aho&#x27;s regular-expression pattern-matching algorithms to create the lexical-analyzer generator lex. The lex and yacc tools and their derivatives have been used to develop the front ends of many of today&#x27;s programming language compilers.

Aho and Ullman wrote a series of textbooks on compiling techniques that codified the theory relevant to compiler design. Their 1977 textbook &quot;Principles of Compiler Design&quot; had a green dragon on the front cover and became known as &quot;the green dragon book&quot;. In 1986 Aho and Ullman were joined by Ravi Sethi to create a new edition, &quot;the red dragon book&quot; (which was briefly shown in the 1995 movie &quot;Hackers&quot;), and in 2006 also by Monica Lam to create &quot;the &quot;. The dragon books are used for university courses as well as industry references.

In 1974, Aho, John Hopcroft, and Ullman wrote &quot;The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms&quot;, codifying some of their early research on algorithms. This book became one of the most highly cited books in computer science for several decades and helped to stimulate the creation of algorithms and data structures as a central course in the computer science curriculum.

Aho is also widely known for his co-authorship of the AWK programming language with Peter J. Weinberger and Brian Kernighan (the &quot;A&quot; stands for &quot;Aho&quot;). Aho&#x27;s research interests include programming languages, compilers, algorithms, and quantum computing. He is part of the Language and Compilers research-group at Columbia University.

Overall, his works have been cited 81,040 times and he has an h-index of 66, as of May 8, 2019.

Aho has received many prestigious honors, including the IEEE&#x27;s John von Neumann Medal and membership in the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003. He holds honorary doctorates from the University of Waterloo, from the University of Helsinki, and from the University of Toronto. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, ACM, Bell Labs, and IEEE.

Aho has twice served as chair of the Advisory Committee for the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate of the National Science Foundation. He is a past president of the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computability Theory. Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman were co-recipients of the 2017 C&amp;C Prize awarded by NEC Corporation. He and Ullman were named recipients of the 2020 Turing Award on March 31, 2021.

==Personal life==
Aho has taught at Columbia University in New York City since 1995. He won the Great Teacher Award from the Society of Columbia Graduates in 2003.

The range of services conducted by porters is extensive, from shuttling luggage aboard a train (a railroad porter) to bearing heavy burdens at altitude in inclement weather on multi-month mountaineering expeditions. They can carry items on their backs (backpack) or on their heads. The word &quot;porter&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;portare&quot; (to carry).

The use of humans to transport cargo dates to the ancient world, prior to domesticating animals and development of the wheel. Historically it remained prevalent in areas where slavery was permitted, and exists today where modern forms of mechanical conveyance are impractical or impossible, such as in mountainous terrain, or thick jungle or forest cover.

Over time, slavery diminished and technology advanced, but the role of porter for specialized transporting services remains strong in the 21st century. Examples include bellhops at hotels, redcaps at railway stations, skycaps at airports, and bearers on adventure trips engaged by foreign travelers.

== Expeditions ==
Porters, frequently called &quot;Sherpas&quot; in the Himalayas (after the ethnic group most Himalayan porters come from), are also an essential part of mountaineering: they are typically highly skilled professionals who specialize in the logistics of mountain climbing, not merely people paid to carry loads (although carrying is integral to the profession). Frequently, porters/Sherpas work for companies who hire them out to climbing groups, to serve both as porters and as mountain guides; the term &quot;guide&quot; is often used interchangeably with &quot;Sherpa&quot; or &quot;porter&quot;, but there are certain differences. Porters are expected to prepare the route before and/or while the main expedition climbs, climbing up beforehand with tents, food, water, and equipment (enough for themselves and for the main expedition), which they place in carefully located deposits on the mountain. This preparation can take months of work before the main expedition starts. Doing this involves numerous trips up and down the mountain, until the last and smallest supply deposit is planted shortly below the peak. When the route is prepared, either entirely or in stages ahead of the expedition, the main body follows. The last stage is often done without the porters, they remaining at the last camp, a quarter mile or below the summit, meaning only the main expedition is given the credit for mounting the summit. In many cases, since the porters are going ahead, they are forced to freeclimb, driving spikes and laying safety lines for the main expedition to use as they follow. Porters (such as Sherpas for example), are frequently local ethnic types, well adapted to living in the rarified atmosphere and accustomed to life in the mountains. Although they receive little glory, porters or Sherpas are often considered among the most skilled of mountaineers, and are generally treated with respect, since the success of the entire expedition is only possible through their work. They are also often called upon to stage rescue expeditions when a part of the party is endangered or there is an injury; when a rescue attempt is successful, several porters are usually called upon to transport the injured climber(s) back down the mountain so the expedition can continue. A well known incident where porters attempted to rescue numerous stranded climbers, and often died as a result, is the 2008 K2 disaster. Sixteen Sherpas were killed in the 2014 Mount Everest ice avalanche, inciting the entire Sherpa guide community to refuse to undertake any more ascents for the remainder of the year, making any further expeditions impossible.

== History ==

Human adaptability and flexibility led to the early use of humans for transporting gear. Porters were commonly used as beasts of burden in the ancient world, when labor was generally cheap and slavery widespread. The ancient Sumerians, for example, enslaved women to shift wool and flax.

In the early Americas, where there were few native beasts of burden, all goods were carried by porters called Tlamemes in the Nahuatl language of Mesoamerica. In colonial times, some areas of the Andes employed porters called silleros to carry persons, particularly Europeans, as well as their luggage across the difficult mountain passes. Throughout the globe porters served, and in some areas continue to, as such littermen, particularly in crowded urban areas.

Many great works of engineering were created solely by muscle power in the days before machinery or even wheelbarrows and wagons; massive workforces of workers and bearers would complete impressive earthworks by manually lugging the earth, stones, or bricks in baskets on their backs.
Porters were very important to the local economies of many large cities in Brazil during the 1800s, where they were known as &quot;ganhadores&quot;. In 1857, &quot;ganhadores&quot; in Salvador, Bahia, went on strike in the first general strike in the country&#x27;s history.

== Contribution to mountain climbing expeditions ==
The contributions of porters can often go overlooked. Amir Mehdi was a Pakistani mountaineer and porter known for being part of the team which managed the first successful ascent of Nanga Parbat in 1953, and of K2 in 1954 with an Italian expedition. He, along with the Italian mountaineer Walter Bonatti, are also known for having survived a night at the highest open bivouac - - on K2 in 1954. Fazal Ali, who was born in the Shimshal Valley in Pakistan North, is – according to the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; – the only man ever to have scaled K2 (8611 m) three times, in 2014, 2017 and 2018, all without oxygen, but his achievements have gone largely unrecognised.

== Today ==
Porters are still paid to shift burdens in many third-world countries where motorized transport is impractical or unavailable, often alongside pack animals.

The Sherpa people of Nepal are so renowned as mountaineering porters that their ethnonym is synonymous with that profession. Their skill, knowledge of the mountains and local culture, and ability to perform at altitude make them indispensable for the highest Himalayan expeditions.

Porters at Indian railway stations are called coolies, a term for unskilled Asian labourer derived from the Chinese word for porter.

Mountain porters are also still in use in a handful of more developed countries, including Slovakia (&quot;horský nosič&quot;) and Japan (&quot;bokka&quot;, 歩荷). These men (and more rarely women) regularly resupply mountain huts and tourist chalets at high-altitude mountain ranges.

=== In North America ===
Certain trade-specific terms are used for forms of porters in North America, including bellhop (hotel porter), redcap (railway station porter), and skycap (airport porter).

The practice of railroad station porters wearing red-colored caps to distinguish them from blue-capped train personnel with other duties was begun on Labor Day of 1890 by an African-American porter in order to stand out from the crowds at Grand Central Terminal in New York City. The tactic immediately caught on, over time adapted by other forms of porters for their specialties.

<text>The decade of the 1990s in film involved many significant developments in the industry of cinema. Numerous feature-length movies were specifically filmed and/or edited to be displayed not only on theater screens but also the smaller TV screens, like showing more close-ups and less wide shots during dialogue scenes. Moreover, the home video market grew into being a major factor on the total revenue of a theatrical film, often doubling the amount. An example of both cases is &quot;&quot;, which was initially planned to have a direct-to-video release.

== Trends ==
* These particular ten years are notable for milestone advancements in CGI technology, seen in such motion pictures as &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, and &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; courtesy of Industrial Light &amp; Magic. 1995&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story&quot; by Pixar became the first feature film to be completely computer-animated, heralding the use of 3D graphics as a tool for filmmakers to achieve new visuals on-screen.
*Stemming from the tail end of the 1980s, the mainstream successes of low-budget directors like Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez, Kevin Smith, Paul Thomas Anderson, Gus Van Sant, Richard Linklater, Steven Soderbergh, and the Coen brothers; alongside the increased prominence of independent movie studios such as New Line Cinema, Miramax Films, and Gramercy Pictures; gave rise to a boom period of highly profitable indie films that include &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, &quot;Fargo&quot;, &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, and &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;.
* The Disney Renaissance began in late 1989 with &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, reached peak popularity with &quot;The Lion King&quot; in 1994, and ended in 1999 with &quot;Tarzan&quot;. During its influential run, the mass appeal of animated musicals got exceptionally rejuvenated (as opposed to &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; in 1990, which contains no original songs and has been generally deemed a commercial disappointment even compared to its 1977 predecessor), resulting in supposed emulations from similar production companies. However, merely three of said attempts proved to be lucrative, namely &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; by Skellington, &quot;Anastasia&quot; by Fox, and &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; by DreamWorks. Around six months prior to the decade&#x27;s conclusion, Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot; prospered in part through parodying the conventions of this trend.
* 1988&#x27;s &quot;Die Hard&quot; had established what became a common plot scenario for many 1990s action films, which is the matchup of an everyman hero against a colorful villain who is threatening the lives of innocents in an isolated setting, though with certain variations. Features of this kind, and the sequels that followed some of them, are often referred to as &quot;Die Hard on a _____&quot;: &quot;Under Siege&quot; (battleship), &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; (mountain), &quot;Speed&quot; (bus), &quot;The Rock&quot; (prison island), &quot;Con Air&quot; (prison plane), &quot;Air Force One&quot; (presidential plane), and so on.
* A resurgence of disaster films dominated the box office with blockbusters such as &quot;Twister&quot;, &quot;Independence Day&quot;, &quot;Titanic&quot;, and &quot;Armageddon&quot;.
* Several leading figures of 1980s to mid-1990s Hong Kong action cinema migrated to Hollywood with varying success: Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Chow Yun-fat, Michelle Yeoh, John Woo, Yuen Woo-ping, Tsui Hark, Ringo Lam, etc. Updating martial arts and gunfight choreography in American motion pictures with such releases as &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;, &quot;Face/Off&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot;, &quot;Rush Hour&quot;, and &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Three Western world directorial debuts of established Eastern filmmakers were for Jean-Claude Van Damme star vehicles, though these collaborations only performed moderately en masse at the global market.
* Wes Craven&#x27;s &quot;Scream&quot; revitalized the declining interest in slasher films through satirizing the subgenre with characters that are well-versed in its clichés. Leading to studios capitalizing especially on the high school to college age demographic with the likes of &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, &quot;Scream 2&quot;, &quot;Urban Legend&quot;, and &quot;I Still Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;. The three biggest hits among these movies were written or adapted by Kevin Williamson, who also co-wrote the sci-fi horror &quot;The Faculty&quot;, which targeted the same audience as well.

<text>Fulling, also known as tucking or walking (Scots: &quot;waukin&quot;, hence often spelt waulking in Scottish English), is a step in woollen clothmaking which involves the cleansing of woven cloth (particularly wool) to eliminate (lanolin) oils, dirt, and other impurities, and to make it shrink by friction and pressure. The work delivers a smooth, tightly finished fabric that is insulating and water-repellent. Well-known examples are duffel cloth, first produced in Flanders in the 14th century, and loden, produced in Austria from the 16th century on.

Waulking could be done with the hands and feet. In medieval Europe, it was done in water-powered fulling mills. After the Industrial Revolution, coal and electric power were used.

Felting refers more generally to the interlocking of loose wool fibers; they need not be spun and woven first.

== Process ==
Fulling involves two processes: scouring (cleaning) and milling (thickening). Removing the oils encourages felting, and the cloth is pounded to clean it and to encourage the fibers to felt, so in practice the processes overlap.

===Scouring===

Urine was so important to the fulling business that it was taxed in Ancient Rome. Stale urine, known as wash or lant, was a source of ammonium salts and assisted in cleansing and whitening the cloth and having its fibers intertwined.

By the medieval period, fuller&#x27;s earth had been introduced for use in the process. This is a soft clay-like material occurring naturally as an impure hydrous aluminium silicate. Worked through the cloth, it absorbs oils and dirt. It was used in conjunction with wash. More recently, soap has been used.

===Milling===
The second function of fulling was to thicken cloth by matting the fibres together to give it strength and increase waterproofing (felting). This was vital in the case of woollens, made from carded wool, but not for worsted materials made from combed wool. After this stage, water was used to rinse out the foul-smelling liquor used during cleansing. Felting of wool occurs upon hammering or other mechanical agitation because the microscopic scales on the surface of wool fibres hook together, somewhat like hook and loop fixings.

==== Manual methods ====

Originally, fulling was carried out by the pounding of the woollen cloth with a club, or the fuller&#x27;s feet or hands.

In Roman times, fulling was conducted by slaves working the cloth while ankle deep in tubs of human urine.

There are several Biblical references to fulling (; and ; ; ). In addition to this, at least one reference appears in the speeches of Lysias, written in Athens during the 5th century BC.

Scotland, then a rather remote and un-industrialized region, retained manual methods into the 1700s. In Scottish Gaelic tradition, this process was accompanied by waulking songs, which women sang to set the pace.

==== Mills ====
From the medieval period, the fulling of cloth was often done in a water mill, known as a fulling mill, a walk mill, or a tuck mill, and in Wales, a pandy. They appear to have originated in the 9th or 10th century in Europe. The earliest known reference to a fulling mill in France, which dates from about 1086, was discovered in Normandy. There was a fulling mill established at Temple Guiting, Gloucestershire which was documented in the Domesday Book (also 1086). E. A. Lewis (possibly Welsh historian Edward Arthur Lewis) observed:

: &#x27;Fulling mills appear in Wales early in the reign of Edward II., just at the time when fulling mills were being introduced into Lancashire.&#x27;
By the time of the Crusades in the late eleventh century, fulling mills were active throughout the medieval world.

The mills beat the cloth with wooden hammers, known as fulling stocks or fulling hammers. Fulling stocks were of two kinds, falling stocks (operating vertically) that were used only for scouring, and driving or hanging stocks. In both cases the machinery was operated by cams on the shaft of a waterwheel or on a tappet wheel, which lifted the hammer.

Driving stocks were pivoted so that the foot (the head of the hammer) struck the cloth almost horizontally. The stock had a tub holding the liquor and cloth. This was somewhat rounded on the side away from the hammer, so that the cloth gradually turned, ensuring that all parts of it were milled evenly. However, the cloth was taken out about every two hours to undo plaits and wrinkles. The &#x27;foot&#x27; was approximately triangular in shape, with notches to assist the turning of the cloth.

==Post-processing==

After fulling, cloth was stretched on great frames known as tenters, to which it is attached by tenterhooks (whence the phrase &quot;being on tenterhooks&quot;). The area where the tenters were erected was known as a tenterground.

Cloth would also have the nap raised by napping or gigging. The surface would then be sheared smooth. The process might be repeated for a smoother finish.

== Legacy ==

The names for workers who performed these tasks (&quot;fuller&quot;, &quot;tucker&quot;, and &quot;walker&quot;) have become common surnames.

The Welsh word for a fulling mill is &quot;pandy&quot;, which appears in many place-names, for example Tonypandy (&quot;fulling mill lea&quot;).

<text>Fowl are birds belonging to one of two biological orders, namely the gamefowl or landfowl (Galliformes) and the waterfowl (Anseriformes). Anatomical and molecular similarities suggest these two groups are close evolutionary relatives; together, they form the fowl clade which is scientifically known as Galloanserae or Galloanseres (initially termed Galloanseri) (Latin &quot;gallus&quot; (&quot;rooster&quot;) + &quot;ānser&quot; (&quot;goose&quot;)). This clade is also supported by morphological and DNA sequence data as well as retrotransposon presence/absence data.

==Terminology==
As opposed to &quot;fowl&quot;, &quot;poultry&quot; is a term for any kind of domesticated bird or bird captive-raised for meat, eggs, or feathers; ostriches, for example, are sometimes kept as poultry, but are neither gamefowl nor waterfowl. In colloquial speech, however, the term &quot;fowl&quot; is often used near-synonymously with &quot;poultry&quot;, and many languages do not distinguish between &quot;poultry&quot; and &quot;fowl&quot;. Nonetheless, the fact that the Galliformes and Anseriformes most likely form a monophyletic group makes a distinction between &quot;fowl&quot; and &quot;poultry&quot; warranted.

The historic difference in English is due to the Germanic/Latin split word pairs characteristic of Middle English; the word &#x27;fowl&#x27; is of Germanic origin (cf. Old English &quot;&quot;, West Frisian , Dutch , German , Swedish , Danish/Norwegian ), whilst &#x27;poultry&#x27; is of Latin via Norman French origin; the presence of an initial /p/ in &quot;poultry&quot; and an initial /f/ in &quot;fowl&quot; is due to Grimm&#x27;s Law. 

Many birds that are eaten by humans are fowl, including poultry such as chickens or turkeys, game birds such as pheasants or partridges, other wildfowl like guineafowl or peafowl, and waterfowl such as ducks or geese.

==Characteristics==
While they are quite diverse ecologically and consequently, in an adaptation to their different lifestyles, also morphologically and ethologically, some features still unite water- and landfowl. Many of these, however, are plesiomorphic for Neornithes as a whole, and are also shared with paleognaths.
*Galloanserae are very prolific; they regularly produce clutches of more than five or even more than 10 eggs, which is a lot for such sizeable birds. By comparison, birds of prey and pigeons rarely lay more than two eggs.
*While most living birds are monogamous, at least for a breeding season, many Galloanserae are notoriously polygynous or polyandrous. To ornithologists, this is particularly well known in dabbling ducks, where the males band together occasionally to forcefully mate with unwilling females. The general public is probably most familiar with the polygynous habits of domestic chickens, where usually one or two roosters are kept with a whole flock of females.
*Hybridization is extremely frequent in the Galloanserae, and genera, not usually known to produce viable hybrids in birds, can be brought to interbreed with comparative ease. Guineafowl have successfully produced hybrids with domestic fowl and Indian peafowl, to which they are not particularly closely related as Galliformes go. This is an important factor complicating mtDNA sequence-based research on their relationships. The mallards of North America, for example, are apparently mostly derived from some males which arrived from Siberia, settled down, and mated with American black duck ancestors. &quot;See also&quot; Gamebird hybrids.
*Galloanserae young are remarkably . Anseriform young are able to swim and dive a few hours after hatching, and the hatchlings of mound-builders (megapodes) are fully feathered and even able to fly for prolonged distances as soon as they emerge from the nest mound.

==Systematics and evolution==
From the fossils that have been recovered, the conclusion that the Galloanserae were already widespread by the end of the Cretaceous is generally accepted. A combination of fossils and molecular clocks estimated the origin of Galloanserae at 85 million years ago. Fossils such as &quot;Vegavis&quot; indicate that essentially modern waterfowl, albeit belonging to a now-extinct lineage, were contemporaries of the non-avian dinosaurs. While the dominant avialans of the Mesozoic Era, the Enantiornithes, died out with all other non-avian dinosaurs, the Galloanserae (fowl) survived to become the first successful group of modern birds after the other dinosaurs died out.

As opposed to the morphologically fairly conservative Galliformes, the Anseriformes have adapted to filter-feeding and are characterized by many autapomorphies related to this lifestyle. The extremely advanced feeding systems of the Anseriformes, together with similarities of the early anseriform &quot;Presbyornis&quot; to shorebirds, had formerly prompted some scientists to ally Anseriformes with Charadriiformes, instead. However, as strong support for the Galloanserae has emerged in subsequent studies, the fowl clade continues to be accepted as a genuine evolutionary lineage by the vast majority of scientists.

==Relationship with humans==

===Spiritual meanings and representations===
Fowl have deep spiritual meanings and roots in ancient cultures, such as Hinduism in India and in many Pagan cultures throughout the world. The peacock, for example, represents truth, beauty, honor, and strength and dreams of peacocks are referred to as good omens.

===As food===
Fowl are frequently kept for both meat and eggs. Chickens, by far, are the most heavily consumed and farmed out of all of them. Other fowl commonly used in cooking include ducks, geese, turkeys and quail.

===As game===
Various species of fowl are hunted for both sport and food. Pheasants have been widely introduced and naturalized outside of their native range in Asia to Europe and North America for use as food and sport.

<text>The onager () (Equus hemionus), also known as hemione or Asiatic wild ass, is a species of the family Equidae native to Asia. A member of the subgenus &quot;Asinus&quot;, the onager was described and given its binomial name by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1775. Six subspecies have been recognized, two of which are extinct.

The onager weighs about and reaches about head-body length. They are reddish-brown or yellowish-brown in color and have broad dorsal stripe on the middle of the back. The onager has never been domesticated. It is among the fastest mammals, capable of running 64–70 km/h (40–43 mph).

The onager formerly had a wider range, from southwest and central to northern Asia including the Levant region, Arabian Peninsula, Afghanistan and Siberia; the prehistoric European wild ass subspecies ranged through Europe until the Bronze age. During early 20th century, the species lost most of its range in the Middle East and Eastern Asia. Today, onagers live in deserts and other arid regions of Iran, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, India, Mongolia and China.

Other than deserts, it lives in grasslands, plains, steppes, and savannahs. Like many other large grazing animals, the onager&#x27;s range has contracted greatly under the pressures of poaching and habitat loss. The onager has been classified as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List in 2015. Of the five subspecies, one is extinct, two are endangered, and two are near threatened; its status in China is not well known.

==Etymology==
The specific name is from the Ancient Greek , from , and ; thus, &#x27;half-donkey&#x27; or mule. The term &quot;onager&quot; comes from the ancient Greek , again from , and .

The species was commonly known as Asian wild ass, in which case the term &quot;onager&quot; was reserved for the &quot;E. h. onager&quot; subspecies, more specifically known as the Persian onager. Until this day, the species share the same name, &quot;onager&quot;.

==Taxonomy and evolution==

The onager is a member of the subgenus &quot;Asinus&quot;, belonging to the genus &quot;Equus&quot; and is classified under the family Equidae. The species was described and given its binomial name &quot;Equus hemionus&quot; by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in 1775.

The Asiatic wild ass, among Old World equids, existed for more than 4 million years. The oldest divergence of &quot;Equus&quot; was the onager followed by the zebras and onwards. A new species called the kiang (&quot;E.kiang&quot;), a Tibetan relative, was previously considered to be a subspecies of the onager as &quot;E.hemionus kiang&quot;, but recent molecular studies indicate it to be a distinct species, having diverged from the closest relative of the Mongolian wild ass&#x27;s ancestor less than 500,000 years ago.
===Subspecies===
Six widely recognized subspecies of the onager include:
A sixth possible subspecies, the Gobi khulan (&quot;E. h. luteus&quot;, also called the &quot;chigetai&quot; or &quot;dziggetai&quot;) has been proposed, but may be synonymous with &quot;E. h. hemionus&quot;.

Debates over the taxonomic identity of the onager occurred until 1980. , four living subspecies and one extinct subspecies of the Asiatic wild ass have been recognized. The Persian onager was formerly known as &quot;Equus onager&quot;, as it was thought to be a distinct species.

==Characteristics==

The onager is generally reddish-brown in color during the summer, becoming yellowish-brown or grayish-brown in the winter. It has a black stripe bordered in white that extends down the middle of the back. The belly, the rump, and the muzzle are white, except for the Mongolian wild ass that has a broad black dorsal stripe bordered with white. It is about in size and in head-body length. Male onagers are usually larger than females.

==Evolution==
The genus &quot;Equus&quot;, which includes all extant equines, is believed to have evolved from &quot;Dinohippus&quot; via the intermediate form &quot;Plesippus&quot;. One of the oldest species is &quot;Equus simplicidens&quot;, described as zebra-like with a donkey-shaped head. The oldest fossil to date is about 3.5 million years old from Idaho, USA. The genus appears to have spread quickly into the Old World, with the similarly aged &quot;Equus livenzovensis&quot; documented from western Europe and Russia.

Molecular phylogenies indicate the most recent common ancestor of all modern equids (members of the genus &quot;Equus&quot;) lived around 5.6 (3.9–7.8) million years ago (Mya). Direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada implies a more recent 4.07&quot; &quot;Mya for the most recent common ancestor within the range of 4.0 to 4.5&quot; &quot;Mya. The oldest divergencies are the Asian hemiones (subgenus &quot;E. (Asinus)&quot;, including the kulan, onager, and kiang), followed by the African zebras (subgenera &quot;E. (Dolichohippus)&quot;, and &quot;E. (Hippotigris)&quot;). All other modern forms including the domesticated horse (and many fossil Pliocene and Pleistocene forms) belong to the subgenus &quot;E. (Equus)&quot; which diverged about 4.8 (3.2–6.5) Mya.

==Distribution and habitat==
The onagers&#x27; favored habitats consist of desert plains, semideserts, oases, arid grasslands, savannahs, shrublands, steppes, mountainous steppes, and mountain ranges. The Turkmenian kulan and Mongolian wild asses are known to live in hot and colder deserts. The IUCN estimates about 28,000 mature individuals in total remain in the wild.

During the late Pleistocene era around 40,000 years ago, the Asiatic wild ass ranged widely across Europe and in southwestern to northeastern Asia. It is also known from Middle Pleistocene fossils from the Nefud Desert of Saudi Arabia. The onager has been regionally extinct in Israel, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, and southern regions of Siberia.
The Mongolian wild ass lives in deserts, mountains, and grasslands of Mongolia and Inner Mongolian region of northern China. A few live in northern Xinjiang region of northwestern China, most of which live mainly in Kalamaili Nature Reserve. It is the most common subspecies, but its populations have drastically decreased to a few thousand due to years of poaching and habitat loss in East Asia. The Gobi Desert is the onager&#x27;s main stronghold. It is regionally extinct in eastern Kazakhstan, southern Siberia, and the Manchurian region of China.

The Indian wild ass was once found throughout the arid parts and desert steppes of northwest India and Pakistan, but about 4,500 of them are found in a few very hot wildlife sanctuaries of Gujarat. The Persian onager is found in two subpopulations in southern and northern Iran. The larger population is found at Khar Turan National Park. However, it is extirpated from Afghanistan. The Turkmenian kulan used to be widespread in central to north Asia. However, it is now found in Turkmenistan and has been reintroduced in southern Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.

==Biology and behavior==

Asiatic wild asses are mostly active at dawn and dusk, even during the intense heat.

===Social structure===
Like most equids, onagers are social animals. Stallions are either solitary or live in groups of two or three. The males have been observed holding harems of females, but in other studies, the dominant stallions defend territories that attract females. Differences in behaviour and social structure likely are the result of changes in climate, vegetation cover, predation, and hunting.

The social behavior of the Asian wild ass can vary widely, depending on different habitats and ranges, and on threats by predators including humans. In Mongolia and Central Asia (&quot;E. h. hemionus&quot; and &quot;E. h. kulan&quot;), an onager stallion can adopt harem-type social groups, with several mares and foals in large home areas in the southwest, or in territory-based social groups in the south and southeast. Also, annual large hikes occur, covering to , where hiking in summer is more limited than in the winter. Onagers also occasionally form large group associations of 450 to 1,200 individuals, but this usually only occurs in places with food or water sources. As these larger groups dissolve again within a day, no overarching hierarchy apart from the ranking of the individual herds seems to exist. Young male onagers also frequently form &quot;bachelor groups&quot; during the winter. Such a lifestyle is also seen in the wild horse, the plains zebras (&quot;E. quagga&quot;) and mountain zebras (&quot;E. zebra&quot;).

Southern populations of onagers in the Middle East and South Asia tend to have a purely territorial life, where areas partly overlap. Dominant stallions have home ranges of , but they can also be significantly larger. These territories include food and rest stops and permanent or periodic water sources. The waters are usually at the edge of a coalfield and not in the center. Mares with foals sometimes find themselves in small groups, in areas up to , which overlap with those of the other groups and dominant stallions. Such features are also seen among Grévy&#x27;s zebras (&quot;E. grevyi&quot;) and the African wild asses.

===Reproduction===

The Asian wild ass is sexually mature at two years old, and the first mating usually takes place at three to four years old.

Breeding is seasonal, and the gestation period of onagers is 11 months; the birth lasts a little more than 10 minutes. Mating and births occur from April to September, with an accumulation from June to July. The mating season in India is in the rainy season. The foal can stand and starts to nurse within 15 to 20 minutes. Females with young tend to form groups of up to five females. During rearing, a foal and dam remain close, but other animals and her own older offspring are displaced by the dam. Occasionally, stallions in territorial wild populations expel the young to mate with the mare again. Wild Asian wild asses reach an age of 14 years, but in captivity, they can live up to 26 years.

===Diet===
The onager is a herbivore and eats grasses, herbs, leaves, fruits, and saline vegetation when available. In dry habitats, it browses on shrubs and trees, but also feeds on seed pods such as &quot;Prosopis&quot; and breaks up woody vegetation with its hooves to get at more succulent herbs growing at the base of woody plants.
The succulent plants of the Zygophyllaceae form an important component of its diet in Mongolia during spring and summer
When natural water sources are unavailable, the onager digs holes in dry riverbeds to reach subsurface water.

===Predation===

The onager is preyed upon by predators such as Persian leopards and striped hyenas. A few cases of onager deaths due to predation by leopards have been recorded in Iran.

==Threats==

The greatest threat facing the onager is poaching for meat and hides, and in some areas for use in traditional medicine. The extreme isolation of many subpopulations also threatens the species, as genetic problems can result from inbreeding. Overgrazing by livestock reduces food availability, and herders also reduce the availability of water at springs. The cutting down of nutritious shrubs and bushes exacerbates the problem. Furthermore, a series of drought years could have devastating effects on this beleaguered species.

Habitat loss and fragmentation are also major threats to the onager, a particular concern in Mongolia as a result of the increasingly dense network of roads, railway lines, and fences required to support mining activities.

The Asiatic wild ass is also vulnerable to diseases. A disease known as the &quot;South African horse sickness&quot; caused a major decline to the Indian wild ass population in the 1960s. However, the subspecies is no longer under threat to such disease and is continuously increasing in number.

==Conservation==

Various breeding programs have been started for the onager subspecies in captivity and in the wild, which increases their numbers to save the endangered species. The species is legally protected in many of the countries in which it occurs. The priority for future conservation measures is to ensure the protection of this species in particularly vulnerable parts of its range, to encourage the involvement of local people in the conservation of the onager, and to conduct further research into the behavior, ecology, and taxonomy of the species.

Two onager subspecies, the Persian onager and the Turkmenian kulan are being reintroduced to their former ranges, including in other regions the Syrian wild ass used to occur in the Middle East. The two subspecies have been reintroduced to the wild of Israel since 1982, and had been breeding hybrids there, whilst the Persian onager alone has been reintroduced to Jordan and the deserts of Saudi Arabia.

==Relationship with humans==

Onagers are notoriously difficult to tame. Equids were used in ancient Sumer to pull wagons , and then chariots on the Standard of Ur, . Clutton-Brock (1992) suggests that these were donkeys rather than onagers on the basis of a &quot;shoulder stripe&quot;. However, close examination of the animals (equids, sheep and cattle) on both sides of the piece indicate that what appears to be a stripe may well be a harness, a trapping, or a joint in the inlay. Genetic testing of skeletons from that era shows that they were kungas, a cross between an onager and a donkey.

== In literature ==
In the Hebrew Bible there is a reference to the onager in Job 39:5:

In by Honoré de Balzac, the onager is identified as the animal from which comes the ass&#x27; skin or shagreen of the title.
A short poem by Ogden Nash also features the onager:

<doc id="140955" wikidata="Q229235" url="?curid=140955" title="Cai Lun">
<text>Cai Lun (; courtesy name: Jingzhong (); – 121 CE), formerly romanized as Ts&#x27;ai Lun, was a Chinese eunuch court official of the Eastern Han dynasty. He occupies a pivotal place in the history of paper due to his addition of pulp via tree bark and hemp ends which resulted in the large-scale manufacture and worldwide spread of paper. Although traditionally regarded as the inventor of paper, earlier forms of paper have existed since the 3rd century BCE, so Cai&#x27;s contributions are limited to innovation, rather than invention.

Born in (in what is now Leiyang), Cai arrived at the imperial court in Luoyang by 75 CE, where he served as a chamberlain for Emperor Ming, and then as , an imperial messenger for Emperor Zhang. To assist Lady Dou in securing her adopted son as designated heir, he interrogated Consort Song and her sister, who then killed themselves. When Emperor He ascended the throne in 88 CE, Dou awarded Cai with two positions: , a political counselor to the emperor that was the highest position for eunuchs of the time, and also as , where Cai oversaw the production of instruments and weapons at the Palace Workshop.

Despite Emperor He&#x27;s successful coup d&#x27;état against the Dou family in 92 CE, Cai was undisturbed by his former ally&#x27;s downfall. His position in the Palace Workshop increased in scope; he became responsible for the production of ceremonial weapons, which the reports were of exemplary craftsmanship. However, Cai&#x27;s most noted innovation was in 105 CE, when he substantially improved the papermaking process with the use of tree bark, hemp waste, old rags, and fishnets. His new type of paper quickly displaced the bamboo and wooden slips used until then, and Cai received wealth and fame throughout the empire. In 110 CE, Lady Deng, who had become the empress dowager to the young Emperor An, appointed Cai to oversee 100 scholars&#x27; new edition of the Five Classics. Cai was rewarded for his imperial service in 114 CE; he received the title of marquis, and was enfeoffed lord of , a small village. When his ally Deng died in 121 CE, Cai was ordered to the Ministry of Justice because of his involvement in the death of the emperor&#x27;s grandmother, Consort Song. Ashamed at his predicament and expecting to be sentenced to death, he committed suicide that year and died in the capital city in which he had spent almost his entire adult life.

Cai&#x27;s improvements to paper-making are considered to have had an enormous impact on human history, and of those who created China&#x27;s Four Great Inventions—the compass, gunpowder, papermaking and printing—Cai is the only inventor whose name is known. Although in China he is revered in ancestor worship, deified as the god of papermaking, and appears in Chinese folklore, he is mostly unknown outside of East Asia. His hometown in Leiyang remains an active center of paper production.
==Sources==
The main source of information on Cai Lun is just 300 characters in volume 78 of the (; &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot;), an official history compiled by the Liu Song dynasty historian and politician Fan Ye. Tsien Tsuen-hsuin, a modern sinologist, noted that while Fan&#x27;s account is the most comprehensive, it is problematic as it was written nearly 300 years after Cai&#x27;s death. The primary source Fan used was the 2nd-century &quot;Dongguan Hanji&quot; (; &quot;History of the Eastern Han&quot;), in which is credited as the author of Cai&#x27;s biography. Yan&#x27;s brief 70-character account is near-contemporary but only survives in a reconstructed state from a lost original. Another older source is a brief mention by the 3rd-century scholar Dong Ba, () who is quoted referencing Cai&#x27;s papermaking accomplishments in the 10th-century &quot;leishu&quot; encyclopedia (&quot;Readings of the Taiping Era&quot;).

Later history books, such as the Song dynasty&#x27;s (; &quot;Compound Source of Matters and Facts&quot;), also include Cai and his work in papermaking. However, some major history books, such as the &quot;Annals of the Later Han&quot; and &quot;&quot; (&quot;Comprehensive Mirror in Aid of Governance&quot;) do not mention Cai&#x27;s papermaking achievements. Sinologist T. H. Barrett suggested this was because &quot;Cai Lun was, after all, a palace eunuch, precisely the sort of person normally viewed with antagonism by the regular bureaucrats who controlled the writing of official (and even most unofficial) history.&quot;

==Life and career==
===Birth and background===
Cai Lun was born in Guiyang Commandery (; modern-day Leiyang, Hunan province) in the Eastern Han dynasty (25–220 CE). His exact year of birth is unknown; estimates include , , and . Other than being born into a poor family, virtually nothing is known of his early life. Guiyang was a southern commandery, where Han Chinese had immigrated for hundreds of years to plant and cultivate rice. Legends suggest there was a pool near his home, south of which was a stone mortar that Cai would later use for papermaking.

===Early imperial court service===
It is not known how Cai came to be in the service of the imperial court in Luoyang (modern-day Luoyang, Henan province), which was distant from his birthplace. The reports that he was first employed during the end of the era (58–75) of Emperor Ming. The site of modern Guiyang Commandery was known to have had various iron mines at the time, so the former director of the Paper Museum in Tokyo, Kiyofusa Narita, suggested that &quot;through the assistance of some who were in charge of the iron foundry, he found opportunity to go to the capital city&quot;. Narita cited Cai&#x27;s future court appointment to oversee the production of weapons, especially swords, as evidence that he must have learned the skills to do so earlier in his life, likely from the iron foundry. Alternatively, if there is any truth to the various folktales about Cai, his supposed habits of trickery may have helped him receive a court appointment.

Cai is known to have been a eunuch in 75 CE, although it is possible he was employed somewhat earlier in the era; sinologist Rafe de Crespigny suggested this was in the early 70s. In the Han dynasty, eunuchs were employed in imperial service and were the only people eligible for certain specialized tasks, such as watching over the imperial harem and the imperial household; there were also certain promotions available exclusively for them. Cai&#x27;s position was probably as a liaison between the privy council and the emperor, and likely involved duties akin to a chamberlain for the imperial family. Narita notes Cai&#x27;s role meant he would have had many chances to become acquainted with the most powerful people in the empire. Around 80 CE, during the subsequent era (76–84) under Emperor Zhang, Cai was promoted to a &quot;Xiao Huangmen&quot; (; &quot;Attendant at the Yellow Gates&quot;). The positions, with a salary-rank of 600 &quot;shi&quot; or &quot;dan&quot;, involved delivering and receiving messages between the imperial palace apartments and the outside court.

===Palace intrigue and workshop===
Since 82 CE, Liu Qing, Zhang&#x27;s son from his concubine Consort Song, had been the designated heir, secured by the favor of Empress Ma. However, Ma&#x27;s death in 79 CE made Lady Dou the empress, and—aiming to develop her family&#x27;s power—she adopted Prince Zhao with the intention of installing him as heir. As a result, when Song became ill in 82 and asked for herbs, Dou falsely accused her of planning to use the herbs for witchcraft against Zhang. Dou then ordered Cai to interrogate Consort Song and her sister, another imperial consort, to force a confession; they both killed themselves. Believing Dou&#x27;s accusation, Zhang replaced Liu Qing with Prince Zhao as heir.

Prince Zhao, ruling as Emperor He, was 10 years old at his accession in 88 CE, so Dou took control as empress dowager and secured her authority by giving various positions to her four brothers, particularly Dou Xian, who promoted Cai to (; &quot;Regular Attendant&quot;) for his loyalty. Cai served as a private counselor to He in political matters; this post gave Cai a salary-rank of 2000 &quot;shi&quot;, and was the highest eunuch-exclusive position, which also made him a chief eunuch of the palace. In the , Cai was characterized as, in the words of de Crespigny, &quot;honest, cautious and a good judge of policy&quot;. Cai was also designated (; &quot;Prefect of the Palace Workshop&quot; or &quot;Prefect of the Masters of Techniques&quot;) later in 88 or 89 CE. While in this eunuch-only position, he would have been responsible for the production of instruments and weapons for imperial use. The role had a salary-rank of 600 &quot;shi&quot;—though this was in addition to the 2000 &quot;shi&quot; from his continued post.

When Emperor He came of age in 92 CE he led various officials, especially Zheng Zhong, in a coup d&#x27;état to overthrow the Dou family. Cai was not involved in their removal, and though he was previously allied with the family, he was undisturbed by the Emperor&#x27;s coup. In 97 CE, his position as expanded in scope, as he became responsible for ceremonial swords and other items. The describes his craftsmanship as high-quality and a model for later generations.

===Development of paper===

In 105, Cai publicly declared that he had invented a new composition for paper with a new papermaking process. Writing had a long history in China with writing surfaces being bamboo and wooden slips (wood for short text and bamboo for lengthy text). These media were inconvenient as they were awkward to store, heavy, and difficult to write on. After Meng Tian purportedly created an animal-hair brush for writing in 3rd-century BCE, silk and cloth became alternatives that addressed these issues, but they were too expensive for widespread use. The absence of a practical solution motivated continued experimentation with different materials; Cai&#x27;s pulp solution proved the most effective. His process still used bamboo, but also introduced hemp waste, old rags, fishnets, and most importantly, bark from trees (likely mulberry). The materials were boiled to a pulp that was beaten with a wood or stone mallet before being mixed with a large amount of water. The resulting mixture was then processed with wooden sieves and the excess water removed, leaving the paper finished once dry. The paper that resulted from this method is often referred to as &quot;Cai Hou paper&quot; (). This event and its context are relayed in an often cited passage of the :
Many legends about the inspiration for Cai&#x27;s invention exist; one of the most popular said that Cai was inspired by watching paper wasps make their nests. Tsien suggested that Cai was inspired by the people of his birthplace, who used bark from mulberry trees to create cloth as a writing surface. Irrespective of its origin, in 105 CE, Cai&#x27;s new papermaking process both impressed He and earned him fame throughout the empire.

===Final years and death===
After the infant Emperor Shang&#x27;s eight-month reign, in 106 CE Emperor He was succeeded by 13-year-old Emperor An, while Lady Deng ruled as empress dowager. Both Cai and Zheng maintained influence in Deng&#x27;s court. In 110 CE, Deng assembled more than 100 scholars—including , and Ma Rong—in the Eastern Pavilion of the palace to begin creating a definitive edition of the Five Classics. She appointed Cai to oversee and supervise the production; de Crespigny said that this meant Cai &quot;was seriously concerned with scholarship&quot;. In 114 CE, he was awarded the title of &quot;marquis&quot; and the imperial court enfeoffed him as the lord of , a small village of 300 families in modern-day Yang County, Shaanxi. Later that year Zheng died and Cai succeeded him as the head of the Dowager&#x27;s household.

An assumed power after Deng&#x27;s death in 121 CE, though the court was dominated by the influence of Empress Yan Ji and her brothers. Remembering Cai&#x27;s part in the death of his grandmother, Consort Song, An ordered Cai to report to the Ministry of Justice to answer the charges, and presumably sentence him to death. Ashamed that the Emperor would send him to death in a dishonorable way, Cai bathed and dressed in formal clothes before killing himself by drinking poison.

===Global influence===
====Historical assessment====
Due to modern archeological investigations, it is now certain that different forms of paper existed in China as early as 3rd-century BCE, though the findings do not necessarily discount the credit given to Cai. The Chinese scholar Tsien Tsuen-hsuin explained that the term used in Cai&#x27;s ancient biography, &quot;zào yì&quot; (), can be understood as &quot;to initiate the idea&quot;, meaning that he furthered the ongoing process with the addition of important materials. Additionally, Cai is responsible for the earliest known use of tree bark and hemp as ingredients for paper, and it is clear that paper did not see widespread use in China until Cai&#x27;s improvements. As such, scholars have revised his contributions as ones that furthered an ongoing process instead of a sudden discovery. However, due to the pivotal significance of his improvements and the resulting spread of paper use throughout China, Cai continues to be traditionally credited with inventing paper. There is also speculation that Cai was the patron of this achievement and took credit from someone else, as Feng Dao may have done with his improvements to printing.

====Spread of paper====

Cai&#x27;s improvements to paper and the papermaking process are considered especially impactful to human history, as they resulted in the spread of literature and knowledge around the world, and advancements in communications. However, Cai is only somewhat known outside East Asia and is often excluded from major encyclopedias. The scholar of paper history, Thomas Francis Carter, drew parallels between Cai and Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of the first printing press which was movable type, calling them &quot;spiritual father and son&quot; respectively. In his 1978 book, &quot;The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History&quot;, Michael H. Hart ranked him 7th, above figures such as Gutenberg, Christopher Columbus, Albert Einstein and Charles Darwin. In 2007, &quot;Time&quot; ranked him among the &quot;Best Inventors&quot; of all time.

After Cai&#x27;s efforts in 105 CE, a renowned paper maker who may have been an apprentice to Cai—variously recorded by modern sources as Zuo Bo; Tso Po (, courtesy name: Tzu-i: ) from Donglai, Shandong; or Tso Tzǔ-yi—improved the process in 150 CE or later in the Han dynasty. Other than this, the basic principles of Cai&#x27;s papermaking process have changed little over time, and the new form of paper spread throughout China. According to legend, the Buddhist monk Damjing brought the process to Japan, though this is unconfirmed. Damjing occupies a similar patron saint position in Japan that Cai does in China. By the 600s the process appeared in Turkestan, Korea, and India, while Chinese prisoners from the Battle of Talas spread the knowledge to Arabs in the Abbasid Caliphate. Unlike many Chinese inventions that were created independently in Western Europe, the modern papermaking process was a wholly Chinese product and gradually spread via the Arabs to Europe, where it also saw widespread manufacturing by the 12th century. On 2 August 2010, the International Astronomical Union honored Cai&#x27;s legacy by naming a crater on the Moon after him.

===Influence in China===
====Folklore====

While Cai&#x27;s personal life is mostly unknown, a popular folktale suggests he was a shopkeeper and trickster with a wife and brother, though there is no historical confirmation for this. The story goes that after Cai&#x27;s improvements to paper there was little demand for the product so he had an ever-growing surplus. As such, Cai and his wife developed a ploy to increase sales; they told townsfolk that paper becomes money in the afterlife when burned.

In the most popular variation to the tale, Cai Mo and Hui Niang—Cai&#x27;s brother and sister-in-law of unconfirmed historicity—take the place of Cai and his wife. In this version, Hui convinced Cai Mo to learn the new papermaking trade from his younger brother, and when he returned in only three months, the paper he and his wife produced was too low quality to sell. To address this, Hui pretended to have died, and Cai Mo stood beside her coffin, wailing and burning money as tribute. Then, their neighbors checked in on them, and Hui sprung out of the coffin, explaining that the burned money was transferred to her in the afterlife, with which she paid ghosts to return her from the dead. Believing the story, the neighbors quickly purchased large amounts of paper for their own use. While mostly a fictitious story, intense wailing and burning offerings are commonplace in Chinese culture.

====Deification and remembrance====
Of those who originated China&#x27;s Four Great Inventions of the ancient world—the compass, gunpowder, papermaking and printing—only the inventor of papermaking, Cai Lun, is known. Additionally, in comparison to other Chinese inventions such as the writing brush and ink, the development of paper is the best documented in literary sources.

After his death in 121 CE, a shrine with his grave was built in his hometown, but was soon neglected and damaged by floods while his name was largely forgotten. During the early Tang dynasty, many national heroes were deified, such as Li Bai and Guan Yu as the gods of wine and war respectively. Cai was among the important people declared gods, and was deified as the national god of papermaking. Cai also became a patron saint for papermakers, with his image often being painted or printed onto paper mills and paper shops in not only China, but also Japan. In 1267, a man named Chen Tsunghsi raised funds to repair the long-damaged shrine, and renovated it to include a statue of Cai and a mausoleum. Chen stated that &quot;Tsai Lung&#x27;s [Cai Lun&#x27;s] extraordinary talent and his achievement are exemplary to all ages.&quot; A stone mortar, which legends claim Cai used to make paper, may have been brought to the mausoleum, although other sources say it was brought to the Imperial Museum in the capital of Lin&#x27;an. A great ceremony was held for the new mausoleum, though it fell into ruin again and was restored in 1955. Today, the temple still stands in Leiyang as the near a pool, renamed the &quot;Cai Lun Pool&quot;, that was thought to be near Cai&#x27;s home. In the Song dynasty, Fei Chu () said there was a temple in Chengdu where hundreds of families in the papermaking business would come to worship Cai.
During the late Qing dynasty, papermakers created religious groups, known as either &quot;spirit-money associations&quot; () or &quot;Cai Lun associations&quot; (). In 1839, the from the town of Yingjiang was sued by in Macun and Zhongxing of Jiajiang County, Sichuan. The conflict began when the of Yingjiang claimed that their statue of Cai—which they carried throughout Jiajiang County annually—gave them ritual supremacy over Macun and Zhongxing papermakers, whom they demanded pay for and take part in their celebrations. The from Macun and Zhongxing denied the demand, citing their long history of worshipping Cai, which resulted in increasing conflict between the sides and eventually a lawsuit. The county magistrate reproached both parties for descending into conflict and said: &quot;Did they not understand that all of them owed their livelihood to Lord Cai, who had taught them the art of papermaking? Were they not all disciples of Lord Cai, who wanted them to share the benefits of the trade?&quot;

In the 21st century, Leiyang is still famous as Cai&#x27;s birthplace and has active paper production. His traditional tomb lays in the Cai Lun Paper Culture Museum of Longting, Hanzhong, Shaanxi Province. In modern-day China, Cai&#x27;s name is closely associated with paper, and is the namesake of at least five roads: Cailun Road, Pudong, Shanghai; Cailun Road, Minhang District, Shanghai; Cailun Road, Fuyang District, Hangzhou, Zhejiang; Cailun Road East Crossing, Weiyang District, Xi&#x27;an; and Cailun Road, Yaohai District, Hefei, Anhui.

<text>Air New Zealand Limited is the flag carrier of New Zealand. Based in Auckland, the airline operates scheduled passenger flights to 20 domestic and 28 international destinations in 18 countries, primarily within the Pacific Rim. The airline has been a member of the Star Alliance since 1999.

Air New Zealand succeeded Tasman Empire Airways Limited (TEAL) on 1 April 1965. The airline served only international routes until 1978, when the government merged it and the domestic New Zealand National Airways Corporation (NAC) into a single airline under the Air New Zealand name. Air New Zealand was privatised in 1989, but returned to majority government ownership in 2001 after nearing bankruptcy due to a failed tie-up with Australian carrier Ansett Australia. In the 2017 financial year to June, Air New Zealand carried 15.95 million passengers.

Air New Zealand&#x27;s route network focuses on Australasia and the South Pacific, with long-haul flight services to eastern Asia and North America. It was the last airline to circumnavigate the world with flights to London Heathrow via Los Angeles and Hong Kong. The Hong Kong stopover was discontinued in March 2013 when Air New Zealand stopped Hong Kong–London flights in favour of a codeshare agreement with Cathay Pacific. Flights to London Heathrow by the airline stopped altogether in 2020 due to heavy competition and a lack of demand. The airline&#x27;s main hub is Auckland Airport, located near Māngere in the southern part of the Auckland urban area. Air New Zealand is headquartered in a building called &quot;The Hub&quot;, located from Auckland Airport, in Auckland&#x27;s Wynyard Quarter.

Air New Zealand currently operates a mixed fleet consisting of the Airbus A320, Airbus A320neo family, Boeing 777, and Boeing 787 jet aircraft, as well as a regional fleet consisting of ATR 72 and Bombardier Q300 turboprop aircraft. Air New Zealand was awarded Airline of the Year in 2010 and 2012 by the &quot;Air Transport World&quot; Global Airline Awards. In 2014, Air New Zealand was ranked the safest airline in the world by JACDEC.

==History==

On 1 April 1965, Tasman Empire Airways Limited was rebranded as Air New Zealand.

With the increased range of the Douglas DC-8s the airline&#x27;s first jet aircraft, Air New Zealand began transpacific services to the United States and Asia with Los Angeles and Honolulu added as destinations in 1965. The airline further acquired wide-body McDonnell Douglas DC-10 airliners in 1973. The DC-10s introduced the new koru-inspired logo for the airline, which remains to this day.

In 1978, the domestic airline National Airways Corporation (NAC) and its subsidiary Safe Air were merged into Air New Zealand to form a single national airline, further expanding the carrier&#x27;s operations. As a result, NAC&#x27;s Boeing 737 and Fokker F27 aircraft joined Air New Zealand&#x27;s fleet alongside its DC-8 and DC-10 airliners. The merger also resulted in the airline having two IATA airline designators: TE from Air New Zealand and NZ from NAC. TE continued to be used for international flights and NZ for domestic flights until 1990, when international flights assumed the NZ code.
In 1981, Air New Zealand introduced its first Boeing 747 airliner, and a year later initiated service to London via Los Angeles. The five 747-200s owned by Air New Zealand were all named after ancestral Māori canoes. 1985 saw the introduction of Boeing 767-200ER airliners to fill the large size gap between the Boeing 737 and 747 (the DC-8 and DC-10 had been withdrawn by 1983). In 1989 the airline was privatised with a sale to a consortium headed by Brierley Investments. (with remaining stakes held by Qantas, Japan Airlines, American Airlines, and the New Zealand government). The New Zealand air transport market underwent deregulation in 1990, prompting Air New Zealand to acquire a 50% stake in Ansett Australia in 1995.

In March 1999, Air New Zealand became a member of the Star Alliance. From 1999 through 2000, Air New Zealand became embroiled in an ownership battle over Ansett with co-owner News Limited over a possible sale of the under-performing carrier to Singapore Airlines.

===Merger with Ansett===
In 2000, Air New Zealand announced that it had chosen instead to acquire the entirety of Ansett Transport Industries (increasing its 50% stake in the carrier to 100%) for A$680 million from News Corporation in an attempt to break into the Australian aviation market. Business commentators believe this to have been a critical mistake, as Ansett&#x27;s fleet, staffing levels and infrastructure far outweighed that of Air New Zealand. Subsequently, both carriers&#x27; profitability came under question, and foreign offers to purchase the Air New Zealand Group were considered. In September 2001, plagued by costs it could not possibly afford, the Air New Zealand / Ansett Group neared collapse. A failed attempt at purchasing Virgin Blue was the final straw, and on 12 September, out of both time and cash, Air New Zealand placed Ansett Australia into voluntary administration, following which Ansett was forced to cease operations. Air New Zealand announced a NZ$1.425 billion operating loss. Air New Zealand was subsequently bailed out by the New Zealand Government, with Helen Clark&#x27;s Labour Government taking an 82% stake in the company.

===21st century===

In October 2001, Air New Zealand was re-nationalised under a New Zealand government NZ$885 million rescue plan (with the government taking an 82% stake), and subsequently received new leadership. This act was the only thing that spared Air New Zealand from going into administration and likely grounding.

In 2002, Air New Zealand reconfigured its domestic operations under a low-cost airline business plan, and the New Zealand government refused a proposal from Qantas to purchase a one-fifth stake in the carrier. Air New Zealand returned to profitability in 2003, reporting a net profit of $NZ165.7 million for that year. The carrier saw increasing profits through 2004 and 2005. In 2004, the airline announced a relaunch of its long-haul product, featuring the introduction of new seats in its business, premium economy, and economy class cabins.

In 2003, Air New Zealand added the Airbus A320 to its fleet for use on short-haul international flights, and later domestic flights. In 2005, the airline received its first Boeing 777 (-200ER variant) aircraft and placed orders for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner in 2004. The airline was later announced as the launch customer for the −9 variant of the 787.

On 21 December 2010, the New Zealand government approved an alliance between Air New Zealand and Australian airline Virgin Blue (now named Virgin Australia), which allowed both airlines to expand their operations between Australia and New Zealand with codeshares for trans-Tasman and connecting domestic flights, and reciprocal access to frequent flyer programmes and airport lounges. Air New Zealand subsequently purchased a 26% shareholding in Virgin Australia Holdings to cement the relationship. By October 2016 Air New Zealand sold its remaining stake in Virgin Australia to investors and the Nasham Group. On 4 April 2018, Air New Zealand ended its partnership with Virgin Australia which went into effect from 28 October 2018.

In 2011, Air New Zealand introduced the Boeing 777-300ER to its fleet, as well as the Economy Skycouch, a set of three economy class seats that could be converted into a flat surface by raising the leg rests. After a four-year delay, Air New Zealand took delivery of its first Boeing 787-9 on 9 July 2014. The airline retired its final Boeing 747 in September 2014, its last Boeing 737 in September 2015, and its last Boeing 767 in March 2017, leaving it with a simplified fleet of Airbus A320 aircraft for short-haul operations and Boeing 777 and 787 aircraft for long-haul operations.

In November 2013, the New Zealand Government reduced its share in Air New Zealand from 73% to 53% as part of its controversial asset sales programme. It made $365 million from the deal.

In October 2019, the airline announced it would discontinue its Los Angeles to London route in October 2020 while launching a new non-stop route from Auckland to New York. In March 2020 Air New Zealand sold its London Heathrow slots for USD $27 million (approximately NZD $42 million). The 10:50 arrival and 15:20 departure slots were taken over by United Airlines. The London route was prematurely cancelled in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while the launch of the New York route was rescheduled, with the first flight taking place on 17 September 2022. 

Air New Zealand announced a major refurbishment of its existing cabins in June 2022, with new cabins including a new product named &quot;The Skynest&quot; to be introduced in the new Boeing 787-9 and 787-10 aircraft which are set to be delivered in 2024.

In November 2024, Air New Zealand indicated it was &quot;exploring options&quot; for a possible return to London. Following a rejection for slots at Heathrow, the airline was granted daily slots at London Gatwick Airport for summer 2025.

==Corporate affairs and identity==

===Head office===
The Air New Zealand head office, &quot;The Hub&quot;, is a office park located at the corner of Beaumont and Fanshawe streets in Wynyard Quarter, Auckland. The office includes two connected six-level buildings. The facility consists of a lot of glass to allow sunlight and therefore reduce electricity consumption. The building does not have cubicle walls. Sensors throughout the building can turn on lights if they detect human activity, and turn off lights if human activity is not detected for 15 minutes. The buildings cost $60 million New Zealand dollars to build and develop. From late September to early October 2006 the airline moved 1,000 employees from four buildings in the Auckland CBD and other buildings elsewhere.

The company previously had its head office in the Quay Tower in the CBD. In its history the airline had its head office in Airways House on Customs Street East.

The company also occupies premises at the Smales Farm Business Park in Takapuna on the North Shore, adjacent to the bus station and Northern motorway. It is home to the Contact Centre staff (additional to those at &#x27;The Hub&#x27;), Tandem Travel and other services.

===Subsidiaries===
====Operations subsidiaries====
Air New Zealand Cargo is the only current subsidiary of Air New Zealand Limited.

Air New Zealand previously had wholly owned subsidiary regional airlines – Air Nelson, Mount Cook Airline and Eagle Airways – that served regional destinations throughout New Zealand. Together they made up Air New Zealand Link. On 26 August 2016, Eagle Airways ceased operations – Air Nelson and Mount Cook Airline followed in late 2019 and both were merged into its parent&#x27;s operations.

* Air Nelson was based in Nelson, and operated Bombardier Q300s.
* Mount Cook Airline was based in Christchurch, and operated ATR 72–500 and ATR 72–600 turboprop aircraft.

Subsidiary company Zeal320 was introduced to help combat increasing labour costs. Zeal320 operated Air New Zealand&#x27;s trans-Tasman fleet of Airbus A320-200 aircraft under the Air New Zealand brand. On 31 July 2006, flights were re-numbered to the NZ700-999 series for trans-Tasman services, and NZ1000 series for domestic services. All of Air New Zealand&#x27;s A320-200s were registered to Zeal320 until 26 November 2008, when ownership of the fleet was transferred back to Air New Zealand. However, staff that worked the A320-200 fleet were still employed by the subsidiary. This was a source of contention within the airline group in which these employees were paid at a lower scale than their mainline counterparts. Continued industrial action by staff employed in the subsidiary during 2009 permanently delayed a proposed low-cost carrier airline as a successor to Freedom Air that would have also employed the Airbus A320 on domestic routes to counter Jetstar, which had begun operating domestically in New Zealand. In 2015 Zeal320 was removed from the New Zealand Companies Office.

====Technical subsidiaries====
The following are technical operations subsidiaries of Air New Zealand:

* Air New Zealand Engineering Services
* Christchurch Engine Centre (50%)

In June 2015, Air New Zealand confirmed the sale of its Safe Air engineering subsidiary to the Australian arm of Airbus.

===Sponsorships===
Air New Zealand was the title sponsor of the Air New Zealand Cup domestic rugby union club competition through the 2009 season. The airline remains a major sponsor of New Zealand rugby, including the New Zealand national rugby union team, known as the All Blacks. The airline also sponsors the Air New Zealand Wine Awards and World of Wearable Arts; and partners with New Zealand&#x27;s Department of Conservation and Antarctica New Zealand.

===Brand and livery===
The Air New Zealand symbol is a Māori koru, a stylised representation of a silver fern frond unfolding. A redesigned logo was unveiled on 21 March 2006. The &quot;Pacific Wave&quot; fuselage stripes were removed from short-haul aircraft in 2009, simplifying the overall livery, and was in the process of also being removed from long haul aircraft before the logo was changed again.

On 27 March 2006, Air New Zealand revealed a new brand identity, involving a new Zambesi-designed uniform, new logo, new colour scheme and new look check-in counters and lounges. The new uniforms featured a colour palette mirroring the greenstone, teal, schist and slate hues of New Zealand&#x27;s sea and sky. Uniform fabric was woven from merino wool and incorporated curves inspired by the airline&#x27;s logo symbol, the koru. A greenstone colour replaces the blue Pacific Wave colour, inspired by the colour of the pounamu, the prized gemstone found in New Zealand. The Air New Zealand Koru was woven through all Air New Zealand&#x27;s signage and products.

Later in 2009 staff were involved in testing fabrics and cuts of uniforms. &quot;&#x27;It would be fair to say that the lessons from the development and introduction of the current uniform have been taken on board,&quot; said the airline&#x27;s CEO after widespread public and staff criticism.

A rebranding was announced in July 2012. Dropping the teal and green colours that had represented the airline since its beginnings as Tasman Empire Airways (TEAL) in 1939, black was adopted as the brand colour in a joint effort between the airline, New Zealand design agency Designworks and renowned Kiwi typographer Kris Sowersby, who also introduced a new logo typeface. The tails of the aircraft and the typeface changed to black, while the rest of the fuselage remained white.

Then CEO Rob Fyfe said of the rebranding: &quot;Black has resonated well with our customers and staff who identify with it as the colour of New Zealand and a natural choice for our national airline. It inspires pride, is part of our Kiwi identity and a symbol of Kiwi success on the world stage.&quot; The airline began using black as its corporate colour ahead of a sponsorship campaign with NZ&#x27;s rugby union team, the All Blacks, in 2011.

Another new livery was announced on 12 June 2013. In conjunction with a NZ$20 million Memorandum of Understanding with the national tourism agency Tourism New Zealand for joint marketing, TNZ granted permission for Air New Zealand to use the &quot;New Zealand Fern Mark&quot;, a standard fern logo used and managed by Tourism NZ and NZ Trade and Enterprise for international promotion, in its livery.

Two new liveries were unveiled. The first is predominantly white with a black strip running downwards on the rear fuselage from the tail, adorned with a koru logo in white, to disappear downwards just aft of the junction of the wings with the fuselage. The black and white fern mark adorns the fuselage. This livery is used on most of the fleet. A select number have an all black livery with the fern in silver, including the airline&#x27;s first Boeing 787–9. Extensive consumer surveys by Air New Zealand revealed 78 percent people believed the Fern Mark fits with the airline&#x27;s brand and represents New Zealand. The first aircraft to be painted in this livery was rolled out on 24 September 2013.
====Special liveries====

* In 1973, the first of the airline&#x27;s McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30s arrived with 1974 British Commonwealth Games &quot;NZ74&quot; logo on both sides of the forward fuselage beneath the cabin windows.
* In 1984, pictures of the Buckingham Palace horse guards with &#x27;London, Here We Come&#x27; were placed on the side of the hump of the airline&#x27;s new Boeing 747-200Bs when Air New Zealand was allowed to fly the Los Angeles – London leg of the trans-Pacific route in its own name.
* A special livery featuring an image of the All Blacks front row of Carl Hoeft, Anton Oliver and Kees Meeuws and a black tail was used on the Boeing 747–400 aircraft used to transport the team to the 1999 Rugby World Cup. Two other aircraft wore the special All Blacks scheme: a Boeing 737-200QC and a Saab 340 of Air Nelson; both these aircraft retained their blue teal tail colours.
* In 1999, one Boeing 737–300 was painted in a &#x27;New Millennium&#x27; livery depicting celebrations and the America&#x27;s Cup regatta that was to be held in 2000.
* In 2002 and 2003 Air New Zealand marked its position as &quot;the official airline to Middle Earth&quot; by decorating three aircraft with &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; imagery, applied as giant decals. The decal material was described in airline publicity as being as thin as clingfilm and weighing more than . The imagery featured actors from the film trilogy &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; against backdrops of New Zealand locations used in the films.
* In 2008, one of the airline&#x27;s Boeing 737-300s was painted into a lime green Air New Zealand &#x27;Holidays&#x27; livery.
* During 2011 and 2012, two aircraft – an Airbus A320 and a Boeing 777-300ER – were painted in an All Blacks-inspired livery. The aircraft were completely black, with a silver fern motif covering the aft section of the fuselage. Some Air New Zealand Link aircraft were also decorated in the scheme: an ATR 72–600 operated by Mount Cook Airline; and two Beechcraft 1900Ds operated by now-defunct subsidiary Eagle Airways.
* In November 2012, Boeing 777-300ER ZK-OKP was repainted in the new &quot;black-tail&quot; livery and fitted with an decal promoting the premiere and release of the first film in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; trilogy. The decal took six days and 400-man-hours to install.
*In December 2013, ahead of the premiere of the second part of the Hobbit trilogy, &quot;The Desolation of Smaug&quot;, Air New Zealand applied two 54-metre-long images of the dragon Smaug on the sides of a Boeing 777-300ER.
*In October 2023, Air New Zealand leased ex Cathay Pacific Boeing 777-367ER ZK-OKU (ex B-KPJ) on a three year lease from Air Lease Corporation. The airliner painted all white, features a black koru logo design, compared to the normal white.

==Services==

=== Cabins ===
Air New Zealand offers three classes on its wide-body Boeing 777 and 787 jets: business, premium economy, and economy. The airline operates a single-class economy cabin on its narrow-body Airbus A320/A321 jets and its turboprops.

=== In-flight Wi-Fi ===
Since October 2017, the airline began gradually implementing complimentary in-flight Wi-Fi service on its aircraft. In February 2024, the airline announced the introduction of free Wi-Fi on board service via Starlink satellite Internet across all its routes. This service is expected to be implemented in 2025.

===Air New Zealand Lounge===

The Air New Zealand Lounge is Air New Zealand&#x27;s network of airline lounges around the world. Eligible Air New Zealand frequent flyer members, including Koru members and their guests, may access the lounges.

===Airpoints===
Airpoints is Air New Zealand&#x27;s frequent-flyer programme. Members earn &quot;Airpoints Dollars&quot;, which they can redeem at par with New Zealand dollars on any fare for flights ticketed and operated by Air New Zealand. Members can attain status tiers, with increasing privileges ranging from Silver to Gold, then Gold Elite, by accumulating their &quot;Status Points&quot;, which are earned separately from Airpoints Dollars. Airpoints Gold and Airpoints Gold Elite have the same recognition as Star Alliance Gold status and benefits across the Star Alliance network. Airpoints Silver status is equivalent to Star Alliance Silver.

Airpoints members receive Status Points for almost every Air New Zealand flight, as well as for many other flights with its Star Alliance partners. Status Points enable members to reach a higher status faster.

==Incidents and accidents==

As of November 2022 Air New Zealand has had four hull losses and two hijackings. The airline&#x27;s worst accident, and only accident with passenger fatalities, was Flight 901 on 28 November 1979, which crashed into Mount Erebus on a sightseeing flight over Antarctica, killing all 257 on board.

==Controversies==
===Outsourcing maintenance===
On 19 October 2005, Air New Zealand proposed outsourcing most of its heavy maintenance on its long-haul aircraft and engines, which would result in about 600 job losses, mostly in Auckland. Air New Zealand said that there were larger maintenance providers that could provide maintenance work more cheaply due to their large scale. The proposal was estimated to save $48 million over five years and came after many attempts to attract contracts to service other airlines&#x27; longhaul aircraft.

Eventually, a union proposal to save some of the remaining jobs was accepted. The proposal included shift and pay changes (most of them pay cuts) which would allow about 300 engineers in Auckland to keep their jobs. 200 were made redundant or resigned.

===Minor seating policy===

In November 2005, it was revealed that Air New Zealand (along with Qantas and British Airways) had a policy of not seating adult male passengers next to unaccompanied children. The policy came to light following an incident in 2004 when a man who was seated next to a young boy on a Qantas flight in New Zealand was asked to change seats with a female passenger. A steward informed him that &quot;it was the airline&#x27;s policy that only women were allowed to sit next to unaccompanied children&quot;. Air New Zealand later said it had a similar policy to Qantas.

===Qantas code-share===
On 12 April 2006, Air New Zealand and Qantas announced that they had signed a code-share agreement for their trans-Tasman routes and would file for authorisation from the New Zealand Ministry of Transport and the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC). The airlines maintained that they were making losses on Tasman routes due to too many empty seats, and that a codeshare would return the routes to profitability. Critics, particularly Wellington, Christchurch and Melbourne Airports, argued that the codeshare flights would lead to reduced passenger choice and higher airfares, and that airports such as Auckland and Sydney would benefit immensely through economic activity services would bring.

On 15 November 2006 Air New Zealand announced it was withdrawing its application after a draft decision by the ACCC to not approve the code-sharing agreement.

On 31 May 2018 Qantas and Air New Zealand announced that &quot;seamless air travel&quot; would be available to their customers through a new code-sharing agreement. The code-share took effect in October 2018.

===Aiding Saudi military===

In February 2021, it was reported that Air New Zealand&#x27;s business unit Gas Turbines had repaired two engines and one power turbine module from vessels belonging to the Royal Saudi Navy. Green Party human rights spokesperson Golriz Ghahraman accused Air New Zealand for being an accomplice to the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern subsequently ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade to conduct an investigation into Air New Zealand&#x27;s involvement. The airline reportedly ceased all contractual support to the Saudi military after the matter was made public.

==Alternative propulsion and emissions of greenhouse gases==
In a 2008 effort to develop an aviation biofuel, Air New Zealand and Boeing researched the jatropha plant to see if it was a viable green alternative to conventional fuel. A two-hour test flight, using a 50–50 mixture of the new biofuel with Jet A-1 feeding a Rolls-Royce RB211 engine of one of the airline&#x27;s 747-400s, was completed on 30 December 2008. The engine was then removed to be scrutinised and studied to identify any differences between the jatropha blend and regular Jet A1. No effects to performances were found. The use of jatropha has been identified as a possible future fuel but large tracts of low quality land needed to grow the plant would have to be found without impeding other agricultural uses.
In 2022, Air New Zealand adopted a 2030 target to cut its emissions by almost 29%.
In July 2024, Air NZ had announced the withdrawal of its 2030 climate target and that it would also withdraw from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The Spinoff website reported that this raises serious credibility questions for Air New Zealand.

== Awards ==
In 2020, Air New Zealand was named &quot;Best Airline&quot; in the Airline Excellence Awards 2020 carried out by AirlineRatings.com.

In 2023, Air New Zealand was named AirlineRatings.com&#x27;s Airline of the Year for 2023.

== Baggage tracker policy ==

Although Air New Zealand and fellow Star Alliance member Lufthansa briefly banned baggage trackers in 2022, those bans and advisories were reversed in 2023.

<doc id="140962" wikidata="Q2731294" url="?curid=140962" title="Mighty Blackpool F.C.">
<text>Mighty Blackpool is a Sierra Leonean football club based in the capital Freetown. They play in the Sierra Leone National Premier League, the top football league in the country. Blackpool represents the West End of Freetown and their home games are played at the National Stadium in Freetown.

The club was founded in 1923 under the name Socro United and they are the oldest and most successful football club in Sierra Leone, having won the Premier League fifteen times and the FA Cup four times. They changed their name to Mighty Blackpool in 1954 to show their admiration for the former Blackpool and England player Sir Stanley Matthews.

Mighty Blackpool have an intense rivalry with city rivals East End Lions.

== History ==
Although Mighty Blackpool have won the league title fifteen times, the last time they were league champions was in the 2001 season after a dramatic finish to the season saw them finish one point ahead of Old Edwardians.

In 1989 Mighty Blackpool reached the quarter-final stages of the African Cup of Champions Clubs; the first time a club from Sierra Leone had reached that stage. In the first round they beat reigning champions ES Sétif from Algeria and on the second round beat Djoliba Athletic Club from Mali, before losing to Tonnerre Yaounde from Cameroon in the quarter finals.

In the 2007 league campaign, a 2–0 win over Golf Leopards on 15 July meant that Blackpool were on 24 points from 12 games.

Mighty Blackpool&#x27;s record in the African Cup of Champions Clubs has mostly seen them eliminated in the early rounds. In 1968 they were due to play Congolese club, Étoile du Congo in the preliminary round but withdrew from the competition before the matches were played handing Étoile du Congo a walkover, and in 1975 they lost 3–0 on aggregate to Djoliba Athletic Club of Mali in the first round. In 1979 they again lost in the first round, drawing 4–4 with Accra Hearts of Oak SC of Ghana on aggregate but losing out on penalties 4–2. And in 1980 they lost to ASF Police of Senegal 4–1 on aggregate in the first round.

In 1989 they reached the Quarterfinal stage of the African Cup of Champions Clubs. In the preliminary round they had a walkover, when Benfica withdrew from the competition. In the first round they beat Algerian club ES Sétif 5–3 on penalties after the two matches ended all square at 1–1. In the second round they met Djoliba Athletic Club again, this time winning 2–1 on aggregate. They went out of the competition in the Quarter Final stage losing 4–1 to Cameroon club, Tonnerre Yaoundé. In 1992 they were again eliminated in the first round, this time by Canon Yaoundé of Cameroon after beating LPRC Oilers of Liberia in the preliminary round.

In 2006 they played in the CAF Confederation Cup, losing to CSS Richard-Toll of Senegal in the preliminary round

<doc id="140968" wikidata="Q164778" url="?curid=140968" title="Rotavirus">
<text>Rotaviruses are the most common cause of diarrhoeal disease among infants and young children. Nearly every child in the world is infected with a rotavirus at least once by the age of five. Immunity develops with each infection, so subsequent infections are less severe. Adults are rarely affected. &quot;Rotavirus&quot; is a genus of double-stranded RNA viruses in the family &quot;Reoviridae&quot;. There are nine species of the genus, referred to as A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I and J. &quot;Rotavirus A&quot; is the most common species, and these rotaviruses cause more than 90% of rotavirus infections in humans.

The virus is transmitted by the faecal–oral route. It infects and damages the cells that line the small intestine and causes gastroenteritis (which is often called &quot;stomach flu&quot; despite having no relation to influenza). Although rotavirus was discovered in 1973 by Ruth Bishop and her colleagues by electron micrograph images and accounts for approximately one third of hospitalisations for severe diarrhoea in infants and children, its importance has historically been underestimated within the public health community, particularly in developing countries. In addition to its impact on human health, rotavirus also infects other animals, and is a pathogen of livestock.

Rotaviral enteritis is usually an easily managed disease of childhood, but among children under 5 years of age rotavirus caused an estimated 151,714 deaths from diarrhoea in 2019. In the United States, before initiation of the rotavirus vaccination programme in the 2000s, rotavirus caused about 2.7million cases of severe gastroenteritis in children, almost 60,000 hospitalisations, and around 37 deaths each year. Following rotavirus vaccine introduction in the United States, hospitalisation rates have fallen significantly. Public health campaigns to combat rotavirus focus on providing oral rehydration therapy for infected children and vaccination to prevent the disease. The incidence and severity of rotavirus infections has declined significantly in countries that have added rotavirus vaccine to their routine childhood immunisation policies.
== Virology ==

=== Types of rotavirus ===
There are nine species of rotavirus (sometimes informally called &quot;groups&quot;) referred to as A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I and J. Humans are primarily infected by rotaviruses in the species &quot;Rotavirus A&quot;. A–I species cause disease in other animals, species H in pigs, D, F and G in birds, I in cats and J in bats.

Within group A rotaviruses there are different strains, called serotypes. As with influenza virus, a dual classification system is used based on two proteins on the surface of the virus. The glycoprotein VP7 defines the G serotypes and the protease-sensitive protein VP4 defines P serotypes. Because the two genes that determine G-types and P-types can be passed on separately to progeny viruses, different combinations are found. A whole genome genotyping system has been established for group A rotaviruses, which has been used to determine the origin of atypical strains. The prevalence of the individual G-types and P-types varies between, and within, countries and years. There are at least 36 G types and 51 P types but in infections of humans only a few combinations of G and P types predominate. They are G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8], G9P[8] and G12P[8].

=== Structure ===
The genome of rotaviruses consists of 11 unique double helix molecules of RNA (dsRNA) which are 18,555 nucleotides in total. Each helix, or segment, is a gene, numbered 1 to 11 by decreasing size. Each gene codes for one protein, except genes 9, which codes for two. The RNA is surrounded by a three-layered icosahedral protein capsid. Viral particles are up to 76.5nm in diameter and are not enveloped.

=== Proteins ===

There are six viral proteins (VPs) that form the virus particle (virion). These &quot;structural&quot; proteins are called VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4, VP6 and VP7. In addition to the VPs, there are six &quot;nonstructural&quot; proteins (NSPs), that are only produced in cells infected by rotavirus. These are called NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP4, NSP5 and NSP6.

At least six of the twelve proteins encoded by the rotavirus genome bind RNA. The role of these proteins in rotavirus replication is not entirely understood; their functions are thought to be related to RNA synthesis and packaging in the virion, mRNA transport to the site of genome replication, and mRNA translation and regulation of gene expression.

==== Structural proteins ====
VP1 is located in the core of the virus particle and is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme. In an infected cell this enzyme produces mRNA transcripts for the synthesis of viral proteins and produces copies of the rotavirus genome RNA segments for newly produced virus particles.

VP2 forms the core layer of the virion and binds the RNA genome.

VP3 is part of the inner core of the virion and is an enzyme called guanylyl transferase. This is a capping enzyme that catalyses the formation of the 5&#x27; cap in the post-transcriptional modification of mRNA. The cap stabilises viral mRNA by protecting it from nucleic acid degrading enzymes called nucleases.

VP4 is on the surface of the virion that protrudes as a spike. It binds to molecules on the surface of cells called receptors and drives the entry of the virus into the cell. VP4 has to be modified by the protease enzyme trypsin, which is found in the gut, into VP5* and VP8* before the virus is infectious. VP4 determines how virulent the virus is and it determines the P-type of the virus. In humans there is an association between the blood group (Lewis antigen system, ABO blood group system and secretor status) and susceptibility to infection. Non-secretors seem resistant to infection by types P[4] and P[8], indicating that blood group antigens are the receptors for these genotypes. This resistance is dependent on the rotavirus genotype.

VP6 forms the bulk of the capsid. It is highly antigenic and can be used to identify rotavirus species. This protein is used in laboratory tests for rotavirus infections.

VP7 is a glycoprotein that forms the outer surface of the virion. Apart from its structural functions, it determines the G-type of the strain and, along with VP4, is involved in immunity to infection.

==== Nonstructural viral proteins ====
NSP1, the product of gene 5, is a nonstructural RNA-binding protein. NSP1 also blocks the interferon response, the part of the innate immune system that protects cells from viral infection. NSP1 causes the proteosome to degrade key signaling components required to stimulate production of interferon in an infected cell and to respond to interferon secreted by adjacent cells.

Targets for degradation include several IRF transcription factors required for interferon gene transcription.

NSP2 is an RNA-binding protein that accumulates in cytoplasmic inclusions (viroplasms) and is required for genome replication.

NSP3 is bound to viral mRNAs in infected cells and it is responsible for the shutdown of cellular protein synthesis. NSP3 inactivates two translation initiation factors essential for synthesis of proteins from host mRNA.

First, NSP3 ejects poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) from the translation initiation factor eIF4F. PABP is required for efficient translation of transcripts with a 3&#x27; poly(A) tail, which is found on most host cell transcripts. Second, NSP3 inactivates eIF2 by stimulating its phosphorylation. Efficient translation of rotavirus mRNA, which lacks the 3&#x27; poly(A) tail, does not require either of these factors.

NSP4 is a viral enterotoxin that induces diarrhoea and was the first viral enterotoxin discovered. It is a viroporin that elevates cytosolic Ca2+ in mammalian cells.

NSP5 is encoded by genome segment 11 of rotavirus A. In virus-infected cells NSP5 accumulates in the viroplasm.

NSP6 is a nucleic acid binding protein and is encoded by gene 11 from an out-of-phase open reading frame.
This table is based on the simian rotavirus strain SA11. RNA-protein coding assignments differ in some strains.

=== Replication ===
The attachment of the virus to the host cell is initiated by VP4, which attaches to molecules, called glycans, on the surface of the cell. The virus enters cells by receptor mediated endocytosis and form a vesicle known as an endosome. Proteins in the third layer (VP7 and the VP4 spike) disrupt the membrane of the endosome, creating a difference in the calcium concentration. This causes the breakdown of VP7 trimers into single protein subunits, leaving the VP2 and VP6 protein coats around the viral dsRNA, forming a double-layered particle (DLP).

The eleven dsRNA strands remain within the protection of the two protein shells and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase creates mRNA transcripts of the double-stranded viral genome. By remaining in the core, the viral RNA evades innate host immune responses including RNA interference that are triggered by the presence of double-stranded RNA.

During the infection, rotaviruses produce mRNA for both protein biosynthesis and gene replication. Most of the rotavirus proteins accumulate in viroplasm, where the RNA is replicated and the DLPs are assembled. In the viroplasm the positive sense viral RNAs that are used as templates for the synthesis of viral genomic dsRNA are protected from siRNA-induced RNase degradation. Viroplasm is formed around the cell nucleus as early as two hours after virus infection, and consists of viral factories thought to be made by two viral nonstructural proteins: NSP5 and NSP2. Inhibition of NSP5 by RNA interference &quot;in vitro&quot; results in a sharp decrease in rotavirus replication. The DLPs migrate to the endoplasmic reticulum where they obtain their third, outer layer (formed by VP7 and VP4). The progeny viruses are released from the cell by lysis.

== Transmission ==
Rotaviruses are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, via contact with contaminated hands, surfaces and objects, and possibly by the respiratory route. Viral diarrhoea is highly contagious. The faeces of an infected person can contain more than 10 trillion infectious particles per gram; fewer than 100 of these are required to transmit infection to another person.

Rotaviruses are stable in the environment and have been found in estuary samples at levels up to 1–5 infectious particles per USgallon. The viruses survive between 9 and 19 days. Sanitary measures adequate for eliminating bacteria and parasites seem to be ineffective in control of rotavirus, as the incidence of rotavirus infection in countries with high and low health standards is similar.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Rotaviral enteritis is a mild to severe disease characterised by nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhoea and low-grade fever. Once a child is infected by the virus, there is an incubation period of about two days before symptoms appear. The period of illness is acute. Symptoms often start with vomiting followed by four to eight days of profuse diarrhoea. Dehydration is more common in rotavirus infection than in most of those caused by bacterial pathogens, and is the most common cause of death related to rotavirus infection.

Rotavirus infections can occur throughout life: the first usually produces symptoms, but subsequent infections are typically mild or asymptomatic, as the immune system provides some protection. Consequently, symptomatic infection rates are highest in children under two years of age and decrease progressively towards 45 years of age. The most severe symptoms tend to occur in children six months to two years of age, the elderly, and those with immunodeficiency. Due to immunity acquired in childhood, most adults are not susceptible to rotavirus; gastroenteritis in adults usually has a cause other than rotavirus, but asymptomatic infections in adults may maintain the transmission of infection in the community. There is some evidence to suggest blood group can impact on the susceptibility to infection by rotaviruses.

== Disease mechanisms ==
Rotaviruses replicate mainly in the gut, and infect enterocytes of the villi of the small intestine, leading to structural and functional changes of the epithelium. There is evidence in humans, and particularly in animal models of extraintestinal dissemination of infectious virus to other organs and macrophages.

The diarrhoea is caused by multiple activities of the virus. Malabsorption occurs because of the destruction of gut cells called enterocytes. The toxic rotavirus protein NSP4 induces age- and calcium ion-dependent chloride secretion, disrupts SGLT1 (sodium/glucose cotransporter 2) transporter-mediated reabsorption of water, apparently reduces activity of brush-border membrane disaccharidases, and activates the calcium ion-dependent secretory reflexes of the enteric nervous system. The elevated concentrations of calcium ions in the cytosol (which are required for the assembly of the progeny viruses) is achieved by NSP4 acting as a viroporin. This increase in calcium ions leads to autophagy (self destruction) of the infected enterocytes.

NSP4 is also secreted. This extracellular form, which is modified by protease enzymes in the gut, is an enterotoxin which acts on uninfected cells via integrin receptors, which in turn cause and increase in intracellular calcium ion concentrations, secretory diarrhoea and autophagy.

The vomiting, which is a characteristic of rotaviral enteritis, is caused by the virus infecting the enterochromaffin cells on the lining of the digestive tract. The infection stimulates the production of 5&#x27; hydroxytryptamine (serotonin). This activates vagal afferent nerves, which in turn activates the cells of the brain stem that control the vomiting reflex.

Healthy enterocytes secrete lactase into the small intestine; milk intolerance due to lactase deficiency is a symptom of rotavirus infection, which can persist for weeks. A recurrence of mild diarrhoea often follows the reintroduction of milk into the child&#x27;s diet, due to bacterial fermentation of the disaccharide lactose in the gut.

== Immune responses ==
=== Specific responses ===
Rotaviruses elicit both B and T cell immune responses. Antibodies to the rotavirus VP4 and VP7 proteins neutralise viral infectivity &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot;. Specific antibodies of the classes IgM, IgA and IgG are produced, which have been shown to protect against rotavirus infection by the passive transfer of the antibodies in other animals. Maternal trans-placental IgG might play a role in the protection neonates from rotavirus infections, but on the other hand might reduce vaccine efficacy.

=== Innate responses ===
Following infection by rotaviruses there is a rapid innate immune response involving types I and III interferons and other cytokines (particularly Th1 and Th2) which inhibit the replication of the virus and recruit macrophages and natural killer cells to the rotavirus infected cells. The rotavirus dsRNA activates pattern recognition receptors such toll-like receptors that stimulate the production of interferons. The rotavirus protein NSP1 counteracts the effects of type 1 interferons by suppressing the activity of the interferon regulatory proteins IRF3, IRF5 and IRF7.

=== Markers of protection ===
The levels of IgG and IgA in the blood and IgA in the gut correlate with protection from infection. Rotavirus specific serum IgG and IgA at high titres (e.g. &gt;1:200) have been claimed to be protective and there is a significant correlation between IgA titres and rotavirus vaccine efficacy.

== Diagnosis and detection ==
Diagnosis of infection with a rotavirus normally follows diagnosis of gastroenteritis as the cause of severe diarrhoea. Most children admitted to hospital with gastroenteritis are tested for rotavirus.

Specific diagnosis of infection with rotavirus is made by finding the virus in the child&#x27;s stool by enzyme immunoassay. There are several licensed test kits on the market which are sensitive, specific and detect all serotypes of rotavirus. Other methods, such as electron microscopy and PCR (polymerase chain reaction), are used in research laboratories. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can detect and identify all species and serotypes of human rotaviruses.

== Treatment and prognosis ==
Treatment of acute rotavirus infection is nonspecific and involves management of symptoms and, most importantly, management of dehydration. If untreated, children can die from the resulting severe dehydration. Depending on the severity of diarrhoea, treatment consists of oral rehydration therapy, during which the child is given extra water to drink that contains specific amounts of salt and sugar. In 2004, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF recommended the use of low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution and zinc supplementation as a two-pronged treatment of acute diarrhoea. Some infections are serious enough to warrant hospitalisation where fluids are given by intravenous therapy or nasogastric intubation, and the child&#x27;s electrolytes and blood sugar are monitored. Rotavirus infections rarely cause other complications and for a well managed child the prognosis is excellent. Probiotics have been shown to reduce the duration of rotavirus diarrhoea, and according to the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology &quot;effective interventions include administration of specific probiotics such as &quot;Lactobacillus rhamnosus&quot; or &quot;Saccharomyces boulardii&quot;, diosmectite or racecadotril.&quot;

== Prevention ==

Rotaviruses are highly contagious and cannot be treated with antibiotics or other drugs. Because improved sanitation does not decrease the prevalence of rotaviral disease, and the rate of hospitalisations remains high despite the use of oral rehydrating medicines, the primary public health intervention is vaccination. In 1998, a rotavirus vaccine was licensed for use in the United States. Clinical trials in the United States, Finland, and Venezuela had found it to be 80–100% effective at preventing severe diarrhoea caused by &quot;rotavirus A&quot;, and researchers had detected no statistically significant serious adverse effects. The manufacturer, however, withdrew it from the market in 1999, after it was discovered that the vaccine may have contributed to an increased risk for intussusception, a type of bowel obstruction, in one of every 12,000 vaccinated infants. The experience provoked intense debate about the relative risks and benefits of a rotavirus vaccine.

In 2006, two new vaccines against &quot;&quot; infection were shown to be safe and effective in children, and in 2009, the WHO recommended that rotavirus vaccine be included in all national immunisation programmes.

The incidence and severity of rotavirus infections has declined significantly in countries that have acted on this recommendation. A 2014 review of available clinical trial data from countries routinely using rotavirus vaccines in their national immunisation programs found that rotavirus vaccines have reduced rotavirus hospitalisations by 49–92% and all cause diarrhoea hospitalisations by 17–55%. In Mexico, which in 2006 was among the first countries in the world to introduce rotavirus vaccine, diarrhoeal disease death rates dropped during the 2009 rotavirus season by more than 65 percent among children age two and under. In Nicaragua, which in 2006 became the first developing country to introduce a rotavirus vaccine, severe rotavirus infections were reduced by 40 percent and emergency room visits by a half. In the United States, rotavirus vaccination since 2006 has led to drops in rotavirus-related hospitalisations by as much as 86 percent. The vaccines may also have prevented illness in non-vaccinated children by limiting the number of circulating infections. In developing countries in Africa and Asia, where the majority of rotavirus deaths occur, a large number of safety and efficacy trials as well as recent post-introduction impact and effectiveness studies of Rotarix and RotaTeq have found that vaccines dramatically reduced severe disease among infants. In September 2013, the vaccine was offered to all children in the UK, aged between two and three months. A 2022 study found that the number of rotavirus cases in infants in England under one year of age was reduced by 77–88%. In all age groups, the number of laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infections was reduced by 69–83%. In Europe, hospitalisation rates following infection by rotaviruses have decreased by 65% to 84% following the introduction of the vaccine. Globally, vaccination has reduced hospital admissions and emergency department visits by a median of 67%.

Rotavirus vaccines are licensed in over 100 countries, and more than 80 countries have introduced routine rotavirus vaccination, almost half with the support of the GAVI vaccine alliance. To make rotavirus vaccines available, accessible, and affordable in all countries—particularly low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia where the majority of rotavirus deaths occur, PATH (formerly Program for Appropriate Technology in Health), the WHO, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and GAVI have partnered with research institutions and governments to generate and disseminate evidence, lower prices, and accelerate introduction.

The vaccine may prevent type 1 diabetes.

== Epidemiology ==
&quot;Rotavirus A&quot;, which accounts for more than 90% of rotavirus gastroenteritis in humans, is endemic worldwide. Each year rotaviruses cause millions of cases of diarrhoea in developing countries, almost 2million of which result in hospitalisation. In 2019, an estimated 151,714 children younger than five died from rotavirus infections, 90 percent of whom were in developing countries. Almost every child has been infected with rotaviruses by age five. Rotaviruses are the leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children, are responsible for about a third of the cases requiring hospitalisation, and cause 37% of deaths attributable to diarrhoea and 5% of all deaths in children younger than five. Boys are twice as likely as girls to be admitted to hospital for rotavirus infections. In the pre-vaccination era, rotavirus infections occurred primarily during cool, dry seasons. The number attributable to food contamination is unknown.

Outbreaks of &quot;rotavirus A&quot; diarrhoea are common among hospitalised infants, young children attending day care centres, and elderly people in nursing homes. An outbreak caused by contaminated municipal water occurred in Colorado in 1981. During 2005, the largest recorded epidemic of diarrhoea occurred in Nicaragua. This unusually large and severe outbreak was associated with mutations in the &quot;rotavirus A&quot; genome, possibly helping the virus escape the prevalent immunity in the population. A similar large outbreak occurred in Brazil in 1977.

&quot;Rotavirus B&quot;, also called adult diarrhoea rotavirus or ADRV, has caused major epidemics of severe diarrhoea affecting thousands of people of all ages in China. These epidemics occurred as a result of sewage contamination of drinking water. &quot;Rotavirus B&quot; infections also occurred in India in 1998; the causative strain was named CAL. Unlike ADRV, the CAL strain is endemic. To date, epidemics caused by &quot;rotavirus B&quot; have been confined to mainland China, and surveys indicate a lack of immunity to this species in the United States. &quot;Rotavirus C&quot; has been associated with rare and sporadic cases of diarrhoea in children, and small outbreaks have occurred in families.

== Other animals ==
Rotaviruses infect the young of many species of animals and they are a major cause of diarrhoea in wild and reared animals worldwide. As a pathogen of livestock, notably in young calves and piglets, rotaviruses cause economic loss to farmers because of costs of treatment associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. These rotaviruses are a potential reservoir for genetic exchange with human rotaviruses. There is evidence that animal rotaviruses can infect humans, either by direct transmission of the virus or by contributing one or several RNA segments to reassortants with human strains.

== History ==
In 1943, Jacob Light and Horace Hodes proved that a filterable agent in the faeces of children with infectious diarrhoea also caused scours (livestock diarrhoea) in cattle. Three decades later, preserved samples of the agent were shown to be rotavirus. In the intervening years, a virus in mice was shown to be related to the virus causing scours. In 1973, Ruth Bishop and colleagues described related viruses found in children with gastroenteritis.

In 1974, Thomas Henry Flewett suggested the name &quot;rotavirus&quot; after observing that, when viewed through an electron microscope, a rotavirus particle looks like a wheel ( in Latin) the name was officially recognised by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses four years later. In 1976, related viruses were described in several other species of animals. These viruses, all causing acute gastroenteritis, were recognised as a collective pathogen affecting humans and other animals worldwide. Rotavirus serotypes were first described in 1980, and in the following year, rotaviruses from humans were first grown in cell cultures derived from monkey kidneys, by adding trypsin (an enzyme found in the duodenum of mammals and now known to be essential for rotavirus to replicate) to the culture medium. The ability to grow rotaviruses in culture accelerated the pace of research, and by the mid-1980s the first candidate vaccines were being evaluated.

<text>Giardia ( or ) is a genus of anaerobic flagellated protozoan parasites of the phylum Metamonada that colonise and reproduce in the small intestines of several vertebrates, causing the disease giardiasis. Their life cycle alternates between a swimming trophozoite and an infective, resistant cyst. &quot;Giardia&quot; were first seen by the Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1681. The genus is named after French zoologist Alfred Mathieu Giard.

==Characteristics==
Like other diplomonads, &quot;Giardia&quot; have two nuclei, each with four associated flagella, and were thought to lack both mitochondria and Golgi apparatuses. However, they are now known to possess a complex endomembrane system as well as mitochondrial remnants, called mitosomes, through mitochondrial reduction. The mitosomes are not used in ATP synthesis the way mitochondria are, but are involved in the maturation of iron-sulfur proteins. The synapomorphies of genus &quot;Giardia&quot; include cells with duplicate organelles, absence of cytostomes, and ventral adhesive disc.

==Systematics==
About 40 species have been described, but most of them are probably synonyms. Currently, five to six morphologically distinct species are recognised. &quot;Giardia duodenalis&quot; (=&quot;G. intestinalis&quot;, =&quot;G. lamblia&quot;) infect humans and other mammals, &quot;G. microti&quot; infects voles, &quot;G. muris&quot; is found in other mammals, &quot;G. ardeae&quot; and &quot;G. psittaci&quot; in birds, and &quot;G. agilis&quot; in amphibians. Other described (but not certainly valid), species include:

*&quot;Giardia ardeae&quot;
*&quot;Giardia beckeri&quot;
*&quot;Giardia beltrani&quot;
*&quot;Giardia botauri&quot;
*&quot;Giardia bovis&quot;
*&quot;Giardia bradypi&quot;
*&quot;Giardia canis&quot;
*&quot;Giardia caprae&quot;
*&quot;Giardia cati&quot;
*&quot;Giardia caviae&quot;
*&quot;Giardia chinchillae&quot;
*&quot;Giardia dasi&quot;
*&quot;Giardia equii&quot;
*&quot;Giardia floridae&quot;
*&quot;Giardia hegneri&quot;
*&quot;Giardia herodiadis&quot;
*&quot;Giardia hyderabadensis&quot;
*&quot;Giardia irarae&quot;
*&quot;Giardia marginalis&quot;
*&quot;Giardia melospizae&quot;
*&quot;Giardia nycticori&quot;
*&quot;Giardia ondatrae&quot;
*&quot;Giardia otomyis&quot;
*&quot;Giardia pitymysi&quot;
*&quot;Giardia pseudoardeae&quot;
*&quot;Giardia psittaci&quot;
*&quot;Giardia recurvirostrae&quot;
*&quot;Giardia sanguinis&quot;
*&quot;Giardia serpentis&quot;
*&quot;Giardia simoni&quot;
*&quot;Giardia sturnellae&quot;
*&quot;Giardia suricatae&quot;
*&quot;Giardia tucani&quot;
*&quot;Giardia varani&quot;
*&quot;Giardia viscaciae&quot;
*&quot;Giardia wenyoni&quot;
*&quot;Giardia dolus&quot;
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests have been developed to detect specific species of &quot;Giardia&quot;. Gene probe can also used to differentiate between species of &quot;Giardia&quot;. A more common and less time-consuming means of identifying different species of &quot;Giardia&quot; includes microscopy and immunofluorescence techniques.

Genetic and biochemical studies have revealed the heterogeneity of &quot;Giardia duodenalis&quot;, which contains probably at least eight lineages or cryptic species.

== Phylogeny ==
The phylogeny of &quot;Giardia&quot; is unclear, but two main theories exist. Firstly, &quot;Giardia&quot; may be extremely primitive eukaryotes that branched off early from other members of their group. This theory is supported by several features: their lack of complete mitochondria (see Characteristics) and other organelles, their primitive metabolic pathways, and their position on a phylogenetic tree. However, many of these differences have been refuted in recent years, and many researchers are supporting a second theory: that &quot;Giardia&quot; are highly evolved parasites, which have lost ancestral characteristics.

==Genome==
A &quot;Giardia&quot; isolate (WB) was the first diplomonad to have its genome sequenced. Its 11.7 million basepair genome is compact in structure and content with simplified basic cellular machineries and metabolism. Currently the genomes of several other &quot;Giardia&quot; isolates and diplomonads (the fish pathogens &quot;Spironucleus vortens&quot; and &quot;S. salmonicida&quot;) are being sequenced.

A second isolate (the B assemblage) from humans has been sequenced along with a species from a pig (the E assemblage). There are ~5000 genes in the genome. The E assemblage is more closely related to the A assemblage than is the B. A number of chromosomal rearrangements are present.

==Infection==
&quot;Giardia&quot; lives in the intestines of infected humans or other animals, individuals of which become infected by ingesting or coming into contact with contaminated foods, soil, or water tainted by the feces of an infected carrier.

The symptoms of &quot;Giardia&quot;, which may begin to appear 2 days after infection, can include mild to violent diarrhoea, excess gas, stomach or abdominal cramps, upset stomach, and nausea. Resulting dehydration and nutritional loss may need immediate treatment. A typical infection can be slight, resolve without treatment, and last between 2 and 6 weeks, although it can sometimes last longer and/or be more severe. Coexistence with the parasite is possible (symptoms fade), but an infected individual can remain a carrier and transmit it to others. Medication containing tinidazole or metronidazole decreases symptoms and time to resolution. Albendazole is also used, and has an anthelmintic (anti-worm) property as well, ideal for certain compounded issues when a general vermicidal agent is preferred.
&quot;Giardia&quot; causes a disease called giardiasis, which causes the villi of the small intestine to atrophy and flatten, resulting in malabsorption in the intestine. Lactose intolerance can persist after the eradication of &quot;Giardia&quot; from the digestive tract.

==Prevalence==
The prevalence of the infection depends on different factors; while the prevalence is estimated around 2% in some developed countries, in other countries from Asia, Africa or Latin America, the prevalence can be estimated between 20% and 40%. In some patients, giardiasis can be completely asymptomatic, so many more cases are estimated.
The diagnostic method used can also infer in the identification and thus the count of cases. Due to their lack of knowledge and overall behavioral patterns, children aged under 5 years are the population with the most reported infections.

<text>Stephen and Timothy Quay ( ; born June 17, 1947) are American identical twin brothers and stop-motion animators who are better known as the Brothers Quay or Quay Brothers. They received the 1998 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Set Design for their work on the play &quot;The Chairs&quot;.

==Careers==
The Quay Brothers reside and work in England, having moved there in 1969 to study at the Royal College of Art, London after studying illustration (Timothy) and film (Stephen) at the Philadelphia College of Art, now the University of the Arts in Philadelphia. In England, they made their first short films, which no longer exist after the only prints were irreparably damaged. They spent some time in the Netherlands in the 1970s and then returned to England, where they teamed up with another Royal College student, Keith Griffiths, who produced all of their films. In 1980, the trio formed Koninck Studios, which is currently based in London&#x27;s Old Street area of Hackney.

==Style==
The Brothers&#x27; works from 1979 to the present show a wide range of often esoteric influences, starting with the Polish animators Walerian Borowczyk and Jan Lenica and continuing with the writers Franz Kafka, Bruno Schulz, Robert Walser and Michel de Ghelderode, puppeteers Wladyslaw Starewicz and Czech Richard Teschner and Czech composers Leoš Janáček, Zdeněk Liška and Polish Leszek Jankowski, the last of whom has created many original scores for their work. Czech animator Jan Švankmajer, for whom they named one of their films (&quot;The Cabinet of Jan Svankmajer&quot;), is also frequently cited as a major influence, but they actually discovered his work relatively late, in 1983, by which time their characteristic style and preoccupations had been fully formed. In a panel discussion with Daniel Bird and Andrzej Klimowski at the Aurora festival in Norwich, they emphasized that a more significant influence on their work was Walerian Borowczyk, who made both animation shorts and live-action features.

Most of their animation films feature puppets made of doll parts and other organic and inorganic materials, often partially disassembled, in a dark, moody atmosphere. Perhaps their best known work is &quot;Street of Crocodiles&quot; (1986), based on the short story of the same name by the Polish author and artist Bruno Schulz. This short film was selected by director and animator Terry Gilliam as one of the ten best animated films of all time, and critic Jonathan Romney included it on his list of the ten best films in any medium (for &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;″s critics&#x27; poll of 2002). They have made two full-length live action films: &quot;Institute Benjamenta, or This Dream People Call Human Life&quot; (1996), produced by Keith Griffiths and Janine Marmot, and &quot;The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes&quot; (2005), produced by Keith Griffiths. They also directed an animated sequence in the film &quot;Frida&quot; (2002).

With very few exceptions, their films have no meaningful spoken dialogue (most have no spoken content at all, while some, such as &quot;The Comb (From the Museums of Sleep)&quot; (1990) include multilingual background gibberish that is not intended to be coherently understood). Accordingly, their films are highly reliant on their music scores, of which many have been written especially for them by the Polish composer Leszek Jankowski. In 2000, they contributed a short film to the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Sound On Film&quot; series in which they visualised a 20-minute piece by the avant-garde composer Karlheinz Stockhausen. Whenever possible, the Quay Brothers prefer to work with pre-recorded music, though Gary Tarn&#x27;s score for &quot;The Phantom Museum&quot; had to be added afterwards when it became impossible to license music by the Czech composer Zdeněk Liška.

They have created music videos for His Name Is Alive (&quot;Are We Still Married&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Go Wrong Without You&quot;), Michael Penn (&quot;Long Way Down (Look What the Cat Drug In)&quot;) and 16 Horsepower (&quot;Black Soul Choir&quot;). Their style has been mimicked to the point that audiences mistakenly believed that the Quay Brothers were responsible for several music videos for Tool but those videos were created by Fred Stuhr and member Adam Jones, whose work is influenced by the Quay Brothers. Although they worked on Peter Gabriel&#x27;s seminal video &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; (1986) as animators, this was directed by Stephen R. Johnson and the Quay Brothers in order to support their personal projects.

Before turning to film, the Quay Brothers worked as professional illustrators. The first edition of Anthony Burgess&#x27; novel &quot;The Clockwork Testament, or Enderby&#x27;s End&quot;, included their drawings before the start of each chapter. Nearly three decades before directly collaborating with Stockhausen, they designed the cover of the book &quot;Stockhausen: Conversations with the Composer&quot; (ed. Jonathan Cott, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1973). After designing book covers for Gothic and science fiction books while in Philadelphia, the Quay Brothers have created suggestive designs for a variety of publications that seem to reflect not only their own interests in particular authors, covers for Italo Calvino, Louis-Ferdinand Céline or Mark le Fanu&#x27;s study of the films of Andrei Tarkovsky, but also in themes and motifs that these authors develop. Literary texts are inspirational sources for almost all of their film projects, whether they serve as a point of departure for their own ideas or as a textual basis for filmic scenarios, and not as scripts or screenplays. The prowess in illustration and calligraphy seeps increasingly into many formal elements in their later films, evident as graphic embellishment in the set decoration, or their particular use of patterns in the puppets&#x27; costume design. Titles, intertitles and credits appear in a variety of handwritten styles.

In an interview with Robert K. Elder for his book &quot;The Best Film You&#x27;ve Never Seen&quot;, the Quay Brothers discuss their creative process, stating: &quot;If [a] project does eventually get approval, then we almost invariably chuck [the] original proposal out, not out of any cavalierness, but simply because we know that, as we start building the decors and the puppets, the script begins to grow and evolve very organically.&quot;

The critical success of &quot;Street of Crocodiles&quot; gave the Quay Brothers artistic freedom to explore a shift in subject matter, in part originating in literary and poetic sources that led to exploration of new aesthetic forms, but also because they were able to make extensive experiments in technique, both with cameras and on large stage sets. The Quay Brothers are best known for their puppet and feature-length films. Less known, but no less incisive in their creative development, is their intense engagement in stage design for opera, ballet and theatre: since 1988, the Quay Brothers have created sets and projections for performing arts productions on international stages. Their work at miniature scale has translated into large-scale designs for the theatre and opera productions of director Richard Jones: Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;The Love for Three Oranges&quot;; Feydeau&#x27;s &quot;A Flea in Her Ear&quot;; Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Mazeppa&quot;; and Molière&#x27;s &quot;Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme&quot;. Their set design for a revival of Ionesco&#x27;s &quot;The Chairs&quot; was nominated for a Tony Award in 1998. The Quay Brothers&#x27; excursion into feature films and live-action dance films were not an indication of a move away from animation and the literature that inspires them—on the contrary, the film explores the potential which slumbers in the combination of these cinematic techniques. Their puppet animation set designs have been curated as an internationally touring exhibition called &quot;Dormitorium&quot; which toured the east coast of the United States in 2009, including the originating venue of the Rosenwald-Wolf Gallery at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, followed by Parsons The New School of Design, New York, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA and Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.

The Quay Brothers are strongly influenced by literature and the written word – from Eastern-European poetry to South American magic realism.

*Felisberto Hernández (&quot;Unmistaken Hands: Ex Voto F.H&quot;, &quot;The Doll&#x27;s Breath&quot;)

==Legacy==
In 2010, the College of Physicians of Philadelphia received a Philadelphia Exhibitions Initiative grant through The Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage for an exhibitions project that would include a new work by the Quay Brothers. The Quay Brothers produced a new film entitled &quot;Through the Weeping Glass: On the Consolations of Life Everlasting (Limbos &amp; Afterbreezes in the Mütter Museum)&quot;. The film is their first made in the United States, produced by Edward Waisnis through his company PRO BONO films in collaboration with Atelier Koninck QBFZ, London and it focuses on the history and collections of the college&#x27;s famed Mütter Museum. The film, with narration by Derek Jacobi and a musical score by Timothy Nelson, was shot on location in Philadelphia during the summer of 2010 and premiered in autumn 2011, with symposia, at The College of Physicians of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania; New York City&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art; and the Museum of Jurassic Technology in Los Angeles. The film was subsequently shown at the Wellcome Collection, London, England; the CFC Worldwide Short Film Festival in Toronto, Canada; The Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, MA; The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, TX; and at the Wexner Center of the Arts at Ohio State University, Columbus, OH. It was reviewed in both &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; and &quot;Film Comment&quot;. The 35mm negative and print were selected for inclusion in the film collection of the Museum of Modern Art.

The Quay Brothers were commissioned by Leeds Canvas, a group of eight cultural organisations in Leeds, UK, to create in May 2012 a major citywide art installation, OverWorlds &amp; UnderWorlds. The commission was one of twelve &#x27;Artists Taking the Lead&#x27; projects around the UK, Arts Council England&#x27;s flagship contribution to the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad. Later in the same year, the Quay Brothers were the subject of a grand retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York entitled &quot;Quay Brothers: On Deciphering the Pharmacist&#x27;s Prescription for Lip-Reading Puppets&quot; which featured work spanning their entire career, tracing back as early as childhood, with much of the material shown for the first time. Organized by Ron Magliozzi, Associate Curator of MoMA&#x27;s Film Department, the exhibition ran from August 12, 2012, through January 7, 2013 and included a full coinciding film program.

In 2013, the Quay Brothers were recipients of a residency program award at the Wexner Center of the Arts, Columbus, Ohio. The project they undertook coinciding with this residency was a puppet animation film entitled: &quot;Unmistaken Hands: Ex Voto F.H.&quot;–that revolves around the work and life of Uruguyan writer Felisberto Hernández, often referred to as the father of &#x27;magic realism&#x27;, and for whose work the Quay Brothers share an affinity. The production was overseen by Edward Waisnis through PRO BONO films, in collaboration with Atelier Koninck QBFZ, and the support of the Fundación Felisberto Hernández, and features a score composed by Timothy Nelson, who has worked with the Quay Brothers previously. As of January 2014, the Quay Brothers have been in production with The Digital Toy Company on a joint film/video-game project entitled &quot;Asleep: I Hear My Name&quot;.

The Quay Brothers&#x27; work was exhibited in two further major international exhibitions in 2013/2014. The first, &quot;The Quay Brothers&#x27; Universum&quot; was the Quay Brothers&#x27; first &#x27;solo&#x27; exhibition in Europe and took place at the EYE Film Institute Netherlands, Amsterdam from December 15, 2013 – March 9, 2014. The second, &quot;Metamorfosis. Visiones Fantásticas de Starewitch, Švankmajer y Los Hermanos Quay&quot; was held at the Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona, Barcelona (25 March – 7 September 2014) and La Casa Encendida (2 October 2014 – 11 January 2015), Madrid, respectively. The exhibition was curated by Spanish animation curator, programmer and historian Carolina López Caballero and was a major exploration of the art of stop motion animation, placing the Quay Brothers&#x27; work alongside Russian-born puppet animation godfather Ladislas Starevich and Czech surrealist master Jan Švankmajer.

Hollywood director Christopher Nolan revealed himself to have been an admirer of the Quay Brothers&#x27; work since coming across their films late at night when they were originally screened on Channel 4 in the UK. In 2015, Nolan curated a theatrical tour showcasing newly restored 35mm prints of the Quay&#x27;s films &quot;In Absentia&quot;, &quot;The Comb&quot; and &quot;Street of Crocodiles&quot;. The programme also included the eight-minute &#x27;documentary&#x27; &quot;Quay&quot; (2015) which Nolan directed as an homage to the twins. The programme and Nolan&#x27;s short received critical acclaim, with &quot;Indiewire&quot; writing in their review that the Quay Brothers &quot;will undoubtedly have hundreds, if not thousands more fans because of Nolan, and for that &quot;The Quay Brothers in 35mm&quot; will always be one of latter&#x27;s most important contributions to cinema&quot;.
Directly after the launch of the 35mm programme in the states, the Quay Brothers were celebrated at the Bristol Festival of Puppetry, UK (August – September 2015). A retrospective of their work was curated by animation director Joseph Wallace, who also hosted a conversation with the Quay Brothers about the relationship between their animation and stage work at Watershed (Bristol). Wallace, along with Puppet Place (the organisation behind the festival), also commissioned the Quay Brothers to create an installation which ran for the duration of the festival and was displayed in a disused control room on a bridge in the centre of Bristol entitled: &quot;Homage To The Framed Perspective of an Abridged Conversation Between the Painters Sassetta &amp; Uccello and the Mystical Occurrence that Happened Before Your Arrival.&quot;.

The Quay Brothers collaborated with Louis Andriessen in 2016 and designed decors for his opera &quot;Theatre of The World&quot; which premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles before playing at the Carré Theatre in Amsterdam as part of the Holland Festival. As well as the design, the Quay Brothers also produced animated projections which accompanied the performance.

In October 2016, a two disk Blu-ray collection of the Quay Brothers films dating 1979–2013 entitled &quot;Inner Sanctums&quot; was released by the British Film Institute. The edition includes 24 of the Quay Brothers&#x27; short films, of which three are UK premieres and five are world premieres, along with a disk of special features including footnotes, interviews, rare behind the scenes films and Christopher Nolan&#x27;s short portrait of the brothers; &quot;Quay&quot; (2015).

<doc id="140973" wikidata="Q235066" url="?curid=140973" title="Laurie Anderson">
<text>Laura Phillips &quot;Laurie&quot; Anderson (born June 5, 1947) is an American avant-garde artist, musician and filmmaker whose work spans performance art, pop music, and multimedia projects. Initially trained in violin and sculpting, Anderson pursued a variety of performance art projects in New York City during the 1970s, focusing particularly on language, technology, and visual imagery. She achieved unexpected commercial success when her song &quot;O Superman&quot; reached number two on the UK singles chart in 1981.

Anderson&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Big Science&quot; was released in 1982 and has since been followed by a number of studio and live albums. She starred in and directed the 1986 concert film &quot;Home of the Brave&quot;. Anderson&#x27;s creative output has also included theatrical and documentary works, voice acting, art installations, and a CD-ROM. She is a pioneer in electronic music and has invented several musical devices that she has used in her recordings and performance art shows.

== Early life and education ==
Laura Phillips Anderson was born in Chicago on June 5, 1947, and grew up in the nearby suburb of Glen Ellyn, Illinois, one of eight children born to Mary Louise (née Rowland) and Arthur T. Anderson. Growing up, she spent weekends studying painting at the Art Institute of Chicago and played with the Chicago Youth Symphony.

She graduated from Glenbard West High School. She attended Mills College in California, and after moving to New York in 1966, graduated in 1969 from Barnard College with a B.A. &quot;magna cum laude&quot; and Phi Beta Kappa, studying art history. In 1972, she obtained an M.F.A. in sculpture from Columbia University.

Her first performance-art piece — a symphony played on automobile horns — was performed in 1969. In 1970, she drew the underground comix &quot;Baloney Moccasins&quot;, which was published by George DiCaprio. In the early 1970s, she worked as an art instructor, as an art critic for magazines such as &quot;Artforum&quot;, and illustrated children&#x27;s books—the first of which was titled &quot;The Package&quot;, a mystery story in pictures alone.

== Career ==
=== 1970s ===

Anderson performed in New York during the 1970s. One of her most-cited performances, &quot;Duets on Ice&quot;, which she conducted in New York and other cities around the world, involved her playing the violin along with a recording while wearing ice skates with the blades frozen into a block of ice; the performance ended only when the ice had melted away. Two early pieces, &quot;New York Social Life&quot; and &quot;Time to Go&quot;, are included in the 1977 compilation &quot;New Music for Electronic and Recorded Media&quot;, along with works by Pauline Oliveros and others. Two other pieces were included on &quot;Airwaves&quot;, a collection of audio pieces by various artists. She also recorded a lecture for &quot;Vision&quot;, a set of artist&#x27;s lectures released by Crown Point Press as a set of six LPs.

Many of Anderson&#x27;s earliest recordings remain unreleased or were issued only in limited quantities, such as her first single, &quot;It&#x27;s Not the Bullet that Kills You (It&#x27;s the Hole)&quot;. That song, along with &quot;New York Social Life&quot; and about a dozen others, was originally recorded for use in an art installation that consisted of a jukebox that played the different Anderson compositions, at the Holly Solomon Gallery in New York City. Among the musicians on these early recordings are Peter Gordon on saxophone, Scott Johnson on guitar, Ken Deifik on harmonica, and Joe Kos on drums. Photographs and descriptions of many of these early performances were included in Anderson&#x27;s retrospective book &quot;Stories from the Nerve Bible&quot;.

During the late 1970s, Anderson made a number of additional recordings that were either released privately or included on compilations of avant-garde music, most notably releases by the Giorno Poetry Systems label run by New York poet John Giorno, an early intimate of Andy Warhol. In 1978, she performed at the Nova Convention, a major conference involving many counter-culture figures and rising avant-garde musical stars, including William S. Burroughs, Philip Glass, Frank Zappa, Timothy Leary, Malcolm Goldstein, John Cage, and Allen Ginsberg. She also worked with comedian Andy Kaufman in the late 1970s.

=== 1980s ===
In 1980, Anderson was awarded an honorary doctorate from the San Francisco Art Institute. In 1982, she was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Arts—Film. In 1987, Anderson was awarded an honorary doctorate in the fine arts from the University of the Arts in Philadelphia.

Anderson became widely known outside the art world in 1981 with the single &quot;O Superman&quot;, originally released in a limited quantity by B. George&#x27;s One Ten Records, which ultimately reached number two on the British charts. The sudden influx of orders from the UK (prompted partly by British station BBC Radio 1 playlisting the record) led to Anderson signing a seven-album deal with Warner Bros. Records, which re-released the single.

&quot;O Superman&quot; was part of a larger stage work titled &quot;United States&quot; and was included on the album &quot;Big Science&quot;. Prior to the release of &quot;Big Science&quot;, Anderson returned to Giorno Poetry Systems to record the album &quot;You&#x27;re the Guy I Want to Share My Money With&quot;; Anderson recorded one side of the double-LP set, with William S. Burroughs and John Giorno recording a side each, and the fourth side featured a separate groove for each artist. This was followed by the back-to-back releases of her albums &quot;Mister Heartbreak&quot; and &quot;United States Live&quot;, the latter of which was a five-LP (and, later, four-CD) recording of her two-evening stage show at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. She also appeared in a television special produced by Nam June Paik broadcast on New Year&#x27;s Day 1984, titled &quot;Good Morning, Mr. Orwell&quot;.

She next starred in and directed the 1986 concert film &quot;Home of the Brave&quot; and also composed the soundtracks for the Spalding Gray films &quot;Swimming to Cambodia&quot; and &quot;Monster in a Box&quot;. During this time, she also contributed music to Robert Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Alcestis&quot; at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She also hosted the PBS series &quot;Alive from Off Center&quot; during 1987, after having produced the short film &quot;What You Mean We?&quot; for the series the year before. &quot;What You Mean We?&quot; introduced a new character played by Anderson: &quot;The Clone&quot;, a digitally altered masculine counterpart to Anderson who later &quot;co-hosted&quot; with her when she did her presenting stint on &quot;Alive from Off Center&quot;. Elements of The Clone were later incorporated into the titular &quot;puppet&quot; of her later work, &quot;Puppet Motel&quot;. In that year, she also appeared on Peter Gabriel&#x27;s album &quot;So&quot;, co-writing and performing on the song &quot;This is the Picture (Excellent Birds)&quot;. (A version of “Excellent Birds” was also released on Mister Heartbreak.)

Release of Anderson&#x27;s first post-&quot;Home of the Brave&quot; album, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Strange Angels&quot;, was delayed for more than a year in order for Anderson to take singing lessons. This was due to the album being more musically inclined (in terms of singing) than her previous works. The single &quot;Babydoll&quot; was a moderate hit on the Modern Rock Charts in 1989.

=== 1990s ===
In 1991, she was a member of the jury at the 41st Berlin International Film Festival. In the same year, Anderson appeared in &quot;The Human Face&quot;, a feature arts documentary directed by artist-filmmakers Nichola Bruce and Michael Coulson for BBC television. Anderson was the presenter in this documentary on the history of the face in art and science. Her face was transformed using latex masks and digital special effects as she introduced ideas about the relationship between physiognomy and perception. Her varied career in the early 1990s included voice-acting in the animated film &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot;. In 1994, she created a CD-ROM titled &quot;Puppet Motel&quot;, which was followed by &quot;Bright Red&quot;, co-produced by Brian Eno, and another spoken-word album, &quot;The Ugly One with the Jewels&quot;. This was followed by an appearance on the 1997 charity single &quot;Perfect Day&quot;.

In 1996, Anderson performed with Diego Frenkel (La Portuária) and Aterciopelados for the AIDS benefit album &quot;Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization.

An interval of more than half a decade followed before her next album release. During this time, she wrote a supplemental article on the cultural character of New York City for the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and created multimedia presentations, including one inspired by &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; (&quot;Songs and Stories from Moby Dick&quot;, 1999–2000). One of the central themes in Anderson&#x27;s work is exploring the effects of technology on human relationships and communication.

Starting in the 1990s, Anderson and Lou Reed, whom she had met in 1992, collaborated on recordings together. Reed contributed to the tracks &quot;In Our Sleep&quot; from Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Bright Red&quot;, &quot;One Beautiful Evening&quot; from Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Life on a String&quot;, and &quot;My Right Eye&quot; and &quot;Only an Expert&quot; from Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Homeland&quot;, which Reed also co-produced. Anderson contributed to the tracks &quot;Call on Me&quot; from Reed&#x27;s collaborative project &quot;The Raven,&quot; &quot;Rouge&quot; and &quot;Rock Minuet&quot; from Reed&#x27;s &quot;Ecstasy&quot;, and &quot;Hang On to Your Emotions&quot; from Reed&#x27;s &quot;Set the Twilight Reeling&quot;.

In late 1998, Artist Space, New York presented an exhibit of Anderson’s work from 1970s to 1980s, along with her 1990s work, &quot;Whirlwind&quot;.

=== 2000s ===

&quot;Life on a String&quot; appeared in 2001, by which time she signed a new contract with another Warner Music label, Nonesuch Records. &quot;Life on a String&quot; was a mixture of new works (including one song recalling the death of her father) and works from the &quot;Moby Dick&quot; presentation. In 2001, she recorded the audiobook version of Don DeLillo&#x27;s novel &quot;The Body Artist&quot;. Anderson went on tour performing a selection of her best-known musical pieces in 2001. One of these performances was recorded in New York City a week after the September 11, 2001 attacks, and included a performance of &quot;O Superman&quot;. This concert was released in early 2002 as the double CD &quot;Live in New York&quot;.

In 2003, Anderson produced albums with French musicians La Jarry and Hector Zazou and also performed with them. Zazou&#x27;s album &quot;Strong Currents&quot; (2003), which brought together well-known soloists, features her alongside Melanie Gabriel, Irene Grandi and Jane Birkin, among others. She became NASA&#x27;s first artist-in-residence in the same year, which inspired her performance piece &quot;The End of the Moon&quot;. In May 2004, she received an honarary doctorate from Columbia University. She was part of the team that created the opening ceremony for the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens and collaborated with choreographer Trisha Brown and filmmaker Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo on the multimedia project &quot;O Zlozony/O Composite&quot; for the Paris Opera Ballet which premiered at the Opera Garnier in Paris in December 2004. She mounted a succession of themed shows and composed a piece for Expo 2005 in Japan. In 2005, Anderson visited Russia&#x27;s space program—the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre and mission control—with The Arts Catalyst and took part in The Arts Catalyst&#x27;s Space Soon event at the Roundhouse to reflect on her experiences. 
In 2005, her exhibition &quot;The Waters Reglitterized&quot; opened at the Sean Kelly Gallery in New York City. According to the press release by Sean Kelly, the work is a diary of dreams and their literal recreation as works of art. This work uses the language of dreams to investigate the dream itself. The resulting pieces include drawings, prints, and high-definition video. The installation ran until October 22, 2005.

In 2006, Anderson was awarded a Residency at the American Academy in Rome. She narrated Ric Burns&#x27; &quot;Andy Warhol: A Documentary Film&quot;, which was first televised in September 2006 as part of the PBS &quot;American Masters&quot; series. She contributed a song to &quot;Plague Songs&quot;, a collection of songs related to the 10 Biblical plagues. Anderson also performed in Came So Far for Beauty, the Leonard Cohen tribute event held in the Point Theatre, Dublin, Ireland, on October 4–5, 2006. In November 2006, she published a book of drawings based on her dreams, titled &quot;Night Life&quot;.

Material from &quot;Homeland&quot; was performed at small work-in-progress shows in New York throughout May 2007 supported by a four-piece band with lighting and video visuals mixed live by Willie Williams and Mark Coniglio, respectively. A European tour of the &quot;Homeland&quot; work in progress included performances on September 28–29, 2007, at the Olympia Theatre, Dublin; on October 17–19 at the Melbourne International Arts Festival; and in Russia at the Moscow Dom Muzyky concert hall on April 26, 2008. The work was performed in Toronto, Canada, on June 14, 2008, with husband Lou Reed, making the &quot;Lost Art of Conversation&quot; a duet with vocals and guitar. Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Homeland Tour&quot; performed at several locations across the United States as well, such as at the Ferst Center for the Arts, Atlanta, Georgia; The Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York City; and Harris Theater for Music and Dance in Millennium Park, Chicago, Illinois, co-presented by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago.

=== 2010s ===

In February 2010, Anderson premiered a new theatrical work, titled &quot;Delusion&quot;, at the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Games. This piece was commissioned by the Vancouver 2010 Cultural Olympiad and the Barbican Centre, London. Anderson was honored with the Women&#x27;s Project Theater Woman of Achievement Award in March 2010. In May/June 2010, Anderson curated the Vivid Live festival in Sydney, together with Lou Reed. Her new album &quot;Homeland&quot; was released on June 22. She performed &quot;Only an Expert&quot; on July 15, 2010, on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, and her song &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Angel&quot; was featured on the Fox TV show &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot; the same day. She appears as a guest musician on several tracks from experimental jazz musician Colin Stetson&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;New History Warfare Vol. 2: Judges&quot;.

Anderson developed a theatrical work titled &quot;Another Day in America&quot;. The first public showings of this work-in-progress took place in Calgary, Alberta, in January 2012 as part of Theatre Junction Grand&#x27;s 2011–12 season and One Yellow Rabbit&#x27;s annual arts festival, the High Performance Rodeo. Anderson was named the Inaugural Distinguished Artist-In-Residence at the Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (EMPAC) at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, in May 2012. In March 2013, an exhibition of Anderson&#x27;s work entitled &quot;Laurie Anderson: Language of the Future, selected works 1971-2013&quot; at the Samstag Museum was part of the Adelaide Festival of the Arts in Adelaide, South Australia. Anderson performed her &quot;Duets on Ice&quot; outside the Samstag on opening night.

Anderson received the Honorary Doctor of Arts from the Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture in 2013. In June/July 2013, Anderson performed &quot;The Language of the Future&quot; and guest curated at the River to River Festival in New York City. In November 2013, she was the featured Guest of Honor at the B3 Biennale of the Moving Image in Frankfurt, Germany. In 2018, Anderson contributed vocals to a re-recording of the David Bowie song &quot;Shining Star (Makin&#x27; My Love)&quot;, originally from Bowie&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot;. She was asked to join the production by producer Mario J. McNulty, who knew that Anderson and Bowie had been friends.

On February 10, 2019, at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, held in Los Angeles, Anderson and Kronos Quartet&#x27;s &quot;Landfall&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music/Small Ensemble Performance. It was Anderson&#x27;s first collaboration with Kronos Quartet and her first Grammy award, and was the second Grammy for Kronos. Inspired by her experience of Hurricane Sandy, Nonesuch Records said, &quot;&quot;Landfall&quot; juxtaposes lush electronics and traditional strings by Kronos with Anderson&#x27;s powerful descriptions of loss, from water-logged pianos to disappearing animal species to Dutch karaoke bars.&quot;
&quot;Chalkroom&quot; is a virtual reality work by Anderson and Taiwanese artist Hsin-Chien Huang in which the reader flies through an enormous structure made of words, drawings, and stories. &quot;To the Moon&quot;, a collaboration with Hsin-Chien Huang, premiered at the Manchester International Festival on July 12, 2019. A 15-minute virtual reality artwork, &quot;To the Moon&quot; allows audience members to explore a moon that features donkey rides and rubbish from Earth in a non-narrative structure. Alongside, a film shows the development of the new work.

=== 2020s ===

Anderson was appointed the 2021 Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University and presented a series of six lectures titled &quot;Spending the War Without You: Virtual Backgrounds&quot; over two semesters.

In 2021, Anderson created a show on the second floor of the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C., titled &quot;The Weather&quot; and described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;a sort of nonretrospective retrospective of one of America&#x27;s major, and majorly confounding, modern artists&quot;.

In mid-2023, Laurie Anderson created &quot;Looking into a Mirror Sideways&quot;, an exhibit that highlights various different styles of her art techniques. It opened at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, Sweden. Since opening, this artwork has been Anderson’s biggest solo show in Europe.

While in Europe, Anderson teamed up with Sexmob, a New York jazz band. Sexmob and Anderson toured Europe where they performed multiple versions of her songs, but adding a twist to them all. This tour was seen as &quot;an attempt at defying gravity, resisting the pull, [and] reverting the downward fall&quot;.

In 2024, Anderson withdrew from a guest professorship at the Folkwang University of the Arts in Essen, after university officials objected to her support of a &quot;Letter Against Apartheid&quot; organised by Palestinian artists, calling for &quot;an immediate and unconditional cessation of Israeli violence against Palestinians&quot;.

She is foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.

== Inventions ==
Anderson has invented several experimental musical instruments that she has used in her recordings and performances. In 1977, she created a tape-bow violin that uses recorded magnetic tape on the bow instead of horsehair and a magnetic tape head in the bridge. In the late 1990s, she collaborated with Interval Research to develop an instrument she called a &quot;talking stick&quot;, a six-foot-long (1.8 m) baton-like MIDI controller that can access and replicate sounds.

=== Tape-bow violin ===
The tape-bow violin is an instrument created by Laurie Anderson in 1977. It uses recorded magnetic tape in place of the traditional horsehair in the bow, and a magnetic tape head in the bridge. Anderson has updated and modified this device over the years. She can be seen using a later generation of this device in her film &quot;Home of the Brave&quot; during the &quot;Late Show&quot; segment in which she manipulates a sentence recorded by William S. Burroughs. This version of the violin used MIDI-based audio samples, triggered by contact with the bow.

=== Talking stick ===
The talking stick is a six-foot-long baton-like MIDI controller. It was used in the &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; tour in 1999–2000. She described it in program notes as follows:

=== Voice filters ===
A recurring motif in Anderson&#x27;s work is the use of an electric pitch-shifting voice filter that deepens her voice into a masculine register, a technique that Anderson has referred to as &quot;audio drag&quot;. Anderson has long used the resulting character in her work as a &quot;voice of authority&quot; or conscience, although she later decided that the voice had lost much of its authority and instead began using the voice to provide historical or sociopolitical commentary, as it is used on &quot;Another Day in America&quot;, a piece from her 2010 album &quot;Homeland&quot;.

For much of Anderson&#x27;s career, the voice was nameless or called the Voice of Authority, although as early as 2009 it was dubbed Fenway Bergamot at Lou Reed&#x27;s suggestion. The cover of &quot;Homeland&quot; depicts Anderson in character as Bergamot, with streaks of black makeup to give her a moustache and thick, masculine eyebrows.

In &quot;The Cultural Ambassador&quot;, a piece on her album &quot;The Ugly One with the Jewels&quot;, Anderson explained some of her perspective on the character:

==Personal life==
She moved to New York in 1966 and now lives in Tribeca. Anderson met singer-songwriter Lou Reed in 1992, and she was married to him from April 2008 until his death in 2013.

Anderson is a long-time student of Buddhism and meditation. She first learned meditation on a retreat with the Insight Meditation Society in 1977. She has since become a student of Tibetan Buddhist teacher Mingyur Rinpoche.

Anderson also recorded a number of limited-release singles in the late 1970s (many issued from the Holly Soloman Gallery), songs from which were included on a number of compilations, including Giorno Poetry Systems&#x27; &quot;The Nova Convention&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re the Guy I Want to Share My Money With&quot;. Over the years she has performed on recordings by other musicians such as Peter Gabriel, Lou Reed, and Jean Michel Jarre. She also contributed lyrics to the Philip Glass album &quot;Songs from Liquid Days&quot;, and contributed a spoken-word piece to a tribute album in honor of John Cage.

== Legacy ==
In 2013, Dale Eisinger of &quot;Complex&quot; ranked &quot;United States&quot; as the third greatest work of performance art ever, with the writer arguing that Anderson is &quot;able to ascertain just exactly the climate of life in the United States, without being so punctuated that it causes a standoff. Perhaps the zenith of this configuration was her multimedia performance, &#x27;United States I – IV.&#x27; [...] [Anderson displays] her vast, incisive range of talents on the &#x27;United States Live&#x27; recordings.&quot;

<text>Six ships of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS &quot;St Albans&quot; after the English city and ducal family of St Albans:

* was a 50-gun fourth-rate ship of the line launched in 1687. She fought at Bantry Bay in 1689 and at Barfleur in 1691 before being wrecked in a gale in Kinsale harbour in 1693.
* was a 50-gun fourth rate launched in 1706. She was rebuilt in 1718 and served in the war against Spain from 1739, mainly in the West Indies. She was wrecked in Kingston during a hurricane in 1744.
* was a 60-gun fourth rate launched in 1747. She served against the French from 1756 and participated in the Battle of Lagos (1759) before being sold in 1765.
* was a 64-gun third rate launched in 1764. She served in the American War of Independence from 1777 and was part of the fleet that captured Saint Lucia and won victories at Battle of Saint Kitts and The Saintes. She was converted to a floating battery in 1803, refitted as a 64-gun ship in 1807, recommissioned, and sent out to the East Indies and China. By 1810 she was off Cadiz. She was paid off in 1812 and was broken up in 1814.
* was the American destroyer , transferred to Britain in late 1940 as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. Initially used for escort duties, she was transferred to the Russians in 1944 before being returned to be scrapped in 1949.
* is a Type 23 Duke-class frigate. She was launched in 2000 and is currently in service.

There was also HMS &quot;St Albans Prize&quot;, an 18-gun sixth rate captured from the French in 1691 by and sold in 1698.

<doc id="140976" wikidata="Q1264384" url="?curid=140976" title="Type 23 frigate">
<text>The Type 23 frigate or Duke class is a class of frigates built for the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy. The ships are named after British Dukes, thus leading to the class being commonly known as the Duke class. The first Type 23, , was commissioned in 1989, and the sixteenth, was commissioned in June 2002. They form the core of the Royal Navy&#x27;s destroyer and frigate fleet and serve alongside the Type 45 destroyers. They were designed for anti-submarine warfare, but have been used for a range of uses. Eight Type 23 frigates remain in service with the Royal Navy, with three vessels having been sold to the Chilean Navy and five being retired since 2021.

The Royal Navy&#x27;s Type 23 frigates will be replaced by the Type 26 Global Combat Ship and the Type 31 frigate. it is anticipated that HMS &quot;St Albans&quot; will be the last to retire from the Royal Navy, in 2035.

==Development==
When first conceived in the late 1970s, the Type 23 was intended to be a light anti-submarine frigate with a towed array sonar to counter Soviet nuclear submarines operating in the North Atlantic. The Type 23 would be replacing the frigates (which had entered service in the 1960s) and the Type 21 frigate (a general purpose design that had recently entered service) as the backbone of the Royal Navy&#x27;s surface ship anti-submarine force. The procurement of the class was announced in the 1981 Defence White Paper as &quot;simpler and cheaper than the Type 22 [with] its characteristics... framed with an eye to the export market as well as Royal Navy needs.&quot;
The ship was designed by the Royal Corps of Naval Constructors, in close partnership with the prime contractor, Yarrow Shipbuilders. No anti-air warfare system was planned, however the lessons learned during the Falklands War led to the introduction of the vertically launched Sea Wolf missile; In June 1984 BAe Dynamics was awarded a development contract for the missile system. Unlike conventional Sea Wolf, the missile is boosted vertically until it clears the ship&#x27;s superstructure, and then turns to fly directly to the target. Consequently, the ship&#x27;s structure does not impose no-fire directions that would delay or inhibit missile firing in a conventionally launched system. With the addition of Harpoon surface-to-surface missiles and a medium calibre gun for naval gunfire support, the Type 23 had evolved into a more complex and balanced vessel optimised for general warfare, which introduced a host of new technologies and concepts to the Royal Navy. These included extensive radar cross-section reduction design measures, automation to substantially reduce crew size, a combined diesel-electric and gas (CODLAG) propulsion system providing very quiet running for anti-submarine operations and a large range.

In December 1986 the procurement of a Ferranti command and control system was cancelled as the specification was deemed to be insufficient to meet the demands of a modern warship, particularly the processing demands of the towed sonar array. Dowty-Sema won a contract for a replacement command and control system in August 1989, however, the delay meant early Type 23s entered service without the capability to use the Sea Wolf missile system in combat.

It was reported in 1998 to the House of Commons that: &quot;Type 23 frigates achieved approximately 85–89 per cent average availability for operational service in [the previous] five years with the exception of 1996 when the figure dropped to just over 80 per cent due to a number of ships experiencing a particular defect. This discounts time spent in planned maintenance.&quot;

Unlike the Type 45 destroyer, the Type 23 frigate does not have the capability to act as a flagship.

===Programme costs===
Prior to the Falklands War the cost of the Type 23 frigates was estimated at £75 million each (September 1980 prices) Changes following the experiences in the Falklands, including improved damage control and fire precautions, led to an increased cost estimated at £110 million (1984–85 prices)
By 2001, the Ministry of Defence said the cost of was £135.449 million and the remaining ships would have a final cost between £60 million and £96 million each. The Ministry of Defence said in 1998 that the Merlin ASW helicopter was costing them £97M each (this was for an order for 44 airframes), and that this was 57% of the cost of Type 23. From this it can be calculated that the cost of Type 23 was £170.1M each. The Government&#x27;s declared policy for construction contracts for Type 23 was &quot;...competition, the aim being to secure best value for money for the defence budget.&quot; while maintaining &quot;sufficient warship-building capacity to meet likely future defence requirements and a competitive base&quot;

HMS &quot;Norfolk&quot; was the first of the class to enter service, commissioned into the fleet on 1 June 1990 at a cost of £135.449 million; later vessels cost £60–96 million.

==Upgrades and future technologies==
===Mid-life refit===
The class underwent mid-life refits which lasted 12–18 months and cost £15-20m. Aside from refurbishment of the mess decks and drive train, the ships are being retrofitted with a transom flap which can add up to to the top speed and reduce fuel consumption by 13%, and Intersleek anti-fouling paint which added to the top speed of the carrier &quot;Ark Royal&quot;. Although the top speed of the Duke class is commonly quoted as 28 knots, the caption of an official Navy photo suggests that &quot;Lancaster&quot; was capable of 32 knots even before her mid-life refit. The Sea Wolf Mid Life Update (SWMLU) improves the sensors and guidance of the missiles, point defences are further improved with new remotely operated 30 mm guns, and Mod 1 of the Mk8 main gun has an all-electric loading system and a smaller radar cross-section. The communications and command systems are also upgraded.

A further Life Extension (LIFEX) Upkeep project saw the Sea Wolf missiles replaced with the new Sea Ceptor anti-air defence missiles; these were first test-fired from HMS &quot;Argyll&quot; on 4 September 2017.

===Sonar 2087===

Sonar 2087 is described by its manufacturer as &quot;a towed-array system that enables Type 23 frigates to hunt the latest submarines at considerable distances and locate them beyond the range at which they [submarines] can launch an attack.&quot; Sonar 2087 was fitted to eight Type 23 frigates in mid-life refits between 2004 and 2012; the five oldest Type 23 frigates, HMS &quot;Montrose&quot;, &quot;Monmouth&quot;, &quot;Iron Duke&quot;, &quot;Lancaster&quot; and &quot;Argyll&quot; are not scheduled to receive Sonar 2087. These ships will instead continue to be employed across the normal range of standing Royal Navy deployments. The Chilean Navy is procuring a number of Sonar 2087 towed arrays from Thales Underwater Systems to equip its multipurpose frigates.

===Artisan 3D radar===

The Type 23&#x27;s original medium-range radar was replaced by BAE Systems Type 997 Artisan 3D radar; the project was worth £100 million and the contract was announced on 4 August 2008. It is a medium-range radar designed to be capable of operating effectively in littoral zones and improving air-defence, anti-surface (anti-ship) and air traffic management capabilities of the Type 23 frigates. The radar is also designed to combat complex jammers. HMS &quot;Iron Duke&quot; was the first Type 23 frigate to receive the Artisan radar during her refit in 2012–13.

It is claimed the radar is five times more capable than the Type 996 radar it replaces.

===Common Anti-Air Modular Missile===

CAMM(M), the maritime variant of the Common Anti-Air Modular Missile, started to replace the Sea Wolf missiles on the Type 23 frigates from 2016. CAMM(M) has a longer range of 1–25+ km compared to the 1–10 km offered by the Sea Wolf missile. An option exists to give the missile a surface-attack capability, though it is currently understood the Royal Navy will not take that option, because of cost. Like Sea Wolf, CAMM(M) will be VLS launched; however due to its design, CAMM(M) can be packed much more tightly into the VLS, with up to four CAMM(M) fitting into the space occupied by one Sea Wolf missile. CAMM(M) is known as Sea Ceptor in Royal Navy service.

=== Martlet Lightweight Multirole Missile ===
On an unspecified date in early 2019, tested a modified mounting for the 30mm cannon which incorporated a launcher for five &#x27;Martlet&#x27; Lightweight Multirole Missiles, by firing four of them at a small speedboat target at the Aberporth range in Wales. The concept of mounting the missile alongside the 30mm Bushmaster cannon was tested just 5 months after the idea&#x27;s conception.

The intended role of the Martlet is to further extend the Type 23&#x27;s capabilities against small, fast moving targets beyond the current 30mm, GPMG and Minigun options to provide a long range &#x27;stand-off&#x27; ability. It is not yet clear whether the Royal Navy intends to equip any more Type 23s with the system.

=== Anti-ship missile ===

In March 2019, a study commenced for an interim replacement for the ageing Harpoon anti-ship missiles, until completion of the Anglo-French Future Cruise/Anti-Ship Weapon (FC/ASW) programme which was scheduled to enter service in the 2030s. The interim replacement missile was originally planned to be fitted to five of the newer Type 23 frigates.

In November 2021, then First Sea Lord, Admiral Tony Radakin, said that the program had been paused and would likely be cancelled. In February 2022, the project was cancelled. However, in July 2022 the Defence Secretary confirmed that the program had been restarted. In November 2022, it was announced that the Royal Navy would receive the Naval Strike Missile (NSM), which will be fitted to a total of 11 vessels, both Type 23 frigates and Type 45 destroyers.

In 2021, it was reported that only two frigates, &quot;Montrose&quot; and &quot;Kent&quot;, were deployed with a full load of eight Harpoon canisters per ship. In August 2022, it was reported that in preparation for her planned deployment to the Persian Gulf to replace HMS &quot;Montrose&quot;, HMS &quot;Lancaster&quot; had also been fitted with eight Harpoon anti-ship missiles.

==Weapons, countermeasures, capabilities and sensors==

===Anti-air warfare===
* Type 997 Artisan 3D radar installed/being installed on 12 of 13 vessels replacing previous Type 996 Mod 1, 3D surveillance and target indication radar.
* 12 of 13 Royal Navy frigates (plus the Chilean vessels) upgraded with 32-cell Sea Ceptor GWS.35 VLS canisters (range of over ) as replacement for the previous Sea Wolf SAM. HMS &quot;Argyll&quot; was the first ship to receive Sea Ceptor, completing refit in February 2017. As of 2021 in addition to &quot;Argyll&quot;, &quot;Westminster&quot;, &quot;Montrose&quot;, &quot;Northumberland&quot;, &quot;Kent&quot;, &quot;Lancaster&quot;, &quot;Richmond&quot; and &quot;Portland&quot; had all received Sea Ceptor systems. &quot;Somerset&quot; returned to service with Sea Ceptor in March 2022, and &quot;Iron Duke&quot; followed in May 2023. &quot;St Albans&quot; and &quot;Sutherland&quot; are the final frigates to receive the upgrade, with &quot;Sutherland&quot; having begun her refit in April 2021. The 2021 defence white paper announced that &quot;Monmouth&quot; will not receive the upgrade and, together with &quot;Montrose&quot;, would be retired early. &quot;Monmouth&quot; was formally withdrawn from service in June 2021, followed by &quot;Argyll&quot; and &quot;Westminster&quot; in 2024.

===Anti-ship warfare (missiles)===
* Up to eight Harpoon anti-ship missile launchers (apart from those fit to HMS &quot;Lancaster&quot; (F229), withdrawn in 2023/24; being replaced on eleven Type 23 frigates and Type 45 destroyers by the Naval Strike Missile - NSM; NSM fit to F79 and F82 as of 2024).
* Up to one embarked Agusta Westland AW159 Wildcat helicopter potentially equipped with Martlet multirole missiles (as of 2021) or Sea Venom anti-ship missiles (projected from 2026).

===Anti-submarine warfare===
* A Thales Underwater Systems Type 2050 bow sonar scheduled to be replaced by an Ultra Electronics Type 2150 next generation ASW bow sonar in due course.

* fire-control system: Sperry Sea Archer 30 optronic surveillance/director&#x27;
* Combat Management System: BAE Systems Command System DNA(2)&#x27;

===Additional capabilities===
* The Type 23 frigates have sufficient space to embark a small detachment of Royal Marines and their equipment.

==Ships==

Although the Type 23 is officially the &quot;Duke&quot; class, and includes such famous names as HMS &quot;Iron Duke&quot; (which had been the name of the battleship , Admiral Jellicoe&#x27;s flagship at the Battle of Jutland), five of the names had previously been used on classes known as the &quot;County class&quot;: &quot;Kent&quot; and &quot;Norfolk&quot; were names given both to 1960s guided-missile destroyers and Second World War-era County-class heavy cruisers, while &quot;Monmouth&quot;, &quot;Lancaster&quot;, &quot;Kent&quot; and &quot;Argyll&quot; revived names carried by First World War-era &quot;Monmouth&quot;-class armoured cruisers. This use of Ducal and County names broke a tradition of alphabetical names for escort ships which had run in two – not unbroken – cycles from the L-class destroyers of 1913 to the s of 1950; this progression was revived with the &quot;Amazon&quot;-class Type 21 frigates of 1972–1975, and continued with B and C names for most of the Type 22 frigates of 1976–1989. However, the D names have since been used for the new Type 45 &quot;Daring&quot;-class destroyers.

On 21 July 2004, in the Delivering Security in a Changing World review of defence spending, Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon announced that &quot;Norfolk&quot;, and were to be paid off. In 2005 it was announced that these three vessels would be sold to the Chilean Navy, to be delivered in 2008. In September 2005 BAE Systems was awarded a £134 million GBP contract to prepare the frigates for transfer. ex-&quot;Marlborough&quot;, ex-&quot;Norfolk&quot; and ex-&quot;Grafton&quot; were sold to Chile for a total of £134 million. The letter of intent for purchase was signed in December 2004, followed by a formal contract on 7 September 2005. ex-&quot;Norfolk&quot; was handed over by the Defence Logistics Organisation and BAE Systems and commissioned into the Chilean Navy on 22 November 2006, and named &quot;Almirante Cochrane&quot; (FF-05) (after Lord Cochrane, a naval hero to both the British and Chileans). Ex-&quot;Grafton&quot; was delivered to Chilean Navy on 28 March 2007 at Portsmouth and renamed &quot;Almirante Lynch&quot; (FF-07). Ex-&quot;Marlborough&quot; was delivered to Chilean Navy on 28 May 2008 at Portsmouth and renamed &quot;Almirante Condell&quot; (FF-06). , these three ships remain in service with the Chilean Navy and were upgraded by Lockheed Martin Canada by the local ASMAR shipbuilding company.

The two oldest ships in Royal Navy service are classified as General Purpose ships, and are primarily homeported at Portsmouth. The remainder are equipped with the Type 2087 Towed Array Sonar, and are primarily tasked with the anti-submarine warfare mission. These seven ships are based primarily at Devonport. The Type 23 ships in the Royal Navy are due to be replaced in service by the Type 26 ASW and Type 31 general purpose frigates. The 2021 defence white paper indicated that both &quot;Montrose&quot; and &quot;Monmouth&quot; would be withdrawn early. &quot;Monmouth&quot;, having had the planned life-extension refit cancelled, and been laid up since 2018, was withdrawn from service in June 2021. In 2024, it was indicated that both HMS &quot;Westminster&quot; and HMS &quot;Argyll&quot; would also be retired. In 2021 in a written answer provided to the House of Commons Select Defence Committee, the First Sea Lord, Admiral Tony Radakin, suggested that older frigates of the class would be retained in service longer than anticipated in order to ensure that escort numbers did not fall below 17 ships (6 destroyers and 11 frigates) and start to rise above 19 escorts beginning in 2026. However, personnel shortages and the age of some ships ended up making this cost prohibitive. In November 2024, the newly elected Labour government indicated that HMS &quot;Northumberland&quot; would also be withdrawn from service by March 2025.

==Operational history==

In 2011, destroyed a gun battery outside the besieged city of Misrata, Libya. She also fired star shells into the night sky to illuminate pro-Gaddafi positions to allow NATO aircraft to destroy them.

On the 9th March 2024 used its Sea Ceptor missiles to shoot down two attack drones. This was the first use of Sea Ceptor in operational circumstances by the class.

==In fiction==
* was used for the Type 23 interior shots in the James Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; in three different roles as HMS &quot;Chester&quot;, HMS &quot;Devonshire&quot; and HMS &quot;Bedford&quot;. For the exterior shots a Type 23 model was constructed.
* The ITV series &quot;Making Waves&quot; was set aboard the Type 23 frigate HMS &quot;Suffolk&quot; (which was portrayed by ).
* and were used to portray the interior and exterior shots of the fictional HMS &quot;Monarch&quot; for the film &quot;Command Approved&quot; which is the centre piece of &quot;Action Stations&quot; at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard, Portsmouth, England.
* The fictional HMS &quot;Beaufort&quot; is the centrepiece of British author Mike Lunnon-Wood&#x27;s novel &quot;King&#x27;s Shilling&quot;. In it, HMS &quot;Beaufort&quot; is tasked to evacuate the British embassy and citizens in the Liberian capital Monrovia during the 1990s civil war.
* The TNT series &quot;The Last Ship&quot; featured a Chilean Duke-class frigate in the fourth episode of its fifth season, charging an and landing a hit with one of four Sea Wolf missiles.

<text>Cedar oil, also known as cedarwood oil, is an essential oil derived from various types of conifers, most in the pine or cypress botanical families. It is produced from the foliage, and sometimes the wood, roots, and stumps left after logging of trees for timber. It has many uses in art, industry, and perfumery, and while the characteristics of oils derived from various species may vary, all have some degree of pesticidal effects.

== Sources and characteristics ==
Although termed cedar or cedarwood oils, the most important oils are produced from distilling wood of a number of different junipers (&quot;Juniperus&quot;) and cypresses (&quot;Cupressus&quot;; both of the family Cupressaceae), rather than true cedars (of the family Pinaceae). Similar oils are distilled, pressed or chemically extracted in small quantities from wood, roots, and leaves from plants of the genera &quot;Platycladus&quot;, &quot;Cupressus&quot;, &quot;Taiwania&quot;, and &quot;Calocedrus&quot;.

One of the elements found in many cedar trees is cedrol. The amount of cedrol in a species of cedar affects its pesticidal effect on insects. As part of ancient Egyptian funerary practices, cedar oil was used in embalming, which in effect helped to keep insects from disturbing the body.

Cedarwood oil is a mixture of organic compounds considered generally safe by the FDA as a food additive preservative. The United States EPA &quot;does not expect [toxic] effects to occur among users of currently registered cedarwood oil products&quot; because their use and public exposure is at a lower level and more intermittent than in case studies (e.g., U.S. National Toxicology Program). The EPA believes there is negligible human and environmental risk posed by exposure to registered cedarwood pesticide if used in properly prescribed manner.

All the cedarwood oils of commerce contain a group of chemically related compounds, the relative proportions of which depend upon the species from which the oil is obtained. These compounds include cedrol and cedrene, and while they contribute something to the odor of the whole oil they are also valuable to the chemical industry for conversion to other derivatives with fragrance applications. The oils are therefore used both directly and as sources of chemical isolates.

==Uses==

Cedarwood oils each have characteristic woody odours which may change somewhat in the course of drying out. The crude oils are often yellowish or even darker in color and some, such as Texas cedarwood oil (derived primarily from &quot;Juniperus ashei&quot; and &quot;J. deppeana&quot;), are quite viscous and deposit crystals on standing. They find use (sometimes after &quot;rectification&quot;) in a range of fragrance applications such as soap perfumes, household sprays, floor polishes and insecticides. Small quantities are used in microscope work as a clearing oil.

Today, cedarwood oil is often used for its aromatic properties, especially in aromatherapy; it can also be used to renew the smell of natural cedar furniture. Cedarwood oil is used as an insect repellent, both directly applied to the skin and as an additive to sprays, candles and other products.

In India, oil from the deodar cedar (&quot;Cedrus deodara&quot;, a true cedar) has been shown to possess insecticidal and antifungal properties and to have some potential for control of fungal deterioration of spices during storage. It is still sometimes also used to clarify emeralds.

== History ==

=== Cedar of Lebanon ===

The cedarwood oil of the ancients, in particular the Sumerians and Egyptians, was derived from the Cedar of Lebanon (&quot;Cedrus libani&quot;), a true cedar native to the northern and western mountains of the Middle East. The once-mighty Cedar of Lebanon forests of antiquity have been almost entirely eradicated, and today no commercial oil extraction is based on this species. 

=== Sumer ===
Cedarwood oil was used as the base for paints by the ancient Sumerians. They would grind cobalt compounds in a mortar to produce a blue pigment. They could obtain green from copper, yellow from lead antimonate, black from charcoal, and white from gypsum.

=== Ancient Egypt ===
One of three methods of ancient Egyptian embalming practices employs the use of cedarwood oil. This was a less costly method than the best known of the ancient Egyptian practices of removing internal organs for separate preservation in canopic jars. The practice...called for the injection of cedar oil into body cavities without evisceration. The body was laid in natrum or natron—a fixed alkali—for the prescribed period, after which the cedarwood oil, which had dissolved the soft organs, was released; and the body, its flesh dissolved by the natron, was reduced to preserved skin and bones.

=== Classical antiquity ===

As the Roman naturalist and author Pliny the Elder (23/24 –79 CE) in his encyclopedic work &quot;Natural History&quot; () describes how aromatic oils are produced through the destructive distillation of pine wood, he also mentions that a similar substance, “cedrium” (cedar oil), is produced in Syria, and how it is used.

=== Light microscopy ===
Until the development of synthetic immersion oil in the 1940s, cedarwood oil was widely used for the oil immersion objective in light microscopy.
