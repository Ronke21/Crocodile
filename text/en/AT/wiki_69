<text>French Canadians, referred to as Canadiens mainly before the nineteenth century, are an ethnic group descended from French colonists first arriving in France&#x27;s colony of Canada in 1608. The vast majority of French Canadians live in the province of Quebec.

During the 17th century, French settlers originating mainly from the west and north of France settled Canada. It is from them that the French Canadian ethnicity was born. During the 17th to 18th centuries, French Canadians expanded across North America and colonized various regions, cities, and towns. As a result, people of French Canadian descent can be found across North America. Between 1840 and 1930, many French Canadians emigrated to New England, an event known as the Grande Hémorragie.

== Etymology ==
French Canadians get their name from the French colony of Canada, the most developed and densely populated region of New France during the period of French colonization in the 17th and 18th centuries. The original use of the term &quot;Canada&quot; referred to the area of present-day Quebec along the St. Lawrence River, divided in three districts (Québec, Trois-Rivières, and Montréal), as well as to the &quot;Pays d&#x27;en Haut&quot; (Upper Countries), a vast and thinly settled territorial dependence north and west of Montreal which covered the whole of the Great Lakes area.

From 1535 to the 1690s, &quot;Canadien&quot; was a word used by the French to refer to the First Nations they had encountered in the St. Lawrence River valley at Stadacona and Hochelaga, though First Nations groups did not refer to themselves as &quot;Canadien&quot;. At the end of the 17th century, &quot;Canadien&quot; became an ethnonym distinguishing the French inhabitants of Canada from those of France. At the end of the 18th century, to distinguish between the English-speaking population and the French-speaking population, the terms &quot;English Canadian&quot; and &quot;French Canadian&quot; emerged. During the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s to 1980s, inhabitants of Quebec began to identify as Québécois instead of simply French Canadian.

== History ==
French settlers from Normandy, Perche, Beauce, Brittany, Maine, Anjou, Touraine, Poitou, Aunis, Angoumois, Saintonge, and Gascony were the first Europeans to permanently colonize what is now Quebec, parts of Ontario, Acadia, and select areas of Western Canada, all in Canada (see French colonization of the Americas). Their colonies of New France (also commonly called Canada) stretched across what today are the Maritime provinces, southern Quebec and Ontario, as well as the entire Mississippi River Valley.

The first permanent European settlements in Canada were at Port Royal in 1605 and Quebec City in 1608 as fur trading posts. The territories of New France were Canada, Acadia (later renamed Nova Scotia), and Louisiana; the mid-continent Illinois Country was at first governed from Canada and then attached to Louisiana. The inhabitants of the French colony of Canada (modern-day Quebec) called themselves the &quot;Canadiens&quot;, and came mostly from northwestern France. The early inhabitants of Acadia, or Acadians (&quot;Acadiens)&quot;, came mostly but not exclusively from the southwestern regions of France.

&quot;Canadien&quot; explorers and fur traders would come to be known as &quot;coureurs des bois&quot; and &quot;voyageurs&quot;, while those who settled on farms in Canada would come to be known as &quot;habitants&quot;. Many French Canadians are the descendants of the King&#x27;s Daughters (&quot;Filles du Roi&quot;) of this era. A few also are the descendants of mixed French and Algonquian marriages (see also Metis people and Acadian people). During the mid-18th century, French explorers and &quot;Canadiens&quot; born in French Canada colonized other parts of North America in what are today the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois, Vincennes, Indiana, Louisville, Kentucky, the Windsor-Detroit region and the Canadian prairies (primarily Southern Manitoba).
After the 1760 British conquest of New France in the French and Indian War (known as the Seven Years&#x27; War in Canada), the French-Canadian population remained important in the life of the colonies. The British gained Acadia by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. It took the 1774 Quebec Act for French Canadians to regain the French civil law system, and in 1791 French Canadians in Lower Canada were introduced to the parliamentary system when an elected Legislative Assembly was created. The Legislative Assembly having no real power, the political situation degenerated into the Lower Canada Rebellions of 1837–1838, after which Lower Canada and Upper Canada were unified. Some of the motivations for the union was to limit French-Canadian political power and at the same time transferring a large part of the Upper Canadian debt to the debt-free Lower Canada. After many decades of British immigration, the &quot;Canadiens&quot; became a minority in the Province of Canada in the 1850s.

French-Canadian contributions were essential in securing responsible government for the Canadas and in undertaking Canadian Confederation. In the late 19th and 20th centuries, French Canadians&#x27; discontent grew with their place in Canada because of a series of events: including the execution of Louis Riel, the elimination of official bilingualism in Manitoba, Canada&#x27;s military participation in the Second Boer War, Regulation 17 which banned French-language schools in Ontario, the Conscription Crisis of 1917 and the Conscription Crisis of 1944.

Between the 1840s and the 1930s, some 900,000 French Canadians immigrated to the New England region. About half of them returned home. The generations born in the United States would eventually come to see themselves as Franco-Americans. During the same period of time, numerous French Canadians also migrated and settled in Eastern and Northern Ontario. The descendants of those Quebec inter-provincial migrants constitute the bulk of today&#x27;s Franco-Ontarian community.

Since 1968, French has been one of Canada&#x27;s two official languages. It is the sole official language of Quebec and one of the official languages of New Brunswick, Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. The province of Ontario has no official languages defined in law, although the provincial government provides French language services in many parts of the province under the &quot;French Language Services Act&quot;.

==Language==

There are many varieties of French spoken by francophone Canadians, for example Quebec French, Acadian French, Métis French, and Newfoundland French. The French spoken in Ontario, the Canadian West, and New England can trace their roots back to Quebec French because of Quebec&#x27;s diaspora. Over time, many regional accents have emerged. Canada is estimated to be home to between 32 and 36 regional French accents, 17 of which can be found in Quebec, and 7 of which are found in New Brunswick. There are also people who will naturally speak using &quot;Québécois Standard&quot; or Joual which are considered sociolects.

There are about seven million French Canadians and native French speakers in Quebec. Another one million French-speaking French Canadians are distributed throughout the rest of Canada. French Canadians may also speak Canadian English, especially if they live in overwhelmingly English-speaking environments. In Canada, not all those of French Canadian ancestry speak French, but the vast majority do. 

Francophones living in Canadian provinces other than Quebec have enjoyed minority language rights under Canadian law since the Official Languages Act of 1969, and under the Canadian Constitution since 1982, protecting them from provincial governments that have historically been indifferent towards their presence. At the provincial level, New Brunswick formally designates French as a full official language, while other provinces vary in the level of French language services they offer. All three of Canada&#x27;s territories include French as an official language of the territory alongside English and local indigenous languages, although in practice French-language services are normally available only in the capital cities and not across the entire territory.

== Religion ==
Catholicism is the chief denomination. The kingdom of France forbade non-Catholic settlement in New France from 1629 onward and thus, almost all French settlers of Canada were Catholic. In the United States, some families of French-Canadian origin have converted to Protestantism. Until the 1960s, religion was a central component of French-Canadian national identity. The Church parish was the focal point of civic life in French-Canadian society, and religious orders ran French-Canadian schools, hospitals and orphanages and were very influential in everyday life in general. During the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, however, the practice of Catholicism dropped drastically. Church attendance in Quebec currently remains low. Rates of religious observance among French Canadians outside Quebec tend to vary by region, and by age. In general, however, those in Quebec are the least observant, while those in the United States of America and other places away from Quebec tend to be the most observant.

== Geographical distribution ==

People who claim some French-Canadian ancestry or heritage number some 7 million in Canada. In the United States, 2.4 million people report French-Canadian ancestry or heritage, while an additional 8.4 million claim French ancestry; they are treated as a separate ethnic group by the U.S. Census Bureau.

=== Canada ===

In Canada, 85% of French Canadians reside in Quebec where they constitute the majority of the population in all regions except the far north (Nord-du-Québec). Most cities and villages in this province were built and settled by the French or French Canadians during the French colonial rule.

There are various urban and small centres in Canada outside Quebec that have long-standing populations of French Canadians, going back to the late 19th century, due to interprovincial migration. Eastern and Northern Ontario have large populations of francophones in communities such as Ottawa, Cornwall, Hawkesbury, Sudbury, Timmins, North Bay, Timiskaming, Welland and Windsor. Many also pioneered the Canadian Prairies in the late 18th century, founding the towns of Saint Boniface, Manitoba and in Alberta&#x27;s Peace Country, including the region of Grande Prairie.

It is estimated that roughly 70–75% of Quebec&#x27;s population descend from the French pioneers of the 17th and 18th century.

The French-speaking population have massively chosen the &quot;Canadian&quot; (&quot;&quot;Canadien&quot;) ethnic group since the government made it possible (1986), which has made the current statistics misleading. The term &quot;Canadien&quot; historically referred only to a French-speaker, though today it is used in French to describe any Canadian citizen.

=== United States ===
In the United States, many cities were founded as colonial outposts of New France by French or French-Canadian explorers. They include Mobile (Alabama), Coeur d&#x27;Alene (Idaho), Vincennes (Indiana), Belleville (Illinois), Bourbonnais (Illinois), Prairie du Rocher (Illinois), Dubuque (Iowa), Baton Rouge (Louisiana), New Orleans (Louisiana), Detroit (Michigan), Biloxi (Mississippi), Creve Coeur (Missouri), St. Louis (Missouri), Pittsburgh (Fort Duquesne, Pennsylvania), Provo (Utah), Green Bay (Wisconsin), La Crosse (Wisconsin), Milwaukee (Wisconsin) or Prairie du Chien (Wisconsin).

The majority of the French-Canadian population in the United States is found in the New England area, although there is also a large French-Canadian presence in Plattsburgh, New York, across Lake Champlain from Burlington, Vermont. Quebec and Acadian emigrants settled in industrial cities like Fitchburg, Leominster, Lynn, Worcester, Haverhill, Waltham, Lowell, Gardner, Lawrence, Chicopee, Somerset, Fall River, and New Bedford in Massachusetts; Woonsocket in Rhode Island; Manchester and Nashua in New Hampshire; Bristol, Hartford, and East Hartford in Connecticut; throughout the state of Vermont, particularly in Burlington, St. Albans, and Barre; and Biddeford and Lewiston in Maine. Smaller groups of French Canadians settled in the Midwest, notably in the states of Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and Minnesota. French Canadians also settled in central North Dakota, largely in Rolette and Bottineau counties, and in South Dakota.

Some Metis still speak Michif, a language influenced by French, and a mixture of other European and Native American tribal languages.

== Identities ==
=== Canada ===
French Canadians express their cultural or ancestral roots using a number of different terms. In the 2021 census, French-speaking Canadians identified their ethnicity, in order of prevalence, most often as Canadian, French, Québécois, French Canadian, and Acadian. All of these except for French were grouped together by Jantzen (2006) as &quot;French New World&quot; ancestries because they originate in Canada.

Jantzen (2006) distinguishes the English &quot;Canadian&quot;, meaning &quot;someone whose family has been in Canada for multiple generations&quot;, and the French &quot;Canadien&quot;, used to refer to descendants of the original settlers of New France in the 17th and 18th centuries. &quot;Canadien&quot; was used to refer to the French-speaking residents of New France beginning in the last half of the 17th century. The English-speaking residents who arrived later from Great Britain were called &quot;Anglais&quot;. This usage continued until Canadian Confederation in 1867. Confederation united several former British colonies into the Dominion of Canada, and from that time forward, the word &quot;Canadian&quot; has been used to describe both English-speaking and French-speaking citizens, wherever they live in the country.

Those reporting &quot;French New World&quot; ancestries overwhelmingly had ancestors that went back at least four generations in Canada. Fourth generation Canadiens and Québécois showed considerable attachment to their ethno-cultural group, with 70% and 61%, respectively, reporting a strong sense of belonging.

The generational profile and strength of identity of French New World ancestries contrast with those of British or Canadian ancestries, which represent the largest ethnic identities in Canada. Although deeply rooted Canadians express a deep attachment to their ethnic identity, most English-speaking Canadians of British or Canadian ancestry generally cannot trace their ancestry as far back in Canada as French speakers. As a result, their identification with their ethnicity is weaker: for example, only 50% of third generation &quot;Canadians&quot; strongly identify as such, bringing down the overall average. The survey report notes that 80% of Canadians whose families had been in Canada for three or more generations reported &quot;Canadian and provincial or regional ethnic identities&quot;. These identities include French New World ancestries such as &quot;Québécois&quot; (37% of Quebec population) and Acadian (6% of Atlantic provinces).

====Quebec====
Since the 1960s, French Canadians in Quebec have generally used &quot;Québécois&quot; (masculine) or &quot;Québécoise&quot; (feminine) to express their cultural and national identity, rather than &quot;Canadien français&quot; and &quot;Canadienne française&quot;. Francophones who self-identify as Québécois and do not have French-Canadian ancestry may not identify as &quot;French Canadian&quot; (&quot;Canadien&quot; or &quot;Canadien français&quot;), though the term &quot;French Canadian&quot; may by extension refer to natives of the province of Quebec or other parts of French Canada of foreign descent. Those who do have French or French-Canadian ancestry, but who support Quebec sovereignty, often find &quot;Canadien français&quot; to be archaic or even pejorative. This is a reflection of the strong social, cultural, and political ties that most Quebecers of French-Canadian origin, who constitute a majority of francophone Quebecers, maintain within Quebec. It has given Québécois an ambiguous meaning which has often played out in political issues, as all public institutions attached to the Government of Quebec refer to all Quebec citizens, regardless of their language or their cultural heritage, as Québécois.

Academic analysis of French Canadian culture has often focused on the degree to which the Quiet Revolution, particularly the shift in the social and cultural identity of the Québécois following the Estates General of French Canada of 1966 to 1969, did or did not create a &quot;rupture&quot; between the Québécois and other francophones elsewhere in Canada.

====Elsewhere in Canada====

The emphasis on the French language and Quebec autonomy means that French speakers across Canada may now self-identify as &quot;québécois(e)&quot;, &quot;acadien(ne)&quot;, or &quot;Franco-canadien(ne)&quot;, or as provincial linguistic minorities such as &quot;Franco-manitobain(e)&quot;, &quot;Franco-ontarien(ne)&quot; or &quot;fransaskois(e)&quot;. Education, health and social services are provided by provincial institutions, so that provincial identities are often used to identify French-language institutions:

*Franco-Newfoundlanders, province of Newfoundland and Labrador, also known as Terre-Neuvien(ne)
*Franco-Ontarians, province of Ontario, also referred to as Ontarien(ne)
*Franco-Manitobans, province of Manitoba, also referred to as Manitobain(e)
*Fransaskois, province of Saskatchewan, also referred to Saskois(e)
*Franco-Albertans, province of Alberta, also referred to Albertain(e)
*Franco-Columbians, province of British Columbia mostly live in the Vancouver metro area; also referred to as Franco-Colombien(ne)
*Franco-Yukonnais, territory of Yukon, also referred to as Yukonais(e)
*Franco-Ténois, territory of Northwest Territories, also referred to as Ténois(e)
*Franco-Nunavois, territory of Nunavut, also referred to as Nunavois(e)

Acadians residing in the provinces of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia represent a distinct ethnic French-speaking culture. This group&#x27;s culture and history evolved separately from the French Canadian culture, at a time when the Maritime Provinces were &quot;not&quot; part of what was referred to as Canada, and are consequently considered a distinct culture from French Canadians.

Brayons in Madawaska County, New Brunswick and Aroostook County, Maine may be identified with either the Acadians or the Québécois, or considered a distinct group in their own right, by different sources.

French Canadians outside Quebec are more likely to self-identify as &quot;French Canadian&quot;. Identification with provincial groupings varies from province to province, with Franco-Ontarians, for example, using their provincial label far more frequently than Franco-Columbians do. Few identify &quot;only&quot; with the provincial groupings, explicitly rejecting &quot;French Canadian&quot; as an identity label. A population genetics ancestry study claims that for those French Canadians who trace their ancestry to the French founder population, a significant percentage, 53-78% have at least one indigenous ancestor.

===United States===
During the mid-18th century, French Canadian explorers and colonists colonized other parts of North America in what are today Louisiana (called &quot;Louisianais&quot;), Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, far northern New York and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as well as around Detroit. They also founded such cities as New Orleans and St. Louis and villages in the Mississippi Valley. French Canadians later emigrated in large numbers from Canada to the United States between the 1840s and the 1930s in search of economic opportunities in border communities and industrialized portions of New England. French-Canadian communities in the United States remain along the Quebec border in Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire, as well as further south in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. There is also a significant community of French Canadians in South Florida, particularly Hollywood, Florida, especially during the winter months. The wealth of Catholic churches named after St. Louis throughout New England is indicative of the French immigration to the area. They came to identify as Franco-American, especially those who were born American.

Distinctions between French Canadian, natives of France, and other New World French identities is more blurred in the U.S. than in Canada, but those who identify as French Canadian or Franco American generally do not regard themselves as French. Rather, they identify culturally, historically, and ethnically with the culture that originated in Quebec that is differentiated from French culture. In &quot;L&#x27;Avenir du français aux États-Unis&quot;, Calvin Veltman and Benoît Lacroix found that since the French language has been so widely abandoned in the United States, the term &quot;French Canadian&quot; has taken on an ethnic rather than linguistic meaning.

French Canadian identities are influenced by historical events that inform regional cultures. For example, in New England, the relatively recent immigration (19th/20th centuries) is informed by experiences of language oppression and an identification with certain occupations, such as the mill workers. In the Great Lakes, many French Canadians also identify as Métis and trace their ancestry to the earliest voyageurs and settlers; many also have ancestry dating to the lumber era and often a mixture of the two groups.

The main Franco-American regional identities are:
* French Canadians:
** French Canadians of the Great Lakes (including Muskrat French)
** New England French
* Creoles:
** Missouri French (and other people of French ancestry in the former Illinois Country)
** Louisiana Creoles (who speak Colonial French)
* Cajuns

== Culture ==
=== Agriculture ===
Traditionally, Canadiens had a subsistence agriculture in Eastern Canada (Québec). This subsistence agriculture slowly evolved in dairy farm during the end of the 19th century and the beginning of 20th century while retaining the subsistence side. By 1960, agriculture changed toward an industrial agriculture. French Canadians have selectively bred distinct livestock over the centuries, including cattle, horses and chickens.

<doc id="144746" wikidata="Q2610252" url="?curid=144746" title="Inchcolm Abbey">
<text>Inchcolm Abbey is a medieval abbey located on the island of Inchcolm in the Firth of Forth in Scotland. The Abbey, which is located at the centre of the island, was founded in the 12th century during the episcopate of Gregoir, Bishop of Dunkeld. Later tradition placed it even earlier, in the reign of King Alexander I of Scotland (1107–24), who had taken shelter on Incholm when his ship was forced ashore during a storm in 1123. It is said he resided there for three days with the Hermit of Incholm.

The Abbey was first used as a priory by Augustinian canons regular, becoming a full abbey in 1235. The island was attacked by the English from 1296 onwards, and the Abbey was abandoned after the Scottish Reformation in 1560. It has since been used for defensive purposes, as it is situated in a strategically important position in the middle of the Firth of Forth. A Latin inscription carved above the Abbey&#x27;s entrance reads:

Translated, it has been rendered thus:
Inchcolm Abbey has the most complete surviving remains of any Scottish monastic house. The cloisters, chapter house, warming house, and refectory are all complete, and most of the remaining claustral buildings survive in a largely complete state. The least well-preserved part of the complex is the monastic church. The ruins are cared for by Historic Environment Scotland, which also maintains a visitor centre near the landing pier (entrance charge; ferry from South Queensferry).

In July 1581 stones from the abbey were taken to Edinburgh to repair the Tolbooth.

Among the Abbots of Inchcolm was the 15th-century chronicler Walter Bower.

==Inchcolm Antiphoner==
The Abbey gives its name to the 14th-century manuscript referred to as the Inchcolm Antiphoner. It contains one of the few remaining examples of Celtic Plainchant. Pages of the Antiphoner can be accessed online in facsimile from the University of Edinburgh.

The Antiphoner contains a substantial number of chants dedicated to Saint Columba. While these may derive from a variety of other monastic foundations with Columban associations, such as Oronsay Priory or Iona, Inchcolm is considered the most likely source of the manuscript&#x27;s compilation, if not composition.

==Fictional Settings==
*William Shakespeare referenced Incholm Abbey in his play &quot;Macbeth&quot;, 1606.
*William Clinkenbeard wrote the novel &quot;The Battle of Incholm Abbey&quot;, 2012.

<doc id="144749" wikidata="Q1018540" url="?curid=144749" title="Leith">
<text>Leith (; ) is a port area in the north of Edinburgh, Scotland, founded at the mouth of the Water of Leith and is home to the Port of Leith.

The earliest surviving historical references are in the royal charter authorising the construction of Holyrood Abbey in 1128 in which it is termed &quot;Inverlet&quot; (Inverleith). After centuries of control by Edinburgh, Leith was made a separate burgh in 1833 only to be merged into Edinburgh in 1920.

Leith is located on the southern coast of the Firth of Forth and lies within the City of Edinburgh council area; since 2007 it has formed one of 17 multi-member wards of the city.

==History==
As the major port serving Edinburgh, Leith has seen many significant events in Scottish history.

===First settlement===
The earliest evidence of settlement in Leith comes from several archaeological digs undertaken in The Shore area in the late 20th century. Amongst the finds were medieval wharf edges from the 12th century. This date fits with the earliest documentary evidence of settlement in Leith, the foundation charter of Holyrood Abbey.

Mary of Guelders, the bride of James II, arrived on 18 May 1449 and rested in the Convent of St Anthony. Prominent Leith merchants and shipowners included James Makysone, who supplied tapestry to James IV in 1498 for his new lodging at Stirling Castle and in 1503 imported a timber keel from France for building one of the king&#x27;s ships.

===1500s===
The town was burnt by the Earl of Hertford (on the orders of Henry VIII) in retaliation for the rejection of the Treaty of Greenwich by the Parliament of Scotland in 1543. Mary of Guise ruled Scotland from Leith in 1560 as Regent while her daughter, Mary, Queen of Scots remained in France. Mary of Guise moved the Scottish Court to Leith, to a site that is now Parliament Street, off Coalhill. According to the 18th-century historian William Maitland, her palace was situated on Rotten Row, now Water Street. Artifacts from the demolished residence are held by the National Museum of Scotland, and her sculptured coat of arms, dated 1560, can be seen in South Leith Parish Church. When the large French garrison stationed in Leith was attacked by Scottish Protestant lords, reinforced by troops and artillery sent from England, Mary of Guise was forced to shut herself in Edinburgh Castle. In June 1560, Mary of Guise died, and the Siege of Leith ended with the departure of the French troops in accordance with the Treaty of Leith, also known as the Treaty of Edinburgh.

Two mounds on Leith Links, known as &quot;Giant&#x27;s Brae&quot; and &quot;Lady Fyfe&#x27;s Brae&quot;, identified as Somerset&#x27;s Battery and Pelham&#x27;s Battery respectively, are believed to be artillery mounds created for the siege in April 1560 and are listed as scheduled monuments, but may be natural hillocks. The best documented day of the siege was 7 May 1560, when the English and Scots charged the walls of Leith with ladders that turned out to be too short. John Knox records the delight of Mary of Guise at the failure of the attack, and English sources report 1000 casualties.

On 19 August 1561, Mary, Queen of Scots, arrived in Leith and, finding no welcoming party to receive her, made a brief stop at the house of Andrew Lamb, before being collected and escorted by coach to Holyrood Palace, to begin her ill-fated six-year-long reign. Mary&#x27;s court came to the sands of Leith to enjoy equestrian tournaments of &quot;running at the ring&quot; performed by courtiers and diplomats in exotic costumes.
After the abdication of Mary Queen of Scots in 1567, during the ensuing civil war, troops fighting for James VI of Scotland against his mother&#x27;s supporters in Edinburgh Castle based themselves in Leith from 1571 to 1573, a period called the &quot;Wars between Leith and Edinburgh&quot;. In January 1581 The Shore was the scene of a mock combat, involving an assault on the Pope&#x27;s Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo built on boats, for the marriage of Elizabeth Stuart, 2nd Countess of Moray and James Stewart for the entertainment of guests including James VI. In 1590, James&#x27;s wife, Anne of Denmark, was lodged in the King&#x27;s Wark when she arrived.

===1600s===
In 1622 there was conflict between privateer &quot;Dunkirker ships&quot; flying the Spanish flag and ships from the Dutch Republic. King James allowed a Dunkirker to lie at Leith Roads in June 1622, and soldiers from the ship were able to come ashore at Leith. Three Dutch ships, commanded by Willem de Zoete, Lord of Hautain, Admiral of Zeeland, arrived and attacked the Dunkirker through the night. The fighting stopped in the morning when the tide beached the ships. The Scottish authorities requested the fighting stop. The ships were allowed into Leith harbour where artillery from Edinburgh Castle was placed to ensure order.

Leith suffered during the 1645 plague outbreak, with over 50% of the population in the southern district dying. Archaeological excavations in 2016 at St Mary&#x27;s RC Primary School, by Wardell Armstrong, as part of a planning condition, found a mass grave of 81 bodies from the 1645 plague. The archaeologists surmised that there was extreme fear of dying from this plague, likely Pneumonic, as many of the bodies were hastily buried in their clothes and still had money and other personal items on them, indicating that people did not want to touch the bodies, even to remove money.

In 1650, Leith was a prospective battleground when the Army of the Covenant, led by General David Leslie, threw up an earthen rampart between Calton Hill and Leith to defend the northern approach to Edinburgh against Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s forces. This rampart became the line of one of Edinburgh&#x27;s longest streets, Leith Walk. After Cromwell&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Dunbar in 1650 and subsequent occupation of Scotland, a fort known as &quot;Leith Citadel&quot; was erected in 1656 to regulate the port traffic. All that remains of the fort today is a vaulted trance in Dock Street which was its main entrance. New industry in Leith included the Leith Sugar House, founded in 1677.

===1700s===

During the American War of Independence the Scot, John Paul Jones, who, with John Barry, is credited as founder of the US Navy, set sail on 14 August 1779 as commodore of a squadron of seven ships with the intention of destroying British commerce in the North Sea. He intended to capture the port of Leith and hold it for ransom, but his plan was thwarted when a gale on 16 September kept him at the mouth of the Firth of Forth. The scare he caused led to the hasty erection of Leith Fort, with a battery of nine guns, designed by James Craig, the architect of Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town, and built in 1780. A Georgian terrace to the north-east served as officers&#x27; quarters, and was known as &quot;London Row&quot; because, being brick-built, it looked more like a London terrace than any in Edinburgh. The fort was in active use until 1955, latterly serving for National Service training. Most of the barracks were demolished to build a Council housing scheme centred on Fort House and enclosed by the old fort walls. The council development was an award-winning scheme in its day (1955), but the building was demolished in January 2013 and the site has been redeveloped with new low-density housing, again award-winning. A pair of the old fort&#x27;s gatehouses survive at the southern entrance to the scheme.

From the twelfth century South Leith was part of the parish of Restalrig and had no church of its own. After the Scottish Reformation the principal parish kirk for Leith was South Leith Parish Church, originally constructed in 1483. In June 1811 a census gave the population of South Leith as 15,938; North Leith 4,875. With a procession and ceremony, the foundation stone of the new church for the parish of North Leith was laid on 11 April 1814.


Leith was the port of entry for the visit of King George IV to Scotland, and &quot;The Old Ship Hotel and King&#x27;s Landing&quot; was then given its new name, to mark the king&#x27;s arrival by ship&#x27;s boat at Leith &quot;Shore&quot; for this event, and this monarch was welcomed by the High Constabulary of the Port of Leith. A painting of the occasion hung in Leith Town Hall, now Leith Police station.

===1800s===
On 20 May 1806, there was a procession of the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, Baillies, and Council, along with a numerous company of ladies and gentleman, for the opening of the first new wet dock, the first of its kind in Scotland. The Fife packet called &quot;The Buccleuch&quot; was the first to enter the dock, with the civic dignitaries on board, amid discharges of artillery from the fort and His Majesty&#x27;s warships in Leith Roads. The foundation stone for the second (middle) wet dock was laid on 14 March 1811, which was completed and opened with due ceremony in 1817 by Lord Provost Arbuthnot. The same year the Trinity House in Kirkgate was erected in Grecian architectural style at an expense of £2500.

In 1809, the Tally Toor, a martello tower was constructed to defend the entrance of the harbour during the Napoleonic Wars. It is now a scheduled monument within the port.
Historically Leith was governed by the Town Council of Edinburgh, with separately organised baillies appointed by various bodies without contact with each other. The result became very unsatisfactory, and half of Leith was provided with no municipal government whatever or any local magistrates. An act of Parliament, the (7 &amp; 8 Geo. 4. c. cxii) arranged for municipal government and administration of justice in the town, providing watching, paving, cleansing, and lighting, with Edinburgh Council responding to the views of Leith townspeople. The Burgh Reform Act 1833 (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. 46) made Leith a parliamentary burgh, which jointly with Portobello and Musselburgh was represented by one Member of Parliament (MP). On 1 November 1833, Leith became a separate municipal burgh, with its own provost, magistrates, and council, and was no longer run by bailies. Historically the Lord Provost of Edinburgh was &quot;virtue officii&quot; Admiral of the Firth of Forth, the Provost of Leith was Admiral of the port, and his four bailies were admirals-depute.

Emperor Nicholas II of Russia arrived by sea at Leith with his family and suite on Tuesday 22 September 1896. Scottish anarchist Thomas Hastie Bell managed to get in his face to criticise him.

===1900s and 2000s===
Leith was the scene of the dockers strike in 1913 recounted in the book &quot;Red Scotland&quot;.

Continued growth meant that Leith and Edinburgh formed a contiguous urban area. Leith was merged with Edinburgh on 1 November 1920 despite a plebiscite in which the people of Leith voted 26,810 to 4,340 against the merger. The population of Leith at the time of the merger was 80,000, representing 20% of the entire population of Edinburgh in around 5% of the city area, reflecting the town&#x27;s high density. It was Scotland&#x27;s sixth largest town at the time of the merger.

Until 1923 there was no through tram service between Leith and Edinburgh; at the boundary in Leith Walk it was necessary to change from a Leith tram (electrically powered) to an Edinburgh tram (cable hauled) until the electrification of the Edinburgh Corporation Tramways in the early 1920s. Leith has undergone significant regeneration and is now a busy port with visits from cruise liners and the home of the Royal Yacht Britannia, the Ocean Terminal shopping centre, and administrative offices for several departments of the Scottish Government. The council and government&#x27;s &#x27;Leith Project&#x27; provided a further economic boost. The shore area of Leith, once unattractive, is now a centre for a range of new pubs and restaurants in charming surroundings. On 6 November 2003, Leith was the location for the MTV Europe Music Awards, with a temporary venue being built next to Ocean Terminal.

==Traditional industries==
Leith was Scotland&#x27;s leader in several industries for many centuries. Of these the most notable are:

* Glass – the Leith Glassworks stood on Baltic Street and dated from 1746. There is also some reference to earlier glass production from 1682 at Leith Citadel. Leith specialised in wine bottles, largely for export to France and Spain. At its peak () production was one million bottles per week. The Leith pattern bottle is the parallel-sided, round shouldered, narrow neck bottle now dominant within the wine industry. Around 1770 the company branched into lead crystal glass, mainly for chandeliers. This was under a new company name of the Edinburgh Crystal Company but stood on the same site in Leith (ironically this company has never truly been in &quot;Edinburgh&quot;).
* Soap – the Anchor Soapworks was established on Water Street around 1680. This largely used whale oil in its production. This survived until around 1930.

* Wine and whisky storage – wine storage in Leith dates from at least the early 16th century, notably being connected with the Vaults on Henderson Street from this time. At its peak there were around 100 warehouses storing wine and brandy. In the late 1880s, due to the collapse of wine harvest in Europe, most of these were &quot;converted&quot; for the storage of whisky used in the growing business of whisky blending and bottling. Important in this business were William Sanderson with Vat 69, John Crabbie who also produced green ginger wine, and Macdonald &amp; Muir who later bought the Glenmorangie distillery. Around 85 bonded warehouses stood in Leith in the 1960s. The last bond, on Water Street, closed around 1995. An offshoot to the wine industry were several vinegar works.
* Lime juice – Rose&#x27;s lime juice was founded by Lachlan Rose in Leith on Commercial Street in 1868. This was originally and primarily focussed upon provision of vitamin C to seamen.
* Shipbuilding – originally centred on the Water of Leith and limited in scale due to the shallow water, Leith&#x27;s shipbuilding started to fade as vessels increased in size. Latterly Leith built specialised ship types: tugs, hotel ships, cable-layers etc. Whilst the most notable large shipyard (Henry Robb&#x27;s) closed in 1983, this was technically outlived by a very small shipbuilder on Sheriff Brae (run by the Scottish Co-operative Society) which closed around 1988. The most notable ships built in Leith are the SS &quot;Sirius&quot;, one of the first steamships to cross the Atlantic, and SS &quot;Copenhagen&quot;, one of the largest rigged ships ever built. Robb&#x27;s yard also made a great contribution to the RN and MN during the Second World War, building forty-two vessels for the Royal Navy, fourteen merchant ships and refitted and repaired nearly 3,000 ships of the Royal Navy and Merchant Navy. This means that one new ship was launched on an average every six weeks and a ship repaired every day of this long and bloody conflict. The RN list included Flower and Castle Class Corvettes and River, Loch and Bay Class Frigates.

* Lead – Scotland&#x27;s largest leadworks stood on the corner of Mitchell Street and Constitution Street. Founded around 1760 the operational part worked until the 1970s and the empty buildings stood until the late 1980s. The offices, on Constitution Street, still survive. The company specialised in lead pipes for water supply and lead drainpipes. They also produced lead sheet for roofing and lead shot for weapons.
* Sugar refining was developed at the Leith Sugar House by Robert Douglas, an established soap boiler, from 1677.
* Whaling – originally focussed on local, and Icelandic waters (the last whale in the Firth of Forth was caught in 1834); by the mid 19th century ships were travelling to the Antarctic. In the early 1900s, the Christian Salvesen company developed significant interests in whaling, initially in the Arctic, and then in the Antarctic. Among their many whaling stations in the South Atlantic, they established and operated from a base on the island of South Georgia, south east of the Falkland Islands at Leith Harbour (named for their base in Scotland). South Georgia later came to fame at the beginning of the Falklands War). The company moved from Leith to the Fettes area of Edinburgh around 1980 and then left Edinburgh altogether in the mid-1990s. The founder, Christian Salvesen is buried in Rosebank Cemetery. Whaling ships from Leith brought the very first penguins to Edinburgh Zoo around 1900.
* Corn trading – A Corn Exchange was erected in Constitution Street in 1861.
* Fishing – During the 19th century Leith became an important entrepôt for the Scottish herring trade, with exports peaking at 388,899 barrels in 1907.

==Geography==

After decades of industrial decline, deindustrialisation, slum clearance and resultant depopulation in the post-war era, Leith gradually began to enjoy an upturn in fortunes in the late 1980s. Several old industrial sites were developed with modest, affordable housing, while small industrial business units were constructed at Swanfield, Bonnington, Seafield and off Lindsay Road. The Shore developed a clutch of upmarket restaurants, including the first of the chain of Malmaison hotels in a conversion of a seamen&#x27;s mission, whilst the once industrially-polluted and desolate banks of the Water of Leith were cleaned up and a public walkway opened.

Leith&#x27;s gradual revival was also helped by the decision of the then Scottish Office to site their new offices in Leith Docks (just north of the old infilled East Dock). The site was chosen as part of a design-and-build competition against other sites at Haymarket and Marionville. It was completed in 1994. The hoped-for influx of well-paid civil service jobs failed to have much local impact as most commute to the office, and only a small percentage venture beyond the confines of the office during lunchtimes. It did further foster Leith&#x27;s growing reputation as a white-collar, small business location. Further large-scale service and tourist development followed, including Ocean Terminal and the permanently moored Royal Yacht Britannia.

The Edinburgh Trams light rail line extension, from the city centre to Newhaven opened to passengers in June 2023 providing Leith and the new dock developments with a fast and convenient route for both local commuters and visitors.
In 2004 the owner of the docks, Forth Ports, announced plans to eventually close the port and carry out a major redevelopment of the area. The planned development, which was given supplementary planning guidance by the City of Edinburgh Council in 2004, was a small town with up to 17,000 new homes.

===Area===
One of the areas is Timber Bush which was originally used as a timber market.

Until its amalgamation with Edinburgh in 1920, the southern-most town border was the middle of Pilrig Street.

Expansion in the Georgian era gave rise to streets such as Queen Charlotte Street, named after Charlotte, the consort of George III.

==Religion==
Historically, due its Catholic connections (and French garrison), Leith was one of the last towns to have Catholic sympathies post-Reformation. Although the preceptory (small monastery) of St Anthony&#x27;s was destroyed soon after 1560 the other churches were quickly adapted to Protestant use. There was also an Episcopalian meeting house near Kapple&#x27;s Wynd (later renamed Cables Wynd) from 1688, somewhat inexplicably called the John Knox Church. The church was active from 1688 and was last used by a visit of John Wesley but the huge crowd he drew was too large to fit.

Leith still has several notable historic churches, including North Leith Parish Church and South Leith Parish Church (both of the Church of Scotland), and the Roman Catholic St Mary&#x27;s Star of the Sea. The area has Sikh and Hindu temples, a Shia imambargah, a Sunni mosque and community centre, a Pentecostal centre and a Ukrainian Greek Catholic church. It also has a former Norwegian church, which is home now to the Leith School of Art.

As of 2011 (the most recent Census for which data is available), the religious composition of Leith was as follows:

==Transport==
A regular stage coach service ran between Bernard Street and Edinburgh&#x27;s Old Town from the mid-18th century. By 1863 this had become a horse-drawn omnibus running every 5 minutes from 9am to 10pm. This was put on tracks sometime around 1880 effectively then becoming a horse-drawn tram. Leith was the first town in Scotland to electrify its tram system (1905). Leith Corporation Tramways were merged into Edinburgh Corporation Tramways as part of the 1920 merger of the two burgh councils. Tram services ran until 1956 and were then replaced by buses due to the contemporary perception of their greater flexibility.

In the mid-19th century the railways came. Leith had one horse-drawn line pre-dating steam-trains, bringing coal from Dalkeith to a station at the north end of Constitution Street, to serve the glassworks there. This dated from the late 18th century. Steam trains arrived in the 1840s, being some of the earliest lines in Britain. When the railways were at their height, Leith had four passenger stations and many goods stations. However, in the 1960s, the Beeching report recommended the closure of almost all of Leith&#x27;s railway infrastructure. Today, only one freight line that connects to the dock remains in use.

Although there are no longer any passenger rail services serving Leith, two station buildings partially remain:

* Leith Central, on the corner of Leith Walk and Duke Street. The station clock, offices and public house (Central Bar) remain.
* Leith Citadel, on Commercial Street. The building is now a youth centre.

The SS &quot;Sirius&quot; (built in Leith) beat the SS &quot;Great Western&quot; by one day in being the first steamship to cross the Atlantic but, as a much smaller ship, was eclipsed by the press coverage given to the larger ship. Leith offered ferry services to many European ports, including Hamburg and Oslo.

Today, Leith is served by various bus services provided by Lothian Buses and a tram service provided by Edinburgh Trams. This tram service was due to serve Leith in 2011, however, due to construction and funding issues, the section of the line towards Leith and Newhaven was delayed. It opened just after midday on 7 June 2023 with Leith stops at Balfour Street (Leith Walk), Foot of the Walk (Constitution Street), The Shore (Constitution Street), Port of Leith and Ocean Terminal.

==Culture and community==

Leith has a long history of pioneering social advances, some of which were the first of their kind in Scotland:

All boys were educated for free from 1555 onwards. This was paid for by the local trade guilds. All girls were educated from 1820, a long time after the boys, but a very early example of free education for females (only required by law from 1876). A free hospital service was provided from 1777, paid for by a local tax, with beds sponsored by local shops. Leith had electric street lighting from 1890 and electric trams from 1905 (only Blackpool was earlier in the UK). The first public sewer in Scotland was built in Bernard Street in 1780; this flowed into the Water of Leith.

Leith was formerly a port linked to the trade of the Hanseatic League.

Leith is also home to The Queen&#x27;s former floating Royal residence, the Royal Yacht Britannia, now a five-star visitor attraction and evening events venue permanently berthed at the Ocean Terminal shopping centre.

Leith was named as the fourth &quot;coolest neighbourhood in the world&quot; by &quot;Time Out&quot; in 2021.

The Port of Leith distillery, is the United Kingdom&#x27;s only vertical whisky distillery.

===Educational establishments===
Leith is home to Leith Academy, one of the oldest schools in Scotland, and to the Leith School of Art, which along with Glasgow School of Art is one of only two independent art schools in Scotland.

From 1855 until 1987, Leith Nautical College provided training for Merchant Navy seafarers in Scotland.

===Media and art===
Festivals occur throughout the year, including Leith Festival, Leith Late festival, PLU Parents Like Us and the Edinburgh Mela on Leith Links, part of the Edinburgh Festival since 2010. The Leith Gala, now known as Leith Festival Gala Day is an annual event that has taken place since 1907; it was originally a charity event to raise sponsorship for local hospital beds before the National Health came into place. It has developed into the community-based Leith Festival.

Leith houses a notable number of cultural arts studios and small independent businesses, including the Leith Theatre on Ferry Road, Leith School of Art in North Junction Street, WASP Studios by The Shore and Out of the Blue in the former Dalmeny Street drill hall.

Leith FM (later renamed Castle FM) started as a week-long RSL station during the late 1990s, linked to Leith Festival. A few years of annual 28-day broadcasts later, the station bid for and won a permanent community radio licence and broadcast for several years on 98.8 FM and online. In December 2013, Leith Dockers Club locked the station out of its rented premises, due to the &quot;substantial&quot; debt it was owed by the station, and the future of the station is currently in doubt.

===In popular culture===
Scottish folk rock duo The Proclaimers titled their second album &quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot; after the town, including the eponymous track. This spawned a musical of the same name that included music from The Proclaimers, which itself had a film adaptation in 2013.

Irvine Welsh had his Channel 4 drama &quot;Wedding Belles&quot; (2007) filmed in Henderson Street. Welsh&#x27;s novel &quot;Trainspotting&quot; and its prequel, &quot;Skagboys&quot; concern a group of drug users living in the Leith area in the 1980s.

The BBC drama &quot;Guilt&quot; is set in Leith, with filming locations including the Eastern Cemetery. The show is written by Neil Forsyth, a former Leith resident and stars Mark Bonnar and Jamie Sives both of whom attended Leith Academy.

The BBC Radio 4 drama series &quot;McLevy&quot; features stories loosely based upon the historical figure James McLevy who operated in Leith crime hotspots amongst other locations in Edinburgh.

==Sport==
Leith is the home of Hibernian Football Club which is a member of the Scottish Premiership.

Leith Athletic Football Club have been part of Leith&#x27;s sporting culture since their foundation in 1887 until closure in 1955. Reformed in 1996 they amalgamated with Edinburgh Athletic in 2008 and achieved promotion to the East of Scotland Premier Division in 2011. They host home games at Peffermill 3G.

Leith Links have been used a sports and recreation area over many centuries.

Leith is significant in the historical development of the rules of golf, as the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers played there before moving to Musselburgh Links and later Muirfield. The official rules of golf, initially formulated at Leith in 1744, were later adopted by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. The only difference introduced with those rules (which remain the rules of golf) was the omission of one rule to do with hazards such as trenches.

From at least 1600 until 1816, Leith Races were held on Leith Sands, an area immediately north of the present Links and now built over. They were long regarded as one of Scotland&#x27;s most important horse race meetings before racing moved to Musselburgh permanently from 1816 onwards.

Leith Links also have one of the longest established cricket pitches in Scotland, from 1820.

The Leith Victoria Swim Centre on Junction Place opened in 1899.

<text>Water transport played a vital role in the UK&#x27;s industrial development. The beginning of the 19th century saw a move from roads to waterways, (i.e. canals, rivers, firths, and estuaries).

==Rivers in the United Kingdom==

Major navigable rivers include the Humber, Mersey, Yorkshire Ouse, Severn, Thames and Trent. Some minor navigable rivers may be classified as canals. Others include the Warwickshire Avon, the Bristol Avon.

There are also the subterranean rivers of London, and the Jubilee River, which, although man-made, was designed to look and act like a natural river rather than a canal.

==Canals in the United Kingdom==
The canals of the United Kingdom are a major part of the network of inland waterways. They are used for irrigation and transport and were a key part of the Industrial Revolution. Today, they are also used for recreational boating.

<doc id="144752" wikidata="Q205947" url="?curid=144752" title="Claudian">
<text>Claudius Claudianus, known in English as Claudian (Greek: Κλαυδιανός; ), was a Latin poet associated with the court of the Roman emperor Honorius at Mediolanum (Milan), and particularly with the general Stilicho. His work, written almost entirely in hexameters or elegiac couplets, falls into three main categories: poems for Honorius, poems for Stilicho, and mythological epic.

==Life==
Claudian was born in Alexandria. He arrived in Rome in 394 and made his mark as a court poet with a eulogy of his two young patrons, Probinus and Olybrius, consuls of 395. He wrote a number of panegyrics on the consulship of his patrons, praise poems for the deeds of the general Stilicho, and invectives directed at Stilicho&#x27;s rivals in the Eastern court of Arcadius.

Little is known about his personal life, but it seems he was a convinced pagan: Augustine refers to him as &quot;foreign to the name of Christ&quot; (&quot;Civitas Dei&quot;, V, 26), and Paul Orosius describes him as an &quot;obstinate pagan&quot; (&quot;paganus pervicacissimus&quot;) in his &quot;Adversus paganos historiarum libri septem&quot; (VII, 55).

He was well rewarded for his political engagement, being granted the rank of &quot;vir illustris&quot;. The Roman Senate honored him with a statue in the Roman Forum in 400. Stilicho&#x27;s wife, Serena, secured a rich wife for him.

Scholars assume Claudian died in 404, for none of his poems record the achievements of Stilicho after that year. His works give no account of the sack of Rome, while the writings of Olympiodorus of Thebes have been edited and made known only in few fragments, which begin from the death of Stilicho.

==As poet==
Although a native speaker of Greek, Claudian is one of the best Latin poetry stylists of late antiquity. He is not usually ranked among the top tier of Latin poets, but his writing is elegant, he tells a story well, and his polemical passages occasionally attain an unmatchable level of entertaining vitriol. The literature of his time is generally characterized by a quality modern critics find specious, of which Claudian&#x27;s work is not free, and some find him cold and unfeeling.

Claudian&#x27;s poetry is a valuable historical source, though distorted by the conventions of panegyric. The historical or political poems connected with Stilicho have a manuscript tradition separate from the rest of his work, an indication that they were likely published as an independent collection, perhaps by Stilicho himself after Claudian&#x27;s death.

His most important non-political work is an unfinished epic, &quot;De raptu Proserpinae&quot; (&quot;The Abduction of Proserpina&quot;). The three extant books are believed to have been written in 395 and 397. In the 20th and early 21st centuries, Claudian has not been among the most popular Latin poets of antiquity, but the epic &quot;De raptu&quot; influenced painting and poetry for centuries.

<text>The Tactical High-Energy Laser, or THEL, was a laser developed for military use, also known as the Nautilus laser system. The mobile version is the Mobile Tactical High-Energy Laser, or MTHEL. In 1996, the United States and Israel entered into an agreement to produce a cooperative THEL called the Demonstrator, which would utilize deuterium fluoride chemical laser technologies. In 2000 and 2001, THEL shot down 28 Katyusha artillery rockets and five artillery shells. On November 4, 2002, THEL shot down an incoming artillery shell. The prototype weapon was roughly the size of six city buses, made up of modules that held a command center, radar and a telescope for tracking targets, the chemical laser itself, fuel and reagent tanks, and a rotating mirror to reflect its beam toward speeding targets. It was discontinued in 2005.

== History ==
On July 18, 1996, the United States and Israel entered into an agreement to produce a cooperative Tactical High Energy Laser (THEL), called the Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrator, which would utilize deuterium fluoride chemical laser technologies. Primary among the four contractors awarded the project on September 30, 1996 was Northrop Grumman (formerly TRW). THEL conducted test firing in FY1998, and Initial Operating Capability (IOC) was planned in FY1999. However, this was significantly delayed due to reorienting the project as a mobile, not fixed, design, called Mobile Tactical High Energy Laser (MTHEL). The original fixed location design eliminates most weight, size and power restrictions, but is not compatible with the fluid, mobile nature of modern combat. The initial MTHEL goal was a mobile version the size of three large semi trailers. Ideally it would be further downsized to a single semi trailer size. However, doing this while maintaining the original performance characteristics is difficult. Furthermore, the Israeli government, which had been providing significant funding, decreased their financial support in 2004, postponing the IOC date to at least 2010.

In 2000 and 2001 THEL shot down 28 Katyusha artillery rockets and five artillery shells.

On November 4, 2002, THEL shot down an incoming artillery shell. A mobile version completed successful testing. During a test conducted on August 24, 2004 the system successfully shot down multiple mortar rounds. The test represented actual mortar threat scenarios. Targets were intercepted by the THEL testbed and destroyed. Both single mortar rounds and salvo were tested. Many military experts, such as the former head of the Administration for the Development of Weapons and the Technological Industry, Aluf Yitzhak Ben Yisrael, considered THEL to be a success and called for its implementation. However, in 2005, the US and Israel decided to discontinue developing the THEL after the project budget had surpassed $300 million. The decision came as a result of &quot;its bulkiness, high costs and poor anticipated results on the battlefield.&quot; During the 2006 Lebanon War, Ben Yisrael, currently the chairman of the Israeli Space Agency, renewed his calls to implement the THEL against high-trajectory fire.

In 2007, Ehud Barak requested to reconsider project Skyguard (the next phase of THEL) in order to fight Qassam attacks.

<doc id="144756" wikidata="Q1130250" url="?curid=144756" title="Succotash">
<text>Succotash is a North American vegetable dish consisting primarily of sweet corn with lima beans or other shell beans. The name &quot;succotash&quot; is derived from the Narragansett word , which means &quot;broken corn kernels&quot;. Other ingredients may be added, such as onions, potatoes, turnips, tomatoes, bell peppers, corned beef, salt pork, or okra. Combining a grain with a legume provides a dish that is high in all essential amino acids.

== History ==
Succotash has a long history. It is believed to have been an invention of indigenous peoples in what is now known as New England, though English soldier and explorer Jonathan Carver attributed it to numerous tribes of eastern North America:One dish however, which answers nearly the same purpose as bread, is in use among the Ottagaumies, the Saukies, and the more eastern nations, where Indian corn grows, which is not only much esteemed by them, but it is reckoned extremely palatable by all the Europeans who enter their dominions. This is composed of their unripe corn as before described, and beans in the same state, boiled together with bears flesh, the fat of which moistens the pulse, and renders it beyond comparison delicious. They call this food Succatosh.British colonists adapted the dish as a stew in the 17th century. Composed of ingredients unknown in Europe at the time, it gradually became a standard meal in the cuisine of New England and is a traditional dish of many Thanksgiving celebrations in the region, as well as in Pennsylvania and other states. 

Because of the relatively inexpensive and more readily available ingredients, the dish was popular during the Great Depression in the United States. It was sometimes cooked in a casserole form, often with a light pie crust on top as in a traditional pot pie.

After the abolition of slavery in the United States, freed slaves in the American South returned to Africa and introduced the dish to the region.

== Preparation ==
Sweet corn (a form of maize), American beans, tomatoes, and peppers (all New World foods) are the usual ingredients.

Catherine Beecher&#x27;s 19th-century recipe includes beans boiled with corn cobs from which the kernels have been removed. The kernels are added later, after the beans have boiled for several hours. The corn cobs are removed and the finished stew, in proportions of two parts corn to one part beans, is thickened with flour. 

Henry Ward Beecher&#x27;s recipe, published in an 1846 issue of &quot;Western Farmer and Gardner&quot;, adds salt pork, which he says is &quot;an essential part of the affair.&quot;

In some parts of the American South, any mixture of vegetables prepared with lima beans and topped with lard or butter is considered succotash.

==In popular culture==
* Sylvester the Cat&#x27;s trademark exclamation is &quot;Thufferin&#x27; thuccotash!&quot; Daffy Duck has also been known to use the line on occasion.
* Professional wrestler Roman Reigns infamously used the phrase &quot;suffering succotash&quot; during a promo on a 2015 episode of SmackDown .
* The Dee-Lite song &quot;Groove is in the Heart&quot; contains the line &quot;My supper dish, my succotash wish&quot;

<text>Histocompatibility, or tissue compatibility, is the property of having the same, or sufficiently similar, alleles of a set of genes called human leukocyte antigens (HLA), or major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Each individual expresses many unique HLA proteins on the surface of their cells, which signal to the immune system whether a cell is part of the self or an invading organism. T cells recognize foreign HLA molecules and trigger an immune response to destroy the foreign cells. Histocompatibility testing is most relevant for topics related to whole organ, tissue, or stem cell transplants, where the similarity or difference between the donor&#x27;s HLA alleles and the recipient&#x27;s triggers the immune system to reject the transplant. The wide variety of potential HLA alleles lead to unique combinations in individuals and make matching difficult.

== Discovery ==
The discovery of the MHC and role of histocompatibility in transplantation was a combined effort of many scientists in the 20th century. A genetic basis for transplantation rejection was proposed in a 1914 Nature paper by C.C. Little and Ernest Tyyzer, which showed that tumors transplanted between genetically identical mice grew normally, but tumors transplanted between non-identical mice were rejected and failed to grow. The role of the immune system in transplant reject was proposed by Peter Medawar, whose skin graft transplants in world war two victims showed that skin transplants between individuals had much higher rejection rates than self-transplants within an individual, and that suppressing the immune system delayed skin transplant rejection. Medawar shared the 1960 Nobel Prize in part for this work.

In the 1930s and 1940s, George Snell and Peter Gorer individually isolated the genetic factors that when similar allowed transplantation between mouse strains, naming them H and antigen II respectively. These factors were in fact one and the same, and the locus was named H-2. Snell coined the term &quot;histocompatibility&quot; to describe the relationship between the H-2 cell-surface proteins and transplant acceptance. The human version of the histocompatibility complex was found by Jean Dausset in the 1950s, when he noticed that recipients of blood transfusions were producing antibodies directed against only the donor cells. The target of these antibodies, or the human leukocyte antigens (HLA), were discovered to be the human homologue of Snell and Gorer&#x27;s mouse MHC. Snell, Dausset and Baruj Benacerraf shared the 1980 Nobel Prize for the discovery of the MHC and HLA.

== Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) ==
HLA, the human form of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), is located on chromosome 6 at 6p21.3. Individuals inherit two different HLA haplotypes, one from each parent, each containing more than 200 genes relevant to helping the immune system recognize foreign invaders. These genes include MHC class I and class II cell-surface proteins. MHC Class I molecules—HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C—are present on all nucleated cells and are responsible for signaling to an immune cell that an antigen is inside the cell. MHC Class II molecules—HLA-DR, and HLA-DQ and HLA-DP—are only present on antigen presenting cells and are responsible for presenting molecules from invading organisms to cells of the immune system.

The MHC genes are highly polymorphic, with thousands of versions of the MHC receptors in the population, though any one individual can have no more than two versions for any one locus. MHC receptors are codominantly expressed, meaning all inherited alleles are expressed by the individual. The wide variety of potential alleles and multiple loci in the HLA allow for many unique combinations in individuals.

== Role in transplantation ==
After receiving a transplant, the recipient&#x27;s T cells will become activated by foreign MHC molecules on the donor tissue and trigger the immune system to attack the donated tissue The more similar HLA alleles are between donor and recipient, the fewer foreign targets exist on the donor tissue for the host immune system to recognize and attack. The number and selection of MHC molecules to be considered when determining whether two individuals are histocompatible fluctuates based on application, however matching HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR has been shown to improve patient outcomes. Histocompatibility has a measurable effect on whole organ transplantation, increasing life expectancy of both the patient and organ. HLA similarity is therefore a relevant factor when choosing donors for tissue or organ transplant. This is especially important for pancreas and kidney transplants.

Due to the inherited nature of HLA genes, family members are more likely to be histocompatible. The odds of a sibling having received the same haplotypes from both parents is 25%, while there is a 50% chance that the sibling would share just one haplotype and a 25% chance they would share neither. However, variability due to crossing over, haplotypes may rearrange between generations and siblings may be intermediate matches.

The degree of histocompatibility required is dependent on individual factors, including the type of tissue or organ and the medical condition of the recipient. While whole organ transplants can be successful between unmatched individuals, increased histocompatibility lowers rates of rejection, result in longer lifespans, and overall lower associated hospital costs. The impact of HLA matching differs even among whole organ transplants, with some studies reporting less importance in liver transplants as compared to heart, lung, and other organs. In comparison, hematopoietic stem cell transplants are often require higher degrees of matching due to the increased risk of graft-versus-host disease, in which the donor&#x27;s immune system recognizes the recipient&#x27;s MHC molecules as foreign and mounts an immune response. Some transplanted tissue is not exposed to T cells that could detect foreign MHC molecules, such as corneas, and thus histocompatibility is not a factor in transplantation. Individual factors such as age sometimes factors into matching protocol, as the immune response of older transplant patients towards MHC proteins is slower and therefore less compatibility is necessary for positive results. Post-operative immunosuppressant therapy is often used to lessen the immune response and prevent tissue rejection by dampening the immune system&#x27;s response to the foreign HLA molecules, and can increase the likelihood of successful transplantation in non-identical transplant recipients.

== Testing ==
Because of the clinical significance of histocompatibility in tissue transplants, several methods of typing are used to check for HLA allele expression.

=== Serological Typing ===
Serological typing involves incubating lymphocytes from the recipient with serum containing known antibodies against the varying HLA alleles. If the serum contains an antibody specific for a HLA allele that is present on the recipient&#x27;s lymphocyte, the antibodies will bind to the cell and activate a complement signaling cascade resulting in cell lysis. A lysed cell will take up an added dye such as trypan blue allowing for identification. Comparing which serums triggers cell lysis allows identification of HLA alleles present on the cell surface of the recipients cells.

Serological typing has the benefit of quickly identifying expressed HLA alleles, and ignores any non-expressed alleles that could be of little immunological significance. However, it does not recognize subclasses of alleles, which are sometimes necessary for matching.

=== Molecular Typing ===
HLA alleles can be determined by directly analyzing the HLA loci on chromosome 6. Sequence specific oligonucleotide probes, sequence specific primer PCR amplification, and direct sequencing can all be used to identify HLA alleles, often providing amino acid level resolution. Molecular methods can more accurately identify rare and unique alleles, but do not provide information about expression levels.

<doc id="144759" wikidata="Q5339301" url="?curid=144759" title="Cucurbita">
<text>is a genus of herbaceous fruits in the gourd family, Cucurbitaceae (also known as &quot;cucurbits&quot; or &quot;cucurbi&quot;), native to the Andes and Mesoamerica. Five edible species are grown and consumed for their flesh and seeds. They are variously known as squash, pumpkin, or gourd, depending on species, variety, and local parlance. Other kinds of gourd, also called bottle-gourds, are native to Africa and belong to the genus &quot;Lagenaria&quot;, which is in the same family and subfamily as &quot;Cucurbita&#x27;, but in a different tribe; their young fruits are eaten much like those of the &quot;Cucurbita&quot; species.

Most &quot;Cucurbita&quot; species are herbaceous vines that grow several meters in length and have tendrils, but non-vining &quot;bush&quot; cultivars of &quot;C. pepo&quot; and &quot;C. maxima&quot; have also been developed. The yellow or orange flowers on a &quot;Cucurbita&quot; plant are of two types: female and male. The female flowers produce the fruit and the male flowers produce pollen. Many North and Central American species are visited by specialist bee pollinators, but other insects with more general feeding habits, such as honey bees, also visit.

There is debate about the taxonomy of the genus and the number of accepted species varies from 13 to 30. The five domesticated species are &quot;Cucurbita argyrosperma&quot;, &quot;C. ficifolia&quot;, &quot;C. maxima&quot;, &quot;C. moschata&quot;, and &quot;C. pepo,&quot; all of which can be treated as winter squash because the full-grown fruits can be stored for months. However, &quot;C. pepo&quot; includes some cultivars that are better used only as summer squash.

The fruits of the genus &quot;Cucurbita&quot; are good sources of nutrients, such as vitamin A and vitamin C, among other nutrients according to species. The fruits have many culinary uses including pumpkin pie, biscuits, bread, desserts, puddings, beverages, and soups; they are now cultivated worldwide. Although botanical fruits, &quot;Cucurbita&quot; gourds such as squash are typically cooked and eaten as vegetables. Pumpkins see more varied use, and are eaten both as vegetables and as desserts such as pumpkin pie.

== Description ==

&quot;Cucurbita&quot; species fall into two main groups. The first group consists of annual or short-lived perennial vines which are mesophytic, meaning they require a more or less continuous water supply. The second group are perennials growing in arid zones which are xerophytic, meaning they tolerate dry conditions. Cultivated &quot;Cucurbita&quot; species were derived from the first group. Growing in height or length, the plant stem produces tendrils to help it climb adjacent plants and structures or extend along the ground. Most species do not readily root from the nodes; a notable exception is &quot;C. ficifolia&quot;, and the four other cultivated mesophytes do this to a lesser extent. The vine of the perennial &quot;Cucurbita&quot; can become semiwoody if left to grow. There is wide variation in size, shape, and color among &quot;Cucurbita&quot; fruits, and even within a single species. &quot;C. ficifolia&quot; is an exception, being highly uniform in appearance. The morphological variation in the species &quot;C. pepo&quot; and &quot;C. maxima&quot; is so vast that its various subspecies and cultivars have been misidentified as totally separate species.

The typical cultivated &quot;Cucurbita&quot; species has five-lobed or palmately divided leaves with long petioles, with the leaves alternately arranged on the stem. The stems in some species are angular. All of the above-ground parts may be hairy with various types of trichomes, which are often hardened and sharp. Spring-like tendrils grow from each node and are branching in some species. &quot;C. argyrosperma&quot; has ovate-cordate (egg-shaped to heart-shaped) leaves. The shape of &quot;C. pepo&quot; leaves varies widely. &quot;C. moschata&quot; plants can have light or dense pubescence. &quot;C. ficifolia&quot; leaves are slightly angular and have light pubescence. The leaves of all four of these species may or may not have white spots.

The species are monoecious, with unisexual male (staminate) and female (pistillate) flowers on a single plant and these grow singly, appearing from the leaf axils. Flowers have five fused yellow to orange petals (the corolla) and a green bell-shaped calyx. Male flowers in Cucurbitaceae generally have five stamens, but in &quot;Cucurbita&quot; there are only three, and their anthers are joined so that there appears to be one. Female flowers have thick pedicels, and an inferior ovary with 3–5 stigmas that each have two lobes. The female flowers of &quot;C. argyrosperma&quot; and &quot;C. ficifolia&quot; have larger corollas than the male flowers. Female flowers of &quot;C. pepo&quot; have a small calyx, but the calyx of &quot;C. moschata&quot; male flowers is comparatively short.

&quot;Cucurbita&quot; fruits are large and fleshy. Botanists classify the &quot;Cucurbita&quot; fruit as a pepo, which is a special type of berry derived from an inferior ovary, with a thick outer wall or rind with hypanthium tissue forming an exocarp around the ovary, and a fleshy interior composed of mesocarp and endocarp. The term &quot;pepo&quot; is used primarily for Cucurbitaceae fruits, where this fruit type is common, but the fruits of &quot;Passiflora&quot; and &quot;Carica&quot; are sometimes also pepos. The seeds, which are attached to the ovary wall (parietal placentation) and not to the center, are large and fairly flat with a large embryo that consists almost entirely of two cotyledons. Fruit size varies considerably: wild fruit specimens can be as small as and some domesticated specimens can weigh well over . The current world record was set in 2014 by Beni Meier of Switzerland with a pumpkin.

=== Reproductive biology ===

All species of &quot;Cucurbita&quot; have 20 pairs of chromosomes.

Many North and Central American species are visited by specialist pollinators in the apid tribe Eucerini, especially the genera &quot;Peponapis&quot; and &quot;Xenoglossa&quot;, and these squash bees can be crucial to the flowers producing fruit after pollination.

When there is more pollen applied to the stigma, more seeds are produced in the fruits and the fruits are larger with greater likelihood of maturation, an effect called xenia. Competitively grown specimens are therefore often hand-pollinated to maximize the number of seeds in the fruit. Seedlessness is known to occur in certain cultivars of &quot;C. pepo&quot;.

Critical factors in flowering and fruit set are physiological, having to do with the age of the plant and whether it already has developing fruit. The plant hormones ethylene and auxin are key in fruit set and development. Ethylene promotes the production of female flowers. When a plant already has a fruit developing, subsequent female flowers on the plant are less likely to mature, a phenomenon called &quot;first-fruit dominance&quot;, and male flowers are more frequent, an effect that appears due to reduced natural ethylene production within the plant stem. Ethephon, a plant growth regulator product that is converted to ethylene after metabolism by the plant, can be used to increase fruit and seed production. Although &quot;Cucurbita&quot; species can generally produce healthy fruit after pollination from the same plant, inbreeding depression can significantly reduce seed number and fruit size.

The plant hormone gibberellin, produced in the stamens, is essential for the development of all parts of the male flowers. The development of female flowers is not yet understood. Gibberellin is also involved in other developmental processes of plants, such as seed and stem growth.

==== Germination and seedling growth ====
Seeds with maximum germination potential develop (in &quot;C. moschata&quot;) by 45 days after anthesis, and seed weight reaches its maximum 70 days after anthesis. Some varieties of &quot;C. pepo&quot; germinate best with eight hours of sunlight daily and a planting depth of . Seeds planted deeper than are not likely to germinate. In &quot;C. foetidissima&quot;, a weedy species, plants younger than 19 days old are not able to sprout from the roots after removing the shoots. In a seed batch with 90 percent germination rate, over 90 percent of the plants had sprouted after 29 days from planting.

Experiments have shown that when more pollen is applied to the stigma, as well as the fruit containing more seeds and being larger (the xenia effect mentioned above), the germination of the seeds is also faster and more likely, and the seedlings are larger. Various combinations of mineral nutrients and light have a significant effect during the various stages of plant growth. These effects vary significantly between the different species of &quot;Cucurbita&quot;. A type of stored phosphorus called phytate forms in seed tissues as spherical crystalline intrusions in protein bodies called globoids. Along with other nutrients, phytate is used completely during seedling growth. Heavy metal contamination, including cadmium, has a significant negative impact on plant growth. &quot;Cucurbita&quot; plants grown in the spring tend to grow larger than those grown in the autumn.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Cucurbita&quot; was formally described in a way that meets the requirements of modern botanical nomenclature by Linnaeus in his &quot;Genera Plantarum&quot;, the fifth edition of 1754 in conjunction with the 1753 first edition of &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;. &quot;Cucurbita pepo&quot; is the type species of the genus. Linnaeus initially included the species &quot;C. pepo&quot;, &quot;C. verrucosa&quot; and &quot;C. melopepo&quot; (both now included in &quot;C. pepo&quot;), as well as &quot;C. citrullus&quot; (watermelon, now &quot;Citrullus lanatus&quot;) and &quot;C. lagenaria&quot; (now &quot;Lagenaria siceraria&quot;) (both are not &quot;Cucurbita&quot; but are in the family Cucurbitaceae.

The &quot;Cucurbita digitata&quot;, &quot;C. foetidissima&quot;, &quot;C. galeotti&quot;, and &quot;C. pedatifolia&quot; species groups are xerophytes, arid zone perennials with storage roots; the remainder, including the five domesticated species, are all mesophytic annuals or short-life perennials with no storage roots. The five domesticated species are mostly isolated from each other by sterility barriers and have different physiological characteristics. Some cross pollinations can occur: &quot;C. pepo&quot; with &quot;C. argyrosperma&quot; and &quot;C. moschata&quot;; and &quot;C. maxima&quot; with &quot;C. moschata&quot;. Cross pollination does occur readily within the family Cucurbitaceae. The buffalo gourd (&quot;C. foetidissima&quot;) has been used as an intermediary, as it can be crossed with all the common &quot;Cucurbita&quot;.

Various taxonomic treatments have been proposed for &quot;Cucurbita&quot;, ranging from 13 to 30 species. In 1990, &quot;Cucurbita&quot; expert Michael Nee classified them into the following oft-cited 13 species groups (27 species total), listed by group and alphabetically, with geographic origin:
* &quot;C. argyrosperma&quot; (synonym &quot;C. mixta&quot;) – cushaw pumpkin; origin: Mexico
** &quot;C. kellyana&quot;, origin: Pacific coast of western Mexico
** &quot;C. palmeri&quot;, origin: Pacific coast of northwestern Mexico
** &quot;C. sororia&quot;, origin: Pacific coast Mexico to Nicaragua, northeastern Mexico
* &quot;C. digitata&quot; – fingerleaf gourd; origin: southwestern United States (USA), northwestern Mexico
** &quot;C. californica&quot;
** &quot;C. cordata&quot;
** &quot;C. cylindrata&quot;
** &quot;C. palmata&quot;
* &quot;C. ecuadorensis&quot;, origin: Ecuador&#x27;s Pacific coast
* &quot;C. ficifolia&quot; – figleaf gourd, chilacayote, alcayota; origin: Mexico, Panama, northern Chile and Argentina
* &quot;C. foetidissima&quot; – stinking gourd, buffalo gourd; origin: Mexico
** &quot;C. scabridifolia&quot;, likely a natural hybrid of &quot;C. foetidissima&quot; and &quot;C. pedatifolia&quot;
* &quot;C. galeottii&quot;, little known; origin: Oaxaca, Mexico
* &quot;C. lundelliana&quot;, origin: Mexico, Guatemala, Belize
* &quot;C. maxima&quot; – winter squash, pumpkin; origin: Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador
** &quot;C. andreana&quot;, origin – Argentina
* &quot;C. moschata&quot; – butternut squash, &#x27;Dickinson&#x27; pumpkin, golden cushaw; origin: Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Puerto Rico, Venezuela
* &quot;C. okeechobeensis&quot;, origin: Florida
** &quot;C. martinezii&quot;, origin: Mexican Gulf Coast and foothills
* &quot;C. pedatifolia&quot;, origin: Querétaro, Mexico
** &quot;C. moorei&quot;
* &quot;C. pepo&quot; – field pumpkin, summer squash, zucchini, vegetable marrow, courgette, acorn squash; origin: Mexico, US
** &quot;C. fraterna&quot;, origin: Tamaulipas and Nuevo León, Mexico
** &quot;C. texana&quot;, origin: Texas, US
* &quot;C. radicans&quot; – calabacilla, calabaza de coyote; origin: Central Mexico
** &quot;C. gracilior&quot;

The taxonomy by Nee closely matches the species groupings reported in a pair of studies by a botanical team led by Rhodes and Bemis in 1968 and 1970 based on statistical groupings of several phenotypic traits of 21 species. Seeds for studying additional species members were not available. Sixteen of the 21 species were grouped into five clusters with the remaining five being classified separately:
* &quot;C. digitata&quot;, &quot;C. palmata&quot;, &quot;C. californica&quot;, &quot;C. cylindrata&quot;, &quot;C. cordata&quot;
* &quot;C. martinezii&quot;, &quot;C. okeechobeensis&quot;, &quot;C. lundelliana&quot;
* &quot;C. sororia&quot;, &quot;C. gracilior&quot;, &quot;C. palmeri&quot;; &quot;C. argyrosperma&quot; (reported as &quot;C. mixta&quot;) was considered close to the three previous species
* &quot;C. maxima&quot;, &quot;C. andreana&quot;
* &quot;C. pepo&quot;, &quot;C. texana&quot;
* &quot;C. moschata&quot;, &quot;C. ficifolia&quot;, &quot;C. pedatifolia&quot;, &quot;C. foetidissima&quot;, and &quot;C. ecuadorensis&quot; were placed in their own separate species groups as they were not considered significantly close to any of the other species studied.

===Phylogeny===
The full phylogeny of this genus is unknown, and research was ongoing in 2014. The following cladogram of &quot;Cucurbita&quot; phylogeny is based upon a 2002 study of mitochondrial DNA by Sanjur and colleagues.

==Distribution and habitat==
The ancestral species of the genus &quot;Cucurbita&quot; were present in the Americas before the arrival of humans, and are native to the Americas. The likely center of origin is southern Mexico, spreading south through what is now known as Mesoamerica, into South America, and north to what is now the southwestern United States. Evolutionarily speaking, the genus is relatively recent in origin, dating back to the Holocene, whereas the family Cucurbitaceae, represented in &quot;Bryonia&quot;-like seeds, dates to the Paleocene. Recent genomic studies support the idea that the &quot;Cucurbita&quot; genus underwent a whole-genome duplication event, increasing the number of chromosomes and accelerating the rate at which their genomes evolve relative to other cucurbits. No species within the genus is entirely genetically isolated. &quot;C. moschata&quot; can intercross with all &quot;Cucurbita&quot; species, though the hybrid offspring may not be fertile unless they become polyploid.

Evidence of domestication of Cucurbita goes back over 8,000 years from the southernmost parts of Canada down to Argentina and Chile. Centers of domestication stretch from the Mississippi River watershed and Texas down through Mexico and Central America to northern and western South America. Of the 27 species that Nee delineates, five are domesticated. Four of these, &quot;C. argyrosperma&quot;, &quot;C. ficifolia&quot;, &quot;C. moschata&quot;, and &quot;C. pepo&quot;, originated and were domesticated in Mesoamerica; the fifth, &quot;C. maxima&quot;, originated and was domesticated in South America.

Within &quot;C. pepo&quot;, the pumpkins, the scallops, and possibly the crooknecks are ancient and were domesticated at different times and places. The domesticated forms of &quot;C. pepo&quot; have larger fruits than non-domesticated forms and seeds that are larger but fewer in number. In a 1989 study on the origins and development of &quot;C. pepo&quot;, botanist Harry Paris suggested that the original wild specimen had a small round fruit and that the modern pumpkin is its direct descendant. He suggested that the crookneck, ornamental gourd, and scallop are early variants and that the acorn squash is a cross between the scallop and the pumpkin.

&quot;C. argyrosperma&quot; is not as widespread as the other species. The wild form &quot;C. a.&quot; subsp. &quot;sororia&quot; is found from Mexico to Nicaragua, and cultivated forms are used in a somewhat wider area stretching from Panama to the southeastern United States. It was probably bred for its seeds, which are large and high in oil and protein, but its flesh is of poorer quality than that of &quot;C. moschata&quot; and &quot;C. pepo&quot;. It is grown in a wide altitudinal range: from sea level to as high as in dry areas, usually with the use of irrigation, or in areas with a defined rainy season, where seeds are sown in May and June.

&quot;C. ficifolia&quot; and &quot;C. moschata&quot; were originally thought to be Asiatic in origin, but this has been disproven. The origin of &quot;C. ficifolia&quot; is Latin America, most likely southern Mexico, Central America, or the Andes. It grows at elevations ranging from in areas with heavy rainfall. It does not hybridize well with other cultivated species as it has significantly different enzymes and chromosomes.

&quot;C. maxima&quot; originated in South America over 4,000 years ago, probably in Argentina and Uruguay. The plants are sensitive to frost, and they prefer both bright sunlight and soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. &quot;C. maxima&quot; did not start to spread into North America until after the arrival of Columbus. Varieties were in use by native peoples of the United States by the 16th century. Types of &quot;C. maxima&quot; include &quot;triloba&quot;, &quot;zapallito&quot;, &quot;zipinka&quot;, Banana, Delicious, Hubbard, Marrow (&quot;C. maxima&quot; Marrow), Show, and Turban.

&quot;C. moschata&quot; is native to Latin America, but the precise location of origin is uncertain. It has been present in Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, and Peru for 4,000–6,000 years and has spread to Bolivia, Ecuador, Panama, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela. This species is closely related to &quot;C. argyrosperma&quot;. A variety known as the Seminole Pumpkin has been cultivated in Florida since before the arrival of Columbus. Its leaves are wide. It generally grows at low elevations in hot climates with heavy rainfall, but some varieties have been found above . Groups of &quot;C. moschata&quot; include Cheese, Crookneck (&quot;C. moschata&quot;), and Bell.

&quot;C. pepo&quot; is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, domesticated species with the oldest known locations being Oaxaca, Mexico, 8,000–10,000 years ago, and Ocampo, Tamaulipas, Mexico, about 7,000 years ago. It is known to have appeared in Missouri, United States, at least 4,000 years ago. Debates about the origin of &quot;C. pepo&quot; have been on-going since at least 1857. There have traditionally been two opposing theories about its origin: 1) that it is a direct descendant of &quot;C. texana&quot; and 2) that &quot;C. texana&quot; is merely feral &quot;C. pepo&quot;. A more recent theory by botanist Thomas Andres in 1987 is that descendants of &quot;C. fraterna&quot; hybridized with &quot;C. texana&quot;, resulting in two distinct domestication events in two different areas: one in Mexico and one in the eastern United States, with &quot;C. fraterna&quot; and &quot;C. texana&quot;, respectively, as the ancestral species. &quot;C. pepo&quot; may have appeared in the Old World before moving from Mexico into South America. It is found from sea level to slightly above . Leaves have 3–5 lobes and are wide. All the subspecies, varieties, and cultivars are interfertile. In 1986 Paris proposed a revised taxonomy of the edible cultivated &quot;C. pepo&quot; based primarily on the shape of the fruit, with eight groups. All but a few &quot;C. pepo&quot; cultivars can be included in these groups. There is one non-edible cultivated variety: &quot;C. pepo&quot; var. &quot;ovifera&quot;.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Cucurbita&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the cabbage moth (&quot;Mamestra brassicae&quot;), &quot;Hypercompe indecisa&quot;, and the turnip moth (&quot;Agrotis segetum&quot;). &quot;Cucurbita&quot; can be susceptible to the pest &quot;Bemisia argentifolii&quot; (silverleaf whitefly) as well as aphids (&quot;Aphididae&quot;), cucumber beetles (&quot;Acalymma vittatum&quot; and &quot;Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi&quot;), squash bug (&quot;Anasa tristis&quot;), the squash vine borer (&quot;Melittia cucurbitae&quot;), and the two-spotted spidermite (&quot;Tetranychus urticae&quot;). The squash bug causes major damage to plants because of its very toxic saliva.
The red pumpkin beetle (&quot;Aulacophora foveicollis&quot;) is a serious pest of cucurbits, especially the pumpkin, which it can defoliate.
Cucurbits are susceptible to diseases such as bacterial wilt (&quot;Erwinia tracheiphila&quot;), anthracnose (&quot;Colletotrichum&quot; spp.), fusarium wilt (&quot;Fusarium&quot; spp.), phytophthora blight (&quot;Phytophthora&quot; spp. water molds), and powdery mildew (&quot;Erysiphe&quot; spp.). Defensive responses to viral, fungal, and bacterial leaf pathogens do not involve cucurbitacin.

Species in the genus &quot;Cucurbita&quot; are susceptible to some types of mosaic virus including: cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), papaya ringspot virus-cucurbit strain (PRSV), squash mosaic virus (SqMV), tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV), watermelon mosaic virus (WMV), and zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV). PRSV is the only one of these viruses that does not affect all cucurbits. SqMV and CMV are the most common viruses among cucurbits. Symptoms of these viruses show a high degree of similarity, which often results in laboratory investigation being needed to differentiate which one is affecting plants.

== Cultivation ==

=== History ===

The genus was part of the culture of almost every native peoples group from southern South America to southern Canada. Modern-day cultivated &quot;Cucurbita&quot; are not found in the wild. Genetic studies of the mitochondrial gene &quot;nad1&quot; show there were at least six independent domestication events of &quot;Cucurbita&quot; separating domestic species from their wild ancestors. Species native to North America include &quot;C. digitata&quot; (calabazilla), and &quot;C. foetidissima&quot; (buffalo gourd), &quot;C. palmata&quot; (coyote melon), and &quot;C. pepo&quot;. Some species, such as &quot;C. digitata&quot; and &quot;C. ficifolia,&quot; are referred to as &quot;gourds&quot;. Gourds, also called bottle-gourds, which are used as utensils or vessels, belong to the genus &quot;Lagenaria&quot; and are native to Africa. &quot;Lagenaria&quot; are in the same family and subfamily as &quot;Cucurbita&quot; but in a different tribe.

The earliest known evidence of the domestication of &quot;Cucurbita&quot; dates back at least 8,000 years ago, predating the domestication of other crops such as maize and beans in the region by about 4,000 years. This evidence was found in the Guilá Naquitz cave in Oaxaca, Mexico, during a series of excavations in the 1960s and 1970s, possibly beginning in 1959. Solid evidence of domesticated &quot;C. pepo&quot; was found in the Guilá Naquitz cave in the form of increasing rind thickness and larger peduncles in the newer stratification layers of the cave. By c. 8,000 years BP the &quot;C. pepo&quot; peduncles found are consistently more than thick. Wild &quot;Cucurbita&quot; peduncles are always below this 10 mm barrier. Changes in fruit shape and color indicate that intentional breeding of &quot;C. pepo&quot; had occurred by no later than 8,000 years BP. During the same time frame, average rind thickness increased from . Recent genomic studies suggest that &quot;Cucurbita argyrosperma&quot; was domesticated in Mexico, in the region that is currently known as the state of Jalisco.

Squash was domesticated first, followed by maize and then beans, becoming part of the Three Sisters agricultural system of companion planting. The English word &quot;squash&quot; derives from &quot;askutasquash&quot; (a green thing eaten raw), a word from the Narragansett language, which was documented by Roger Williams, the founder of Rhode Island, in his 1643 publication &quot;A Key Into the Language of America&quot;. Similar words for squash exist in related languages of the Algonquian family.

=== Production ===

In 2021, world production of squashes (including gourds and pumpkins) was 23.4 million tonnes, led by China with 32% of the total (table). Ukraine, Russia, and the United States were secondary producers.

== Toxicity ==
Cucurbitin is an amino acid and a carboxypyrrolidine that is found in raw &quot;Cucurbita&quot; seeds. It retards the development of parasitic flukes when administered to infected host mice, although the effect is seen only if administration begins immediately after infection.

Cucurmosin is a ribosome inactivating protein found in the flesh and seed of &quot;Cucurbita&quot;, notably &quot;Cucurbita moschata&quot;.

Cucurbitacin is a plant steroid present in wild &quot;Cucurbita&quot; and in each member of the family &quot;Cucurbitaceae&quot;. Poisonous to mammals, it is found in quantities sufficient to discourage herbivores. It makes wild &quot;Cucurbita&quot; and most ornamental gourds, with the exception of an occasional &quot;C. fraterna&quot; and &quot;C. sororia&quot;, bitter to taste. Ingesting too much cucurbitacin can cause stomach cramps, diarrhea and even collapse. This bitterness is especially prevalent in wild &quot;Cucurbita&quot;; in parts of Mexico, the flesh of the fruits is rubbed on a woman&#x27;s breast to wean children. While the process of domestication has largely removed the bitterness from cultivated varieties, there are occasional reports of cucurbitacin causing illness in humans. Cucurbitacin is also used as a lure in insect traps.

== Uses ==

=== Nutrition ===
As an example of &quot;Cucurbita&quot;, raw summer squash is 94% water, 3% carbohydrates, and 1% protein, with negligible fat content (table). In a 100-gram reference serving, raw squash supplies of food energy and is rich in vitamin C (20% of the Daily Value, DV), moderate in vitamin B6 and riboflavin (12–17% DV), but otherwise devoid of appreciable nutrient content (table), although the nutrient content of different &quot;Curcubita&quot; species may vary somewhat.

Pumpkin seeds contain vitamin E, crude protein, B vitamins and several dietary minerals (see nutrition table at pepita). Also present in pumpkin seeds are unsaturated and saturated oils, palmitic, oleic and linoleic fatty acids, as well as carotenoids.

=== Culinary ===

The family Cucurbitaceae has many species used as human food. &quot;Cucurbita&quot; species are some of the most important of those, with various species being prepared and eaten in many ways. Although the stems and skins tend to be more bitter than the flesh, the fruits and seeds of cultivated varieties are usually quite edible and need little or no preparation. Cross-pollination with toxic types can cause bitterness in plants of the next generation, and these should not be eaten. The flowers and young leaves and shoot tips can also be consumed. The seeds and fruits of most varieties can be stored for long periods of time, particularly the sweet-tasting winter varieties with their thick, inedible skins. Summer squash have a thin, edible skin. The seeds of both types can be roasted, eaten raw, made into pumpkin seed oil, ground into a flour or meal, or otherwise prepared. Squashes are primarily grown for the fresh food market.

Long before European contact, &quot;Cucurbita&quot; had been a major food source for the native peoples of the Americas. The species became an important food for European settlers, including the Pilgrims, who even featured it at the first Thanksgiving. Commercially produced pumpkin commonly used in pumpkin pie is most often varieties of &quot;C. moschata&quot;; Libby&#x27;s, by far the largest producer of processed pumpkin, uses a proprietary strain of the Dickinson pumpkin variety of &quot;C. moschata&quot; for its canned pumpkin. Other foods that can be made using members of this genus include biscuits, bread, cheesecake, desserts, donuts, granola, ice cream, lasagna dishes, pancakes, pudding, pumpkin butter, salads, soups, and stuffing. Squash soup is a dish in African cuisine. The xerophytic species are proving useful in the search for nutritious foods that grow well in arid regions. &quot;C. ficifolia&quot; is used to make soft and mildly alcoholic drinks.

In India, squashes (&quot;ghiya&quot;) are cooked with seafood such as prawns. In France, marrows (&quot;courges&quot;) are traditionally served as a gratin, sieved and cooked with butter, milk, and egg, and flavored with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and as soups. In Italy, zucchini and larger squashes are served in a variety of regional dishes, such as &quot;cocuzze alla puviredda&quot; cooked with olive oil, salt and herbs from Apulia; as &quot;torta di zucca&quot; from Liguria, or &quot;torta di zucca e riso&quot; from Emilia-Romagna, the squashes being made into a pie filling with butter, ricotta, parmesan, egg, and milk; and as a sauce for pasta in dishes like &quot;spaghetti alle zucchine&quot; from Sicily. In Japan, squashes such as small &quot;C. moschata&quot; pumpkins (&quot;kabocha&quot;) are eaten boiled with sesame sauce, fried as a tempura dish, or made into balls with sweet potato and Japanese mountain yam.

==In culture==
===Art, music, and literature===

Along with maize and beans, squash has been depicted in the art work of the native peoples of the Americas for at least 2,000 years. For example, cucurbits are often represented in Moche ceramics.

Though native to the western hemisphere, &quot;Cucurbita&quot; began to spread to other parts of the world after Christopher Columbus&#x27;s arrival in the New World in 1492. Until recently, the earliest known depictions of this genus in Europe was of &quot;Cucurbita pepo&quot; in &quot;De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes&quot; in 1542 by the German botanist Leonhart Fuchs, but in 1992, two paintings, one of &quot;C. pepo&quot; and one of &quot;C. maxima&quot;, painted between 1515 and 1518, were identified in festoons at Villa Farnesina in Rome. Also, in 2001 depictions of this genus were identified in &quot;Grandes Heures of Anne of Brittany&quot; (&quot;Les Grandes Heures d&#x27;Anne de Bretagne&quot;), a French devotional book, an illuminated manuscript created between 1503 and 1508. This book contains an illustration known as &quot;Quegourdes de turquie&quot;, which was identified by cucurbit specialists as &quot;C. pepo&quot; subsp. &quot;texana&quot; in 2006.

In 1952, Stanley Smith Master, using the pen name Edrich Siebert, wrote &quot;The Marrow Song (Oh what a beauty!)&quot; to a tune in time. It became a popular hit in Australia in 1973, and was revived by the Wurzels in Britain on their 2003 album &quot;Cutler of the West&quot;. John Greenleaf Whittier wrote a poem entitled &quot;The Pumpkin&quot; in 1850. &quot;The Great Pumpkin&quot; is a fictional holiday figure in the comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot; by Charles M. Schulz.

===Cleansing and personal care uses===
&quot;C. foetidissima&quot; contains a saponin that can be obtained from the fruit and root. This can be used as a soap, shampoo, and bleach. Prolonged contact can cause skin irritation. Pumpkin is also used in cosmetics.

===Folk remedies===

&quot;Cucurbita&quot; have been used in various cultures as folk remedies. Pumpkins have been used by Native Americans to treat intestinal worms and urinary ailments. This Native American remedy was adopted by American doctors in the early nineteenth century as an anthelmintic for the expulsion of worms. In southeastern Europe, seeds of &quot;C. pepo&quot; were used to treat irritable bladder and benign prostatic hyperplasia. In Germany, pumpkin seed is approved for use by the Commission E, which assesses folk and herbal medicine, for irritated bladder conditions and micturition problems of prostatic hyperplasia stages 1 and 2, although the monograph published in 1985 noted a lack of pharmacological studies that could substantiate empirically found clinical activity. The FDA in the United States, on the other hand, banned the sale of all such non-prescription drugs for the treatment of prostate enlargement in 1990.

In China, &quot;C. moschata&quot; seeds were also used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of the parasitic disease schistosomiasis and for the expulsion of tape worms.

In Mexico, herbalists use &quot;C. ficifolia&quot; in the belief that it reduces blood sugar levels.

===Festivals===
&quot;Cucurbita&quot; fruits including pumpkins and marrows are celebrated in festivals in countries such as Argentina, Austria, Bolivia, Britain, Canada, Croatia, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Peru, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. Argentina holds an annual nationwide pumpkin festival &quot;Fiesta Nacional del Zapallo&quot; (), in Ceres, Santa Fe, on the last day of which a &quot;Reina Nacional del Zapallo&quot; () is chosen. In Portugal the &quot;Festival da Abóbora de Lourinhã e Atalaia&quot; (&quot;Squashes and Pumpkins Festival in Lourinhã and Atalaia&quot;) is held in Lourinhã city, called the &quot;Capital Nacional da Abóbora&quot; (the &quot;National Capital of Squashes and Pumpkins&quot;). Ludwigsburg, Germany annually hosts the world&#x27;s largest pumpkin festival. In Britain a giant marrow (zucchini) weighing was displayed in the Harrogate Autumn Flower Show in 2012. In the US, pumpkin chucking is practiced competitively, with machines such as trebuchets and air cannons designed to throw intact pumpkins as far as possible. The Keene Pumpkin Fest is held annually in New Hampshire; in 2013 it held the world record for the most jack-o-lanterns lit in one place, 30,581 on October 19, 2013.

Hallowe&#x27;en is widely celebrated with jack-o-lanterns made of large orange pumpkins carved with ghoulish faces and illuminated from inside with candles. The pumpkins used for jack-o-lanterns are &quot;C. pepo&quot;, not to be confused with the ones typically used for pumpkin pie in the United States, which are &quot;C. moschata&quot;. Kew Gardens marked Hallowe’en in 2013 with a display of pumpkins, including a towering pyramid made of many varieties of squash, in the Waterlily House during its &quot;IncrEdibles&quot; festival.

<text>The Lancaster Canal is a canal in North West England, originally planned to run from Westhoughton in Lancashire to Kendal in south Cumbria (historically in Westmorland). The section around the crossing of the River Ribble was never completed, and much of the southern end leased to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, of which it is now generally considered part.

Of the canal north of Preston, only the section from Preston to Tewitfield near Carnforth in Lancashire is currently open to navigation for , with the canal north of Tewitfield having been severed in three places by the construction of the M6 motorway, and by the A590 road near Kendal. The southern part, from Johnson&#x27;s Hillock to Aspull, remains navigable as part of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The planned continuation to Westhoughton was never built.

==History==
Initial ideas for what would become the Lancaster Canal were formulated as a result of the high price of coal in the city of Lancaster and the surrounding area. James Brindley was asked to make a survey in 1771, but the work was carried out by Robert Whitworth, who presented his plans in 1772. The canal would run from the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Eccleston for on the level to Tewitfield, passing through Preston and Lancaster. Locks would then raise the canal by , and a further would bring the canal to Kendal. Major aqueducts would be required to cross the River Ribble and the River Lune. In 1787, a scheme to reclaim land along the coast and construct a canal passing through the reclaimed land was suggested by an ironmaster called John Wilkinson, but it failed to attract sufficient support for work to start.

In 1791, following a public meeting to promote a canal, John Longbotham, Robert Dickinson and Richard Beck resurveyed the proposed line, and looked at extending it southwards to join the Bridgewater Canal at Worsley. They could not suggest a better route than the one that Whitworth had proposed, but John Rennie was asked to see if he could, and in January 1792 suggested a route from Westhoughton to Kendal. This would have required 32 locks to descend to an aqueduct over the Ribble, and the Tewitfield flight would have been replaced by five locks at that location and four at Milton. The promoters sought an act of Parliament urgently, as proposals by the Leeds and Liverpool Canal to alter their route would have affected the profitability of the southern section.


The Westmoreland Canals Act 1792 (32 Geo. 3. c. 101) received royal assent on 11 June 1792, and was entitled &quot;An Act for making and maintaining a navigable canal, from Kirkby Kendal in the county of Westmorland, to West Houghton in the county palatine of Lancaster, and also a navigable branch from the said intended canal at or near Barwick, to or near Warton Cragg, and also another navigable branch, from, at or near, Galemoss, by Chorley, to or near Duxbury in the said county palatine of Lancaster.&quot; The act created the Company of Proprietors of the Lancaster Canal Navigation, and gave them powers to raise £414,100 by the issuing of shares, and an additional £200,000, either by mortgage or by issuing more shares, if required. John Rennie was appointed as engineer in July 1792, with William Crossley the elder as his assistant, and Archibald Millar as resident engineer and superintendent. A second act of Parliament, the (33 Geo. 3. c. 107) was obtained in May 1793 to authorise the construction of the Glasson branch, so that the canal had a connection to the sea.

===Construction===
Work started almost immediately on the level section from Preston to Tewitfield. Contracts for of canal southwards from Tewitfield to Ray Lane near Catterall was awarded to John Murray of Colne and John Pinkerton. Although Pinkerton was a well-known canal contractor, Millar complained that the quality of his work was poor, and that he failed to follow instructions. Murray and Pinkerton were dismissed in 1795, to be replaced by several contractors each building smaller lengths of canal. In January 1794 work began on the Lune Aqueduct, which was built of stone, although Rennie thought brick should have been used, as it would have been considerably cheaper. By 1797 the aqueduct was completed, carrying the canal above the river, and boats were able to travel the from Preston to Tewitfield, known as the North End. Single span aqueducts carried the canal over the River Keer and the River Wyre. As the River Brock was on almost the same level as the canal, a weir was built above the canal and its bed was lowered beneath an aqueduct. Syphons were constructed to carry the River Calder and a stream near Ashton Hall under the canal. A formal opening ceremony was held on 27 November 1797, when six boats made the journey from Lancaster to the Lune aqueduct and back again, after which dinner was served at the King&#x27;s Arms. £269,406 had been spent to get this far.

The section south of the River Ribble was a little more complex, because part of it was close to the intended route of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. Work had been started on the South End, as it was officially known, in July 1793, when a contract for the length from Bark Hill near Wigan to Nightingales, near Chorley, had been let to Paul Vickers of Thorne. Negotiations with the Duke of Bridgewater had led to plans for an extension southwards from Westhoughton to the Bridgewater Canal at Worsley, but the bill presented to Parliament to authorise it was defeated, largely due to objections by the owner of Atherton Hall. The committee felt that a connection to the Leigh branch of the Bridgewater Canal, which was soon to be constructed, might be a better option. By February 1798, Vickers had completed construction of the canal from Bark Hill to Knowley Wharf near Chorley, and it was open for traffic. William Cartwright had been appointed as assistant resident engineer in January 1794, during the construction of the Lune aqueduct, but by July 1799 was resident engineer for the whole canal. He announced that of the South End was then open, as far north as Johnson&#x27;s Hillock, and that the next section to Clayton Green was nearly completed, with the exception of the Whittle Hill tunnels. Meanwhile, the committee were struggling with cash flow problems, but the open sections brought in some much-needed revenue.

Attention then turned to how to join the North End to the South End. Several options were considered, including linking to the Douglas Navigation, and although the Leeds and Liverpool agreed to improve that waterway, the Lancashire committee could not afford their part of the work. They asked Cartwright for his opinion in 1799, and he suggested a tramway, to run from Clayton Green on the South End to a little short of the current terminus of the North End, which would be extended slightly. The committee then asked Rennie and William Jessop to consider Cartwright&#x27;s tramway and another one that had been suggested, and to advise on a canal connection between the two sections. They suggested that an embankment should be used to support a canal at the same level as the section to Lancaster, with an aqueduct over the Ribble. Locks would be required to raise the level to meet the South End at Clayton Green. Their report included a design for an aqueduct with three arches, each of , and a total length of . Cartwright also submitted plans for an aqueduct, as did Thomas Gibson. Rennie and Jessop approved Cartwright&#x27;s plan for a tramway as a temporary solution to the problem. They thought it would cost around £21,600, and work on it started shortly afterwards.

The existing South End canal was extended by from Clayton Green to Walton Summit, and a tunnel was constructed at Whittle Hill. This proved to be difficult to build, and it was 1 June 1803 before the first boat was able to pass through it. By that time, the North End had been extended to a new basin near Fishergate in Preston, but the tramway had only reached Bamber Bridge, and finally opened at the end of 1803. The tramway had two tracks and three inclined planes, each powered by a stationary engine and an endless chain. A wooden trestle bridge carried it over the Ribble. Cartwright died shortly after it was completed, on 19 January 1804. One of his other achievements was the cutting of a tunnel between the canal at Preston and the River Ribble, to provide a water supply for the canal. After his death, the project was completed by William Millar of Preston, and in July 1806, a Boulton and Watt steam engine began pumping water through the tunnel.

When the committee had been set up in 1792, most of the members had been from Lancaster, with one from Preston and one from Kendal. This continued to be the case, and resulted in the extension northwards to Kendal being continually deferred. Millar surveyed two routes in 1805, and also considered the possibility of a tramway. The tramway was much cheaper, but the committee obtained a new act of Parliament, the (47 Geo. 3 Sess. 2. c. cxiii), to authorise variations to Rennie&#x27;s route between Tewitfield and Hincaster, which also reverted to having all of the locks at Tewitfield. After much debate and several changes of plan, terms were finally agreed with the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, which would allow them to use much of the South End. The Lancaster Canal would construct two branches, a short length from Bark Hill to Wigan top lock, and a longer branch rising through seven locks from Johnson&#x27;s Hillock. In order to provide a water supply to the Kendal level, they bought of land at Killington for a reservoir, but the cost of the branches and the reservoir meant that there was no money left to construct the canal, and so the link to Kendal was deferred again.

Thomas Fletcher became the engineer in 1812, and his first task was to prepare estimates for the canal to Kendal. An agreement to start work was reached in 1813, and construction of the canal north of the locks, including Hincaster Tunnel and Killington Reservoir, was managed by William Crosley from May 1817. The tunnel was finished on 25 December 1817, but the finishing of the locks took a little longer. The embankment for Killington Reservoir was raised several times, so that it now covered an area of , and it was full by the time the locks were completed. The opening ceremony for the Northern Reaches, as this section would become known, was held on 18 June 1819, with a flotilla of boats followed by dinner and a ball at the Town Hall in Kendal.
The next project would be the Glasson Dock branch, which had been authorised by the act of Parliament obtained in 1792. There was opposition from Preston, who felt that the canal crossing of the Ribble was much more important, but the makeup of the committee meant that the Glasson Branch was preferred. They obtained another act of Parliament, the (59 Geo. 3. c. lxiv) in 1819, to authorise the raising of more capital, and to retrospectively sanction the construction of Killington reservoir and the branch to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Johnson&#x27;s Hillock. Crosley had taken over as superintendent of the entire canal from Fletcher in 1820, and work commenced in 1823. It was finished in December 1825, with six locks carrying the canal down to the basin and dock. The company was short of money, and the lack of warehouses and wharves initially led to trade developing slowly. With the project complete, Crosley left in June 1826 to become engineer on the Macclesfield Canal, and was replaced by Bryan Padgett Gregson.

A canal crossing of the River Ribble was never constructed. In 1813, when the northern extension to Kendal was about to be built, some of the Preston proprietors, led by a man called Shuttleworth, proposed a scheme to cross the Ribble on the level, which Fletcher decided was not practicable. They then proposed an aqueduct at a lower level, with locks on both sides of the river. Fletcher estimated the cost as £160,537, and while it could be done, that amount of money was not available, and providing a water supply for the locks would be difficult. Shuttleworth then demanded a special general meeting in 1817, at which he suggested that the cost could be obtained by applying to the Exchequer Bill Loan Commission, but his proposal was defeated.

===Operation===
Once the North End and the South End were connected by the tramway, profitability increased significantly. In 1803, gross income was £4,853; the following year, with the tramway now open, income jumped to £8,490. Revenue from tolls in 1803 was £4,332, with around 29 per cent derived from the South End and tramway. By 1807, this had risen to £12,467, of which 51 per cent came from the South End and tramway. Shareholders received a dividend of half a percent in 1803, and one percent from 1805 onwards.
Toll income for 1820, with the link to Kendal newly opened, rose to £25,289, with just over half coming from the North End, and in 1825 was £27,069, with the North End contributing 52 per cent. Goods carried included grain, timber, potatoes and slate, while the canal was also used to export coal bound for Ulverston, North Wales and Ireland. The Glasson branch allowed small ships to use the canal without transhipment, and the number doing so rose from 64 in 1830, to 185 in 1840.

In the 1830s, the Canal Company realised it would have to adapt to the threat of railways. They forced the North Union Railway to build a bridge where it crossed the line of the canal to Westhoughton by extending the canal beyond Wigan locks for a short distance, although the idea of a canal to Westhoughton had long since been abandoned. The Bolton and Preston Railway wanted to use the line of the Lancaster Canal Tramway to reach Preston, and so they leased the line for £8,000 per year from 1837. However, they reached agreement with the North Union Railway in 1838 to use their line into Preston, but the Canal Company were not prepared to take back the tramway. In order to compete with a potential railway north of Preston, they ran packet boats providing an express passenger service between Preston and Lancaster, which took just three hours, and later extended the service to Kendal, with passengers walking up or down the flight of locks at Tewitfield and embarking on a second boat. The seven-hour journey time halved the best speeds of stage coaches; because of the comfort of the journey, passengers stayed loyal to the packet boats even after the advent of railway competition in the 1840s.

The pumping station at Preston was sold in 1836, as experience had shown that the water supply from Killington reservoir was adequate for the whole canal. Part of Whittle Hill tunnel on the South End section was converted to a cutting after roof collapses in 1827 and 1836. In the early 1840s, attempts were made to sell the canal to a railway company, but as neither the North Union Railway nor the Bolton and Preston Railway were interested, they leased the Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway from 1 September 1842. Seven years of complicated haggling ensued, with claims and counter-claims made by the canal and by various railway companies, until in 1849, the Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway became part of the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway. Acting as arbitrator, Robert Stephenson awarded the canal £55,552, and their claims to the railway ceased on 1 August 1849. During the seven years, the canal had made a profit of £67,391, which enabled them to pay off all their mortgages, award the proprietors a bonus of £1 17s 6d (£1 87.5p) per share and allocate £6,700 to a contingency fund.
An agreement was reached with the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway in 1850, whereby the railway carried passengers and general merchandise to Kendal, but the canal carried coal and heavy goods. The canal continued to carry goods between Glasson and Preston, and the relationship between the canal and railway carried on somewhat uneasily until 1858, when a dispute occurred, and the railway started to block the coal traffic from Kendal to the Lake District. The London and North Western Railway leased the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway from 1859, and the proprietors sought to lease the canal to the London and North Western Railway in 1860. After a bill to authorise the arrangement was defeated in the House of Lords in 1863, it was reintroduced the following year, and became an act of Parliament, the (27 &amp; 28 Vict. c. cclxxxviii), on 29 July 1864. The canal company then received £12,665.87 per year for the lease of the northern end of the canal, which allowed them to continue paying dividends and to make investments. The South End was leased to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal for £7,075 per year, and the tramway was closed from Preston to Bamber Bridge. Traffic on the remainder of the tramway had ceased by 1879, and it was closed. Eventually, the railway company offered to buy the canal, and this was formalised by an act of Parliament obtained on 16 July 1885, although they actually took over the canal on 1 July.

Under railway ownership, the canal was well-maintained, particularly because it carried coal from Preston to Kendal Gas Works, which had been built in 1824 on land bought from the canal company. This traffic amounted to between each year, and there was no railway access to the gas works. The canal had always suffered problems with leakage due to limestone fissures in the bed, and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, who by then owned the canal, obtained the London Midland and Scottish Railway Act 1939 (2 &amp; 3 Geo. 6. c. xxviii) which authorised them to close the first section at Kendal. By 1941–42, the section north of the gas works was unused and was closed because of leakage. The railway then attempted to close the whole canal in 1944, along with several others in their ownership, but opposition in the House of Lords resulted in the Lancaster Canal being removed from the scope of that act. Coal traffic to the gas works was transferred to road vehicles in 1944, and the canal carried its final commercial traffic in 1947.

===Demise===
Following the nationalisation of the railways and canals and the formation of the British Transport Commission as a result of the Transport Act 1947, the Docks and Inland Waterways Executive (DIWE) were responsible for the newly nationalised canals. In late 1952, the DIWE formed plans to sell off some of canals which were no longer commercially viable, including the Lancaster Canal, to county and local authorities. These plans were published by the British Transport Commission in April 1955, as part of a report entitled &quot;Canals and Inland Waterways&quot;. By then the Lancaster Canal was part of of waterways that formed group III, earmarked for disposal. Following its publication, the Inland Waterways Association organised a series of protest meetings, with the Lancaster Canal Boat Club being formed after the one held in Lancaster. The annual British Transport Commission bill was expected to contain details of what would happen to these waterways, but when it was published on 28 November 1955, the bill only contained proposals to abandon the derelict Nottingham and Walsall canals. The Inland Waterways Association detected a softening in official attitudes towards revival of the canal network.

Nevertheless, parts of the canal were abandoned, using discretionary powers contained in the Transport Act 1953, which allowed the DIWE to close unused or little-used canals. Around of canal from Stainton Crossing Bridge to Kendal were drained because of leakage through fissures in the underlying limestone, and the last in Kendal were filled in. Although the land was sold to landowners, the towpath was retained as a public footpath, and many of the bridges remain in place. At the Preston end, around of canal from Aqueduct Street southwards were gradually drained and partly filled in. Above Tewitfield locks, a section at Burton-in-Kendal was drained because of problems with leakage, and replaced by a pipe, so that the water supply to the lower canal was maintained, but navigation north of Tewitfield ceased. The gates of the Tewitfield locks were removed, and replaced by concrete cills, to act as weirs.

From January 1963, responsibility for the canal passed to the newly formed British Waterways Board. The Association for the Restoration of the Lancaster Canal was formed in December 1963, to campaign for retention of the canal. It later became the Lancaster Canal Trust. When the Ministry of Transport were developing plans for the M6 motorway north of Preston, they were not prepared to fund bridges where the route crossed the canal, and published plans to abandon the canal north of Tewitfield in mid 1965. There was a local campaign for bridges to be built, so that restoration would be possible in the future, but the canal was culverted at the three locations where the motorway crossed it, and at three more sites, where other roads were re-routed as part of the construction. The channel below Stainton could still be used by small boats, as it delivered water from Killington Reservoir to the lower canal, and also fed a pipeline which ran from the canal near Garstang to a chemical works near Fleetwood.

The Kendal to Preston section now terminates at Ashton basin, but previously continued to the centre of Preston where there are a number of streets and pubs whose names give clues: Wharfe Street, Kendal Street, the Lamb and Packet (the lamb being the crest of Preston), the Fighting Cocks (formerly the Boatmans). Most of the ground formerly occupied by the canal basin is now part of the University of Central Lancashire site. A Trust was formed in 2003 to extend the canal back to a new marina at Maudland, but as no progress was made, the university plan to landscape the area, in a way that will not preclude restoration of the canal in the future.

===Southern end===
The canal between Walton Summit and the Leeds and Liverpool link at Johnson&#x27;s Hillock was last used for commercial traffic in 1932, although a party in canoes managed to navigate the branch as late as 1969 with only two portages This section was closed in the 1960s, as a result of the M61 motorway proposal which would have required three bridges over the canal. The Ministry of Transport and British Waterways Board decided that the cost of constructing the bridges was not justified, particularly as the canal was in poor condition, and promoted a bill in Parliament for closure of the canal. As a result, much is now buried under the M61 motorway, and in the Clayton-le-Woods area housing estates were built on the route in the 1990s. The remainder of the southern end, between Johnson&#x27;s Hillock and Wigan Top Lock, is now considered to be part of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and remains well used by leisure traffic.

==Restoration==
At around the same time as the M6 was being planned, the first of many booklets produced to promote waterway restoration was published by the Association for the Restoration of the Lancaster Canal. It was written by T S H Wordsworth, and entitled &quot;The Lancaster Canal: Proposed Linear Park and Nature Reserve&quot;. Wordsworth was a planning officer for Lancashire County Council, and had been instrumental in setting up the forerunner of the Lancaster Canal Trust. Ashton Basin on the outskirts of Preston was restored and reopened to provide a destination at the southern end of the canal in 1972. In the early 1970s, the Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council had carried out a fact-finding survey of the northern reaches, and the Lancaster Canal Trust produced a report outlining possible ways forward. They then began promoting the idea of building slipways on the truncated northern reaches, to enable boats to access the canal where possible, and a series of slipways were completed, enabling a boat rally to be held over the Easter weekend in 1978. Although the Northern Reaches were officially no longer navigable, the pipeline that blocked the channel near Burton-in-Kendal was replaced by a concrete trough in the 1980s, which was made deep enough and wide enough to accommodate narrow boats, should navigation be restored.

An umbrella organisation called the Northern Reaches Restoration Group (NRRG) had been formed by 1992 to coordinate the restoration, consisting of nine partners. These were British Waterways (now Canal &amp; River Trust), Cumbria County Council, Inland Waterways Association, Kendal Town Council, Lancashire County Council, Lancaster City Council, Lancaster Canal Trust, South Lakeland District Council and the Waterways Trust. They commissioned the civil engineers Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick to determine whether full restoration was feasible, and their report of 1992 concluded that it was.

In 1998, British Waterways and the Northern Reaches Restoration Group signed a joint Memorandum of Understanding, which formally outlined how restoration of the canal could proceed. In 2000, Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick updated their report, and a further study in 2002 estimated the cost for full restoration at between £54.6 million and £62.4 million. A feasibility report was launched on 20 March 2003, at a public meeting held in Kendal. This included proposals for an inclined plane, to avoid two crossings where the canal was cut by the M6 motorway. Although the cost was high at around £55 million, with an extra £2 to £7 million needed to construct diversions to join the existing canal to the plane, it was estimated that the project would generate some £24 million per year into the local economy, and would also create around 800 new jobs.

The Lancaster Canal was finally connected to the rest of the English canal network in 2002, with the opening of the Ribble Link. This provides access from the Rufford Arm of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal via the tidal River Ribble. On leaving the Ribble, it follows the course of the Savick Brook, and rises through eight locks to the junction with the canal.

A bid for funding to restore the whole of the northern reaches was made to the North West Development Agency (NWDA), but was declined in mid-2004. However, both South Lakeland District Council and Rural Regeneration Cumbria, an independent organisation funded by the NWDA, pledged £325,000 towards the cost of a design phase in October 2004, which British Waterways estimated would cost £750,000. The restoration would involve dealing with the three motorway crossings and four trunk road crossing where the canal has been culverted, and include work on 52 listed structures. Following discussions with the NWDA, the project was broken down into three phases, with the first covering the from Canal Head at Kendal to Natland Road. The second phase would cover from Natland Road to Crooklands, and the third phase would cover the rest of the northern reaches to Tewitfield. The Northern Reaches Restoration Group (NRRG) submitted a revised bid to the NWDA for £13.5 million, to fund the first phase of the restoration, and were hopeful that work could begin in 2007. South Lakeland District Council set aside £1.5 million to assist with this project in 2004. In parallel with these larger schemes, Cumbria County Council spent £125,000 on renovating Castle Bridge in Kendal, and Kendal Civic Society were are major funder for the £20,000 restoration of Natland Mill Beck Lane Bridge.

By 2006, the project development phase for the first section in Kendal was being led by British Waterways. Funding of £756,000 had been obtained from several sources, including NWDA, South Lakeland District Council and Rural Regeneration Cumbria. The two-year project commenced in January 2006. An Area Action Plan was published in 2008 for the Kendal Canal Head area, outlining plans for a comprehensive regeneration of both the canal and the surrounding area. The document incorporated many of the findings from the feasibility study produced by British Waterways, but restricted reinstatement at the final terminus. It suggested a new canal arm slightly further to the south, and that some of the hard edging proposed for the channel should be made softer, to accommodate some wetland and improve the visual impact of the canal. British Waterways had suggested using a concrete channel, to overcome problems of leakage, with edges using stonework excavated from the infill.

Despite the intentions, work to restore the canal at Kendal had still not been started by late 2016. However, work had started on extending the canal northwards from Stainton. In 2002, around of canal immediately adjacent to the end of the watered section at Stainton was offered for sale and was bought by two retired members of the Canal Trust, Angela and Howard Broomby. The Canal Trust worked on a length between bridges 172 and 173, which was dug out and lined with bentonite membrane to make it water tight. This was marketed as &quot;the first furlong&quot;, and refilling of the restored bed occurred in 2014, to check that it did not leak. It did leak, and after much consultation, it was relined with large EPDM sheets, similar to pond liner, which was protected top and bottom by geotextile matting. The top layer was then covered with around 25,000 concrete blocks. Refilling of the section began in December 2021, and in the same month the Canal and River Trust, the successors to British Waterways, approved the work. As of early 2023, the final bund between the new section and the old has not been removed. Work is expected to start on another beyond bridge 173 in 2023, which will take the canal almost to Hincaster Tunnel, although details of how the canal will pass under the A590, just before the tunnel mouth, have not yet been finalised.

The Grade I Listed Lune Aqueduct was scheduled for a £2 million facelift in 2009–10. The organisations responsible for the aqueduct were awarded £50,000 by the Heritage Lottery fund to enable them to put together a credible bid for funding. Work began to restore the aqueduct in January 2011, and was completed in March 2012 with the project costing £2.4 million.

Stainton Aqueduct, which carries the canal over Stainton Beck near the northern end of the watered section, was extensively damaged in December 2015 as a result of flooding during Storm Desmond. This led to the temporary closure of the canal by means of a clay dam (the dam being intended to prevent any loss of water from the remaining open section, should the aqueduct fail). Funding was obtained for the restoration of the aqueduct with the main works commenced in August 2018 by construction firm Kier Group who have been employed by the Canal &amp; River Trust. Restoration, which included resurfacing of of towpath, was completed in 2020, but due to the coronavirus pandemic, a formal re-opening was delayed until October 2021, when the Lancaster Canal Regeneration Partnership hosted a month of festivities. The work was funded by a grant of £1.5 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund, with other contributions by the Rural Payments Agency, South Lakeland District Council, Cumbria County Council and Kendal Town Council.

==Route==
Starting at Preston, the canal begins inconspicuously on an embankment, just to the south of Ashton Basin. It formerly continued for a little under a mile to a basin where it connected to the Lancaster Canal Tramroad. The towpath is on the left hand bank when heading to the north for almost all of the canal. With the exception of Preston and the City of Lancaster, most of the canal runs through open countryside, while all of the navigable main line follows the same contour, and is therefore free of locks. At Preston, the canal runs through urban surroundings for around , passing the junction with the Ribble Link at , where there was a large sculpture, &quot;Gauging the Ripple&quot;, one of four nearby which were created by Thompson Dagnall. However, the wooden construction suffered from rot, and it was removed in 2007. It has since been replaced by a statue of a canal barge with large hand tools on it, made from stainless steel, which is perched on top of a corten steel plinth.

The canal is crossed by the M55 motorway before reaching Swillbrook, to the south of Catford, and then crosses the Woodplumpton Brook at Woodplumpton Aqueduct, before turning to the north. At Bilsborrow it is briefly joined by the A6 road, the West Coast Main Line railway and the M6 motorway. To the north of the village is Brock Aqueduct, and the canal continues to the east of Catterall to reach Garstang, where it crosses the River Wyre on a stone aqueduct, which is long and high. The inlet from the canal to Garstang Marina is a visual reporting point (VRP) for general aviation aircraft in the local Blackpool airspace. Beyond Garstang, the canal passes through open countryside, with few villages, before reaching the junction with the Glasson Dock branch, from Preston. A further rural section brings it to the southern edge of Lancaster.

Within Lancaster, the canal is hemmed in by buildings. The towpath briefly crosses to the east bank between bridges 98 and 100, before Bulk Road Aqueduct carries it over the A683 road. The aqueduct is relatively modern, having been built in 1961. Shortly afterwards comes the Lune Aqueduct, crossing the non-tidal part of the River Lune, which is from Preston. At Hest Bank the canal comes close to the sea at Morecambe Bay, and follows the coastline through Bolton-le-Sands, before turning inland at Carnforth. Its passage through the town is mostly in a cutting, and on the eastern edge of Carnforth, is crossed by the A601(M) motorway. Immediately afterwards, it follows a new route alongside the M6 motorway, before making a sharp turn through a new bridge under the motorway, and rejoining its historic course. It crosses the River Keer on a small aqueduct at Capernwray, overshadowed by a much larger viaduct that carries the railway over the river and the canal. The Capernwray Arm, a short branch that once served a quarry, now offers secluded moorings to the east of the main line, and after passing along the western edge of Borwick, the navigable canal ends at Tewitfield Marina next to the M6 motorway, which is from Preston.

Beyond lie the eight abandoned Tewitfield locks, isolated from the canal by Twitfield Culvert under the A6070 road at the southern end and Cinderbarrow Culvert under the M6 motorway at the northern end. Nearly of canal above Cinderbarrow Culvert remain in water, and can be used by canoes and other small craft that can be portaged around obstructions. It remains in water because Killington Reservoir still acts as the main water supply for the navigable section below the locks. Burton-in-Kendal is to the east of the canal, with Holme to the west. The former bridge carrying North Road has been lowered to become a culvert, and at Spinney Culvert, the M6 motorway again crosses the canal, while the towpath has been diverted away from the canal, to rejoin it at Duke&#x27;s Bridge. To the north of Farleton, Farleton Aqueduct carries the canal over Farleton Beck. Moss Side Culvert blocks the canal where the A65 road crosses it, and the M6 motorway crosses for the third time at Millness Culvert. At Crooklands, the canal crosses the Peasey Beck, which carries water from Killington Reservoir to supply the canal, and from here to Stainton the canal is used by a trip boat operated by the Lancaster Canal Trust. The watered section ends just beyond Stainton Aqueduct, some from Preston.

Although dry and partly infilled, its route can be followed for the final to Kendal. It passes through Hincaster Tunnel and over Sedgwick Aqueduct, which crosses the main street in Sedgwick. Although the course is infilled, there are a number of bridges still in good condition, including the Changeline Bridge, where the towpath changes to the eastern bank of the canal. Shortly afterwards, it arrives at Canal Head, where a number of stone buildings date from the time of the canal&#x27;s construction. The basin is from Preston.

<text>Stewart Hall Holbrook (1893–1964) was an American logger, writer, and popular historian. His writings focused on what he called the &quot;Far Corner&quot;: Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. A self-proclaimed &quot;low-brow&quot; historian, his topics included Ethan Allen, the railroads, the timber industry, the Wobblies, and eccentrics of the Pacific Northwest. An early proponent of conservationism, Holbrook believed that Oregon&#x27;s growing population would damage the state&#x27;s environment.

Holbrook was a logger before he moved to Portland, Oregon, in 1923, when he was 30 years old and became a very accomplished writer. He wrote for &quot;The Oregonian&quot; for over thirty years, was featured in &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; and authored over three dozen books. He also produced a number of satirical paintings under the pseudonym of &quot;Mr. Otis,&quot; in a style he called &quot;primitive modern.&quot; These paintings are still shown occasionally at the Portland Art Museum or can be found at the University of Washington Libraries, Special Collections. In the early 1960s, Holbrook was the founder and leading spokesperson of an early fictitious conservation movement called the James G. Blaine Society, writing on subjects from sustained yield forestry to his concerns about unplanned population growth.

<doc id="144765" wikidata="Q860764" url="?curid=144765" title="A Free Soul">
<text>A Free Soul is a 1931 American pre-Code drama film directed by Clarence Brown, starring Norma Shearer, and featuring Leslie Howard, Lionel Barrymore, James Glrason, and Clark Gable.

&quot;A Free Soul&quot; became famous for Barrymore&#x27;s climactic courtroom monologue, and he won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance. Gable made such an impression in the role of a gangster who bullies Shearer that he was catapulted from supporting player to leading man.

==Plot==
Defense lawyer Stephen Ashe, an alcoholic, successfully defends known gangster Ace Wilfong from a murder charge, despite his knowledge of Ace&#x27;s other illegal activities. His upper-class family has all but disowned him and his free-spirited daughter Jan. Jan is engaged to clean-cut Dwight Winthrop, but their relationship is threatened when she meets Ace and becomes enamored of him and his exciting life.

As Stephen continues to slip deeper into alcoholism, Jan breaks her engagement with Dwight and begins a clandestine affair with Ace that grows into love. Ace asks a drunken Stephen whether he can marry Jan, but Stephen, offended by the request, angrily refuses, and when he discovers Jan in Ace&#x27;s boudoir, he takes her home. They have an argument over their respective vices, and Jan proposes a deal: she will never see Ace again if Stephen will stop drinking. Despite knowing that he cannot keep his promise, Stephen agrees, and the two leave for a camping vacation along with Stephen&#x27;s loyal assistant Eddie.

After three months of sobriety, Stephen buys a bottle of liquor and boards a train for an unknown destination. Jan returns home to find that her family has cut ties with her; feeling despondent, she visits Ace. He reacts angrily to her return and informs her that they will be married the next day. Jan slowly realizes what sort of man he really is and sneaks away. Ace follows Jan to her apartment and, after a brief confrontation involving Eddie and Dwight, tells Jan that she must marry him, and threatens that if she marries Dwight, Ace will have Dwight killed.

Dwight appears at Ace&#x27;s gambling club and kills him, and then surrenders to authorities. He tells police that the murder was committed because of a gambling debt in order to protect Jan&#x27;s reputation, although it will mean his own execution. Jan finds Stephen in a flophouse, seriously ill from his drinking binge, and brings him to Dwight&#x27;s trial. Over the objections of Dwight and the prosecuting attorney, Stephen places Jan on the witness stand and elicits the full details of her relationship with Ace and the true reason why Dwight killed him. In an emotional appeal to the jury, Stephen takes the blame for everything that happened, explaining that because of his alcoholism, he had failed to be a proper father to Jan until it was too late. He then collapses to the floor, dead.

Dwight is acquitted and, as Jan prepares to leave for a new life in New York, promises to follow her.

==Production==
&quot;A Free Soul&quot; was written by John Meehan (dialogue continuity) and Becky Gardiner (adaptation) from the 1928 play by Willard Mack, which was based on the 1927 novel &quot;A Free Soul&quot; by Adela Rogers St. Johns. However, according to MGM publicity material, the story upon which this film was based first appeared serially in &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International with Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine from September 1926 to February 1927. Although onscreen credits list only the book by St. Johns, contemporary reviews list both the novel and Willard Mack&#x27;s play.

==Reception==
In a contemporary review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Mordaunt Hall wrote:Talking pictures are by no means elevated by the presentation of &#x27;A Free Soul&#x27; ... Nevertheless, it should be stated that Lionel Barrymore does all that is possible with his role. In fact, his is the only characterization that rings true, the other players being handicapped either through miscasting, the false conception of human psychology or poorly written lines. Norma Shearer may be the star of this film, but Mr. Barrymore steals whatever honors there may be. ... Undoubtedly all the members of the cast have ability, but the doings in this film benefit but little by their talents, except, as has been set forth, through Mr. Barrymore&#x27;s portrayal. And even he has to compete with tremendous odds to be convincing.The film was successful at the box office. According to MGM records, it earned $889,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $533,000 in other markets, resulting in a profit of $244,000.

<doc id="144766" wikidata="Q3756259" url="?curid=144766" title="GRASS (programming language)">
<text>GRASS (&quot;GRAphics Symbiosis System&quot;) is a programming language created to script 2D vector graphics animations. GRASS was similar to BASIC in syntax, but added numerous instructions for specifying 2D object animation, including scaling, translation and rotation over time. These functions were directly supported by the Vector General 3D graphics terminal GRASS was written for. It quickly became a hit with the artistic community who were experimenting with the new medium of computer graphics, and is most famous for its use by Larry Cuba to create the original &quot;attacking the Death Star will not be easy&quot; animation in &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977).

As part of a later partnership with Midway Games, the language was ported to the Midway&#x27;s Z80-based Z Box. This machine used raster graphics and a form of sprites, which required extensive changes to support, along with animating color changes. This version was known as ZGRASS.

==History==

===GRASS===
The original version of GRASS was developed by Tom DeFanti for his 1974 Ohio State University Ph.D. thesis. It was developed on a PDP-11/45 driving a Vector General 3DR display. As the name implies, this was a purely vector graphics machine. GRASS included a number of vector-drawing commands, and could organize collections of them into a hierarchy, applying the various animation effects to whole &quot;trees&quot; of the image at once (stored in arrays).

After graduation, DeFanti moved to the University of Illinois, Chicago Circle. There he joined up with Dan Sandin and together they formed the &quot;Circle Graphics Habitat&quot; (today known as the &quot;Electronic Visualization Laboratory&quot;, or EVL). Sandin had joined the university in 1971 and built the Sandin Image Processor, or IP. The IP was an analog computer which took two video inputs, mixed them, colored the results, and then re-created TV output. He described it as the video version of a Moog synthesizer.

DeFanti added the existing GRASS system as the input to the IP, creating the GRASS/Image Processor, which was used throughout the mid-1970s. In order to make the system more useful, DeFanti and Sandin added all sorts of &quot;one-off&quot; commands to the existing GRASS system, but these changes also made the language considerably more idiosyncratic. In 1977 another member of the Habitat, Nola Donato, re-designed many of GRASS&#x27;s control structures into more general forms, resulting in the considerably cleaner GRASS3.

Larry Cuba&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; work is based on semi-automated filming of a GRASS system running on a Vector General 3D terminal. The VG3D had internal hardware that performed basic transformations - scaling, rotation, etc. - in realtime without interacting with the computer. It is only during the times when new scenery is being presented that the much slower communications with the GRASS language takes place. This can be seen in the sequence, as the initial sections of the film show the Death Star being rotated and scaled very rapidly, while the later sections simulating flight down the trench requires new scenery to be paged in from GRASS &quot;trees&quot;. These can be seen appearing in groups.

===ZGRASS and UV-1===
In 1977, DeFanti was introduced to Jeff Frederiksen, a chip designer working at Dave Nutting Associates. Nutting had been contracted by Midway, the videogame division of Bally, to create a standardized graphics driver chip. They intended to use it in most of their future arcade games, as well as a video game console they were working on which would later turn into the Astrocade. Midway was quite interested in seeing the GRASS language running on their system, and contracted DeFanti to port it to the platform. A number of people at the Habitat, as well as some from Nutting, worked on the project, which they referred to as the Z Box. GRASS3 running on it became ZGRASS.

The Z-Box was a raster graphics machine, unlike the original GRASS systems, so while most of the GRASS3 style was maintained in ZGRASS, it added a number of commands dedicated to raster images. This included an extensive set of bit block transfer commands in order to simulate sprites, something the hardware didn&#x27;t include. The work would never be released by Midway, but the Circle would produce machines based on it as the Datamax UV-1.

===GRASS RT/1===
The last version of GRASS was RT/1, a port of GRASS to other platforms that divorced the language from the display model and allowed it to be ported to other platforms. Versions existed for MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, SGI platform using OpenGL, HP-UX, AIX, Macintosh and Amiga. The language remains similar to the earlier versions, so the reason for the change of name is unclear.

== Description ==
:&quot;This description is based on the original Bally manuals as well as the ACM description.
Zgrass was based on a standard set of BASIC commands and used most of its syntax. Where Zgrass differed from BASIC was that all commands were in fact functions and returned values, similar to the C programming language. If there was no obvious return value it was expected that a function would return 1 if it succeeded, and 0 if it failed. For instance, the command codice_1 would be illegal in BASIC, but in Zgrass this would print codice_2, the 1 being the value returned by second codice_3, meaning &quot;I successfully output the string &#x27;10&#x27;&quot;.

Programs in Zgrass were referred to as &quot;macros&quot;, and stored as strings. Both of these oddities were deliberate, as Zgrass allowed any string to become a program. For instance, codice_4 defines a string (no need for a $ on the variable as in Microsoft BASICs) containing a snippet of Zgrass code. Simply typing from that point on would run the command(s) inside. This feature can be used in place of the more traditional codice_5 command from BASIC, but has the added advantage of having a well-defined name as opposed to an opaque line number. In addition, the command remains in the form of a string in memory and can be manipulated at runtime with standard string operations.

Most BASIC interpreters of the era converted the input text into a &quot;tokenized&quot; version in which each of the commands was replaced by a single number (typically one byte long). This made the program run faster because it didn&#x27;t have to continually decode the commands from the strings every time. Zgrass&#x27;s use of string-based macros made this difficult, so they didn&#x27;t bother with tokenization. Instead, they included a compiler which could be used on any particular macro, speeding it up many times. Programs would often consist of a mix of compiled and uncompiled macros.

Line numbers were optional in Zgrass, and typically only appeared on lines that were the target of a codice_6. Most BASIC interpreters required line numbers for every line of code, but this was due to their use in the &quot;line editor&quot;–if you needed to edit a particular line, the only way to refer to it was by number. Zgrass used a more advanced full-screen editor that eliminated this need. Zgrass allowed any string to act as a &quot;line number&quot;, and were both valid.

Zgrass also included nameless branches, using the instruction, which would move forward or back a given number of lines. This is important in Zgrass as the line numbers were optional and different macros might make use of the same labels. For instance, some variation on is likely to be found in many bits of code, and thus might result in a name clash. Using avoided this possibility.

In keeping with its original purpose as a graphics language, Zgrass included numerous commands for simple drawing. Zgrass&#x27;s coordinate system had one point for each pixel in the high-resolution mode of Nutting&#x27;s graphics chip, giving a 320×202 grid. The Astrocade, by design, could only use that chip&#x27;s low-resolution mode, a 160×101 display. To avoid potential mapping problems, the coordinate space&#x27;s zero point was placed in the center of the screen. −160 to 160 were valid X locations, and -101 to 101 valid Y locations. For use on the Astrocade you used the positive locations only, whereas on the UV-1 the entire space was available.

Zgrass added a fairly complete set of array functions, as arrays are widely used in graphics. This included the ability to &quot;capture&quot; parts of the display into an array as a bitmap, which could then be manipulated as any other graphic item. This allowed Zgrass to include sprite-like functionality in the language, something the Nutting hardware did not directly include. Another feature the Astrocade did not include was the ability to process arrays with any reasonable speed, so the UV-1 included a Zilog supplied FPU for added performance.

Zgrass included three priorities (called &quot;levels&quot;) that allowed macros to be run normally, or in &quot;foreground&quot; or &quot;background&quot; levels. This added a simple form of multitasking which was tremendously useful in an animation-oriented language. Game authors could place joystick-reading routines in a macro set to run in the background, and then the joystick would be read automatically whenever the current drawing macro completed. Functions placed in the foreground ran before either, and was often used for timers and other &quot;low latency&quot; needs. Zgrass included a function that would call macros on a timed basis, making the implementation of timers very easy.

Zgrass also included a series of commands that &quot;covered&quot; CP/M, which allowed the disk to be accessed without exiting to the command prompt. You could easily save out macros to named files, and load them in the same way, allowing you to construct programs by loading up various macros from the disk into one large program. The commands also automatically made a backup copy of every save. Similar features were supported for Compact Cassette storage, but oddly the syntax was not parallel: disk commands were D-something, like , but tape commands were not T-something, like , but rather something-TAPE, like .

With programs constructed from arbitrarily selected modules, Zgrass needed to have better control over its variables than BASIC. In BASIC all variables are &quot;global&quot;, so if two subroutines both use the variable , which is very commonly used as a loop index variable, then they could set each other&#x27;s values which leads to hard-to-debug problems. Under Zgrass a programmer loading up two modules could easily find that both used as a loop counter, which could cause problems. To address this issue, Zgrass considered variables named with lowercase letters to be local only to that macro, so and were different variables, global and local respectively. Oddly, the examples provided with the language do not make widespread use of this feature, potentially confusing new programmers who might not be aware the feature exists.

==Example==

This text creates a new macro called codice_7 that can be called simply by typing codice_7 into the command prompt, or from other macros or programs. SINCURVE uses two local variables, x and angle, as well as a global variable, OFFSET.

The codice_9/codice_10 is a modification of the original BASIC codice_10 which will not ask for the input if the user types it into the command line when calling the macro. In this case, typing codice_7 will result in the prompt appearing and the program waiting for input, whereas typing codice_13 will skip the prompt and OFFSET will automatically be assigned 30. This allows a single macro to be used both interactively and within a program as a function.

codice_14 is an example of one of the many graphics commands included in the Zgrass language. codice_14 requires an X and Y location, as well as a color. In this example, the user supplied codice_16 moves the x position of the curve on the screen, while the Y position is supplied by the trig function, suitably enlarged for display (in this case, 80 times). The color is supplied in the last input, and in this case is 3. The UV-1 used color registers, so 3 did not imply a particular color, but a color selected from the current palette.

The codice_17 is likewise notable. It places an increment, codice_18, in front of the test, a feature not normally available in BASIC. In this case the IF is told to call codice_19 if true, which will move back two lines and can be used in place of a codice_6, as there is no line number target.

<text>Adolphe Jean Menjou (February 18, 1890 – October 29, 1963) was an American actor. His career spanned both silent films and talkies. He appeared in such films as Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;A Woman of Paris&quot;, where he played the lead role; Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; with Kirk Douglas; Ernst Lubitsch&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage Circle&quot;; &quot;The Sheik&quot; with Rudolph Valentino; &quot;Morocco&quot; with Marlene Dietrich and Gary Cooper; and &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; with Janet Gaynor and Fredric March, and was nominated for an Academy Award for &quot;The Front Page&quot; in 1931.

==Early life==
Adolphe Jean Menjou was born on February 18, 1890, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to a French father, Albert Menjou (1858–1917), and a mother from Ireland, Nora (&quot;née&quot; Joyce, 1869–1953). His brother, Henry Arthur Menjou (1891–1956), was a year younger. He was raised Catholic, attended the Culver Military Academy, and graduated from Cornell University with a degree in engineering. Attracted to the vaudeville stage, he made his movie debut in 1916 in &quot;The Blue Envelope Mystery&quot;. During World War I, he served as a captain in the United States Army Ambulance Service, for which he trained in Pennsylvania before going overseas.

==Career and stardom==
After returning from the war, Menjou gradually rose through the ranks with small but fruitful roles in films such as &quot;The Faith Healer&quot; (1921) alongside supporting roles in prominent films such as &quot;The Sheik&quot; (1921) and &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1921). By 1922, he was receiving top or near-top billing, with a selection of those films being with Famous Players–Lasky and Paramount Pictures, starting with &quot;Pink Gods&quot; (1922), although he did films for various studios and directors. His supporting role in 1923&#x27;s &quot;A Woman of Paris&quot; solidified the image of a well-dressed man-about-town, and he was voted Best Dressed Man in America nine times. He was noted as an example of a suave type of actor, one who could play lover or villain. In 1929, he attended the preview of Maurice Chevalier&#x27;s first Hollywood film &quot;Innocents of Paris&quot;, and personally reassured Chevalier that he would enjoy a great future, despite the mediocre screenplay. He closed the end of the 1920s with star roles such as &quot;His Private Life&quot; (1928) and &quot;Fashions in Love&quot; (1929).


The crash of the stock market in 1929 meant that his contract with Paramount was cancelled, but he went on to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and continued on with films (now talkies) in a variety of ways, with his knowledge of French and Spanish helping at key times, although his starring roles declined by this point. In 1930, he starred in &quot;Morocco&quot;, with Marlene Dietrich. He was nominated for an Academy Award for &quot;The Front Page&quot; (1931), after having received the role upon the death of Louis Wolheim during rehearsals. A variety of supporting roles in this decade were films such as &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; (1932), &quot;Morning Glory&quot; (1933), and &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1937).

His roles decreased slightly in the 1940s, but he did overseas work for World War II alongside supporting roles in films like &quot;Roxie Hart&quot; (1942) and &quot;State of the Union&quot; (1948). Over the course of his career, he bridged the gap of working with several noted directors that ranged from Charlie Chaplin to Frank Borzage to Frank Capra to Stanley Kubrick.

===Later career===
Menjou had just eleven roles in the 1950s, but he managed to snag one last leading role with the film noir &quot;The Sniper&quot; (1952). Incidentally, the director of that film was Edward Dmytryk, who had been a member of the Hollywood Ten; as such he was blacklisted from the film industry for not testifying to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) during the &#x27;Red scare&#x27; before deciding to testify and name names as a brief member of the Communist Party.

In 1955, Menjou played Dr. Elliott Harcourt in &quot;Barrier of Silence&quot;, episode 19 of the first season of the television series &quot;Science Fiction Theatre&quot;. He guest-starred as Fitch, with Orson Bean and Sue Randall as John and Ellen Monroe, in a 1961 episode, &quot;The Secret Life of James Thurber&quot;, based on the works of American humorist James Thurber (especially &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot;), in the CBS anthology series &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot;. He also appeared in the Thanksgiving episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford,&quot; which aired on November 22, 1956. Menjou ended his film career with such roles as French General George Broulard in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; (1957) and his final film role was that of the town curmudgeon in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pollyanna&quot; (1960).

==Political beliefs==
Menjou was a staunch Republican who equated the Democratic Party with socialism. He supported the Hoover administration&#x27;s policies during the Great Depression. Menjou told a friend that he feared that if a Democrat won the White House, they &quot;would raise taxes [and] destroy the value of the dollar,&quot; depriving Menjou of a good portion of his wealth. He took precautions against this threat: &quot;I&#x27;ve got gold stashed in safety deposit boxes all over town... They&#x27;ll never get an ounce from me.&quot; In the 1944 presidential election, he joined other celebrity Republicans at a rally in the Los Angeles Coliseum, organized by studio executive David O. Selznick, to support the Dewey–Bricker ticket and Governor Earl Warren of California, who would be Dewey&#x27;s running mate in 1948. The gathering drew 93,000, with Cecil B. DeMille as the master of ceremonies and short speeches by Hedda Hopper and Walt Disney. Despite the rally&#x27;s large turnout, most Hollywood celebrities who took public positions supported the Roosevelt–Truman ticket.

In 1947, Menjou cooperated with the House Committee on Un-American Activities saying that Hollywood &quot;is one of the main centers of Communist activity in America&quot;. He added: &quot;it is the desire and wish of the masters of Moscow to use this medium for their purposes&quot; which is &quot;the overthrow of the American government&quot;. Menjou was a leading member of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a group formed to oppose &quot;communist influence&quot; in Hollywood, whose other members included John Wayne, Barbara Stanwyck (with whom Menjou costarred in &quot;Forbidden&quot; in 1932 and &quot;Golden Boy&quot; in 1939) and her husband, actor Robert Taylor.

Because of his political leanings, Menjou came into conflict with actress Katharine Hepburn, with whom he appeared in &quot;Morning Glory&quot;, &quot;Stage Door&quot;, and &quot;State of the Union&quot; (also starring Spencer Tracy). Hepburn was strongly opposed to the HUAC hearings, and their clashes were reportedly instant and mutually cutting. During a government deposition, Menjou said, &quot;Scratch a do-gooder, like Hepburn, and they&#x27;ll yell, &#x27;Pravda&#x27;.&quot; To this, Hepburn called Menjou &quot;wisecracking, witty—a flag-waving super-patriot who invested his American dollars in Canadian bonds and had a thing about Communists.&quot; In his book &quot;Kate&quot;, Hepburn biographer William Mann said that during the filming of &quot;State of the Union&quot;, she and Menjou spoke to each other only while acting. 

== Personal life ==
Menjou was married three times. His first marriage, in 1920 to Kathryn Conn Tinsley, ended in divorce. He married Kathryn Carver in 1928; they divorced in 1934. His third and final marriage, to Verree Teasdale, lasted from 1934 until his death on October 29, 1963; they had one adopted son, Peter Menjou. Menjou had adopted Tinsley&#x27;s son, Harold Lawton Tinsley, but after his death, his will revealed that he had included only Peter Menjou as his heir.

In 1948, Menjou published his autobiography, &quot;It Took Nine Tailors&quot;.

Menjou died on October 29, 1963, of hepatitis in Beverly Hills, California. He is interred beside Verree at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

==Legacy==

For his contributions to the motion picture industry, Menjou has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6826 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Cultural references==
Because of Menjou&#x27;s public support of HUAC, the propaganda of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) often depicted their western opponents with Menjou-style moustaches, and it was considered a statement of political opposition to trim one&#x27;s moustache that way. The style became a symbol for the resourceful criminal, and in Germany is still called &quot;Menjou-Bärtchen&quot; (Menjou beardlet). In German film and theatre, dubious men, opportunists, corrupt politicians, fraudulent persuaders, marriage impostors and other &quot;slick&quot; criminals often wear &quot;Menjou-Bärtchen&quot;. In real life, the style is often associated with opportunism.

Salvador Dalí admired Adolphe Menjou. 
He declared &quot;la moustache d&#x27;Adolphe Menjou est surréaliste&quot; and began offering fake mustaches from a silver cigarette case to other people with the words &quot;Moustache? Moustache? Moustache?&quot;

One of the most famous photographs by the avant-garde photographer Umbo is titled &quot;Menjou En Gros&quot; ca. 1928.

In the &quot;Irresistible Andy&quot; episode of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, when Andy sees Barney dressed in fancy attire, Andy calls him &quot;the Adolphe Menjou of Mayberry&quot;.

On the Season 2, Episode 11 Leave it To Beaver, Ward states the world might have missed out on another Adolphe Menjou. 

In the movie &quot;Sunset Boulevard,&quot; Joe Gillis arrives to a young adult New Year&#x27;s Eve party overdressed in a vicuna overcoat and a tailcoat. Artie Green surveys his outfit and asks, &quot;Who&#x27;d you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?&quot;

In the Mario Puzo novel &quot;The Godfather&quot;, character Jules Segall references the misdiagnosis of singer Johnny Fontane&#x27;s throat troubles by an &quot;Adolphe Menjou medical man...&quot; 

In the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; episode, &quot;Abyssinia, Henry,&quot; Henry Blake is departing the 4077th, attired in a comically dated suit and hat. Trapper tells him: &quot;Henry, that suit is really you!&quot; Hawkeye, after a perfectly timed beat, adds: &quot;If you&#x27;re Adolphe Menjou.&quot;

<text>John Cooper Jr. (September 15, 1922 – May 3, 2011) was an American actor and director. Known as Jackie Cooper, he began his career performing in film as a child, and successfully transitioned to adult roles and directing in both film and television. At age nine, he became the only child and youngest person nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for the 1931 film &quot;Skippy&quot;. He was a featured member of the Our Gang ensemble in 1929–1931, starred in the television series &quot;The People&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1955–1958) and &quot;Hennesey&quot; (1959–1962), and played journalist Perry White in the 1978–1987 Superman films.

==Early life==
John Cooper Jr. was born in Los Angeles, California. Cooper&#x27;s father, John Cooper, left the family when Jackie was two years old. His mother, Mabel Leonard Bigelow (née Polito), was a stage pianist. Cooper&#x27;s maternal uncle, Jack Leonard, was a screenwriter and his maternal aunt, Julie Leonard, was an actress married to director Norman Taurog. Cooper&#x27;s stepfather was C. J. Bigelow, a studio production manager. His mother was Italian American (her family&#x27;s surname was changed from &quot;Polito&quot; to &quot;Leonard&quot;); Cooper was told by his family that his father was Jewish. The two never reunited after he had left the family.

==Early acting career==

Cooper first appeared in films as an extra with his grandmother, who took him to her auditions hoping it would help her get extra work. At age three, Jackie appeared in Lloyd Hamilton comedies under the name of &quot;Leonard&quot;.

Cooper graduated to bit parts in feature films such as &quot;Fox Movietone Follies of 1929&quot; and &quot;Sunny Side Up&quot;. His director in those films, David Butler, recommended Cooper to director Leo McCarey, who arranged an audition for the &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedy series produced by Hal Roach. In 1929, Cooper signed a three-year contract after joining the series in the short &quot;Boxing Gloves&quot;. He initially was cast as a supporting character, but by early 1930 his success in transitioning to sound films enabled him to become one of &quot;Our Gang&quot;&#x27;s major characters, called Jackie in the series, replacing Harry Spear, who left after his contract expired. He was the main character in the 1930 entries &quot;The First Seven Years&quot; and &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot;. His most notable performances explore his crush on schoolteacher Miss Crabtree, (portrayed by June Marlowe) in the trilogy &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot;, &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot;, and &quot;Love Business&quot;.

While under contract to Hal Roach Studios, in 1931 Cooper was loaned to Paramount to star in &quot;Skippy,&quot; directed by his uncle, Norman Taurog. At age nine, Cooper was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor, the youngest actor to be nominated for an Oscar in that category. Although Paramount paid Roach $25,000 for Cooper&#x27;s services, Roach paid Cooper a standard salary of $50 per week.

Cooper was in great demand, resulting in Roach selling the actor&#x27;s contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1931. Cooper acted with Wallace Beery in &quot;The Champ&quot; (1931—Beery&#x27;s Oscar-winning role); a wittily comedic romp titled &quot;The Bowery&quot; (1933) with George Raft, Fay Wray and Pert Kelton; Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1934) with Lionel Barrymore, Lewis Stone and Nigel Bruce; and a father-son circus story about a one-armed animal trainer titled &quot;O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s Boy&quot; (1935). In his autobiography, Cooper wrote that Beery was a disappointment and accused Beery of upstaging him and attempting to undermine his performances out of jealousy.

Cooper played the lead role in the first two Henry Aldrich films, &quot;What a Life&quot; (1939) and &quot;Life with Henry&quot; (1941), and co-starred with Hedy Lamarr, Lana Turner and James Stewart in the 1941 MGM musical &quot;Ziegfeld Girl&quot; starring Judy Garland.

==Adult years==
Cooper served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, remaining in the reserves until 1982, retiring at the rank of captain and receiving the Legion of Merit. He starred in two television sitcoms, NBC&#x27;s &quot;The People&#x27;s Choice&quot; with Patricia Breslin and as the title character in CBS&#x27;s &quot;Hennessy&quot; with Abby Dalton. In 1954, he guest-starred on the NBC legal drama &quot;Justice&quot;. He appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom&quot;, guest-starred with Tennessee Ernie Ford on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Ford Show&quot; as America&#x27;s Uranium King, and as Charles A. Steen in &quot;I Found 60 Million Dollars&quot; on the &quot;Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot;.

In 1950, Cooper was cast in a production of &quot;Mr. Roberts&quot; in Boston, Massachusetts in the role of Ensign Pulver. From 1964 to 1969, Cooper was vice president of program development at Columbia Pictures Screen Gems TV division. He was responsible for packaging series such as &quot;Bewitched&quot; and selling them to the networks. In 1964, Cooper appeared in Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;Caesar and Me&quot;, and in 1968 a made-for-television film, &quot;Shadow on the Land&quot;.

Cooper left Columbia in 1969. He appeared in the fourth season of &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; in an episode called &quot;The Burning Ice&quot;. Cooper appeared in &quot;Candidate for Crime&quot; starring Peter Falk as &quot;Columbo&quot; in 1973, Season 1 Episode 12 &quot;Last Rites for a Dead Priest&quot; of &quot;Kojak&quot; in 1974 starring Telly Savalas, and in the 1975 ABC series &quot;Mobile One&quot;, a Jack Webb/Mark VII Limited production. He guest-starred in a 1978 two-part episode of &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, &quot;The House on Willis Avenue&quot;. Cooper&#x27;s work as director on episodes of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and &quot;The White Shadow&quot; earned him Emmy awards.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Cooper appeared as &quot;Daily Planet&quot; editor Perry White in the &quot;Superman&quot; film series, a role he got after Keenan Wynn, who was originally cast as White, became unavailable after suffering a heart attack.

Cooper&#x27;s final film role was as Ace Morgan in the 1987 film &quot;Surrender&quot;, starring Sally Field, Michael Caine, and Steve Guttenberg. Cooper announced his retirement in 1989, with his final television appearance as John C. Dodd in two episodes of &quot;Capital News&quot; in 1992.

==Personal life==
Cooper served in the United States Navy during World War II and remained active in the Naval Reserve for the next several decades, reaching the rank of captain. He was married to June Horne from 1944 until 1949, with whom he had a son, John &quot;Jack&quot; Cooper III, who was born in 1946. June was the daughter of director James W. Horne and actress Cleo Ridgely. Cooper was married to Hildy Parks from 1950 until 1951, and to Barbara Rae Kraus from 1954 until her death in 2009. Cooper and Kraus had three children, Russell, born in 1956, Julie, born in 1957, and Cristina, born in 1959. Julie and Cristina died in 1997 and 2009, respectively.

Cooper supported Republican presidential candidates and appeared at rallies for Herbert Hoover in 1932 and Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952.

Cooper participated in several automobile racing events, including the record-breaking class D cars at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. He drove in several SCCA road racing competitions. Cooper was named the honorary starter for the 1976 Winston 500 at the Alabama International Motor Speedway, which is now known as Talladega Superspeedway, in Talladega, Alabama.

Cooper&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Shoot My Dog&quot;, was published in 1982. The title refers to an incident during the filming of &quot;Skippy&quot;, when Norman Taurog, who was the director, needed Cooper to cry a number of times on camera. To accomplish that, Taurog used various tricks intended to upset Cooper. For example, one time Taurog ordered a security guard to go backstage and pretend to shoot Cooper&#x27;s dog. The stunt resulted in genuine tears; Cooper afterwards discovered his dog was in fact fine. Later that same day, his mother came to the set, and showed Cooper a better way for an actor to experience emotions in the scene–by studying the script, and empathizing with the character he was portraying.

Cooper announced his retirement in 1989, although he continued directing episodes of the syndicated series &quot;Superboy&quot;. He began spending more time training and racing horses at Hollywood Park and outside San Diego during the Del Mar racing season. Cooper lived in Beverly Hills from 1955 until his death.

For his contributions to the motion picture industry, Cooper was honored with a Hollywood Walk of Fame star located at 1507 Vine Street.

==Death==
Cooper died on May 3, 2011, aged 88, in Santa Monica, California. He was survived by his two sons. He outlived both his daughters and wife, Barbara Rae Kraus. He was interred at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, in honor of his naval service.

<text>Richard Dix (born Ernst Carlton Brimmer; July 18, 1893 – September 20, 1949) was an American motion picture actor who achieved popularity in both silent and sound film. His standard on-screen image was that of the rugged and stalwart hero. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his lead role in the Best Picture-winning epic &quot;Cimarron&quot; (1931).

Dix appeared in 101 film roles, credited from his first appearance. Plagued by alcoholism, he died at 56, just two years after his film career had ended.

==Early life==
Dix was born Ernst Carlton Brimmer on July 18, 1893, in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He received his schooling there, intending to become a surgeon to please his father. Standing 6 feet and weighing 180 pounds, Dix excelled in sports, especially football and baseball. His obvious acting talent in his school dramatic club also led him to leading roles in most of the school plays. After a year at the University of Minnesota, he took a position at a bank, and trained for the stage in the evening. His professional start was with a local stock company, and this led to similar work in New York City. He then went to Los Angeles and became leading man for the Morosco Stock Company. His success there earned him a contract with Paramount Pictures.

==Career==
Upon arrival at Paramount studios Brimmer changed his name to Richard Dix. He began his Hollywood film career in dramas and romantic comedies. His first Western was in 1923, &quot;To the Last Man&quot;, his seventeenth picture, immediately followed by his best-remembered early role in Cecil B. Demille&#x27;s silent version of &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;.

Able to successfully bridge the transition from silent films to talkies and remain a leading man, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1931 for his performance as Yancey Cravat in RKO&#x27;s &quot;Cimarron&quot;. Based on the popular novel by Edna Ferber, it took the Best Picture award. Another memorable starring role for Dix was in a followup RKO blockbuster, the adventure &quot;The Lost Squadron.&quot;


Plagued by alcoholism, Dix was unable to maintain his A-list leading man status, and spiraled into B pictures. He starred in the 1935 British futuristic film &quot;The Tunnel&quot;, as well as &quot;The Great Jasper&quot; and &quot;Blind Alibi&quot; in the late 1930s. Dix also starred as the homicidal Captain Stone in the Val Lewton production of &quot;The Ghost Ship&quot;.
In 1941, Dix played Wild Bill Hickok in &quot;Badlands of Dakota&quot; and portrayed Wyatt Earp the following year in &quot;Tombstone, the Town Too Tough to Die&quot;.

In 1944, he starred in &quot;The Whistler&quot;, a feature film produced by Columbia Pictures based on the popular radio program. The film adaptation was popular enough to become a series. In these offbeat, crime-related stories, Dix did &quot;not&quot; play &quot;The Whistler&quot; (who was an unseen narrator representing the central character&#x27;s conscience). He appeared in a variety of characterizations, some sympathetic, others hard-boiled, but always victims of fate and circumstances conspiring against him. Dix retired from acting after the seventh of these films, &quot;The Thirteenth Hour&quot;. He suffered a heart attack in October 1948 and continued to have heart trouble until his death within the year.

==Personal life==

According to the July 1934 &quot;Movies&quot; magazine, Dix raised thousands of chickens and turkeys each year on his ranch near Hollywood, the location of which he kept a close secret. He also had a collection of thousands of smoking pipes, and at one time had 36 Scotties and English setters. He also read at least five books a week. 

Richard Dix married Winifred Coe on October 20, 1931. A daughter, Martha Mary Ellen, followed. They divorced in 1933. He married Virginia Webster, on June 29, 1934. They had twin boys, Richard Jr. and Robert Dix (1935–2018), and adopted a daughter, Sara Sue.

Dix supported Thomas Dewey in the 1944 United States presidential election.

After years of fighting alcoholism, Dix suffered a serious heart attack at 56 on September 12, 1949, either on a train from New York to Los Angeles) or while on board a ship returning from France. He died eight days later at the Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital, and is interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

==Legacy==
Dix has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the Motion Pictures section at 1610 Vine Street. It was dedicated February 8, 1960.

Dix is mentioned in the film &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, when Olson Johnson tries to rouse the townspeople: &quot;Our fathers came across the prairies, fought Indians, fought drought, fought locusts, fought Dix... Remember when Richard Dix came in here and tried to take over this town?&quot;

<text>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a 1931 American pre-Code horror film, directed by Rouben Mamoulian and starring Fredric March, who plays a possessed doctor who tests his new formula that can unleash people&#x27;s inner demons. The film is an adaptation of &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, the 1886 Robert Louis Stevenson tale of a man who takes a potion which turns him from a mild-mannered man of science into a homicidal maniac. The film was a critical and commercial success upon its release. Nominated for three Academy Awards, March won the award for Best Actor, sharing the award with Wallace Beery for &quot;The Champ&quot;.

==Plot==
Dr. Henry Jekyll (Fredric March), a kind English doctor in Victorian London, is certain that within each man lurks impulses for both good and evil. He is desperately in love with his fiancée Muriel Carew (Rose Hobart) and wants to marry her immediately. But her father, Brigadier General Sir Danvers Carew (Halliwell Hobbes), orders them to wait. One night, while walking home with his colleague, Dr. John Lanyon (Holmes Herbert), Jekyll spots a bar singer, Ivy Pierson (Miriam Hopkins), being attacked by a man outside her boarding house. Jekyll drives the man away and carries Ivy up to her room to attend to her. Ivy tries to seduce Jekyll but, though he is tempted, he leaves with Lanyon.

When Sir Danvers takes Muriel to Bath, Jekyll begins to experiment with drugs that he believes will unleash his evil side. After imbibing a concoction of these drugs, he transforms into Edward Hyde—an impulsive, sadistic, violent, amoral man who indulges his every desire. Hyde finds Ivy in the music hall where she works. He offers to financially support her in return for her company. They stay at her boarding house where Hyde rapes and psychologically manipulates her. When Hyde reads in the paper that Sir Danvers and Muriel are planning to return to London, Hyde leaves Ivy but threatens her that he&#x27;ll return when she least expects it.

Overcome with guilt, Jekyll sends £50 to Ivy. On the advice of her landlady, Ivy goes to see Dr. Jekyll and recognizes him as the man who saved her from abuse that night. She tearfully tells him about her situation with Hyde, and Jekyll reassures her that she will never see Hyde again. But the next night, while walking to a party at Muriel&#x27;s where the wedding date is to be announced, Jekyll again changes into Hyde upon seeing a cat stalk and kill a bird. Rather than attend the party, Hyde goes to Ivy&#x27;s room and murders her.

Hyde returns to Jekyll&#x27;s house but is refused admission by the butler. Desperate, Hyde writes a letter to Lanyon instructing him to take certain chemicals from Jekyll&#x27;s laboratory and take them home. When Hyde arrives, Lanyon pulls a gun on him and demands that Hyde take him to Jekyll. With no other choice, Hyde drinks the formula and changes back into Jekyll before a shocked Lanyon.

Aware that he cannot control the transformations, Jekyll goes to the Carew home and breaks off the engagement. After he leaves, he stands on the terrace and watches Muriel cry. This triggers another transformation and, as Hyde, he enters the house and assaults Muriel. Sir Danvers tries to stop him, but Hyde beats him to death with Jekyll&#x27;s walking stick then flees back to Jekyll&#x27;s laboratory where he takes the formula again and reverts to Jekyll.

Lanyon recognizes the broken cane left at the crime scene and takes the police to Jekyll&#x27;s home. Jekyll tells them that Hyde has already left, Lanyon insists that Jekyll and Hyde are one and the same. The stress causes another transformation into an enraged Hyde and, after a fierce struggle, Hyde is shot by the police. Dying, he transforms back into Jekyll.

* Holmes Herbert as Dr. John Lanyon

==Production==

The film was made before the full enforcement of the Production Code, and it is remembered today for its strong sexual content, embodied mostly in the character of the bar singer Ivy Pierson, played by Miriam Hopkins. When it was re-released in 1936, the Code required 8 minutes to be removed before the film could be distributed to theaters. This footage was restored for the VHS and DVD releases.

The secret of the transformation scenes was not revealed for decades, when Mamoulian revealed it in &quot;The Celluloid Muse&quot; (1969), a volume of interviews with Hollywood directors. Make-up was applied in contrasting colors. A series of colored filters that matched the make-up was then used which enabled the make-up to be exposed gradually or made invisible. The change in color was not visible on the black-and-white film.

Wally Westmore&#x27;s make-up for Hyde — simian and hairy with large canine teeth — greatly influenced the popular image of Hyde in media and comic books. In part, this look reflected the novella&#x27;s implication of Hyde as embodying repressed evil, and hence being semi-evolved or simian in appearance. The characters of Muriel Carew and Ivy Pierson do not appear in Stevenson&#x27;s original story; Ivy Pierson&#x27;s character is original to the film, and Muriel [Agnes] Carew appears in the 1887 stage version by playwright Thomas Russell Sullivan.

John Barrymore was asked by Paramount to play the lead role in an attempt to recreate his role from the 1920 version of Jekyll and Hyde, but he was already under a new contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Paramount suggested Irving Pichel for the role, but the director felt that while he would deliver a fine performance, he was not handsome enough and suggested March. Paramount then gave the part to March, who was under contract and who bore a physical resemblance to Barrymore. March had played a John Barrymore-like character in the Paramount film &quot;The Royal Family of Broadway&quot; (1930), a story about an acting family similar to the Barrymores. March, following stage tradition, overplayed both Jekyll and Hyde to emphasize their contrasts, and he won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance of the role.

When Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer remade the film 10 years later with Spencer Tracy in the lead, the studio bought the negative and the rights to both the Mamoulian version and the earlier 1920 silent version, paying $125,000. Every print of the 1931 film that could be located was recalled and destroyed, and for decades, the film was believed lost. The Tracy version was much less well received, and March jokingly sent Tracy a telegram thanking him for the greatest boost to his reputation of his entire career.

The opening credits music is &quot;Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565&quot; by Johann Sebastian Bach.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; premiered in Los Angeles on December 24, 1931 and opened in New York City on December 31, 1931. Grossing $1.25 million in domestic rentals, the film was a box office hit on par with the Universal monster films of the era, even considering that its $535,000 budget was high for a horror film at the time.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; received mostly positive reviews upon its release.
Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote an enthusiastic review, comparing it favorably to the John Barrymore version as a &quot;far more tense and shuddering affair&quot; than that film. Hall called March &quot;the stellar performer&quot; in the title role while praising the acting of the entire supporting cast as well, and called the old-fashioned atmosphere created by the costumes and set designs &quot;quite pleasing&quot;.

Film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film 3 out of a possible 4 stars, calling it &quot;exciting&quot;, and &quot;floridly cinematic&quot;, also praising March&#x27;s and Hopkins performances.

&quot;Variety&quot; ran a somewhat less favorable but still positive review. Alfred Rushford Greason wrote that &quot;the picture doesn&#x27;t build to an effective climax&quot; because it was too slow and labored in getting there, and that while the initial transformation sequence &quot;carries a terrific punch&quot;, its effect became lessened with successive uses. However, Greason credited March with &quot;an outstanding bit of theatrical acting&quot;, declared the makeup &quot;a triumph&quot;, and said that the sets and lighting alone made the film worth seeing &quot;as models of atmospheric surroundings.&quot;

John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; reported that the film &quot;has its full storage of horror&quot; and was &quot;well acted&quot;. March, he wrote, &quot;gives us a Mr. Hyde as athletic and exuberant as might have been that of Douglas Fairbanks, Senior.&quot; &quot;Film Daily&quot; declared: &quot;Gripping performance by Fredric March is highlight of strong drama, ace supporting cast and direction&quot;.

Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 91%, based on , with a rating average of 8.3/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A classic. The definitive version of the Robert Louis Stevenson novella from 1931, with innovative special effects, atmospheric cinematography and deranged overacting.&quot;

<doc id="144776" wikidata="Q1246683" url="?curid=144776" title="Alfred Lunt">
<text>Alfred David Lunt (August 12, 1892 – August 3, 1977) was an American actor and director, best known for his long stage partnership with his wife, Lynn Fontanne, from the 1920s to 1960, co-starring in Broadway and West End productions. After their marriage, they nearly always appeared together. They became known as &quot;the Lunts&quot; and were celebrated on both sides of the Atlantic.

Although they appeared in classics including &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, &quot;The Seagull&quot; and &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, and dark comedy by Friedrich Dürrenmatt, The Lunts were best known for their stylish performances in light comedies by Noël Coward, S. N. Behrman, Terence Rattigan and others, and romantic plays by writers such as Robert E. Sherwood. Lunt directed some of the couple&#x27;s productions, and staged plays for other managements. Though they rarely acted for the camera, The Lunts each received an Emmy Award and were nominated for an Academy Award.

The Lunts retired from the stage in 1960, and lived at their home in Genesee Depot, Wisconsin. Lunt died in 1977 and Fontanne in 1983.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Alfred David Lunt Jr., was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on August 12, 1892, the son of Alfred David Lunt and his wife Harriet Washburn &quot;née&quot; Briggs. Alfred senior was a prosperous lumberman and land agent. He died in 1894, leaving more than $500,000 to his family. His widow, an eccentric and willful woman, gradually lost all the money, and the family moved to Waukesha, where they ran a boarding house. From an early age, Lunt had a fascination with the theatre. He began acting in high school and at Carroll College in Waukesha. Considering a career as an architect, he transferred to Emerson College, Boston, in 1912. His biographer Jared Brown writes that Lunt &quot;rarely attended classes, having found a job as a minor actor and assistant stage manager with the Castle Square Theatre in Boston&quot;. He made his first professional stage appearance there on October 7, 1912, as the Sheriff in &quot;The Aviator&quot;, and remained as a member of the stock company for two years.
In 1914, Lunt toured with Margaret Anglin in &quot;Beverley&#x27;s Balance&quot;, remaining with her company for eighteen months, appearing in &quot;Green Stockings&quot;, &quot;As You Like It&quot;, &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot; and &quot;Medea&quot;. He then toured with, successively, Lillie Langtry, Laura Hope Crews and Anglin again. In 1917, he made his Broadway debut with Crews&#x27;s company, playing Claude Estabrook in &quot;Romance and Arabella&quot;. He then appeared in a summer stock season in Washington, D.C., where he met Lynn Fontanne, a rising young English actress. They fell in love, although at first Lunt&#x27;s wooing was more hesitant than Fontanne would have wished.

In 1919, Lunt had his first important leading part. He played the title role in Booth Tarkington&#x27;s comedy &quot;Clarence&quot; (1919), which ran on Broadway for 323 performances. In May 1922, he married Fontanne, and in 1923 they made their first appearance together in a Broadway production, a revival of Paul Kester&#x27;s 1900 costume drama &quot;Sweet Nell of Old Drury&quot;.

===Theatre Guild===
In 1924, the Lunts joined the company of the Theatre Guild, which, as Brown puts it, &quot;staged plays on Broadway but defied Broadway conventions by offering serious and innovative plays that were regularly rejected by commercial managements&quot;. The first play in which the couple appeared for the Guild was Ferenc Molnár&#x27;s &quot;The Guardsman&quot;, in which they established a reputation for playing light comedy. They acted together in three plays by Shaw: &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; (as Bluntschli and Raina, 1925), &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (as Higgins and Eliza, 1926) and &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; (as the Dubedats, 1927). Lunt&#x27;s other roles in his early years with the Guild included Dmitri Karamazov in &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, Marco Polo in &quot;Marco Millions&quot; and Mosca in &quot;Volpone&quot;.
Lunt and Fontanne introduced a naturalistic new way of delivering dialogue, building on a technique Fontanne had begun to explore when acting with Laurette Taylor, earlier in her career. It was unheard of for an actor to speak while another was still speaking, but, in Brown&#x27;s words:
As a consequence, according to Brown, the Lunts&#x27; scenes together could be &quot;more vivid, more &quot;real&quot; than those of other actors&quot;.

In 1928, Lunt and Fontanne co-starred in what for the Guild was an untypically frothy comedy, &quot;Caprice&quot;. The biographer Margot Peters calls the production a milestone in their careers for two reasons: it was the first production in which they, rather than the play, were the main draw, and it marked the start of their inseparable theatrical partnership: from then on they always appeared together. They took &quot;Caprice&quot; to London in 1930 – Lunt&#x27;s first appearance there – and won the admiration of audiences, critics, and writers including Shaw and J. B. Priestley. For the Guild in New York, Lunt and Fontanne starred in Robert Sherwood&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Reunion in Vienna&quot;, which opened in November 1931 and ran throughout the season, before a nationwide tour. The two were strong believers in touring, taking many of their Broadway hits to remote locations as well as the larger American cities. They felt a double responsibility to do so: to ensure that playwrights had their works presented to as many people as possible, and to allow people outside New York to see Broadway productions.

===&quot;Design for Living&quot;===

Among Lunt and Fontanne&#x27;s closest friends was Noël Coward. The three had met in New York in 1921, when Coward was a struggling young playwright and actor. They had resolved then that when they were famous, Coward would write a play for all three of them to star in. The Lunts&#x27; marriage was the subject of much conjecture in theatrical circles: although they were clearly devoted to each other, there were unsubstantiated but persistent rumors that Lunt was bisexual and had gay liaisons; there was also speculation that Fontanne had extramarital interests. Against this background, Coward wrote a comedy for the three of them, &quot;Design for Living&quot; (1932), in which Fontanne&#x27;s character switches back and forth between the two men, who then pair up when she deserts them both, before all three end up together. Coward recorded that while he was refining his original ideas for the play, &quot;Alfred had suggested a few stage directions which, if followed faithfully, would undoubtedly have landed all three of us in gaol&quot;. The combination of the risqué subject and the popularity of the three stars caused box-office records to be broken, and reportedly earned the three stars the highest salaries ever paid on Broadway to that time.

The immense success of &quot;Design for Living&quot; led Coward to write another play for his friends, but his &quot;Point Valaine,&quot; in which Lunt and Fontanne starred in 1934, was a failure. For Coward, the piece was an uncharacteristically serious drama, and the grim plot and unsympathetic characters did not appeal to audiences used to seeing the Lunts in glamorous and romantic roles; Fontanne&#x27;s prediction that the play would run for just a few weeks proved correct. It was the only outright failure of the Lunts&#x27; joint career.

=== 1934 to 1945 ===
Between the two Coward plays in New York, Lunt and Fontanne played in London, in &quot;Reunion in Vienna&quot;, repeating their American success with the piece. &quot;The Times&quot; commented:

Besides starring in the piece, Lunt directed the London production. He continued to direct throughout his career, staging not only some of the Lunts&#x27; productions but those of other companies.
For the rest of the 1930s, the Lunts appeared in Guild productions in New York and on tour. In 1935 they played Petruchio and Katherina in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;; in 1936 they starred in a new Sherwood play, &quot;Idiot&#x27;s Delight&quot;; in 1937 they took the leading roles in S. N. Behrman&#x27;s adaptation of Jean Giraudoux&#x27;s comedy &quot;Amphitryon 38&quot;; and in 1938 they played Trigorin and Arkadina in &quot;The Seagull&quot; on Broadway and took the production of &quot;Amphitryon 38&quot; to London before touring it extensively in the US in repertory with &quot;Idiot&#x27;s Delight&quot; and &quot;The Seagull&quot;.

The Lunts had a country estate, known as Ten Chimneys, in Genesee Depot, Wisconsin. It was close to where Lunt had grown up, and he had bought the site with his inheritance when he came of age in 1913. It was their summer home, where they entertained a great many theatrical friends and colleagues over the decades. Carol Channing later said &quot;Genesee Depot is to performers what the Vatican is to Catholics&quot;. Since 2003, Ten Chimneys has been a National Historic Landmark. The Lunts gave up their usual summer break there during the latter part of the Second World War, because at Fontanne&#x27;s behest the couple moved to England. She felt she should share the hardships of her family and friends there, and from 1943 to 1945 the Lunts appeared in the West End, and in performances for the troops, including a tour of army camps in France and Germany in 1945.

===Later years and death===
After the war Lunt and Fontanne returned to the US and resumed their association with the Theatre Guild. They appeared in 1946–47 in Terence Rattigan&#x27;s comedy &quot;Love In Idleness&quot; (given on Broadway under the title &quot;O Mistress Mine&quot;), and in 1949–50 in &quot;I Know My Love&quot;, Berhman&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Auprès de ma blonde&quot; by Marcel Achard; these productions ran for 482 and 247 performances respectively. The Lunts toured the latter throughout the US.
Lunt continued to direct. Among his productions was &quot;Così fan Tutte&quot;, sung in English, at the Metropolitan Opera in December 1951, critically praised and much revived subsequently. In the first performances of the production, Lunt made a rare stage appearance without Fontanne, in the silent role of a footman, opening the opera by lighting candles and exiting before the action began.

Lunt and Fontanne returned to England in 1952 for their third and final Coward premiere, &quot;Quadrille&quot;, a romantic comedy set in the 1870s. After a West End run of 329 performances they took the play to Broadway in 1954, where Lunt directed as well as starring. The piece ran for 159 performances; it could have profitably run for longer, but the Lunts chose to close in March 1955. Their last Broadway premiere was in Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse&#x27;s &quot;melodramatic comedy&quot; &quot;The Great Sebastians&quot; in 1956. After a six-month run in New York they toured the piece throughout the US. Their final production was in 1957: &quot;The Visit&quot;, Maurice Valency&#x27;s adaptation of Friedrich Dürrenmatt&#x27;s &quot;Der Besuch der alten Dame&quot;, in which a rich old woman exacts a terrible revenge on the man who betrayed her fifty years earlier. They toured the play in Britain in 1957–58, initially under the title &quot;Time and Again&quot;, in a production directed by Peter Brook. In May 1958 they opened the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in New York with the same play (by then renamed &quot;The Visit&quot;) and toured it in the US. In June 1960, in Brook&#x27;s production, they opened the new Royalty Theatre, London, running until 19 October. A final week playing the piece at the Golders Green Hippodrome in November was the Lunts&#x27; last stage appearance.

After retiring from acting, Lunt continued to direct. At the Morosco Theatre in 1961, he directed Samuel A. Taylor&#x27;s &quot;First Love&quot;, and for the Metropolitan Opera he directed &quot;La Traviata&quot; in 1966, starring Anna Moffo as Violetta, with designs by Cecil Beaton.

Lunt died of cancer in a hospital in Chicago on August 3, 1977, aged 84. On the day after the news was released, every Broadway theatre dimmed its lights for one minute at 7.59 p.m., except for the Lunt-Fontanne, which remained brilliantly lit. Fontanne outlived Lunt by six years, dying at Ten Chimneys in 1983. The two are buried together at Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee.

==Cinema and broadcasting==
The Lunts disliked acting for the camera and made only three films together. One was &quot;The Guardsman&quot; (1931), for which they were both nominated for Academy Awards. They appeared in &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot; (1943) in which they had cameos as themselves. The two starred in four television productions in the 1950s and 1960s, with both Lunt and Fontanne winning Emmy Awards in 1965 for &quot;The Magnificent Yankee&quot;.

==Honors==
In September 1964, Lunt and Fontanne were presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon Johnson at a White House ceremony. Both the Lunts were members of the American Theater Hall of Fame. In 1947, Lunt was awarded the American Academy of Arts and Letters Medal for Good Speech on the Stage. He received honorary degrees from Carroll College, Dartmouth College, Beloit College, Emerson College, New York University, Yale University, and the University of Wisconsin.

<text>Hefei is the capital of Anhui, China. A prefecture-level city, it is the political, economic, and cultural center of Anhui. Its population was 9,369,881 as of the 2020 census. Its built-up (or &quot;metro&quot;) area is made up of four urban districts plus Feidong, Feixi and Changfeng counties being urbanized, was home to 7,754,481 inhabitants. Located in the central portion of the province, it borders Huainan to the north, Chuzhou to the northeast, Wuhu to the southeast, Tongling to the south, Anqing to the southwest and Lu&#x27;an to the west. A natural hub of communications, Hefei is situated to the north of Chao Lake and stands on a low saddle crossing the northeastern extension of the Dabie Mountains, which forms the divide between the Huai and Yangtze rivers.

The present-day city dates from the Song dynasty. Before World War II, Hefei remained essentially an administrative centre and the regional market for the fertile plain to the south. It has gone through a growth in infrastructure in recent years. Hefei is the location of Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak, an experimental superconducting tokamak magnetic fusion energy reactor.

Hefei is a world leading city for scientific research, with its ranking placed at 13th globally, 8th in the Asia-Pacific and 6th in China (behind Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou and Wuhan), as tracked by the Nature Index in 2023. The city is represented by several major universities, including the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei University of Technology, Anhui University, Anhui Agricultural University and Anhui Medical University. Notably, the University of Science and Technology of China is one of the top 100 comprehensive public research universities in the world.

==History==

From the 8th to the 6th centuries BC, Hefei was the site of many small states, later a part of the Chu kingdom. Many archaeological finds dating from this period have been made. The name &#x27;Hefei&#x27; was first given to the county set up in the area under the Han dynasty in the 2nd century BC.

In the 3rd century AD, the Battle of Xiaoyao Ford was fought at Xiaoyao Ford () in Hefei. Zhang Liao, a general of the Wei state, led 800 picked cavalry to defeat the 200,000-strong army from Wei&#x27;s rival state Wu. Several decades of warring in Hefei between Wu and Wei followed this battle.

During the 4th to the 6th centuries AD, this crucial border region between northern and southern states was much fought over; its name and administrative status were consequently often changed. During the Sui (581–618) and Tang (618–907) periods, it became the seat of Lu prefecture—a title it kept until the 15th century, when it became a superior prefecture named Luzhou.

The present city dates from the Song dynasty (960–1126), the earlier Hefei having been some distance farther north. In the 10th year of Xining (, 1077 AD), the taxes collected from the Luchow Prefecture were 50315 Guan, approximately 25 million today&#x27;s Chinese Yuan, with a ranking of the amount of taxes was the 11th(following Kaifeng, Hangzhou, Qinzhou, Chuzhou, Chengdu, Zizhou, Xingyuan, Mianzhou, Zhenzhou, Suzhou) among all the prefectures of Song Dynasty. During the 10th century, it was for a while the capital of the independent Wu kingdom (902–938) and was an important center of the Southern Tang state (937–975).

After 1127 it became a center of the defenses of the Southern Song dynasty (1126–1279) against the Jin (Jurchen) invaders in the Jin–Song wars, as well as a flourishing center of trade between the two states. When the Chinese Republic was founded in 1911, the superior prefecture was abolished, and the city took the name of Hefei. The city was known as Luchow or Liu-tcheou (, &quot;Luzhou&quot;) during the Ming and Qing dynasties (after the 14th century to the 19th century). Hefei was the temporary capital for Anhui from 1853 to 1862. It was renamed as Hefei County in 1912. Following the Chinese victory in the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1945, Hefei was made the capital of Anhui.

Before World War II, Hefei remained essentially an administrative center and the regional market for the fertile plain to the south. It was a collecting center for grain, beans, cotton, and hemp, as well as a center for handicraft industries manufacturing cloth, leather, bamboo goods, and ironware.

The construction in 1912 of the Tianjin–Pukou railway, farther east, for a while made Hefei a provincial backwater, and much of its importance passed to Bengbu. In 1932–36, however, a Chinese company built a railway linking Hefei with Yuxikou (on the Yangtze opposite Wuhu) to the southeast and with the Huai River at Huainan to the north. While this railway was built primarily to exploit the rich coalfield in northern Anhui, it also did much to revive the economy of the Hefei area by taking much of its produce to Wuhu and Nanjing.

Although Hefei was a quiet market town of only about 30,000 in the mid-1930s, its population grew more than tenfold in the following 20 years. The city&#x27;s administrative role was strengthened by the transfer of the provincial government from Anqing in 1945, but much of its new growth derived from its development as an industrial city.

Hefei was designated the provincial capital in 1952.

A cotton mill was opened in 1958, and a thermal generating plant, using coal from Huainan, was established in the early 1950s. It also became the seat of an industry producing industrial chemicals and chemical fertilizers. In the late 1950s an iron and steel complex was built. In addition to a machine-tool works and engineering and agricultural machinery factories, the city has developed an aluminum industry and a variety of light industries.

Hefei&#x27;s development was advanced by the Third Front construction. In 1970, the University of Science and Technology of China relocated to Hefei. It is one of the best technological universities in the country.

In 1978, the Chinese Academy of Sciences opened a Hefei branch. Several electronics institutes were moved from Beijing to Hefei in the early 1980s. The establishment of these educational and research and development institutions in Hefei were a foundations for its subsequent growth in innovation.

In 1991, Hefei was one of the first Chinese cities to establish a High-Tech Industrial Zone.

A period of rapid growth began in 2005, when Hefei party secretary Sun Jinlong initiated a strategy of industry-based city building. Sun prioritized the automobile, electric appliance, and equipment manufacturing sectors of the city&#x27;s economy. The city government established a department for attracting investment and sent teams around the country to recruit businesses to Hefei. Sun also launched a construction program of neighborhood redevelopment, road system improvement, rail system, and a new international airport. Hefei&#x27;s GDP grew at the highest rate of any Chinese provincial capital during Sun&#x27;s tenure.

<text>The Guardsman is a 1931 American pre-Code film based on the play &quot;Testőr&quot; by Ferenc Molnár. It stars Alfred Lunt, Lynn Fontanne, Roland Young and ZaSu Pitts. It opens with a stage re-enactment of the final scene of Maxwell Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Elizabeth the Queen&quot;, with Fontanne as Elizabeth and Lunt as the Earl of Essex, but otherwise has nothing to do with that play.

The film was adapted by Ernest Vajda (screenplay) and Claudine West (continuity) and was directed by Sidney Franklin. Lunt and Fontanne were husband and wife and a celebrated stage acting team. This film was based upon the roles they had played on Broadway in 1924 and it was their only starring film role together. They were nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Actress in a Leading Role, respectively. Nonetheless, the film was not a popular success at the box office, and the two stars returned to working on Broadway.

==Plot==
The story revolves around a husband-and-wife acting team. Simply because he is insecure, the husband suspects his wife could be capable of infidelity. The husband disguises himself as a guardsman with a thick accent, woos his wife under his false identity, and ends up seducing her. The couple stays together, and at the end the wife convinces her husband that she knew it was him, but played along with the deception.

==Cast==
* Alfred Lunt as The Actor
* Lynn Fontanne as The Actress
* Roland Young as Bernhardt the Critic
* ZaSu Pitts as Liesl, the Maid
* Maude Eburne as Mama
* Herman Bing as A Creditor

==Remakes==
*In 1941, the plot and much of the script was used for the film version of Oscar Straus&#x27;s operetta &quot;The Chocolate Soldier&quot;, starring Risë Stevens and Nelson Eddy. The stage production had used the plot of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;, but Shaw had been deeply offended and angered at the result. For the film, MGM decided instead to use the plot of Molnar&#x27;s &quot;The Guardsman&quot;, but it kept the stage score of &quot;The Chocolate Soldier&quot;. The film was a great success.
*On March 2, 1955, a 60-minute version of the play was aired on the series &quot;The Best of Broadway&quot;.
*In 1984, a new non-musical version, titled &quot;Lily in Love&quot;, starring Christopher Plummer and Maggie Smith, was made, but the play was so altered that the names of the characters were changed and Molnar was not even given screen credit. The film was a total flop.

<text>eDonkey2000 (nicknamed &quot;ed2k&quot;) was a peer-to-peer file sharing application developed by US company MetaMachine (Jed McCaleb and Sam Yagan), using the Multisource File Transfer Protocol. It supported both the eDonkey2000 network and the Overnet network.

On September 28, 2005, eDonkey was discontinued following a cease and desist letter from the RIAA.

== eDonkey2000 network ==
Users on the eDonkey2000 network predominantly share large files of tens or hundreds of megabytes, such as CD images, videos, games, and software programs. To ease file searching, some websites list the checksums of sought-after files in the form of an ed2k link. Some of those websites also have lists of active servers for users to update.

MetaMachines has also created another file-sharing network called Overnet, which interoperates with the eDonkey network, but without the use of servers. Most eDonkey clients also now use the Overnet network. In 2004, MetaMachines announced it would stop development of Overnet to concentrate on eDonkey2000 (though the eDonkey2000 client now includes the Overnet protocol).

eDonkey has since been closed down.

==Early history and design==
eDonkey2000 was created by Jed McCaleb, cofounder of Stellar, and was first released on September 6, 2000. On September 16, 2000, client and server versions were available for Microsoft Windows and Linux.

Compared to earlier P2P file-sharing program Napster, eDonkey2000 featured &quot;swarming&quot; downloads, meaning that clients could download different pieces of a single file from different peers, effectively utilizing the combined bandwidth of all of the peers instead of being limited to the bandwidth of a single peer.

At first, servers were isolated from one another as with Napster, but later versions of the eDonkey2000 server software enabled servers to form a search network. This allowed servers to forward search queries from their locally connected clients to other servers, allowing clients to effectively find peers connected to any server on the server network, thereby increasing download swarm size. It also allowed clients to find and download files not available from clients connected to the same server.

A third improvement compared to Napster was the use of file hashes instead of simple filenames in search results. File searches initiated by the user were keyword-based and matched against the filename list stored on the eDonkey2000 server, but the server returned a list of filenames paired with the hash values of those files to the client. When selecting a file from the list presented to the user, the client would actually initiate a download by hash value. This meant that a file could have many different filenames across different peers, but would be considered identical for purposes of downloading if its hash was the same.

The two-level (client and server) peer-to-peer network architecture offered a balance between centralized systems like Napster, and decentralized systems like Gnutella. Where Napster ultimately proved to be vulnerable was its centralized server cluster, which was a stable target for legal action. Gnutella&#x27;s original design, featuring total elimination of the server network in favor of purely peer-to-peer searching, quickly proved to be infeasible due to massive search traffic overhead between peers.

Later 2nd-level P2P file sharing systems use a similar design to eDonkey2000 (downloading files in pieces by hash from multiple peers simultaneously) but innovate in the design of the server network, such as in the case of BitTorrent, which separates the file search feature (&quot;torrent search&quot;) from the download peer locating feature (&quot;torrent tracker&quot;).

== eDonkey2000 client ==
The latest version of the official eDonkey2000 client included a plugin that allowed BitTorrent files to be downloaded. Once a torrent download begins the search facility within eDonkey can find the same file within the eDonkey/Overnet network and synchronise its download. This effectively allowed a torrent to be used as another source for the download, vastly increasing speed as well as virtually eliminating problems with fakes. Torrents are very &quot;clean&quot; in terms of falsely labelled files and their use as file size verifiers in addition to eDonkey2000&#x27;s own user-based fake warning system has vastly improved the network&#x27;s functionality. By effectively combining the range of the existing Overnet and eDonkey networks with the lightning-fast file distribution of the BitTorrent system, eDonkey2000 was following a growing trend amongst peer-to-peer programmes of integrating downloads from multiple networks. This has the advantage of maximising the number of files available while limiting vulnerability to problems on a single network.

== eDonkey sued by RIAA ==
In September 2005, officials from the company MetaMachine received a cease and desist letter from the RIAA as a result of the June 2005 Supreme Court ruling &quot;MGM Studios v. Grokster&quot; that makers of software that facilitates copyright infringement are liable for that infringement. Many news sites reported that on September 22, 2005, MetaMachine&#x27;s corporate offices have closed. This was apparently inaccurate, based on the aforementioned news sites checking for the old eDonkey headquarters in New York (the new ones being in New Jersey, as they had moved there).

However, on September 28, 2005, eDonkey officially closed its doors. MetaMachine President Sam Yagan said in a statement that the company would &quot;convert eDonkey&#x27;s user base to an online content retailer operating in a closed P2P environment,&quot; and &quot;such a transaction to take place as soon as we can reach a settlement with the RIAA&quot;. This had little effect on the network as a whole, as eDonkey clients only made up a small minority of the whole network.

On September 12, 2006 it was reported that MetaMachine, Inc. had agreed to settle with the RIAA for $30 million, and the website is replaced by a text advertisement reflecting the RIAA&#x27;s interpretation of copyright law.

Nevertheless, the eDonkey network is still available through other clients, such as eMule or aMule.

<text>Uckfield () is a town in the Wealden District of East Sussex in South East England. The town is on the River Uck, one of the tributaries of the River Ouse, on the southern edge of the Weald.

==Etymology==
&quot;Uckfield&quot;, first recorded in writing as &quot;Uckefeld&quot; in 1220, is an Anglo-Saxon place name meaning &quot;open land of a man called Ucca&quot;. It combines an Old English personal name, &quot;Ucca&quot; with the Old English locational term, &quot;feld&quot;, the latter denoting open country or unencumbered ground (or, from the 10th century onwards, arable land). A number of other places in the area also contain the suffix &quot;feld&quot;, which may be an indication of land that contrasts with the surrounding woodlands of the Weald, including in particular Ashdown Forest immediately to the north.

==History==
: A comprehensive historical timeline can be found at &quot;A vision of Britain&quot; website.
The first mention in historical documents is in the late 13th century. Uckfield developed as a stopping-off point on the pilgrimage route between Canterbury, Chichester and Lewes. The settlement began to develop around the bridging point of the river, including the locally famous Pudding Cake Lane where travellers visited a public house for slices of pudding cake; and the 15th-century &quot;Bridge Cottage&quot;, the oldest house still standing in Uckfield, now a museum. The town developed in the High Street and in the New Town areas (the latter to the south of the original town centre).

The Eversfield family, who later became prominent in Sussex history, giving their name to the prime waterfront street of St Leonards-on-Sea, first settled in Uckfield from their Surrey beginnings. The family, who later owned the mansion Denne Park in Horsham, which they represented in Parliament, acquired a large fortune through marriage, real estate acquisition and iron foundering. Their climb to wealth and prominence was a heady one: in 15th-century Sussex they were described as &quot;yeomen&quot;, but within a generation they were already among the first rank of Sussex gentry.

===Church Street===
Church Street was at the heart of the original settlement of Uckfield, near the medieval chapel (built c.1291), which was replaced by the present parish church in 1839. It is situated on an ancient ridgeway route from the direction of Winchester in the west, to Rye and Canterbury in the east. Local hostelries along the route are the Maiden&#x27;s Head, the King&#x27;s Head (now the Cinque Ports) or the Spread Eagle. Uckfield was part of the Archbishop&#x27;s extensive Manor of South Malling.

Church Street contains a number of post-medieval buildings. These include the Old Grammar School (home of the former Uckfield Grammar School, closed in 1930), Bakers Cottage and the Malt House with Malt Cottage (all built before 1700), and Church House with Andertons, Copping Hall and Milton Cottage (all 18th century).

===Bridge Cottage===

Studies suggest that the cottage dates to around 1436. Between 1500 and 1900, it was inhabited by a number of local families, including local merchants. In October 2014, the Heritage Lottery Fund granted one million pounds to enable the restoration of the cottage. Work started in October 2014, with an estimated completion date of late summer 2015.

==Governance==

The town council consists of 15 councillors, representing five wards: West ward (2 councillors); New Town (4); North (3); East (3); and Ridgewood (3). Mayoral elections take place every year.

Uckfield was previously represented at Westminster by Charles Hendry, Member of Parliament for the constituency of Wealden from 2001 until he stood down at the 2015 general election.

On 7 May 2015, Nus Ghani was elected as the MP for Wealden with a majority of 22,967. In the 2017 snap general election, Ghani was re-elected with a slightly increased majority of 23,268.

==Geography==
The town of Uckfield has grown up as a road hub, and on the crossing point of the River Uck. Traffic on the A26 between Royal Tunbridge Wells and Lewes, from the north-east to the south-west, joins with that on the A22 London – Eastbourne road around the town on its bypass; whilst the long-distance cross-country A272 road (the old pilgrimage route) crosses them both north of the town.

As the town has grown, new housing estates were developed: Hempstead Fields, Harlands Farm, Rocks Park, West Park, Manor Park and Ringles Cross among them.

Parts of Uckfield, owing to its location on the river, have been subject to extensive flooding on a number of occasions, the earliest recorded being in 1852. More recent floods have occurred approximately every nine years: in 1962, 1974, 1989, 1994, 2000 and 2007, although those in 2007 were not as severe as previous floods. Local residents have long been lobbying for flood defences in the town, and when the local Somerfield became a Co-op (now Waitrose), its car park&#x27;s walls were rebuilt as flood defences with a ramp to access the car park and a watertight pedestrian gate that can be closed when flooding is imminent. It is hoped that this new wall will act as a reservoir to contain the flood water until it recedes, allowing the water to flow back into the river Uck, which runs alongside the carpark.

Due to the positioning of the river within Uckfield, any flooding is within the lowest part of the town centre and industrial estate, and so does not affect residential areas as these are all built on higher ground. The Hempstead Meadows Nature Reserve can be accessed from the car park (now owned by Waitrose, who took over from the Co-op) and shows classic meadows formed on the flood plain.

The West Park Nature Reserve contains a wide variety of habitats; it is located on the western edge of the town.

===Nature Reserves===

*West Park

West Park is a Local Nature Reserve. It has several access points, and is a vestige of ancient parkland, containing herb rich uncultivated wet meadow, woodland, some thriving wildlife and the remains of Mesolithic settlement.

*Hempstead Meadows

Hempstead Meadows is a Local Nature Reserve. The River Uck runs through the flood plain, occupied by the Hempstead Nature Reserve, and is an important area of wetland. The area has an abundance of unusual flora and fauna, which flourish on this ideal site. A new footpath, the River walk is a recent introduction to this area.

*Harlands Pond
Harlands Pond, located via Mallard Drive, home of the common toad. Regular visitors include the grey heron, in addition to its permanent residents, the coot and moorhen.

*Nightingale Wood
Almost adjacent to the pond is Nightingale Wood. This is a cool, shady haven, containing many different tree species and is a valuable site for early purple orchids.

*Uckfield Millennium Green
This 22-acre Millennium Green is one of the largest. To the south of the town, in Ridgewood, the Green was created on a site of three disused clay pits (now a SNCI) at the turn of the Millennium.

==Development==
East Sussex County Council completed phase one of the Uckfield Town Centre Highway Improvement Scheme (UTC-HIS) in November 2014. In January 2016, phase two of the highway improvements were started, taking approximately eight months. The scheme involved the creation of 10,000 m2 of retail space within the town. It also limits to 1000 the number of new homes to be built between then and 2027.

In June 2015, the Ridgewood Farm development was granted outline planning approval. The development would see 1000 new homes of which a minimum of 15 per cent would be affordable housing. The development would include a two-form primary school, a large employment space, community, health and leisure facilities and pedestrian and cycle paths, and a 73-acre Suitable Alternative Natural Green Space (Sangs) nearby.

In July 2015, Network Rail announced plans to upgrade the platforms at Uckfield railway station to accommodate trains with up to 12 carriages. The works were predicted to last from November 2015 until March 2016.

In March 2016, developers were granted a 75 per cent reduction on the roof tax of 146 proposed homes at Mallard Drive, Ridgewood.

==Demography==
The population of Uckfield in 1811 was 916; in 1841, it was 1,534; in 1861, it was 1,740; in 1871, it was 2,041; in 1881, it was 2,146; in 1891, it was 2,497; in 1901, it was 2,895; in 1911, it was 3,344; in 1921, it was 3,385; and in 1931, it was 3,555. In 2001, the population had reached 13,697.

==Transport==

Uckfield is connected to London Bridge station by Southern services on its Oxted Line via East Croydon. Until 1969, the rail link continued to Lewes; after it was closed, Uckfield became the terminus; the station building was rebuilt in 1991 to allow the removal of a level crossing. The Wealden Line Campaign hopes to reopen the closed section to Lewes.

There are 20 local bus services in the Uckfield area; Brighton and Hove, CTLA, Renown Coaches, The Sussex Bus, Seaford &amp; District and Stagecoach in Eastbourne all serve Uckfield. National Express coaches also operate to London.

==Education==
Uckfield College is the secondary school in the town. There are five primary schools; Harlands Primary School, Holy Cross CE Primary School, Rocks Park Primary School St Philips Catholic Primary School and Manor Primary School.

==Churches and chapels==
The Church of England parish church is dedicated to the Holy Cross. Queen Elizabeth II made several unannounced low-profile visits to St Michael and All Angels Church, Little Horsted, which became widely known locally when the newsagent was asked to stock a copy of the &quot;Sporting Life&quot;. The Roman Catholic church is dedicated to Our Lady Immaculate and St Philip Neri. Uckfield Baptist Church was founded in 1785 by seceders from nearby Five Ash Down Independent Chapel, and a new building opened at the top of the High Street in 1789 (rebuilt 1874); it closed in 2005, but the congregation now meet at a school. Other churches and chapels include Methodist, Evangelical (Grange Evangelical Church in Hempstead Road), United Reformed Church and the King&#x27;s Church.

==Notable people==
Emma Lee French was born in Uckfield in 1836. Frank Tuohy, prize-winning author and academic, was born in Uckfield in 1925.

Uckfield was the last place Lord Lucan was seen, at Grants Hill House, the home of his friends Ian and Susan Maxwell-Scott. Lady Lucan, his wife, was born in Uckfield. The actress Marjorie Westbury lived at Maresfield near Uckfield.

Nicholas van Hoogstraten, a property developer, owns property in the area. He was engaged in a long-running dispute with the Ramblers&#x27; Association about a local footpath running through his land. Work came to a halt on Hamilton Palace in 2001.

The singer Rag&#x27;n&#x27;Bone Man is from this town, winner of the Brit Award for Critics&#x27; Choice 2017, he had a number one single across Europe with the song &quot;Human&quot;.

==Folklore==
There are a number of mysteries and myths associated with the town and surrounding areas. The most well known is the disappearance of Lord Lucan, who was reportedly last seen at Grants Hill House in Uckfield. In addition, the hoax of the Piltdown Man occurred in the nearby village of Piltdown. There is a tale of Nan Tuck&#x27;s Ghost, in which an old witch is said to have lived in a wood in nearby Buxted. There is an area of the wood where nothing grows, and the ghost is said to chase people who wander along Nan Tuck&#x27;s Lane at night.

===The Picture House Cinema===

The Picture House, an independently run three-screen cinema, was established in 1916 and is one of the oldest in England.

===Ashdown Radio (formerly Uckfield FM)===

Uckfield FM is a community radio station that supported Uckfield for its four-week festival in June and at Christmas each year. In July 2009 the station was granted a licence by Ofcom to become a full-time community radio station, broadcasting live to Uckfield and the surrounding areas from 1 July 2010. The station was founded by Mike Skinner, Paddy Rea, Gary King and Alan French and now has more than 80 members, who are all voluntary. In the summer of 2008, ITV&#x27;s Trinny and Suzannah was filmed at the Bird in Eye studios when Mayor Louise Eastwood was the star of the show. In 2014, the station was granted a five-year extension to its licence, taking &quot;Uckfield FM&#x27;s service through until 2020&quot;. As of 1 April 2022, the station expanded its FM coverage area to take in the neighbouring town of Crowborough, and has re-launched as Ashdown Radio.

===Uckfield Festival===

The festival was originally intended &quot;as a one off Millennium year celebration&quot;, from this event it has sought to &quot;advance the public in the arts and in particular, the arts of music, speech, drama and the visual arts&quot;. A number of local organisations/events have grown from the festival some of these include The Art Trail, The Film Society &amp; Uckfield FM.

<text>The Russian Blue cat (), commonly referred to as just Russian Blue, is a cat breed with colors that vary from a light shimmering silver to a darker, slate grey. The short, dense coat, which stands out from the body, has been the breed&#x27;s hallmark for more than a century.

== Origin ==
The Russian Blue is a naturally occurring breed that may have originated in the port of Arkhangelsk in Russia. They are also sometimes called Archangel Blues. It is believed that sailors took them from the Archangel Isles to Great Britain and Northern Europe in the 1860s. The first reference to an Archangel Cat appears in British print in 1862. The first recorded appearance of one in a show was in 1872 at The Crystal Palace in England as the Archangel Cat. However, Harrison Weir writing in 1895 reported that the early show cats under the Russian Blue name were British-bred grey tabbies, with separate grey cats arriving from Archangel in Britain in the 1800s with features consistent with the modern breed. The Russian Blue competed in a class including all other blue cats until 1912, when it was given its own class. The breed was developed mainly in England and Scandinavia until after World War II.

Right after the war, a lack of numbers of Russian Blues led to cross breeding with the Siamese. Although Russian Blues were in the United States before the war, it was not until the post-war period that American breeders created the modern Russian Blue that is seen in the United States today. American breeders combined the bloodlines of both the Scandinavian and British Russian Blues. The Siamese traits have now largely been bred out. The short hair and slate-gray/blue color is often seen in mixed-breed cats, which can affect breeders and showers due to mislabeling a cat as a Russian Blue.

Russian Blues are plush short-haired, shimmering pale blue-gray cats with emerald green eyes or yellow eyes. Guard hairs are distinctly silver-tipped giving the cat a silvery sheen or lustrous appearance. They have been used on a limited basis to create other breeds such as the Havana Brown or alter existing breeds such as the Nebelung. They are being used in Italy as a way to make Oriental Shorthairs healthier and more robust called RUS4OSH in FIFe.

Russian Whites and Russian Blacks were created from crosses with domestic white cats which were allegedly imported from Russia. The first line was developed by Frances McLeod (Arctic) in the United Kingdom during the 1960s and the second line produced by Dick and Mavis Jones (Myemgay) in Australia in the 1970s. By the late 1970s, the Russian White and Russian Black colors were accepted by cat fanciers in Australia as well as in South Africa and now also in the United Kingdom as Russian cats (in different classes). However, the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association and FIFe does not recognize any variation of the Russian Blue.

== Physical characteristics ==

The Russian Blue has bright green eyes, pinkish lavender or mauve paws, two layers of short thick fur, and a blue-grey-black coat. The color is a bluish-gray that is the dilute expression of the black gene. However, as dilute genes are recessive (&quot;d&quot;) and each parent will have a set of two recessive genes (&quot;dd&quot;) two non-Color-Point Carrier (non-CPC) Russian Blues will always produce a blue cat. Due to the breeding with Siamese after World War II, there are color-point genes floating around. If two carriers are bred together, then they will produce a litter of mixed colors—solid blue or white with blue-point like a Siamese. People call these CPC cats &quot;color-point&quot;, &quot;whites&quot; or &quot;pointed&quot; Russians. In most registries, one cannot register, breed or show a color-point Russian. These color-point (blue-point) cats are called Color-Point-Russian Blue (Blue Point Russian Blue) or more informally as Pika Blu (or pika blue) cats and have the same general characteristics as the Russian Blue cats.

The coat is known as a &quot;double coat&quot;, with the undercoat being soft, downy and equal in length to the guard hairs, which are an even blue with silver tips. However, the tail may have a few very dull, almost unnoticeable stripes. The coat is described as thick, plush and soft to the touch and can be described as being softer than the softest silk. The silver tips give the coat a shimmering appearance. Its eyes are almost always a dark and vivid green. Any white patches of fur or yellow eyes in adulthood are seen as flaws in show cats. Russian Blues should not be confused with British Blues (which are not a distinct breed, but rather a British Shorthair with a blue coat as the British Shorthair breed itself comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns), nor the Chartreux or Korat which are two other naturally occurring breeds of blue cats, although they have similar traits.
They are generally considered to be a quiet breed but there are always exceptions. They are normally reserved around strangers, unless they are brought up in an active household. Many Russian Blues have been trained to do tricks. They can also be fierce hunters, often catching rodents, birds, rabbits, small mammals, or reptiles. As loving and easy going as Russian Blues are, they do not like change, and prefer predictable, routine schedules.

Russian Blue kittens are energetic and require adequate playmates or toys as they can become mischievous if bored. They have exceptional athleticism and rival even Abyssinians for their ability to leap and climb. Slow to mature, Russian Blues retain many of their adolescent traits both good and otherwise until they are 3–4 years old and even much older Blues can be easily enticed into play by their owners. Russian Blues are also highly intelligent. They have an excellent memory and will learn the hiding place of favorite toys and lead their owners to them when they want a game. They also have a keen ability to remember favorite visitors and will race to greet familiar faces even if quite some time has passed between visits.

== Growth and maturity ==

They are small to moderate-sized cats with an average weight of when fully grown. Males will typically be larger than females. Their gestation period is approximately 64 days.

== Allergies ==

Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Russian Blue may be better tolerated by individuals with mild to moderate allergies. There is speculation that the Russian Blue produces less glycoprotein Fel d 1, one source of cat allergies. The thicker coat may also trap more of the allergens closer to the cat&#x27;s skin. Glycoprotein is one source of cat allergies, but this does not mean that all allergies will be stopped. They can still happen, but not as extreme, and for a much less amount of time than other cat breeds. Because of this, Russian Blues are very popular with people with allergies all around the world.

<doc id="144793" wikidata="Q2296529" url="?curid=144793" title="Denying the antecedent">
<text>Denying the antecedent (also known as inverse error or fallacy of the inverse) is a formal fallacy of inferring the inverse from an original statement. Phrased another way, denying the antecedent occurs in the context of an indicative conditional statement and assumes that the negation of the antecedent implies the negation of the consequent. It is a type of mixed hypothetical syllogism that takes on the following form:

:If &quot;P&quot;, then &quot;Q&quot;.
:Not &quot;P&quot;.
:Therefore, not &quot;Q&quot;.

which may also be phrased as

:formula_1 (P implies Q)
:formula_2 (therefore, not-P implies not-Q)

Arguments of this form are invalid. Informally, this means that arguments of this form do not give good reason to establish their conclusions, even if their premises are true.

The name &quot;denying the antecedent&quot; derives from the premise &quot;not &quot;P&quot;&quot;, which denies the &quot;if&quot; clause (antecedent) of the conditional premise.

The only situation where one may deny the antecedent would be if the antecedent and consequent represent the same proposition, in which case the argument is trivially valid (and it would beg the question) under the logic of &quot;modus tollens&quot;.

A related fallacy is affirming the consequent. Two related &quot;valid&quot; forms of logical arguments include &quot;modus ponens&quot; (affirming the antecedent) and &quot;modus tollens&quot; (denying the consequent).

== Examples ==
One way to demonstrate the invalidity of this argument form is with an example that has true premises but an obviously false conclusion. For example:

:If you are a ski instructor, then you have a job.
:You are not a ski instructor.
:Therefore, you have no job.

That argument is intentionally bad, but arguments of the same form can sometimes seem superficially convincing, as in the following example offered by Alan Turing in the article &quot;Computing Machinery and Intelligence&quot;:

:If each man had a definite set of rules of conduct by which he regulated his life he would be no better than a machine. But there are no such rules, so men cannot be machines.

However, men could still be machines that do not follow a definite set of rules. Thus, this argument (as Turing intends) is invalid.

Another example is:

:If I am President of the United States, then I can veto Congress.
:I am not President.
:Therefore, I cannot veto Congress.
[This is a case of the fallacy denying the antecedent as written because it matches the formal symbolic schema at beginning. The form is taken without regard to the content of the language.]

<text>Shadow of the Thin Man is a 1941 American murder mystery comedy film directed by W. S. Van Dyke and starring William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles. It was produced and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as the fourth in the series of six &quot;The Thin Man&quot; films. In this film their son Nick Jr. (Dickie Hall) is old enough to figure in the comic subplot. Other cast members include Donna Reed and Barry Nelson. This was one of three films in which Stella Adler appeared.

==Plot==
Nick and Nora Charles are looking forward to a relaxing day at a racetrack, but when a jockey accused of throwing a race is found shot to death, Police Lieutenant Abrams requests Nick&#x27;s help. The trail leads to a gambling syndicate that operates out of a wrestling arena, a murdered reporter, and a pretty secretary whose boyfriend has been framed. Along the way, Nick and Nora must contend with a wild wrestling match, a dizzying day at a merry-go-round (accompanied by Nick, Jr.), and a table-clearing restaurant brawl.

==Cast==
* William Powell as Nick Charles
* Myrna Loy as Nora Charles
* Barry Nelson as Paul Clarke
* Louise Beavers as Stella
* Donna Reed as Molly
* Sam Levene as Lieutenant Abrams
* Alan Baxter as &quot;Whitey&quot; Barrow
* Henry O&#x27;Neill as Major Jason I. Sculley
* Stella Adler as Claire Porter 
* Loring Smith as &quot;Link&quot; Stephens
* Joseph Anthony as Fred Macy
* Will Wright as Maguire - Nervous Ticket Seller (uncredited)
* Sid Melton as &quot;Fingers&quot; (uncredited)
* Adeline De Walt Reynolds as Barrow&#x27;s landlady (uncredited)
* Tor Johnson as Jack the Ripper - wrestler (uncredited)
* Frankie Burke as Jockey at the races (uncredited)
* Joe Oakie as Spider Webb (uncredited)
* Lou Lubin as Rainbow Benny
* Richard Hall as Nick Jr.

==Production==
Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, the husband and wife team who wrote the first three &quot;Thin Man&quot; scripts, refused to write another one. Goodrich said: &quot;They press you awfully hard there…when they started talking about another Thin Man, we started throwing up and crying into our typewriters. We had the nervous breakdown together, [so] we said, &quot;let&#x27;s get out of here [and] we quit&quot;.

The film was based on a story by Harry Kurnitz, not Dashiell Hammett, as the previous films had been, with the script written by Harry Kurnitz and Irving Brecher.

After difficulties with the previous films, author Dashiell Hammett was uninvolved in the production of &quot;Shadow&quot; or the two subsequent films in the series.

On 22 June 1941, MGM filmed exteriors for &quot;Shadow of the Thin Man&quot; in Berkeley, California, with Golden Gate Fields racetrack, which first opened on 1 February the same year, as &quot;Greenway Park&quot;. On the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, Nick and Nora Charles get &quot;pulled over&quot; for speeding on the upper deck of the bridge.

==Box office==
&quot;Shadow of the Thin Man&quot; was eagerly welcomed, coming two years after the previous outing and hitting theaters just two weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor. It would be three years before Loy would make another film (&quot;The Thin Man Goes Home&quot; in 1945) as she left Hollywood for New York, where she volunteered for the war effort with the Red Cross, as an assistant to the director of military and naval welfare.

According to MGM records, the film earned $1,453,000 in the US and Canada and $848,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $769,000.

==Nick and Nora Charles film series==
This film was the fourth of six based on the characters of Nick and Nora Charles:
* &quot;The Thin Man&quot; (1934)
* &quot;After the Thin Man&quot; (1936)
* &quot;Another Thin Man&quot; (1939)
* &quot;Shadow of the Thin Man&quot; (1941)
* &quot;The Thin Man Goes Home&quot; (1944)
* &quot;Song of the Thin Man&quot; (1947)

<doc id="144803" wikidata="Q1433111" url="?curid=144803" title="Tucson International Airport">
<text>Tucson International Airport is a civil-military airport owned by the City of Tucson 
 south of downtown Tucson, in Pima County, Arizona, United States. It is the second busiest airport in Arizona, after Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport since it has over 10,000 passenger boardings per year. Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 1,779,679 enplanements in 2011, a decrease from 1,844,228 in 2010.

Tucson International is operated on a long-term lease by the Tucson Airport Authority, which also operates Ryan Airfield, a general aviation airport. Public transportation to the airport is Sun Tran bus routes No. 11 and No. 25.

==History==
In 1919, Tucson opened the first municipally owned airport in the United States. In 1928 commercial flights began with Standard Airlines (later American Airlines); regular airmail service began in 1930. The 1936 airport directory shows Tucson Municipal at &quot;just north of the railroad&quot; (since removed) referring to the site that was then being used as the city&#x27;s airport southeast of the intersection of S. Park Avenue and E. 36th Street.

During World War II the airfield was used by the United States Army Air Forces Air Technical Service Command. A contract flying school was operated by the USAAF West Coast Training Center from July 25, 1942, until September 1944.

In 1948, the Tucson Airport Authority was created as a non-profit corporation to operate the airport and oversee policy decisions. The nine member board is elected by a group of up to 115 volunteer residents from Pima County, Arizona. The airport was moved to its current location south of Valencia Road and operated on the west ramp out of three hangars vacated by World War II military manufacturing companies. A new control tower was constructed in 1958 to replace the original WWII wooden framed version.

The Tucson Airport Authority was also involved in bringing the Hughes Missile Plant, now known as Air Force Plant 44 and operated by Raytheon, to Tucson. TAA sold the land to the Hughes Aircraft Co., for the construction of the plant.

In March 1956, the Civil Aeronautics Board approved routes out of Tucson for Trans World Airlines (TWA), over opposition from American Airlines, but flights did not begin until December of that year.

In April 1957, airlines scheduled 21 departures a day: 15 American, 4 TWA, and 2 Frontier. The first jet flights were American Airlines Boeing 707s and Boeing 720s around September 1960. American began flying wide-body McDonnell Douglas DC-10s from Tucson nonstop to Dallas/Ft. Worth and to Chicago via Phoenix beginning in fall 1971 and continuing through the 1970s. In 1981, Eastern Airlines was operating direct Airbus A300 wide-body service to Atlanta via an en-route stop in Phoenix. In the late 1980s American was flying Boeing 767-200s nonstop to Dallas/Ft. Worth. The DC-10, A300, and 767 were the largest airliners ever to serve Tucson on scheduled passenger flights.

On November 15, 1963, a new terminal designed by Terry Atkinson opened with an international inspection station. The Tucson International Airport name was legitimate: Aeronaves de Mexico had begun Douglas DC-6 service to Hermosillo and beyond in 1961. In the mid-1970s successor airline Aeromexico flew McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s nonstop to Hermosillo and on to Ciudad Obregon, Culiacan, Guadalajara and Mexico City. Bonanza Air Lines began DC-9 jet service to Mexico in the late 1960s with flights to Mazatlan, La Paz and Puerto Vallarta, and successor airlines Air West and Hughes Airwest flew DC-9s from Tucson to Mexico with their service being extended to Guadalajara, Mazatlan, La Paz and Puerto Vallarta.
By late 1989, three Mexican air carriers were serving the airport: Aero California with nonstop Douglas DC-9-10 jet service from Los Cabos, Aeromexico with nonstop McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jet service from both Guaymas and Hermosillo, and Aviacion del Noroeste with nonstop Fokker F27 turboprop service from Hermosillo.

The terminal underwent minor remodeling during the 1960s and 1970s, and its interior was featured in the 1974 film &quot;Death Wish&quot; starring Charles Bronson.

From the early 1970s to the early 1980s Cochise Airlines was based in Tucson. This commuter airline operated Cessna 402s, Convair 440s, de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters and Swearingen Metroliners. Cochise scheduled passenger flights to cities in Arizona and southern California.

A remodeling in 1985 doubled the size of the terminal from 150,000 to 300,000 sq ft and rebuilt the concourse into separate, two-level structures with jet bridges.

In 1987 the airport lengthened the primary runway a half-mile to the southeast for noise abatement reasons and installed arresting barriers for military planes.

A Concourse Renovation Project was finished in 2005—the last phase of a remodeling begun in 2000 that added to ticketing and baggage claim designed by HNTB. On March 19, 2008, the previous East and West concourses and gates were renumbered with the East Concourse becoming Concourse A: Gates A1–A9, and the West Concourse becoming Concourse B: Gates B1–B11.

In 2019, the Tucson Airport became the third facility in Arizona with an ATP Flight School training center.

In January 2014, the Tucson Airport Authority board approved a no-cost, 20-year property lease with the Federal Aviation Administration for a property on which to build a new federally-funded control tower to replace the 1950s vintage tower currently in use. The new tower is located on the south side of the airport, near Aero Park Blvd.

On April 6, 2016, the Tucson Airport Authority announced the Terminal Optimization Program (TOP). The program (campaign name, &quot;A Brighter TUS&quot;) includes a variety of terminal improvements, including relocation and improved capacity at the Security Screening Checkpoints, enhanced concession and revenue opportunities, upgrade of building systems, and maximizing use of space. Renovation began in June 2016 and was completed in November 2017.

Effective November 30, 2023, the airport closed runway 11R/29L permanently and began construction of a new south parallel runway and center taxiway. The project will take about 2 years to complete and open sometime in 2026. Runway 11L/29R was renumbered 12/30 and the crosswind runway 3/21 was renumbered 4/22. When completed, the new parallel runway will be designated 12R/30L and 12/30 will be designated 12L/30R.

==Military use==
Tucson International Airport hosts Morris Air National Guard Base, known as Tucson Air National Guard Base prior to November 2018, a complex on the northwest corner of the airport that is home to the 162nd Wing (162 WG), an Air Education and Training Command (AETC)-gained unit of the Arizona Air National Guard. Military use of Tucson Airport began in 1956, when the Arizona Air National Guard activated the 152d Fighter Interceptor Squadron, an Air Defense Command (ADC)-gained unit, which operated Korean War vintage F-86A Sabres. At that time the &quot;base&quot; consisted of an old adobe farmhouse and a dirt-floor hangar with enough space for three aircraft. During its history at TUS, the wing has operated the F-86 Sabre, F-100 Super Sabre, F-102 Delta Dagger, A-7 Corsair II and General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft.

Today the 162nd Wing is the largest Air National Guard fighter unit in the United States, and operates over 70 F-16C/D/E/F aircraft in three squadrons. The wing&#x27;s F-16s augment the active Air Force&#x27;s 56th Fighter Wing (56 FW) at Luke AFB, Arizona as a Formal Training Unit (FTU) for training Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command, Air National Guard and NATO and allies&#x27; F-16 pilots.

The wing also hosts the Air National Guard / Air Force Reserve Command (ANG AFRC) Command Test Center (AATC) as a tenant unit, which conducts operational testing on behalf of the Air Reserve Component. The 162 WG also hosts &quot;Snowbird&quot; operations during the winter months for Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command, and Air National Guard F-16 and Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II units from northern tier bases in the continental United States, as well as Canadian Forces and Royal Air Force flying units.

Not counting students or transient flight crews, the installation employs over 1,700 personnel, over 1,100 of whom are full-time Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) and Air Reserve Technician (ART) personnel, and the remainder traditional part-time Air National Guardsmen. Although an AETC organization, the 162nd also maintains an F-16 Alert Detachment for U.S. Northern Command / NORAD and AFNORTH at nearby Davis-Monthan AFB in support of Operation Noble Eagle.

==Facilities==

The airport covers at an elevation of . It has two asphalt runways:
* Runway 12/30: , with ILS
* Runway 4/22: 
* Runway 11R/29L: (closed permanently)

In the year ending December 31, 2022, the airport had 142,389 operations, average 390 per day: 45% general aviation, 23% airline, 13% air taxi, and 19% military. 416 aircraft were then based at the airport: 160 single-engine, 14 multi-engine, 161 jet, 73 military, and 8 helicopters.

===Terminal===
Tucson International Airport has one terminal. It contains three concourses: Concourse A has nine gates, A1 through A9, Concourse B has eleven gates, B1 through B11. Concourse C is in a separate building west of the main terminal and has one gate, C1. There are three levels inside the main terminal. The ground level is designated for baggage claim and passenger pick-up. The upper level includes airline ticketing, concessions, airline gates and TSA. The third level is designated for meetings and conference rooms and also includes the Tucson Airport Authority offices. Currently, Tucson International Airport offers daily nonstop airline service to 23 destination airports across the U.S. and Canada. Additionally, there are one-stop connections to more than 400 destinations around the world. Tucson International Airport&#x27;s terminal is similar to that of the terminal of Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, with both in the shape of a wide X.

Both concourses inside the main terminal offer food, beverage, and shopping, and free wireless internet and charging stations.

<text>Yin and yang (, ), also yinyang or yin-yang, is a concept that originated in Chinese philosophy, describing an opposite but interconnected, self-perpetuating cycle. Yin and yang can be thought of as complementary and at the same time opposing forces that interact to form a dynamic system in which the whole is greater than the assembled parts and the parts are important for cohesion of the whole.

In Chinese cosmology, the universe creates itself out of a primary chaos of material energy, organized into the cycles of yin and yang, form and matter. &#x27;Yin&#x27; is retractive, passive and contractive in nature, while &#x27;yang&#x27; is repelling, active and expansive in principle; this dichotomy in some form, is seen in all things in nature—patterns of change and difference. For example, biological and seasonal cycles, evolution of the landscape over days, weeks, years and eons (with the original meaning of the words being the north-facing shade and the south-facing brightness of a hill), gender (female and male), as well as the formation of the character of individuals and the grand arc of sociopolitical history in disorder and order.

&quot;Taiji&quot; is a Chinese cosmological term for the &quot;Supreme Ultimate&quot; state of undifferentiated absolute and infinite potential, the oneness before duality, from which yin and yang originate. It can be contrasted with the older &quot;wuji&quot; (). In the cosmology pertaining to yin and yang, the material energy which this universe was created from is known as &quot;qi&quot;. It is believed that the organization of qi in this cosmology of yin and yang has formed the 10 thousand things. Included among these forms are humans. Many natural dualities (such as light and dark, fire and water, expanding and contracting) are thought of as physical manifestations of the duality symbolized by yin and yang. This duality, as a unity of opposites, lies at the origins of many branches of classical Chinese science, technology and philosophy, as well as being a primary guideline of traditional Chinese medicine, and a central principle of different forms of Chinese martial arts and exercise, such as baguazhang, tai chi, daoyin, kung fu and qigong, as well as appearing in the pages of the &quot;I Ching&quot; and the famous Taoist medical treatise called the &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot;.

The notion of duality can be found in many areas, such as Communities of Practice. The term &quot;dualistic-monism&quot; or dialectical monism has been coined in an attempt to express this fruitful paradox of simultaneous unity and duality. According to this philosophy, everything has both yin and yang aspects (for instance, shadow cannot exist without light). Either of the two major aspects may manifest more strongly in a particular object, depending on the criterion of the observation. The yin and yang symbol (or &quot;taijitu&quot;) shows a balance between two opposites with a portion of the opposite element in each section.

In Taoist metaphysics, distinctions between good and bad, along with other dichotomous moral judgments, are perceptual, not real; so, the duality of yin and yang is an indivisible whole. In the ethics of Confucianism on the other hand, most notably in the philosophy of Dong Zhongshu ( 2nd century BC), a moral dimension is attached to the idea of yin and yang. The Ahom philosophy of duality of the individual self &quot;han&quot; and &quot;pu&quot; is quite similar to yin and yang of Taoism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:10603/116167&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition was originated in Yunnan, China and followed by some Ahom, descendants of the Dai ethnic minority.

== Linguistic aspects ==
The Chinese terms and have a rich history in the language, their etymologies and evolution analyzable through lenses of orthography, phonology, and meanings.

===Characters===

The Chinese characters and are both considered to be phono-semantic compounds, with semantic component &#x27;mound&#x27;, &#x27;hill&#x27;, a graphical variant of —with the phonetic components (and the added semantic component ) and . In the latter, features + + .

===Pronunciations and etymologies===
The Standard Chinese pronunciation of is usually the level first tone as with the meaning , or sometimes with the falling fourth tone as with the distinct meaning . is always pronounced with the rising second tone as .

Sinologists and historical linguists have reconstructed Middle Chinese pronunciations from data in the (7th century CE) &quot;Qieyun&quot; rhyme dictionary and later rhyme tables, which was subsequently used to reconstruct Old Chinese phonology from rhymes in the (11th–7th centuries BCE) &quot;Shijing&quot; and phonological components of Chinese characters. Reconstructions of Old Chinese have illuminated the etymology of modern Chinese words.

Compare these Middle Chinese and Old Chinese reconstructions of and :
* &lt; and &lt; (Bernhard Karlgren)
** and (Li Fang-Kuei)
* and (William H. Baxter)
* &lt; and &lt; (Axel Schuessler)
* &lt; and &lt; (William H. Baxter and Laurent Sagart)

Schuessler gives probable Sino-Tibetan etymologies for both Chinese words.

 &lt; compares with Burmese &#x27;overcast&#x27;, &#x27;cloudy&#x27;, Adi &#x27;shade&#x27;, and Lepcha &#x27;shade&#x27;; it is probably cognate with Chinese &lt; and &lt; .

 &lt; compares with Lepcha &quot;a-lóŋ&quot; &#x27;reflecting light&#x27;, Burmese &quot;laŋB&quot; &#x27;be bright&#x27; and &quot;ə-laŋB&quot; &#x27;light&#x27;; and is perhaps cognate with Chinese &lt; (compare areal words like Tai &quot;plaŋA1&quot; &#x27;bright&#x27; &amp; Proto-Viet-Muong &quot;hlaŋB&quot;). To this word-family, Unger also includes &lt; &#x27;bright&#x27;; however Schuessler reconstructs &#x27;s Old Chinese pronunciation as and includes it in an Austroasiatic word family, besides &lt; &lt; &#x27;twilight of dawn&#x27;; &lt; &#x27;bright&#x27;, &#x27;become light&#x27;, &#x27;enlighten&#x27;; owing to &quot;the different OC initial consonant which seems to have no recognizable OC morphological function&quot;.

===Meanings===
&quot;Yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot; are semantically complex words.

John DeFrancis&#x27;s &quot;ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary&quot; gives the following translation equivalents.
Yin or —Noun: ① [philosophy] female/passive/negative principle in nature, ② Surname; Bound morpheme: ① the moon, ② shaded orientation, ③ covert; concealed; hidden, ④ vagina, ⑤ penis, ⑥ of the netherworld, ⑦ negative, ⑧ north side of a hill, ⑨ south bank of a river, ⑩ reverse side of a stele, ⑪ in intaglio; Stative verb: ① overcast, ② sinister; treacherous
Yang or —Bound morpheme: ① [Chinese philosophy] male/active/positive principle in nature, ② the sun, ③ male genitals, ④ in relief, ⑤ open; overt, ⑥ belonging to this world, ⑦ [linguistics] masculine, ⑧ south side of a hill, ⑨ north bank of a river

The compound &quot;yinyang&quot; means &quot;yin and yang; opposites; ancient Chinese astronomy; occult arts; astrologer; geomancer; etc.&quot;

The sinologist Rolf Stein etymologically translates Chinese &quot;yin&quot; &quot;shady side (of a mountain)&quot; and &quot;yang&quot; &quot;sunny side (of a mountain)&quot; with the uncommon English geographic terms &quot;&quot; &quot;shady side of a mountain&quot; and &quot;&quot; &quot;sunny side of a mountain&quot; (which are of French origin).

===Toponymy===

Many Chinese place names or toponyms contain the word &quot;yang&quot; &quot;sunny side&quot; and a few contain &quot;yin&quot; &quot;shady side&quot;. In China, as elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere, sunlight comes predominantly from the south, and thus the south face of a mountain or the north bank of a river will receive more direct sunlight than the opposite side.

&quot;Yang&quot; refers to the &quot;south side of a hill&quot; in Hengyang , which is south of Mount Heng in Hunan province, and to the &quot;north bank of a river&quot; in Luoyang , which is located north of the Luo River in Henan.

Similarly, &quot;yin&quot; refers to &quot;north side of a hill&quot; in Huayin , which is north of Mount Hua in Shaanxi province.

In Japan, the characters are used in western Honshu to delineate the north-side San&#x27;in region from the south-side San&#x27;yō region , separated by the Chūgoku Mountains .

===Loanwords===
English &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot; are familiar loanwords of Chinese origin.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines:
yin (jɪn) Also Yin, Yn. [Chinese &quot;yīn&quot; shade, feminine; the moon.]
a. In Chinese philosophy, the feminine or negative principle (characterized by dark, wetness, cold, passivity, disintegration, etc.) of the two opposing cosmic forces into which creative energy divides and whose fusion in physical matter brings the phenomenal world into being. Also &quot;attrib&quot;. or as &quot;adj&quot;., and &quot;transf&quot;. Cf. yang.
b. &quot;Comb&quot;., as yin-yang, the combination or fusion of the two cosmic forces; freq. attrib., esp. as yin-yang symbol, a circle divided by an S-shaped line into a dark and a light segment, representing respectively &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot;, each containing a &#x27;seed&#x27; of the other. 
yang (jæŋ) Also Yang. [Chinese &quot;yáng&quot; yang, sun, positive, male genitals.]
a. In Chinese philosophy, the masculine or positive principle (characterized by light, warmth, dryness, activity, etc.) of the two opposing cosmic forces into which creative energy divides and whose fusion in physical matter brings the phenomenal world into being. Also &quot;attrib.&quot; or as &quot;adj.&quot; Cf. yin.
b. &quot;Comb.&quot;: yang-yin = &quot;yin-yang&quot; s.v. yin b.

For the earliest recorded &quot;yin and yang&quot; usages, the &quot;OED&quot; cites 1671 for &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot;, 1850 for &quot;yin-yang&quot;, and 1959 for &quot;yang-yin&quot;.

In English, &quot;yang-yin&quot; (like &quot;ying-yang&quot;) occasionally occurs as a mistake or typographical error for the Chinese loanword &quot;yin-yang&quot;—yet they are not equivalents. Chinese does have some &quot;yangyin&quot; collocations, such as (lit. &quot;foreign silver&quot;) &quot;silver coin/dollar&quot;, but not even the most comprehensive dictionaries (e.g., the &quot;Hanyu Da Cidian&quot;) enter &quot;yangyin&quot; *. While &quot;yang&quot; and &quot;yin&quot; can occur together in context, &quot;yangyin&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;yinyang&quot;. The linguistic term &quot;irreversible binomial&quot; refers to a collocation of two words A–B that cannot be idiomatically reversed as B–A, for example, English &quot;cat and mouse&quot; (not *&quot;mouse and cat&quot;) and &quot;friend or foe&quot; (not *&quot;foe or friend&quot;).

Similarly, the usual pattern among Chinese binomial compounds is for positive A and negative B, where the A word is dominant or privileged over B. For example, &quot;tiandi&quot; &quot;heaven and earth&quot; and &quot;nannü&quot; &quot;men and women&quot;. &quot;Yinyang&quot; meaning &quot;dark and light; female and male; moon and sun&quot;, is an exception. Scholars have proposed various explanations for why &quot;yinyang&quot; violates this pattern, including &quot;linguistic convenience&quot; (it is easier to say &quot;yinyang&quot; than &quot;yangyin&quot;), the idea that &quot;proto-Chinese society was matriarchal&quot;, or perhaps, since &quot;yinyang&quot; first became prominent during the late Warring States period, this term was &quot;purposely directed at challenging persistent cultural assumptions&quot;.

==History==
Joseph Needham discusses yin and yang together with Five Elements as part of the School of Naturalists. He says that it would be proper to begin with yin and yang before Five Elements because the former: &quot;lay, as it were, at a deeper level in Nature, and were the most ultimate principles of which the ancient Chinese could conceive. But it so happens that we know a good deal more about the historical origin of the Five-Element theory than about that of the yin and the yang, and it will therefore be more convenient to deal with it first.&quot;

He then discusses Zou Yan (; 305–240 BC) who is most associated with these theories. Although yin and yang are not mentioned in any of the surviving documents of Zou Yan, his school was known as the Yin Yang Jia (Yin and Yang School). Needham concludes &quot;There can be very little doubt that the philosophical use of the terms began about the beginning of the 4th century, and that the passages in older texts which mention this use are interpolations made later than that time.&quot;

==Nature==
Yin and yang are a concept that originated in ancient Chinese philosophy that describes how opposite or contrary forces may create each other by their comparison and are to be seen as actually complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world, and how they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another.

In Daoist philosophy, dark and light, yin and yang, arrive in the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; at chapter 42. It becomes sensible from an initial or emptiness (wuji, sometimes symbolized by an empty circle), and continues moving until is reached again. For instance, dropping a stone in a calm pool of water will simultaneously raise waves and lower troughs between them, and this alternation of high and low points in the water will radiate outward until the movement dissipates and the pool is calm once more.

Yin and yang thus are always opposite and equal qualities and create and control each other. Whenever one quality reaches its peak, it will naturally begin to transform into the opposite quality: for example, grain that reaches its full height in summer (fully yang) will produce seeds and die back in winter (fully yin) in an endless cycle.

It is impossible to talk about yin or yang without some reference to the opposite, traditionally it is said that Yin and Yang are known by the comparison of each other, since yin and yang are bound together as parts of a mutual whole (for example, there cannot be the bottom of the foot without the top). A way to illustrate this idea is to postulate the notion of a race with only women or only men; this race would disappear in a single generation. Yet, women and men together create new generations that allow the race they mutually create (and mutually come from) to survive. The interaction of the two (Heaven and Earth) gives birth to humans and therefore the ten thousand things.

Yin and yang transform each other: like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented by a retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall. Thus, a seed will sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the skyan intrinsically yang movement. Then, when it reaches its full potential height, it will fall. The growth of the top seeks light, while roots grow in darkness.

==Modern usage==
Yin is the black side, and yang is the white side. Other color arrangements have included the white of yang being replaced by red. The taijitu is sometimes accompanied by other shapes, such as bagua. The relationship between yin and yang is often described in terms of sunlight playing over a mountain and a valley. Yin (literally the &#x27;shady place&#x27; or &#x27;north slope&#x27;) is the dark area occluded by the mountain&#x27;s bulk, while yang (literally the &quot;sunny place&#x27; or &quot;south slope&quot;) is the brightly lit portion. As the sun moves across the sky, yin and yang gradually trade places with each other, revealing what was obscured and obscuring what was revealed.

In turn, the concepts are also applied to the human body. In traditional Chinese medicine, one&#x27;s health is directly related to the balance between yin and yang qualities within them. The technology of yin and yang is the foundation of critical and deductive reasoning for effective differential diagnosis of disease and illnesses within Taoist influenced traditional Chinese medicine.

===&quot;I Ching&quot;===

In the &quot;I Ching&quot;, originally a divination manual of the Western Zhou period (c. 1000–750 BC) based on Chinese Astronomy, yin and yang are represented by broken and solid lines: yin is broken () and yang is solid (). These are then combined into trigrams, which are more yang (&quot;e.g.&quot; ) or more yin (&quot;e.g.&quot; ) depending on the number of broken and solid lines (&quot;e.g.&quot;, is fully yang, while is fully yin), and trigrams are combined into hexagrams (&quot;e.g.&quot; and ). The relative positions and numbers of yin and yang lines within the trigrams determines the meaning of a trigram, and in hexagrams the upper trigram is considered yang with respect to the lower trigram, yin, which allows for complex depictions of interrelations.

===&quot;Taijitu&quot;===

The principle of yin and yang is represented by the &quot;Taijitu&quot; (literally &quot;Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate&quot;). The term is commonly used to mean the simple &quot;divided circle&quot; form, but may refer to any of several schematic diagrams representing these principles, such as the swastika, common to Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Similar symbols have also appeared in other cultures, such as in Celtic art and Roman shield markings.

In this symbol the two teardrops swirl to represent the conversion of yin to yang and yang to yin. This is seen when a ball is thrown into the air with a yang velocity then converts to a yin velocity to fall back to earth. The two teardrops are opposite in direction to each other to show that as one increases the other decreases. The dot of the opposite field in the tear drop shows that there is always yin within yang and always yang within yin.

=== Tai chi ===

Tai chi, a form of martial art, is often described as the principles of yin and yang applied to the human body and an animal body. Wu Jianquan, a famous Chinese martial arts teacher, described tai chi (&quot;Taijiquan&quot;) as follows:

<text>Sir Anthony George Berry (12 February 1925 – 12 October 1984) was a British Conservative politician. He served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Enfield Southgate and a whip in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government.

Berry served as an MP for twenty years and was still in office when killed in the Brighton hotel bombing of 1984 by the Provisional IRA.

==Early life==
Born in Eton, Buckinghamshire, Berry was the sixth and youngest son of the newspaper magnate Gomer Berry, 1st Viscount Kemsley, and his wife Mary Holmes. He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, graduating MA, and served as a Lieutenant in the Welsh Guards from 1943 to 1947.

==Career==
After resigning his commission in the Guards, Berry went into journalism. He was an Assistant Editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; from 1952 to 1954, when he was appointed as Editor of the &quot;Sunday Chronicle&quot;.

In 1962, Berry was appointed as High Sheriff of Glamorgan.

Standing as a Conservative, he was elected as Member of Parliament for Southgate (later Enfield Southgate) at the 1964 general election, and served in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government after the Conservatives won the 1979 general election. He was Vice-Chamberlain of the Household between 1979 and 1981, then as Comptroller of the Household from 1981 to 1983, and was appointed Treasurer of the Household in 1983. He was knighted in December 1983. At the time of his death he was Deputy Chief Whip in Thatcher&#x27;s government.

==Death==
On 12 October 1984, Berry was murdered in the Brighton hotel bombing, when a bomb was planted in the Grand Brighton Hotel during the Conservative Party Conference. He was 59. He was survived by his wife, Lady Berry, who was injured in the blast. His death occurred three days before the 20th anniversary of his first election to Parliament in 1964.

Berry&#x27;s death in office triggered a by-election in Enfield Southgate, which was won by future Cabinet minister Michael Portillo.

In September 1986, Patrick Magee, who carried out the bombing, received eight life sentences, but was released from prison in 1999 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.

Since Magee&#x27;s release, Berry&#x27;s daughter, Jo Berry, has received attention for her series of controversial meetings with the Brighton bomber, as part of her quest to come to terms with the bombing and, in her own words, &quot;to bring something positive out of it&quot;. Some of their discussions were filmed for an &quot;Everyman&quot; programme, shown on BBC Two in December 2001. She has received some criticism from other families of IRA victims for these meetings.

A ceremony was held in Berry&#x27;s Enfield Southgate constituency on 12 October 2009, the 25th anniversary of the bombing, at which his widow (wife of Lord Donoughue) and her daughter Sasha unveiled a plaque in his honour at the newly renamed Sir Anthony Berry House in Chaseville Parade, Winchmore Hill.

==Personal life==
In 1954, at Westminster, Berry married firstly Mary Cynthia Roche (1934–2023), a daughter of Maurice Roche, 4th Baron Fermoy. Mary&#x27;s sister, Frances Shand Kydd, married John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer, and so Berry was an uncle of Diana, Princess of Wales.

Berry and his wife Mary had four children: Alexandra Mary (born 1955), Antonia Ruth and Joanna Cynthia (Jo) (twins, born 1957), and Edward Anthony Morys (born 1960). They divorced in 1966.

He then married Sarah Clifford-Turner at Chelsea in 1966 and had two more children: George (born 1967), and Sasha Jane (born 1969).

Shortly before his death, Berry was being prosecuted for drink-driving and reckless driving after he allegedly drove at two police officers who were attempting to stop his vehicle, injuring one of them. He narrowly missed two pedestrians.

<text>Brandy Rayana Norwood (born February 11, 1979), better known by her mononym Brandy, is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, model and actress. Born into a musical family in McComb, Mississippi, Norwood was raised in Carson, California, beginning her career as a backing vocalist for teen groups. After signing with Atlantic Records in 1993, she released her self-titled debut album the following year, which sold six million copies worldwide. Norwood gained fame by starring in the UPN sitcom &quot;Moesha&quot;, and further recognition for her role in the television film &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1997) and the slasher film &quot;I Still Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; (1998). Her 1998 duet with fellow R&amp;B contemporary Monica, &quot;The Boy Is Mine&quot;, won a Grammy Award and became one of the best-selling female duets of all time. Her second album, &quot;Never Say Never&quot; (1998), sold 16 million copies worldwide.

Norwood saw continued critical and commercial success with her third and fourth albums, &quot;Full Moon&quot; (2002) and &quot;Afrodisiac&quot; (2004). She served as a judge on the first season of &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;. Soon after, Norwood released her fifth album, &quot;Human&quot; (2008) to modest but declined commercial success.

Norwood returned to television as a contestant on on the eleventh season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; and starred in the reality series &quot;Brandy &amp; Ray J: A Family Business&quot;. In 2012, she became a series regular in the BET series &quot;The Game&quot;, and released her sixth album &quot;Two Eleven&quot;. In 2015, Norwood made her Broadway debut as Roxie Hart in the musical &quot;Chicago&quot;, followed by her seventh and eighth studio albums, &quot;B7&quot; (2020), and the holiday album &quot;Christmas With Brandy &quot; (2023). 

Norwood has sold over 40 million records worldwide, with approximately 8.62 million albums sold in the United States alone. Through the RIAA she has a total of 10.5 million certified album units. Her accolades include a Grammy Award and an American Music Award. She has become known for her distinctive sound, characterized by her peculiar timbre, voice-layering, and intricate riffs, which has earned her the nickname &quot;the Vocal Bible&quot; from industry peers and critics.

==Early life==
Brandy Rayana Norwood was born on February 11, 1979, in McComb, Mississippi, the daughter of Willie Norwood, a gospel singer and choir director, and Sonja Norwood (née Bates), a district manager for H&amp;R Block. Norwood is the older sister of entertainer Ray J. Through her mother, she is related to guitarist and singer Bo Diddley, her third cousin. Rapper Snoop Dogg has claimed that he and Norwood are cousins, though Norwood has stated she is unsure if they are actually related. She is also reported to be a cousin of wrestler Mercedes Moné and rapper Daz Dillinger. 

Raised in a Christian household, Norwood started singing through her father&#x27;s work as part of the choir at Southside Church of Christ, performing her first gospel solo at the age of two. In 1983, her parents relocated to Carson, California, where she was schooled at Bancroft Junior High School and later attended the Hollywood High Performing Arts Center. Norwood&#x27;s interest in music and performing increased after becoming a fan of singer Whitney Houston at the age of seven, but at school, she experienced trouble with persuading teachers to send her on auditions as she found no support among the staff. 

Norwood began entering talent shows by the time she was eleven, and, as part of a youth singing group, performed at several public functions. In 1990, she signed with Teaspoon Productions, headed by Chris Stokes and Earl Harris, who gave her work as a backing vocalist for their R&amp;B boy band Immature and arranged the production of a demo tape. In 1993, amid ongoing negotiations with East West Records, Norwood&#x27;s parents organized a recording contract with the Atlantic Recording Corporation after auditioning for Darryl Williams, the company&#x27;s director of A&amp;R. To manage her daughter, Norwood&#x27;s mother resigned from her job, while Norwood herself dropped out of Hollywood High School, and was tutored privately from tenth grade onward.

==Career==

===1993–1996: &quot;Brandy&quot; and television stardom===
During the early production stages of her debut album, Norwood was selected for a role in the short-lived ABC sitcom &quot;Thea&quot;, portraying the daughter of a single mother played by comedian Thea Vidale. Initially broadcast to high ratings, the series&#x27; viewership dwindled and ended up running for only one season, but earned her a Young Artists Award nomination for Outstanding Youth Ensemble alongside her co-stars. Norwood recalled that she appreciated the cancellation of the show as she was unenthusiastic about acting at the time, and the taping caused scheduling conflicts with the recording of her album. She stated, &quot;I felt bad for everybody else but me. It was a good thing, because I could do what I had to do, because I wanted to sing.&quot;

Norwood&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released in late September 1994 and peaked at number twenty on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Critical reaction to &quot;Brandy&quot; was generally positive, with AllMusic writer Eddie Huffman declaring Brandy &quot;a lower-key Janet Jackson or a more stripped-down Mary J. Blige [...] with good songs and crisp production.&quot; Anderson Jones of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; asserted, &quot;Teen actress Norwood acts her age. A premature effort at best, that seems based on the philosophy &#x27;If Aaliyah can do it, why can&#x27;t I?&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Brandy&quot; went on to sell over six million copies worldwide, and produced three top ten hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, including &quot;I Wanna Be Down&quot; and &quot;Baby&quot;, both of which reached the top of the Hot R&amp;B Singles chart and were both certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. &quot;Brokenhearted&quot;, a duet with Wanya Morris of Boyz II Men, became a number-two hit on the charts. The album earned Norwood two Grammy Award nominations for Best New Artist and Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance the following year, and won her four Soul Train Music Awards, two Billboard Awards, and the New York Children&#x27;s Choice Award. In 1995, she finished a two-month stint as the opening act on Boyz II Men&#x27;s national tour, and contributed songs to the soundtracks of the films &quot;Batman Forever&quot; and &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot;, with the single &quot;Sittin&#x27; Up in My Room&quot; becoming another top-two success. In 1996, Norwood also collaborated with Tamia, Chaka Khan, and Gladys Knight on the single &quot;Missing You&quot;, released from the soundtrack of the F. Gary Gray film &quot;Set It Off&quot;. The single won her a third Grammy nomination in the Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals category.

In 1996, her short-lived engagement on &quot;Thea&quot; led Norwood to star in her own show, the UPN-produced sitcom &quot;Moesha&quot;. Appearing alongside William Allen Young and Sheryl Lee Ralph, she played the title role of Moesha Mitchell, a Los Angeles girl coping with a stepmother as well as the pressures and demands of becoming an adult. Originally bought by CBS, the program debuted on UPN in January 1996, and soon became their most-watched show. While the sitcom managed to increase its audience every new season and spawned a spin-off titled &quot;The Parkers&quot;, the network decided to cancel the show after six seasons on the air, leaving it ending with a cliffhanger for a scrapped seventh season. Norwood was awarded an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Youth Actor/Actress for her performance. In 1997, Brandy, Ray J, and their parents started The Norwood Kids Foundation, which helps disadvantaged, at-risk youths in Los Angeles and Mississippi through the arts and self-help programs.

===1997–2001: &quot;Never Say Never&quot; and film career===

In 1997, Norwood was hand-picked by producer Whitney Houston to play the title character in Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s television version of &quot;Cinderella&quot; featuring a multiracial cast that also included Jason Alexander, Whoopi Goldberg, and Houston. The two-hour &quot;Wonderful World of Disney&quot; special garnered an estimated 60 million viewers, giving the network its highest ratings in the time period in 16 years, and won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Art Direction for a Variety or Music Program the following year.

Fledgling producer Rodney &quot;Darkchild&quot; Jerkins was consulted to contribute to Norwood&#x27;s second album &quot;Never Say Never&quot;. Norwood co-wrote and produced six songs for the record, including her first number-one song on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;The Boy Is Mine&quot;, a duet with singer Monica that has become the most successful song by a female duo in the music industry. Exploiting the media&#x27;s presumption of a rivalry between the two young singers, the song was one of the most successful records in the United States of all time, spending a record-breaking thirteen weeks atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, and eventually garnering the pair a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. &quot;Never Say Never&quot; was released in June 1998 and became Norwood&#x27;s biggest-selling album, selling over 16 million copies worldwide and reaching number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Critics rated the album highly, with AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine praising Norwood and her team for wisely finding &quot;a middle ground between Mariah Carey and Mary J. Blige—it&#x27;s adult contemporary with a slight streetwise edge.&quot; Altogether, the album spawned seven singles, including Norwood&#x27;s second number-one song, the Diane Warren-penned &quot;Have You Ever?&quot; To promote the album she went on the Never Say Never World Tour in 1999, consisting of shows in Europe, Asia, and the United States.

After backing out of a role in F. Gary Gray&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;Set It Off&quot;, Norwood made her big screen debut in the supporting role of Karla Wilson in the slasher film, &quot;I Still Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;. The movie outperformed the original with a total of $16.5 million at its opening weekend, but critical reaction to the film was largely disappointing, with the film review site Rotten Tomatoes calculating a poor rating of 7% based on 46 reviews. Norwood, however, earned positive reviews for her &quot;bouncy&quot; performance, which garnered her both a Blockbuster Entertainment Award and an MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Breakthrough Female Performance. In 1999, she co-starred with Diana Ross in the telefilm drama &quot;Double Platinum&quot; about an intense, strained relationship between a mother and daughter. Shot in only twenty days in New York City, both Norwood and Ross served as executive producers of the movie which features original songs from their respective albums &quot;Never Say Never&quot; (1998) and &quot;Every Day Is a New Day&quot; (1999), as well as previously unreleased duets. The same year, Norwood headlined VH-1&#x27;s Divas Live &#x27;99, alongside Whitney Houston, Tina Turner, and Cher.

After a lengthy hiatus following the end of &quot;Moesha&quot;, and a number of tabloid headlines discussing her long-term battle with dehydration, Norwood returned to music in 2001, when she and brother Ray-J were asked to record a cover version of Phil Collins&#x27; 1990 hit &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot; for the tribute album &quot;Urban Renewal: A Tribute to Phil Collins&quot;. Released as the album&#x27;s first single in Europe and Oceania, the song became an instant international success overseas, scoring top-ten entries on the majority of all charts it appeared on. Norwood also contributed the Mike City track “Open” to the soundtrack from &quot;Osmosis Jones&quot;. The track remained unavailable on digital download and streaming sites until its rerelease twenty years later on October 8, 2021.

=== 2002–2005: &quot;Full Moon&quot; and &quot;Afrodisiac&quot; ===
&quot;Full Moon&quot;, Norwood&#x27;s third studio album, was released in February 2002. It was composed of R&amp;B and pop-oriented songs, many of them co-created with Jerkins, Warryn Campbell and Mike City. The album debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and topped the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Its lead single &quot;What About Us?&quot; became a worldwide top-ten hit, and the album&#x27;s title track was a Top 20 hit in the United States and the UK. Media reception was generally lukewarm, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; describing the album as &quot;frantic, faceless, fake-sexy R&amp;B.&quot; Within the coming year, Norwood and Robert &quot;Big Bert&quot; Smith began writing and producing for other artists such as Toni Braxton, Kelly Rowland, and Kiley Dean. Norwood&#x27;s foray into reality television began in 2002 with the MTV series &quot;Diary Presents Brandy: Special Delivery&quot;; the show documented the final months of Norwood&#x27;s pregnancy and the birth of her daughter Sy&#x27;rai.
Returning from yet another hiatus, Norwood&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Afrodisiac&quot; was released in June 2004, amid the well-publicized termination of her short-lived business relationship with entertainment manager Benny Medina. Norwood ended her contract with his Los Angeles-based Handprint Entertainment after less than a year of representation following controversies surrounding Medina&#x27;s handling of the lead single &quot;Talk About Our Love&quot;, and failed negotiations of a purported co-headlining tour with R&amp;B singer Usher. Despite the negative publicity, &quot;Afrodisiac&quot; became Norwood&#x27;s most critically acclaimed album, with some highlighting the &quot;more consistently mature and challenging&quot; effect of Timbaland on Norwood&#x27;s music, and others calling it &quot;listenable and emotionally resonant&quot;, comparing it to &quot;Janet Jackson at her best.&quot; A moderate seller, the album debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and received certifications in the United States, Europe and Japan. &quot;Talk About Our Love&quot; reached number six in the United Kingdom, but subsequent singles failed to score successfully on the popular music charts. Later that year, she guest-starred as Gladys Knight in the third-season premiere of &quot;American Dreams&quot;, in which she performed &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot;.

After eleven years with the company, Norwood asked for and received an unconditional release from Atlantic Records at the end of 2004, citing her wish &quot;to move on&quot; as the main reason for her decision. Completing her contract with the label, a compilation album titled &quot;The Best of Brandy&quot; was released in March 2005. Released without any promotional single, it reached the top 30 in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, where the collection was appreciated by contemporary critics who noted the creativity of Norwood&#x27;s back catalogue. Andy Kellman of AllMusic expressed, &quot;This set, unlike so many other anthologies from her contemporaries, hardly confirms dwindling creativity or popularity.&quot; Thereupon she reportedly began shopping a new record deal under the auspices of Knockout Entertainment, her brother&#x27;s vanity label.

=== 2006–2014: &quot;Human&quot;, acting return and &quot;Two Eleven&quot;===
In February 2006, Norwood began appearing in a recurring role on UPN sitcom &quot;One on One&quot;, playing the sister to brother Ray J&#x27;s character D-Mack. In June, she was cast as one of three talent judges on the first season of &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;, an amateur talent contest on NBC executive-produced by Simon Cowell and hosted by Regis Philbin. The broadcast was one of the most-watched programs of the summer, and concluded on August 17, 2006, with the win of 11-year-old singer Bianca Ryan. Norwood was originally slated to return for a second season in summer 2007, but eventually decided not to, feeling that she &quot;couldn&#x27;t give the new season the attention and commitment it deserved,&quot; following the fatal 2006 car accident in which she was involved. She was replaced by reality TV star Sharon Osbourne.

Norwood&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Human&quot;, was released in December 2008, produced by Toby Gad, Brian Kennedy, and RedOne. Distributed by Koch Records and Sony Music, the album marked Norwood&#x27;s debut on the Epic Records label, and her reunion with long-time contributor and mentor Rodney Jerkins, who wrote and executive produced most of the album. Generally well received by critics, &quot;Human&quot; debuted at number fifteen on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with opening week sales of 73,000 copies. With a domestic sales total of 214,000 copies, it failed to match the success of its predecessors. While lead-off single &quot;Right Here (Departed)&quot; scored Norwood her biggest chart success since 2002&#x27;s &quot;Full Moon&quot;, the album failed to impact elsewhere, resulting in lackluster sales in general and the end of her contract with the label, following the controversial appointment of Amanda Ghost as president of Epic Records, and Norwood&#x27;s split with rapper Jay-Z&#x27;s Roc Nation management.

In December 2009, she officially introduced her rapping alter-ego Bran&#x27;Nu with two credits on Timbaland&#x27;s album &quot;Timbaland Presents Shock Value 2&quot;, and was cast in the pilot episode for the ABC series &quot;This Little Piggy&quot;, also starring Rebecca Creskoff and Kevin Rahm, which was recast the following year.

In April 2010, Norwood and Ray J debuted in the VH1 reality series &quot;Brandy and Ray J: A Family Business&quot; along with their parents. The show chronicled the backstage lives of both siblings, while taking on larger roles in their family&#x27;s management and production company, R&amp;B Productions. Executive produced by the Norwood family, the season concluded after eleven episodes, and was renewed for a second season, which began broadcasting in fall 2010. &quot;A Family Business&quot;, a compilation album with previously unreleased content from the entire cast was released on Saguaro Road Records in June 2011. Critics such as &quot;The Washington Post&quot; declared it an &quot;awkward and adorable and really, really wholesome collection.&quot; While the album failed to chart, it produced three promotional singles, including the joint track &quot;Talk to Me&quot;.

In fall 2010, Norwood appeared as a contestant on season 11 of the ABC reality show &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, partnered with Maksim Chmerkovskiy. She ultimately placed fourth in the competition, which was a shock to the judges, viewers, studio audience, and other contestants that considered her one of the show&#x27;s frontrunners throughout the entire competition. In August 2011, it was confirmed that Norwood had signed a joint record deal with RCA Records and producer Breyon Prescott&#x27;s Chameleon Records. In September, a new talent show, &quot;Majors &amp; Minors&quot;, created by musician Evan Bogart, premiered on The Hub. It followed a group of young performers age 10–16 and their chance to be mentored by some established artists such as Norwood, Ryan Tedder and Leona Lewis. Later that same year, Norwood returned to acting roles with recurring appearances on The CW&#x27;s teen drama series &quot;90210&quot;, and in the fourth season of the Lifetime&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Drop Dead Diva&quot;, in which she played the role of Elisa Shayne.

In 2011, Norwood joined the cast of the BET comedy series &quot;The Game&quot;, playing the recurring role of Chardonnay, a bartender. She became a regular cast member by the next season. In February 2012, Norwood reteamed with Monica on &quot;It All Belongs to Me&quot;, which was released as a single from the latter&#x27;s album &quot;New Life&quot;. Norwood&#x27;s own comeback single &quot;Put It Down&quot; featuring singer Chris Brown was released later that year. The song reached number three on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, becoming her first top ten entry in ten years. Her sixth album &quot;Two Eleven&quot;, which was released in October, saw a return to her R&amp;B sound, but with what Norwood described a &quot;progressive edge&quot;. A moderate commercial success, it was viewed as a humble comeback from Norwood, reaching number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

In March 2013, Norwood returned to film, joining an ensemble cast consisting of Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Lance Gross and Vanessa L. Williams in Tyler Perry&#x27;s drama &quot;&quot;. Norwood plays supporting character Melinda, a woman with secrets. The film received generally negative reviews from critics but became a moderate US box office success. In June 2013, Norwood signed with Creative Artists Agency, headquartered in Los Angeles, and in early 2014, she arranged a management deal with MBK Entertainment with CEO Jeff Robinson. In July, she was also inducted as an honorary member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. The same month, Norwood released a cover version of Coldplay&#x27;s song &quot;Magic&quot; to her TwitMusic account; it peaked at number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Trending 140 chart. Also in 2014, Norwood made guest appearances on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Love and Hip Hop: Hollywood&quot; and the TV Land sitcom &quot;The Soul Man&quot;. At the 2014 BET Hip Hop Awards, she reunited with Queen Latifah, MC Lyte, and Yo-Yo to perform the hip hop remix of &quot;I Wanna Be Down&quot; in celebration of its 20th anniversary.

===2015–2020: Broadway and &quot;B7&quot;===
After finishing the filming of the final season of &quot;The Game&quot;, Norwood made her Broadway debut in the musical &quot;Chicago&quot;, in which she played the lead role of Roxie Hart, beginning in April 2015. Although initially a six-week run, her engagement was extended until August 2015, prompting Norwood to reprise the role on several occasions in 2016 and 2017. Also in 2015, Norwood appeared on British house duo 99 Souls&#x27;s mashup single &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;, for which she re-recorded her vocals from &quot;The Boy Is Mine&quot;. The song reached the top five in Belgium and the United Kingdom as well as the top 40 on other international charts, where it became her highest-charting single in years.

In January 2016, Norwood co-executive produced and starred as the lead in the BET sitcom &quot;Zoe Ever After&quot;, a multi-camera romantic comedy about a newly single mom stepping out of the shadow of her famous boxer ex-husband. While it debuted to respectable ratings, Norwood decided not to return to the show, and it was soon after cancelled.

==Artistry==

===Voice and style===
Norwood has been classified as some to have a contralto vocal range. Her voice has often been described as soft, raspy, and husky by music critics and Norwood herself. Music critic and &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; writer Andrew Chan describes Norwood&#x27;s vocal tone as having &quot;an unusual mix of warmth and cold, hard edges&quot;. He further describes her vocal quality, saying, &quot;Like little else in pop-music singing, Brandy&#x27;s subtle manipulation of timbre and texture rewards close listening. [...] Her main claim of technical virtuosity has always been her long, cascading riffs, a skill many R&amp;B die-hards revere her for.&quot; Norwood is also noted for her use of multitrack recording to create intricate vocal arrangements and layering. Terry Sawyer of &quot;PopMatters&quot; writes on this skill, remarking, &quot;While it&#x27;s been said that Brandy&#x27;s voice isn&#x27;t exactly a barn burner, it&#x27;s not mentioned enough that she does more than enough with what she&#x27;s got. She never leaves her voice hanging in spotlit scarcity, folding its variegated terracing, whispering out the lead track, shouting in the back-up, and piling each song with enough interlocking sounds to create the tightly packed illusion of vocal massiveness.&quot; In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Brandy at number 193 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

Norwood&#x27;s initial sound on her eponymous debut album was &quot;street-oriented&quot; R&amp;B, that incorporated elements of hip hop and pop-soul. She sang about love while also highligting other topics such as, &quot;tributes to her little brother (&quot;Best Friend&quot;), God (&quot;Give Me You&quot;), the perfect man (&quot;Baby&quot;) and older crooners like Aretha and Whitney (&quot;I Dedicate&quot;)&quot;. On her second album &quot;Never Say Never&quot;, she went for a more adult contemporary oriented direction while maintaining &quot;a slight streetwise edge&quot;. Her third studio album &quot;Full Moon&quot; saw Norwood, and her then-creative partner Rodney Jerkins, experiment with blending her previous R&amp;B sounds with futuristic, forward-thinking productions, including influences of 2-step garage and electro-funk. Along with her style, her voice had gone through an evolution, with her light, girlish voice becoming much deeper, warmer, and smokier than it had been throughout the 1990s. The lyrics also reflected the change, as the album explored more adult, sexual topics and focused on both physical and emotional aspects of an intimate relationship.

In 2004, her recent motherhood, life experiences, and growing affinity for British rock band Coldplay, caused her to shift toward a more experimental vision for her fourth studio album &quot;Afrodisiac&quot;. The album, a collaboration with producers Timbaland and Kanye West, utilized the distinctive illbient aesthetic, which fuses ambient pop, dub, and breakbeat soundscapes with progressive sampling methods. A four-year hiatus and a few life-changing occurrences caused Norwood to return to the music industry in late 2008 with &quot;Human&quot;, her fifth studio album, which discussed topics of love, heartache and honesty. Experiencing a career and personal rejuvenation in 2012, Norwood was eager to scale back her previous album&#x27;s pop style and return to R&amp;B on her sixth studio album &quot;Two Eleven&quot;. The album was a melding of both Norwood&#x27;s 1990s R&amp;B sound and the bass-heavy trends of post-2000s contemporary hip-hop.

===Influences===
Since the start of her career, Norwood has named Whitney Houston as her most prominent music and entertainment influence. Early in her career, she would often describe Houston as her &quot;idol&quot;, crediting her voice, music, and performances as critical to her, both personally and professionally. In a 2014 interview, Brandy stated that, &quot;as a professional musician, I would say that Whitney Houston is the greatest voice of all time.&quot; She elaborates, saying &quot;She was always the idea for me. I wanted to be like her, sing like her, and do everything she was doing.&quot; Beginning in the late 1990s, Houston would evolve as a personal friend and mentor to Brandy, with Houston nicknaming herself as Norwood&#x27;s &quot;godmother&quot;.
Norwood also names her father, vocal coach Willie Norwood, as instrumental to her discovery and development as a musician. She exclaims that her dad &quot;taught me everything that I know [about singing]&quot;. About her dad, Norwood states: &quot;I grew up singing in church with my dad, where he was the musical director and we sang gospel songs in a cappella almost exclusively. He bought me my first 4-track tape recorder. At first, I didn&#x27;t like my own voice, but he encouraged me to embrace the unique qualities of my voice.&quot;

While developing her own style and vocal sound, Norwood would credit gospel-jazz singer Kim Burrell, new age artist Enya, and English singer-songwriter Sade as major influences. In speaking about them, she said, &quot;...it was listening to those women, along with my own creative voice, that helped me to find my niche, my own sound.&quot;
Norwood has also noted several other musical inspirations, including Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, Boyz II Men, the Clark Sisters, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Coldplay, Janet Jackson, Timbaland, and her brother Ray J.

Over the course of her acting career, Norwood has noted Lucille Ball, Jenifer Lewis, Gabrielle Union, Niecy Nash, and Kim Fields as being integral to her development as an actress, and the discovery of her strength in comedic roles.

==Legacy and impact==

Since her 1994 debut album, Brandy has sold more than 40 million records worldwide with over 8.62 million albums sold in the United States alone. According to the RIAA, Brandy has 10.5 million certified units. In 2008, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked her song &quot;The Boy Is Mine&quot; third on a special The 40 Biggest Duets of All Time listing. 
In 1999, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Norwood among the top 20 of the Top Pop Artists of the 1990s. In 2010, &quot;Billboard&quot; included Norwood in their Top 50 R&amp;B and Hip Hop Artists list of the past 25 years. Norwood was one of the youngest artists nominated for the Grammy Award for Best New Artist. Her second album &quot;Never Say Never&quot; appeared in the &quot;Top 100 Certified Albums&quot; list by the RIAA.

Norwood&#x27;s vocal stylings have had a significant impact on the music industry, most notably with contemporary R&amp;B, pop and gospel genres, where she is often subjectively referred to as the &quot;Vocal Bible&quot;. Her work has influenced numerous artists, including Jessie J, JoJo, Bridget Kelly, Olivia, Ariana Grande, Emeli Sandé, Jordin Sparks, Ryan Destiny, Tank, Teyana Taylor, Lil&#x27; Mo, Megan Rochell, Keyshia Cole, Jhené Aiko, Raven-Symoné, Eric Bellinger, Chris Brown, Elle Varner, Rihanna, Angel, Normani, and Kehlani while Norwood&#x27;s vocals have been praised by several of her peers, including Natasha Bedingfield, Missy Elliott, Jennifer Hudson, Syleena Johnson, Gladys Knight,
Brian McKnight, Jill Scott, Angie Stone, Tamia, Ty Dolla Sign, Jazmine Sullivan, and Tamar Braxton among others. Additionally, on many occasions, Norwood has been thought of as a talented artist that music producers and songwriters have used to enhance their own artistic and creative energies.

Songwriter Sean Garrett credits the vocal work on the album &quot;Full Moon&quot; for his approach to writing, saying &quot;I take a lot from what [Brandy] and Rodney did on the &quot;Full Moon&quot; album. I was extremely impressed with it and I always try to outdo that album&quot;. B.Slade spoke of the album, commenting &quot;Full Moon&quot; single-handedly changed the vocal game. &quot;It has been the template for vocal choices and background vocal arrangements [for years].&quot; R&amp;B singer Melanie Fiona, especially admired the singer&#x27;s work on that album. Neo soul singer India.Arie often cites the album, particularly the song &quot;He Is&quot; as being the template for a wide array of singers.&quot; The oft-praised vocal work on the album sparked the idea of Norwood gaining the subjective nickname the &quot;vocal bible&quot;. Canadian R&amp;B singer Keshia Chanté credited the album for inspiring her writing for her album &quot;Night &amp; Day&quot;, while American singer Luke James referred to &quot;Full Moon&quot; as the &quot;bible&quot; of 2000s contemporary R&amp;B, calling it the &quot;blueprint of how to do vocals.&quot;

&quot;Afrodisiac &quot; has been credited as one of predecessors to the Alternative R&amp;B subgenre. In a 2014 music and fashion conversation with NPR, singer and model Solange discussed the album, saying &quot;Brandy is really the foundation of a lot of this very innovative, progressive, experimental R&amp;B. Brandy really influenced a lot of that. Frank Ocean will say it. Miguel will say it.&quot; In an interview with &quot;MalcolmMusic&quot;, Miguel revealed that he was a &quot;huge fan growing up&quot;, stating that Brandy had &quot;killed it from the first album&quot;.

American neo soul singer Erykah Badu noted that her 1997 debut album, &quot;Baduizm&quot;, was partly influenced by Norwood&#x27;s debut album, while Barbadian singer Rihanna said of her 2007 album &quot;Good Girl Gone Bad&quot;, &quot;[Brandy] really helped inspire that album. I listened to [&quot;Afrodisiac&quot;] every day [while in the studio].&quot; Kelly Rowland cited Norwood, who also wrote and produced for Rowland&#x27;s debut album, as one of the inspirations for her second studio album &quot;Ms. Kelly&quot; (2007). John Frusciante, guitarist for Red Hot Chili Peppers, cited Norwood as the &quot;main inspiration&quot; behind the guitar work on Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; 2006 album, &quot;Stadium Arcadium&quot;. When discussing the work on her debut project &quot;H.E.R.&quot;, singer H.E.R., who worked with the producer DJ Camper, revealed that Brandy was a &quot;huge inspiration&quot; to her, and that her being inspired Brandy impacted her musical output.

Norwood has made her impact in the film and television industry as well. Norwood was the first African American to play the role of Cinderella. Her role as Cinderella in the 1997 film inspired many African American actors. Speaking on the role, Keke Palmer said &quot;I feel like the reason I&#x27;m able to do this [becoming the first African American Cinderella on Broadway] is definitely because Brandy did it on TV&quot;. Norwood&#x27;s TV-show &quot;Moesha&quot; on UPN was also one of the longest-running Black sitcoms of all time. On stage, Norwood made Broadway history along with co-star Lana Gordan by becoming the first black co-leads in &quot;Chicago the Musical&quot; in 2017.

==Other ventures==

Norwood has had many endorsements in her career. In 1999, she became a CoverGirl, appearing in a number of commercials. She also represented the brands Candie&#x27;s in 1998 and DKNY in the Spring of 2000. In the late 1990s Norwood was represented by Wilhelmina Agency, one of the leading modeling agencies in the industry. In 1999, Mattel released the Brandy Doll. The doll featured Norwood in a reddish orange blouse and orange long skirt. Next to this, the Holiday Brandy Doll was released in 2000 along with another &quot;Brandy Doll&quot;. Millions of the dolls were sold and they were one of the biggest selling toys for Mattel. In 2005, Brandy became the spokesperson for Ultima, a company for hair weaves and wigs. As of 2014, she no longer represents them.

===Philanthropy===
In 1996, Norwood, along with her brother Ray J, created the Norwood Kids Foundation. Its goal of is to &quot;use performing arts as a catalyst to shape the youth of today into self-confident, disciplined, responsible, and caring individuals capable of making a positive impact in their communities.&quot; In 1999, Brandy was the first international spokesman person for youth by UNICEF. She is an avid supporter of the Make A Wish Foundation and RAINN. In 2000, Brandy donated $100,000 to 2000 WATTS, an entertainment community center founded by singer and actor Tyrese Gibson in the underprivileged community of Watts, Los Angeles, California.

In 2018, she also appeared in a PSA for the American Heart Association and Hands-Only CPR with fellow Chicago the Musical cast members.

==Personal life==
=== Relationships ===
Norwood attended Hollywood High School but studied with a private tutor beginning in tenth grade. In 1996, she had a brief relationship with future Los Angeles Lakers player Kobe Bryant, whom she accompanied to his prom at Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania. She also dated Boyz II Men lead singer Wanya Morris, whom she cited as her &quot;first love&quot;. Morris, who is over five years older, reportedly ended their relationship a month before her nineteenth birthday. Also during their work on the &quot;Never Say Never&quot; album, she briefly dated rapper Mase.

During the production of her album &quot;Full Moon&quot; in mid-2001, Norwood became romantically involved with producer Robert &quot;Big Bert&quot; Smith. The couple kept their relationship secret until February 2002, when Norwood announced that she was expecting her first child. However, a year after the birth of their daughter, Sy&#x27;rai Iman Smith, Norwood and Smith separated. In 2004, Smith revealed that the pair had never been legally wed, but that they had pretended to marry to preserve Norwood&#x27;s public image. Norwood responded that she regarded her relationship with Smith as a &quot;spiritual union and true commitment to each other,&quot; though she later confirmed Smith&#x27;s statement and justified her actions with the pressure of having to be a role model.

By the following year, Norwood had begun a relationship with NBA guard Quentin Richardson, who was then playing for the Los Angeles Clippers. The couple became engaged in July 2004, but Norwood ended their 14-month engagement in September 2005. It was reported that Norwood had to get a tattoo of Richardson&#x27;s face on her back transformed into a cat. In 2010, she briefly dated rapper Flo Rida. At the end of 2012, Norwood became engaged to music executive Ryan Press. In April 2014, Norwood called off her engagement with Press following their breakup earlier that year.

Following the release of her seventh studio album &quot;B7&quot;, fans speculated on the meaning behind the album&#x27;s closing track, &quot;Bye BiPolar&quot;. While Norwood does not have bipolar disorder, according to notes that the singer wrote to accompany the album, &quot;Bye BiPolar&quot; is a metaphor for her love life and discussing the way that her mental health struggles have been exacerbated by toxic relationships. Norwood told the &quot;New York Post&quot;: &quot;I have not been diagnosed as bipolar [...] but I&#x27;ve had moments where trauma has caused me to not be myself, and I felt at a point that I could&#x27;ve experienced moments of that.&quot; In an interview with &quot;The Grio&quot;, Norwood said, &quot;I&#x27;ve dealt with depression in the most severe ... like severe depression. I&#x27;ve dealt with trauma. I&#x27;ve dealt with PTSD. I&#x27;ve gone through a lot and I had to overcome a lot, but I had to overcome everything that I&#x27;ve overcame by doing the work,&quot; turning to therapy, prayer, journaling and meditation.

===I-405 collision===
On December 30, 2006, while driving on the 405 Freeway in Los Angeles, Norwood struck a Toyota driven by 38-year-old Awatef Aboudihaj, who later died from her injuries at the L.A. Providence Holy Cross Medical Center. Law enforcement officials later reported that Norwood was driving her car at and did not notice that vehicles ahead of her had slowed considerably. Her vehicle then collided with the rear of Aboudihaj&#x27;s, causing the Toyota to strike another vehicle before sliding sideways and impacting the center divider. As the Toyota came to a stop, it was hit by yet another vehicle. However, a source in the California Highway Patrol later reported that Aboudihaj actually struck the car in front of her and then slammed on her brakes before Norwood made contact. The sudden stop caused Norwood to hit Aboudihaj&#x27;s car. As confirmed, toxicology reports showed that Aboudihaj had &quot;slight traces&quot; of marijuana in her system at the time of the crash.

Norwood was not arrested. Nevertheless, there have been multiple lawsuits filed against Norwood, all of which were ultimately settled out of court by her attorney Ed McPherson. Aboudihaj&#x27;s parents filed a $50 million wrongful death lawsuit against Norwood. Initially set to go to trial in April 2009, the lawsuit was eventually cancelled as Norwood had settled out of court with Aboudihaj&#x27;s parents. Aboudihaj&#x27;s husband also filed a lawsuit against Norwood, suing her for an undisclosed amount of financial relief to cover medical and funeral expenses, as well as legal costs and other damages. He rejected his part of a $1.2 million settlement offer in February 2009, but did settle in November of that year. The couple&#x27;s two children received $300,000 each, while two other drivers who were involved settled with Norwood for undisclosed amounts. In May 2009, Norwood stated, &quot;The whole experience did completely change my life, and I can say that I think I&#x27;m a better person from it. You know, I still don&#x27;t understand all of it and why all of it happened, but I definitely have a heart, and my heart goes out to everyone involved. I pray about it every single day, and that&#x27;s all I can really say on the subject.&quot;

<text>Basiliscus (; died 476/477) was Eastern Roman emperor from 9 January 475 to August 476. He became in 464, under his brother-in-law, Emperor Leo I (457–474). Basiliscus commanded the army for an invasion of the Vandal Kingdom in 468, which was defeated at the Battle of Cape Bon. There were accusations at the time that Basiliscus was bribed by Aspar, the ; many historians dismiss this, instead concluding that Basiliscus was either incompetent or foolish for accepting Vandal King Gaiseric&#x27;s offer of a truce, which the latter used to construct fireships. Basiliscus&#x27;s defeat cost the Eastern Empire of gold, causing the empire to hover above bankruptcy for 30 years. When Basiliscus returned to Constantinople, he sought refuge in the Hagia Sophia. His sister, Empress Verina, secured him a pardon and he left the church to retire in Neapolis.

When Emperor Leo died in 474, his grandson Leo II (474) took power, but soon died; his father, Zeno (474–475, 476–491) ascended the throne in the same year, in a politically precarious position. Verina conspired to install the Patricius, her lover, as emperor. This plot was supported by Basiliscus, who succeeded in recruiting Isaurian brothers Illus and Trocundes, as well as Verina&#x27;s nephew Armatus. Zeno fled on 9 January 475, either after learning of the plot or after Verina warned him that his life was in danger. Although Patricius was Verina&#x27;s intended successor, Basiliscus convinced the Eastern Roman Senate to acclaim him instead.

Basiliscus quickly lost the support of his subjects and of his allies in court. Verina was alienated by the execution of Patricius, while the people objected to a combination of heavy taxes, heretical policies, and a natural disaster viewed as divine wrath for said heretical views. In an attempt to increase support, Basiliscus embraced the miaphysites, restoring Timothy Ailuros as the Patriarch of Alexandria and Peter the Fuller as Patriarch of Antioch. He heeded their advice and issued an encyclical on 9 April 475 which promoted the first three ecumenical councils of the church: Nicaea, Constantinople, and Ephesus, and condemned the Council of Chalcedon and the Tome of Leo. The Patriarch of Constantinople, Acacius, strongly opposed him, and together with Daniel the Stylite, turned the population of Constantinople against Basiliscus.

Zeno, besieged by Illus and Trocundes in his homeland of Isauria, convinced the two generals to defect, and soon the three of them marched their troops toward the capital. Basiliscus ordered Armatus to intercept them, but Armatus also switched sides after Zeno promised to give him the position of for life, and make his son Basiliscus . With Armatus&#x27; defense force deliberately kept out of his way, Zeno entered Constantinople unopposed in August 476. Basiliscus and his family hid in a church until Zeno promised not to execute them; exiled to Limnae in Cappadocia, they were either beheaded or imprisoned in a dried-up cistern and left to starve to death.

==Life==
===Early life and family===
Basiliscus was born at an unknown date, likely in the Balkans. He was the brother of future Empress Verina, the wife of East Roman Emperor Leo I ( 457–474). Historian Stefan Krautschick argues that since Basiliscus&#x27; nephew, Armatus, was the brother of a barbarian named Odoacer, Basiliscus was therefore also the uncle of Odoacer and thus a barbarian; this argument has been opposed by historians Wolfram Brandes, and Hugh Elton. Elton remarks that Krautschick&#x27;s argument relies upon a single fragmentary Greek source, making his argument acceptable, but ignores the total lack of contemporary sources mentioning his ethnicity or relationship to Odoacer. Basiliscus married Zenonis, and with her produced a son, Marcus. Zenonis&#x27; origins are unknown, but she may have been a miaphysite, as some authors credit her for pushing Basiliscus&#x27;s religious policies. Basiliscus was also related by marriage to Emperor Julius Nepos (474–475/480), as the uncle of Julius Nepos&#x27;s wife. Zenonis is alleged to have taken Armatus, Basiliscus&#x27;s nephew, as a lover. Byzantist J.B. Bury, summarizing sources from the , Candidus, and Malchus states that:
===Military career===
Leo rose to the throne of the Eastern Roman Empire in 457 after the death of Emperor Marcian (450–457). Aspar, the , selected him for this position, much as he had selected Marcian himself. Despite being half-Alanic and half-Gothic, Aspar held much influence in the empire since the mid fifth century, and wielded significant power over Marcian and Leo. Basiliscus served as a military officer under Leo, and was made consul of the East for 465, with Flavius Hermenericus as consul of the West. Basiliscus was granted the rank of in 464, and held it till 467/468; during this period he won many victories in Thrace against the Huns and Goths. He led troops in a war against a mixed group of the two in 466/467, along with Anagast, Aspar, and Ostrys. He was made a at some point, first mentioned as such in 468.

Around 466, Leo attempted to free himself of Aspar&#x27;s control. He utilized the support of the Isaurians, marrying the Isaurian chieftain Zeno (474–475, 476–491) to his daughter Ariadne, in exchange for support. This resulted in a significant change to eastern imperial policy, notably ending the policy of ignoring the requests from the West for military aid. After Anthemius (467–472), Marcian&#x27;s son-in-law, was installed by Leo as Western emperor on 12 April 467, an embassy was sent to the Vandal King Gaiseric, to inform him as well as warn him not to interfere in Italy or the Western Roman throne; Gaiseric accused them of violating a prior treaty, possibly enacted in 433, and prepared for war. Rumors may have spread in Constantinople that the Vandals were preparing an invasion of Alexandria. As a result of this, in 468 Basiliscus was given command of an expedition against the Vandals, and likely promoted to at that time. It is said that the fleet consisted of 1,113 ships, with more than 100,000 men under the command of Basiliscus, including mercenaries from as far as Öland, Sweden. According to Bury, Leo was influenced by both Verina and Aspar in his selection of Basiliscus, whom he describes as both &quot;incompetent and untrustworthy&quot;; he further states that Aspar intentionally chose a poor commander, to prevent Leo from becoming stronger by way of weakening the Vandals. Historians Gerard Friell and Stephen Williams dismiss this, but accept that Verina pushed for his appointment and that Aspar did not object. Historian Peter Heather points out that, at this point, Basiliscus had just returned from considerable success on the Balkan frontier of the empire.

Marcellinus, a West Roman commander, was sent to capture Sardinia, and then to sail to link up with the Eastern armies near Carthage, the Vandal capital. Basiliscus was to sail with the bulk of the forces directly to Carthage, and the Eastern Heraclius of Edessa, was to gather up Eastern forces in Egypt, disembark in Tripolitania, and then to approach Carthage by land; forcing the Vandals to fight in three areas. Marcellinus seized Sardinia with little trouble, and Heraclius took the fortress of Tripoli, Libya, and both headed to connect with Basiliscus&#x27; forces. Basiliscus&#x27;s galleys scattered the Vandal fleet near Sicily, something said by Procopius to have caused Gaiseric to give all up for lost, fearing a decisive blow to capture Carthage. However, Basiliscus did not press his advantage and rested his forces in Cape Bon, from Carthage. This was a strategic location as it was near the port of Utica, which, unlike Carthage, was not blocked off with a chain, and the winds would push opposing ships into the coast. According to historians Michael Kulikowski, Friell, and Williams, Gaiseric feigned interest in peace and proposed a five-day truce, in order to allow himself time to prepare. Basiliscus accepted, possibly in favor of Aspar who opposed the war, in order to achieve a compromise with the Vandals. Heather notes that the Romans strongly intended to avoid a naval engagement, and archaeologist George Bass suggests this might be the reason that Basiliscus hesitated to strike the Vandals.

Gaiseric assembled a new fleet with a number of fire ships and, aided by good winds, attacked the Roman fleet at the Battle of Cape Bon. The Roman fleet was routed by the combination of the fire ships, bad winds, and surprise, with half of it being destroyed. Basiliscus fled with the remainder of the fleet to Sicily, to consolidate with Marcellinus&#x27;s forces; their morale and supply might have brought a victory, but Marcellinus was assassinated, possibly on Ricimer&#x27;s orders. Heraclius, who had not yet reached Carthage, returned to the Eastern Roman Empire by the path he came, and Basiliscus returned to Constantinople. The total cost of the armaments for the fleet was of gold, more than the entire treasury of the Eastern Empire, causing the Eastern Empire to waver above bankruptcy for more than 30 years.

Upon his return to Constantinople, Basiliscus sought refuge in the Church of St. Sophia, before Verina interceded on his behalf to have him pardoned by Leo. He may have remained after this, but largely lived a life of retirement at Heraclea on the Propontis. Aspar was suspected of inducing Basiliscus to betray the expedition, sympathizing with the Vandals, and promising to make him emperor in place of Leo. Friell and Williams also reject this, commenting that the need to find a scapegoat is common in such disasters and that the accusation is implausible. One source, Hydatius, states that Aspar was stripped of his rank for voicing his suspicions, but historians A. H. M. Jones, John Robert Martindale, and John Morris state that this is almost certainly a confusion relating to the disgrace of Ardabur, his son, who had informed the Sassanid Empire of Roman military weakness.

Aspar regained power after the failure of the African invasion, and his son Patricius became the presumptive heir to the throne by marrying Leo&#x27;s daughter Leontia Porphyrogenita in 470. Historian L. M. Whitby suggests this may have been a ploy to lull Aspar into a sense of security. When anti-German sentiment rose up, Leo first quarreled with Aspar and then had him assassinated over suspicions of conspiracy. Basiliscus supported Leo in his power struggle against Aspar, and subsequently Theodoric Strabo, in 471/472. Aspar and Ardabur were killed in 471, and Patricius, severely wounded, was stripped of his position as and divorced from Leontia. After this, Zeno gained more power over the court. Theodoric Strabo attempted to avenge Aspar and marched against Constantinople, but was pushed back by Basiliscus and Zeno. A little later, he sent a series of demands to Leo in the capital and attacked Arcadiopolis and Philipopolis, but was forced to negotiate soon after due the lack of supplies.

===Rise to power===
When Leo fell ill in 473, he had his grandson, Leo II ( 474), the son of Zeno and Ariadne, crowned as emperor in October 473. Leo died on 18 January 474, and Leo II took the throne. Zeno was installed as co-emperor, crowned on 29 January, and when Leo II died in Autumn, Zeno became the sole eastern emperor. Zeno likely had Theoderic Strabo stripped of his role as . Zeno was very unpopular, among both the common people and the senatorial class, in part simply because he was an Isaurian, a race which had acquired a poor reputation under Emperor Arcadius ( 383–408), and also because his rule would induce a promotion of fellow Isaurians to high positions.

Although Verina had supported Zeno&#x27;s elevation as co-emperor to Leo II, she turned against him once he became sole emperor. The causes for this are disputed. The Byzantists Bury and Ernst Stein suggest this was motivated by personal hatred, and Ernest Walter Brooks, historian and scholar of the Syriac language, suggests the Isaurian background of Zeno directly caused the hatred of Verina and the people. Historians Kamilla Twardowska and W. D. Burgess argue that his ethnicity likely exacerbated existing hatred, but did not solely cause it. Twardowska also dismisses Evagrius Scholasticus&#x27; suggestions, especially that of him leading a &quot;dissolute life&quot;, stating that is common of historians wishing to paint an emperor in a bad light. Historian Mirosław Leszka attributes the action to a simple desire for power, and Twardowska theorizes that Verina supported him while Leo II was emperor because she would still retain influence as a close relative, which she would not wield over Zeno himself. Zeno had the option of raising another son from a previous marriage to the throne, or else his brother, Longinus, which would remove any remnant of Verina&#x27;s influence. Byzantine chronicler John Malalas states that Verina put forth a request which Zeno denied, causing her conspiracy, but does not specify the request; historian Maciej Salamon has argued that this request would be to have Basiliscus and her other relatives placed in high positions.

Verina conspired with others to remove him as emperor, and historians generally accept that she planned to install her lover, the Patricius, as emperor and to marry him. She was supported in this plot by Theoderic Strabo, angered by Zeno&#x27;s coronation, and Basiliscus, who succeeded in recruiting Illus and Trocundes, Isaurian brothers, as well as her nephew Armatus. The plot had the backing of the military, bolstered by Basiliscus&#x27; popularity, and that of Illus and Trocundes, and also the support of the Eastern Roman Senate. The position of the Patriarch of Constantinople, Acacius, is unclear, although Twardowska considers it likely that he would have withheld support from either side until the outcome was clear. The exact date the conspiracy began is unknown: Salamon argues it began around 473, whereas Twardowska argues it began only after Zeno took sole power. The conspiracy was successful, as Zeno fled to his native Isauria on 9 January 475, either after learning of the conspiracy or after being convinced by Verina that his life was in danger, taking with him a number of companions and funds. Many remaining Isuarians were massacred in Constantinople when news of his flight spread. Basiliscus convinced the senate to acclaim him emperor, instead of Patricius, and Basiliscus was crowned at the Hebdomon palace. He immediately had his son, Marcus, crowned as , and later co-emperor, while his wife was crowned and Patricius was executed. Zeno took residence in the fortress of Olba, and later Sbida. Illus and Trocundes were sent by Basiliscus to lay siege to Zeno&#x27;s fortress, and capturing Longinus, whom Illus would not release until 485.

==Reign==

Basiliscus quickly lost support in Constantinople, through a combination of heavy taxes and heretical ecclesiastical policies, as well as a natural disaster. A large fire broke out in the quarter of Chalkoprateia in 475/476, before quickly spreading. The fire destroyed the Basilica, a library containing 120,000 books, as well as the Palace of Lausus, the &quot;Aphrodite of Knidos&quot;, the Lindian Athene, and the Samian Here. Bury remarks that, as is common with &quot;accidents in superstitious ages&quot;, the fire was reputed to be supernatural in origin. Many at the time viewed it as a symbol of divine wrath against Basiliscus.

While Basiliscus&#x27;s rise was not illegal, as usurpations confirmed by the senate were generally considered legitimate, such had not happened for over a century in the Eastern Roman Empire. Additionally, he was politically incompetent and temperamental, alienating much of his support. While Basiliscus was supported initially by the elites of the Eastern Roman Empire, he never gained much popularity amongst the common people, weakening his legitimacy; his conflicts with Acacius reduced his support from the people of Constantinople, who were heavily Chalcedonian. The near-bankruptcy of the empire forced Basiliscus to levy extensive taxes and to sell off public positions for money. He utilized the Epinicus, a former ally of Verina, to extort money from the church. Verina turned against Basiliscus after the execution of her lover and began to plot to return Zeno to power, and sought refuge in Blachernae. It is not known if she fled because of her support or began to support Zeno after she fled, as the source, Candidus, is unclear, but the Vita Danielis Stylite states that she remained there until after Basiliscus died.

Basiliscus had Armatus made , allegedly at the insistence of Zenonis. This turned Theoderic Strabo against him, as he hated Armatus. Armatus was also made consul in 476, alongside Basiliscus himself. Illus and Trocundes, laying siege to Zeno in his native lands, defected to him. This has usually been ascribed to a failure to fulfill unspecified promises made to them, as given by Theophanes the Confessor, which many historians identify as a promise to make them both , but Leszka challenges this, arguing that Theophanes does not specify the promises because he invented them as the most likely explanation. Leszka questions that Basiliscus would entrust military command to men he had lied to, and argues that they were motivated instead by fear that Basiliscus would be overthrown, or else religious opposition. From February/March 476, Basiliscus remained in the Hebdomon, out of fear of the capital&#x27;s populace; this news may have motivated them, along with letters received from ministers of the capital. These letters informed them that the city was now ready to restore Zeno, as the people had become even less supportive of Basiliscus due to the &quot;fiscal rapacity of his ministers&quot;, as Bury puts it. Illus, possibly buoyed by his hold over Zeno, by way of his imprisonment of his brother, arranged to ally him and they began to march towards Constantinople with their combined forces.

Basiliscus ordered Armatus to take command of all the troops in Thrace and Constantinople, as well as the palace guard, and lead them against the three. In spite of his oath of loyalty, Armatus betrayed Basiliscus when Zeno offered to have him made for life, and his son, Basiliscus, crowned as . He allowed Zeno to pass to Constantinople unhindered, deliberately traveling on a different road than the one used by Zeno&#x27;s army, and marched instead into Isaura. Zeno entered Constantinople unopposed in August 476. Basiliscus and his family fled and took refuge in a church, only leaving once Zeno promised not to execute them. Zeno exiled them to Limnae in Cappadocia, where they were imprisoned in a dried-up cistern, and left to starve to death. According to some sources, they were instead beheaded.

===Religious policies===
During the 5th century, a central religious issue was the debate concerning how the human and divine nature of Jesus Christ were associated, following the Arian controversy. The School of Alexandria, including theologians such as Athanasius, asserted the equality of Christ and God, and therefore focused upon the divinity of Christ. The School of Antioch, including theologians such as Theodore of Mopsuestia, determined not to lose the human aspect of Christ, focused upon his humanity. Shortly before Marcian had become emperor, the Second Council of Ephesus was held in 449. The council stated that Jesus had one divine united nature, called ; this was rejected by the Pope and the Patriarch of Constantinople because of disputes on the matter of Christology, as the Pope and Patriarch of Constantinople saw the belief in miaphysis as heretical. Marcian convened the Council of Chalcedon in October 451, attended by about 500 bishops, most of them Eastern Roman. This council condemned the Second Council of Ephesus and agreed that Jesus had a divine nature () and a human nature, united in one person (), &quot;without confusion, change, division, or separation.&quot; The council also repeated the importance of the See of Constantinople in Canon 28, placing it firmly in second place behind the See of Rome, and giving it the right to appoint bishops in the Eastern Roman Empire, placing it over the Sees of Alexandria, Jerusalem, and Antioch.

Basiliscus rose to power during a time when the miaphysite faction was growing in power, and his attempts to ally them to himself backfired severely. Historian Jason Osequeda posits that Basiliscus&#x27;s mistake was &quot;appearing as the member of one sphere attempting to intrude into the other, rather than using influence and negotiation to achieve his platform&quot;, and that he was unaware of his outsider status, causing him to be viewed as &quot;attempting to usurp not only an earthly crown but a spiritual one too.&quot; Some historians view it likely that Zenonis influenced Basiliscus towards miaphysitism. Basiliscus had Theoctistus, a miaphysite, made , and he received the miaphysite patriarch Timothy Ailuros, who returned from his exile in Crimea after the death of Leo. By them Basiliscus was persuaded to attack the tenets of Chalcedonianism. Basiliscus had Timothy Ailuros restored as the Patriarch of Alexandria, and Peter the Fuller as Patriarch of Antioch. Under his reign the Third Council of Ephesus was held in 475, presided over by Timothy Ailuros, which officially condemned the Council of Chalcedon, and a synodical letter was sent to Basiliscus requesting that Patriarch Acacius be stripped of his role. Historian Richard Price argues that Basiliscus&#x27; association with Timothy Ailuros also reduced his support as some rumors suggested that Timothy had a role in the murder of Proterius of Alexandria, a Chalcedonian, and his ties to Timothy were seen as tacit approval of this murder.

Basiliscus issued an encyclical on 9 April 475, which promoted the first three ecumenical councils of the church: Nicaea, Constantinople, and Ephesus, and condemned the Council of Chalcedon and the Tome of Leo. While enthusiastically received in Ephesus and Egypt, it resulted in outrage from the monasteries as well as alienating Patriarch Acacius, and the heavily Chalcedonian population of the capital. Repudiating the Council of Chalcedon invalidated Canon 28 of it, ending Acacius&#x27;s control over the Eastern sees, and as such Acacius refused to sign it. Acacius draped the Church of St. Sophia in black, and lead a congregation in mourning. This caused Basiliscus to leave the city, and a significant portion of the city to support Zeno&#x27;s return. The popular (pillar monk) Daniel the Stylite, whom Basiliscus had been attempting to sway to his side, rejected his efforts after the publication of the encyclical, and descended from his pillar to pray alongside Acacius, branding Basiliscus as a &quot;second Diocletian&quot; for his attacks on the church.

There is some debate over the differences between the encyclical presented by Evagrius Scholasticus and that of Pseudo-Zacharias Rhetor. Notably, Evagrius&#x27; version does not contain some of the references to the Council of Nicaea and the Second Council of Ephesus, making it less extreme. Philippe Blaudeau suggests that the one presented by Evagrius was a modified version presented to Acacius, as it would be more palatable to him; as well as that the language of the original would have made Eutychians believe that Timothy and Basiliscus agreed with them, and the subsequent document clarified their positions. The current consensus among historians is that Evagrius&#x27; version was the original, made more extreme after the Third Council of Ephesus. Some arguments have been made by Eduard Schwartz, Hanns Brennecke, and René Draguet that Basiliscus approved Evagrius&#x27; text, but that the more extreme version was written by Paul the Sophist. Whatever the case, Basiliscus soon voided his encyclical, issuing a new letter dubbed the &quot;anti-encyclical&quot;, revoking his previous encyclical, reaffirming condemnation of heresy, and restoring the rights of Canon 28 to Acacius, but did not explicitly mention the Council of Chalcedon. Notably, the first encyclical also asserted the right for an emperor to dictate and judge theological doctrine, subsuming the function of an Ecumenical Council, and is worded much like an imperial edict. Although Acacius and Basiliscus had feuded since the first months of his reign, Daniel later played the part of a diplomat, reconciling them near the end of the latter&#x27;s reign, before Zeno retook Constantinople. All of Basiliscus&#x27; religious edicts were annulled by the Sebastianos in December 477, by order of Zeno.

==In popular culture==
Basiliscus is part of a 1669 play written by Sir William Killigrew, &quot;The Imperial Tragedy&quot;, where he appears as a ghost, during the second reign of Zeno.

<text>Jovian (; ; ; 331 – 17 February 364) was Roman emperor from June 363 to February 364. As part of the imperial bodyguard, he accompanied Julian on his campaign against the Sasanian Empire. Julian was killed in battle, and the exhausted and ill-provisioned army declared Jovian his successor. Unable to cross the Tigris, Jovian made peace with the Sasanids on humiliating terms. He spent the rest of his seven-month reign traveling back to Constantinople. After his arrival at Edessa, Jovian was petitioned by bishops over doctrinal issues concerning Christianity. Albeit the last emperor to rule the whole Empire during his entire reign, he died at Dadastana, never having reached the capital.

==Early life and accession==
Jovian was born at Singidunum, Moesia Superior (today Belgrade in Serbia), in 331, son of Varronianus, the commander of Constantius II&#x27;s imperial bodyguards (&quot;comes domesticorum&quot;). He also joined the guards and in this capacity in 361, escorted Constantius&#x27; remains to the Church of the Holy Apostles. Jovian was married to Charito and they had two sons, Varronianus, and another whose name is unknown.

Jovian accompanied the Emperor Julian on the Mesopotamian campaign of the same year against Shapur II, the Sassanid king. At the Battle of Samarra, a small but decisive engagement, Julian was mortally wounded, and died on 26 June 363. Roman soldier and historian, Ammianus, reports that while mortally wounded in his tent, Julian declined to name his preferred successor, fearful that he either might overlook a worthy candidate, or put his desired candidate in danger of power-hungry nobles. The next day, after the aged Saturninius Secundus Salutius, praetorian prefect of the Orient, had declined their offer for Emperor, the army elected, despite Julian&#x27;s reinstitution of paganism, the Christian Jovian, senior officer of the Scholae, as Emperor.

==Reign==
On the very morning of his accession, Jovian resumed the retreat begun by Julian. Though harassed by the Sasanids, the army succeeded in reaching the city of Dura on the banks of the Tigris. There the army came to a halt, hoping to cross the Tigris to reach the Empire on the western bank. When the attempt to bridge the river failed, he was forced to sue for a peace treaty on humiliating terms. In exchange for an unhindered retreat to his own territory, he agreed to a thirty-year truce, a withdrawal from the five Roman provinces, Arzamena, Moxoeona, Azbdicena, Rehimena and Corduena, and to allow the Sasanids to occupy the fortresses of Nisibis, Castra Maurorum and Singara. The Romans also surrendered their interests in the Kingdom of Armenia to the Sasanids. The king of Armenia, Arsaces II (Arshak II), was to receive no help from Rome. The treaty was widely seen as a disgrace.

After crossing the Tigris, Jovian sent an embassy to the West to announce his elevation. With the treaty signed, Jovian and his army marched to Nisibis. The populace of Nisibis, devastated by the news their city was to be given to the Sasanids, were given three days to leave.

In September 363 Jovian arrived at Edessa where he issued two edicts. The first, a limitation on the distance a soldier could be sent for straw, was to indicate an end to the war with Sasanid Persia. The second was the restoration of estates of the &quot;res privata&quot; to the Imperial finances following Julian&#x27;s incorporating them to pagan temples.

Jovian&#x27;s arrival at Antioch in October 363, was met with an enraged populace. Faced with offensive graffiti and insulting authorless bills (&quot;famosi&quot;) throughout the city, he ordered the Library of Antioch to be burned down. Jovian left Antioch in November 363, making his way back to Constantinople.
By December 363 Jovian was at Ancyra proclaiming his infant son, Varronianus, consul. While en route from there to Constantinople, Jovian was found dead in his tent at Dadastana, halfway between Ancyra and Nicaea, on 17 February 364. His death, which went uninvestigated, was possibly the result of suffocating on poisonous fumes seeping from the newly painted bedchamber walls by a brazier. Jovian died aged 33 and was buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, in a porphyry sarcophagus. He was succeeded by two brothers, Valentinian I and Valens, who subsequently divided the empire between them.

Following Jovian&#x27;s death, Valentinian and Valens removed any threats to their position. Jovian&#x27;s son Varronianus was blinded to ensure he would never inherit the throne. According to John Chrysostom, Jovian&#x27;s wife Charito lived in fear the remaining days of her life.

==Restoration of Christianity==
Jovian was met at Edessa by a group of bishops, including Athanasius, who was newly returned from exile. The Semi-Arian bishops received a poor greeting, while Athanasius delivered a letter to Jovian insisting on the Nicene Creed and the rejection of Arianism. Athanasius was restored to his episcopal duties, and allowed to accompany Jovian to Antioch.

Upon his arrival in the city, Jovian received a letter from the Synod of Antioch, imploring for Meletius&#x27; restoration as bishop. By September 363, Jovian restored the labarum (&quot;Chi-Rho&quot;) as the army&#x27;s standard and revoked the edicts of Julian against Christians, but did not close any pagan temples. He issued an edict of toleration, to the effect that his subjects could enjoy full liberty of conscience, but he banned magic and divination. Despite supporting the Nicene doctrines, he passed no edicts against Arians. Philostorgius, an Arian church historian, stated, &quot;The Emperor Jovian restored the churches to their original uses, and set them free from all the vexatious persecutions inflicted on them by the Apostate Julian.&quot;

<text>Song of the Thin Man is a 1947 American murder mystery-comedy film directed by Edward Buzzell. The sixth and final film in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Thin Man&quot; series, starring William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, characters created by Dashiell Hammett. Nick Jr. is played by Dean Stockwell. Phillip Reed, Keenan Wynn, Gloria Grahame, and Jayne Meadows are featured in this story set in the world of nightclub musicians.

==Plot==
A charity benefit sponsored by David Thayar is staged aboard the S.S. &quot;Fortune&quot;, Phil Brant&#x27;s gambling ship. The entertainment is provided by a jazz band led by Tommy Drake and featuring singer Fran Page and talented but unstable clarinetist Buddy Hollis.

After a set, Drake informs a displeased Brant that he is quitting, having gotten a much better booking through Mitchell Talbin. However, Drake has a problem: he owes gangster Al Amboy $12,000. When Amboy (who is at the party) hears the news, he demands full payment that night. Drake begs Talbin to give him an advance, but Talbin is unwilling to part with such a large sum. In desperation, Drake sneaks into Brant&#x27;s office and opens the safe, when he is shot from behind and killed.

Brant and socialite Janet Thayar elope, as her father David disapproves of Brant&#x27;s lower-class background. The next morning, they show up at Nick and Nora Charles&#x27;s apartment, having learned that Brant is the prime suspect in the murder. When a bullet narrowly misses Brant, Nick turns him in to the police, having decided it is safer for all concerned. Then Nick starts investigating.

Sneaking aboard the &quot;Fortune&quot;, Nick discovers on the back of a sheet of music a receipt signed by Amboy acknowledging that Drake&#x27;s debt had been paid. Nick then runs into Drake&#x27;s band, allowed back on board to collect their instruments. When he questions them, he learns that the bandleader had many enemies, among them Buddy Hollis. Musician Clarence &quot;Clinker&quot; Krause agrees to help Nick track Buddy down, but they have no luck.

Nick and Nora visit a hostile Janet. The bullet that killed Drake likely came from an antique gun, and Nick knows Janet&#x27;s father is an avid collector. Nick finds that one gun is missing from Mr. Thayar&#x27;s collection. Janet leaves after getting a telephone call. Nick and Nora follow her to Fran&#x27;s apartment where they find Fran&#x27;s body, recently stabbed in the back. Janet claims Fran called to sell her some information, but that she arrived after Fran was killed.

Nick finds a matchbook from a hotel in Poughkeepsie that eventually leads him to a sanitarium where Buddy is undergoing treatment. The musician is too badly shaken to answer Nick&#x27;s questions, though Nora&#x27;s presence seems to calm him down. When Nora sneaks back later by herself, Buddy becomes agitated, confesses to the murder, pulls out the antique gun, and tries to shoot Nora but misses. Nick does not believe the deranged man&#x27;s confession as Drake was slain by a well-aimed shot.

Nick gathers all the suspects by arranging a party on the reopened &quot;Fortune&quot; and announces that Buddy has fully recovered and that he will reveal the murderer&#x27;s identity that night. It is Nora who notices the crucial clue: Amboy&#x27;s wife shows up wearing a valuable necklace that matches the earrings owned by Mitchell Talbin&#x27;s wife, Phyllis. Sometime later, the necklace mysteriously reappears on Phyllis&#x27;s neck. When Nick confronts Mitchell, Phyllis reveals that it was she who paid off her lover Drake&#x27;s debt using the necklace. As Nick prompts Buddy to finger the killer, Mitchell confesses to both killings and pulls out a gun. An enraged Phyllis shoots him first, but her husband is only wounded. Despite Nick&#x27;s pleas to desist, she fires repeatedly, finishing the job.

<doc id="144817" wikidata="Q156426" url="?curid=144817" title="Alexej von Jawlensky">
<text>Alexej Georgewitsch von Jawlensky (; 13 March 1864 – 15 March 1941), surname also spelt as Yavlensky, was a Russian expressionist painter active in Germany. He was a key member of the New Munich Artist&#x27;s Association (Neue Künstlervereinigung München), Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) group and later Die Blaue Vier (The Blue Four).

==Life and work==
Alexej von Jawlensky was born in Torzhok, a town in Tver Governorate, Russia, as the fifth child of Georgi von Jawlensky and his wife Alexandra (née Medwedewa). At the age of ten he moved with his family to Moscow. After a few years of military training, he became interested in painting, visiting the Moscow World Exposition c. 1880. Thanks to his good social connections, he managed to get himself posted to St. Petersburg and, from 1889 to 1896, studied at the art academy there, while also discharging his military duties. Jawlensky gained admittance to the circle of the renowned Russian realist painter Ilya Repin. There he met Marianne von Werefkin, a wealthy artist and former student of Repin. He requested that Werefkin be his mentor, and Werefkin decided to put her work on hold to promote his work and provide him with a comfortable lifestyle.

Jawlensky and Werefkin moved to Munich in 1894, where he studied in the private school of Anton Ažbe. In 1905 Jawlensky visited Ferdinand Hodler, and two years later he began his long friendship with Jan Verkade and met Paul Sérusier. Together, Verkade and Sérusier transmitted to Jawlensky both practical and theoretical elements of the work of the Nabis, and Synthetist principles of art.

In Munich he met Wassily Kandinsky and various other Russian artists, and he contributed to the formation of the Neue Künstlervereinigung München. His work in this period was lush and richly coloured, but later moved towards abstraction and a simplified, formulaic style. Between 1908 and 1910 Jawlensky and Werefkin spent summers in the Bavarian Alps with Kandinsky and his companion, the painter Gabriele Münter. Here, through painting landscapes of their mountainous surroundings, they experimented with one another&#x27;s techniques and discussed the theoretical bases of their art. Following a trip to the Baltic coast, and renewed contact with Henri Matisse in 1911 and Emil Nolde in 1912, Jawlensky turned increasingly to the expressive use of colour and form alone in his portraits.
Expelled from Germany in 1914 due to WWI, he moved to Switzerland. He met Emmy Scheyer in 1916 (Jawlensky gave her the affectionate nickname, Galka, a Russian word for jackdaw), another artist who abandoned her own work to champion his in the United States. After a hiatus in experimentation with the human form, Jawlensky produced perhaps his best-known series, the &quot;Mystical Heads&quot; (1917–19), and the &quot;Saviour’s Faces&quot; (1918–20), which are reminiscent of the traditional Russian Orthodox icons of his childhood.

In 1921, Alexej von Jawlensky returned to Germany and took up residence in Wiesbaden. There, in 1922, he married Werefkin&#x27;s former maid Hélène Nesnakomoff, the mother of his only son, Andreas, who was born before their marriage (1902). In 1924 he established the Blue Four, whose works, thanks to Scheyer&#x27;s tireless promotion, were jointly exhibited in Germany and the US. From 1929 Jawlensky suffered from progressively crippling arthritis, which necessitated a reduced scale and finally forced a cessation in his painting in 1937. He began to dictate his memoirs in 1938. He died in Wiesbaden, Germany, on 15 March 1941. He and his wife Helene are buried in the cemetery of St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Church, Wiesbaden.

==Legacy==
In November 2003 his &quot;Schokko&quot; (&quot;Schokko mit Tellerhut&quot;) sold for US$9,296,000 and in February 2008 for GB£9,450,000 (US$18.43 million).

The 2006 album by the jazz group Acoustic Ladyland, &quot;Skinny Grin&quot;, features one of his works, &quot;Portrait of The Dancer Alexander Sacharoff&quot;, as its cover art.

The six CD&#x27;s issued by CPO with the complete string quartets by the Polish composer Mieczysław Weinberg (1919–1996), and played by the Danel Quartet, all have a female portrait by von Jawlensky on their cover. Volume 1 shows &quot;Frauenbildnis&quot; (1909). Volume 2 has &quot;Kind mit blauen Augen&quot;. Volume 3 has &quot;Weiblicher Kopf&quot; (1912). Volume 4 has &quot;Mädchen mit Haube&quot; (1910). Volume 5 has &quot;Spanierin&quot; (1911). And volume 6 shows &quot;Kopf&quot; (1912).

==Alexej of Jawlensky-Award==
In remembrance of the artist, in 1991 the &quot;Jawlensky Award&quot; has been coined. Every five years it is being awarded to contemporary artists by the capital of the federal state of Hesse Wiesbaden, the Spielbank Wiesbaden and the Nassauische Sparkasse. The award is accompanied by a cash prize, an exhibition at the Museum Wiesbaden and the purchase of a work.

==Works==
Paintings by von Jawlensky are displayed in galleries and museums around the world. The Museum Ostwall in Dortmund, Germany, maintains a collection of exceptional depth. The largest collection of works by von Jawlensky is kept at the Museum Wiesbaden, which owns more than 90 works of the artist, and forms the most important collection of his work in Europe.

<doc id="144823" wikidata="Q2140900" url="?curid=144823" title="Special linear group">
<text>In mathematics, the special linear group of degree &quot;n&quot; over a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; is the set of matrices with determinant 1, with the group operations of ordinary matrix multiplication and matrix inversion. This is the normal subgroup of the general linear group given by the kernel of the determinant

:formula_1

where &quot;R&quot;× is the multiplicative group of &quot;R&quot; (that is, &quot;R&quot; excluding 0 when &quot;R&quot; is a field).

These elements are &quot;special&quot; in that they form an algebraic subvariety of the general linear group – they satisfy a polynomial equation (since the determinant is polynomial in the entries).

When &quot;R&quot; is the finite field of order &quot;q&quot;, the notation is sometimes used.

==Geometric interpretation==
The special linear group can be characterized as the group of &quot;volume and orientation preserving&quot; linear transformations of R&quot;n&quot;; this corresponds to the interpretation of the determinant as measuring change in volume and orientation.

==Lie subgroup==

When &quot;F&quot; is R or C, is a Lie subgroup of of dimension . The Lie algebra formula_2 of SL(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;F&quot;) consists of all matrices over &quot;F&quot; with vanishing trace. The Lie bracket is given by the commutator.

==Topology==
Any invertible matrix can be uniquely represented according to the polar decomposition as the product of a unitary matrix and a hermitian matrix with positive eigenvalues. The determinant of the unitary matrix is on the unit circle while that of the hermitian matrix is real and positive and since in the case of a matrix from the special linear group the product of these two determinants must be 1, then each of them must be 1. Therefore, a special linear matrix can be written as the product of a special unitary matrix (or special orthogonal matrix in the real case) and a positive definite hermitian matrix (or symmetric matrix in the real case) having determinant 1.

Thus the topology of the group is the product of the topology of SU(&quot;n&quot;) and the topology of the group of hermitian matrices of unit determinant with positive eigenvalues. A hermitian matrix of unit determinant and having positive eigenvalues can be uniquely expressed as the exponential of a traceless hermitian matrix, and therefore the topology of this is that of -dimensional Euclidean space. Since SU(&quot;n&quot;) is simply connected, we conclude that is also simply connected, for all &quot;n&quot; greater than or equal to 2.

The topology of is the product of the topology of SO(&quot;n&quot;) and the topology of the group of symmetric matrices with positive eigenvalues and unit determinant. Since the latter matrices can be uniquely expressed as the exponential of symmetric traceless matrices, then this latter topology is that of -dimensional Euclidean space. Thus, the group has the same fundamental group as SO(&quot;n&quot;), that is, Z for and Z2 for . In particular this means that , unlike , is not simply connected, for &quot;n&quot; greater than 1.

==Relations to other subgroups of GL(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;A&quot;)==
Two related subgroups, which in some cases coincide with SL, and in other cases are accidentally conflated with SL, are the commutator subgroup of GL, and the group generated by transvections. These are both subgroups of SL (transvections have determinant 1, and det is a map to an abelian group, so [GL, GL] ≤ SL), but in general do not coincide with it.

The group generated by transvections is denoted (for elementary matrices) or . By the second Steinberg relation, for , transvections are commutators, so for , .
For , transvections need not be commutators (of matrices), as seen for example when &quot;A&quot; is F2, the field of two elements, then 
:formula_3
where Alt(3) and Sym(3) denote the alternating resp. symmetric group on 3 letters.

However, if &quot;A&quot; is a field with more than 2 elements, then , and if &quot;A&quot; is a field with more than 3 elements, . 

In some circumstances these coincide: the special linear group over a field or a Euclidean domain is generated by transvections, and the &quot;stable&quot; special linear group over a Dedekind domain is generated by transvections. For more general rings the stable difference is measured by the special Whitehead group , where SL(&quot;A&quot;) and E(&quot;A&quot;) are the stable groups of the special linear group and elementary matrices.

==Generators and relations==
If working over a ring where SL is generated by transvections (such as a field or Euclidean domain), one can give a presentation of SL using transvections with some relations. Transvections satisfy the Steinberg relations, but these are not sufficient: the resulting group is the Steinberg group, which is not the special linear group, but rather the universal central extension of the commutator subgroup of GL.

A sufficient set of relations for for is given by two of the Steinberg relations, plus a third relation .
Let (1) be the elementary matrix with 1&#x27;s on the diagonal and in the &quot;ij&quot; position, and 0&#x27;s elsewhere (and &quot;i&quot; ≠ &quot;j&quot;). Then

:formula_4

are a complete set of relations for SL(&quot;n&quot;, Z), &quot;n&quot; ≥ 3.

==SL±(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;F&quot;)==
In characteristic other than 2, the set of matrices with determinant form another subgroup of GL, with SL as an index 2 subgroup (necessarily normal); in characteristic 2 this is the same as SL. This forms a short exact sequence of groups:
:formula_5

This sequence splits by taking any matrix with determinant , for example the diagonal matrix formula_6 If formula_7 is odd, the negative identity matrix formula_8 is in but not in and thus the group splits as an internal direct product formula_9. However, if formula_10 is even, formula_8 is already in , does not split, and in general is a non-trivial group extension.

Over the real numbers, has two connected components, corresponding to and another component, which are isomorphic with identification depending on a choice of point (matrix with determinant ). In odd dimension these are naturally identified by formula_8, but in even dimension there is no one natural identification.

==Structure of GL(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;F&quot;)==
The group splits over its determinant (we use as the monomorphism from &quot;F&quot;× to , see semidirect product), and therefore can be written as a semidirect product of by &quot;F&quot;×:

:GL(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;F&quot;) = SL(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;F&quot;) ⋊ &quot;F&quot;×.

<text>The Latvian National Independence Movement (, LNNK) was a political organization in Latvia from 1988 until 1997.
It formed in 1988 as the radical wing of Latvian nationalist movement. Unlike the mainstream Latvian Popular Front, which had supported more autonomy for Latvia within the Soviet Union, LNNK insisted on independence from its beginning. The leaders of LNNK included Eduards Berklavs, Aleksandrs Kiršteins, Andrejs Krastiņš, Einars Repše and Juris Dobelis.

After Latvia regained independence, LNNK became a political party and renamed itself the National Conservative Party. It won 15 seats out of 100 in the 1993 parliamentary election and was an influential opposition party. In 1993 its candidate for Prime Minister was Joachim Siegerist, who lost by only one vote and ended up second. LNNK won the municipal election in the Latvian capital, Riga in 1994 but its popularity quickly faded after that. It lost half of its seats in the parliament in the 1995 parliamentary election and eventually merged with &quot;Tēvzemei un Brīvībai&quot; (For Fatherland and Freedom) in 1997, another right-wing party with similar origins in the Latvian independence movement.

After entering into an alliance with For Fatherland and Freedom, the party increasingly sought to propagate a particularly &#x27;Latvian&#x27; vision for Latvia as highlighted by a series of controversial adverts encouraging the consumption of Latvian goods, and warning of the dangers of non-Latvians.

An organization with similar aims and almost identical name, the Estonian National Independence Party existed in Estonia.

<text>Terrence Stephen McQueen (March 24, 1930November 7, 1980) was an American actor. His antihero persona, emphasized during the height of the counterculture of the 1960s, made him a top box-office draw for his films of the late 50s to the mid 1970s. He was nicknamed the &quot;King of Cool&quot; and used the alias Harvey Mushman in motor races.

McQueen received an Academy Award nomination for his role in &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; (1966). His other popular films include &quot;The Cincinnati Kid&quot; (1965), &quot;Nevada Smith&quot; (1966), &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; (1968), &quot;Bullitt&quot; (1968), &quot;The Getaway&quot; (1972) and &quot;Papillon&quot; (1973). In addition, he starred in the all-star ensemble films &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (1960), &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974).

In 1974, McQueen became the highest-paid movie star in the world, although he did not act in film for another four years. He was combative with directors and producers, but his popularity placed him in high demand and enabled him to command the largest salaries.

==Early life==
Terrence Stephen McQueen was born to a single mother on March 24, 1930, at St. Francis Hospital in Beech Grove, Indiana, a suburb of Indianapolis. McQueen, of Scottish descent, was raised a Roman Catholic. McQueen&#x27;s father, William McQueen, a stunt pilot for a barnstorming flying circus, left his mother, Julia Ann (or Julianne) Crawford, six months after meeting her. Several biographers have stated that Julia Ann was an alcoholic. Unable to cope with caring for a small child, she left the boy with her parents (Victor and Lillian) in Slater, Missouri, in 1933. As the Great Depression worsened, McQueen and his grandparents moved in with Lillian&#x27;s brother Claude and his family at their farm in Slater. McQueen later said that he had good memories of living on the farm, noting that his great-uncle Claude &quot;was a very good man, very strong, very fair; I learned a lot from him&quot;.

Claude gave McQueen a red tricycle on his fourth birthday, a gift that McQueen subsequently credited with sparking his early interest in car racing. McQueen&#x27;s mother married, and when the boy was eight, she brought him from the farm to live with her and her new husband in Indianapolis. His great-uncle Claude gave McQueen a special gift at his departure. &quot;The day I left the farm,&quot; he recalled, &quot;Uncle Claude gave me a personal going-away present—a gold pocket watch, with an inscription inside the case.&quot; The inscription read: &quot;To Steve – who has been a son to me.&quot;

Dyslexic and partially deaf due to a childhood ear infection, McQueen did not adjust well to school or his new life. His stepfather beat him to such an extent that at the age of nine, he left home to live on the streets. He later recalled, &quot;When a kid doesn&#x27;t have any love when he&#x27;s small, he begins to wonder if he&#x27;s good enough. My mother didn&#x27;t love me, and I didn&#x27;t have a father. I thought, &#x27;Well, I must not be very good. Soon, he was running with a street gang and committing acts of petty crime. Unable to control his behavior, his mother sent him back to his grandparents and great-uncle in Slater. 

When McQueen was 12, Julia wrote to her uncle Claude, asking that her son be returned to her again to live in Los Angeles, where she lived with her second husband. By McQueen&#x27;s own account, he and his new stepfather &quot;locked horns immediately&quot;. McQueen recalls him being &quot;a prime son of a bitch&quot; who was not averse to using his fists on McQueen and his mother. As McQueen began to rebel again, he was sent back to live with Claude for a final time. At age 14, he left Claude&#x27;s farm without saying goodbye and joined a circus for a short time. He drifted back to his mother and stepfather in Los Angeles—resuming his life as a gang member and petty criminal. McQueen was caught stealing hubcaps by the police and handed over to his stepfather, who beat him severely. He threw the youth down a flight of stairs. McQueen looked up at his stepfather and said, &quot;You lay your stinking hands on me again and I swear, I&#x27;ll kill you.&quot;

After this incident, McQueen&#x27;s stepfather persuaded his mother to sign a court order stating that McQueen was incorrigible, remanding him to the California Junior Boys Republic in Chino. There, McQueen began to change and mature. He was not popular with the other boys at first:

McQueen gradually became a role model and was elected to the Boys Council, a group who set the rules and regulations governing the boys&#x27; lives. He left the Boys Republic at age 16. When he later became famous as an actor, he regularly returned to talk to resident boys, and retained a lifelong association with the center.

At age 16, McQueen returned to live with his mother, who had moved to Greenwich Village in New York City. There he met two sailors from the Merchant Marine and decided to sign on to a ship bound for the Dominican Republic. Once there, he abandoned his new post, eventually being employed in a brothel. Later, McQueen made his way to Texas and drifted from job to job, including selling pens at a traveling carnival and working as a lumberjack in Canada. He was arrested for vagrancy in the Deep South, and served a 30-day assignment on a chain gang.

===Military service===
In 1947, after receiving permission from his mother (since he was not yet 18 years old), McQueen enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He was sent to Parris Island for boot camp. He was promoted to private first class and assigned to an armored unit. He initially struggled with conforming to the discipline of the service and was demoted to private seven times. He took an unauthorized absence, failing to return after a weekend pass expired. He was caught by the shore patrol while staying with a girlfriend (Barbara Ross) for two weeks. After resisting arrest, he was sentenced to 41 days in the brig.

After this, McQueen resolved to focus his energies on self-improvement and embraced the Marines&#x27; discipline. He saved the lives of five other Marines during an Arctic exercise, pulling them from a tank before it broke through ice into the sea. He was assigned to the honor guard responsible for guarding the presidential yacht of U.S. President Harry S. Truman.

McQueen served until 1950, when he was honorably discharged. He later said he had enjoyed his time in the Marines. He remembered his period with the Marines as a formative time in his life, saying, &quot;The Marines made a man out of me. I learned how to get along with others, and I had a platform to jump off of.&quot;

==Acting==
===1950s===

In 1952, with financial assistance under the G.I. Bill, McQueen began studying acting in New York at Sanford Meisner&#x27;s Neighborhood Playhouse and at HB Studio under Uta Hagen. He reportedly delivered his first dialogue on a theater stage in a 1952 play produced by Yiddish theatre star Molly Picon. McQueen&#x27;s character spoke one brief line: &quot;&quot;Alts iz farloyrn.&quot; (&quot;All is lost.&quot;&quot;) During this time, he also studied acting with Stella Adler, in whose class he met Gia Scala.

Long enamored of cars and motorcycles, McQueen began to earn money by competing in weekend motorcycle races at Long Island City Raceway. He purchased the first two of many motorcycles, a Harley-Davidson and a Triumph. He soon became an excellent racer, winning about $100 each weekend (). He appeared as a musical judge in an episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Jukebox Jury&quot;, which aired in the 1953–1954 season.

McQueen had minor roles in stage productions, including &quot;Peg o&#x27; My Heart&quot;, &quot;The Member of the Wedding&quot; and &quot;Two Fingers of Pride&quot;. He made his Broadway debut in 1955 in the play &quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot; starring Ben Gazzara.

In late 1955, McQueen left New York and headed for Los Angeles. He moved into a house on Vestal Avenue in the Echo Park area, and sought acting jobs in Hollywood.

When McQueen appeared in a two-part &quot;Westinghouse Studio One&quot; television presentation entitled &quot;The Defender&quot;, Hollywood manager Hilly Elkins took note of him and decided that B movies would be a good place for the young actor to make his mark. McQueen&#x27;s first film role under Elkins&#x27; management was a bit part in &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot; (1956), directed by Robert Wise and starring Paul Newman. McQueen was subsequently hired for the films &quot;The Blob&quot; (his first leading role), &quot;Never Love a Stranger,&quot; and &quot;The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery&quot; (1959).

McQueen&#x27;s first breakout role came on television. He appeared on Dale Robertson&#x27;s NBC Western series &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot; as Bill Longley. Elkins, then McQueen&#x27;s manager, successfully lobbied Vincent M. Fennelly, producer of the Western series &quot;Trackdown,&quot; to have McQueen read for the part of bounty hunter Josh Randall. He first appeared in Season 1, Episode 21, of &quot;Trackdown&quot; in 1958. He appeared as Randall in that episode, cast opposite series lead Robert Culp, a former New York motorcycle racing buddy. McQueen appeared again on &quot;Trackdown&quot; in Episode 31 of the first season, in which he played twin brothers, one of whom was an outlaw sought by Culp&#x27;s character, Hoby Gilman.

McQueen next filmed a pilot episode for what became the series, &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot;, which aired on CBS in September 1958. It became his breakout role.

In interviews associated with the DVD release of &quot;Wanted: Dead or Alive&quot;, Robert Culp of &quot;Trackdown&quot; claimed credit for bringing McQueen to Hollywood and landing him the part of Randall. He said he taught McQueen the &quot;art of the fast-draw&quot;. Culp said that by the second day of filming, McQueen beat him at it.

McQueen became a household name as a result of the series. Randall&#x27;s special holster held a sawed-off .44–40 Winchester rifle (nicknamed the &quot;Mare&#x27;s Leg&quot;) instead of the six-gun carried by the typical Western character, although the cartridges in the gunbelt were dummy .45-70, chosen because they &quot;looked tougher&quot;.

As noted in the three-part DVD special feature on the background of the series, the generally negative image of the bounty hunter added to the antihero image infused with mystery and detachment that made this show stand out from the typical TV Western. The 94 episodes that ran from 1958 until early 1961 kept McQueen steadily employed, and he became a fixture at the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, where much of the outdoor action for &quot;Wanted: Dead or Alive&quot; was shot.

At age 29, McQueen got a significant break when Frank Sinatra removed Sammy Davis Jr. from the film &quot;Never So Few&quot; after Davis supposedly made some mildly negative remarks about Sinatra in a radio interview, and Davis&#x27;s role went to McQueen. Sinatra saw something special in McQueen and ensured that the young actor got plenty of closeups in a role that earned McQueen favorable reviews. McQueen&#x27;s character, Bill Ringa, was never more comfortable than when driving at high speed—in this case in a Jeep—or handling a switchblade or a tommy gun.

===1960s===

After &quot;Never So Few&quot;, the film&#x27;s director John Sturges cast McQueen in his next movie, promising to &quot;give him the camera&quot;. &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (1960), in which he played Vin Tanner and starred with Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach, Robert Vaughn, Charles Bronson, Horst Buchholz and James Coburn, became McQueen&#x27;s first major hit and led to his withdrawal from &quot;Wanted: Dead or Alive&quot;. McQueen&#x27;s focused portrayal of the taciturn second lead catapulted his career. His added touches in many of the shots (such as twirling a shotgun around before loading it, repeatedly checking his gun while in the background of a shot, and wiping his hat rim) annoyed top-billed Brynner, who protested that McQueen was stealing scenes. (In his autobiography, Eli Wallach reports struggling to conceal his amusement while watching the filming of the funeral procession scene in which Brynner&#x27;s and McQueen&#x27;s characters first meet. Brynner was furious at McQueen&#x27;s shotgun round-twirl, which effectively diverted the viewer&#x27;s attention to McQueen. Brynner refused to draw his gun in the same scene with McQueen, knowing that his character would probably be outdrawn.)

McQueen played the top-billed lead role in the next big Sturges film, 1963&#x27;s &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, Hollywood&#x27;s fictional depiction of the true story of a historic mass escape from a World War II POW camp, Stalag Luft III. Insurance concerns prevented McQueen from performing the film&#x27;s notable motorcycle leap, which was done by his friend and fellow cycle enthusiast Bud Ekins, who resembled McQueen from a distance. When Johnny Carson later tried to congratulate McQueen for the jump during a broadcast of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, McQueen said, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t me. That was Bud Ekins.&quot; This film established McQueen&#x27;s box-office clout and secured his status as a superstar.

Also in 1963, McQueen starred in &quot;Love with the Proper Stranger&quot; with Natalie Wood. He later appeared as the titular &quot;Nevada Smith&quot;, a character from Harold Robbins&#x27; novel &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot;, portrayed by Alan Ladd two years earlier in a movie version of that novel. &quot;Nevada Smith&quot; was an enormously successful Western action adventure prequel that also featured Karl Malden and Suzanne Pleshette. After starring in 1965&#x27;s &quot;The Cincinnati Kid&quot; as a poker player, McQueen earned his only Academy Award nomination in 1966 for his role as an engine room sailor in &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot;, in which he starred opposite Richard Crenna and Candice Bergen and Richard Attenborough, with whom he had previously worked in &quot;The Great Escape&quot;.

He followed his Oscar nomination with 1968&#x27;s &quot;Bullitt&quot; – one of his best-known films, and his personal favorite – which co-starred Jacqueline Bisset, Robert Vaughn and Don Gordon. It featured an unprecedented (and endlessly imitated) car chase through San Francisco. Although McQueen did the driving that appeared in closeups, his was about 10% of what is seen in the film&#x27;s car chase. The rest of the driving by McQueen&#x27;s character was done by stunt drivers Bud Ekins and Loren Janes. McQueen&#x27;s character drove a 1968 Ford Mustang GT 390, while the antagonist&#x27;s black Dodge Charger was driven by veteran stunt driver Bill Hickman. McQueen, his stunt drivers and Hickman spent several days before the scene was shot practicing high-speed, close-quarters driving. &quot;Bullitt&quot; went so far over budget that Warner Bros. canceled the contract on the rest of his films, seven in all.

When &quot;Bullitt&quot; became a huge box-office success, Warner Bros. tried to woo him back, but he refused, and his next film was made with an independent studio and released by United Artists. For the film, McQueen went for a change of image, playing a debonair role as a wealthy executive in &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; with Faye Dunaway in 1968. The following year, he made the Southern period piece, &quot;The Reivers&quot;.

===1970s===
In 1971, McQueen starred in the auto-racing drama &quot;Le Mans&quot;, which received mixed reviews, followed by &quot;Junior Bonner&quot; in 1972, a story about an aging rodeo rider. He collaborated once again with director Sam Peckinpah in &quot;The Getaway&quot;, where he met his future wife Ali MacGraw. McQueen then took on a physically demanding role as a prisoner on Devil&#x27;s Island in the 1973 film &quot;Papillon&quot;, alongside Dustin Hoffman as his character&#x27;s tragic companion.

By the time of &quot;The Getaway&quot;, McQueen was the world&#x27;s highest-paid actor.

In 1974, with Paul Newman, McQueen co-led John Guillermin&#x27;s disaster film, &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;. McQueen played a fire chief assigned to stop a fire in a skyscraper. He was originally asked to play the architect who is the other hero of the story, but he requested to play the fire chief, thinking the part was &quot;showier&quot;. The role of the architect went to Newman, a part that had more lines, hence McQueen requested more dialogue to even it out. McQueen was paid $1,000,000 plus a percentage of the gross, and he insisted on doing his own stunts. The film was a success, and its North American gross was $55,000,000.

After this, McQueen disappeared from the public eye to focus on motorcycle racing, traveling around the country in a motor home and on his vintage Indian motorcycles. He did not return to acting until 1978 with &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot;, playing against type as a bearded, bespectacled 19th-century doctor in this adaptation of the Henrik Ibsen play. The film was never properly released theatrically, but it has appeared occasionally on PBS.

McQueen&#x27;s final two films, both released in 1980, were loosely based on true stories: &quot;Tom Horn&quot;, a Western adventure about a former Army scout turned professional gunman who works for big cattle ranchers hunting down rustlers, and later hanged for murder in the shooting death of a sheepherder; and &quot;The Hunter&quot;, an urban action movie about a modern-day bounty hunter.

===Missed roles===
McQueen was offered the lead male role in &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;, but was unable to accept due to his &quot;Wanted: Dead or Alive&quot; contract (the role went to George Peppard). He turned down parts in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot;, &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (his attorneys and agents could not agree with Paul Newman&#x27;s attorneys and agents on top billing), &quot;The Driver&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, &quot;California Split&quot;, &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;, &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;, &quot;The French Connection&quot; (he did not want to do another cop film), &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; and &quot;Sorcerer&quot;.

According to director John Frankenheimer and actor James Garner in bonus interviews for the DVD of the film &quot;Grand Prix&quot;, McQueen was Frankenheimer&#x27;s first choice for the lead role of American Formula One race car driver Pete Aron. Frankenheimer was unable to meet with McQueen to offer him the role, so he sent Edward Lewis, his business partner and the producer of &quot;Grand Prix&quot;. McQueen and Lewis instantly clashed, the meeting was a disaster, and the role went to Garner.

Later, in an interview, Garner said:

Director Steven Spielberg said McQueen was his first choice for the character of Roy Neary in &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;. According to Spielberg in a documentary on the film&#x27;s DVD release, Spielberg met him at a bar, where McQueen drank beer after beer. Before leaving, McQueen told Spielberg that he could not accept the role because he was unable to cry on cue. Spielberg offered to take the crying scene out of the story, but McQueen demurred, saying that it was the best scene in the script. The role eventually went to Richard Dreyfuss.

William Friedkin wanted to cast McQueen as the lead in the action thriller film &quot;Sorcerer&quot; (1977). &quot;Sorcerer&quot; was to be filmed primarily on location in the Dominican Republic, but McQueen did not want to be separated from Ali MacGraw for the duration of the shoot. McQueen then asked Friedkin to let MacGraw act as a producer, so she could be present during principal photography. Friedkin would not agree to this condition, and cast Roy Scheider instead of McQueen. Friedkin later remarked that not casting McQueen hurt the film&#x27;s performance at the box-office.

Spy novelist Jeremy Duns revealed that McQueen was considered for the lead role in a film adaptation of &quot;The Diamond Smugglers&quot;, written by James Bond creator Ian Fleming. McQueen would play John Blaize, a secret agent gone undercover to infiltrate a diamond-smuggling ring in South Africa. There were complications with the project, which was eventually shelved, although a 1964 screenplay does exist.

McQueen and Barbra Streisand were tentatively cast in &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; (1977), but the pair could not get along and both withdrew from the project—though according to one biographer, they had briefly dated in 1971. The lead roles were filled by Clint Eastwood and Sondra Locke.

McQueen expressed interest in the Rambo character in &quot;First Blood&quot; when David Morrell&#x27;s novel appeared in 1972, but the producers rejected him because of his age.

He was offered the title role in &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; (to star Diana Ross) when it was proposed in 1976, but the film did not reach production until years after McQueen&#x27;s death; the film eventually starred Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston in 1992.

&quot;Quigley Down Under&quot; was in development as early as 1974, with McQueen in consideration for the lead, but by the time production began in 1980, McQueen was ill. The project was scrapped until a decade later, when Tom Selleck starred.

McQueen was offered the lead in &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot;, but felt the script was flat. He was under contract to Irwin Allen after appearing in &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; and offered a part in a sequel in 1980, which he turned down. The film was scrapped and Newman was brought in by Allen to make &quot;When Time Ran Out&quot;, which was a box-office bomb. McQueen died shortly after passing on &quot;The Towering Inferno 2&quot;.

==Stunts, motor racing and flying==
McQueen was an avid motorcycle and race car enthusiast. When he had the opportunity to drive in a movie, he performed many of his own stunts, including some of the car chases in &quot;Bullitt&quot; and the motorcycle chase in &quot;The Great Escape&quot;. Although the jump over the fence in &quot;The Great Escape&quot; was done by Bud Ekins for insurance purposes, McQueen did have considerable screen time riding his 650 cc Triumph TR6 Trophy motorcycle. It was difficult to find riders as skilled as McQueen. At one point, using editing, McQueen is seen in a German uniform chasing himself on another bike. Around half of the driving in &quot;Bullitt&quot; was performed by Loren Janes.

McQueen and John Sturges planned to make &quot;Day of the Champion&quot;, a movie about Formula One racing, but McQueen was busy with the delayed &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot;. They had a contract with the German Nürburgring, and after John Frankenheimer shot scenes there for &quot;Grand Prix&quot;, the reels were turned over to Sturges. Frankenheimer was ahead in schedule, and the McQueen-Sturges project was called off.

McQueen considered being a professional race car driver. He had a one-off outing in the British Touring Car Championship in 1961, driving a BMC Mini at Brands Hatch, finishing third. In the 1970 12 Hours of Sebring race, Peter Revson and McQueen (driving with a cast on his left foot from a motorcycle accident two weeks earlier) won with a Porsche 908/02 in the three-litre class and missed winning overall by 21.1 seconds to Mario Andretti/Ignazio Giunti/Nino Vaccarella in a five-litre Ferrari 512S. This same Porsche 908 was entered by his production company Solar Productions as a camera car for &quot;Le Mans&quot; in the 1970 24 Hours of Le Mans later that year. McQueen wanted to drive a Porsche 917 with Jackie Stewart in that race, but the film backers threatened to pull their support if he did. Faced with the choice of driving for 24 hours in the race or driving for the entire summer making the film, McQueen opted for the latter.

McQueen competed in off-road motorcycle racing, frequently running a BSA Hornet and using alias Harvey Mushman. He was also set to co-drive in a Triumph 2500 PI for the British Leyland team in the 1970 London-Mexico rally, but had to turn it down due to movie commitments. His first off-road motorcycle was a Triumph 500 cc, purchased from Ekins. McQueen raced in many top off-road races on the West Coast, including the Baja 1000, the Mint 400, and the Elsinore Grand Prix.

In 1964, McQueen and Ekins were part of a four-rider (plus one reserve) first-ever official U.S. team-entry into the Silver Vase category of the International Six Days Trial (ISDT), an Enduro-type off-road motorcycling event held that year in Erfurt, East Germany. The &quot;A&quot; team arrived in England in late August to collect their mix of 649 cc and 490 cc twins from the Triumph factory before modifying them for off-road use. Initially let down with transport arrangements by a long-established English motorcycle dealer, Triumph dealer H&amp;L Motors stepped-in to provide a suitable vehicle. On arrival in Germany, the team, with their English temporary manager, were surprised to find that a Vase &quot;B&quot; team, comprising expat Americans living in Europe, had entered themselves privately to ride European-sourced machinery.

McQueen&#x27;s ISDT competition number was 278, which was based on the trials starting order. Both teams crashed repeatedly. McQueen retired due to irreparable crash damage, and Ekins withdrew with a broken leg, both on day three. Only one member of the &quot;B&quot; team finished the six-day event. UK monthly magazine &quot;Motorcycle Sport&quot; commented: &quot;Riding Triumph twins...[the team] rode everywhere with great dash, if not in admirable style, falling off frequently and obviously out for six days&#x27; of sport without too many worries about who was going to win (they knew it would not be them)&quot;.

McQueen was inducted in the Off-road Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1978. In 1971, McQueen&#x27;s Solar Productions funded the classic motorcycle documentary &quot;On Any Sunday,&quot; in which McQueen is featured, along with racing legends Mert Lawwill and Malcolm Smith. The same year, he also appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine riding a Husqvarna dirt bike.

McQueen designed a motorsports bucket seat, for which a patent was issued in 1971.

In a segment filmed for &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show,&quot; McQueen drove Sullivan around a desert area in a dune buggy at high speed. Afterward, Sullivan said, &quot;That was a &#x27;helluva&#x27; ride!&quot;

By testimony of McQueen&#x27;s son, Chad, Steve owned around 100 classic motorcycles, as well as around 100 exotic and vintage cars, including:

* Porsche 917, Porsche 908, and Ferrari 512 race cars from the &quot;Le Mans&quot; film
* Porsche 911S (used in the opening sequence of the &quot;Le Mans&quot; film)
* 1963 Ferrari 250 GT Berlinetta Lusso
* 1967 Ferrari 275GTB/4
* 1956 Jaguar XKSS (right-hand drive) (now on exhibit at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles, California)
* 1958 Porsche 356 Speedster 1600 Super (black exterior, interior and top) (McQueen drove the car in numerous SCCA racing events) (now in property of his son Chad)
* 1968 Ford GT40 (Gulf liveried) (used in the &quot;Le Mans&quot; film)
* 1953 Siata 208s (McQueen replaced the Siata badges with Ferrari badges and called it his &quot;little Ferrari&quot;)
* 1967 Mini Cooper-S (McQueen had the car customized by Lee Brown with changes including a single foglight, a wood dash, a recessed antenna and a custom brown paint job)
* 1951 Chevrolet Styline De Lux Convertible (used in &quot;The Hunter&quot;, McQueen bought the car in 1979 after filming ended)
* 1952 Chevrolet 3800 pickup camper conversion (McQueen used the truck for cross-country camping trips. It was the last car he rode in before his death)
*1950 Hudson Commodore convertible
*1952 Hudson Wasp 2-door sedan
* 1953 Hudson Hornet 4-door Sedan
* 1956 GMC Suburban
*1958 GMC Pickup Truck (Reportedly one of McQueen&#x27;s favorite cars, it is powered by a 336 Ci V8 which has been modified. The tag &quot;MQ3188&quot; is a reference to the ID number assigned to him when he was in reform school)
* 1931 Lincoln-Zephyr Sedan
* 1963 Lincoln Continental Sedan
* 1935 Chrysler Airflow Imperial Sedan
* 1969 Chevrolet Baja Hickey race truck (originally debuted at the 1968 Mexican 1000 Rally and was driven by Cliff Coleman, Johnny Diaz, and Mickey Thompson and others during its racing career; said to be the first truck specifically constructed by General Motors for use in the Mexican 1000; McQueen bought it from General Motors in 1970)

In spite of numerous attempts, McQueen was never able to purchase the Ford Mustang GT 390 he drove in &quot;Bullitt&quot;, which featured a modified drivetrain that suited McQueen&#x27;s driving style. One of the two Mustangs used in the film was badly damaged, judged beyond repair, and believed to have been scrapped until it surfaced in Mexico in 2017, while the other one, which McQueen attempted to purchase in 1977, is hidden from the public eye. At the 2018 North American International Auto Show the GT 390 was displayed, in its current non-restored condition, with the 2019 Ford Mustang &quot;Bullitt&quot;.

McQueen also flew and owned, among other aircraft, a 1945 Stearman, tail number N3188, (his student number in reform school), a 1946 Piper J-3 Cub, and an award-winning 1931 Pitcairn PA-8 biplane, flown in the U.S. Mail Service by famed World War I flying ace Eddie Rickenbacker. They were hangared at Santa Paula Airport an hour northwest of Hollywood, where he lived his final days.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and friendships===

While still attending Stella Adler&#x27;s school in New York, McQueen dated Gia Scala.

On November 2, 1956, he married Filipino actress and dancer Neile Adams, with whom he had a daughter, Terry Leslie (June 5, 1959 – March 19, 1998), and a son, Chad (December 28, 1960 – September 11, 2024). McQueen and Adams divorced on March 14, 1972. In her autobiography, &quot;My Husband, My Friend&quot;, Adams stated that she got an abortion in 1971 when their marriage was on the rocks. 

One of McQueen&#x27;s four grandchildren is actor Steven R. McQueen (via son Chad), best known for playing Jeremy Gilbert in &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; and Jimmy Borelli in &quot;Chicago Fire&quot;. Molly McQueen, an actress and producer known for the web series &quot;Reasons I Don’t Have a Boyfriend&quot;, is his granddaughter via daughter Terry.

Mamie Van Doren claimed to have had an affair with McQueen and tried hallucinogens with him around 1959. Actress-model Lauren Hutton said that she also had an affair with McQueen around 1964. In 1971–1972, while separated from Adams, McQueen had a relationship with &quot;Junior Bonner&quot; co-star Barbara Leigh, ending in pregnancy and abortion.

In Cheyenne, Wyoming on July 12, 1973, McQueen married actress Ali MacGraw (his co-star in &quot;The Getaway&quot;), but their marriage ended in a divorce on August 9, 1978. MacGraw suffered a miscarriage during their marriage. McQueen&#x27;s closest friend in his last years, martial-arts master Pat Johnson, claimed that MacGraw was the one true love of McQueen&#x27;s life: &quot;He was madly in love with her until the day he died.&quot;

In 1973, McQueen was one of the pallbearers at Bruce Lee&#x27;s funeral, along with James Coburn, Bruce&#x27;s brother Robert Lee, Peter Chin, Dan Inosanto and Taky Kimura.

After discovering a mutual interest in racing, McQueen and &quot;The Great Escape&quot; co-star James Garner became good friends and lived near each other. McQueen recalled:

On January 16, 1980, less than 10 months before his death, McQueen married fashion model Barbara Minty. Barbara Minty, in her book &quot;Steve McQueen: The Last Mile&quot;, wrote of McQueen becoming an Evangelical Christian toward the end of his life. This was due in part to the influences of his flying instructor, Sammy Mason, Mason&#x27;s son Pete, and Barbara herself. McQueen attended his local church, Ventura Missionary Church, and was visited by evangelist Billy Graham shortly before his death.

===Lifestyle===

McQueen followed a daily two-hour exercise regimen involving weightlifting and, at one point, running , seven days a week. McQueen learned the martial art Tang Soo Do from ninth-degree black belt Pat E. Johnson.

According to photographer William Claxton, McQueen smoked marijuana almost every day. Biographer Marc Eliot stated that McQueen used a large amount of cocaine in the early 1970s. He was also a heavy cigarette smoker. McQueen sometimes drank to excess; he was arrested for driving while intoxicated in Anchorage, Alaska, in 1972.

===Manson connection===
Two months after Charles Manson incited the Tate murders, including McQueen&#x27;s friends Sharon Tate and Jay Sebring, the media reported police had found a hit list with McQueen&#x27;s name on it. According to his first wife, McQueen began carrying a handgun at all times in public, including at Sebring&#x27;s funeral.

===Charitable causes===
McQueen had an unusual reputation for demanding free items in bulk from studios when agreeing to do a film, such as electric razors, jeans and other items. It was later discovered McQueen donated these things to the Boys Republic reformatory school, where he had spent time during his teen years.

=== Political views ===
McQueen supported Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election despite being registered as a Republican. He supported Richard Nixon in the 1968 United States presidential election.

==Illness and death==
McQueen developed a persistent cough in early 1978. He gave up cigarettes and underwent antibiotic treatments without improvement. His shortness of breath grew more pronounced and on December 22, 1979, after filming &quot;The Hunter&quot;, a biopsy revealed pleural mesothelioma, a cancer associated with asbestos exposure for which there is no known cure.

A few months later, McQueen gave a medical interview in which he blamed his condition on asbestos exposure. McQueen believed that asbestos used in movie sound stage insulation and race-drivers&#x27; protective suits and helmets could have been involved, but he thought it more likely that his illness was a direct result of massive exposure while removing asbestos lagging (insulation) from pipes aboard a troop ship while he served in the Marines.

By February 1980, evidence of widespread metastasis was found. He tried to keep the condition a secret, but on March 11, 1980, the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; disclosed that he had &quot;terminal cancer&quot;. In July 1980, McQueen traveled to Rosarito Beach, Mexico, for unconventional treatment after U.S. doctors told him they could do nothing to prolong his life. Controversy arose over the trip because McQueen sought treatment from William Donald Kelley, who was promoting a variation of the Gerson therapy that used coffee enemas, frequent washing with shampoos, daily injections of fluid containing live cells from cattle and sheep, massages, and laetrile, a reputed anti-cancer drug available in Mexico but long known to be both toxic and ineffective in treating cancer. McQueen paid for Kelley&#x27;s treatments himself in cash, which were said to have been upwards of $40,000 per month () during his three-month stay in Mexico. Kelley&#x27;s only medically related license (until being revoked in 1976) had been for orthodontics, a field of dentistry. Kelley&#x27;s methods caused a sensation in the traditional and tabloid press when it became known that McQueen was a patient.

McQueen returned to the U.S. in early October. Despite metastasis of the cancer throughout his body, Kelley publicly announced that McQueen would be completely cured and could return to normal life. However, his condition soon worsened, and huge tumors developed in his abdomen.

In late October 1980, McQueen flew to Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico, to have an abdominal tumor on his liver (weighing around 5 lbs/2.3 kg) removed, despite warnings from his U.S. doctors that the tumor was inoperable and his heart could not withstand the surgery. Using the name &quot;Samuel Sheppard&quot;, McQueen checked into a small Juárez clinic where the doctors and staff were unaware of his actual identity. On November 7, 1980, McQueen died of a heart attack at 3:45 a.m. at a Juárez hospital, 12 hours after surgery to remove or reduce numerous metastatic tumors in his neck and abdomen. He was 50 years old. According to the &quot;El Paso Times&quot;, McQueen died in his sleep.

Leonard DeWitt of the Ventura Missionary Church presided over McQueen&#x27;s memorial service. McQueen was cremated, and his ashes were spread in the Pacific Ocean.

==Legacy==

In 2007, 27 years after his death, &quot;Forbes&quot; said McQueen remained a popular star, was still the &quot;King of Cool&quot;, and was one of the highest-earning dead celebrities. A rights-management agency head credited Branded Entertainment Network (called Corbis at the time) with maximizing the profitability of his estate by limiting the licensing of McQueen&#x27;s image, thereby avoiding the commercial saturation of other dead celebrities&#x27; estates. As of 2007, McQueen&#x27;s estate entered the top 10 of highest-earning dead celebrities.

McQueen was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers in April 2007, in a ceremony at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

In November 1999, McQueen was inducted into the Motorcycle Hall of Fame. He was credited with contributions including financing the film &quot;On Any Sunday&quot;, supporting a team of off-road riders, and enhancing the public image of motorcycling overall.

The Beech Grove, Indiana, Public Library formally dedicated the Steve McQueen Birthplace Collection on March 16, 2010, to commemorate the 80th anniversary of McQueen&#x27;s birth on March 24, 1930.

There is a street named after McQueen in San Antonio, Texas.

In 2012, McQueen was posthumously honored with the Warren Zevon Tribute Award by the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization (ADAO).

&quot;Steve McQueen: The Man &amp; Le Mans&quot;, a 2015 documentary, examines the actor&#x27;s quest to create and star in the 1971 auto-racing film &quot;Le Mans&quot;. His son Chad McQueen and former wife Neile Adams are among those interviewed.

On September 28, 2017, there was a selected showing in some theaters of his life story and spiritual quest, &quot;Steve McQueen – American Icon&quot;. There was an encore presentation on October 10, 2017. The film received mostly positive reviews. Kenneth R. Morefield of &quot;Christianity Today&quot; said it &quot;offers a timeless reminder that even those among us living the most celebrated lives often long for the peace and sense of purpose that only God can provide&quot;. Michael Foust of &quot;Wordslingers&quot; called it &quot;one of the most powerful and inspiring documentaries I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;.

In the 2019 Quentin Tarantino film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;, McQueen is portrayed by Damian Lewis. McQueen also appears as a character in Tarantino&#x27;s novel of the same name.

===Archive===
The Academy Film Archive houses the Steve McQueen-Neile Adams Collection, which consists of personal prints and home movies. The archive has preserved several of McQueen&#x27;s home movies.

===Ford commercials===
In 1998, director Paul Street created a commercial for the Ford Puma. Footage was shot in modern-day San Francisco, set to the theme music from &quot;Bullitt&quot;. Archive footage of McQueen was used to digitally superimpose him driving and exiting the car in settings reminiscent of the film. The Puma shares the same number plate of the classic fastback Mustang used in &quot;Bullitt&quot;, and as he parks in the garage (next to the Mustang), he pauses and looks meaningfully at a motorcycle tucked in the corner, similar to that used in &quot;The Great Escape&quot;.

In 2005, Ford used his likeness again, in a commercial for the 2005 Mustang. In the commercial, a farmer builds a winding racetrack, which he circles in the 2005 Mustang. Out of the cornfield comes McQueen. The farmer tosses his keys to McQueen, who drives off in the new Mustang. McQueen&#x27;s likeness was created using a body double (Dan Holsten) and digital editing. Ford secured the rights to McQueen&#x27;s likeness from the actor&#x27;s estate licensing agent for an undisclosed sum.

At the Detroit Auto Show in January 2018, Ford unveiled the new 2019 Mustang Bullitt. The company called on McQueen&#x27;s granddaughter, actress Molly McQueen, to make the announcement. After a brief rundown of the tribute car&#x27;s particulars, a short film was shown in which Molly was introduced to the actual Bullitt Mustang, a 1968 Mustang Fastback with a 390 cubic-inch engine and a four-speed manual gearbox. That car has been in possession of the same family since 1974 and hidden away from the public until then, when it was driven out from under the press stand and up the center aisle of Ford&#x27;s booth to much fanfare.

===Memorabilia===

==== Motorcycles and cars ====
McQueen drove a Porsche 917 Chassis 022 extensively in &quot;Le Mans&quot;. After being sold and raced in the 1970s, Jerry Seinfeld acquired 022 in 2002, who asked Joe Cavaglieri to fully restore it to the 1971 film era in Gulf Porsche team livery. 022 will be auctioned on 18 January 2025 by Mecum Auctions. 022 now has a dedicated webpage and video which features interviews with Seinfeld, Porsche Team members and grandson Chase McQueen. The 1970 Porsche 911S purchased while making the film &quot;Le Mans&quot; and appearing in the opening sequence was sold at auction in August 2011 for $1.375 million.

One of his motorcycles, a 1937 Crocker, sold for a world-record price of $276,500 at the same auction. McQueen&#x27;s 1963 metallic-brown Ferrari 250 GT Lusso Berlinetta sold for US$2.31 million at auction on August 16, 2007. Except for three motorcycles sold with other memorabilia in 2006, most of McQueen&#x27;s collection of 130 motorcycles was sold four years after his death.
From 1995 to 2011, McQueen&#x27;s red 1957 fuel-injected Chevrolet convertible was displayed at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles in a special Cars of Steve McQueen exhibit. It is now in the collection of actress Ruth Buzzi and her husband Kent Perkins. McQueen&#x27;s British racing green 1956 Jaguar XKSS is located in the Petersen Automotive Museum and is in drivable condition, having been driven by Jay Leno in an episode of &quot;Jay Leno&#x27;s Garage&quot;. In August 2019, Mecum Auctions announced it would auction the Bullitt Mustang Hero Car at its Kissimmee auction, held January 2–12, 2020. The car sold without reserve for $3.4 million ($3.74 million after commissions and fees).

==== Watches ====

McQueen was a sponsored ambassador for Heuer watches. In the 1971 film &quot;Le Mans&quot;, he famously wore a blue-faced Monaco Ref. 1133, which led to its cult status among watch collectors, purchasing six watches of the same model for the shoot of the film. On December 12, 2020, one of the last six models and one of two held in private hands was sold for a record US$2.208 million at a Phillips auction in New York City, becoming the most expensive Heuer watch sold at auction. Tag Heuer continues to promote its Monaco range with McQueen&#x27;s image.

The Rolex Explorer II, Reference 1655, known as Rolex Steve McQueen in the horology collectors&#x27; world, the Rolex Submariner, Reference 5512, which McQueen was often photographed wearing in private moments, sold for $234,000 at auction on June 11, 2009, a world-record price for the type.

In June 2018, Phillips announced McQueen&#x27;s Rolex Submariner to hit the auction block in September that year. However, there was controversy whether the watch was his personal watch worn by McQueen himself or if the watch was bought, engraved, then gifted. Phillips later removed the watch from the auction block.

Among McQueen&#x27;s other watches was a Hanhart 417 chronograph.

==== Sunglasses ====

The blue-tinted sunglasses (Persol 714) worn by McQueen in the 1968 film &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; sold at a Bonhams &amp; Butterfield auction in Los Angeles for $70,200 in 2006.

<text>The Thin Man Goes Home is a 1944 American comedy mystery film directed by Richard Thorpe. It is the fifth of the six &quot;Thin Man&quot; films starring William Powell and Myrna Loy as Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s dapper ex-private detective Nick Charles and his wife Nora. The supporting cast includes Lucile Watson, Gloria DeHaven and Helen Vinson. This entry in &quot;The Thin Man&quot; series was the first not directed by W.S. Van Dyke, who had died in 1943.

==Plot==
Nick and Nora visit Nick&#x27;s parents in Nick&#x27;s hometown, Sycamore Springs, in New England. The residents are convinced that Nick is in town on an investigation, despite Nick&#x27;s repeated denials. However, when aircraft factory employee Peter Berton seeks out Nick and is shot dead before he can reveal anything, Nick is on the case.

An old childhood friend, Dr. Bruce Clayworth, performs the autopsy and extracts a pistol bullet. When Nick searches Berton&#x27;s room for clues, he is knocked unconscious by Crazy Mary, a local eccentric. 
Nora&#x27;s innocent purchase of a painting for Nick&#x27;s birthday present turns out to be the key to the mystery. When she shows it to her husband, it brings back unpleasant memories for him, so she donates it to a charity bazaar. When Edgar Draque offers Nora a large sum for the painting, Nick wonders why it is so valuable. Nick learns that Draque&#x27;s wife Helena bought the artwork, but she is knocked out and the painting disappears. Nick discovers that Crazy Mary is Berton&#x27;s mother and goes to see her, only to come across her lifeless body. Nick and Nora&#x27;s dog Asta finds the painting in her shack.

Nick puts the pieces together and has the police bring all the suspects to his father&#x27;s house. Early on, it is revealed that Nick&#x27;s father, Dr. Bertram Charles, has never been overly impressed with his son&#x27;s unusual career choice, so this allows Nick to change his father&#x27;s mind. Using Dr. Charles&#x27;s fluoroscope, Nick shows that there is a blueprint hidden underneath the paint. Several people identify it as part of the specifications for a new aircraft propeller worth a great deal to a &quot;foreign power&quot;. Berton had copied the blueprints and concealed the copies under five paintings. He had a change of heart and was going to confess all to Nick, but was killed by the spies he was dealing with. Nick has a souvenir World War II Japanese Nambu sniper rifle belonging to Dr. Clayworth&#x27;s brother brought in and claims it was the murder weapon. Then, after proving that the Draques are members of the spy ring, Nick reveals the identity of its leader: Dr. Bruce Clayworth. Clayworth&#x27;s first slip was the bullet he showed Nick. Nick knew a handgun bullet would not have the power to penetrate as far into Berton&#x27;s body as the real one went. Clayworth grabs the rifle. He confesses to the murder, and also to a deep hatred for Nick for always being better than him in their youth. He tries to shoot his nemesis, only to find that Nick had taken the precaution of removing the firing pin. Nick&#x27;s father is very impressed.

==Production==
Production of a &quot;Thin Man&quot; film had been planned for 1942, but Myrna Loy refused the role because her attention was focused on her recent marriage to John D. Hertz, Jr. and her all-consuming War work for the Red Cross. Fans received the suggestion that Irene Dunne might take over the role of Nora with horror. TCM&#x27;s Roger Fristoe quotes Powell recalling later: &quot;The fans wanted Myrna, and they didn&#x27;t want anyone else...And I wanted Myrna, too. Besides the favorable reception our pictures always received, I must say it was certainly a pleasure to work with her&quot;. Powell remembered the spectacular welcome Loy received on her first day back to a set thronged with well-wishers: &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen a girl so popular with so many people... Everybody from wardrobe was over the set, everybody from makeup, everybody from property, everybody from miles around, it looked like&quot;.

&quot;The Thin Man Goes Home&quot; was Loy&#x27;s only wartime picture.

The cocktail shaker, a staple prop from previous films in the series, ceased to be omnipresent in this one, replaced by a running gag about how difficult it is to get a drink in Nick’s hometown: Nick&#x27;s faithful flask contains only cider. TCM&#x27;s Notes on the film say that &quot;according to an April 1944 &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; news item, wartime liquor rationing prompted producer Everett Riskin to eliminate the heavy drinking that had been an integral part of Nick and Nora&#x27;s daily life in previous &quot;The Thin Man&quot; films&quot;.

The film was the fifth of six based on the characters of Nick and Nora:
* &quot;The Thin Man&quot; (1934)
* &quot;After the Thin Man&quot; (1936)
* &quot;Another Thin Man&quot; (1939)
* &quot;Shadow of the Thin Man&quot; (1941)
* &quot;The Thin Man Goes Home&quot; (1944)
* &quot;Song of the Thin Man&quot; (1947)

==Box office==
According to MGM records, the film earned $1,770,000 in the US and Canada, and $1,044,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $501,000.

<text>I Love Lucy is an American sitcom that originally aired on CBS from October 15, 1951, to May 6, 1957, with a total of 180 half-hour episodes spanning six seasons. The series starred Lucille Ball and her husband Desi Arnaz, along with Vivian Vance and William Frawley, and follows the life of Lucy Ricardo (Ball), a young, middle-class housewife living in New York City, who often concocts plans with her best friends and landlords, Ethel and Fred Mertz (Vance and Frawley), to appear alongside her bandleader husband, Ricky Ricardo (Arnaz), in his nightclub. Lucy is depicted trying numerous schemes to mingle with and be a part of show business. After the series ended in 1957, a modified version of the show continued for three more seasons, with 13 one-hour specials, which ran from 1957 to 1960. It was first known as &quot;The Lucille Ball–Desi Arnaz Show,&quot; and later, in reruns, as &quot;The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour&quot;.

&quot;I Love Lucy&quot; became the most-watched show in the United States in four of its six seasons and it was the first to end its run at the top of the Nielsen ratings. As of 2011, episodes of the show have been syndicated in dozens of languages across the world and remain popular with an American audience of 40 million each year. A colorized version of its Christmas episode attracted more than eight million viewers when CBS aired it in prime time in 2013, 62 years after the show premiered.

The showwhich was the first scripted television program to be filmed on 35 mm film in front of a studio audience, by cinematographer Karl Freundwon five Emmy Awards and received many nominations and honors. It was the first show to feature an ensemble cast. As such, it is often regarded as one of the most influential television programs in history. In 2012, it was voted the &#x27;Best TV Show of All Time&#x27; in a survey conducted by ABC News and &quot;People&quot; magazine. In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked it #12 on their list of the 101 Best Written TV Series.

==Premise==
Originally set in an apartment building in New York City, &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; centers on Lucy Ricardo (Lucille Ball) and her singer/bandleader husband, Ricky Ricardo (Desi Arnaz), along with their best friends and landlords, Fred Mertz (William Frawley) and Ethel Mertz (Vivian Vance). During the second season, Lucy and Ricky have a son named Ricky Ricardo Jr., who often goes by &quot;Little Ricky&quot; and is portrayed by multiple actors throughout the seasons. His birth was timed to coincide with the real-life birth of Ball&#x27;s son, Desi Arnaz Jr.

Lucy is naïve and ambitious, with a hunger for stardom and a knack for getting both herself and her husband into trouble whenever she yearns to make it big in show business. The Ricardos&#x27; best friends, Fred and Ethel, are former vaudevillians. The Mertzes&#x27; history in entertainment only strengthens Lucy&#x27;s resolve to prove herself as a performer, though she often feels excluded, as her industry involvement is limited relative to that of Ricky, Fred, and Ethel. Though charismatic, throughout the series, she is depicted as having few marketable performance skills, and she is often portrayed as being tone deaf, struggling to sing anything other than off-key renditions of songs such as &quot;Glow Worm&quot; on the saxophone, and many of her performances end in disaster. However, to say she is completely without talent would be untrue, as on occasion, she is shown to be a good dancer and a competent singer. She is also at least twice offered contracts by television or film companiesfirst in the season 1 episode &quot;The Audition&quot;, when she replaces an injured clown in Ricky&#x27;s act at the Tropicana nightclub, and later in the season 5 episode &quot;Lucy and the Dummy&quot;, when she dances in Hollywood for a studio party using a rubber Ricky dummy as her dancing partner.

Little information was offered about Lucy&#x27;s past. A few episodes mentioned that she was born in Jamestown, New York (Ball&#x27;s real-life home town), later specified to be West Jamestown, that she graduated from Jamestown High School, that her maiden name was &quot;McGillicuddy&quot; (indicating a Scottish or Irish ethnicity, at least on her father&#x27;s side, though she once mentioned her grandmother was Swedish), and that she met Ricky on a cruise with her friend from an agency she once worked for. Her family was absent, other than occasional appearances by her scatter-brained mother Mrs. McGillicuddy (Kathryn Card), who could never get Ricky&#x27;s name right. Lucy was also secretive about her age and true hair color, and tended to be careless with money, in addition to being somewhat materialistic, insisting on buying new dresses and hats for every occasion and telling old friends that she and Ricky were wealthy. She was also depicted as a devoted housewife, adept cook, and attentive mother. As part of Lucy&#x27;s role was to care for her husband, she stayed at home and took care of the household chores, while her husband Ricky went to work. During the post-war era, Lucy took jobs outside of the home, but in these jobs the show portrayed her as being inept outside of her usual domestic duties.

Lucy&#x27;s husband, Ricky Ricardo, is an up-and-coming Cuban American singer and bandleader with an excitable personality. His patience is frequently tested by his wife&#x27;s antics trying to get into showbiz, along with her exorbitant spending on clothes and furniture. When exasperated, he often reverts to speaking rapidly in Spanish. As with Lucy, not much is revealed about his past or family. Ricky&#x27;s mother (played by actress Mary Emery) appears in two episodes; in another, Lucy mentions that he has five brothers. Ricky also mentions that he had been &quot;practically raised&quot; by his Uncle Alberto (who was seen during a family visit to Cuba), and that he had attended the University of Havana. A catchphrase strongly associated with Ricky is &quot;Lucy, you got some &#x27;splaining to do&quot; (sometimes &quot;Lucy, you got a lotta splainin to do&quot;), whenever something Lucy had kept a secret from Ricky that turned into a complicated, problematic situation and was finally revealed to him. The line is still often mentioned in articles about &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and printed on official merchandise, despite the fact that Ricky never says this phrase in any episode.

An extended flashback segment in the 1957 episode &quot;Lucy Takes a Cruise to Havana&quot; of &quot;The Lucille Ball–Desi Arnaz Show&quot; filled in numerous details of how Lucy and Ricky met and how Ricky came to the United States. The story, at least insofar as related to newspaper columnist Hedda Hopper, is that the couple met in Havana when Lucy and the Mertzes vacationed there in 1940. Despite his being a university graduate and proficient in English, Ricky is portrayed as a driver of a horse-drawn cab who waits for fares at a pier where tourists arrive by ship. Ricky is hired to serve as one of Lucy&#x27;s tour guides, and the two fall in love. Having coincidentally also met popular singer Rudy Vallée on the cruise ship, Lucy arranges an audition for Ricky, who is hired to be in Vallée&#x27;s orchestra, thus allowing him to emigrate to the United States on the very ship on which Lucy and the Mertzes were returning. Lucy later states that Ricky played for Vallée only one night before being traded to Xavier Cugat&#x27;s orchestra.

The extended flashback segment &quot;Lucy Takes a Cruise to Havana&quot; and the story of how Lucy and Ricky met is inconsistent with the season 4 episode &quot;Don Juan and the Starlets&quot;. At one point in that episode, Lucy, after finding out that she was not invited to join Ricky at a movie premiere, bemoans that she made a mistake fifteen years before when her friend Marion Strong asked her if she would like to go on a blind date with a Cuban drummer, to which she said &quot;yes.&quot;

Throughout the series, Lucy is usually found with her best friend, Ethel. A former singer and actress in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Ethel tries to relive her glory days in vaudeville. Ricky is more inclined to include Ethel in performances at his nightclub because, unlike Lucy, she can sing and dance rather well.

The show mentions that Ethel&#x27;s husband, Fred, served in World War I, and lived through the Great Depression. As such, in the series, Fred is depicted as being very stingy with money and as being an irascible, no-nonsense type. However, he also reveals that he can be a soft touch, especially when it comes to Little Ricky, to whom Fred is both godfather and honorary &quot;uncle.&quot; Fred can also sing and dance, and he often performs duets with Ethel.

The Manhattan building they all lived in before their move to Westport, Connecticut during the sixth season was addressed at a fictional 623 East 68th Street, at first in apartment 4A, then moving to the larger apartment 3B (subsequently re-designated &quot;3D&quot;; the Mertzes’ apartment is then numbered &quot;3B&quot;), on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. In actuality, however, the addresses go up only to the 500s before the street terminates at the East River.

Gale Gordon and Bea Benaderet, supporting cast members on &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot;, were originally approached for the roles of Fred and Ethel, but neither could accept, owing to previous commitments. Gordon did appear as a guest star, playing Ricky&#x27;s boss, Mr. Littlefield, in two episodes of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, and later a civil court judge in an episode of &quot;The Lucille Ball–Desi Arnaz Show&quot;. Gordon was a veteran from the classic radio days in which he perfected the role of the exasperated character, as in &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; and &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot;. He would go on to co-star with Ball in all of her post–&quot;I Love Lucy&quot; series (&quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; and &quot;Life with Lucy&quot;). Benaderet was a guest star in one episode as elderly Miss Lewis, a neighbor of the Ricardos.

Barbara Pepper (later featured as Doris Ziffel in the series &quot;Green Acres&quot;) was also considered to play Ethel, but Pepper had been drinking very heavily after the death of her husband, Craig W. Reynolds. Her friendship with Ball dated back to the film &quot;Roman Scandals&quot; (1933), in which both appeared as Goldwyn Girls. She did, however, turn up in at least nine episodes of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; in bit parts.

Many of the characters in the series were named after Ball&#x27;s family members or close friends. For example, Marion Strong was one of her best friends and a roommate for a time in New York, and she also set Ball and Arnaz up on their first date. Lillian Appleby was a teacher of Ball&#x27;s when she was in an amateur production on the stage. Additionally, Pauline Lopus was a childhood friend, while &quot;Fred&quot; was the name of both Ball&#x27;s brother and her grandfather. Ball and Arnaz had a business manager by the name of Mr. Andrew Hickox, and in the first episode of season 4, called &quot;The Business Manager&quot;, Ricky hires a man named Mr. Hickox.

==Background and development==
===Background===
Lucille Ball came to Hollywood after a successful stint as a New York model. She was chosen by Samuel Goldwyn to be one of 16 Goldwyn Girls to co-star in the picture &quot;Roman Scandals&quot; (1933), with film star Eddie Cantor. Enthusiastic and hard-working, Ball had been able to secure film work briefly at the Samuel Goldwyn Studio and Columbia Pictures and then eventually at RKO Radio Pictures. It was at RKO that Ball received steady film work, first as an extra and bit player and eventually working her way up to co-starring roles in feature films and starring roles in second-rate B pictures, collectively earning her the nickname &quot;Queen of the B&#x27;s&quot;. During her run at RKO, Ball gained the reputation for doing physical comedy and stunts that most other actresses avoided, keeping her steadily employed. In 1940, Ball met Desi Arnaz, a Cuban bandleader who had just come off a successful run in the 1939–40 Broadway show &quot;Too Many Girls&quot;. RKO, after purchasing film rights to the show, cast Ball as Arnaz&#x27;s love interest in the picture. The duo began a whirlwind courtship, leading to their elopement in Connecticut in November 1940. Despite their marriage, however, their careers kept them separated, with Ball&#x27;s film work keeping her anchored in Hollywood, while Arnaz&#x27;s nightclub engagements with his orchestra kept him on the road.

Despite steadily working in pictures, Ball&#x27;s movie career never advanced to the level of a headlining feature-film actress. Nevertheless, she remained popular with film audiences. Ball came to the attention of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer after receiving critical acclaim for her starring role in the 1942 Damon Runyon film &quot;The Big Street&quot;, which bought out her contract. It was under contract with MGM, however, that Ball, who had previously been a blonde, dyed her hair red to complement the Technicolor features that MGM planned to use her in. MGM cast Ball in a variety of films, but it was her work with fellow comedian Red Skelton in the 1943 film &quot;DuBarry Was a Lady&quot; that brought Ball&#x27;s physical comedy to the forefront, earning her the reputation as &quot;that crazy redhead”, which Ricky would later call her on the show. Nonetheless, Ball&#x27;s striking beauty was in sharp contrast to the physical antics she performed in her films. Throughout her career, MGM tried to utilize her in multiple different film genres that did little to highlight her skills. Given their difficulties in casting her, MGM chose not to renew her contract when it expired in 1946.

Ball began working as a freelance artist in films and also began to explore other venues. Before and during World War II, Ball made several notable and successful guest appearances on several radio programs, including both Jack Haley&#x27;s radio show and bandleader Kay Kyser&#x27;s radio program. These appearances brought Ball to the attention of CBS, which, in 1948, enlisted her to star in one of two new half-hour situation comedies in development, &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot; and &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot;. Choosing the latter, Ball portrayed Liz Cugat (later anglicized to Cooper), the frustrated and scheming housewife of a Minneapolis banker, played originally by actor Lee Bowman in the series pilot, and later by Richard Denning. Based on the novel &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Cugat&quot;, by Isabel Scott Rorick, &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot; was produced by Jess Oppenheimer and written by Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh, and Bob Carroll Jr. Premiering on July 23, 1948, and sponsored by General Foods, &quot;Husband&quot; became a hit for CBS. During the run of the radio program, Ball also appeared in two feature films with Bob Hope, &quot;Sorrowful Jones&quot; in 1949, and &quot;Fancy Pants&quot; in 1950. Both films were box office and critical successes, further cementing Ball&#x27;s reputation as a top-notch, first-rate comedian. They also highlighted her growing popularity with audiences, enticing CBS to further use her skills.

In 1950, CBS asked Ball to take &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot; to television with co-star Richard Denning. Ball saw a television show as a great opportunity to work with Arnaz, however, and she insisted that he play her husband, much to the dismay of CBS, which was reluctant to cast Arnaz in that role, as he was Cuban. CBS executives did not think audiences would buy into a marriage between an all-American girl and a Latin man. To prove CBS wrong, the couple developed a vaudeville act, written by Carroll and Pugh, that they performed at Newburgh, NY&#x27;s historic Ritz Theater with Arnaz&#x27;s orchestra. The act was a hit and convinced CBS executive Harry Ackerman that a Ball–Arnaz pairing would be a worthwhile venture. At the same time, rival networks NBC, ABC, and DuMont were showing interest in a Ball–Arnaz series, which Ackerman used to convince CBS to sign the duo.

A pilot was ordered and kinescoped in Hollywood in March 1951, which coincided with Ball&#x27;s first pregnancy, and the ending of &quot;Husband&quot;, which aired its last radio show on March 31, 1951. Ball and Arnaz used the same radio team of Oppenheimer, Pugh, and Carroll to create the television series that was named &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. The couple&#x27;s agent, Don Sharpe, brought the pilot to several advertising agencies with little luck but finally succeeded with the Milton H. Biow agency. Biow&#x27;s agency presented the pilot to its clients and convinced cigarette giant Philip Morris to sponsor the show.

Every episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; would be taped in front of a studio audience consisting of 300 members, with Desi Arnaz acting as emcee before every episode taping. One notable taping, which occurred when Ball was being investigated for potential Communist sympathies in 1953, involved Arnaz telling the audience “Now I want you to meet my favorite wife, my favorite redhead. In fact, that’s the only thing red about her. And even that’s not legitimate, Lucile Ball.”

===Production===

During the spring and summer of 1951, &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; moved into production. Oppenheimer, Pugh, and Carroll began fine-tuning the premise of the show and writing the series&#x27; first scripts. The trio chose to adapt many storylines for television using the backlog of episodes of &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot;. In addition, the series&#x27; ensemble cast and crew were assembled. Arnaz retained his orchestra, which was used in the series&#x27; musical numbers and to score the show&#x27;s background and transitional music. Arnaz&#x27;s childhood friend Marco Rizo arranged the music and played the piano for the show, while Wilbur Hatch conducted the orchestra. 

After Philip Morris signed on to sponsor the show, two problems that would ultimately change the fate of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; arose. Ball and Arnaz had originally decided that the series would air biweekly, like &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot;. Philip Morris, however, was insistent that the show air weekly, thus diminishing the possibility of Ball continuing her film career alongside a television show. Another problem lay in the fact that Philip Morris wanted the series to originate from New York rather than Hollywood. At the time, most television shows were produced from New York and broadcast live for eastern and Midwest audiences. West Coast viewers were able to view live programs only through low-quality kinescopes, which derived their images by using a 35 mm or 16 mm film camera to record the show from a television monitor.

Although the pilot film shown to Philip Morris had been a kinescope, the sponsor did not want the lucrative East Coast market, accustomed to quality broadcasts, to see a low-quality kinescope film. Owing to the impending birth of their first child, both Ball and Arnaz insisted on staying in Hollywood and producing the show on film, something a few Hollywood-based series had begun to do. Both CBS and Philip Morris initially balked at the idea, because of the higher cost that filming the show would incur, and acquiesced only after the couple offered to take a $1,000-a-week pay cut in order to cover the additional expense. In exchange, Ball and Arnaz demanded, and were given, 80% ownership in the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; films (the other 20% went to Oppenheimer, who then gave 5% to Pugh and 5% to Carroll). Shooting the show on film, however, would require that Ball and Arnaz become responsible for producing the series themselves. Union agreements at the time stipulated that any production filmed in a studio use film studio employees. CBS staff were television and radio employees and thus fell under different union agreements. Thus, Arnaz reorganized the company he created to manage his orchestra bookings and used it as the corporation that would produce the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; shows. The company was named Desilu, from the combination of both of their first names, &quot;Desi&quot; and &quot;Lucille&quot;.

Though some television series were already being filmed in Hollywood, most used the single-camera format familiar from movies, with a laugh track added to comedies to simulate audience response. Ball wanted to work in front of a live audience to create the kind of comic energy she had displayed on radio. The idea of a film studio that could accommodate an audience was a new one for the time, as fire safety regulations made it difficult to allow an audience in a studio. Arnaz and Oppenheimer found the financially struggling General Service Studios located on Las Palmas Avenue in Hollywood. Studio owner Jimmy Nasser was eager to accommodate the Desilu company and allowed them, with the financial backing of CBS, to renovate two of his studios so that they could accommodate an audience and be in compliance with local fire laws.

Another component to filming the show came when it was decided to use three 35 mm film cameras to simultaneously film the show. The idea had been pioneered by Jerry Fairbanks, and it had been used on the live anthology series &quot;The Silver Theater&quot; and the game show &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot;, as well as, subsequently, &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; as a way to save money, though &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; did not use an audience. Edwards&#x27;s assistant Al Simon was hired by Desilu to help perfect the new technique for the series. The process lent itself to the &quot;Lucy&quot; production as it eliminated the problem of requiring an audience to view and react to a scene three or four times in order for all necessary shots to be filmed. Multiple cameras would also allow scenes to be performed in sequence, as a play would be, which was unusual at the time for filmed series. Retakes were rare and dialogue mistakes were often left in the episodes.

Ball and Arnaz enlisted the services of Karl Freund, a cinematographer who had worked on such films as &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927), &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931), &quot;The Good Earth&quot; (1937), and &quot;DuBarry Was a Lady&quot; (1943) (which also starred Ball), as well as directed &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1932), to be the series cinematographer. Although at first Freund did not want anything to do with television, it was the personal plea of the couple that convinced him to take the job.

Freund was instrumental in developing a way to uniformly light the set so that each of the three cameras would pick up the same quality of image. Freund noted that a typical episode (20–22 min.) was shot in about 60 minutes, with one constant concern being the shades-of-gray contrast in the final print, as each stage of transmission and broadcast would exaggerate the contrast. Freund also pioneered &quot;flat lighting&quot;, in which everything is brightly lit to eliminate shadows and the need for endless relighting.

Audience reactions were live, which created a more authentic laugh than the canned laughter used on most filmed sitcoms of the time. Regular audience members were sometimes heard from episode to episode, and Arnaz&#x27;s distinctive laugh could be heard in the background during scenes in which he did not perform, as well as Ball&#x27;s mother, DeDe, whose distinctive &quot;uh oh&quot; could be heard in many of the episodes. In later years, CBS would devise a laugh track from several &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; audiences and use them for canned laughter on shows done without a live audience.

&quot;I Love Lucy&quot;&#x27;s pioneering use of three cameras led to it becoming the standard technique for the production of most sitcoms filmed in front of an audience. Single-camera setups remained the technique of choice for sitcoms that did not use audiences. This led to an unexpected benefit for Desilu during the series&#x27; second season when it was discovered that Ball was pregnant. Not being able to fulfill the show&#x27;s 39-episode commitment, both Desi and Oppenheimer decided to rebroadcast popular episodes of the series&#x27; first season to help give Ball the necessary rest she needed after she gave birth, effectively allowing fewer episodes to be filmed that season. Unexpectedly, the rebroadcasts proved to be ratings winners, effectively giving birth to the rerun, which would later lead to the profitable development of the rerun syndication market.

The show&#x27;s original opening and commercial bumpers were animated caricatures of Ball and Arnaz. They were designed and animated by MGM character designer, and future &quot;Flintstones&quot; cartoonist, Gene Hazelton (1917–2005) and were produced under a contract that producer William Hanna had secured privately. The program sponsor, Philip Morris cigarettes, was incorporated into many of these sequences, so when &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; went into repeats, the sponsor material was replaced by the now-familiar heart logo. However, Hazelton&#x27;s original animation survives and can be seen in the DVD boxed set as originally presented.

Desilu Productions, jointly owned by Ball and Arnaz, would gradually expand to produce and lease studio space for many other shows. For seasons 1 and 2 (1951–1953), Desilu rented space and filmed &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; at General Service Studios, which eventually became known as Hollywood Center Studios. In 1953, it leased the Motion Picture Center at 846 Cahuenga Blvd. in Hollywood, renaming it &quot;Desilu Studios&quot;, to shoot seasons 3–6 (1953–1957) of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. After 1956, it became known as &quot;Desilu-Cahuenga Studios&quot; to avoid confusion with other acquired Desilu locations. In an effort to keep up with the studio&#x27;s growth, and need for additional sound stages, Arnaz and Ball purchased RKO Radio Pictures from General Tire in 1957 for over $6 million, effectively owning the studio where they had started as contract players. Desilu acquired RKO&#x27;s two studio complexes, located on Gower Street in Hollywood and in Culver City (now part of the Paramount lot and Culver Studios respectively), along with the Culver City back lot nicknamed &quot;Forty Acres&quot;. The sale was achieved by the duo selling their ownership of the once-thought-worthless &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; films back to CBS for over four million dollars.

In 1962, two years after their marriage dissolved, Ball bought out Arnaz&#x27;s shares of Desilu, becoming the studio&#x27;s sole owner. She eventually sold off Desilu in 1967 to Gulf+Western, owners of Paramount Pictures. After the sale, Desilu-Cahuenga became a private production company and was known as Ren-Mar Studios until 2010, when it was acquired by the Red Digital Cinema Camera Company and renamed Red Studios Hollywood.

===The Mertzes===
As with &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot;, &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; writers decided that the Ricardos needed an older couple to play off of. While performing in &quot;Husband&quot;, veteran character actors Gale Gordon and Bea Benaderet had played Rudolph and Iris Atterbury, an older, more financially stable couple as Mr. Atterbury had been George Cooper&#x27;s boss. Ball had initially wanted both actors to reprise their roles on television; however, both were unavailable at the time the show went into production as Benaderet was already playing Blanche Morton on &quot;The Burns and Allen Show&quot;, and Gordon was under contract by CBS to play Mr. Conklin on both the radio and television versions of &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot;.

Casting the Mertzes, as they were now called (the surname taken from a doctor that &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; scriptwriter Madelyn Pugh knew as a child in Indianapolis), proved to be a challenge. Ball had initially wanted character actor James Gleason, with whom she appeared in the Columbia Pictures film &quot;Miss Grant Takes Richmond&quot; (1949), to play Fred Mertz. However, Gleason wanted nearly $3,500 per episode to play the role, a price that was far too high to sustain.
Sixty-four-year-old William Frawley, a seasoned vaudevillian and movie character actor with nearly 100 film credits to his name, was a long shot to play Fred Mertz and only came into consideration after he telephoned Ball personally to ask if there was a role for him on her new show. Ball, who had only briefly known Frawley from her days at RKO, suggested him to both Arnaz and CBS. The network objected to the idea of casting Frawley, fearing that his excessive drinkingwhich was well known in Hollywoodwould interfere with a commitment to a live show. Arnaz nonetheless liked Frawley and lobbied hard for him to have the role, even to the point of having Lucy scribes re-tailor the role of Fred Mertz to be a less financially successful and more curmudgeonly (in contrast to Gordon&#x27;s Mr. Atterbury) character to fit Frawley&#x27;s persona. CBS relented only after Arnaz contractually bound Frawley to complete sobriety during the production of the show, and reportedly told the veteran actor that if he ever appeared on-set more than once in an intoxicated state he would be fired. Not once during &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;&#x27;s nine seasons did Frawley&#x27;s drinking ever interfere with his performance, and over time Arnaz became one of Frawley&#x27;s few close friends.

The role of Ethel Mertz also took quite some time to cast. Since Lucy&#x27;s &quot;Husband&quot; co-star Bea Benaderet was not available, Mary Wickes, a longtime friend, was offered the role but declined because she did not want to strain her friendship with Ball. Actress Barbara Pepper, who was a close friend of Ball, was also considered for the role. The two had a long history together, as Pepper had been one of the Goldwyn Girls who came to Hollywood with Lucy in 1933. Pepper was ruled out by Ball and Arnaz because she too had a drinking problem like Frawley.

Vivian Vance became a consideration on the recommendation of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; director Marc Daniels. Daniels had worked with Vance in New York on Broadway in the early 1940s. Vance had already been a successful stage star performing on Broadway for nearly 20 years in a variety of plays, and in addition, after relocating to Hollywood in the late 1940s, had two film roles to her credit. Nonetheless, by 1951, she was still a relatively unknown actress in Hollywood. Vance was performing in a revival of the play &quot;The Voice of the Turtle&quot; in La Jolla, California. Arnaz and Jess Oppenheimer went to see her in the play and hired her on the spot. Vance was reluctant to give up her film and stage work for a television show yet was convinced by Daniels that it would be a big break in her career. Ball, however, had many misgivings about hiring Vance, who was younger and far more attractive than the concept of Ethel as an older, somewhat homely woman (Vance was two years older than Ball). Ball was also a believer in the Hollywood adage at the time that there should be only one pretty woman on the set and Ball, being the star of the show, would be it. Arnaz, however, was impressed by Vance&#x27;s work and hired her. The decision was then made to dress Vance in frumpier clothing to tone down her attractiveness. Eventually realizing that Vance was no threat and was professional, Ball began to warm to her. In 1954, Vance became the first actress to win an Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Supporting Actress&quot;. Vance and Ball developed a close, lifelong friendship with Ball frequently listening to Vance&#x27;s input during episode productions. In 1962, after the end of &quot;I Love Lucy,&quot; Ball would ask Vance to co-star in her new series &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;.

Vance and Frawley disliked each other. However, they were always professional while performing on the show. Frawley derisively described Vance&#x27;s appearance as &quot;a sack of doorknobs.&quot; It was reported that Vance, who was 22 years younger than Frawley, was not really keen on the idea that her character Ethel was married to a man that was old enough to be her father. Vance also complained that Frawley&#x27;s song-and-dance skills were not what they once were. Frawley and Vance had an adversarial relationship during the entire run of the show.
In 1957, &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; was re-tailored into an hour-long show originally titled &quot;The Lucille Ball–Desi Arnaz Show&quot; that was to be part of an anthology series called the &quot;Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse&quot;. The hour-long &quot;Lucy–Desi&quot; show was to alternate monthly with other hour-long &quot;Playhouse&quot; shows. The new series put a much heavier emphasis on big-name guest stars and, although the Mertz characters continued into the new series, their roles became somewhat diminished. Although a lighter workload was welcomed by Frawley, Vance came to somewhat resent the change. Arnaz, in an effort to please Vance, for whom he had much respect, proposed doing a spin-off from &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; called &quot;The Mertzes&quot;. Seeing a lucrative opportunity and the chance to star in his own show, Frawley was enthused. Vance, however, declined for a number of reasons, the biggest factor being that she felt she and Frawley could barely work together on the ensemble show they were doing at the time, so it would be much less likely the two could work together on their own series. Vance also felt that the Mertz characters would not be as successful without the Ricardos to play off of, and despite being her biggest success, she was becoming interested in playing more glamorous roles rather than Ethel. During the thirteen-episode run of the &quot;Lucy–Desi&quot; hour-long shows, Vance was given a lot more latitude to look more attractive as Ethel, something she was denied during the run of the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; episodes. Frawley&#x27;s resentment of Vance intensified after she declined to do the spin-off show and the two rarely talked to each other outside of their characters&#x27; dialogue with one another.

===Pregnancy and Little Ricky===
Just before filming the show, Ball and Arnaz learned that she was once again pregnant (after multiple miscarriages earlier in their marriage) with their first child, Lucie Arnaz. They filmed the original pilot while Lucy was &quot;showing&quot; but did not include any references to the pregnancy in the episode. This was because CBS thought that talk of pregnancy might be in bad taste and because an ad agency told Arnaz not to show a pregnant woman.

Later, during the second season, Ball was pregnant again with second child Desi Arnaz Jr., and this time the pregnancy was incorporated into the series&#x27; storyline. (Contrary to popular belief, Ball&#x27;s pregnancy was not television&#x27;s first on-screen pregnancy, a distinction belonging to Mary Kay Stearns on the late 1940s sitcom &quot;Mary Kay and Johnny&quot;.)

CBS would not allow &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; to use the word &quot;pregnant&quot;, so &quot;expecting&quot; was used instead. In addition, sponsor Philip Morris made the request that Ball not be seen smoking during the pregnancy episodes. The episode &quot;Lucy Is Enceinte&quot; first aired on December 8, 1952 ( being French for &quot;expecting&quot; or &quot;pregnant&quot;). One week later, on December 15, 1952, the episode titled &quot;Pregnant Women Are Unpredictable&quot; was aired (although the show never displayed episode titles on the air). The episode in which Lucy Ricardo gives birth, &quot;Lucy Goes to the Hospital&quot;, first aired on January 19, 1953, which was the day before the inauguration of Dwight Eisenhower as President of the United States. To increase the publicity of this episode, the original air date was chosen to coincide with Ball&#x27;s real-life delivery of Desi Jr. by Caesarean section. &quot;Lucy Goes to the Hospital&quot; was watched by more people than any other television program up to that time, with 71.7% of all American television sets tuned in, topping the 67.7 rating for the inauguration coverage the following morning.

Unlike some programs that advance the age of a newborn over a short period, &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; at first allowed the Ricardos&#x27; son Little Ricky to grow up in real time. America saw Little Ricky as an infant in the 1952–53 season and a toddler from 1953 to 1956. However, for the 1956–57 season, Little Ricky suddenly aged by two years, becoming a young school-age boy from 1956 to 1960. Five actors played the role, two sets of twins and later Keith Thibodeaux, whose stage name when playing Ricky Ricardo Jr. was Richard Keith. (In &quot;Lucy and Superman&quot;, Little Ricky is mentioned as being five years old but it had been less than four years since the airing of &quot;Lucy Goes to the Hospital&quot;.)

Jess Oppenheimer stated in his memoir, &quot;Laughs, Luck...and Lucy: How I Came to Create the Most Popular Sitcom of All Time&quot;, that the initial plan was to match the sex of the Ricardo&#x27;s baby with Ball&#x27;s real baby, inserting one of two alternative endings into the broadcast print at the last minute. When logistical difficulties convinced Oppenheimer to abandon this plan, he advised Desi Arnaz that as head writer, he would have Lucy Ricardo give birth to a boy. Desi Arnaz agreed, telling Oppenheimer that Ball had already given him one girl, and might give him anotherthis might be his only chance to get a son. When the baby boy was born, Desi Arnaz immediately called Oppenheimer and told him, &quot;Lucy followed your script. Ain&#x27;t she something?&quot;, to which Oppenheimer replied &quot;Terrific! That makes me the greatest writer in the world!&quot;.

===Opening===

The opening familiar to most viewers, featuring the credits superimposed over a &quot;heart on satin&quot; image, was created specifically for the 1959–67 CBS daytime network rebroadcasts and subsequent syndication. As originally broadcast, the episodes opened with animated matchstick figures of Arnaz and Ball making reference to whoever the particular episode&#x27;s sponsor was. These sequences were created by the animation team of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, who declined screen credit because they were technically under exclusive contract to MGM at the time.

The original sponsor was cigarette maker Philip Morris, so the program opened with a cartoon of Lucy and Ricky climbing down a pack of Philip Morris cigarettes. In the early episodes, Lucy and Ricky, as well as Ethel and Fred on occasion, were shown smoking Philip Morris cigarettes. Lucy even went so far as to parody Johnny Roventini&#x27;s image as the Philip Morris &quot;bellhop&quot; in the May 5, 1952, episode, &quot;Lucy Does a TV Commercial&quot;. Since the original sponsor references were no longer appropriate when the shows went into syndication, a new opening was needed, which resulted in the classic &quot;heart on satin&quot; opening. Other sponsors, whose products appeared during the original openings, were Procter &amp; Gamble for Cheer and Lilt Home Permanent (1954–57), General Foods for Sanka (1955–57), and Ford Motor Company (1956–57). The later &quot;Lucille Ball–Desi Arnaz Show&quot; was sponsored by Ford Motor Company (1957–58) and Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1958–60), as part of the &quot;Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse&quot;.

The original openings, with the sponsor names edited out, were revived on TV Land showings, with a TV Land logo superimposed to obscure the original sponsor&#x27;s logo. However, this has led some people to believe that the restored introduction was created specifically for TV Land as an example of kitsch.

The animated openings, along with the middle commercial introductory animations, are included, fully restored, in the DVDs. However, the openings are listed as special features within the disks with the &quot;heart on satin&quot; image opening the actual episodes.

The complete original broadcast versions of Seasons 1 and 2, as seen in 1951–1953 with intros, closings, and all commercials, are included on their respective Ultimate Season Blu-ray editions.

===Theme song===
The &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; theme song was written by two-time Oscar-nominee Eliot Daniel. Lyrics were later written by five-time Oscar-nominee Harold Adamson, for Desi Arnaz to sing in the 1953 episode &quot;Lucy&#x27;s Last Birthday&quot;:

&quot;I love Lucy and she loves me.&quot;
&quot;We&#x27;re as happy as two can be.&quot;
&quot;Sometimes we quarrel but then&quot;
&quot;How we love making up again.&quot;

&quot;Lucy kisses like no one can.&quot;
&quot;She&#x27;s my missus and I&#x27;m her man,&quot;
&quot;And life is heaven you see,&quot;
&quot; &#x27;Cause I love Lucy, Yes I love Lucy, and Lucy loves me!&quot;
&quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, sung by Desi Arnaz with Paul Weston and the Norman Luboff Choir, was released as the B-side of &quot;There&#x27;s a Brand New Baby (At Our House)&quot; by Columbia Records (catalog number 39937) in 1953. The song was covered by Michael Franks on the album &quot;Dragonfly Summer&quot; (1993). In 1977, the Wilton Place Street Band had a Top 40 hit with a disco version of the theme, &quot;Disco Lucy&quot;.

==Episodes==

===Broadcast history===
&quot;I Love Lucy&quot; aired Mondays from 9:00 to 9:30 PM ET on CBS for its entire first run. Each year during its summer hiatus its timeslot was occupied by various summer replacement series. Beginning in April 1955 CBS added reruns from the show&#x27;s early years to its early evening weekend schedule. This would be the first of several occasions when &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; reruns would become part of CBS&#x27;s evening, prime time, and (later on) daytime schedules.

In fall 1967, CBS began offering the series in off-network syndication. , the reruns air on the Hallmark Channel and MeTV networks and scores of television stations in the U.S. and around the world. It is currently on Paramount+.

In addition, CBS has run numerous specials, including a succession of annual specials which feature episodes which have been newly colorized.

On February 14, 2023, Pluto TV launched a 24-hour &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; channel in the United States.

The show also reruns on Catchy Comedy.

===Nielsen ratings===
The episode &quot;Lucy Goes to the Hospital&quot;, which first aired on Monday, January 19, 1953, garnered a then-record rating of 71.7, meaning that 71.7% of all households with television sets were tuned to the program, the equivalent of some 44 million viewers. That record is surpassed only by Elvis Presley&#x27;s first of three appearances on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, which aired on September 9, 1956 (82.6% share, 60.710 million viewers and a 57.1 rating ). The overall rating of 67.3 for the entire 1952 season of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; continues to be the highest average rating for any single season of a TV show.

==In other media==
===Radio===
There was some thought about creating an &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; radio show to run in conjunction with the television series as was being done at the time with the CBS hit show &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot;. On February 27, 1952, a sample &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; radio show was produced, but it never aired. This was a pilot episode, created by editing the soundtrack of the television episode &quot;Breaking the Lease&quot;, with added Arnaz narration (in character as Ricky Ricardo). It included commercials for Philip Morris, which sponsored the television series. While it never aired on radio at the time in the 1950s (Philip Morris eventually sponsored a radio edition of &quot;My Little Margie&quot; instead), copies of this radio pilot episode have been circulating among &quot;old-time radio&quot; collectors for years, and this radio pilot episode has aired in more recent decades on numerous local radio stations that air some old-time radio programming.

===Merchandise===
Ball and Arnaz authorized various types of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; merchandise. Beginning in November 1952, &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; dolls, manufactured by the American Character Doll Company, were sold. Adult-size &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; pajamas and a bedroom set were also produced; all of these items appeared on the show.
===Comic book and comic strip===
Dell Comics published 35 issues of an &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; comic book between 1954 and 1962 including two try-out Four Color issues (#535 and #559). King Features syndicated a comic strip (written by Lawrence Nadel and drawn by Bob Oksner, jointly credited as &quot;Bob Lawrence&quot;) from 1952 to 1955. Eternity Comics in the early 1990s issued comic books that reprinted the strip and Dell comic book series.

==After &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;==

===Hour-long format===

After the conclusion of the sixth season of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, Ball and Arnaz decided to cut down on the number of episodes that were filmed. Renamed &quot;The Lucille Ball–Desi Arnaz Show&quot;, also known as &quot;The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour&quot;, the program was extended to an hour and included guest stars in each episode. Thirteen episodes aired from 1957 to 1960. The main cast, Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance, William Frawley and Little Ricky/Richard Keith (birth name Keith Thibodeaux), were all in the show. &quot;The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour&quot; is available on DVD, released as &quot;I Love Lucy: The Final Seasons 7, 8, &amp; 9&quot;. On March 2, 1960, Arnaz&#x27;s birthday, the day after the last hour-long episode was filmed, Ball filed for divorce from Arnaz.

===Vivian Vance and William Frawley===
As previously mentioned, Vance and Frawley were offered a chance to take their characters to their own spin-off series. Frawley was willing, but Vance refused to ever work with Frawley again since the two did not get along. Frawley appeared once more with Lucille Ballin an episode of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; in 1965, which did not include Vance (who by then had ceased to be a regular on that show). This was his last screen appearance with Ball. Frawley died in Hollywood on March 3, 1966, of a heart attack at age 79.

===Lucille Ball&#x27;s subsequent network shows===
In 1962, Ball began a six-year run with &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, followed immediately in 1968 by six more years on a third sitcom, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, ending her regular appearances on CBS in 1974. Both &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; and &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; included Vance as recurring characters named Viv (Vivian Bagley Bunson on &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; and Vivian Jones on &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;), so named because she was tired of being recognized on the street and addressed as &quot;Ethel&quot;. Vance was a regular during the first three seasons of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; and continued to make guest appearances through the years on &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; and on &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;. In 1977, Vance and Ball were reunited one last time in the CBS special &quot;Lucy Calls the President&quot;, which co-starred Gale Gordon, whom Ball had known for very many years and who had appeared as a regular on her television shows since 1963, becoming even more prominent once Vance left &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; in 1965.

In 1986, Ball tried another sitcom, &quot;Life with Lucy&quot;. The series debuted on ABC to solid ratings, landing in Nielsen&#x27;s Top 25 for the week. Its ratings quickly declined, however, and resulted in a cancellation after eight episodes.

===Legacy, critical acclaim and other honors===
In 1989, the never-seen pilot episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; was discovered and revealed in a CBS television special, hosted by Lucie Arnaz, becoming the highest-rated program of the season.

In 2012, Emily VanDerWerff of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote retrospectively:&quot;I Love Lucy&quot; […] is one of the two foundational texts of American TV comedy, along with &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;. The series is legitimately the most influential in TV history, pioneering so many innovations and normalizing so many others that it would be easy to write an appreciation of simply, say, the show’s accidental invention of the TV rerun.

&quot;I Love Lucy&quot; continues to be held in high esteem by television critics and remains perennially popular. It was one of the first American programs seen on British televisionwhich became more open to commerce with the September 1955 launch of ITV, a commercial network that aired the series. In 1982, the launch of a second terrestrial TV station devoted to advertising-funded broadcasting (Channel 4) saw the show introduced to a new generation of fans in the UK, with the &quot;Channel 4&quot; network repeating the program several times between 1983 and 1994. , meanwhile, it remains the longest-running program to air continuously in the Los Angeles area, almost 60 years after production ended. However, the series is currently aired on KTTV on weekends and now KCOP on weekdays because both stations are a duopoly. KTTV was the original CBS-affiliated station in Los Angeles until 1951, just before &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; premiered on KNXT Channel 2 (now KCBS-TV) when CBS bought that station the same year. In the US, reruns have aired nationally on TBS (1980s–1990s), Nick at Nite (1994–2001), and TV Land (2001–2008) in addition to local channels. TV Land ended its run of the series by giving viewers the opportunity to vote on the show&#x27;s top 25 greatest episodes on December 31, 2008, through the network&#x27;s website. Unlike some shows, to which a cable channel is given exclusive rights to maximize ratings, &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; has been consistently broadcast on multiple channels simultaneously. Hallmark Channel is now the home for &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; in the United States, with the show having moved to the network on January 2, 2009, while the national version of Weigel Broadcasting&#x27;s MeTV digital subchannel network has carried the program since its debut on December 15, 2010, depending on the market (in markets where another station holds the rights, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; is substituted). The show is seen on Fox Classics in Australia.

In addition to Primetime Emmy Awards and nominations, &quot;I Love Lucy&#x27;s&quot; many honors include the following:

* The Lucille Ball Desi Arnaz Museum in Jamestown, New York is a museum memorializing Lucy and &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, including replicas of the NYC apartment set (located in the Desilu Playhouse facility in the Rapaport Center).
* In 1990, &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; became the first television show to be inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.
* In 1997, the episodes &quot;Lucy Does a TV Commercial&quot; and &quot;Lucy&#x27;s Italian Movie&quot; were respectively ranked No. 2 and No. 18 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time.
* In 1999, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked the birth of Little Ricky as the fifth greatest moment in television history.
* In 2002, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; No. 2 on its list of the 50 greatest shows, behind &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and ahead of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; (According to &quot;TV Guide&quot; columnist Matt Roush, there was a &quot;passionate&quot; internal debate about whether &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; should have been first instead of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. He stated that this was the main source of controversy in putting together the list.)
* In 2007, &quot;Time&quot; magazine placed the show on its unranked list of the 100 best television shows.
* In 2012, &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; was ranked the Best TV Comedy and the Best TV Show in &quot;Best in TV: The Greatest TV Shows of Our Time&quot;.
* In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; as the third greatest show of all time.
* In 2015, a survey of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people conducted by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; named &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; as their #8 favorite show.
* In 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; chose &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; as the greatest TV show of all time.

===Documentaries and dramatizations===
On April 28, 1990, CBS aired a television movie titled &quot;I Love Lucy: The Very First Show&quot; hosted by Lucie Arnaz, daughter of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, with commentary that showed the original unaired pilot episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; that was produced by Ball and Desi Arnaz themselves and found after 40 years. The movie was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award as an &quot;Outstanding Informational Special&quot;.

On February 10, 1991, CBS aired a television movie titled &quot;Lucy &amp; Desi: Before the Laughter&quot;, about the lives of Ball and Desi Arnaz. The movie recreated a number of scenes from classic &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; episodes, including &quot;Lucy Thinks Ricky Is Trying to Murder Her&quot; and &quot;Lucy Does a TV Commercial&quot;. Frances Fisher starred as Ball and Maurice Benard as Desi Arnaz.

On May 4, 2003, CBS aired a television movie titled &quot;Lucy&quot;, portraying the life of Ball and recreating a number of scenes from classic &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; episodes, including &quot;Lucy Does a TV Commercial&quot;, &quot;Lucy Is Enceinte&quot;, and &quot;Job Switching&quot;. Near the end of the movie, a selection of &quot;TV Guide&quot; covers is seen in a hallway, showing &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; franchises on their covers. Also included is close-up of a &quot;New York Post&quot; article about the birth of Little Ricky. Rachel York starred as Ball and Danny Pino as Desi Arnaz.

In October 2011, the stage play &quot;I Love Lucy Live on Stage&quot; premiered to sold-out houses at the Greenway Court Theatre in Los Angeles. Staged and directed by Rick Sparks, the show featured the performance of two &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; episodes&quot;The Benefit&quot; and &quot;Lucy Has Her Eyes Examined&quot;, presented to the theater audience as though they were attending a filming at the Desilu Playhouse in the 1950s. In 2012, the show began a national tour which lasted until 2015.

In July 2018, &quot;I Love Lucy: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Sitcom&quot;, a behind-the-scenes comedy about &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; by Gregg Oppenheimer (son of series creator Jess Oppenheimer), had its world premiere in a Los Angeles production by L.A. Theatre Works. Recorded before a live audience at the James Bridges Theater, UCLA, the production, directed by Michael Hackett, aired on public radio and was released on audio CD and as a downloadable file in September of that year. The performance starred Sarah Drew as Ball, Oscar Nuñez as Desi Arnaz, and Seamus Dever as Oppenheimer. A serialized version, titled &quot;LUCY LOVES DESI: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Sitcom&quot;, was produced in August 2020 by Jarvis &amp; Ayres Productions and aired in the UK on BBC Radio 4, starring Anne Heche as Ball, Wilmer Valderamma as Desi Arnaz, Jared Harris as Oppenheimer, Stacy Keach as William Frawley, and Alfred Molina as CBS Executive Harry Ackerman. In January 2023, L.A. Theatre Works mounted a 22-city U.S. national tour of the play as &quot;LUCY LOVES DESI: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Sitcom.&quot; In November 2023, Next Stage Press published the play&#x27;s script, making performance licenses available to schools, community theater groups, and local theater companies.

In the spring of 2020, NBC&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; paid tribute to &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; with a special episode titled &quot;We Love Lucy&quot;. During the episode Lucy and Ricky Ricardo, along with Ethel and Fred Mertz, appear in dream sequences based on scenes from the 1951 CBS series. Lucie Arnaz made a cameo in the episode in the role originated in the &quot;Job Switching&quot; episode by actress Elvia Allman as the Factory Foreperson.

In 2021, &quot;Being the Ricardos&quot;, a film written and directed by Aaron Sorkin, about the relationship between &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; stars Ball and Desi Arnaz, was released. Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem star as Ball and Desi Arnaz, while J. K. Simmons, Nina Arianda, Tony Hale, Alia Shawkat, Jake Lacy, and Clark Gregg are featured in supporting roles. It received a limited theatrical release by Amazon Studios in the United States on December 10, 2021, prior to streaming worldwide on Prime Video on December 21, 2021.

In 2022, Amazon Prime Video released the documentary &quot;Lucy and Desi&quot;. Directed by Amy Poehler, it was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Documentary/Nonfiction Program.

==In color==

Several classic episodes of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; have been colorized. Star and producer Desi Arnaz had expressed interest in airing the show in color as early as 1955, but the cost of such a presentation was prohibitive at the time.

The first episode to be colorized was the Christmas special, which had been feared to be lost for many years, as it was not included in the regular syndication package with the rest of the series. A copy was discovered in 1989 in the CBS vaults and was aired by CBS during December of that year in its original black-and-white format. In 1990, this episode was again aired in the days prior to Christmas, but this time the framing sequence was in color, while the clips from earlier episodes remained in black and white. The special performed surprisingly well in the ratings during both years and aired on CBS each December until 1994.

In 2007, as the &quot;Complete Series&quot; DVD set was being prepared for release, DVD producer Gregg Oppenheimer decided to have the episode &quot;Lucy Goes to Scotland&quot; digitally colorized (referencing color publicity stills and color &quot;home movies&quot; taken on the set during production), making it the first &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; episode to be fully colorized. Four years later, Time Life released the &quot;Lucy&#x27;s Italian Movie&quot; episode for the first time in full color as part of the &quot;Essential &#x27;I Love Lucy&#x27;&quot; collection.

The colorized &quot;Lucy Goes to Scotland&quot; episode has never aired on television, but that episode, along with the Christmas special and &quot;Lucy&#x27;s Italian Movie&quot;, were packaged together on the 2013 &quot;I Love Lucy Colorized Christmas&quot; DVD. In 2014, Target stores sold an exclusive version of the DVD that also included &quot;Job Switching&quot;.

As of 2025, a total of 18 episodes are known to have been colorized, 17 of which have been released on some form of home media.

===Annual colorized specials===
On December 20, 2013, CBS revived an annual holiday tradition when it reaired the Christmas special for the first time in nearly two decades. The Christmas special&#x27;s framing sequence was colorized anew. The network paired this special with the color version of &quot;Lucy&#x27;s Italian Movie&quot; episode. This special attracted 8.7 million people. Nearly a year later, on December 7, 2014, the Christmas special was again aired on CBS, but this time paired with the popular episode &quot;Job Switching&quot;, which was newly colorized for that broadcast. That episode appeared on the &quot;I Love Lucy: The Ultimate Season 2&quot; Blu-ray edition released on August 4, 2015. CBS aired the Christmas special again on December 23, 2015, with the flashback scenes being colorized for the first time, and with a colorized &quot;Lucy Does a TV Commercial&quot; replacing &quot;Job Switching&quot;. CBS next aired the Christmas special on December 2, 2016, this time paired with the newly colorized &quot;Lucy Gets in Pictures&quot;. On December 22, 2017, the Christmas episode was followed by a newly colorized episode, &quot;The Fashion Show&quot;. On December 14, 2018, the Christmas episode was paired with a newly colorized episode, &quot;Pioneer Women&quot;.

On May 17, 2015, CBS began a new springtime tradition when it aired two newly colorized episodes in an &quot;I Love Lucy Superstar Special&quot; consisting of &quot;L.A. at Last&quot; and &quot;Lucy and Superman&quot;, which attracted 6.4 million viewers. A DVD of this special was released on October 4, 2016. A second &quot;Superstar Special&quot; containing the newly colorized two-part episode &quot;Lucy Visits Grauman&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Lucy and John Wayne&quot; aired on May 20, 2016 and was released on DVD on January 17, 2017. A third &quot;Superstar Special&quot; aired on May 19, 2017, featuring two more newly colorized Hollywood-based episodes: &quot;The Dancing Star&quot; featuring Van Johnson, and &quot;Harpo Marx&quot;. A two-episode &quot;Funny Money Special&quot; was introduced on April 19, 2019, featuring the episodes &quot;The Million-Dollar Idea&quot; and &quot;Bonus Bucks&quot;, both from early 1954. On December 20, 2019, CBS aired its annual &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; Christmas episode along with a new colorized episode, &quot;Paris At Last&quot;. &quot;The I Love Lucy Christmas Special&quot; scored a 4.9 million in the ratings, becoming the night&#x27;s most-watched show on television. 

===Colorized feature film===
On August 6, 2019, Ball&#x27;s would-be 108th birthday, a one-night-only event took place in movie theaters around the United States, &quot;I Love Lucy: A Colorized Celebration&quot;, a feature film consisting of five colorized episodes, three of which contain never-before-seen content. The episodes included are: &quot;The Million Dollar Idea&quot; (1954), &quot;Lucy Does a TV Commercial&quot; (1952), &quot;Pioneer Women&quot; (1952), &quot;Job Switching&quot; (1952) and &quot;L.A. at Last!&quot; (1955). A short documentary on the colorization process of the episodes was also included. The film proved to be very successful, grossing $777,645 from 660 theaters across the country, coming in at #6 at the domestic box office and beating Disney&#x27;s &quot;Aladdin&quot;.

==Home media==
Beginning in the summer of 2001, Columbia House Television began releasing &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; on DVD in chronological order. They began that summer with the pilot and the first three episodes on a single DVD. Every six weeks, another volume of four episodes would be released on DVD in chronological order. During the summer of 2002, each DVD would contain between five and seven episodes on a single DVD. They continued to release the series very slowly and would not even begin to release any season 2 episodes until the middle of 2002. By the spring of 2003, the third season on DVD began to be released with about six episodes released every six weeks to mail-order subscribers. All these DVDs have the same features as the DVDs eventually released in the season box sets.

By the fall of 2003, season-four episodes began to be offered by mail. By the spring of 2004, season-five DVDs with about six episodes each began to be released gradually. Columbia House ended the distribution of these mail-order DVDs in the Winter of 2005. They began releasing complete season sets in the summer of 2004 every few months. They stated that Columbia House subscribers would get these episodes through mail before any box sets with the same episodes were released. Columbia House finally ended gradual subscriptions in 2005, several months before season 5 became available in retail. Columbia House then began to make season box sets available instead of these single volumes.

CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) has released all six seasons of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; on DVD in Region 1, as well as all 13 episodes of &quot;The Lucy and Desi Comedy Hour&quot; (as &quot;I Love Lucy: The Final Seasons7, 8, &amp; 9&quot;). Bonus features include rare on-set color footage and the &quot;Desilu/Westinghouse&quot; promotional film, as well as deleted scenes, original openings and interstitials (before they were altered or replaced for syndication), and on-air flubs. These DVDs had features and content identical to that of the mail-order single sets available until 2005.
In December 2013, the first high-definition release of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; was announced, with the Blu-ray edition of the first season scheduled for May 5, 2014. The Second Season Ultimate Blu-ray was released on August 4, 2015. 

On September 25, 2024, it was announced that a Blu-ray box set of the complete series would be released on November 5, 2024.

===Other releases===
* &quot;I Love Lucy&#x27;s Zany Road Trip: California Here We Come!&quot;, a compilation of 27 episodes, released by CBS/FOX Video on VHS in 1992
* &quot;&quot;I Love Lucy&quot;Season 1&quot; (9 separate discs labeled &quot;Volumes&quot;, the first volume released July 2, 2002, final volume released September 23, 2003)
* &quot;&quot;I Love Lucy&quot;Season 1&quot; (9 Volumes in a box set, released September 23, 2003)
* &quot;&quot;I Love Lucy&quot;50th Anniversary Special&quot; (1 disc, released October 1, 2002)
* &quot;&quot;I Love Lucy&quot;: The Movie and Other Great Rarities&quot; (1 disc, released April 27, 2010) (Also included as a bonus disc in the complete series set.)
* &quot;The Best of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;&quot; (2 discs: 14 episodes, released in June 2011 in conjunction with the 60th anniversary of the series and Lucille Ball&#x27;s 100th birthday; sold exclusively through Target.)

The DVD releases feature the syndicated heart opening and offer the original broadcast openings as bonus features, except the season 6 DVD allows viewers to choose whether to watch the episodes with the original opening or the syndicated opening. The TV Land openings are not on these DVDs.

Initially, the first season was offered in volumes, with four episodes per disc. After the success of releasing seasons 2, 3, and 4 in slim packs, the first season was re-released as a seven-disc set, requiring new discs to be mastered and printed to include more episodes per disc so there would be fewer discs in the set. For the complete series box set, the first season would be redone again, this time to six DVDs, retaining all bonus features. The individual volume discs for the first season are still in print but are rare for lack of shelf space and because the slim packs are more popular. In 2012, all-season sets were reissued in slipcovered clear standard-sized Amaray DVD cases, with season 1 being the six-disc version as opposed to the seven-disc version.

Episodes feature English closed captioning but only Spanish subtitles.

In Australia and the UK, the first three seasons were finally released in Region 2 &amp; Region 4 on August 3, 2010, by CBS, distributed by Paramount. Season 1 includes the pilot and all 35 Season 1 episodes in a seven-disc set. Season 2 includes all 31 Season 2 episodes in a five-disc set. Season 3 includes all 31 Season 3 episodes in a five-disc set. Season 2 and 3 are in a slimline pack. All three seasons have been restored and digitally remastered. All episodes appear in order of their original air dates, although it is stated that some episodes may be edited from their original network versions. It is unknown if the remaining seasons will be released individually. A complete-series box set titled &quot;I Love Lucy: Complete Collection&quot; was scheduled for release on April 6, 2016, and in the UK on May 30, 2016. This collection contains 34 DVDs with all six seasons of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and all 13 episodes of &quot;The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour&quot;.

In September 2018, Time Life released a DVD, &quot;Lucy: The Ultimate Collection&quot;, which collected 76 episodes of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, &quot;The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour&quot;, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, and the short-lived ABC TV series &quot;Life with Lucy&quot; (which had at the time never before been released to home media), plus a wide variety of bonus features.

A DVD collection, &quot;I Love Lucy: Colorized Collection&quot;, was released on August 13, 2019. It contains every colorized episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; aired as of its release date. On November 5, 2024, a colorized version of &quot;Lucy and the Loving Cup&quot; was first released on the &quot;I Love Lucy: The Complete Series&quot; Blu-ray Collection. This means that &quot;Paris at Last&quot;, which aired as part of the December 2019 edition of the Christmas Special after the colorized DVD collection had been released, is the only colorized episode currently not available on home media.

<text>Carol Haney (born Carolyn Haney; December 24, 1924 – May 10, 1964) was an American dancer and actress. After assisting Gene Kelly in choreographing films, Haney won a Tony Award for her role in Broadway&#x27;s &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;, while later work as a stage choreographer earned her three Tony nominations.

==Life and career==
Haney was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, to 
Norman Vincent Haney (1899-1990), a bank teller, and his Danish-born wife, Ellen ( Christensen) Haney (1900-1952). She had an older sister, Mrs. Miriam Woodcock (1922-1961). She began to dance at age five and opened a dancing school in her teens. 

After high school, Haney left her home town for Hollywood and landed bit parts in movies until she was spotted by dancer/choreographer Jack Cole, becoming his dance partner and assistant from 1946 to 1948. In 1949, Haney was hired by Gene Kelly to be his assistant choreographer on several M-G-M musical films, and she aided Kelly in some of his best work, including &quot;On the Town&quot; (1949), &quot;Summer Stock&quot; (1950), &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1951), &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952), as well as Kelly&#x27;s dream project, &quot;Invitation to the Dance&quot; (1956). 

As Kelly&#x27;s Dance Captain, Haney routinely worked with his partners and upon learning their strong points, choreographed numbers around them. Kelly attempted to elevate Haney&#x27;s film presence, most notably by wanting her for the &quot;Gotta Dance&quot; sequence in &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;. He was continually overruled by the studio, who felt Haney lacked sufficient physical appeal.

Known as the most lithe dancer in films, Haney danced with Bob Fosse in the 1953 film version of &quot;Kiss Me, Kate.&quot; When Fosse landed his first Broadway choreographing assignment, &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; (1954), he recommended that Haney be cast in a small dancing part. She impressed director George Abbott so much that Abbott combined her role with a larger part, resulting in the character of Gladys Hotchkiss, showcasing her in two specialty dance numbers &quot;Steam Heat&quot; and &quot;Hernando&#x27;s Hideaway&quot;. The role shot Haney to Broadway fame and won her a Tony Award and two Donaldson awards. The role of Gladys was lucky for Haney&#x27;s understudy, Shirley MacLaine. A month into the run of &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;, in May 1954, Haney injured her ankle during a Wednesday matinee, and MacLaine played the role. MacLaine was spotted by Hollywood producer Hal Wallis, who had come to the show to see Haney, and MacLaine got a contract that launched her film career.

After this, Haney appeared in a few shows, including the touring production &quot;Ziegfeld Follies of 1956&quot;, but developed paralyzing stage fright. She was seen on television, and she recreated her performance as Gladys in the film version of &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; (1957). She then focused her career on choreography for Broadway shows: &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; (1958, directed by Gene Kelly), &quot;Bravo Giovanni&quot; (1962), &quot;She Loves Me&quot; (1963) and &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (1964). &quot;The American Dance Machine&quot; (1978) featured her choreography from television. Haney earned three Tony Award for Best Choreography nominations: for &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;, &quot;Bravo Giovanni&quot;, and &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (posthumous). In May 1958, she appeared with Dick Van Dyke as a guest star on Polly Bergen&#x27;s short-lived NBC variety show, &quot;The Polly Bergen Show&quot;, as well as popular game shows such as &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; She demonstrated her talent as a dramatic actress in occasional stage productions such as the role of &quot;Lila&quot; in William Inge&#x27;s &quot;A Loss of Roses&quot;, opposite newcomer Warren Beatty, who, ironically, was Shirley MacLaine&#x27;s real-life brother. However, for the film version she was again passed over for a part she had originated on stage.

==Family==

Haney was married to Eugene Dorian Johnson from 1945 to 1953 and then Broadway actor and TV host Larry Blyden from 1955 to 1962, whom she choreographed in &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;. She and Blyden had two children, Joshua (1957–2000) and Ellen (b. 1960).

==Death==
Haney died in Saddle River, New Jersey in 1964, at age 39, six weeks after the opening of &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, which she choreographed (and ten years to the month after she injured her ankle and was replaced by Shirley MacLaine in &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;). The cause was pneumonia, complicated by diabetes and alcoholism.

Blyden and Haney resided in the historic Achenbach House in Saddle River, New Jersey, which they believed to be haunted by the spirit of its builder. The house was later sold to tour operator Mario Perillo and was destroyed by fire in 2004.
