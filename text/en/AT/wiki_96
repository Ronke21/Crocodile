<text>Antoine Caliste Domino Jr. (February 26, 1928 – October 24, 2017), known as Fats Domino, was an American singer-songwriter and pianist. One of the pioneers of rock and roll music, Domino sold more than 65 million records. Born in New Orleans to a French Creole family, Domino signed to Imperial Records in 1949. His first single &quot;The Fat Man&quot; is cited by some historians as the first rock and roll single and the first to sell more than 1 million copies. Domino continued to work with the song&#x27;s co-writer Dave Bartholomew, contributing his distinctive rolling piano style to Lloyd Price&#x27;s &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy&quot; (1952) and scoring a string of mainstream hits beginning with &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot; (1955). Between 1955 and 1960, he had eleven Top 10 US pop hits. By 1955, five of his records had sold more than a million copies, being certified gold.

Domino was shy and modest by nature but made a significant contribution to the rock and roll genre. Elvis Presley declared Domino a &quot;huge influence on me when I started out&quot; and when they first met in 1959, described him as &quot;the real king of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;. The Beatles were also heavily influenced by Domino.

Four of Domino&#x27;s records were named to the Grammy Hall of Fame for their significance: &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot;, &quot;Walking to New Orleans&quot; and &quot;The Fat Man&quot;. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of its first group of inductees in 1986. The Associated Press estimates that during his career, Domino &quot;sold more than 110 million records&quot;.

==Biography==
=== Early life and education ===
Antoine Domino Jr. was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, the youngest of eight children born to Antoine Caliste Domino (1879–1964) and Marie-Donatille Gros (1886–1971). The Domino family was of French Creole background, and Louisiana Creole was his first language. Like most such families, the Dominos were Catholic.

Antoine was born at home with the assistance of his grandmother, a midwife. His name was initially misspelled as Anthony on his birth certificate. His family had recently arrived in the Lower Ninth Ward from Vacherie, Louisiana. His father was a part-time violin player who worked at a racetrack.

He attended the Louis B. Macarty School, leaving to start work as a helper to an ice delivery man. Domino learned to play the piano in about 1938 from his brother-in-law, the jazz guitarist Harrison Verrett.

===Early career (1940s)===
By age 14, Domino was performing in New Orleans bars. In 1947, Billy Diamond, a New Orleans bandleader, accepted an invitation to hear the young pianist perform at a backyard barbecue. Domino played well enough that Diamond asked him to join his band, the Solid Senders, at the Hideaway Club in New Orleans, where he would earn $3 a week playing the piano. Diamond nicknamed him &quot;Fats&quot;.

===Recordings for Imperial Records (1949–1962)===
Domino was signed to the Imperial Records label in 1949 by owner Lew Chudd, to be paid royalties based on sales instead of a fee for each song. He and producer Dave Bartholomew wrote &quot;The Fat Man&quot;, a toned down version of a song about drug addicts called &quot;Junker Blues&quot;; the record had sold a million copies by 1951. Featuring a rolling piano and Domino vocalizing &quot;wah-wah&quot; over a strong backbeat, &quot;The Fat Man&quot; is widely considered the first rock-and-roll record to achieve this level of sales. In 2015, the song would enter the Grammy Hall of Fame.

Domino released a series of hit songs with Bartholomew (also the co-writer of many of the songs), the saxophonists Herbert Hardesty and Alvin &quot;Red&quot; Tyler, the bassist Billy Diamond and later Frank Fields, and the drummers Earl Palmer and Smokey Johnson. Other notable and long-standing musicians in Domino&#x27;s band were the saxophonists Reggie Houston, Lee Allen, and Fred Kemp, Domino&#x27;s trusted bandleader.

While Domino&#x27;s own recordings were done for Imperial, he sometimes sat in during that time as a session musician on recordings by other artists for other record labels. Domino&#x27;s rolling piano triplets provided the memorable instrumental introduction for Lloyd Price&#x27;s first hit, &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy&quot;, recorded for Specialty Records on March 13, 1952, at Cosimo Matassa&#x27;s J&amp;M Recording Studios in New Orleans (where Domino himself had earlier recorded &quot;The Fat Man&quot; and other songs). Dave Bartholomew was producing Price&#x27;s record, which also featured familiar Domino collaborators Hardesty, Fields and Palmer as sidemen, and he asked Domino to play the piano part, replacing the original session pianist.

Domino crossed into the pop mainstream with &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot; (mislabeled as &quot;Ain&#x27;t It a Shame&quot;) which reached the Top Ten. This was the first of his records to appear on the Billboard pop singles chart (on July 16, 1955), with the debut at number 14. A milder cover version by Pat Boone reached number 1, having received wider radio airplay in an era of racial segregation. In 1955, Domino was said to be earning $10,000 a week while touring, according to a report in Chuck Berry&#x27;s memoir. Domino eventually had 37 Top 40 singles, but none made it to number 1 on the Pop chart.

Domino&#x27;s debut album contained several of his recent hits and earlier blues tracks that had not been released as singles, and was issued on the Imperial label (catalogue number 9009) in November 1955, and was reissued as &quot;Rock and Rollin&#x27; with Fats Domino&quot;. The reissue reached number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums chart.

His 1956 recording of &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot;, a 1940 song by Vincent Rose, Al Lewis and Larry Stock (which had previously been recorded by Glenn Miller, Gene Autry, Louis Armstrong and others), reached number 2 on the Billboard Juke Box chart for two weeks and was number 1 on the R&amp;B chart for 11 weeks. It was his biggest hit, selling more than 5 million copies worldwide in 1956 and 1957. The song was subsequently recorded by Elvis Presley, Little Richard, and Led Zeppelin. Some 32 years later, the song would enter the
Grammy Hall of Fame.

Domino had further hit singles between 1956 and 1959, including &quot;When My Dreamboat Comes Home&quot; (Pop number 14), &quot;I&#x27;m Walkin&#x27;&quot; (Pop number 4), &quot;Valley of Tears&quot; (Pop number 8), &quot;It&#x27;s You I Love&quot; (Pop number 6), &quot;Whole Lotta Lovin&#x27;&quot; (Pop number 6), &quot;I Want to Walk You Home&quot; (Pop number 8), and &quot;Be My Guest&quot; (Pop number 8). In 1957, Domino maintained &quot;What they call rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll now is rhythm and blues. I&#x27;ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans&quot;.

Domino appeared in two films released in 1956: &quot;Shake, Rattle &amp; Rock!&quot; and &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot;. On December 18, 1957, his hit recording of &quot;The Big Beat&quot; was featured on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;American Bandstand&quot;.
He was also featured in a movie of the same name.

On November 2, 1956, a riot broke out at a Domino concert in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The police used tear gas to break up the unruly crowd. Domino jumped out a window to avoid the melee; he and two members of his band were slightly injured. During his career, four major riots occurred at his concerts, &quot;partly because of integration&quot;, according to his biographer Rick Coleman. &quot;But also the fact they had alcohol at these shows. So they were mixing alcohol, plus dancing, plus the races together for the first time in a lot of these places.&quot; In August 1957, he was banned from performing at Griffith Stadium in Washington, DC due to security concerns raised by city commissioner Robert McLaughlin.

In November 1957, Domino appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;; no disturbance accompanied this performance.

In the same year, the article &quot;King of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; in &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine featured Domino who said he was on the road 340 days a year, up to $2,500 per evening, and grossing over $500,000; Domino also told readers that he owned 50 suits, 100 pairs of shoes and a $1,500 diamond horseshoe stick pin.

Domino had a steady series of hits for Imperial through early 1962, including &quot;Walking to New Orleans&quot; (1960, Pop number 6), co-written by Bobby Charles, and &quot;My Girl Josephine&quot; (Pop number 14) in the same year. He toured Europe in 1962 and met the Beatles who would later cite Domino as an inspiration. After returning, he played the first of his many stands in Las Vegas.

Imperial Records was sold in early 1963, and Domino left the label. &quot;I stuck with them until they sold out,&quot; he said in 1979. In all, he recorded over 60 singles for Imperial, placing 40 songs in the top 10 on the R&amp;B chart and 11 in the top 10 on the Pop chart, twenty-seven of which were double-sided hits.

===Recordings after leaving Imperial (1963–1970s)===

Domino moved to ABC-Paramount Records in 1963. The label dictated that he record in Nashville, Tennessee, rather than New Orleans. He was assigned a new producer (Felton Jarvis) and a new arranger (Bill Justis). Domino&#x27;s long-term collaboration with the producer, arranger, and frequent co-writer Dave Bartholomew, who oversaw virtually all of his Imperial hits, was seemingly at an end. Jarvis and Justis changed the Domino sound somewhat, notably by adding the backing of a countrypolitan-style vocal chorus to most of his new recordings. He released 11 singles for ABC-Paramount, several which hit the Top 100 but just once entering the Top 40 (&quot;Red Sails in the Sunset&quot;, 1963). By the end of 1964 the British Invasion had changed the tastes of the record-buying public, and Domino&#x27;s chart run was over.

Despite the lack of chart success, Domino continued to record steadily until about 1970, leaving ABC-Paramount in mid-1965 and recording for Mercury Records, where he delivered a live album &quot;Fats Domino &#x27;65&quot; and two singles. A studio album was planned but stalled with just four tracks recorded. Dave Bartholomew&#x27;s small Broadmoor label (reuniting with Bartholomew along the way), featured many contemporary Soul infused sides and a few single releases but an album was not released overseas until 1971 to fulfill his Reprise Records contract. He shifted to that label after Broadmoor and had a Top 100 single, a cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Lady Madonna&quot;.

Domino appeared in the Monkees&#x27; television special &quot;33⅓ Revolutions per Monkee&quot; filmed in December 1968 and aired in April 1969. In 1971, he opened for Ike &amp; Tina Turner at Carnegie Hall. He continued to be popular as a performer for several decades. He made a cameo appearance in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s movie &quot;Any Which Way You Can&quot;, filmed in 1979 and released in 1980, singing the country song &quot;Whiskey Heaven&quot;, which later became a minor hit. His life and career were showcased in Joe Lauro&#x27;s 2015 documentary &quot;The Big Beat: Fats Domino and the Birth of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;.

===Later career (1980s–2005)===

In 1986, Domino was one of the first musicians to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He also received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987. Domino&#x27;s last album for a major label, &quot;Christmas Is a Special Day&quot;, was released in 1993.

Domino lived in a mansion in a predominantly working-class neighborhood in the Lower Ninth Ward, where he was a familiar sight in his bright pink Cadillac automobile. He made yearly appearances at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival and other local events.

His last tour was in Europe, for three weeks in 1995. After being ill while on tour, Domino decided he would no longer leave the New Orleans area, having a comfortable income from royalty payments and a dislike of touring and claiming he could not get any food that he liked anywhere else. In the same year, he received the Rhythm &amp; Blues Foundation&#x27;s Ray Charles Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 1998, President Bill Clinton awarded him the National Medal of Arts. Domino declined an invitation to perform at the White House.

In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked him number 25 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot; in an essay written by Dr. John.

===Domino and Hurricane Katrina===
As Hurricane Katrina approached New Orleans in August 2005, Domino chose to stay at home with his family, partly because his wife, Rosemary, was in poor health. His house was in an area that was heavily flooded.

Domino was rumored to have died in the hurricane, and his home was vandalized when someone spray-painted the message &quot;RIP Fats. You will be missed&quot;. On September 1, the talent agent Al Embry announced that he had not heard from Domino since before the hurricane struck. Later that day, CNN reported that Domino had been rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter. Until then, even family members had not heard from him since before the storm. Embry confirmed that Domino and his family had been rescued. The family was then taken to a shelter in Baton Rouge, after which they were picked up by JaMarcus Russell, the starting quarterback of the Louisiana State University football team, and the boyfriend of Domino&#x27;s granddaughter. He let the family stay in his apartment. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that on September 2, they had left Russell&#x27;s apartment after sleeping three nights on the couch. &quot;We&#x27;ve lost everything,&quot; Domino said, according to the &quot;Post&quot;.

By January 2006, work to gut and repair Domino&#x27;s home and office had begun (see Reconstruction of New Orleans). In the meantime, the Domino family resided in Harvey, Louisiana.

President George W. Bush made a personal visit and replaced the National Medal of Arts that President Bill Clinton had previously awarded Domino. The gold records were replaced by the RIAA and Capitol Records, which owned the Imperial Records catalogue.

===Later life===
Domino was scheduled to perform at the 2006 Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival in New Orleans. However, he was suffering from anxiety and was forced to cancel the performance, but he did appear to offer the audience an on-stage greeting.

In 2006 Domino&#x27;s album &quot;Alive and Kickin&#x27;&quot; was released to benefit the Tipitina&#x27;s Foundation, which supports indigent local musicians and helps preserve the New Orleans sound. The album consists of unreleased recordings from the 1990s and received great critical acclaim.
On January 12, 2007, Domino was honored with &quot;OffBeat&quot; magazine&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award at the annual Best of the Beat Awards, held at the House of Blues in New Orleans. New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin declared the day &quot;Fats Domino Day in New Orleans&quot; and presented him with a signed declaration. Domino returned to stage on May 19, 2007, at Tipitina&#x27;s at New Orleans, performing to a full house. This was his last public performance. The concert was recorded for a 2008 TV presentation entitled &quot;Fats Domino: Walkin&#x27; Back to New Orleans&quot;. This was a fund-raising concert, featuring a number of artists. Domino donated his fee to the cause. Later that year, a Vanguard record was released, &quot;Goin&#x27; Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino&quot; featuring his songs as recorded by Elton John, Neil Young, Tom Petty, Robert Plant, Willie Nelson, Norah Jones, Lenny Kravitz, and Lucinda Williams. A portion of the proceeds was to be used by the Foundation to help restore Domino&#x27;s publishing office which had been damaged by the hurricane.

In September 2007, Domino was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.

In May 2009, Domino made an unexpected appearance in the audience for the Domino Effect, a concert featuring Little Richard and other artists, aimed at raising funds to help rebuild schools and playgrounds damaged by Hurricane Katrina.

In October 2012, Domino was featured in season three of the television series &quot;Treme&quot;, playing himself. On August 21, 2016, Domino was inducted into the National Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame. The ceremony was held in Detroit, Michigan. The other inductees were Dionne Warwick, Cathy Hughes, Smokey Robinson, Prince, and the Supremes. He had received the Rhythm &amp; Blues Foundation&#x27;s Ray Charles Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. His song &quot;The Fat Man&quot; entered the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2015.

===Death===
Domino died on October 24, 2017, at his home in Harvey, Louisiana, at the age of 89, from natural causes, according to the coroner&#x27;s office.

==Influence and legacy==
Domino was one of the biggest stars of rock and roll in the 1950s, but he was not convinced that this was a new genre. In 1957, Domino said: &quot;What they call rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll now is rhythm and blues. I&#x27;ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans&quot;. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;this is a valid statement ... all Fifties rockers, black and white, country born and city bred, were fundamentally influenced by R&amp;B, the black popular music of the late Forties and early Fifties&quot;.

He was among the first R&amp;B artists to gain popularity with white audiences. His biographer Rick Coleman argues that Domino&#x27;s records and tours with rock and roll shows in that decade, bringing together Black and White youths in a shared appreciation of his music, was a factor in the breakdown of racial segregation in the United States. Domino himself did not define his work as rock and roll, saying, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t anything but the same rhythm and blues I&#x27;d been playin&#x27; down in New Orleans.&quot;

Both John Lennon and Paul McCartney recorded Domino songs. According to some reports, McCartney wrote the Beatles song &quot;Lady Madonna&quot; in emulation of Domino&#x27;s style, combining it with a nod to Humphrey Lyttelton&#x27;s 1956 hit &quot;Bad Penny Blues&quot;. Domino recorded his own version of &quot;Lady Madonna&quot; in 1968, which became his final single to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. That recording, as well as covers of two other songs by the Beatles, appeared on his Reprise album &quot;Fats Is Back&quot;, produced by Richard Perry and with several hits recorded by a band that included the New Orleans pianist James Booker. McCartney later recorded &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m in Love Again&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be a Wheel Someday&quot; for his 1988 album &quot;CHOBA B CCCP&quot;.

Domino was present in the audience of 2,200 people at Elvis Presley&#x27;s first concert at the Las Vegas Hilton on July 31, 1969. At a press conference after the show, when a journalist referred to Presley as &quot;The King&quot;, Presley gestured toward Domino, who was taking in the scene. &quot;No,&quot; Presley said, &quot;that&#x27;s the real king of rock and roll.&quot; Presley subsequently commented, &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll was here a long time before I came along. Let&#x27;s face it: I can&#x27;t sing like Fats Domino can. I know that.&quot; He added that Domino was &quot;a huge influence on me when I started out&quot;.

About a photograph taken of him and Presley together, Domino said, &quot;Elvis told me he flopped the first time he came to Las Vegas. I loved his music. He could sing anything ... I&#x27;m glad we took this picture.&quot;

Domino received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987.

In 1994, the artists Paul Harrington and Charlie McGettigan won the Eurovision Song Contest for Ireland with the song &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Kids&quot;. The songwriter, Brendan Graham, thought of the title whilst attending one of Domino&#x27;s concerts at the Dublin National Stadium in 1991, and thanked Domino whilst reminiscing about receiving his Eurovision trophy, at the Sugar Club, Dublin, in 2014.

John Lennon covered Domino&#x27;s composition &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot; on his 1975 album &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, his tribute to the musicians who had influenced him.

American band Cheap Trick recorded &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot; on their 1978 live album &quot;Cheap Trick at Budokan&quot; and released it as the second single from the album. It reached 35 of the Billboard Hot 100. Reportedly, this was Domino&#x27;s favorite cover. It remains a staple of their live performances, including at their 25th Anniversary concert (which was recorded as the album and DVD &quot;Silver&quot;) and at their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016.

The music of Fats Domino became popular in Jamaica, where New Orleans radio stations could sometimes be heard, and has been cited as a seminal influence on what would later emerge as ska and reggae. The Jamaican reggae artist Yellowman covered many songs by Domino, including &quot;Be My Guest&quot; and &quot;Blueberry Hill.&quot;

Jah Wobble, a post-punk bassist best known for his work with John Lydon, released a solo recording of &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot;.

The Jamaican ska band Justin Hinds and the Dominoes, formed in the 1960s, was named after Domino, Hinds&#x27;s favorite singer.

In 2007, various artists came together for a tribute to Domino, recording a live session containing only his songs. Musicians performing on the album, &quot;Goin&#x27; Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino&quot;, included Paul McCartney, Norah Jones, Willie Nelson, Neil Young, and Elton John.

According to Richie Unterberger, writing for AllMusic, Domino was one of the most consistent artists of early rock music, the best-selling African-American rock-and-roll star of the 1950s, and the most popular singer of the &quot;classic&quot; New Orleans rhythm and blues style. His million-selling debut single, &quot;The Fat Man&quot; (1949), is one of many that have been cited as the first rock and roll record. Robert Christgau wrote that Domino was &quot;the most widely liked rock and roller of the &#x27;50s&quot; and remarked on his influence:

Domino&#x27;s rhythm, accentuating the offbeat, as in the song &quot;Be My Guest&quot;, was an influence on ska music.

==Personal life==
Domino was married to Rosemary Domino ( Hall) from 1947 until her death in 2008; the couple had eight children: Antoine III (1950–2015), Anatole (1954–2023), Andre (1952–1997), Antonio, Antoinette, Andrea, Anola, and Adonica.

Even after his success he continued to live in his old neighborhood, the Lower Ninth Ward, until after Hurricane Katrina, when he moved to a suburb of New Orleans.

<text>Paul Claude Marie Touvier (3 April 1915 – 17 July 1996) was a French Nazi collaborator during World War II in Occupied France. In 1994, he became the first Frenchman ever convicted of crimes against humanity, for his participation in the Holocaust under Vichy France.

== Early life ==
Paul Claude Marie Touvier was born on 3 April 1915 in Saint-Vincent-sur-Jabron, Alpes de Haute-Provence, in southeastern France. His family was devoutly Roman Catholic, lower-middle-class and extremely conservative. He was one of 11 children, and the oldest of the five boys. He served as an altar boy when he was young, and attended a seminary for a year, intending to become a priest.

Touvier&#x27;s mother, Eugenie, was an orphan who was raised by nuns. As an adult, she was very religious and went to Mass every day. She died when Touvier was a teenager. His father, François Touvier, was a tax collector in Chambéry, after having retired after serving as a career soldier for 19 years. Touvier&#x27;s father was very conservative, an admirer of the monarchist and anti-parliamentarist Charles Maurras and &quot;L&#x27;Action Française.

Paul Touvier graduated from the Institute Saint Francis de Sales in Chambéry at the age of 16. When he turned 21, his father got him a job as a clerk at the local railroad station, where he was working when World War II began. Touvier was mobilized for the war effort in 1939. After the Vichy government was created, Touvier and his family were firm supporters of its leader Philippe Pétain. Father and son joined the Vichy veterans&#x27; group when it was founded in 1941.

== War years ==

Joining the French 8th Infantry Division, Touvier fought against the German Wehrmacht until, following the bombing of Chateau-Thierry, he deserted. Touvier returned to Chambéry in 1940, which was then occupied by the Kingdom of Italy. His life took a new course after the Milice (the Vichy French militia) was established.

Touvier had become known for womanizing and for trading in the black market. Disgusted by his son&#x27;s libertine lifestyle, his devoutly Catholic father persuaded him to join the Milice, hoping that a little military discipline would &quot;make a man out of his son.&quot;

Touvier was eventually appointed head of the intelligence department in the Chambéry Milice under the direction of the Gestapo and SD, serving as a subordinate. In January 1944 he became its second regional head.

In Paris on 28 June 1944, 15 members of the Résistance, dressed as members of the Milice, assassinated Vichy France Minister for Propaganda Philippe Henriot as he slept in the Ministry building where he lived and worked. As it was suspected that the assassins were from Lyon, Touvier was ordered to conduct reprisal killings. On 30 June, Touvier found seven French Jewish prisoners already in custody, and had them executed by firing squad.

== Post liberation ==

After the liberation of France by the Allied forces, Touvier went into hiding; he escaped the summary execution suffered by many suspected collaborators during the &quot;épuration sauvage&quot;. On 10 September 1946, the government sentenced him to death &quot;in absentia&quot; for treason and collusion with the Nazis. In 1947, he was arrested for armed robbery in Paris, but escaped.

== Fugitive ==

By 1966, implementation of his death sentence was barred based on a 20-year statute of limitations. Attorneys for Touvier filed an application for a pardon. They requested that the lifetime ban on leaving the country and the confiscation of goods linked to capital punishment be lifted. In 1971, French President Georges Pompidou granted Touvier the pardon.

Pompidou&#x27;s pardon caused a public outcry. This increased when it was revealed that most of the property which Touvier claimed as his own had allegedly been seized from deported Jews.

On 3 July 1973, Georges Glaeser filed a complaint against Touvier, charging him with crimes against humanity, which had no statute of limitations. Glaeser accused Touvier of ordering the execution of seven Jewish hostages at Rillieux-la-Pape near Lyon, on 29 June 1944 in retaliation for the murder of Philippe Henriot, the Vichy Government&#x27;s Secretary of State for Information and Propaganda, which had occurred the previous evening. After being indicted, Touvier disappeared again. Years of legal maneuvering ensued through his lawyers until a warrant was issued for his arrest on 27 November 1981.

== Arrest and trial ==
On 24 May 1989, Touvier was arrested at the Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX) priory in Nice. The SSPX said at the time that Touvier had been allowed to live in the priory as &quot;an act of charity to a homeless man&quot;.

== Death ==

On 17 July 1996, Paul Touvier died of prostate cancer at the age of 81 in Fresnes Prison, near Paris. A Tridentine Requiem Mass was offered for the repose of his soul by Father Philippe Laguérie at St Nicolas du Chardonnet, the Society of St. Pius X chapel, in Paris. He was survived by his widow, Monique (died 2018), and their two children, Chantal and Pierre.

== In popular culture ==
The Irish-Canadian novelist Brian Moore&#x27;s 1995 novel, &quot;The Statement&quot;, is loosely based on Touvier&#x27;s life. It was adapted as a film, also titled &quot;The Statement&quot; (2003), directed by Norman Jewison. Michael Caine appeared as Pierre Brossard, a character inspired by Touvier.

An episode of the History Television series &quot;Nazi Hunters&quot;, first broadcast on 1 November 2010, documented the 1989 efforts of French authorities to find and arrest Touvier.

== Brel connection ==
For several years, the Belgian singer Jacques Brel worked with Touvier. Touvier met Brel by reportedly approaching him in a restaurant and saying, &quot;I am Paul Touvier, a condemned man.&quot; Brel&#x27;s wife, however, said that they knew him only as &quot;Paul Berthet&quot;, an alias which he sometimes used, based on his wife&#x27;s maiden name.

<text>The Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King (company designation S-61) is an American twin-engined anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter designed and built by Sikorsky Aircraft. A landmark design, it was one of the first ASW rotorcraft to use turboshaft engines.

The Sea King has its origins in efforts by the United States Navy to counter the growing threat of Soviet submarines during the 1950s. Accordingly, the helicopter was specifically developed to deliver a capable ASW platform; in particular, it combined the roles of &quot;hunter&quot; and &quot;killer&quot;, which had previously been carried out by two separate helicopters. The Sea King was initially designated &quot;HSS-2&quot;, which was intended to imply a level of commonality to the earlier &quot;HSS-1&quot;; it was subsequently redesignated as the &quot;SH-3A&quot; during the early 1960s.

Introduced to service in 1961, it was operated by the United States Navy as a key ASW and utility asset for several decades prior to being replaced by the non-amphibious Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk in the 1990s. In late 1961 and early 1962, a modified U.S. Navy HSS-2 Sea King was used to break the FAI 3 km, 100 km, 500 km, and 1000 km helicopter speed records. The Sea King also performed various other roles and missions such as search-and-rescue, transport, anti-shipping, medevac, plane guard, and airborne early warning operations.

The Sea King has also proved to be popular on the export market with foreign military customers, and has also been sold to civil operators as well. As of 2024, many examples of the type remain in service in nations around the world, although some major users have begun to retire the type. The Sea King has been built under license by Agusta in Italy, Mitsubishi in Japan, Canada by United Aircraft of Canada, and by Westland in the United Kingdom as the Westland Sea King. The major civil versions are the S-61L and S-61N. The S-61R was another important variant, which was the CH-3C/E Sea King, used by the U.S. Coast Guard as the HH-3F Pelican, and the Air Force&#x27;s HH-3E Jolly Green Giant; this version had a ramp at the rear among other changes.

==Development==
===Origins===
During the Cold War, the Soviet Navy built up a large and varied fleet of submarines which at one point was in excess of 200 operational submarines. The US Navy countered this threat by the improvement and development of various anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capabilities, which resulted in the development of the Sea King. During the late 1950s, the US Navy took advantage of recent aerospace advances, such as the turboshaft engine, by commissioning the development of a new large naval helicopter. Sikorsky received a request from the service to design a new turbine-powered helicopter that would be capable of performing the ASW mission. The specification included a dipping sonar, mission endurance of four hours, and the ability to support a weapons load of .
In 1957, Sikorsky was awarded a contract to produce an all-weather amphibious helicopter for the US Navy. As per the earlier specification, this new rotorcraft was to excel at ASW; specifically, it would combine the roles of hunter and killer, as these two duties had previously been carried out by two separate helicopters. It was also the first helicopter to be procured under the US Navy&#x27;s new weapon system concept, under which Sikorsky was responsible not only for the design and production of the airframe, but all major onboard systems, such as the sonar, navigational equipment, electronic devices, and support equipment. As such, the navigation suite for the rotorcraft was developed jointly by Sikorsky and the US Navy.

Key features of the emerging ASW helicopter included its amphibious hull, which enabled the rotorcraft to readily perform water landings, and its adoption of a twin-turboshaft engine arrangement that enabled it to be larger, heavier and better-equipped than had been possible with prior helicopters. The designation &quot;HSS-2&quot; was applied, allegedly to imply a level of commonality to the earlier &quot;HSS-1&quot;, should political sentiment turn against the development of an entirely new rotorcraft. A total of ten prototypes were produced to support the development program.

===Into flight===

On 11 March 1959, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight. During early 1961, a pair of prototypes were stationed on board the aircraft carrier to fulfill a demand for carrier suitability trials. These trials, which involved testing the folding mechanism of the main rotor blades and a series of takeoffs performed during winds of up to , were completed successfully in mid-1961. Shortly after the completion of suitability trials, the US Navy formally accepted delivery of the first HSS-2 rotorcraft, which was subsequently re-designated as the SH-3A, in September 1961.

In late 1961 and early 1962, a modified US Navy HSS-2 Sea King was used to break the FAI 3 km, 100 km, 500 km and 1000 km helicopter speed records. This series of flights culminated on 5 February 1962 with the HSS-2 setting an absolute helicopter speed record of . This record was broken by a modified French Sud-Aviation Super Frelon helicopter on 23 July 1963 with a speed of .

===Further developments===

The base design of the Sea King had proved sound and several aspects were judged to be potentially useful for other operators, thus Sikorsky elected to pursue the further development of the rotorcraft for other markets beyond the US Navy. One of the major variants of the Sea King to be produced was a model for civil operators, which was designated as the Sikorsky S-61L. The first operator of the S-61L was Los Angeles Airways, who introduced the type to service on 11 March 1962. Another noteworthy Sea King variant, the significant change this time being the adoption of a conventional fuselage, the Sikorsky S-61R, was also concurrently developed for transport and search and rescue (SAR) duties, this type being extensively operated by the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Coast Guard.

In US Navy service, the initial SH-3A model of the Sea King would be progressively converted into the improved SH-3D and SH-3H variants; these featured more powerful engines and improved sensors that gave the type greater operational capabilities as an ASW platform. It was also common for Sea Kings to be converted for non-ASW activities, these roles included minesweeping, combat search and rescue, and as a cargo/passenger utility transport. The aircrew on ASW-tasked Sea Kings were routinely trained to carry out these secondary roles as aircraft could often be quickly adapted to perform different missions in the face of operational needs.
The NH-3A (S-61F) was an experimental high-speed compound helicopter based on the Sea King tested in the 1960s. Later modified with a tail rotor able to rotate 90° to serve as a pusher propeller; this helicopter demonstrated &quot;Roto-Prop&quot; pusher propeller for Sikorsky&#x27;s S-66 design.
: A minesweeper version of the Sea King for the U.S. Navy was made, with nine converted from SH-3A aircraft and then called the RH-3A.

In addition to those Sea Kings that were manufactured by Sikorsky, several license agreements were enacted with other firms to produce the type. These included the Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi and the Italian aerospace company Agusta. Another licensee was the British helicopter manufacturer Westland Helicopters, which substantially redesigned the Sea King to produce various models of their own, collectively referred to as the Westland Sea King. In contrast to the US Navy&#x27;s Sea Kings, the Westland Sea King was intended for greater operational autonomy. In total, Westland produced 330 Sea Kings; outside of its British-based operators, various export customers were found for the Westland Sea King. including the Indian Naval Air Arm, the German Navy, the Royal Australian Navy, and the Royal Norwegian Air Force.

While Sikorsky opted to terminate its own Sea King production line during the 1970s, the type has had a lengthy service life. In September 2009, it was reported that nearly 600 Sea Kings were believed to still be operational.

=== Production ===
The Sea King was produced in the USA, and under license in the U.K. by Westland, Italy by Augusta, Canada by United Aircraft of Canada, and in Japan by Mitsubishi. Total production was about 1100 to 1300. The S-61 family includes the S-61L and S-61N, which are commercial models. The S-61R, which is the CH-3C/E Sea King, HH-3E Jolly Green Giant, and HH-3F Pelican. The S-61 license built by Westland had different engines and is usually called the Westland Sea King. Canadian Sea Kings were called CH-124 and license made by United Aircraft of Canada. They were made in Italy by Agusta and called AS-61 and ASH-3. In Japan, the Mitsubishi version was called the HSS-2.

==Design==
The Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King is a twin-engine medium-sized amphibious rotorcraft. Many of the features on board the Sea King represented a considerable advancement over preceding helicopters. In addition to being fully amphibious and capable of operating under all weather conditions, it is the first operational American helicopter to be able to simultaneously hunt and destroy submarines. Its twin-turboshaft powerplant layout gave the SH-3 a higher payload and greater reliability than previous anti-submarine helicopters. In the event of a single engine failing, the Sea King could continue flying on a single engine. The powerplant used on the Sea King was the General Electric T58-GE-8B, which was initially capable of generating up to each.
In normal operations, the Sea King typically would have a four-man crew on board; these being a pilot and copilot in the cockpit, and two aircrew stationed within the main cabin area. When conducting anti-submarine missions, the rear aircrew operated the aircraft&#x27;s sensors and interpreted the generated data. For search-and-rescue missions, the Sea King&#x27;s cabin could accommodate up to 22 survivors. In a medical layout, a maximum of nine stretchers plus two medical officers could be carried. In the troop transport role, up to 28 soldiers can be accommodated.

The Sea King features many design elements to support naval-orientated operations. The main rotor blades and the tail section can be folded via fully automated systems for storage on board ships. The adoption of an amphibious hull allowed a Sea King to conduct a water landing and, being completely watertight, would enable the rotorcraft to remaining floating for prolonged periods on the ocean&#x27;s surface. Deployable airbags in the aircraft&#x27;s sponsons added to the rotorcraft&#x27;s stability and buoyancy, resisting pitching and rolling. The hull design was compatible with landing on challenging terrain, including ice, snow, swamp land, and tundra. Wheels are installed in the sponsons for land operations.

The armament fitted upon a Sea King could vary considerably. For anti-submarine missions, the aircraft could carry up to four torpedoes or four depth charges. For anti-ship duties, some models were outfitted to carry one or two missiles, typically Sea Eagles or Exocets. The Sea King could also be fitted to deploy the B57 nuclear bomb. ASW equipment used on Sea Kings has included the AQS-13A/B/E dipping sonar which included specialized computers for processing sonar and sonobuoy data, various models of sonobuoys, ARR-75 Sonobuoy Receivers, and the ASQ-81 magnetic anomaly detector. The commonly fitted AKT-22 data link enabled the rapid dissemination of sonar information to other friendly elements. Some later Sea King models featured the TACNAV digital navigation system (first generation GPS) and overhauled cockpit instrumentation for night vision compatibility.

==Operational history==

During June 1961, the Sea King became operational with the US Navy as the &quot;HSS-2&quot;; at the time, it was not only the largest amphibious helicopter in the world, but was also the first all-weather rotorcraft to reach production status for the US Navy. When the unified aircraft designation system was introduced, the rotorcraft&#x27;s designation was changed to SH-3A. It was used primarily for anti-submarine warfare: the largely involved the detection and tracking of Soviet submarines. In the event of open warfare breaking out between the two powers, Sea Kings would have been used to attack these submarines with the intent to sink them.

The Sea King was able to operate from the flight decks of many of the US Navy&#x27;s vessels as well as shore bases. It could also operate from offshore platforms to extend their surveillance and strike ranges. The type was capable of conducting nighttime ASW operations, albeit these usually posed considerable difficulty for the flight crew.

The Sea King also performed various other roles and missions such as search-and-rescue, transport, anti-shipping and airborne early warning operations. Aircraft carriers would typically deploy Sea Kings to operate near the carrier as a plane guard, ready to rescue air crew who crashed during takeoff or landing. They were routinely used in a logistical capacity at sea, transferring personnel, mail, and other lighter cargoes between vessels.

The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) became a major operator of the Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King following its introduction to service in 1963. It remained Canada&#x27;s dominant maritime helicopter for over 50 years, finally being withdrawn in 2018. One notable innovation in Canadian operations, which was subsequently adopted by several other nations, was the use of a winch &#x27;hauldown&#x27; landing and securing method, referred to as a &#x27;Beartrap&#x27;. This device considerably increased the ability of Sea Kings to land in difficult conditions, such as on small flight decks or during poor weather conditions.

The Sea King was exported in large numbers to various nations, such as Brazil, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom. Several operators have kept their Sea Kings in use for more than 50 years.

During the Vietnam War, SH-3s rescued the crews of downed aircraft at sea and over land, typically being equipped with self-sealing fuel tanks, multiple machine guns and heavy armor when performing such missions. Due to the type&#x27;s greater range and the safety of having two engines, it was often used during rescue sorties into North Vietnam to retrieve downed aircrew. The Sea King was also used for medical evacuations and disaster relief efforts.

The SH-3 was the primary helicopter for retrieving crewed space capsules starting with Mercury-Atlas 7 in May 1962. &quot;Helicopter 66&quot; was the primary recovery vehicle for Apollo missions 8 and 10 to 13. In February 1971, an SH-3A, operating from the amphibious assault ship USS &quot;New Orleans&quot;, recovered Apollo 14. A specialist search and rescue variant of the SH-3, the HH-3, also performed in this capacity.

Several Sea Kings, operated by the United States Marine Corps&#x27;s HMX-1 unit, are used as the official helicopters of the President of the United States; in this capacity, the call sign &#x27;Marine One&#x27; is used by the helicopter currently occupied by the President. As of 2012, a replacement helicopter fleet for the Sea King was pending under the VXX program. In 1992, the US Justice Department sued Sikorsky over allegations of overcharged component pricing and deliberately misleading US Navy negotiators. In 1997, the Justice Department issued further accusations against Sikorsky of willful overcharging on a contract to upgrade the Navy&#x27;s Sea Kings. In 2024, the VH-3D was replaced by the VH-92 Patriot as the Marine One helicopter.

During the 1990s, the Sea King was replaced in the ASW and SAR roles by the U.S. Navy with the newer Sikorsky SH-60 Sea Hawk. However, the SH-3 continued to operate in reserve units in roles including logistical support, search and rescue, and transport. On 27 January 2006, the SH-3 was ceremonially retired at NAS Norfolk, Virginia, by Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 2 (HC-2). They have been replaced by increasingly advanced variants of the SH-60 Sea Hawk. In the early 21st century, following their drawdown in US service, there have been a number of initiatives to refurbish ex-military Sea Kings for continued operations; in addition to civil operators, nations such as Egypt and India acquired refurbished former US Sea Kings to supplement their own aging fleets.

;S-61D-3: Export version for the Brazilian Navy.
;S-61D-4: Export version for the Argentine Navy.
;S-61NR: Search and rescue version for the Argentine Air Force.
;S-61V: Company designation for the VH-3A. One built for Indonesia.

;S-61L/N:

:Civil versions of the Sea King.
;S-61R:

:The S-61R served in the United States Air Force as the CH-3C/E Sea King and the HH-3E Jolly Green Giant, and with the United States Coast Guard and the Italian Air Force as the HH-3F Sea King (more commonly referred to by the nickname &quot;Pelican&quot;).

===United Aircraft of Canada===

;CH-124: Anti-submarine warfare helicopter for the Royal Canadian Navy (41 assembled by United Aircraft of Canada).
;CH-124A: The Sea King Improvement Program (SKIP) added modernized avionics as well as improved safety features.
;CH-124B: Alternate version of the CH-124A without a dipping sonar but formerly with a MAD sensor and additional storage for deployable stores. In 2006, the five aircraft of this variant were converted to support the Standing Contingency Task Force (SCTF), and were modified with additional troop seats, and frequency agile radios. Plans to add fast-rope capability, EAPSNIPS (Engine Air Particle Separator / Snow &amp; Ice Particle Separator) did not come to fruition.
;CH-124B2: Six CH-124Bs were upgraded to the CH-124B2 standard in 1991–1992. The revised CH-124B2 retained the sonobuoy processing gear to passively detect submarines but was also fitted with a towed-array sonar to supplement the ship&#x27;s sonar. Since anti-submarine warfare is no longer a major priority within the Canadian Forces, the CH-124B2 were refitted again to become improvised troop carriers for the newly formed Standing Contingency Task Force.
;CH-124C: One CH-124 operated by the Helicopter Operational Test and Evaluation Facility located at CFB Shearwater. Used for testing new gear, and when not testing new gear, it is deployable to any Canadian Forces ship requiring a helicopter.
;CH-124U: Unofficial designation for four CH-124s that were modified for passenger/freight transport. One crashed in 1973, and the survivors were later refitted to become CH-124A&#x27;s.

<text>The IBM 7090 is a second-generation transistorized version of the earlier IBM 709 vacuum tube mainframe computer that was designed for &quot;large-scale scientific and technological applications&quot;. The 7090 is the fourth member of the IBM 700/7000 series scientific computers. The first 7090 installation was in December 1959. In 1960, a typical system sold for $2.9 million (equivalent to $ million in ) or could be rented for $63,500 a month ().

The 7090 uses a 36-bit word length, with an address space of 32,768 words (15-bit addresses). It operates with a basic memory cycle of 2.18 μs, using the IBM 7302 Core Storage core memory technology from the IBM 7030 (Stretch) project.

With a processing speed of around 100 Kflop/s, the 7090 is six times faster than the 709, and could be rented for half the price. An upgraded version, the 7094, was up to twice as fast. Both the 7090 and the 7094 were withdrawn from sale on July 14, 1969, but systems remained in service for more than a decade after. In 1961, the IBM 7094 famously employed a speech synthesis program to sing &quot;Daisy Bell&quot;, becoming something of a cultural icon.

==Development and naming==
Although the 709 was a superior machine to its predecessor, the 704, it was being built and sold at the time that transistor circuitry was supplanting vacuum tube circuits. Hence, IBM redeployed its 709 engineering group to the design of a transistorized successor. That project became called the 709-T (for &quot;transistorized&quot;), which because of the sound when spoken, quickly shifted to the nomenclature 7090 (i.e., seven - oh - ninety). Similarly, the related machines such as the 7070 and other 7000 series equipment were sometimes called by names of digit - digit - decade (e.g., seven - oh - seventy).

===IBM 7094===

An upgraded version, the IBM 7094, was first installed in September 1962. It has seven index registers, instead of three on the earlier machines. The 7151-2 Console Control Unit for the 7094 has a distinctive box on top that displays lights for the four new index registers. The 7094 introduced double-precision floating point and additional instructions, but largely maintained backward compatibility with the 7090. 

Although the 7094 has four more index registers than the 709 and 7090, at power-on time it is in &quot;multiple tag mode&quot;, compatible with the 709 and 7090, and requires a Leave Multiple Tag Mode instruction in order to enter &quot;seven index register mode&quot; and use all seven index registers. In multiple tag mode, when more than one bit is set in the tag field, the contents of the two or three selected index registers are logically ORed, not added, together, before the decrement takes place. In seven index register mode, if the three-bit tag field is not zero, it selects just one of seven index registers, however, the program can return to multiple tag mode with the instruction Enter Multiple Tag Mode, restoring 7090 compatibility.

In April 1964, the first 7094 II was installed, which had almost twice as much general speed as the 7094 due to a faster clock cycle, dual memory banks and improved overlap of instruction execution, an early instance of pipelined design.

The IBM 7094 was the first computer to fully sing a song using only synthesizers.

===IBM 7040/7044===

In 1963, IBM introduced two new, lower cost machines called the IBM 7040 and 7044. They have a 36-bit architecture based on the 7090, but with some instructions omitted or optional, and simplified input/output that allows the use of more modern, higher performance peripherals from the IBM 1400 series.

===7094/7044 Direct Coupled System===
The 7094/7044 Direct Coupled System (DCS) was initially developed by an IBM customer, the Aerospace Corporation, seeking greater cost efficiency and scheduling flexibility than IBM&#x27;s IBSYS tape operating system provided. DCS used a less expensive IBM 7044 to handle input/output (I/O) with the 7094 performing mostly computation. Aerospace developed the Direct Couple operating system, an extension to IBSYS, which was shared with other IBM customers. IBM later introduced the DCS as a product.

==Transistors and circuitry==
The 7090 used more than 50,000 germanium alloy-junction transistors and (faster) germanium diffused junction drift transistors.

The 7090 used the Standard Modular System (SMS) cards using current-mode logic some using diffused junction drift transistors.

==Instruction and data formats==
The basic instruction formats were the same as the IBM 709:

*A three-bit opcode (&quot;prefix&quot;), 15-bit &quot;decrement&quot; (D), three-bit &quot;tag&quot; (T), and 15-bit &quot;address&quot; (Y)
*A twelve-bit opcode, two-bit &quot;flag&quot; (F), four unused bits, three-bit &quot;tag&quot; (T), and 15-bit &quot;address&quot; (Y)
*Variations of the above with different allocation of bits 12-17 or different allocations of bits 18-35

The documentation of opcodes used signed octal. The flag field indicated whether to use indirect addressing or not. The decrement field often contained an immediate operand to modify the results of the operation, or was used to further define the instruction type. The tag field might describe an index register to be operated on, or be used as described below. The Y field might contain an address, an immediate operand or an opcode modifier. For instructions where the tag field indicated indexing, the operation was

;T=0
: use Y
;7090
: form the logical or of the selected index registers and subtract from Y
;7094 in multiple tag mode (power-on default)
: same as 7090
;7094 in seven index register mode
: subtract the index register from Y

If there was no F field or F is not all one bits, then the above was the &quot;effective address&quot;. Otherwise it was an &quot;indirect effective address&quot;; i.e., fetch the word at that location and treat the T and Y fields as described above.

Data formats are
*Fixed-point numbers were stored in binary sign/magnitude format.
* Single-precision floating-point numbers had a magnitude sign, an eight-bit excess-128 exponent and a 27-bit magnitude (numbers were binary, rather than the hexadecimal format introduced later for System/360)
*Double-precision floating-point numbers, introduced on the 7094, had a magnitude sign, an eight-bit excess-128 exponent, and a 54-bit magnitude. The double-precision number was stored in memory in an even-odd pair of consecutive words; the sign and exponent in the second word were ignored when the number was used as an operand.
*Alphanumeric characters were six-bit BCD, packed six to a word.

Octal notation was used in documentation and programming; console displays lights and switches were grouped into three-bit fields for easy conversion to and from octal.

==Input/output==

The 7090 series features a data channel architecture for input and output, a forerunner of modern direct memory access I/O. Up to eight data channels can be attached, with up to ten IBM 729 tape drives attached to each channel. The data channels have their own very limited set of operations called commands. These are used with tape (and later, disk) storage as well as card units and printers, and offered high performance for the time. Printing and punched card I/O, however, employed the same modified unit record equipment introduced with the 704 and was slow. It became common to use a less expensive IBM 1401 computer to read cards onto magnetic tape for transfer to the 7090/94. Output would be written onto tape and transferred to the 1401 for printing or card punching using its much faster peripherals, notably the IBM 1403 line printer.

Later IBM introduced the 7094/7044 Direct Coupled System; the 7044 handled &quot;spooling&quot; between its fast 1400-series peripherals and 1301 or 1302 disk files, and used data channel to data channel communication as the 7094&#x27;s interface to spooled data, with the 7094 
primarily performing computations. There is also a 7090/7040 DCS.

==Software==
The 7090 and 7094 machines were quite successful for their time, and had a wide
variety of software provided for them by IBM. In addition, there was a very active user community within the user organization, SHARE.

IBSYS is a &quot;heavy duty&quot; production operating system with numerous subsystem and language support options, among them FORTRAN, COBOL, SORT/MERGE, the MAP assembler, and others.

FMS, the Fortran Monitor System, was a more lightweight but still very effective system optimized for batch FORTRAN and assembler programming. The assembler provided, FAP, (FORTRAN Assembly Program), was somewhat less complete than MAP, but provided excellent capabilities for the era. FMS also incorporated a considerably enhanced derivative of the FORTRAN compiler originally written for the 704 by Backus and his team.

==Notable applications==
*The Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS), the first general purpose time-sharing operating system, developed at MIT&#x27;s Computation Center on three successive computers, an IBM 709, 7090 and 7094 with RPQs for additional features. It eventually ran on two separate 7094s, one of them at Project MAC.
*It was the first computer to sing, singing &quot;Daisy Bell&quot;.
*NASA used 7090s, and, later, 7094s to control the Mercury and Gemini space flights. Goddard Space Flight Center operated three 7094s. During the early Apollo Program, a 7094 was kept operational to run flight planning software that had not yet been ported to mission control&#x27;s newer System/360 computers. 
*Caltech/NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory had three 7094s in the Space Flight Operations Facility (SFOF, building 230), fed via tape using several 1401s, and two 7094/7044 direct-coupled systems (in buildings 125 and 156). 
*Erhard Glatzel used an IBM 7090 to assist in calculations for the design of the Carl Zeiss Planar 50mm f/0.7 lens commissioned by NASA. This lens was also used by Stanley Kubrick to shoot candlelit scenes in Barry Lyndon. 
*An IBM 7090 was installed at LASL, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (Now Los Alamos National Laboratory).
*In 1961, Alexander Hurwitz used a 7090 to discover two Mersenne primes, with 1,281 and 1,332 digits—the largest known prime number at the time.
*In 1961, Michael Minovitch used UCLA&#x27;s 7090 to tackle the three-body problem. His research was the scientific foundation of NASA&#x27;s Planetary Grand Tour project.
*On February 13, 1961, an IBM 7090 was installed at the Woomera Long Range Weapons Establishment in Southern Australia.
*In 1962, a pair of 7090s in Briarcliff Manor, New York, were the basis for the original version of the SABRE airlines reservation system introduced by American Airlines.
*The composer Iannis Xenakis wrote his piece &quot;Atrées&quot; using an IBM 7090 at Place Vendôme, Paris.
*In 1962, Daniel Shanks and John Wrench used an IBM 7090 to compute the first 100,000 digits of .
*In 1963, three 7090 systems were imported into and installed in Japan, one each at Mitsubishi Nuclear Power Co. (whose DP division later merged with Mitsubishi Research Institute, Inc.), IBM Japan&#x27;s data center in Tokyo, and Toshiba in Kawasaki. They were mainly used for scientific computing.
*In 1964, an early version of TRACE, a high-precision orbit determination and orbit propagation program, was used on an IBM 7090 computer.
*Operation Match, the first computer dating service in the U.S., begun in 1965, used a 7090 at the Avco service bureau in Wilmington, Massachusetts.
*In 1967, Roger N. Shepard adapted M.V. Mathews&#x27; algorithm using an IBM 7090 to synthesize Shepard tones.
*American composer Gerald Strang used the 7090/7094 for his series of works under the title &quot;Compusition&quot;, composed between 1969 and 1972 at Bell Labs.
*The US Air Force retired its last 7090s in service from the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (&quot;BMEWS&quot;) in the 1980s after almost 30 years of use. 7090 serial number 1 and serial number 3 were installed at Thule Air Base in Greenland for this application.
*The US Navy continued to use a 7094 at Pacific Missile Test Center, Point Mugu, California through much of the 1980s, although a &quot;retirement&quot; ceremony was held in July 1982. Not all of the applications had been to its a dual-processor CDC Cyber 175.

=== In the media ===

* A 7090/1401 installation is featured in the motion picture &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, with the 1403 printer playing a pivotal role in the plot
* An IBM 7090 is featured in the 2016 American biographical film &quot;Hidden Figures.&quot;
* IBM 7094 specs are visible scrolling on a screen in the 1997 film &quot;Event Horizon&quot;.

<doc id="147336" wikidata="Q2630239" url="?curid=147336" title="Hants County, Nova Scotia">
<text>Hants County is a historical county and census division of Nova Scotia, Canada. Local government is provided by the West Hants Regional Municipality, and the Municipality of the District of East Hants. 

==History==
=== Formation ===
The county of Hants was established June 17, 1781, on territory taken from Kings County that consisted of the townships of Windsor, Falmouth and Newport. The name Hants is a long-standing abbreviation for the English county of Hampshire, from the Old English name &quot;Hantescire&quot;. In 1861, Hants County was divided for court sessional purposes into two districts named East Hants and West Hants. In 1879, the two districts were incorporated as district municipalities. In 2020, the Town of Windsor amalgamated with the District of West Hants to become the West Hants Regional Municipality.

=== 18th century - origins ===
====Miꞌkmaq====

The Miꞌkmaq are the indigenous peoples who lived on these lands for centuries. In the course of their historical relationship with the Acadians, many Miꞌkmaq became Catholic and therefore played an active role in the Acadian resistance to the Protestant British annexation of Hants County. They were clearly supporters of Abbe LeLoutre&#x27;s work in protecting Acadian and Miꞌkmaq and ultimately Catholic interests in the region. Within Hants County, they fought in the Battle at St. Croix on the St. Croix River.

There is a long history of missionary work in Hants County, such as the work of Silas Tertius Rand&#x27;s work on Glooscap First Nation near Hantsport. There are still Miꞌkmaq communities in Hants County such as Indian Brook 14 (the home of the famous activist Anna Mae Aquash) and Shubenacadie 13. Shubenacadie is the oldest community in Hants County. There is a significant monument in the middle of the reserve to Major Jean-Baptiste Cope, the signatory to the peace Treaty of 1752 with the British, which was recently upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada (1985).

==== Acadians ====

The first Acadians to settle in present-day Hants County (known as Pisiguit) established farms at (present day Falmouth) in the early 1680s, as the 1686 census shows a number of families on well established farms utilizing dyked pastures. More Acadian villages soon followed spreading along the shores of the Piziquid and St. Croix rivers. One of these was at present day Windsor. With an expanding population the region by 1722 was split into two parishes (see Pisiquit). The l&#x27;Assomption parish church was situated on a hill overlooking the confluence of the Pisiquit and Saint Croix rivers where in 1750 it was pulled down by the Acadians under orders from the British to make way for Fort Edward. By the early 1700s Acadians migrated all along the shore of Hants County to the Shubenacadie River. One of the most prominent Acadians from this area was Noël Doiron who is the namesake of the community of Noel. With the founding of both Halifax (1749) and Fort Edward, there was an Acadian Exodus that involved an emigration of most of the Acadians from the Municipality of East Hants (1750) and from West Hants (Pisiguit) as well. They left British Nova Scotia for French occupied Prince Edward Island. During the 1755 Expulsion of the Acadians the majority of those Acadians remaining were deported to various locations along the eastern seaboard of the Thirteen Colonies, most notably New England and Maryland. The Expulsion of the Acadians from Hants County began at exactly the same time as it happened at Grand-Pré, with the Acadian men being imprisoned within the walls of Fort Edward. Fort Edward was one of four British forts in Acadia to imprison Acadians throughout the nine years of the expulsion.

==== New England Planters ====

After the Acadians were removed from the area of present-day Hants County, New England Planters began to arrive and settle the vacated lands (1760). They formed the townships of Windsor, Falmouth and Newport. Many arrived from Rhode Island. One of the Planters of note during this period was Henry Alline who led the New Light revival of the Great Awakening in the region. Alline&#x27;s movement had a significant impact on the stance the New Englander Planters took with respect to the troubles building in the colonies to the west, between their British masters, and brethren who remained in New England, that led to the Revolutionary War. Alline&#x27;s Newlight congregations were the progenitors of the Baptist movement in Canada.

==== Ulster Irish ====
The next wave of immigration to Hants County was the Ulster Scots people who settled all along the Cobequid shore such as the O&#x27;Briens in Noel (1771) and the Putnams in Maitland.

==== American Loyalists ====
During the American Revolution, Fort Edward played a pivotal role defending Halifax from a possible land attack and serving as the headquarters in Atlantic Canada for 84th Regiment of Foot (Royal Highland Emigrants). After the American Revolution, the Rawdon Township and Douglas Township were created for American Loyalists (1784). The Douglas Township (Kennetcook and area) was settled by the 84th Regiment of Foot. The Rawdon Township was settled by loyalists from South Carolina whose lives had been saved in the Siege of Ninety-Six by Lord Rawdon and the 84th Regiment of Foot.

=== 19th century - shipbuilding and confederation ===

==== Plaster War ====
Windsor developed its gypsum deposits, usually selling it to American markets at Passamaquoddy Bay. Often this trade was illegal. In 1820 an effort to stop this smuggling trade resulted in the &quot;Plaster War&quot;, in which local smugglers resoundingly defeated the efforts of New Brunswick officials to bring the trade under their control.

==== Shipbuilding ====
Productive timber lands and tidal building sites made Hants County an important shipbuilding centre in the 19th century. Loyalist merchant Abraham Cunard was an early shipbuilder in the county. Cunard&#x27;s efforts were surpassed by much larger yards by the mid 19th century, including the William Dawson Lawrence shipyard in Maitland which built the &quot;William D. Lawrence&quot;, the largest wooden ship ever built in Canada, and Ezra Churchill&#x27;s in Hantsport.

====Great Hants Campaign (1869)====

The Honourable Joseph Howe was the first member of parliament for Hants County (1867). He campaigned in the county with an agenda to punish those politicians who have forced Nova Scotia to participate in the formation, and become a part of Canada without a mandate or referendum from the people. Over the next two years in office, deciding not to mobilize to join America or become a colony independent of Britain, Howe determined that Nova Scotia&#x27;s best option was to remain in Canada and to fight for &quot;better terms. While most Nova Scotians remained supportive of the Anti-Confederation Campaign during this time period, Howe ran in Hants County bi-election of 1869 to get a mandate from the people to see if they wanted him to continue to support Nova Scotia&#x27;s entry into Canada. What ensued was one of the most expensive political campaigns in Nova Scotia&#x27;s history. The whole country watched to see if Howe would be returned to Ottawa to lead Nova Scotia into Confederation on the best terms possible. Howe toured the whole county and eventually won, which eventually led to all of Nova Scotia accepting Canada.

=== 20th century ===

Hants County produced two Olympians, both of whom came from along the Noel shore (see Athletics at the 1928 Summer Olympics – Men&#x27;s marathon). Along with the great literary figure in Nova Scotia&#x27;s history, Thomas Chandler Haliburton, Hants produced Alden Nowlan, George Elliott Clarke and others. The celebrated folk artist Sidney Kelsie who later made his career in Edmonton, Alberta was born in Hants County in 1928. Folk singer Stan Rogers made the community of Rawdon famous by writing the song &quot;The Rawdon Hills&quot;.

==Natural resources: wood, fish, gypsum, barite, oil and gold==
The wood in the county was both used to build the many wooden ships, but it was also used as an export resource on the wooden ships. For this purpose, the Midland Railway was also built through the County (1901), connecting Windsor and Truro.

The county is noted for very large deposits of gypsum, some of which was at one time shipped from Walton. The world&#x27;s largest open pit gypsum mine is located in Milford, East Hants and currently produces approximately 8,000 tons of gypsum daily. George Elliot Clarke&#x27;s poem, &quot;West Hants County&quot;, tells of the difficult condition of black workers in the gypsum mines.

Barite was also an extremely important ore to Hants County. The largest barite mine in the world was in Walton and that; combined with the gypsum and lumbering, made Walton the second busiest port in Nova Scotia in the 1950s. The mine produced in total 4.5 million tonnes of barite, between 1941 and 1978. Silver, lead, zinc and copper were also found in the same mine and over 360,000 tonnes were mined. It is estimated that there are still about 1 million tonnes of barite left in the deposit.
Gold was mined at Renfrew, near Nine Mile River, The village was the home of one of the largest gold mines in the province. There were other gold mines in the community of Rawdon Gold Mines. There is currently oil exploration in and around Kennetcook.

<doc id="147337" wikidata="Q6636278" url="?curid=147337" title="List of relativistic equations">
<text>Following is a list of the frequently occurring equations in the theory of special relativity.

== Postulates of Special Relativity ==

To derive the equations of special relativity, one must start with two other 

#The laws of physics are invariant under transformations between inertial frames. In other words, the laws of physics will be the same whether you are testing them in a frame &#x27;at rest&#x27;, or a frame moving with a constant velocity relative to the &#x27;rest&#x27; frame.
#The speed of light in a perfect classical vacuum (formula_1) is measured to be the same by all observers in inertial frames and is, moreover, finite but nonzero. This speed acts as a supremum for the speed of local transmission of information in the universe.

In this context, &quot;speed of light&quot; really refers to the speed supremum of information transmission or of the movement of ordinary (nonnegative mass) matter, locally, as in a classical vacuum. Thus, a more accurate description would refer to formula_1 rather than the speed of light per se. However, light and other massless particles do theoretically travel at formula_1 under vacuum conditions and experiment has nonfalsified this notion with fairly high precision. Regardless of whether light itself does travel at formula_1, though formula_1 does act as such a supremum, and that is the assumption which matters for Relativity.

From these two postulates, all of special relativity follows.

In the following, the relative velocity &quot;v&quot; between two inertial frames is restricted fully to the &quot;x&quot;-direction, of a Cartesian coordinate system.

==Kinematics==

===Lorentz transformation===

The following notations are used very often in special relativity:

;Lorentz factor

:formula_6

where formula_7 and &quot;v&quot; is the relative velocity between two inertial frames.

For two frames at rest, γ = 1, and increases with relative velocity between the two inertial frames. As the relative velocity approaches the speed of light, γ → ∞.

;Time dilation (different times &quot;t&quot; and &quot;t&quot;&#x27; at the same position &quot;x&quot; in same inertial frame)

:formula_8

In this example the time measured in the frame on the vehicle, &quot;t&quot;, is known as the proper time. The proper time between two events - such as the event of light being emitted on the vehicle and the event of light being received on the vehicle - is the time between the two events in a frame where the events occur at the same location. So, above, the emission and reception of the light both took place in the vehicle&#x27;s frame, making the time that an observer in the vehicle&#x27;s frame would measure the proper time.

;Length contraction (different positions &quot;x&quot; and &quot;x&quot;&#x27; at the same instant &quot;t&quot; in the same inertial frame)

:formula_9

This is the formula for length contraction. As there existed a proper time for time dilation, there exists a proper length for length contraction, which in this case is &quot;&quot;. The proper length of an object is the length of the object in the frame in which the object is at rest. Also, this contraction only affects the dimensions of the object which are parallel to the relative velocity between the object and observer. Thus, lengths perpendicular to the direction of motion are unaffected by length contraction.

;Lorentz transformation

:formula_10
:formula_11
:formula_12
:formula_13

;Velocity addition

:formula_14

:formula_15

:formula_16

== The metric and four-vectors ==

In what follows, bold sans serif is used for 4-vectors while normal bold roman is used for ordinary 3-vectors.

;Inner product (i.e. notion of length):

:formula_17

where formula_18 is known as the metric tensor. In special relativity, the metric tensor is the Minkowski metric:

:formula_19

;Space-time interval

:formula_20

In the above, &quot;ds&quot;2 is known as the spacetime interval. This inner product is invariant under the Lorentz transformation, that is,

:formula_21

The sign of the metric and the placement of the &quot;ct&quot;, &quot;ct&quot;&#x27;, &quot;cdt&quot;, and &quot;cdt′&quot; time-based terms can vary depending on the author&#x27;s choice. For instance, many times the time-based terms are placed first in the four-vectors, with the spatial terms following. Also, sometimes &quot;η&quot; is replaced with −&quot;η&quot;, making the spatial terms produce negative contributions to the dot product or spacetime interval, while the time term makes a positive contribution. These differences can be used in any combination, so long as the choice of standards is followed completely throughout the computations performed.

===Lorentz transforms===

It is possible to express the above coordinate transformation via a matrix. To simplify things, it can be best to replace &quot;t&quot;, &quot;t′&quot;, &quot;dt&quot;, and &quot;dt′&quot; with &quot;ct&quot;, &quot;ct&quot;&#x27;, &quot;cdt&quot;, and &quot;cdt′&quot;, which has the dimensions of distance. So:

:formula_22
:formula_11
:formula_12
:formula_25

then in matrix form:

:formula_26

The vectors in the above transformation equation are known as four-vectors, in this case they are specifically the position four-vectors. In general, in special relativity, four-vectors can be transformed from one reference frame to another as follows:

:formula_27

In the above, formula_28 and formula_29 are the four-vector and the transformed four-vector, respectively, and Λ is the transformation matrix, which, for a given transformation is the same for all four-vectors one might want to transform. So formula_28 can be a four-vector representing position, velocity, or momentum, and the same Λ can be used when transforming between the same two frames. The most general Lorentz transformation includes boosts and rotations; the components are complicated and the transformation requires spinors.

===4-vectors and frame-invariant results===

Invariance and unification of physical quantities both arise from four-vectors. The inner product of a 4-vector with itself is equal to a scalar (by definition of the inner product), and since the 4-vectors are physical quantities their magnitudes correspond to physical quantities also.

==Doppler shift==

General doppler shift:

:formula_31

Doppler shift for emitter and observer moving right towards each other (or directly away):

:formula_32

Doppler shift for emitter and observer moving in a direction perpendicular to the line connecting them:

:formula_33

<text>Ernst August Friedrich Ruska (; 25 December 1906 – 27 May 1988) was a German physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986 for his work in electron optics, including the design of the first electron microscope.

==Life and career==
Ernst Ruska was born in Heidelberg, Germany. He was educated at the Technical University of Munich from 1925 to 1927 and then entered &quot;Technische Hochschule Berlin&quot; (now Technische Universität Berlin), where he posited that microscopes using electrons, with wavelengths 1000 times shorter than those of light, could provide a more detailed picture of an object than a microscope utilizing light, in which magnification is limited by the size of the wavelengths. In 1931, he demonstrated that a magnetic coil could act as an electron lens, and used several coils in a series to build the first electron microscope in 1933.

After completing his PhD in 1933, Ruska continued to work in the field of electron optics, first at Fernseh AG in Berlin-Zehlendorf, and then from 1937 at Siemens-Reiniger-Werke AG. At Siemens, he was involved in developing the first commercially produced electron microscope in 1939. As well as developing the technology of electron microscopy while at Siemens, Ruska also worked at other scientific institutions, and encouraged Siemens to set up a laboratory for visiting researchers, which was initially headed by Ruska&#x27;s brother Helmut, a medical doctor who developed the use of the electron microscope for medical and biological applications.

After leaving Siemens in 1955, Ruska served as director of the Institute for Electron Microscopy of the Fritz Haber Institute until 1974. Concurrently, he served at the institute and as professor at Technische Universität Berlin from 1957 until his retirement in 1974.

In 1960 he won the Lasker Award. In 1986, he was awarded half of the Nobel Prize in Physics for his many achievements in electron optics; Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer won a quarter each for their design of the scanning tunneling microscope. He died in West Berlin in 1988.

Asteroid 1178 Irmela, discovered by Max Wolf, is named after Ruska&#x27;s wife Irmela, who was Wolf&#x27;s niece.

<text>A bog or bogland is a wetland that accumulates peat as a deposit of dead plant materials often mosses, typically sphagnum moss. It is one of the four main types of wetlands. Other names for bogs include mire, mosses, quagmire, and muskeg; alkaline mires are called fens. A bayhead is another type of bog found in the forest of the Gulf Coast states in the United States. They are often covered in heath or heather shrubs rooted in the sphagnum moss and peat. The gradual accumulation of decayed plant material in a bog functions as a carbon sink.

Bogs occur where the water at the ground surface is acidic and low in nutrients. A bog usually is found at a freshwater soft spongy ground that is made up of decayed plant matter which is known as peat. They are generally found in cooler northern climates and are formed in poorly draining lake basins. In contrast to fens, they derive most of their water from precipitation rather than mineral-rich ground or surface water. Water flowing out of bogs has a characteristic brown colour, which comes from dissolved peat tannins. In general, the low fertility and cool climate result in relatively slow plant growth, but decay is even slower due to low oxygen levels in saturated bog soils. Hence, peat accumulates. Large areas of the landscape can be covered many meters deep in peat.

Bogs have distinctive assemblages of animal, fungal, and plant species, and are of high importance for biodiversity, particularly in landscapes that are otherwise settled and farmed.

==Distribution and extent==

Bogs are widely distributed in cold, temperate climes, mostly in boreal ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere. The world&#x27;s largest wetland is the peat bogs of the Western Siberian Lowlands in Russia, which cover more than a million square kilometres. Large peat bogs also occur in North America, particularly the Hudson Bay Lowland and the Mackenzie River Basin. They are less common in the Southern Hemisphere, with the largest being the Magellanic moorland, comprising some in southern South America. Sphagnum bogs were widespread in northern Europe but have often been cleared and drained for agriculture. A paper led by Graeme T. Swindles in 2019 showed that peatlands across Europe have undergone rapid drying in recent centuries owing to human impacts including drainage, peat cutting and burning.
A 2014 expedition leaving from Itanga village, Republic of the Congo, discovered a peat bog &quot;as big as England&quot; which stretches into neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo.

== Definition ==
Like all wetlands, it is difficult to rigidly define bogs for a number of reasons, including variations between bogs, the in-between nature of wetlands as an intermediate between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and varying definitions between wetland classification systems. However, there are characteristics common to all bogs that provide a broad definition:

# Peat is present, usually thicker than .
# The wetland receives most of its water and nutrients from precipitation (ombrotrophic) rather than surface or groundwater (minerotrophic).
# The wetland is nutrient-poor (oligotrophic).
# The wetland is strongly acidic (bogs near coastal areas may be less acidic due to sea spray).

Because all bogs have peat, they are a type of peatland. As a peat-producing ecosystem, they are also classified as mires, along with fens. Bogs differ from fens, in that fens receive water and nutrients from mineral-rich surface or groundwater, while bogs receive water and nutrients from precipitation. Because fens are supplied with mineral-rich water, they tend to range from slightly acidic to slightly basic, while bogs are always acidic because precipitation lacks the dissolved minerals (e.g. calcium, magnesium, carbonate) that act to buffer the natural acidity of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Geography and geology both impact the hydrology: as groundwater mineral content reflects the bedrock geology, there can be great deal of variability in some common ions (e.g. manganese, iron) while proximity to coastal areas is associated with higher sulfate and sodium concentrations.

== Ecology and protection ==
There are many highly specialized animals, fungi, and plants associated with bog habitat. Most are capable of tolerating the combination of low nutrient levels and waterlogging. Sphagnum is generally abundant, along with ericaceous shrubs. The shrubs are often evergreen, which may assist in conservation of nutrients. In drier locations, evergreen trees can occur, in which case the bog blends into the surrounding expanses of boreal evergreen forest. Sedges are one of the more common herbaceous species. Carnivorous plants such as sundews (&quot;Drosera&quot;) and pitcher plants (for example &quot;Sarracenia purpurea&quot;) have adapted to the low-nutrient conditions by using invertebrates as a nutrient source. Orchids have adapted to these conditions through the use of mycorrhizal fungi to extract nutrients. Some shrubs such as &quot;Myrica gale&quot; (bog myrtle) have root nodules in which nitrogen fixation occurs, thereby providing another supplemental source of nitrogen.

Bogs are recognized as a significant/specific habitat type by a number of governmental and conservation agencies. They can provide habitat for mammals, such as caribou, moose, and beavers, as well as for species of nesting shorebirds, such as Siberian cranes and yellowlegs. Bogs contain species of vulnerable reptilians such as the bog turtle. Bogs even have distinctive insects; English bogs give a home to a yellow fly called the hairy canary fly (&quot;Phaonia jaroschewskii&quot;), and bogs in North America are habitat for a butterfly called the bog copper (&quot;Lycaena epixanthe&quot;). In Ireland, the viviparous lizard, the only known reptile in the country, dwells in bogland.

The United Kingdom in its Biodiversity Action Plan establishes bog habitats as a priority for conservation. Russia has a large reserve system in the West Siberian Lowland. The highest protected status occurs in Zapovedniks (IUCN category IV); Gydansky and Yugansky are two prominent examples. 

Bogs are fragile ecosystems, and have been deteriorating quickly, as archaeologists and scientists have been recently finding. Bone material found in bogs has had accelerated deterioration from first analyses in the 1940s. This has been found to be from fluctuations in ground water and increase in acidity in lower areas of bogs that is affecting the rich organic material. Many of these areas have been permeated to the lowest levels with oxygen, which dries and cracks layers. There have been some temporary solutions to try and fix these issues, such as adding soil to the tops of threatened areas, yet they do not work in the long-term. Extreme weather like dry summers are likely the cause, as they lower precipitation and the groundwater table. It is speculated that these issues will only increase with a rise in global temperature and climate change. Since bogs take thousands of years to form and create the rich peat that is used as a resource, once they are gone they are extremely hard to recover. Arctic and sub-Arctic circles where many bogs are warming at 0.6 °C per decade, an amount twice as large as the global average. Because bogs and other peatlands are carbon sinks, they are releasing large amounts of greenhouse gases as they warm up. These changes have resulted in a severe decline of biodiversity and species populations of peatlands throughout Northern Europe.

==Types==

Bog habitats may develop in various situations, depending on the climate and topography.

=== By location and water source ===
Bogs may be classified on their topography, proximity to water, method of recharge, and nutrient accumulation.

====Valley bog====

These develop in gently sloping valleys or hollows. A layer of peat fills the deepest part of the valley, and a stream may run through the surface of the bog. Valley bogs may develop in relatively dry and warm climates, but because they rely on ground or surface water, they only occur on acidic substrates.

====Raised bog====

These develop from a lake or flat marshy area, over either non-acidic or acidic substrates. Over centuries there is a progression from open lake, to a marsh, to a fen (or, on acidic substrates, valley bog), to a carr, as silt or peat accumulates within the lake. Eventually, peat builds up to a level where the land surface is too flat for ground or surface water to reach the center of the wetland. This part, therefore, becomes wholly rain-fed (ombrotrophic), and the resulting acidic conditions allow the development of bog (even if the substrate is non-acidic). The bog continues to form peat, and over time a shallow dome of bog peat develops into a raised bog. The dome is typically a few meters high in the center and is often surrounded by strips of fen or other wetland vegetation at the edges or along streamsides where groundwater can percolate into the wetland.

The various types of raised bog may be divided into:
* Coastal bog
* Plateau bog
* Upland bog
* Kermi bog
* String bog
* Palsa bog
* Polygonal bog

====Blanket bog====

In cool climates with consistently high rainfall (on more than c. 235 days a year), the ground surface may remain waterlogged for much of the time, providing conditions for the development of bog vegetation. In these circumstances, bog develops as a layer &quot;blanketing&quot; much of the land, including hilltops and slopes. Although a blanket bog is more common on acidic substrates, under some conditions it may also develop on neutral or even alkaline ones, if abundant acidic rainwater predominates over the groundwater. A blanket bog can occur in drier or warmer climates, because under those conditions hilltops and sloping ground dry out too often for peat to form – in intermediate climates a blanket bog may be limited to areas which are shaded from direct sunshine. In periglacial climates a patterned form of blanket bog may occur, known as a string bog. In Europe, these mostly very thin peat layers without significant surface structures are distributed over the hills and valleys of Ireland, Scotland, England, and Norway. In North America, blanket bogs occur predominantly in Canada east of Hudson Bay. These bogs are often still under the influence of mineral soil water (groundwater). Blanket bogs do not occur north of the 65th latitude in the northern hemisphere.

====Quaking bog====
A &quot;quaking bog&quot;, &quot;schwingmoor&quot;, or &quot;swingmoor&quot; is a form of floating bog occurring in wetter parts of valley bogs and raised bogs and sometimes around the edges of acidic lakes. The bog vegetation, mostly sphagnum moss anchored by sedges (such as &quot;Carex lasiocarpa&quot;), forms a floating mat approximately half a meter thick on the surface of water or above very wet peat. White spruce (&quot;Picea glauca&quot;) may grow in this bog regime. Walking on the surface causes it to move – larger movements may cause visible ripples on the surface, or they may even make trees sway. The bog mat may eventually spread across the water surface to cover bays or even entire small lakes. Bogs at the edges of lakes may become detached and form floating islands.

====Cataract bog====
A cataract bog is a rare ecological community formed where a permanent stream flows over a granite outcropping. The sheeting of water keeps the edges of the rock wet without eroding the soil, but in this precarious location, no tree or large shrub can maintain a roothold. The result is a narrow, permanently wet habitat.

==Uses==

===Industrial uses===

After drying, peat is used as a fuel, and it has been used that way for centuries. More than 20% of home heat in Ireland comes from peat, and it is also used for fuel in Finland, Scotland, Germany, and Russia. Russia is the leading exporter of peat for fuel, at more than 90 million metric tons per year. Ireland&#x27;s &quot;Bord na Móna&quot; (&quot;peat board&quot;) was one of the first companies to mechanically harvest peat, which is being phased out.

The other major use of dried peat is as a soil amendment (sold as &quot;moss peat&quot; or &quot;sphagnum peat&quot;) to increase the soil&#x27;s capacity to retain moisture and enrich the soil. It is also used as a mulch. Some distilleries, notably in the Islay whisky-producing region, use the smoke from peat fires to dry the barley used in making Scotch whisky.

Once the peat has been extracted it can be difficult to restore the wetland, since peat accumulation is a slow process. More than 90% of the bogs in England have been damaged or destroyed. In 2011 plans for the elimination of peat in gardening products were announced by the UK government.

===Other uses===
The peat in bogs is an important place for the storage of carbon. If the peat decays, carbon dioxide would be released to the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Undisturbed, bogs function as a carbon sink. As one example, the peatlands of the former Soviet Union were calculated to be removing 52 Tg of carbon per year from the atmosphere. Therefore, the rewetting of drained peatlands may be one of the most cost-effective ways to mitigate climate change.

Peat bogs are also important in storing fresh water, particularly in the headwaters of large rivers. Even the enormous Yangtze River arises in the Ruoergai peatland near its headwaters in Tibet.

Blueberries, cranberries, cloudberries, huckleberries, and lingonberries are harvested from the wild in bogs. Bog oak, wood that has been partially preserved by bogs, has been used in the manufacture of furniture.

Sphagnum bogs are also used for outdoor recreation, with activities including ecotourism and hunting. For example, many popular canoe routes in northern Canada include areas of peatland. Some other activities, such as all-terrain vehicle use, are especially damaging to bogs.

==Archaeology==
The anaerobic environment and presence of tannic acids within bogs can result in the remarkable preservation of organic material. Finds of such material have been made in Slovenia, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Russia, and the United Kingdom. Some bogs have preserved bog-wood, such as ancient oak logs useful in dendrochronology. They have yielded extremely well-preserved bog bodies, with hair, organs, and skin intact, buried there thousands of years ago after apparent Germanic and Celtic human sacrifice. Excellent examples of such human specimens include the Haraldskær Woman and Tollund Man in Denmark, and Lindow man found at Lindow Common in England. The Tollund Man was so well preserved that when the body was discovered in 1950, the discoverers thought it was a recent murder victim and researchers were even able to tell the last meal that the Tollund Man ate before he died: porridge and fish. This process happens because of the low oxygen levels of bogs in combination with the high acidity. These anaerobic conditions lead to some of the best-preserved mummies and offer much archeological insight into society as far as 8,000 years back. Céide Fields in County Mayo in Ireland, a 5,000-year-old neolithic farming landscape has been found preserved under a blanket bog, complete with field walls and hut sites. One ancient artifact found in various bogs is bog butter, large masses of fat, usually in wooden containers. These are thought to have been food stores of both butter and tallow.

<doc id="147343" wikidata="Q295919" url="?curid=147343" title="Sam Cooke">
<text>Samuel Cooke (born Samuel Cook; January 22, 1931  – December 11, 1964) was an American singer and songwriter. Considered one of the most influential soul artists of all time, Cooke is commonly referred to as the &quot;King of Soul&quot; for his distinctive vocals, pioneering contributions to the genre, and significance in popular music. During his eight-year career, Cooke released 29 singles that charted in the Top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, as well as 20 singles in the Top 10 of &quot;Billboard&quot; Black Singles chart. In 1964, he was shot and killed by the manager of a motel in Los Angeles. After an inquest and investigation, the courts ruled Cooke&#x27;s death to be a justifiable homicide. His family has since questioned the circumstances of his death.
In 2015, Cooke was ranked number 28 in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;35 Greatest R&amp;B Artists of All Time&quot;.

== Early life ==

Sam Cooke was born Samuel Cook in Clarksdale, Mississippi, in 1931 (he added the &quot;e&quot; to his last name in 1957 to signify a new start to his life). He was the fifth of eight children of Rev. Charles Cook, a Baptist minister in the Church of Christ (Holiness), and the former Annie Mae Carroll. One of his younger brothers, L.C. (1932–2017), later became a member of the doo-wop band Johnny Keyes and the Magnificents. Cooke was raised Baptist.

Cooke&#x27;s family moved to Chicago in 1933. There, he attended Doolittle Elementary and Wendell Phillips Academy High School, the same school that Nat King Cole had attended a few years earlier. Cooke sang in the choir of his father&#x27;s church and began his career with his siblings in a group called the Singing Children when he was six years old. Cooke first became known as lead singer with the Highway Q.C.&#x27;s when he was a teenager, having joined the group at the age of 14. During this time, Cooke befriended fellow gospel singer and neighbor Lou Rawls, who sang in a rival gospel group.

== Career ==
=== The Soul Stirrers ===

In 1950, Cooke replaced gospel tenor R. H. Harris as lead singer of his gospel group The Soul Stirrers, who had signed with Specialty Records on behalf of the group. Their first recording under Cooke&#x27;s leadership was the song &quot;Jesus Gave Me Water&quot; in 1950. They also recorded the gospel songs &quot;Peace in the Valley&quot;, &quot;How Far Am I from Canaan?&quot;, &quot;Jesus Paid the Debt&quot; and &quot;One More River&quot;, among many others, some of which he wrote. Cooke was often credited for bringing gospel music to the attention of a younger crowd of listeners, mainly girls who would rush to the stage when the Soul Stirrers hit the stage just to get a glimpse of him.

=== Crossover pop success ===
Cooke had 30 U.S. top 40 hits between 1957 and 1964, plus three more posthumously. Major hits like &quot;You Send Me&quot;, &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come&quot;, &quot;Cupid&quot;, &quot;Chain Gang&quot;, &quot;Wonderful World&quot;, &quot;Another Saturday Night&quot;, and &quot;Twistin&#x27; the Night Away&quot; are some of his most popular songs. &quot;Twistin&#x27; the Night Away&quot; was one of Cooke&#x27;s biggest selling albums. He was also among the first modern Black performers and composers to attend to the business side of his musical career. Cooke founded both a record label and a publishing company as an extension of his careers as a singer and composer. Cooke also took an active part in the civil rights movement.
Sam Cooke&#x27;s first pop/soul single was &quot;Lovable&quot; (1956), a remake of the gospel song &quot;Wonderful&quot;. It was released under the alias &quot;Dale Cook&quot; in order not to alienate his gospel fan base; there was a considerable stigma against gospel singers performing secular music. However, it fooled no one — his unique and distinctive vocals were easily recognized. Art Rupe, head of Specialty Records, the label of the Soul Stirrers, gave his blessing for Cooke to record secular music under his real name, but he was unhappy about the type of music Cooke and producer Bumps Blackwell were making. Rupe expected Cooke&#x27;s secular music to be similar to that of another Specialty Records artist, Little Richard. When Rupe walked in on a recording session and heard Cooke singing Gershwin, he was quite upset. After an argument between Rupe and Blackwell, Cooke and Blackwell left the label.

&quot;Lovable&quot; was neither a hit nor a flop, but it indicated Cooke&#x27;s future potential. While gospel was popular, Cooke saw that its fans were mostly limited to low-income, rural parts of the country, and he sought to branch out. Cooke later admitted that he got an endorsement for a career in pop music from the least likely man, his pastor father. Cooke stated: &quot;My father told me it was not what I sang that was important, but that God gave me a voice and musical talent and the true use of His gift was to share it and make people happy.&quot; Taking the name &quot;Sam Cooke&quot;, he sought a fresh start in pop.

In 1957, Sam Cooke appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Guy Mitchell Show&quot;. That same year, he signed with Keen Records. Cooke&#x27;s first hit, &quot;You Send Me&quot;, released as the B-side of &quot;Summertime&quot;, spent six weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard R&amp;B chart. The song also had mainstream success, spending three weeks at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart. It elevated him from earning $200 a week to over $5,000 a week ().

In 1958, Cooke performed for the famed Cavalcade of Jazz concert produced by Leon Hefflin held at the Shrine Auditorium on August 3. The other headliners were Little Willie John, Ray Charles, Ernie Freeman, and Bo Rhambo. Sammy Davis Jr. was there to crown the winner of the Miss Cavalcade of Jazz beauty contest. The event featured the top four prominent disc jockeys of Los Angeles.
Cooke signed with the RCA Victor record label in January 1960, having been offered an advance of $100,000 (equivalent to$million in ) by the label&#x27;s producers Hugo &amp; Luigi. One of his first RCA Victor singles was &quot;Chain Gang&quot;, which reached No. 2 on the Billboard pop chart. It was followed by more hits, including &quot;Sad Mood&quot;, &quot;Cupid&quot;, &quot;Bring It On Home to Me&quot; (with Lou Rawls on backing vocals), &quot;Another Saturday Night&quot;, and &quot;Twistin&#x27; the Night Away&quot;.

In 1961, Cooke started his own record label, SAR Records, with J. W. Alexander and his manager, Roy Crain. The label soon included the Simms Twins, the Valentinos (who were Bobby Womack and his brothers), Mel Carter and Johnnie Taylor. Cooke then created a publishing imprint and management firm named Kags.

Like most R&amp;B artists of his time, Cooke focused on singles; in all, he had 29 top 40 hits on the pop charts and more on the R&amp;B charts. Cooke was a prolific songwriter and wrote most of the songs he recorded. Cooke also had a hand in overseeing some of the song arrangements. In spite of releasing mostly singles, he released a well-received blues-inflected LP in 1963, &quot;Night Beat&quot;, and his most critically acclaimed studio album, &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Good News&quot;, which featured five singles, in 1964.

In 1963, Cooke signed a five-year contract for Allen Klein to manage Kags Music and SAR Records, and made him his manager. Klein negotiated a five-year deal (three years plus two option years) with RCA Victor in which a holding company, Tracey, Ltd, named after Cooke&#x27;s daughter, owned by Klein and managed by J. W. Alexander, would produce and own Cooke&#x27;s recordings. RCA Victor would get exclusive distribution rights in exchange for six percent royalty payments and payments for the recording sessions. For tax reasons, Cooke would receive preferred stock in Tracey instead of an initial cash advance of $100,000. He would receive cash advances of $100,000 for the next two years, followed by an additional $75,000 for each of the two option years if the deal went to term.

== Vocal ability ==
Cooke is widely considered one of the greatest singers and most accomplished vocalists of all time. His incredibly pure tenor voice was big, velvety and expansive, with an instantly recognizable tone. Cooke&#x27;s pitch was remarkable, and his manner of singing was effortlessly soulful. Cooke could go as high as high C without losing purity or volume, and his upper mid-range was coated in a unique rasp. Cooke&#x27;s vocal style was very adaptable, adopting a rather classical sound on jazz and pop songs while maintaining his trademark stylistic soulful hold on R&amp;B, gospel and soul music.

Cooke&#x27;s delivery encompassed a wide range of emotions including playful expressiveness to interact with listeners, mellow somberness as a form of reflection, and (in &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come&quot;) profound soulfulness. When performing live, he would often play with notes and scales and experiment with melodies and his enunciation, while improvising entire songs. Cooke also began to perform highly charged versions of his songs later in his career.

Cooke&#x27;s vocal exploits would go on to influence many acts like Otis Redding, James Brown, Rod Stewart, Johnny Nash, Tina Turner, Wilson Pickett, Mick Jagger, Al Green, Paul McCartney, Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye, Steve Perry, and Stevie Wonder among many others.

== Personal life ==
Cooke was married twice. His first marriage was to singer-dancer Dolores Elizabeth Milligan Cooke, who took the stage name &quot;Dee Dee Mohawk&quot; in 1953; they divorced in 1958. She was killed in an auto collision in Fresno, California, in 1959. Although Cooke and Milligan were divorced, he paid for his ex-wife&#x27;s funeral expenses.

In 1958 Cooke married his second wife, Barbara Campbell (1935–2021), in Chicago. His father performed the ceremony. They had three children: Linda (b. 1953), Tracy (b. 1960), and Vincent (1961–1963), who drowned in the family swimming pool.
Cooke also fathered at least three other children out of wedlock. In 1958, a woman in Philadelphia, Connie Bolling, said Cooke was the father of her son. Cooke paid her an estimated $5,000 settlement out of court.

In November 1958, Cooke was involved in a car accident en route from St. Louis to Greenville, Mississippi. His chauffeur Edward Cunningham was killed, while Cooke, guitarist Cliff White, and singer Lou Rawls were hospitalized.

Cooke was a central part of the civil rights movement, using his influence and popularity with the White and Black populations to fight for the cause. Cooke was friends with boxer Muhammad Ali, activist Malcolm X and football player Jim Brown, who together campaigned for racial equality.

== Death ==
Cooke was shot and killed on December 11, 1964, at the Hacienda Motel at 91st and South Figueroa streets in South Central Los Angeles. Answering separate reports of a shooting and a kidnapping at the motel, police found Cooke&#x27;s body. He had sustained a gunshot wound to the chest, which was later determined to have pierced his heart.

The motel&#x27;s manager, Bertha Franklin, said she shot Cooke in self-defense. Her account was immediately disputed by Cooke&#x27;s friends, who were not there at the time of the incident. The motel&#x27;s owner, Evelyn Carr, said that she had been on the telephone with Franklin at the time of the incident. Carr said she overheard Cooke&#x27;s intrusion and the ensuing conflict and gunshot, and called the police.

The police record states that Franklin fatally shot Cooke, who had checked in earlier that evening. Franklin said Cooke had banged on the door of her office, shouting &quot;Where&#x27;s the girl?!&quot;, in reference to Elisa Boyer, a woman who had accompanied Cooke to the motel, and who had called the police that night from a telephone booth near the motel minutes before Carr had.

Franklin shouted back that there was no one in her office except herself, but an enraged Cooke did not believe her and forced his way into the office, naked except for one shoe and a sport jacket. He grabbed her, demanding again to know the woman&#x27;s whereabouts. According to Franklin, she grappled with Cooke, the two of them fell to the floor, and she then got up and ran to retrieve a gun. Franklin said that she then fired at Cooke in self-defense because she feared for her life. He was struck once in the torso. According to Franklin, Cooke exclaimed, &quot;Lady, you shot me&quot;, in a tone that expressed perplexity rather than anger, before advancing on her again. Franklin said she hit him on the head with a broomstick before Cooke finally fell to the floor and died. A coroner&#x27;s inquest was convened to investigate the incident.

Boyer told the police that she had first met Cooke earlier that night and had spent the evening in his company. Boyer said that after they left a local nightclub together, she had repeatedly requested that he take her home, but it appeared Cooke was intoxicated and drove her against her will to a place to have sex. As they sped down Harbor Freeway, Boyer noted they had passed a number of hotels and motor courts.

Cooke ended up at the Hacienda Motel, a black-owned business in south central Los Angeles. Boyer noted Cooke&#x27;s familiarity with the layout as if he had been a repeat customer. She said that once in one of the motel&#x27;s rooms, Cooke physically forced her onto the bed, and then stripped Boyer to her panties. She said she was sure he was going to rape her. Cooke allowed her to use the bathroom, from which she attempted an escape but found that the window was firmly shut. According to Boyer, she returned to the main room, where Cooke continued to molest her. When he went to use the bathroom, Boyer quickly grabbed her clothes and ran from the room. She said that in her haste, she had also scooped up most of Cooke&#x27;s clothing by mistake.

Boyer said she ran first to the manager&#x27;s office and knocked on the door seeking help. However, she said that the manager took too long to respond, so, fearing Cooke would soon be coming after her, she fled from the motel before the manager opened the door. Boyer said she then put her clothes back on, hid Cooke&#x27;s clothing, went to a telephone booth, and called the police.

Boyer&#x27;s account is the only one that exists of what happened between her and Cooke that night, and it has long been called into question due to reports by diners at Martoni&#x27;s Restaurant, where Cooke dined and drank earlier in the evening. These reports claimed Boyer seemed to be enjoying herself. However, critics argue that just because a woman seems to have a good time during dinner, does not mean she is obligated to have sex later on.

According to restaurant employees and friends, Cooke was carrying a large amount of money at Martoni&#x27;s. A search of Boyer&#x27;s purse by police revealed nothing except a $20 bill, and a search of Cooke&#x27;s Ferrari found a money clip with $108 (), as well as a few loose coins near the ashtray.

As Carr&#x27;s testimony corroborated Franklin&#x27;s version of events, and because both Boyer and Franklin later passed polygraph tests, the coroner&#x27;s jury ultimately accepted Franklin&#x27;s explanation and returned a verdict of justifiable homicide. With that verdict, authorities officially closed the case on Cooke&#x27;s death.

However, some of Cooke&#x27;s family and supporters have rejected Boyer&#x27;s version of events, as well as those given by Franklin and Carr. They believe that the killing took place in some manner entirely different from the three official accounts.

On the perceived lack of an investigation, Cooke&#x27;s close friend Muhammad Ali said: &quot;If Cooke had been Frank Sinatra, the Beatles or Ricky Nelson, the FBI would be investigating.&quot;

Singer Etta James viewed Cooke&#x27;s body before his funeral and questioned the accuracy of the official version of events. She wrote that the injuries she observed were well beyond the official account of Cooke having fought Franklin alone. James wrote that Cooke was so badly beaten that his head was nearly separated from his shoulders, his hands were broken and crushed, and his nose mangled.

Some have speculated that Cooke&#x27;s manager, Allen Klein, had a role in his death. Klein owned Tracey Ltd, which ultimately owned all rights to Cooke&#x27;s recordings. However, no concrete evidence supporting a criminal conspiracy has been presented.

=== Aftermath ===

The first funeral service for Cooke was held on December 18, 1964, at A. R. Leak Funeral Home in Chicago; 200,000 fans lined up for more than four city blocks to view his body.

Afterward, Cooke&#x27;s body was flown back to Los Angeles for a second service, at the Mount Sinai Baptist Church on December 19, which included a much-heralded performance of &quot;The Angels Keep Watching Over Me&quot; by Ray Charles, who stood in for a grief-stricken Bessie Griffin. Cooke was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

Two singles and an album were released in the month after Cooke&#x27;s death. One of the singles, &quot;Shake&quot;, reached the top ten of both the pop and R&amp;B charts. The B-side, &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come&quot;, is considered a classic protest song from the era of the civil rights movement. It was a Top 40 pop hit and a top 10 R&amp;B hit. The album, also titled &quot;Shake&quot;, reached the number one spot for R&amp;B albums.

Bertha Franklin said that she received numerous death threats after shooting Cooke. She left her position at the Hacienda Motel and did not publicly disclose where she had moved. After being cleared by the coroner&#x27;s jury, she sued Cooke&#x27;s estate, citing physical injuries and mental anguish suffered as a result of Cooke&#x27;s attack. Franklin&#x27;s lawsuit sought $200,000 (equivalent to$million in ) of compensatory and punitive damages.

Barbara Womack countersued Franklin on behalf of the estate, seeking $7,000 () in damages to cover Cooke&#x27;s funeral expenses. Elisa Boyer provided testimony in support of Franklin in the case. In 1967, the courts awarded Franklin $30,000 in damages ().

== Legacy ==
Cooke&#x27;s contributions to soul music contributed to the rise of Aretha Franklin, Bobby Womack, Al Green, Curtis Mayfield, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, and Billy Preston, and popularized the work of Otis Redding and James Brown. AllMusic biographer Bruce Eder wrote that Cooke was &quot;the inventor of soul music&quot;, and possessed &quot;an incredible natural singing voice and a smooth, effortless delivery that has never been surpassed.&quot;

=== Portrayals ===
Cooke was portrayed by Paul Mooney in &quot;The Buddy Holly Story&quot;, a 1978 American biographical film which tells the life story of rock musician Buddy Holly.

In the stage play &quot;One Night in Miami&quot;, first performed in 2013, Cooke was portrayed by Arinzé Kene. In the 2020 film adaptation, he is played by Leslie Odom Jr., who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal.

<text>William Franklin Holden (né Beedle Jr.; April 17, 1918 – November 12, 1981) was an American actor and one of the biggest box-office draws of the 1950s. Holden won the Academy Award for Best Actor for the film &quot;Stalag 17&quot; (1953) and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie for the television miniseries &quot;The Blue Knight&quot; (1973).

Holden starred in some of Hollywood&#x27;s most popular and critically acclaimed films, including &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950), &quot;Sabrina&quot; (1954), &quot;Picnic&quot; (1955), &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (1957), &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; (1969) and &quot;Network&quot; (1976). He was named one of the &quot;Top 10 Stars of the Year&quot; six times (1954–1958, 1961), and appeared as 25th on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of 25 greatest male stars of Classical Hollywood cinema.

==Early life and education==

Holden was born William Franklin Beedle Jr. on April 17, 1918, in O&#x27;Fallon, Illinois, son of Mary Blanche Beedle (née Ball), a schoolteacher, and her husband, William Franklin Beedle Sr., an industrial chemist. He had two younger brothers, Robert Westfield Beedle and Richard Porter Beedle. One of his father&#x27;s grandmothers, Rebecca Westfield, was born in England, while some of his mother&#x27;s ancestors settled in Virginia&#x27;s Lancaster County after emigrating from England in the 17th century.

His family moved to South Pasadena when he was three. After graduating from South Pasadena High School, Holden attended Pasadena Junior College, where he became involved in local radio plays.

==Career==
===Paramount===
Holden appeared uncredited in &quot;Prison Farm&quot; (1939) and &quot;Million Dollar Legs&quot; (1939) at Paramount.

A version of how he obtained his stage name &quot;Holden&quot; was given by George Ross of &quot;Billboard&quot; in 1939: &quot;William Holden, the lad just signed for the coveted lead in &quot;Golden Boy&quot;, used to be Bill Beadle. And here is how he obtained his new movie tag. On the Columbia lot is an assistant director and scout named Harold Winston. Not long ago, he was divorced from the actress, Gloria Holden, but carried the torch after the marital rift. Winston was one of those who discovered the &quot;Golden Boy&quot; newcomer and who renamed him—in honor of his former spouse!&quot;

===&quot;Golden Boy&quot;===
Holden&#x27;s first starring role was in &quot;Golden Boy&quot; (1939), costarring Barbara Stanwyck, in which he played a violinist-turned-boxer. The film was made for Columbia, which negotiated a sharing agreement with Paramount for Holden&#x27;s services.

Holden was still an unknown actor when he made &quot;Golden Boy&quot;, while Stanwyck was already a film star. She liked Holden and went out of her way to help him succeed, devoting her personal time to coaching and encouraging him, which made them lifelong friends. When she received her Honorary Oscar at the 1982 Academy Award ceremony, Holden had died in an accident just a few months prior. At the end of her acceptance speech, she paid him a personal tribute: &quot;I loved him very much, and I miss him. He always wished that I would get an Oscar. And so tonight, my golden boy, you got your wish&quot;.

Next he starred with George Raft and Humphrey Bogart in the Warner Bros. gangster epic &quot;Invisible Stripes&quot; (1939), billed below Raft and above Bogart.

Back at Paramount, he starred with Bonita Granville in &quot;Those Were the Days!&quot; (1940) followed by the role of George Gibbs in the film adaptation of &quot;Our Town&quot; (1940), done for Sol Lesser at United Artists.

Columbia put Holden in a Western with Jean Arthur, &quot;Arizona&quot; (1940), then at Paramount he was in a hugely popular war film, &quot;I Wanted Wings&quot; (1941) with Ray Milland and Veronica Lake.

He did another Western at Columbia, &quot;Texas&quot; (1941) with Glenn Ford, and a musical comedy at Paramount, &quot;The Fleet&#x27;s In&quot; (1942) with Eddie Bracken, Dorothy Lamour, and Betty Hutton.

He stayed at Paramount for &quot;The Remarkable Andrew&quot; (1942) with Brian Donlevy, then made &quot;Meet the Stewarts&quot; (1943) at Columbia. Paramount reunited Bracken and him in &quot;Young and Willing&quot; (1943).

===World War II===
Holden served as a second and then a first lieutenant in the United States Army Air Force during World War II, where he acted in training films for the First Motion Picture Unit, including &quot;Reconnaissance Pilot&quot; (1943).

===Post war===
Holden&#x27;s first film back from the services was &quot;Blaze of Noon&quot; (1947), an aviator picture at Paramount directed by John Farrow. He followed it with a romantic comedy, &quot;Dear Ruth&quot; (1947) and he was one of many cameos in &quot;Variety Girl&quot; (1947). RKO borrowed him for &quot;Rachel and the Stranger&quot; (1948) with Robert Mitchum and Loretta Young. Holden starred in the 20th Century Fox film &quot;Apartment for Peggy&quot; (1948). At Columbia, he starred in film noirs, &quot;The Dark Past&quot; (1948), &quot;The Man from Colorado&quot; (1949) and &quot;Father Is a Bachelor&quot; (1950). At Paramount, he did another Western, &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot; (1949). Columbia teamed him with Lucille Ball for &quot;Miss Grant Takes Richmond&quot; (1949), and the sequel to &quot;Dear Ruth&quot;, &quot;Dear Wife&quot; (1949).

===&quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;===

Holden&#x27;s career took off again in 1950 when Billy Wilder tapped him to play a down-at-heel screenwriter taken in by a faded silent film actress (Gloria Swanson) in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;. Holden earned his first Best Actor Oscar nomination for the role.

Getting the role was a lucky break for Holden, as Montgomery Clift was initially cast but backed out of his contract. Swanson later said, &quot;Bill Holden was a man I could have fallen in love with. He was perfection on and off screen.&quot; And Wilder commented &quot;Bill was a complex guy, a totally honorable friend. He was a genuine star. Every woman was in love with him.&quot; Paramount reunited him with Nancy Olson, one of his &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; costars, in &quot;Union Station&quot; (1950).

Holden had another good break when he was cast as Judy Holliday&#x27;s love interest in the big-screen adaptation of the Broadway hit &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; (1950). He made two more films with Olson: &quot;Force of Arms&quot; (1951) at Warner Bros. and &quot;Submarine Command&quot; (1951) at Paramount. Holden did a sports film at Columbia, &quot;Boots Malone&quot; (1952), then returned to Paramount for &quot;The Turning Point&quot; (1952).

===&quot;Stalag 17&quot; and peak of stardom===
Holden was reunited with Wilder in &quot;Stalag 17&quot; (1953), for which Holden won the Academy Award for Best Actor. His acceptance speech at the 26th Academy Awards was one of the shortest in Oscar history: &quot;Thank you ... thank you.&quot;

His success in &quot;Stalag 17&quot; ushered in the peak years of Holden&#x27;s stardom. He made a sex comedy with David Niven for Otto Preminger, &quot;The Moon Is Blue&quot; (1953), which was a huge hit, in part due to controversy over its content. At Paramount, he was in a comedy with Ginger Rogers that was not particularly popular, &quot;Forever Female&quot; (1953). A Western at MGM, &quot;Escape from Fort Bravo&quot; (1953) did much better, and the all-star &quot;Executive Suite&quot; (1954) was a notable success.

===&quot;Sabrina&quot;===

Holden made a third film with Wilder, &quot;Sabrina&quot; (1954), billed beneath Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart. Holden and Hepburn became romantically involved during the filming, unbeknownst to Wilder: &quot;People on the set told me later that Bill and Audrey were having an affair, and everybody knew. Well, not everybody! I didn&#x27;t know.&quot; The interactions between Bogart, Hepburn and Holden made shooting less than pleasant, as Bogart had wanted his wife, Lauren Bacall, to play Sabrina. Bogart was not especially friendly toward Hepburn, who had little Hollywood experience, while Holden&#x27;s reaction was the opposite, wrote biographer Michelangelo Capua. Holden recalls their romance: Their relationship did not last much beyond the completion of the film. Holden, who was at this point dependent on alcohol, said, &quot;I really was in love with Audrey, but she wouldn&#x27;t marry me.&quot; Rumors at the time had it that Hepburn wanted a family, but when Holden told her that he had had a vasectomy and having children was impossible, she moved on. (A few months later, Hepburn met Mel Ferrer, whom she later married and with whom she had a son Sean Hepburn Ferrer.)

He took third billing for &quot;The Country Girl&quot; (1954) with Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly, directed by George Seaton from a play by Clifford Odets. It was a big hit, as was &quot;The Bridges at Toko-Ri&quot; (1954), a Korean War drama with Kelly.

In 1954, Holden was featured on the cover of &quot;Life&quot;. On February 7, 1955, Holden appeared as a guest star on &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; as himself. The golden run at the box office continued with &quot;Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing&quot; (1955), from a bestselling novel, with Jennifer Jones, and &quot;Picnic&quot; (1955), as a drifter, in an adaptation of the William Inge play with Kim Novak. &quot;Picnic&quot; was his last film under the contract with Columbia.

A second film with Seaton did not do as well, &quot;The Proud and Profane&quot; (1956), where Holden played the role with a moustache. Neither did &quot;Toward the Unknown&quot; (1957), the one film Holden produced himself.

===&quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;===

Holden had his most widely recognized role as &quot;Commander&quot; Shears in David Lean&#x27;s &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (1957) with Alec Guinness, a huge commercial success. His deal was considered one of the best ever for an actor at the time, with him receiving 10% of the gross, which earned him over $2.5 million. He stipulated that he only receive a maximum of $50,000 of this per year ($ in dollars ).

He made another war film for a British director, &quot;The Key&quot; (1958) with Trevor Howard and Sophia Loren for director Carol Reed. He played an American Civil War military surgeon in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Horse Soldiers&quot; (1959) opposite John Wayne, which was a box-office disappointment. Columbia would not meet Holden&#x27;s asking price of $750,000 and 10% of the gross for &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961); the amount he wanted exceeded the combined salaries of stars Gregory Peck, David Niven, and Anthony Quinn.

Holden had another hit with &quot;The World of Suzie Wong &quot; (1960) with Nancy Kwan, which was shot in Hong Kong. Less popular was &quot;Satan Never Sleeps&quot; (1961), the last film of Clifton Webb and Leo McCarey; &quot;The Counterfeit Traitor&quot; (1962), his third film with Seaton; or &quot;The Lion&quot; (1962), with Trevor Howard and Capucine. The latter was shot in Africa and sparked Holden&#x27;s fascination with the continent that was to last for the rest of his life.

Holden&#x27;s films continued to struggle at the box office: &quot;Paris When It Sizzles&quot; (1964) with Hepburn was shot in 1962 but given a much delayed release; &quot;The 7th Dawn&quot; (1964) with Capucine and Susannah York, a romantic adventure set during the Malayan Emergency produced by Charles K. Feldman; &quot;Alvarez Kelly&quot; (1966), a Western; and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Brigade&quot; (1968). He was also one of many stars in Feldman&#x27;s &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967).

===&quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;===

In 1969, Holden made a comeback when he starred in director Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s graphically violent Western &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;, winning much acclaim. Also in 1969, Holden starred in director Terence Young&#x27;s family film &quot;L&#x27;Arbre de Noël&quot;, co-starring Italian actress Virna Lisi and French actor Bourvil, based on the novel of the same name by Michel Bataille. This film was originally released in the United States as &quot;The Christmas Tree&quot; and on home video as &quot;When Wolves Cry.&quot; Holden made a Western with Ryan O&#x27;Neal and Blake Edwards, &quot;Wild Rovers&quot; (1971). It was not particularly successful. Neither was &quot;The Revengers&quot; (1972), another Western.

For television roles in 1974, Holden won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his portrayal of a cynical, tough veteran LAPD street cop in the television film &quot;The Blue Knight&quot;, based upon the bestselling Joseph Wambaugh novel of the same name.

In 1973, Holden starred with Kay Lenz in a movie directed by Clint Eastwood called &quot;Breezy&quot;, which was considered a box-office flop. Also in 1974, Holden starred with Paul Newman and Steve McQueen in the critically acclaimed disaster film &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;, which became a box-office smash and one of the highest-grossing films of Holden&#x27;s career.

Two years later, he was praised for his Oscar-nominated leading performance in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s classic &quot;Network&quot; (1976), an examination of the media written by Paddy Chayefsky, playing an older version of the character type for which he had become iconic in the 1950s, only now more jaded and aware of his own mortality. Around this time he also appeared in &quot;21 Hours at Munich&quot; (1976).

===Final roles===
Holden made a fourth and final film for Wilder with &quot;Fedora&quot; (1978). He followed it with &quot;Damien - Omen II&quot; (1978) and had a cameo in &quot;Escape to Athena&quot; (1978), which co-starred his real-life love interest Stefanie Powers. Holden had a supporting role in &quot;Ashanti&quot; (1979) and was third-billed in another disaster film, &quot;When Time Ran Out...&quot; (1980), which was a flop. Holden starred in &quot;The Earthling&quot;, as a loner dying of cancer at the Australian outback and accompanying an orphan boy (Ricky Schroder). After his final film Blake Edwards&#x27; &quot;S.O.B.&quot;, with Julie Andrews, Holden declined to star in Jason Miller&#x27;s film &quot;That Championship Season&quot;.

==Personal life==

Holden was best man at the wedding of his friend Ronald Reagan to actress Nancy Davis in 1952. Although a registered Republican, he never involved himself in politics.

While in Italy in 1966, Holden killed another driver in a drunk-driving incident near Pisa. He received an eight-month suspended sentence for vehicular manslaughter.

Holden maintained a home in Switzerland and also spent much of his time working for wildlife conservation as a managing partner in an animal preserve in Africa. His Mount Kenya Safari Club in Nanyuki (founded 1959) was popular with the international jet set. On a trip to Africa, he fell in love with the wildlife and became increasingly concerned with the animal species that were beginning to decrease in population. With the help of his partners, he created the Mount Kenya Game Ranch and inspired the creation of the William Holden Wildlife Foundation.

===Marriage and relationships===
Holden had a daughter born in 1937 from his relationship with actress Eva May Hoffman.

Holden was married to actress Brenda Marshall from 1941 until their divorce in 1971. They had two sons, Peter and Scott. Holden also adopted Marshall&#x27;s daughter, Virginia Gaines, from Marshall&#x27;s previous marriage to actor Richard Gaines.

Holden met French actress Capucine in the early 1960s. The two starred in the films &quot;The Lion&quot; (1962) and &quot;The 7th Dawn&quot; (1964). They reportedly began a two-year affair, which is alleged to have ended due to Holden&#x27;s alcoholism. Capucine and Holden remained friends until his death in 1981.

In 1972, Holden began a nine-year relationship with actress Stefanie Powers and sparked her interest in animal welfare. After his death, Powers set up the William Holden Wildlife Foundation at Holden&#x27;s Mount Kenya Game Ranch.

===Death===
According to the Los Angeles County Coroner&#x27;s autopsy report, Holden bled to death in his apartment in Santa Monica, California, on November 12, 1981, after lacerating his forehead by slipping on a rug while intoxicated and hitting a bedside table. Forensic evidence recovered at the scene suggested that the actor was conscious for at least half an hour after the fall. His body was found four days later. Rumors circulated that he was suffering from lung cancer, which Holden had denied at a 1980 press conference. His death certificate makes no mention of cancer. He dictated in his will that the Neptune Society cremate him and scatter his ashes in the Pacific Ocean. In accordance with his wishes, no funeral, or memorial service, was held.

President Ronald Reagan released a statement: &quot;I have a great feeling of grief. We were close friends for many years. What do you say about a longtime friend – a sense of personal loss, a fine man. Our friendship never waned.&quot;

For his contribution to the film industry, Holden has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 1651 Vine Street. He also has a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

His death was noted by singer-songwriter Suzanne Vega, whose 1987 song &quot;Tom&#x27;s Diner&quot; evokes a sequence of events one morning in 1981. The song includes a mention of reading a newspaper article about &quot;an actor who had died while he was drinking&quot;. Vega later confirmed that this is a reference to Holden.

<text>Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash (CSN) was a folk rock supergroup comprising the American singer-songwriters David Crosby and Stephen Stills and the English-American singer-songwriter Graham Nash. When joined by the Canadian singer-songwriter Neil Young, they were known as Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young (CSNY). They are noted for their intricate vocal harmonies and lasting influence on American music and culture, their political activism and their tumultuous relationships.

CSN formed in 1968 shortly after Crosby, Stills and Nash performed together informally, discovering they harmonized well. Crosby had been asked to leave the Byrds in late 1967, Stills&#x27; band Buffalo Springfield had broken up in early 1968, and Nash left his band the Hollies in December. They signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records in early 1969. Their first album, &quot;Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash&quot; (1969) produced the Top 40 hits &quot;&quot; and &quot;Marrakesh Express&quot;. In preparation for touring, the trio added Young, Stills&#x27; former Buffalo Springfield bandmate, as a full member, along with the touring members Dallas Taylor (drums) and Greg Reeves (bass). As Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, they performed at the Woodstock festival that August.

The band&#x27;s first album with Young, &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;, reached number one on several international charts in 1970. It remains their best-selling album, selling more than eight million copies and producing the hit singles &quot;Woodstock&quot;, &quot;Teach Your Children&quot;, and &quot;Our House&quot;. The group&#x27;s second tour, which produced the live double album &quot;4 Way Street&quot; (1971), was fraught with arguments between Young and Taylor, which resulted in Taylor being replaced by John Barbata, and tensions with Stills. At the end of the tour they disbanded. The group reunited several times, sometimes with Young, and released eight studio and four live albums. CSN&#x27;s final studio album was 1999&#x27;s &quot;Looking Forward&quot;, and they remained a performing act until 2015. Crosby died in 2023.

Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997 and all three members were also inducted for their work in other groups: Crosby for the Byrds, Stills for Buffalo Springfield and Nash for the Hollies. Young was also inducted as a solo artist and as a member of Buffalo Springfield.

==History==
===CSN formation and debut album: July 1968 – May 1969===
CSN was born with members from two prominent bands and the split of a third. David Crosby played guitar, sang, and wrote songs with the Byrds; Stephen Stills had been a guitarist, keyboardist, vocalist, and songwriter in the band Buffalo Springfield (which also featured Neil Young); and Graham Nash had been a guitarist, singer, and songwriter with the Hollies.

Crosby had been sacked from the Byrds in October 1967 due to disagreements over his songwriting. At the Monterey Pop Festival, Crosby stood in for Neil Young (who quit the band before the gig) with Buffalo Springfield. By early 1968, Buffalo Springfield had disintegrated, and, after aiding in putting together the band&#x27;s final album, &quot;Last Time Around&quot;, Stills was unemployed. Following the Monterey gig, Stills and Crosby began meeting informally and jamming. The result of one encounter in Florida on Crosby&#x27;s schooner was the song &quot;Wooden Ships&quot;, composed in collaboration with another guest, Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane.

Graham Nash had known Crosby since the Byrds&#x27; UK tour of 1966. Two years later, when the Hollies relocated to California in 1968, Nash resumed his acquaintance with him. Nash met Stills at a party at Peter Tork&#x27;s house in Laurel Canyon. He was captivated by Stills &quot;banging the shit out of&quot; a piano in a &quot;Brazilian, and Latin, and boogie woogie, and rock and roll&quot; style. In July 1968, over dinner at a party at another Laurel Canyon house (the home of either Joni Mitchell or Cass Elliot—accounts by the three members differ), Nash invited Stills and Crosby to perform a Stills composition, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Cry&quot;. They did so twice, after which Nash had learned the lyrics and improvised a new harmony part on a third rendition. The vocals gelled, and the three realized that they had a very good vocal chemistry. While singing the third time, they broke out in laughter. The Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, and the Hollies had been harmony bands, with Nash later saying in a 2014 interview, &quot;We knew what we were doing,&quot; referring to the success of each of the individual bands. He continued, &quot;Whatever sound Crosby, Stills, and Nash has was born in 30 seconds. That&#x27;s how long it took us to harmonize.&quot;

Creatively frustrated with the Hollies, Nash decided to quit the band in December 1968 and flew to Los Angeles two days later. The trio traveled to London in early 1969 to rehearse for what turned out to be an unsuccessful audition with the Beatles&#x27; Apple Records. However, back in California, Ahmet Ertegun, who had been a fan of Buffalo Springfield and was disappointed by that band&#x27;s demise, signed them to Atlantic Records. From the outset, given their previous experiences, the trio decided not to be locked into a group structure. They used their surnames as identification to ensure independence and a guarantee that the band could not continue without one of them, unlike both the Byrds and the Hollies. They picked up a management team in Elliot Roberts and David Geffen, who got them signed to Atlantic and helped to gain clout for the group in the industry. Roberts kept the band focused and dealt with egos, while Geffen handled the business deals, since, in Crosby&#x27;s words, they needed a &quot;shark&quot; and Geffen was it.

The band then ran into a problem. Stills was already signed to Atlantic Records through his Buffalo Springfield contract. Crosby had been released from his Byrds deal with Columbia, as he was considered to be unimportant and too difficult to work with. Nash, however, was still signed to Epic Records through the Hollies. Ertegun cut a deal with Clive Davis to essentially trade Nash to Atlantic in exchange for Richie Furay (who was also signed to Atlantic by virtue of his membership in Buffalo Springfield) and Poco, his new band.

The trio&#x27;s first album, &quot;Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash&quot;, was released in May 1969. The eponymously titled album was a major hit in the United States, peaking at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart during a 107-week stay that spawned two Top 40 hits (&quot;&quot; [#21] and &quot;Marrakesh Express&quot; [#28]) and significant airplay on FM radio. The album ultimately earned a RIAA triple platinum certification in 1999 and quadruple platinum certification in 2001.

===CSNY: Déjà Vu to 4 Way Street, August 1969 – April 1971===
With the exceptions of drum parts (primarily performed by Dallas Taylor) and a handful of rhythm and acoustic guitar parts from Crosby and Nash, Stills (accorded the moniker &quot;Captain Many Hands&quot; by his bandmates) handled most of the instrumentation (including every lead guitar, bass and keyboard part) on the album, which left the band in need of additional personnel to be able to tour, a necessity given the debut album&#x27;s commercial impact. Retaining Taylor, the band tried initially to hire a keyboard player. Stills initially approached virtuoso multi-instrumentalist Steve Winwood, who was already occupied with the newly formed group Blind Faith. Ertegun suggested former Buffalo Springfield member Neil Young, also managed by Elliot Roberts, as a fairly obvious choice; though principally a guitarist, Young was a proficient keyboardist and could alternate on the instrument with Stills and Nash in a live context. Stills and Nash initially objected, Stills because of his history with Young in Buffalo Springfield and Nash because of his personal unfamiliarity with Young. Despite that, the trio expanded to a quartet with Young a full partner. The terms of the contract allowed Young full freedom to maintain a parallel career with his new band, Crazy Horse.

They initially completed the rhythm section with former Buffalo Springfield bassist Bruce Palmer. However, Palmer was let go due to his persistent personal problems following rehearsals at the Cafe au Go Go in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village; according to Crosby, &quot;Bruce Palmer was into another instrument and his head was not where it should have been.&quot; Teenaged Motown session bassist Greg Reeves joined in Palmer&#x27;s place at the recommendation of Rick James, a friend and former bandmate of Neil Young.

The now expanded group embarked on a four-leg, 39-date tour that ended with three European concerts in January 1970. Their first major public gig was on August 16, 1969, at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago, with Joni Mitchell as their opening act. They mentioned they were going to someplace called Woodstock the next day, but that they had no idea where it was. Their one-hour show at the Woodstock Festival in the early morning of August 18, 1969, was a baptism by fire. The crowd of industry friends looking on from offstage was intimidating and prompted Stills to say, &quot;This is the second time we&#x27;ve ever played in front of people, man. We&#x27;re scared shitless.&quot; Their appearance at the festival and in the subsequent movie &quot;Woodstock&quot;, along with recording the Joni Mitchell song memorializing Woodstock, boosted the visibility of the quartet. CSNY appeared at other prominent festivals that year. Footage from two performances from the Big Sur Folk Festival (held on the grounds of the Esalen Institute on September 13–14, 1969) appears in the movie &quot;Celebration at Big Sur&quot;. They also appeared at the violence-plagued Altamont Free Concert on December 6, 1969, alongside Santana, Jefferson Airplane, the Flying Burrito Brothers, and the headlining Rolling Stones. During Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young&#x27;s set, Stills was reported to be repeatedly stabbed in the leg by a &quot;stoned-out&quot; Hells Angel, with a sharpened bicycle spoke. At the band&#x27;s request, their performance was not included in the subsequent film &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; (1970).

Great anticipation had built for the expanded supergroup and their first album with Young, &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;, which arrived in stores in March 1970. It topped the charts during a 97-week stay in the United States and generated three hit singles, including the Stills-sung cover of Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Woodstock&quot; (#11) and both of Nash&#x27;s contributions (&quot;Teach Your Children&quot; [#16] and &quot;Our House&quot; [#30]). Certified septuple platinum by RIAA, the album&#x27;s domestic sales currently sit at over 8 million copies; as of 2017, it remains the highest-selling album of each member&#x27;s career. &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; was also the first release on the Atlantic Records SD-7200 &quot;superstar&quot; line, created by the label for its highest-profile artists; subsequent solo albums by Crosby, Stills, and Nash were the next releases in this series.

In consultation with other band members, Stills fired Reeves from the group shortly before the beginning of their second American tour in April 1970 &quot;because [he] suddenly decided he was an Apache witch doctor.&quot; He further opined that &quot;[Reeves] freaked too much on the bass and no one could keep up because [he] did not play one rhythm the same… he could play bass imaginatively, but he has to be predictable as well,&quot; while &quot;Greg also wanted to sing some of his songs on the CSN&amp;Y show, which I thought was ludicrous, only because the songs weren&#x27;t great. We&#x27;ll sing any song if it&#x27;s great, but not just because it happens to be written by our bass player.&quot; He was replaced by Calvin &quot;Fuzzy&quot; Samuels, a homeless West Indian musician recently discovered by Stills at Island Records&#x27; London studios. Shortly thereafter, Taylor (who frequently clashed with Young over the band&#x27;s tempos during the first tour and &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; sessions) was also dismissed when Young threatened to leave the group following the first performance of the tour at the Denver Coliseum on May 12, 1970. Notwithstanding these previous tensions, Taylor later asserted that his dismissal stemmed from a flirtation with Young&#x27;s first wife (Topanga Canyon restaurateur Susan Acevedo) amid renewed conflict between Stills and Young in the aftermath of Reeves&#x27; firing. Shortly thereafter, drummer John Barbata (formerly of The Turtles) was hired for the remainder of the tour and associated recordings.

A week before the Denver performance, Young and Crosby were staying at a house near San Francisco when reports of the Kent State shootings arrived, inspiring Young to write the protest song &quot;Ohio&quot;. Recorded and rush-released weeks later with the new rhythm section, it peaked at No. 14 in August 1970, providing another American Top 20 hit for the group. Their previously recorded song &quot;Teach Your Children&quot; was still climbing the chart, yet the group insisted that it be rushed to release. Crosby later stated in an interview that his callbacks &quot;how many more?&quot; in the final stages of the song was ad-libbed, bringing out his pure frustration.

As the 23-show tour progressed, the tenuous nature of the partnership was strained by Stills&#x27; alcohol and cocaine abuse, culminating in an extended solo set not countenanced by the other band members at the Fillmore East, when he was informed that Bob Dylan was in the audience. In this turbulent atmosphere, Crosby, Nash and Young decided to quit the tour during a two-night return engagement at Chicago&#x27;s Auditorium Theatre in July 1970. Singer Rita Coolidge had been romantically involved with Stills, and her leaving him for Nash has also been cited as a contributing factor behind the breakup of the band. Concert recordings from that tour assembled by Nash produced the 1971 double album &quot;4 Way Street&quot;, which also topped the charts during a 42-week stay. Although they continued to collaborate in various and largely ephemeral permutations, the four members did not come back together in earnest until their 1974 reunion tour.

===Individual activity===

Between September 1970 and May 1971, each of the quartet released high-profile solo albums: Young&#x27;s &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; in September (which peaked at No. 8 and included his first Top 40 solo hit, &quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart&quot; [#33]); Stills&#x27; eponymous debut in November; Crosby&#x27;s &quot;If I Could Only Remember My Name&quot; in February, and Nash&#x27;s &quot;Songs for Beginners&quot; in May. Although all four solo LPs placed in the Top 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, Stills&#x27; entry (including two Top 40 hits, &quot;Love the One You&#x27;re With&quot; [#14] and &quot;Sit Yourself Down&quot; [#37]) peaked the highest at No. 3. Stills was the first to release a second post-CSNY solo album, 1971&#x27;s &quot;Stephen Stills 2&quot;, which included two minor hits (&quot;Change Partners&quot; [#43]; &quot;Marianne&quot; [#42]) and peaked at No. 8. He supported this with a solo tour of major arenas (such as Madison Square Garden and the L.A. Forum) in the summer of 1971 with Dallas Taylor, Fuzzy Samuels, and the Memphis Horns. In the fall of 1971, Crosby and Nash embarked on a successful theater tour accompanied only by their acoustic guitars and a piano, as captured on the 1998 archival release &quot;Another Stoney Evening&quot;.

1972 proved to be another fruitful year for all the band members in their solo or duo efforts. Young achieved solo superstardom with the chart-topping &quot;Harvest&quot; and two Top 40 singles, the #1 hit &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; and &quot;Old Man&quot; (#31). Stills joined with former Byrd Chris Hillman to form the band Manassas, releasing a self-titled double album; although it did not generate any significant hits, counting the three CSN/CSNY records, &quot;Manassas&quot; became Stills&#x27; sixth Top Ten album in a row, peaking at No. 4 and being certified gold in the US a month after release. Nash and Young released Young&#x27;s &quot;War Song&quot; as a joint single to support George McGovern&#x27;s presidential campaign; despite their intentions, the single failed to make a serious impression. Meanwhile, Nash&#x27;s and Crosby&#x27;s touring was so successful and pleasant for them that they recorded and released their first album as a duo, &quot;Graham Nash David Crosby&quot;, which eclipsed their recent solo efforts with a Top 40 hit (Nash&#x27;s &quot;Immigration Man&quot;, #36); it peaked at No. 4 and was certified gold in the US.

The group members fared less well in 1973. Young recorded two dark albums. The first, &quot;Time Fades Away&quot;, chronicled his winter tour that followed the death of his Crazy Horse bandmate Danny Whitten from an alcohol/Valium overdose, a tour Crosby and Nash joined mid-way. A critical success despite his personal misgivings, it attained a RIAA gold certification before stalling at No. 22. The second album, &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;, inspired by the death of CSNY roadie Bruce Berry, was so dark that Reprise Records refused to release it until 1975. Although it is widely regarded as his magnum opus, it only reached No. 25. Crosby spearheaded and produced a reunion album of the original Byrds quintet which was a notable critical failure upon its release in March 1973. The most commercially successful Byrds album since 1966, it sold only marginally well by CSNY&#x27;s standards, peaking at No. 20. Stills released a second Manassas record in April 1973 and Nash recorded his second solo album &quot;Wild Tales&quot; (released in January 1974); again, neither disc sold to expectations, peaking respectively at No. 26 and No. 34. Apart from &quot;Time Fades Away&quot;, none of the CSNY-related albums in 1973 were certified gold in the US, a first for the band.

===CSNY, reconciliation and further estrangement: 1973–1976===
In June and July 1973, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young met at Young&#x27;s ranch in California and a recording studio in Hawaii for a working vacation, ostensibly to record a new album, tentatively titled &quot;Human Highway&quot;. However, the bickering that had sunk the band in 1970 quickly resumed, scattering the group again. After spontaneously reconvening for an acoustic set at a Manassas concert at San Francisco&#x27;s Winterland Ballroom in October, the quartet failed once again to commit to a reunion; however, three days later, the CSN configuration performed an acoustic set at another Manassas Winterland show. Over the next few months, Roberts finally prevailed upon the group to realize their commercial potential, culminating in Stills announcing a CSNY summer tour and the projected studio album at a solo concert in March 1974. The quartet reassembled in earnest that summer, with sidemen Tim Drummond on bass, Russ Kunkel on drums, and Joe Lala on percussion, to rehearse at Young&#x27;s ranch near Woodside, California before embarking on the two-month, 31-date tour.

The tour was directed by San Francisco-based impresario Bill Graham. Opening acts consisted of well known performers, including Joni Mitchell (who occasionally sat in during the acoustic and semi-acoustic interlude that bridged two electric sets), Santana, the Band, the Beach Boys, and Jesse Colin Young. The band typically played up to three and a half hours of old favorites and new songs. Crosby, in particular, was disillusioned by the bombastic nature of the performances, which he collectively dubbed the &quot;Doom Tour&quot;: &quot;We had good monitors, but Stephen and Neil were punching well over 100 db from their half stacks. Graham and I simply couldn&#x27;t do the harmonies when we couldn&#x27;t hear ourselves. Also, when you play a stadium you almost have to do a Mick Jagger where you wave a sash around and prance about. I can&#x27;t quite do that. We did what we could, but I don&#x27;t know how many people in the audience really got it. A lot of them were there for the tunes. When we&#x27;d start them, they&#x27;d hear the records.&quot; Graham Nash&#x27;s unreleased film of the Wembley Stadium show highlights the scope and quality of these performances. They opted at the time not to release any recordings of the tour for an album, with Nash maintaining that &quot;[the] main feeling at the end of the tour was that we weren&#x27;t as good as we could have been.&quot; (Decades later, to mark the tour&#x27;s 40th anniversary in 2014, Nash and archivist Joel Bernstein selected songs from the five shows that had been properly recorded and released &quot;CSNY 1974&quot;.)

While the foursome would have the press believe that their characteristic arguments were a thing of the past, excesses typical to the era took their toll. Under the stewardship of Graham&#x27;s production company, the tour was plagued by profligate spending, exemplified by pillowcases embroidered with the band&#x27;s new Mitchell-designed logo and the routine chartering of helicopters and private jets in lieu of ground transportation. Nash later recalled that &quot;the tour made just over eleven million dollars, which of course was a lot of money in those days. We all got less than a half million each. It was obvious that between Bill Graham, the promoters and a bunch of others, they all had a good time. Let&#x27;s just put it that way.&quot; According to road manager Chris O&#x27;Dell, &quot;One time they spilled cocaine on the carpet. They just got down on the floor and sniffed it off the carpet. I just went, &#x27;Oh my God, this is so weird.&#x27; I&#x27;d never seen anything like it. They probably don&#x27;t remember that.&quot; The relatively abstemious Nash &quot;started taking Percocet and Percodan. I call them &#x27;I Don&#x27;t Give A Shit&#x27; pills. Someone could have said to me, &#x27;Hey, your leg&#x27;s on fire.&#x27; I would have been like, &#x27;I don&#x27;t care, man.&#x27; We were just up all night. It was insane. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anybody because the cocaine/quaalude ride should be in the ride of horrors in the circus.&quot;

Stills—who befuddled his colleagues by claiming to have participated in clandestine Vietnam War missions as a member of the United States Marine Corps during his tenure in Buffalo Springfield—began supplementing his trademark wardrobe of football jerseys with military fatigues while performing and fraternizing with his personal manager, Green Berets veteran Michael John Bowen. Having embraced a promiscuous lifestyle following the death of his girlfriend Christine Hinton several years earlier, Crosby was accompanied by two girlfriends (including future domestic partner Nancy Brown, who turned 18 during the tour) in lieu of Debbie Donovan, his nominal domestic partner at the time. This chagrined several employees and band members; according to Nash, &quot;Often I would knock on his hotel door, which he kept propped open with a security jamb, and he&#x27;d be getting blown by both of those girls, all while he was talking and doing business on the phone and rolling joints and smoking and having a drink. Crosby had incredible sexual energy. It got to be such a routine scene in his room, I&#x27;d stop by with someone and go, &quot;Aw, fuck, he&#x27;s getting blown again. Oh, dear, let&#x27;s give him a minute.&quot;

Although each member performed new songs that later appeared on solo and duo studio releases, Young premiered more than a dozen songs (including several from &quot;On The Beach&quot;, which was released during the tour) in one of the most creatively fertile phases of his career. Vexed by the diminished prolificacy of the trio, he isolated himself from the group, travelling separately in an RV with his son and entourage. He later asserted to biographer Jimmy McDonough that &quot;the tour was disappointing to me. I think CSN really blew it... they hadn&#x27;t made an album, and they didn&#x27;t have any songs. How could they just stop like that?&quot; Atlantic Records issued the compilation &quot;So Far&quot; to have something to promote during the tour. While Nash viewed the re-shuffling of items from only two albums and one single (typified by the exclusion of his &quot;Marrakesh Express&quot;, a Top 40 hit) as absurd, it eventually topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart in November.

Surmounting Young&#x27;s interpersonal distance and new ebbs in their respective relationships with Stills, the quartet reconvened with The Albert Brothers at Rudy Records (Nash&#x27;s San Francisco home studio) in November to finish the long-gestating follow-up to &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;. Renewed tensions were exacerbated by the relatively incommodious basement space, prompting the group to soon relocate to the Record Plant in nearby Sausalito, California. While several songs were completed and recorded (including Young&#x27;s &quot;Human Highway&quot;; a take of Crosby&#x27;s &quot;Homeward Through the Haze&quot; with the singer-songwriter on piano and Lee Sklar on bass; and Nash&#x27;s anti-whaling opus &quot;Wind on the Water&quot;), Young left once again following a tumultuous argument. As the remaining members (augmented by a variety of session musicians, including Sklar and Kunkel) attempted to complete the album under the CSN name, the feud between Stills and Nash resurfaced, resulting in Stills destroying the master of &quot;Wind on the Water&quot; with a razor blade after Crosby and Nash objected to a harmony part on Stills&#x27; &quot;Guardian Angel&quot;. Even though Stills characterized the incident as a joke, the sessions promptly dissolved.

Shortly thereafter, Crosby and Nash signed a separate contract with ABC Records and began to tour regularly again, playing a more intimate array of sports arenas, outdoor festivals and theaters. During this period they produced two studio albums, &quot;Wind on the Water&quot; (No. 6) in 1975 and &quot;Whistling Down the Wire&quot; (No. 26) in 1976 (both being certified gold in the US), and the 1977 concert album &quot;Crosby-Nash Live&quot; (No. 52). Along with Drummond (retained from the 1974 CSNY tour), they continued to use the sidemen from the ensemble known as The Section from their first LP. This crack session group (wryly rechristened The Mighty Jitters by Crosby in a nod to the era&#x27;s endemic cocaine use) contributed to records by myriad other Los Angeles-based artists in the seventies, such as Carole King, James Taylor, and Jackson Browne. Throughout the mid-70s, Crosby and Nash also lent their harmonies to a range of recordings, including Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Mexico&quot;, Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Free Man in Paris&quot; and Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Blue Moves&quot;.

Meanwhile, Stills and Young returned to their own careers. Stills released an eponymous album in June 1975 (No. 19), a live album in December 1975 (&quot;Stephen Stills Live&quot;, No. 42) and in May 1976 another studio album (&quot;Illegal Stills&quot;, No. 31). Young, in 1975, belatedly released &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; at the recommendation of Band bassist/vocalist Rick Danko (No. 25) and thence &quot;Zuma&quot; (No. 25), a new album primarily recorded with Crazy Horse that also featured one song recorded by CSNY in the June 1974 sessions. None of these solo albums initially attained RIAA certification in the United States, although &quot;Zuma&quot; was ultimately certified gold in 1997. Following the lead of Crosby and Nash, they briefly united for a one-off album and tour credited to the Stills-Young Band, &quot;Long May You Run&quot; (1976, No. 26), which was certified gold in 1977. Although the Miami-based sessions for this album briefly metamorphosed into the third attempt at a CSNY reunion album, Stills and Young wiped the vocal contributions of the other pair off the master tape when Crosby &amp; Nash were obligated to leave the sessions to finish &quot;Whistling Down the Wire&quot; in Los Angeles. As Stills and Young embarked on a tour to promote the album in the summer of 1976, the old tensions between the pair resurfaced, exemplified by Stills&#x27; insistence that professional studio musicians back them rather than Young&#x27;s preferred Crazy Horse. After a July 20, 1976, show in Columbia, South Carolina, Young&#x27;s tour bus took a different direction from Stills&#x27;. Waiting at their next stop in Atlanta, Stills received a laconic telegram: &quot;Dear Stephen, Funny how things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach. Neil.&quot; Young&#x27;s management claimed that he was under doctor&#x27;s orders to rest and recover from an apparent throat infection, though he made up dates with Crazy Horse later in the year. Stills was contractually bound to finish the tour alone.

===CSN reform: 1976–1985===
Later in 1976, Stills approached Crosby and Nash during a performance at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, setting the stage for the return of the trio.

Less than a year after reforming, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash released &quot;CSN&quot;. Recorded at Criteria Studios in Miami under the aegis of Ron and Howard Albert throughout late 1976 and early 1977, the album exemplified the meticulously stylized soft rock production ethos of the epoch and contained the band&#x27;s highest-charting single, Nash&#x27;s &quot;Just a Song Before I Go&quot; (#7); Stills&#x27; &quot;Fair Game&quot; also peaked at #43. The album peaked at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart in the summer of 1977 during a 33-week stay, remaining at that position for the month of August (behind one of the best-selling LPs of all time, Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Rumours&quot;) and ultimately earning a RIAA quadruple platinum certification. As of 2017, it remains the trio configuration&#x27;s best-selling album, outselling their debut by 200,000 records.

On June 21, 1978, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their contributions to the music industry, located at 6666 Hollywood Boulevard.

After successful arena tours in 1977 and 1978, further work as a group was complicated by Crosby&#x27;s newfound dependence on freebase cocaine. &quot;Earth &amp; Sky&quot;, a 1980 Nash album that failed to chart in the Top 100, was envisaged as a Crosby &amp; Nash project (itself spawned by aborted 1978 CSN sessions) until Nash determined that Crosby was not in shape to participate after his colleague stopped a jam because his freebase pipe had fallen off of an amp and broken.

Juxtaposing recent disco-inflected material (including the Andy Gibb showcase &quot;What&#x27;s the Game&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Get No Booty&quot;, co-written with Danny Kortchmar during a lull in the 1978 CSN sessions) against more conventional acoustic and blues rock arrangements (such as the Manassas-era title track), Stills&#x27; &quot;Thoroughfare Gap&quot; stalled at No. 83 following its release in October 1978. Stills&#x27; 1979 support tour with the California Blues Band (including a performance at the historic Havana Jam) was dominated by theater bookings and largely overshadowed by such tabloid-friendly stories as a brawl with Elvis Costello (instigated by the younger singer-songwriter&#x27;s use of the word nigger in deprecatory assessments of James Brown and Ray Charles) amid his brief engagement to television actress Susan St. James, reflecting his diminished critical and commercial stature. The tour&#x27;s opening concerts at the Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles marked Stills&#x27; final full performances with onetime key collaborator Dallas Taylor, by then long addicted to heroin and cocaine. After entering recovery in 1985, Taylor worked as an interventionist and sober companion until his death in 2015.

With little recourse and a rapport that still evinced strain from the Rita Coolidge affair, Stills and Nash convened in 1980–1981 to record &quot;Daylight Again&quot; as a self-funded duo; however, Atlantic Records executives (led by Ahmet Ertegun, who seldom intervened in the band&#x27;s affairs) refused to reimburse their expenses or release the LP until Crosby was reinstated. Crosby contributed &quot;Delta&quot; (his last original composition for several years) and a cover of Judy Henske&#x27;s and Craig Doerge&#x27;s &quot;Might as Well Have a Good Time&quot; along with some additional vocals on other tracks. Despite Crosby&#x27;s condition and the relatively démodé nature of the group in the wake of the ascendancy of new wave and contemporary R&amp;B, &quot;Daylight Again&quot; reached No. 8 in 1982 during a 41-week chart stay. The album contained two major hits: Nash&#x27;s &quot;Wasted on the Way&quot; (#9) and Stills&#x27; &quot;Southern Cross&quot; (#18); Stills&#x27; &quot;Too Much Love to Hide&quot; also charted at #69. While the album ultimately failed to sell as well as its predecessors in the new musical climate, it received a RIAA platinum certification in early 1983.

Although the success of &quot;Daylight Again&quot; inaugurated a new tradition of near-annual touring that persisted for over thirty years, the bottom soon fell out for Crosby, who was arrested and jailed on drug and weapons charges in Texas in May 1982. Having recorded a potential title song for the film &quot;WarGames&quot; that was never used, the band released it as a single and hastily assembled concert recordings around two studio tracks for the album &quot;Allies&quot;, their lowest-charting record to date. Crosby was sentenced to two terms, but the conviction was overturned; arrested several more times, he finally turned himself in to the authorities in December 1985. He spent eight months in prison.

===CSNY again: 1988–2015===
Based on a promise he made to Crosby should he clean himself up, Young agreed to rejoin the trio in the studio upon Crosby&#x27;s release from prison for &quot;American Dream&quot; in 1988. Stills and Crosby (enfeebled by health problems from his fallow period that culminated in a 1994 liver transplant) were barely functioning for the making of the album, and the late eighties production completely swamped the band. It did make it to No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart during a 22-week stay, but the record received poor critical notices, and Young refused to support it with a CSNY tour. The band did produce a video for Young&#x27;s title-song single, wherein each member played a character loosely based on certain aspects of their personalities and public image. Several years later, CSNY reunited to play the Bill Graham memorial concert (&quot;Laughter, Love and Music&quot;) at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco on November 3, 1991.

CSN recorded two more studio albums in the 1990s, &quot;Live It Up&quot; (1990) and &quot;After the Storm&quot; (1994); both albums sold poorly by previous standards and failed to attain RIAA certifications. A box set arrived in 1991, four discs of expected group highlights amidst unexpected better tracks from various solo projects. Owing to certain difficulties, manager Roberts, no longer with the trio but still representing Young, pulled most of Young&#x27;s material earmarked for the box. Ultimately, nineteen tracks out of the seventy-seven in the set were credited to CSNY. Intended for inclusion, the 1976 CSNY version of &quot;Human Highway&quot; was leaked to the internet several years later before receiving an official release on the &quot;Neil Young Archives Volume II: 1972–1976&quot; box set in 2020.

In 1994, CSN collaborated with Suzy Bogguss, Alison Krauss, and Kathy Mattea to contribute &quot;Teach Your Children&quot; to the AIDS benefit album &quot;Red Hot + Country&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization.

By the late 1990s, CSN found themselves without a record contract. They began financing recordings themselves, and in 1999 Stills invited Young to guest on a few tracks. Impressed by their gumption, Young increased his level of input, turning the album into a CSNY project, &quot;Looking Forward&quot;. The album was released at Young&#x27;s behest via Reprise Records in October 1999. With writing credits mostly limited to band members, the disc was better received than the previous three albums from a critical standpoint. It also fared relatively well commercially, peaking at No. 26 (the group&#x27;s highest chart placement since &quot;American Dream&quot;) during a 9-week stay. However, in a reflection of the shifting financial landscape of the music industry, &quot;Looking Forward&quot; was most notable for laying the groundwork for the ensuing CSNY2K Tour (2000) and the CSNY Tour of America (2002), both of which were major money-makers.

CSN were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997; CSNY is the first band to have all its members inducted into the hall twice, although Young was inducted for his solo work (1995) and for Buffalo Springfield (1997). A year later, in 1998, CSN were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. The CSN logo that Crosby, Stills and Nash used from the mid-1970s onward was designed by actor and comedian Phil Hartman during his first career as a graphic designer.

Various compilations of the band&#x27;s configurations have arrived over the years, the box set being the most comprehensive, and &quot;So Far&quot; being the most commercially successful. Individual retrospective box sets have also been released. In 2007, David Crosby&#x27;s &quot;Voyage&quot; chronicled his work with various bands and as a solo artist. Graham Nash&#x27;s &quot;Reflections&quot; appeared in early 2009 under the same auspices, quite near his 67th birthday. The box set for Stephen Stills, &quot;Carry On&quot;, was released in February 2013. Compilation and oversight of these releases has largely been managed by Nash.

In 2006, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young set off on their Freedom of Speech Tour in support of &quot;Living with War&quot;, a Young solo album written in response to the Iraq War. The long setlists included the bulk of the new protest album as well as material from Stills&#x27; long-delayed solo album &quot;Man Alive!&quot; and recent material from Crosby and Nash. On May 16, 2006, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash were honored as a BMI Icon at the 54th annual BMI Pop Awards. They were honored for their &quot;unique and indelible influence on generations of music makers.&quot; In February 2007, CSN were forced to postpone a tour of Australia and New Zealand due to David Crosby&#x27;s illness. Also in 2006, long-time manager Gerry Tolman died in a car accident.

The trio performed &quot;Teach Your Children&quot; on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on July 30, 2008, with host Stephen Colbert filling in the fourth harmony (Neil Young&#x27;s portion) and wearing a Young-mocking outfit and being referred to by Nash as &quot;Neil&quot;. In 2009, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash released &quot;Demos&quot;, an album made up of demo recordings of popular group and solo songs. In June 2009 Crosby, Stills and Nash performed at the Glastonbury Festival. Stephen Stills was praised for his exceptional guitar playing. Neil Young did not appear onstage with them but did perform as a solo artist. In July 2009, they headlined the 14th annual Gathering of the Vibes festival. Halfway through their set, they enthusiastically announced to the crowd that they would be back next year.

CSN convened with producer Rick Rubin to record a projected covers album (tentatively titled &quot;Songs We Wish We&#x27;d Written&quot;) for Sony Music Entertainment in 2010; seven songs were completed before the dissolution of the sessions due to the increasingly acrimonious relationship between Rubin and Crosby, who perceived the former as a disruptive and autocratic figure in the creative process. By 2012, CSN had completed five self-produced re-recordings in anticipation of a potential rights dispute over the Rubin sessions with Sony.

Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash toured the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Brazil in 2012 and released a 2CD/DVD entitled &quot;CSN 2012&quot; on July 17, 2012. Further tours of the United States and Europe followed in 2013 and 2014.

Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young performed an acoustic set at the 27th Bridge School Benefit on October 27, 2013 which was that configuration&#x27;s final concert. &quot;CSNY 1974&quot;, an anthology culled from hitherto unreleased recordings of the 1974 tour by Nash and longtime band archivist Joel Bernstein, was released by Rhino Records on July 8, 2014 to widespread critical acclaim. In a September 2014 interview with the &quot;Idaho Statesman&quot;, Crosby dispelled rumors of another CSNY tour (citing Neil Young&#x27;s general unwillingness and lack of financial incentive to perform with the ensemble) before characterizing Young&#x27;s new partner Daryl Hannah as &quot;a purely poisonous predator.&quot; While introducing a song during a solo performance at the Philadelphia Academy of Music on October 8, 2014, Young announced that &quot;CSNY will never tour again, ever...but I love those guys.&quot; Two days later, Crosby confirmed that &quot;[Young] is very angry with me,&quot; and likened Young&#x27;s remarks to &quot;saying there are mountains in Tibet.&quot; Crosby made further comments, including that he apologized on Twitter. On May 18, 2015, Crosby apologized publicly to Hannah and Young on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, saying &quot;I&#x27;m screwed up way worse than that girl. Where do I get off criticizing her? She&#x27;s making Neil happy. I love Neil and I want him happy,&quot; and &quot;Daryl, if you&#x27;re out there, I apologize. Where do I get off criticizing you? There are people I can criticize: politicians, pond scum. Not other artists that have gone through a hard life, same as me. She hasn&#x27;t had it easy either.&quot;

===CSN breakup and Crosby&#x27;s death: 2016–present===
Despite the unprecedented tumult between Crosby and Young, CSN embarked on a routine world tour encompassing American, European and Japanese venues in 2015, culminating in a performance of &quot;Silent Night&quot; at the National Christmas Tree lighting ceremony at The Ellipse in Washington, D.C., on December 3, 2015. However, contrary to a previous November 2015 interview in which he stated he still hoped the band had a future, Nash announced on March 6, 2016, following his divorce from his wife of 38 years, Susan Sennett, that Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash would never perform again because of his recent estrangement from Crosby. In the summer of 2016, Young told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he wouldn&#x27;t &quot;rule out&quot; future collaborations with the trio; according to Nash in a follow-up interview, &quot;Well, he&#x27;s right, you never know. There have been times when I&#x27;ve been so pissed at us all for wasting time and not getting on with the job that I wouldn&#x27;t talk to any of them. But if Crosby came and played me four songs that knocked me on my ass, what the fuck am I supposed to do as a musician, no matter how pissed we are at each other?&quot;

Young echoed these sentiments in a January 2017 interview: &quot;I think CSNY has every chance of getting together again. I&#x27;m not against it. There&#x27;s been a lot of bad things happen[ing] among us, and a lot of things have to be settled. But that&#x27;s what brothers and families are all about. We&#x27;ll see what happens. I&#x27;m open. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m a major obstacle.&quot; When queried about Young and the interview on Twitter shortly thereafter, Crosby said that Young is &quot;a hugely talented guy&quot; and a prospective reunion would be &quot;fine with me.&quot; In April 2017, Nash framed the potential reunion in the context of the group&#x27;s tradition of political activism amid the presidency of Donald Trump: &quot;I believe that the issues that are keeping us apart pale in comparison to the good that we can do if we get out there and start talking about what&#x27;s happening. So I&#x27;d be totally up for it even though I&#x27;m not talking to David and neither is Neil. But I think that we&#x27;re smart people in the end and I think we realize the good that we can do.&quot; In a May 2021 interview for &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot;, Nash said &quot;when that silver thread that connects a band gets broken it&#x27;s very difficult to glue the ends together.&quot; He suggested reuniting with Crosby and the others would be preferable &quot;because of the loss of the music.&quot;

On January 18, 2023, David Crosby died at 81, ending any possibilities of a full reunion.

==Political activism==
CSNY&#x27;s music reflected the tastes and viewpoints of the counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s. With protest against the Vietnam War gearing up in 1970, the group (and Crosby in particular) made no secret of their political leanings.

As a group, they recorded one hit song in response to political events although they recorded other political songs as solo artists and in various combinations. The song, &quot;Ohio&quot;, was written in response to the deaths of four students at Kent State University. The students were shot by Ohio National Guardsmen during an anti-war protest on the campus in May 1970.

Between &quot;Ohio&quot;, their appearance in both the festival and movie of &quot;Woodstock&quot;, and the runaway success of their two albums, the group found themselves in the position of enjoying a level of adulation far greater than experienced with their previous bands, as evidenced by the 27 Platinum certifications they received across seven albums.

The band has been continuously associated with political causes throughout its existence, the latest example being the song &quot;Almost Gone (The Ballad of Bradley Manning)&quot; which focuses on the length and conditions of Chelsea Manning&#x27;s pre-trial confinement.

Crosby, Nash, and Young were all vocal in their support for 2016 Democratic Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.

==Influence==

Their collective abilities allowed CSNY to straddle all the genres of popular music eminent at the time, from country rock to confessional ballads, from acoustic guitars and voice to electric guitar, and three-part harmony. With the Beatles&#x27; break-up made public by April 1970, and with Bob Dylan in reclusive low-key activity since mid-1966, CSNY found themselves the adopted standard bearers for the Woodstock Nation, serving an importance in society as counterculture figureheads, equaled at the time in rock and roll only by the Rolling Stones or the Who. Such was their standing in 1970 that Bill Graham referred to them as &quot;The American Beatles&quot;. Producer Peter Fonda wanted CSN to create the soundtrack for &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, but director Dennis Hopper nixed the idea. Stills&#x27; composition, &quot;Find the Cost of Freedom&quot; (on the flip side of &quot;Ohio&quot;), was the only song known to be offered for the soundtrack.

<text>Mervyn LeRoy (; October 15, 1900 – September 13, 1987) was an American film director and producer. During the 1930s, he was one of the two great practitioners of economical and effective film directing at Warner Brothers studios, the other his colleague, Michael Curtiz. LeRoy&#x27;s most acclaimed films of his tenure at Warners include &quot;Little Caesar&quot; (1931), &quot;I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang&quot; (1932), &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot; (1933) and &quot;They Won&#x27;t Forget&quot; (1937). LeRoy left Warners and moved to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios in 1939 to serve as both director and producer. He is best known for the 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

== Early life ==

LeRoy was born on October 15, 1900, in San Francisco, California, the only child of Edna (née Armer) and Harry LeRoy, a well-to-do department store owner. Both his parents&#x27; families had fully assimilated, residing in the Bay Area for several generations. LeRoy described his relatives as &quot;San Franciscans first, Americans second, Jews third.&quot;

LeRoy&#x27;s mother was a frequent attendee at San Francisco&#x27;s premier vaudeville venues, the Orpheum and the Alcazar, often socializing with the theater&#x27;s personnel. She arranged for the six-year-old LeRoy to serve as a Native-American papoose in the 1906 stage production of &quot;The Squaw Man&quot;. LeRoy attributed his early interest in vaudeville to &quot;my mother&#x27;s fascination with it&quot; and to that of his cousins, Jesse L. Lasky and Blanche Lasky, vaudevillians during LeRoy&#x27;s youth.

LeRoy&#x27;s parents separated suddenly in 1905 for reasons that were not divulged to their son. They never reunited and his father Harry raised LeRoy as a single parent. His mother moved to Oakland, California with Percy Teeple, a travel agent and former journalist, who would later become LeRoy&#x27;s stepfather after the death of Harry LeRoy in 1916. LeRoy visited his mother as a child, regarding her more as &quot;a grandparent or a favorite aunt.&quot;

The 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire devastated the city when LeRoy was five-and-a-half years old. He was sleeping in his bed on the second floor when the quake struck in the early morning causing the house to collapse. Neither LeRoy nor his father suffered serious physical injury. His father&#x27;s import-export store was completely destroyed. LeRoy retained vivid mental images of the city&#x27;s devastation:
Reduced to virtual penury, father and son lived as displaced persons at the military-run tent city on the Presidio for the next six months. The elder LeRoy obtained work as a salesman for the Heinz Pickle Company, but his business losses had left him &quot;a beaten man.&quot; The young LeRoy emerged from the traumatic event with a sense of pride that he had survived the ordeal and to regard it as fortuitous: &quot;The big thing in my life was the earthquake...it changed my life before I knew I even had one.&quot;

At the age of twelve, with few prospects to acquire a formal education and his father financially strained, LeRoy became a newsboy and earned his first money. His father supported him in this endeavor. LeRoy hawked newspapers at iconic locations, including Chinatown, the Barbary Coast red-light district and Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf, where he became educated as to the realities of life in the city:

== Juvenile acts in vaudeville: 1914–1923 ==

Selling newspapers near the Alcazar Theatre, LeRoy was spotted by stage star Theodore Roberts. A personable and attractive youth at age fourteen, LeRoy was engaged for a bit part in a 1914 stage production of Barbara Frietchie. Gratified by &quot;that lovely feeling—audience approval&quot;, he performed in productions with the Liberty Theater in Oakland, playing the lead juvenile roles in &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;.

=== Chaplin impersonator ===

As a 14-year-old, LeRoy carefully observed emerging screen star Charlie Chaplin at a number of film sets in the greater San Francisco area. From these studies, LeRoy devised a burlesque of the comedian, and perfected his imitation on the local amateur circuit. In 1915, he won a competition that hosted almost a thousand Chaplin imitators at the Pantages Theater. His outstanding performance earned him a slot as &quot;The Singing Newsboy&quot; in Sid Grauman&#x27;s vaudeville show at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition titled &quot;Chinatown by Night&quot;.

In 1916, his father died, leaving the 15-year-old LeRoy responsible for providing his own financial support.

=== LeRoy and Cooper: &quot;Two Kids and a Piano&quot;: 1916–1919 ===

Now a show-business professional, LeRoy left his newsboy job. Pairing with the 16-year-old actor-pianist Clyde Cooper, they formed a vaudeville routine &quot;LeRoy and Cooper: Two Kids and a Piano.&quot; The duo struggled to find engagements, and LeRoy recalled &quot;we would have played toilets if they had offered us some money.&quot; Soon they were discovered by the premier vaudeville circuits – Pantages, Gus Sun and Orpheum – and provided with regular bookings on national tours. LeRoy relished the lifestyle of a vaudevillian, occasionally appearing in shows that featured iconic performers of the era, among them Sarah Bernhardt, Harry Houdini and Jack Benny. After three years, and now &quot;a fairly well-established act&quot; in theater listings, the duo amicably disbanded after an unexpected death in Cooper&#x27;s family.

LeRoy joined George Choos&#x27;s mostly female troupe in musical comedies, and Gus Edwards act billed &quot;The Nine Country Kids&quot; in 1922. LeRoy&#x27;s enthusiasm for the stage gradually waned and he left the troupe in 1923.

== Early Hollywood career: technician and actor: 1919–1923 ==

LeRoy accepted a bit role in a scene with former &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot; (1914) star Pearl White filmed at Fort Lee, New Jersey. LeRoy was &quot;thoroughly intrigued&quot; by the filmmaking process, recalling: &quot;I knew I was finished with vaudeville. I knew, just as positively that I wanted to get into the movie business.&quot;

In October 1919, LeRoy, just turned 19, approached his cousin Jesse L. Lasky, a former vaudevillian who was twenty years his senior. Lasky was a partner with rising movie moguls Samuel Goldwyn and Adolf Zukor at its New York headquarters at Famous Players–Lasky. Lasky furnished LeRoy with note to the employment department at their Hollywood studios. A week later LeRoy began working in the Wardrobe Unit folding costumes for the American Civil War picture &quot;Secret Service&quot; (1919), earning $12.50 a week.

According to film historian Kingley Canham, LeRoy&#x27;s &quot;enthusiasm, energy and push&quot;, in addition to a further appeal to Jesse Lasky, earned LeRoy promotion to lab technician in the film tinting unit.

LeRoy&#x27;s next advancement was achieved through his own initiative. Discovering that director William DeMille wished to create an illusion of moonlight shimmering on a lake to produce a romantic effect, LeRoy devised a technique in the lab:

Despite LeRoy suffering a stern reprimand, DeMille was delighted with the effect and used the footage in the film. LeRoy was immediately promoted to assistant cameraman.

After six months behind the camera, LeRoy experienced a disastrous &quot;contretemps&quot; when he improperly adjusted the camera focus settings, ruining footage on several scenes on a DeMille production. LeRoy describes it as &quot;a horrible mess&quot; which led to his dismissal in 1921 as cameraman.

LeRoy was soon hired as an extra on Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s 1923 epic &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; LeRoy credits Cecil B. DeMille, for inspiring him to become a director: &quot;As the top director of the era, DeMille had been the magnet that had drawn me to his set as often as I could go.&quot; LeRoy also credits DeMille for teaching him the directing techniques required to make his own films.

LeRoy worked intermittently in small supporting roles in film during the early 1920s. The youthful and diminutive LeRoy (at and just over ) was consistently cast in juvenile roles. appearing with film stars Wallace Reid, Betty Compson and Gloria Swanson (See Film Chronology table) He performed his last role in &quot;The Chorus Lady&quot; (1924) as &quot;Duke&quot;.

=== Gag writer (comedy constructor) and Alfred E. Green, 1924–1926 ===

During the filming of &quot;The Ghost Breaker&quot; (1922), bit actor LeRoy suggested a number of humorous skits, which were incorporated into the picture by director Alfred E. Green. Green offered him a position as &quot;gag man&quot;. LeRoy recalled:

While working at First National Pictures, LeRoy wrote gags for comedienne Colleen Moore in several films, including &quot;Sally&quot; (1925), &quot;The Desert Flower&quot; (1925), &quot;We Moderns&quot; (1925) and &quot;Ella Cinders&quot; (1926). LeRoy served as acting advisor and confidant to Moore. In 1927, her husband John McCormick, studio head at First National in Hollywood, asked LeRoy to direct Moore in a version of &quot;Peg O&#x27; My Heart&quot;. When the project was cancelled, studio president Richard A. Rowland, with Moore advocating, authorized LeRoy to direct a comedy, &quot;No Place to Go&quot;, starring Mary Astor and Lloyd Hughes and launching LeRoy&#x27;s filmmaking career at age twenty-seven.

== First National Pictures: transition to sound, 1927–1930 ==

His success with &quot;No Place to Go&quot; (1927), was followed by &quot;a string of comedies and jazz-baby dramas&quot; that served as vehicles for actress Alice White and allowed LeRoy to hone his skills as director. His prolific output in the final years of the silent film era included the box-office successes &quot;Harold Teen&quot; with Arthur Lake and &quot;Oh, Kay!&quot; with Colleen Moore.

Warner Brothers acquired First National in 1925 as a subsidiary studio and producer Jack Warner became a mentor and in-law to LeRoy in subsequent years.

LeRoy eagerly anticipated his first sound picture assignment, &quot;Naughty Baby&quot; (1929):

LeRoy&#x27;s early directing efforts at First National were largely limited to comedies. His movies from this period include &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Fate&quot; (1931) with John Gilbert (filmed at M-G-M studios), &quot;Tonight or Never&quot; (1931), with Gloria Swanson, &quot;High Pressure&quot;, a proto-screwball comedy with William Powell and Evelyn Brent, and &quot;The Heart of New York&quot; (1932) with Joe Smith.

== Warner Brothers: 1930–1939 ==

LeRoy embarked on a period of enormous productivity and inventiveness at Warner Studios, creating &quot;some the most polished and ambitious&quot; films of the Thirties. His only rival at Warner&#x27;s was fellow director Michael Curtiz. Film historian John Baxter observes:

In the studio&#x27;s competitive crucible produced by the Great Depression demanding profitable entertainment, LeRoy directed 36 pictures during the decade (Curtiz filmed an astounding 44 features during the same period). Baxter adds: &quot;No genius could function without variation under such pressure.&quot; The social perspective of films favored at Warner Brothers was distinct from those of its chief rivals: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (M-G-M), uncontested for its &quot;technical virtuosity&quot; aimed to serve &quot;middle-class tastes&quot; and Paramount studios identified for its &quot;sophisticated dialogue and baroque settings&quot; that catered to European sensibilities. In contrast, Warner Brothers films carried themes appealing to the working classes.
LeRoy biographer Kingsley Canham writes:

LeRoy&#x27;s output in the early Thirties was prodigious. The director attests to the rate of film production at the studios:

LeRoy admits in retrospect that &quot;I shot them so often and so fast that they tend to blend together in my memory.&quot;

LeRoy&#x27;s social realism mocked corrupt politicians, bankers and the idle rich, while celebrating the Depression Era experiences of &quot;hard-working chorus girls...taxi-drivers and bell-hops struggling to make ends meet in the brawl of New York...gloss and polish were considered useless affectation.&quot;

=== Gangster genre: &quot;Little Caesar&quot;, 1930 ===
LeRoy first departed from his comedy-romance themed films with his drama &quot;Numbered Men&quot; (1930), a character study of convicts shot on location at San Quentin prison. The depiction of criminal elements had enjoyed popularity with Josef von Sternberg&#x27;s silent classic &quot;Underworld&quot; (1927), a fantasy treatment of his lone Byronic gangster &quot;Bull&quot; Weed. The gangster film as a genre was not achieved until LeRoy&#x27;s 1930 &quot;Little Caesar&quot;, starring Edward G. Robinson, the first time that &quot;any real attempt was made by Hollywood to describe the brutal reality of the criminal world.&quot;

LeRoy&#x27;s &quot;Little Caesar&quot; established the iconography of subsequent films on organized crime, emphasizing the hierarchy of family loyalties and the function of violence in advancing criminal careers. LeRoy&#x27;s adroit cinematic handling of Robinson&#x27;s Rico incrementally shifts initial audience response from revulsion at the character&#x27;s homicidal acts to a &quot;grudging admiration&quot; that provides for a measure of sympathy when the gangster meets his sordid death in a back alley. LeRoy recalled the topicality of his subject in 1930: &quot;Al Capone was a household word and the Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre had happened only a year before.&quot;

LeRoy further demonstrated his talent for delivering fast-paced and competently executed social commentary and entertainment with &quot;Five Star Final&quot; (1931), an exposé of tabloid journalism, and &quot;Two Seconds&quot; (1932), a &quot;vicious and disenchanted&quot; cautionary tale of a death row inmate, each starring Robinson.

=== &quot;I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang&quot; (1932) ===

Warner Brothers&#x27; most explosive social critique of the 1930s appeared with LeRoy&#x27;s &quot;I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang&quot;, dramatizing the harsh penal codes in Georgia and starring Paul Muni as the hunted fugitive James Allen.

Historian John Baxter observes that &quot;no director has managed to close his film on so cold a note as LeRoy.&quot; Muni&#x27;s escaped convict, falsely condemned to hard labor, is reduced to furtive prey: Asked by his estranged sweetheart &quot;how do you get along, how do you live?&quot; he hisses &quot;I steal&quot; and retreats into the night.
Muni continued to work effectively with LeRoy in &quot;The World Changes&quot; (1933) with Aline MacMahon and in &quot;Hi, Nellie!&quot; (1934) with Glenda Farrell.

The versatile LeRoy portrayed both hard-boiled and clownish characters at Warner Brothers. His &quot;Hard to Handle&quot; (1933), James Cagney plays a fast-talking and remorselessly unscrupulous con-man, often to comic effect. His 1933 pictures &quot;Tugboat Annie&quot; (with LeRoy on loan to M-G-M), with Marie Dressler and &quot;Elmer, the Great&quot;, the final of three pictures that LeRoy made with comic Joe E. Brown, stand in contrast with the director&#x27;s gangster melodramas.

LeRoy&#x27;s socially-themed narrative is evident in his &quot;Three on a Match&quot; (1932) which follows the fates of three young women: a stenographer, a showgirl and a socialite played by Bette Davis, Joan Blondell and Ann Dvorak, respectively. His adroit transitions and cross-cutting provide quick and effective insights into his characters&#x27; social rise and fall. The &quot;pitiless &quot;mileau&quot; of grimy backstreets and cheap motels&quot; serve as an implicit social critique without making this the theme of the picture.

=== &quot;The Gold Diggers of 1933&quot; (1933) ===

The musical &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot; is one of the outstanding examples of the genre that Warner Brothers released in the thirties. While the &quot;surreal, geometric, often erotically charged&quot; dance stagings by choreographer Busby Berkeley dominate the picture, Warner&#x27;s musicals were distinguished enough, according to historian John Baxter, &quot;to be worth considering outside any discussion of Berkeley&#x27;s dance direction. &quot;The Gold Diggers of 1933&quot; certainly deserves such attention.&quot; Offering more than mere depression era escapism, the musical depicts the mass unemployment of veterans of World War I and alludes to the then-recent Bonus Army protests in Washington, D.C., that were suppressed by police and U.S. Army units. The movie closes with the &quot;dark and pessimistic&quot; number &quot;Remember My Forgotten Man.&quot;

LeRoy&#x27;s control of the comedic elements and his direction of a cast endowed with &quot;hard-boiled&quot; heroines Ruby Keeler, Joan Blondell, Aline MacMahon and Ginger Rogers, would provide stand-alone entertainment even if unencumbered by Berkeley&#x27;s choreographed numbers. MacMahon, who plays the &quot;ruthless&quot; Trixie, was later cast as a murderess in the lead for LeRoy&#x27;s dramatic &quot;Heat Lightning&quot; (1934), a picture which prefigures director Archie Mayo&#x27;s &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; (1936).

LeRoy followed with a &quot;Happiness Ahead,&quot; a musical-like comedy for Warners in 1934 starring Josephine Hutchinson, a society heiress who woos a window washer, played by Dick Powell.

=== 1935: &quot;Oil for the Lamps of China,&quot; &quot;Sweet Adeline,&quot; &quot;Page Miss Glory,&quot; and &quot;I Found Stella Parish&quot; ===

&quot;Oil for the Lamps of China&quot;, an adaptation of the Alice Tisdale Hobart novel, is an examination of an American oil company in China, centering on its paternalistic and humiliating treatment of an ambitious company man, played by Pat O&#x27;Brien. Josephine Hutchinson portrays his long-suffering wife. LeRoy effectively employed cinematic techniques of montage, structural parallels in settings, chiaroscuro lighting and musical leitmotifs to develop atmosphere and convey O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s struggle, ending in his vindication.

LeRoy returned to light comedy and romance in 1935 with a film adaptation of stage production, the 1929 Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II play, starring Irene Dunne, followed by a Marion Davies vehicle &quot;Page Miss Glory&quot;, (filmed for Hearst&#x27;s Cosmopolitan Pictures), and &quot;I Found Stella Parish,&quot;, with Kay Francis in a sentimental, &quot;tour-de-force&quot; performance.

=== &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot; (1936) ===

Based on the popular twelve-hundred page historical romance by Hervey Allen, Warner&#x27;s &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot; (1936) was LeRoy&#x27;s most prestigious undertaking to date. Only two-thirds of the vast and unwieldy picaresque tale, set during the Napoleonic era, is depicted onscreen (a sequel was planned but abandoned). The sheer scale of the project remains impressive, and LeRoy&#x27;s ability to handle a film with high production values that possessed a &quot;Metro-like glossiness&quot; elevated him to becoming a protective executive producer at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

The &quot;lively performances&quot; from a large cast, which included Fredric March, Olivia de Havilland, Claude Rains, Anita Louise and Gale Sondergaard, as well as LeRoy&#x27;s &quot;technical excellence,&quot; led to five Academy Award nominations.

LeRoy reported in his 1974 memoir that &quot;by the time 1936 arrived, I was slowing my pace somewhat. Gone were the assembly-line tactics, the grinding-them-out methods of a few years before...I was working slower, trying to achieve more beauty on film, looking for cinematic perfection.&quot;

== Producer-Director at Warner Brothers: 1936–1938 ==

In 1936, Warners began tasking LeRoy with both directing and producing assignments. LeRoy served as producer-director on &quot;Three Men on a Horse&quot; (1936), a &quot;madcap&quot; comedy starring Frank McHugh and a screenplay co-written by Groucho Marx. This was followed in 1937 with The King and the Chorus Girl, starring French actor Fernand Gravet . Both films costarred Joan Blondell.

LeRoy also produced director James Whale&#x27;s &quot;The Great Garrick&quot; (1937), a historical comedy with Brian Aherne who plays the renowned English actor.

=== &quot;They Won&#x27;t Forget&quot; (1937) ===

LeRoy&#x27;s penultimate film for Warners was &quot;They Won&#x27;t Forget&quot; (1937), a harsh indictment of lynch law based on the Ward Greene novel, &quot;Death in the Deep South&quot; (1936). According to critic Kingsley Canham, LeRoy&#x27;s handling of tracking and low-angle shots, overhead composition, close-ups and dissolves possess a &quot;visual power&quot; that &quot;retains its impact for modern audiences.&quot; LeRoy&#x27;s unmitigated condemnation of lynching rejects misanthropy and adopts a tone of &quot;righteous anger&quot;, in which there &quot;is no forgiveness&quot; for the instigators of mob law.

LeRoy was poised to move to M-G-M as head of production in 1938, with the fulsome support of the studio&#x27;s Louis B. Mayer where &quot;[LeRoy] would establish himself as a major force in Forties cinema.&quot; Before departing Warners, LeRoy directed and produced his final film, &quot;Fools for Scandal&quot; (1938), the studio&#x27;s second – and failed attempt – to launch the American film career of French actor Fernand Gravet. Comedienne Carole Lombard co-starred.

== Interlude as producer: M-G-M: 1938–1939 ==

LeRoy arrived at M-G-M fully expecting to finish his career as the studio&#x27;s chief production executive. His first assignments were modest:

&quot;Dramatic School&quot; (1938) directed by Robert B. Sinclair: A romantic drama starring Luise Rainer and Paulette Goddard and LeRoy&#x27;s first picture at M-G-M. Biographer John Baxter attributes Rainer&#x27;s &quot;coherent, moving and truthful&quot; performance to producer LeRoy and &quot;a fitting to [the filmmakers] rich Thirties career.&quot;

&quot;Stand Up and Fight&quot; (1938), directed by W. S. Van Dyke: A Wallace Beery vehicle, with costars Robert Taylor and Florence Rice. The screenplay was co-written by crime fiction writer James M. Cain, and Jane Murfin, who wrote the adaptation of Booth Tarkington&#x27;s novel the Katharine Hepburn vehicle &quot;Alice Adams&quot; (1935).

At the Circus (1938) directed by Edward Buzzell: A Marx Brothers comedy.

LeRoy&#x27;s last picture as M-G-M&#x27;s production executive was an adaptation of L. Frank Baum&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

=== &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939): &quot;Magnum&quot; &quot;opus&quot; production ===
In 1938, LeRoy proposed a film version of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900). Louis B. Mayer purchased the rights to the property from Samuel Goldwyn for $50,000. Mayer limited LeRoy&#x27;s role to producer and ultimately Victor Fleming was enlisted as credited director. LeRoy recalled the scope of the project:

LeRoy added that &quot;it took six months to prepare the picture, six months to shoot it, and then a lengthy post-production schedule for editing and scoring. Altogether, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; was many months in the making...&quot;

Though LeRoy was earning $3,000 a week ($600,000 per year), after completing &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot; he requested a release from his contract to return to directing, and Mayer complied.

LeRoy accepted a cut in salary to $4,000 a week as a director at M-G-M and &quot;never again functioned only as a producer.&quot;

== Director at M-G-M: 1940–1949 ==

The onset of war in Europe in 1939 created anxiety in the Hollywood film industry as the overseas movie market contracted and currency restrictions mounted in Great Britain. Hollywood studios implemented salary reductions and limits on film content were imposed, particularly at M-G-M. Film historians Charles Higham and Joel Greenberg describe these developments persisting &quot;almost to the end of the decade&quot;:

Critic Andrew Sarris disparages the &quot;sentimental piety and conformist cant&quot; that characterized M-G-M studios, as well as Warner Brothers in Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age

LeRoy limited himself to directing features at M-G-M for the next 9 years, delivering 11 pictures. The quality of his output during this period is generally viewed as a decline creatively compared to his early work at Warner Brothers during the Thirties.

He resumed directorial duties with an adaptation of Robert E. Sherwood&#x27;s romantic play &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot; (1930).

=== &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot; (1940) ===

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer purchased the rights to &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot; from Universal Studios, which had produced an adaptation filmed in 1931 by James Whale and starring Mae Clarke as the fallen woman, Myra.

LeRoy&#x27;s &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot; (1940), served as a vehicle to capitalize upon the meteoric rise of Vivien Leigh, heroine of David O. Selznick&#x27;s epic &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939). In a period when foreign markets were in jeopardy, profitable films were at a premium.

A silent film era technician and director in his early Hollywood career, LeRoy utilized silent film methods to film a key nightclub love scene with Leigh and costar Robert Taylor. LeRoy describes his epiphany:

LeRoy directed Robert Taylor, Norma Shearer and Conrad Veidt in the 1940 &quot;Escape&quot;, the first of a number of anti-Nazi features suppressed by Hitler and which ultimately led to the banning of all M-G-M pictures in Germany.

=== The Greer Garson pictures ===

LeRoy completed four features with English actress Greer Garson, an enormously profitable property cultivated by M-G-M to appeal to their British markets during WWII.

Blossoms in the Dust (1941): The screenplay by Anita Loos portrays the struggle by social reformer Edna Gladney to redeem children stigmatized by illegitimacy. Termed &quot;highly romanticized&quot; and &quot;shamelessly sentimental&quot; by film historian Kingley Canham, LeRoy defended the picture as virtuous and socially significant:

The pairing of Garson with Walter Pidgeon proved particularly appealing to their fans. They would appear together in a number of pictures, including LeRoy&#x27;s 1943 biopic of Madame Curie.

As LeRoy&#x27;s first color film, &quot;Blossoms in the Dust&quot; demonstrates an aesthetically pleasing and an adroit handling of the new Technicolor technology.

&quot;Random Harvest&quot; (1942): LeRoy and producer Sydney Franklin paired Garson with fellow Briton Ronald Colman in a romance that dramatizes clinical amnesia suffered by a WWI combat veteran. Garson&#x27;s genteel and largely desexualized screen image – &quot;M-G-M&#x27;s First Lady of Saintly Virtue&quot; – favored by Louis B. Mayer, is countered by LeRoy&#x27;s less inhibited Garson as the &quot;impulsive Scottish lass&quot; Paula.

LeRoy&#x27;s leisurely narrative pace, the lavishness of the settings, the fulsome musical score and the balanced editing demonstrate his embrace of M-G-M production values and distinguishing the stylish &quot;Random Harvest&quot; from his work at Warner Brothers.

&quot;Madame Curie&quot; (1943): Apropos LeRoy&#x27;s &quot;lavish and lengthy biography&quot; portraying the Nobel prize-winning scientist Marie Curie, critics Higham and Greenberg make these observations:

LeRoy and producer Sydney Franklin made a genuine effort to make the &quot;highbrow&quot; subject of the film – the heroic discovery of radium isotopes – engaging to the public, resorting to romanticizing and simplifying the topic.

&quot;Madame Curie&quot; was one of nine pictures in which Garson was cast with leading man Pidgeon. Married to Buddy Fogelson, Garson earned the title &quot;the daytime Mrs. Pidgeon&quot; on M-G-M sets.

Desire Me (1946): LeRoy attempted to reshoot an uncompleted George Cukor project starring Garson and Robert Mitchum, &quot;Desire Me&quot;, but abandoned the film, disparaging the &quot;rotten script, a script that made absolutely no sense.&quot;. Neither Cukor nor LeRoy appeared in the credits.

Strange Lady in Town (1955): LeRoy&#x27;s first film after returning to Warner Brothers studios as a director-producer. Garson, passed over by M-G-M to star as opera diva Marjorie Lawrence in Interrupted Melody (1955), signed with Warners to make &quot;Strange Lady in Town&quot;, a western set in Santa Fe, New Mexico and endowed to Garson&#x27;s satisfaction &quot;with horses and sunsets.&quot; Dana Andrews co-stars.

=== Wartime propaganda: 1944–1945 ===

In the final years of World War II, LeRoy directed propaganda films dramatizing the American war efforts at home and overseas.

Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo (1944) recounts the 1942 U.S. bombing mission over Tokyo by sixteen B-25s, coordinated by Lieutenant-Colonel James H. Doolittle (played by Spencer Tracy). LeRoy employs flashbacks in an effort to present the personal lives of the airmen and their spouses, including an emotionally wrought scene in which the wounded Lieutenant Ted W. Lawson (played by Van Johnson) has his leg amputated.

Conceived as a morale-builder for the homefront, &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot;, with a script written by Dalton Trumbo &quot;lacks the scope and organization&quot; and compares unfavorably to director John Cromwell&#x27;s 1943 Since You Went Away according to critic Kingsley Canham. The rescue sequences of the downed American flyers&#x27; by Chinese guerrillas was designed &quot;to foster closer relations &#x27;between the American People and their courageous Chinese allies&#x27;&quot; and includes a scene with Chinese children at a mission hospital honoring the airmen with a rendition of Katherine Lee Bates&#x27; patriotic anthem America the Beautiful.

&quot;The House I Live In&quot; (1945), Documentary short: LeRoy reports in his memoir &quot;Take One&quot; that Frank Sinatra approached him in 1945 with the idea of making a short movie version based on the song by Abel Meeropol &quot;The House I Live In&quot;. LeRoy thought it a worthy project and &quot;a good thing to do during the wartime years.&quot; The script was written by Albert Maltz and produced by Frank Ross and LeRoy, who also directed.

&quot;The House I Live In&quot; garnered LeRoy a special Oscar for his role as producer in the short film, the only Academy Award he would ever receive. In appreciation for LeRoy&#x27;s contributions to &quot;The House I Live In,&quot; Frank Sinatra presented him with a medallion bearing the Jewish Star of David on one side and a Saint Christopher medal on the obverse.

== Postwar Hollywood in the 1940s ==

The Hollywood film industry reached its zenith in productivity, profitability, and popularity at the end of World War II. The studios collectively enjoyed their most lucrative year in 1946, with gross earnings reaching $1.75 billion. In the closing years of the decade, organized labor won wage increases of 25% through protracted strikes. Overseas markets imposed substantial taxes on Hollywood films. Studios reacted by cutting expenses on film production and ordering mass layoffs. Historians Higham and Greenberg describe the qualitative impact on Hollywood films:

The formerly &quot;glossy&quot; productions were often replaced with lower budget, black-and-white films, which employed smaller casts and used indoor stages, rather than expensive on-location sites.

Compounding the financial crisis was the Red Scare, launched against the purported Communist influence in Hollywood. The leading studio executives expelled many talented figures in collaboration with House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Accused of introducing Communist content into productions, the departure of Leftist screenwriters, directors and actors removed a creative element that had for years contributed to the success of Hollywood pictures. These purgings were considered, in some financial circles and the anti-Communist establishment, a necessary corrective to labor militancy in the industry: &quot;To some observers, [the blacklist] represented a long overdue housecleaning process; to others it meant the beginning of an era of fear, betrayal and witch-hunting hysteria.&quot;

LeRoy reflected on the Red Scare in his 1974 memoir:

By the close of the Forties, the drain of artistic talent, the emerging television industry, and litigation that led to the weakening of studio monopolies destabilized the film industry, initiating a decline in the heretofore unlimited power and profitability of the Hollywood movie empire.

=== Comedies, melodramas and a literary remake: 1946–1950 ===

Without Reservations (1946): LeRoy&#x27;s post-war pictures began with a Claudette Colbert vehicle (reminiscent of her role in &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (1934)), with John Wayne as &quot;Rusty&quot; in an uncharacteristic romantic-comedic role. Colbert, as &quot;Kit,&quot; utters the memorable and mildly impious phrase, &quot;Thanks, God. I&#x27;ll take it from here.&quot; This is also the title of the book, by Jane Allen and Mae Livingston, on which the movie is based.

&quot;Homecoming&quot; (1948): Like director William Wyler&#x27;s 1946 &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives,&quot; LeRoy&#x27;s Homecoming dramatizes an ex-servicemen&#x27;s readjustment to civilian life. The film is based on Sidney Kingsley novel, &quot;The Homecoming of Ulysses&quot; (1944), which draws on Homer&#x27;s ancient Greek epic. Clark Gable plays Ulysses &quot;Lee&quot; Johnson, a recently discharged war surgeon whose self-complacency is shaken by his personal and professional combat experiences. That softens his misanthropy and eases the nexus with his estranged wife, played by Anne Baxter. In the third of her film pairings with Gable, Lane Turner plays an &quot;uncharacteristically unglamorous&quot; Lt. Jane &quot;Snapshot&quot; McCall.

&quot;Little Women&quot;: One of several film adaptations of Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s Civil War era literary classic. The M-G-M Technicolor production offers &quot;a picture postcard prettiness&quot; in lieu of credible performances by June Allyson, Janet Leigh, Elizabeth Taylor and Margaret O&#x27;Brien.

Any Number Can Play (1949): Based on an Edward Harris Heth novel, the film describes the personal and professional crisis of a casino owner of high rectitude Clark Gable who also plays for high stakes, with his family relations in the balance. LeRoy was perplexed that the compelling screenplay by Richard Brooks and excellent performances delivered by Gable and Alexis Smith did not register at the box-office. LeRoy reflected on the picture: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what went wrong. You start out with what you think is a good script and you get a good cast...[but] you end up with a film that is less than you expect. Something happened or, more likely, something didn&#x27;t happen – the chemistry didn&#x27;t work and the emotions didn&#x27;t explode. Whatever the reason, &quot;Any Number Can Play&quot; was a disappointment to me.&quot;

&quot;East Side, West Side&quot; (1949): A &quot;dramatic social melodrama&quot;, in which the East Side, West Side refers to the class differences that define and divide the &quot;superlative cast&quot; in this M-G-M &quot;high-gloss&quot; production. Barbara Stanwyck, plays the betrayed spouse, supported by co-stars James Mason, Ava Gardner and Van Heflin.

== &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; (1951): Biblical spectacle ==

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; (1950) dramatizes an episode in the apocrypha Acts of Peter. The Latin title translates as &quot;Where are you going?&quot; and was adapted from a novel by Nobel Laureate author Henryk Sienkiewicz.

LeRoy&#x27;s recognized that the Hollywood film industry would be best served by &quot;accommodating&quot; the emerging popularity of television, envisioning a division of mass entertainment function: TV would do small scale, low-budget productions dealing with &quot;intimate things,&quot; while the motion picture studios would provide &quot;the bigger, broader type of film.&quot; LeRoy&#x27;s turn to &quot;gigantic spectacle&quot; coincided with the early onset of Hollywood&#x27;s relative decline, as described by film historians Charles Higham and Joel Greenberg:

Logistically, Quo Vadis presented an &quot;enormity.&quot; Filmed at the Cinecittà Studios in Rome, the production required the mobilization of tens of thousands of extras, more than nine months of shooting and an immense financial risk for M-G-M.

The huge investment in time and money paid off: Second only to &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939) in gross earnings, &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; garnered eight Academy Award nominations in 1952.

LeRoy welcomed the services of an American Jesuit priest assigned to act as a technical adviser on the production. The director was granted a personal audience with Pope Pius XII and, upon LeRoy&#x27;s request, the Pope blessed the script of &quot;Quo Vadis.&quot;

=== Musicals and romantic comedies: 1952–1954 ===

In the aftermath of his successful epic &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, LeRoy turned away from spectacles to lighter productions:

Lovely to Look At (1952): A re-make of the 1935 Astaire-Rogers musical scored by Jerome Kern, &quot;Roberta&quot;, directed by William A. Seiter. Vincente Minnelli organized the extravagant fashion show finale, with costumes by Adrian

Million Dollar Mermaid (1952): An aquatic-themed biopic loosely based on the life of Australian swimmer Annette Kellerman, portrayed by Esther Williams and aided by LeRoy&#x27;s &quot;competent direction.&quot; Busby Berkeley stages his lavishly produced underwater Oyster ballet.

&quot;Latin Lovers&quot; (1953): A romantic musical comedy starring Lana Turner and Ricardo Montalbán.

&quot;Rose Marie&quot; (1954): An adaptation of a stage operetta by Otto Harbach and previously filmed by M-G-M in silent and sound versions, the LeRoy adaptation starred Ann Blyth and Howard Keel. his final effort with M-G-M before he returned to Warner Brothers.

LeRoy attributes his disaffection from M-G-M to a professional incompatibility with Dore Schary, who had recently replaced Louis B. Mayer as head of production: &quot;[Schary] and I never really did see eye-to-eye on most things...since he was then running the studio, it didn&#x27;t seem to make much sense for me to stick around.&quot;

== Return to Warner Brothers: 1955–1959 ==

After completing his last production featuring Greer Garson in &quot;Strange Lady in Town&quot; (1955), LeRoy turned largely to adapting Broadway successes, serving as producer and director and often enlisting casts from the original stage productions.

=== &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; (1955) ===

Warners tasked LeRoy and Joshua Logan with completing &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; after the original director John Ford was hospitalized with a gallbladder disorder and removed from the production. Ford&#x27;s departure and substitution proved to be fortuitous. Henry Fonda, who played the lead character, was a screen star in several Ford pictures, as well as the lead actor in the highly acclaimed, 1948 Broadway production of &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;. Fonda had been at odds with Ford&#x27;s film adaptation: the two engaged in a demoralizing contretemps that threatened to undermine the project.

&quot;Mister Roberts&quot; enjoyed immense popular and financial film success for Warners and earned supporting actor Jack Lemmon his first Oscar.

== Return to director-producer ==

LeRoy assumed the dual role of director-producer in the late Fifties and Sixties, during the declining period of the Hollywood Golden Age. He primarily worked at Warner Studios, but also 20th Century Fox, Columbia and Universal. Critic Kingsley Canham offers the following appraisal of LeRoy&#x27;s work in this period:

 Despite these developments, LeRoy remained a profitable asset in the film industry.

&quot;The Bad Seed&quot; (1956): The film is based on a story by William March about a disturbed eleven-year-old girl whose murderous behavior is credited to her genetic heritage: she is the granddaughter of a notorious serial killer. Maxwell Anderson&#x27;s 1954 stage production enjoyed success and LeRoy imported most of the cast for his film adaptation, including child actor Patty McCormick. The Motion Picture Production Code required that the child murderess perish for her crimes, and LeRoy dispatches her with a lightning bolt. LeRoy recounts his struggle with censors:

The highly profitable &quot;Bad Seed&quot; garnered Academy Award nominations for several of the principal cast and cinematographer Harold Rosson.

Toward the Unknown (1956): A sympathetic dramatization of a former Korean War POW, played by William Holden, who struggles to recover from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and return to service as a test pilot in the U.S. Air Force.

&quot;No Time for Sergeants&quot; (1958): Novelist Mac Hyman&#x27;s hillbilly protagonist Will Stockdale gained popularity in comic book form and was adapted to the stage by Ira Levin. Andy Griffith played the lead and Nick Adams his sidekick in LeRoy&#x27;s film adaptation.

&quot;Home Before Dark&quot; (1958): Based on a story and screenplay by Robert and Eileen Bassing, LeRoy examines the struggle of a former mental patient (Jean Simmons) to normalize her relationships with her husband (Dan O&#x27;Herlihy), who she suspects of having an affair with her half-sister (Rhonda Fleming).

The FBI Story (1959): A hagiographic review of federal law enforcement figure Chip Hardesty, vetted by LeRoy&#x27;s close personal friend and FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, and starring James Stewart. For his services in directing and producing &quot;The FBI Story,&quot; the agency honored LeRoy with its Distinguished Service Award.

&quot;Wake Me When It&#x27;s Over&quot; (1960), 20th Century Fox: A comedy-of-errors, starring Ernie Kovacs and Dick Shawn, involving the appropriation of post-WWII army surplus to build a resort on a remote Japanese island occupied by US troops.

The Devil at 4 O&#x27;Clock (1961), Columbia Pictures: A priest (Spencer Tracy) and a convict (Frank Sinatra) join forces to rescue children from a leper colony when a volcano eruption threatens their Polynesian island.

&quot;A Majority of One&quot; (1961): Warner Brothers: An adaptation of the successful Leonard Spigelgass play directed by Dore Schary. Stage actors Gertrude Berg and Cedric Hardwicke were replaced by producer Jack L. Warner with film stars Rosalind Russell and Alec Guinness as the romantic leads, and the story set in Japan.

&quot;Gypsy&quot; (1962), Warner Brothers: LeRoy returned to musicals with a portrayal of the young Gypsy Rose Lee in her early career as a burlesque stripper, played by Natalie Wood, with Rosalind Russell as Lee&#x27;s domineering stage mother.

Moment to Moment (1965), Universal: LeRoy&#x27;s last credited directorial effort, &quot;Moment to Moment&quot; starring Jean Seberg and Honor Blackman.

Following &quot;Moment to Moment,&quot; disputes with Universal production head Edward Muhl over studio-proposed screenplays led to LeRoy&#x27;s return to Warner Brothers under Jack Warner&#x27;s auspices. There LeRoy embarked on several projects, including pre-production for an adaptation of James Thurber&#x27;s &quot;The 13 Clocks,&quot; a tale that LeRoy believed &quot;had the makings of another &quot;Wizard of Oz.&quot; When Warners was purchased by The McKinney Company, executives canceled the project and LeRoy quit the studio.

=== &quot;The Green Berets&quot; (1968): Uncredited adviser ===

LeRoy served for over five months as an uncredited adviser on the 1968 &quot;The Green Berets&quot;, co-directed by Ray Kellogg and John Wayne and based on Robin Moore&#x27;s 1965 collection of short stories.

The studio producing &quot;The Green Berets,&quot; Seven Arts, after recently acquiring Warners, were concerned that Wayne&#x27;s dual role as actor-director was beyond his abilities. LeRoy describes his enlistment in the project and the extent of his contribution:

LeRoy added that he &quot;was on the picture for five and a half months...I didn&#x27;t do it for nothing, of course, but I wouldn&#x27;t let them put my name on it, as I didn&#x27;t think that would be fair to Duke.&quot; LeRoy retired from Warners-Seven Arts shortly after completing &quot;The Green Berets,&quot; representing his directorial swan song.

LeRoy received an honorary Oscar in 1946 for &quot;The House I Live In,&quot; &quot;for tolerance short subject,&quot; and the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award in 1976.

A total of eight movies Mervyn LeRoy directed or co-directed were nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars, one of the highest numbers among all directors.

On February 8, 1960, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1560 Vine Street, for his contributions to the motion pictures industry.

== Casting discoveries ==

LeRoy has been credited with launching or advancing the careers of numerous actors in Hollywood films when he served as director or producer at Warner Brothers and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios. Biographer Kingsley Canham makes these observations:

Loretta Young: LeRoy&#x27;s discovery of Loretta Young (then Gretchen Young) presents at least two distinct origin tales: Ronald L. Bowers in &quot;Film Review&quot; [April 1969]) reported that LeRoy had directly solicited the 13-year-old Young in 1926 to play a juvenile part in &quot;Naughty but Nice&quot; (1927), a Colleen Moore vehicle for which Young received $80.00.

LeRoy, in his memoir &quot;Take One,&quot; offers a variation of this origin story: In 1930, LeRoy reports that he recruited Young through the auspices of her mother. LeRoy needed a leading lady to play opposite Grant Withers in &quot;Too Young to Marry&quot; (1931). Young&#x27;s older half-sister (stage name Sally Blane) was engaged on another film, and her mother offered the younger daughter, Gretchen, as a substitute. LeRoy agreed, but changed her name to Loretta.

Clark Gable: Warner Brothers studio cast Edward G. Robinson in the role of gangster Rico Bandello in Little Caesar (1930), but LeRoy was anxious to cast the part of racketeer Joe Masara. Rejecting Warners offer of Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., LeRoy spotted Gable in a touring production of &quot;The Last Mile&quot; at the Majestic Theatre in Los Angeles in the role of Killer Mears, and arranged a screen test with the stage actor. Pleased with the results, LeRoy championed Gable to producers Darryl Zanuck and Jack L. Warner for the part: they emphatically rejected the prospect, objecting to his relatively large ears. LeRoy declined the opportunity to sign Gable in a personal contract, which he would later regret. Despite this, Gable credited LeRoy for elevating his prospects in Hollywood: &quot;He always gave me credit for discovering him.&quot; As LeRoy shared in an interview with John Gillett in 1970: &quot;I always tried to help young players- Clark Gable would have been in &quot;Little Caesar&quot;, but the front office thought his ears were too big.&quot;

Jane Wyman: LeRoy claims Wyman as one of his discoveries, though she had already been signed by Jack L. Warner at the age of 16, though not yet cast in a production. She was selected by LeRoy to play a bit part in his 1933 &quot;Elmer, the Great&quot;. LeRoy recalled his first encounter with the actress:

Lana Turner: At age fifteen, the then Judy Turner was auditioned by LeRoy in his effort to cast an actor to play Mary Clay in the 1937 social drama &quot;They Won&#x27;t Forget&quot;. According to LeRoy&#x27;s recollections, Turner was introduced to him as a prospect by Warner Brothers casting director Solly Baianno. LeRoy changed her name to Lana (pronounced LAW-nuh) Turner and personally groomed Turner for stardom. LeRoy would also direct Turner in his 1948 &quot;Homecoming&quot;, co-starring Clark Gable.

Audrey Hepburn: During casting for M-G-M&#x27;s 1950 biblical epic &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; LeRoy sought an unknown actress for the role of Lygia, the young Christian loved by centurion Marcus Vinicius, played by (Robert Taylor). Audrey Hepburn was among hundreds of aspirants who were tested for the part. LeRoy reports in his memoir that he personally championed Hepburn as a &quot;sensational&quot; pick for the role, but the studio declined.

Robert Mitchum: LeRoy singled out 27-year-old Mitchum among the extras during the shooting of &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; (1944), casting him to play one of the crew of the &quot;Ruptured Duck&quot;, a B-25 bomber. This was Mitchum&#x27;s first role on screen, but M-G-M declined to sign him, despite LeRoy&#x27;s urging. Mitchum starred with Greer Garson in &quot;Desire Me&quot; (1947), for which LeRoy&#x27;s directorial contribution went uncredited.

Sophia Loren: According to LeRoy, actress Sophia Loren credits him with launching her film career. LeRoy had noticed the 16-year-old Loren among the extras assembled for a crowd scene in &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, placing her in a prominent position where his cameras would &quot;pick up this tall, Italian dark-eyed beauty.&quot; Years later, Loren personally thanked him: &quot;My Mother and I needed the money and you hired us. None of [my film career] would have happened except for you.&quot;

== Personal life ==

LeRoy married three times and had many relationships with Hollywood actresses. He was first married to Edna Murphy in 1927, which ended in divorce in 1932. During their separation, LeRoy dated Ginger Rogers, but they ended the relationship and stayed lifelong friends. In 1934, he married Doris Warner, the daughter of Warner Bros. founder, Harry Warner. The couple had one son, Warner LeRoy and one daughter, Linda LeRoy Janklow, who is married to Morton L. Janklow. His son, Warner LeRoy, became a restaurateur. The marriage ended in divorce in 1942. In 1946, he married Kathryn &quot;Kitty&quot; Prest Rend, who had been previously married to Sidney M. Spiegel (the co-founder of Essaness Theatres and grandson of Joseph Spiegel); and to restaurateur Ernie Byfield. They remained married until his death. LeRoy also sold his Bel Air, Los Angeles, home to Johnny Carson.

=== Other interests ===
A fan of thoroughbred horse racing, Mervyn LeRoy was a founding member of the Hollywood Turf Club, operator of the Hollywood Park Racetrack and a member of the track&#x27;s board of directors from 1941 until his death in 1987. In partnership with father-in-law, Harry Warner, he operated a racing stable, W-L Ranch Co., during the 1940s/50s.

== Death ==

After being bedridden for six months, LeRoy died of heart issues complicated by Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in Beverly Hills, California on September 13, 1987, at the age of 86. He was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. He was remembered by the New York Times as &quot;the versatile movie director of such explosive dramas as &quot;Little Caesar&quot; and &quot;I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang&quot; and such lush romances as &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot; and &quot;Random Harvest.&quot;

<doc id="147360" wikidata="Q200769" url="?curid=147360" title="The Flying Burrito Brothers">
<text>The Flying Burrito Brothers are an American country rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1968, best known for their influential 1969 debut album, &quot;The Gilded Palace of Sin&quot;. Although the group is known for its connection to band founders Gram Parsons and Chris Hillman (both formerly of The Byrds), the group underwent many personnel changes and has existed in various incarnations. Now officially known as The Burrito Brothers the band continues to perform and record new albums.

==Early evolution (1968–1969)==
Ian Dunlop and Mickey Gauvin, formerly of Gram Parsons&#x27; International Submarine Band (ISB), founded the original Flying Burrito Brothers and named it after Parsons informed them of his new country focus. This incarnation of the band never recorded as such, and after heading East allowed Gram Parsons to take the name.

With the original incarnation of the band out of the picture, the &quot;West Coast&quot; Flying Burrito Brothers were founded in 1968 in Los Angeles, California, by Gram Parsons and Chris Hillman. Bassist/keyboardist Chris Ethridge (who had played alongside Parsons in the International Submarine Band), pedal steel guitarist &quot;Sneaky&quot; Pete Kleinow and session drummer &quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Hoh rounded out the lineup.

==Classic era (1968-1972)==

Though Hillman and Roger McGuinn had fired Parsons from the Byrds in July 1968, the bassist and Parsons reconciled later that year after Hillman (who would switch to rhythm guitar in the new ensemble) left the group. Parsons had refused to join his Byrds bandmates for a tour of South Africa, citing his disapproval of the apartheid policy of that nation&#x27;s government. Hillman doubted the sincerity of Parsons&#x27; gesture, believing instead that the singer merely wanted to remain in England with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, whom he had recently befriended.

The Flying Burrito Brothers recorded their debut album, &quot;The Gilded Palace of Sin&quot; (containing originals by Parsons, Hillman, and Ethridge alongside covers of two songs by the venerable Southern soul songwriting duo of Dan Penn and Chips Moman), without a regular drummer. Hoh proved to be unable to perform adequately due to a substance abuse problem and was dismissed after recording two songs, leading the group to employ a variety of session players, including former International Submarine Band drummer Jon Corneal (who briefly joined the group as an official member, appearing on a plurality of the tracks) and Popeye Phillips of Dr. Hook &amp; the Medicine Show. Before commencing their first tour, the group ultimately settled upon original Byrd Michael Clarke (who had recently been working with fellow country rock pioneers and Byrds spinoff The Dillard and Clark Expedition) as a permanent replacement. He remained the band&#x27;s permanent drummer until 1971.

Despite widespread critical acclaim upon its release in February 1969 (as exemplified by Stanley Booth&#x27;s laudatory review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and positive press remarks by Bob Dylan) for its pioneering amalgamation of country, soul music, and psychedelic rock, &quot;The Gilded Palace of Sin&quot; stalled at No. 164 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. Although the band declined an invitation to perform at Woodstock, a comprehensive train tour of the United States (necessitated by Parsons&#x27; fear of flying) ultimately ended in disaster due to drug and alcohol use. Dissatisfied by the band&#x27;s lack of success and unable to fully reconcile his predilection for R&amp;B with the more conservative tastes of Parsons and Hillman, Ethridge departed the group in the autumn of 1969. Hillman reverted to bass after the band hired lead guitarist Bernie Leadon, a Dillard and Clark veteran who had also played with Hillman in the early 1960s bluegrass scene. This iteration of the band performed at the ill-fated Altamont Free Concert in December 1969, as documented in the film &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;. The audience remained largely peaceful throughout their performance.

With mounting debt incurred from the first album and tour and a failed single (&quot;The Train Song,&quot; written on the tour and produced by 1950s R&amp;B musicians Larry Williams and Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson), A&amp;M Records hoped to recoup some of their losses by marketing the Burritos as a straight country group. To this end, manager Jim Dickson instigated a loose session where the band recorded several traditional country staples from their live act (including songs by Merle Haggard and Buck Owens), contemporary pop covers in a countrified vein (&quot;To Love Somebody&quot;, &quot;Lodi&quot;, &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot;, &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot;), and Williams&#x27;s rock and roll classic &quot;Bony Moronie.&quot; This effort was soon scrapped in favor of a second album of originals on an extremely reduced budget. Several of the tracks from the abandoned sessions would eventually see the light of day in 1976 on &quot;Sleepless Nights&quot;, which also featured outtakes from Parsons&#x27;s post-Burritos solo career.

Released in April 1970, &quot;Burrito Deluxe&quot; juxtaposed the band&#x27;s inability to develop compelling new material (partially exacerbated by Parsons&#x27; hedonistic streak; his &quot;Lazy Days&quot; dated from 1967) with prominent covers of the Rolling Stones&#x27;s hitherto unreleased &quot;Wild Horses,&quot; Dylan&#x27;s &quot;If You Gotta Go, Go Now&quot; and the Southern gospel standard &quot;Farther Along.&quot; Unlike &quot;Gilded Palace&quot;, the album failed to chart entirely. A month later, Parsons showed up for a band performance only minutes before they were to take the stage. Visibly intoxicated, he began singing songs that differed from what the rest of the band were performing. A furious Hillman (already incensed by the singer&#x27;s penchant for showing up at $500 concerts in a limousine and increasingly Jagger-influenced showmanship) fired him immediately after the show, to which Parsons responded, &quot;You can&#x27;t fire me, I&#x27;m Gram!&quot; According to Hillman, this incident was merely the final straw; Parsons&#x27; desire to hang out with the Rolling Stones rather than focus on his own band&#x27;s career was also a significant factor, mirroring his 1968 dismissal from The Byrds.

Now fronted by Hillman and Leadon, the band appeared in June–July 1970 on the Festival Express rail tour of Canada with Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead, The Band, and other notable groups of the era. Parsons would eventually be replaced by guitarist/songwriter Rick Roberts. The new lineup released &quot;The Flying Burrito Bros&quot; in June 1971. Like its predecessors, it was not a commercial success, peaking at No. 176 in the United States. Shortly thereafter, Kleinow left to work as a session musician, while Leadon departed to co-found The Eagles. Al Perkins and Kenny Wertz replaced them for a final tour in autumn of 1971; during these performances, veteran bluegrass musicians Roger Bush (acoustic bass, vocals) and Byron Berline (fiddle) of Country Gazette participated as guests during an acoustic interlude. The band released &quot;Last of the Red Hot Burritos&quot;, a well-received live album culled from the tour, in May 1972.

The band dissolved immediately thereafter when Hillman and Perkins joined Stephen Stills&#x27;s Manassas. Berline, Bush and Wertz continued with their own band, Country Gazette. Roberts assumed corporate ownership of the band from Hillman in October 1972 and assembled a makeshift lineup to fulfill contractual commitments for some 1973 European live shows. He briefly initiated a solo career before forming Firefall with Clarke.

==Later configurations (1974–present)==
===1974–1980===
As Parsons&#x27;s influence and fame grew, so did interest in the Flying Burrito Brothers. This newfound popularity led to the release of &quot;Close Up the Honky Tonks&quot; in 1974, a double-LP compilation of album tracks, B-sides, and outtakes. Soon after, Kleinow and Ethridge put together a new incarnation of the band. When asked in 1972 about the band continuing without him, Parsons remarked, &quot;The idea&#x27;ll keep going on. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s dead or anything. Whether I do it or anybody else does it, it&#x27;s got to keep going.&quot; Frequent Ethridge collaborator and former Canned Heat guitarist Joel Scott Hill, longtime country rock fiddle player and guitarist Gib Guilbeau and erstwhile Byrd multi-instrumentalist Gene Parsons also joined the group. Augmented by songwriter and session luminary Spooner Oldham from the Dan Penn/FAME Studios axis, the band released &quot;Flying Again&quot; on Columbia Records later that year. Dominated by contributions from Guilbeau, Parsons and Penn (including the single &quot;Building Fires,&quot; a collaboration between Penn, &quot;Always on My Mind&quot; co-writer Johnny Christopher and maverick Memphis musical artist Jim Dickinson), the album was the most commercially successful effort by any iteration of the band, peaking at No. 138 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart.

Ethridge was replaced by Byrds alumnus Skip Battin for the 1976 album &quot;Airborne&quot;. However, the lineup continued to evolve for the rest of the 1970s, with the band even releasing an album under the name Sierra while continuing to play shows as the Flying Burrito Brothers. In 1980, they had the first of several minor country hits with a version of Merle Haggard&#x27;s &quot;White Line Fever&quot; from their album &quot;Live in Tokyo&quot;, released the previous year.

===1980–2000===
The early 1980s were a period of commercial success for the band. Curb Records encouraged the band to change its name and for most of the decade they were known simply as &quot;Burrito Brothers.&quot; Gib Guilbeau reconnected with his bandmate from Swampwater, songwriter and guitarist John Beland. The two, initially along with Skip Battin and Sneaky Pete Kleinow, began moving the band&#x27;s sound to a more radio friendly direction. Finally, the Burrito Brothers began to score well on the country charts. Skip Battin left shortly before the release of &quot;Hearts on the Line&quot; in 1981 due to the band&#x27;s new direction. The album contained two Top 20 country hits, marking the first significant commercial chart success the band ever had. In 1981 they received the &quot;Billboard&quot; award for &quot;Best New Crossover Group&quot; from pop to country. The Burrito Brothers continued to work with the top session players in Nashville and Los Angeles, logging an impressive list of singles for Curb Records. In the 1980s they toured Europe, were featured at the Albi Nashville Festival in Albi, France, and performed with Emmylou Harris, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Tammy Wynette at London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium. Also in the early 1980s, the Burrito Brothers were responsible for a campaign that finally saw Lefty Frizzell inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. In 1982, Kleinow, the sole original member, departed prior to the release of &quot;Sunset Sundown&quot;. In 1984, Beland and Guilbeau retired the Burritos and afforded Kleinow the chance to re-form essentially the late 1970s lineup with Skip Battin and Greg Harris, which continued to tour and release live albums for the rest of the 1980s.

In 1991 a lineup consisting of Beland, Guilbeau, Ethridge, Kleinow, and Australian singer Brian Cadd began work on a new album, &quot;Eye of a Hurricane&quot;. The band went without a regular drummer and used session drummer Ron Tutt, who had previously played with Elvis Presley. The band soon parted ways with Ethridge (for the third time) and Cadd. Ethridge was replaced by Larry Patton, and Gary Kubal was added as a full-time drummer. This lineup released &quot;California Jukebox&quot; in 1997. At this time Gib Guilbeau and Kleinow stopped working with the group because of health concerns. Kleinow was replaced by Wayne Bridge. In 1999, the band released &quot;Sons of the Golden West&quot;, which, while receiving solid critical reviews, would prove to be the final album by the Flying Burrito Brothers, as Beland decided to end the band shortly after the turn of the millennium.

2000-2010

Sneaky Pete Kleinow then created a new Burrito project in 2002. This band was called Burrito Deluxe, because Beland still had rights to the original name at that time. This band featured Carlton Moody on lead vocals and Garth Hudson from the Band on keyboards. The first album of this incarnation, &quot;Georgia Peach&quot;, was conceived as a tribute to Gram Parsons. Kleinow left the band because of illness in 2005, leaving no direct lineage to any of the original 1969–1972 lineup. His final recordings appear on their 2007 album &quot;Disciples of the Truth&quot;. 

2010 to present 
In 2010, an English record label owner, Del Taylor, attempted to reactivate the band with any previous members he could find. Bernie Leadon, Chris Ethridge, Al Perkins, and Gene Parsons all agreed if Chris Hillman would join. Hillman was not interested in the project and instead took steps to acquire the rights to the name &quot;The Flying Burrito Brothers&quot; so that he could retire the band. 

In 2011, a new lineup arose which included Walter Egan and Rick Lonow (from the remains of Burrito Deluxe) along with Fred and Chris P James This lineup toured as &quot;The Burritos&quot; and released the album &quot;Sound As Ever.(SPV Records)&quot; The album included an unfinished Gram Parsons song which would go on to be a trademark of the Chris James-era albums. After the last members of Burrito Deluxe left, and with no objection from Hillman, (so long as the word flying wasn&#x27;t used), the band trade marked and reverted to &quot;The Burrito Brothers&quot; and continued to tour and record. 

2012: Rusty Russell joins on bass. Band works live dates. 

2013: James, James, Lonow and Russell are joined by Tony Paoletta on pedal steel. 

2014-16: James, James, Paoletta, Jody Maphis and Peter Young are the working band on live dates. Ronnie Guilbeau and Walter Egan are occasional guests. 

2017: Nashville session guitarist, Bob Hatter joins the group after Fred James departs. Hatter has previous history with Chris James in Mr. Hyde (with Boomer Castleman) and The Lost Sideshow (with Rick Lonow and Michael Webb). Bob logged in endless hours with Tony Paoletta and Peter Young (also regular session men). These Burritos work on new material for their next album. 

2018: The Burrito Brothers complete the “Still Going Strong” album. They play scattered dates, spending most of the year recording the album at Junction Studio in Madison, TN. Lineup: James, Paoletta, Hatter, John Sturdivant Jr, Larry Marrs, Coley Hinson. 

2019: The group is Chris P James, Tony Paoletta, Bob Hatter and Peter Young returns.

To commemorate the 50th anniversary of “The Gilded Palace of Sin”, The Burrito Brothers headline Will James&#x27; 12th annual Nashville Tribute to Gram Parsons playing the classic LP in its entirety, something no other incarnation of the band had ever done. Guests include: Ronnie Guilbeau, Walter Egan, Michael Curtis, Noah Bellamy, Larry Patton, Pamela Des Barres. The band writes, demos and records material for their next album. It is finished before the year ends. Their representative in England, Bob Boiling, gets them a worldwide deal with SFM Records. 

2020: The group continues as Chris P James, Tony Paoletta, Bob Hatter and Peter Young. “The Notorious Burrito Brothers&quot; is released worldwide on 6 March 2020 on CD and all other formats (except vinyl) through ‘Store For Music’ [Cat # SFMCD543] in Britain. Ronnie Guilbeau guests. Forward progress is halted due to the global pandemic. All tour dates cancelled. The group begins writing and recording demos for their next album.
Bob Hatter is stricken with cancer. The hope is to still record the next album with him via remote equipment brought to his house. This process is greatly hindered by the pandemic.

2021: James, Paoletta, Hatter and Young begin recording the next album. Progress is slow due to Hatter’s condition and the ongoing pandemic. Bob Hatter passes away on August 31st. The group halts recording.

2022: Ready to get back into creative work, James, Paoletta and Young enlist the brilliant guitarist and multi-instrumentalist, Steve Allen to complete recording the unfinished album. Tour dates are still on hold (as the pandemic hasn’t subsided).
The album, “Together”, is completed. Bob Hatter is listed (one last time, in his honor) as a member of The Burrito Brothers. Steve Allen is credited as a special guest.
2023: James, Paoletta, Young &amp; Allen are The Burrito Brothers. The album “Together” is released on SFM Records (England and worldwide), followed in October by &#x27;Christmas&#x27; the band&#x27;s first ever Christmas album

<text>George Cooper Stevens (December 18, 1904 – March 8, 1975) was an American film director, producer, screenwriter and cinematographer. He received two Academy Awards and the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award in 1953.

He won the Academy Award for Best Director for &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; (1951), and &quot;Giant&quot; (1956). He was also Oscar-nominated for &quot;The Talk of the Town&quot;, &quot;The More the Merrier&quot; (1943), &quot;Shane&quot; (1953), and &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; (1959). Among his most notable films are &quot;Swing Time&quot; (1936), &quot;Gunga Din&quot; (1939), &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; (1942), and &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965).

==Early life ==
Stevens was born on December 18, 1904, in Oakland, California, the son of Landers Stevens and Georgie Cooper, both stage actors. Drama critic Ashton Stevens and film director James W. Horne were his uncles. He also had two brothers, Jack, a cinematographer, and writer Aston Stevens. He learned about the stage by watching his parents, and himself, acting in plays in San Francisco. At the age of 10, his mother gave him a Brownie camera, and he began photographing the city and portraits of his mother.

== Career ==
=== 1930–1939 ===
At the age of 17, Hal Roach Studios employed Stevens as an assistant cameraman filming Rex the Wonder Horse in Utah. Stevens helped grant Stan Laurel a film career, as the studio had trouble getting the comedian&#x27;s blue eyes to register on film, but Stevens made a successful test of him using panchromatic film. He worked as director of photography and a gag writer on 35 Laurel and Hardy short films, such as &quot;Bacon Grabbers&quot; (1929) and &quot;Night Owls&quot; (1930); according to Stevens he learned from this experience that comedy could be &quot;graceful and human&quot;. In 1928, he met Yvonne Howell in Oliver Hardy&#x27;s home; they were married on January 1, 1930. In the early 1930s, Stevens began to disagree with Roach&#x27;s studio, wanting to flesh out characters rather than just make slapstick comedy. This led to a suspension and his departure from the studio. In 1933, he directed his first feature film, &quot;The Cohens and Kellys in Trouble&quot;, for Universal Pictures.

In 1934, Stevens was hired by RKO Pictures, and he directed the slapstick film &quot;Kentucky Kernels&quot;, starring Wheeler and Woolsey. His big break came when he directed Katharine Hepburn the next year in &quot;Alice Adams&quot;; according to Hepburn, Stevens felt that she got him the job. He would subsequently make seven films for the studio in five years. In the late 1930s, he directed Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers together in the musical &quot;Swing Time&quot; and separately in &quot;A Damsel in Distress&quot; and &quot;Vivacious Lady&quot;, respectively. In 1939, Stevens directed Cary Grant in the large-scale &quot;Gunga Din&quot;, costing over $1 million as RKO&#x27;s most expensive film to date; though the studio feared its ballooning budget, it ended up a profitable success.

=== 1940–1949 ===

In 1940, he directed Carole Lombard in &quot;Vigil in the Night&quot;. In 1942, he reunited with Hepburn at her behest to film &quot;Woman of the Year&quot;. Stevens served as president of the Screen Directors Guild (SDG) from 1941 to 1943. He directed the romantic comedy &quot;The More the Merrier&quot; starring Jean Arthur, Joel McCrea and Charles Coburn for which he received an Academy Award for Best Director nomination losing to Michael Curtiz for &quot;Casablanca&quot;. After seeing the Nazi propaganda film &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; (1935), he was provoked to join the Allied forces in World War II.

He joined the U.S. Army Signal Corps and headed a film unit from 1943 to 1946, under General Dwight D. Eisenhower. His unit shot footage—including the only color film of the war in Europe (which remained archived for decades)—documenting the Normandy landings (D-Day), the liberation of Paris, the meeting of American and Soviet forces at the Elbe River, and the Allied discovery of both the Duben labor camp and Dachau concentration camp. Stevens helped prepare the Duben and Dachau footage and other material for presentation during the Nuremberg Trials; this was released as the hour-long &quot;Nazi Concentration&quot; &quot;Camps&quot; (1945). In 2008, Stevens&#x27;s footage was entered into the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as an &quot;essential visual record&quot; of the war. In 1946, Stevens resumed his duties as president of the SDG, remaining so until 1948. As a result of his experiences during the war, his films became more dramatic. The drama &quot;I Remember Mama&quot; (1948) was only partly comedic.

=== 1950–1975 ===
In 1950, during the McCarthyist scare and related Hollywood blacklist, Stevens defended Joseph L. Mankiewicz from Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s attempt to recall him as president of the SDG. Stevens went on to direct and earn two Academy Awards for Best Director for &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; (1951) starring Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor, the epic Western drama &quot;Giant&quot; (1956) starring Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson and James Dean. For those films he also earned nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Director.

Stevens also directed the Western &quot;Shane&quot; (1953) starring Alan Ladd and Jean Arthur, the biographical Holocaust drama &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; (1959), and his biblical epic of Jesus, &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965). In 1960 he earned the Directors Guild of America Lifetime Achievement Award. That same year he earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He ended his directing career with the 1970 romantic comedy-drama &quot;The Only Game in Town&quot; with Warren Beatty and Elizabeth Taylor. That year, he was head of the jury at the 20th Berlin International Film Festival, which ended in scandal. In 1973, he was a member of the jury at the 8th Moscow International Film Festival.

==Personal life==
During his time filming wild horses with Hal Roach Studios in Utah, Stevens bonded with the Comanche.
Stevens was the father of television and film writer-producer-director George Stevens, Jr., the founder of the American Film Institute (AFI). George Jr. produced and directed the documentary about his father &quot;George Stevens: A Filmmaker&#x27;s Journey&quot; in 1984 and is the father of Stevens&#x27;s grandson Michael Stevens (1966–2015), who was also a television and film producer-director.

==Death==
Stevens died following a heart attack on March 8, 1975, on his ranch in Lancaster, California, north of Los Angeles. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles.

He was also nominated in 1943 for &quot;The More the Merrier&quot;, in 1954 for &quot;Shane&quot;, and in 1959 for &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;.

He also received both the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (1954). He also received the National Board of Review Award for Best Director and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Director.

<text>Aretha Louise Franklin ( ; March 25, 1942 – August 16, 2018) was an American singer, songwriter and pianist. Honored as the &quot;Queen of Soul&quot;, she was twice named by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine as the greatest singer of all time.

As a child, Franklin was noticed for her gospel singing at New Bethel Baptist Church in Detroit, Michigan, where her father C. L. Franklin was a minister. At the age of 18, she was signed as a recording artist for Columbia Records. While her career did not immediately flourish, Franklin found acclaim and commercial success once she signed with Atlantic Records in 1966. She recorded albums such as &quot;I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You&quot; (1967), &quot;Lady Soul&quot; (1968), &quot;Spirit in the Dark&quot; (1970), &quot;Young, Gifted and Black&quot; (1972), &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; (1972), and &quot;Sparkle&quot; (1976), before experiencing problems with the record company. Franklin left Atlantic in 1979 and signed with Arista Records. Her success continued with the albums &quot;Jump to It&quot; (1982), &quot;Who&#x27;s Zoomin&#x27; Who?&quot; (1985), &quot;Aretha&quot; (1986) and &quot;A Rose Is Still a Rose&quot; (1998).

Franklin is one of the best-selling music artists, with more than 75 million records sold worldwide. She charted 112 singles on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, including 73 Hot 100 entries, 17 top-ten pop singles, 96 R&amp;B entries and 20 number-one R&amp;B singles. Her best-known hits include &quot;I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)&quot; (1967), &quot;Respect&quot; (1967), &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot; (1967), &quot;Chain of Fools&quot; (1967), &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Way&quot; (1968), &quot;Think&quot; (1968), &quot;I Say a Little Prayer&quot; (1968), &quot;Call Me&quot; (1970), &quot;Don&#x27;t Play That Song (You Lied)&quot; (1970), &quot;Spanish Harlem&quot; (1971), &quot;Rock Steady&quot; (1971), &quot;Day Dreaming&quot; (1972), &quot;Until You Come Back to Me (That&#x27;s What I&#x27;m Gonna Do)&quot; (1973), &quot;Something He Can Feel&quot; (1976), &quot;Jump to It&quot; (1982), &quot;Freeway of Love&quot; (1985), &quot;Who&#x27;s Zoomin&#x27; Who&quot; (1985), &quot;I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)&quot; (a duet with George Michael, 1987) and &quot;A Rose Is Still a Rose&quot; (1998). She also made a featured appearance in the 1980 musical-comedy film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;.

Franklin received numerous honors throughout her career. She won 18 Grammy Awards out of 44 nominations, including the first eight awards given for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance (1968–1975), as well as a Grammy Living Legend Award and Lifetime Achievement Award. She was also awarded the National Medal of Arts and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 1987, she became the first female artist to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Her other inductions include the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005, the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2012, and posthumously the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2020. In 2019, the Pulitzer Prize jury awarded her a posthumous special citation &quot;for her indelible contribution to American music and culture for more than five decades&quot;.

==Early life==

Aretha Louise Franklin was born on March 25, 1942, to Barbara (née Siggers) and Clarence LaVaughn &quot;C. L.&quot; Franklin. She was delivered at her family&#x27;s home located at 406 Lucy Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee. Her father was a Baptist minister and circuit preacher originally from Shelby, Mississippi, while her mother was an accomplished piano player and vocalist. Both Mr. and Mrs. Franklin had children from prior relationships in addition to the four children they had together. When Aretha was two, the family relocated to Buffalo, New York. By the time Aretha turned five, C. L. Franklin had permanently relocated the family to Detroit, Michigan where he took over the pastorship of the New Bethel Baptist Church.

The Franklins had a troubled marriage due to Mr. Franklin&#x27;s infidelities, and they separated in 1948. At that time, Barbara Franklin returned to Buffalo with Aretha&#x27;s half-brother, Vaughn. After the separation, Aretha recalled seeing her mother in Buffalo during the summer, and Barbara Franklin frequently visited her children in Detroit. Aretha&#x27;s mother died of a heart attack on March 7, 1952, before Aretha&#x27;s 10th birthday. Several women, including Aretha&#x27;s grandmother, Rachel, and Mahalia Jackson, took turns helping with the children at the Franklin home. During this time, Aretha learned how to play piano by ear. She also attended public school in Detroit, going through her first year at Northern High School, but dropping out during her second year.

Aretha&#x27;s father&#x27;s emotionally driven sermons resulted in his being known as the man with the &quot;million-dollar voice&quot;. He earned thousands of dollars for sermons in various churches across the country. His fame led to his home being visited by various celebrities. Among the visitors were gospel musicians Clara Ward, James Cleveland, and early Caravans members Albertina Walker and Inez Andrews. Martin Luther King Jr., Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke all became friends of C. L. Franklin, as well. Ward was romantically involved with Aretha&#x27;s father from around 1949 until Ward&#x27;s death in 1973, though Aretha &quot;preferred to view them strictly as friends&quot;. Ward also served as a role model to the young Aretha.

==Musical career==
===1952–1960: Beginnings===
Just after her mother&#x27;s death, Franklin began singing solos at New Bethel Baptist Church, debuting with the hymn &quot;Jesus, Be a Fence Around Me&quot;. When Franklin was 12, her father began managing her; he would take her on the road with him, during his &quot;gospel caravan&quot; tours for her to perform in various churches. He also helped her sign her first recording deal with J.V.B. Records. Franklin was featured on vocals and piano. In 1956, J.V.B. released Franklin&#x27;s first single, &quot;Never Grow Old&quot;, backed with &quot;You Grow Closer&quot;. &quot;Precious Lord &quot; backed with &quot;Precious Lord &quot; followed in 1959. These four tracks, with the addition of &quot;There Is a Fountain Filled with Blood&quot;, were released on side one of the 1956 album, &quot;Spirituals&quot;. This was reissued by Battle Records in 1962, under the same title. In 1965, Checker Records released &quot;Songs of Faith&quot;, featuring the five tracks from the 1956 &quot;Spirituals&quot; album, with the addition of four previously unreleased recordings. Aretha was only 14 when &quot;Songs of Faith&quot; was recorded.

During this time, Franklin would occasionally travel with the Soul Stirrers. As a young gospel singer, Franklin spent summers on the gospel circuit in Chicago and stayed with Mavis Staples&#x27; family.
According to music producer Quincy Jones, while Franklin was still young, Dinah Washington let him know that &quot;Aretha was the &#x27;next one. Franklin and her father traveled to California, where she met singer Sam Cooke. At the age of 16, Franklin went on tour with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and she would ultimately sing at his funeral in 1968. Other influences in her youth included Marvin Gaye (who was a boyfriend of her sister), as well as Ray Charles and Sam Cooke, &quot;two of Franklin&#x27;s greatest influences&quot;. Also important was James Cleveland, known as the King of Gospel music, &quot;who helped to focus her early career as a gospel singer&quot;; Cleveland had been recruited by her father as a pianist for the Southern California Community Choir.

===1960–1966: Columbia years===
After turning 18, Franklin confided to her father that she aspired to follow Sam Cooke in recording pop music, and moved to New York. Serving as her manager, C. L. Franklin agreed to the move and helped to produce a two-song demo that soon was brought to the attention of Columbia Records, who agreed to sign her in 1960, as a &quot;five-percent artist&quot;. During this period, Franklin would be coached by choreographer Cholly Atkins to prepare for her pop performances. Before signing with Columbia, Sam Cooke tried to persuade Franklin&#x27;s father to sign her with his label, RCA Victor, but she had already decided to go with Columbia. Berry Gordy had also asked Franklin and her elder sister Erma to sign with his Tamla label, but C.L. Franklin turned Gordy down, as he felt Tamla was not yet an established label. Franklin&#x27;s first Columbia single, &quot;Today I Sing the Blues&quot;, was issued in September 1960 and later reached the top 10 of the Hot Rhythm &amp; Blues Sellers chart.

In January 1961, Columbia issued Franklin&#x27;s first album, &quot;&quot;. The album featured her first single to chart the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;Won&#x27;t Be Long&quot;, which also peaked at number 7 on the R&amp;B chart. Mostly produced by Clyde Otis, Franklin&#x27;s Columbia recordings saw her performing in diverse genres, such as standards, vocal jazz, blues, doo-wop and rhythm and blues. Before the year was out, Franklin scored her first hit-single with her rendition of the standard &quot;Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody&quot;. By the end of 1961, Franklin was named as a &quot;new-star female vocalist&quot; in &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine. In 1962, Columbia issued two more albums, &quot;The Electrifying Aretha Franklin&quot; and &quot;The Tender, the Moving, the Swinging Aretha Franklin&quot;, the latter of which reached number 69 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart.

In the 1960s, during a performance at the Regal Theater in Chicago, WVON radio personality Pervis Spann announced that Franklin should be crowned &quot;the Queen of Soul&quot;. Spann ceremonially placed a crown on her head. By 1964, Franklin began recording more pop music, reaching the top 10 on the R&amp;B chart with the ballad &quot;Runnin&#x27; Out of Fools&quot;, in early 1965. She had two R&amp;B charted singles in 1965 and 1966, with the songs &quot;One Step Ahead&quot; and &quot;Cry Like a Baby&quot;, while also reaching the Easy Listening charts with the ballads &quot;You Made Me Love You&quot; and &quot;(No, No) I&#x27;m Losing You&quot;. By the mid-1960s, Franklin was making $100,000 per year from countless performances in nightclubs and theaters. Also during that period, she appeared on rock-and-roll shows, such as &quot;Hollywood a Go-Go&quot; and &quot;Shindig!&quot; However, she struggled with commercial success while at Columbia. Label executive John H. Hammond later said he felt Columbia did not understand Franklin&#x27;s early gospel background and failed to bring that aspect out further during her period there.

===1966–1979: Atlantic years===

In November 1966, Franklin&#x27;s Columbia recording contract expired; at that time, she owed the company money because record sales had not met expectations. Producer Jerry Wexler convinced her to move to Atlantic Records. Wexler decided that he wanted to take advantage of her gospel background; his philosophy in general was to encourage a &quot;tenacious form of rhythm &amp; blues that became increasingly identified as soul&quot;. The Atlantic days would lead to a series of hits for Aretha Franklin from 1967 to early 1972; her rapport with Wexler helped in the creation of the majority of her peak recordings with Atlantic. The next seven years&#x27; achievements were less impressive. However, according to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;they weren&#x27;t as terrible as some claimed, they were pro forma and never reached for new heights&quot;.

In January 1967, Franklin traveled to Muscle Shoals, Alabama, to record at FAME Studios and recorded the song &quot;I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)&quot;, backed by the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. Franklin only spent one day recording at FAME, as an altercation broke out between her manager and husband Ted White, studio owner Rick Hall, and a horn player, and sessions were abandoned. The song was released the following month and reached number one on the R&amp;B chart, while also peaking at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, giving Franklin her first top-ten pop single. The song&#x27;s B-side, &quot;Do Right Woman, Do Right Man&quot;, reached the R&amp;B top 40, peaking at number 37. &quot;Respect&quot; was Otis Redding&#x27;s song but Aretha modified it with a &quot;supercharged interlude featuring the emphatic spelling-out of the song&#x27;s title&quot;. Her frenetic version was released in April and reached number one on both the R&amp;B and pop charts. &quot;Respect&quot; became her signature song and was later hailed as a civil rights and feminist anthem. Upon hearing her version, Otis Redding said admiringly: &quot;That little girl done took my song away from me.&quot; Franklin&#x27;s debut Atlantic album, &quot;I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You&quot;, also became commercially successful, later going gold. According to &quot;National Geographic&quot;, this recording &quot;would catapult Franklin to fame&quot;. Franklin scored two additional top-ten singles in 1967, &quot;Baby I Love You&quot; and &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot;.

Working with Wexler and Atlantic, Franklin had become &quot;the most successful singer in the nation&quot; by 1968. In 1968, Franklin issued the top-selling albums &quot;Lady Soul&quot; and &quot;Aretha Now&quot;, which included some of her most popular hit singles, including &quot;Chain of Fools&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Way&quot;, &quot;Think&quot;, and &quot;I Say a Little Prayer&quot;. That February, Franklin earned the first two of her Grammys, including the debut category for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance. On February 16, Franklin was honored with a day named for her and was greeted by longtime friend Martin Luther King Jr., who gave her the SCLC Drum Beat Award for Musicians two months before his death. Franklin toured outside the US for the first time in late April/May 1968, including an appearance at the Concertgebouw, Amsterdam, where she played to a near-hysterical audience who covered the stage with flower petals. She performed two concerts in London, at the Finsbury Park Astoria and the Hammersmith Odeon on May 11 and May 12. In June 1968, she appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine in a portrait illustration by Boris Chaliapin.
In March 1969, Franklin was unanimously voted winner of Académie du Jazz&#x27;s R&amp;B award, Prix Otis Redding, for her albums &quot;Lady Soul&quot;, &quot;Aretha Now&quot;, and &quot;Aretha in Paris&quot;. That year, Franklin was the subject of a criminal impersonation scheme. Another woman performed at several Florida venues under the name Aretha Franklin. Suspicion was drawn when the fake Franklin charged only a fraction of the expected rate to perform. Franklin&#x27;s lawyers contacted Florida authorities and uncovered a coercive scheme in which the singer, Vickie Jones, had been threatened with violence and constrained into impersonating her idol, whom she resembled closely both in voice and looks. After being cleared of wrongdoing, Jones subsequently enjoyed a brief career of her own, during which she was herself the subject of an impersonation.

Franklin&#x27;s success further expanded during the early 1970s, during which she recorded the multi-week R&amp;B number one &quot;Don&#x27;t Play That Song (You Lied)&quot;, as well as the top-ten singles &quot;Spanish Harlem&quot;, &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, and &quot;Day Dreaming&quot;. Some of these releases were from the acclaimed albums &quot;Spirit in the Dark&quot; (released in August 1970, in which month she again performed at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Odeon) and &quot;Young, Gifted and Black&quot; (released in early 1972). In 1971, Franklin became the first R&amp;B performer to headline Fillmore West, later that year releasing the live album &quot;Aretha Live at Fillmore West&quot;.

In January 1972, she returned to Gospel music in a two-night, live-church recording, with the album &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, in which she reinterpreted standards such as Mahalia Jackson&#x27;s &quot;How I Got Over&quot;. Originally released in June 1972, &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; sold more than two million copies, and is one of bestselling gospel albums of all time. The live performances were filmed for a concert film directed by Sydney Pollack, but due to synching problems and Franklin&#x27;s own attempts to prevent the film&#x27;s distribution after Hollywood refused to promote a dark-skinned black woman as a movie star at the time, the film&#x27;s release was only realized by producer Alan Elliott in November 2018.

Franklin&#x27;s career began to experience problems while recording the album &quot;Hey Now Hey&quot;, which featured production from Quincy Jones. Despite the success of the single &quot;Angel&quot;, the album bombed upon its release in 1973. Franklin continued having R&amp;B success with songs such as &quot;Until You Come Back to Me&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m in Love&quot;, but by 1975 her albums and songs were no longer top sellers. After Jerry Wexler left Atlantic for Warner Bros. Records in 1976, Franklin worked on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Sparkle&quot; with Curtis Mayfield. The album yielded Franklin&#x27;s final top-40 hit of the decade, &quot;Something He Can Feel&quot;, which also peaked at number one on the R&amp;B chart. Franklin&#x27;s follow-up albums for Atlantic, including &quot;Sweet Passion&quot; (1977), &quot;Almighty Fire&quot; (1978) and &quot;La Diva&quot; (1979), bombed on the charts, and in 1979 Franklin left the company. On November 7, 1979, she guested &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; with her yellow costume from her &quot;La Diva&quot; album, and sang &quot;Ladies Only&quot;, &quot;What If I Should Ever Need You&quot; and &quot;Yesterday&quot; by the Beatles.

===1980–2007: Arista years===

In 1980, after leaving Atlantic Records, Franklin signed with Clive Davis&#x27;s Arista Records. &quot;Davis was beguiling and had the golden touch&quot;, according to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. &quot;If anybody could rejuvenate Franklin&#x27;s puzzlingly stuck career, it was Davis.&quot; Also in 1980, Franklin gave a command performance at the London Palladium in front of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Franklin also had an acclaimed guest role as a soul food restaurant proprietor and wife of Matt &quot;Guitar&quot; Murphy in the 1980 comedy musical &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;. Franklin&#x27;s first Arista album, &quot;Aretha&quot; (1980), featured the number-three R&amp;B hit &quot;United Together&quot; and her Grammy-nominated cover of Redding&#x27;s &quot;I Can&#x27;t Turn You Loose&quot;. The follow-up, 1981&#x27;s &quot;Love All the Hurt Away&quot;, included her famed duet of the title track with George Benson, while the album also included her Grammy-winning cover of Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s &quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Comin&#x27;&quot;. Franklin achieved a gold record—for the first time in seven years—with the 1982 album &quot;Jump to It&quot;. The album&#x27;s title track was her first top-40 single on the pop charts in six years. The following year, she released &quot;Get It Right&quot;, produced by Luther Vandross.

In 1985, inspired by a desire to have a &quot;younger sound&quot; in her music, &quot;Who&#x27;s Zoomin&#x27; Who?&quot; became her first Arista album to be certified platinum. The album sold well over a million copies thanks to the hits &quot;Freeway of Love&quot;, the title track, and &quot;Another Night&quot;. The next year&#x27;s &quot;Aretha&quot; album nearly matched this success with the hit singles &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Lee&quot; and &quot;I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)&quot;, her international number-one duet with George Michael. During that period, Franklin provided vocals to the theme songs of the TV shows &quot;A Different World&quot; and &quot;Together&quot;. In 1987, she issued her third gospel album, &quot;One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism&quot;, which was recorded at her late father&#x27;s New Bethel church, followed by &quot;Through the Storm&quot; in 1989.

In 1987, Franklin performed &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; at WWE&#x27;s Wrestlemania III; one source states that &quot;to this day her WrestleMania III performance might be the most memorable&quot; of the event openers by many artists. After 1988, &quot;Franklin never again had huge hits&quot;, according to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The 1991 album &quot;What You See is What You Sweat&quot; flopped on the charts. She returned to the charts in 1993 with the dance song &quot;A Deeper Love&quot; and returned to the top 40 with the song &quot;Willing to Forgive&quot; in 1994. That recording reached number 26 on the Hot 100 and number five on the R&amp;B chart. In 1989, Franklin filmed a music video for a remake of &quot;Think&quot;. In 1990, she sang &quot;I Want to Be Happy&quot;, &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot;, and &quot;Someone Else&#x27;s Eyes&quot; at the &quot;MDA Labor Day Telethon&quot;. In 1995, she was selected to play Aunt Em in the Apollo Theater revival of &quot;The Wiz&quot;. Franklin&#x27;s final top 40 single was 1998&#x27;s &quot;A Rose Is Still a Rose&quot;. The album of the same name was released after the single. It sold over 500,000 copies, earning gold certification.
That same year, Franklin received global praise after her 1998 Grammy Awards performance. She had initially been asked to perform in honor of the 1980 film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, in which she appeared with Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. That evening, after the show had already begun, another performer, opera tenor Luciano Pavarotti became too ill to perform the aria &quot;Nessun dorma&quot; as planned. The show&#x27;s producers, desperate to fill the time slot, approached Franklin with their dilemma. She was a friend of Pavarotti and had sung the aria two nights prior at the annual MusiCares event. She asked to hear Pavarotti&#x27;s rehearsal recording, and after listening, agreed that she could sing it in the tenor range that the orchestra was prepared to play in. Over one billion people worldwide saw the performance, and she received an immediate standing ovation. She would go on to record the selection and perform it live several more times in the years to come. The last time she sang the aria live was for Pope Francis at the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia in September 2015. A small boy was so touched by her performance that he came onto the stage and embraced her while Franklin was still singing.

Her final Arista album, &quot;So Damn Happy&quot;, was released in 2003 and featured the Grammy-winning song &quot;Wonderful&quot;. In 2004, Franklin announced that she was leaving Arista after more than 20 years with the label. To complete her Arista obligations, Franklin issued the duets compilation album &quot;Jewels in the Crown: All-Star Duets with the Queen&quot; in 2007. In February 2006, she performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; with Aaron Neville and Dr. John for Super Bowl XL, held in her hometown of Detroit.

===2007–2018: Final years===
In 2008, Franklin issued the holiday album &quot;This Christmas, Aretha&quot; on DMI Records. On February 8, 2008, Franklin was honored as the MusiCares Person of the Year, and performed &quot;Never Gonna Break My Faith&quot;, which had won her the Grammy for best Gospel performance the year before. Twelve years later, an unheard performance of &quot;Never Gonna Break My Faith&quot; was released in June 2020 to commemorate Juneteenth with a new video visualizing the American human rights movement. This caused the song to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; gospel charts at number one, giving Franklin the distinction of having had a number one record in every decade since the 1960s. On November 18, 2008, she performed &quot;Respect&quot; and &quot;Chain of Fools&quot; at &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

On January 20, 2009, Franklin made international headlines for performing &quot;My Country, &#x27;Tis of Thee&quot; at President Barack Obama&#x27;s inaugural ceremony with her church hat becoming a popular topic online. In 2010, Franklin accepted an honorary degree from Yale University. In 2011, under her own label, Aretha&#x27;s Records, she issued the album &quot;&quot;.
In 2014, Franklin was signed under RCA Records, controller of the Arista catalog and a sister label to Columbia via Sony Music Entertainment, and worked with Clive Davis. There were plans for her to record an album produced by Danger Mouse, who was replaced with Babyface and Don Was when Danger Mouse left the project. On September 29, 2014, Franklin performed to a standing ovation, with Cissy Houston as backup, a compilation of Adele&#x27;s &quot;Rolling in the Deep&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough&quot; on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. Franklin&#x27;s cover of &quot;Rolling in the Deep&quot; was featured among nine other songs in her first RCA release, &quot;Aretha Franklin Sings the Great Diva Classics&quot;, released in October 2014. In doing so, she became the first woman to have 100 songs on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart with the success of her cover of Adele&#x27;s &quot;Rolling in the Deep&quot;, which debuted at number 47 on the chart.

In December 2015, Franklin gave an acclaimed performance of &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot; at the 2015 Kennedy Center Honors during the section for honoree Carole King, who co-wrote the song. During the swelling bridge of the song, Franklin dramatically dropped her fur coat from her shoulders to the stage, for which the audience rewarded her with a mid-performance standing ovation. Dropping the coat was symbolic according to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: it &quot;echoed back to those times when gospel queens would toss their furs on top of the coffins of other gospel queens — a gesture that honored the dead but castigated death itself&quot;.

She returned to Detroit&#x27;s Ford Field on Thanksgiving Day 2016 to once again perform the national anthem before the game between the Minnesota Vikings and Detroit Lions. Seated behind the piano, wearing a black fur coat and Lions stocking cap, Franklin gave a rendition of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; that lasted more than four minutes and featured a host of improvisations. Franklin released the album &quot;A Brand New Me&quot; in November 2017 with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, which uses archived recordings from Franklin.

While Franklin canceled some concerts in 2017 for health reasons, and during an outdoor Detroit show, she asked the audience to &quot;keep me in your prayers&quot;, she was still garnering highly favorable reviews for her skill and showmanship. At the Ravinia Festival on September 3, 2017, she gave her last full concert. Franklin&#x27;s final public performance was at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City during Elton John&#x27;s 25th anniversary gala for the Elton John AIDS Foundation on November 7, 2017.

==Music style and image==

According to Richie Unterberger, Franklin was &quot;one of the giants of soul music, and indeed of American pop as a whole. More than any other performer, she epitomized soul at its most gospel-charged&quot;. She had often been described as a great singer and musician due to &quot;vocal flexibility, interpretive intelligence, skillful piano-playing, her ear, her experience&quot;. Franklin&#x27;s voice was described as being a &quot;powerful mezzo-soprano voice&quot;. She was praised for her arrangements and interpretations of other artists&#x27; hit songs. According to David Remnick, what &quot;distinguishes her is not merely the breadth of her catalog or the cataract force of her vocal instrument; it&#x27;s her musical intelligence, her way of singing behind the beat, of spraying a wash of notes over a single word or syllable, of constructing, moment by moment, the emotional power of a three-minute song. &#x27;Respect&#x27; is as precise an artifact as a Ming vase.&quot; Describing Franklin&#x27;s voice on her first album, &quot;Songs of Faith&quot;, released in 1956 when she was just 14, Jerry Wexler explained that it &quot;was not that of a child but rather of an ecstatic hierophant&quot;. Critic Randy Lewis assessed her skills as a pianist as &quot;magic&quot; and &quot;inspirational&quot;. Musicians and professionals alike such as Elton John, Keith Richards, Carole King, and Clive Davis were fans of her piano performances. In 2015, President Barack Obama wrote the following regarding Franklin:

==Activism==
From her time growing up in the home of a prominent African-American preacher to the end of her life, Franklin was immersed and involved in the struggle for civil rights and women&#x27;s rights. She provided money for civil rights groups, at times covering payroll, and performed at benefits and protests. When Angela Davis was jailed in 1970, Franklin told &quot;Jet&quot;: &quot;Angela Davis must go free ... Black people will be free. I&#x27;ve been locked up (for disturbing the peace in Detroit) and I know you got to disturb the peace when you can&#x27;t get no peace. Jail is hell to be in. I&#x27;m going to see her free if there is any justice in our courts, not because I believe in communism, but because she&#x27;s a Black woman and she wants freedom for Black people.&quot; Her songs &quot;Respect&quot; and &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot; became anthems of these movements for social change. Franklin and several other American icons declined to take part in performing at President Donald Trump&#x27;s 2017 inauguration as a mass act of musical protest. Franklin was also a strong supporter of Native American rights. She quietly and without fanfare supported Indigenous peoples&#x27; struggles worldwide, and numerous movements that supported Native American and First Nation cultural rights.

==Personal life==
Franklin moved to New York City from Detroit in the 1960s where she lived until relocating to Los Angeles in the mid-1970s. She eventually settled in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Encino, where she lived until 1982. She then returned to the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills to be close to her ailing father and siblings. Franklin maintained a residence there until her death. Following an incident in 1984, she cited a fear of flying that prevented her from traveling overseas; she performed only in North America afterwards. Franklin was Baptist.

Franklin was the mother of four sons. She first became pregnant at the age of 12 and gave birth to her first child, named Clarence after her father, on January 28, 1955. In one of her handwritten wills, discovered in 2019, Franklin revealed that the father was Edward Jordan. On August 31, 1957, at the age of 15, Franklin had a second child fathered by Jordan, named Edward Derone Franklin after his father. Franklin did not like to discuss her early pregnancies with interviewers. Both children took her family name. While Franklin was pursuing her singing career and &quot;hanging out with [friends]&quot;, her grandmother Rachel and sister Erma took turns raising her children. Franklin would visit them often. Her third child, Ted White Jr., was born to Franklin and her husband Theodore &quot;Ted&quot; White in February 1964 and is known professionally as Teddy Richards. He provided guitar backing for his mother&#x27;s band during live concerts. Her youngest son, Kecalf Cunningham, was born in April 1970 and is the child of her road manager Ken Cunningham.

Franklin was married twice. Her first husband was Ted White, whom she married in 1961 at the age of 18. She had actually seen White the first time at a party held at her house in 1954. After a contentious marriage that was marred by domestic abuse, Franklin separated from White in 1968 and divorced him in 1969. She married actor Glynn Turman, on April 11, 1978, at her father&#x27;s church. By marrying Turman, Franklin became stepmother of Turman&#x27;s three children. Franklin and Turman separated in 1982 after she returned to Michigan from California and they divorced in 1984.

Franklin&#x27;s sisters, Erma and Carolyn, were professional musicians and spent years performing background vocals on Franklin&#x27;s recordings. Following Franklin&#x27;s divorce from Ted White, her brother Cecil became her manager and maintained that position until his death from lung cancer on December 26, 1989. Her sister Carolyn died in April 1988 from breast cancer and her eldest sister Erma died from throat cancer in September 2002. Franklin&#x27;s half-brother Vaughn died in late 2002. Her half-sister, Carol Ellan Kelley (née Jennings; 1940–2019), was C. L. Franklin&#x27;s daughter by Mildred Jennings, a 12-year-old member of New Salem Baptist Church in Memphis where C. L. was pastor. Franklin&#x27;s father and idol, described as &quot;unorthodox on every level,&quot; knowingly preyed on his pre-teen congregants.

Franklin was performing at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, on June 10, 1979, when her father, C. L., was shot twice at point-blank range in his Detroit home. After six months at Henry Ford Hospital while still in a coma, C. L. was moved back to his home with 24-hour nursing care. Aretha moved back to Detroit in late 1982 to assist with the care of her father, who died at Detroit&#x27;s New Light Nursing Home on July 27, 1984.
Franklin had a long friendship with Willie Wilkerson, a Vietnam War veteran and Detroit firefighter, who also helped in her work and cared for her when ill. In 2012 she announced plans to marry Wilkerson but the engagement was quickly called off. Franklin&#x27;s music business friends included Dionne Warwick, Mavis Staples, and Cissy Houston, who began singing with Franklin as members of the Sweet Inspirations. Houston sang background on Franklin&#x27;s hit &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Way&quot;. Franklin first met Cissy&#x27;s young daughter, Whitney Houston, in the early 1970s. She was made Whitney&#x27;s honorary aunt (not a godmother as has been occasionally reported) and Whitney often referred to her as &quot;Auntie Ree&quot;. Franklin had to cancel plans to perform at Whitney Houston&#x27;s memorial service on February 18, 2012, due to a leg spasm. Franklin was a registered Democrat. While her estate had been estimated at $80 million, according to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, at her death it was valued at $18 million.

===Health===
Franklin had weight issues for many years. In 1974, she lost on a very-low-calorie diet and maintained her new weight until the end of the decade. She again lost weight in the early 1990s, before gaining some back. A former chain smoker who struggled with alcoholism, she quit smoking in 1992. She admitted in 1994 that her smoking was &quot;messing with my voice&quot;, but after quitting smoking she said later, in 2003, that her weight &quot;ballooned&quot;.

In 2010, Franklin canceled a number of concerts to have surgery for an undisclosed tumor. Discussing the surgery in 2011, she quoted her doctor as saying that it would &quot;add 15 to 20 years&quot; to her life. She denied that the ailment had anything to do with pancreatic cancer, as had been reported. Franklin added, &quot;I don&#x27;t have to talk about my health with anybody other than my doctors ... The problem has been resolved&quot;. Following the surgery, Franklin lost 85 lbs.; however, she denied that she had undergone weight-loss surgery. On May 19, 2011, Franklin had her comeback show at the Chicago Theatre.

In May 2013, Franklin canceled two performances because of an undisclosed medical treatment. Further concert cancellations followed in the summer and fall. During a phone interview with the Associated Press in late August 2013, Franklin stated that she had had a &quot;miraculous&quot; recovery from her undisclosed illness but had to cancel shows and appearances until her health was at 100%, estimating she was about &quot;85% healed&quot;. Franklin later returned to live performing, including a 2013 Christmas concert at Detroit&#x27;s MotorCity Casino Hotel. She launched a multi-city tour in mid-2014, starting with a performance on June 14 in New York at Radio City Music Hall.

In February 2017, Franklin announced in an interview with local Detroit television anchor Evrod Cassimy, that 2017 would be her final year touring. However, she scheduled some 2018 concert dates before canceling them based on her physician&#x27;s advice.

===Death and funeral===
On August 13, 2018, Franklin was reported to be gravely ill at her home in Riverfront Towers, Detroit. She was under hospice care and surrounded by friends and family. Stevie Wonder, Jesse Jackson and former husband Glynn Turman visited her on her deathbed. Franklin died at her home on August 16, 2018, aged 76. She was initially thought to have died without a will. The cause of death was a malignant pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET), which is distinct from the most common form of pancreatic cancer. Numerous celebrities in the entertainment industry and politicians paid tribute to Franklin, including former U.S. President Barack Obama who said she &quot;helped define the American experience&quot;. Civil rights activist and minister Al Sharpton called her a &quot;civil rights and humanitarian icon&quot;.

A memorial service was held at her home church, New Bethel Baptist Church, on August 19. Thousands then paid their respects during the public lying-in-repose at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History. The August 31 Homegoing Service held at Greater Grace Temple in Detroit, included multiple tributes by celebrities, politicians, friends and family members and was streamed by some news agencies such as Fox News, CNN, The Word Network, BET and MSNBC. Among those who paid tribute to Aretha at the service were Ariana Grande, Bill Clinton, Rev. Al Sharpton, Louis Farrakhan, Faith Hill, Fantasia, the Clark Sisters, Ronald Isley, Angie Stone, Chaka Khan, Jennifer Holliday, Loretta Devine, Jennifer Hudson, Queen Latifah, Shirley Caesar, Shirma Rouse, Stevie Wonder, Eric Holder, Gladys Knight, Cedric the Entertainer, Tyler Perry, Smokey Robinson, Yolanda Adams, and Rev. Dr. William Barber II. At Franklin&#x27;s request she was eulogized by Rev. Jasper Williams Jr. of Salem Baptist Church in Atlanta, as he had eulogized her father as well as speaking at other family memorials. Williams&#x27;s eulogy was criticized for being &quot;a political address that described children being in a home without a father as &#x27;abortion after birth&#x27; and said black lives do not matter unless blacks stop killing each other&quot;. Franklin&#x27;s nephew Vaughan complained of Williams: &quot;He spoke for 50 minutes and at no time did he properly eulogize her.&quot; Following a telecast procession up Seven Mile Road, Franklin was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in Detroit.

==Legacy and honors==

Franklin received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1979, had her voice declared a Michigan &quot;natural resource&quot; in 1985, and became the first woman inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences awarded her a Grammy Legend Award in 1991, then the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994. Franklin was a Kennedy Center Honoree in 1994, recipient of the National Medal of Arts in 1999, recipient of the American Academy of Achievement&#x27;s Golden Plate Award presented by Awards Council member Coretta Scott King, and was bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005 by then President George W. Bush. She was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2005, and the Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame in 2015. Franklin became the second woman inducted to the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. She was the 2008 MusiCares Person of the Year, performing at the Grammys days later. In 2019 she was awarded a Pulitzer Prize Special Citation &quot;[f]or her indelible contribution to American music and culture for more than five decades&quot;. Franklin was the first individual woman to receive a Pulitzer Prize Special Citation. At the beginning of her career, Siouxsie Sioux named her as her favourite female singer.

In 2010 Franklin was ranked first on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot; and ninth on their list of &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. Following news of Franklin&#x27;s surgery and recovery in February 2011, the Grammys ceremony paid tribute to the singer with a medley of her classics performed by Christina Aguilera, Florence Welch, Jennifer Hudson, Martina McBride, and Yolanda Adams. That same year, she was ranked 19th among the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 All-Time top artists.

When &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed the &quot;Women in Rock: 50 Essential Albums&quot; in 2002 and again 2012, it listed Franklin&#x27;s 1967, &quot;I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You&quot;, number one. Inducted to the GMA Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2012, Franklin was described as &quot;the voice of the civil rights movement, the voice of black America&quot;. Asteroid 249516 Aretha was named in her honor in 2014. The next year, &quot;Billboard&quot; named her the greatest female R&amp;B artist of all time. In 2018, Franklin was inducted in to the Memphis Music Hall of Fame.

&quot;American history wells up when Aretha sings&quot;, President Obama explained in response to her performance of &quot;A Natural Woman&quot; at the 2015 Kennedy Center Honors. &quot;Nobody embodies more fully the connection between the African-American spiritual, the blues, R&amp;B, rock and roll—the way that hardship and sorrow were transformed into something full of beauty and vitality and hope.&quot; Franklin later recalled the 2015 Kennedy Center Honors as one of the best nights of her life. On June 8, 2017, the City of Detroit honored Franklin&#x27;s legacy by renaming a portion of Madison Street, between Brush and Witherell Streets, Aretha Franklin Way. The Aretha Franklin Post Office Building was named in 2021, and is located at 12711 East Jefferson Avenue in Detroit, Michigan.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called Franklin &quot;the greatest singer of her generation&quot;. In April 2021, Aretha Franklin was featured in &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine and in the previous month, the society began airing the third season of the television series &quot;Genius&quot; about her life and career. After working with the artist for nearly four decades, Clive Davis, said that Aretha &quot;understood the essence of both language and melody and was able to take it to a place very few—if any—could&quot;. According to &quot;National Geographic&quot;, &quot;she was a musical genius unmatched in her range, power, and soul&quot;.

===Honorary degrees===
Franklin received honorary degrees from Harvard University and New York University in 2014, as well as honorary doctorates in music from Princeton University, 2012; Yale University, 2010; Brown University, 2009; the University of Pennsylvania, 2007; Berklee College of Music, 2006; the New England Conservatory of Music, 1997; and the University of Michigan, 1987. She was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters by Case Western Reserve University 2011 and Wayne State University in 1990 and an honorary Doctor of Law degree by Bethune–Cookman University in 1975.

===Tributes===
After Franklin&#x27;s death, fans added unofficial tributes to two New York City Subway stations: the Franklin Street station in Manhattan, served by the , and the Franklin Avenue station in Brooklyn, served by the . Both stations were originally named after other people. Although the fan tributes were later taken down, the subway system&#x27;s operator, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, placed permanent black-and-white stickers with the word &quot;Respect&quot; next to the &quot;Franklin&quot; name signs in each station.

During the American Music Awards on October 9, 2018, the show was closed by bringing Gladys Knight, Donnie McClurkin, Ledisi, Cece Winans, and Mary Mary together to pay tribute to Aretha Franklin. The &quot;all-star&quot; group performed gospel songs, including renditions from Franklin&#x27;s 1972 album, &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;.

A tribute concert, &quot;Aretha! A Grammy Celebration for the Queen of Soul&quot;, was organized by CBS and the Recording Academy on January 13, 2019, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. The concert included performances by Smokey Robinson, Janelle Monáe, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Kelly Clarkson, Celine Dion, Alessia Cara, Patti LaBelle, Jennifer Hudson, Chloe x Halle, H.E.R., SZA, Brandi Carlile, Yolanda Adams and Shirley Caesar, and was recorded for television, airing on March 10.

At the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, the ceremony was ended with a memorial tribute to the life and career of Franklin. The tribute concluded with a rendition of her 1968 hit, &quot;A Natural Woman (You Make Me Feel Like)&quot;, performed by Fantasia Barrino-Taylor, Andra Day and Yolanda Adams.

In June 2023, &quot;Aretha – A Love Letter to the Queen of Soul&quot; opened at Sydney Opera House before heading to Brisbane and Melbourne. Australian playwright, actor and screenwriter Jada Alberts directed and narrated the musical, which featured Emma Donovan, Montaigne, Thandi Phoenix, Thndo, and Ursula Yovich, along with a nine-piece band.

===Portrayals in media===
On January 29, 2018, Gary Graff confirmed that Jennifer Hudson would play Franklin in a biographical film. The film, &quot;Respect,&quot; was released in August 2021 in various countries. On February 10, 2019, it was announced that the subject of the third season of the American National Geographic anthology television series &quot;Genius&quot; would be Franklin, in the &quot;first-ever, definitive scripted miniseries on the life of the universally acclaimed Queen of Soul&quot;. The season, starring Cynthia Erivo as Franklin, was aired in March 2021. However, Franklin&#x27;s family denounced the series, claiming to be uninvolved with the production process, despite the production team stating that the series had been endorsed by the Franklin estate.

MacLaine&#x27;s career began during the final years of the Golden Age of Hollywood where she made her film debut with Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s black comedy &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; (1955), winning the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress. She rose to prominence with starring roles in &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956), &quot;Some Came Running&quot; (1958), &quot;Ask Any Girl&quot; (1959), &quot;The Apartment&quot; (1960), &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; (1961), &quot;Irma la Douce&quot; (1963), and &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; (1969).

A six-time Academy Award nominee, MacLaine won the Academy Award for Best Actress for the comedy-drama &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; (1983). Her other prominent films include &quot;The Turning Point&quot; (1977), &quot;Being There&quot; (1979), &quot;Madame Sousatzka&quot; (1988), &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; (1989), &quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot; (1990), &quot;In Her Shoes&quot; (2005), &quot;Bernie&quot; (2011), &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot; (2013), &quot;Elsa &amp; Fred&quot; (2014), and &quot;Noelle&quot; (2019).

MacLaine starred in the sitcom &quot;Shirley&#x27;s World&quot; (1971–1972) and played the eponymous fashion designer in the biopic television film &quot;Coco Chanel&quot; (2008), receiving nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a Golden Globe Award for the latter. She also made appearances in several television series, including &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; (2012–2013), &quot;Glee&quot; (2014), and &quot;Only Murders in the Building&quot; (2022). MacLaine has written many books regarding the subjects of metaphysics, spirituality, and reincarnation, as well as a best-selling memoir, &quot;Out on a Limb&quot; (1983).

== Early life and education ==
Named after child actress Shirley Temple, who was six years old at the time, Shirley MacLean Beaty was born on April 24, 1934, in Richmond, Virginia. Her father, Ira Owens Beaty, was a professor of psychology, public school administrator, and a real estate agent. Her Canadian mother, Kathlyn Corinne (née MacLean), was a drama teacher from Wolfville, Nova Scotia. MacLaine&#x27;s younger brother is the actor, writer, and director Warren Beatty, who changed the spelling of his surname for his career. Both were raised by their parents as Baptists. Her mother&#x27;s brother-in-law was A. A. MacLeod, a Communist member of the Ontario provincial legislature in the 1940s. 

While MacLaine was still a child, Ira Beaty moved the family from Richmond to Norfolk, and then to Arlington, then to Waverly, and then back to Arlington, where he worked at Thomas Jefferson Junior High School in Arlington, in 1945. MacLaine played baseball on a boys team, holding the record for most home runs, which earned her the nickname &quot;Powerhouse&quot;. During the 1950s, the family resided in the Dominion Hills section of Arlington.

As a toddler, she had weak ankles and fell over with the slightest misstep, so her mother decided to enroll her in ballet class at the Washington School of Ballet at the age of three. This was the beginning of her interest in performing. Strongly motivated by ballet, she never missed a class. In classical romantic pieces such as &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;, she always played the boys&#x27; roles because she was the tallest in the groups of girls. MacLaine eventually was cast in a substantial female role as the fairy godmother in &quot;Cinderella&quot; and while warming up backstage, broke her ankle. She tightened the ribbons on her toe shoes and completed the entire performance before calling for an ambulance. Ultimately MacLaine decided against making a career of professional ballet because she had grown too tall and felt unable to perfect her technique. She explained that hers was unlike the ideal body type, lacking the requisite &quot;beautifully constructed feet&quot; of high arches, high insteps and a flexible ankle. She moved on to other forms of dancing as well as acting and musical theater.

MacLaine attended Washington-Lee High School in Arlington, Virginia, where she was on the cheerleading squad and acted in school theatrical productions.

==Career==
The summer before her senior year of high school in Arlington, Virginia, MacLaine went to New York City to try acting and had minor success in the chorus of a production of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; that toured the subway circuit. After graduation, she returned and made her Broadway debut dancing in the ensemble of the Broadway production of &quot;Me and Juliet&quot; (1953–1954). Afterwards she became an understudy to actress Carol Haney in &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;; in May 1954 Haney injured her ankle during a Wednesday matinee, and MacLaine performed in her place. A few months later, with Haney still injured, Jerry Lewis saw a matinee and urged film producer Hal B. Wallis to attend the evening performance with him, hoping to cast her in &quot;Artists and Models&quot;. Wallis signed her to work for Paramount Pictures.

===1955–1959: Career beginnings and success===

MacLaine began her career and quickly rose to fame during the final years of the Golden Age of Hollywood when she made her film debut in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; (1955), for which she won the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress. 

&quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; was quickly followed by her role in the Martin and Lewis film &quot;Artists and Models&quot; (also 1955). Soon afterwards, she had the female lead in &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956), which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. This was followed by &quot;Hot Spell&quot;, &quot;The Sheepman&quot;, and &quot;The Matchmaker&quot; (1958), all released in 1958.

She played Ginny Moorehead, who falls in love with Frank Sinatra&#x27;s character, Dave, in Vincente Minelli&#x27;s adaptation of James Jones’ novel &quot;Some Came Running&quot;, in the 1958 film of the same name. The film saw her co-starring with Dean Martin for the second time. For her role as Ginny Moorehead, she earned positive reviews and received her first nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. She appeared with Dean Martin in &quot;Career&quot; (1959), the third of their several films.

===1960–1969: Acclaim and stardom===

MacLaine appeared with Frank Sinatra in 1960&#x27;s &quot;Can-Can&quot;, then made a cameo appearance in the Rat Pack movie &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; (1960). MacLaine would become an honorary member of the Rat Pack.

In 1960, MacLaine starred in Billy Wilder&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;The Apartment&quot; (1960). The film is set in the Upper West Side of Manhattan and follows an insurance clerk, C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon), who allows his co-workers to use his apartment for their extramarital affairs. He is attracted to the insurance company&#x27;s elevator operator (MacLaine), who is already having an affair with Baxter&#x27;s boss (Fred MacMurray). The film received widespread critical acclaim and emerged as a major commercial success at the box-office. It received ten Academy Award nominations, winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Art Direction (Black and White) and Best Film Editing. MacLaine&#x27;s performance in the film earned her a second nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. However, despite being highly favored to win, she lost the award to Elizabeth Taylor for &quot;BUtterfield 8&quot;. She, however, won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress, the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. &quot;The Apartment&quot; was included by Roger Ebert in his 2001 Great Movies list. Charlize Theron, speaking at the 89th Academy Awards, praised MacLaine&#x27;s performance as &quot;raw, real, and funny&quot;, and as making &quot;this black and white movie feel like it&#x27;s in color&quot;.

MacLaine starred in &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; (1961), based on the play by Lillian Hellman, and directed by William Wyler. Reunited with Wilder and Lemmon for &quot;Irma la Douce&quot; (1963); she received her third nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, in addition to winning her second Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.

In 1970, MacLaine published a memoir titled &quot;Don’t Fall off the Mountain&quot;, the first of her numerous books. She devoted some pages to a 1963 incident in which she had marched into the Los Angeles office of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; and punched columnist Mike Connolly in the mouth. She was angered by what he had said in his column about her ongoing contractual dispute with producer Hal Wallis, who had introduced her to the movie industry in 1954 and whom she eventually sued successfully for violating the terms of their contract. The incident with Connolly garnered a headline on the cover of the &quot;New York Post&quot; on June 11, 1963. The full story appeared on page 5 under the headline “Shirley Delivers A Punchy Line!” with a byline by Bernard Lefkowitz.

MacLaine starred in the Cold War comedy &quot;John Goldfarb, Please Come Home!&quot; (1965), with a screenplay by William Peter Blatty, and then co-starred with Michael Caine in the crime thriller &quot;Gambit&quot; (1966).

In the mid-1960s, Twentieth Century-Fox offered her a salary of $750,000 on a &quot;pay or play&quot; basis to appear in a movie adaptation of the musical &quot;Bloomer Girl&quot;, a fee equivalent to the paydays enjoyed by top box office stars of the time. However, the project was canceled, triggering a lawsuit.

MacLaine next starred in seven roles as seven different women in Vittorio DeSica&#x27;s episodic film &quot;Woman Times Seven&quot; (1967), a collection of seven stories of love and adultery set against a Paris backdrop. She followed that film with another comedy, &quot;The Bliss of Mrs. Blossom&quot; in 1968. Both films were box office flops. 
In 1969, MacLaine starred in the film version of the musical &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;, directed by Bob Fosse, and based on the script for Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;Nights of Cabiria&quot; which was released a decade earlier. Gwen Verdon, who originated the role onstage, had hoped to play Charity in the film version; however, MacLaine won the role because her name was better known to audiences at the time. Verdon signed on as assistant to choreographer Bob Fosse, helping teach MacLaine dance moves and some of the more intricate routines. MacLaine received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical nomination. The film was not a financial success.

===1970–1976: Continued success===
MacLaine was top-billed in &quot;Two Mules for Sister Sara&quot; (1970), in a role written for Elizabeth Taylor, who chose not to appear in the movie. The Western film was a hit, primarily due to her co-star Clint Eastwood, one of the top box office stars in the world at that time. The film&#x27;s director, Don Siegel, said of her: &quot;It&#x27;s hard to feel any great warmth to her. She&#x27;s too unfeminine, and has too much balls. She&#x27;s very, very hard.&quot;

She then moved on to television, cast as a photojournalist in a short-lived sitcom, &quot;Shirley&#x27;s World&quot; (1971–1972). Co-produced by Sheldon Leonard and ITC Entertainment, the series was shot in the United Kingdom. As part of the deal, Lew Grade produced the low-budget drama &quot;Desperate Characters&quot; (1970).

MacLaine put her career on hold as she campaigned for George McGovern during the 1972 presidential election, including the Democratic primaries. 

In 1973, her friend, writer and director William Peter Blatty wanted to cast her for the role as the mother in &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. The role was eventually played by Ellen Burstyn. MacLaine declined the part since she had recently appeared in another film about the supernatural, &quot;The Possession of Joel Delaney&quot; (1972).

MacLaine’s documentary film &quot;The Other Half of the Sky: A China Memoir&quot; (1975), co-directed with film and television director Claudia Weill, about the first women&#x27;s delegation to China in 1973, was released theatrically and on PBS, and was nominated for the year&#x27;s Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature Film.

MacLaine returned to onstage live performances during the 1970s. In 1976, she appeared in a series of concerts at the London Palladium and New York&#x27;s Palace Theatre. The latter of these was released as the live album &quot;Shirley MacLaine Live at the Palace&quot;.

=== 1977–1984: Career comeback and Academy Award win ===
MacLaine started a career comeback with the drama &quot;The Turning Point&quot; (1977), portraying a retired ballerina. Her performance in the film received critical acclaim, earning her a fourth nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

She was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award in 1978 for outstanding women who, through their endurance and the excellence of their work, have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry.

In 1979, she starred alongside Peter Sellers in Hal Ashby&#x27;s satirical film &quot;Being There&quot;. The film received widespread acclaim with Roger Ebert writing that he admired the film &quot;for having the guts to take this totally weird concept and push it to its ultimate comic conclusion&quot;. MacLaine received a British Academy Film Award, and Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance.

In 1980, MacLaine starred in two other films about adultery, &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; alongside Anthony Hopkins and Bo Derek, and &quot;Loving Couples&quot; with James Coburn and Susan Sarandon. Neither film was a success, with Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; calling &quot;Loving Couples&quot; &quot;a dumb remake of a very old idea that has been done so much better so many times before, that this version is wretchedly unnecessary ... the whole project smells like high-gloss sitcom.&quot;

MacLaine and Hopkins did not get along on &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; and the film was not a success; critics faulted the screenplay. MacLaine, however, did receive positive notices from critics. Vincent Canby wrote in his &quot;The New York Times&quot; review that the film &quot;exhibits no sense of humor and no appreciation for the ridiculous ... the screenplay [is] often dreadful ... the only appealing performance is Miss MacLaine&#x27;s, and she&#x27;s too good to be true. &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; does prove one thing, though. A farce about characters who&#x27;ve been freed of their conventional obligations quickly becomes aimless.&quot;

In 1983, she starred in James L. Brooks&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; (1983) playing Debra Winger&#x27;s mother. The film focuses on the strained relationship between mother and daughter over 30 years. The film emerged as a critical and commercial success at the box-office, grossing $108.4 million, emerging as the second-highest-grossing film of the year. The film received a leading 11 nominations at the 56th Academy Awards, and won five, including Best Picture. Both MacLaine and Winger earned nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress, with the former winning the award, her first and only win in the category. Her performance also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama.

===1984–present: Post-Oscar career===

MacLaine followed up her Oscar win with a role in &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; (1984). After a four-year hiatus from acting, she starred in the drama Madame Sousatzka (1988), in the eponymous lead role as a Russian-American immigrant. She received positive reviews for her performance, earning her a second Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. In 1989, she released her VHS, &quot;Shirley MacLaine&#x27;s Inner Workout: A Program for Relaxation and Stress Reduction through Meditation&quot;, a companion to her 1989 book, &quot;Going Within: A Guide for Inner Transformation&quot;.
MacLaine continued to star in films, such as the family southern drama &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; (1989) directed by Herbert Ross. The film focuses on the bond that a group of women share in a small-town Southern community, and how they cope with the death of a loved one. The film was a box office success, earning $96.8 million off a budget of $15 million. MacLaine received a British Academy Film Award for her performance. She starred in Mike Nichols&#x27; film &quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot; (1990), with Meryl Streep, playing a fictionalized version of Debbie Reynolds from a screenplay by Reynolds&#x27;s daughter, Carrie Fisher. Fisher wrote the screenplay based on her book. MacLaine received another Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance.
MacLaine continued to act in films such as &quot;Used People&quot; (1992), with Jessica Tandy and Kathy Bates; &quot;Guarding Tess&quot; (1994), with Nicolas Cage; &quot;Mrs. Winterbourne&quot; (1996), with Ricki Lake and Brendan Fraser; &quot;The Evening Star&quot; (1996); &quot;Rumor Has It...&quot;(2005) with Kevin Costner and Jennifer Aniston;&quot; In Her Shoes&quot; (also 2005), with Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette; and&quot; Closing the Ring&quot; (2007), directed by Richard Attenborough and starring Christopher Plummer. She would later reunite with Plummer in the 2014 comedy film &quot;Elsa &amp; Fred&quot; directed by Michael Radford. In 2000, she made her first (and only) feature-film directorial debut, and starred in &quot;Bruno&quot; (with Alex D. Linz), which was released to video as &quot;The Dress Code&quot;. In 2011, MacLaine starred in Richard Linklater&#x27;s dark comedy film &quot;Bernie&quot; alongside Jack Black and Matthew McConaughey.

MacLaine has also appeared in numerous television projects, including a 1987 miniseries based upon her bestselling autobiography, &quot;Out on a Limb&quot;. In 2001, she appeared in &quot;These Old Broads&quot; written by Carrie Fisher and co-starring Elizabeth Taylor, Debbie Reynolds, and Joan Collins. In 2009, she starred in &quot;Coco Before Chanel&quot;, a Lifetime production based on the life of French fashion designer, Coco Chanel, which earned her a Primetime Emmy Award, and Golden Globe Award nominations. She appeared in the third and fourth seasons of the British drama &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; as Martha Levinson, mother to Cora, Countess of Grantham (played by Elizabeth McGovern), and Harold Levinson (played by Paul Giamatti) in 2012–2013.

In 2016, MacLaine starred in &quot;Wild Oats&quot; with Jessica Lange. She starred in the live-action family film &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale, in 2018. In 2019, she played Elf Polly in the film “Noelle”. In 2022, she returned to television starring with Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez in the hit Hulu series &quot;Only Murders in the Building&quot;.

In 2024, MacLaine&#x27;s film &quot;American Dreamer&quot; opened in theaters two years after its initial premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival.

===Lawsuits===
In 1959, MacLaine sued Hal Wallis over a contractual dispute. The lawsuit has been credited with ending the old-style studio star system of actor management. In 1966, MacLaine sued Twentieth Century-Fox for breach of contract when the studio reneged on its agreement to star MacLaine in a film version of the Broadway musical &quot;Bloomer Girl&quot; based on the life of Amelia Bloomer, a mid-nineteenth century feminist, suffragist, and abolitionist, that was to be filmed in Hollywood. Instead, Fox gave MacLaine one week to accept their offer of the female dramatic lead in the Western &quot;Big Country, Big Man&quot; to be filmed in Australia. The case was decided in MacLaine&#x27;s favor, and affirmed on appeal by the California Supreme Court in 1970. The case is discussed in many law-school textbooks as an example of employment-contract law.

==Personal life==

MacLaine was married to businessman Steve Parker from 1954 until their divorce in 1982. Their daughter, Sachi Parker, was born in 1956. In April 2011, while promoting her new book, &quot;I&#x27;m Over All That&quot;, she revealed to Oprah Winfrey that she had had an open relationship with her husband. MacLaine also told Winfrey that she often fell for the leading men she worked with, the exceptions being Jack Lemmon (&quot;The Apartment&quot;, &quot;Irma la Douce&quot;) and Jack Nicholson (&quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;). MacLaine also had long-running affairs with Lord Mountbatten, whom she met in the 1960s, and Australian politician and two-time Liberal leader Andrew Peacock.

MacLaine has also gotten into feuds with such co-stars as Anthony Hopkins (&quot;A Change of Seasons&quot;), who said that &quot;she was the most obnoxious actress I have ever worked with&quot;, and Debra Winger (&quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;).

MacLaine claimed that in a previous life in Atlantis she was the brother of a 35,000-year-old spirit named Ramtha, channeled by mystic teacher and author J. Z. Knight.

She has a strong interest in spirituality and metaphysics, which are the central themes of some of her best-selling books, including &quot;Out on a Limb&quot; and &quot;Dancing in the Light&quot;. Her spiritual explorations include walking the Way of St. James, working with Chris Griscom, and practicing Transcendental Meditation.
The topic of New Age spirituality has also found its way into several of her films. In Albert Brooks&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Defending Your Life&quot; (1991), the recently deceased lead characters, played by Brooks and Meryl Streep, are astonished to find MacLaine introducing their past lives in the &quot;Past Lives Pavilion&quot;; in &quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot; (1990), MacLaine sings a version of &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot;, with lyrics customized for her by composer Stephen Sondheim (for example, one line in the lyrics was changed to &quot;I&#x27;m feeling transcendental – am I here?&quot;); and in the 2001 television movie &quot;These Old Broads&quot;, MacLaine&#x27;s character is a devotee of New Age spirituality.

She has an interest in UFOs, and gave numerous interviews on CNN, NBC and Fox news channels on the subject during 2007–08. In her book &quot;Sage-ing While Age-ing&quot; (2007), she described having alien encounters and witnessing the 1952 Washington, D.C. UFO incident. On an episode of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; in April 2011, MacLaine stated that she and her neighbor had observed numerous UFOs at her New Mexico ranch for extended periods of time.

Along with her brother Warren Beatty, MacLaine used her celebrity status in instrumental roles as a fundraiser and organizer for George McGovern&#x27;s campaign for president in 1972. That year, she wrote the book &quot;McGovern: The Man and His Beliefs&quot;. She appeared at her brother&#x27;s concerts Four for McGovern and Together for McGovern, and she joined with Sid Bernstein to produce the woman-focused Star-Spangled Women for McGovern–Shriver variety show at Madison Square Garden. So much of her time was spent away from acting in 1972 that her talent agent threatened to quit; she turned down film projects and spent $250,000 of her own money on political activism, equivalent to $ in .

MacLaine is godmother to journalist Jackie Kucinich, daughter of former Democratic U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich.

On February 7, 2013, Penguin Group USA published Sachi Parker&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Lucky Me: My Life With – and Without – My Mom, Shirley MacLaine&quot;. One of its claims was that, when Sachi was in her 20s, her mother told her she believed that Steve Parker was a clone of her real father, an astronaut named Paul then traveling in the Pleiades. MacLaine denied this and called the book &quot;virtually all fiction&quot;.

<text>Myrna Loy (born Myrna Adele Williams; August 2, 1905 – December 14, 1993) was an American film, television and stage actress. As a performer, she was known for her ability to adapt to her screen partner&#x27;s acting style. 

Born in Helena, Montana, Loy was raised in rural Radersburg and Helena. She relocated to Los Angeles with her mother in early adolescence and trained as a dancer in high school. She was discovered by production designer Natacha Rambova, who organized film auditions for her. She began obtaining small roles in the late 1920s. Loy devoted herself fully to acting after a few roles in silent films. She was originally typecast in exotic roles, often as a vamp or a woman of Asian descent, but her career prospects improved greatly following her portrayal of Nora Charles in &quot;The Thin Man&quot; (1934). The role helped elevate her reputation and she became known as a versatile actress adept at both drama and comedy; she would reprise the role of Nora Charles five more times.

Loy&#x27;s performances peaked in the 1940s, with films like &quot;The Thin Man Goes Home&quot;, &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;, &quot;The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House&quot;. In the 1950s she appeared in a lead role in the comedy &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; (1950), as well as supporting roles in &quot;The Ambassador&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1956) and the drama &quot;Lonelyhearts&quot; (1958). She appeared in eight films between 1960 and 1981, after which she retired from acting.

Although Loy was never nominated for an Academy Award, in March 1991 she received an Honorary Academy Award in recognition of her life&#x27;s work both onscreen and off, including serving as assistant to the director of military and naval welfare for the Red Cross during World War II, and a member-at-large of the U.S. Commission to UNESCO. In 2009, &quot;The Guardian&quot; named her one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination. Loy died in December 1993 in New York City, at age 88.

==Life and career==
===1905–1924: Early life===
Loy was born Myrna Adele Williams on August 2, 1905, in Helena, Montana, the daughter of Adelle Mae (née Johnson) and rancher David Franklin Williams. Her parents had married in Helena in 1904, one year before Loy was born. She had one younger brother, David Frederick Williams (1911–1983). Loy&#x27;s paternal grandfather, David Thomas Williams, was Welsh, and emigrated from Liverpool, England to the United States in 1856, arriving in Philadelphia. Unable to read or write in English, he later settled in the Montana Territory where he began a career as a rancher. Loy&#x27;s maternal grandparents were Scottish and Swedish immigrants. During her childhood, her father worked as a banker, real estate developer, and farmland appraiser in Helena, and was the youngest man ever elected to serve in the Montana state legislature. Her mother had studied music at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago, and at one time considered a career as a concert performer, but instead devoted her time to raising Loy and her brother. Loy&#x27;s mother was a lifelong Democrat, while her father was a staunch Republican. She was raised in the Methodist faith.

Loy spent her early life in Radersburg, Montana, a rural mining community approximately southeast of Helena. During the winter of 1912, Loy&#x27;s mother nearly died from pneumonia, and her father sent his wife and daughter to La Jolla, California. Loy&#x27;s mother saw great potential in Southern California, and during one of her husband&#x27;s visits, she encouraged him to purchase real estate there. Among the properties he bought was land that he would later sell, at a considerable profit, to filmmaker Charlie Chaplin for his film studio there. Although her mother tried to persuade her husband to move to California permanently, he preferred ranch life and the three eventually returned to Montana. Soon afterward, Loy&#x27;s mother needed a hysterectomy and insisted Los Angeles was a safer place to have it done, so she, Loy, and Loy&#x27;s brother David moved to Ocean Park, where Loy began to take dancing lessons. After the family returned to Montana, Loy continued her dancing lessons, and at the age of 12, Myrna Williams made her stage debut performing a dance she had choreographed based on &quot;The Blue Bird&quot; from the &quot;Rose Dream&quot; operetta at Helena&#x27;s Marlow Theater.

When Loy was 13, her father died during the 1918 flu pandemic in November of that year. Loy&#x27;s mother permanently relocated the family to California, where they settled in Culver City, outside Los Angeles. Loy attended the exclusive Westlake School for Girls while continuing to study dance in downtown Los Angeles. When her teachers objected to her extracurricular participation in theatrical arts, her mother enrolled her in Venice High School, and at 15, she began appearing in local stage productions.

In 1921, Loy posed for Venice High School sculpture teacher Harry Fielding Winebrenner as &quot;Inspiration&quot;; the full length figure was central in his allegorical sculpture group &quot;Fountain of Education&quot;. Completed in 1922, the sculpture group was installed in front of the campus outdoor pool in May 1923 where it stood for decades. Loy&#x27;s slender figure with her uplifted face and one arm extending skyward presented a &quot;vision of purity, grace, youthful vigor, and aspiration&quot; that was singled out in a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; story that included a photo of the &quot;Inspiration&quot; figure along with the model&#x27;s name—the first time her name appeared in a newspaper. A few months later, Loy&#x27;s &quot;Inspiration&quot; figure was temporarily removed from the sculpture group and transported aboard the battleship for a Memorial Day pageant in which &quot;Miss Myrna Williams&quot; participated. &quot;Fountain of Education&quot; can be seen in the opening scenes of the 1978 film &quot;Grease&quot;. After decades of exposure to the elements and vandalism, the original concrete statue was removed from display in 2002, and replaced in 2010 by a bronze duplicate paid for through an alumni-led fundraising campaign.

Loy left school at the age of 18 to begin to help with the family&#x27;s finances. She obtained work at Grauman&#x27;s Egyptian Theatre, where she performed in what was called prologues, elaborate musical sequences that were related to and served as preliminary entertainment before the feature film. During this period, Loy saw Eleonora Duse in the play &quot;Thy Will Be Done&quot;, and the simple acting techniques she employed made such an impact on Loy that she tried to emulate them throughout her career.

===1925–1932: Career beginnings===
While Loy was dancing in prologues at the Grauman&#x27;s Egyptian Theatre, portrait photographer Henry Waxman took several pictures of her that were noticed by Rudolph Valentino when the actor went to Waxman&#x27;s studio for a sitting. Valentino was looking for a leading lady for &quot;Cobra&quot;, the first independent project he and his wife Natacha Rambova were producing. Loy tested for the role, which went to Gertrude Olmstead instead, but soon after that she was hired as an extra for &quot;Pretty Ladies&quot; (1925), in which she and fellow newcomer Joan Crawford were among a bevy of chorus girls dangling from an elaborate chandelier. The two of them would share a life-long friendship that would last until Crawford&#x27;s death. 

Rambova hired Loy for a small but showy role opposite Nita Naldi in &quot;What Price Beauty?&quot;, a film she was producing. Shot in May 1925, the film remained unreleased for three years; but stills of Loy in her exotic makeup and costume appeared in &quot;Motion Picture&quot; magazine and led to a contract with Warner Bros. There, her surname was changed from Williams to Loy. The idea for the new name apparently came from screenwriter Peter Ruric, also known as crime novelist Paul Cain, who may have been inspired by the name of British poet Mina Loy.

Loy&#x27;s silent film roles were mainly as a vamp or &quot;femme fatale&quot;, and she frequently portrayed characters of Asian or Eurasian background in films such as &quot;Across the Pacific&quot; (1926), &quot;A Girl in Every Port&quot; (1928), &quot;The Crimson City&quot; (1928), &quot;The Black Watch&quot; (1929), and &quot;The Desert Song&quot; (1929), which she later recalled &quot;kind of solidified my exotic non-American image.&quot; In 1930, she appeared in &quot;The Great Divide&quot;. It took years for her to overcome this typecasting, and as late as 1932, she was cast as a villainous Eurasian in &quot;Thirteen Women&quot; (1932) and, opposite Boris Karloff, as the depraved sadistic daughter of the title character in &quot;The Mask of Fu Manchu&quot; (1932). 

In spite of this (typecasting), Loy also obtained small roles in &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; and a number of early lavish Technicolor musicals, including &quot;The Show of Shows&quot;, &quot;The Bride of the Regiment&quot;, and &quot;Under a Texas Moon&quot;. As a result, she became associated with musical roles, and when they began to lose favour with the public, her career went into a slump. In 1934, Loy appeared in &quot;Manhattan Melodrama&quot; with Clark Gable and William Powell. When gangster John Dillinger was shot to death after leaving a screening of the film at the Biograph Theater in Chicago, the film received widespread publicity, with some newspapers reporting that Loy had been Dillinger&#x27;s favorite actress.

===1933–1938: Rise to stardom===
After appearing with Ramón Novarro in &quot;The Barbarian&quot; (1933), Loy was cast as Nora Charles in the 1934 film &quot;The Thin Man&quot;. Director W. S. Van Dyke chose Loy after he detected a wit and sense of humor that her previous films had not revealed. At a Hollywood party, he pushed her into a swimming pool to test her reaction, and felt that her aplomb in handling the situation was exactly what he envisioned for Nora. Louis B. Mayer at first refused to allow Loy to play the part because he felt she was a dramatic actress, but Van Dyke insisted. Mayer finally relented on the condition that filming be completed within three weeks, as Loy was committed to start filming &quot;Stamboul Quest&quot;. &quot;The Thin Man&quot; became one of the year&#x27;s biggest hits, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Loy received excellent reviews and was acclaimed for her comedic skills. She and her costar William Powell proved to be a popular screen couple and appeared in 14 films together, one of the most prolific pairings in Hollywood history. Loy later referred to &quot;The Thin Man&quot; as the film &quot;that finally made me... after more than 80 films.&quot;

Her successes in &quot;Manhattan Melodrama&quot; and &quot;The Thin Man&quot; marked a turning point in her career, and she was cast in more important pictures. Such films as &quot;Wife vs. Secretary&quot; (1936) with Clark Gable and Jean Harlow, and &quot;Petticoat Fever&quot; (1936) with Robert Montgomery gave her opportunity to develop comedic skills. She made four films with William Powell in close succession: &quot;Libeled Lady&quot; (1936) (which also starred Jean Harlow and Spencer Tracy); &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot; (1936) (in which she played Billie Burke opposite Powell&#x27;s Florenz Ziegfeld); the second Thin Man film, &quot;After the Thin Man&quot; (1936) (which also starred James Stewart); and the romantic comedy &quot;Double Wedding&quot; (1937).

In 1932, Loy had begun dating producer Arthur Hornblow Jr., when he was still married to Juliette Crosby: Loy and Hornblow themselves married in 1936, in between filming these four successive productions. She was later rumored to have had affairs with co-star Tracy between 1935 and 1936, while filming &quot;Whipsaw&quot; and &quot;Libeled Lady&quot;. Loy recounted in her autobiography that Spencer Tracy chased after her. You don&#x27;t have to worry about me anymore,&#x27; he said like a sulky child. &#x27;I&#x27;ve found the woman I want.&#x27; As he outlined the virtues of Katharine Hepburn, I was relieved, but also a bit disappointed. As selfish as it sounds, I liked having a man like Spence in the background wanting me. It&#x27;s rather nice when nothing&#x27;s required in return.&quot;

She also made three more films with Gable at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM): &quot;Parnell&quot; (1937) was a historical drama and one of the most poorly received films of either Loy&#x27;s or Gable&#x27;s career, but their other pairings in &quot;Test Pilot&quot; and &quot;Too Hot to Handle&quot; (both 1938) were successes. While working for MGM, Loy was outspoken about the studio&#x27;s casting hierarchy, especially based on race, and was quoted as saying: &quot;Why does every black person in the movies have to play a servant? How about a black person walking up the steps of a court house carrying a briefcase?&quot;

During this period, Loy was one of Hollywood&#x27;s busiest and highest-paid actresses, and in 1937 and 1938 she was listed in the annual &quot;Quigley Poll of the Top Ten Money Making Stars&quot;, which was compiled from the votes of movie exhibitors throughout the United States for the stars who had generated the most revenue in their theaters over the previous year.

===1939–1949: Mainstream work and war activism===
By the late 1930s, Loy was highly regarded for her performances in romantic comedies, and she was anxious to demonstrate her dramatic ability. She was cast in the lead female role in &quot;The Rains Came&quot; (1939) opposite Tyrone Power. She filmed &quot;Third Finger, Left Hand&quot; (1940) with Melvyn Douglas and appeared in &quot;I Love You Again&quot; (1940), &quot;Love Crazy&quot; (1941), and &quot;Shadow of the Thin Man&quot; (1941), all with William Powell.

On June 1, 1942, Loy divorced her husband Hornblow in Reno, citing &quot;mental cruelty&quot; as the impetus for separating. Five days after the divorce, she married John D. Hertz, Jr. an advertising executive and founder of Hertz Rent A Car, at his sister&#x27;s home in New York City. They remained married for two years, eventually divorcing in Cuernavaca, Mexico, on August 21, 1944, with Loy again citing mental cruelty.

With the outbreak of World War II the same year, Loy all but abandoned her acting career to focus on the war effort and began devoting her time to working with the Red Cross. She was so fiercely outspoken against Adolf Hitler that her name appeared on his blacklist, resulting in her films being banned in Germany. She also helped run a Naval Auxiliary canteen and toured frequently to raise funds for the war efforts. Around 1945, Loy began dating producer and screenwriter Gene Markey, who had previously been married to actresses Joan Bennett and Hedy Lamarr. The two were married in a private ceremony on January 3, 1946, at the chapel on Terminal Island, while Markey was serving in the military.

She returned to films with &quot;The Thin Man Goes Home&quot; (1944). In 1946, she played the wife of a returning serviceman Fredric March in &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (1946). Loy was paired with Cary Grant in David O. Selznick&#x27;s &quot;The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer&quot; (1947). The film co-starred a teenaged Shirley Temple. Following its success, she appeared again with Grant in &quot;Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House&quot; (1948).

In 1948, she had become a member of the U.S. National Commission for UNESCO, the first Hollywood celebrity to do so.

===1950–1982: Later career and political activities===
In 1950, Loy co-starred with Clifton Webb in &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; (1950), which was a box-office hit, grossing $4.4 million in the United States. The same year, she divorced Markey. Her fourth and final husband was Howland H. Sargeant, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs and president of Radio Liberty, whom she married on June 2, 1951, in Fort Myer, Virginia. Sargeant, a Presbyterian, wanted the marriage officiated in the church, but they were unable to do so due to Loy&#x27;s recent divorce.

Throughout the 1950s, Loy assumed an influential role as co-chairman of the Advisory Council of the National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing. In 1952, she starred in the &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; sequel, &quot;Belles on Their Toes&quot;. In 1956, she appeared in &quot;The Ambassador&#x27;s Daughter&quot; along with John Forsythe and Olivia de Havilland. She played opposite Montgomery Clift and Robert Ryan in &quot;Lonelyhearts&quot; (1958), Dore Schary&#x27;s adaptation of Nathanael West&#x27;s classic 1933 novel &quot;Miss Lonelyhearts&quot;. In 1960, she appeared in &quot;Midnight Lace&quot; and &quot;From the Terrace&quot;, but was not in another film until 1969 in &quot;The April Fools&quot;. In 1965, Loy won the Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago theatre. 

Loy, a lifelong Democrat, publicly supported the election of John F. Kennedy in 1960, finding Richard Nixon to be an unscrupulous man. She would endorse Eugene McCarthy, and later Hubert Humphrey in 1968 and George McGovern in 1972.

She divorced her fourth husband Sargeant in 1960. In 1967, she was cast in the television series &quot;The Virginian&quot;, appearing in an episode titled &quot;Lady of the House&quot;. Also in 1967, she appeared on &quot;Family Affair&quot; in the episode &quot;A Helping Hand&quot; as a woman out of work and taking on hired-help and cook work, comically aided by Mr. French, though, the job did not work out, and she takes the failure out on John Williams, who was temporarily substituting for Sebastian Cabot in the role of Mr. French. In 1972, she appeared as the suspect&#x27;s mother-in-law in an episode of the television series &quot;Columbo&quot; titled &quot;Étude in Black&quot;. In 1974, she had a supporting part in &quot;Airport 1975&quot; playing Mrs. Devaney, a heavy-drinking woman imbibing Jim Beam and Olympia Beer mixed together; a foil to the character played by Sid Caesar. In 1975, Loy was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent two mastectomies to treat the disease. She kept her cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment from the public until the publication of her autobiography in 1987.

Loy appeared at Denver&#x27;s Elitch Theatre in 1967 in Barefoot in the Park, and then returned in 1969 in Janus.

In 1978, she appeared in the film &quot;The End&quot; as the mother of the main character played by Burt Reynolds. Her last motion picture performance was in 1980 in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s &quot;Just Tell Me What You Want&quot;. She also returned to the stage, making her Broadway debut in a short-lived 1973 revival of Clare Boothe Luce&#x27;s &quot;The Women&quot;. She toured in a 1978 production of Alan Ayckbourn&#x27;s &quot;Relatively Speaking&quot;, directed by David Clayton.

In 1981, she appeared in the television drama &quot;Summer Solstice&quot;, which was Henry Fonda&#x27;s last performance. Her last acting role was a guest spot on the sitcom &quot;Love, Sidney&quot;, in 1982.

===1983–1993: Final years===
In January 1985 Loy was honored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences with a special salute held at Carnegie Hall in New York City, which she attended along with 2,800 guests. Her autobiography, &quot;Myrna Loy: Being and Becoming&quot;, was published in 1987. The following year she received a Kennedy Center Honor. Although Loy was never nominated for an Academy Award for any single performance, after an extensive letter-writing campaign and years of lobbying by screenwriter and then–Writers Guild of America, West board member Michael Russnow, who enlisted the support of Loy&#x27;s former screen colleagues and friends such as Roddy McDowall, Sidney Sheldon, Harold Russell, and many others, she received a 1991 Academy Honorary Award &quot;for her career achievement&quot;. She accepted via camera from her New York City home, simply stating, &quot;You&#x27;ve made me very happy. Thank you very much.&quot; It was her last public appearance in any medium.

===Death===
Loy died at age 88 on December 14, 1993, at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan during surgery following a long, unspecified illness. She had been frail and in failing health, which had resulted in her being unable to attend the 1991 Academy Awards ceremony, where she was to receive a lifetime achievement Oscar. She was cremated in New York and her ashes interred at Forestvale Cemetery in her native Helena, Montana.

==Legacy==

A building at Sony Pictures Studios, formerly MGM Studios, in Culver City is named in her honor. 

A cast of her handprint and her signature are in the sidewalk in front of Theater 80, on St. Mark&#x27;s Place in New York City.

In 1936, Loy was honored with a block in the forecourt of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre.

For her contribution to the film industry, Loy has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6685 Hollywood Boulevard. The ceremony for that star was held on February 8, 1960.

Steel Pole Bath Tub has a song on their 1991 album &quot;Tulip&quot; that is both named after Loy and samples dialogue from one of her films (&quot;Stinky Davis&quot; story, excerpted from &quot;The Thin Man Goes Home&quot;, 1944).

In 1991, The Myrna Loy&lt;ref name=&quot;cinematreasures/34826&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Center for the Performing and Media Arts opened in downtown Helena, not far from Loy&#x27;s childhood home. Located in the historic Lewis and Clark Country Jail, it sponsors live performances and alternative films for underserved audiences.

The songwriter Josh Ritter included a song about Loy, called “Myrna Loy”, on his 2017 album &quot;Gathering&quot;.

<doc id="147372" wikidata="Q2440398" url="?curid=147372" title="People's Armed Police">
<text>The People&#x27;s Armed Police Force is a paramilitary organization of the People&#x27;s Republic of China primarily responsible for internal security, riot control, counter-terrorism, disaster response, law enforcement and maritime rights protection as well as providing support to the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) during wartime.

Unlike the civilian People&#x27;s Police, the PAP is a specialized paramilitary force reporting directly to the Central Military Commission (CMC). PAP officers and soldiers wear dark olive green uniforms, different from pine green uniforms of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Ground Force (PLAGF) or the light blue and black uniforms of the People&#x27;s Police.

The PAP is estimated to have a total strength of 1.5 million. It was established in its current form in 1982, but similar security forces have operated since the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949. During the Maoist era, the PAP&#x27;s predecessors were the Chinese People&#x27;s Public Security Force, initially under the MPS, and later the Public Security Corps which was under the command of the PLA. The PAP has been compared by both Chinese and foreign scholars with the gendarmerie forces found in many countries, most famously the French Gendarmerie, but the main inspiration for the PAP&#x27;s establishment and operation came from the Internal Troops of the Soviet Union and related paramilitary forces of the Eastern Bloc such as the East German Alert Units, adapted to the specific military-political culture and thinking of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership.

== History ==
The history of the People&#x27;s Armed Police is as long as that of the People&#x27;s Republic, and its origin can be traced back to the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, which was responsible for both defending the nation from foreign invasions and maintaining internal security. Although the force was officially established in 1982, its constituent units stretch back to 1949.

=== People&#x27;s Public Security Force ===
In July 1949, the CMC decided to establish the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) with Luo Ruiqing as its minister to organize the public security forces in the nation. In August 1949, several security and public order units of the Fourth Field Army were consolidated into the Central Column of the Chinese People&#x27;s Public Security Force (PSF) to guard the Party and State leaders and to keep the public order in the capital. The Central Column provided security for the inauguration ceremony of the People&#x27;s Republic. From December 1949 to May 1950, regional security forces, along with the now dissolved Central Column, had been consolidated into divisions under the PSF.

The PSF was assigned to the PLA and became the PLA Public Security Force in September 1950, and the PLA Public Security Corps in July 1955, reporting under the Central Military Commission of the CCP and the National Defense Council of the People&#x27;s Republic. Luo Ruiqing was appointed as the commander and political commissar of the PSF in September 1950 and remained on the posts until 1959, retaining the command of the PSF.

As of 1960, the Public Security Corps was organised in 8,200-strong Public Security Divisions, which were deemed not capable of independent, sustained, full-scale combat operations.

=== People&#x27;s Armed Police Force ===
After numerous reorganizations and transfers of control between the PLA and the MPS, the People&#x27;s Armed Police was created on 19 June 1982, combining the previous armed police, border guards and fire brigades. The headquarter was set up in the MPS as a subordinate department. The establishment of the PAP highlighted the efforts to increase the professionalization of the security apparatus, as well as the absorption of numerous PLA demobilized personnel, in the wake of growing unrest.

The PAP was led by both the local government and superior PAP forces, which is called &quot;Dual-Leadership&quot; &quot;(双重领导)&quot;. In practice, the local government (including the local party committee, local people&#x27;s government and the local public security bureau) carries more weight. However, there were many confusions and loopholes caused by this ambiguous organization structure.

In the mid and late 1990s, CCP general secretary Jiang Zemin significantly expanded and strengthened the PAP, with more than 100,000 new troops. Jiang praised the PAP, describing it as &quot;a major force for maintaining state security and social stability, the People&#x27;s Armed Police shoulders a massive and formidable burden&quot; and deployed it extensively in Xinjiang and Tibet.

Up until 2013, the China Coast Guard was a part of the PAP. In 2013, it was separated and transferred to the direct control of the Ministry of Public Security and the State Oceanic Administration. However, in March 2018, it was announced that the Coast Guard would be placed under the People&#x27;s Armed Police Force once again since the State Oceanic Administration was disbanded, but now as an independent branch reporting directly to PAP headquarters.

=== 2017–2018 Reform ===
Until 31 December 2017, the People&#x27;s Armed Police had a dual command structure including the Central Military Commission (CMC) and the State Council through the Ministry of Public Security (MPS).

Prior to the 2018 reform, the People&#x27;s Armed Police was further divided into eight corps: Internal Guard, Gold, Forestry, Hydropower, Transportation, Border Defense, Firefighting, and Safeguard Corps. The Internal Guard Corps, which makes up for the bulk of PAP, is under the PAP Headquarters and reports thus to the party central committee and the CMC (Central Military Commission). The Gold, Forestry, Hydropower, and Transportation Corps, collectively known as the Specialist Corps, were by then under the joint leadership of PAP Headquarters and their respective ministries in the State Council. The Border Defense, Firefighting, and Guard Corps, collectively known as the Public Security Corps, were then under the direct supervision of the Ministry of Public Security (MPS).

By law however, the PAP operates separately from the PLA. and, in terms of conducting public security operations and relevant capability building, the PAP Headquarters is under the leadership and command of the Ministry of Public Security (MPS).

From 1 January 2018, command of the People&#x27;s Armed Police is jointly held by the CCP central committee and the Central Military Commission (CMC), with the PAP no longer subordinate to the State Council.

The reform was reportedly carried out in order to deprive the local Chinese Communist Party authorities of the power to use the PAP units to commit abuses or against the leadership in Beijing, especially after the Wang Lijun incident in which the PAP was allegedly abused by provincial party secretary Bo Xilai to surround the US Consulate in Chongqing after a falling out with Wang, the police chief of Chongqing at the time. Under the 2018 reforms, local authorities now need central approval in order to deploy the PAP.

On 10 January 2018, the PAP received a new flag following the design of the branch flags of the PLA with three olive stripes at the bottom. The three olive stripes represents the People&#x27;s Armed Police responsible for the three main tasks and force composition of maintaining national political security and social stability, maritime rights protection and law enforcement, and defense operations.

On 21 March 2018, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party unveiled a reform plan for the People&#x27;s Armed Police Force. Under this plan, the non-combatant elements of the PAP, the Gold, Forestry, Hydropower, Border Defense, Firefighting, and Guard Corps, are to be removed and the CCG is to be consolidated with PAP. As of March 2018, the PAP is working with the Central Committee and the relevant organs for the transfer of non-combatant elements into civil service. The Transportation Corps is the only remaining component of the Specialist Corps.

Until 2018, the Specialist Corps were responsible in constructing and maintaining highways and roads, surveying mineral deposits, fighting forest fires, and constructing large scale waterworks like dams and levees as well as for water works maintenance. The PAP is also called upon in emergency rescue and disaster relief operations within the PRC via the specialist and public security forces which can be forward deployed during such operations.

==== Organizational changes ====
With the 2018 reforms, Specialist Corps other than the Transportation Corps have been placed under other ministries. China Coast Guard (CCG) was transferred from State Council to PAP command, and the Transportation Corps has some units under the Mobile Contingents.

The Border Defense Corps and Guards Corps have been absorbed by the Ministry of Public Security (MPS). The Firefighting and Forestry Corps were merged with the fire department of the MPS and reorganized as China Fire and Rescue (CF&amp;R), it was placed under the Ministry of Emergency Management. The Gold Corps and Hydropower Corps have been transformed into state-owned enterprises under the supervision of the relevant State Council ministries (Ministry of Natural Resources and China National Gold Group Corporation and China Aneng Construction Corporation, respectively).

=== Chronology ===
From the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, the paramilitary public security force has been reorganized numerous times. The current designation since 1982, the People&#x27;s Armed Police, was first used between 1959 and 1963.

*1949–1950: Chinese People&#x27;s Public Security Force, under the Ministry of Public Security (MPS)
*1950–1955: Public Security Force, under the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA)
*1955–1959: Public Security Corps, under the PLA
*1959–1963: People&#x27;s Armed Police, under the joint leadership of the MPS and the PLA
*1963–1966: Chinese People&#x27;s Public Security Force, under the joint leadership of the MPS and the PLA
*1966–1982: PLA Internal Guard, absorbed into the PLA in an integrated structure. In 1971 and 1973, some units were transferred to the MPS
*1982–present: People&#x27;s Armed Police (PAP)

== Mission and operations ==

The People&#x27;s Armed Police is formally regulated by the People&#x27;s Armed Police Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (), adopted and effective since 27 August 2009.

The People&#x27;s Armed Police&#x27;s primary mission is internal security. The first law on the People&#x27;s Armed Police, the Law on the People&#x27;s Armed Police Force (PAPF), was passed in August 2009, giving it statutory authority to respond to riots, terrorist attacks or other emergencies. Such units guard government buildings at all levels (including party and state organizations, foreign embassies and consulates), provide security to public corporations and major public events, as well as counter-terrorism and handling of public emergencies. Some units perform guard duty in civilian prisons and provide executioners for the state. The PAP also maintains tactical counter-terrorism (CT) units such as the Snow Wolf Commando Unit (SWCU) and various Special Police Units (SPUs).

In the Chinese policing system, the People&#x27;s Armed Police concentrates on managing protests otherwise referred to as &quot;mass incidents&quot; and protecting important facilities and events, while the public security officers focus on handling crime and issues related to the maintenance of public order. The People&#x27;s Armed Police assists the regular police in operations where violent opposition is expected, in roadblocks and the protection of crime scenes. The People&#x27;s Armed Police is also involved in anti-crime campaigns. In order maintenance activities, the People&#x27;s Armed Police uses the preventive patrol, under the leadership of the public security organs, and sometimes in conjunction with them. When dealing with mass incidents, with gang activities and other risk situations, responsibility shifts to the People&#x27;s Armed Police. However, the People&#x27;s Armed Police also conducts exclusive patrols.

The PAP maintains both a division-sized mechanized infantry unit and a rapid deployment light motorized infantry unit, these units are tasked with responding to any possible armed mutinies by PLA soldiers. In wartime deployments the PAP can act as light infantry supporting the PLAGF in local defense missions and in support of the PLAN in naval operations.

=== International operations ===
While the People&#x27;s Armed Police is principally charged with internal security and guarding key facilities and installations, it also operates as part of the international security efforts of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, against both terrorism and organized crime. Mathieu Duchâtel for The National Bureau of Asian Research identifies the legal basis of the PAP missions abroad in Article 71 of the 2015 Counter-terrorism Law. According Armed Police Force University professor Zhou Jian, counterterrorism is a task provided by law for the People&#x27;s Armed Police and operating missions abroad is an “irreplaceable means”.

The People&#x27;s Armed Police sent personnel abroad to receive training or provide training and participates in counter-terrorism exercises, especially across Central Asia in bilateral and multilateral agreements. PAP special operations forces are also deployed in the Chinese embassies of Baghdad and Kabul for the purposes of protection of diplomatic staff and property.

Since 2011, the People&#x27;s Armed Police has also conducted operations along the Mekong river with the security forces of Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia. These operations are aimed against organized crime.

Since 2014, the People&#x27;s Republic of China established a security cooperation with Tajikistan and Afghanistan on Afghan border, near the Wakhan Corridor and in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region. The People&#x27;s Armed Police is the main force for both bilateral and trilateral counterterrorism operations (mainly reconnaissance patrols in remote areas), being deployed south of Shaymak; the PAP has also conducted training for Tajik security forces.

== Headquarters and organization ==
The People&#x27;s Armed Police Headquarters is the leading and commanding organ that directs and administers all the units and provides guidance to it. The PAP has a commander, a political commissar and several deputy commanders and deputy political commissars. The PAP also has departments responsible for logistical and political matters and several speciality departments.

Following adjustment and reorganization, the People&#x27;s Armed Police is mainly composed of the territorial forces, the mobile forces, and the Coast Guard.

The People&#x27;s Armed Police Headquarters, placed at Theater Command Grade, include five Departments directly under the Headquarters:
* Staff Department (Deputy Theater Command Grade);
** Training Bureau (Division Leader Grade);
** Intelligence Bureau (Division Leader Grade), led by Zhang Xiaoqi;
* Political Work Department (Deputy Theater Command Grade): led by Director Lieutenant general Gao Wei;
** Propaganda Bureau (Division Leader Grade);
** Soldier and Civilian Personnel Bureau (Division Leader Grade);
* Discipline Inspection Commission (Deputy Theater Command Grade);
* Logistics Department (Corps Leader Grade);
* Equipment Department (Corps Leader Grade).
Being of Theatre Command Grade, the People&#x27;s Armed Police is led by a full General.

== Training ==
The People&#x27;s Armed Police has a number of training institutions, likely overseen by the Training Bureau of the Staff Department.

* (Corps Leader Grade, led by a Major General)
* (Corps Leader Grade, led by a Major General)
* (Corps Leader Grade, led by a Major General)
* (Deputy Corps Leader Grade, led by a Major General)
* People&#x27;s Armed Police Special Police Academy (Deputy Corps Leader Grade, led by a Major General)
* China Coast Guard Academy
* Non-commissioned Officer School of the People&#x27;s Armed Police

New constables of the People&#x27;s Armed Police are drawn from the general military conscription pool, but they are trained in the People&#x27;s Armed Police basic training units.

According to Zi Yang, the state of the education and training system as of 2016 suffered of issues which negatively affected the quality of education.

=== People&#x27;s Armed Police Academy ===
The People&#x27;s Armed Police Academy tasked with officer education and training for duties related to the missions entrusted to the People&#x27;s Armed Police, including, since 2001, UN peacekeeping. The People&#x27;s Armed Police Academy is headquartered in Langfang, of Hebei. The People&#x27;s Armed Police Academy started to recruit cadets in 1984; since 1997, it has begun to issue bachelor&#x27;s degrees; in 2003 it was allowed to issue master&#x27;s degrees. According to a 2019 source, it is subordinate to the Ministry of Public Security. The PAP Academy is a Corps Leader Grade command, and thus it is led by a major general who serves as Superintendent. All graduates to the academy are commissioned into the PAP as Second Lieutenants (equivalent of Ensigns for those commissioned into the Coast Guard).

=== People&#x27;s Armed Police Logistics Academy ===
The People&#x27;s Armed Police Logistics Academy is a training body aimed to train People&#x27;s Armed Police personnel in handling logistics. According to Unit Tracker, the university include subjects as applied economics, military and paramilitary logistics, as well as engineering. The Logistics Academy is a Corps Leader Grade command, and thus it is led by a major general.

== Mobile contingents ==
Mobile contingents () are large formations without fixed areas of responsibility. Two were created after the 2018 reforms; most of the subordinate units came from the 14 disbanded mobile divisions. Mobile contingents are corps leader grade formations commanded by major generals.

The mobile contingents are mainly responsible for dealing with terrorism, violent crime, riots, and public security threats.

=== 1st Mobile Contingent ===
The 1st Mobile Contingent is based in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, south of Beijing. The Contingent covers northern and central China, including Beijing. The 1st Mobile Contingent consists of:
* 9 mobile detachments (Panjin, Liaoning; Shenyang, Liaoning; Bayisingtu, Inner Mongolia; Tianjin; Dingzhou, Hebei; Baoding, Hebei; Jinzhong, Shanxi; Zhengzhou, Henan; Pingliang, Gansu);
* 3 Special Operations detachments (Beijing; Tianjin; Shijiazhuang);
* 2 Transportation detachments (Beijing and Xi’an, Shaanxi);
* 1 Engineering/Chemical Defence detachment (Huludao, Liaoning);

== Internal security forces ==
The major part of the PAP is the &quot;nèiwèi bùduì&quot; (); translations include &quot;internal security forces&quot;, &quot;internal security troops&quot;, and &quot;internal guards corps&quot;. Internal security forces are divided into provincial-level formations with geographical areas of responsibility. They are subordinated to PAP headquarters; the 2017-2018 reforms removed control of PAP units from local government. Internal security forces are focused on domestic security missions, maintaining stability in western China, guarding government compounds, disaster relief, and responding to major anti-government unrest.

The &quot;zǒngduì&quot; () is the provincial formation. They are called &quot;corps&quot; by the PAP; Western analysts have used &quot;contingent&quot;, &quot;general corps&quot;, and &quot;detachment&quot;. Most are corps deputy leader grade formations. The exceptions are the Beijing and Xinjiang contingents which are corps leader grade; their subordinate entities, except for the logistics and equipment bureaus, are one grade higher than in the other contingents. Hong Kong and Macau do not have contingents. Contingents have mobile detachments and duty detachments ().

Duty detachments protect government compounds and perform routine duties; they may exist because the CCP lacks confidence in the ability of local public security forces to handle &quot;mass incidents&quot;.

Mobile detachments () are rapid reaction units roughly corresponding to PLAGF regiments. Some were existing contingent mobile units before the reforms. Most were transferred from the disbanded mobile divisions. Most contingents have one. In general, western provinces with large non-Han population have more than those in China&#x27;s interior.

Contingents are further subdivided at lower administrative levels. Regimental-level detachments () are found in provinces, prefectures, and specifically-designated cities. Battalions () are located in districts of the important cities and counties. Companies () are found in counties, townships, and villages. All contingents have subordinate elementary command colleges.

== Border Defense Corps ==
Prior to the 2018 reform, the People&#x27;s Armed Police Border Defense Corps () guarded China&#x27;s land and sea borders, as well as its ports and airports. Its main responsibilities were the administration of border and coastal public security, ports and border inspection and surveillance, performing patrols and surveillance activities in areas adjacent to Hong Kong and Macao, as well as patrols and surveillance activities along the demarcation line of the Beibu Gulf and the prevention of and crack-down on illegal and criminal acts in border and coastal areas, such as illegal border crossing, smuggling and drug trafficking.

After the 2018 reform, Port and Seaport detachments of Border Defense Corps have been transferred into the Ministry of Public Security, whereas responsibility of guarding land borders was completely handed over to PLAGF.

== China Coast Guard ==
The Chinese People&#x27;s Armed Police Force Coast Guard Corps, also abbreviated as China Coast Guard is the agency for maritime search and rescue and law enforcement in the territorial waters of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The China Coast Guard was formerly the maritime branch of the People&#x27;s Armed Police (PAP) Border Security Force under the Ministry of Public Security until 2013. In March 2013, China announced it would form a unified Coast Guard commanded by the State Oceanic Administration. This renewed Coast Guard has been in operation since July 2013. As of July 1, 2018, the China Coast Guard was transferred from civilian control of the State Council and the State Oceanic Administration, to the People&#x27;s Armed Police, ultimately placing it under the command of the Central Military Commission (CMC).

According to Joel Wuthnow, the Coast Guard Command within the People&#x27;s Armed Police possibly is of Corps Leader Grade, led by a Commandant who is usually holding Major General (Rear Admiral) rank.

In June 2018, China Coast Guard was granted maritime rights and law enforcement akin civilian law enforcement agencies in order to carry out contrast of illegal activities, keep peace and order, as well as safeguarding security at sea, when performing duties related to the use of marine resources, protection of marine environment, regulation of fishery, and anti-smuggling.

== Special police units ==

The People&#x27;s Armed Police maintains several Special Police Units. They were established in Beijing in early 1980s and in 1983 the first of them was transferred to the People&#x27;s Armed Police as the People&#x27;s Armed Police Special Police Group. In 1985 the Group became People&#x27;s Armed Police Special Police School and, in 2002, it became the People&#x27;s Armed Police Special Police Academy. In 2002, the Snow Wolf Commando Unit, since 2007 Snow Leopard Commando Unit, was established in Beijing as the second special police unit. According to Joel Wuthnow, the Snow Leopard Commando Unit was moved from the Beijing Contingent to the 2nd Mobile Contingent in 2018.

Special police units have a total of six Regiment-level Detachments. Of these six Detachments, three are under the 1st Mobile Contingent, two detachments are assigned to the 2nd Mobile Contingent. One Regiment-level Detachment is under the Xinjiang provincial command.

The special police units are tasked to carry out counter terrorism missions, riot control, anti-hijacking and bomb disposal.

=== Organization ===
Special Police Units are organized and placed at the Provincial level and at national level.

The national-level Special Police Unit is the People&#x27;s Armed Police Special Police Academy, reporting to the People&#x27;s Armed Police Headquarters. The academy has both educational and operational roles. On one hand, it is tasked to provide courses in special reconnaissance and special police operations; on the other hand, it has to carry out counter terrorism missions, riot control, anti-hijacking and bomb disposal. The main operational unit of the People&#x27;s Armed Police Special Police Academy is the Falcon Unit. In addition, the 1st and 2nd Mobile Contingents maintain a total of 5 Special Operations Detachments.

Each provincial contingent () establishes and maintains special police units as part of its own territorial organization. As of 2019, there are three known special police units within the People&#x27;s Armed Police:
* Falcon Commando Unit (Beijing, 1st Mobile Contingent)
* Snow Leopard Commando Unit (Guangzhou, 2nd Mobile Contingent)
* Mountain Eagle Commando Unit (Xinjiang Corps)
For what regards special operations detachments of the Mobile Contingents, some of the specialized units may have drawn from the provincial contingents.

According to a Chinese Ministry of National Defense article, special operations units in contingents receive Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) training.

== Communications ==
Using the national information infrastructure, the PAP has established a preliminary system of three-level integrated information networks, linking general headquarters with the grass-roots squadrons.

<text>Helvetica, also known by its original name Neue Haas [[Vox-ATypI_classification#Neo-grotesque|Grotesk]], is a widely-used sans-serif typeface developed in 1957 by Swiss typeface designer Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffmann.

Helvetica is a neo-grotesque design, one influenced by the famous 19th-century (1890s) typeface Akzidenz-Grotesk and other German and Swiss designs. Its use became a hallmark of the International Typographic Style that emerged from the work of Swiss designers in the 1950s and 1960s, becoming one of the most popular typefaces of the mid-20th century. Over the years, a wide range of variants have been released in different weights, widths, and sizes, as well as matching designs for a range of non-Latin alphabets. Notable features of Helvetica as originally designed include a high x-height, the termination of strokes on horizontal or vertical lines and an unusually tight spacing between letters, which combine to give it a dense, solid appearance.

Developed by the &quot;Haas&#x27;sche Schriftgiesserei&quot; (Haas Type Foundry) of Münchenstein (Basel), Switzerland, its release was planned to match a trend: a resurgence of interest in turn-of-the-century &quot;grotesque&quot; sans-serifs among European graphic designers, that also saw the release of Univers by Adrian Frutiger the same year. Hoffmann was the president of the Haas Type Foundry, while Miedinger was a freelance graphic designer who had formerly worked as a Haas salesman and designer.

Originally named Neue Haas Grotesk (New Haas Grotesque), it was soon licensed by Linotype and renamed Helvetica in 1960, which in Latin means , from , capitalising on Switzerland&#x27;s reputation as a centre of ultra-modern graphic design.

==History==

The first version of the typeface (which later became known as Helvetica) was designed in by Max Miedinger with art direction by Eduard Hoffmann. His goal was to design a new sans serif font that could compete in the Swiss market as a neutral font that should not be given any additional meaning. The main influence on Helvetica was Akzidenz-Grotesk from Berthold; Hoffman&#x27;s scrapbook of proofs of the design shows careful comparison of test proofs with snippets of Akzidenz-Grotesk. Its &#x27;R&#x27; with a curved tail resembles Schelter-Grotesk, another turn-of-the-century sans-serif sold by Haas. Wolfgang Homola comments that in Helvetica &quot;the weight of the stems of the capitals and the lower case is better balanced&quot; than in its influences.

Attracting considerable attention on its release as &quot;Neue Haas Grotesk&quot; (&quot;Nouvelle Antique Haas&quot; in French-speaking countries), Stempel and Linotype adopted Neue Haas Grotesk for release in hot metal composition, the standard typesetting method at the time for body text, and on the international market.

In , Stempel (the German parent company of Haas) changed the typeface&#x27;s name to &quot;Helvetica&quot;, to make it more marketable internationally; it comes from the Latin name for the pre-Roman tribes of what became Switzerland. Intending to match the success of Univers, Arthur Ritzel of Stempel redesigned Neue Haas Grotesk into a larger typeface family. The design was popular: Paul Shaw suggests that Helvetica &quot;began to muscle out&quot; Akzidenz-Grotesk in New York City from around summer 1965, when Amsterdam Continental, which imported European typefaces, stopped pushing Akzidenz-Grotesk in its marketing and began to focus on Helvetica instead. It was also made available for phototypesetting systems, as well as in other formats such as Letraset dry transfers and plastic letters, and many phototypesetting imitations and knock-offs were rapidly created by competing phototypesetting companies.

In the late 1970s and 1980s, Linotype licensed Helvetica to Xerox, Adobe and Apple, guaranteeing its importance in digital printing by making it one of the core fonts of the PostScript page description language. This led to a version being included on Macintosh computers, with Arial (a metrically compatible clone) included with Microsoft Windows computers. The rights to Helvetica are now held by Monotype Imaging, which acquired Linotype; the Neue Haas Grotesk digitisation (discussed below) was co-released with Font Bureau.

=== Characteristics ===

* Tall x-height, which makes it easier to read at distance.
* Tight spacing between letters.
* An oblique rather than italic style, a common feature of almost all grotesque and neo-grotesque typefaces.
* Wide capitals of uniform width, particularly obvious in the wide &#x27;E&#x27; and &#x27;F&#x27;.
* Square-looking &#x27;s&#x27;.
* Bracketed top flag of &#x27;1&#x27;.
* Rounded off square tail of &#x27;R&#x27;.
* Concave curved stem of &#x27;7&#x27;.
* Two-storied &#x27;a&#x27; (with curves of bowl and stem), a standard neo-grotesque feature, and single-storey &#x27;g&#x27;
Like many neo-grotesque designs, Helvetica has narrow apertures, which limits its legibility onscreen and at small print sizes. It also has no visible difference between upper-case &#x27;i&#x27; and lower-case &#x27;L&#x27;, although the number 1 is quite identifiable with its flag at top left. Its tight, display-oriented spacing may also pose problems for legibility. Other fonts intended for legibility at small sizes such as Verdana, Meta, Trebuchet, or a monospace font such as Courier, which makes all letters quite wide, may be more appropriate than Helvetica.

==Usage examples== 
Helvetica is among the most widely used sans-serif typefaces. Versions exist for Latin, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Greek, Japanese, Korean, Hindi, Urdu, Khmer, and Vietnamese alphabets. Chinese faces have been developed to complement Helvetica.

Helvetica is a common choice for commercial wordmarks: in 2007, the BBC remarked that a list of users &quot;would fill this page&quot;. 

Helvetica has been widely used by the U.S. government; for example, federal income tax forms are set in Helvetica. The Canadian government also uses Helvetica as its identifying typeface and encourages its use in all federal agencies and websites. Helvetica is commonly used in transportation settings. New York City&#x27;s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) adopted Helvetica for use in signage in 1989. Helvetica is also used in the Washington Metro, the Chicago &#x27;L&#x27;, Philadelphia&#x27;s SEPTA, and the Madrid Metro. 

The typeface was displaced from some uses in the 1990s to the increased availability of other fonts on digital desktop publishing systems, and criticism from type designers including Erik Spiekermann and Martin Majoor, both of whom have criticised the design for its omnipresence and overuse. Majoor has described Helvetica as &#x27;rather cheap&#x27; for its failure to move on from the model of Akzidenz-Grotesk.
==Media coverage==

An early essay on Helvetica&#x27;s public image as a font used by business and government was written in 1976 by Leslie Savan, a writer on advertising at the &quot;Village Voice&quot;. It was later republished in her book &quot;The Sponsored Life&quot;.

In 2007, Linotype GmbH held the Helvetica NOW Poster Contest to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the typeface. Winners were announced in the January 2008 issue of the LinoLetter.

In 2007, director Gary Hustwit released a documentary film, &quot;Helvetica&quot; (Plexifilm, DVD), to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the typeface. In the film, graphic designer Wim Crouwel said, &quot;Helvetica was a real step from the 19th century typeface... We were impressed by that because it was more neutral, and neutralism was a word that we loved. It should be neutral. It shouldn&#x27;t have a meaning in itself. The meaning is in the content of the text and not in the typeface.&quot; The documentary also presented other designers who associated Helvetica with authority and corporate dominance, and whose rebellion from Helvetica&#x27;s ubiquity created new styles.

From April 2007 to March 2008, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City displayed an exhibit called &quot;50 Years of Helvetica&quot;. In 2011 the Disseny Hub Barcelona displayed an exhibit called &quot;Helvetica. A New Typeface?&quot;. The exhibition included a timeline of Helvetica over the last fifty years, its antecedents and its subsequent influence, including in the local area.

In 2011, one of Google&#x27;s April Fools&#x27; Day jokes centered on the use of Helvetica. If a user attempted to search for the term &quot;Helvetica&quot; using the search engine, the results would be displayed in the font Comic Sans.

==Variants==
A large number of variants of Helvetica were rapidly released to expand on its popularity, including new weights and languages. Linotype confessed by the time of a 1976 advertorial that things had become somewhat confused: &quot;the series was not planned as a whole from its conception...the series is not as uniform as Univers&quot;.

===Helvetica Light===
Helvetica Light was designed by Stempel&#x27;s artistic director Erich Schultz-Anker, in conjunction with Arthur Ritzel.

===Helvetica Inserat===
Helvetica Inserat (German for &quot;advertisement&quot;) is a version designed primarily for use in the advertising industry: this is a narrow variant that is tighter than Helvetica Black Condensed. It gives the glyphs an even larger x-height and a more squared appearance, similar to Schmalfette Grotesk. Adobe&#x27;s release notes date it to 1966 and state that it originated with Stempel.

===Helvetica Compressed (1966)===
Designed by Matthew Carter and Hans-Jürg Hunziker for cold type. It shares some design elements with Helvetica Inserat, but uses a curved tail in Q, downward pointing branch in r, and tilde bottom £. Carter has said that in practice it was designed to be similar to Schmalfette Grotesk and to compete in this role with British designs Impact and Compacta, as this style was popular at the time. Carter, who also later designed Helvetica Greek, had designed a modernised version of Akzidenz-Grotesk for signage at Heathrow in 1961, and commented later &quot;if we&#x27;d known about [Helvetica] I&#x27;m sure we would have used it, since it&#x27;s a much better typeface than the one I drew. But the typesetting trade was very conservative then, and new type designs traveled slowly.&quot; The family consists of Helvetica Compressed, Helvetica Extra Compressed and Helvetica Ultra Compressed fonts. It has been digitised, for instance in the Adobe Helvetica release.

===Helvetica Rounded (1978)===
Helvetica Rounded is a version containing rounded stroke terminators, released for bold weights. Linotype&#x27;s release notes date it to 1978.

===Helvetica Narrow===
Helvetica Narrow is a version where its width is between Helvetica Compressed and Helvetica Condensed. The font was developed when printer ROM space was very scarce, so it was created by mathematically squashing Helvetica to 82% of the original width, resulting in distorted letterforms, with vertical strokes narrowed but horizontals unchanged. Because of the distortion problems, Adobe dropped Helvetica Narrow in its release of Helvetica in OpenType format, recommending users choose Helvetica Condensed instead.

===Helvetica Textbook===
Helvetica Textbook is an alternate design of the typeface, which uses &#x27;schoolbook&#x27; stylistic alternates to increase distinguishability: a seriffed capital &#x27;i&#x27; and &#x27;j&#x27; to increase distinguishability, a &#x27;q&#x27; with a flick upwards and other differences, such as the digits &#x27;1&#x27; and &#x27;4&#x27; similar to how handwritten digits are. The letters &#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;t&#x27;, &#x27;u&#x27;, and the digits &#x27;6&#x27; and &#x27;9&#x27; are replaced with designs similar to those in geometric sans-serifs such as those found in Futura, Akzidenz-Grotesk Schulbuch, and Avant Garde (except for &#x27;u&#x27;). FontShop&#x27;s FF Schulbuch is similar.

===Language variants===
Helvetica Greek has gone through several versions. Letraset designed a semi-official version for their dry transfer lettering system, available by 1970, which sold well but was considered unidiomatic by Linotype. Linotype published a 1971 version designed by Matthew Carter which was available for phototypesetting and so for general purpose printing such as extended text. Carter felt in 1974 that the Letraset version was &quot;a poor thing&quot; and Linotype&#x27;s version was &quot;the real one&quot; but that Letraset&#x27;s was well-enough accepted in Greece that he felt it had &quot;caused resistance to our version&quot;. Linotype published a new version in 2001 designed by John Hudson at Tiro Typeworks.

The Cyrillic version was designed in-house in the 1970s at D Stempel AG, then critiqued and redesigned in 1992 under the advice of Jovica Veljović, although a pirated version had already been created in 1963 by Russian designers Maxim Zhukov and Yuri Kurbatov.

=== Helvetica World ===

Helvetica World supports Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, and Vietnamese scripts.

The family consists of four fonts in two weights and one width, with complementary italics.

The Arabic glyphs were based on a redesigned Yakout font family from Linotype. Latin kerning and spacing were redesigned to have consistent spacing. John Hudson of Tiro Typeworks designed the Hebrew glyphs for the font family, as well as the Cyrillic, and Greek letters.

==Neue Helvetica (1983)==
Neue Helvetica (), sometimes Helvetica Neue in some digital files, is a reworking of the typeface with a more structurally unified set of heights and widths. Other changes include improved legibility, heavier punctuation marks, and increased spacing in the numbers.

Neue Helvetica uses a numerical design classification scheme, like Univers. The font family is made up of 51 fonts including nine weights in three widths (8 in normal width, 9 in condensed, and 8 in extended width variants) as well as an outline font based on Helvetica 75 Bold Outline (no Textbook or rounded fonts are available). Linotype distributes Neue Helvetica on CD. Neue Helvetica also comes in variants for Central European and Cyrillic text.

It was developed at D. Stempel AG, a Linotype subsidiary. The studio manager was Wolfgang Schimpf, and his assistant was Reinhard Haus; the manager of the project was René Kerfante. Erik Spiekermann was the design consultant and designed the literature for the launch in 1983. Figures were widened and some condensed weights changed from having nearly flat-sided verticals to a more continuous curve throughout the entire height.

Designer Christian Schwartz, who would later release his own digitisation of the original Helvetica designs (see below), expressed disappointment with this and other digital releases of Helvetica: &quot;digital Helvetica has always been one-size-fits-all, which leads to unfortunate compromises...the spacing has ended up much looser than Miedinger&#x27;s wonderfully tight original at display sizes but much too tight for comfortable reading at text sizes.&quot;

iOS used first Helvetica then Neue Helvetica as its system font. All releases of macOS prior to OS X Yosemite (10.10) used Lucida Grande as the system font. The version of Neue Helvetica used as the system font in OS X 10.10 is specially optimised; Apple&#x27;s intention is to provide a consistent experience for people who use both iOS and OS X. Apple replaced Neue Helvetica with the similarly looking San Francisco in iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan (10.11), meaning OS X 10.10 was the only macOS version to use Neue Helvetica as the system font.

=== Neue Helvetica W1G (2009) ===
It is a version with Latin Extended, Greek, Cyrillic scripts support. Only OpenType CFF font format was released.

The family includes the fonts from the older Neue Helvetica counterparts, except Neue Helvetica 75 Bold Outline. Additional OpenType features include subscript/superscript.

=== Neue Helvetica Arabic (2009) ===

Designed by Lebanese designer Nadine Chahine, it is a version with Arabic script support. Only OpenType TTF font format was released.

The family includes three fonts in three weights and one width, without italics (45, 55, 65).

===Neue Helvetica eText (2011)===
It is a version of Neue Helvetica optimised for on-screen use, designed by Akira Kobayashi of Monotype Imaging. Changes from Neue Helvetica include more open spacing. Unlike Helvetica, the capitals are reduced in size so the lower-case ascenders rise above them, a common feature associated with text typefaces.

The family includes eight fonts in four weights and one width, with complementary italics (45, 46, 55, 56, 65, 66, 75, 76). OpenType features include numerators/denominators, fractions, ligatures, scientific inferiors, subscript/superscript.

===(Neue) Helvetica Thai (2012)===
Thai font designer Anuthin Wongsunkakon of Cadson Demak Co. created Thai versions of Helvetica and Neue Helvetica fonts. The design uses loopless terminals in Thai glyphs, which had also been used by Wongsunkakon&#x27;s previous design, Manop Mai (New Manop).

=== Neue Helvetica Georgian (2015) ===

It is a version with Georgian script support. Designed by Akaki Razmadze at Monotype Bad Homburg.

Only OpenType CFF and TTF font formats were released.

The family includes eight fonts in eight weights and one width, without italics (25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95).

===Neue Helvetica Armenian (2016)===
Designed by Edik Ghabuzyan, it is a version of Neue Helvetica supporting Armenian language.

The family includes 16 fonts in 8 weights (ultra light, thin, light, regular, medium, bold, heavy, black) with complementary italics.

===Neue Helvetica World (2017)===
Designed by Nadine Chahine, Linotype Design Studio, Monotype Design Studio and Edik Ghabuzyan, it is a version of Neue Helvetica with support of Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Thai, Armenian, Georgian and Vietnamese scripts for total 181 languages, and complete support of Unicode block u+0400. Published in November 2017 by Linotype, it was released in Truetype and OpenType CFF formats.

The family includes 6 fonts in 3 weights (45 Light, 55 Roman, 75 Bold), with complimentary italic. Roman fonts include 1,708 glyphs and 1,285 glyphs for italics.

For working with other languages, the publisher also recommended following complementary fonts:
* Devanagari: Saral Devanagari
* Japanese: Tazugane Gothic, Yu Gothic
* Korean: YD Gothic 100, YD Gothic 700
* Simplified Chinese: M Ying Hei PRC, M Hei PRC
* Traditional Chinese: M Ying Hei HK, M Hei HK

== Neue Haas Grotesk (2010) ==

Christian Schwartz&#x27;s digitisation is based on original settings of the metal type and uses the typeface&#x27;s original name. It was released by Linotype (later Monotype Imaging), Commercial Type, and Font Bureau with an article on the history of Helvetica by Professor Indra Kupferschmid.

Unlike earlier digitisations, Schwartz created two different optical sizes (labelled Text and Display), which have different spacing metrics giving tighter spacing at display size and looser spacing to increase legibility in body text. The release includes a number of features not present on digitisations branded as Helvetica, stylistic alternates such as separate punctuation sets for upper- and lower-case text, &quot;modernist&quot; cedilla designs styled to match the comma and reduced-height numbers to blend into extended text. Both optical sizes provide stylistic alternates for a straight-legged upper case &quot;R&quot;, while the Display variant additionally provides stylistic alternates for a lower case &quot;a&quot; without tail. It originated from an abandoned redesign plan for &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper. Writing for &quot;Typographica&quot;, Matthew Butterick described the release as better than any previous digital release of Helvetica &quot;it&#x27;s never looked better&quot;. Users include Bloomberg Businessweek, the Whitney Museum, and for the album &quot;Midnights&quot; by Taylor Swift. Schwartz&#x27;s company Commercial Type have additionally developed a companion monospaced version, agate version for small sizes and stencil font. The release does not include condensed weights or support for Greek and Cyrillic.

===Variable Font Version===

The Text optical size of Neue Haas Grotesk is available on Windows 11 via &quot;Pan-European Supplemental Fonts&quot; optional feature. This version is a variable font and provides weights ranging from Ultra Thin to Black. As of 2023, the variable font version of Neue Haas Grotesk is not yet otherwise available.

Neue Haas Grotesk Text is also available on Windows 10 via &quot;Pan-European Supplemental Fonts&quot;, but this release includes static fonts instead of variable fonts.

==Helvetica Now (2019)==

In April 2019, Monotype announced an update of Neue Helvetica called &quot;Helvetica Now&quot;, designed by Jan Hendrik Weber and Charles Nix of Monotype Imaging. The family has one width in three optical sizes, Text, Micro and Display in 8, 6, and 10 weights respectively. The condensed version corresponding to these optical sizes and weights was published later in 2021, along with Helvetica Now Variable.

A key difference between the three optical sizes is the terminal design: Display retains the horizontal terminals in previous digital releases of Helvetica; Micro features diagonal terminals for many characters (e.g., lowercase &quot;e&quot; and &quot;c&quot;); while the design of Text is somewhere in between Display and Micro. 

Features include circled figures and redesigned arrow and @ glyphs. It also includes a number of alternate characters including curled lower-case &quot;L&quot;, spurless rounded &quot;G&quot;, a straight-legged &quot;R&quot; (found in Neue Haas Grotesk), single-story &quot;a&quot; (found in Helvetica Textbook) and lowercase &quot;u&quot; without a spur.

===Helvetica Now Variable (2021)===
Helvetica Now was also released as a variable font, which has two styles (Regular and Italic) and three adjustable axes (weight, width, and optical size). Supported weight ranges include hairline to extra black, optical sizes include four point to infinity, widths include compressed and condensed.

==Helvetica clones==

Derivative designs based on Helvetica were rapidly developed, taking advantage of the lack of copyright protection in the phototypesetting font market of the 1960s onward. Some of these were straight clones, simply intended to be direct substitutes. Many of these are almost indistinguishable from Helvetica, while some add subtle differences.

Substitute Helvetica designs that have survived into or originated during the digital period have included Monotype&#x27;s Arial, Compugraphic&#x27;s CG Triumvirate, ParaType&#x27;s Pragmatica, Bitstream&#x27;s Swiss 721, URW++&#x27;s Nimbus Sans and Scangraphic&#x27;s Europa Grotesk. Berthold itself responded to Helvetica&#x27;s popularity with Akzidenz-Grotesk Buch, effectively a Helvetica clone. Besides Helvetica imitations, Helvetica was available in custom derivatives with unusual special-order characters for many years, notably a straight-legged &#x27;R&#x27; and round-topped &#x27;A&#x27;. CNN uses a custom derivative, &quot;CNN Sans&quot;, which has a &#x27;1&#x27; with a base and larger x-height.

===Nimbus Sans===
URW (later URW++) under the leadership of Peter Karow produced a modification of Helvetica called Nimbus Sans. This is an extremely large font family with optical sizes spaced for different sizes of text and other variants such as stencil styles. Florian Hardwig has described its display-oriented styles, with tight spacing, as more reminiscent of Helvetica as used in the 1970s from cold type than any official Helvetica digitisation.

===Arial and MS Sans Serif===
Monotype&#x27;s Arial, created for IBM and also used by Microsoft, is indistinguishable by most non-specialists. Matthew Carter, who was a consultant for IBM during its design process, describes it as &quot;a Helvetica clone, based ostensibly on their Grots 215 and 216&quot; (Monotype&#x27;s old 1920s sans-serif family, popular in British trade printing in the metal type period, and itself based on the Bauer Venus-Grotesk family). Differences include:
* Helvetica&#x27;s strokes are typically cut either horizontally or vertically. This is especially visible in the t, r, f, and C. Arial employs slanted stroke cuts, following Monotype Grotesque.
* Helvetica&#x27;s G has a spur at bottom right; Arial does not, but instead has a vertical stroke connecting the curved portion to the crossbar.
* The tail of Helvetica&#x27;s R is more upright whereas Arial&#x27;s R is more diagonal.
* The number 1 of Helvetica has a square angle underneath the upper spur, Arial has a curve.
* The Q glyph in Helvetica has a straight cross mark, while the cross mark in Arial has a slight curve.
The design was created to substitute for Helvetica: Arial (and many other clones of the period) are metrically identical to the PostScript version of Helvetica, so that a document designed in Helvetica could be displayed and printed correctly without IBM having to pay Linotype for a Helvetica license on its printers.

Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Helv&quot; design, later known as &quot;MS Sans Serif&quot;, is a sans-serif typeface that shares many key characteristics to Helvetica, including the horizontally and vertically aligned stroke terminators and more-uniform stroke widths within a glyph.

===Free Helvetica substitute fonts===

* Nimbus Sans L, a version of URW&#x27;s Nimbus Sans spaced to match the standard Linotype/PostScript version of Helvetica, was released under the GNU General Public License in 1996, and donated to the Ghostscript project to create a free PostScript alternative. It (or a derivative) is used by much open-source software such as R as a system font.
* TeX Gyre Heros – a derivative of Nimbus Sans L with enhanced letter forms and metrics – has been prepared for use in the TeX scientific document preparation software, and since 2009 general under the GUST font license.
* FreeSans is a free font descending from URW++ Nimbus Sans L, which in turn descends from Helvetica. It is one of free (GPL) fonts developed in GNU FreeFont project, first published in 2002.

Other such typefaces take creative liberties from Helvetica and its basic letter shapes.

* Liberation Sans is a metrically equivalent font to Arial developed by Steve Matteson at Ascender and published by Red Hat under the SIL Open Font License. It is used in some Linux distributions as default font replacement for Arial. Oracle funded the additional development of Liberation Sans Narrow in 2010. Google commissioned a variation named Arimo for ChromeOS.
* Roboto was developed by Christian Robertson of Google as the system font for its Android operating system; this has a more condensed design with the influence of straight-sided geometric designs like DIN 1451.
* Inter (originally Inter UI) is a fork of Roboto that resembles Apple&#x27;s San Francisco typeface.
* Mona Sans, a GitHub variable font released under SIL Open Font License, stands out from the above examples with its &#x27;single-storey&#x27; lowercase a.
==Derivative designs==
Some fonts based on Helvetica are intended for different purposes and have clearly different designs. Digital-period font designer Ray Larabie has commented that in the 1970s &quot;everyone was modifying Helvetica with funky curls, mixed-case and effects&quot;. Indeed, in one 1973 competition to design new fonts, three of the 20 winners were decorative designs inspired by Helvetica.

=== Zhukov and Kurbatov version ===
In 1963, two students at the Moscow Print Institute designed their own version of Helvetica, one of whom, Maxim Zhukov, would become one of the Soviet Union&#x27;s most prominent typographers. Zhukov and his partner Yuri Kurbatov used upright cursive forms for several of the lowercase letters, which allowed for several of the Helvetica forms to be transferred more directly into Cyrillic.

Their version received widespread use in phototypesetting, especially among other students at the Moscow Print Institute, despite never being commercially released. Zhukov and Kurbatov attempted to publish the typeface in 1964 but were rejected due to the font&#x27;s being too closely associated with capitalism; this was one of the major factors as to why an official Cyrillic Helvetica, &quot;Pragmatica&quot;, would not be released in the Soviet bloc until perestroika in 1989.

===Forma (1968)===

Created by Aldo Novarese at the Italian type foundry Nebiolo, Forma was a geometric-influenced derivative of Helvetica with a &#x27;single-storey&#x27; &#x27;a&#x27; and extremely tight spacing in the style of the period. It was offered with &#x27;request&#x27; stylistic alternates imitating Helvetica more closely. Forma has been digitised by SoftMaker as &quot;Formula&quot; and (in a much more complete version with optical sizes) as Forma DJR by David Jonathan Ross at Font Bureau for &quot;Tatler&quot; magazine.
===Manoptica===
 Manoptica (1973) was an early effort to adapt Helvetica to the Thai script. It is named after and designed by Manop Srisomporn, who designed several typefaces for Thai using the same innovations he used for Manoptica (such as an adaptation of Eurostile). It was highly influential in Thai typography in that it popularized the removal of the small loops and other flourishes that had theretofore been distinguishing marks on Thai characters and adopted letter forms that bore strong resemblance to Latin letters. It became a widely popular style in advertising and influenced other simplified typefaces for Thai in the following decades. The adoption of loopless typefaces remains a source of controversy in Thai typography.
===Helvetica Flair and others===

Designed by Phil Martin at Alphabet Innovations, Helvetica Flair is an unauthorised phototype-period redesign of Helvetica adding swashes and unicase-inspired capitals with a lower-case design. Considered a hallmark of 1970s design, it has never been issued digitally. It is considered to be a highly conflicted design, as Helvetica is seen as a spare and rational typeface and swashes are ostentatious: font designer Mark Simonson described it as &quot;almost sacrilegious&quot;. Martin would later claim to have been accused of &quot;typographic incest&quot; by one German writer for creating it.

Helvetica Flair was one of several derivative fonts created by Martin in the 1970s (and a particularly legally questionable one, since it was directly named &#x27;Helvetica&#x27;). Martin also drew &#x27;Heldustry&#x27;, a fusion of Helvetica with Eurostile, and &#x27;Helserif&#x27;, a redesign of Helvetica with serifs, and these have both been digitised.
===Shatter LET (1973)===
Designed by Vic Carless, Shatter assembles together slices of Helvetica to make a typeface that seems to be in motion, or broken and in pieces. It was published by Letraset after jointly winning their 1973 competition to design new fonts.

Writing in 2014, Tim Spencer praised the design for its ominous effect, writing that it offered &quot;glitch-like mechanical aggression [and] cold, machine-induced paranoia. It attacked the Establishment&#x27;s preferred information typography style with a sharp edge and recomposed it in a jarring manner that still makes your eyes skitter and your brain tick trying to recompose it. Shatter literally sliced up Swiss modernist authority.&quot;
===Unica===

Unica by &quot;Team &#x27;77&quot; (André Gürtler, Christian Mengelt and Erich Gschwind) is as a hybrid of Helvetica, Univers and Akzidenz-Grotesk. It was developed in the 1970s for electronic on-screen phototypesetting and released in 1980. As phototypesetting was soon replaced by desktop publishing and because of a legal dispute, the typeface rapidly disappeared from the market. In mid 2010s, two digital versions were released: the Swiss foundry Lineto released LL Unica77 with input from Christian Mengelt, while Linotype released Neue Haas Unica.

===Chalet===
House Industries&#x27; Chalet family is a series of fonts based on Helvetica, inspired by its many derivatives and adaptations in post-war design, and organised by &quot;date&quot; to &#x27;1960&#x27; (conventional), &#x27;1970&#x27; and &#x27;1980&#x27; (both more radically altered and &quot;science fiction&quot; in feel). House Industries, who are known for outlandish font marketing methods, promoted Chalet through presenting it as inspired by the branding and career progression of a fictitious Swiss &quot;haute couture&quot; designer, &quot;René Chalet&quot; (&quot;Chalet&quot; being French for a small wooden house, so a play on the design company&#x27;s name).
===Coolvetica===

In the digital period, Canadian type designer Ray Larabie has released several digital fonts based upon Helvetica. The most widely known and distributed of these is Coolvetica, which Larabie introduced in 1999; Larabie stated he was inspired by Helvetica Flair, Chalet, and similar variants in creating some of Coolvetica&#x27;s distinguishing glyphs (most strikingly a swash on capital &#x27;G&#x27;, lowercase &#x27;y&#x27; based on the letterforms of &#x27;g&#x27; and &#x27;u,&#x27; and a fully curled lowercase &#x27;t&#x27;), and chose to set a tight default spacing optimised for use in display type. Larabie&#x27;s company Typodermic offers Coolvetica in a wide variety of weights as a commercial release, with the semi-bold as freeware taster. As of 2017, the semi-bold remains Larabie&#x27;s most popular font. Larabie has also taken inspiration from Helvetica in some of his other designs, including Movatif and GGX88.

<text>Jim Duffy (born 12 April 1966) is an Irish historian and political commentator who served as a policy advisor to Fine Gael then-leader of the Opposition, Enda Kenny prior to the 2011 general election. He first achieved prominence in 1990 when the contents of his on-the-record interview with then Tánaiste Brian Lenihan, in which Lenihan admitted making calls to the residence of the Irish president seeking to speak to President Hillery to urge him to refuse a Dáil dissolution in controversial circumstances (something he had previously denied), led to Lenihan&#x27;s dismissal from government, his defeat in that year&#x27;s Irish presidential election and the unexpected election of the left wing liberal Mary Robinson as President of Ireland.

Duffy was one of six people chosen to submit international reports on heads of state to Australia&#x27;s Republic Advisory Committee in 1993. He was an occasional contributor to &quot;The Irish Times&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;, and a columnist in &quot;Magill&quot; magazine, as well as appearing on radio and television prior to his appointment to Kenny&#x27;s office, but has ceased all media work since that date. 

==Origins==
Duffy was born in Drogheda in Meath in 1966. His family are long-term residents of the townland of Durhamstown in the civil parish of Ardbraccan outside Navan in County Meath. On his maternal side, through his mother Bernadette Duffy (née Cadden) he is descended from Ballydurrow, in Munterconnaught, County Cavan.

Jim Duffy was educated in Bohermeen National School and St. Patrick&#x27;s Classical School in Navan, where his classmates included the journalist Simon Cumbers (who was killed by Al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia in 2004). In 1984 Duffy began to study History and Politics in University College Dublin, achieving a 2:1 degree in 1987. He received a first class honours degree for his post-graduate thesis on the presidency of Ireland in 1991.

==Lenihan Interview==
In 1990 as part of his postgraduate thesis for his Master of Arts in Political Science Duffy interviewed senior politicians, one of whom was the then Tánaiste, Brian Lenihan. The on-the-record interview, in May 1990, formed one source for a major series of articles on the presidency of Ireland, published in &quot;The Irish Times&quot; in September 1990. In the interview Lenihan confirmed what he had previously confirmed to other writers over eight years, that on 27 January 1982 he, along with party leader Charles Haughey and a colleague, Sylvester Barrett, had repeatedly phoned Áras an Uachtaráin, the residence of the President of Ireland, to try to put pressure on the President, Patrick Hillery, to refuse a dissolution of parliament to the Taoiseach (prime minister), Dr Garret FitzGerald. (FitzGerald&#x27;s government had just been defeated in Dáil Éireann in a vote on the budget.)

In October 1990, in the midst of the presidential election, FitzGerald was to be a guest, alongside Lenihan, on RTÉ One&#x27;s &quot;Questions and Answers&quot; political debate programme. He has previously issued a press release about the phone calls issue, but it had received no publicity. He decided to raise the issue of the calls again on the programme, given that in the preceding week Lenihan changed his story of eight years and had now denied twice, first in a student debate, then in an Irish Press interview with Emily O&#x27;Reilly, making any calls. When challenged on the programme Lenihan maintained that his October 1990 version was correct, denying that he had played &quot;any hand, act of part&quot; in attempts to pressurise President Hillery. FitzGerald had been in Áras an Uachtaráin on the night of the calls and had been told by the President&#x27;s staff that Lenihan had persistently been making calls. FitzGerald aggressively challenged Lenihan, saying &quot;I was in the Áras, Brian, and I know how many calls there were.&quot;

Aware that Lenihan had been one of Duffy&#x27;s sources for the original article in September, with Duffy&#x27;s permission the Irish Times ran a front-page story stating that Lenihan had made the calls he was now denying. In the resulting furore Lenihan&#x27;s campaign manager Bertie Ahern either deliberately or accidentally revealed on a radio programme that Duffy had interviewed Lenihan. Duffy became the subject of mounting political and media pressure, with his silence being spun by Fianna Fáil press staff as evidence that the rumours that Lenihan had confirmed to him that he had made calls were false. (Lenihan had assured his campaign team that he had said nothing in the interview that could cause problems.) After three days of intense political and media pressure, Duffy released the relevant proportion of the on-the-record tape interview he had done with Lenihan. The release took place in a press conference in a Dublin hotel.

The release of the tape threw Lenihan&#x27;s campaign into meltdown. Lenihan tried in a subsequent live television interview on the &quot;Six-One News&quot; to insist that what he had said to Duffy was wrong, insisting that &quot;on mature recollection&quot; his October 1990 version was the correct one, and all that he had said previously over eight years was incorrect. However his popularity plummeted by 18% overnight. The opposition Fine Gael party put down a Motion of No Confidence in the government. The Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, denied that Lenihan was under any pressure to resign. However, when the minority party in government, the Progressive Democrats, threatened to quit government unless Lenihan resigned or was sacked, and Lenihan refused to resign, the Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, instructed President Hillery to sack him. Lenihan went on to become the first candidate from his party ever to lose an Irish presidential election, with the Labour Party candidate, Mary Robinson, eventually winning the office.

Duffy was strongly attacked by the Taoiseach and members of the government under parliamentary privilege, with claims that his research was bogus and that he had been part of a secret plot to destroy Lenihan. However, his thesis on the presidency of Ireland was awarded a First Class honour by the National University of Ireland. He has written an account of the events of this period in the March 2006 edition of Magill magazine.

==Advising the Republic Advisory Committee==
On the basis of his studies of international heads of state, Duffy was one of six people (including Sir Ellis Clarke, the former Governor-General and President of Trinidad and Tobago) commissioned in 1993 by Australia&#x27;s Republic Advisory Committee to prepare reports on international republican experiences —to appear as an appendix to the committee&#x27;s main report. His report, along with those of five others, was submitted as part of that larger report to the then Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating.

Duffy&#x27;s recommendations formed a part of the debate in Australia on the possible move from being a monarchy to become a republic. His description of heads of state as fitting three distinct categories (chief executive, Nominal chief executive and Non-Executive) was widely used in the subsequent debate, and were referred to in major speeches by all sides in the debate.

During the constitutional referendum on creating a republic in 1999 Duffy in Australian media interviews was critical of the form of presidency being proposed, arguing in particular that the lack of security of tenure offered to the proposed office holder would seriously compromise the office holder&#x27;s independence and ability to exercise their powers.

The 1999 referendum on declaring an Australian republic was ultimately defeated.

==Media and research work==
During the 1990s and 2000s, Duffy worked as a researcher and as a political commentator for most major Irish publications, including &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;, the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Business Post&quot; and the &quot;Irish Examiner&quot;. He also was a contributor to RTÉ radio and television, the BBC, UTV and Sky News. His contributions largely focused on politics, history, religion and current affairs.

He was a columnist with &quot;Magill&quot; magazine, Ireland&#x27;a major political and current affairs magazine, until October 2007 when he resigned to take up a research post in politics.

In April and May 2007 he was one of the main contributors to &quot;Uachtarán&quot;, an eight-part TG4 documentary on the office of President of Ireland.

==Political advisor==
In May 2007, the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; reported that Duffy had been appointed a Deputy Press Officer for Fine Gael for the duration of 2007 general election.

In October 2007 Duffy was appointed a policy officer in his office by the leader of Fine Gael, Enda Kenny. Duffy resigned his post as columnist with Magill magazine and since that date has ceased to do media work. His new role also involves participating in the National Forum on Europe, a government-created think-tank on the relationship between the European Union and Ireland.

==Writings on religion and gay marriage==
He was a contributor to the Irish Times&#x27;s &quot;Rite and Reason&quot; religious column on more than one occasion. One article in 1998, proposing the existence of &quot;Rites of Same Sex Union&quot; (in effect gay marriages) in early Christian prayerbooks up to mediaeval times, caused a controversy. The article has been republished on gay websites and some religious websites worldwide and has been quoted in debates on gay marriage in the United States, France, the Netherlands and has also featured in parliamentary debates in Ireland, including a submission in 2005 from a gay advocacy group to the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which was exploring whether to amend the Constitution of Ireland to allow gay marriage.

<doc id="147378" wikidata="Q1134208" url="?curid=147378" title="The Irish Times">
<text>The Irish Times is an Irish daily broadsheet newspaper and online digital publication. It was launched on 29 March 1859. The editor is Ruadhán Mac Cormaic. It is published every day except Sundays. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; is Ireland&#x27;s leading newspaper. It is considered a newspaper of record for Ireland.

Though formed as a Protestant Irish nationalist paper, within two decades and under new owners, it became a supporter of unionism in Ireland.

In the 21st century, it presents itself politically as &quot;liberal and progressive&quot;, as well as being centre-right on economic issues. The editorship of the newspaper from 1859 until 1986 was controlled by the Anglo-Irish Protestant minority, only gaining its first nominal Irish Catholic editor 127 years into its existence.

The paper&#x27;s notable columnists have included writer and arts commentator Fintan O&#x27;Toole and satirist Miriam Lord. The late Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald was once a columnist. Michael O&#x27;Regan was the Leinster House correspondent for more than 30 years. Senior international figures, including Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, have written for its op-ed page.

Its most prominent columns have included the political column &quot;Backbencher&quot;, by John Healy; &quot;Drapier&quot; (an anonymous piece produced weekly by a politician, giving the &#x27;insider&#x27; view of politics); &quot;Rite and Reason&quot; (a weekly religious column, edited by Patsy McGarry, the religious affairs editor); and the long-running &quot;An Irishman&#x27;s Diary&quot;. &quot;An Irishman&#x27;s Diary&quot; was written by Patrick Campbell in the forties (under the pseudonym &quot;Quidnunc&quot;); by Seamus Kelly from 1949 to 1979 (also writing as &quot;Quidnunc&quot;); and in the early 2000s by Kevin Myers. After Myers&#x27; move to the rival &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, &quot;An Irishman&#x27;s Diary&quot; has usually been the work of Frank McNally. On the sports pages, Philip Reid is the paper&#x27;s golf correspondent.

One of its most popular columns was the biting and humorous &quot;Cruiskeen Lawn&quot; satire column written, originally in Irish, later in English, by Myles na gCopaleen, the pen name of Brian O&#x27;Nolan (Brian Ó Nualláin) who also wrote books using the name Flann O&#x27;Brien. &quot;Cruiskeen Lawn&quot; is an anglicised spelling of the Irish words &quot;crúiscín lán&quot;, meaning &quot;little full jug&quot;. &quot;Cruiskeen Lawn&quot; made its debut in October 1940, and appeared with varying regularity until O&#x27;Nolan&#x27;s death in 1966.

==History==
===Origins in 19th century===
A newspaper entitled &quot;The Irish Times&quot; was founded in 1823, but this closed in 1825. The title was revived decades later by Lawrence E. Knox, (later known as Major Lawrence Knox), a 22-year-old army officer. Initially he published thrice-weekly publication but soon shifted to a daily newspaper; the first edition was published on 29 March 1859. He founded it as a moderate Protestant newspaper, reflecting his politics. Knox envisaged it as a &quot;new conservative daily&quot;. Its headquarters were at 4 Lower Abbey Street in Dublin. Its main competitor in its early days was the Dublin &quot;Daily Express&quot;.

After Knox&#x27;s death in 1873, the paper was sold to the widow of Sir John Arnott, a Member of Parliament (MP), a former Lord Mayor of Cork, and owner of Arnotts, one of Dublin&#x27;s major department stores.

The sale, for £35,000, led to two major changes. Arnott shifted the headquarters to 31 Westmoreland Street; the newspaper operated from this area until 2005. Its politics shifted dramatically, and it became predominantly Unionist in outlook. It was closely associated with the Irish Unionist Alliance. The paper, along with the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; and various regional papers, called for the execution of the leaders of the failed 1916 Easter Rising.

===20th century===
Though the paper became a publicly-listed company in 1900, the Arnott family continued to hold a majority shareholding until the 1960s (even after the family lost control, the great-grandson of the original purchaser was the paper&#x27;s London editor). The last member of the Arnott family to sit on the paper&#x27;s board was Sir Lauriston Arnott, who died in 1958.

During the 1930s, the editor was R. M. Smyllie.
The longest-serving editor of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; was Douglas Gageby.

In 1974, ownership was transferred to a non-charitable trust, The Irish Times Trust. The former owner, Major Thomas McDowell, was made &quot;president for life&quot; of the trust that runs the paper; he was paid a large dividend.

The paper established its first bureau in Asia when foreign correspondent Conor O&#x27;Clery moved to Beijing, China, in 1996.

===21st century===
&quot;The Irish Times&quot; suffered considerable financial difficulty in 2002 when a drop in advertising revenue coincided with a decision by the company to invest its reserves in the building of a new printing plant. None of the journalists was laid off, but many took a voluntary redundancy package when the paper was greatly restructured.

Some foreign bureaus were closed and it stopped publishing &quot;colour&quot; pages devoted to Irish regions, with regional coverage merged with news. The paper&#x27;s problems stemmed partly from internal strife, which led to McDowells&#x27;s daughter, Karen Erwin, not being made chief executive. The reorganisation had the desired effect; after posting losses of almost €3 million in 2002, the paper returned to profit in 2003.

In May 2005, the paper launched a new international edition, which was available in London and southeast England at the same time as other daily newspapers (previously, copies of the Irish edition were flown from Dublin to major cities in Britain on passenger flights, arriving around lunchtime). It was printed at the Newsfax plant in Hackney, and uses the &quot;Financial Times&quot; distribution network.

In 2008 the Central Bank of Ireland fined &quot;The Irish Times&quot; after its management admitted breaking market abuse rules.

In 2009, the Supreme Court ordered the paper to pay €600,000 in costs, despite it having won its case in support of protecting journalistic sources. The court said the paper&#x27;s destruction of evidence was &quot;reprehensible conduct&quot;.

When the Irish government signed the Companies Act 2014, the Trust registered the overall Irish Times Group as a designated activity company, The Irish Times Designated Activity Company (The Irish Times DAC).

In December 2017, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; reportedly had reached an agreement to purchase the newspaper, radio and website interests of Landmark Media Investments, which include the &quot;Irish Examiner&quot;. Initially subject to regulatory approval, the sale was completed in July 2018.

In September 2018, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; started a voluntary redundancy scheme. This followed the Landmark Media Investments acquisition.

====Diversification====
The company has diversified from its original &quot;Irish Times&quot; title as a source of revenue. Irish Times Limited has taken a majority share for €5m in the Gazette Group Newspapers, a group publishing three local newspapers in West Dublin, and has acquired a property website, MyHome.ie, the second-largest property internet website in Ireland, for €50m, seen as insurance against the loss of revenue from traditional classified property advertising.

In June 2009, journalists called on the board and trust to review &quot;the flawed investment and diversification strategy of the company&quot; and passed a motion saying that &quot;ongoing investment in loss-making projects poses a serious threat to employment&quot; at the newspaper. Four months later, the company announced a loss of €37 million and that 90 staff would be made redundant. The director, Maeve Donovan, who instigated the &quot;investment and diversification&quot; strategy, subsequently retired. She dismissed suggestions that she would receive a significant &quot;golden handshake&quot;, saying that her package would be &quot;nothing out of the ordinary at all&quot;. She was given a €1m &quot;ex-gratia&quot; payment by the newspaper &quot;relating to a commutation of pension rights agreed with her&quot;.

The managing director said in 2009 that mobile phone applications would be a key investment for newspapers and &quot;The Irish Times&quot; now has an application for the iPhone and Android smartphones.

In June 2010, Gazette Group Newspapers&#x27; managing director claimed the company&#x27;s affairs were being conducted oppressively by its majority shareholder, &quot;the Irish Times&quot;.

On 2 May 2024, it was announced that the Irish Times Group had acquired obituary business RIP.ie.

==Political stances and controversial stories==
The editor during the 1930s, R. M. Smyllie, had strong anti-fascist views, and angered the Irish Catholic hierarchy by opposing General Franco during the Spanish Civil War. During World War II, &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, like other national newspapers, had problems with Irish Government censorship. The Times was largely pro-Allies and was opposed to the Éamon de Valera government policy of neutrality.

In 1969, the longest-serving editor of &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, Douglas Gageby, was allegedly called a &quot;white nigger&quot; by company chairman Thomas Bleakley McDowell, because of the newspaper&#x27;s coverage of Northern Ireland at the outset of the Troubles, which was supportive of Irish nationalism.

John Waters, a columnist who spoke out about the perceived vast salaries of the editor, managing director and deputy editor, was sacked and re-hired a week later, in November 2003. Former editor Geraldine Kennedy was paid more than the editor of the UK&#x27;s top non-tabloid newspaper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, which has a circulation of about nine times that of &quot;The Irish Times&quot;. Later, columnist Fintan O&#x27;Toole told the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;: &quot;We as a paper are not shy of preaching about corporate pay and fat cats but with this there is a sense of excess. Some of the sums mentioned are disturbing. This is not an attack on Ms Kennedy, it is an attack on the executive level of pay. There is double-standard of seeking more job cuts while paying these vast salaries.

On 23 December 2004, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; ran a front-page story on the Provisional IRA&#x27;s denial of involvement in the Northern Bank robbery, one of Europe&#x27;s largest ever, and on the same day refused to print a column by Kevin Myers which said that the Provisional IRA was responsible. Myers was reported to be shocked by the spiking of his column. Some two weeks later, the paper printed a report that there might, after all, be a &quot;nationalist&quot; connection. Myers later left the paper in May 2006.

&quot;The Irish Times&quot; tended to support the 2007 Lisbon Treaty, which adjusted the operation of the European Union. However, opposing views were also printed, including articles by Declan Ganley of Libertas Ireland, and other anti-Lisbon campaigners.

On 31 July 2010, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; published an article titled &quot;The fighting Irish&quot; about Irish nationals who enlisted in the British Armed Forces. The article featured interviews with members of the Royal Irish Regiment and the Irish Guards. It was subsequently criticised by current affairs magazine &quot;The Phoenix&quot;, which argued that the article romanticised the War in Afghanistan and served as little more than an indirect advertisement for the British military. &quot;The Phoenix&quot; accused the editor of &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, Geraldine Kennedy, of violating the Irish Defence Act which prohibits all forms of military recruitment advertising on the behalf of foreign militaries.

On 9 September 2011, the paper published a pseudonymous article by Kate Fitzgerald. Unknown to the paper, she had taken her life on 22 August 2011. The revelation sparked a nationwide debate on suicide with her parents appearing on television to discuss suicide and depression. The article criticised the reaction to her illness by her employer, The Communications Clinic, although it was only after she was identified as the author that her employer became known. The article was later removed from the paper&#x27;s website, causing controversy online. The editor later told her parents that sections of her article were factually incorrect, but could not say which ones. Kate&#x27;s parents complained to the Office of the Press Ombudsman about an apology made to The Communications Clinic, their complaint was upheld.

In September 2019, the paper reprinted an article from the &quot;New York Times&quot; by William Broad. The article claimed that &quot;the blossoming anxiety over professed health risks of 5G [fifth generation wireless technology] &#x27;can be traced to a single scientist and a single chart. A complaint to the Office of the Press Ombudsman of the Press Council of Ireland was filed by Professor Tom Butler of the University College Cork. The Press Council Ombudsman upheld Butler&#x27;s complaint, ruling that &quot;&quot;The Irish Times&quot; breached Principle 1 (Truth and Accuracy) of the Code of Practice of the Press Council of Ireland&quot;.

==Governance ==
In 1974, ownership was transferred to a non-charitable trust, The Irish Times Trust. The former owner, Major Thomas McDowell, was made &quot;president for life&quot; of the trust which runs the paper and was paid a large dividend. However several years later the articles of the Trust were adjusted, giving Major McDowell 10 preference shares and one more vote than the combined votes of all the other directors should any move be made to remove him. McDowell died in 2009.
The Trust is regulated by a legal document, the Memorandum and Articles of Association, and controlled by a body of people (the Governors) under company law. It is not a charity and does not have charitable status. It has no beneficial shareholders and it cannot pay dividends. Any profits made by &quot;The Irish Times&quot; cannot be distributed to the Trust but must be used to strengthen the newspaper, directly or indirectly. The Trust is composed of a maximum of 11 Governors. The Trust appoints Governors who are required to be &quot;representative broadly of the community throughout the whole of Ireland&quot;. As of June 2012, Ruth Barrington is the chair of the trust, and the governors are Tom Arnold, David Begg, Noel Dorr, Margaret Elliott, Rosemary Kelly, Eoin O&#x27;Driscoll, Fergus O&#x27;Ferrall, Judith Woodworth, Barry Smyth, and Caitriona Murphy.

In 2015, The Irish Times Trust Limited joined as a member organisation of the European Press Prize.

==Offices==
In 1895, the paper moved from its original offices on Middle Abbey Street to D&#x27;Olier Street in the centre of Dublin. &quot;D&#x27;Olier Street&quot; became a metonym of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; which in turn was personified as &quot;The Old Lady of D&#x27;Olier Street&quot;. In October 2006, the paper relocated to a new building on nearby Tara Street.

==Irish Times Literature Prizes==

The Irish Times Literature Prizes were established in 1988, with the inaugural Irish Times International Fiction Prize (worth £7,500 in 1998) awarded in 1989. The Irish Literature Prizes (four categories, each worth £5,000 in 1998) were awarded for fiction, poetry, and non-fiction written in English. In 1998, a separate prize was for the first time awarded for a work in the Irish language, for the most outstanding title of all of the categories, which was awarded by a separate panel of judges.

===Digital===
In 1994, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; established a web presence on IEunet.ie, which moved to the address Irish-times.ie in 1995; it was the first newspaper in Ireland and one of the first 30 newspapers in the world to establish an online presence. The company acquired the domain name &quot;ireland.com&quot; in 1997, and from 1999 to 2008, used it to publish its online edition. This was freely available at first but charges and a registration fee were introduced in 2002 for access to most of the content. A number of blogs were added in April 2007, written by Jim Carroll, Shane Hegarty, and Conor Pope. On 30 June 2008, the company relaunched &quot;ireland.com&quot; as a separate lifestyle portal and the online edition of the newspaper was now published at &quot;irishtimes.com&quot;. Access to news on the new domain name was supplied free of charge, but a subscription was charged to view its archives.

On 15 October 2012 John O&#x27;Shea, Head of Online, &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, announced that the &quot;ireland.com&quot; domain name had been sold to Tourism Ireland, and that the associated &quot;ireland.com&quot; email service would end on 7 November 2012. The domain name was sold for €495,000. The ending of the email service affected about 15,000 subscribers.

The newspaper announced on 17 February 2015 the reintroduction of a paywall for its website, &quot;irishtimes.com&quot;, beginning on 23 February.

<doc id="147384" wikidata="Q1175932" url="?curid=147384" title="David Norris (politician)">
<text>David Patrick Bernard Norris (born 31 July 1944) is an Irish scholar, former independent Senator, and civil rights activist. Internationally, Norris is credited with having &quot;managed, almost single-handedly, to overthrow the anti-homosexuality law which brought about the downfall of Oscar Wilde&quot;, a feat he achieved in 1988 after a fourteen-year campaign. He has also been credited with being &quot;almost single-handedly responsible for rehabilitating James Joyce in once disapproving Irish eyes&quot;.

Norris is a former university lecturer and was a member of the Oireachtas, serving in Seanad Éireann from 1987 to 2024. He was the first openly gay person to be elected to public office in Ireland. A founder of the Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform, he is also a prominent member of the Protestant Church of Ireland.

He was a candidate for President of Ireland in the 2011 election. He topped numerous opinion polls and was favourite among members of the Irish public for the position but withdrew from the race months before the election, before returning to the race in September 2011. In January 2024 he retired from the Seanad after 36 years service, making him the longest serving senator in Irish history.

==Early and personal life==
David Norris was born in Léopoldville in the Belgian Congo, now known as Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where his father (John Norris) worked as chief engineer for Lever Brothers. John Norris served in the British Armed Forces during World War I and World War II; he died while Norris was still a child. David Norris was then sent to Ireland to be cared for by his mother, Aida Fitzpatrick, and her extended family.

::...while, on hearing his dad had died, he &quot;had to squeeze out tears&quot; because they were never that close, the death of his mother, was &quot;totally heartbreaking&quot;.

::&quot;It destroyed my sense of reality,&quot; he adds, now. &quot;This was somebody I loved who was there one minute, then the next minute she was gone.&quot;

After first meeting in 1975, Norris was in a long-term relationship with Israeli activist Ezra Nawi for a number of years until 1985. They continued a platonic friendship after that. In a Today FM interview with Matt Cooper in Summer 2011 Norris said (paraphrasing) &quot;nowadays people think of a romantic relationship as a sexual one and Ezra and myself have not had that kind of relationship since the 1980s.&quot;

==Education and academic career==
Norris attended school at St. Andrew&#x27;s College and The High School. He then entered Trinity College Dublin, to read for the degree of B.A. in English Literature and Language, where he was elected a Foundation Scholar in 1965 in that subject before achieving a 1st Class Moderatorship in 1967 and editing &quot;Icarus&quot;, the university literary magazine. He remained at Trinity as a lecturer and college tutor between 1968 and 1996. His love of Joyce is borne out in Dublin&#x27;s annual Bloomsday celebrations. He defended &quot;Ulysses&quot; when Roddy Doyle said it was &quot;overlong, overrated and unmoving&quot;, calling Doyle a &quot;foolish&quot; and &quot;moderate talent&quot;. He is an Irish language speaker. He is also a Hebrew language speaker.

After contracting the water-borne variation of hepatitis while visiting Central Europe in 1994, Norris received disability payments from a private income continuance insurer worth thousands of euro over 16 years, from a Trinity College insurance policy. Norris left his role as a lecturer after Trinity College authorities said the situation arising from his illness was &quot;untenable&quot;, although he remained an elected senator. Norris was hospitalised and was seriously ill for a time as a result of the condition.

==Campaigning and activism==
Norris took the Attorney General to the High Court over the criminalisation of homosexual acts. His claim was based on the fact that the law infringed on his right to privacy and that since the introduction of the Constitution of Ireland, the law passed under British rule became repugnant to the constitution. The High Court ruled against Norris. He appealed his case to the Supreme Court of Ireland. In 1983 (in &quot;Norris v. Attorney General&quot;), the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law by a three to two verdict.

Having lost the Supreme Court case, Norris took his case to the European Court of Human Rights (see &quot;Norris v. Ireland&quot;). In 1988, the European Court ruled that the law criminalising same-sex activities was contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights, in particular Article 8 which protects the right to respect for private life. The law was held to infringe on the right of adults to engage in acts of their own choice.

This law was repealed in 1993.

Norris has since then expanded his activism to a concept of &quot;universal rights&quot;.

==Political career==
===Senator (1987 to 2024)===
Norris represented the Dublin University constituency in the Seanad as an independent. He was first elected to the Seanad in 1987, and was re-elected at each election until his resignation in 2024. On 14 November 2023, he announced in an interview with &quot;Trinity News&quot; that he would retire in January 2024. He resigned from the Seanad in January 2024, and received tributes from president Michael D. Higgins and taoiseach Leo Varadkar delivered to the cathaoirleach. On his retirement, he was the longest-serving senator in Irish history.

===2011 presidential campaign===
====Entry====
In March 2011, Norris announced his intention to run in the 2011 Irish presidential election. Facebook support for a presidential bid drew comparisons with Barack Obama&#x27;s campaign for the American presidency. Norris topped multiple opinion polls as the person most Irish people would like to see as their next president (with the caveat that these polls were taken before all candidates have declared). Internal research by Fine Gael also placed Norris ahead of all other potential candidates.

On 14 March 2011, Norris launched his campaign to secure a nomination. On 9 May 2011, he was nominated by Fingal County Council. By the end of that month, he had secured the support of 6 TDs. Fine Gael ordered its councillors to block Norris&#x27;s nomination. In late May, controversial comments Norris allegedly made in 2002 were raised on a talk radio show. Norris called this an attempt to &quot;sabotage&quot; his campaign. He said the quotes had been taken out of context.

Norris&#x27;s candidacy was endorsed by British actor and writer Stephen Fry, who said Ireland &quot;couldn&#x27;t have a more intelligent passionate and knowledgeable witty or committed President&quot;.

In late July, it was revealed that Norris had written a letter in 1997 to an Israeli court asking clemency for his former partner Ezra Nawi, who had been convicted of the statutory rape of a 15-year-old Palestinian boy but was awaiting sentencing. Norris&#x27;s letter, written on parliamentary notepaper, said that Nawi had been lured into a &quot;carefully prepared trap&quot; and had unwisely pleaded guilty to the charges. The story was publicised by a pro-Israel blogger John Connolly. Connolly stated that he had received a tip from &quot;someone in the trade union movement&quot;. A number of people resigned from Norris&#x27;s campaign team. While Norris himself said he remained committed to his campaign, he admitted that it was now &quot;in serious trouble&quot;. It was claimed by some that these allegations, complete with Norris&#x27;s subsequent defence of his comments on pederasty in ancient Greece would seriously damage his chances of securing a nomination. Norris refuted this, saying he still expected to receive a nomination, and the controversy did not affect his poll standings.

====Withdrawal====
As of 22 July, Norris had secured the support of 15 of the 20 members of the Oireachtas required for a nomination. On 1 August, the Independent TDs John Halligan, Finian McGrath and Thomas Pringle announced that they were withdrawing their support for Norris over the revelations of the Nawi plea. However, several other TDs re-iterated their support for Norris in his bid to become president. Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan, TD referred to a &quot;nasty campaign&quot; when expressing her continued support for Norris. Wicklow TD Stephen Donnelly said he believed it was wrong for Norris to have used Oireachtas headed notepaper, while Mick Wallace, TD said he believed Norris should not have sent the plea. Both Donnelly and Wallace also reaffirmed their support for Norris. Norris expressed his desire to continue his campaign for president. However, on 2 August, Norris announced at a press conference held at his home that he was withdrawing from the presidential race.

====Re-entry====

Despite withdrawing from the presidential race in July 2011, Norris maintained considerable and, in some cases, increased public support. A poll taken one week after Norris withdrew from the presidential race, showed a large increase in public support for his presidency if they were given the choice to vote for him (topping the poll by a considerable margin) with 40 per cent of respondents now saying they would vote Norris number one in the preferential voting electoral system and 50 per cent saying they would give him a vote.

In Galway city alone, more than 1,000 signatures in support of Norris for President were gathered from members of the public in just 12 hours on the weekend of 11 September. There was similar support in the city of Cork. Days later, Norris was presented with a petition of 10,000 signatures outside Leinster House, collected nationwide by the We Want Norris campaign. As a result, Norris announced his return to the campaign on the Irish television talk programme &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; on Friday 16 September 2011, though he did not reveal the precise number of signatures belonging to TDs and Senators that he had secured. A &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;/Millward Brown Lansdowne opinion poll published on 18 September showed a high amount of popular support for Senator David Norris of 34 per cent.

Norris continued to seek support from Oireachtas members to gain a nomination, being nominated by 18 members, two short of the minimum number of 20. However, he received a nomination from four county councils (Fingal, Laois, Waterford and Dublin City), which was sufficient to gain a nomination. He was assisted by his election rival, Labour Party candidate Michael D. Higgins, who urged his party colleagues on Dublin City Council to allow Norris onto the ticket &quot;in the interests of democracy&quot;. When Norris heard this on the radio he instructed his driver to stop the car so that he could phone Higgins to express his appreciation.

According to &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, as of 30 September, Norris had four times as many followers on Twitter as any of the other candidates.

In the first debate, held on RTÉ Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;News at One&quot;, Norris promised the electorate he would have no difficulty in either visiting Israel or in meeting Pope Benedict XVI as president of Ireland. Speaking after the disclosure of various fees received by his rivals Mary Davis and Seán Gallagher after they were appointed to State and commercial boards, Norris confirmed he had no stocks or shares to his name and that he was not a company director. Norris launched his campaign at Dublin Writers Museum on 5 October 2011.

He came fifth of seven candidates in the election receiving 109,469 (6.2%) first preference votes.

==Views==
On his website Norris lists his concerns as &quot;Human Rights Issues, Foreign Policy, Immigration/Asylum, European Union, Luas/Metro&quot;.

He owns a Georgian house in North Great George&#x27;s Street in Dublin, he is a member of the Irish Georgian Society and is an active campaigner for the preservation of Georgian buildings in the Republic of Ireland. He has spent many of his own earnings on restoring his own home &quot;room by room&quot;. He has campaigned for the transfer of the Abbey Theatre (National Theatre of Ireland) to the GPO in the centre of O&#x27;Connell Street. Norris is also a well-known Joycean scholar and plays a large part in Dublin&#x27;s annual Bloomsday celebrations.

Norris is a Christian and regularly attends Church of Ireland services. He said the following of his religious beliefs:

I am the kind of Christian who believes that the most important theological principle is the principle of positive doubt. Even Christ doubted, on the cross. And I think if people say they hear the voice of God all the time and say they know what to do, then impose that on you, politically, it is theological tyranny. Whereas if you have doubt, it stops you from abusing your religious belief. Religion can be so abused in the interests of power, especially on behalf of institutions and governments.

Norris believes himself to be an &quot;outsider&quot; of &quot;accepted society&quot; and claims this gives him a heightened awareness of other minority or &quot;outsider&quot; groups. He says he wishes society to become more accepting of diversity. He has campaigned on mental health and child abuse issues.

Norris has spoken in favour of the Republic of Ireland rejoining the Commonwealth of Nations, which it left when it became a republic in 1949. He dismissed the position of the British monarch as Head of the Commonwealth as &quot;largely titular&quot;.

When questioned on drug legalisation he said:

The blunt instrument of criminalisation is not working because of the vast profits it generates for organised crime ... my view is that the welfare of the community, including the victims of drug abuse, may be better served by having access to quality controlled, legally prescribed drugs.

On 31 July 2014, he delivered a speech at Seanad Éireann about the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict to denounce the violations of human rights by the State of Israel. The video clip of the speech attracted more than 300,000 views on YouTube making Norris, at the time, the most successful Irish politician to appear on YouTube. He said:

[...] I am in favour of human rights, whether one is Israeli, gay, a woman or black. I am not changing my position. I am not anti-Israel or anti-Semitic, but I am pro-human rights for every human being.

==Controversy==
===Fairytale of Kathmandu===

On 11 March 2008, Norris called for the broadcast of the documentary &quot;Fairytale of Kathmandu&quot; (scheduled to be shown that evening on RTÉ) to be postponed. The film documented visits to Nepal by Irish poet Cathal Ó Searcaigh, during which he had sex with young boys. It questioned whether he was sexually exploiting the boys or engaging in child sex tourism. Norris criticised that the film had been leaked beforehand and that Ó Searcaigh had been treated harshly by the media before its broadcast. He announced to the Seanad that the film should be checked for factuality because he claimed that &quot;public money&quot; had been spent on it. The issue was conveyed to Deputy John Cregan, the Chairman of the &quot;Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources&quot;.

===Easter Rising comments===
An article in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; claimed that Norris had, on more than one occasion, denounced the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising as &quot;terrorists&quot;. In May 2011, Norris denied that article&#x27;s claim also, saying &quot;That&#x27;s not true, it&#x27;s a slur, and it&#x27;s not fair on me. Terrorists are people who use civilian casualties to advance a political end. The men of 1916 produced the proclamation, addressed equally – in an age when women didn&#x27;t have the vote – to &#x27;Irishmen and Irishwomen&#x27;, that&#x27;s wonderful!&quot;. The newspaper printed a retraction.

===Criticism of Pope John Paul II===
Norris has made statements about Catholic social teaching on homosexuality, particularly in relation to the Papacy. He criticised Pope John Paul II&#x27;s statements on homosexuality because he said they led to anti-gay violence, saying that the pope was an &quot;instrument for evil as far as I&#x27;m concerned because these constant, unremitting, ignorant, ill-informed attacks on the gay community have led to violence against the gay community&quot;. Norris also described the pope&#x27;s position as &quot;calculated and deliberate wickedness&quot; because he &quot;closes down scholarly enquiry&quot; and because he &quot;marginalised all the wonderful people like Oscar Romero, Leonardo Boff, Hans Kung, Charles Curran, all these marvellous people who are the future and the hope of the Church and, instead, put into place these mindless bureaucrats, which is intensely sad.&quot; Commenting on then Cardinal Ratzinger, he said, &quot;Ratzinger, who is, in his mind-set, a Nazi&quot; because he is &quot;afraid to tell the truth,&quot; and because he and John Paul II &quot;won&#x27;t even let themselves be in the presence of the truth, because it would shatter their very stylised view of things.&quot; He later stated that he regretted using the term &quot;Nazi&quot; in reference to Ratzinger.

===2002 &quot;Magill&quot; magazine interview===
In a January 2002 interview for politics/current affairs magazine &quot;Magill&quot;, Norris discussed the age of consent, incest, paedophilia and pederasty. The interviewer, restaurant critic Helen Lucy Burke, said, &quot;I found some of his views on sexual matters deeply disturbing – notably on sex with minors&quot;. According to Burke, Norris didn&#x27;t seem to support a minimum age of consent. When asked &quot;Where would you draw the line?&quot; Norris replied, &quot;I would hope we could produce a society where people would be inclined to draw lines for themselves&quot;. On 30 May 2011, Burke was a guest on the talk radio show &quot;Liveline&quot;. Burke said that she had read the article to Norris before its publication and that he had wholeheartedly endorsed what was written. During the show, it was noted that the &quot;Magill&quot; article had been reported in a newspaper shortly after publication. The newspaper, &quot;Ireland on Sunday&quot;, went with the headline &quot;Senator Backs Sex With Children&quot;. Burke claimed that, when Norris saw the reaction to the interview, he &quot;back-tracked&quot; and denied saying what had been quoted. She also called Norris&#x27; views &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;against the law&quot;.

According to Norris, he was only read two paragraphs of the interview before publication, and he asked for corrections to be made to those paragraphs, and these corrections were not made. In a May 2011 statement on his presidential campaign website, Norris affirmed &quot;I did not ever and would not approve of the finished article as it appeared&quot;. Norris asserts that he and Burke engaged in an &quot;academic discussion about Classical Greece and sexual activity in a historical context; it was a hypothetical, intellectual conversation&quot; and that the &quot;presentation of references to sexuality in the article attributed to me were misleading in that they do not convey the context in which they were made&quot;. Norris also spoke about the &quot;Magill&quot; profile in an interview with Joe Jackson for the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;, in which he refutes the allegations, saying he responded in &quot;horror&quot;, and that &quot;it so completely misrepresents everything I said. In the interview I said I cannot understand how anyone would consider it appropriate to have sex with children&quot;.
During the initial interview on 30 May 2011, Burke explained on Liveline that she had &quot;a tape somewhere around but I can&#x27;t find it, it&#x27;s twelve years old and I don&#x27;t know whether it would be viable now&quot;. Also, when Burke was asked if she had a tape while being interviewed on &quot;RTÉ News: Six One&quot; on 31 May 2011 by Caitríona Perry, Perry asserted that &quot;despite originally believing that she had a recording of the interview, Helen Lucy Burke is now not so sure&quot;. Burke explained, &quot;I don&#x27;t think so, I thought I had a taped cassette, but it turns out that it was in the one, I wasn&#x27;t able to open it because it was a different length from the one in my existing cassette box&quot;. When Caitríona Perry asked &quot;Do you think you have a tape anywhere else&quot;, Burke replied, &quot;it could be under the mountains of stuff that came down when my ceiling came in&quot;. In the last days of the campaign the tape was released and according to the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, Ms. Burke &quot;said yesterday she found the tape recently but only released it in the last days of the campaign for &quot;impact.&quot; She said, &quot;it would give people something to think about when they went to the polls.&quot;

<text>Primus is an American rock band formed in El Sobrante, California in 1984. The band is currently composed of bassist/vocalist Les Claypool, guitarist Larry &quot;Ler&quot; LaLonde, and drummer John Hoffman. Primus originally formed in 1984 with Claypool and guitarist Todd Huth, later joined by drummer Jay Lane, though the latter two had departed the band by the beginning of 1989, and were replaced by LaLonde and Tim &quot;Herb&quot; Alexander respectively.

The &quot;classic&quot; lineup of Claypool, LaLonde and Alexander debuted with the live album &quot;Suck on This&quot;, which was self-released in 1989 on Claypool&#x27;s label Prawn Song and reissued a year later by Caroline Records. Caroline also released Primus&#x27; debut studio album &quot;Frizzle Fry&quot; (1990), which was critically well received, and its underground success led to interest from major record labels. Their second studio album and major-label debut &quot;Sailing the Seas of Cheese&quot; (1991), released through Interscope Records, launched the band into mainstream exposure, supported by their first charting single &quot;Jerry Was a Race Car Driver&quot; and receiving platinum certification within a decade after its release. Primus repeated its success with their next two albums, &quot;Pork Soda&quot; (1993) and &quot;Tales from the Punchbowl&quot; (1995), both charting in the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and being certified platinum and gold respectively by the RIAA. &quot;Pork Soda&quot; featured the band&#x27;s top ten hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; rock chart, &quot;My Name Is Mud&quot;, while &quot;Tales from the Punchbowl&quot;″s lead single &quot;Wynona&#x27;s Big Brown Beaver&quot; holds the distinction of being the band&#x27;s only song to chart anywhere outside of North America.

Alexander left the band in 1996 and was replaced by Bryan &quot;Brain&quot; Mantia, with whom Primus recorded two more studio albums – &quot;Brown Album&quot; (1997) and &quot;Antipop&quot; (1999) – as well as the covers EP &quot;Rhinoplasty&quot; (1998) and the original theme song for the TV show &quot;South Park&quot;. The band went on hiatus in 2000 but resumed activity in 2003, reuniting with Alexander for the EP/DVD &quot;Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People&quot; and touring sporadically throughout the 2000s before Alexander left a second time in 2010. Lane rejoined the band and appeared on their seventh studio album – and first in twelve years – &quot;Green Naugahyde&quot; (2011). Following Lane&#x27;s departure in 2013, Alexander returned to the band once again and Primus would record two more albums with him – &quot;Primus &amp; the Chocolate Factory with the Fungi Ensemble&quot; (2014) and &quot;The Desaturating Seven&quot; (2017) – as well as the EP &quot;Conspiranoid&quot; (2022). Alexander announced his third departure from the band in October 2024, and was replaced four months later by John Hoffman.

Primus is characterized by its irreverent, quirky approach to music distinguished by Claypool&#x27;s bass-centric songwriting and eccentric lyrical themes. The band&#x27;s musical style, which draws influences from progressive rock, metal, funk, and psychedelic music, has been noted as difficult to categorize and is most frequently described by critics as funk metal, a label the band has rejected. In 1993, Robert Christgau remarked: &quot;[Primus is] quite possibly the strangest top-10 band ever, and good for them.&quot;

==History==
===The early years, &quot;Suck on This&quot; and &quot;Frizzle Fry&quot; (1984–1990)===
In 1984, singer and bassist Les Claypool and guitarist Todd Huth began playing together in El Sobrante, California, under the name Primate. The duo were initially accompanied by a LinnDrum drum machine as they had trouble finding a drummer, until Claypool&#x27;s friend Vince &quot;Perm&quot; Parker returned home from a stint in the army. Claypool, Huth and Parker recorded the band&#x27;s first demo tape together, financed by Claypool selling his car. Primate then changed their name to Primus after &quot;about a month&quot; when they were contacted by the legal representative of a group called the Primates threatening legal action over the similarity of their names. Parker was soon replaced by the band&#x27;s second drummer, Peter Libby, who played on the first demo tape recorded under the name Primus. In the next few years Libby was then replaced by Robbie Bean, who was himself replaced by Tim &quot;Curveball&quot; Wright in 1986.

By 1988, Primus had found success in the Bay Area music scene; it was to the point where they were &quot;getting pretty popular [...] selling out at Berkeley Square&quot;, when they &quot;[got] rid of&quot; Wright. He was replaced by Jay Lane, drummer with the Freaky Executives, who were &quot;getting dicked around by their record company&quot; at the time, as Claypool later described it. This lineup of Claypool, Huth and Lane recorded the demo tape &quot;Sausage&quot; (which later gave its name to the band Sausage), before &quot;something good happened&quot; with the Freaky Executives&#x27; record deal and Lane left the group. Bryan &quot;Brain&quot; Mantia is said to have briefly joined to play drums during this period after Lane&#x27;s departure, until a broken foot forced him to leave. Huth soon also left in order to dedicate more time to his family, as he had recently had a son and was expecting another.

At this time in 1988, Claypool had been &quot;moonlighting&quot; in his words, playing bass for his former band, Blind Illusion, which also featured guitarist Larry &quot;Ler&quot; LaLonde. LaLonde was a former member of the band Possessed, a student of Joe Satriani, and &quot;one of [Claypool&#x27;s] best friends&quot;. This lineup of Blind Illusion recorded the album &quot;The Sane Asylum&quot; before Claypool and LaLonde left the band in late 1988 to reform Primus.

In January 1989, Claypool and LaLonde were joined by Tim &quot;Herb&quot; Alexander, drummer from the Arizona-based group Major Lingo. A month later, this lineup recorded the band&#x27;s first album: &quot;Suck on This&quot;, a live recording culled from two of their Berkeley Square concerts. The initial pressing of 1,000 records was funded by a loan from Claypool&#x27;s father, and after repaying him, the band used the profits from selling these to fund further pressings, later signing a deal with Rough Trade Records for nationwide distribution. The band also sent copies of the album to college radio stations across the United States, many of which gave it significant airplay, and it quickly gained traction.

In December 1989, Primus recorded their first studio album: &quot;Frizzle Fry&quot;, which the band self-funded with the profits from sales of &quot;Suck on This&quot;. In 1990, the band signed a one-album deal with Caroline Records to release &quot;Frizzle Fry&quot; on condition that Caroline also obtained the rights to reissue &quot;Suck on This&quot;. The band then spent the year touring North America and Europe in support of bands such as 24-7 Spyz, the Pixies and Jane&#x27;s Addiction, and soon attracted attention from a number of major record labels. They signed to Interscope Records in 1991.

It was during these early years that the band developed their iconic catchphrase &quot;Primus sucks&quot;. According to Claypool, this began as fans of the band would compliment them, and Claypool would reply &quot;Nah, we suck&quot;. The band then started introducing themselves on stage by saying &quot;We&#x27;re Primus, and we suck&quot;, and fans quickly adopted the phrase, shouting &quot;Primus sucks&quot; at the group as a sign of affection. Audiences also began chanting the phrase at the band&#x27;s concerts, both before the start of the show and as a call for an encore. The band embraced it and began printing and selling t-shirts with &quot;Primus sucks&quot; written on them. Claypool, talking about the phrase, said &quot;I think it&#x27;s the greatest thing [...] somebody can come right up to me and say, &#x27;You guys really &quot;suck&quot;.&#x27; And I would just take it as a compliment.&quot;

===&quot;Sailing the Seas of Cheese&quot;, &quot;Pork Soda&quot;, and &quot;Tales from the Punchbowl&quot; (1991–1996)===
Primus&#x27;s major label debut was the album &quot;Sailing the Seas of Cheese&quot;. The album was supported by the singles &quot;Jerry Was a Race Car Driver&quot; and &quot;Tommy the Cat&quot;, both of which appeared on MTV. A third single, &quot;Those Damned Blue-Collar Tweekers&quot;, was also released but did not feature a video. &quot;Tommy the Cat&quot; appeared on the soundtrack of &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot; and the band made a cameo appearance in the film. Primus made a Beavis and Butt-Head tribute song entitled &quot;Poetry and Prose&quot; which appeared on the tie-in album &quot;The Beavis and Butt-Head Experience.&quot; With a major label behind them, &quot;Sailing the Seas of Cheese&quot; went gold. The band then toured in support of Rush, U2, Anthrax, Public Enemy, and Fishbone.

After the release of &quot;Sailing the Seas of Cheese&quot;, in 1992, Primus released a cover song EP &quot;Miscellaneous Debris&quot;, with their version of XTC&#x27;s &quot;Making Plans for Nigel&quot; receiving enough airplay to reach No. 30 on Billboard&#x27;s Modern Rock Tracks chart.

In 1993, Primus released &quot;Pork Soda&quot;, which managed to debut at No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album was darker than previous Primus efforts, dealing with murder, suicide, and alienation. The band has commented that prior to recording, they had been touring for nearly two solid years and were thus in a sombre mood. &quot;My Name Is Mud&quot; was the first single, reaching No. 9 on the U.S. Alternative Songs chart. &quot;DMV&quot; and &quot;Mr. Krinkle&quot; followed, the latter made into a video featuring Claypool in a pig suit and tuxedo playing upright bass in an abandoned warehouse as a carnival of oddities parades behind him, including Claypool&#x27;s wife and her twin sister. Claypool said he put his &quot;heart and soul&quot; into the video, but it received next to no airtime on MTV. In an interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine, Claypool disparaged the channel&#x27;s unwillingness to air the video, saying &quot;it got played like six times.&quot;

&quot;Pork Soda&quot; was recorded at the band&#x27;s rehearsal space in San Rafael. The band would subsequently record all of their albums at Claypool&#x27;s home studio called Rancho Relaxo (a Simpsons TV show reference).

In 1993, Primus headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza. They also made an appearance at the Woodstock &#x27;94 Music Festival. They were pelted with mud while they performed &quot;My Name Is Mud&quot;. About a minute into the song the band stopped playing, and Claypool said, &quot;Well I opened a big-ass can of worms with that one, didn&#x27;t I? The song is called &#x27;My Name Is Mud&#x27;, but keep the mud to yourselves you son-of-a-bitch.&quot;

During a lull in 1994, the early Primus lineup of Claypool, Huth, and Lane reunited to record &quot;Riddles Are Abound Tonight&quot; under the band name Sausage, named after the demo they had recorded together in 1988. Among the songs they recorded is an early version of &quot;The Toys Go Winding Down&quot;, retitled &quot;Toyz 1988&quot;. The video for the title track &quot;Riddles Are Abound Tonight&quot; featured the band in blue leotards performing on stationary bicycles.

In 1995, Primus released their fourth album, &quot;Tales from the Punchbowl&quot;. It contained Primus&#x27;s most successful single to date, which is the Grammy-nominated &quot;Wynona&#x27;s Big Brown Beaver&quot;. The song was accompanied by a video with the band members dressed up in cartoonish plastic cowboy costumes (similar to the suits worn in the then-current Duracell battery commercials). The band was invited to perform on the Late Show with David Letterman and Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien. On the David Letterman show, Primus appeared dressed in penguin tuxedos. Two other less successful singles, &quot;Mrs. Blaileen&quot; and &quot;Southbound Pachyderm&quot; (the latter of which featured a claymation video that received only minimal airplay on MTV) were also released.

In 1996, Claypool self-produced his first solo album entitled &quot;Les Claypool and the Holy Mackerel Presents Highball with the Devil&quot;. On this album many of the songs are done solely by Claypool himself. Claypool also employs the help of a number of other musicians. Experimental Bay Area guitarist M.I.R.V. joined Claypool and others. Performances include a spoken word piece from Henry Rollins on the song &quot;Delicate Tendrils&quot;. This album was recorded at Rancho Relaxo.

===Tim Alexander&#x27;s departure, &quot;Brown Album&quot;, &quot;Antipop&quot;, and hiatus (1996–2002)===

Alexander left the band and was replaced by Bryan &quot;Brain&quot; Mantia of Limbomaniacs and Praxis. Claypool stated &quot;Herb&#x27;s departure was like a marriage that just slowly decayed to an end.&quot; With Mantia aboard, Primus were asked in 1996 to compose the theme song to &quot;South Park&quot;. Primus also later contributed to the &quot;Chef Aid&quot; album with the song &quot;Mephisto and Kevin&quot;.

&quot;Brown Album&quot; was released in 1997 and supported by the singles &quot;Shake Hands with Beef&quot; and &quot;Over the Falls&quot;. In 1998, the band headlined the inaugural Sno-Core tour with the Aquabats, Long Beach Dub Allstars and Blink-182.

In late 1998, Primus released the &quot;Rhinoplasty&quot; EP, which has covers of acts like XTC, the Police and Peter Gabriel. The EP also includes two live recordings of Primus, as well as bonus content accessed through a CD-ROM portion of the CD. It was shortly followed by the video release &quot;Videoplasty&quot;.

&quot;Antipop&quot; was released in 1999, and featured production and guest appearances from James Hetfield of Metallica, Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, Matt Stone, one of the creators of &quot;South Park&quot;, Stewart Copeland of The Police, Jim Martin of Faith No More, and Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit. While producing the song &quot;Lacquer Head&quot;, Durst encouraged Primus to return to the more aggressive sound of their earlier albums for &quot;Antipop&quot;. Some critics compared the album&#x27;s murky downtuned guitars to nu metal, which was popular during the time. The band toured in support of &quot;Antipop&quot; at Ozzfest and on the Family Values Tour. The band released a music video for the album&#x27;s only single, &quot;Lacquer Head&quot;, which was banned from MTV because of references to and depictions of drug use, despite the song&#x27;s anti-drug message. Tensions among the band rose considerably during this period, Claypool stated &quot;there was some doubt at the label as to whether we knew what the hell we were doing anymore.&quot;

In 2000, Primus performed a cover of Black Sabbath″s song &quot;N.I.B.&quot; featuring vocals by Ozzy Osbourne. The track originally appeared on the album &quot;Nativity in Black II: A Tribute to Black Sabbath&quot;. The track was also released as part of Osbourne&#x27;s 2005 &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; box set.

The band went on hiatus from 2000 to 2003, with Claypool later stating: 
During this hiatus, Alexander released two albums with the band Laundry and performed with Blue Man Group, A Perfect Circle, and Born Naked, among others. Claypool explored the jam band scene with Oysterhead (featuring friend Trey Anastasio of Phish and Stewart Copeland of the Police) and his own Colonel Les Claypool&#x27;s Fearless Flying Frog Brigade (featuring both Huth and Lane). He also collaborated with Brain, Buckethead and Bernie Worrell in the group Colonel Claypool&#x27;s Bucket of Bernie Brains.

===Reunion of &quot;classic&quot; lineup (2003–2009)===

In late 2003, Primus reunited with Alexander on drums to record a five track EP. Released alongside a DVD containing the band&#x27;s music videos and clips from live performances, the resulting package was titled &quot;Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People&quot;. The band staged a two-month tour performing two sets per show, the second consisting of their 1991 release &quot;Sailing the Seas of Cheese&quot; in its entirety. 2004 saw them continue touring, this time performing their 1990 release &quot;Frizzle Fry&quot; in its entirety. For these two tours, the band sold recordings directly recorded from the sound-board online. The performance in Chicago was videotaped and released as a DVD titled &quot;Hallucino-Genetics: Live 2004&quot;. They also performed a set at Bonnarroo in 2004, a late night set featuring a cover of &quot;YYZ&quot; by Rush and a guest appearance by Adrian Belew on &quot;Thela Hun Ginjeet&quot; a King Crimson cover.

In 2005, the band performed at Lollapalooza and Vegoose. Between Primus shows, Claypool created a new solo project called Les Claypool&#x27;s Fancy Band which, like other projects, occasionally used Primus songs.

A May 10, 2006 article on IGN revealed that Primus had signed on with RedOctane to allow the master recording of &quot;John the Fisherman&quot; to be used in Guitar Hero II, a game for the PlayStation 2 and .

Primus performed on July 29, 2006, at the first annual Hedgpeth Festival in Twin Lakes, Wisconsin.

On October 17, 2006, Primus released both their first greatest hits CD &quot;They Can&#x27;t All Be Zingers&quot;, as well as their third DVD &quot;Blame It on the Fish: an Abstract Look at the 2003 Primus Tour de Fromage&quot;. Containing live footage from the band&#x27;s 2003 Tour de Fromage, interview segments and behind the scenes footage, the DVD includes a 70-minute feature film and 90 minutes of bonus material, including a 30-minute mockumentary about the band in the year 2065. &quot;Blame it on the Fish&quot; was directed by Matthew J. Powers. &quot;They Can&#x27;t All Be Zingers: The Best of Primus&quot; includes 16 digitally remastered songs that span the band&#x27;s career.

In November 2006, Primus commenced another tour which concluded the following month. They played at a few festivals in 2008, including the Rothbury Festival (in Michigan), the Ottawa Blues Fest, the Quebec City Summer Festival, and the Outside Lands Festival (in San Francisco). On November 24, 2009, Prawn Song re-released the band&#x27;s first studio album, &quot;Frizzle Fry&quot;, on vinyl record, along with some of Claypool&#x27;s solo albums.

===Tim Alexander departs again and &quot;Green Naugahyde&quot; (2010–2013)===
By early 2010, Tim &quot;Herb&quot; Alexander had left Primus for the second time. It was later revealed that Alexander lacked interest in continuing the band, despite enthusiasm from LaLonde and Claypool. Claypool hinted that they could have recorded with Alexander, but that &quot;when we did readdress Primus in &#x27;03 and &#x27;06, it was more of a nostalgic thing. It was great at the time, but it just didn&#x27;t have that creative spark as far as moving forward&quot;, and thus the reformation instead focused on touring.

On March 18, 2010, it was announced by Phil Lesh on his official message board that former Primus drummer Lane would be leaving his previous band Furthur to rejoin Primus. On May 3, 2010, Primus announced a new tour with Gogol Bordello, Wolfmother, and the Dead Kenny G&#x27;s. The press release for the tour revealed that the band were looking to &quot;refine their chops before heading into the studio to record their first album of brand new music since 1999&#x27;s &quot;Antipop&quot;.&quot; Correlating with this announcement, the Primus website was updated with an animation of an elevator with its twelfth floor featuring a stylized question mark, and a sign reading &quot;Primus will be with you shortly&quot;, alluding to future plans. In 2011, Claypool elaborated on the band&#x27;s decision to record an album, stating that &quot;(Lane) coming back has just breathed life back into the project. We did some touring, and we decided, &quot;Let&#x27;s go make a record,&quot; because we were creating things on the road.&quot;
On August 5, 2010, Primus released &quot;June 2010 Rehearsal&quot;, a free four-track rehearsal EP available for download on their official website. The EP consists of new recordings of previously released Primus songs featuring Lane on drums.

Primus began their second annual Oddity Faire tour on September 14, 2010, with opening acts Portugal. The Man, Split Lip Rayfield, Mariachi El Bronx, the New Orleans Bingo! Show, Mucca Pazza and Gogol Bordello. The Squidling Brothers Circus Sideshow performers also entertained the crowd between bands on select dates. To promote this tour, Primus appeared on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; in September. The Oddity Faire tour did not include dates in Primus&#x27;s hometown, the San Francisco Bay Area, because for promotional purposes it was too near to the planned New Year&#x27;s dates December 30 and 31 in Oakland.

Their song &quot;Jerry Was a Race Car Driver&quot; is included in the video game &quot;Rock Band 3&quot;, which was released on October 26, 2010.

In interviews conducted backstage at the Soundwave Festival in March 2011, Claypool said of the new Primus album &quot;we&#x27;ve recorded it, we just need to polish it&quot;, and that the release date &quot;should be around May or so&quot;. He also described the new material as being &quot;very reminiscent of &quot;Frizzle Fry&quot;&quot;. In May, it was revealed that the album was complete and had been named &quot;Green Naugahyde&quot;, though the release date was pushed back to July to avoid the holidays. On June 6, a press release was issued announcing that the album would be released by ATO Records and Prawn Song on September 13, 2011. A second press release was later issued announcing that the album would be released in Europe on September 12. On August 17, the track &quot;Tragedy&#x27;s a&#x27; Comin&#x27;&quot; was made available to stream via the &quot;Spin&quot; magazine website, followed by &quot;HOINFODAMAN&quot; on September 1 via the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; site. On September 8, the TV show &quot;South Park&quot; made the entire album available for streaming to anybody who &quot;likes&quot; their Facebook page, including &quot;Those Damned Blue-Collar Tweekers&quot; as a bonus track.

Primus continued to tour throughout 2011, playing a number of dates in North America in May and June, including the Bonnaroo Music Festival, followed by a tour of Europe from late June to mid July. They then returned to the U.S.A. to play a few more music festivals leading into early August, including a show at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Denver, Colorado with the Flaming Lips, before embarking on a &quot;major fall tour&quot; in support of the new album.

In the fall of 2012, the band went on tour with the &quot;first ever&quot; 3D-enhanced live musical performance. Each show featured Quad Surround Sound and 3D visuals.

During March 2013, the band played for the very first time in Mexico City.

===Classic lineup reunites again, &quot;The Chocolate Factory&quot; and &quot;The Desaturating Seven&quot; (2013–2019)===
In September 2013, Claypool revealed that Lane had departed Primus to focus on RatDog with Bob Weir. Previous drummer Alexander rejoined the band in his place. Claypool also revealed that the band were &quot;talking about going into the studio in November. But it&#x27;s all a little premature – we&#x27;ll see what happens&quot;. In December, Alexander revealed that the band had been &quot;in Les&#x27;s studio working on stuff for the new year&#x27;s show but I don&#x27;t know if there are any plans for releasing that.&quot; When asked about performing new material during the 2014 Australia tour, he said &quot;looking at [the band&#x27;s touring schedule], it doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s going to be any time to write anything new.&quot;

The first official Primus show with Alexander back on drums was New Year&#x27;s Eve 2013 at the Fox Theater in Oakland. The band performed their first set in front of the iconic &quot;Suck On This&quot; backdrop seen in the &quot;Too Many Puppies&quot; music video. For their second set, Primus were joined by &quot;the Frog Brigade Ensemble&quot;, consisting of saxophonist Skerik and percussionist Mike Dillon, as they performed the soundtrack from the 1971 film &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; in its entirety. The band later announced that a studio recording of the soundtrack, titled &quot;Primus &amp; the Chocolate Factory with the Fungi Ensemble&quot;, would be released on October 21, 2014.

On September 16, 2014, a biography of the band was released via Akashic Books titled &quot;Primus, Over the Electric Grapevine: Insight into Primus and the World of Les Claypool&quot;, written by music journalist and author Greg Prato in affiliation with Primus. The book chronicles the band&#x27;s career alongside Claypool&#x27;s other projects and features interviews with band members past and present, as well as Geddy Lee, Tom Waits, Tom Morello, Kirk Hammett, Stewart Copeland, Trey Anastasio, and Matt Stone, among others.

In late October 2015, the band released the first music video from their &quot;Primus &amp; the Chocolate Factory with the Fungi Ensemble&quot; album, for the track &quot;Candyman&quot;.

In mid-October 2016, the band performed at the fifth annual Desert Daze music festival in Joshua Tree, California.

On July 31, 2017, Primus announced their ninth studio album &quot;The Desaturating Seven&quot; and a US tour. On that same day, the album&#x27;s first single &quot;The Seven&quot; was also released. The album is inspired by the children&#x27;s book &quot;The Rainbow Goblins&quot;, written by Italian author Ul de Rico, which lead singer and bassist Claypool used to read to his children. It was released on September 29, 2017. During their co-headlining tour with Mastodon in 2018, the band played the album in its entirety. Primus – alongside Ministry and Philip H. Anselmo &amp; The Illegals – also opened for Slayer on the final North American leg of their farewell tour in November 2019.

===&quot;A Tribute to Kings&quot; Tour and &quot;Conspiranoid&quot; (2020–2024)===
At the beginning of 2020, the band announced that they would be doing a tour in which every night they would cover Rush&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; in its entirety. The tour was postponed twice. Once due to the fact that Primus joined Slayer on their retirement tour and again due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In November 2020, they announced a livestream entitled &quot;Alive From Pachyderm Station&quot; that would air on December 11 at Primuslive.com if audience bought a ticket. The concert was filmed at Claypool&#x27;s winery, &quot;Claypool Cellars&quot;. The event marked the first time in 20 years that songs from &quot;Antipop&quot; were performed live, including the first official performance of the song (other than being played at soundcheck in Milwaukee in 1999) &quot;Eclectic Electric&quot;. The &quot;Tribute to Kings&quot; tour commenced in August 2021 and originally wrapped up in October, followed by an encore extension beginning April 2022.

In an August 2021 interview with &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot;, Claypool confirmed that a new Primus album was in the works: &quot;Some ideas are being thrown around, but we&#x27;re not there yet. We will have a new album at some point. We&#x27;re focusing on this tour and &quot;Farewell to Kings&quot;. That&#x27;s enough for us for now.&quot; In March 2022, Claypool revealed that the band was planning to release a new twelve-inch single featuring a 13-minute track called &quot;Conspiranoia&quot; and two songs as its b-sides. The &quot;Conspiranoid&quot; EP was released on April 22, 2022. In May 2023, Claypool stated that there had been talk of another Primus album, but added that &quot;it [wouldn&#x27;t] be anytime soon&quot; because of his commitments to various projects.

On August 9 and 10, 2022, Primus played the &quot;South Park&quot; 25th Anniversary Concert alongside Ween and &quot;South Park&quot; creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. It was broadcast on Comedy Central on August 13 and on Paramount+ on August 14.

Primus contributed to the song &quot;Pablo&#x27;s Hippos&quot; on &quot;Sessanta E.P.P.P.&quot;, a split EP with Puscifer and A Perfect Circle, released in March 2024 to coincide with the Sessanta tour featuring all three of the aforementioned bands. On a tour stop at the Sick New World festival, the band&#x27;s gear got delayed due to a snow storm; rather than cancelling the show, Claypool and Lalonde simply went to a local Guitar Center and bought a pair of matching Fender guitar and bass, and performed the show with that; Claypool&#x27;s bass still had the label hanging off the headstock during the show. They would later announce they would auction off the two instruments to the benefit to St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital.

===Alexander&#x27;s third departure and the arrival of John Hoffman (2024–present)===
On October 17, 2024, Alexander unexpectedly announced to his bandmates that he would be leaving the band, effective immediately. Alexander stated that he had &quot;lost his passion for playing&quot;, with no further elaboration. Primus officially confirmed his departure on October 29, 2024, and announced that they were planning to search for &quot;the greatest drummer on Earth&quot;, with further details to follow. Alexander would later explain in an interview with Metal Injection in November that health concerns also had an effect on the decision to leave the band. At least 6,200 drummers were auditioned before Claypool announced Dirtfoot drummer John Hoffman as Alexander&#x27;s replacement on February 7, 2025.

Primus played its first show since Alexander&#x27;s third departure at the Fox Oakland Theatre on December 30, 2024, where three different sets were performed, including songs from Claypool&#x27;s 1996 solo debut album &quot;Highball with the Devil&quot; as &quot;The Holy Mackerel&quot;, a semi-reunion of the Frog Brigade (with LaLonde on guitar), and Primus performing with drummer Brain for the first time in 24 years.

Hoffman&#x27;s first tour with Primus will be the Sessanta V2.0 Tour with A Perfect Circle and Puscifer, which will take place from April to June 2025. This new lineup also plans to record new music.

==Musical style and influences==

Primus emerged from a metal background, with Les Claypool and Larry LaLonde previously having been part of the 1980s Californian thrash metal underground. Kirk Hammett, guitarist of Bay Area band Metallica, remarked in a 1991 interview that Primus are &quot;unique, they&#x27;re a square peg in a round hole&quot;. The music of Primus has been described as &quot;thrash-funk meets Don Knotts, Jr.&quot; and &quot;&quot;the Freak Brothers&quot; set to music&quot;. The &quot;Daily Freeman&quot; described the band&#x27;s style as &quot;a blend of funk metal and experimental rock&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; described the band&#x27;s music as &quot;absurdist funk-rock&quot;. Primus have also been described as &quot;prog rock&quot; or &quot;prog metal&quot;. &quot;AllMusic&quot; places Primus within the first wave of alternative metal bands, saying that they fused heavy metal music with progressive rock. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; classified the band&#x27;s performance as &quot;prog-rock self-indulgence&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine suggests that Primus is &quot;a post-punk Rush spiked with the sensibility and humor of Frank Zappa&quot;. &quot;Guitar Player&quot; said that Primus &quot;plays rock the way Dr. Seuss intended. In their crazy backwards world, progressive metal beds down with art-funk, instrumental flash tangos cheek-to-cheek with self-mocking humor&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; have labelled Primus as &quot;pranksters&quot; and, in 1995, as an &quot;unlikely gold-selling white trash purveyor of hard-ass pinballing funk metal&quot;.

Regarding the band&#x27;s genre, Claypool stated in 1991, &quot;We&#x27;ve been lumped in with the funk metal thing just about everywhere. I guess people just have to categorize you&quot;. Claypool dislikes the term &quot;thrash-funk&quot;, while admitting that &quot;it&#x27;s more accurate than calling us a funk band, since I&#x27;m the only one in the group with any sort of funk background&quot;. Claypool himself once classified Primus&#x27;s music as &quot;psychedelic polka.&quot; Primus is the only band with its own ID3 genre tag, &#x27;Primus&#x27;, as introduced by Winamp. Primus&#x27;s primary influence is the Residents, an avant-garde band that are well known for their anonymity and surreal music. Claypool has said he is often accused of being a member of the Residents due to their similar musical style. Other influences include King Crimson, Rush, Pink Floyd and Hillel Slovak-era Red Hot Chili Peppers.

Despite the seemingly upbeat, quirky music, Primus lyrics have often dealt with darker subject matter such as murder (&quot;My Name is Mud&quot;), accidental death (&quot;John The Fisherman&quot;, &quot;Jerry Was A Race Car Driver&quot;), drug addiction (&quot;Jilly&#x27;s on Smack&quot;, &quot;Lacquer Head&quot;) and suicide (&quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Coattails of a Dead Man&quot;), along with seemingly mundane observational comedy (&quot;DMV&quot;). Claypool himself has said, &quot;The thing is, a lot of these songs, with Primus, there’s an amazing amount of tragic tales, but it’s under the guise of this lighthearted perspective, and the music a lot of the times is lighthearted.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Primus have been credited as an influence to the nu metal genre, being cited as an influence by such bands as Limp Bizkit, Deftones, Incubus, and Korn. Limp Bizkit&#x27;s frontman Fred Durst, who produced a song on the Primus album &quot;Antipop&quot;, stated in 1999 &quot;I fucking love Primus. Spawned by pure rhythms, Primus has and always will be the most innovative and original source of groove to influence me in this decade. If you listen you will learn.&quot;

<doc id="147388" wikidata="Q2558541" url="?curid=147388" title="Governor-General of the Irish Free State">
<text>The governor-general of the Irish Free State () was the official representative of the sovereign of the Irish Free State from 1922 to 1936. By convention, the office was largely ceremonial. Nonetheless, it was controversial, as many Irish Nationalists regarded the existence of the office as offensive to republican principles and a symbol of continued British involvement in Irish affairs, despite the Governor-General having no connection to the British Government after 1931. For this reason, the office&#x27;s role was diminished over time by the Irish Government.

The 1931 enactment in London of the Statute of Westminster gave the Irish Free State full legislative independence. However, the Irish considered that full legislative independence had been achieved in 1922. The role of governor-general in the Irish Free State was removed from the Constitution on 11 December 1936, at the time of Edward VIII&#x27;s abdication as king of the United Kingdom and all the Dominions.

==Governors-general of the Irish Free State (1922–36)==
==Selection==
The governor-general was appointed by the King on the advice of his Irish ministers. Initially, the British government had some involvement in the appointment process. However, this ended following the 1926 Imperial Conference; thenceforth, only the government of the Irish Free State was formally involved. A further effect of the 1926 conference (in particular, of the Balfour Declaration) was that the monarch also ceased to receive formal advice from the British government in relation to his role in the Irish Free State; such advice thenceforth came officially only from the Executive Council of the Irish Free State (the Cabinet).

The Free State constitution did not limit the governor-general to a fixed term of office. But, in 1927, the Irish government decided that no governor-general would serve a term longer than five years.

==Role==
Under the constitution of the Irish Free State, the governor-general was bound to act in accordance with the &quot;law, practice and constitutional usage&quot;. His formal duties included the following:

* Executive authority: The executive authority of the state was formally &#x27;vested&#x27; in the king, but exercised by the governor-general. The governor-general appointed the Executive Council to &quot;aid and advise&quot; him, but with few exceptions was bound to act on the Executive Council&#x27;s advice. 
* Appointment of the Cabinet: The President of the Executive Council (prime minister) was appointed by the governor-general after being selected by Dáil Éireann (the lower house of parliament). The remaining ministers were appointed on the nomination of the president, subject to a vote of consent in the Dáil.
* Convention and dissolution of the legislature: The governor-general, on behalf of the king, convened and dissolved the on the advice of the Executive Council.
* Signing bills into law: The king was formally, along with the Dáil and the Seanad, one of three components of the Oireachtas. No bill could become law until it received Royal Assent, given by the governor-general on behalf of the king. The governor-general theoretically had the right to veto a bill or reserve it &quot;for the signification of the King&#x27;s pleasure&quot;, in effect postponing a decision on whether or not to enact the bill, for a maximum of one year. When it was suggested in the House of Lords that the Land Bill 1926 be vetoed in this way, the Lord Chancellor said, &quot;It would not be effective, for if this Bill were vetoed a similar Bill could be passed to-morrow&quot;.
* Appointment of judges: All judges were appointed by the governor-general on the advice of the Executive Council.

Until 1928, the governor-general served an additional role as the British government&#x27;s agent in the Free State. This meant that all official correspondence between the British and Irish governments went through the governor-general and that he had access to British government papers. It also meant that he could receive secret instructions from the British government. For example, Tim Healy was formally advised by the British government to veto any attempt to abolish the controversial Oath of Allegiance to the Crown, sworn by Irish parliamentarians. 

However, at the same imperial conference from which the change in the mode of the governor-general&#x27;s appointment arose, it was agreed that thenceforth the governors-general of dominions such as the Free State would lose the second half of their dual role and no longer be representatives of the British government, with this role being carried out instead by high commissioners. Furthermore, because, under the changes agreed, the British government lost the right to advise the king in relation to the Irish Free State, it could no longer issue binding instructions to the Irish governor-general.

The first two governors-general lived at the Viceregal Lodge (now known as , the official residence of the president of Ireland). The last governor-general resided in a specially leased private residence in Booterstown, County Dublin. The governor-general was officially referred to as His Excellency. However, unlike all the other governors-general within the British Empire in the 1920s and 1930s, none of the governors-general of the Irish Free State were ever sworn in as members of the Imperial Privy Council. Uniquely among all the governors-general in the British Empire at that time, none of the governors-general of the Irish Free State ever publicly wore the official ceremonial uniform for someone of their rank.

==History==
===Origins===
The Irish Free State was officially established on 6 December 1922, under the terms of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty. While Irish political leaders favoured the creation of a republic, &#x27;the Treaty&#x27; required, instead, that the new state would be a Dominion within the British Empire under a form of constitutional monarchy. Central to the agreed system of government was to be a &quot;representative of the Crown&quot;. The new office was not named in the treaty, but the committee charged with drawing up the Free State constitution, under General Michael Collins, decided, after considering a number of names, including &quot;Commissioner of the British Commonwealth&quot; and &quot;President of Ireland&quot;, that the representative would bear the title of &quot;Governor-General&quot;, the same as that used by the Crown&#x27;s representative in other Dominions, i.e. Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. However, the Irish language title was &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;high steward&quot;, which was later used in English.

As put regarding what the Anglo-Irish Treaty said first, and what the Constitution of the Irish Free State said thereafter, 

The Crown&#x27;s representative was expressly bound by the same constitutional conventions as the governor general of Canada, which would limit him to a largely ceremonial role. It was hoped that, if he was given the same title as that used in other dominions, then, if the British government attempted to violate convention by using the office of governor-general to interfere in the Free State&#x27;s affairs, these other nations would see their own autonomy threatened and might object.

===Cosgrave executive===
The first two governors-general of the Irish Free State assumed office under the pro-Treaty, Cumann na nGaedheal government of W. T. Cosgrave. When it came to choosing the first governor-general, there was speculation about a number of possible candidates, including the famed Irish painter Sir John Lavery and Edward, Prince of Wales. However, the Irish cabinet let it be known that it wished Tim Healy, a former Irish Parliamentary Party MP, to be appointed, and the British government ultimately agreed.

When it came to selecting Healy&#x27;s successor, the Irish cabinet chose James McNeill, an Ulsterman, from one of the six out of nine Ulster counties which had remained in the Union with Britain, who was a former member of Collins&#x27;s constitution committee and a former chairman of Dublin County Council. Because, unlike his predecessor, he was not the United Kingdom&#x27;s official representative in the Free State, but merely the personal representative of the king, McNeill found himself with less influence than Healy had possessed.

===De Valera executive===
After the 1932 general election, the Cosgrave government left office and was succeeded by the anti-treaty Fianna Fáil party of Éamon de Valera, who now became President of the Executive Council. Fianna Fáil&#x27;s immediate goal was to republicanise the Irish Free State and, as such, it opposed the very existence of the governorship-general. With this in mind, de Valera&#x27;s cabinet decided to boycott and humiliate McNeill at every turn. This policy was followed, for example, during the 1932 Eucharistic Congress, when McNeill was sidelined and, on one occasion, the army&#x27;s band was withdrawn from a function that he attended. On another occasion, two ministers publicly stormed out of a diplomatic function in Dublin when McNeill arrived as the guest of the French government. In late 1932, de Valera and McNeill clashed when the Governor-General published his private correspondence with de Valera and de Valera sought McNeill&#x27;s dismissal. King George V, however, acting as peacemaker, persuaded de Valera to withdraw the request on the basis that McNeill was due to finish his term of office within a few weeks. He then persuaded McNeill to bring forward his retirement to 1 November 1932.

On McNeill&#x27;s retirement, de Valera advised the king to appoint the aged Domhnall Ua Buachalla, a former Fianna Fáil TD, to the post. The new governor-general (who almost always styled himself as ) was formally advised by the cabinet to withdraw from public life and confine himself to formal functions such as giving royal assent, issuing proclamations, dissolving Dáil Éireann, and appointing, on de Valera&#x27;s advice, ministers to the executive council. In 1933, constitutional amendments were passed removing the governor-general&#x27;s role in recommending the appropriation of money and the power to veto legislation.

===Abolition===
In December 1936, when King Edward VIII abdicated from all his thrones, including that of the Irish Free State (as created in the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 and Statute of Westminster 1931), the Irish cabinet decided to finally abolish the governorship-general. Taoiseach John A. Costello, speaking in 1948, described the Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936, which effected the change, as follows:
However, de Valera was later advised by the attorney general and senior advisors that the amendment was not sufficient to abolish the office entirely, which still continued by virtue of Letters Patent, Orders in Council, and statute law. Though officially insisting that the office had been abolished (de Valera instructed Ua Buachalla to act as though he had left office and to leave his official residence), de Valera introduced a second law, the Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act 1937, to retrospectively eliminate the post from Irish law. Under its own terms, the act applied retroactively, so that the office would be deemed to have been fully abolished on 11 December 1936.

Ua Buachalla and de Valera, although once close friends, fell out over Ua Buachalla&#x27;s treatment in the abolition of the viceregal post, with Ua Buachalla initiating legal proceedings to sue de Valera. However, their relationship was eventually healed and, when de Valera later became President of Ireland, he appointed Ua Buachalla to the Council of State in 1959. Ua Buachalla was the last surviving governor-general, dying aged 97 on 30 October 1963.
