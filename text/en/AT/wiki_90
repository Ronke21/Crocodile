<text>Islamic banking, Islamic finance ( &quot;masrifiyya &#x27;islamia&quot;), or Sharia-compliant finance is banking or financing activity that complies with Sharia (Islamic law) and its practical application through the development of Islamic economics. Some of the modes of Islamic finance include &quot;mudarabah&quot; (profit-sharing and loss-bearing), &quot;wadiah&quot; (safekeeping), &quot;musharaka&quot; (joint venture), &quot;murabahah&quot; (cost-plus), and &quot;ijarah&quot; (leasing).

Sharia prohibits &quot;riba&quot;, or usury, generally defined as interest paid on all loans of money (although some Muslims dispute whether there is a consensus that interest is equivalent to &quot;riba&quot;). Investment in businesses that provide goods or services considered contrary to Islamic principles (e.g. pork or alcohol) is also &quot;haram&quot; (&quot;sinful and prohibited&quot;).

These prohibitions have been applied historically in varying degrees in Muslim countries/communities to prevent un-Islamic practices. In the late 20th century, as part of the revival of Islamic identity, a number of Islamic banks formed to apply these principles to private or semi-private commercial institutions within the Muslim community. Their number and size has grown, so that by 2009, there were over 300 banks and 250 mutual funds around the world complying with Islamic principles, and around $2 trillion was Sharia-compliant by 2014. Sharia-compliant financial institutions represented approximately 1% of total world assets, concentrated in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Iran, and Malaysia. Although Islamic banking still makes up only a fraction of the banking assets of Muslims, since its inception it has been growing faster than banking assets as a whole, and is projected to continue to do so.

The industry has been lauded for returning to the path of &quot;divine guidance&quot; in rejecting the &quot;political and economic dominance&quot; of the West, and noted as the &quot;most visible mark&quot; of Islamic revivalism; its most enthusiastic advocates promise &quot;no inflation, no unemployment, no exploitation and no poverty&quot; once it is fully implemented. However, it has also been criticized for failing to develop profit and loss sharing or more ethical modes of investment promised by early promoters, and instead merely selling banking products that &quot;comply with the formal requirements of Islamic law&quot;, but use &quot;ruses and subterfuges to conceal interest&quot;, and entail &quot;higher costs, bigger risks&quot; than conventional (&quot;ribawi&quot;) banks.

==History==

===Usury in Islam===

Although Islamic finance contains many prohibitions—such as on consumption of alcohol, gambling, uncertainty, etc. – the belief that &quot;all forms of interest are &quot;riba&quot; and hence prohibited&quot; is the idea upon which it is based.
The word &quot;riba&quot; literally means &quot;excess or addition&quot;, and has been translated as &quot;interest&quot;, &quot;usury&quot;, &quot;excess&quot;, &quot;increase&quot; or &quot;addition&quot;.

According to Islamic economists Choudhury and Malik, the elimination of interest followed a &quot;gradual process&quot; in early Islam, &quot;culminating&quot; with a &quot;fully fledged Islamic economic system&quot; under Caliph Umar (634–644 CE).

Other sources (&quot;Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World&quot;, Timur Kuran), do not agree, and state that the giving and taking of interest continued in Muslim society &quot;at times through the use of legal ruses (&quot;ḥiyal&quot;), often more or less openly,&quot; including during the Ottoman Empire.
Still another source (International Business Publications) states that during the &quot;Islamic Golden Age&quot; the &quot;common view of &quot;riba&quot; among classical jurists&quot; of Islamic law and economics was that it was unlawful to apply interest to gold and silver currencies, &quot;but that it is not &quot;riba&quot; and is therefore acceptable to apply interest to fiat money – currencies made up of other materials such as paper or base metals – to an extent.&quot;

In the late 19th century Islamic Modernists reacted to the rise of European power and influence and its colonization of Muslim countries by reconsidering the prohibition on interest and whether interest rates and insurance were not among the &quot;preconditions for productive investment&quot; in a functioning modern economy. Syed Ahmad Khan, argued for a differentiation between sinful &quot;riba&quot; &quot;usury&quot;, which they saw as restricted to charges on lending for consumption, and legitimate non-&quot;riba&quot; &quot;interest&quot;, for lending for commercial investment.

However, in the 20th century, Islamic revivalists/Islamists/activists worked to define all interest as &quot;riba&quot;, to enjoin Muslims to lend and borrow at &quot;Islamic Banks&quot; that avoided fixed rates. By the 21st century this Islamic Banking movement had created &quot;institutions of interest-free financial enterprises across the world&quot;. Loans are permitted in Islam if the interest that is paid is linked to the profit or loss obtained by the investment. The concept of profit acts as a symbol in Islam as equal sharing of profits, losses, and risks.

The movement started with activists and scholars such as Anwar Qureshi, Naeem Siddiqui, Abul A&#x27;la Maududi, Muhammad Hamidullah, in the late 1940 and early 1950s. 
They believed commercial banks were a &quot;necessary evil,&quot; and proposed a banking system based on the concept of &quot;Mudarabah&quot;, where shared profit on investment would replace interest. Further works specifically devoted to the subject of interest-free banking were authored by Muhammad Uzair (1955), Abdullah al-Araby (1967), Mohammad Najatuallah Siddiqui, al-Najjar (1971) and Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr.

====Since 1970====
The involvement of institutions, governments, and various conferences and studies on Islamic banking (Conference of the Finance Ministers of the Islamic Countries held in Karachi in 1970, the Egyptian study in 1972, The First International Conference on Islamic Economics in Mecca in 1976, and the International Economic Conference in London in 1977) were instrumental in applying the application of theory to practice for the first interest-free banks. At the First International Conference on Islamic Economics, &quot;several hundred Muslim intellectuals, Sharia scholars and economists unequivocally declared ... that all forms of interest&quot; were &quot;riba&quot;.

By 2004, the strength of this belief (which is the basis of Islamic finance) was demonstrated in Pakistan—when a minority (non-Muslim) member of the Pakistani parliament questioned it, pointing out that a scholar from Al-Azhar University, (one of the oldest Islamic Universities in the world), had issued a decree that bank interest was not un-Islamic. His statement resulted in &quot;pandemonium&quot; in the parliament, a demand by members of leading Islamist political party to immediately respond to these allegedly derogatory remarks, followed by a walkout when they were denied it. When the upset members of parliament returned, their leader (Sahibzada Fazal Karim), stated that since the Pakistan Council of Islamic ideology had decreed that interest in all its forms was &quot;haram&quot; (forbidden) in an Islamic society, no member of parliament had the right to &quot;negate this settled issue&quot;.

The council&#x27;s decree notwithstanding, over the years a minority of Islamic scholars (Muhammad Abduh, Rashid Rida, Mahmud Shaltut, Syed Ahmad Khan, Fazl al-Rahman, Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy and Yusuf al-Qaradawi) have questioned whether &quot;riba&quot; includes all interest payments. Others (Muhammad Akran Khan) have questioned whether &quot;riba&quot; is a crime like murder and theft, forbidden by Sharia (Islamic law) and subject to punishment by human beings, or simply a sin to be inveighed against, with the reprimand left to God, since &quot;neither the Prophet nor the first four caliphs nor any subsequent Islamic government ever enacted any law against &quot;riba&quot;.&quot;

With an increase in the Muslim population in Europe and the current lack of supply, opportunities will arise for the important role which Islamic finance plays in Europe&#x27;s economy. In particular, Luxembourg is emerging as a leader and hub for Islamic funds.

===Banking===

While revivalists like Mohammed Naveed insist Islamic Banking is &quot;as old as the religion itself with its principles primarily derived from the Quran&quot;, secular historians and Islamic modernists see it as a modern phenomenon or &quot;invented tradition&quot;.

==== Early example: Zubayr ibn al-Awwam ====
It is argued that the fundraising business of Zubayr ibn al-Awwam was practically Banking with zero interests. Zubayr pioneered this practice by technically modifying the money-keeping service to be a loan which Zubayr was obligated to pay off, while he also got privilege to manage the money he kept to do his business. The practice of Zubayr to accept deposits from peoples while not charging any interest meant Zubayr died with an inflated debt of 2,000,000 Dinar However, al-Zubayr invested the deposit moneys of the clients for his own lucrative businesses, so his inheritors managed to settle his debts, while still leaving many heritage for his family. After his death, his son Abdullah ibn Zubayr sold the property for 1.600.000 dinar. This practice was allowed according to classical scholar consensus, such as Ibn Taymiyyah in his Majmu Fatawa.

====Early banking====
According to Timur Kuran, by &quot;the tenth century, Islamic law supported credit and investment instruments&quot; that were &quot;as advanced&quot; as anything in the non-Islamic world, but prior to the 19th century there were no &quot;durable&quot; financial institutions &quot;recognizable as banks&quot; in the Muslim world. The first Muslim majority-owned banks did not emerge until the 1920s.
An early market economy and an early form of mercantilism, sometimes called &quot;Islamic capitalism&quot;, was developed between the eighth and twelfth centuries. The monetary economy of the period was based on the widely circulated currency the gold dinar, and it tied together regions that were previously economically independent.

A number of economic concepts and techniques were applied in early Islamic banking, including bills of exchange, partnership (&quot;mufawada&quot;, including limited partnerships, or &quot;mudaraba&quot;), and forms of capital (&quot;al-mal&quot;), capital accumulation (&quot;nama al-mal&quot;), cheques, promissory notes, trusts (see &quot;Waqf&quot;), transactional accounts, loaning, ledgers and assignments. Muslim traders are known to have used the cheque or &quot;ṣakk&quot; system since the time of Harun al-Rashid (9th century) of the Abbasid Caliphate. Organizational enterprises independent from the state also existed in the medieval Islamic world, while the agency institution was also introduced during that time. Many of these early capitalist concepts were adopted and further advanced in medieval Europe from the 13th century onwards.

====20th century====
In the middle of the 20th century, some organizational entities were found to offer financial services complying with Islamic laws. The first, experimental, local Islamic bank was established in the late 1950s in a rural area of Pakistan which charged no interest on its lending.

In 1963, the first modern Islamic bank on record was established in rural Egypt by economist Ahmad Elnaggar to appeal to people who lacked confidence in state-run banks. The profit-sharing experiment, in the Nile Delta town of Mit Ghamr, did not specifically advertise its Islamic nature for fear of being seen as a manifestation of Islamic fundamentalism that was anathema to the Gamal Nasser regime. Also in that year the Pilgrims Saving Corporation was founded in Malaysia (although not a bank, it incorporated basic Islamic banking concepts).

The Mit Ghamr experiment was shut down by the Egyptian government in 1968. Nonetheless, it was considered a success by many, as by that time there were nine similar banks in the country. In 1972, the Mit Ghamr Savings project became part of Nasr Social Bank, which as of 2016 was still in business in Egypt.

====Since 1970====

The influx of &quot;petro-dollars&quot; and a &quot;general re-Islamisation&quot; following the Yom Kippur War and 1973 oil crisis encouraged the development of the Islamic banking sector, and since 1975 it has spread globally.

In 1975, the Islamic Development Bank was set up with the mission to provide funding to projects in the member countries. The first modern commercial Islamic bank, Dubai Islamic Bank, was established in 1979. The first Islamic insurance (or &quot;takaful&quot;) company – the Islamic Insurance Company of Sudan – was established in 1979. The Amana Income Fund, the world&#x27;s first Islamic mutual fund (which invests only in Sharia-compliant equities), was created in 1986 in Indiana.
From 1980 to 1985, Islamic investments underwent a &quot;spectacular expansion&quot; throughout the Muslim world, attracting deposits with the promise of &quot;great gains&quot; and &quot;religious guarantees&quot; supplied by Islamic jurists who were &quot;recruited to issue fatwas denouncing conventional banks and recommending their Islamic rivals.&quot; This growth was temporarily reversed in 1988 in the largest Arab Muslim country, Egypt, when the Egyptian state – worried that Islamist movements were building up a &quot;war chest&quot; and being given financial independence – reversed its tacit support for the industry, and launched a media campaign against Islamic banks. The ensuing financial panic led to the bankruptcy of some companies.

In 1990 an accounting organization for Islamic financial institutions (Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions, AAOIFI), was established in Algiers by a group of Islamic financial institutions. Also in that year the Islamic bond market emerged when the first tradable &quot;sukuk&quot; – the Islamic alternative to conventional bonds – were issued by Shell MDS in Malaysia. In 2002, the Malaysia-based Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) was established as an international standard-setting body for Islamic financial institutions.

By 1995, 144 Islamic financial institutions had been established worldwide, including 33 government-run banks, 40 private banks, and 71 investment companies. The large US-based Citibank began to offer Islamic banking services in 1996 when it established the Citi Islamic Investment Bank in Bahrain. The first successful benchmark for the performance of Islamic investment funds was established in 1999, with the Dow Jones Islamic Market Index (DJIMI).
Also in the 1990s, a false start was made in Islamic banking in the UK, where bankers declared returns &quot;interest&quot; for tax purposes, while insisting to depositors they were actually &quot;profit&quot; and so not &quot;riba&quot;. Islamic scholars issued a fatwa stating they had &quot;no objection to the use of the term &#x27;interest&#x27;&quot; in loan contracts for purposes of tax avoidance provided the transaction did not actually involve &quot;riba&quot;, and the Islamic bankers used the term for fear that lack of tax deductions available for interest (but not profit) would put them at a competitive disadvantage to conventional banks. Muslim customers were not persuaded, and a &quot;bad taste&quot; was left &quot;in the mouth&quot; of the market for Islamic financial products. The Islamic Bank of Britain, the first Islamic commercial bank established outside the Muslim world, was not established until 2004.

By 2008 Islamic banking was growing at a rate of 10–15% per year and continued growth was forecast. There were over 300 Islamic financial institutions spread over 51 countries, as well as an additional 250 mutual funds complying with Islamic principles. Worldwide, approximately 0.5% of financial assets were estimated to be under Sharia-compliant management according to &quot;The Economist&quot; magazine.

But as the industry grew it also drew criticism (from M.T. Usmani among others) for not progressing from &quot;debt-based contracts&quot;, such as &quot;murabaha&quot;, to the more &quot;genuine&quot; profit and loss sharing mode, but instead moving in the opposite direction, &quot;competing to present themselves with all of the same characteristics of the conventional, interest-based marketplace&quot;.

During the 2007–2008 financial crisis, Islamic banks were not initially impacted by the &#x27;toxic assets&#x27; built up on the balance sheets of US banks as these were not Sharia-compliant and not owned by Islamic banks. In 2009, the official newspaper of the Vatican (&quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot;) put forward the idea that &quot;the ethical principles on which Islamic finance is based may bring banks closer to their clients and to the true spirit which should mark every financial service&quot;. (The Catholic Church forbids usury but began to relax its ban on all interest in the 16th century.) 
However, the drop in valuation of real estate and private equity – two segments heavily invested by Islamic firms – following the collapse of Lehman Brothers Islamic did hurt Islamic financial institutions.

As of 2015, $2.004 trillion in assets were being managed in a Sharia-compliant manner according to the State of the Global Islamic Economy Report. Of these $342 billion were &quot;sukuk&quot;. The market for Islamic &quot;Sukuk&quot; bonds in that year was made up of 2,354 sukuk issues, and had become strong enough that several non-Muslim majority states – UK, Hong Kong, and Luxemburg – issued &quot;sukuk.&quot;

There are multiple Shari&#x27;ah-compliant indexes, created by Shari&#x27;ah screening of companies. Such indexes include DJIM, S&amp;PSI, MSCI and country-based indexes like KMI-Pakistan and SCM-Malaysia.

==Principles==
To be consistent with the principles of Islamic law (Sharia)—or at least an orthodox interpretation of the law—and guided by Islamic economics, the contemporary movement of Islamic banking and finance prohibits a variety of activities, some not illegal in secular states:

* Paying or charging interest. &quot;All forms of interest are &quot;riba&quot; and hence prohibited&quot;. Islamic rules on transactions (known as &quot;Fiqh al-Muamalat&quot;) have been created to prevent use of interest. 
* Investing in businesses involved in activities that are forbidden (&quot;haraam&quot;). These include things such as selling alcohol or pork, or producing media such as gossip columns or pornography.
* Charging extra for late payment. This applies to &quot;murâbaḥah&quot; or other fixed payment financing transactions, although some authors believe late fees may be charged if they are donated to charity, or if the buyer has &quot;deliberately refused&quot; to make a payment.
*&quot;Maisir.&quot; This is usually translated as &quot;gambling&quot; but used to mean &quot;speculation&quot; in Islamic finance. Involvement in contracts where the ownership of a good depends on the occurrence of a predetermined, uncertain event in the future is &quot;maisir&quot; and forbidden in Islamic finance.
*&quot;Gharar&quot;. Usually translated as &quot;uncertainty&quot; or &quot;ambiguity&quot;. Bans on both &quot;maisir&quot; and &quot;gharar&quot; tend to rule out derivatives, options and futures. Islamic finance supporters (such as Mervyn K. Lewis and Latifa M. Algaoud) believe these involve excessive risk and may foster uncertainty and fraudulent behaviour such as are found in derivative instruments used by conventional banking.
*Engaging in transactions lacking &quot;&#x27;material finality&#x27;. All transactions must be &quot;directly linked to a real underlying economic transaction&quot;, which excludes &quot;options and most other derivatives&quot;.

Money on the most common type of Islamic financing – debt-based contracts – &quot;must be made from a tangible asset that one owns and thus has the right to sell – and in financial transactions it demands that risk be shared.&quot; Money cannot be made from money. Another statement of the Islamic banking theory of finance is: &quot;Money has no intrinsic utility; it is only a medium of exchange.&quot;
Other restrictions include 
*Islamic banks are to collect &quot;zakat&quot; (obligatory religious alms giving) from customers&#x27; accounts – at least according to some sources.
* A board of Sharia experts is to supervise and advise each Islamic bank on the propriety of transactions to &quot;ensure that all activities are in line with Islamic principles&quot;. (Interpretations of Sharia may vary by country. According to Humayon Dar, interpretation of the Sharia is more strict in Turkey or Arab countries than in Malaysia, whose interpretation is in turn more strict than the Islamic Republic of Iran. Mohammed Ariff also found less exacting Sharia-compliance in Iran where the Islamic government had decreed &quot;that government borrowing on the basis of a fixed rate of return from the nationalized banking system would not amount to interest&quot; and consequently would be permissible.&quot; Mahmud el-Gamal found interpretations most strict in Sudan and least in Malaysia.)
* Risk sharing. symmetrical risk and return on distribution to participants so that no one benefits disproportionately from the transaction.

In general, Islamic banking and finance has been described as having the &quot;same purpose&quot; as conventional banking but operating in accordance with the rules of Sharia law (Institute of Islamic Banking and Insurance), or having the same &quot;basic objective&quot; as other private entities, i.e. &quot;maximization of shareholder wealth&quot; (Mohamed Warsame). In a similar vein, Mahmoud El-Gamal states that Islamic finance &quot;is not constructively built from classical jurisprudence&quot;. It follows conventional banking and deviates from it &quot;only insofar as some conventional practices are deemed forbidden under Sharia.&quot;

A broader description of its principles is given by the Islamic Research and Training Institute of the Islamic Development bank,

The most important feature of Islamic banking is that it promotes risk sharing between the provider of funds (investor) on the one hand and both the financial intermediary (the bank) and the user of funds (the entrepreneur) on the other hand ... In conventional banking, all this risk is borne in principle by the entrepreneur. 

Some proponents (Nizam Yaquby) believe Islamic banking has more far reaching purposes than conventional banking, and declare that the &quot;guiding principles&quot; for Islamic finance include: &quot;fairness, justice, equality, transparency, and the pursuit of social harmony&quot;, although others describe these virtues as the natural benefits of following Sharia. (Taqi Usmani describes the virtues as guiding principles in one section of his book on Islamic Banking, and benefits in another.)

Nizam Yaquby, for example declares that the &quot;guiding principles&quot; for Islamic finance include: &quot;fairness, justice, equality, transparency, and the pursuit of social harmony&quot;. Some distinguish between Sharia-&quot;compliant&quot; finance and a more holistic, pure and exacting Sharia-&quot;based&quot; finance. &quot;Ethical finance&quot; has been called necessary, or at least desirable, for Islamic finance, as has a &quot;gold-based currency&quot;. Taqi Usmani declares that Islamic banking would mean less lending because it paid no interest on loans. This should not be thought of as presenting a problem for borrowers finding funds, because – according to Usmani – it is in part to discourage excessive finance that Islam forbids interest. Zubair Hasan argues that the objectives of Islamic finance as envisaged by its pioneers were &quot;promotion of growth with equity ... the alleviation of poverty ... [and] a long run vision to improve the condition of the Muslim communities across the world.&quot;
Some (such as convert Umar Ibrahim Vadillo) believe the Islamic banking movement has so far failed to follow the principles of Sharia law, or at least failed to follow them sufficiently strictly.

On the other hand, Usmani preached that an Islamic economy free of the &quot;imbalances&quot; in society – such as concentration of &quot;wealth in the hands of the few&quot;, or monopolies which paralyze or hinder market forces – would &quot;follow&quot; from obeying &quot;divine injunctions&quot; by banning interest (along with other Islamic efforts). (Later in his book &quot;Introduction to Islamic Finance&quot;, he argues that Islamic principles should include &quot;the fulfillment of the needs of the society&quot; giving &quot;preference to the products which may help the common people to raise their standard of living&quot;, but that few Islamic banks have followed this path.) Another source (Saleh Abdullah Kamel), described the changes anticipated for the Muslim community by following Islamic approach to economics, banking, finance, etc., as a &quot;move towards economic development, creation of the value added factor, increased exports, less imports, job creation, rehabilitation of the incapacitated and training of capable elements&quot;.

===Scriptural basis===
The Sharia law that forms the basis of Islamic banking is itself based on the Quran (revealed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad) and &quot;ahadith&quot; (the body of reports of the teachings, deeds and sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad that often explain verses in the Quran).
Prohibition of &quot;gharar&quot; is based on &quot;ahadith&quot; declaring as forbidden &quot;gharar&quot; the sale of things like &quot;the birds in the sky or the fish in the water&quot;. &quot;Maisir&quot; is thought to be banned by verses 2:219, 5:90, and 91 in the Quran.

However, &quot;the Islamic evaluation&quot; of modern banking centers around the definition of interest on loans as &quot;riba.&quot; Twelve verses in the Qur&#x27;an deal with &quot;riba&quot;, the word appearing eight times in total, three times in verses , and once in , , , and . &quot;Riba&quot; is mentioned numerous times in &quot;ahadith&quot;, including Muhammad&#x27;s Farewell Sermon.

A number of orthodox scholars point to Quranic verses (2:275–2:280) as declaring &quot;riba&quot; &quot;categorically prohibited&quot; and &quot;unjust&quot; (&quot;zulm&quot;), and defining it to mean any payment &quot;over and above the principal&quot; of a loan. (Although at least one source states &quot;it is commonly argued&quot; that &quot;riba&quot; is &quot;defined by hadith&quot;.)

According to the orthodox, an &quot;increase over the principal sum&quot; in &quot;loans of cash&quot; are riba. An increase over the principal sum in &quot;financing a purchase&quot; of some product or commodity is another matter. These are &quot;not&quot; riba – according to the orthodox interpretation – at least in some circumstances. (These are sometimes known as &quot;credit sales&quot;.) According to noted Islamic scholar Taqi Usmani, this is because in Quran aya 2:275 (&quot;they say, &#x27;Trafficking (trade) is like usury,&#x27; [but] God has permitted trafficking, and forbidden usury&quot;) &quot;trafficking (trade)&quot; refers to credit sales such as &quot;murabaha&quot;, the &quot;forbidden usury&quot; refers to charging extra for late payment (late fees), and the &quot;they&quot; refers to non-Muslims who did not understand why if the first was allowed both were not. For this reason (according to Usmani) it is &quot;not&quot; true that &quot;whenever price is increased taking the time of payment into consideration, the transaction comes within the ambit of interest&quot;. Instead of &quot;principal&quot; and &quot;interest rate&quot;, the credit taker is paying &quot;cost&quot; and &quot;profit rate&quot;. (Another difference with conventional finance is that there is no penalty for late payment.)

===Interest and credit sales===
While Usmani and other Islamic Banking pioneers envisioned credit sales like &quot;murâbaḥah&quot; being a limited part of the Islamic Banking industry and subordinate to profit and loss sharing, it has become the &quot;most common&quot; mode of Islamic financing.

The distinction between credit sales and interest has also come under attack from critics such as Khalid Zaheer and Muhammad Akram Khan – criticizing it from opposite points of view. Zaheer considers profit from credit sales to be &quot;riba&quot;, the same as interest, and notes the lack of enthusiasm of orthodox scholars – such as the Council of Islamic Ideology – for credit sales-based Islamic Banking, which they (the council) call &quot;no more than a second best solution from the viewpoint of an ideal Islamic system&quot;.
Khan calls the distinction &quot;frivolous and laboured&quot;, a way of charging interest using another name, necessary because businesses &quot;cannot survive where cash and credit prices are equal&quot;.
Others note that in terms of standard accounting practice and truth-in-lending regulations getting 90 days credit on a Rs 10000 product and paying an extra Rs 500, cost very nearly the same and is considered very nearly the same as paying in cash, using a three-month loan at 20% per annum.

Taqi Usmani, however, explains that this is a &quot;misconception&quot;. 
Paying more for credit when buying a product (&quot;an exchange of commodities for money&quot;) does not violate Sharia law, but exchange of &quot;one unit of money for another of the same denomination&quot; (&quot;an exchange of money for money&quot;) and charging for credit &quot;is&quot; a violation of Sharia. The cash loan is different because &quot;money has no intrinsic utility&quot;.

Other orthodox supporters (such as Kahf) have defended the Sharia-compliance of the practice saying that among other things, attaching commodities to money in finance prevents money from being used for speculative purposes. Critics report widespread abuses of &quot;synthetic&quot; &quot;murabaha&quot;, which are loans with interest in all but name.

===Types of Islamic lending===

One of the pioneers of Islamic banking, Mohammad Najatuallah Siddiqui, suggested a two-tier &quot;mudarabah&quot; model as the basis of a &quot;riba&quot;-free banking. The bank would act as the capital partner in &quot;mudarabah&quot; accounts with the depositor on one side and the entrepreneur on the other side. (Another pioneer Taqi Uthmani called &quot;mudarabah&quot; and another profit-sharing form of finance &quot;musharakah&quot;, the &quot;real and ideal instruments of financing in Shari‘ah&quot;.) This model would be supplemented by a number of fixed-return models—mark-up (&quot;murabaha&quot;), leasing (&quot;ijara&quot;), cash advances for the purchase of agricultural produce (&quot;salam&quot;) and cash advances for the manufacture of assets (&quot;istisna&quot;&#x27;), etc. In practice, the fixed-return models, in particular &quot;murabaha&quot; model, became the industry staples, not supplements, as they bear results most similar to the interest-based finance models. Assets managed under these products far exceed those in &quot;profit-loss-sharing modes&quot; such as &quot;mudarabah&quot; and &quot;musharakah&quot;.

===Time value of money===
The time value of money – the idea that there is greater benefit in receiving money now rather than later, so that savers/investors/lenders should be compensated for delayed gratification – has been called one of the &quot;most significant&quot; arguments in favor of charging interest on loans. As such, some Islamic finance supporters have opposed the concept, arguing that some consumption – such as eating – can only be done over time, and discounting for time encourages negative outcomes such as unsustainable production like desertification, since the desertification comes in the discounted future. 
However, since Islamic banking also calls for rewarding delayed gratification in the form of &quot;return on investment&quot; on both profit-sharing and credit sales, Islamic scholars and economists have tended to insist that time value of money is a valid concept &quot;provided the rate of discount is the &#x27;rate of return&#x27; on capital rather than the rate of interest,&quot; a position critics find specious.

===Early payment of debt===
The opposite of credit sales (i.e. the opposite of charging more in exchange for giving the buyer time to pay) is reduced charges for early payment. This is considered &quot;haram&quot; by the four Sunni schools of jurisprudence (&quot;Hanafi&quot;, &quot;Maliki&quot;, &quot;Shafi&#x27;i&quot;, &quot;Hanbali&quot;), but not by all jurists according to Ridha Saadullah. He notes that such reductions have been permitted by some companions of the Prophet and some of their followers. This position has been advanced by Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn al-Qayyim, and it has, more recently, been adopted by the Islamic &quot;Fiqh&quot; Academy of the OIC. The Academy decided that &quot;reduction of a deferred debt in order to accelerate its repayment, whether at the request of the debtor or the creditor is permissible under &quot;Shariah&quot;. It does not constitute forbidden &quot;riba&quot; if it is not agreed upon in advance and as long as the creditor-debtor relationship remains bilateral. ...&quot;

=== Islamic laws on trading ===
As noted above, the primary focus of Islamic banking is on financing without interest to avoid &quot;riba&quot;, while trade is not an issue (per the Quranic statement that &quot;God has permitted trade and forbidden riba [usury]&quot;. However trade transactions that involve gambling (&quot;maisir&quot;), or excessive risk (&quot;bayu al-gharar&quot;) are &quot;not&quot; permitted. Among the financial instruments and activities common in conventional finance that are considered forbidden (or at least Islamically problematic) by many Islamic scholars and Muslims are: 
*margin trading: This uses borrowed money to buy shares of stock or other financial instruments. It both involves forbidden interest on the borrowed money, and much greater risk than non-margin investing because losses can be greater than the amount borrowed;
*short selling: borrowing/renting shares of stock or some other instruments and selling it, sometimes without possessing it, on the hope that it can be later repurchased at a lower price for a profit. It is traditionally thought to violate the hadith stating &quot;Do not sell which you do not possess,&quot; and has been declared impermissible by numerous sources (Raj Bhala, Taqi Usmani, Humayon Dar.
*day trading: very short term buying and selling of financial instruments) has been called un-Islamic because the short period of &quot;ownership&quot; means day traders do not truly own what they trade, and furthermore pay interest. Among the sources calling it un-Islamic include Yusuf Talal DeLorenzo, and Focus Business Services of the UAE.
*derivatives: contracts that derive their value from the performance of an underlying asset; (The &quot;notional value&quot; of the world&#x27;s over-the-counter derivatives at the end of 2007 was $596 trillion and the gross market value of all outstanding derivatives was $14.5 trillion.) Options, futures and &quot;other derivatives&quot; are &quot;generally&quot; not used in Islamic finance &quot;because of the prohibition against maisir&quot;, Sources stating that most derivative or some kinds of derivative are banned by Islamic scholars include Juan Sole and Andreas Jobst, P. S. Mills and J. R. Presley, Taqi Usmani, and Investopedia. The most commonly used derivative are: 
**forwards: customized contracts to buy or sell an asset at a specified price on a future date. unlike futures contracts forward contracts are not traded on any exchanges; 
**futures: a legal agreement to buy or sell a particular commodity or financial instrument at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future; 
**options: contracts offering the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a security or other financial asset at an agreed-upon price (the strike price) during a certain period of time or on a specific date (exercise date); 
**swaps: contracts through which two parties exchange financial instruments to transfer risk.

On the other hand, at least one Islamic scholar (Mohammed Hashim Kamali) finds &quot;nothing inherently objectionable&quot; in selling and using options, which like other kinds of trade is &quot;mubah&quot; (permissible) in fiqh, and &quot;simply an extension of the basic liberty that the Quran has granted&quot;. And both Islamic finance practitioners and critics find benefit in at least some uses of derivatives and short selling – managing risk in times of financial trouble, improving market efficiency and employee productivity.

At least some in the Islamic finance industry use derivatives and make short sales, and permissibility of this is a subject of &quot;heated debate&quot;.
Global standards for trading Islamic profit-rate and currency swap derivatives were set in 2010 with the &quot;Hedging Master Agreement&quot; (see below).
A &quot;Shariah-certified&quot; short-sale had been created by some Shariah-compliant hedge funds. However both have been criticized as un-Islamic.

===Justification for Islamic banking ===
It has been praised – or at least described positively – for 
*turning a &quot;theory&quot; into a trillion dollar &quot;reality&quot;, asserted Islam into international financial markets (according to Taqi Usmani);
*enriched the Islamic legal system by providing it with real world business questions to find shariah-compliant solutions for (Usmani); 
*creating an &quot;ethical, sustainable, environmentally- and socially-responsible&quot; system (according to Abayomi A. Alawode);
*drawing conventional banks into the industry in search of Muslim customers (Munawar Iqbal and Philip Molyneux);
*drawing new customers and money into banking, rather than taking existing customers and their money away from conventional banking, (Laurent Gheeraert).
*Creating a less risky form of finance (according to Zeti Akhtar Aziz and others), 
**by forbidding speculation, so that, for example, the excesses that led to the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 are avoided (according to Ibrahim Warde);
**and by use of two kinds of accounts:
***&quot;current accounts&quot; – where funds earn no return and (in theory) are held, not invested by the bank, so not subject to risk;
***and &quot;mudarabah&quot; accounts – where the depositors share in any losses with the bank, so diminishing the bank&#x27;s risk.
*While the industry has problems and challenges, these can be explained by
**its relative youth and low position on the &quot;learning curve&quot; that will solved these difficulties over time; and by
**non-Islamic influences which can only be eliminated when the industry operates in a truly Islamic society and environment.

==Industry framework==
Islamic financial institutions take different forms. They may be 
#Full-fledged Islamic financial institutions (for example Islami Bank Bangladesh Ltd, Meezan Bank in Pakistan);
#Islamic &quot;windows&quot; – i.e. separate, sharia-compliant units – in conventional financial institutions (for example: HSBC – HSBC Amanah, American Express Bank, ANZ Grindlays, BNP-Paribas, Chase Manhattan, UBS, Kleinwort Benson, Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia, Ahli United Bank Kuwait, Riyad Bank); (Scholars debate compliance of this form, according to Faleel Jamaldeen, &quot;primarily&quot; because of &quot;where&quot; the funds for these windows come from.)
#Islamic subsidiaries of conventional financial institutions (for example: Citibank subsidiary Citi Islamic Investment Bank (Bahrain), Union Bank of Switzerland subsidiary Noriba Bank).
#Islamic NBFCs or Non Banking Financial Institutions (Like small NBFCs that are operational in India)

===Size and locations===

Sharia-compliant banking grew at an annual rate of 17.6% between 2009 and 2013, faster than conventional banking, and is estimated to be $2 trillion in size,
but at 1% of total world, still much smaller than the conventional sector.

As of 2010, Islamic financial institutions operate in 105 countries. Statistics differ on which country has the largest Islamic banking sector. According to the 2016 World Islamic Banking Competitiveness Report (see table), Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, and Turkey represented over 87% of the international Islamic banking assets. A 2006 report by ISI Analytics also lists Saudi Arabia at the top and Iran as insignificant. In Qatar, Islamic banking assets were valued at $97 billion at the end of 2017, accounting for nearly 81% of total Islamic finance assets, according to QFC Authority chief executive officer Yousuf Mohamed al-Jaida. The country also announced the launch of an energy-focused Islamic bank with $10 billion capital in 2019, which would make it the biggest Islamic lender for energy projects in the world.

However, according to Ibrahim Warde, Shia-majority Iran dominates Islamic banking with $345 billion in Islamic assets, Saudi Arabia with $258 billion, Malaysia $142 billion, Kuwait with $118 billion and UAE with $112 billion. Islamic banks in UAE also provides Islamic investment programs which are Shariah compliant. And according to Reuters, Iranian banks accounted for &quot;over a third&quot; of the estimated worldwide total of Islamic banking assets, (although sanctions have hurt Iran&#x27;s banking industry and &quot;its Islamic financial system has evolved in ways that will complicate ties with foreign banks&quot;). According to the latest central bank data, Iran&#x27;s banking assets as of March 2014 totalled 17,344 trillion riyals or $523 billion at the free market exchange rate.
According to The Banker, as of November 2015, three out of ten top Islamic banks in the world based on return on assets were Iranian.

=== Sharia advisory councils and consultants ===
Because compliance with shariah law is the &quot;&quot; of Islamic finance, Islamic banks and banking institutions that offer Islamic banking products and services should establish a Shariah Supervisory Board (SSB) – to advise them on whether or not some proposed transactions or products follows the Sharia, and to ensure that the operations and activities of the banking institutions comply with Shariah principles.

According to various Islamic banking organizations some requirements for SSBs include: 
*that they be composed of jurists specializing in &quot;fiqh al-muamalat&quot; i.e. Islamic commercial jurisprudence, (Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions, AAOIFI);
*their fatwas (legal opinions) and ruling be binding, (AAOIFI);
*that they have at least three members, (Institute of Islamic Banking and Insurance);
*that their members not be employees of the financial institution they supervise; 
*and be appointed and have their remuneration set by a &quot;general assembly&quot; rather than the institution&#x27;s board of directors, (International Association of Islamic Banks).
In addition, their duties should include:
*calculating zakat payable by Islamic financial institutions, (AAOIFI);
*disposing of non-shariah-compliant income, (AAOIFI);
*advising on the distribution of income among investors and shareholders, (AAOIFI).

Since the beginning of modern Islamic finance, the work of the Shariah boards has become more standardized.
Among the organizations that have issued guidelines and standards for Shariah compliance are the AAOIFI, Fiqh Academy of the OIC, Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) (2009). The guidelines and standards are not regulations though, and each Islamic financial institution has its own SSB, which are not generally obliged to follow them.

However, their home country many have a regulatory organization that they are required to follow.
As of 2013, regulators in Bahrain, Indonesia, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia and Pakistan have developed guidelines for SSBs in their respective jurisdictions. Some countries, like Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Pakistan, Sudan, and the UAE have centralized SSBs (In Malaysia that SSB is called the Shariah Advisory Council, and was set up at Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM).) A number of Shariah advisory firms have now emerged to offer Shariah advisory services to the institutions offering Islamic financial services.

===Financial accounting standards===
The Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI), has been publishing standards and norms for Islamic financial institutions since 1993. By 2010, it had issued &quot;25 accounting standards, seven auditing standards, six governance standards, 41 &quot;shari&#x27;ah&quot; standards and two codes of ethics.&quot; (By 2017 it had issued 94 standards in the &quot;areas of Shari’ah, accounting, auditing, ethics and governance&quot;.) Although it is an independent body, its &quot;pronouncements on the acceptability or otherwise of contractual structures in relation to Islamic financial instruments are to be viewed in the same vein as regulatory edicts.&quot; Its standards are mandatory for Islamic financial institutions in Bahrain, Sudan, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, and recommended for other Muslim countries and Islamic financial institutions according to Muhammad Akram Khan.
 Established in Algiers in 1990, its original name was Financial Accounting Organization for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions. It later moved its headquarters to Bahrain.

The International Islamic Financial Market – a standardization body of the Islamic Financial Services Board for Islamic capital market products and operations – was founded in November 2001 through the cooperation of the governments and central banks of Brunei, Indonesia and Sudan. Its secretariat is located in Manama Bahrain. It is not a regulatory body and its recommendations are &quot;not implemented by most Islamic banks&quot;. Faleel Jamaldeen differentiates its controlling body (Islamic Financial Services Board) from the other Islamic Financial standards organ, the AAOIFI, saying,the AAOIFI sets best practices for handling the financial reporting requirements of Islamic financial institutions, IFSB standards are mainly concerned with the identification, management, and disclosure of risk related to Islamic financial products.
Individual countries also have accounting standards. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan issues Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS).

===Supporting institutions===
The Islamic Interbank Money Market was established by Bank Negara Malaysia on 3 January 1994, and has developed instruments to manage the liquidity needs of the Islamic financial institutions – &quot;funding and adjusting portfolios over the short term&quot;.

The Islamic Financial Services Board was founded on 3 November 2002 at Kuala Lumpur by central banks of Bahrain, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan along with the Islamic Development Bank, AAOIFI, and IMF.
As of April 2015, the 188 members of the IFSB comprise 61 regulatory and supervisory authorities, eight international inter-governmental organisations, and 119 market players (financial institutions, professional firms and industry associations) operating in 45 jurisdictions. From 2002 to 2012 it issued 17 standards, guiding principles and notes.
Its objective is to standardize and harmonize the operation and supervision of Islamic financial institutions, standards and capital adequacy, risk management and corporate governance in consultation with a wide array of stakeholders and after following a lengthy process. It complements the task of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. As of 2015 it had published 17 standards and six guidance notes.

The Islamic International Ratings Agency started operations in July 2005 in Bahrain. It is sponsored by 17 multilateral development institutions, banks and other rating agencies.

The Dow Jones Islamic Market Index (DJIMI) was established in 1996. The Index has been approved by Fiqh Academy of the OIC. It uses three levels of screening—eliminating businesses involved in activities not allowed by Islamic law (alcohol, pork, gambling, prostitution, pornography, etc.); eliminating companies whose total debts divided by their 12-month average market capitalization are 33% or more of their total sources of funds; eliminating companies that have &#x27;impure income or expenditure&#x27; (including, of course, interest) of more than 5–10 per cent of their income or expenditure (eliminating businesses with &quot;any&quot; &#x27;impure income&#x27; being considered impractical).

In 2006, Citigroup launched the Dow Jones Citigroup Sukuk Index. The sukuk making up the Index must be at least $250 million in size, have a maturity of at least one year and a minimum rating of BBB-/Baaa3. In 1998, the FTSE Global Islamic Index was launched. It has 15 Islamic indices for various regions.
In 2007, the MSCI Islamic Index series was launched, one of the &quot;MSCI &#x27;Faith-Based&#x27; Indexes&quot;. It is constructed from the conventional MSCI country indices and covers 69 developed, emerging and frontier markets, including regions such as the Gulf Cooperation Council and Arabian markets.

===Central banking===
Although no Muslim country has yet banned interest on loans completely, suggestions have been made as to how to deal with monetary policy when central banks operate in an interest-free environment and there are no longer any interest rates to lower or raise. Economist Mohammad N. Siddiqi has proposed that central banks offer &quot;refinance facilities&quot; to expand or contract credit as needed to deal with inflation or deflation.

He also proposes that short term credit for the production sector of the economy, be estimated by the central banks and the provided by them by manipulating the &quot;refinance ratio&quot; and the &quot;lending ratio&quot;.

According to economist and Islamic finance critic Feisal Khan, a &quot;true&quot; or strict Islamic banking and finance system of profit and loss sharing (the type supported by Taqi Usmani and the Shariah Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan) would severely cripple central banks&#x27; ability to fight a credit crunch or liquidity crisis that leads to a severe recession (such as happened in 2007–8). This is because if credit was provided by taking &quot;a direct equity stake in every enterprise&quot; (the PLS approach) it would contract in a credit crunch. But situations like this – when financiers are &quot;less and less sure of the creditworthiness of their financial sector counterparties&quot; and essentially stop lending to even the biggest and most stable borrowers or even other banks – is exactly the time when credit expansion and &quot;flooding&quot; the economy with liquidity is needed to prevent widespread business bankruptcy and unemployment.

==Products, services and contracts==

Banking makes up most of the Islamic finance industry. Banking products are often classified in one of three broad categories, two of which are &quot;investment accounts&quot;: 
*Profit and loss sharing modes – &quot;musharakah&quot; and &quot;mudarabah&quot; – where financier and the user of finance share profits and losses, are based on &quot;contracts of partnership&quot;. These have been called the &quot;real and ideal&quot; modes of Islamic finance as Islam calls for sharing of rewards and losses by all who contribute capital to a commercial enterprise (according to Taqi Usmani and other theoreticians of Islamic finance).
*&quot;Asset-backed financing&quot;, &quot;debt-like instruments&quot; such as mark-up (&quot;murabaha&quot;), leasing (&quot;ijara&quot;), cash advances for the purchase of agricultural produce (&quot;salam&quot;), and cash advances for the manufacture of assets (&quot;istisna&quot;&#x27;). These are based on &quot;contracts of exchange&quot;, and involve the &quot;purchase and hire of goods or assets and services on a fixed-return basis&quot;. The fixed return resembles the interest of conventional banking rather than variable profits and losses, but is called &quot;profit&quot; or &quot;markup&quot;, not &quot;interest&quot;. Originally these modes were intended by Islamic banking advocates to be &quot;interim&quot; measures, or to be used for situations where participatory financing was not practical, but now account for the great bulk of investments in many Islamic banks.
the third category consists of 
*Modes based on contracts of safety and security, include safe-keeping contracts (&quot;wadi’ah&quot;) for current deposits (called checking accounts in the US), and agency contracts (&quot;wakalah&quot;).

Most Islamic finance is in banking, but non-banking finance such as &quot;sukuk&quot;, equity markets, investment funds, insurance (&quot;takaful&quot;), and microfinance, 
is also fast-growing, and as of 2013 represented about one-fifth of total assets in Islamic finance.

These products – and Islamic finance in general – are based on Islamic commercial contracts and contract law, with many products named after a particular contracts (e.g. &quot;mudaraba&quot;) although they are combinations of more than one contract.

===Profit and loss sharing===

While the original Islamic banking proponents hoped profit-loss sharing (PLS) would be the primary mode of finance replacing interest-based loans,
long-term financing with profit-and-loss-sharing mechanisms is &quot;far riskier and costlier&quot; than the long term or medium-term lending of the conventional banks – according to critics such as economist Tarik M. Yousef – and has &quot;declined to almost negligible proportions&quot;. Loans are permitted in Islam if the interest that is paid is linked to the profit or loss obtained by the investment. The concept of profit acts as a symbol in Islam as equal sharing of profits, losses, and risks.

====Mudarabah====
A &quot;mudarabah&quot; or &quot;mudharabah&quot; contract is a profit sharing partnership in a commercial enterprise. One partner, &quot;rabb-ul-mal&quot;, is a silent or sleeping partner who provides money. The other partner, &quot;mudarib&quot;, provides expertise and management. The arrangement is similar to venture capital in conventional finance, in which a venture capitalist finances an entrepreneur, who provides management and labor.

Profits are shared between the parties according to a pre-agreed ratio, usually either 50%–50%, or 60% for the &quot;mudarib&quot; and 40% for &quot;rabb-ul-mal&quot;. If there is a loss, the &quot;rabb-ul-mal&quot; loses the invested capital, and the &quot;mudarib&quot; loses the invested time and effort. The sharing of risk reflects the view of Islamic banking proponents that under Islam, the user of capital – labor and management – should not bear all the risk of failure. Sharing of risk, according to proponents, results in a balanced distribution of income, and prevents financiers from dominating the economy.

==== Musharakah (joint venture) ====
Like &quot;mudaraba&quot;, &quot;musharakah&quot; is also a profit and loss sharing partnership, but one where investment comes from all the partners, all partners are given the option of participating in the management of the business, and all partners share in losses according to the ratio (&quot;pro rata&quot;) of their investment.

&quot;Musharakah&quot; may be &quot;permanent&quot; or &quot;diminishing&quot;. It is often used in investment projects, letters of credit, and the purchase or real estate or property. Use of &quot;musharaka&quot; is not great. In Malaysia, for example, the share of &quot;musharaka&quot; (or at least permanent &quot;musharaka&quot;) financing declined from 1.4 percent in 2000 to 0.2 per cent in 2006

====Diminishing Musharaka====
&quot;Musharaka al-Mutanaqisa&quot;, (literally &quot;diminishing partnership&quot;), is a popular type of financing for major purchases such as housing. In it, the bank and purchaser (customer) have joint ownership of a purchased asset with the customer also leasing the asset. As the customer gradually paying off the cost the bank&#x27;s equity share diminishes from all but the customer percentage of downpayment to nothing. 
If the customer defaults and the asset is sold, the bank and the customer split the proceeds according to each party&#x27;s current equity.

It would assist at this point to highlight how &quot;Musharaka al-Mutanaqisa&quot; is different from conventional banking mortgages, so that the salient difference, both in terms of law and practice is understood. To assist in this understanding, let&#x27;s first see how regular mortgages work in the United States:

Once a buyer wishes to purchase a home, she approaches the lender and requests a loan. The lender in turn, if buyer qualifies, will lend money to buy the house, and the bank will usually set a fixed percentage of interest to be paid to the lender. Each payment to lender will then include a return of the portion of principal and the interest accrued on the remaining balance for that period. Over time, the entire principal is paid back to the lender, together with all the interest that is due. In terms of the ownership of the house, the buyer/borrower/debtor will have legal title to the house during the term of repayment and thereafter too. In the county title records office, the borrower will have a title deed showing the buyer as the title holder, and not the bank. Any diminishing value of the house is the risk of the borrower and not the bank. On the other hand, any appreciation is also of the borrower and the bank cannot ask for more principal due to the appreciation. Hence, the bank and the borrower know at the outset the exact obligations to each other. The bank, in an effort to secure its loan, will place a lien (a charge) on the property, so that if the borrower does not repay the loan, the bank gets the right to foreclose on the borrower&#x27;s right to hold title and have the title be transferred to the bank (or the house be auctioned and the proceeds received by bank). In the U.S., most states have a judicial foreclosure process where the bank asks the court to sell the property to recover the balance of its loan and accrued interest, plus any other costs of the suit.

How is then &quot;Musharaka al-Mutanaqisa&quot; going to address the interest portion of the payment from borrower to the bank. The concept of title here then becomes critical, because the Islamic bank will still come up with the money to buy the house, but the bank will buy the house in partnership with the homeowner. Together the bank and the borrower will become &quot;tenants in common&quot; and the local recorder office will show both the bank and the buyer as joint owners. The percentage of ownership of the house at this point will be based on money ratio between bank and buyer. Let&#x27;s assume buyer paid 10% and the bank paid 90% of the price. However, since the bank will not be living in the house, the buyer will agree to a rental payment for the use of the 90% of the portion of the property. In addition, buyer will also agree to buy a certain percent of the bank&#x27;s portion on a monthly basis. Hence, buyer pays rent for usage, and also an amount to buy out the bank&#x27;s portion. Since there is no interest being paid, this form of ownership (in partnership) is acceptable under shariah. At the end of the agreed rental term, the buyer will have bought out all of the 90% portion of the partnership, and buyer can then ask the bank to dissolve the partnership. The recorder&#x27;s office will have a new title deed recorded, whereby the bank ceases to be a tenant-in-common with the buyer, and the buyer becomes the entire title holder (whether alone or with spouse, or any other entity as chosen by buyer).

The essence of both transactions is different, and that is based on the outset as to who exactly legally has title to the house at the outset. The other difference is that the monthly payments by buyer in Islamic banking are rent and partnership buyout payments, and not return of principal and interest as they are in conventional banking. Economically then, the Islamic bank also shares in the risk of house value dropping, where in the conventional banking model the bank has not taken any risk of depressed values. The opposite is true also, where both the Islamic bank and the buyer gain if house is sold for more than the book value of the partnership. In conventional banking, the bank does not benefit from rising prices.

Skeptics of the Islamic banking argue that the result is the same: the buyer makes monthly payments to own the house, much like a conventional mortgage. But has the risk of home ownership not been shared in Islamic banking? If it has legally, then it is not the same as the conventional mortgage transaction.

=== Asset-backed financing ===

Asset-backed or debt-type instruments (also called contracts of exchange) are sales contracts that allow for the transfer of one commodity for another commodity, the transfer of a commodity for money, or the transfer of money for money. They include &quot;Murabaha&quot;, &quot;Musawamah&quot;, &quot;Salam&quot;, &quot;Istisna’a&quot;, and &quot;Tawarruq&quot;.

==== Murâbaḥah ====
&quot;Murabahah&quot; (or &quot;murabaha&quot;) is an Islamic contract for a sale where the buyer and seller agree on the markup (profit) or &quot;cost-plus&quot; price for the item(s) being sold.
In Islamic banking it has become a term for both a marked-up price and deferred payment – a way of financing a good (home, car, business supplies, etc.) whereby the bank buys the good and resells it to the customer at higher price (informing the customer of the price increase), and offering to take payment in installments or in a lump sum.

&quot;Murabahah&quot; has also come to be the most common type of Islamic finance. One estimate is that 80% of Islamic lending is by &quot;Murabahah&quot;. This is despite the fact that (according to Uthmani) Islamic finance Shari‘ah supervisory boards &quot;are unanimous&quot; in agreement that &quot;Murabahah&quot; loans &quot;are not ideal modes of financing&quot;, and should be used only &quot;when more preferable means of finance – &quot;&quot;musharakah&quot;, &quot;mudarabah&quot;, &quot;salam&quot; or &quot;istisna&quot;&#x27; – are not workable for some reasons&quot;.

&quot;Murabahah&quot; differs from conventional finance (such as mortgages for homes or hire purchase for furniture or appliances), in that the fixed return with which the bank is compensated is called &quot;profit&quot; and not interest, and that the financier may not keep for itself any penalties for late payment.

Economists have questioned whether &quot;Murabahah&quot; is actually distinct from debt- and interest-based finance. The fact that there is a principal and a payment plan means that there is an implied interest rate, based on conventional banking interest rates such as LIBOR. Others complain that in practice most &quot;murabaḥah&quot; transactions do not involve actual buying or selling of goods or commodities, but are merely cash-flows between banks, brokers and borrowers. In contrast to LIBOR, Islamic banks lend money based on their own reference rate known as the Islamic Interbank Benchmark Rate which &quot;uses expected profits from short-term money and a forecasted return on the assets of the bank receiving funds&quot;.

=====Bai&#x27; muajjal=====
In Islamic jurisprudence (&quot;fiqh&quot;), &quot;Bai-muajjal&quot;, also called &quot;bai&#x27;-bithaman ajil&quot;, or BBA, is a credit sale or deferred payment sale, i.e. the sale of goods on a deferred payment basis. In Islamic finance, the &quot;bai&#x27; muajjal&quot; product also involves the price markup of a &quot;murabahah&quot; contract, and a &quot;murabahah&quot; product involves a &quot;bai-muajjal&quot; deferred payment. Thus the terms and are often used interchangeably, (according to Hans Visser), or &quot;in practice ... used together&quot; (according to Faleel Jamaldeen).
However, according to another (Bangladeshi) source, &quot;Bai&#x27; muajjal&quot; differs from &quot;Murabahah&quot; in that the client, not the bank, is in possession of and bear the risk for the goods being purchased before completion of payment. And according to a Malaysian source, the main difference between BBA (short for bai&#x27;-bithaman ajil) and &quot;murabaha&quot; – at least as practiced in Malaysia – is that &quot;murabaha&quot; is used for medium and short term financing and BBA for longer term.

&quot;Bai&#x27; muajjal&quot; as a finance product was introduced in 1983 by Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad.

=====Bai&#x27; al &#x27;inah (sale and buy-back agreement)=====
&quot;Bai&#x27; al inah&quot; (literally, &quot;double sale&quot; or &quot;a loan in the form of a sale&quot;), 
is a financing arrangement where the financier/bank buys some asset from the customer on spot basis, with the financier&#x27;s payment constituting the &quot;loan&quot;. The asset is then sold back to the customer who pays in installments over time, essentially &quot;repaying the loan&quot;. Since loaning of cash for profit is forbidden in Islamic Finance, some scholars do not believe &quot;Bai&#x27; al &#x27;inah&quot; is permissible in Islam. According to the Institute of Islamic Banking and Insurance, it &quot;serves as a ruse for lending on interest&quot;, but &quot;Bai&#x27; al inah&quot; is practiced in Malaysia and similar jurisdictions.

==== Musawamah ====
A &quot;Musawamah&quot; (literally &quot;bargaining&quot;) contract is used if the exact cost of the item(s) sold to the bank/financier either cannot be or is not ascertained. &quot;Musawamah&quot; differs from &quot;Murabahah&quot; in that the &quot;seller is not under the obligation to reveal his cost or purchase price&quot;. &quot;Musawamah&quot; is the &quot;most common&quot; type of &quot;trading negotiation&quot; seen in Islamic commerce.

==== Istisna and Bai Salam====
&quot;Istisna&quot; (also &quot;Bia Istisna&quot; or &quot;Bai&#x27; Al-Istisna&quot;) and &quot;Bia Salam&quot; (also &quot;Bai us salam&quot; or just &quot;salam&quot;) are &quot;forward contracts&quot; – customized contracts where immediate payment is made for goods in the future – goods not yet manufactured, built, or harvested.
&quot;Istisna&quot; contracts (literally, a request to manufacture something) are limited by Islamic fiqh to use for manufacturing, processing, or construction, and may be applied in these regards within the sphere of supply chain management, while salam &quot;can be effected on anything&quot; — except gold, silver, or currencies based on these metals. 
On the other hand, a salam contract cannot be cancelled unilaterally, the full price must be paid in advance, and the time of delivery must be specified – restrictions that do not apply to &quot;istisna&quot;.

In a &quot;istisna&quot; contract, the financer/bank can makes payments in stages, to finance raw materials (in the case of manufacturing), or construction materials (in the case of the construction project). When the product/structure is finished and sold, the bank can be repaid.

&quot;Bia salam&quot; and &quot;istisna&quot; contracts should be as detailed as possible to avoid uncertainty. 
&quot;Salam&quot; contracts predate &quot;istisna&quot; and were designed to fulfill the needs of small farmers and traders. Salam is a preferred financing structure and carries higher order of &quot;Shariah&quot; compliance than contracts such as &quot;Murabahah&quot; or &quot;Musawamah&quot;.

Examples of use of &quot;istisna&quot; in the Islamic finance world include use by the Kuwait Finance House and the Barzan gas project in Qatar. Examples of banks using &quot;Salam&quot; are ADCB Islamic Banking and Dubai Islamic Bank.

==== Ijarah ====
&quot;Ijarah&quot;, (literally &quot;to give something on rent&quot;)
is a leasing or renting contract. In traditional Islamic jurisprudence (&quot;fiqh&quot;), it means a contract for the hiring of persons, services, or the &quot;usufruct&quot; of a property, generally for a fixed period and price.

In Islamic finance, &quot;al Ijarah&quot; usually refers to a leasing contract that also includes a sales contract. Property such as plant, office automation, or motor vehicle, is leased to a client for stream of rental and purchase payments, so that the end of the leasing period coincides with completion of purchase payments and transfer of ownership to the lessee, and otherwise follows Islamic regulations. 
There are several types of &quot;ijarah&quot; in Islamic finance (&quot;operating ijarah&quot; or &quot;ijarah tashgheeliah&quot;, are leases without sales and finance):

===== Ijarah thumma al bai&#x27; and Ijarah wa-iqtina =====
&quot;Ijarah thumma al bai&quot;&#x27; (hire purchase) and &quot;Ijarah wa-iqtina&quot; (&quot;lease and ownership&quot;) involve the leasing/renting/hiring of a good, paid in installments and ending with its purchase (or option to purchase) by/for the customer. Both involve two contracts – a lease and a transfer of ownership of the asset or the property – that should be recorded in separate documents.

The two modes differ in that in &quot;Ijarah wa-iqtina&quot; (or &quot;ijara muntahia bittamleek&quot;) sale/ownership transfer is &quot;an option given to the lessee&quot; and cannot be a precondition. In &quot;ijara thumma bay&quot;&#x27; sale is part of the contract.

===== ijara mawsoofa bi al dhimma =====
In a &quot;forward ijarah&quot; or &quot;ijara mawsoofa bi al dhimma&quot; Islamic contract, the service or benefit being leased is defined, rather than the particular unit providing that service/benefit.
In contemporary Islamic finance, it is used to finance construction (of a home, office, factory, etc.) combined with a &quot;Istisna&quot; contract. The party begins leasing the asset after &quot;taking delivery&quot; of it.

===== Ijarah challenges =====
Among the complaints made against &quot;ijara&quot; are that in practice some rules protecting the customer are overlooked, that its rules provide weaker legal standing and consumer protection and less flexibility than conventional mortgage loan or car finance, as well as higher costs.

====Tawarruq====

A &quot;Tawarruq&quot; (literally &quot;turns into silver&quot;, or &quot;monetization&quot;) 
contract/product where the client/customer can raise cash to be repaid later by buying and selling some readily saleable asset. 
An example of this would be a customer wishing to borrow $1000 in cash having their bank buy $1,100 worth of a commodity such as iron from a supplier, buying the iron from the bank on credit with 12 months to pay the $1100 back, immediately selling the metal back to the bank for $1000 cash to be paid on the spot. The bank resells the iron to the supplier. (This would be the equivalent of borrowing $1000 for a year at an interest rate of 11 per cent.)

Like &quot;Bai&#x27; al inah&quot; mentioned above, the greater complexity of this transaction means more fees and higher costs than a conventional bank loan, but (in theory) compliance with shariah law because of the tangible assets that underlie the transactions . 
However, critics complain that &quot;billions of dollars&quot; of putative commodity-based tawarruq transactions have evaded the required commodity trades; and Islamic scholars both contemporary and classical have forbidden the practice. Nonetheless, as of 2012 Islamic banks using &quot;Tawarruq&quot; include the United Arab Bank, QNB Al Islamic, Standard Chartered of United Arab Emirates, and Bank Muamalat Malaysia.

===Charitable lending===
====Qardh-ul Hasan====
Taqi Usmani insists that &quot;role of loans&quot; (as opposed to investment or finance) in a truly Islamic society is &quot;very limited&quot;, and that Shariah law permits loans not as an ordinary occurrence, &quot;but only in cases of dire need&quot;.
A shariah-compliant loan is known as &quot;Qardh-ul Hasan&quot;, (also &quot;Qard Hasan&quot;, literally: &quot;benevolent loan&quot; or &quot;beneficence loan&quot;). It is often described as an interest-free loan extended to needy people. 
Such loans are often made by social service agencies, or by a firm as a benefit to its employees, rather than by Islamic banks. They are analogous to the microcredit of conventional finance, when it does not provide for an interest.

Quoting the Islamic prophet Muhammad, some sources insist that lenders may not gain &quot;any advantage or benefits&quot; from the loan, let alone interest. 
However, some Islamic banks offer products called &quot;qardh-ul hasan&quot; which charge lenders a management fee,
and others have savings account products called &quot;qardh-ul hasan,&quot; (the &quot;loan&quot; being a deposit to a bank account) where the debtor (the bank) may pay an extra amount beyond the principal amount of the loan (known as a hibah, literally gift) if the extra is not an obligation of the account/loan agreement.

===Contracts of safety, security, service===
These contracts are intended to help individual and business customers keep their funds safe.

====Hawala====

&quot;Hawala&quot; (also &quot;Hiwala&quot;, &quot;Hewala&quot;, or &quot;Hundi&quot;; literally &quot;transfer&quot; or &quot;trust&quot;) is a widely used, informal &quot;value transfer system&quot; for transferring funds from one geographical area to another, based not on wire transfers but on a huge network of money brokers (known as &quot;Hawaladars&quot;) throughout the Muslim world. 
&quot;Hawala&quot; was not started as an &quot;halal&quot; alternative to conventional banking transfers, since electronic wire transfers have not been found in violation of sharia. However, &quot;hawala&quot; has the advantage of being available in places wire transfer is not, and predates conventional banking remittance systems by many centuries.

In the first half of the 20th century it lost ground to instruments of the conventional banking system, but regained it starting in the late 20th century with the economic migration of Muslim workers to wealthier countries in the West and the Gulf and their need to send money home. Dubai has traditionally served as a hub.

&quot;Hawala&quot; is based on a short term, discountable, negotiable, promissory note (or bill of exchange) called &quot;Hundi&quot;, transferred from one debtor to another. After the debt is transferred to the second debtor, the first debtor is free from his/her obligation. Recipient of the funds often identify themselves with passwords given to them by the sender. Hawaladars are often small traders who work at &quot;hawala&quot; as a sideline or moonlighting operation. Hawaladars networks are usually family or clan-based, and enforcement of the contracts is based on these networks rather than the power of the state.

====Kafala====
&quot;Kafala&quot; (literally &quot;guarantee), is called &quot;surety&quot; or &quot;guaranty&quot; in conventional finance. A third party accepts an existing obligation and becomes responsible for fulfilling someone&#x27;s liability.

====Rahn====
&quot;Rahn&quot; (collateral or pledge contract) is property pledged against an obligation. A &quot;rahn&quot; contract is made in order to secure a financial liability. According to Mecelle, &quot;rahn&quot; is &quot;to make a property a security in respect of a right of claim, the payment in full of which from the property is permitted.&quot; Hadith tradition states that the Islamic prophet Muhammad purchased food grains on credit pledging his armor as &quot;rahn&quot;.

==== Wakalah====
In a &quot;Wakalah&quot; contract, a person (the principal or &quot;muwakkel&quot;) appoints a representative (the agent or &quot;wakil&quot;) to undertake transactions on his/her behalf, that the principal does not have the time, knowledge or expertise to perform themselves – similar to a power of attorney agreement in conventional legal terms. Wakalah should be a non-binding contract for a fixed fee. The agent&#x27;s services may include selling and buying, lending and borrowing, debt assignment, guarantee, gifting, litigation and making payments, and are involved in numerous Islamic products like &quot;Musharakah&quot;, &quot;Mudarabah&quot;, &quot;Murabaha&quot;, &quot;Salam&quot; and &quot;Ijarah&quot;.

An example of &quot;wakalah&quot; is found in a &quot;mudarabah&quot; profit and loss sharing contract (above) where the &quot;mudarib&quot; (the party that receives the capital and manages the enterprise) serves as a &quot;wakil&quot; for the &quot;rabb-ul-mal&quot; (the silent party that provides the capital) 

=== Deposit side of Islamic banking===
From the point of view of depositors, &quot;Investment accounts&quot; of Islamic banks – based on profit and loss sharing and asset-backed finance – play a similar role to the &quot;time deposits&quot; of conventional banks. (For example, one Islamic bank – Al Rayan Bank in the United Kingdom – talks about &quot;Fixed Term&quot; deposits or savings accounts). In both, the depositor agrees to hold the deposit at the bank for a fixed amount of time. In Islamic banking return is measured as &quot;expected profit rate&quot; rather than interest.

&quot;Demand deposits&quot; of Islamic financial institutions, which provide no return, are structured with &quot;qard al-hasana&quot; (also known as &quot;qard&quot;, see above in Charitable lending) contracts&quot;,&quot; or less commonly as &quot;wadiah&quot; or &quot;amanah&quot; contracts, according to Mohammad O. Farooq.

====Restricted and unrestricted investment accounts====
At least in one Muslim country with a strong Islamic banking sector (Malaysia), there are two main types of investment accounts offered by Islamic banks for those investing specifically in profit and loss sharing modes – restricted or unrestricted.
*Restricted investment accounts (RIA) enable customers to specify the investment mandate and the underlying assets that their funds may be invested in, 
*unrestricted investment accounts (UIAs) do not, leaving the bank or investing institution full authority to invest funds as &quot;it deems fit&quot;, unrestricted by purpose, geography, or means of investing. In exchange the accounts may be &quot;tailored to meet a diverse range of customer needs and preferences&quot;, but are not guaranteed against losses.

Some have complained that UIA accounts lack transparency, fail to follow Islamic banking standards, lack of customer representation on the board of governors, and have sometimes hidden poor performance from investors.

====Demand deposits====
Islamic banks also offer &quot;demand deposits&quot;, i.e. accounts which promise the convenience of returning funds to depositors on demand, but in return usually pay little if any return on investment and/or charge more fees.

====Qard====
Because demand deposits pay little if any return and &quot;Qard al-hasana&quot; (mentioned above) loans are forbidden to pay any &quot;stipulated benefit&quot;, the Qard mode is a popular Islamic finance structure for demand deposits. In this design, customer deposits constitute &quot;loans&quot; and the Islamic bank a &quot;borrower&quot; who guarantees full return of the &quot;lenders&quot; deposits.

However, critics (M.O. Farooq, Mohammad Hashim Kamali) see conflicts between qard&#x27;s role in demand deposits and the dictates of traditional Islamic jurisprudence. &quot;Qard al-hasana&quot; loans are intended to be acts of charity to the needy who are allowed lenient repayment. 
Islamic banks, on the other hand, are multi-million or billion dollar profit-making institutions, and their depositor/lenders typically expect to be able to withdraw their deposits on demand rather than be asked to be lenient with the bank.

A further issue is that at least some conventional banks do pay a modest interest on their demand/savings deposits, and Islamic banks often feel a need to compete with them, finding an (at least putative) shariah compliant technique to do so. The means that has been used is &quot;Hibah&quot; (literally &quot;gift&quot;), in the form of prizes, exemptions, etc., which officially differ from the conventional banks&#x27; interest/&quot;riba&quot; in not being legally stipulated or time bound. 
Its use has nonetheless has been attacked by at least one scholar as &quot;entry of &quot;riba&quot; through the back door&quot;.

==== Wadiah and Amanah====

Two other contracts sometimes used by Islamic finance institutions for pay-back-on-demand accounts instead of &quot;qard al-hasanah&quot;, 
are &quot;Wadi&#x27;ah&quot; (literally &quot;safekeeping&quot;) and &quot;Amanah&quot; (literally &quot;trust&quot;).
Sources disagree over the definition of these two contracts. &quot;Often the same words are used by different banks and have different meanings.&quot; 
Sometimes &quot;wadiah&quot; and &quot;amanah&quot; are used interchangeably.

Sources differ over whether &quot;Wadiah&quot; deposits are simply guaranteed by the bank or must be kept unused with 100% reserve, with another contract – called &quot;Wadia yadd ad daman&quot; – allowing &quot;rights of disposal&quot; to invest but guaranteeing &quot;repayment of the whole or part&quot; of &quot;current account deposit&quot;. 
Sources also differ over whether banks can use &quot;Amanah&quot; accounts for its operations – if it &quot;obtains&quot; the &quot;authority&quot; of depositor – or not. Sources do agree that the trustee of &quot;amanah&quot; is not liable for &quot;unforeseen mishap&quot; (Abdullah and Chee), &quot;resulting from circumstances beyond its control&quot;,(financialislam.com), or if there has not been a &quot;breach of duty&quot; (Reuters).

According to at least one report, in practice no examples of 100 percent reserve banking are known to exist.

===Other Sharia-compliant financial instruments===
==== Sukuk (Islamic bonds) ====
&quot;Sukuk&quot;, (plural of صك Sakk) – often called &quot;Islamic&quot; or &quot;sharia compliant&quot; bonds – are financial certificates developed as an alternative to conventional bonds. Different types of sukuk are based on different structures of Islamic contracts mentioned above (&quot;murabaha&quot;, &quot;ijara&quot;, &quot;wakala&quot;, &quot;istisna&quot;, &quot;musharaka&quot;, &quot;istithmar&quot;, etc.), depending on the project the &quot;sukuk&quot; are financing.

Like conventional bonds, &quot;sukuk&quot; have expiration dates. But instead of receiving interest payments on money lent as bonds do, &quot;sukuk&quot; holders are given &quot;(nominal) part-ownership of an asset&quot; from which they receive income &quot;either from profits generated by that asset or from rental payments made by the issuer&quot;.
The part ownership element and (at least in theory) the lack of a guaranteed repayment of initial investment resembles equity instruments. However, in practice, most &quot;sukuk&quot; are &quot;asset-based&quot; rather than &quot;asset-backed&quot;—their assets are not truly owned by their Special Purpose Vehicle, and (like conventional bonds), their holders have recourse to the originator if there is a shortfall in payments.

The &quot;sukuk&quot; market began to take off around 2000 and as of 2013, &quot;sukuk&quot; represent 0.25 percent of global bond markets. The value of the total outstanding &quot;sukuk&quot; as of the end of 2014 was $294 billion, with $188 billion from Asia, and $95.5 billion from the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Demand for &quot;sukuk&quot; should able to support further growth.

==== Takaful (Islamic insurance) ====

&quot;Takaful&quot;, sometimes called &quot;Islamic insurance&quot;, differs from conventional insurance in that it is based on mutuality so that the risk is borne by all the insured rather than by the insurance company. Rather than paying premiums to a company, the insured contribute to a pooled fund overseen by a manager, and they receive any profits from the fund&#x27;s investments.
Any surplus in the common pool of accumulated premiums should be redistributed to the insured. (As with all Islamic finance, funds must not be invested in &quot;haram&quot; activities like interest-bearing instruments, enterprises involved in alcohol or pork.)

Like other Islamic finance operations, the &quot;takaful&quot; industry has been praised by some for providing &quot;superior alternatives&quot; to conventional equivalents; and criticized by others for not being significantly different from them in its use of the &quot;law of large numbers&quot; to spread risk, or its use of conventional corporate (not mutual) management practices.

The industry is projected to reach $25 billion in size by the end of 2017.

====Islamic credit cards====
While a number of scholars (Manzur Ahmad, Hossein Askari, Zamir Iqbal and Abbas Mirakhor) have cast doubt on the shariah compliance of any kind of credit card – or at least cards that &quot;can offer the same service as the conventional credit card&quot; – there are credit cards claiming to be shariah-compliant (particularly in Malaysia, where as of about 2012 they were offered by Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad, CIMB Islamic Bank Berhad, HSBC Amanah Malaysia Berhad, Maybank Islamic Berhad, RHB Islamic Bank Berhad, Standard Chartered Berhad, Am Islamic Bank Berhad.),
These generally following one of a number of arrangements:

#&quot;ujra&quot; (The client simply pays an annual service fee for using the card);
#&quot;ijara&quot; (Card is used as a leased asset. Ownership of whatever is purchased to card user after installments payments are complete.);
#&quot;kafala&quot; (The bank acts as a kafil (guarantor) for the transactions of the card holder. For its services, the card holder is obligated to pay &quot;kafala bi ujra&quot; (fee));
#&quot;qard&quot; ( The client acts as the borrower and the bank as a lender.);
#&quot;bai al-ina/wadiah&quot; (The bank sells the customer some item/commodity at a certain price and then shortly thereafter repurchases from the client at a lower price. The difference between the two prices is the income of the bank for its trouble administering the card. The customer&#x27;s initial payment to the bank serves as the account balance for the credit card and ceiling limit of what can be spent. The bank&#x27;s repayment to the customer constitutes whatever balance is left over after purchases.)
#cards that act much like debit cards, with any transaction &quot;directly debited&quot; from the holder&#x27;s bank account.

==== Islamic funds ====

Islamic funds are professionally managed investment funds that pool money from many investors to purchase securities that have been screened for sharia compliance. They include mutual funds holding equity and/or sukuk securities, but also Islamic &quot;alternative&quot; funds deal in &quot;anything from private equity and real estate to infrastructure and commodity asset classes.&quot; They began growing fairly rapidly in about 2004, and as of 2014 there were 943 Islamic mutual funds worldwide and as of May 2015, they held $53.2 billion of assets under management, with &quot;latent demand&quot; for considerable growth.

For equity mutual funds, companies whose shares are being considered for purchase must be screened 
#to exclude those that are involved in alcohol, tobacco, pork, adult entertainment industry, gambling, weapons, etc., but also 
#those that are &quot;engaged in prohibited speculative transactions (involving uncertainty or gambling), which are likely leveraged with debt&quot;, by examining the company&#x27;s &quot;financial ratios&quot; to meet &quot;certain financial benchmarks&quot;.

Creators of benchmarks to gauge the (equity) funds&#x27; performance include the Dow Jones Islamic market index series and the FTSE Global Islamic Index Series.

At least from 2000 to 2009, Islamic equity funds under-performed both Islamic and conventional equity benchmarks, particularly as the 2007–08 financial crisis set in (according to a study by Raphie Hayat and Roman Kraeuss).

====Islamic derivatives====

As mentioned above (see Islamic laws on trading), &quot;almost all conservative Sharia scholars&quot; believe derivatives (i.e. securities whose price is dependent upon one or more underlying assets) are in violation of Islamic prohibitions on &quot;gharar&quot;. This, however, has not stopped the Islamic finance industry from using some of these instruments, and derivative permissibility in Islam is a subject of &quot;heated debate&quot;.

As of 2013 the Islamic derivatives market was &quot;in its infancy&quot; and its size was not known. 
Contracts or combinations of contracts for derivatives include swaps and options:

=====Swaps=====
Faleel Jamaldeen describes the Islamic swap market as being of two kinds of swaps: 
*profit rate swap: &quot;based on exchanging fixed for floating rate profits&quot;. (Similar to interest rate swaps of conventional finance. As of 2007, this kind of swap had the largest market of any variety of swaps.) According to Harris Irfan, the Islamic finance market is &quot;awash&quot; with &quot;profit rate swap&quot; contracts, including a global standard developed by the IIFM and International Swaps and Derivatives Association. In Malaysia, the &quot;Islamic Profit Rate Swap&quot; (IPRS) hedging tool is popular.
*cross-currency swap: These are used by investors to &quot;transfer currency fluctuation risk among themselves.&quot;

=====Put and call options=====
The Islamic finance equivalent of a conventional call option is known as an &quot;urbun&quot; (lit. &quot;down payment&quot;), the equivalent of a put option is known as a &quot;reverse &quot;urbun&quot;&quot;. In each the seller has the right but not the obligation to either buy (in the case of a call or &quot;urbun&quot;) or sell (in the case of a put or &quot;reverse &quot;urbun&quot;&quot;) at a pre-determined price by some point in the future. These two Islamic options also have a different name for a &quot;premium&quot;, (called a &quot;down-payment&quot;) and for the &quot;strike price&quot; (&quot;preset price&quot;). The options&#x27; Islamic distinctiveness has been questioned by analysts, and its use has been criticized by conservative scholars.

====Microfinance====
Microfinance seeks to help the poor and spur economic development by providing small loans to entrepreneurs too small and poor to interest non-microfinance banks. Its strategy meshes with the &quot;guiding principles&quot; or objectives of Islamic finance, and with the needs of Muslim-majority countries where a large fraction of the world&#x27;s poor live, many of them small entrepreneurs in need of capital, and most unwilling or unable to use formal financial services.

According to the Islamic Microfinance Network website (as of ), there are more than 300 Islamic microfinance institutions in 32 countries, The products used in Islamic microfinance may include some of those mentioned above – &quot;qard al hassan&quot;, &quot;musharaka&quot;, &quot;mudaraba&quot;, &quot;salam&quot;, and others.

A number of studies have found &quot;very few examples&quot; of microfinance institutions &quot;operating in the field of Islamic finance&quot; and few Islamic banks &quot;involved in microfinance&quot;. 
One 2012 report found that Islamic microfinance made up less than 1 per cent of the global microfinance outreach, &quot;despite the fact that almost half of the clients of microfinance live in Muslim countries and the demand for Islamic microfinance is very strong.&quot;

== Compliance with Islamic goals and sharia ==

These are the emic (from within) issues discussed within the Islamic community for the compliance of Islamic banking and finance with sharia and the desired Islamic objectives.

===Challenges, criticism – industry view===
On the other hand, the industry also has challenges —&quot;key&quot; among them, as of 2016 (according to the &quot;State of the Global Islamic Economy Report&quot;, 2015/16 and the IMF), include:
*&quot;low levels&quot; of public awareness;
*a need for better regulation, better cooperation between Islamic and conventional financial standard-setters to deal with complexity and to &quot;address the unique risks of the industry&quot;;
*a &quot;scarcity of Shariah-compliant monetary policy instruments&quot;;
*&quot;underdeveloped&quot; safety nets and resolution frameworks such as sharia compliant deposit insurance systems and &quot;lenders-of-last-resort&quot;;
*better Shariah compliance by regulators.

Another challenge in Islamic banking has been exploitation of poor gullible people in the name of religion.

===Challenges, criticism – scholars and critics===
Critics have complained of Islamic banking and finance closely resembling the conventional sort but having &quot;higher costs, bigger risks&quot;, – a situation that has not been remedied by &quot;learning&quot; over the decades.
Other issues/complaints include a lack of policies to uplift small traders and the poor; the challenge of inflation, late payments, the lack of hedging of currencies and rates, or of sharia-compliant places to park short term funds for liquidity; the non-Muslim ownership of much of Islamic banking, and the concentration of what ownership is in Muslim hands.

====Hegemony of hand-picked highly paid Shariah experts ====
Some Islamic Banking observers believe the industry suffers from handpicked, highly paid Shariah experts who have been approving financial products using &quot;ḥiyal&quot; (legal stratagem) to follow sharia law, &quot;shunning controversial issues&quot;, and/or &quot;rubber stamping&quot; bank management decisions after perfunctory reviews, and that the banking practices approved by this small number of Islamic jurists have moved closer and closer to the practices of conventional non-Islamic banking.

=====&quot;Fatwa shopping&quot;, independence=====
Journalist John Foster quotes an &quot;investment banker based in Dubai&quot;:
&quot;We create the same type of products that we do for the conventional markets. We then phone up a Sharia scholar for a Fatwa ... If he doesn&#x27;t give it to us, we phone up another scholar, offer him a sum of money for his services and ask him for a Fatwa. We do this until we get Sharia compliance. Then we are free to distribute the product as Islamic.&quot;

According to Foster, this practice of &quot;shopping&quot; for an Islamic scholar who will issue a fatwa testifying that a banking product obeys Shari&#x27;ah law has led to &quot;top scholars&quot; earning &quot;six-figure sums&quot; for each &quot;fatwa&quot;, and to Islamic financing mechanisms that appear to outsiders to be mortgages &quot;dressed up in Arabic terminology&quot;—such as &quot;Mudarabah&quot;, or &quot;Ijarah&quot; (lease agreements).

Mahmoud El-Gamal believes that from the 1970s to the 2000s there has been an evolution of the industry towards &quot;progressively closer approximations&quot; of the practices of conventional banking, approved by &quot;progressively smaller&quot; numbers of jurists (with only a small group for example approving &quot;unsecured lending&quot; to retail and corporate customers through the &quot;tawarruq&quot; mode in the early 2000s). The scarcity of qualified shariah supervisors – who need to be trained in both Islamic commercial law and contemporary financial practices – has been noted. One study found the 20 most popular shariah scholars holding 621 sharia board positions, – creating potential conflicts of interest.

This scarcity also increases fees. Two researchers noted the small group of Shariah experts &quot;earn as much as US$88,5000 per year per bank&quot; and can &quot;charge up to US$500,000 for advice on large capital market transactions.&quot;
Income far in excess of what has been customary for Islamic scholars – luxury air travel and five star hotel – as well as being eagerly asked for their legal opinion by wealthy, high status people, may lead to what one writer (Muhammad O. Farooq) calls a &quot;certain changes in viewpoint&quot; resulting in &quot;over-stretching the rules of Shariah&quot;.

A study of the practice of boards of financial institutions setting the pay and employment of SSB members found this arrangement &quot;compromise(s) the independence of the SSB&quot;.
Another study found Islamic financial institutions do &quot;not have practices which ensure transparency in the role and functions of the SSBs&quot;.

====Imitation of conventional finance====
A number of scholarly supporters (such as Taqi Usmani, D.M. Qureshi, Saleh Abdullah Kamel, Harris Irfan) and skeptics of Islamic banking (Muhammad Akram Khan, Muhammad O. Farooq, Feisal Khan, Mahmoud El-Gama, Timur Kuran) have complained of its similarity to conventional banking.

Taqi Usmani argues that the industry has &quot;totally&quot; neglected the &quot;basic philosophy&quot;, undermining its own &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot;; so that non-Muslims and the Muslim &quot;masses&quot; have now gotten the impression that Islamic banking is &quot;nothing but a matter of twisting documents ...&quot;

This has happened first by the sidelining risk-sharing finance in favor of &quot;murabaha&quot; and other fixed-markup financing of purchases, and further by distorting the rules of that fixed-markup &quot;murabaha&quot; (see also Ignoring required commodities below) to effectively provide conventional cash interest loans with &quot;profit rates&quot; that follow conventional interest rates, the &quot;net result&quot; being &quot;not materially different from interest based transactions&quot;. (Another violation is the use of &quot;ijarah&quot; (leasing) without the &quot;lessor either assuming &quot;the liability for his ownership&quot; or offering &quot;any usufruct to the lessee&quot;.)

In March 2009, Usmani, (as chairman of the board of scholars of the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions, or AAOIFI), declared that 85% of Sukuk, or Islamic bonds, were &quot;un-Islamic&quot;. 
Others (Hassan Heikal) have also criticized the authenticity of sukuk.

*Other pioneers of Islamic banking, have called it &quot;a labeling industry&quot; (D.M. Qureshi),
*or complained that the industry was &quot;busy searching for ways to make it &quot;similar&quot;&quot; to conventional banking, when it should be demonstrating its differences (Mohammad Najatuallah Siddiqui). (a Sharia committee at one bank – Lariba – even issued a fatwa in 1990 stating &quot;no objection to using the term &quot;interest&quot; as an alternative to the term &quot;profit&quot; or &quot;rate of return&quot;.)
*that the industry uses &quot;a whole host ruses and subterfuges to conceal&quot; rather than eliminating interest (Muhammad Akram Khan).
*complain of the industry charges higher fees for financial products that have &quot;all the economic features of that conventional product&quot;Mahmoud Amin El-Gamal, and Mohammad Fadel
*has the same &quot;formulas for SLR (statutory liquidity requirements), capital adequacy ratio, and risk management standards&quot; as those of &quot;interest-based banks&quot; (Sayyid Tahir).
*is the same as conventional banking other than in &quot;the technicalities and legal forms&quot;, keeping interest but calling it &quot;by another name, such as commissions or profits ...`&quot; (A. W. Duskuki and Abdelazeem Abozaid).

=====Explanations=====
Explanations for the similarity between Islamic and conventional banking include: 
*The pressure on Shari&#x27;ah boards (which serve as a sort of modern-day equivalent of the medieval &quot;court ulama&quot;) to approve the products of institutions that pay their salaries (M.O. Farooq).
*The clash between the large demand by pious Muslims for Islamic financial products and practices, and the impracticality/inefficiency of the Islamic products and practices proposed by Islamic finance evangelists, resolved by use of highly paid (but scarce) scholars &quot;willing to certify conventional instruments as being Shariah-compliant&quot;, and the adding of an additional layer of transaction costs on those products (Feisal Khan).
*The lack of training of sharia experts in the deeper meaning of the sharia, and in the long-term economic consequences of the widespread use of complex financial transactions (Farooq quoting Mohammad Nejatullah Siddiqi).
*The motivation of the evangelists of Islamic banking, which is to reassert &quot;the primacy of Islam&quot; rather than advance fundamental &quot;economic change&quot;.

====Social responsibility and emphasis====
Following Islamic principles, &quot;Islamic banks were supposed to adopt new financing policies and to explore new channels of investments&quot; to encourage development and raise the standard of living of &quot;small scale traders&quot;, but Taqi Usmani complains &quot;very few Islamic banks and financial institutions have paid attention to this aspect&quot;. 
Islamic scholar Mohammad Hashim Kamali, laments the focus on short-term financing by Islamic banks. This financing being &quot;largely concerned with the financing of goods already produced, and not with the creation or increase of production capital or with facilities like factories and plants, infrastructure etc.&quot; Islamic bonds, also known as sukuk, have emerged as a new financial instrument to fund ethical transactions such as the project for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation. To support the growth is Islamic financing, governments must establish measures to create a level playing field with regards to liquid secondary markets and equal regulation and taxes that match conventional banking.

Others
*Protest the lack of &quot;a different type of banking which was aligned to fairness, equitable income distribution, and ethical modes of investment&quot; (Muhammad Akram Khan).
*Propose emphasizing &quot;community banking, microfinance, socially responsible investment and the like.&quot; (Mahmoud El-Gamal).
*Challenge the basic premise of Islamic banking, arguing that &quot;greed and profit&quot; are more serious and widespread causes of exploitation than interest on loans, which may not truly constitute forbidden &quot;riba&quot; in a competitive, regulated market (Muhammad O. Farooq).The world in reality is full of exploitation: child exploitation, sexual exploitation, labor exploitation, etc. Interest is probably, if any, a small component in accounting for global exploitation. Yet, the proponents of Islamic economics and finance are fixated with interest.Farooq cites as an example the profit (not interest) motive of the East India Company that colonized and ruled India at the expense of the Muslim Mughal Empire until 1858. He notes that lack of empirical or focused &quot;studies&quot; (as opposed to polemical fulminating) in Islamic economics on the subject of exploitation or injustice.
*Complain that while use of profit and loss sharing by Islamic banks is in decline, in the non-Muslim West venture capital – which operates under the same principals as &quot;darabah&quot;, (minus the prohibition on haram products) – has &quot;financed the global high-tech industry&quot; and could potentially &quot;bring major benefits&quot; to poor Muslims countries seeking economic development (Timur Kuran).

====Profit and loss sharing and its problems====
While profit-loss-sharing modes (or at least &quot;mudarabah&quot;), were originally envisioned as &quot;the basis of a riba-free banking&quot; – with fixed-return financial models only filling in as supplements – a number of studies, (of banks in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, Malaysia, and of large Islamic banks in general) have shown fixed-return products now far exceed profit-loss-sharing (PLS) modes in assets under management.

Explanations (offered by two authors, Humayon A. Dar and J.R. Presley), for why PLS instruments – namely &quot;mudaraba&quot; and &quot;musharaka&quot; financing – have declined to almost negligible proportions include:
# There is an inherent disincentive for the bank&#x27;s client to report profit, because the more it declares, the more of the client&#x27;s money will go to the financing bank, and the less it will get to keep.
# Property rights in most Muslim countries are not properly defined, creating more difficulties for profit-loss sharing financing than for the fixed payment kind.
# The competitors of Islamic banks – conventional banks – are firmly established and have centuries of experience. Islamic banks are not yet sure of their policies and practices and feel restrained in taking unforeseen risks. 
# PLS is not suitable or feasible in many cases such as short-term resource requirement, working capital needs, non-profit-generating projects such as in the education and health sectors.
# Conventional finance has tax advantages over the sharia compliant sort in some countries were interest is considered a business expenditure and given tax exemption, while profit (the return of PLS investment) is taxed as income.
# There were no secondary markets for Islamic financial products based on PLS (at least as of 2001). 
# Mudaraba, one of the forms of PLS, provides limited control rights to shareholders of the bank and &quot;creates an imbalance in the governance structure&quot; of PLS. &quot;Shareholders like to have consistent and complementary control system, which is missing in the case of mudaraba financing.&quot;
# Depositors/investors of banks have proven highly resistant to accepting periodic losses (the L in PLS) that inevitably arise in investment. (The sharing of banking losses with bank customer/investors had been advanced as a reason why Islamic financial institutions would be more stable than conventional banks.) As of at least 2004, no bad debt has translated into losses for depositors in an Islamic bank, and &quot;no Islamic bank has ever written-down the value of its depositor&#x27;s accounts when it has written-down the value of its non-performing assets&quot; for fear of losing depositors.

Aside from disadvantages to lenders, one critic of Islamic banking, Feisal Khan, argues that widespread use of PLS could have severe harm to economies by preventing central banks from expanding credit – buying bonds, commercial paper, etc. – to prevent liquidity crisises that arise from time to time in modern economies.

====Murabaha and ignoring required commodities====
In addition to ignoring profit and loss sharing in favor of &quot;murâbaḥah&quot;, the industry has been accused of not properly following shariah regulations of &quot;murabahah&quot; (mentioned above), by not buying and selling the commodities/inventory that are &quot;a key condition&quot; of shariah-compliance (done when the bank wants to borrow cash rather than to finance a purchase, and though they are an added cost and serve no other function). In 2008 Arabianbusiness.com complained that there are sometimes &quot;no commodities at all, merely cash-flows between banks, brokers and borrowers&quot;. Often the commodity is completely irrelevant to the borrower&#x27;s business and not even enough of the relevant commodities &quot;in existence&quot; in the world &quot;to account for all the transactions taking place&quot;. Two other researchers report that for many years multibillion-dollar &#x27;synthetic&#x27; &quot;murabaha&quot; transactions in London took place, where &quot;many doubt the banks truly assume possession, even constructively, of inventory&quot;.

====Fund mingling====
The original Islamic banking proponents called for &quot;keeping distinct accounts for various types of deposits so that return can be assigned to each type&quot;. &quot;In practice&quot;, according to critic Muhammad Akram Khan, &quot;Islamic financial institutions pool all types of deposits&quot;.

==== Falsification ====
Critics complain that the compliance with sharia regulations by banks often is nothing more than the taking of the word of the bank or borrower that they have followed compliance rules, with no effective auditing to see if this is true. One observer (L. Al Nasser) complains that &quot;Shariah authorities demonstrate excessive confidence in their subjects when it comes to dealing with parities in the industry&quot;, and Shariah audits are needed &quot;to bring about transparency and ensure&quot; that the institutions &quot;deliver what they have committed to their customers&quot;. Furthermore, when external Shariah audits are carried out, &quot;many of these auditors frequently complain about the amount of violations that they witness and cannot discuss&quot; because the records they have examined &quot;have been tampered with&quot;.

====Following conventional (&quot;haram&quot;) returns====
Although Islamic banking forbids interest, its &quot;profit rates&quot; often are benchmarked to interest rates. Islamic banker Harris Irfan states &quot;there is no question&quot; that benchmarks such as LIBOR &quot;continue to be a necessary metric&quot; for Islamic banks, and that the &quot;overwhelming majority of scholars have come to accept this, however imperfect a solution this may seem&quot;, but Muhammad Akram Khan writes that following the conventional banking benchmark LIBOR &quot;defeats the very purpose for which the Islamic financial products were designed and offered&quot; in the first place,

In addition skeptics have complained that the rates of return on accounts in Islamic banks are suspiciously close to those of conventional banks, when (in theory) their different mechanisms should lead to different numbers. A 2014 study in Turkey found the long-term relationship between term-deposit rates at three of four &quot;participation banks&quot; (i.e. Islamic Banks) &quot;significantly cointegrated&quot; with those of the conventional banks.
According to skeptics this nearness suggests a manipulation of returns by Islamic banks, to reassure customers of their financial competitiveness and stability.

====Liquidity====
Islamic banking and finance has lacked a way to earn a return on funds &quot;parked&quot; for the short term, waiting to be invested, which puts those banks a disadvantage to conventional banks.
Banks/financial institutions must balance liquidity – the ability to convert assets into cash or a cash equivalent quickly in an emergency when their depositors need them without
incurring large losses – with a competitive rate of return on funds. Conventional banks are able to borrow and lend by using the interbank lending market – borrowing to meet liquidity requirements and investing for any duration including very short periods, and thereby optimize their earnings. Calculating the return for any period of time is straightforward – multiplying the loans length by the interest rate.

While Muslim countries such as Bahrain, Iran, Malaysia 
and Sudan have started to develop an Islamic money market, and have been &quot;issuing securitized papers on the basis of &quot;musharaka&quot;, &quot;mudaraba&quot; and &quot;ijara&quot;&quot;, at least as of 2013, the &quot;lack of an appropriate and efficient secondary market&quot; has meant the relative volume of these securities is &quot;much smaller&quot; than on the conventional capital market.

Regarding non-PLS, &quot;debt-based contracts&quot;, one study found that &quot;the business model of Islamic banking is changing over the time and moving in a direction where it is acquiring more liquidity risk.&quot;

To deal with the problem of earning no return on funds held for the sake of liquidity or because of a lack of investment opportunity, many Islamic financial institutions (such as Islamic Development Bank and the Faisal Islamic Bank of Egypt) have &quot;been explicitly and openly earning interest on their excess funds, often invested in safer, debt-like or debt instruments overseas&quot;. Rather than forbidding this, &quot;Shariah-experts have provided the necessary fatwa of Shari&#x27;ah-compliance based on the rules of necessities (&quot;darurah&quot;)&quot;.
Scholars in Islamic finance and banking have invoked necessity to permit exceptional relaxations of rules. They have issued fatwas
(opinions) allowing Islamic banks to deposit funds in interest-bearing accounts. though they require the interest be used for &quot;religiously meritorious purposes&quot;.

===Other challenges and issues===
Most Islamic banks have their own Shariah boards ruling on their bank&#x27;s policies.

Management and Islamic banking

Recently, scholars have engaged with questions around leading and managing Islamic banks. This field conceptualizes Islamic banks as hybrid organizations that combine business and religious pursuits with distinct challenges for leadership to bring together diverse beliefs, values, and views.

Behavioural Islamic Finance

Behavioural economists typically argue that stock prices can be substantially influenced by the mood of investors. For instance, researchers have found stocks prices to be positively affected by positive events such as sunshine and upcoming holidays (Kim and Park, 1994). Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam, which is the religious practice of fasting from dawn to sunset during the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. Several studies, such as (Białkowski et al. (2012), Al-Hajieh et al. (2011) and Al-Khazali (2014), have found stocks in Muslim countries to yield higher returns during Ramadan compared to the rest of the year. Their results were explained by the fact that Ramadan encourages Muslims optimism which has a positive effect on stock price.

====Lack of Sharia uniformity====
The four schools (&quot;Madhhab&quot;) of Sunni fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) apply &quot;Islamic teachings to business and finance in different ways&quot;, and have not come closer to agreement. Furthermore, shari&#x27;a boards sometimes change their minds, reversing earlier decisions.&quot;

Differences between boards as to what constitutes Sharia-compliance may raise &quot;doubts in the minds of clients&quot; over whether a given bank is truly Sharia-compliant, and should be given their business.

====Late payments/defaults====
While in conventional finance late payments/delinquent loans are discouraged by interest continuing to accumulate, according to Ibrahim Warde, 
Islamic banks face a serious problem with late payments, not to speak of outright defaults, since some people take advantage of every dilatory legal and religious device ... In most Islamic countries, various forms of penalties and late fees have been established, only to be outlawed or considered unenforceable. Late fees in particular have been assimilated to riba. As a result, &#x27;debtors know that they can pay Islamic banks last since doing so involves no cost&#x27; 
A number of suggestions have been made to deal with the problem.

====Inflation====
Inflation is also a problem for financing where Islamic banks have not imitated conventional banking and are truly lending without interest or any other charges. Whether and how to compensate lenders for the erosion of the value of the funds from inflation, has also been called a problem &quot;vexing&quot; Islamic scholars, since finance for businesses will not be forthcoming if a lender loses money by lending. Suggestions include indexing loans (opposed by many scholars as a type of &quot;riba&quot; and encouraging inflation), denominating loans &quot;in terms of a commodity&quot; such as gold, and further research to find an answer.

====Non-Muslim influence====
Islamic banking and finance customers, are almost all, if not entirely, Muslims. But the majority of financial institutions that offer Islamic banking services are Western financial institutions, not owned by Muslims. Supporters of Islamic banking have cited this interest of western banks in Islamic banking as evidence of the strong demand for Islamic banking and thus an &quot;achievement of the movement&quot;.

However, critics complain these banks lack a deep faith-based commitment to Islamic banking which means 
#That Muslims employed within these organizations have little input into the actual management, resulting in sometimes well-founded suspicion among the Muslim populace as to the diligence of sharia compliance at these institutions. 
#That rather than a reflection of the growing strength of Islamic banking, the interest of conventional banks reflects how similar Islamic banking has become to the conventional sort, so that the later can enter Islamic banking without making substantive changes to its practices.
#And that these banks will be more likely to withdrawing from the industry when the market takes a downturn. Harris Irfan argues that the lack of ideological commitment to Islamic banking by non-Muslim banks such as Deutsche Bank, will lead to their withdrawing from the industry when the market takes a downturn. In early 2011 during the housing bubble collapse, &quot;not a single dedicated Islamic structurer or salesperson remained at Deutsche. Islamic finance had become &#x27;a luxury the bank can&#x27;t afford&#x27;&quot;

====Stability/risk====
Sources differ over whether Islamic banking is more stable and less risky than conventional banking.

Proponents (such as Zeti Akhtar Aziz, the head of the central bank of Malaysia) have argued that Islamic financial institutions are more stable than conventional banks because they forbid speculation and the two main types (in theory) of Islamic banking accounts – &quot;current account&quot; and &quot;mudarabah&quot; accounts – carry less risk to the bank.
#In a current account the customer earns no return and (in theory) there is no risk of loss because the bank does not invest the account funds. 
#In a &quot;mudarabah&quot; account the Islamic bank carries less risk of loan defaults because it shares that risk with the depositor since if the borrower cannot pay back part or all of the money lent to them by the bank, the amount going to the depositor is cut by an equivalent amount, whereas in a conventional bank the depositor is given fixed interest payments whether or not the bank&#x27;s earnings decline from loan defaults.

This of course means that while the bank may be more stable, the depositors/&quot;partners&quot; of Islamic profit and loss sharing accounts (Islamic banks often use the term &quot;partner&quot; instead of &quot;customer&quot; or &quot;depositor&quot;) are exposed to risks they would not be subject to in conventional banks.
Furthermore, 
In these institutions, investment-account holders neither have the protection of being creditors of the Islamic financial institution, nor do they have the protection of being equity holders with representation on those institutions&#x27; boards of directors. This introduces a host of other well-documented risk factors for the institution ...

On the other hand, Habib Ahmed —writing in 2009 shortly after the financial crisis – argues that the practices of Islamic finance have gradually moved closer to conventional finance exposing them to the same dangers of instability.
When the practice of Islamic finance and the environment under which it operates are examined, one can identify trends that are similar to the ones that caused the current crisis... In the recent past, the Gulf region has witnessed its own episodes of speculation in their stock and real estate markets. Finally, the Islamic financial industry has witnessed rapid growth with innovations of complex &quot;Shari&#x27;ah&quot; compliant financial products. Risks in these new Islamic financial products are complex, as the instruments have multiple types of risks ...

In any event, a few Islamic banks have failed over the decades. In 1988 the Islamic investment house, Ar-Ryan collapsed causing thousands of small investors to lose their savings (they were later reimbursed for their losses by an anonymous Gulf state donor) and dealing a blow to Islamic finance at the time. 
In 1998 the management of Bank al Taqwa&#x27;s failed. with its annual report reporting a &quot;loss of over 23 per cent of principal to both mudaraba depositors and shareholders&quot;. (It was later revealed that management had violated banking rules &quot;invested in one single project more than 60 per cent bank&#x27;s assets.&quot;)

The Ihlas Finance House in Turkey closed in 2001 due to &quot;liquidity problems and financial distress&quot;. Faisal Islamic Bank had difficulties and closed its operations in the UK for regulatory reasons.
According to the Economist magazine, &quot;Dubai&#x27;s debt crisis in 2009 showed that &quot;sukuk&quot; [Islamic bonds] can help to inflate debt to unsustainable levels.&quot;

=====Recessions=====
During the Great Recession, Islamic banks &quot;on average, showed stronger resilience&quot; than conventional banks, but &quot;faced larger losses&quot; when the crisis hit &quot;the real economy,&quot; according to a 2010 IMF survey.

At the beginning of the Great Recession, Islamic banks were &quot;unscathed&quot;, leading to one Islamic banking supporter to write that the collapse of leading Wall Street institutions, particularly Lehman Brothers, &quot;should encourage economists world-wide to focus on Islamic banking and finance as an alternative model.&quot; However gradually the effect of the financial downturn moved to the real sector, affecting Islamic banking. According to Ibrahim Warde, &#x27;this showed that Islamic finance was not all a panaceas, and that a faith-based system is not automatically immune to the vagaries of the Financial system.&#x27;

=====Concentration of ownership=====
Concentrated ownership is another danger to the stability of Islamic banking and finance. Munawar Iqbal and Philip Molyneux write that only 
&quot;three or four families own a large percentage of the industry. ... This concentration of ownership could result in substantial financial instability and possible collapse of the industry if anything happens to those families, or the next generation of these families change their priorities. Similarly, the experience of country-wide experiments has also been mostly on the initiatives of rulers not elected through popular votes.&quot;

=====Macroeconomic exposures=====
Harris Irafan warns that the &quot;macroeconomic exposures&quot; of Islamic banks constitute a &quot;ticking time bomb&quot; of a &quot;billions of dollars&quot; in &quot;unhedged currencies and rates&quot;. The difficulty, complexity and expense of hedging these in the correct Islamic manner is such that as of 2015, the Islamic Development Bank &quot;was hemorrhaging cash as if it were funding a war. It simply couldn&#x27;t swap dollars for euros or vice versa on an ongoing basis without resorting to the conventional markets.&quot; Regional Islamic banks in the Middle East and Malaysia did not have &quot;specialized personnel trained to understand and negotiate Sharia-compliant treasury swaps&quot; and were not willing to hire the consultants who did.

====Customers and the industry====
The majority of Islamic banking clients are found in the Gulf states and in developed countries.
Studies of Islamic banking customer in Malaysia and Pakistan found customer satisfaction was connected to service quality. 
A study of Islamic banking customers in Bangladesh found &quot;most customers&quot; between 25 and 35 years, &quot;highly educated&quot; and having a &quot;durable relationship&quot; with the bank, more knowledgeable about account than financing products.

In series of interviews conducted in 2008 and 2010 with Pakistani banking professionals (conventional and Islamic bankers, Shariah banking advisors, finance-using businessmen, and management consultants), economist Feisal Khan noted many Islamic bankers expressed &quot;cynicism&quot; over the difference or lack thereof between conventional and Islamic bank products, the lack of requirements for external Shariah-compliance audits of Islamic banks in Pakistan, shariah boards lack of awareness of their banks&#x27; failure to follow shariah compliant practices in or their power to stop these practices. However this did not deter patronage of the banks by the pious (one of whom explained that if his Islamic bank was not truly shariah compliant, &#x27;The sin is on their head now, not on mine! What I could do, I&#x27;ve done.&#x27;)

The Bank of London and the Middle East (BLME) have majority non-Muslim customers that receive a fixed percentage of profits, rather than an interest rate. However, critics say that sharia deposits and products are too similar to interest-rate related products, in contrast to the share of profits earned. Other explanations for the rise of non-Muslim customers in Islamic banking have been pointed towards ethical reasons in negative screening of investments like tobacco, alcohol, and arms.

One estimate of customer preference (given by a Pakistani banker) in the Pakistani banking industry, was that about 10% of customers were &quot;strictly conventional banking clients&quot;, 20% were strictly Shariah-compliant banking clients, and 70% would prefer Shariah-compliant banking but would use conventional banking if &quot;there was a significant pricing difference&quot;. A survey of Islamic and conventional banking customers found (unsurprisingly) Islamic banking customers were more observant (having attended hajj, observing salat, growing a beard, etc.), but also had higher savings account balances than conventional bank customers, were older, better educated, had traveled more overseas, and tended to have a second account at a conventional bank. Another study, using &quot;official data&quot; reported to State Bank of Pakistan, found that for lenders who had taken out both Islamic (Murabaha) financing and conventional loans, the default rate was more than twice as high on the conventional loans. Borrowers were &quot;less likely to default during Ramadan and in big cities if the share of votes to religious-political parties increases, suggesting that religion – either through individual piousness or network effects – may play a role in determining loan default.&quot;

====Costs====
Muhammad El-Gamal argues that because Islamic financial products imitate conventional financial products but operate in accordance with the rules of shariah, different products will require additional jurist and lawyer fees, &quot;multiple sales, special-purpose vehicles, and documentations of title&quot;. In addition there will be costs associated with &quot;the peculiar structure that Islamic banks use for late payment penalties&quot;. Consequently, their financing tends to cost more than, and/or accounts pay less return than conventional products.
El-Gama also argues that another source of inefficiency/greater expense in Islamic banking and a reason its replications of conventional finance are &quot;always one step behind&quot; new financial products in the conventional industry, is the industry&#x27;s dependence on &quot;classical &quot;nominate contracts&quot; (&quot;murabahah&quot; credit sales, &quot;ijara&quot; leases, etc.). These contracts follow classical texts and were created in a time when financial markets were very limited. They are not equipped to &quot;disentangle various risks&quot; that &quot;modern&quot; financial markets and institutions (such as &quot;money markets, capital markets, options markets, etc.&quot;) are so designed. On the other hand, making their contracts/products more efficient, will alienate the pious customer base that wants contracts/products to follow classical forms.

Most studies have found Islamic banks less efficient on average, than conventional ones.
*According to a 2006 report by M. Kabir Hassan of 43 bank in 21 Muslim countries from 1996 to 2001, &quot;on average, the Islamic banking industry is relatively less efficient compared to their conventional counterparts in other parts of the world&quot;;
*a study of banks in Malaysia from 1997 to 2003 found Islamic banks somewhat less efficient, on average, than their conventional counterparts, as did a study of
*Islamic banks in Turkey from 1999 to 2001.
*In contrast one multi-country study (43 Islamic and 37 conventional banks in 21 countries), covering a similar time period (1999–2005) as the studies above, found no &quot;significant differences&quot; in overall efficiency.

In one important part of the finance market – home buying – Islamic finance has not been able to compete with conventional finance in at least some countries (the UK as of 2002, and the US and Canada as of 2009). According to Humayon Dar, the monthly payments, for a shariah compliant &quot;Lease Contract&quot; used by Islamic Investment Banking Unit of Ahli United Bank Kuwait in Britain &quot;are much higher&quot; than equivalent conventional mortgages. 
In Canada the cost of Islamic home finance was 100 to 300 basis points higher than conventional home finance, and in the U.S. 40 to 100 basis points higher, according to Hans Visser. (Visser credits the higher cost of Islamic &quot;ijara&quot; financing to its higher risk weighting compared to conventional mortgages under Basel I and Basel II international standard of minimum capital requirements for banks.)

====Maturity====
According to M. O. Farooq, &quot;common explanations offered by&quot; the Islamic finance movement for the Islamic banking industry shortcomings are that 
#industry problems and challenges are part of a &quot;learning curve&quot; and will be solved over time; 
#unless and until the industry operates in an Islamic society and environment it will be hindered by non-Islamic influences and won&#x27;t &quot;operate in its essence&quot;.

While the veracity of the second explanation can not be verified before a complete Islamic society is established, Feisal Khan points in regard to the first defense that it has been over twenty years (1993) since one critic (Timur Kuran) first highlighted the industry problems (the basic similarity of Islamic banking in practice to the conventional, the marginalizing of the equity-based, risk-sharing modes and embrace of short-term products and debt-like instruments), and since a supporter (Ausaf Ahmad) defended the industry as early in its transition from conventional banking.

Seventeen years later, Ibrahim Warde, an Islamic finance proponent, lamented that &quot;rather than disappearing, murabaha and comparable sale-based products grew significantly and today they constitute the bulk of the activity of most Islamic Banks...&quot;

Most critics of the Islamic banking industry call for further orthodoxy and a redoubling of effort and stricter enforcement of sharia. Some (M. O. Farooq and M. A. Khan), have blamed the industry problems on its condemnation of any and all interest on loans as forbidden &quot;riba&quot;, and the impracticality of attempting to enforce this prohibition.

====Lack of conformance with Islamic financial principles====

Critic Feisal Khan argues that in many ways Islamic finance has not lived up to its defining characteristics. Risk-sharing is lacking because profit and loss sharing modes are so infrequently used. Underlying material transactions are also missing in such transactions as &quot;&quot;tawarruq&quot;, commodity &quot;murabahas&quot;, Malaysian Islamic private debt securities, and Islamic short-sales&quot;. Exploitation is involved when high fees are charged for &quot;doing nothing more substantial than mimicking conventional banking /finance products&quot;. Haram activities are not avoided when banks (following the customary practice) simply take the word of clients/financees/borrowers that they will not use funds for un-Islamic activities.

==Etic (from outside) and universal issues ==

===Lack of compliance with global standards ===
International Monetary Fund (IMF) has highlighted the risk of Islamic banking and finance&#x27;s lack of common understanding of money laundering (ML) and terrorism financing (TF) and resultant noncompliance such as with Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) recommendations. Some of these ML/TF risks related to Islamic finance are similar to conventional financing, but there are unknown and large number of unknown risks and issues. These risks are caused by the complexity of Islamic finance products as well as the nature of the relationship between the Islamic banks and stakeholders. Since there is limited experience and capability within Islamic banking and finance system for the risk mitigation and compliance with the global ML/TF standards, the risks are magnified. These risks become critical in case of vulnerable, non-compliant or rogue nations and organisations. &quot;The FATF standards are implemented without any form of tailoring to the specificities of Islamic finance. The FATF, the Islamic finance standard-setters, and the national regulators should seek a greater understanding of the specific ML/TF risks that may arise in Islamic finance and develop an appropriate response.&quot;

===Terrorism financing ===

According to Alex P. Schmid writing in 2004, a network of Islamic banks has &quot;proved to be an ideal instrument for money manipulation&quot; to channel funds to terrorist organizations. One reason being that the banks are used for zakat donations and &quot;the code of practice of Islamic banks requires the destruction of all documents as soon as the zakat money transfer has taken place.&quot; Thus, zakat charitable donations may end up financing &quot;the purchase of arms and the sponsorship of terror attacks&quot;, as well as food for the needy, and educational and job training programs.

<doc id="146741" wikidata="Q1459615" url="?curid=146741" title="Stomp 442">
<text>Stomp 442 is the seventh studio album by American heavy metal band Anthrax. It was released in 1995 by Elektra Records. The band and the Philadelphia-based producers Butcher Brothers produced the album, which includes the singles, &quot;Fueled&quot; and &quot;Nothing&quot;. The album debuted at No. 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts. The album is their last to be released by Elektra Records, as they left the label after claiming that they didn&#x27;t do enough to promote the album.

&quot;Stomp 442&quot; is also Anthrax&#x27;s first album without Dan Spitz on lead guitar. Though not credited as a member of the band, Paul Crook took over lead guitar duties.

==Critical reception==

AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album a negative review, describing it as &quot;a generic collection of speed metal bombast&quot;. He finished his review by saying that the record is a &quot;disheartening experience.&quot; Reviewer Jimmy Neeson had a more positive view, noting, &quot;A savage Anthrax album; and a worthy addition to any metal collection.&quot; Canadian journalist Martin Popoff described &quot;Stomp 442&quot; as &quot;a fine, responsible collection of working man&#x27;s metal, if a bit of a repetition&quot; compared to &quot;the relatively unappreciated &quot;Sound of White Noise&quot;&quot; of 1993.

==Cover art==
The album&#x27;s cover gained controversy when retailer Walmart refused to stock it in its stores, because of the naked man standing next to the giant ball of garbage.

In a 1996 interview with Tom Russell of Glasgow-based radio Clyde 1, Bruce Dickinson revealed that the original design for the cover art was done for his album &quot;Balls to Picasso&quot; – originally to be titled &quot;Laughing in the Hiding Bush&quot; – but he couldn&#x27;t afford it. His album&#x27;s title was changed and he drew two squares on a toilet wall for the cover.

<text>The Ho Chi Minh Trail (), also called Annamite Range Trail () was a logistical network of roads and trails that ran from North Vietnam to South Vietnam through the kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia. The system provided support, in the form of manpower and materiel, to the Viet Cong (or &quot;VC&quot;) and the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN), during the Vietnam War. Construction for the network began following the North Vietnamese invasion of Laos in July 1959. At the time it was believed to be the main supply route, however it later transpired that the Sihanouk Trail which ran through Cambodia was handling significantly more material.

It was named by the U.S. after the North Vietnamese leader Hồ Chí Minh. The origin of the name is presumed to have come from the First Indochina War, when there was a Viet Minh maritime logistics line called the &quot;Route of Ho Chi Minh&quot;, and shortly after late 1960, as the present trail developed, Agence France-Presse (AFP) announced that a north–south trail had opened, and they named the corridor &quot;La Piste de Hồ Chí Minh&quot;, the &#x27;Hồ Chí Minh Trail&#x27;. The trail ran mostly in Laos, and was called the Trường Sơn Strategic Supply Route (Đường Trường Sơn) by the communists, after the Vietnamese name for the Annamite Range, a major mountain range of central Vietnam. They further identified the trail as either West Trường Sơn (Laos) or East Trường Sơn (Vietnam). According to the U.S. National Security Agency&#x27;s official history of the war, the trail system was &quot;one of the great achievements of military engineering of the 20th century&quot;. The trail was able to effectively supply troops fighting in the south, an unparalleled military feat, given it was the site of the single most intense air interdiction campaign in history.

==Origins (1959–1965)==
Parts of what became the trail had existed for centuries as primitive footpaths that enabled trade. The area through which the system meandered was among the most challenging in Southeast Asia: a sparsely populated region of rugged mountains in elevation, triple-canopy jungle and dense tropical rainforests. Pre-First Indochina War, the routes were known as the &quot;Southward March&quot;, &quot;Eastward March&quot;, &quot;Westward March&quot;, and &quot;Northward March&quot;. During the First Indochina War the Việt Minh maintained north–south communications and logistics by expanding on this system of trails and paths, and called the routes the &quot;Trans-West Supply Line&quot; (running in south Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand) and the &quot;Trans-Indochina Link&quot; (running in north Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand).
In May 1958 PAVN and Pathet Lao forces seized the transportation hub at Tchepone, on Laotian Route 9. Laotian elections in May brought a right-wing government to power in Laos, increasing dependence on U.S. military and economic aid and an increasingly antagonistic attitude toward North Vietnam.

PAVN forces, alongside the Pathet Lao, invaded Laos on 28 July 1959, with fighting all along the border with North Vietnam against the Royal Lao Army (RLA). In September 1959, Hanoi established the 559th Transportation Group, headquartered at Na Kai, Houaphan province in northeast Laos close to the border. It was under the command of Colonel (later General) Võ Bẩm and established to improve and maintain a transportation system to supply the VC insurgency against the South Vietnamese government. Initially, the North Vietnamese effort concentrated on infiltration across and immediately below the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separated the two Vietnams. The 559th Group &quot;flipped&quot; its line of communications to the west side of the Trường Sơn mountains.

By 1959, the 559th had 6,000 personnel in two regiments alone, the 70th and 71st, not including combat troops in security roles or North Vietnamese and Laotian civilian laborers. In the early days of the conflict the trail was used strictly for the infiltration of manpower. At the time, Hanoi could supply its southern allies much more efficiently by sea. In 1959 the North Vietnamese created Transportation Group 759, which was equipped with 20 steel-hulled vessels to carry out such infiltration.

After the initiation of U.S. naval interdiction efforts in coastal waters, known as Operation Market Time, the trail had to do double duty. Materiel sent from the north was stored in caches in the border regions that were soon retitled &quot;Base Areas&quot; (BA), which, in turn, became sanctuaries for VC and PAVN forces seeking respite and resupply after conducting operations in South Vietnam.

=== Base areas ===
There were five large base areas in the panhandle of Laos (see map). BA 604 was the main logistical center during the war. From there, the coordination and distribution of men and supplies into South Vietnam&#x27;s Military Region (MR) I and BAs further south was accomplished.

* BA 611 facilitated transport from BA 604 to BA 609. Supply convoys moved in both directions. It also fed fuel and ammunition to BA 607 and on into South Vietnam&#x27;s A Shau Valley.
* BA 612 was used for support of the B-3 Front in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam.
* BA 614, between Savannakhet, Laos and Kham Duc, South Vietnam was used primarily for moving men and materiel into MR 2 and to the B-3 Front.
* BA 609 was important due to a fine road network that made it possible to transport supplies during the rainy season.

Human labour, pushing heavily laden bicycles, driving oxcarts, or acting as human pack animals, moving hundreds of tonnes of supplies in this fashion was quickly supplanted by truck transport—using Soviet, Chinese, or Eastern Bloc models—which quickly became the chief means of moving supplies and troops. As early as December 1961, the 3rd Truck Transportation Group of PAVN&#x27;s General Rear Services Department had become the first motor transport unit fielded by North Vietnamese to work the trail and the use of motor transport escalated.

Two types of units served under the 559th Group: &quot;Binh Trams&quot; (BT) and commo-liaison units. A &quot;Binh Tram&quot; was the equivalent of a regimental logistical headquarters and was responsible for securing a particular section of the network. While separate units were tasked with security, engineering, and communications functions, a &quot;Binh Tram&quot; provided the logistical necessities. Usually located one day&#x27;s march from one another, communication-liaison units were responsible for providing food, housing, medical care and guides to the next way-station. By April 1965, command of the 559th Group devolved upon General Phan Trọng Tuệ, who assumed command of 24,000 men in six truck transportation battalions, two bicycle transportation battalions, a boat transportation battalion, eight engineer battalions, and 45 commo-liaison stations. The motto of the 559th became &quot;Build roads to advance, fight the enemy to travel.&quot;

There were nine Binh Trams between the dry season of 1967 to August 1968. An example is Binh Tram 31: 

The system developed into an intricate maze of dirt roads (paved with gravel and corduroyed in some areas), foot and bicycle paths and truck parks. There were numerous supply bunkers, storage areas, barracks, hospitals, and command and control facilities, all concealed from aerial observation by an intricate system of natural and man-made camouflage that was constantly improved. By 1973, trucks could drive the entire length of the trail without emerging from the canopy except to ford streams or cross them on crude bridges built beneath the water&#x27;s surface.

The weather in southeastern Laos came to play a large role both in the supply effort and in U.S. and South Vietnamese efforts to interdict it. The southwest monsoon (commonly called the rainy season) from mid-May to mid-September, brought heavy precipitation (70% of per year). The sky was usually overcast with high temperatures. The northwest monsoon (the dry season), from mid-October to mid-March was relatively dry with lower temperatures. Since the road network in the trail system was generally dirt, the bulk of supply transport, and the military efforts that they supported, were conducted during the dry season. Eventually, the bulk of the trail was either asphalted or hard packed, thus allowing large quantities of supplies to be moved even during the rainy season.

==Interdiction and expansion (1965–1968)==
In 1961 U.S. intelligence analysts estimated that 5,843 enemy infiltrators (actually 4,000) had moved south on the trail; in 1962, 12,675 (actually 5,300); in 1963, 7,693 (actually 4,700); and in 1964, 12,424. The supply capacity of the trail reached 20 to 30 tonnes per day in 1964 and it was estimated by the U.S. that 12,000 (actually 9,000) PAVN soldiers had reached South Vietnam that year. By 1965 the U.S. command in Saigon estimated that communist supply requirements for their southern forces amounted to 234 tons of all supplies per day and that 195 tons were moving through Laos.

U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) analysts concluded that during the 1965 Laotian dry season the enemy was moving 30 trucks per day (90 tonnes) over the trail, far above the Saigon estimate.

U.S. officials had only estimates of its enemy&#x27;s capabilities; intelligence collection agencies often conflicted with each other. Thanks to improvements to the trail system (including opening new routes that would connect to the Sihanouk Trail in Cambodia), the quantity of supplies transported during 1965 almost equaled the combined total for the previous five years. During the year interdiction of the system had become one of the top American priorities, but operations against it were complicated by the limited forces available at the time and Laos&#x27;s ostensible neutrality.

The intricacies of Laotian affairs, and U.S. and North Vietnamese interference in them, led to a mutual policy of each ignoring the other, at least in the public eye. This did not prevent the North Vietnamese from violating Lao neutrality by protecting and expanding their supply conduit, and by supporting their Pathet Lao allies in their war against the central government. U.S. intervention came in the form of building and supporting a CIA-backed clandestine army in its fight with the communists and constant bombing of the trail. They also provided support for the Lao government.

=== Air operations against the trail ===
On 14 December 1964, the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s (USAF) &quot;Operation Barrel Roll&quot; carried out the first systematic bombardment of the Hồ Chí Minh Trail in Laos. On 20 March 1965, after the initiation of Operation Rolling Thunder against North Vietnam, President Lyndon B. Johnson approved a corresponding escalation against the trail system. &quot;Barrel Roll&quot; continued in northeastern Laos while the southern panhandle was bombed in &quot;Operation Steel Tiger&quot;.

By mid-year the number of sorties being flown had grown from 20 to 1,000 per month. In January 1965, the U.S. command in Saigon requested control over bombing operations in the areas of Laos adjacent to South Vietnam&#x27;s five northernmost provinces, claiming that the area was part of the &quot;extended battlefield&quot;. The request was granted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The area fell under the auspices of &quot;Operation Tiger Hound&quot;.

Political considerations complicated aerial operations. But the seasonal monsoons that hindered communist supply operations in Laos also hampered the interdiction effort. These efforts were hindered by morning fog and overcast, and by the smoke and haze produced by the slash-and-burn agriculture practiced by the indigenous population. During 1968 the USAF undertook two experimental operations that it hoped would worsen the monsoons. &quot;Project Popeye&quot; was an attempt to indefinitely extend the rainy season over southeastern Laos by cloud seeding. Testing on the project began in September above the Kong River watershed that ran through the Steel Tiger and Tiger Hound areas. Clouds were seeded by air with silver iodide smoke and then activated by launching a fuse fired from a flare pistol. Fifty-six tests were conducted by October; 85% were judged to be successful. President Johnson then gave authorization for the program, which lasted until July 1972.

Testing on the second operation, &quot;Project Commando Lava&quot;, began on 17 May: scientists from Dow Chemical had created a chemical concoction that, when mixed with rainwater, destabilized the soil and created mud. The program drew enthusiasm from its military and civilian participants, who claimed that they were there to &quot;make mud, not war.&quot; In some areas it worked, depending on the makeup of the soil. The chemicals were dropped by C-130A aircraft, but the overall effect on North Vietnamese interdiction was minimal and the experiment was cancelled.

====Defoliation====
In December 1965 the USAF began its first Operation Ranch Hand defoliation missions against the trail in Laos using both Agent Blue and Agent Orange defoliants. More than 210
missions took place, spraying approximately 1.8 million litres of defoliants. Unlike Laos, the trail in Cambodia was not systematically targeted for defoliation, although more than ten missions were mounted against the Parrot&#x27;s Beak area, spraying approximately 155,000 litres of Agent Orange.

=== Ground operations against the trail ===

On the ground, the CIA and the RLA had initially been given the responsibility of stopping, slowing, or, at the very least, observing the enemy&#x27;s infiltration effort. In Laos, the agency began Operation Pincushion in 1962 to accomplish that goal. The operation evolved into Operation Hardnose, in which CIA-backed Laotian irregular reconnaissance team operations took place.

In October 1965, General Westmoreland received authorization to launch a U.S. cross-border recon effort. On 18 October 1965, the first mission was launched &quot;across the fence&quot; into Laos by the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (MACV-SOG). This was the beginning of an ever-expanding reconnaissance effort by MACV-SOG that would continue until the operation was disbanded in 1972. Another weapon in the U.S. arsenal was unleashed upon the trail on 10 December 1965, when the first B-52 Stratofortress bomber strike was conducted in Laos.

A common historical perspective supports the efficacy of the campaigns (despite their failure to halt or slow infiltration), as they did restrict enemy materiel and manpower in Laos and Cambodia. This viewpoint pervaded some official U.S. government histories of the conflict. John Schlight said of the PAVN&#x27;s logistical apparatus, &quot;This sustained effort, requiring the full-time activities of tens of thousands of soldiers, who might otherwise have been fighting in South Vietnam, seems proof positive that the bombing of the Ho Chi Minh Trail had disrupted the North Vietnamese war effort.&quot;

Despite U.S. anti-infiltration efforts, the estimated number of PAVN infiltrators for 1966 was between 58,000 and 90,000 troops, including five full enemy regiments. A June 1966 DIA estimate credited the North Vietnamese with of passable roads within the corridor, at least of which were good enough for year-round use. In 1967 Senior Colonel (later General) Đồng Sỹ Nguyên assumed command of the 559th Group. In comparison to the above DIA estimate, by the end of the year the North Vietnamese had completed 2,959 km of vehicle capable roads, including 275 kilometers of main roads, 576 kilometers of bypasses, and 450 entry roads and storage areas.

It was learned by U.S. intelligence that the enemy was using the Kong and Bang Fai Rivers to transport food, fuel, and munitions shipments by loading materiel into half-filled steel drums and then launching them into the rivers. They were later collected downstream by nets and booms. Unknown to the U.S., the North Vietnamese had also begun to transport and store more than 81,000 tonnes of supplies &quot;to be utilized in a future offensive&quot;. That future offensive was launched during the lunar new year Tết holiday of 1968, and to prepare for it, 200,000 PAVN troops, including seven infantry regiments and 20 independent battalions, made the trip south.

Throughout the war, ground operations by conventional units were somewhat limited to brief incursions into border sanctuaries. One notable operation was Dewey Canyon which took place from 22 January to 18 March 1969 in I Corps. During the operation, the 9th Marine Regiment attempted to interdict PAVN activity in the Da Krong River and A Shau Valleys. Ground units briefly entered the border areas of Laos during fighting with elements of the PAVN 9th Regiment.

==Operation Commando Hunt (1968–1970)==


In the wake of the Tet Offensive, the North Vietnamese expanded and modernized their logistical effort. The number of supply and maintenance personnel dropped, mainly due to increased use of motor and river transport and mechanized construction equipment. The CIA estimated during the year that the 559th Group was using 20 bulldozers, 11 road graders, three rock crushers, and two steamrollers for maintenance and new road construction.

As many as 43,000 North Vietnamese or Laotians were engaged in operating, improving, or extending the system. In 1969, 433,000 tonnes of ordnance fell on Laos. This was made possible by the end of &quot;Operation Rolling Thunder&quot; and the commencement of &quot;Operation Commando Hunt&quot; in November 1968. U.S. aircraft were freed for interdiction missions and as many as 500 per day were flying over Laos. By the end of 1968, bombing missions over southern Laos had climbed 300 percent, from 4,700 sorties in October to 12,800 in November.

This round-the-clock aerial effort was directed by &quot;Operation Igloo White&quot;, run out of Nakhon Phanom, Thailand. It was composed of three parts: strings of air-dropped acoustic and seismic sensors collected intelligence on the trail; computers at the Intelligence Collection Center (ICS) in Thailand collated the information and predicted convoy paths and speeds; and an airborne relay and control aircraft which received the signals from the sensors and routed aircraft to targets as directed by the ICS.

This effort was supported by MACV-SOG recon teams, who, besides carrying out recon, wiretap, and bomb damage assessment missions for &quot;Commando Hunt&quot;, also hand-placed sensors for &quot;Igloo White&quot;. Personnel interdiction was abandoned by early-1969. The sensor system was not sophisticated enough to detect enemy personnel, so the effort was given up until &quot;Operation Island Tree&quot; in late-1971. A revelation for U.S. intelligence analysts in late 1968 was the discovery of a petroleum pipeline running southwest from the northern port of Vinh.

=== Fuel pipeline ===
Initially, fuel was carried by porters, but this was inefficient and time-consuming, and thus highlighted the need to extend the pipeline at a much faster rate. The responsibility to build the pipeline fell to Lieutenant Colonel Phan Tu Quang, who became the first Chief of the Fuel Supply Department, and Major Mai Trong Phuoc, who was the Commander of Road Work Team 18, the secret name for the workers who built the pipeline.

Early in 1969, the pipeline crossed the Lao frontier through the Mu Gia Pass and, by 1970, it reached the approaches to the A Shau Valley in South Vietnam. The plastic pipeline, equipped with numerous small pumping stations, managed to transfer diesel fuel, gasoline, and kerosene all through the same pipe. Due to the efforts of the PAVN 592nd Pipelaying Regiment, the number of pipelines entering Laos increased to six that year.

The 559th Group, still under the command of General Đồng Sỹ Nguyên, was made the equivalent of a Military Region in 1970 and the group was given the additional name, the &quot;Truong Son Army&quot;. It was composed of four units, one division and three equivalent units: the 968th Infantry Division; 470th Group; 565th MAG; and 571st Rear Group. The units controlled fuel pipeline battalions.

In July 1971, the Truong Son Army was reorganized into five divisional headquarters: the 470th, 471st, 472nd, 473rd, and the 571st. The group consisted of four truck transportation regiments, two petroleum pipeline regiments, three anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) regiments, eight engineer regiments, and the 968th Infantry Division. By the end of 1970 the 559th was running 27 &quot;Binh Trams&quot;, which transported 40,000 tonnes of supplies with a 3.4% loss rate during the year.

Colonel Quang and Major Phuoc would eventually build 5,000 km of pipeline and ship over 270,000 tonnes of petrol. Sections of the pipeline were still in use in the 1990s.

=== Truck relay system ===
Trucked supplies traveled in convoys from North Vietnam in relays, with trucks shuttling from one way station to the next. The vehicles were then unloaded and reloaded onto &quot;fresh&quot; trucks at each station. If a truck was disabled or destroyed, it was replaced from the assets of the next northern station and so on until it was replaced by a new one in North Vietnam. Eventually, the last commo-liaison station in Laos or Cambodia was reached and the vehicles were unloaded. The supplies were then cached, loaded onto watercraft, or man-portered into South Vietnam.

Due to the increased effectiveness of &quot;Commando Hunt&quot;, North Vietnamese transportation units usually took to the roads only at dusk with traffic peaking in the early morning hours. As U.S. aircraft came on station, traffic would subside until just before dawn, when fixed-wing gunships and night bombers returned to their bases. The trucks then began rolling again, reaching another peak in traffic around 06:00 as drivers hurried to get into truck parks before sunrise and the arrival of the morning waves of U.S. fighter bombers. By the last phase of &quot;Commando Hunt&quot; (October 1970 – April 1972), the average daily number of U.S. aircraft flying interdiction missions included 182 attack fighters, 13 fixed-wing gunships, and 21 B-52s.

The North Vietnamese also responded to the American aerial threat by the increased use of heavy concentrations of anti-aircraft artillery. By 1968 this was mainly composed of 37 mm and 57 mm radar-controlled weapons. The next year, 85 mm and 100 mm guns appeared, and by the end of &quot;Commando Hunt&quot;, over 1,500 guns defended the system.

Of all the weapons systems used against the trail, according to the official North Vietnamese history of the conflict, the AC-130 Spectre fixed-wing gunship was the most formidable adversary. The Spectres &quot;established control over and successfully suppressed, to a certain extent at least, our nighttime supply operations&quot;. The history claimed that allied aircraft destroyed some 4,000 trucks during the 1970–71 dry season, of which the C-130s alone destroyed 2,432 trucks.

A Spectre countermeasure was unveiled on 29 March 1972, when a Spectre was shot down on a night mission by a surface-to-air SA-7 missile near Tchepone. This was the first U.S. aircraft shot down by a SAM that far south during the conflict. PAVN responded to U.S. nighttime bombing by building the 1,000 kilometer-long Road K (&quot;Green Road&quot;) from north of Lum Bum to lower Laos. During &quot;Commando Hunt IV&quot; (30 April–9 October 1971), U.S., South Vietnamese and Laotian forces began to feel the North Vietnamese reaction to General Lon Nol&#x27;s coup in Cambodia and the subsequent closure of the port of Sihanoukville to its supply shipments. As early as 1969 PAVN had begun its largest logistical effort of the entire conflict.

The Laotian towns of Attapeu and Salavan, at the foot of the Bolaven Plateau were seized by the PAVN during 1970, opening the length of the Kong River system into Cambodia. Hanoi also created the 470th Transportation Group to manage the flow of men and supplies to the new battlefields in Cambodia. This new &quot;Liberation Route&quot; turned west from the trail at Muong May, at the south end of Laos, and paralleled the Kong River into Cambodia. Eventually this new route extended past Siem Prang and reached the Mekong River near Stung Treng.

During 1971 PAVN took Paksong and advanced to Pakse, at the heart of the Bolaven Plateau region of Laos. The following year, Khong Sedone fell to the North Vietnamese. The PAVN continued a campaign to clear the eastern flank of the trail that it had begun in 1968. By 1968, U.S. Special Forces camps at Khe Sanh and Khâm Đức, both of which were used by MACV-SOG as forward operations bases for its reconnaissance effort, had either been abandoned or overrun. In 1970, the same fate befell another camp at Dak Seang. What had once been a supply corridor now stretched for from east to west.

==Road to PAVN victory (1971–1975)==
In early-February 1971, 16,000 (later 20,000) ARVN troops crossed the Laotian border along Route 9 and headed for the PAVN logistical center at Tchepone. &quot;Operation Lam Son 719&quot;, the long-sought assault on the Ho Chi Minh Trail itself and the ultimate test of the U.S. policy of Vietnamization, had begun. Unfortunately for the South Vietnamese, U.S. ground troops were prohibited by law from participation in the incursion, and the U.S. was restricted to providing air support, artillery fire, and helicopter aviation units.

At first the operation went well, with little resistance from the North Vietnamese. By early March 1971 the situation changed. Hanoi made the decision to stand and fight. It began to muster forces which would eventually number 60,000 PAVN troops as well as several thousand allied Pathet Lao troops and Lao irregulars, outnumbering the ARVN by almost three to one.

The fighting in southeastern Laos was unlike any yet seen in the Vietnam War, since the PAVN abandoned its old hit-and-run tactics and launched a conventional counterattack. The PAVN first launched massed infantry attacks supported by armor and heavy artillery to crush ARVN positions on the flanks of the main advance. Coordinated anti-aircraft fire made tactical air support and resupply difficult and costly, with 108 helicopters shot down and 618 others damaged.

PAVN forces began to squeeze in on the main line of the ARVN advance. Although an airborne assault managed to seize Tchepone, it was a useless victory, as the South Vietnamese could only hold the town for a short period before being withdrawn due to attacks on the main column. The only way the invasion force managed to extricate itself from Laos was through the massive application of U.S. air support. By 25 March 1971, the last ARVN troops recrossed the border, closely followed by their enemy. As a test of Vietnamization, &quot;Lam Son 719&quot; failed; half of the invasion force was lost during the operation.

South Vietnamese troops were poorly led and the elite Ranger and Airborne elements had been decimated. &quot;Lam Son 719&quot; did manage to postpone a planned PAVN offensive against the northern provinces of South Vietnam for one year. By spring 1972 the Americans and South Vietnamese realized that the enemy was planning a major offensive, but did not know where or when. The answer came on 30 March 1972 when 30,000 PAVN troops, supported by more than 300 tanks, crossed the border and invaded Quảng Trị Province. The &quot;Nguyen Hue Offensive&quot;—better known as the &quot;Easter Offensive&quot;—was underway.

As South Vietnamese forces were on the verge of collapse, President Richard M. Nixon responded by increasing the magnitude of the U.S. air support. Due to the withdrawal of U.S. aviation units from Southeast Asia, squadrons were flown into South Vietnam from Japan and the U.S. itself. The effort failed to halt the fall of Quảng Trị City on 2 May, seemingly sealing the fate of the four northernmost provinces. The North Vietnamese then launched two further attacks from their base areas in Cambodia, the first aimed to seize Kon Tum in the Central Highlands to cut South Vietnam in two; the second provoked a series of battles in and around An Lộc, the capital of Bình Long Province. A total of 14 PAVN divisions were now committed to the offensive. On 13 May 1972, South Vietnam launched a counteroffensive with four divisions backed by massive U.S. air support. By 17 May, Quảng Trị City was retaken, but the South Vietnamese military ran out of steam. The PAVN thrusts against Kon Tum and An Lộc were contained. Due to the adoption of a conventional offensive and the logistical effort needed to sustain it, U.S. airpower was particularly effective and PAVN casualties were high. The North Vietnamese suffered approximately 100,000 casualties while the South Vietnamese suffered 30,000 fatalities during the fighting.

The seizure of territory within South Vietnam itself allowed Hanoi to extend the trail across the border with Laos and into that country. The signing of the Paris Peace Accords seemed to bring the conflict in Southeast Asia to an end. The last U.S. forces departed in March 1973. Both North and South Vietnamese were to maintain control in the areas under their influence and negotiations between the two nations, possibly leading to a coalition government and unification, were to take place. Jockeying for control of more territory, both sides flagrantly violated the ceasefire and open hostilities began anew.

By 1973, the PAVN logistical system consisted of a two-lane paved (with crushed limestone and gravel) highway that ran from the mountain passes of North Vietnam to the Chu Pong Massif in South Vietnam. By 1974 it was possible to travel a completely paved four-lane route from the Central Highlands to Tây Ninh Province, northwest of Saigon. The single oil pipeline that had once terminated near the A Shau Valley now consisted of four lines (the largest 20 cm [eight inches] in diameter) and extended south to Lộc Ninh. In July 1973 the 259th Group was redesignated the Truong Son Command, the regimental sectors were converted to divisions, and the &quot;binh trams&quot; were designated as regiments. By late 1974 forces under the new command included AAA Division 377, Transportation Division 571, Engineering Division 473, the 968th Infantry Division, and sectoral divisions 470, 471, and 472.

Command then devolved upon PAVN Major General Hoàng Thế Thiện. In December 1974 the first phase of a limited PAVN offensive in South Vietnam began. Its success inspired Hanoi to try for an expanded but still limited, offensive to improve its bargaining position with Saigon. In March, General Văn Tiến Dũng launched &quot;Campaign 275&quot;, the success of which prompted the general to push Hanoi for a final all-out offensive to take all of South Vietnam. After an ineffective attempt to halt the offensive, Saigon fell to North Vietnamese forces on 30 April 1975.

<doc id="146743" wikidata="Q197542" url="?curid=146743" title="Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party">
<text>The Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), officially the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, is a committee consisting of the top leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the state, as its members concurrently hold the most senior positions within the state council. Historically it has been composed of five to eleven members, and currently has seven members. Its officially mandated purpose is to conduct policy discussions and make decisions on major issues when the Politburo, a larger decision-making body, is not in session. According to the party&#x27;s constitution, the General Secretary of the Central Committee must also be a member of the Politburo Standing Committee.

According to the party&#x27;s Constitution, the party&#x27;s Central Committee elects the Politburo Standing Committee. In practice, however, this is only a formality. The method by which membership is determined has evolved over time. In turn, the Politburo chooses the Politburo Standing Committee through secretive negotiations. The Standing Committee functions as the epicenter of the CCP&#x27;s power and leadership, and its membership has ranged from five to nine people. During the Mao Zedong era, Mao himself selected and expelled members, while during the Deng Xiaoping era consultations among party elders on the Central Advisory Commission determined membership. Since the 1990s, Politburo membership has been determined through deliberations and straw polls by incumbent and retired members of both the Politburo and the Standing Committee.

The PSC is theoretically responsible to the Politburo, which is in turn responsible to the larger Central Committee. In practice, the Standing Committee is supreme over its parent bodies. Additionally, because China is a one-party state, Standing Committee decisions &quot;de facto&quot; have the force of law. Its membership is closely watched by both the national media as well as political watchers abroad. Historically, the role of the PSC has varied and evolved. During the Cultural Revolution, for example, the PSC had little power.

The membership of the PSC is strictly ranked in protocol sequence. Historically, the General Secretary (or Party Chairman) has been ranked first; the rankings of other leaders have varied over time. Since the 1990s, the General Secretary, President, Premier, first-ranked Vice Premier, Chairman of the National People&#x27;s Congress, the Chairman of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference, the Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party&#x27;s top anti-graft body, and the first secretary of the CCP Secretariat have consistently also been members of the Politburo Standing Committee. The portfolios of additional members varied.

== Terminology ==
The Politburo Standing Committee is technically responsible to the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party. In Chinese political usage, a &quot;Standing Committee&quot; (常务委员会, &quot;Chángwù Wěiyuánhuì&quot;) simply refers to a body that carries out the day-to-day affairs of its parent organ, in this case, the Politburo. &quot;Politburo Standing Committee&quot; is the most commonly used name to refer to the body in English-language media. It is sometimes abbreviated PSC or PBSC (if &quot;Politburo&quot; is written as &quot;Political Bureau&quot;). It can also be referred to informally as simply the &quot;Standing Committee&quot;. In its official English-language press releases, Chinese state media refers to the body by its lengthier, formal name, &quot;The Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee&quot;. In turn, its members are officially referred to as &quot;Members of Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee&quot;. These official forms are rarely used by English-language newspapers outside of mainland China.

In official Chinese-language announcements, the most commonly used name for members of the body is &quot;Zhōnggòng Zhōngyāng Zhèngzhìjú Chángwěi&quot; (中共中央政治局常委); this is an abbreviation of the much lengthier official title of &quot;Zhōngguó Gòngchǎndǎng Zhōngyāng Zhèngzhìjú Chángwù Wěiyuánhuì Wěiyuán&quot; (中国共产党中央政治局常务委员会委员). As even the officially abbreviated terminology may still be too lengthy and unwieldy, some media outlets refer to PSC members as &quot;Zhèngzhìjú Chángwěi&quot; (政治局常委) or simply &quot;Chángwěi&quot; (常委). However, note that without any context, &quot;Changwei&quot; may still be an ambiguous term, as provincial and local party committees all have a Standing Committee, the members of which can also be known as &quot;Changwei&quot;.

== History ==
=== Early history ===

The first Standing Committee was formed in July 1928, at a meeting of the 6th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Between January 1934 and the 1st plenary session of the 8th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 1956, the Standing Committee was replaced by the Central Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party. During the early history of the CCP it was seen as the highest central body that was intended to carry out day-to-day work of the Party&#x27;s Central Committee. It was composed of the top leadership figures of the larger Political Bureau (i.e., the Politburo). Unlike most other Communist parties in the world modeled after the party of Lenin, the CCP formed a Standing Committee because the Politburo (normally the highest organ in a communist party) was considered too large and unwieldy to make decisions effectively.

=== Cultural Revolution ===

In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, the Politburo Standing Committee ceased normal operations, as many of its key members, such as Chinese President Liu Shaoqi and Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping, fell out of favour with Chairman Mao. Real power was concentrated in the Cultural Revolution Group, which was nominally reporting to the Politburo Standing Committee but in fact was a separate &quot;centre of authority&quot; that acted mostly on its own accord. At the 9th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, radical supporters of Mao, Chen Boda, and Kang Sheng, gained seats on the Politburo Standing Committee, and it resumed a somewhat normal functioning. The last years of the Cultural Revolution were dominated by internal chaos. Between 1975 and 1976, PSC members Kang Sheng, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Mao all died. Deng Xiaoping was purged. During this time the body lost any semblance of a functioning policy-making or executive organ, and it met only on an ad hoc basis. By Mao&#x27;s death in September 1976, the only members who still attended meetings were Hua Guofeng, Zhang Chunqiao, Wang Hongwen, and Ye Jianying, with Zhang and Wang being members of the Gang of Four. On 6 October, Hua Guofeng called a PSC meeting ostensibly to discuss Mao&#x27;s legacy and memorial arrangements, inviting the active PSC members to attend. Wang and Zhang were both arrested at the meeting and accused of &quot;counter-revolutionary crimes&quot;. Thereafter, only Ye and Hua continued their official duties. A functioning PSC was not restored until 1977.

=== After economic reforms ===
After taking power in 1978, one of the goals of Deng Xiaoping was to strengthen the power of the party and institutionalize bodies such as the Politburo and its Standing Committee. For much of the 1980s, the PSC was restored as the party&#x27;s supreme decision-making body. The committee was again organized on the basis of democratic centralism, that is, decisions were to be made based on consensus, and, failing that, decisions are taken by majority vote; once a decision is taken the entire body speaks with one voice. However, the PSC competed with retired party elders (organized as the Central Advisory Commission, though they made most of their decisions informally) for influence. Deng Xiaoping himself bridged the two bodies, and his informal clout translated to great political power personally. In 1987, Deng and other party elders ousted then General Secretary Hu Yaobang from the PSC, replacing him with Zhao Ziyang. In 1989, Deng and various party elders ordered the military to intervene in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests without gaining the consensus of the PSC. Zhao was opposed to declaring martial law and broke with other members of the PSC, notably Premier Li Peng. In the aftermath, Zhao and Hu Qili were removed from the PSC at the Fourth Plenum in 1989, largely by fiat of Deng and the elders rather than institutional procedure, to be replaced by Jiang Zemin and Li Ruihuan.

The operation of the Standing Committee has remained largely stable since Tiananmen in 1989. The 1989 Plenum was the last occasion where a major reshuffle of the PSC occurred. At the 14th Party Congress in 1992, seven people – Jiang, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, and Hu Jintao – were named to the Standing Committee, this arrangement remained unchanged until the regularly scheduled 15th Party Congress in 1997, where Qiao Shi and Liu Huaqing retired and were replaced by Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing, showing the first signs that the PSC would become a term-based body operating on a fixed schedule. Liu Huaqing was also the last PSC member with a military background. In 1999, Vice President Hu Jintao also became Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, as he was being groomed to succeed Jiang. This was the first time Vice President had occupied the post of Vice Chairman of the CMC.

At the 16th Party Congress held in 2002, the Standing Committee was expanded from seven to nine members. Some political observers speculated that the expansion was done in order to stack the new Standing Committee with loyalists of Jiang Zemin, though this characterization has been disputed. During Hu Jintao&#x27;s term as General Secretary (2002–2012), the PSC could be understood as a &quot;leadership collective&quot; or a &quot;joint presidency&quot;; that is, essentially a body operating on consensus that executes powers normally granted to a single officeholder. The 16th Party Congress also saw Li Changchun gain a seat on the PSC without a formally defined portfolio, though he was widely considered to be the &quot;propaganda chief&quot;. Huang Ju died in June 2007, becoming the first sitting PSC member to die in office since 1976. His vacancy was not filled ostensibly because it was only a few months preceding a Party Congress, making the body operate temporarily with an eight-member structure. The 17th Party Congress maintained roughly the same structure as the 16th.

At the 18th Party Congress held in 2012, membership of the PSC was yet again reduced to seven members. The head of the Political and Legal Affairs Commission did not feature in the new Standing Committee, neither did the vice-president. The positions of executive secretary of the Secretariat and that of &quot;propaganda chief&quot; were consolidated into one person, Liu Yunshan.

=== Contemporary selection method and considerations ===
Selection of members is believed to be largely the result of high-level deliberations among incumbent members of the party&#x27;s Politburo and PSC as well as retired PSC members. Prospective candidates for membership in the PSC typically rely on individual members of this high level group to act as their patrons. The current and former Politburo members conduct several rounds of deliberations interspersed with a series of straw polls to determine their support for the candidacy of new Politburo and PSC members. These straw polls are not binding and instead reflect the evolving consensus of the group on a new member&#x27;s candidacy. The Politburo may also conduct a straw poll of all incumbent Central Committee members on the candidacy of new Politburo and PSC members, but this poll is only consultative. The process of selecting the new Politburo and PSC begins with a closed door session of the incumbent PSC at Beidaihe in the last summer before the Party Congress convenes in the fall. The list of Politburo and PSC candidates for the Central Committee to formally confirm is usually complete several weeks before the Party Congress.

According to informed academic observers such as Cheng Li, a scholar at Brookings Institution, and Susan Shirk of the Graduate School of International Relations and Pacific Studies, rise in the Chinese political system and selection to the Standing Committee depends more on loyalty to powerful patrons than on ability. It was widely believed, for example, that the Standing Committee line-up of the 16th Party Congress included several members who were elevated based on their relationship with outgoing General Secretary Jiang Zemin, including, most notably, Zeng Qinghong, Huang Ju, and Jia Qinglin. Much has been written on the divide between Princelings and the &quot;Tuanpai&quot; (Youth League faction) between the 16th and 18th Congresses, though it is not precisely known to what extent factional identity played in the selection of PSC members.

Seniority also played an important role. It was established convention that a member of the PSC must have served for at least one term on the Politburo prior to entry to the PSC. However, this &quot;rule&quot; had been broken several times by those destined for party leader or the premiership, most notably with Zhu Rongji and Hu Jintao in 1992, and Li Keqiang and Xi Jinping in 2007. Jiang Zemin was also in the middle of serving out his first term on the Politburo before he was suddenly made General Secretary and thus a member of the PSC in 1989.

Since the late 1990s, nearly all PSC members have experience as a party chief of a province or a direct-controlled municipality. Of the 29 Standing Committee members inaugurated to the body since 1997, only six individuals have not held regional party chief positions: Li Peng, Wen Jiabao, Li Lanqing, Luo Gan, Liu Yunshan, Wang Huning, and Ding Xuexiang; of these, only three – Li Peng, Wen Jiabao, and Wang Huning have never served in a regional leadership role.

Age is also key. For instance, since 1989, all Standing Committee members have been at least 50 years old at the time of their appointment. Hu Jintao was 50 upon his appointment to the PSC at the 14th Party Congress in 1992. Xi Jinping was 54 and Li Keqiang was 52 at their appointment to the PSC at the 17th Party Congress in 2007. At the same time, since the 16th Party Congress in 2002, PSC members who were 68 or older at the time of a Party Congress have retired without exception. This has been known as the rule of &quot;qi-shang, ba-xia&quot; (七上八下; lit. &quot;seven up, eight down&quot;), referring to the fact that if a PSC member is 68 or older at the time of a party congress, he must retire, but if he is 67 or younger, he may still enter the committee. Recently, however, doubt has been cast over this &quot;rule&quot;. A senior party cadre named Deng Maosheng, in a statement to state-run news agency Xinhua in October 2016, stated that &quot;The strict boundaries of &#x27;seven up, eight down&#x27; don’t exist. This is something from folklore, and cannot be trusted.&quot;

In 2002, apart from Hu Jintao, the entire PSC retired and was replaced. Strict age-based retirement instituted in the CCP meant &quot;de facto&quot; term limits and relatively high turnover, with the vast majority of members serving for one or two terms. Since 1989, the only two PSC members to have served more than three terms on the body has been Hu Jintao, who served for four terms between 1992 and 2012, and Xi Jinping, who is currently serving serving his fourth term. Policy views of ambitious aspirants are routinely concealed in order to gain the broadest level of consensus, with Hu Jintao being a prime example. Various theories have been proposed, mostly by academic outside of mainland China, to discern the &#x27;factions&#x27; within a Standing Committee (often between &quot;conservatives&quot; and &quot;reformers&quot;), though in practice due to its opaque operations, faction membership has never been a hard-and-fast rule. Overly showy or high-profile &#x27;campaigning&#x27; for the PSC, such as the actions of former Chongqing party secretary Bo Xilai, were considered detrimental to PSC selection.

== Functions ==
The Politburo Standing Committee comprises the highest-ranked officials and is the highest political decision-making body of the Chinese Communist Party and, by extension, the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The PSC members are the center of political power in China. Organizationally below them are the Politburo, and then the Central Committee.

According to the Party Constitution, the party&#x27;s Central Committee elects the Politburo Standing Committee during a plenary session. The Party Constitution also stipulates that General Secretary of the Central Committee must also be a member of the PSC. The General Secretary is responsible for convening the meetings of the PSC and decides their agenda. The PSC meets roughly every week, though its meetings are rarely publicized. The membership of the Politburo Standing Committee has ranged from five to nine people, but is currently at seven. All members of the PSC are national-level leaders. , Politburo Standing Committee members receive a monthly salary of approximately US$1,833.

<text>A search warrant is a court order that a magistrate or judge issues to authorize law enforcement officers to conduct a search of a person, location, or vehicle for evidence of a crime and to confiscate any evidence they find. In most countries, a search warrant cannot be issued in aid of civil process.

Jurisdictions that respect the rule of law and a right to privacy constrain police powers, and typically require search warrants or an equivalent procedure for searches police conducted in the course of a criminal investigation. The laws usually make an exception for hot pursuit: a police officer following a criminal who has fled the scene of a crime has the right to enter a property where the criminal has sought shelter. The necessity for a search warrant and its abilities vary from country to country. In certain authoritarian nations, police officers may be allowed to search individuals and property without having to obtain court permission or provide justification for their actions.

==United Kingdom==
In England and Wales, a local magistrate issues search warrants, which require that a constable provide evidence that supports the warrant application.

Under Section 18(5)a of Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, a constable can conduct a search immediately without an inspector&#x27;s authorisation. This subsection allows a constable to search the home of a suspect(s) under arrest in their presence before they take the suspect to a police station (or other custody location). Under Section 32 of Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, a constable who arrests a person who is on their own property or has just left their premises, may immediately search both the suspect and the immediate area.

In Scotland, a country operating on the distinct legal system of Scots law compared to England and Wales – the restrictions governing the use and execution of search warrants are set out under Part XIII under the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. Search warrants must be signed by a Sheriff after a petition from police.

Gas company officials may enter a home to inspect, repair, or replace gas meters by obtaining a warrant.

==Canada==
To get a warrant, police must present a judge with an ITO (information to obtain) form that contains reasonable and probable grounds to believe an offence has been or is being committed and that the authorization sought will afford evidence of that offence. This hearing is , meaning only the crown is present. This fact obliges the police to include any known facts that hurt their application.

After a search the occupants have a copy of the warrant and may get hold of the ITO through crown disclosure if the occupant(s) are charged. There are numerous different warrant procedures in the Criminal Code, some have specific requirements such as being served during daytime or having a named supervising officer present in the case of a home search. If these (see link) requirements are not met by the police the evidence found may become inadmissible against the accused at trial.
==India==
Under section 96 of BNSS, a search warrant may be issued where-: &lt;br&gt;
(1) (a)any Court has reason to believe that a person to whom a summons order
under section 94 or a requisition under sub-section (1) of section 95 has been, or
might be, addressed, will not or would not produce the document or thing as required
by such summons or requisition; or, &lt;br&gt;
(b) such document or thing is not known to the Court to be in the possession of
any person; or &lt;br&gt;
(c) the Court considers that the purposes of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding
under this Sanhita will be served by a general search or inspection,
it may issue a search-warrant; and the person to whom such warrant is directed, may search
or inspect in accordance therewith and the provisions hereinafter contained. &lt;br&gt;
(2) The Court may, if it thinks fit, specify in the warrant the particular place or part
thereof to which only the search or inspection shall extend; and the person charged with
the execution of such warrant shall then search or inspect only the place or part so specified. &lt;br&gt;
(3) Nothing contained in this section shall authorise any Magistrate other than a
District Magistrate or Chief Judicial Magistrate to grant a warrant to search for a document,
parcel or other thing in the custody of the postal authority.

==United States==
Under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, most police searches require a search warrant based on probable cause. The absence of valid consent or an exception to the warrant requirement (whether for purposes of effecting a search or an arrest) normally requires a warrant for police entry in an individual&#x27;s home. The probable cause standard for obtaining a search warrant is lower than the quantum of proof required for a later criminal conviction, which requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

Under the Fourth Amendment, search warrants must be reasonable and particular. This means that a search warrant must reasonably identify the items to be searched for and the place where law enforcement officials are authorized to search for those items. Unless an exception to the warrant requirement applies, the search of other buildings or areas of a building, persons or vehicles, or the search for additional items that do not reasonably fall under the original warrant, will normally require additional search warrants.

To obtain a search warrant, an officer must prove to a magistrate or judge that probable cause exists for the proposed search, based upon direct information (i.e., the officer&#x27;s personal observation) or other reliable information. An application for a search warrant will often rely upon hearsay information, such as information obtained from a confidential informant, as long as probable cause exists based on the totality of the circumstances. Police can seize both property and persons under a search warrant. The rationale is that evidence police collect without a search warrant may not be sufficient to convict, but may be sufficient to suggest that a warrant would allow police to find enough evidence to convict.

The issue of federal warrants is determined under Title 18 of the United States Code. The law has been restated and extended under Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Federal search warrants may be prepared on Form AO 93, Search and Seizure Warrant. Although the laws are broadly similar, each state has its own laws and rules of procedure governing the issuance of warrants.

Search warrants are normally available to the public. On the other hand, they may be sealed if they contain sensitive information.

===Exceptions===
Certain searches do not require a search warrant. For example,

* Consent: a warrant is not required when a person in control of the object or property gives consent for the search.
* Hot pursuit of a felon (to prevent a felon&#x27;s escape or ability to harm others);
* Imminent destruction of evidence: where evidence might be destroyed before a warrant can be properly obtained;
* Emergency searches: such as when someone is heard screaming, yelling, or calling for help inside a dwelling; or
*Search incident to arrest (to mitigate the risk of harm to the arresting officers specifically).
* Public safety: a warrantless search may be permissible in an emergency situation where the public is in danger.
* Plain view: evidence is in the plain view of law enforcement officers, from a lawful vantage point (with similar exceptions that include plain smell, where the officer detects an odor that clearly indicates the presence of contraband or criminal activity).

In a plain view case, the officer is legitimately on the premises, his observation is from a legitimate vantage point, and it is immediately obvious that the evidence is contraband. The plain view rule applies, for example, when the officer has pulled the suspect over for a seat belt violation and sees a syringe on the passenger seat.

====Protective sweep====
If the subject is arrested in a home or vehicle, police may perform a protective search to make sure that there are no weapons within the vicinity. For example, they may search for weapons in the room where they arrested the subject of a warrant, and conduct a &quot;protective sweep&quot; of the premises if they reasonably suspect that other individuals may be hiding.

====Rental properties and hotel rooms====
With rented property, a landlord may refuse to allow law enforcement to search a tenant&#x27;s apartment without a search warrant, and police must obtain a warrant under the same guidelines as if the tenant were the owner of the property.

People who are occupying rooms at hotels or motels have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their rooms. However, a warrantless search may be possible if the hotel guest has property in their room a considerable period of time after the scheduled check-out time.

====Motor vehicle exception====
As first established by &quot;Carroll v. United States&quot; (1925), police are allowed to search a vehicle without a search warrant when they have probable cause to believe that evidence or contraband is located in a vehicle. When police arrest an individual shortly after the individual has exited a vehicle, the police may conduct a full search of the suspect&#x27;s person, any area within that person&#x27;s immediate reach, and the passenger compartment of the recently occupied vehicle for weapons or any other contraband. However, &quot;Arizona v. Gant&quot; (2009) limits such searches to circumstances where the arrested person could have accessed the vehicle, or when the vehicle could contain evidence of the crime the person is arrested for. As per &quot;Collins v. Virginia&quot; (2018), the exception does not apply when the vehicle is within the home or curtilage of the home of its owner.

====Border search exception====

Under The Border Search Exception custom and immigration officers are not required to have a warrant or probable cause to conduct searches and seizures at international borders and their functional equivalents.

This doctrine is not actually an exception to the Fourth Amendment, but rather to the Amendment&#x27;s requirement for a warrant or probable cause. Balanced against the sovereign&#x27;s interests at the border are the Fourth Amendment rights of entrants. Not only is the expectation of privacy less at the border than in the interior, the Fourth Amendment balance between the interests of the Government and the privacy right of the individual is also struck much more favorably to the Government at the border. This balance at international borders means that routine searches are &quot;reasonable&quot; there, and therefore do not violate the Fourth Amendment&#x27;s proscription against &quot;unreasonable searches and seizures&quot;.

===Delayed notice===
A sneak and peek search warrant (officially called a delayed notice warrant and also a covert entry search warrant or a surreptitious entry search warrant) is a search warrant authorizing the law enforcement officers executing it to effect physical entry into private premises without the owner&#x27;s or the occupant&#x27;s permission or knowledge and to clandestinely search the premises.

===Gag orders===
In California, the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act mandates that in certain cases concerning electronic search warrants that the court issue gag orders &quot;[...] prohibiting any party providing information from notifying any other party that information has been sought [...]&quot;.

<text>An arrest warrant is a warrant issued by a judge or magistrate on behalf of the state which authorizes the arrest and detention of an individual or the search and seizure of an individual&#x27;s property.

==Canada==
Arrest warrants are issued by a judge or justice of the peace under the Criminal Code.

Once the warrant has been issued, section 29 of the code requires that the arresting officer must give notice to the accused of the existence of the warrant, the reason for it, and produce it if requested, if it is feasible to do so.

==Czech Republic== 
Czech courts may issue an arrest warrant when it is not possible to summon or bring in for questioning a charged person and at the same time there is a reason for detention (i.e. concern that the charged person would either flee, interfere with the proceedings or continue criminal activity, see Remand in the Czech Republic).

The arrest warrant includes:
* identification of the charged person
* brief description of the act for which the person is charged
* designation of the section of the criminal code under which the person is charged
* precise description of the reasons for the issuance of the warrant

The arrest is conducted by the police. Following the arrest, the police must within 24 hours either hand the arrested person over to the nearest court or release the person.

The court must immediately interview the arrested person, who has the right to have an attorney present, unless the attorney is not within reach. The court has 24 hours from the moment of receiving the person from the police to either order remand or to release him. Reaching the maximum time is always reason for immediate release.

==Germany==
Detaining a person is only allowed under certain conditions defined by the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany (). In article 104 (Deprivation of liberty), the fundamental law determines that
only a &quot;Haftrichter&quot; (&quot;arrest judge&quot;) may order confinement that exceeds 48 hours. The former is called &quot;vorläufige Festnahme&quot; (&quot;provisional confinement&quot;), the latter is named &quot;Haftbefehl&quot; (&quot;order of arrest&quot;). Arrest warrants serve the enforcement of the proper expiry for instance in the Code of Criminal Procedure, but also in the civil procedure law and in the administrative law and the special administrative procedures after the Tax Code, the Finance Court order or the social court law.

== India ==
Courts can issue arrest warrant against an individual under Section 72 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023. Under bailable arrest warrant a person could execute a bail bond with sufficient sureties for his attendance before the Court at a specified time and thereafter until otherwise directed by the Court, the officer to whom the warrant is directed shall take such security and shall release such person from custody. A non bailable arrest warrant is usually issued for serious offences and if there exist a suspicion that the accused will abscond. Section 74 and 75 of BNSS provide the power to the Chief Judicial Magistrate or a Magistrate of the first class may direct a warrant to any person within his local jurisdiction for the arrest of any escaped convict, proclaimed offender or of any person who is accused of a non-bailable offence and is evading arrest. Such person shall acknowledge in writing the receipt of the warrant and shall execute it if the person for whose arrest it was issued, is in, or enters on, any land or other property under his charge. Section 78 of BNSS protects the rights of the arrested by making it compulsory for the police to present the arrested person before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest of the person.

==United Kingdom==
The procedure for issuing arrest warrants differs in each of the three legal jurisdictions.

===England and Wales===
In England and Wales, arrest warrants can be issued for both suspects and witnesses.

Arrest warrants for suspects can be issued by a justice of the peace under section 1 of the Magistrates&#x27; Courts Act 1980 if information (in writing) is laid before them that a person has committed or is suspected of having committed an offence. Such arrest warrants can only be issued for someone over 18 if at least one of the following is true:
* The offence the warrant relates to is an indictable offence, or is punishable with imprisonment.
* The person&#x27;s address is not sufficiently established to serve a summons there.

Arrest warrants for witnesses can be issued if:
*A justice of the peace is satisfied on oath that:
**Any person in England or Wales is likely to be able to give material evidence, or produce any document or thing likely to be material evidence, at the summary trial of an information by a magistrates&#x27; court,
**It is in the interests of justice to issue a summons under this subsection to secure the attendance of that person to give evidence or produce the document or thing, and
**It is probable that a summons would not procure the attendance of the person in question.
*or if:
**A person has failed to attend court in response to a summons,
**The court is satisfied by evidence on oath that he is likely to be able to give material evidence or produce any document or thing likely to be material evidence in the proceedings,
**It is proved on oath, or in such other manner as may be prescribed, that he has been duly served with the summons, and that a reasonable sum has been paid or tendered to him for costs and expenses, and
**It appears to the court that there is no just excuse for the failure.

===Scotland===
In Scotland, a &quot;warrant to apprehend&quot; may be issued if a defendant fails to appear in court.

===Northern Ireland===
In Northern Ireland arrest warrants are usually issued by a magistrate.

==United States==

For the police to make a lawful arrest, the arresting officer(s) must have either probable cause to arrest, or a valid arrest warrant.

A valid arrest warrant must be issued by a neutral judge or magistrate, who has determined there is probable cause for an arrest, based upon sworn testimony or an affidavit in support of the petition for a warrant. The arrest warrant must specifically identify the person to be arrested. If a law enforcement affiant provides false information or shows reckless disregard for the truth when providing an affidavit or testimony in support of an arrest warrant, that may constitute grounds to invalidate the warrant.

These minimum requirements stem from the language contained in the Fourth Amendment. Federal statutes and most jurisdictions require the issuance of an arrest warrant for the arrest of individuals for most misdemeanors that were not committed within the view of a police officer. However, as long as police have the necessary probable cause, a warrant is usually not needed to arrest someone suspected of a felony in a public place; these laws vary from state to state. In a non-emergency situation, an arrest of an individual in their home requires a warrant.

===Adequate showing of probable cause===
Probable cause can be based on either direct observation by the police officer, or on hearsay information provided by others. Information the police bring to the neutral and detached magistrate must establish that—considering the police officer&#x27;s experience and training—the officer knows facts, either through personal observation or through hearsay, that would suggest to a reasonable, prudent person that the individual named in the warrant committed or was committing a crime.

From 1964 to 1983, a constitutionally adequate affidavit comprised exclusively or primarily of hearsay information had to contain information suggesting to the examining magistrate that (1) the hearsay declarant supplying the information to the police was a credible person, and (2) that the hearsay declarant had a strong basis of knowledge for the alleged facts. Since 1983, a constitutionally sufficient affidavit must support a conclusion by a reviewing magistrate that the &quot;totality of the circumstances&quot; suggest that there is a fair probability that the facts the police relied on for probable cause to arrest are valid; the magistrate balances &quot;the relative weights of all the various indicia of reliability (and unreliability) attending an informant&#x27;s tip.&quot;

===Neutral and detached magistrate===
The individual issuing the arrest warrant need not be a judge or an attorney, but must be both capable of determining whether probable cause exists as well as be a neutral and detached official. While arrest warrants are typically issued by courts, they may also be issued by one of the chambers of the United States Congress or other legislatures.

===No known or reckless falsehoods===
A warrant is invalid if the defendant challenging the arrest warrant can show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that: 
* Specific parts of the affidavit the police submitted are false.
* The police either knowingly falsified them or made them with reckless disregard as to their truth or falsity.
* Excluding the false statements, the remainder of the affidavit would not have established probable cause to arrest.

===Description of arrestee===
The arrest warrant must, to comply with the Fourth Amendment, &quot;particularly describe&quot; the person to be seized. If the arrest warrant does not contain such a description, it is invalid—even if the affidavit submitted by the police or the warrant application contained this information.

===Mittimus===
A &quot;mittimus&quot; () is a writ issued by a court or magistrate, directing the sheriff or other executive officer to convey the person named in the writ to a prison or jail, and directing the jailor to receive and imprison the person.

Police jargon sometimes refers to such a writs as a &quot;writ of capias&quot;, defined as orders to &quot;take&quot; (or &quot;capture&quot;) a person or assets. writs are often issued when a suspect fails to appear for a scheduled adjudication, hearing, or similar proceeding.

=== Bench warrant ===
A bench warrant is a summons issued from &quot;the bench&quot; (a judge or court) directing the police to arrest someone who must be brought before a specific judge either for contempt of court or for failing to appear in court as required. Unlike a basic arrest warrant, a bench warrant is not issued to initiate a criminal action.

For example, if a defendant is released on bail or under recognizance and misses a scheduled court appearance, or if a witness whose testimony is required in court does not appear as required by a subpoena, a bench warrant may be issued for that person&#x27;s arrest. In cases where a bench warrant is issued to arrest someone who posted bail and subsequently missed their court date, once they are rearrested and brought before the judge, the judge may raise the bail amount or revoke it completely.

If a law enforcement officer stops an individual with an outstanding bench warrant against him, the person may be detained on the warrant, and may be held in jail until bond is posted or a hearing is held on the warrant. The hearing may result in the court setting a new bail amount, new conditions, and a new court appearance date. If a criminal defendant is arrested on a bench warrant, the court may determine that the person is a flight risk (likely to flee the jurisdiction) and order that person held without bail.

===Outstanding arrest warrant===
An arrest warrant is an &quot;outstanding arrest warrant&quot; when the person named in the warrant has not yet been arrested. A warrant may be outstanding if the person named in the warrant is intentionally evading law enforcement, unaware that there is a warrant out for their arrest, the agency responsible for executing the warrant has a backlog of warrants to serve, or a combination of these factors.

Some jurisdictions have a very high number of outstanding warrants. The vast majority in American jurisdictions are for traffic related (non-violent) citations. The state of California in 1999 had around 2.5 million outstanding warrants, with nearly 1 million of them in the Los Angeles area. The city of Baltimore, Maryland had 100,000 as of 2007. New Orleans, Louisiana had 49,000 in 1996. The state of Texas in 2009 had at least 1.7 million outstanding warrants in the Houston area alone.

Some jurisdictions have laws placing various restrictions on persons with outstanding warrants, such as prohibiting renewal of one&#x27;s driver&#x27;s license or obtaining a passport.

<text>An execution warrant (also called a death warrant or a black warrant) is a writ that authorizes the execution of a condemned person.

== United States ==
In the United States, either a judicial or executive official designated by law issues an execution warrant. This is done when a person, in trial court proceedings, has been sentenced to death, after trial and conviction, and usually after appeals are exhausted. Normally when a death warrant is signed and an execution date is set, the condemned person is moved from his or her death row cell to a death watch cell, which is typically located adjacent to the execution chamber. Usually, the government agency charged with carrying out an execution, normally the state&#x27;s Department of Corrections or the Federal Bureau of Prisons in federal cases, has a limited time frame, normally about 60 days, from the date the warrant is signed, to complete the execution process, or the warrant expires and the condemned person is returned to the death row cell, awaiting another execution date.

Stays of execution can be ordered in state cases by the Governor of the State, a trial court, a state appeals court or state Supreme Court or a court in the federal judiciary (including the United States Supreme Court). In federal death penalty cases the trial court, appeals courts, the United States Supreme Court and President may grant a stay of execution. In all cases, the stay may be issued at any time, even when the condemned is being prepared for execution.

<doc id="146751" wikidata="Q2624821" url="?curid=146751" title="Probable cause">
<text>In United States criminal law, probable cause is the legal standard by which police authorities have reason to obtain a warrant for the arrest of a suspected criminal and for a court&#x27;s issuing of a search warrant. One definition of the standard derives from the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case of &quot;Beck v. Ohio&quot; (1964), that probable cause exists when “at [the moment of arrest] the facts and circumstances within [the] knowledge [of the police], and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information, [are] sufficient to warrant a prudent [person] in believing that [a suspect] had committed or was committing an offense.”

Moreover, the grand jury uses the probable cause standard to determine whether or not to issue a criminal indictment. The principle behind the probable cause standard is to limit the power of authorities to conduct unlawful search and seizure of person and property, and to promote formal, forensic procedures for gathering lawful evidence for the prosecution of the arrested criminal. In the case of &quot;Berger v. New York&quot; (1967), the Supreme Court said that the purpose of the probable-cause requirement of the Fourth Amendment is to keep the state out of Constitutionally protected areas until the state has reason to believe that a specific crime is being committed or has been committed. The term of criminal law, the &quot;probable cause&quot; standard is stipulated in the text of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution:

Moreover, in U.S. immigration law, the term “reason to believe” is equivalent to the &quot;probable cause standard&quot; of criminal law, and should not be confused with reasonable suspicion, which is the legal criterion required to perform a Terry stop in the U.S.

==Definition==
The usual definition of the &quot;probable cause&quot; standard includes “a reasonable amount of suspicion, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong to justify a prudent and cautious person’s belief that certain facts are probably true.” Notably, this definition does not require that the person making the recognition must hold a public office or have public authority, which allows the citizenry’s common-sense understanding of the legal standard of &quot;probable cause&quot; for arrest.

Regarding the issuance of a warrant for arrest, probable cause is the “information sufficient to warrant a prudent person’s belief that the wanted individual had committed a crime (for an arrest warrant) or that evidence of a crime or contraband would be found in a search (for a search warrant)”. As a legal standard, &quot;probable cause&quot; is stronger than reasonable suspicion, but weaker than the requirement of evidence to secure a criminal conviction. Moreover, according to the &quot;Aguilar–Spinelli test&quot; a criminal court can choose to accept hearsay as a source of probable cause if the source-person is of reliable character or if other evidence supports the hearsay. In the case of &quot;Brinegar v. United States&quot; (1949), the Supreme Court defined probable cause as “where the facts and [the] circumstances within the officers’ knowledge, and of which they have reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient, in themselves, to warrant a belief, by a man of reasonable caution, that a crime is being committed.”

==History and development==

The use of probable cause in the United States and its integration in the Fourth Amendment has roots in English common law and the old saying that &quot;a man&#x27;s home is his castle&quot;. This is the idea that someone has the right to defend their &quot;castle&quot; or home from unwanted &quot;attacks&quot; or intrusion. In the 1600s, this saying started to apply legally to landowners to protect them from casual searches from government officials.

In the 1700s, the British use of the writs of assistance and general warrants, which allowed authorities to search wherever and whenever sometimes, without expiration date, in the American colonies were raised in several court cases. The first was in Massachusetts in 1761 when a customs agent submitted for a new writ of assistance and Boston merchants challenged its legality. In the case the lawyer for the merchants James Otis argued that writs of assistance violated the fundamentals of English Law and was unconstitutional. John Adams, a lawyer at the time who later wrote the Massachusetts provision on which the Fourth Amendment heavily relied, was impacted by James Otis&#x27;s argument

A case against general warrants was the English case &quot;Entick v. Carrington&quot; (1765). In that case, Lord Camden the chief judge said that general warrants were not the same as specific warrants and that parliament or case law could not authorize general warrants. Along with these statements, Lord Camden also affirmed that the needs of the state were more important than the individual&#x27;s rights. This upheld the ideology of the social contract while holding to idea that the government purpose was to protect the property of the people. He called for the government to seek reasonable means in order to search private property, as well as a cause.

==Probationers and parolees==
In early cases in the United States, the Supreme Court held that when a person is on probation, the standard required for a search to be lawful is lowered from &quot;probable cause&quot; to &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; or &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot;. Specifically, the degree of individualized suspicion required of a search was a determination of when there is a sufficiently high probability that criminal conduct is occurring to make the intrusion on the individual&#x27;s privacy interest reasonable. The Supreme Court held in &quot;United States v. Knights&quot;:

Later, in &quot;Samson v. California&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that reasonable suspicion is not even necessary:

The court held that reasonableness, not individualized suspicion, is the touchstone of the Fourth Amendment. It has been proposed that Fourth Amendment rights be extended to probationers and parolees, but such proposals have not gained traction. There is not much that remains of the Fourth Amendment rights of probationers after waiving their right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. An essay called &quot;They Released Me from My Cage...But They Still Keep Me Handcuffed&quot; was written in response to the &quot;Samson&quot; decision.

It has been argued that the requirement that a police officer must have individualized suspicion before searching a parolee&#x27;s person and home was long considered a foundational element of the Court&#x27;s analysis of Fourth Amendment questions and that abandoning it in the name of crime prevention represents an unprecedented blow to individual liberties.

==Use of trained drug dogs==

In the United States, use of a trained dog to smell for narcotics has been ruled in several court cases as sufficient probable cause. A K-9 Sniff in a public area is not a search according to the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in 1983 &quot;United States v. Place&quot;. In this particular case, Place was in LaGuardia Airport in New York City, and DEA agents took his luggage, even though he refused to have his bag searched. His luggage smelled of drugs, and the trained dog alerted the agents to this. Dogs alerting their officers provides enough probable cause for the officer to obtain a warrant. The DEA then procured a warrant and found a sizable amount of drugs in Place&#x27;s luggage. It was not considered a search until after the warrant because a trained dog can sniff out the smell of narcotics, without having to open and look through the luggage. However, In Florida v. Jardines the court ruled that a police officer and narcotic-sniffing dog entering the porch of a home constitutes a search which invokes the requirement of probable cause or a valid search warrant

The power of probable cause by K-9 units smelling for drugs is not limited to just airports, but even in schools, public parking lots, high crime neighborhood streets, mail, visitors in prisons, traffic stops, etc. If there is an incident where the dog alerts its officer, the probable cause from the dog is considered enough to conduct a search, as long as one of the exceptions to a warrant are present, such as incident to arrest, automobile, exigency, or with a stop and frisk. During a traffic stop and checkpoint, it is legal for police to allow a drug dog to sniff the exterior of the car. This is legal as long as it does not cause the traffic stop to be any longer than it would have been without the dog. If the dog finds a scent, it is again a substitute for probable cause.

==Cyber surveillance==
Under the 2001 USA Patriot Act, law enforcement officials did not need probable cause to access communications records, credit cards, bank numbers and stored emails held by third parties. They only need reasonable suspicion that the information they were accessing was part of criminal activities. Under this, officers were authorized for a court order to access the communication information. Only certain information could be accessed under this act (such as names, addresses, and phone numbers, etc.). Probable cause was, and is, needed for more detailed information because law enforcement needs a warrant to access additional information. Generally, law enforcement was not required to notify the suspect. However, the text of the Patriot Act limits the application of that statute to issues that clearly involve the national security of the United States. The relevant sections of the Act expired on June 1, 2015.

==Consent to search==
If voluntary consent is given and the individual giving the consent has authority over the search area, such as a car, house, business, etc. then a law enforcement officer does not need probable cause or even reasonable suspicion. If the person does not give voluntary consent, then the officer needs probable cause, and in some cases, a search warrant may be required to search the premises. Unless another exclusion to the fourth amendment of the US constitution occurs, when the person withdraws their consent for searching, the officer has to stop looking immediately.

==Accident investigation==
In the United States, the term probable cause is used in accident investigation to describe the conclusions reached by the investigating body as to the factor or factors which caused the accident. This is primarily seen in reports on aircraft accidents, but the term is used for the conclusion of diverse types of transportation accidents investigated in the United States by the National Transportation Safety Board or its predecessor, the Civil Aeronautics Board.

==Related cases==
===In the United States===
*The Supreme Court decision &quot;Illinois v. Gates&quot; lowered the threshold of probable cause by ruling that a &quot;substantial chance&quot; or &quot;fair probability&quot; of criminal activity could establish probable cause. A better-than-even chance is not required.
*The decision in &quot;Terry v. Ohio&quot; established that &quot;stop and frisks&quot; (seizures) may be made under reasonable suspicion if the officer believes a crime has been committed, is, or soon will be committed with a weapon concealed on such person.
*In &quot;United States v. Matlock&quot;, the Court announced the &quot;co-occupant consent rule&quot; which permitted one resident to consent in the co-occupant&#x27;s absence. The case established that an officer who made a search with a reasonable belief that the search was consented to by a resident did not have to provide a probable cause for the search.
:However, in &quot;Georgia v. Randolph&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled, thus replacing &quot;Matlock&quot;, when officers are presented with a situation wherein two parties, each having authority to grant consent to search premises they share, but one objects over the other&#x27;s consent, the officers must adhere to the wishes of the non-consenting party.

*&quot;New Jersey v. T. L. O.&quot; set a special precedent for searches of students at school. The Court ruled that school officials act as state officers when conducting searches, and do not require probable cause to search students&#x27; belongings, only reasonable suspicion. However, In Safford Unified School District v. Redding The court ruled that strip searches of students required probable cause or a search warrant.
*In &quot;O&#x27;Connor v. Ortega&quot;, the Court relied on &quot;T.L.O.&quot; to extend the reasonable suspicion standard to administrative searches of public employees&#x27; belongings or workplaces when conducted by supervisors seeking evidence of violations of workplace rules rather than criminal offenses.

== Probable cause hearings ==

In the various states, a probable cause hearing is the preliminary hearing typically taking place before arraignment and before a serious crime goes to trial. The judge is presented with the basis of the prosecution&#x27;s case, and the defendant is afforded full right of cross-examination and the right to be represented by legal counsel. If the prosecution cannot make a case of probable cause, the court must dismiss the case against the accused.

==Comparison with other countries==
===Sweden===
In the criminal code of some European countries, notably Sweden, probable cause is a higher level of suspicion than &quot;justifiable grounds&quot; in a two level system of formal suspicion. The latter refers only to the suspect being able to and sometimes having a motive to commit the crime and in some cases witness accounts, whereas probable cause generally requires a higher degree of physical evidence and allows for longer periods of detention before trial. See &quot;häktning&quot;.

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
Powers of arrest without a warrant can be exercised by a constable who &#x27;has reasonable grounds&#x27; to suspect that an individual is &quot;about to commit an offence&quot;, or is &quot;committing an offence&quot;; in accordance with the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 and the partially repealed Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The concept of &quot;reasonable grounds for suspecting&quot; is used throughout the law dealing with police powers.

====Scotland====
In Scotland, the legal language that provides the police with powers pertaining to stopping, arresting and searching a person – who &quot;has committed or is committing an offence&quot;, or is in possession of an offensive article, or an article used in connection with an offence – is similar to that in England and Wales. The powers are provided by the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 and the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2005.

<text>Harold Gregory Moore Jr. (February 13, 1922 – February 10, 2017) was a United States Army lieutenant general and author. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the U.S. Army&#x27;s second-highest decoration for valor, and was the first soldier in his West Point graduating class of 1945 to be promoted to brigadier general, major general, and lieutenant general.

Moore is remembered as the lieutenant colonel in command of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, at the Battle of Ia Drang in 1965, during the Vietnam War. The battle was detailed in the 1992 bestseller &quot;We Were Soldiers Once… and Young&quot;, co-authored by Moore and made into the film &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; in 2002, which starred Mel Gibson as Moore. Moore was the &quot;honorary colonel&quot; of the regiment.

Moore was awarded the Order of Saint Maurice by the National Infantry Association as well as the Distinguished Graduate Award by the West Point Association of Graduates.

==Early life and education==
Moore was born on February 13, 1922, in Bardstown, Kentucky, the eldest of four children born to Harold Sr. and Mary (Crume) Moore. His father was an insurance agent whose territory covered western Kentucky. His mother was a homemaker. Because he was interested in obtaining an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, and felt his chances were better if he lived in a larger city, he left Kentucky at the age of seventeen before finishing high school and got a job in Washington, D.C., working in the U.S. Senate book warehouse. 

Moore finished high school at night while working days and graduated from St. Joseph Preparatory School in Bardstown with the class of 1940. Moore attended George Washington University at night for two years, working at his warehouse job while waiting on an appointment to West Point. During his time at George Washington University he was initiated into the Kappa Sigma fraternity.

After President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed legislation authorizing each senator and representative to make additional appointments to the military and naval academies, Moore was offered an appointment to the United States Naval Academy by Representative Ed Creal of the 4th Congressional District of Kentucky. Moore had no desire to go to the Naval Academy. Moore instead asked Creal whether he would be willing to trade his Naval Academy appointment to another congressman for an open Military Academy appointment for Moore, if Moore could find a willing partner for the exchange. Creal agreed, and Moore soon found Representative Eugene Cox of Georgia&#x27;s 2nd Congressional District, who had an open appointment to West Point. Cox was impressed with Moore&#x27;s tenacity and he left Cox&#x27;s office with the West Point appointment.

==Military service==

===West Point===
Moore received his appointment to the U.S. Military Academy shortly after the United States entered into World War II. He reported to West Point for &quot;Reception Day&quot; on July 15, 1942, and the summer training referred to as &quot;Beast Barracks&quot; held before the formal academic school term took up in the fall. During his plebe summer at Pine Camp, he qualified as an expert on the M-1 Garand rifle and was the top scorer in his company. Although Moore did well in most of his classes, he was academically deficient in the required math subjects and he had to redouble his efforts to absorb the engineering, physics and chemistry, often studying two or three hours past lights out to memorize the material. 

In the fall of 1942, his class received the news that because of the war, his class would graduate in three years rather than the usual four years. Moore made it through the plebe year, but just barely, as he put it, it was &quot;an academic trip from hell.&quot; This observation caused Moore to lead a student&#x27;s life at West Point devoted to studying, with few extracurricular activities. After a ten-day furlough, he reported to Camp Popolopen for summer military training, where his company trained with vehicles and fired many types of weapons. The summer ended with maneuvers held again at Pine Camp. 

In his second year at the academy, he studied more complicated subjects like calculus, electrical engineering, thermodynamics and historic military campaigns. Wednesdays were spent watching the latest &quot;Staff Combat Film Report&quot;, which reported the most recent fighting from the Pacific and European war fronts. Summer military training after his second year consisted of touring U.S. Army basic training centers to study tactics and techniques.

His final academic year was spent studying military history and tactics as the war was winding down in Europe. Just before graduation, each cadet selected his branch of assignment, dependent upon their academic standing in the class and the quota of openings in each branch. Moore was in the bottom fifteen percent and he wanted an infantry assignment. When his name was finally called to declare, there were still infantry openings available. Moore graduated from West Point on June 5, 1945, and he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the infantry branch.

===Post-World War II===
Moore&#x27;s first assignment after graduation was the Infantry Officer Basic Course at Fort Benning, Georgia, which was a six-week course. During the basic course he applied for the airborne jump school at Fort Benning. He was not selected, and was instead assigned to the three-week jump school held at the 11th Airborne Division in Tokyo, Japan. His first assignment out of jump school was with the 187th Glider Infantry Regiment at Camp Crawford near Sapporo, Japan from 1945 until 1948. 

After seven months as company commander, he was assigned as Camp Crawford&#x27;s construction officer and responsible for all of the construction improvements being made at the camp. In June 1948, he was reassigned to the 82nd Airborne Division, at Fort Bragg. He volunteered to join the Airborne Test Section, a special unit testing experimental parachutes. In November 1948, he made the first of some 150 jumps with the section over the next two years. Over the course of his career, he became a jumpmaster, with over 300 jumps.

===Korean War===
In 1951, amidst the Korean War (1950–1953), he was ordered to Fort Benning to attend the Infantry Officer&#x27;s Advanced Course, which would prepare him to command a company or to serve on a battalion staff. In June 1952, Moore was assigned to the 17th Infantry Regiment of the 7th Infantry Division. As a captain, he commanded a heavy mortar company in combat. He next served as regimental Assistant Chief-of-Staff, Operations and Plans. Moore&#x27;s promotion to major was put on hold by a policy of the 7th Division commanding general, that stated that no promotion to major would be possible without command of an infantry company in combat. The division commander personally assigned Moore to an infantry company so that Moore could be promoted to major, and thus later become divisional assistant chief-of staff for operations.

===Return to the US===
In 1954, Moore returned to West Point and served for three years as an instructor in infantry tactics. While serving as an instructor, Moore taught then-Cadet Norman Schwarzkopf, who called Moore one of his &quot;heroes,&quot; and cites Moore as the reason he chose the infantry branch upon graduation. (Schwarzkopf later became a general in the U.S. Army and led the U.N. coalition forces in the Persian Gulf War against Iraq.) During this assignment, Moore took a personal interest in the battles between the French Army forces and the Việt Minh at Điện Biên Phủ in Vietnam.

In 1956, Moore was assigned to attend the year-long student course at the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. The course prepared majors for the duties of staff officers at the division and corps level. After study at Fort Leavenworth, Moore reported to the Pentagon and the Office, Chief of Research and Development where his initiative and insights were key to the development of new airborne equipment and airborne/air assault tactics. In 1960, following graduation from the Armed Forces Staff College at Norfolk, Virginia, Moore served a three-year tour as NATO Plans Officer with Headquarters, Allied Forces Northern Europe in Oslo, Norway.
In 1964, now a lieutenant colonel, Moore completed the course of study at the Naval War College, while earning a master&#x27;s degree in International Relations from George Washington University in Washington, DC. Moore was transferred to Fort Benning and commanded 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry later to become a part of 11th Air Assault Division, undergoing air assault and air mobility training and tests. On July 28, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson announced that he was sending &quot;the Airmobile Division to Vietnam&quot;. 

In July the 11th Air Assault Division was re-designated the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) and alerted for deployment to Vietnam. Moore&#x27;s battalion was re-designated as 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, the same regiment that was under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Custer when the Irish song &quot;Garry Owen&quot; was adopted as a marching tune. The &quot;Garry Owen&quot; Brigade left Fort Benning August 14, 1965, and went to South Vietnam by way of the Panama Canal aboard USNS &quot;General Maurice Rose&quot;, arriving at the Division&#x27;s An Khê Base Camp a month later.

===Vietnam War===

====Battle of la Drang====
Beginning on November 14, 1965, Lt. Col. Moore led the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) in the week-long Battle of Ia Drang. Encircled by enemy soldiers with no clear landing zone that would allow them to leave, Moore managed to persevere despite being significantly outnumbered by North Vietnamese Army (NVA) forces that engaged the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, only two-and-a-half miles away the next day. Moore&#x27;s dictum that &quot;there is always one more thing you can do to increase your odds of success&quot; and the courage of his entire command are credited by Moore with this outcome. 

Moore was wounded and earned a Purple Heart. Because the wound wasn&#x27;t serious, he did not believe he was entitled to the medal, and unsuccessfully tried to return it. He never wore the ribbon or the medal on his uniform. The blond haired Moore was known as &quot;Yellow Hair&quot; to his troops at the battle at Ia Drang, also a tongue-in-cheek homage referencing the legendary General George Armstrong Custer, who commanded as a lieutenant colonel the same 7th Cavalry Regiment at the Battle of the Little Bighorn just under a century before. Moore was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism at Ia Drang. After the Battle of the Ia Drang Valley, Moore was promoted to colonel and took over the command of the Garry Owen (3rd) Brigade.

===Post-Vietnam War service===

After his service in the Vietnam War, Moore served at the Pentagon as the military liaison to the Assistant Secretary for International Affairs in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense. In his next assignment the Army sent him to Harvard University, where he completed his M.A. in International Relations in 1968. Having completed his work at Harvard, Moore reported back to the Pentagon to work with the Deputy Chief-of-Staff for Operations. He then helped draft the Army plan for the withdrawal of two brigades of the 9th Infantry Division to the United States as a part of the Vietnamization of the war effort. 

In August 1968, Moore was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. In July 1969, he was assigned as assistant chief of staff, operations and plans, of the Eighth Army in South Korea, where tensions were high from demilitarized zone incursions and drug use and racism among Eighth Army troops were at an all-time high. Shortly after becoming commanding general of the 7th Infantry Division, Moore was promoted to major general in 1970 and he and his family moved to Camp Casey, South Korea. He was charged by General John H. Michaelis, commander, United States Forces Korea, with cleaning up the drug abuse problem and racial strife that were prevalent at the time in the 7th Division.

His plan established Officer&#x27;s Leadership Schools for company-grade officers and an NCO Leadership School for staff sergeants and below as well as issuing an &quot;Equal Opportunity Policy&quot;. He backed up the policy with the promise to punish those leaders who discriminated based on race, ethnicity or creed. As a part of the reformation of division morale, he established several different athletic programs, including football, basketball, and boxing. In 1971–1973, as commanding general of the Army Training Center at Fort Ord, California, he oversaw extensive experimentation in adapting basic and advanced individual training under Project VOLAR, in preparation for the end of conscription and the institution of the Modern Volunteer Army. 

In August 1973, Moore was assigned as commanding general, US Army Military Personnel Center (MILPERCEN). In 1974, he was appointed deputy chief of staff for personnel, Department of the Army, his last assignment before leaving the army. He dealt with army recruiting issues after the termination of the draft, as well as the orderly reduction of forces after the close of the Vietnam War. Moore&#x27;s next assignment would have been to become the commanding general, U.S. Army Japan, but he decided to retire instead. Moore retired from the army on August 1, 1977, after completing 32 years of active service.

==Personal life==

While assigned to Fort Bragg, Moore met Julia B. Compton, the daughter of Colonel and Mrs. Louis J. Compton. Julia was a student enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina and was visiting her parents at Fort Bragg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore/Galloway(2008)217&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They were married at the Fort Bragg main post chapel on November 22, 1949. The Moores had five children, Greg Moore, Steve Moore, Julie Moore Orlowski, Cecile Moore Rainey, and David Moore, as well as twelve grandchildren. Two of their sons are career U.S. Army officers: one a retired colonel and another a retired lieutenant colonel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore/Galloway(2008)220-221&quot;&gt;Moore and Galloway (2008), pp. 220–221&lt;/ref&gt;

After his retirement in 1977, Moore served as the Executive President of the Crested Butte Ski Area, Colorado. In June 2009, the 87-year-old Moore attended the opening of the National Infantry Museum in Columbus, Georgia. One of the featured exhibits of the museum is a life-size diorama of L.Z. X-Ray from the Battle of Ia Drang.

Moore died from a stroke on February 10, 2017, three days before his 95th birthday. He was buried in Fort Moore Main Post Cemetery on February 17, 2017, with full military honors and laid to rest beside his wife of 55 years who died in 2004.

==Bibliography==
*In 1975, the United States Army Center of Military History published &quot;Building a Volunteer Army: The Fort Ord Contribution&quot;, by Moore and Lieutenant Colonel Jeff M. Tuten. The 139-page paperback is a monograph concerning the Project VOLAR experiments during Moore&#x27;s tenure in command of Fort Ord in 1971–1973 in preparation for the end of the draft and the implementation of the Modern Volunteer Army.
*In 1992, Moore wrote &quot;We Were Soldiers Once… And Young&quot; with co-author Joseph L. Galloway. The book was adapted into the 2002 film &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot;, which was filmed at Forts Benning and Hunter Liggett, depicting Moore&#x27;s command of 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, at Fort Benning and in the Battle of Ia Drang.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore/Galloway(2008)221-222&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Moore and Joseph L. Galloway wrote another book together, a follow-up to their first collaboration. &quot;We Are Soldiers Still; A Journey Back to the Battlefields of Vietnam&quot; was published in 2008. Moore and Galloway reunited to give an interview on the book at the Pritzker Military Museum &amp; Library in September 2008.

==Awards and decorations==
=== Purple Heart ===
While included in the list of awards, Moore never wore the Purple Heart and tried to return the award to the Army while in Vietnam and more formally in 1968. In his January 11, 1968, letter to the Army Adjutant General, he provided this rationale, &quot;I have great respect for the Purple Heart Medal and would be proud to wear it if I consider it were fully earned by me in the future. In the case of this particular award, it was presented on the basis of a superficial &quot;punji-stake&quot; injury in Vietnam in October 1965. I do not feel that I earned the award for that slight injury and hence have never worn it, do not intend to, and request my records be set straight.&quot;

On January 16, 1968, the Adjutant General provided a formal response declining the request. The letter summarized, &quot;General Orders pertaining to this award cannot be revoked. This award is part of your official records. It will be available to you in the future if you desire it.&quot;

<text>In law, a conviction is the determination by a court of law that a defendant is guilty of a crime. A conviction may follow a guilty plea that is accepted by the court, a jury trial in which a verdict of guilty is delivered, or a trial by judge in which the defendant is found guilty.

The opposite of a conviction is an acquittal (that is, &quot;not guilty&quot;). In Scotland, there can also be a verdict of &quot;not proven&quot;, which is considered an acquittal. Sometimes, despite a defendant being found guilty, the court may order that the defendant not be convicted. This is known as a discharge and is used in countries including England, Wales, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

In any criminal justice system, innocent people are sometimes convicted. Appeal mechanisms and post conviction relief procedures may help to address this issue to some extent. An error leading to the conviction of an innocent person is known as a miscarriage of justice. In some judicial systems, the prosecution may appeal acquittals; while in others, this is prohibited under double jeopardy protections.

After a defendant is convicted, the court determines the appropriate sentence as a punishment. In addition to the sentence, a conviction can also have other consequences, known as collateral consequences of criminal charges. These can include impacts on employment, housing, the right to travel to other countries, and other areas of an individual&#x27;s life.

A person&#x27;s history of convictions is known as their antecedents or &quot;previous&quot; in the United Kingdom and &quot;priors&quot; in the United States and Australia.

<text>Punishment, commonly, is the imposition of an undesirable or unpleasant outcome upon an individual or group, meted out by an authority—in contexts ranging from child discipline to criminal law—as a deterrent to a particular action or behavior that is deemed undesirable. It is, however, possible to distinguish between various different understandings of what punishment is.

The reasoning for punishment may be to condition a child to avoid self-endangerment, to impose social conformity (in particular, in the contexts of compulsory education or military discipline), to defend norms, to protect against future harms (in particular, those from violent crime), and to maintain the law—and respect for rule of law—under which the social group is governed. Punishment may be self-inflicted as with self-flagellation and mortification of the flesh in the religious setting, but is most often a form of social coercion.

The unpleasant imposition may include a fine, penalty, or confinement, or be the removal or denial of something pleasant or desirable. The individual may be a person, or even an animal. The authority may be either a group or a single person, and punishment may be carried out formally under a system of law or informally in other kinds of social settings such as within a family. Negative or unpleasant impositions that are not authorized or that are administered without a breach of rules are not considered to be punishment as defined here. The study and practice of the punishment of crimes, particularly as it applies to imprisonment, is called penology, or, often in modern texts, corrections; in this context, the punishment process is euphemistically called &quot;correctional process&quot;. Research into punishment often includes similar research into prevention.

Justifications for punishment include retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation, and incapacitation. The last could include such measures as isolation, in order to prevent the wrongdoer&#x27;s having contact with potential victims, or the removal of a hand in order to make theft more difficult.

If only some of the conditions included in the definition of punishment are present, descriptions other than &quot;punishment&quot; may be considered more accurate. Inflicting something negative, or unpleasant, on a person or animal, without authority or not on the basis of a breach of rules is typically considered only revenge or spite rather than punishment. In addition, the word &quot;punishment&quot; is used as a metaphor, as when a boxer experiences &quot;punishment&quot; during a fight. In other situations, breaking a rule may be rewarded, and so receiving such a reward naturally does not constitute punishment. Finally the condition of breaking (or breaching) the rules must be satisfied for consequences to be considered punishment.

Punishments differ in their degree of severity, and may include sanctions such as reprimands, deprivations of privileges or liberty, fines, incarcerations, ostracism, the infliction of pain, amputation and the death penalty.
&quot;Corporal punishment&quot; refers to punishments in which physical pain is intended to be inflicted upon the transgressor.
Punishments may be judged as fair or unfair in terms of their degree of reciprocity and proportionality to the offense.
Punishment can be an integral part of socialization, and punishing unwanted behavior is often part of a system of pedagogy or behavioral modification which also includes rewards.

==Definitions==

There are a large number of different understandings of what punishment is.

===In philosophy===
Various philosophers have presented definitions of punishment. Conditions commonly considered necessary properly to describe an action as punishment are that
# it is imposed by an authority (single or multiple),
# it involves some loss to the supposed offender,
# it is in response to an offense and
# the human (or other animal) to whom the loss is imposed should be deemed at least somewhat responsible for the offense.

===In psychology===

Introduced by B.F. Skinner, punishment has a more restrictive and technical definition. Along with reinforcement it belongs under the operant conditioning category. Operant conditioning refers to learning with either punishment (often confused as negative reinforcement) or a reward that serves as a positive reinforcement of the lesson to be learned. In psychology, punishment is the reduction of a behavior via application of an unpleasant stimulus (&quot;&quot;positive&quot; punishment&quot;) or removal of a pleasant stimulus (&quot;&quot;negative&quot; punishment&quot;). Extra chores or spanking are examples of positive punishment, while removing an offending student&#x27;s recess or play privileges are examples of negative punishment. The definition requires that punishment is only determined after the fact by the reduction in behavior; if the offending behavior of the subject does not decrease, it is not considered punishment. There is some conflation of punishment and aversives, though an aversion that does not decrease behavior is not considered punishment in psychology. Additionally, &quot;aversive stimulus&quot; is a label behaviorists generally apply to negative reinforcers (as in avoidance learning), rather than the punishers.

=== In socio-biology ===
Punishment is sometimes called &quot;retaliatory&quot; or &quot;moralistic aggression&quot;; it has been observed in all species of social animals, leading evolutionary biologists to conclude that it is an evolutionarily stable strategy, selected because it favors cooperative behavior.

However, other evolutionary biologists have argued against punishment to favour cooperation. Dreber et al. demonstrate that while the availability of costly punishment can enhance cooperative behavior, it does not improve the group&#x27;s average payoff. Additionally, there is a significant negative relationship between the overall payoff and the employment of costly punishment. Individuals who achieve the highest total payoffs generally avoid using costly punishment. This indicates that employing costly punishment in cooperative games may be disadvantageous and suggests that it may have evolved for purposes other than promoting cooperation.

Achieving a certain proportion of trust in the population can lead to self-governance without the need for punishment.

==== Examples against sociobiological use ====

There are also arguments against the notion of punishment requiring intelligence, based on studies of punishment in very small-brained animals such as insects. There is proof of honey bee workers with mutations that makes them fertile laying eggs only when other honey bees are not observing them, and that the few that are caught in the act are killed. This is corroborated by computer simulations proving that a few simple reactions well within mainstream views of the extremely limited intelligence of insects are sufficient to emulate the &quot;political&quot; behavior observed in great apes. The authors argue that this falsifies the claim that punishment evolved as a strategy to deal with individuals capable of knowing what they are doing.

In the case of more complex brains, the notion of evolution selecting for specific punishment of intentionally chosen breaches of rules and/or wrongdoers capable of intentional choices (for example, punishing humans for murder while not punishing lethal viruses) is subject to criticism from coevolution issues. That punishment of individuals with certain characteristics (including but, in principle, not restricted to mental abilities) selects against those characteristics, making evolution of any mental abilities considered to be the basis for penal responsibility impossible in populations subject to such selective punishment. Certain scientists argue that this disproves the notion of humans having a biological feeling of intentional transgressions deserving to be punished.

==Scope of application==
Punishments are applied for various purposes, most generally, to encourage and enforce proper behavior as defined by society or family. Criminals are punished judicially, by fines, corporal punishment or custodial sentences such as prison; detainees risk further punishments for breaches of internal rules. Children, pupils and other trainees may be punished by their educators or instructors (mainly parents, guardians, or teachers, tutors and coaches)—see Child discipline.

Slaves, domestic and other servants were subject to punishment by their masters. Employees can still be subject to a contractual form of fine or demotion. Most hierarchical organizations, such as military and police forces, or even churches, still apply quite rigid internal discipline, even with a judicial system of their own (court martial, canonical courts).

Punishment may also be applied on moral, especially religious, grounds, as in penance (which is voluntary) or imposed in a theocracy with a religious police (as in a strict Islamic state like Iran or under the Taliban) or (though not a true theocracy) by Inquisition.

==Hell as punishment==
Belief that an individual&#x27;s ultimate punishment is being sent by God, the highest authority, to an existence in Hell, a place believed to exist in the after-life, typically corresponds to sins committed during their life. Sometimes these distinctions are specific, with damned souls suffering for each sin committed (see for example Plato&#x27;s myth of Er or Dante&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;), but sometimes they are general, with condemned sinners relegated to one or more chamber of Hell or to a level of suffering.

==History and rationale==
=== Seriousness of a crime; punishment that fits the crime ===
A principle often mentioned with respect to the degree of punishment to be meted out is that the punishment should match the crime.
One standard for measurement is the degree to which a crime affects others or society. Measurements of the degree of seriousness of a crime have been developed.
A felony is generally considered to be a crime of &quot;high seriousness&quot;, while a misdemeanor is not.

==Possible reasons for punishment==
There are many possible reasons that might be given to justify or explain why someone ought to be punished; here follows a broad outline of typical, possibly conflicting, justifications.

=== Deterrence ===
Two reasons given to justify punishment is that it is a measure to prevent people from committing an offense - deterring previous offenders from re-offending, and preventing those who may be contemplating an offence they have not committed from actually committing it. This punishment is intended to be sufficient that people would choose not to commit the crime rather than experience the punishment. The aim is to deter everyone in the community from committing offences.

Some criminologists state that the number of people convicted for crime does not decrease as a result of more severe punishment and conclude that deterrence is ineffective. Other criminologists object to said conclusion, citing that while most people do not know the exact severity of punishment such as whether the sentence for murder is 40 years or life, most people still know the rough outlines such as the punishments for armed robbery or forcible rape being more severe than the punishments for driving too fast or misparking a car. These criminologists therefore argue that lack of deterring effect of increasing the sentences for already severely punished crimes say nothing about the significance of the existence of punishment as a deterring factor.

Some criminologists argue that increasing the sentences for crimes can cause criminal investigators to give higher priority to said crimes so that a higher percentage of those committing them are convicted for them, causing statistics to give a false appearance of such crimes increasing. These criminologists argue that the use of statistics to gauge the efficiency of crime fighting methods are a danger of creating a reward hack that makes the least efficient criminal justice systems appear to be best at fighting crime, and that the appearance of deterrence being ineffective may be an example of this.

=== Rehabilitation ===

Some punishment includes work to reform and rehabilitate the culprit so that they will not commit the offence again. This is distinguished from deterrence, in that the goal here is to change the offender&#x27;s attitude to what they have done, and make them come to see that their behavior was wrong.

=== Incapacitation ===

Incapacitation as a justification of punishment refers to the offender&#x27;s ability to commit further offences being removed. Imprisonment separates offenders from the community, for example, Australia was a dumping ground for early British criminals. This was their way of removing or reducing the offenders ability to carry out certain crimes. The death penalty does this in a permanent (and irrevocable) way. In some societies, people who stole have been punished by having their hands amputated.

Crewe however, has pointed out that for incapacitation of an offender to work, it must be the case that the offender would have committed a crime had they not been restricted in this way. Should the putative offender not be going to commit further crimes, then they have not been incapacitated. The more heinous crimes such as murders have the lowest levels of recidivism and hence are the least likely offences to be subject to incapacitative effects. Antisocial behaviour and the like display high levels of recidivism and hence are the kind of crimes most susceptible to incapacitative effects. It is shown by life-course studies that long sentences for burglaries amongst offenders in their late teens and early twenties fail to incapacitate when the natural reduction in offending due to ageing is taken into account: the longer the sentence, in these cases, the less the incapacitative effect.

=== Retribution ===

Criminal activities typically give a benefit to the offender and a loss to the victim. Punishment has been justified as a measure of retributive justice, in which the goal is to try to rebalance any unjust advantage gained by ensuring that the offender also suffers a loss. Sometimes viewed as a way of &quot;getting even&quot; with a wrongdoer—the suffering of the wrongdoer is seen as a desired goal in itself, even if it has no restorative benefits for the victim. One reason societies have administered punishments is to diminish the perceived need for retaliatory &quot;street justice&quot;, blood feud, and vigilantism.

=== Restoration ===

Especially applied to minor offenses, punishment may take the form of the offender &quot;righting the wrong&quot;, or making restitution to the victim. Community service or compensation orders are examples of this sort of penalty. In models of restorative justice, victims take an &quot;active&quot; role in a process with their offenders who are encouraged to take responsibility for their actions, &quot;to repair the harm they&#x27;ve done—by apologizing, returning stolen money, or community service.&quot; The restorative justice approach aims to help the offender want to avoid future offences.

=== Education and denunciation ===

Punishment can be explained by positive prevention theory to use the criminal justice system to teach people what are the social norms for what is correct, and acts as a reinforcement.

Punishment can serve as a means for society to publicly express denunciation of an action as being criminal. Besides educating people regarding what is not acceptable behavior, it serves the dual function of preventing vigilante justice by acknowledging public anger, while concurrently deterring future criminal activity by stigmatizing the offender.
This is sometimes called the &quot;Expressive Theory&quot; of denunciation.
The pillory was a method for carrying out public denunciation.

Some critics of the education and denunciation model cite evolutionary problems with the notion that a feeling for punishment as a social signal system evolved if punishment was not effective. The critics argue that some individuals spending time and energy and taking risks in punishing others, and the possible loss of the punished group members, would have been selected against if punishment served no function other than signals that could evolve to work by less risky means.

=== Unified theory ===
A unified theory of punishment brings together multiple penal purposes—such as retribution, deterrence and rehabilitation—in a single, coherent framework. Instead of punishment requiring we choose between them, unified theorists argue that they work together as part of some wider goal such as the protection of rights.

==Criticism==
Some people think that punishment as a whole is unhelpful and even harmful to the people that it is used against. Detractors argue that punishment is simply wrong, of the same design as &quot;two wrongs make a right&quot;. Critics argue that punishment is simply revenge. Professor Deirdre Golash, author of &quot;The Case against Punishment: Retribution, Crime Prevention, and the Law&quot;, says:
 Golash also writes about imprisonment:

=== Destructiveness to thinking and betterment ===
There are critics of punishment who argue that punishment aimed at intentional actions forces people to suppress their ability to act on intent. Advocates of this viewpoint argue that such suppression of intention causes the harmful behaviors to remain, making punishment counterproductive. These people suggest that the ability to make intentional choices should instead be treasured as a source of possibilities of betterment, citing that complex cognition would have been an evolutionarily useless waste of energy if it led to justifications of fixed actions and no change as simple inability to understand arguments would have been the most thrifty protection from being misled by them if arguments were for social manipulation, and reject condemnation of people who intentionally did bad things. Punishment can be effective in stopping undesirable employee behaviors such as tardiness, absenteeism or substandard work performance. However, punishment does not necessarily cause an employee to demonstrate a desirable behavior.

<text>In criminal justice, particularly in North America, correction, corrections, and correctional, are umbrella terms describing a variety of functions typically carried out by government agencies, and involving the punishment, treatment, and supervision of persons who have been convicted of crimes. These functions commonly include imprisonment, parole, and probation. A typical &quot;correctional institution&quot; is a prison. A &quot;correctional system&quot;, also known as a &quot;penal system&quot;, thus refers to a network of agencies that administer a jurisdiction&#x27;s prisons, and community-based programs like parole, and probation boards. This system is part of the larger criminal justice system, which additionally includes police, prosecution and courts. Jurisdictions throughout Canada and the US have ministries or departments, respectively, of corrections, correctional services, or similarly-named agencies.

&quot;Corrections&quot; is also the name of a field of academic study concerned with the theories, policies, and programs pertaining to the practice of corrections. Its object of study includes personnel training and management as well as the experiences of those on the other side of the fence — the unwilling subjects of the correctional process. Stohr and colleagues (2008) write that &quot;Earlier scholars were more honest, calling what we now call corrections by the name penology, which means the study of punishment for crime.&quot;

== Terminology ==
The idea of &quot;corrective labor&quot; () in Soviet Russia dates back as far as December 1917.
From 1929 the USSR started using the terminology &quot;corrective-labor camps&quot; ()
and &quot;corrective labor colonies&quot; ().

The terminology change in US academia from &quot;penology&quot; to &quot;corrections&quot; occurred in the 1950s and 1960s which was driven by a new philosophy emphasizing rehabilitation. It was accompanied by concrete changes in some prisons, like giving more privileges to inmates, and attempting to instill a more communal atmosphere. At least nominally, most prisons became &quot;correctional institutions&quot;, and guards became &quot;correctional officers&quot;. Although the corrections-related terminology continued thereafter in US correctional practice, the philosophical view on offenders&#x27; treatment took an opposite turn in the 1980s, when academics labeled the &quot;get tough&quot; program as &quot;The New Penology&quot;.

== Community Based Corrections ==

Community Based Corrections are sanctions imposed on convicted adults or adjudicated juveniles that occur in a residential or community setting outside of jail or prison. The sanctions are enforced by agencies or courts with legal authority over the adult or juvenile offenders.

Community Based Corrections can focus on both of adults and juveniles, attempting to rehabilitate them back into the community. In contrary to the &quot;tough on crime&quot; mindset which expresses harsh punishment, this community based correctional method seeks to transition offenders back into the community.

== Sentences ==
In Canada, until 1972, the Criminal Code legislated that courts could impose a form of whipping on male offenders, to be administered on up to three occasions, but did not limit the number of strokes. Whipping of female offenders was not allowed. The whipping could be inflicted using a strap, cat-o&#x27;-nine-tails, or a paddle unless specified by the court. The move to abolish corporal punishment in the Canadian penal system coincided with several reforms and a change from the &quot;Reform Institutions&quot; label to &quot;Corrections&quot; or &quot;Correctional&quot;.

Intermediate sanctions may include sentences to a halfway house or community service program, home confinement, and electronic monitoring. Additional sanctions may be financial and may include fines, forfeiture, and restitution; these are sometimes applied in combination.

==Theories==

The use of sanctions, which can be either positive (rewarding) or negative (punishment) is the basis of all criminal theory, along with the main goals of social control, and deterrence of deviant behavior.

Many facilities operating in the United States adhere to particular correctional theories. Although often heavily modified, these theories determine the nature of the facilities&#x27; design and security operations. The two primary theories used today are the more traditional Remote Supervision and the more contemporary direct supervision model. In the Remote Supervision Model, officers observe the inmate population from remote positions, e.g., towers or secure desk areas. The Direct Supervision Model positions prison officers within the inmate population, creating a more pronounced presence.

<doc id="146768" wikidata="Q7539246" url="?curid=146768" title="Slavery and States' Rights">
<text>&quot;Slavery and States&#x27; Rights&quot; was a speech given by former Confederate States Army general Joseph Wheeler on July 31, 1894. The speech deals with the American Civil War and is considered to be a &quot;Lost Cause&quot; view of the war&#x27;s causation. It is generally understood to argue that the United States (the Union) was to blame for the war, and downplays slavery as a cause.

==Overview==
The Richmond, Virginia &quot;Dispatch&quot; stated, &quot;The House of Representatives being in Committee of the Whole, on appropriations and expenditures, and having under consideration the bill to remove the charge of desertion standing against Patrick Kelleher, late private, Company C, Thirty-eighth Illinois Volunteers, Mr. Wheeler, of Alabama, as a member of the Committee on Military Affairs, made a speech.&quot;

In his speech, Wheeler argued that the northern states, before the Civil War, had failed to comply with the terms of the United States Constitution. In particular, he argued that slaves were property and that Northern states had infringed on the constitutional property rights of the enslavers. He also argued that not only had the northern states encouraged secession but that, in the past, they had sought secession. Thus, secession was a right of the Confederacy. As an aside, Wheeler insinuated that the northern states were themselves to blame for slavery.

===Wheeler Alleged that the Union Violated the Constitution===
Wheeler explained (paraphrased), &quot;I refute allegations that the responsibility of the war rested altogether upon the southern people. Many States of the North enacted laws making it a criminal offence for any official to comply with his oath of office.&quot; Wheeler argued that the failure of northern states to comply with the fugitive slave laws violated the Constitution. (See: nullification)

Wheeler quoted Daniel Webster in his speech, &quot;How absurd it is to suppose that when different parties enter into a compact for certain purposes either can disregard any one provision, and expect, nevertheless, the other to observe the rest!&quot;

He also noted from the Constitution, &quot;No person held to service or labor in one State under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.&quot;

He quoted Webster further, &quot;If the Northern States refuse, willfully and deliberately, to carry into effect that part of the Constitution which respects the restoration of fugitive slaves, and Congress provides no remedy, the South would no longer be bound to observe the compact.&quot;

Wheeler continues, &quot;Then followed the election of Abraham Lincoln...The South was of necessity alarmed. They were seized with the fear that the extreme leaders of the Republican party would not stop at any excess and would deprive them of their property.&quot; (e.g., enslaved people)

Wheeler quoted Webster, &quot;Look at the proceedings of the anti-slavery conventions in Ohio, Massachusetts, and at Syracuse, in the State of New York. They pledge their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to violate the Constitution; they pledge their sacred honor to commit treason!&quot;

===Wheeler Alleged that the Southern Colonies had Opposed Slavery===
Wheeler also argued that northerners were to blame for slavery. He said, &quot;When the people of the South settled on the shores of Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia, they had no intention of encouraging or even tolerating the institution of slavery. The thrifty New England seamen, solely with the view of profit, urged slavery upon all the Colonies&quot;.

Wheeler continues, &quot;Oglethorpe and his colonists were possibly the most determined in resisting the importation, sale and use of African slaves; and for twenty years they were successful in the enforcement of the law which prohibited the landing of slaves in Georgia.&quot;

Wheeler added, &quot;The evil of this traffic soon became apparent to the people of the South, and when the Constitution was framed in 1787, the South demanded that the fundamental law of our land should inhibit this traffic of importing human beings from Africa. The South was resisted by the New England slave-traders.&quot;

One might construe that Wheeler was arguing that northern capitalists first &quot;tricked&quot; southerners into enslaving people. Then, once enslavers had heavily invested in this property, the northern states waged what Wheeler called &quot;a war upon the institution of slavery.&quot;

===Wheeler Alleges That Secession is a Right===
Wheeler argued that the right of the Confederacy to secede from the United States was a historically proven right.

Wheeler quoted Horace Greeley, &quot;If the Declaration of Independence justifies the secession from the British Empire of three million colonists in 1776, we do not see why it would not justify the secession of five millions of southerns from the Federal Union in 1861.&quot;

He also mentioned the Shay Rebellion in Massachusetts, the Whiskey Rebellion in Pennsylvania, the Dorr Rebellion in Rhode Island, and the Hartford Convention in Connecticut.

Wheeler added, &quot;For more than half a century the South had been taught by their northern brethren that when the people of a State found that it was not to their advantage to remain in the Union it was not only their privilege but their duty to peacefully withdraw from it.&quot;

Wheeler then quoted from John Quincy Adams, &quot;If the day should ever come when the affections of the people of these States shall be alienated from each other...far better will it be for the people of the disunited States to part in friendship from each other than to be held together by constraint.&quot;

Wheeler notes, &quot;Mr. Adams and the people of New England generally regarded these views as the correct interpretation of the original compact which bound the people together.&quot;

Wheeler adds (reading from the Congressional Globe, volume XI, page 977), &quot;Three years later, on January 24, 1842, Mr. Adams presented the petition of sundry citizens of Haverhill, in the State of Massachusetts, praying that Congress will immediately adopt measures favorably to dissolve the union of these States.&quot;

Wheeler continues, &quot;On page 980, Adams spoke, &#x27;I hold that it is no perjury, that it is no high-treason, but the exercise of a sacred right to offer such a petition.&#x27;&quot;

Wheeler goes on, &quot;Mr. Gilmer, page 983, introduced the following resolution: Resolved, That in presenting to the consideration of this House a petition for the dissolution of the Union, the member from Massachusetts (Mr. Adams) has justly incurred the censure of this House.&quot;

Wheeler went on to argue that the failure of the House to pass Gilmer&#x27;s resolution was a clear demonstration that the house agreed with Adams&#x27;s statements.

Wheeler also read from the Acts and resolutions passed by the Legislature of Massachusetts in the year 1844&quot;, page 319, &quot;2. Resolved, That the project of the annexation of Texas, unless arrested on the threshold, may drive these States into a dissolution of the Union.&quot;

===Wheeler Alleges That the Northern Press Advocated Secession===
The final part of Wheeler&#x27;s speech treated the Northern press&#x27;s sentiments. He argued that the North had indicated the South was free to secede.

From the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; of November 9, 1860, &quot;If the cotton States shall become satisfied that they can do better out of the Union than in it, we insist on letting them go in peace. We hope never to live in a republic whereof one section is pinned to the residue by bayonets.&quot;

From the &quot;Tribune&quot;, of November 16, &quot;If the fifteen slave States, or even the eight cotton States alone, shall quietly, decisively say to the rest: &#x27;We prefer to be henceforth separated from you,&#x27; we shall insist that they be permitted to go in peace. Whenever the people of the cotton States shall have definitely and decisively made up their minds to separate from the rest of us, we shall urge that the proper steps be taken to give full effect to their decision.&quot;

And from the &quot;Tribune&quot; of November 19, &quot;Whenever the slave States or the cotton States only shall unitedly and coolly say to the rest, &quot;We want to get out of the Union&quot;, we shall urge that their request be acceded to.&quot;

From the &quot;New York Herald&quot; of November 26, &quot;Coercion, in any event, is out of the question. A union held together by the bayonet would be nothing better than a military despotism.&quot;

From the &quot;Herald&quot; of November 24, &quot;We have no desire to prevent secession by coercion.&quot;

From the &quot;New York Daily Tribune&quot; of November 30, &quot;We insist that they cannot be prevented, and that the attempt must not be made. If you choose to leave the Union, leave it. If you are better by yourselves, go.&quot;

From the &quot;New York Times&quot; of December 3, Wheeler quoted Horace Greeley: &quot;If seven or eight contiguous States shall present themselves authentically at Washington, saying: &#x27;We hate the Federal Union; we have withdrawn from it; we will give you the choice between acquiescing in our secession and arranging amicably all incidental questions on the one hand, and attempting to subdue us on the other&#x27;, we could not stand up for coercion, for subjugation, for we do not think it would be just.&quot;

Greeley was an abolitionist, and Wheeler continued, &quot;We hold the right of self-government even when invoked in behalf of those who deny it to others. Any attempt to compel them by force would be contrary to the fundamental ideas on which human liberty is based. If the slave States, the cotton States, or the gulf States choose to form an independent nation, they have a clear, moral right to do so.&quot;

Wheeler then read from the &quot;Commercial&quot; (an Ohio newspaper), &quot;We are not in favor of retaking the property of the United States now in possession of the seceders.&quot;

Wheeler quoted from General Winfield Scott, &quot;Wayward sisters, part in peace.&quot;

Wheeler stated, &quot;In obedience to all this advice, the Southern States did secede, and almost immediately the vast Federal armies were raised.&quot;

Wheeler ended his speech by describing the magnitude of casualties killed in the war.

<doc id="146769" wikidata="Q368519" url="?curid=146769" title="George MacDonald">
<text>George MacDonald (10 December 1824 – 18 September 1905) was a Scottish author, poet and Christian Congregational minister. He became a pioneering figure in the field of modern fantasy literature and the mentor of fellow-writer Lewis Carroll. In addition to his fairy tales, MacDonald wrote several works of Christian theology, including several collections of sermons.

==Early life==
George MacDonald was born on 10 December 1824 in Huntly, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, to George MacDonald, manufacturer, and Helen McCay or MacKay. His father, a farmer, was descended from the Clan MacDonald of Glen Coe and a direct descendant of one of the families that suffered in the massacre of 1692.

MacDonald grew up in an unusually literate environment: one of his maternal uncles, Mackintosh MacKay, was a notable Celtic scholar, editor of the &quot;Gaelic Highland Dictionary&quot; and collector of fairy tales and Celtic oral poetry. His paternal grandfather had supported the publication of an edition of James Macpherson&#x27;s &quot;Ossian&quot;, the controversial epic poem based on the Fenian Cycle of Celtic Mythology and which contributed to the starting of European Romanticism. MacDonald&#x27;s step-uncle was a Shakespeare scholar, and his paternal cousin another Celtic academic. Both his parents were readers, his father harbouring predilections for Isaac Newton, Robert Burns, William Cowper, Chalmers, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Charles Darwin, to quote a few, while his mother had received a classical education which included multiple languages.

An account cited how the young George suffered lapses in health in his early years and was subject to problems with his lungs such as asthma, bronchitis and even a bout of tuberculosis. This last illness was considered a family disease and two of MacDonald&#x27;s brothers, his mother, and later three of his own children died from the illness. Even in his adult life, he was constantly traveling in search of purer air for his lungs.

MacDonald grew up in the Congregational Church, with an atmosphere of Calvinism. However, his family was atypical, with his paternal grandfather a Catholic-born, fiddle-playing, Presbyterian elder; his paternal grandmother an Independent church rebel; his mother was a sister to the Gaelic-speaking radical who became moderator of the Free Church, while his step-mother, to whom he was also very close, was the daughter of a priest of the Scottish Episcopal Church.

MacDonald graduated from the King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen in 1845 with a degree in chemistry and physics. He spent the next several years struggling with matters of faith and deciding what to do with his life. His son, biographer Greville MacDonald, stated that his father could have pursued a career in the medical field but he speculated that lack of money put an end to this prospect. It was only in 1848 that MacDonald began theological training at Highbury College for the Congregational ministry.

==Early career ==

MacDonald was appointed minister of Trinity Congregational Church, Arundel, in 1850, after briefly serving as a locum minister in Ireland. However, his sermons—which preached God&#x27;s universal love and that everyone was capable of redemption—met with little favour and his stipend was cut in half. In May 1853, MacDonald tendered his resignation from his pastoral duties at Arundel. Later he was engaged in ministerial work in Manchester, leaving that because of poor health. An account cited the role of Lady Byron in convincing MacDonald to travel to Algiers in 1856 with the hope that the sojourn would help turn his health around. When he got back, he settled in London and taught for some time at the University of London. MacDonald was also for a time editor of &quot;Good Words for the Young&quot;.

==Writing career==
MacDonald&#x27;s first realistic novel &quot;David Elginbrod&quot; was published in 1863.

MacDonald is often regarded as the founding father of modern fantasy writing.
His best-known works are &quot;Phantastes&quot; (1858), &quot;The Princess and the Goblin&quot; (1872), &quot;At the Back of the North Wind&quot; (1868–1871), and &quot;Lilith&quot; (1895), all fantasy novels, and fairy tales such as &quot;The Light Princess&quot;, &quot;The Golden Key&quot;, and &quot;The Wise Woman&quot;. MacDonald claimed that &quot;I write, not for children, but for the child-like, whether they be of five, or fifty, or seventy-five.&quot; MacDonald also published some volumes of sermons, the pulpit not having proved an unreservedly successful venue.

After his literary success, MacDonald went on to do a lecture tour in the United States in 1872–1873, after being invited to do so by a lecture company, the Boston Lyceum Bureau. On the tour, MacDonald lectured about other poets such as Robert Burns, Shakespeare, and Tom Hood. He performed this lecture to great acclaim, speaking in Boston to crowds in the neighbourhood of three thousand people.

MacDonald served as a mentor to Lewis Carroll; it was MacDonald&#x27;s advice, and the enthusiastic reception of &quot;Alice&quot; by MacDonald&#x27;s many sons and daughters, that convinced Carroll to submit &quot;Alice&quot; for publication. Carroll, one of the finest Victorian photographers, also created photographic portraits of several of the MacDonald children. MacDonald was also friends with John Ruskin and served as a go-between in Ruskin&#x27;s long courtship with Rose La Touche. While in America he was befriended by Longfellow and Walt Whitman.

MacDonald&#x27;s use of fantasy as a literary medium for exploring the human condition greatly influenced a generation of notable authors, including C. S. Lewis, who featured him as a character in his &quot;The Great Divorce&quot;. In his introduction to his MacDonald anthology, Lewis speaks highly of MacDonald&#x27;s views: 
Others he influenced include J. R. R. Tolkien and Madeleine L&#x27;Engle. MacDonald&#x27;s non-fantasy novels, such as &quot;Alec Forbes&quot;, had their influence as well; they were among the first realistic Scottish novels, and as such MacDonald has been credited with founding the &quot;kailyard school&quot; of Scottish writing.

Chesterton cited &quot;The Princess and the Goblin&quot; as a book that had &quot;made a difference to my whole existence, ... in showing &quot;how near both the best and the worst things are to us from the first ... and making all the ordinary staircases and doors and windows into magical things.&quot;

==Later life==
In 1877 he was given a civil list (monastic poverty/civil duty) pension. From 1879 he and his family lived in Bordighera, in a place much loved by British expatriates, the Riviera dei Fiori in Liguria, Italy, almost on the French border. In that locality there also was an Anglican church, All Saints, which he attended. Deeply enamoured of the Riviera, he spent 20 years there, writing almost half of his whole literary production, especially the fantasy work. MacDonald founded a literary studio in that Ligurian town, naming it &quot;Casa Coraggio&quot; (Bravery House). It soon became one of the most renowned cultural centres of that period, well attended by British and Italian travellers, and by locals, with presentations of classic plays and readings of Dante and Shakespeare often being held.

In 1900 he moved into St George&#x27;s Wood, Haslemere, a house designed for him by his son, Robert, its building overseen by his eldest son, Greville.

George MacDonald died on 18 September 1905 in Ashtead, Surrey, England. He was cremated in Woking, Surrey, and his ashes were buried in Bordighera, in the English cemetery, along with his wife Louisa and daughters Lilia and Grace.

==Personal life ==

MacDonald married Louisa Powell in Hackney in 1851, with whom he raised a family of eleven children: Lilia Scott (1852–1891), Mary Josephine (1853–1878), Caroline Grace (1854–1884), Greville Matheson (1856–1944), Irene (1857–1939), Winifred Louise (1858–1946), Ronald (1860–1933), Robert Falconer (1862–1913), Maurice (1864–1879), Bernard Powell (1865–1928), and George Mackay (1867–1909).

His son Greville became a noted medical specialist, a pioneer of the Peasant Arts movement, wrote numerous fairy tales for children, and ensured that new editions of his father&#x27;s works were published. Another son, Ronald, became a novelist. His daughter Mary was engaged to the artist Edward Robert Hughes until her death in 1878. Ronald&#x27;s son, Philip MacDonald (George MacDonald&#x27;s grandson), became a Hollywood screenwriter.

Tuberculosis caused the death of several family members, including Lilia, Mary Josephine, Grace, and Maurice, as well as one granddaughter and a daughter-in-law. MacDonald was said to have been particularly affected by the death of Lilia, his eldest.

There is a blue plaque on his home at 20 Albert Street, Camden, London.

==Theology==

According to biographer William Raeper, MacDonald&#x27;s theology &quot;celebrated the rediscovery of God as Father, and sought to encourage an intuitive response to God and Christ through quickening his readers&#x27; spirits in their reading of the Bible and their perception of nature.&quot;

MacDonald&#x27;s oft-mentioned universalism is not the idea that everyone will automatically be saved, but is closer to Gregory of Nyssa in the view that all will ultimately repent and be restored to God.

MacDonald appears to have never felt comfortable with some aspects of Calvinist doctrine, feeling that its principles were inherently &quot;unfair&quot;; when the doctrine of predestination was first explained to him, he burst into tears (although assured that he was one of the elect). Later novels, such as &quot;Robert Falconer&quot; and &quot;Lilith&quot;, show a distaste for the idea that God&#x27;s electing love is limited to some and denied to others.

Chesterton noted that only a man who had &quot;escaped&quot; Calvinism could say that God is easy to please and hard to satisfy.

MacDonald rejected the doctrine of penal substitutionary atonement as developed by John Calvin, which argues that Christ has taken the place of sinners and is punished by the wrath of God in their place, believing that in turn it raised serious questions about the character and nature of God. Instead, he taught that Christ had come to save people from their sins, and not from a Divine penalty for their sins: the problem was not the need to appease a wrathful God, but the disease of cosmic evil itself. MacDonald frequently described the atonement in terms similar to the Christus Victor theory. MacDonald posed the rhetorical question, &quot;Did he not foil and slay evil by letting all the waves and billows of its horrid sea break upon him, go over him, and die without rebound—spend their rage, fall defeated, and cease? Verily, he made atonement!&quot;

MacDonald was convinced that God does not punish except to amend, and that the sole end of His greatest anger is the amelioration of the guilty. As the doctor uses fire and steel in certain deep-seated diseases, so God may use hell-fire if necessary to heal the hardened sinner. MacDonald declared, &quot;I believe that no hell will be lacking which would help the just mercy of God to redeem his children.&quot; MacDonald posed the rhetorical question, &quot;When we say that God is Love, do we teach men that their fear of Him is groundless?&quot; He replied, &quot;No. As much as they were will come upon them, possibly far more. ... The wrath will consume what they &quot;call&quot; themselves; so that the selves God made shall appear.&quot;

However, true repentance, in the sense of freely chosen moral growth, is essential to this process, and, in MacDonald&#x27;s optimistic view, inevitable for all beings (see universal reconciliation).

MacDonald states his theological views most distinctly in the sermon &quot;Justice&quot;, found in the third volume of &quot;Unspoken Sermons&quot;.

<doc id="146773" wikidata="Q424027" url="?curid=146773" title="Vancomycin">
<text>Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic medication used to treat certain bacterial infections. It is administered intravenously (injection into a vein) to treat complicated skin infections, bloodstream infections, endocarditis, bone and joint infections, and meningitis caused by methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. Blood levels may be measured to determine the correct dose. Vancomycin is also taken orally (by mouth) to treat &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infections. When taken orally, it is poorly absorbed.
Common side effects include pain in the area of injection and allergic reactions. Occasionally, hearing loss, low blood pressure, or bone marrow suppression occur. Safety in pregnancy is not clear, but no evidence of harm has been found, and it is likely safe for use when breastfeeding. It is a type of glycopeptide antibiotic and works by blocking the construction of a cell wall.
Vancomycin was approved for medical use in the United States in 1958. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. The WHO classifies vancomycin as critically important for human medicine. It is available as a generic medication. Vancomycin is made by the soil bacterium &quot;Amycolatopsis orientalis&quot;.

==Medical uses==
Vancomycin is indicated for the treatment of serious, life-threatening infections by Gram-positive bacteria of both aerobic and anaerobic types that are unresponsive to other antibiotics.

The increasing emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) has resulted in the development of guidelines for use by the Centers for Disease Control Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee. These guidelines restrict use of vancomycin to these indications:
* treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible organisms resistant to penicillins, such as methicillin-resistant &quot;S. aureus&quot; (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant &quot;S. epidermidis&quot; (MRSE),
* treatment of infections in individuals with serious allergy to penicillins,
* treatment of pseudomembranous colitis caused by &quot;C. difficile&quot;; in particular, in cases of relapse or where the infection is unresponsive to metronidazole treatment (for this indication, vancomycin is given orally rather than intravenously),
* treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive microorganisms in patients with serious allergies to beta-lactam antimicrobials,
* antibacterial prophylaxis for endocarditis after certain procedures in penicillin-hypersensitive people at high risk,
* surgical prophylaxis for major procedures involving implantation of prostheses in institutions with a high rate of MRSA or MRSE,
* early in treatment as an empiric antibiotic for possible MRSA infection while waiting for culture identification of the infecting organism,
* halting the progression of primary sclerosing cholangitis and preventing symptoms; vancomycin does not cure the patient and success is limited,
* treatment of endophthalmitis by intravitreal injection for Gram-positive bacteria coverage; it has been used to prevent the condition but is not recommended due to the risk of side effects.

=== Spectrum of susceptibility ===
Vancomycin is a last-resort medication for the treatment of sepsis and lower respiratory tract, skin, and bone infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility data for a few medically significant bacteria are:
* &quot;S. aureus&quot;: 0.25 μg/mL to 4.0 μg/mL
* &quot;S. aureus&quot; (methicillin resistant or MRSA): 1 μg/mL to 138 μg/mL
* &quot;S. epidermidis&quot;: ≤0.12 μg/mL to 6.25 μg/mL

==Side effects==
===Oral administration===
Common side effects associated with oral vancomycin administration (used to treat intestinal infections) include:
* gastrointestinal adverse effects (such as abdominal pain and nausea);
* dysgeusia (distorted sense of taste), in case of administration of vancomycin oral solution, but not in case of vancomycin capsules.

===Intravenous administration===
Serum vancomycin levels may be monitored in an effort to reduce side effects, but the value of such monitoring has been questioned. Peak and trough levels are usually monitored, and for research purposes the area under the concentration curve is also sometimes used. Toxicity is best monitored by looking at trough values. Immunoassays are commonly used to measure vancomycin levels.

Common adverse drug reactions (≥1% of patients) associated with intravenous vancomycin include:
* pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site;
* vancomycin flushing syndrome (VFS), previously known as red man syndrome (or &quot;redman syndrome&quot;);
* thrombophlebitis, which is common when administered through peripheral catheters but not when central venous catheters are used, although central venous catheters are a predisposing factor for upper-extremity deep-vein thrombosis.

Damage to the kidneys (nephrotoxicity) and to the hearing (ototoxicity) were side effects of the early, impure versions of vancomycin, and were prominent in clinical trials conducted in the mid-1950s. Later trials using purer forms of vancomycin found nephrotoxicity is an infrequent adverse effect (0.1% to 1% of patients), but this is accentuated in the presence of aminoglycosides.

Rare adverse effects associated with intravenous vancomycin (&lt;0.1% of patients) include anaphylaxis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, superinfection, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, tinnitus, dizziness and/or ototoxicity, and DRESS syndrome.

Vancomycin can induce platelet-reactive antibodies in the patient, leading to severe thrombocytopenia and bleeding with florid petechial hemorrhages, ecchymoses, and wet purpura.

Historically, vancomycin has been considered a nephrotoxic and ototoxic drug, based on numerous case reports in the medical literature following initial approval by the FDA in 1958. But as its use increased with the spread of MRSA beginning in the 1970s, toxicity risks were reassessed. With the removal of impurities present in earlier formulations of the drug, and with the introduction of therapeutic drug monitoring, the risk of severe toxicity has been reduced.

====Nephrotoxicity====
The extent of nephrotoxicity for vancomycin remains controversial. In 1980s, vancomycin with a purity &gt; 90% was available, and kidney toxicity defined by an increase in serum creatinine of at least 0.5 mg/dL occurred in only about 5% of patients. But dosing guidelines from the 1980s until 2008 recommended vancomycin trough concentrations between 5 and 15 μg/mL. Concern for treatment failures prompted recommendations for higher dosing (troughs 15 to 20 μg/mL) for serious infection, and acute kidney injury (AKI) rates attributable to the vancomycin increased.

Importantly, the risk of AKI increases with co-administration of other known nephrotoxins, in particular aminoglycosides. Furthermore, the sort of infections treated with vancomycin may also cause AKI, and sepsis is the most common cause of AKI in critically ill patients. Finally, studies in humans are mainly associations studies, where the cause of AKI is usually multifacotorial.

Animal studies have demonstrated that higher doses and longer duration of vancomycin exposure correlates with increased histopathologic damage and elevations in urinary biomarkers of AKI.37-38 Damage is most prevalent at the proximal tubule, which is further supported by urinary biomarkers, such as kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), clusterin, and osteopontin (OPN). In humans, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) as part of the nephrocheck test.

The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of vancomycin nephrotoxicity are multifactorial but include interstitial nephritis, tubular injury due to oxidative stress, and cast formation.

Therapeutic drug monitoring can be used during vancomycin therapy to minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity associated with excessive drug exposure. Immunoassays are commonly utilized for measuring vancomycin levels.

In children, concomitant administration of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam has been associated with an elevated incidence of AKI relative to other antibiotic regimens.

====Ototoxicity====
Attempts to establish rates of vancomycin-induced ototoxicity are even more difficult due to lack of good data. The consensus is that clearly related cases of vancomycin ototoxicity are rare. The association between vancomycin serum levels and ototoxicity is also uncertain. Cases of ototoxicity have been reported in patients whose vancomycin serum level exceeded 80 μg/mL, but cases have also been reported in patients with therapeutic levels. Thus it remains unknown whether therapeutic drug monitoring of vancomycin for the purpose of maintaining &quot;therapeutic&quot; levels prevents ototoxicity. Still, therapeutic drug monitoring can be used during vancomycin therapy to minimize the risk of ototoxicity associated with excessive drug exposure.

====Interactions with other nephrotoxins====
Another area of controversy and uncertainty is whether and to what extent vancomycin increases the toxicity of other nephrotoxins. Clinical studies have yielded various results, but animal models indicate that the nephrotoxic effect probably increases when vancomycin is added to nephrotoxins such as aminoglycosides. A dose- or serum level-effect relationship has not been established.

====Vancomycin Flushing Reaction (aka &quot;Red man syndrome&quot;)====

Vancomycin is recommended to be administered in a dilute solution slowly, over at least 60 min (maximum rate of 10 mg/min for doses &gt;500 mg) due to the high incidence of pain and thrombophlebitis and to avoid an infusion reaction known as vancomycin flushing reaction. This phenomenon has been often clinically referred to as &quot;red man syndrome&quot;. The reaction usually appears within 4 to 10 min after the commencement or soon after the completion of an infusion and is characterized by flushing and/or an erythematous rash that affects the face, neck, and upper torso, attributed to the release of histamine from mast cells. This reaction is caused by the interaction of vancomycin with MRGPRX2, a GPCR-mediating IgE-independent mast cell degranulation. Less frequently, hypotension and angioedema occur. Symptoms may be treated or prevented with antihistamines, including diphenhydramine, and are less likely to occur with slow infusion.

==Dosing considerations==
The recommended intravenous dosage in adults is 500 mg every 6 hours or 1000 mg every 12 hours, with modification to achieve a therapeutic range as needed. The recommended oral dosage in the treatment of antibiotic-induced pseudomembranous enterocolitis is 125 to 500 mg every 6 hours for 7 to 10 days.

Dose optimization and target attainment of vancomycin in children involves adjusting the dosage to maximize effectiveness while minimizing the risk of adverse effects, specifically acute kidney injury. Dose optimization is achieved by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), which allows measurement of vancomycin levels in the blood. TDM using area under the curve (AUC)-guided dosing, preferably with Bayesian forecasting, is recommended to ensure that the AUC0-24h/minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio is maintained above a certain threshold (400-600) associated with optimal efficacy.

==Routes of administration==

In the United States, vancomycin is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for intravenous and oral administration.

===Intravenous===
Vancomycin must be given intravenously for systemic therapy since it is poorly absorbed from the intestine. It is a large hydrophilic molecule that partitions poorly across the gastrointestinal mucosa. Due to its short half-life, it is often injected twice daily.

===Oral===
The only approved indication for oral vancomycin therapy is in the treatment of pseudomembranous colitis, where it must be given orally to reach the site of infection in the colon. After oral administration, the fecal concentration of vancomycin is around 500 μg/mL (sensitive strains of &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; have a mean inhibitory concentration of ≤2 μg/mL)

===Inhaled (off-label)===
Inhaled vancomycin can also be used off-label, via nebulizer, to treat various infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract.

===Rectal (off-label)===
Rectal administration is an off-label use of vancomycin for the treatment of &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection.

==Therapeutic drug monitoring==
Plasma level monitoring of vancomycin is necessary due to the drug&#x27;s biexponential distribution, intermediate hydrophilicity, and potential for ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, especially in populations with poor renal function and/or increased propensity to bacterial infection. Vancomycin activity is considered time-dependent; that is, antimicrobial activity depends on how long the serum drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration of the target organism. Thus, peak serum levels have not been shown to correlate with efficacy or toxicity; indeed, concentration monitoring is unnecessary in most cases. Circumstances in which therapeutic drug monitoring is warranted include patients receiving concomitant aminoglycoside therapy, patients with (potentially) altered pharmacokinetic parameters, patients on haemodialysis, patients administered high-dose or prolonged treatment, and patients with impaired renal function. In such cases, trough concentrations are measured.

Therapeutic drug monitoring is also used for dose optimization of vancomycin in treating children.

Target ranges for serum vancomycin concentrations have changed over the years. Early authors suggested peak levels of 30 to 40 mg/L and trough levels of 5 to 10 mg/L, but current recommendations are that peak levels need not be measured and that trough levels of 10 to 15 mg/L or 15 to 20 mg/L, depending on the nature of the infection and the specific patient&#x27;s needs, may be appropriate. Measuring vancomycin concentrations to calculate doses optimizes therapy in patients with augmented renal clearance.

==Chemistry==
Vancomycin is a branched glycosylated nonribosomal peptide produced by the Actinomycetota species &quot;Amycolatopsis orientalis&quot; (formerly designated &quot;Nocardia orientalis&quot;).

Vancomycin exhibits atropisomerism—it has multiple chemically distinct rotamers owing to the rotational restriction of some of the bonds. The form present in the drug is the thermodynamically more stable conformer.

==Biosynthesis==
Vancomycin is made by the soil bacterium &quot;Amycolatopsis orientalis&quot;.

Vancomycin biosynthesis occurs primarily via three nonribosomal protein synthases (NRPSs) VpsA, VpsB, and VpsC. The enzymes determine the amino acid sequence during its assembly through its 7 modules. Before vancomycin is assembled through NRPS, the non-proteinogenic amino acids are first synthesized. -tyrosine is modified to become the β-hydroxytyrosine (β-HT) and 4-hydroxyphenylglycine (4-Hpg) residues. 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine ring (3,5-DPG) is derived from acetate.
Nonribosomal peptide synthesis occurs through distinct modules that can load and extend the protein by one amino acid per module through the amide bond formation at the contact sites of the activating domains. Each module typically consists of an adenylation (A) domain, a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain, and a condensation (C) domain. In the A domain, the specific amino acid is activated by converting into an aminoacyl adenylate enzyme complex attached to a 4&#x27;-phosphopantetheine cofactor by thioesterification. The complex is then transferred to the PCP domain with the expulsion of AMP. The PCP domain uses the attached 4&#x27;-phosphopantethein prosthetic group to load the growing peptide chain and their precursors. The organization of the modules necessary to biosynthesize vancomycin is shown in Figure 1. In the biosynthesis of vancomycin, additional modification domains are present, such as the epimerization (E) domain, which isomerizes the amino acid from one stereochemistry to another, and a thioesterase domain (TE) is used as a catalyst for cyclization and releases of the molecule via a thioesterase scission.
A set of NRPS enzymes (peptide synthase VpsA, VpsB, and VpsC) are responsible for assembling the heptapeptide. (Figure 2). VpsA codes for modules 1, 2, and 3. VpsB codes for modules 4, 5, and 6, and VpsC codes for module 7. The vancomycin aglycone contains 4 D-amino acids, although the NRPSs only contain 3 epimerization domains. The origin of D-Leu at residue 1 is unknown. The three peptide syntheses are at the start of the region of the bacterial genome linked with antibiotic biosynthesis, and span 27 kb.

β-hydroxytyrosine (β-HT) is synthesized before incorporation into the heptapeptide backbone. L-tyrosine is activated and loaded on the NRPS VpsD, hydroxylated by OxyD, and released by the thioesterase Vhp. The timing of the chlorination by halogenase VhaA during biosynthesis is undetermined, but is proposed to occur before the complete assembly of the heptapeptide.

After the linear heptapeptide molecule is synthesized, vancomycin must undergo further modifications, such as oxidative cross-linking and glycosylation, in trans by distinct enzymes, referred to as tailoring enzymes, to become biologically active (Figure 3). To convert the linear heptapeptide to cross-linked, glycosylated vancomycin, six enzymes are required. The enzymes OxyA, OxyB, OxyC, and OxyD are cytochrome P450 enzymes. OxyB catalyzes oxidative cross-linking between residues 4 and 6, OxyA between residues 2 and 4, and OxyC between residues 5 and 7. This cross-linking occurs while the heptapeptide is covalently bound to the PCP domain of the 7th NRPS module. These P450s are recruited by the X domain in the 7th NRPS module, which is unique to glycopeptide antibiotic biosynthesis. The cross-linked heptapeptide is then released by the action of the TE domain, and methyltransferase Vmt then &quot;N&quot;-methylates the terminal leucine residue. GtfE then joins D-glucose to the phenolic oxygen of residue 4, followed by the addition of vancosamine catalyzed by GtfD.

Some of the glycosyltransferases capable of glycosylating vancomycin and related nonribosomal peptides display notable permissivity and have been used to generate libraries of differentially glycosylated analogs through glycorandomization.
==Total synthesis==
Both the vancomycin aglycone and the complete vancomycin molecule have been targets successfully reached by total synthesis. The target was first achieved by David Evans in October 1998, KC Nicolaou in December 1998, Dale Boger in 1999, and more selectively synthesized again by Boger in 2020.

== Mechanism of action ==

Vancomycin targets bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the basic building block of the bacterial cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, whether it is of aerobic or anaerobic type. Specifically, vancomycin forms hydrogen bonds with the -alanyl--alanine (-Ala--Ala) peptide motif of the peptidoglycan precursor, a component of the bacterial cell wall.

Peptidoglycan is a polymer that provides structural support to the bacterial cell wall. The peptidoglycan precursor is synthesized in the cytoplasm and then transported across the cytoplasmic membrane to the periplasmic space, where it is assembled into the cell wall. The assembly process involves two enzymatic activities: transglycosylation and transpeptidation. Transglycosylation involves the polymerization of the peptidoglycan precursor into long chains, while transpeptidation involves the cross-linking of these chains to form a three-dimensional mesh-like structure.

Vancomycin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the -Ala--Ala peptide motif of the peptidoglycan precursor, thereby preventing its processing by the transglycosylase; as such, vancomycin disrupts the transglycosylation activity of the cell wall synthesis process. The disruption leads to an incomplete and corrupted cell wall, which makes the replicating bacteria vulnerable to external forces such as osmotic pressure, so that the bacteria cannot survive and are eliminated by the immune system.

Gram-negative bacteria are insensitive to vancomycin due to their different cell wall morphology. The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria contains lipopolysaccharide, which acts as a barrier to vancomycin penetration. That is why vancomycin is mainly used to treat infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria (except some nongonococcal species of &quot;Neisseria&quot;).

The large hydrophilic molecule of vancomycin is able to form hydrogen bond interactions with the terminal -alanyl--alanine moieties of the NAM/NAG-peptides. Under normal circumstances, this is a five-point interaction. This binding of vancomycin to the -Ala--Ala prevents cell wall synthesis of the long polymers of &quot;N&quot;-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and &quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosamine (NAG) that form the backbone strands of the bacterial cell wall, and prevents the backbone polymers from cross-linking with each other.

==Plant tissue culture==
Vancomycin is one of the few antibiotics used in plant tissue culture to eliminate Gram-positive bacterial infection. It has relatively low toxicity to plants.

==Antibiotic resistance==

===Intrinsic resistance===
A few Gram-positive bacteria, such as &quot;Leuconostoc&quot; and &quot;Pediococcus&quot;, are intrinsically resistant to vancomycin, but they rarely cause disease in humans. Most &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; species are also intrinsically resistant to vancomycin, except for &quot;L. acidophilus&quot; and &quot;L. delbrueckii&quot;, which are sensitive. Other Gram-positive bacteria with intrinsic resistance to vancomycin include &quot;Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae&quot;, &quot;Weissella confusa&quot;, and &quot;Clostridium innocuum&quot;.

Most Gram-negative bacteria are intrinsically resistant to vancomycin because their outer membranes are impermeable to large glycopeptide molecules (with the exception of some non-gonococcal &quot;Neisseria&quot; species).

===Acquired resistance===
Evolution of microbial resistance to vancomycin is a growing problem, especially in healthcare facilities such as hospitals. While newer alternatives to vancomycin exist, such as linezolid (2000) and daptomycin (2003), the widespread use of vancomycin makes resistance to it a significant worry, especially for individual patients if resistant infections are not quickly identified and the patient continues an ineffective treatment. Vancomycin-resistant &quot;Enterococcus&quot; emerged in 1986. Vancomycin resistance evolved in more common pathogenic organisms during the 1990s and 2000s, including vancomycin-intermediate &quot;S. aureus&quot; (VISA) and vancomycin-resistant &quot;S. aureus&quot; (VRSA). Agricultural use of avoparcin, another similar glycopeptide antibiotic, may have contributed to the evolution of vancomycin-resistant organisms.

One mechanism of resistance to vancomycin involves the alteration to the terminal amino acid residues of the NAM/NAG-peptide subunits, under normal conditions, -alanyl--alanine, to which vancomycin binds. The -alanyl--lactate variation results in the loss of one hydrogen-bonding interaction (4, as opposed to 5 for -alanyl--alanine) possible between vancomycin and the peptide. This loss of just one point of interaction results in a 1000-fold decrease in affinity. The -alanyl--serine variation causes a six-fold loss of affinity between vancomycin and the peptide, likely due to steric hindrance.

In enterococci, this modification appears to be due to the expression of an enzyme that alters the terminal residue. Three main resistance variants have been characterised to date among resistant &quot;Enterococcus faecium&quot; and &quot;E. faecalis&quot; populations:
* VanA - enterococcal resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin; inducible on exposure to these agents
* VanB - lower-level enterococcal resistance; inducible by vancomycin, but strains may remain susceptible to teicoplanin
* VanC - least clinically important; enterococci resistant only to vancomycin; constitutive resistance

A variant of vancomycin has been tested that binds to the resistant D-lactic acid variation in vancomycin-resistant bacterial cell walls and also binds well to the original target (vancomycin-susceptible bacteria).

=== &quot;Regained&quot; vancomycin ===
In 2020 a team at the University Hospital Heidelberg (Germany) regained vancomycin&#x27;s antibacterial power by modifying the molecule with a cationic oligopeptide. The oligopeptide consists of six arginin units in Position VN. In comparison to the unmodified vancomycin the activity against vancomycin-resistant bacteria could be enhanced by a factor of 1,000. This pharmacon is still in preclinical development.

== History ==
Vancomycin was first isolated in 1953 by Edmund Kornfeld (working at Eli Lilly) from a bacteria in a soil sample collected from the interior jungles of Borneo by a missionary, William M. Bouw. The organism that produced it was eventually named &quot;Amycolatopsis orientalis&quot;. The original indication for vancomycin was to treat penicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;.

The compound was initially called compound 05865, but was later given the generic name vancomycin, derived from the term &quot;vanquish&quot;. One quickly apparent advantage was that staphylococci did not develop significant resistance, despite serial passage in culture media containing vancomycin. The rapid development of penicillin resistance by staphylococci led to its being fast-tracked for approval by the Food and Drug Administration. In 1958, Eli Lilly first marketed vancomycin hydrochloride under the trade name Vancocin.

Vancomycin never became the first-line treatment for &quot;S. aureus&quot; for several reasons:
# It possesses poor oral bioavailability, so must be given intravenously for most infections.
# β-Lactamase-resistant semisynthetic penicillins such as methicillin (and its successors, nafcillin and cloxacillin) were subsequently developed, which have better activity against non-MRSA staphylococci.
# Early trials used early, impure forms of the drug (&quot;Mississippi mud&quot;), which were found to be toxic to the inner ear and to the kidneys; these findings led to the relegation of vancomycin to a drug of last resort.

In 2004, Eli Lilly licensed Vancocin to ViroPharma in the U.S., Flynn Pharma in the UK, and Aspen Pharmacare in Australia. The patent expired in the early 1980s, and the FDA authorized the sale of several generic versions in the U.S., including from manufacturers Bioniche Pharma, Baxter Healthcare, Sandoz, Akorn-Strides, and Hospira.

==Research==
The combination of vancomycin powder and povidone-iodine lavage may reduce the risk of periprosthetic joint infection in hip and knee arthroplasties.

<text>County Sligo ( , ) is a county in Ireland. It is in the Northern and Western Region and is part of the province of Connacht. Sligo is the administrative capital and largest town in the county. Sligo County Council is the local authority for the county. The population of the county was 70,198 at the 2022 census. It is noted for Benbulben Mountain, one of Ireland&#x27;s most distinctive natural landmarks.

==History==

The county was officially formed in 1585 by Sir Henry Sidney, Lord Deputy of Ireland, but did not come into effect until the chaos of the Nine Years&#x27; War ended, in 1603. Its boundaries reflect the Ó Conchobhair Sligigh confederation of Lower Connacht () as it was at the time of the Elizabethan conquest.

This confederation consisted of the tuatha, or territories, of Cairbre Drumcliabh, Tír Fhíacrach Múaidhe, Tír Ollíol, Luíghne, Corann and Cúl ó bhFionn. Under the system of surrender and regrant each tuath was subsequently made into an English barony: Carbury, Tireragh, Tirerril, Leyny, Corran and Coolavin. The capital of the newly shired county was placed at Sligo.

A causewayed enclosure discovered in 2003 at Maugheraboy is one of the earliest indications of Neolithic farming activity on the Cúil Irra Peninsula. The nearby megalithic cemetery of Carrowmore forms part of a huge complex of Stone Age remains connecting Carrowkeel in south Sligo to the Ox Mountains, to the Cuil Irra Peninsula, where the passage tomb named after the legendary Queen Maeve, Miosgán Médhbh, dominates the western skyline from the crest of Knocknarea Mountain.

The Caves of Kesh, famous in Irish mythology, are in south County Sligo. A recent decoding of the work of Marinus of Tyre and Ptolemy shows Sligo as the likely location of Nagnata, an important place of assembly in the Iron Age. Famous medieval manuscripts written in the area include the &quot;Book of Ballymote&quot;, written in the territory of Corran, the &quot;Great Book of Lecan&quot;, and the &quot;Yellow Book of Lecan&quot;, both written in Tir Fhiacrach. The patron of the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; was Fearghal Ó Gadhra of Coolavin in south County Sligo.

==Local government and politics==

Sligo County Council is the local authority for the county. At the 2019 Sligo County Council election, it was divided into three local electoral areas (LEAs): Ballymote–Tobercurry (7 seats), Sligo–Strandhill (6 seats), and Sligo–Drumcliff (5 seats). Each of these form a municipal district, with the containing Sligo–Strandhill known as the borough district of Sligo.

===Former districts===
Under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, County Sligo was divided into the rural districts of Boyle No. 2, Dromore West, Sligo, and Tobercurry, and the urban district of Sligo. Unlike most urban districts, Sligo had retained its borough corporation. The rural districts were abolished in 1925. Sligo Borough Corporation became a borough council in 2002, before being abolished in 2014 in common with all borough and town councils in Ireland.

===National politics===
County Sligo is part of the Dáil constituency of Sligo–Leitrim (4 TDs). At the 2020 election, Martin Kenny (Sinn Féin), Frank Feighan (Fine Gael), Marc MacSharry (Fianna Fáil) and Marian Harkin (Ind) were elected.

===Coat of arms===
This coat of arms was adopted by Sligo County Council in 1980. The design on the black shield, which shows an open book on which there is a Celtic Cross and a red rose, represents collectively the literary and cultural history of Sligo. These refer to such early works as the Books of Ballymote and Lecan, while the rose was a significant theme in the poetry of W. B. Yeats. The escallop shells sprinkled on the shield refer to the origin of the word Sligeach – &quot;a place abounding in shells&quot;. The boar&#x27;s head refers to the &quot;wild boar of Benbulben&quot; in the Diarmuid and Gráinne myth. The colour scheme of the crest incorporates the Sligo GAA colours of black and white.

==Culture==

County Sligo is the setting for a large number of the texts in the Mythological Cycles. The story of Diarmad and Grainne has its final act played out on Ben Bulben. The Second Battle of Moytirra is associated with Moytirra in South County Sligo. Other texts include Bruidean Ceise Corann, set on Keash Mountain. The rich array of megalithic monuments in the area has been an inspiration to artists and writers such as Sir Samuel Ferguson. The poet and Nobel laureate W. B. Yeats (1865–1939) spent much of his childhood in northern Sligo and the county&#x27;s landscapes (particularly the Isle of Innisfree, in Lough Gill) were the inspiration for much of his poetry. Yeats said, &quot;the place that has really influenced my life most is Sligo&quot;. He is buried in North County Sligo, &quot;Under Ben Bulben&quot;, in Drumcliff. W. B. Yeats&#x27;s brother Jack, a painter, also was inspired by the Sligo landscape.

===Music===
County Sligo has a long history of traditional music. The south of the county is particularly noted with such musical luminaries as James Morrison, Michael Coleman, Paddy Killoran, Fred Finn, Peter Horan, Joe O&#x27;Dowd, Jim Donoghue, Martin Wynne, Oisín Mac Diarmada (of Téada), tin-whistle player Carmel Gunning and the band Dervish. The county has many traditional music festivals and one of the most well-known is the Queen Maeve International Summer School, a traditional Irish Music summer school of music and dance which is held annually in August in Sligo Town. On the more contemporary music scene there are Westlife, Tabby Callaghan and The Conway Sisters who are from Sligo. Strandhill, about 9 km west of Sligo, hosts the Strandhill Guitar Festival each year, featuring a wide variety of guitar music and musicians.

===Sport===
The county is home to League of Ireland Premier Division club Sligo Rovers, who have played home matches at The Showgrounds since they were founded in 1928 and won the league on 3 occasions. Their colours are red and white, hence their nickname the Bit &#x27;O&#x27; Red. Brother Walfrid, the founder of Celtic Football Club, was born in Ballymote, in the south of the county.

The county is represented in Gaelic Games by Sligo GAA. Their colours are black and white. Sligo has won the Connacht Championship 3 times.

==Geography and subdivisions==

Sligo is the 22nd largest of Ireland&#x27;s 32 counties in area and the 27th largest in terms of population. It is the fourth largest of Connacht&#x27;s 5 counties in size and third largest in terms of population. The County borders County Mayo to the west, County Roscommon to the south and south-east and County Leitrim to the northeast.

<text>A barber is a person whose occupation is mainly to cut, dress, groom, style and shave hair or beards. A barber&#x27;s place of work is known as a barbershop or the barber&#x27;s. Barbershops have been noted places of social interaction and public discourse since at least classical antiquity. In some instances, barbershops were also public forums. They were the locations of open debates, voicing public concerns, and engaging citizens in discussions about contemporary issues.

In previous times, barbers (known as barber surgeons) also performed surgery and dentistry. With the development of safety razors and the decreasing prevalence of beards in Anglophonic cultures, most barbers now specialize in cutting men&#x27;s scalp hair as opposed to facial hair.

== Names ==

In modern times, the term &quot;barber&quot; is used both as a professional title and to refer to hairdressers who specialize in men&#x27;s hair. Historically, all hairdressers were considered barbers. In the 20th century, the profession of cosmetology branched off from barbering, and today hairdressers may be licensed as either barbers or cosmetologists. Barbers differ with respect to where they work, which services they are licensed to provide, and what name they use to refer to themselves. Part of this terminology difference depends on the regulations in a given location.

In the early 1900s, an alternative word for barber, &quot;chirotonsor&quot;, came into use in the U.S.

Different states in the US vary on their labor and licensing laws. For example, in Maryland and Pennsylvania, a cosmetologist cannot use a straight razor, strictly reserved for barbers. In contrast, in New Jersey both are regulated by the State Board of Cosmetology and there is no longer a legal difference in barbers and cosmetologists, as they are issued the same license and can practice both the art of straight razor shaving, coloring, other chemical work and haircutting if they choose.

In Australia, during the mid to late 20th century, the official term for a barber was &quot;men&#x27;s hairdresser&quot;; &quot;barber&quot; was only a popular title for men&#x27;s hairdressers. During this time, most would work in either a &quot;barbershop&quot; or &quot;hairdressing salon&quot;.

== History ==
===Antiquity===
The barber&#x27;s trade has a long history: razors have been found among relics of the Bronze Age (around 3500 BC) in Egypt. The first barbering services were performed by Egyptians in 5000 BC with instruments they had made from oyster shells or sharpened flint. In ancient Egyptian culture, barbers were highly respected individuals. Priests and men of medicine are the earliest recorded examples of barbers. In addition, the art of barbering played a significant role across continents. Mayan, Aztec, Iroquois, Norse and Mongolian cultures utilized shave art as a way to distinguish roles in society and wartime. Men in Ancient Greece would have their beards, hair, and fingernails trimmed and styled by the (&quot;cureus&quot;), in an &quot;agora&quot; (market place) which also served as a social gathering for debates and gossip. The barbers used a rough cloth (ὠμόλινον) on their shoulders to keep the hairs off their dresses. There were also female barbers (κουρεύτριαι).

Barbering was introduced to Rome by the Greek colonies in Sicily in 296 BC, and barbershops (, lit. &quot;clipperies&quot;) quickly became very popular centers for daily news and gossip. A morning visit to the barber () became a part of the daily routine, as important as the visit to the public baths, and a young man&#x27;s first shave () was considered an essential part of his coming of age ceremony. Roman barbers employed rudimentary mirrors and wielded combs, razors, scissors, curling irons, specialized tools for beard removal and pomata to remove unwanted hair elsewhere. A few Roman barbers became wealthy and influential, running shops that were favorite public locations of high society. Most, however, were simple tradesmen who owned small storefronts or worked in the streets for low prices.

===Middle Ages===

Starting from the Middle Ages, barbers often served as surgeons and dentists. In addition to haircutting, hairdressing, and shaving, barbers performed surgery, bloodletting and leeching, fire cupping, enemas, and the extraction of teeth; earning them the name &quot;barber surgeons&quot;. Barber-surgeons began to form powerful guilds such as the Worshipful Company of Barbers in London. Barbers received higher pay than surgeons until surgeons were entered into British warships during naval wars. Some of the duties of the barber included neck manipulation, cleansing of ears and scalp, draining of boils, fistula and lancing of cysts with wicks.

===Modernity===
Barbershops were influential at the turn of the 19th century in the United States as African American businesses that helped to develop African American culture and economy. According to Trudier Harris, &quot;In addition to its status as a gathering place, the black barbershop also functioned as a complicated and often contradictory microcosm of the larger world. It is an environment that can bolster egos and be supportive as well as a place where phony men can be destroyed, or at least highly shamed, from participation in verbal contests and other contests of skill. It is a retreat, a haven, an escape from nagging wives and the cares of the world. It is a place where men can be men. It is a place, in contrast to Gordone&#x27;s bar, to be somebody.&quot; Barbershops from black barbers at first mostly served wealthy Caucasians. In the later part of the century they opened barbershops in black communities for serving black people.
The average shop cost $20 to equip in 1880. It was about ten by twelve feet. A hair cut in 1880 would cost five or ten cents and shaving cost three cents.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, barbershops became a common business in the United States where people would go to have their hair cut by a professional barber with good equipment. People would also play board games, talk about recent events, or gossip. They have also occasionally been used for public debates or voicing public concerns.

Most modern barbershops have special barber chairs, and special equipment for rinsing and washing hair. In some barbershops, people can read magazines or watch TV while the barber works.
Despite the economic recession in 2008, the barbershop industry has seen continued positive growth. In 2018 there was a trial that had barbers check high blood pressure in barbershops and have a pharmacist meet and treat the patient in the barbershop, with positive results.

In 2018, Arthur Rubinoff opened a museum with barber poles and antique barber equipment in Manhattan.

The barber Sam Mature, whose interview with Studs Terkel was published in Terkel&#x27;s 1974 book &quot;&quot;, says &quot;A man used to get a haircut every couple weeks. Now he waits a month or two, some of &#x27;em even longer than that. A lot of people would get manicured and fixed up every week. Most of these people retired, moved away, or died. It&#x27;s all on account of long hair. You take old-timers, they wanted to look neat, to be presentable. Now people don&#x27;t seem to care too much.&quot;

Given their importance as social hubs in certain cultures, barbershops have been used in educational campaigns. These include the U.S. literacy project Barbershop Books, which sets up reading stations in barbershops to promote a culture of reading among African American boys. Public health researchers have also explored barbershops as a venue for sexual health education.

==Barber schools ==
In 1893, A. B. Moler of Chicago established a school for barbers. This was the first institution of its kind in the world, and its success was apparent from its very start. It stood for higher education in the ranks, and the parent school was rapidly followed by branches in nearly every principal city of the United States. In the beginning of barber schools, only the practical work of shaving, hair-cutting, facial treatments, etc., was taught as neither the public nor the profession was ready to accept scientific treatments of hair, skin and scalp. Not until about 1920 was much effort made to professionalize the work.

Training to be a barber is achieved through various means around the world. In the US, barber training is carried out at &quot;barber schools&quot;.

Cost – Many states require a barber license in order to practice barbering professionally. The cost of barber school varies from state to state, and also from metro area to metro area. Schools in larger metropolitan areas tend to cost more than those located in more rural towns. Brand names can also affect the cost of barber school. Most barber schools cost between $6,500 and $10,000 to complete. Because each state has different minimums for training hours, the length and cost of the program can vary accordingly. Some schools&#x27; tuition includes supplies and textbooks, whereas others do not. Barber license exam fees typically range from $50 to $150.

Length – Most states require the same amount of training hours for barbers as they do for cosmetologists. The number of hours required ranges from 800 to 2,000 training hours, depending on the state&#x27;s licensing requirements. Most programs can be completed in 15 months or fewer.

Curriculum – The barber school curriculum consists of hair cutting, coloring and styling for men&#x27;s hair and women&#x27;s short hair. Chemical processes such as bleaching, dyeing, lightening and relaxing hair may also be taught. All cosmetology disciplines learn safety and sanitation best practices. Barber students can expect to learn some elements of anatomy, physiology, bacteriology and some small elements of pharmacology. It also teaches facial hair techniques, including traditional and modern shaves. Generally barber programs touch on scalp massage and treatments. Advanced barber training may include custom shave designs. It is more common in barbering schools than other cosmetology disciplines to get some business and ethics education, since entrepreneurship is especially common in the barbering trade with many professionals choosing to open their own barbershops. All the skills learned in barber school will be tested at the board exams, which typically feature a written and practical exam.

== Barber&#x27;s pole ==
The barber pole, featuring blue, red and white spiraling stripes, symbolizes different aspects of the craft. It is a symbol from the time when barbers used to perform medical procedures. The white and red stripes represent bandages and blood while the blue stripes represent veins. The pole may be stationary or may rotate, often with the aid of an electric motor. A spinning barber pole creates a visual illusion, in which the stripes appear to be traveling up or down the length of the pole, rather than around it.

In the United States, the blue stripe is also sometimes used to match the flag. In South Korea, barber&#x27;s poles are used both for actual barbershops and for brothels. In Forest Grove, Oregon, the &quot;World&#x27;s Tallest Barber Shop Pole&quot; measures .

Because of its bright bands and colors, the redbanded rockfish &quot;Sebastes babcocki&quot; is referred to as &quot;barber pole&quot;. Other pseudonyms include bandit, convict, canary, Hollywood, and Spanish flag.

The phrase &quot;barber pole&quot; is derisive jargon in craps, and refers to the commingling of &quot;gaming cheques of different denominations&quot;. Wagers that combine different denominations are &quot;supposed to be stacked with the highest denomination at the bottom&quot;.

== Animals ==
The term &quot;barbering&quot; when applied to laboratory mice is a behavior where mice will use their teeth to pluck out hairs from the face of cage mates when they groom each other. It is practised by both male and female mice. The &quot;barber&quot; plucks the vibrissae of the recipient. The behavior is probably related to social dominance.

<doc id="146780" wikidata="Q218747" url="?curid=146780" title="Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau">
<text>Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, Count of Mirabeau (; 9 March 17492 April 1791) was a French writer, orator, statesman and a prominent figure of the early stages of the French Revolution.

A member of the nobility, Mirabeau had been involved in numerous scandals that had left his reputation in ruins. Well-known for his oratory skills, Mirabeau quickly rose to the top of the French political hierarchy following his election to the Estates-General in 1789, and was recognized as a leader of the newly organized National Assembly. Among the revolutionaries, Mirabeau was an advocate of the moderate position of constitutional monarchy built on the model of Great Britain. He was also a leading member of the Jacobin Club.

Mirabeau died of pericarditis in 1791 and was regarded as a national hero and a father of the Revolution. He received a grand burial and was the first to be interred at the Panthéon. During the 1792 Trial of Louis XVI, the discovery that Mirabeau had secretly been in the pay of the king brought him into posthumous disgrace, and two years later his remains were removed from the Panthéon. Historians are split on whether Mirabeau was a great leader who almost saved the nation from the Terror, a venal demagogue lacking political or moral values, or a traitor in the pay of the enemy.

==Family history==
The family of Riqueti, with possible distant origins in Italy, became wealthy through merchant trading in Marseille. In 1570, Jean Riqueti bought the château and seigniory of Mirabeau, which had belonged to the great Provençal family of Barras. In 1685, Honoré Riqueti obtained the title &quot;marquis de Mirabeau&quot;.

His son, Jean Antoine, grandfather of Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, served with distinction through all the later campaigns of the reign of Louis XIV. At the Battle of Cassano (1705), he suffered a neck wound so severe that he had to wear a silver stock ever after. Because he tended to be blunt and tactless, he never rose above the rank of colonel. On retiring from the service, he married Françoise de Castellane, with whom he had three sons: Victor (marquis de Mirabeau), Jean Antoine (bailli de Mirabeau) and Louis Alexandre (comte de Mirabeau). Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, was the son of Victor.

==Early life==
Honoré-Gabriel Mirabeau was born at Le Bignon, near Nemours, the eldest surviving son of the economist Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau, and his wife Marie-Geneviève de Vassan. He was also the fifth child and second son of the couple. When he was three years old, a virulent attack of smallpox left his face disfigured. This, combined with Mirabeau&#x27;s resemblance to his maternal ancestors and his fondness for his mother, contributed to his father&#x27;s dislike of him. At the age of five, his father had him sent to the strict boarding school of Abbé Choquart in Paris by the false name of &quot;Pierre-Buffière&quot; after an estate possessed by his mother. Destined for the army, at age eighteen, he entered the military school in Paris in the regiment of Berri-Cavaleria at Saints. Of this school, which had Joseph-Louis Lagrange for its professor of mathematics, there is an amusing account in the life of Gilbert Elliot, who met Mirabeau there. On leaving school in 1767, he received a commission in a cavalry regiment that his grandfather had commanded years before.

Mirabeau&#x27;s love affairs are well-known, owing to the celebrity of the letters to Marie Thérèse de Monnier, his &quot;Sophie&quot;. In spite of his disfigurement (or perhaps because of it), he won the heart of the lady to whom his colonel was attached; this led to such scandal that his father obtained a &quot;lettre de cachet&quot;, and Mirabeau was imprisoned in the Île de Ré. On being released, the young nobleman obtained leave to accompany the French expedition to Corsica as a volunteer. During the Corsican expedition, Mirabeau contracted several more gambling debts and engaged in another scandalous love affair. However, he proved his military genius in the Corsican expedition, and also conducted a thorough study of the island during his stay. The study was most likely factually incorrect, but his desire to learn of a country that had been previously unstudied emphasizes Mirabeau&#x27;s endless curiosity and inquisitiveness, particularly into the traditions and customs of society. Mirabeau learned the value of hard work in the French army. This aspect of Mirabeau&#x27;s personality contributed to his popular success in later years, during the Revolution. After his return, he tried to keep on good terms with his father, and in 1772 he married a rich heiress, Marie–Marquerite–Emilie de Covet, daughter of the marquis de Marignane. Emilie, who was 18 years old, was apparently engaged to a much older nobleman, the Comte de Valbelle. Nonetheless, Mirabeau pursued her for several months, expecting that their marriage would benefit from the money that the couple would receive from their parents. After several months of failed attempts at being introduced to the heiress, Mirabeau bribed one of the young lady&#x27;s maids to let him into her residence, where he pretended to have had a sexual encounter with Emilie. To avoid losing face, her father saw that they got married just a couple of days afterwards. Mirabeau received a small allowance of 6,000 livres from his father, but never received the expected dowry from the marquis.

Mirabeau, who was still facing financial trouble and increasing debt, could not keep up with the expensive lifestyle to which his wife was accustomed, and their extravagances forced his father to send him into semi-exile in the country, where he wrote his earliest extant work, the &quot;Essai sur le despotisme&quot;. The couple had a son who died early, mostly due to the poor living conditions they were experiencing at that time. Then his wife asked for judicial separation in 1782. She was defended by Jean-Étienne-Marie Portalis, who later became one of the editors of the Civil Code. Mirabeau defended his own cause in this trial but lost, holding resentment against Portalis forever.

Mirabeau&#x27;s violent disposition led him to quarrel with a country gentleman who had insulted his sister, and his exile was changed by &quot;lettre de cachet&quot; into imprisonment in the Château d&#x27;If in 1774. In 1775 he was transferred to the castle of Joux, where he was not closely confined, having full leave to enter the town of Pontarlier. In a house of a friend he met Marie Thérèse de Monnier, known as &quot;Sophie&quot;, and the two fell in love. He escaped to Switzerland, where Sophie joined him; they then went to the United Provinces, where he lived by writing hack work for the booksellers; meanwhile Mirabeau had been condemned to death at Pontarlier for sedition and abduction, and in May 1777 he was seized by the Dutch police, sent to France and imprisoned by a &quot;lettre de cachet&quot; in the castle of Vincennes.

The early part of his confinement is marked by indecent letters to Sophie (first published in 1793 by Pierre Louis Manuel), and the obscene &quot;Erotica biblion&quot; and &quot;Ma conversion&quot;. In Vincennes, he met the Marquis de Sade, who was also writing erotic works; however the two disliked each other intensely. It was in these writings, however, that Mirabeau developed experience as an orator. He learned how to curb his natural loquacity and his rhetoric became firm, commanding and moving. The prison in which he was held was the first platform to hear his voice. Later during his confinement, he wrote &quot;Des Lettres de Cachet et des prisons d&#x27;état&quot;, published after his liberation (1782). It exhibits an accurate knowledge of French constitutional history, skillfully marshaled to demonstrate that the system of &quot;lettres de cachet&quot; was not only philosophically unjust but constitutionally illegal. It shows, though in a rather diffuse and declamatory form, wide historical knowledge, keen philosophical perception, and genuine eloquence, applied to a practical purpose, which was the great characteristic of Mirabeau, both as a political thinker and as a statesman.

==Before the French Revolution==
His release from Vincennes in August 1782 began the second period of Mirabeau&#x27;s life. Mirabeau not only succeeded in reversing the sentence of death against him, but also got an order for Sophie&#x27;s husband to pay the costs of the whole legal proceedings. It was thought Mirabeau would come out of the lawsuit in Aix ruined: his past convictions in prison, scandalous relationships with women, and the bad relationship with his father the Marquis all gave him a terrible reputation among judges and adversaries. However, despite being condemned by the judge, his reputation was greatly enhanced in the eyes of the public. He had withered his opponents, crushed the opposing lawyer and turned the cards in his favor regarding the death sentence. From this day forward, Mirabeau became regarded as a man of the people. Upon his release, he found that his Sophie had consoled herself with a young officer, after whose death she had committed suicide. From Pontarlier he went to Aix-en-Provence, where he claimed the court&#x27;s order said that his wife should return to him. She naturally objected, and he finally lost in the third appeal of the case when Emilie&#x27;s father produced to the court compromising letters from Mirabeau addressed to the marquess. Mirabeau then intervened in the suit between his father and mother before the parlement of Paris and attacked the ruling powers so violently that he had to leave France and return to the Dutch Republic, where he tried to live by writing. For a period he was employed by the publisher Marc-Michel Rey.

About this time he met Madame de Nehra, the daughter of Willem van Haren, a Dutch statesman and political writer. She was an educated, refined woman capable of appreciating Mirabeau&#x27;s good points. His life was strengthened by the love of Mme de Nehra, his adopted son, Lucas de Montigny, and his little dog Chico. After a time in the Dutch Republic he went to England, where his treatise on &quot;lettres de cachet&quot; was much admired after it was translated into English in 1787. He was soon admitted into the best Whig literary and political society of London through his old school friend Gilbert Elliot, who had become a leading Whig member of parliament. Of all his English friends, none seem to have been as close to him as Lord Shelburne and Sir Samuel Romilly. Romilly was introduced to Mirabeau by Sir Francis D&#x27;Ivernois, who undertook the translation of Mirabeau&#x27;s &quot;Considérations sur l&#x27;ordre de Cincinnatus&quot; into English.

The &quot;Considérations&quot; was one of several works that Mirabeau wrote in the year 1785, and it is a good specimen of his method. He had read a pamphlet published in America attacking the order, founded in 1783 as a bond of association between officers who had fought in the American Revolutionary War against Britain. The arguments struck him as true and valuable, so he rearranged them in his own fashion, and rewrote them in his own oratorical style. He supplemented the work with materials provided personally by Benjamin Franklin, who shared Mirabeau&#x27;s opinions on the topic, but was not in a position to criticize the &quot;noble order&quot; espoused by the Society of the Cincinnati directly, because he was serving as the United States Minister to France at the time.

Several other pamphlets Mirabeau wrote in 1785 attacked financial speculation. Among those, &quot;De La Caisse d&#x27;Escompte&quot; was prescient in that it correctly predicted the risky nature and ultimate demise of the French &quot;Discount Bank.&quot; This book, which condemned the fiscal politics of the state, including the Caisse d&#x27;Escompte, as going against the interest of the public, was among the influential literature critical of the French government in the years leading up to the French Revolution.

He soon found that such work did not pay enough to keep his retinue, and so he sought employment from the French foreign office, either as a writer or a diplomat. He first sent Mme de Nehra to Paris to make peace with the authorities, and then returned himself with hopes of getting a job through an old literary collaborateur of his, Durival, who was at this time director of finance at the department of foreign affairs. One of this official&#x27;s functions was to subsidize political pamphleteers, and Mirabeau hoped to be so employed. However, he ruined his chances with a series of writings on financial questions.

On his return to Paris he had become acquainted with Étienne Clavière, the Genevese exile, and a banker named Panchaud. From them he learnt about the abuse of stock-jobbing, and seizing their ideas he began to regard stock-jobbing, or &quot;agiotage&quot; (known in English as &quot;arbitrage&quot;), as the source of all evil, and to attack in his usual vehement style the Banque de St-Charles and the Compagnie des Eaux. This pamphlet brought him into controversy with Pierre Beaumarchais, who certainly did not get the best of it, but it lost him any chance of employment with the government.

His abilities were too great, however, to be overlooked by the foreign minister Charles Gravier, Comte de Vergennes. After a preliminary trip to Berlin in early 1786, he was dispatched that July on a mission to the royal court of Prussia. Upon his return in January, Mirabeau published a full account in his &quot;Secret History of the Court of Berlin&quot; (1787). This account denounced the Prussian court as scandalous and corrupt, described the dying King Frederick the Great as weak and overly emotional, and labeled Prince Henry of Prussia, brother of Frederick the Great and a guest of the French court, as narrow-minded and incompetent. He also wrote contemptuously of Prussia&#x27;s principal ministers Ewald Friedrich, Count von Hertzberg, and Joachim von Blumenthal. The resulting uproar was an extreme embarrassment for the French government, which quickly censored the book, but could not prevent its widespread notoriety. Mirabeau&#x27;s episode provided inspiration to many more radical publishers who came to regard Mirabeau as a leader of the coming revolution.

During his journey to Germany, he had made the acquaintance of Jakob Mauvillon, an expert on Prussia whose expertise Mirabeau made use of in his &quot;De la monarchie prussienne sous Frédéric le Grand&quot; (London, 1788). In 1788, Mirabeau was approached and asked to offer himself as a candidate for secretary to the Assembly of Notables, which the King Louis XVI had just convened as a method to circumvent the opposition of the parlements to crown initiatives seeking to reform France&#x27;s tax structure. His chance to be a leading voice in France as it faced political ferment seemed to be fading as he turned down the crown offer, explaining his reasoning in a letter of 18 April 1788 to the minister Montmorin. In this affair he had sought to bring his name before the public by publishing another financial work, the &quot;Dénonciation de l&#x27;agiotage&quot;, however, it had contained diatribes that harmed his chance to serve as secretary, and led him to retire to Tongeren. He further injured his prospects by publishing the reports he had sent back to France during his secret mission to Berlin. But 1789 was at hand; the Estates-General was summoned, and the French Revolution broke out soon afterward. As a result, Mirabeau was able to exploit a completely new set of political circumstances to expand exponentially his political influence.

==French Revolution==
===1789===
On hearing of the king&#x27;s decision to summon the Estates-General, Mirabeau went to Provence, and offered to assist at the preliminary conference of the nobility of his district (the local representatives of the Second Estate), but was rejected. He appealed instead to the Third Estate and was elected to the Estates-General in both Aix and Marseille. He chose to accept the seat for the former city, and was present at the opening of the Estates-General on 4 May 1789 (also his brother, André Boniface was a deputy but elected by the nobility). From this time onward, Mirabeau took a very prominent role in the deliberations of the National Constituent Assembly.

Among a large crowd of unfamiliar politicians in the Estates General, Mirabeau was one figure who stood out. He was widely known to the French public, and not only did the people place great faith in him, they feared him. His great capacity for work and extensive knowledge were easily seen, but the scandals of his private life with women, time in prison, and extensive debt could not be overlooked. At every important crisis his voice was heard, though his advice was not always followed. He possessed both logical acuity and passionate enthusiasm. From the beginning, he recognized that government should exist to allow the population to pursue its daily work in peace, and that for a government to be successful it must be strong. At the same time, he thoroughly understood that for a government to be strong, it must be in harmony with the wishes of the majority of the people. He had studied the British system of government, and he hoped to establish in France a system similar in principle, yet still distinct. In the first stages of the meetings of the Estates-General, Mirabeau was soon recognized as a leader, because he always knew his own mind and was prompt in emergencies. He is attributed with the successful consolidation of the National Assembly out of the membership of the Estates-General. During the royal session of 23 June 1789 of the National Assembly, Mirabeau replied to the king&#x27;s envoy who had come to bring the order to dissolve this Assembly : &quot;Tell those who send you that we are here by the will of the people and will leave only by the force of bayonets !&quot;

After the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, Mirabeau warned the Assembly of the futility of passing fine-sounding decrees and urged the necessity of action. Although the cause of liberty had triumphed, Mirabeau foresaw that the intervention of armed mobs would only drive the path of Revolution further and further along a destructive path of violence. He declared that the night of 4 August (when members of the Constituent Assembly took an oath to end feudalism) accomplished nothing other than to give the people immense theoretical liberty while providing them no practical freedom and overthrowing the old régime before a new one could be constituted. His failure to control the theorists demonstrated to Mirabeau that his eloquence could not enable him to guide the Assembly by himself, and that he must get additional support. He wished to establish a strong ministry in the manner of an English ministry. In his view, it should be responsible to an assembly chosen to represent the people of France better than the British House of Commons represented the common people of Great Britain.

According to a story contained in the &quot;Mémoires of the duchesse d&#x27;Abrantes&quot;, Mirabeau&#x27;s first thought of becoming a minister can be traced to May 1789, when Queen Marie Antoinette allegedly tried to bribe him. He refused the bribe, but expressed his wish to be a minister. The indignation with which the queen rejected the idea may have made him consider the Duke of Orléans, a cousin of Louis XVI, as a possible constitutional king, because his title would of necessity be parliamentary. But the weakness of the Duke of Orléans was too palpable, and Mirabeau expressed his utter contempt for him. He also attempted to form an alliance with the Marquis de la Fayette, but the two could not agree on a personal level, and Lafayette had his own theories about a new French constitution. Mirabeau tried for a time to act with Jacques Necker, the French finance minister, and obtained the sanction of the Assembly for Necker&#x27;s financial scheme, not because it was good, but because, as he said, &quot;no other plan was before them, and something must be done.&quot;

The Comte de la Marck was a close friend of the queen, and had been elected a member of the Estates-General. His acquaintance with Mirabeau, begun in 1788, ripened during the following year into a friendship, which La Marck hoped to turn to the advantage of the court. After The March on Versailles of 5 October 1789, he consulted Mirabeau as to what measures the king ought to take, and Mirabeau, delighted at the opportunity, drew up his recommendations. His &quot;Mémoire&quot; offers insight into Mirabeau&#x27;s genius for politics. The main position was that the king was not free in Paris; he must therefore depart Paris for a provincial capital in the French interior, and there he must appeal to the people and summon a great convention. It would be ruin to appeal to the nobility, as the queen advised. At this great convention the king must show himself ready to recognize that great changes had taken place, that feudalism and absolutism had forever disappeared, and that a new relationship between king and people must arise, which must be loyally observed on both sides in the future. To establish this new constitutional position between king and people would not be difficult, because the indivisibility of the monarch and his people is anchored in the heart of the French people.

This was Mirabeau&#x27;s programme, from which he never diverged, but which was far too statesmanlike to be understood by the king, and far too assertive of the altered condition of the monarchy to be palatable to the queen. Mirabeau followed up his &quot;Mémoire&quot; with a scheme for a great ministry containing all the most notable men: Necker would be prime minister, &quot;to render him as powerless as he is incapable, and yet preserve his popularity for the king&quot;; the Duc de la Rochefoucauld; La Marck; Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, Bishop of Autun; Mirabeau, without portfolio; Gui-Jean-Baptiste Target, mayor of Paris; Lafayette, as generalissimo of the army; Louis Philippe, comte de Ségur, as foreign minister; Jean Joseph Mounier; and Isaac René Guy le Chapelier.

This scheme was leaked, then ruined by a decree of the Assembly of 7 November 1789, such that no member of the Assembly could become a minister. This decree destroyed any chance of the sort of harmony between ministers and parliament that existed in England and dashed Mirabeau&#x27;s hopes. The queen utterly refused to take Mirabeau&#x27;s counsel saying, &quot;I hope that we shall never sink so low that we shall have to ask for aid from Mirabeau.&quot;, and La Marck left Paris. However, in April 1790, La Marck was suddenly recalled by the comte de Mercy-Argenteau, the Austrian ambassador to Paris, and became the queen&#x27;s most trusted political adviser. From this time to Mirabeau&#x27;s death, he was the bearer of almost daily communications between Mirabeau and the queen. Mirabeau at first attempted to make an alliance with Lafayette, but it was useless, for Lafayette was not a strong man himself.

Besides his schemes to become a minister, Mirabeau also assisted the Assembly in drafting civil rights legislation. In August 1789, he played an important role in drafting the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.

===1790–1791===

In June 1790, Mirabeau met the captive Queen Marie Antoinette in Saint Cloud, where she was less watched and confined than in Paris (where her jailers followed her every step, even in her bedroom). Mirabeau retained a close connection with the queen, and drew up many state papers for her. In return, the king used money from Austria to secretly pay his debts and provide him with a monthly allowance of six thousand francs, with promises of a million or more. Some historians argue Mirabeau was not the traitor that many believed him to be because he continued to uphold his political beliefs and tried to make possible a bridge between the king and the revolutionaries.

Mirabeau focused his efforts on two main issues: changing the ministry and dealing with impending civil war. His attempts to form political alliances with Lafayette and Necker failed and resulted in open hostility. Necker disappeared from the French court after September 1790 and no longer posed a threat. Lafayette, however, was very powerful due to his control of the military and the National Guard. At first, Mirabeau attempted to undermine Lafayette&#x27;s power, but decided to solve the problem of the ministry, and maintain stability, by removing all ministers and placing the ministry entirely under Lafayette. In effect, Mirabeau suggested that the king distance himself from politics and let the revolution run its course, because it would inevitably destroy itself through its contradictory nature. Furthermore, Mirabeau proposed that, if his plan should fail, Paris should no longer be the capital of France, showing a conservative line of thinking: the only way to end the revolution would be to destroy its place of birth. In a meeting with the king and queen, Mirabeau maintained that not only was civil war inevitable, it was necessary for the survival of the monarchy. Mirabeau believed that the decision to go to war, even civil war, must come only from the king. In a letter of confidence to Mirabeau, Louis wrote that, as a Christian king, he could not declare war on his own subjects. However, that would not stop him from reacting in kind if his subjects declared war first. In order to avoid provoking a civil war, the king refrained from confronting the Constituent Assembly, and hoped instead for a constitution that he could agree to. Once the Civil Constitution of the Clergy of 1790 destroyed this hope, Louis adopted a strategy of strengthening royal authority and the church&#x27;s position, and accepted the use of force to accomplish this. Mirabeau&#x27;s involvement with the court is as interesting for the insights it provides into the mind of Louis XVI as it is for the effects it produced in the Revolution.

On the question of the royal veto, Mirabeau took a practical view and, seeing that the royal power was already considerably weakened, declared for the king&#x27;s absolute veto and against the suspensive veto. He knew from his British experience that such a veto would be impractical unless the king knew the people were on his side, and that if it were used unjustifiably, the power of the purse possessed by the representatives of the people could bring about a bloodless revolution. The difference between the suspensive veto and the absolute was simple: the absolute veto gave the king the power to stop any law for an indefinite period of time. The suspensive veto, on the other hand, put limitations on the powers of the king. The final compromise was to allow the king a suspensive veto for a period of two years.

On the subject of peace and war, Mirabeau supported the king&#x27;s authority with some success. Again, almost alone in the Assembly, he held that the soldier ceased to be a citizen when he became a soldier; he must submit to the deprivation of his liberty to think and act and must recognize that a soldier&#x27;s first duty is obedience. With such sentiments, it is no wonder that he approved of the vigorous conduct of the marquis de Bouillé at Nancy, which was to his credit, as Bouillé was opposed to him.

Lastly, in matters of finance, he attacked Necker&#x27;s &quot;caisse d&#x27;escompte&quot;, which was to have the whole control of the taxes, as usurping the Assembly&#x27;s power of the purse, and heartily approved of the system of assignats, with the reservation that the issue should be limited to no more than one-half the value of the lands to be sold. 

He saw that much of the National Assembly&#x27;s inefficiency arose from the members&#x27; inexperience and their incurable verbosity. To establish some system of rules, he got his friend Samuel Romilly to draw up a detailed account of the rules and customs of the British House of Commons, which he translated into French, but which the Assembly refused to use.

===Jacobin Club===

In addition to his place in the National Assembly, Mirabeau also served as a member of the Jacobin Club until his death. However, historian Charles Kuhlmann believed that &quot;he was a Jacobin in name only and regarded the society as one of the chief obstacles in the way of his plans for the restoration of royal authority.&quot; In the end, the Jacobins would stand in his way of restoring royal authority, but in the early years of the revolution, Mirabeau was actually a leading figure in the Jacobin Club. Mirabeau reached the height of his influence within the club when he was elected its president in December 1790.

During his time in the Jacobin Club, he would have a lasting impact on the selling of church land, the slave trade, and the determination of which citizens could serve in the National Guard. Mirabeau argued for the selling of church lands to private individuals in order to rescue the country from its financial troubles. This argument would be strongly supported by his fellow Jacobins. Although Mirabeau argued for the abolition of slavery, it must be said that, &quot;in spite of their oft-expressed devotion for liberty and equality, the clubs long remained indifferent to the horrors of slavery and the slave trade&quot; until later in the revolution, after Mirabeau&#x27;s death. As for the National Guard, the National Assembly passed a decree on 6 December 1790 stating that only active citizens could serve on the National Guard. Due to &quot;an article of the electoral law of October, 1789, only persons whose annual tax amounted to the equivalent of three days&#x27; work were recognized as active citizens,&quot; leaving the decree of 6 December to restrict the right to bear arms to the middle and upper classes.

The decree of 6 December led to heated debates within the clubs of the Jacobins, especially in Paris. It also pitted Maximilien Robespierre, a rising political figure, against Mirabeau. The evening after the decree was passed, Robespierre would attempt to give a speech against the decree at the Jacobins club in Paris only to be stopped by Mirabeau. He &quot;attempted to stop him on the grounds that no one was allowed to challenge a decree already rendered&quot; by the National Assembly; however, after an hour and a half of uproar Robespierre was allowed to finish. Historians believe that Mirabeau tried to stop Robespierre because he had begun to notice the change in the revolution to a more radical form led by the radical members of the Jacobin party. Mirabeau would serve as a member of the more moderate group called the &quot;Société des amis de la Révolution de Paris&quot;, which was formed in November 1789. This group would disappear by 1790 due to conflict within the Jacobin Club.

After Mirabeau&#x27;s death, there would be no greater place of mourning than in the Jacobin Clubs throughout Paris. It is said that at &quot;Alençon tears ran from every eye and members fainted&quot; over hearing the news of his death. The mourning of Mirabeau as a Jacobin hero would not last long, however. After the deposing of the monarchy in 1792, the French republic would find letters in an iron chest written by Mirabeau to the king about trying to save the monarchy. This would lead to the destruction of his bust in the Jacobin Club and to his denunciation by Robespierre as &quot;an intriguer and political charlatan unworthy of the honor of lying in the Pantheon.&quot;

====Foreign affairs====

In foreign affairs, he held that the French people should conduct their revolution as they wished, and that no foreign nation had any right to interfere with the country&#x27;s internal affairs. But he knew that neighboring nations were disturbed by the progress of the revolution, feared its influence on their own peoples, and that foreign monarchs were being importuned by French émigrés to intervene on behalf of the French monarchy. To prevent this intervention, or rather to give no pretext for it, was the guiding principle in his foreign policy. He was elected a member of the &quot;comité diplomatique&quot; of the Assembly in July 1790, and in this capacity he was able to prevent the Assembly from doing much harm with regard to foreign affairs. He had long known Armand Marc, comte de Montmorin, the foreign secretary, and, as matters became more strained, he entered into daily communication with the minister, advising him on every point, and, while dictating his policy, defended it in the Assembly. Mirabeau&#x27;s exertions in this respect showed him to be a statesman; his influence is best demonstrated by the confused state of affairs in this area after his death.

==Death==
Mirabeau&#x27;s health had been damaged by the excesses of his youth and his strenuous work in politics, and in 1791, he contracted pericarditis. With the continuous medical attention paid to him by his friend and physician Pierre Jean George Cabanis, Mirabeau survived to perform his duties as president of the National Assembly until his death on 2 April 1791 in Paris. Even close to the end, he directed debates with eloquence that further increased his popularity. The people of Paris cherished him as one of the fathers of the Revolution. During the Trial of Louis XVI in 1792, Mirabeau&#x27;s dealings with the royal court were brought to light, and he was largely discredited by the public after it became known that he had secretly acted as an intermediary between the monarchy and the revolutionaries and had taken payment for it. Historians in the 21st century discovered secret documents in the archives of Vienna that demonstrate that the Austrian ambassador orchestrated the meetings with the king and queen. Florimond-Claude, comte de Mercy-Argenteau, the ambassador, was the queen&#x27;s political advisor, with advice tailored to the needs of Austria, not France.
He received a grand burial, and it was for him that the Panthéon in Paris was created as a burial place for great Frenchmen. The street where he died (rue de la Chaussée-d&#x27;Antin) was renamed &quot;rue Mirabeau&quot;. In 1792, his secret dealings with the king were uncovered, and in 1794 his remains were removed from the Panthéon and were replaced with those of Jean-Paul Marat. His remains were then buried anonymously in the graveyard of Clamart. In spite of searches performed in 1889, they were not found.

With Mirabeau&#x27;s death the task of saving the monarchy became much more difficult, as the king was less reconciled than he had ever been with the Revolution, and thus revolutionary leaders became less willing to share power with a king who proved so unwilling to compromise. Some historians, such as Francois Furet, however, believe that even had he lived, there would have been a similar outcome, as it would have been extremely difficult to remake the old monarchy in harmony with the growing democratic ideals of the age.

Mirabeau proved himself as one of the strongest early leaders of the revolution. His energy captivated his audience, his leadership was often the lead of the revolutionary ideas, while his work with the king stained his image. Mirabeau&#x27;s early life, though filled with the ideas of a young man revolting against a stern father, helped give him these qualities.

===Tributes===
Mirabeau B. Lamar, second president of The Republic of Texas and fourth United States Ambassador to Nicaragua, was named in his honor.

==Collaborators==
His first literary work written after the bombastic, but eloquent &quot;Essai sur le despotisme&quot; (Neufchâtel, 1775) was a translation of Robert Watson&#x27;s &quot;Philip II&quot;, done in Amsterdam with the help of Nicolas-Luton Durival. His &quot;Considerations sur l&#x27;ordre de Cincinnatus&quot; (London, 1788) was based on a pamphlet by Aedanus Burke of South Carolina, who opposed the aristocratic tendencies of the Society of the Cincinnati, and the notes to it were by Gui-Jean-Baptiste Target. His financial writings were suggested by the Genevese exile Étienne Clavière.

During the Revolution, he received yet more help; men were proud to labour for him, and did not murmur because he absorbed all the credit and fame. Étienne Dumont, Clavière, Antoine-Adrien Lamourette and Étienne Salonion Reybaz were but a few of the most distinguished of his collaborators. Dumont was a Genevese exile and old friend of Romilly who willingly prepared the famous addresses that Mirabeau used to make to the Assembly marked by sudden bursts of eloquent declamation; Clavière helped him in finance and not only worked out his figures, but also wrote his financial discourses; Lamourette wrote the speeches on the Civil Constitution of the Clergy; Reybaz not only wrote for him his famous speeches on the assignats, the organization of the national guard, and others, which Mirabeau read word for word at the tribune, but also even the posthumous speech on succession to the estates of intestates, which Talleyrand read in the Assembly as the last work of his dead friend.

==In popular culture==
Mirabeau was played by Sir Peter Ustinov in the 1989 film &quot;La Révolution française&quot;.

He was also portrayed in the popular video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Unity&quot; as the leader of the French brotherhood of Assassins.

Mirabeau also appeared as one of the characters in the Spiders 2022 game &quot;Steelrising&quot;.

<text>Leer is a district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the northwest and clockwise) the city of Emden, the districts of Aurich, Wittmund, Friesland, Ammerland, Cloppenburg and Emsland, and by the Netherlands (Province of Groningen).

==History==

In 1744, East Frisia was annexed by Prussia. In 1867, the region was subdivided into districts, and the districts of Leer and Weener were established. In 1932, these two districts were merged.

==Geography==

The District is located in the southern part of East Frisia. The Ems River runs through the District, coming out of the Emsland in the south and flowing into the Dollart, a bay of the North Sea. The island of Borkum, belonging to the East Frisian Islands, is also a part of the District. Some of the area of the District is in the Lower Saxony Wadden Sea National Park.

==Coat-of-arms==
The coat-of-arms is identical to the arms of the East Frisian chieftain dynasty Ukena, rulers of the area during the 15th century. Its blazon is: &quot;Arms: Azure, a lion rampant dexter-facing Argent armed and langued Gules, collared by a wreath of leaves proper. Crown: two plumes of wheat Vert divided by a four-leaf clover proper at center.&quot;

==Cities and municipalities==

Unincorporated Area&lt;br&gt;
The uninhabited island Lütje Hörn is also part of Leer district, but not part of any municipality (unincorporated area).

<doc id="146788" wikidata="Q238564" url="?curid=146788" title="We Are the Champions">
<text>&quot;We Are the Champions&quot; is a song by the British rock band Queen, released from the band&#x27;s sixth album &quot;News of the World&quot; (1977). Written by lead singer Freddie Mercury, it remains among rock&#x27;s most recognisable anthems. The song was a worldwide success, reaching number two in the UK, number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the US, number three in Canada, and the top ten in many other countries. In 2009, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and was voted the world&#x27;s favourite song in a 2005 Sony Ericsson world music poll.

Written with audience participation in mind, Mercury said &quot;We&quot; in the song&#x27;s title refers to everyone who is singing it. Brian May called the song &quot;unifying and positive&quot;. &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; has become an anthem for victories at sporting events, including as an official theme song for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, and has been often used or referenced in popular culture. The song has also been covered by many artists.

On 7 October 2017, Queen released a &quot;Raw Sessions&quot; version of the track to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the release of &quot;News of the World&quot;. It was made from previously unheard vocal and instrumental takes from the original multi-track tapes. It also presents for the first time the original recorded length of the track, which is two choruses more than the 1977 edited single.

==Music==
Written by Freddie Mercury, &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; was built on audience response following a concert at Bingley Hall, Stafford in which the audience sang &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; to the band. It embodies numerous elements of arena rock, with Brian May stating, &quot;We wanted to get the crowds waving and singing. It&#x27;s very unifying and positive.&quot;

Musically, it is based on Mercury&#x27;s piano part, with Roger Taylor and John Deacon providing a drums and bass guitar backing. May overdubbed some guitar sections, initially subtle, but building to a &quot;solo&quot; played simultaneously with the last chorus. Mercury employed many jazz chords (major and minor 6th, 7th, 9th, 11th and 13th harmonies), and the choruses featured these voiced as four- and five-part vocal harmonies. The lead vocal is very demanding and strident (highest point is a C5 both belted and in falsetto), with one of Mercury&#x27;s most notable performances taking place at the Live Aid concert, at Wembley Stadium, London in 1985.

The single featured &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, which preceded the song on the album, as its B-side. The two songs were often played consecutively at the close of Queen concerts, and are customarily played together on radio broadcasts (in album order). Keeping with tradition, the two songs were also used to close the 1992 Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert with all the show&#x27;s acts joining in behind the lead vocal of Liza Minnelli.

==Reception==
&quot;Cash Box&quot; said that it contains &quot;heroic lyrics and rapid changes in dynamics and emotional intensity&quot; and praised guitarist Brian May&#x27;s &quot;dark backing lines and rippling fills.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; called it a &quot;stately rocker well-suited to its title&quot; and suggested that &quot;it could serve as a sort of new wave anthem.&quot;

==Music video==
The video for &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; was filmed at a special video shoot with fan club members at the New London Theatre on 6 October 1977 and was directed by Derek Burbridge. Mercury performs in a trademark Harlequin outfit – a half black, half white version – in front of an enthusiastic crowd who wave Queen scarves in a manner similar to English football fans. An alternate version which starts in monochrome before blasting into colour as the drums and guitars kick in was broadcast on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops 2&quot; and comprises alternate footage shot on the same day.

==Legacy==

In 2011, a team of scientific researchers concluded that &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; was the catchiest song in the history of pop music, despite its not reaching #1 in the charts in any major market. Dr. Daniel Mullensiefen said of the study: &quot;Every musical hit is reliant on maths, science, engineering and technology; from the physics and frequencies of sound that determine pitch and harmony, to the hi-tech digital processors and synthesisers which can add effects to make a song catchier. We&#x27;ve discovered that there&#x27;s a science behind the sing-along and a special combination of neuroscience, math and cognitive psychology that can produce the elusive elixir of the perfect sing-along song.&quot;

The song is popular at sporting events, often being played after a major victory by the home team. For example, it was played at Highmark Stadium after the Buffalo Bills defeated the New England Patriots in the 2021 NFL playoffs.

==Chart performances==
In 1977–1978, &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; was released as a single in many countries, reaching number 2 on the UK Singles Chart. number 4 on &quot;Billboard&quot; in the US, number 3 in Canada, the top 10 in Ireland, Netherlands, and Norway, and the top 15 in Germany, Austria, and Sweden.

In 1992, 1993, and 1998, the single was re-released in France, totalling 45 weeks on the chart and peaking at #19, #14, and at #10 during the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

<text>East Frisia () or East Friesland (; ; ; ) is a historic region in the northwest of Lower Saxony, Germany. It is primarily located on the western half of the East Frisian peninsula, to the east of West Frisia and to the west of Landkreis Friesland.

Administratively, East Frisia consists of the districts Aurich, Leer and Wittmund and the city of Emden. It has a population of approximately 469,000 people and an area of .

There is a chain of islands off the coast, called the East Frisian Islands (). From west to east, these islands are Borkum, Juist, Norderney, Baltrum, Langeoog and Spiekeroog.

==History==

The geographical region of East Frisia was inhabited in Paleolithic times by reindeer hunters of the Hamburg culture. Later there were Mesolithic and Neolithic settlements of various cultures. The period after prehistory can only be reconstructed from archaeological evidence. Access to the early history of East Frisia is possible in part through archaeology and in part through the studying of external sources such as Roman documents.
The first proven historical event was the arrival of a Roman fleet under Drusus in 12 BC; the ships sailed into the course of the Ems river and returned.

The earlier settlements, known solely through material remnants but whose people&#x27;s name for themselves remains unknown, led up to the invasion of Germanic tribes belonging to the Ingvaeonic group. Those were Chauci mentioned by Tacitus, and Frisians. The region between the rivers Ems and Weser was thereupon inhabited by the Chauci; however, after the second century AD there is no mention of the Chauci. They were partly displaced by Frisian expansion after about 500, and were later partially absorbed into the Frisian society.

Saxons also settled the region and the East Frisian population of medieval times is based on a mixture of Frisian and Saxon elements. Nevertheless, the Frisian element is predominant in the coastal area, while the population of the higher Geest area expresses more Saxon influence.

Historical information becomes clearer by early Carolingian time, when a Frisian kingdom united the whole area from present-day West Frisia (the Dutch provinces of Friesland and Groningen and part of North Holland) throughout East Frisia up to the river Weser. It was ruled by kings like the famous Radbod whose known names were still mentioned in folk tales until recent times. Frisia was a short-lived kingdom, and it was crushed by Pippin of Herstal in 689. East Frisia then became part of the Frankish Empire. Charles the Great then divided East Frisia into two counties. At this time, Christianization by the missionaries Liudger and Willehad started; one part of East Frisia became a part of the diocese of Bremen, the other the diocese of Münster.

With the decay of the Carolingian empire, East Frisia lost its former bindings, and a unity of independent self-governed districts was established. Their elections were held every year to choose the &quot;Redjeven&quot; (councillors), who had to be judges as well as administrators or governors. This system prevented the establishment of a feudalistic system in East Frisia during medieval times. Frisians regarded themselves as free people not obliged to any foreign authority. This period is called the time of the &quot;Friesische Freiheit&quot; (Frisian freedom) and is represented by the still well-known salute &quot;Eala Frya Fresena&quot; (Get Up, Free Frisian!) that affirmed the non-existence of any feudality.
Frisian representatives of the many districts of the seven coastal areas of Frisia met once a year at the Upstalsboom, located at Rahe (near Aurich).

In the early Middle Ages, people could only settle on the higher situated &quot;Geest&quot; areas or by erecting in the marsh-areas &quot;Warften&quot;, artificial hills to protect the settlement, whether a single farming estate or a whole village, against the North Sea floods.

In about 1000 AD the Frisians started building large dikes along the North Sea shore. This had a great effect on establishing a feeling of national identity and independence. Until the late Middle Ages Ostfriesland resisted the attempts of German states to conquer the coasts.

During the 14th century adherence to the Redjeven constitution decayed. Catastrophes and epidemics such as pestilence intensified the process of destabilization. This provided an opportunity for influential family-clans to establish a new rule. As chieftains (in Low German: &quot;hovedlinge&quot;; in standard German: &quot;Fürsten&quot;) they took control over villages, cities, and regions in East Frisia; however, they still did not establish a feudal system as it was known in the rest of Europe. Instead, the system implemented in Frisia was a system of fellowship which has some similarity to older forms of rule known from Germanic cultures of the North. There was a specific relation of dependence between the inhabitants of the ruled area and the chieftain, but the people retained their individual freedom and could move where they wanted.

The Frisians controlled the mouth of the Ems river and threatened the ships coming down the river. For this reason the County of Oldenburg made several attempts to subjugate East Frisia during the 12th century. Thanks to the swampy terrain, the Frisian peasants defeated the Oldenburgian armies every time. In 1156 even Henry the Lion failed to conquer the region. The conflicts lasted for the next few centuries. In the 14th century Oldenburg gave up on plans to conquer Ostfriesland, restricting their attacks to irregular invasions, killing livestock then leaving.

The East Frisian chieftains used to provide shelter for pirates such as the famous Klaus Störtebeker and Gottfried Michaelsen, who were a threat to the ships of the powerful Hanseatic League which they attacked and robbed. In 1400 a punitive expedition of the Hanseatic League against East Frisia succeeded. The chieftains had to promise to discontinue their support for the pirates. In 1402 Störtebeker, who was not a Frisian by birth, was captured and executed in Hamburg.

The range of power and influence differed between the chieftains. Some clans achieved a predominant state. One of these was the Tom Broks from the Brokmerland (nowadays: Brookmerland) who ruled a large part of Eastern Friesland over several generations until a former follower, Focko Ukena from Leer, defeated the last Tom Brok. But a party of opposing chieftains under the leadership of the Cirksenas from Greetsiel defeated and expelled Fokko, who later died near Groningen.

After 1465 one of the last chieftains from the house of Cirksena was made a count by Emperor Frederick III and accepted the sovereignty of the Holy Roman Empire. However, in 1514 the emperor ordered that a duke of Saxony should be the heir to the count of East Frisia. Count Edzard of East Frisia refused to accept this order and was outlawed. Twenty-four German dukes and princes invaded Frisia with their armies. Despite their numerical superiority they failed to defeat Edzard, and in 1517 the emperor had to accept Edzard and his descendants as counts of East Frisia.

East Frisia played an important role in the Reformation period. Menno Simons, founder of the Mennonite church, found refuge there.

In 1654 the counts of East Frisia, seated at Aurich, were elevated to the rank of princes. Their power, however, remained limited because of a number of factors. Externally East Frisia became a satellite of the Netherlands, Dutch garrisons being stationed in different cities permanently. Important cities like Emden were autonomously administered by their citizens, the Prince not having much influence on them. A Frisian Parliament, the Ostfreesk Landschaft, was an assembly of different social groups of East Frisia, jealously protecting the traditional rights and freedoms of the Frisians against the Prince. East Frisian independence ended in 1744, when the region was taken over by Prussia after the last Cirksena prince had died without issue. There was no resistance to this takeover, since it had been arranged by contract beforehand. Prussia respected the traditional autonomy of the Frisians, governed by the Frisian chancellor Sebastian Homfeld.

In 1806 East Frisia (now called Oostfreesland) was annexed by the Napoleonic Kingdom of Holland and later became part of the French Empire. Most of East Frisia was renamed the Département Ems-Oriental, while a small strip of land, the Rheiderland, became part of the Dutch Département Ems-Occidental. The French Emperor Napoléon I undertook the greatest reform of Frisian society in history: He introduced mayors, where the local administration was still in the hands of autonomous groups of elders (like the Diekgreven, Kerkenolderlings etc.), introduced the Code Civil and reformed the ancient Frisian naming system by newly introducing family names in 1811. In the following years the East Frisians registered their family names, often depending on their father&#x27;s name, area or (if unfree) master.

After the Napoleonic Wars East Frisia was occupied first by Prussian and then by Russian soldiers and in 1813 was it was re-annexed by Prussia. However, in 1815, Prussia had to cede East Frisia to the Kingdom of Hanover, which itself was annexed by Prussia in 1866.

==Geography==
The landscape is influenced by its proximity to the North Sea. The East Frisian Islands stretch for 90 kilometres along the coast. They offer dunes and sand beaches, though in their center they have grass and woods as well. The area between the islands and the coast is unique in the world: the tide leaves a broad stretch of mudflat with creeks that attract an extraordinary number of species, worms and crabs as well as birds or seals. For this reason, the UNESCO World Heritage Fund declared the Wadden Sea, which had already been a national park, a global heritage site. Away from the coastal area, much of the physical geography is &quot;Geest&quot; and Heathland.

==Culture==
===Cuisine===
===Language===
The original language of East Frisia was East Frisian, which now is almost extinct, largely replaced by East Frisian Low Saxon. Original East Frisian survived somewhat longer in several remote places as for example in the islands, such as Wangerooge. Today a modern variant of East Frisian can be found in the Saterland, a district near East Frisia. In former times people from East Frisia who left their homes under pressure had settled in that remote area surrounded by moors and kept their inherited language alive. This language which forms the smallest language-island in Europe is called Saterland Frisian or, by its own name, &quot;Seeltersk&quot;. It is spoken by about 1000 people.

East Frisian Low Saxon (or Eastern Friesland Low Saxon, as some people prefer to say for a better distinction from East Frisian, which is Frisian but not Low Saxon) is a variant of Low German with many of its own features due to the Frisian substrate and some other influences originating in the varied history of East Frisia. It is similar to the Gronings dialect spoken in the adjacent Netherlands province of Groningen.

In modern Germany, East Frisians in general are the traditional butt of ethnic jokes similar to Polish jokes in the United States. This is mainly the case in the North.

===Tea===

In an otherwise coffee drinking country, East Frisia is noted for its consumption of tea and its tea culture. Per capita, the East Frisian people drink more tea than any other people group, about 300 litres per person every year.

Strong black tea is served whenever there are visitors to an East Frisian home or other gathering, as well as with breakfast, in mid-afternoon and mid-evening. The tea is sweetened with &quot;kluntjes&quot;, a rock candy sugar that melts slowly, allowing multiple cups to be sweetened. Heavy cream is also used to flavour the tea. The tea is generally served in traditional small cups, with little cookies during the week and cake during special occasions or on weekends as a special treat. Some of the most common traditional cakes and pastries to accompany tea are apple strudel, black forest cake, and other cakes flavored with chocolate and hazelnut.

Brown rum, mixed with &quot;kluntjes&quot; and left for several months, is also added to black tea in the winter. The tea is alleged to cure headaches, stomach problems, and stress, among many other ailments.

The tea is not only a kind of beverage for the population, but also part of its cultural tradition. Over the years the region developed a unique tea ceremony that can be strictly observed in older households. As a part of these rules, the oldest woman in the round has to serve the other guests with tea, starting with the second oldest and then going down in age regardless of gender. The &quot;kluntje&quot; must be placed inside the teacup before the tea is poured right on top of it. After that some heavy cream is added carefully just as a top layer so it can make &quot;clouds&quot; (wulkjes) that swim on the tea itself. It&#x27;s then forbidden to stir the tea, so the layers stay mild, strong and then sweet from top to bottom. Depending on the area of East Frisia, the tea can also be poured out of the cup into its saucer and drunk from there. If you don&#x27;t want any more tea, you have to put your spoon into the cup or else the host will refill your cup immediately after everyone in the round finished their current cup of tea.

===Religion===
East Frisia is predominantly Protestant. In Rheiderland, Krummhörn and around Emden, the Reformed Church (Calvinism) is the dominant church, while in Leer, Norden and Aurich the Lutherans are the dominant church. However, the main church of the Reformed Christians is in Leer. There are 266,000 Lutherans and about 80,000 Reformed – so about 346,000 of the approximately 465,000 citizens of East Frisia profess one of the two denominations. The Concordat of Emden in 1599 set rules for the cooperation of Lutherans and Calvinists in the county of East Frisia. Since then it is a special feature of the Protestant Landeskirchen in East Frisia, that Lutherans and Calvinists are members of each other&#x27;s local church communities in places, where only one of both exists.

==Economy==
East Frisia is a rural area. However, there are some industrial sites such as the Volkswagen car factory in Emden and the Enercon (windturbine) company in Aurich. Leer is, after Hamburg, the second most important location for shipping companies in Germany. Although just on the other side of the border to Emsland, the Meyer Werft is an important employer for East Frisians as well. Main industrial sites are the harbours of Emden and Leer, and Wilhelmshaven east of East Frisia.

Around 1900, many people left East Frisia due to lack of jobs and emigrated to the United States or elsewhere. Today the region is again suffering from the loss of young educated people, who go away to find better employment in, for example, southern Germany. Many communities face a rising number of aged people, creating structural problems in the future. There are few academic jobs in the area, and those are focused on engineering. The closest universities are the University of Oldenburg and Groningen. A Fachhochschule is located in Emden. The former nautical academy in Leer merged with Fachhochschule Emden in 2009.

== People ==

The people of East Frisia have close cultural ties to those of West Frisia, in the Netherlands, and of North Frisia, on the Jutland peninsula.

<text>A coast guard or coastguard is a maritime security organization of a particular country. The term embraces wide range of responsibilities in different countries, from being a heavily armed military force with customs and security duties to being a volunteer organization tasked with search and rescue without law enforcement authority. In most countries, a typical coast guard&#x27;s functions are distinct from those of the navy (a military service) and the transit police (a law enforcement agency), while in certain countries they have similarities to both.

==History==
===United Kingdom===

The predecessor of Britain&#x27;s modern His Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard was established in 1809 as the Waterguard, a department of the HM Customs and Excise authority, which was originally devoted to the prevention of smuggling. At the time, due to high UK taxation on liquors such as brandy, as well as tobacco and other luxuries, smuggling of such cargos from places such as France, Belgium, and Holland was an attractive proposition for criminals. The barrels of brandy and other contraband were landed from the ships on England&#x27;s beaches at night in small boats and later sold for profit, as later depicted in the Doctor Syn series of books by Russell Thorndike. The Coastguard was also responsible for giving assistance to shipwrecks.

Each Waterguard station was issued with a Manby mortar, which had been invented by Captain George William Manby in 1808. The mortar fired a shot with a line attached from the shore to the wrecked ship and was used for many years. This was the origin of the Coastguard&#x27;s life saving role. In 1821 a committee of inquiry recommended that responsibility for the Preventative Waterguard be transferred to the Board of Customs. The Treasury agreed and (in a memorandum dated 15 January 1822) directed that the preventative services, which consisted of the Preventative Water Guard, cruisers, and riding officers should be placed under the authority of the Board of Customs and in future should be named the &quot;Coastguard&quot;. In 1845 the Coastguard was subordinated to the Admiralty.
In 1829 the first UK Coastguard instructions were published and dealt with discipline and directions for carrying out preventative duties. They also stipulated that, when a ship was wrecked, the Coastguard was responsible for taking all possible action to save lives, to take charge of the vessel and to protect property.

===United States===
In the United States, the United States Coast Guard was created in 1915 by the merger of two other federal agencies. The first, the United States Revenue Cutter Service, founded in 1790 and known until 1894 as the United States Revenue-Marine, was a maritime customs enforcement agency that also assumed a supporting role to the United States Navy in wartime. The second, the United States Life-Saving Service, was formed in 1848 and consisted of life saving crews stationed at points along the United States East Coast. The Coast Guard later absorbed the United States Lighthouse Service in 1939 and the functions of the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection via a two-step process in 1942 and 1946.

==Role==
Among the responsibilities that may be entrusted to a coast guard service are:

* search and rescue,
* enforcement of maritime law,
* safety of vessels,
* maintenance of seamarks, and
* border control.

During wartime, some national coast guard organisations might have a role as a naval reserve force with responsibilities in harbor defenses, port security, naval counter-intelligence and coastal patrols.

The coast guard may, varying by jurisdiction, be a branch of a country&#x27;s military, a law enforcement agency, or a search and rescue body. For example, the United States Coast Guard is a specialized military branch with law enforcement authority, whereas the United Kingdom&#x27;s His Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard (HMCG) is a civilian organisation whose primary role is search and rescue. Most coast guards operate ships and aircraft including helicopters and seaplanes that are either owned or leased by the agency in order to fulfil their respective roles.

Some coast guards, such as the Irish Coast Guard, have only a very limited law enforcement role, usually in enforcing maritime safety law, such as by inspecting ships docked in their jurisdiction. In cases where the coast guard is primarily concerned with &quot;coordinating&quot; rather than executing rescue operations, lifeboats are often provided by civilian voluntary organisations, such as the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in the United Kingdom and Ireland, whilst aircraft may be provided by the countries&#x27; armed forces, such as the search and rescue Sea Kings formerly operated by the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy, in addition to any of the HMCG&#x27;s own helicopters.

== Racing stripes ==

Beginning in 1964 with the United States Coast Guard, many coast guards around the world have adopted high visibility color schemes to differentiate their coast guard vessels from the vessels of their respective navies. A frequent element is a high contrast &quot;racing stripe&quot; on the outer hull. While no international agreement exists to adopt it as a uniform marking, the 2009/2010 edition of &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; showed 61 nations had adopted some form of this stripe pattern for their coastal patrol and rescue vessels.

==List of coast guards by country==
The following lists a selected number of coast guards around the world, illustrating the varied roles they play in the respective governments and the countries they operate in:

===Argentina===
The Argentine Naval Prefecture, in Spanish &quot;Prefectura Naval Argentina&quot; or PNA, is a service of the Argentine Republic&#x27;s Security Ministry charged with protecting the country&#x27;s rivers, lakes and maritime territory. It therefore fulfills the functions of other countries&#x27; coast guards, and furthermore acts as a gendarmerie force policing navigable rivers and lakes. They belonged to the Ministry of Defence until the 1980s, and the corps&#x27; highest official was a Navy rear-admiral. They have since been transferred to the Ministry of Interior and, more recently, to the newly created Ministry of Security. However, in the case of armed conflict, they can be put under the Navy&#x27;s command.

===Australia===

Responsibilities for traditional coast guard duties in Australia are distributed across various federal, state and community volunteer agencies.

====Federal====
*The Maritime Border Command is the de facto coast guard of Australia. The Maritime Border Command is a joint unit of the Australian Defence Force (the Royal Australian Navy Patrol Force and the Royal Australian Air Force Surveillance and Response Group) and the Australian Border Force (Marine Unit and Coastwatch aircraft). It is responsible for border protection in the exclusive economic zone of Australia and its 19,650 kilometres of coastline and issues such as illegal fishing and exploitation of natural resources, maritime terrorism and piracy, biosecurity threats, and marine pollution. 
*The Australian Maritime Safety Authority is responsible for maritime safety and seaworthiness of Australian and foreign vessels in Australian waters including compulsory pilotage, aids to navigation, the Australian Rescue Coordination Centre and coordination of search and rescue operations, and management of Australia&#x27;s international maritime obligations.
*The Australian Fisheries Management Authority is responsible for the management and sustainable use of fisheries resources and for combating illegal fishing activities in the Australian Fishing Zone. 
*The Australian Federal Police supports the Maritime Border Command and particularly the Australian Border Force with criminal investigations, law enforcement and national security matters. 
*The Office of Transport Security has various responsibilities for maritime security.

====State====
Each State Government also has agencies with coast guard responsibilities. For example, in Queensland, Maritime Safety Queensland is responsible for maritime safety and the Queensland Police Service has a water police unit for law enforcement along the coastline, in waterways, and for Queensland islands.

====Community====
In addition, there are several private volunteer coast guard organizations, the two largest organizations being the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol (established in 1937) and the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard (established in 1961). These volunteer organizations have no law enforcement powers, and are essentially auxiliary Search and Rescue services. In NSW these two organisations have joined to become Marine Rescue in 2009.

===Bangladesh===

The Bangladesh Coast Guard (Bengali transliteration: বাংলাদেশ কোস্ট গার্ড; translated from English: &quot;বাংলাদেশ উপকূল রক্ষক&quot;); BCG is the maritime law enforcement force of Bangladesh. It is a paramilitary force which is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Home Affairs. Its officers are transferred from the Bangladesh Navy. The Bangladesh Coast Guard also performs the duty of maritime border security of Bangladesh. The headquarters is located in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Currently the coast guard has 3,339 personnel

===Barbados===
===Belize===

The Belize Coast Guard (BCG) mission includes maritime safety, maritime security, marine
resources protection, maintaining sovereignty over Belize sea space, and naval defence of Belize.

Coast Guard men and women are deployed around the clock patrolling the internal waters and territorial seas. On the northern frontier, their joint operating base at Consejo protects the local economy from the negative impacts of illegal contraband and acts as the northern cut off for drug trafficking. On their southern boundary they stand guard at the Sarstoon river ensuring sovereignty and territorial integrity of Belize. They stand ready for anything (Utrinque Paratus ).

The Coast Guard Service coordinates its activities with the Belize Defence Force and the Belize Police Department.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===

Having 18 kilometres of coastline only, Bosnia and Herzegovina does not have a force dedicated to defend its coast. The duty of patrolling its coastline falls to the ().

===Brazil===

In addition to the roles of a traditional navy, the Brazilian Navy also carries out the role of organizing the merchant navy and other operational safety missions traditionally conducted by a coast guard. Other roles include: Conducting national maritime policy, and implementing and enforcing laws and regulations with respect to the sea and inland waters.

===Canada===

The Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) is a civilian service under the Department of Fisheries and Oceans responsible for patrolling the world&#x27;s longest coastline of 243,042 km (~151,000 mi).

The CCG holds responsibility for all marine search and rescue throughout Canada. The CCG coordinates search and rescue operations with the Canadian Armed Forces, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and other organizations. The CCG maintains and operates seamarks, coastal light stations, vessel traffic services, marine pollution response services, marine communications systems, and provides icebreaking services. The CCG also operates all Federal scientific research and hydrographic survey vessels. To accomplish these tasks, the CCG has a sizable fleet of vessels and aircraft, all serviced from various bases and smaller stations located on three coasts (Atlantic, Arctic, Pacific) and the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River.

The Canadian Coast Guard College is located near Sydney, Nova Scotia.

===China===
The China Coast Guard (CCG) () serves as a coordinating body for maritime search and rescue in the territorial waters of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It was formed on 2013 as an amalgamation of four agencies: the Public Security Border Troops under the Ministry of Public Security, China Maritime Safety Administration, China Marine Surveillance, and China Fisheries Law Enforcement Command. In March 2018, it was placed under the leadership of the People&#x27;s Armed Police, which is under the direct command of the Central Military Commission (CMC).

====Hong Kong====
In Hong Kong, law enforcement duties are carried out by the Marine Region of the Hong Kong Police Force and the Customs and Excise Department (Ports and Maritime Command of the Boundary and Ports Branch). The Hong Kong Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre (HKMRCC) co-ordinates search and rescue vessels, aircraft and other resources of the Fire Services Department, Government Flying Service, Marine Department and the Marine Police.

====Macau====
In Macau, coast guard responsibilities fall under the purview of the Macau Customs Service, which is in charge of conducting CG duties.

The Marine and Water Bureau, which is under the Secretariat for Transport and Public Works (Macau), helps in coordinating search and rescue operations in the region. It&#x27;s done via the Search and Rescue Coordination Centre, formed under the Vessel Traffic Control Centre of Macao (Macao VTS).

=== Croatia ===

The Croatian Coast Guard () is a division of the Croatian Navy responsible for protecting the interests of the Republic of Croatia at sea. The Croatian Navy is composed of classical naval forces structured into a flotilla and the Coast Guard that solely consists of ships with peacetime duties, e.g. protection of ecology, fishing, control of tankers, ballast waters, combat against terrorism, trafficking of people, narcotics, and similar.

On September 13, 2007, the Croatian Parliament passed a bill establishing the Croatian Coast Guard. The Coast Guard&#x27;s mission is protect sovereign rights and carry out Croatia&#x27;s jurisdiction in the Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone, the continental shelf and the high seas. The Coast Guard will also monitor vessels sailing in the Croatian territorial waters. If vessels are caught violating Croatian or international regulations and disregard warnings by the Coast Guard, Coast Guard ships and airplanes are authorized to pursue them and if necessary open fire, while taking care not to jeopardize the lives of the vessel&#x27;s crew.

Under the law, the commander of the Coast Guard is a Navy officer who is appointed and relieved of duty by the president of the republic at the government&#x27;s proposal.

===Cyprus===
The Cyprus Port and Marine Police (Greek &quot;Λιμενική και Ναυτική Αστυνομία&quot; – &quot;Limeniki kai Nautiki Astinomia&quot;) fulfills the functions of other countries&#x27; coast guards for the Republic of Cyprus. Cyprus is an island country in the Eastern Mediterranean with about 1/3 of the island is under control of Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus after 1974 Cypriot coup d&#x27;état and following Turkish military Invasion based on Treaty of Guarantee (1960). Due to the country&#x27;s geopolitical situation, size, the recent discovery in 2011 of the Aphrodite gas field in its Exclusive Economic Zone and Cyprus Police being the main national Law enforcement agency, the duties and responsibilities of the Cyprus Port and Marine Police are many and sometimes complex. It is a unit of the Cyprus Police, which resides under the Ministry of Justice and Public Order (Cyprus). However it can support the Cyprus Navy in wartime which resides under the Ministry of Defence. It is staffed by Police Officers which can be transferred to and from other units and agencies of the Cyprus Police and are tasked with the primary mission of policing the country&#x27;s sea borders and the law enforcement of the waters around it. The unit is equipped with patrol boats and radars but it does not operate its own helicopters. Instead, it operates in combination with the aerial unit of the Cyprus Police, the Cyprus Police Aviation Unit. Main roles include law enforcement against illicit activities such as smuggling (due to the fact that although the Customs and Excise Department is a separate agency under the Ministry of Finance, it does not have an operational or tactical team of its own), terrorism, piracy, illegal fishing, Illegal drug trade, illegal immigration and is also assigned with search and rescue (SAR) duties. For counter-terrorism and anti-piracy operations, the units operate in combination with the Special Anti-Terrorist Squad which is part of the Emergency Response Unit of the Cyprus Police. Although the prominent agencies responsible for all Search and Rescue operations are conducted by Cyprus Police Units, the agency responsible to organize the SAR system, to co-ordinate, to control and direct SAR operations in the region that the Republic of Cyprus is responsible for (which coincides with the Nicosia FIR) is the Cyprus Joint Rescue Coordination Center or JRCC Larnaca, which is an independent agency of the Ministry of Defence.

===Djibouti===

The Djiboutian Coast Guard, part of the Djiboutian Armed Forces, is a humanitarian and security service. It protects Djibouti&#x27;s borders and economic and security interests and defends its territorial waters and its Exclusive Economic Zone.

===Egypt===

The Egyptian Coast Guard, part of the Egyptian Navy, is responsible for the onshore protection of public installations near the coast and the patrol of coastal waters to prevent smuggling.

===France===
In the French Republic, &quot;Affaires maritimes&quot; is the closest organization to a coast guard. In each region, a naval admiral, called Maritime Prefect, is in charge of coordination of all state services for action at sea by the Navy, the &quot;Affaires maritimes&quot;, the Maritime Gendarmerie and the Coastguard Service of the French Customs. A charity, Société Nationale de Sauvetage en Mer, provides most life saving duties at the local level.

===Georgia===

The Georgian Coast Guard is the maritime arm of the Georgian Border Police, within the Ministry for Internal Affairs. It is responsible for the maritime protection of the entire coastline of Georgia, as well as the Georgian territorial waters. The primary missions of the service are administration of the territorial waters, marine pollution protection, maritime law enforcement, search and rescue, port security and maritime defense. The former Georgian Navy was absorbed into the Coast Guard in 2009.

The headquarters and a principal Coast Guard base are located at the Black Sea port of Poti. A second smaller base is in Batumi, Adjaria. Besides the Poti-based force, the Coast Guard also includes a special counter-terrorist Detachment. Maritime surveillance radar stations are maintained at Anaklia, Poti, Supsa, Chakvi, and Gonio, providing coverage of all territorial seas.

===Germany===

The German Federal Coast Guard, known as the &quot;Küstenwache,&quot; is both a civilian service and a law enforcement organisation, staffed with both police officers and certain civilians from the various German federal agencies associated with maritime administration with responsibility for the coordination of all law enforcement activities within its jurisdiction in the Federal Republic of Germany.

===Greece===

The &quot;Hellenic Coast Guard&quot; () is the national coast guard of the Republic of Greece. It is a paramilitary organization that can support the Hellenic Navy in wartime, but resides under separate civilian control in times of peace. It was founded in 1919 by an Act of Parliament and the legal framework for its function was reformed in 1927.

===Haiti===

The Haitian Coast Guard is an operational unit of the Haitian National Police. It is one of the few law enforcement organisations in the world to combine water policing and coast guard duties while remaining as a policing unit.

It is a Category 1 emergency responder alongside the United Kingdom&#x27;s regional police, fire, and ambulance services.

Lifeboat services are provided by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, or other independent lifeboat stations not affiliated with the RNLI, all under the coordination of the Coastguard. HM Coastguard wet leases commercial helicopters — Sikorsky S-92s and AgustaWestland AW189s — to provide aerial search and rescue cover around Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as well as the United Kingdom&#x27;s emergency towing vessel fleet in areas not served by tug brokers. On the coastline, HM Coastguard maintains a network of cliff and mud rescue teams, comprising around 4,000 volunteers, and can call upon the National Coastwatch Institution which mans many former Coastguard lookout stations around the coast. It is part of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, which in itself is an executive agency of the Department for Transport.

===United States===


Formed in 1915 by the merger of the United States Revenue Cutter Service (established as the United States Revenue-Marine in 1790 and renamed in 1894) and the United States Life-Saving Service (established in 1848), and later absorbing the United States Lighthouse Service in 1939 and the functions of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation in 1942 and 1946, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) is a military service, a law enforcement agency, and regulatory agency. It is one of the eight uniformed services of the United States and one of the six services of the United States Armed Forces. Its role includes enforcement of U.S. maritime law, coastal defense, search and rescue, environmental protection, aids to navigation, and regulation of maritime industries.

During peacetime the USCG falls under the administration of the United States Department of Homeland Security (previously the U.S. Department of Transportation, 1967–2003, and the United States Department of the Treasury, 1915–1967). During wartime, the USCG may, at the direction of the president of the United States, report to the Secretary of the Navy; its resources, however, are integrated into U.S. military operations in wartime (see ).

, the Coast Guard had 40,757 coast guardsmen on active duty, 6,240 reservists, approximately 26,000 auxiliarists, and over 7,100 full-time civilian employees. The Coast Guard maintains an extensive fleet of 243 coastal and ocean-going patrol ships, tenders, tugs and icebreakers called &quot;Cutters&quot;, and 1650 smaller boats, as well as an extensive aviation division consisting of 201 helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. While the U.S. Coast Guard is next to the smallest of the U.S. armed service branches, in terms of size, the U.S. Coast Guard is the world&#x27;s largest coast guard.

USCG helicopters are equipped with hoists to rescue survivors and also play a major role in law enforcement. The helicopters are able to land and take off from USCG cutters, making them an indispensable tool in fighting illegal drug traffic and the influx of undocumented immigrants attempting to illegally enter the country. The fixed-wing aircraft are used for long range search and rescue and law enforcement patrols. A construction and repair shipyard has been maintained since 1899 in the Baltimore Harbor area at Curtis Bay, United States Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay, Maryland.

Today&#x27;s lighthouses on the American coasts are all maintained by the U.S. Coast Guard, from the previous old U.S. Lighthouse Service. The list of active light houses, lighted beacons, etc. that provide detailed information on aids to navigation with their locations and characteristic signals is currently maintained by the U.S. Coast Guard in its Light List issued each year.

The USCG has a small service academy, equivalent to both the United States Military Academy and the United States Naval Academy in terms of students earning a 4-year degree and commission upon graduation. The United States Coast Guard Academy is much smaller in size (approx. 1,000 students) and is located at New London, Connecticut. All enlisted coast guardsmen attend boot camp at Cape May, New Jersey.

Several other federal, state and local agencies operate maritime police and security units with law enforcement and search and rescue functions similar to the Coast Guard. Examples include the New Hampshire Marine Patrol and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Air and Marine Operations, along with state Naval Militia.

===Uruguay===
In the Republic of Uruguay, the Coast Guard () is a part of the Navy. It is tasked with the broader enforcement of maritime laws, especially against smuggling, illegal fishing, drug trafficking and piracy. It patrols the country&#x27;s coastline, and is also involved in maritime search and rescue (SAR) missions, as well as the protection of the marine environment.
The Uruguayan Coast Guard also frequently patrols coast areas via-foot and on patrol vehicles which they are assigned jurisdictions which are called Subprefecturas. Prefectura is also responsible for the International Port of Montevideo operability.
Even though the Uruguayan Coast guard is a Military Organization they frequently help out law enforcement agencies.

It must also maintain the safety of navigation and be a maritime authority on rivers, the Atlantic Ocean, The River Plate and lakes in the jurisdiction of the Navy and intervene in the flagging of vessels.

In 2015, there are plans for the Uruguayan Coast Guard to pass and depend entirely on the Ministry of Interior, meaning it would not be a military unit anymore.

===Vietnam===
Vietnam Coast Guard (VCG; ) is directly under the administration of the Vietnamese Government, and it patrols and controls in accordance with the laws of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and international treaties concerned such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Besides maritime search and rescue (SAR) missions, Vietnam Coast Guard missions include protection the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the waters of Vietnam; protection of natural resources; prevention of environmental pollution; detection and prevention of acts of smuggling, piracy and illegal transportation and trafficking of illegal narcotics or precursors.

Besides the mentioned &quot;official coast guard&quot;, Vietnam also organizes an alternative maritime law enforcement force, which is the Vietnam Fisheries Surveillance. While theoretically focusing at counter illegal fishing behaviors and administer fisheries activities in the Vietnamese water corresponding to its name, the Fisheries Surveillance also shares VCG&#x27;s missions to perform SAR and represents Vietnam&#x27;s national interest and sovereignty exercises in the sea with its strong fleet of more than 100 medium-sized patrol vessels.

<text>New York Dolls were an American rock band formed in New York City in 1971. Along with the Velvet Underground and the Stooges, they were one of the first bands of the early punk rock scenes. Although the band never achieved much commercial success and their original line-up fell apart quickly, the band&#x27;s first two albums—&quot;New York Dolls&quot; (1973) and &quot;Too Much Too Soon&quot; (1974)—became among the most popular cult records in rock. The line-up at this time consisted of vocalist David Johansen, guitarist Johnny Thunders, bassist Arthur Kane, guitarist and pianist Sylvain Sylvain, and drummer Jerry Nolan; the latter two had replaced Rick Rivets and Billy Murcia, respectively, in 1972. On stage, they donned an androgynous wardrobe, wearing high heels, eccentric hats, satin, makeup, spandex, and dresses. Nolan described the group in 1974 as &quot;the Dead End Kids of today&quot;.

After reuniting, they recruited new musicians to tour and record. They released three more albums—&quot;One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This&quot; (2006), &quot;Cause I Sez So&quot; (2009) and &quot;Dancing Backward in High Heels&quot; (2011). Following a 2011 British tour with Alice Cooper, the band once again disbanded.

==History==
=== Formation ===
Sylvain Sylvain and Billy Murcia, who went to junior high school and high school together, started playing in a band called &quot;the Pox&quot; in 1967. After the frontman quit, Murcia and Sylvain started a clothing business called Truth and Soul and Sylvain took a job at A Different Drummer, a men&#x27;s boutique that was across the street from the New York Doll Hospital, a doll repair shop. Sylvain said that the shop inspired the name for their future band. In 1970 they formed a band again and recruited Johnny Thunders to join on bass, though Sylvain ended up teaching him to play guitar. They called themselves the Dolls. When Sylvain left the band to spend a few months in London, Thunders and Murcia went their separate ways.

Thunders was eventually recruited by Kane and Rick Rivets, who had been playing together in the Bronx. At Thunders&#x27; suggestion, Murcia replaced the original drummer. Thunders played lead guitar and sang for the band Actress. An October 1971 rehearsal tape recorded by Rivets was released as &quot;Dawn of the Dolls.&quot; When Thunders decided that he no longer wanted to be the front man, David Johansen joined the band. Initially, the group was composed of singer David Johansen, guitarists Johnny Thunders and Rick Rivets (who was replaced by Sylvain Sylvain after a few months), bass guitarist Arthur &quot;Killer&quot; Kane and drummer Billy Murcia. The original line-up&#x27;s first performance was on Christmas Eve 1971 at a homeless shelter, the Endicott Hotel. After getting a manager and attracting some music industry interest, the New York Dolls got a break when Rod Stewart invited them to open for him at a London concert.

While on a brief tour of England in 1972, Murcia was invited to a party, where he passed out from an overdose. He was put in a bathtub and force-fed coffee in an attempt to revive him. Instead, it resulted in asphyxiation. He was found dead on the morning of November 6, 1972, at the age of 21.

=== Record deal: 1972–1975 ===

Once back in New York, the Dolls auditioned drummers, including Marc Bell (who was to go on to play with Richard Hell, and with the Ramones under the stage name &quot;Marky Ramone&quot;), Peter Criscuola (better known as Peter Criss, the original and former drummer of Kiss), and Jerry Nolan, a friend of the band. They selected Nolan, and after US Mercury Records&#x27; A&amp;R man Paul Nelson signed them, they began sessions for their debut album. In 1972, the band took on Marty Thau as manager.

&quot;New York Dolls&quot; was produced by singer-songwriter, musician and solo artist Todd Rundgren. In an interview in &quot;Creem&quot; magazine, Rundgren says he barely touched the recording; everybody was debating how to do the mix. Sales were sluggish, especially in the middle US, and a &quot;Stereo Review&quot; magazine reviewer in 1973 compared the Dolls&#x27; guitar playing to the sound of lawnmowers. America&#x27;s mass rock audience&#x27;s reaction to the Dolls was mixed. In a &quot;Creem&quot; magazine poll, they were elected both best and worst new group of 1973. The Dolls also toured Europe, and, while appearing on UK television, host Bob Harris of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; derided the group as &quot;mock rock&quot;, comparing them unfavorably to the Rolling Stones.

For their next album, &quot;Too Much Too Soon&quot;, the quintet hired producer George &quot;Shadow&quot; Morton, whose productions for the Shangri-Las and other girl-groups in the mid-1960s had been among the band&#x27;s favorites.
=== Dissolution: 1975–1976 ===

By 1975, the Dolls were playing smaller venues than they had been previously. Drug and alcohol abuse by Thunders, Nolan, and Kane, as well as artistic differences added to the tensions among members. In late February or early March, Malcolm McLaren became their informal manager. He got the band red leather outfits to wear on stage and a communist flag as backdrop (communist chic). The Dolls did a five-concert tour of New York&#x27;s five boroughs, supported by Television and Pure Hell. The Little Hippodrome (Manhattan) show was recorded and released by New Rose Records subsidiary Fan Club in 1984 as &quot;Red Patent Leather&quot;, which was previously a bootleg album later remixed by Sylvain for official release, with former manager Marty Thau credited as executive producer. Due to Kane being unable to play that night, roadie Peter Jordan played bass, though he was credited as having played &quot;second bass&quot;. Jordan filled in for Kane when he was unable to play numerous times, such as following a thumb injury sustained prior to the band&#x27;s 1973 West Coast dates.

In March and April, McLaren took the band on a tour of South Carolina and Florida. Jordan replaced Kane for most of those shows. Thunders and Nolan left after an argument, forming The Heartbreakers with Richard Hell on April 11. Subsequently, Blackie Lawless, then known by his birth name of Steven Duren, who later founded W.A.S.P., replaced Thunders for the remainder of the tour after which the band broke up. Following the tour&#x27;s conclusion and announcement of the band&#x27;s breakup on April 25, Duren and Kane moved to Los Angeles to form the short-lived band Killer Kane.

The band reformed in July for an August tour in Japan with Jeff Beck and Felix Pappalardi. Johansen, Sylvain and Jordan were joined by former Elephant&#x27;s Memory keyboardist Chris Robison and drummer Tony Machine. One of the shows was documented on the album &quot;Tokyo Dolls Live&quot; (Fan Club/New Rose). The material is similar to that on &quot;Red Patent Leather&quot;, but notable for a radically re-arranged &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and a cover of Big Joe Turner&#x27;s &quot;Flip Flop Fly&quot;. The album is undated and has no production credit, but was issued circa 1986.

After their return to New York, the Dolls resumed playing shows in the US and Canada. Mercury dropped the Dolls on 7 October 1975, their contract with Mercury having expired on 8 August 1975 - five months after Thunders&#x27; and Nolan&#x27;s departures from the band.
Their show at the Beacon Theatre, on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1975 met with great critical acclaim. After a drunken argument with Sylvain, Robison was fired and replaced by pianist/keyboardist Bobbie Blaine formerly a member of Street Punk. The group toured throughout 1976, performing a set including some songs with lyrics by David Johansen that would later appear on David Johansen&#x27;s solo albums including &quot;Funky But Chic&quot;, &quot;Frenchette&quot; and &quot;Wreckless Crazy&quot;. The group played its last show December 30, 1976 at Max&#x27;s Kansas City; on the same bill as Blondie.

=== Individual endeavors: 1975–2004 ===
Shortly after returning from Florida, Thunders and Nolan formed The Heartbreakers with bassist Richard Hell, who had left Television the same week that they quit the Dolls. Thunders later pursued a solo career. He died in New Orleans on 23 April 1991, allegedly of an overdose of both heroin and methadone. It also came to light that he suffered from t-cell leukemia. Nolan died on 14 January 1992 following a stroke, brought about by bacterial meningitis. In 1976, Kane and Blackie Lawless formed the Killer Kane Band in Los Angeles. Immediately after the New York Dolls&#x27; second breakup, Johansen began a solo career. By the late 1980s, he achieved moderate success under the pseudonym, Buster Poindexter. Sylvain formed The Criminals, a popular band at CBGB.

A posthumous New York Dolls album, &quot;Lipstick Killers&quot;, made up of early demo tapes of the original Dolls (with Billy Murcia on drums), was released in a cassette-only edition on ROIR Records in 1981, and subsequently re-released on CD, and then on vinyl in early 2006. All the tracks from this title – sometimes referred to as &quot;The Mercer Street Sessions&quot; (though actually recorded at Blue Rock Studio, New York) – are included on the CD &quot;Private World&quot;, along with other tracks recorded elsewhere, including a previously unreleased Dolls original, &quot;Endless Party&quot;. Three more unreleased studio tracks, including another previously unreleased Dolls original, &quot;Lone Star Queen&quot;, are included on the &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; album. The other two are covers: the &quot;Courageous Cat&quot; theme, from the original &quot;Courageous Cat&quot; cartoon series; and a second attempt at &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess With Cupid&quot;, a song written by Steve Cropper and Eddie Floyd for Otis Redding, and first recorded independently for what was later to become the Mercer Street/Blue Rock Sessions.

Johansen formed the David Johansen Group, and released a self-titled LP in 1978, recorded at the Bottom Line in NYC&#x27;s Greenwich Village,featuring Sylvain Mizrahi and Johnny Thunders as guest musicians. In May, 1978, he also released &quot;David Johansen&quot;, on Blue Sky Records, a label created by Steve Paul, formerly of The Scene. Johansen continued to tour with his solo project and released four more albums, &quot;In Style,&quot; 1979; &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot;, 1981; &quot;Live it&quot; &quot;Up,&quot; 1982; and &quot;Sweet Revenge&quot;, 1984. During the later 1980s, Johansen, ever-evolving, decided to try to liberate himself from the expectations of his New York Dolls perceived persona, and, on a whim, created the persona Buster Poindexter. The success of this act led him to be invited to appear in multiple films: &quot;Scrooged&quot;, &quot;Freejack&quot;, and &quot;Let it Ride&quot;, among others. He also formed a band called David Johansen and the Harry Smiths, named after the eccentric ethnomusicologist, performing jump blues, Delta blues, and some original songs.

Sylvain formed his own band, the Criminals, then cut a solo album for RCA, while also working with Johansen. He later became a taxicab driver in New York. During this period, in the early 1990s, Sylvain moved to Los Angeles and recorded one album &quot;Sleep Baby Doll,&quot; on Fishhead Records. His band, for that record, consisted of Brian Keats on drums, Dave Vanian&#x27;s Phantom Chords, Speediejohn Carlucci (who had played with the Fuzztones), and Olivier Le Baron on lead guitar. Guest appearances by Frank Infante of Blondie and Derwood Andrews of Generation X were also included on the record. It has been re-released as &quot;New York A Go Go,&quot;.

=== Reunion, return to recording, second dissolution: 2004–2011 ===
Morrissey, having been a longtime fan of the band and head of their 1970s UK fan club, organized a reunion of the three surviving members of the band&#x27;s classic line-up (Johansen, Sylvain and Kane) for the Meltdown Festival in London on June 16, 2004. The reunion led to a live LP and DVD on Morrissey&#x27;s Attack label, as well as a documentary film, &quot;New York Doll&quot;, on the life of Arthur Kane. However, future plans for the Dolls were affected by Kane&#x27;s sudden death from leukemia just weeks later on July 13, 2004. Yet the following month the band appeared at Little Steven&#x27;s Underground Garage Festival on August 14 in New York City before returning to the UK to play several more festivals through the remainder of 2004.

In July 2005, the two surviving members announced a tour and a new album entitled &quot;One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This.&quot; Released on July 25, 2006, the album featured guitarist Steve Conte, bassist Sami Yaffa (ex-Hanoi Rocks), drummer Brian Delaney and keyboardist Brian Koonin, formerly a member of David Johansen and the Harry Smiths. On July 20, 2006, the New York Dolls appeared on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien,&quot; followed by a live performance in Philadelphia at the WXPN All About The Music Festival, and on July 22, 2006, a taped appearance on &quot;The Henry Rollins Show&quot;. On August 18, 2006, the band performed in a free concert at New York&#x27;s Seaport Music.

In October 2006, the band embarked on a UK tour, with Sylvain taking time while in Glasgow to speak to John Kilbride of STV. The discussion covered the band&#x27;s history and the current state of their live show and songwriting, with Sylvain commenting that &quot;even if you come to our show thinking &#x27;how can it be like it was before,&#x27; we turn that around &#x27;cos we&#x27;ve got such a great live rock &#x27;n roll show&quot;. In November 2006, the Dolls began headlining &quot;Little Steven&#x27;s Underground Garage Presents the Rolling Rock and Roll Show,&quot; about 20 live gigs with numerous other bands. In April 2007, the band played in Australia and New Zealand, appearing at the V Festival with Pixies, Pet Shop Boys, Gnarls Barkley, Beck, Jarvis Cocker and Phoenix.

On September 22, 2007, the New York Dolls were removed from the current artists section of Roadrunner Records&#x27; website, signifying the group&#x27;s split with the label. The band played the O2 Wireless Festival in Hyde Park, London on July 4, 2008, with Morrissey and Beck and the Lounge On The Farm Festival on July 12, 2008. On November 14, 2008, it was announced that the producer of their first album, Todd Rundgren, would be producing a new album, which would be followed by a world tour. The finishing touches on the album were made in Rundgren&#x27;s studio on the island of Kauai. The album, &quot;Cause I Sez So&quot;, was released on May 5, 2009 on Atco Records.
The band played at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas on March 21, 2009, and a show at London&#x27;s 100 Club on May 14, 2009 supported by Spizzenergi.
On March 18, 2010, the band announced another two concert dates at KOKO in Camden, London and the Academy in Dublin on April 20. In December 2010, it was announced the band would release their fifth album which had been recorded in Newcastle upon Tyne. The album, &quot;Dancing Backward in High Heels&quot;, featuring new guitarist Frank Infante (formerly of Blondie) was released on March 15, 2011.

On March 1, 2011, it was announced the New York Dolls would be the opening act for a summer tour featuring Mötley Crüe and Poison. They announced a new lineup for the tour, featuring guitarist Earl Slick, who held previous stints with David Bowie and John Lennon, bassist Kenny Aaronson, who had toured with Bob Dylan, and drummer Jason Sutter, formerly of Foreigner.

Between late March and October 2011, the band undertook the &quot;Dancing Backward in High Heels World Tour&quot;. This included dates in England, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, France, Spain and Australia. In the last week of October four additional gigs – billed as &quot;Halloween Night Of Fear – were played in the UK, concluding at the Clyde Auditorium, Glasgow on October 31.

In a 2016 interview, Earl Slick confirmed that the New York Dolls had again split. &quot;Oh, yeah, it&#x27;s long gone. There was no point in doing it anymore and it was kinda spent. You know, David really does enjoy the Buster thing. He&#x27;s so good at it. I&#x27;ve seen him do it a couple of times this last year, and man! He&#x27;s got it down, you know.&quot;

Sylvain Sylvain died on January 13, 2021, at age 69. 

David Johansen&#x27;s family announced in February 2025 that he was battling stage four cancer, a brain tumor and a broken back. Johansen died at the age of 75 on February 28, 2025. He was the last surviving original member of the band.

== Musical style ==

According to AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the New York Dolls developed an original style of hard rock that presaged both punk rock and heavy metal music, and drew on elements such as the &quot;dirty rock &amp; roll&quot; of the Rolling Stones, the &quot;anarchic noise&quot; of the Stooges, the glam rock of David Bowie and T. Rex, and girl group pop music. Erlewine credited the band for creating punk rock &quot;before there was a term for it&quot;. Ken Tucker, who referred to them as a proto-punk band, wrote that they were strongly influenced by the &quot;New York sensibility&quot; of Lou Reed: &quot;The mean wisecracks and impassioned cynicism that informed the Dolls&#x27; songs represented an attitude that Reed&#x27;s work with the Velvet Underground embodied, as did the Dolls&#x27; distinct lack of musicianship.&quot;

When they began performing, four of the band&#x27;s five members wore spandex and platform boots, while Johansen—the band&#x27;s lyricist and &quot;conceptmaster&quot;— often preferred high heels and a dress occasionally. Fashion historian Valerie Steele said that, while the majority of the punk scene pursued an understated &quot;street look&quot;, the New York Dolls followed an English glam rock &quot;look of androgyny—leather and knee-length boots, chest hair, and bleach&quot;. According to James McNair of &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;when they began pedalling their trashy glam-punk around lower Manhattan in 1971, they were more burlesque act than band; a bunch of lipsticked, gutter chic-endorsing cross-dressers&quot;. Music journalist Nick Kent argued that the New York Dolls were &quot;quintessential glam rockers&quot; because of their flamboyant fashion, while their technical shortcomings as musicians and Johnny Thunders&#x27; &quot;trouble-prone presence&quot; gave them a punk-rock reputation.

By contrast, Robert Christgau preferred for them to not be categorized as a glam rock band, but instead as &quot;the best hard-rock band since the Rolling Stones&quot;. Robert Hilburn, writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, said that the band exhibited a strong influence from the Rolling Stones, but had distinguished themselves by &quot;Too Much Too Soon&quot; (1974) as &quot;a much more independent, original force&quot; because of their &quot;definite touch of the humor and carefreeness of early (ie. mid-1950s) rock&quot;. Simon Reynolds felt that, by their 2009 album &quot;Cause I Sez So&quot;, the band exhibited the sound &quot;not of the sloppy, rambunctious Dolls of punk mythology but of a tight, lean hard-rock band.&quot;

==Legacy==

According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; (1995), the New York Dolls were &quot;one of the most influential rock bands of the last 20 years&quot;. Writer Sean Sennett credited the band as a part of a legacy of raunchy, influential rock bands predated by the Rolling Stones, and succeeded by Aerosmith and Hanoi Rocks and eventually Guns N&#x27; Roses. By the time the band&#x27;s debut album was released, they had already spawned a number of derivative bands in New York including the Stilettos, the Brats, Teenage Lust and the Harlots. Two of the earliest groups that they inspired were Kiss and Aerosmith, which would in turn become two of the most influential bands in rock music, especially hard rock and heavy metal. Hanoi Rocks&#x27; music and aesthetic too were heavily inspired by the New York Dolls and would go on to have a significant influence themselves.

The New York Dolls were the catalyst for New York&#x27;s early punk rock scene, which included Television, Talking Heads, Patti Smith, the Ramones, Blondie and Richard Hell and the Voidoids, in addition to being one of the most influential bands to the development of British punk rock, particularly the Sex Pistols, the Clash and the Damned. In &quot;Lonely Boy: Tales from a Sex Pistol&quot;, guitarist Steve Jones cited the New York Dolls as one of the most influential bands on the Sex Pistols style, and in a 2023 interview with &quot;Spin&quot;, Dave Vanian of the Damned listed the New York Dolls&#x27; self-titled album as one of his five albums &quot;I Can&#x27;t Live Without&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; writer Ian Gittins called the album &quot;the Year Zero of punk rock&quot;. The band continued to inspire punk bands as the genre progressed, with the Misfits, Social Distortion and Green Day all recalling their influence.

In the 1980s, the influence of the New York Dolls helped to form the glam metal genre. In particular, the band&#x27;s androgynous aesthetic and wearing of spandex, dresses, high heels and teased hair were widely imitated amongst bands in the genre. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; writer Tim Stegall even credited the band as having invented the look of glam metal, and in &quot;Baker&#x27;s Biographical Dictionary of Musicians&quot;, Hank Bordowitz called the band the progenitors of hair metal and &quot;the most important band that most people never heard&quot;. Prominent glam metal bands to take influence from the New York Dolls included Mötley Crüe, Poison, Ratt, Skid Row and Twisted Sister. With the increasing commercialisation of glam metal as the 1980s progressed, a number of bands from within its scene formed a new sound with a greater emphasis on the influence of the New York Dolls, namely Guns N&#x27; Roses, L.A. Guns and Faster Pussycat.

Other musicians to cite the New York Dolls as an influence include the Smiths and their vocalist Morrissey, the Undertones, Joan Jett &amp; the Blackhearts, David Bowie, Japan, D Generation, Billy Idol, Terry Chambers of XTC, Def Leppard, R.E.M., the Replacements, Soul Asylum, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Bruce Fairweather and Stone Gossard of Green River and Mother Love Bone (the latter also of Pearl Jam), Ruby and the Rednecks, Hollywood Brats, Hoodoo Gurus, the Scientists, Palaye Royale, Marilyn Manson, Jetboy, Rock City Angels, the Cramps, the Libertines and the Manic Street Preachers.

<text>The Esperantic Studies Foundation, abbreviated ESF, is a non-profit organisation initiated in 1968 by Jonathan Pool, E. James Lieberman and Humphrey Tonkin, with the aim to further the understanding and practice of linguistic justice in a multicultural world, with a special focus on the study of interlinguistics and the role of Esperanto.

Under the banner &quot;For linguistic justice in a multicultural world,&quot; ESF supports education and research programs that promote linguistic justice and equality. ESF aims to create environments in which languages are treated as equal and communication occurs in a non-discriminatory manner and to develop and support excellence in scholarship, education and interlingual communication. Its priorities and values are shaped through engagement with the worldwide community of Esperanto speakers, as well as with researchers, educators and activists in many language-related fields. ESF&#x27;s current president is Humphrey Tonkin.

== The interlinguistic support fund ==
Together with the Center for Research and Documentation (CED), Foundation to support Esperanto and interlinguistics, ESF (Esperantic Studies Foundation) invites proposals for research grants to assist scholars and graduate students in conducting and publishing research in such fields as language planning, interlinguistics, transnational language policy, linguistic justice, and &#x27;&quot;planned&quot; languages&#x27; (including Esperanto)

ESF has funded hundreds of different projects including the development of the educational websites &quot;lernu.net,&quot; a website to learn Esperanto and &quot;edukado.net&quot;, a website for teachers and learners of Esperanto, &quot;Tekstaro.com&quot;, a text corpus of Esperanto, &quot;Summer Esperanto Workshop in Europe&quot; (SES), &quot;North American Summer Esperanto Institute&quot; (NASK) to promote the continued study of Esperanto in the United States. ESF continues to support the Esperanto edition of UNESCO Courier, the &quot;Conference on the Application of Esperanto in Science and Technology&quot; (KAEST), as well as the postgraduate studies of interlinguistics and esperantology at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan, Poland and the Chair of Esperanto and Interlinguistics at the University of Amsterdam.

ESF sponsors also a number of other events, including the &quot;Nitobe Symposia&quot;, a conference series on world language problems that bring together activists, academics and politicians. as well as a series of symposia on language and development in New York aimed at raising the awareness of the United Nations about the importance of language equality for human development and human rights.

ESF also sponsored the creation of the documentary film &quot;The Universal Language&quot;, and produced the video course &quot;Esperanto—Pasporto al la Tuta Mondo&quot; (available on YouTube),

ESF also helped to establish official Esperanto examinations in accordance with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.

== Esperanto &quot;Access To Language Education&quot; Award ==
Esperantic Studies Foundation, Lernu.net and CALICO (&quot;Computer Assisted Language Instruction Consortium&quot;), yearly present the &quot;Esperanto&quot; &quot;Access To Language Education&quot; &quot;Award,&quot; abbreviated &quot;ALE Award&quot; for the best non-commercial website offering outstanding resources for language learning.

<text>A hostage is a person seized by an abductor in order to compel another party, one which places a high value on the liberty, well-being and safety of the person seized—such as a relative, employer, law enforcement, or government—to act, or refrain from acting, in a certain way, often under threat of serious physical harm or death to the hostage(s) after expiration of an ultimatum. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition&quot; defines a hostage as &quot;a person who is handed over by one of two belligerent parties to the other or seized as security for the carrying out of an agreement, or as a preventive measure against certain acts of war.&quot;

A party who seizes one or more hostages is known as a hostage-taker; if the hostages are present voluntarily, then the receiver is known as a host.
 In civil society, along with kidnapping for ransom and human trafficking (often willing to ransom its captives when lucrative or to trade on influence), hostage taking is a criminal activity. In the military context, hostages are distinct from prisoners of war—despite prisoners being used as collateral in prisoner exchange—and hostage taking is regarded as a war crime.

Hostage taking and kidnapping are prone to blend together. When the goal is strictly financial, the primary lens is one of extortion, even in the face of a severe threat to the safety of the captive person if the financial negotiation fails; conversely, when the goal is political or geopolitical, the primary lens is terrorism.

When looking at hostage-taking from the primary lens of terrorism, there are reasons to believe that certain government types are more susceptible to hostage-taking terrorism than others. In democratic governments, for example, elements related to their democratic ideals such as freedom of the press, constraints on the executive, free elections, and higher levels of civil liberties create favorable outcomes that enable hostage-takers to target these countries specifically. Hostage-takers understand that by targeting democratic governments, they are more likely to seek concessions and/or negotiate with them based on the level of accountability they must face from their citizens who elect them into office, and the media within the country which reports on such events in a capacity independent from the state.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;hostage&quot; derives from French , modern , from Late Latin (Medieval Latin ), the state of being an (plural ), , from Latin , but an etymological connection was later supposed with Latin , later .

==Historical practices==
The long history of political and military use indicates that political authorities or generals would legally agree to hand over one or usually several hostages in the custody of the other side, as guarantee of good faith in the observance of obligations. These obligations would be in the form of signing of a peace treaty, in the hands of the victor, or even exchange hostages as mutual assurance in cases such as an armistice. Major powers, such as Ancient Rome and European colonial powers would especially receive many such political hostages, often offspring of the elite, even princes or princesses who were generally treated according to their rank and put to a subtle long-term use where they would be given an elitist education or possibly even a religious conversion. This would eventually influence them culturally and open the way for an amicable political line if they ascended to power after release. Sometimes when a man from one nation was hostage in another nation, his position as hostage was more or less voluntary: for example the position of Æscferð son of Ecglāf, who was a Northumbrian hostage in Wessex; he fought under Byrhtnōð against Vikings in the Battle of Maldon on 10 August 991 AD (ref. lines 265 etseq), and probably died in battle there.
In Greek, &#x27;Ομηρος means &quot;Homer&quot; and also &quot;hostage&quot;, a coincidence which is part of the debate over Homer&#x27;s identity.
The Anglo-Saxon practice caused the element &quot;gīsl&quot; = &quot;hostage&quot; in many old Germanic personal names, such as &quot;Ēadgils&quot;, &quot;Cynegils&quot;, &quot;Gīslheard&quot;, and &quot;Gīslbeorht&quot;. This has been imported into placenames derived from personal names, for example Isleworth in west London (UK) from Old English &quot;Gīslheres wyrð&quot; (= &quot;enclosure belonging to [a man called] Gīslhere&quot;).
The practice of taking hostages is very ancient, and has been used constantly in negotiations with conquered nations, and in cases such as surrenders, armistices and the like, where the two belligerents depended for its proper carrying out on each other&#x27;s good faith. The Romans were accustomed to take the sons of tributary princes and educate them at Rome, thus holding a security for the continued loyalty of the conquered nation and also instilling a possible future ruler with ideas of Roman civilization. The practice was also commonplace in the Imperial Chinese tributary system, especially between the Han and Tang dynasties.

The practice continued through the early Middle Ages. The Irish High King Niall of the Nine Hostages got his epithet &quot;Noígiallach&quot; because, by taking nine petty kings hostage, he had subjected nine other principalities to his power.

This practice was also adopted in the early period of company rule in India, and by France during the French colonization of North Africa. The position of a hostage was that of a prisoner of war, to be retained until the negotiations or treaty obligations were carried out, and liable to punishment (in ancient times), and even to death, in case of treachery or refusal to fulfil the promises made.

The practice of taking hostages as security for the carrying out of a treaty between civilized states is now obsolete. The last occasion was at the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748), ending the War of the Austrian Succession, when two British peers, Henry Bowes Howard, 11th Earl of Suffolk, and Charles, 9th Baron Cathcart, were sent to France as hostages for the restitution of Cape Breton to France.

In France, after the revolution of Prairial (June 18, 1799), the so-called law of hostages was passed, to meet the royalist insurrection in La Vendée. Relatives of émigrés were taken from disturbed districts and imprisoned, and were liable to execution at any attempt to escape. Sequestration of their property and deportation from France followed on the murder of a republican, four to every such murder, with heavy fines on the whole body of hostages. The law only resulted in an increase in the insurrection. In 1796 Napoleon had used similar measures to deal with the insurrection in Lombardy.

In later times the practice of official war hostages may be said to be confined to either securing the payment of enforced contributions or requisitions in an occupied territory and the obedience to regulations the occupying army may think fit to issue; or as a precautionary measure, to prevent illegitimate acts of war or violence by persons not members of the recognized military forces of the enemy. 
During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the Germans took as hostages the prominent people or officials from towns or districts when making requisitions and also when foraging, and it was a general practice for the mayor and adjoint of a town which failed to pay a fine imposed upon it to be seized as hostages and retained until the money was paid. Another case where hostages have been taken in modern warfare has been the subject of much discussion. In 1870 the Germans found it necessary to take special measures to put a stop to train-wrecking by &quot;Francs-tireurs&quot; - i.e. &quot;parties in occupied territory not belonging to the recognized armed forces of the enemy&quot;, which was considered an illegitimate act of war. Prominent citizens were placed on the engine of the train so that it might be understood that in every accident caused by the hostility of the inhabitants their compatriots will be the first to suffer. The measure seems to have been effective. In 1900 during the Second Boer War, by a proclamation issued at Pretoria (June 19), Lord Roberts adopted the plan for a similar reason, but shortly afterwards (July 29) it was abandoned.

The Germans also, between the surrender of a town and its final occupation, took hostages as security against outbreaks of violence by the inhabitants.

Most writers on international law have regarded this method of preventing such acts of hostility as unjustifiable, on the ground that the persons taken as hostages are not the persons responsible for the act; that, as by the usage of war hostages are to be treated strictly as prisoners of war, such an exposure to danger is transgressing the rights of a belligerent; and as useless, for the mere temporary removal of important citizens until the end of a war cannot be a deterrent unless their mere removal deprives the combatants of persons necessary to the continuance of the acts aimed at. On the other hand, it has been urged that the acts, the prevention of which is aimed at, are not legitimate acts on the part of the armed forces of the enemy, but illegitimate acts by private persons, who, if caught, could be quite lawfully punished, and that a precautionary and preventive measure is more reasonable than reprisals. It may be noticed, however, that the hostages would suffer should the acts aimed at be performed by the authorized belligerent forces of the enemy.

Article 50 of the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare provides that: &quot;No general penalty, pecuniary or otherwise, can be inflicted on the population on account of the acts of individuals for which it cannot be regarded as collectively responsible.&quot; The regulations, however do not allude to the practice of taking hostage.

In May 1871, at the close of the Paris Commune, took place the massacre of the so-called hostages. Strictly they were not hostages, for they had not been handed over or seized as security for the performance of any undertaking or as a preventive measure, but merely in retaliation for the death of their leaders E. V. Duval and Gustave Flourens. The massacre occurred after the defeat at Mont Valrien on the 4 April and the entry of the army into Paris on the 21 May. Among the 52 victims who were shot in batches the most noticeable were Georges Darboy, archbishop of Paris, the Abbé Deguery, curé of the Madeleine, and the president of the Court of Cassation, Louis Bernard Bonjean.

== Legality of hostage-taking ==

Taking hostages in modern terms is considered a crime or an act of terrorism; the use of the word in this sense of abductee became current only in the 1970s. The criminal activity is known as kidnapping. An acute situation where hostages are kept in a building or a vehicle that has been taken over by armed terrorists or common criminals is often called a hostage crisis.

Common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions states that the taking of hostages during an internal conflict is a war crime and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever. In international conflicts, Articles 34 and 147 of the Fourth Geneva Convention state that using protected civilians as hostages is a grave breach of the convention. These conventions are supplemented by Article 75(2)(c) of Additional Protocol I in international conflicts and Article 4(2)(c) of Additional Protocol II in internal conflicts.

The International Convention against the Taking of Hostages—which prohibits hostage-taking and mandates the punishment of hostage-takers—was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1979. The treaty came into force in 1983 and has been ratified by all but 24 of the member states of the United Nations.

Hostage-taking is still often politically motivated or intended to raise a ransom or to enforce an exchange against other hostages or even condemned convicts. However, in some countries hostage-taking for profit has become an &quot;industry&quot;, ransom often being the only demand.

=== Hostage taking within diplomacy ===
=== Hostage-taking in the United States ===

==== Hostage Taking Act ====
The United States makes hostage-taking a federal criminal offense pursuant to . Generally, the Act applies to conduct occurring within the territory of the United States. However, under Subsection B, an offender may be indicted under the Act even if the hostage-taking occurred outside the territory of the United States if the &quot;offender or the person seized or detained is a national of the United States; the offender is found in the United States; or the governmental organization sought to be compelled is the Government of the United States.&quot; These provisions are consistent with the fundamental principles of international criminal law, specifically active nationality principle, universal principle, and the effects principle, respectively.

====18 USC 1203: Hostage Taking Act====

Title 18 of the United States Code criminalizes hostage-taking under &quot;18 USC 1203: Hostage Taking Act&quot;, which reads:
The Hostage Taking Act is a subsection of the International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages. It became enforceable in the United States January 6, 1985.

==Ransom payment strategies==

The United States has had an official policy of &quot;we do not negotiate with terrorists&quot; since the Nixon Administration. This applies to designated international terrorist groups, but not domestic kidnappers, foreign governments, or international organized crime. The United Kingdom has a similar policy, but many continental European countries, including France and Spain, routinely pay ransom.

The former head of the Committee to Protect Journalists, Joel Simon, found that evidence suggests this policy has reduced the number of Americans who survive kidnapping but has not reduced the number who are kidnapped in the first place. Spain retrieves all of its hostages with a policy of paying ransoms, but in the United States only about one quarter survive. Simon says that terrorists exploit these policy differences by making money from countries who do pay ransom, and using those that do not pay ransom to demonstrate their willingness to kill hostages and thus raise ransom prices and public pressure to pay. In the absence of a universal refusal to pay, which would eliminate any incentive for kidnapping, Simon says the best way to reduce kidnappings and prevent the use of ransom funds to fund other harmful activities is to pay ransom, free the hostages and then use the information gleaned from the negotiation and handoff to destroy the group responsible.

== Notable hostages crises ==

Several hostage crises have stood out in history due to their impact, duration, and the international attention they garnered. Some notable crises include:

* The Munich massacre (1972) - During the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, a Palestinian terrorist group known as Black September took eleven Israeli Olympic team members hostage and killed them along with a West German police officer.
* The Norrmalmstorg robbery (23-28 August 1973) - Four bank employees and civilians were taken hostages by Jan-Erik Olsson in kreditbanken while he was in parole, two police officers were injured while trying to communicate with the robber. It is best known as the origin of the term Stockholm syndrome.
* The Iranian Embassy Siege (1981) - A group of six armed men stormed the Iranian Embassy on Prince&#x27;s Gate in South Kensington, London. The gunmen, Iranian Arabs took 26 people hostage, including embassy staff, several visitors and a Metropolitan Police officer. The crisis ended with the SAS storming the building, killing 5 of the 6 gunmen.
* The Iran hostage crisis (1979-1981) - Iranian students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 52 American diplomats and citizens hostage for 444 days. The crisis ended with the hostages&#x27; release, minutes after Ronald Reagan was sworn in as the U.S. president.
* The Japanese embassy hostage crisis (1996-1997) - Members of a revolutionary movement in Peru took hundreds of hostages at the Japanese ambassador&#x27;s residence in Lima. The siege lasted 126 days and ended with a government raid, which resulted in the deaths of all the insurgents and one hostage.
* The Moscow theater hostage crisis (2002) - Chechen terrorists took 850 hostages during a performance at the Dubrovka Theater. Russian forces pumped narcotic gas into the building before storming it, which led to the deaths of at least 170 people, including 130 hostages.
* The Beslan school siege (2004) - Over 1,100 people were taken hostage, including 777 children, after armed Chechen separatists seized a school in Beslan, North Ossetia, Russia. The crisis lasted three days and ended with over 330 deaths, including 186 children.
* The In Amenas hostage crisis (2013) - An al-Qaeda affiliated group took over 800 people hostage at the Tigantourine gas facility in In Amenas, Algeria. The Algerian army&#x27;s intervention resulted in at least 39 foreign hostages killed along with 29 militants.
* The Gaza war hostage crisis (2023-) - 251 Israeli civilians and soldiers, dual citizens, and foreign nationals were taken as hostages by Hamas to the Gaza Strip, of which the number of kidnapped children was about 30. As of February 23, 62 remain in captivity.

<doc id="146798" wikidata="Q1365756" url="?curid=146798" title="Reprisal">
<text>A reprisal is a limited and deliberate violation of international law to punish another sovereign state that has already broken them. Since the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions (AP 1), reprisals in the laws of war are extremely limited, as they commonly breach the rights of non-combatants.

==Etymology==
The word came from French, where it originally meant &quot;act of taking back&quot;, for example, raiding back the equivalent of cattle lost to an enemy raid.

==International law==
Reprisals refer to acts which are illegal if taken alone, but become legal when adopted by one state in retaliation for the commission of an earlier illegal act by another state. ICRC’s Database of Customary International Humanitarian Law states in Rule 145: &quot;Where not prohibited by international law, belligerent reprisals are subject to stringent conditions.&quot; &quot;Counter-reprisals&quot; are generally not allowed.

===World War I===
====1914 Portugal-Germany dispute====
An example of reprisal is the Naulila dispute between Portugal and Germany in October 1914, when they were on opposite sides of the World War I chasm. After three Germans were mistakenly killed in Naulila on the border of the then-Portuguese colony of Angola (in a manner that did not violate international law), Germany carried out a military raid on Naulila, destroying property in retaliation. A claim for compensation was brought by Portugal. The tribunal emphasized that before reprisals could be legally undertaken, a number of conditions had to be satisfied:
*There had to be a previous act by the other party that violated international law.
*Reprisals had to be preceded by an unsatisfied demand for reparation or compliance with the violated international law.
*There must be proportionality between the offence and reprisal.
The German claim that it had acted lawfully was rejected on all three grounds.

===Irish War of Independence===
During the Irish War of Independence reprisals were authorized by British authorities in areas of Ireland that were under martial law. From December 1920 until June 1921 approximately 150 &quot;official&quot; reprisals were carried out. In December 1920 the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (Nevil Macready) informed the British Cabinet that Military Governors in martial law areas had been authorized to conduct reprisals in response to attacks on the military and police, under these conditions: 

===World War II===

Bennett writes that the events of World War II can be seen through either the prism of negative reciprocity or the prism of reprisal. If the latter, &quot;the rules also required that reprisals be used ‘only as an unavoidable last resort to induce the enemy to desist from illegitimate practices’&quot;.

The official 1940 American Rules of Land Warfare stated that &quot;commanding officers must assume responsibility for retaliative measures when an unscrupulous enemy leaves no other recourse against the repetition of barbarous outrages.&quot;

Both Rogers and Bennett write that &quot;[s]tate practice in the Second World War was characterised by, among other factors, the doctrine of belligerent reprisal.&quot;

===Post-1945===
After 1945, as a result of the general prohibition on use of force imposed by Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, armed reprisals in time of peace are no longer legal, but the possibility remains of non-armed reprisals (also known as countermeasures) as well as belligerent reprisals during hostilities when the law of international armed conflict (LOIAC) is violated.

In the case of belligerent reprisals, apart from the three factors in the Naulila case:
* a warning must also be issued beforehand;
* once the other party has stopped violation of LOIAC, belligerent reprisals must also be terminated;
* and the decision to engage in belligerent reprisals must be taken by a competent authority.

All four Geneva Conventions prohibit reprisals against, respectively, battlefield casualties, shipwreck survivors, prisoners of war, and protected persons (civilian or military), as well as certain buildings and property. The 1977 AP 1 defines what is an &quot;indiscriminate attack&quot;.

<text>Nicolas Fouquet, marquis de Belle-Île, vicomte de Melun et Vaux (; 27 January 1615 – 23 March 1680) was the Superintendent of Finances in France from 1653 until 1661 under King Louis XIV. He had a glittering career, and acquired enormous wealth. He fell out of favor, accused of peculation (maladministration of the state&#x27;s funds) and &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; (disrespect to the monarch). The king had him imprisoned from 1661 until his death in 1680.

==Early life==
Nicolas Fouquet was born in Paris to an influential family of the &quot;noblesse de robe&quot; (members of the nobility under the Ancien Régime who had high positions in government, especially in law and finance). He was the second child of François IV Fouquet (who held numerous high positions in government) and of Marie de Maupeou (who came from a family of the &quot;noblesse de robe&quot; and who was famous for her piety and charitable works).:18–23,

Contrary to the pretensions of the family, the Fouquets did not come from a lineage of noble blood. They were originally, in fact, merchants in the cloth trade, based in Angers. Fouquet&#x27;s father later amassed great wealth as a shipowner in Brittany. He was noticed by Cardinal Richelieu, who gave him important positions in government. In 1628, he became an executive associate in the Company of the American Islands, a chartered company for the colonization of French Islands, including missionary work and trade and investment.:18–23

Fouquet&#x27;s family was extremely devout. They had planned that Nicolas would join the clergy. Out of the family’s 11 children who survived into adulthood, all 5 girls took vows. Among the male children, 4 took the cloth and 2 became bishops. Only Nicolas and his brother Gilles were laymen.:51

After some preliminary schooling with the Jesuits at the age of 13, Fouquet received his law degree from the University of Paris. Richelieu advised Fouquet on this career choice.:40

==Political career==
In 1634, Fouquet was appointed councilor of the Parliament of Metz. Richelieu charged him with the sensitive task of verifying the accounts to determine whether or not Charles IV of Lorraine was skimming money that rightfully was due to the King of France. Fouquet, still a teenager, accomplished this task with &quot;brio&quot;.:40–41 In 1636, at just 20, his father bought him the post of &quot;maître des requêtes&quot; for 150,000 livres (under the Ancien Régime, many government posts were purchased by the people holding them).[1], In 1640, he married the rich and well-connected Louise Fourché and received around 160,000 livres from the dowry, plus other rents and land. Louise died in 1641 at the age of 21, six months after giving birth to a daughter. Fouquet was 26 years old.

Cardinal Richelieu died in 1642, but Fouquet was successful in impressing his successor as chief minister, Cardinal Mazarin, who became his protector (over the long term, the relationship was tense:59–60). From 1642 to 1650, Fouquet held various intendancies, at first in the provinces and then with the army of Mazarin. In 1648, Fouquet was named general intendant of Paris, right as the second Fronde broke out. He ably came to the aid of Mazarin and the Queen Mother, Anne of Austria (who was regent for the young Louis XIV) in defense of the monarchy. As a result, Fouquet earned the lasting loyalty and support of both Mazarin:30 and Anne.

These high-level positions raised his profile with the court. He was permitted in 1650 to buy, for 450,000 livres, the important position of &quot;procureur général&quot; to the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris, thereby raising him to the most elite ranks of the &quot;noblesse de robe&quot;. 

Fouquet&#x27;s already great wealth was augmented by his marriage in 1651 to 15-year old Marie-Madeleine de Castille. She belonged to a wealthy, well-connected family of the &quot;noblesse de robe&quot;.:77 Fouquet had five children with her.

During Mazarin&#x27;s exile during the second Fronde, Fouquet remained loyal to him, protecting his possessions and informing him of what was happening in the court.:59–60 Upon Mazarin&#x27;s return, Fouquet demanded and received as a reward the office of superintendent of finance (on 7 February 1653), making him the youngest person to hold this position in the Ancien Regime.

The royal finances were in a disastrous state at this time, due to many years of war under Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin and antiquated revenue practices. Only about half of total tax revenues collected actually ended up in the royal treasury, the rest being skimmed off by various parties along the way. In this unsettled situation, Fouquet was responsible for decisions as to which funds should be used to meet the demands of the state&#x27;s creditors, but also for the negotiations with the great financiers who lent money to the king. Fouquet&#x27;s willingness to honor some of the royal promises enhanced the credibility of the crown as a borrower and strengthened the credit of the government, though the controls on this process were either ineffective or non-existent. The long wars, and the greed of the courtiers, made it necessary at times for Fouquet to meet the demand for funds by borrowing upon his own good credit.:33–42 Fouquet was aware of the risks he was runninghe feared ruining his family and his friends who had helped him lend money to the crown. In December 1658, he presented his resignation to Mazarin, but, unfortunately for him, it was not accepted.

The disorder in the accounts became hopeless, but was also normalthe kingdom had a long history of poorly controlled royal finances. In any case, debt issuance could not resolve the deplorable economic situation of the realm without an underlying ability and willingness to rein in expenditures and to bring in tax revenues. Fouquet became the central actor in a debt situation that was fundamentally untenable. Fouquet had drawn up a plan to bring some order to public finances, but he never made progress in implementing it, though it was taken up later by Colbert.:63 Instead, it was business as usual: fraudulent operations were entered into with impunity, and the financiers were maintained in the position of clients via official favours and generous aid whenever they needed it. In the meantime, the peasants and commoners in the cities paid the price for this disorder.:33–42

With Mazarin&#x27;s death on 9 March 1661, Fouquet expected to be made chief minister, but Louis XIV was suspicious of his loyalty to the crown and his poorly disguised ambition. Upon assuming his kingly duties, it was with Fouquet in mind that Louis XIV made the well known statement that he would be his own chief minister. Colbert, perhaps seeking to succeed Fouquet, fed the king&#x27;s displeasure with adverse reports about the deficit and unflattering reports about Fouquet. However, Fouquet had some protectionshis high position at the &quot;parlement&quot; (he remained &quot;procureur général&quot;) gave him immunity from prosecution by any authority except the &quot;Parlement&quot;, which he largely controlled. Another reason Fouquet may have felt secure is that what he was doing was not necessarily illegaleven Colbert later admitted that &quot;Fouquet managed to conduct his robbery while keeping his hands clean.&quot;:40

== Vaux-le-Vicomte ==

In 1641, the 26-year old Fouquet purchased the manor of Vaux-le-Vicomte and its small castle located 50 km south east of Paris. He spent enormous sums over a period of 20 years building a château on his estate. In terms of its size, magnificence and interior decor, the chateau was the forerunner of the Palace of Versailles. To design it, he brought together a team that the king later used for Versailles: the architect Louis Le Vau, the painter Charles Le Brun, and the garden designer André le Nôtre.

At Vaux and other major properties he owned (notably, his estate in Saint-Mandé, which bordered on the Château de Vincennes), Fouquet gathered rare manuscripts, paintings, jewels and antiques in profusion, and above all surrounded himself with artists and authors. Jean de La Fontaine, Pierre Corneille, Molière, Madame de Sevigné and Paul Scarron were a few of the many artists and authors who received his invitations, and for some, his patronage.:89–90

These extravagant expenditures and displays of the superintendent&#x27;s wealth ultimately intensified the ill-will of the king.

== Colonial and maritime activities ==

In 1638, Fouquet received as a gift some of his father&#x27;s shares in the Company of the American Islands. In 1640, he became one of the first shareholders in the Société du Cap Nord and, in 1642, of the East India Company (Société des Indes Orientales). After his father’s death in 1641, he inherited and managed the family&#x27;s interests in several other chartered companies for French colonization (Sénégal, New France). Moreover, the family, through Fouquet&#x27;s father and other family ties, was already active in maritime transport and had a network of influential contacts in Brittany.1:131

Over a period of many years, Fouquet undertook to develop these existing strengths. Specifically, Fouquet was active in attempting to forward the French colonial effort and in developing the coast of Brittany as a major location for hosting maritime trade. He cultivated high ranking friends in Brittany. He bought numerous armed ships and proceeded with a quasi-military development,:315 apparently without informing the king.

As part of this undertaking, Fouquet had bought Belle-Île-en-Mer in 1658, an island off the coast of Brittany. He strengthened the island’s existing fortifications and built a port and warehouses (he also fortified the île d&#x27;Yeu). These were major construction projects which caused the king enough concern that he had a spy sent to Belle-Île-en-Mer. The spy reported that there was a garrison of 200 soldiers, 400 cannon and a stockpile of ammunition sufficient for a force of 6000 soldiers. Fouquet planned to use Belle-Île as a refuge in case of disgrace.:315,

Heightening the concerns of the king, Fouquet was found to have ordered several warships in the Netherlands, which could have served both his colonial ambitions and as an implicit threat to the king. In addition, Fouquet used a straw man to assume the position of Viceroy (&quot;vice-roi&quot;) of the Americas without the king’s knowledge.

==Arrest==
On 17 August 1661, Louis was entertained at Vaux-le-Vicomte with a sumptuous fête, at which Molière&#x27;s &quot;Les Fâcheux&quot; was produced for the first time. The fête also included a lavish meal served on gold and silver plates for hundreds of members of the court; there were also fireworks, a ballet and light shows. The king was astounded by this display of luxury.

Although this fête is sometimes cited as the reason for Fouquet&#x27;s downfall, Louis XIV secretly was plotting with Colbert to get rid of him in May and June 1661. The splendour of the entertainment only aggravated Fouquet&#x27;s precarious position by calling attention to the immense gap between his ostentatious wealth and the visible poverty of the crown.334,

The king was also concerned about Fouquet&#x27;s carefully cultivated network of friends and clients, which made him one of the most influential individuals in the realm. Then only 22 years old, the king was afraid to act openly against so powerful a minister. As a child, Louis had observed the armed conflict that threatened his monarchy during the Fronde and had solid reasons to be concerned about rebellion. As superintendent, Fouquet headed the enormously wealthy and influential corps of &quot;partisans&quot; (tax farmers), which, if challenged as a group, could have caused the king serious trouble.

By crafty devices, Fouquet was induced to sell his office of &quot;procureur général&quot;, causing him to lose his immunity from royal prosecution; he paid the money received from the sale (about 1 million livres) into the royal treasury as a gesture to earn the favor of the king.:140, At the same time, he was weighed down by his own recent &quot;faux pas&quot;notably, when he tried unsuccessfully to recruit a mistress of the king as a spy (the mistress refused Fouquet&#x27;s offer of money and duly reported it to the king).

After his visit to Vaux, the king announced that he was going to Nantes for the opening of the meeting of the provincial estates of Brittany. He required his ministers, including Fouquet, to go with him. On 5 September 1661, Fouquet was leaving the council chamber, flattered with the assurance of the king&#x27;s esteem, when he was arrested by d’Artagnan, lieutenant of the king&#x27;s musketeers. It is reported that the arrest took Fouquet completely by surprise because he apparently thought that he was very much in the king&#x27;s good graces. He initially was imprisoned at the Chateau d’Angers.

== Trial and life imprisonment ==
The trial lasted almost three years. Many procedural aspects of the investigation and trial were highly questionable, even by the standards of the 17th century. For example, the officials charged with the investigation answered directly to Fouquet&#x27;s arch-enemy, Jean-Baptiste Colbert; the trial was held before a special court where judges and prosecutors were handpicked by Colbert for being hostile to Fouquet and sympathetic to the king;:156 and the trial was held in written formFouquet, a convincing orator, was not allowed to speak in his own defense.

Nevertheless, some of the charges against Fouquet were supported by evidence that Fouquet found difficult to refute, notably the ‘cassette of Saint Mandé’. The cassette contained incriminating documents that had been found after his arrest; they were hidden behind a mirror in Fouquet&#x27;s estate near Paris. The cassette contained a plan of defence written in 1657 at a time when Fouquet was on bad terms with Mazarin, that was modified in 1659. The plan instructed his supporters on what they should do if he were ever to be arrested, including taking up arms. It also envisaged a naval operation in the Bay of the Seine.

The accusations that were the subject of the trial could be punishable by death. They were:
* Misdeeds in the administration of royal finances and misuse of public funds (&quot;peculat&quot;, a capital crime). This accusation included: appropriation of large sums of the Crown’s money; receiving payments from illegally acquired rents; lending money to the king while serving as &quot;ordonnateur&quot; (a public function for regulating public expenditures and receipts); and the private use of funds from the royal treasury.
* The crime of &quot;lèse-majesté&quot;, including the purchase of Belle-Île without the king’s authorization; corruption of royal officers and governors in a fortified place; and conflict of interest, notably with high-ranking members of the king’s court.

During the trial, French public sympathy tended to support Fouquet. La Fontaine, Madame de Sévigné, Jean Loret, and many others wrote on his behalf.

The guilty verdict and the sentence of banishment were handed down on 20 December 1664out of 22 judges, 13 were for banishment and 9 were for the death penalty. The king, disappointed with what he regarded as a lenient decision, &quot;commuted&quot; the sentence to life imprisonment at the fort of Pignerol and confiscation of Fouquet&#x27;s property.:167 He also launched a vendetta against Fouquet&#x27;s friends, supporters and family.,:150–152In December 1664, Fouquet was taken to the prison fortress of Pignerol in the Alps (in what is now Italy). He remained there, incarcerated in harsh conditions, until his death in 1680.

There, Eustache Dauger, the man identified by historical research as the Man in the Iron Mask but whose real name never was spoken or written, is said to have served as one of Fouquet&#x27;s valets (but the link between Fouquet&#x27;s imprisonment and the Man in the Iron Mask is controversial). Fouquet&#x27;s wife was not allowed to write to him until 1672 and she was allowed to visit him only once, in 1679. The former minister bore his imprisonment with fortitude; he composed several translations and devotionals there.:156, 167

==Death==
According to official records, Fouquet died in Pignerol on 23 March 1680. His son, the Count of Vaux, was with him when he died. Although no death certificate was established, he is said to have died of apoplexy following a long illness. He was initially buried in the local church, Saint Claire de Pignerol. However, a year after his death, his remains were moved from there to the unmarked family crypt in the Église Sainte-Marie-des-Anges in Paris.

==In fiction==
Fouquet&#x27;s story is often entwined with that of the Man in the Iron Mask, who is often identified as the true king or even as an identical twin brother of Louis XIV. As such, he is a pivotal character in Alexandre Dumas&#x27; novel &quot;The Vicomte de Bragelonne&quot;, where he is depicted heroically. Aramis, an ally of Fouquet, tries to seize power by replacing Louis XIV with his identical twin brother. It is Fouquet who, out of sheer loyalty to the crown, foils Aramis&#x27;s plot and saves Louis. This does not, however, prevent his downfall.

James Whale&#x27;s film &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; (1939) is very loosely adapted from Dumas&#x27; novel, and by contrast, depicts Fouquet as the story&#x27;s main villain, who tries to keep the existence of the king&#x27;s twin brother a secret. Fouquet is portrayed by Joseph Schildkraut. In the 1977 version, Fouquet is portrayed by Patrick McGoohan. In &quot;The Fifth Musketeer&quot; (1979), based on the same novel, he is portrayed by Ian McShane. In a departure from history, most of these films show him dying in the 1660s.

Fouquet was portrayed by Robert Lindsay in Nick Dear&#x27;s play &quot;Power&quot;.

Fouquet&#x27;s life (and his rivalry with Colbert) is one of the background plots/stories in the historical novel &quot;Imprimatur&quot; by Rita Monaldi and Francesco Sorti.

Fouquet and his arrest also figure prominently in Roberto Rossellini&#x27;s 1966 film &quot;The Taking of Power by Louis XIV&quot;, where Fouquet is played by Pierre Barrat.

In the second of Peter Greenaway&#x27;s &quot;Tulse Luper&quot; films, a Nazi general by the name of Foestling, played by Marcel Iureș, becomes obsessed with Fouquet and attempts to recreate his life and death.

Fouquet is described but not mentioned by name in an episode of HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. Carmine Lupertazzi Jr. makes a comparison of John Sacrimoni to King Louis&#x27; finance minister who tried to outshine him and his estate: &quot;In the end, Louis clapped him in irons&quot;.

<text>Leif Erikson, also known as Leif the Lucky (), was a Norse explorer who is thought to have been the first European to set foot on continental America, approximately half a millennium before Christopher Columbus. According to the sagas of Icelanders, he established a Norse settlement at Vinland, which is usually interpreted as being coastal North America. There is ongoing speculation that the settlement made by Leif and his crew corresponds to the remains of a Norse settlement found in Newfoundland, Canada, called L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows, which was occupied approximately 1,000 years ago.

Leif&#x27;s place of birth is unknown, although it is assumed to have been in Iceland. His father, Erik the Red, founded the first Norse settlement in Greenland, where Leif was later raised. Following his voyage to Vinland and the subsequent death of his father, Leif became chief of the Greenland settlement. He had two known sons: Thorgils, born in the Hebrides; and Thorkell, who succeeded him as Greenland&#x27;s chieftain.

==Early life==
Leif was the son of Erik the Red and his wife Thjodhild (Old Norse: Þjóðhildur), and, through his paternal line, the grandson of Thorvald Ásvaldsson. When Erik the Red was young, his father was banished from Norway for manslaughter, and the family went into exile in Iceland (which, during the century preceding Leif&#x27;s birth, had been colonized by Norsemen, mainly from Norway). Leif was also a distant relative of Naddodd, who discovered Iceland.

Leif&#x27;s year of birth is often estimated in the s. Though his birthplace is not accounted for in the sagas, it is likely he was born in Iceland, where his parents met—probably somewhere on the edge of Breiðafjörður, and possibly at the farm Haukadal, where his mother&#x27;s family was based.

Erik was later banished from Iceland and sailed west to a place he named Greenland. He then briefly returned to Iceland to bring his family and other colonists back with him to Greenland, establishing its first permanent settlement in 986. Leif grew up on the family estate Brattahlíð in the Eastern Settlement of Greenland. He had two brothers, whose names were Thorstein and Thorvald, and a sister, Freydís. Tyrker, one of Erik&#x27;s thralls, had been specially trusted to keep charge of Erik&#x27;s children, as Leif later referred to him as his &quot;foster father.&quot;

== Discovering Vinland ==
The &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot; and the &quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot;, both thought to have been written around 1200, contain different accounts of the voyages to Vinland (usually interpreted as coastal North America). The only two known strictly historical mentions of Vinland are found in the work of Adam of Bremen and in the &quot;Book of Icelanders&quot;, compiled by Ari the Wise.

=== Account in the &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot; ===

According to this saga, Leif discovered Vinland after being blown off course on his way from Norway to Greenland. Before this voyage, Leif had spent time at the court of Norwegian King Olaf Tryggvesson, where he had converted to Christianity. When Leif encountered the storm that forced him off course, he had been on his way to introduce Christianity to the Greenlanders. After they had arrived at an unknown shore, the crew disembarked and explored the area. They found wild grapes, self-sown wheat, and maple trees. Afterwards, they loaded their ship with samples of these newly-found goods and sailed east to Greenland, rescuing a group of shipwrecked sailors along the way. For this act, and for converting Norse Greenland to Christianity, Leif earned the nickname &quot;Leif the Lucky&quot;. Leif did not return to Vinland, but others from Greenland and Iceland did, including Thorfinn Karlsefni.

=== Account in the &quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot; ===
According to this saga, Leif was not the first European to discover Vinland. Instead Bjarni Herjólfsson and his crew—on a voyage from Iceland to Greenland—were overtaken by wind and fog, missed the southern tip of Greenland, and encountered an unknown coast. Believing it to be somewhere other than Greenland, they did not disembark but rather continued to sail and found two additional coasts that did not correspond with their understanding of Greenland. After sailing back east, they eventually made it to their original destination, and then told of their discoveries.

Roughly 15 years later, Leif approached Bjarni, purchased his ship, gathered a crew of thirty-five men, and mounted an expedition towards the land Bjarni had described. His father Erik was set to join him but dropped out after he fell from his horse on his way to the ship, an incident he interpreted as a bad omen. Leif followed Bjarni&#x27;s route in reverse and landed first in a rocky and desolate place he named Helluland (Flat-Rock Land; possibly Baffin Island or northern parts of Labrador). After venturing further by sea, he landed the second time in a forested place he named Markland (Forest Land; possibly near Cape Porcupine, Labrador). After two more days at sea, he landed on an island to the north (possibly Belle Isle), and then returned to the mainland, going past a cape on the north side (perhaps Cape Bauld). They sailed to the west of this and landed in a verdant area with a mild climate and plentiful supplies of salmon. As winter approached, he decided to encamp there and sent out parties to explore the country. During one of these explorations, Tyrker discovered that the land was full of vines and grapes. Leif therefore named the land Vinland (&#x27;Wineland&#x27;). There, he and his crew built a small settlement, which was called Leifsbudir (Leif&#x27;s Booths) by later visitors from Greenland.

After having wintered over in Vinland, Leif returned to Greenland in the spring with a cargo of grapes and timber. On the return voyage, he rescued an Icelandic castaway and his crew, earning him the nickname &quot;Leif the Lucky&quot;. Leif never returned to Vinland, but others from Greenland and Iceland did.

=== Archeological evidence of Vinland ===

Most researchers and scholars agree that Vinland was a region in North America.

Research done in the early 1960s by Norwegian explorer Helge Ingstad and his wife, archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, identified a Norse site located at the northern tip of Newfoundland. It has been suggested that this site, known as L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows (carbon dating estimates 990–1050 CE and tree-ring analysis dating to the year 1021) could be Leifsbudir. The Ingstads demonstrated that Norsemen had reached North America about 500 years before Christopher Columbus. Later archaeological evidence suggests that Vinland may have been the areas around the Gulf of St. Lawrence and that the L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows site was a ship repair station and waypoint for voyages there. That does not necessarily contradict the identification of L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows as Leifsbudir since the two sagas appear to describe Vinland as a wider region which included several settlements. The &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot; mentions two other settlements in Vinland: one called Straumfjǫrðr, which lay beyond Kjalarnes promontory and the Wonderstrands, and one called Hóp, which was located even farther south.

==Personal life==
Leif has been described in the Vinland sagas as a wise, considerate and strong man of striking appearance. When he was of a proper age, Leif went to Norway, likely to serve as a retainer to its king, Olaf Tryggvason. It was on this journey to Norway that the &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot; states that Leif&#x27;s ship was driven to the Hebrides, where he and his crew were forced to remain for much of the summer, awaiting favorable winds. During his stay there, Leif fell in love with a noblewoman, Thorgunna, who gave birth to their son Thorgils. Thorgunna remained in the Hebrides when Leif left, as he refused to take her along without permission from her family. Thorgils was later sent to Leif in Greenland, but he did not become popular.

After arriving at the court of Norway&#x27;s King Olaf Tryggvason, Leif was converted to Christianity. According to both the &quot;Saga of Erik the Red, &quot; and &quot;Olaf Tryggvason&#x27;s Saga&quot; as found in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, after Leif&#x27;s conversion, the king then commissioned him to return to Greenland to convert the settlers there. During the journey, he was blown off course and discovered Vinland before finding his way to Greenland. Leif&#x27;s father Erik reacted coldly to the suggestion that he should abandon his religion, while his mother Thjóðhildr became a Christian and built a church called Thjóðhild&#x27;s Church. A different version of &quot;Olaf Tryggvason&#x27;s Saga&quot;, found in &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot;, makes no reference to Leif being blown off course and discovering Vinland during his return from Norway, but indicates that after arriving in Greenland, all of that country was converted, including Leif&#x27;s father Erik. Some versions of &quot;Olaf Tryggvason&#x27;s Saga&quot; also indicate that to help with the conversion, Leif brought a priest and clerics with him to Greenland.

===Chieftaincy and death===
The winter following Leif&#x27;s return from Vinland, his father died (shortly after 1000 CE), making Leif paramount chief in Greenland. Leif is last mentioned alive in 1018 in the Saga of St. Olaf. According to The Saga of the Sworn Brothers, by 1025 the chieftaincy of Eiríksfjǫrðr had passed to his son Thorkel. Nothing is mentioned about his death in the sagas—he probably died in Greenland some time between these dates. Nothing further is known about his family beyond the succession of Thorkell as chieftain.

==Historicity==
Leif is, in all likelihood, a historical figure who remains the first known European to set foot in continental North America, but other details of his life vary and are a subject of debate. It has been suggested by several scholars that both Leif&#x27;s sister, Freydís, and his foster father, Tyrker, are works of fiction, as are their roles in the Vinland sagas. Leif&#x27;s commission as a missionary to Greenland may also be fictional, as that aspect of his story is often attributed to Gunnlaugr Leifsson&#x27;s version of &quot;Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar&quot; (which likely served as a source for some of the other sagas which mention Leif).

==Legacy==

=== Norse and medieval Europe ===

Leif&#x27;s successful expedition in Vinland encouraged other Norsemen to also make the journey, and the Norse became the first Europeans to colonize the area. In the end there were no permanent Norse settlements, although sporadic voyages at least to Markland for forages, timber and trade possibly lasted for centuries. The casual tone of references to these areas may suggest that their discovery was not seen as particularly significant by contemporaries, or that it was assumed to be public knowledge, or both. Knowledge of the Vinland journeys spread around medieval Europe, although to what extent is unclear; writers made mention of remote lands to the west, and notably the medieval chronicler Adam of Bremen directly mentions Vinland (c. 1075) based upon reports from the Danes. It has been suggested that the knowledge of Vinland might have been maintained in European seaports in the 15th century, and that Christopher Columbus, who claimed in a letter to have visited Iceland in 1477, could have heard stories of it.

=== Norse encounters with the Indigenous peoples ===
While Leif had no contact with the Indigenous peoples of Vinland, later Norse explorers did, referring to them as &quot;skrælingi&quot;, an archaic term for &quot;wretches&quot;.

According to the &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot;, the first encounter was made during a colonizing expedition led by Thorfinn Karlsefni, which also included Leif&#x27;s brother Thorvald. At first this group traded with the natives, but weeks later the new Norse settlement at Hóp was attacked and Karlsefni decided to abandon it. The Norse retreated to their other settlement at Straumfjǫrðr, where they remained and continued to explore the general area. One morning they encountered a one-legged native, who shot an arrow that killed Thorvald. He is famously known for pulling the arrow out, and poetically reciting the phrase, &quot;This is a rich country we have found; there is plenty of fat around my entrails&quot;, upon which he dies. On their return to Greenland, Karlsefni&#x27;s crew captured two native boys, taking them to Greenland.

According to the &quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot;, Leif&#x27;s brother Thorvald made first contact with the natives. The encounter happened while Thorvald and his crew were exploring the coast, likely in the Markland area, and found nine natives asleep under boats. They attacked the natives, killing eight of them, while one escaped. Shortly after, in an apparent reprisal, Thorvald was killed by a native&#x27;s arrow. Later, Thorfinn Karlsefni led a group to colonize Vinland and encountered natives, who they initially traded with, but relations soured when a native was killed attempting to steal weapons from the Norse. In retaliation, the natives attacked and Karlsefni decided to abandon the colony.

=== Travels and commemoration ===
Stories of Leif&#x27;s journey to North America had a profound effect on the identity and self-perception of later Nordic Americans and Nordic immigrants to the United States. The first statue of Erikson (by Anne Whitney) was erected in Boston in 1887 at the instigation of Eben Norton Horsford, who was among those who believed that Vinland could have been located on the Charles River or Cape Cod; not long after, another casting of Whitney&#x27;s statue was erected in Milwaukee. A statue was also erected in Chicago in 1901, having been originally commissioned for the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition to coincide with the arrival of the reconstructed Viking ship from Bergen, Norway. Another work of art made for the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, the painting &quot;Leiv Eirikson Discovering America&quot; by Christian Krohg, was in the possession of a Leif Erikson Memorial Association in Chicago before being given back to the National Gallery of Norway in 1900.

For the centenary of the first official immigration of Norwegians to America, President Calvin Coolidge stated at the 1925 Minnesota State Fair, to a crowd of 100,000 people, that Leif had indeed been the first European to discover America. Additional statues of him were erected at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul in 1949, near Lake Superior in Duluth, Minnesota, in 1956, and in downtown Seattle.

In 1924, a party of four consisting of a Swede, an Englishman, and two Americans attempted to emulate Leif&#x27;s voyage in an eponymous 40-foot vessel but were lost after reaching the west coast of Greenland.

In 1930, a statue of Leif was erected in the city center of Reykjavík, Iceland – currently situated in front of Hallgrímskirkja – as a gift from the United States to Iceland to commemorate the 1,000 year anniversary of Alþingi, the parliament of Iceland.

The Leif Erikson Awards, established 2015, are awarded annually by the Exploration Museum in Húsavík, Iceland. They are awarded for achievements in exploration and in the study of the history of exploration.

Several ships are named after Leif – a Viking ship replica, a commercial passenger/vehicle ferry, and a large dredger.

Erikson is recalled as &quot;Leif the Lucky&quot; in the Robert Frost poem &quot;Wild Grapes.&quot;

==== Leif Erikson Day ====

In 1929, the Wisconsin Legislature passed a bill to make 9 October &quot;Leif Erikson Day&quot; in the state, and in the years following, several other states adopted laws to observe the day. In 1935, legislation was introduced to the United States Congress requesting federal observance of the day. Before the legislation was passed, it was amended so that the observance would only occur in 1935 (which it was, following a proclamation that year by President President Franklin D. Roosevelt). In the subsequent decades, a number of unsuccessful attempts were made to pass legislation requesting Leif Erikson Day be proclaimed annually by the president. Proponents eventually succeeded, when, in 1964, the Congress authorized and requested the president to proclaim 9 October of each year as &quot;Leif Erikson Day&quot;. In the years since, each president has issued an annual proclamation calling for observance of the day.

The Sagas do not give the exact date of Leif&#x27;s landfall in America, but state only that it was in the fall of the year. At the suggestion of Christian A. Hoen of Edgerton, Wisconsin, 9 October was settled upon for Leif Erikson Day, as that already was a historic date for Norwegians in America, the ship &quot;Restaurationen&quot; having arrived in New York Harbor on 9 October 1825 from Stavanger with the first organized party of Norwegian immigrants.

<text>The English Civil War Society was founded in 1980 and is the umbrella organisation for the King&#x27;s Army and the Roundhead Association. The purpose of the Society is to raise awareness of the conflict between King Charles I of England and his supporters and their opponents in Parliament and Scotland. The society does this by staging re-enactments of civil war battles and other types of living history and educational displays across the UK. The re-enactment societies are concerned with technical details about regiments, their weapons and their clothing and way of life as well as mock battles using authentic pikes, muskets and cannon.

==Regiments==

The English Civil War Society consists of many smaller subdivisions, each run semi-autonomously, and which are known to their members as &quot;regiments&quot;. Each of these regiments falls under one or other of the two armies of the English Civil War Society, the Roundhead Association and the King&#x27;s Army. The Roundhead Association army represents the army of Parliament – the &quot;roundheads&quot; – and also the Covenanters of Scotland, whilst the Kings Army represents that of the King – the &quot;cavaliers&quot; or &quot;royalists&quot;. The King&#x27;s Army currently has seven regiments under its control and the Roundhead Association has thirteen. There are regiments of &quot;foote&quot;, which are common foot soldiers and are armed with pike or musket; regiments of &quot;horse&quot;, which are groups on horseback and armed with swords and carbines; and regiments of artillery armed with cannon of various sizes.

<doc id="146806" wikidata="Q740970" url="?curid=146806" title="Recurrence relation">
<text>In mathematics, a recurrence relation is an equation according to which the formula_1th term of a sequence of numbers is equal to some combination of the previous terms. Often, only formula_2 previous terms of the sequence appear in the equation, for a parameter formula_2 that is independent of formula_1; this number formula_2 is called the &quot;order&quot; of the relation. If the values of the first formula_2 numbers in the sequence have been given, the rest of the sequence can be calculated by repeatedly applying the equation.

In &quot;linear recurrences&quot;, the th term is equated to a linear function of the formula_2 previous terms. A famous example is the recurrence for the Fibonacci numbers,
formula_8
where the order formula_2 is two and the linear function merely adds the two previous terms. This example is a linear recurrence with constant coefficients, because the coefficients of the linear function (1 and 1) are constants that do not depend on formula_10 For these recurrences, one can express the general term of the sequence as a closed-form expression of formula_1. As well, linear recurrences with polynomial coefficients depending on formula_1 are also important, because many common elementary functions and special functions have a Taylor series whose coefficients satisfy such a recurrence relation (see holonomic function).

Solving a recurrence relation means obtaining a closed-form solution: a non-recursive function of formula_1.

The concept of a recurrence relation can be extended to multidimensional arrays, that is, indexed families that are indexed by tuples of natural numbers.

==Definition==
A &quot;recurrence relation&quot; is an equation that expresses each element of a sequence as a function of the preceding ones. More precisely, in the case where only the immediately preceding element is involved, a recurrence relation has the form
:formula_14
where 
:formula_15
is a function, where is a set to which the elements of a sequence must belong. For any formula_16, this defines a unique sequence with formula_17 as its first element, called the &quot;initial value&quot;.

It is easy to modify the definition for getting sequences starting from the term of index 1 or higher.

This defines recurrence relation of &quot;first order&quot;. A recurrence relation of &quot;order&quot; has the form 
:formula_18

where formula_19 is a function that involves consecutive elements of the sequence.
In this case, initial values are needed for defining a sequence.

==Examples==
===Factorial===
The factorial is defined by the recurrence relation
:formula_20
and the initial condition
:formula_21
This is an example of a &quot;linear recurrence with polynomial coefficients&quot; of order 1, with the simple polynomial (in )
:formula_1
as its only coefficient.

===Logistic map===
An example of a recurrence relation is the logistic map defined by

:formula_23

for a given constant formula_24 The behavior of the sequence depends dramatically on formula_25 but is stable when the initial condition formula_26 varies.

===Fibonacci numbers===
The recurrence of order two satisfied by the Fibonacci numbers is the canonical example of a homogeneous linear recurrence relation with constant coefficients (see below). The Fibonacci sequence is defined using the recurrence

:formula_27

with initial conditions

:formula_28
:formula_29

Explicitly, the recurrence yields the equations
:formula_30
:formula_31
:formula_32
etc.

We obtain the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, which begins
:0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

The recurrence can be solved by methods described below yielding Binet&#x27;s formula, which involves powers of the two roots of the characteristic polynomial formula_33; the generating function of the sequence is the rational function
: formula_34

===Binomial coefficients===
A simple example of a multidimensional recurrence relation is given by the binomial coefficients formula_35, which count the ways of selecting formula_2 elements out of a set of formula_1 elements.
They can be computed by the recurrence relation
:formula_38
with the base cases formula_39. Using this formula to compute the values of all binomial coefficients generates an infinite array called Pascal&#x27;s triangle. The same values can also be computed directly by a different formula that is not a recurrence, but uses factorials, multiplication and division, not just additions:
:formula_40

The binomial coefficients can also be computed with a uni-dimensional recurrence:
:formula_41
with the initial value formula_42 (The division is not displayed as a fraction for emphasizing that it must be computed after the multiplication, for not introducing fractional numbers).
This recurrence is widely used in computers because it does not require to build a table as does the bi-dimensional recurrence, and does involve very large integers as does the formula with factorials (if one uses formula_43 all involved integers are smaller than the final result).

== Difference operator and difference equations ==

The is an operator that maps sequences to sequences, and, more generally, functions to functions. It is commonly denoted formula_44 and is defined, in functional notation, as 
:formula_45
It is thus a special case of finite difference.

When using the index notation for sequences, the definition becomes
:formula_46
The parentheses around formula_47 and formula_48 are generally omitted, and formula_49 must be understood as the term of index in the sequence formula_50 and not formula_51 applied to the element formula_52

Given sequence formula_53 the of is formula_54

The is 
formula_55 A simple computation shows that
:formula_56

More generally: the &quot;th difference&quot; is defined recursively as formula_57 and one has
:formula_58

This relation can be inverted, giving
:formula_59

A of order is an equation that involves the first differences of a sequence or a function, in the same way as a differential equation of order relates the first derivatives of a function.

The two above relations allow transforming a recurrence relation of order into a difference equation of order , and, conversely, a difference equation of order into recurrence relation of order . Each transformation is the inverse of the other, and the sequences that are solution of the difference equation are exactly those that satisfies the recurrence relation.

For example, the difference equation
:formula_60
is equivalent to the recurrence relation
:formula_61
in the sense that the two equations are satisfied by the same sequences.

As it is equivalent for a sequence to satisfy a recurrence relation or to be the solution of a difference equation, the two terms &quot;recurrence relation&quot; and &quot;difference equation&quot; are sometimes used interchangeably. See Rational difference equation and Matrix difference equation for example of uses of &quot;difference equation&quot; instead of &quot;recurrence relation&quot;

Difference equations resemble differential equations, and this resemblance is often used to mimic methods for solving differentiable equations to apply to solving difference equations, and therefore recurrence relations.

Summation equations relate to difference equations as integral equations relate to differential equations. See time scale calculus for a unification of the theory of difference equations with that of differential equations.

===From sequences to grids===
Single-variable or one-dimensional recurrence relations are about sequences (i.e. functions defined on one-dimensional grids). Multi-variable or n-dimensional recurrence relations are about formula_1-dimensional grids. Functions defined on formula_1-grids can also be studied with partial difference equations.

== Solving ==

=== Solving linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients ===
===Solving first-order non-homogeneous recurrence relations with variable coefficients===
Moreover, for the general first-order non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation with variable coefficients:

:formula_64
there is also a nice method to solve it:
:formula_65
:formula_66

:formula_67

Let 
:formula_68
Then 
:formula_69
:formula_70
:formula_71
:formula_72

If we apply the formula to formula_73 and take the limit formula_74, we get the formula for first order linear differential equations with variable coefficients; the sum becomes an integral, and the product becomes the exponential function of an integral.

===Solving general homogeneous linear recurrence relations===
Many homogeneous linear recurrence relations may be solved by means of the generalized hypergeometric series. Special cases of these lead to recurrence relations for the orthogonal polynomials, and many special functions. For example, the solution to

:formula_75

is given by

:formula_76

the Bessel function, while

:formula_77

is solved by

:formula_78

the confluent hypergeometric series. Sequences which are the solutions of linear difference equations with polynomial coefficients are called P-recursive. For these specific recurrence equations algorithms are known which find polynomial, rational or hypergeometric solutions.

===Solving first-order rational difference equations===
A first order rational difference equation has the form formula_79. Such an equation can be solved by writing formula_80 as a nonlinear transformation of another variable formula_81 which itself evolves linearly. Then standard methods can be used to solve the linear difference equation in formula_81.

==Stability==

===Stability of linear higher-order recurrences===
The linear recurrence of order formula_83,

:formula_84

has the characteristic equation

:formula_85

The recurrence is stable, meaning that the iterates converge asymptotically to a fixed value, if and only if the eigenvalues (i.e., the roots of the characteristic equation), whether real or complex, are all less than unity in absolute value.

===Stability of linear first-order matrix recurrences===
In the first-order matrix difference equation

:formula_86

with state vector formula_87 and transition matrix formula_88, formula_87 converges asymptotically to the steady state vector formula_90 if and only if all eigenvalues of the transition matrix formula_88 (whether real or complex) have an absolute value which is less than 1.

===Stability of nonlinear first-order recurrences===
Consider the nonlinear first-order recurrence

:formula_92

This recurrence is locally stable, meaning that it converges to a fixed point formula_90 from points sufficiently close to formula_90, if the slope of formula_95 in the neighborhood of formula_90 is smaller than unity in absolute value: that is,

: formula_97

A nonlinear recurrence could have multiple fixed points, in which case some fixed points may be locally stable and others locally unstable; for continuous &quot;f&quot; two adjacent fixed points cannot both be locally stable.

A nonlinear recurrence relation could also have a cycle of period formula_2 for formula_99. Such a cycle is stable, meaning that it attracts a set of initial conditions of positive measure, if the composite function

:formula_100

with formula_95 appearing formula_2 times is locally stable according to the same criterion:

: formula_103

where formula_90 is any point on the cycle.

In a chaotic recurrence relation, the variable formula_87 stays in a bounded region but never converges to a fixed point or an attracting cycle; any fixed points or cycles of the equation are unstable. See also logistic map, dyadic transformation, and tent map.

== Relationship to differential equations ==
When solving an ordinary differential equation numerically, one typically encounters a recurrence relation. For example, when solving the initial value problem

:formula_106

with Euler&#x27;s method and a step size formula_107, one calculates the values

:formula_108

by the recurrence

:formula_109

Systems of linear first order differential equations can be discretized exactly analytically using the methods shown in the discretization article.

== Applications ==

=== Mathematical biology ===
Some of the best-known difference equations have their origins in the attempt to model population dynamics. For example, the Fibonacci numbers were once used as a model for the growth of a rabbit population.

The logistic map is used either directly to model population growth, or as a starting point for more detailed models of population dynamics. In this context, coupled difference equations are often used to model the interaction of two or more populations. For example, the Nicholson–Bailey model for a host-parasite interaction is given by

:formula_110
:formula_111

with formula_112 representing the hosts, and formula_113 the parasites, at time formula_114.

Integrodifference equations are a form of recurrence relation important to spatial ecology. These and other difference equations are particularly suited to modeling univoltine populations.

===Computer science===
Recurrence relations are also of fundamental importance in analysis of algorithms. If an algorithm is designed so that it will break a problem into smaller subproblems (divide and conquer), its running time is described by a recurrence relation.

A simple example is the time an algorithm takes to find an element in an ordered vector with formula_1 elements, in the worst case.

A naive algorithm will search from left to right, one element at a time. The worst possible scenario is when the required element is the last, so the number of comparisons is formula_1.

A better algorithm is called binary search. However, it requires a sorted vector. It will first check if the element is at the middle of the vector. If not, then it will check if the middle element is greater or lesser than the sought element. At this point, half of the vector can be discarded, and the algorithm can be run again on the other half. The number of comparisons will be given by

:formula_117
:formula_118

the time complexity of which will be formula_119.

=== Digital signal processing ===
In digital signal processing, recurrence relations can model feedback in a system, where outputs at one time become inputs for future time. They thus arise in infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filters.

For example, the equation for a &quot;feedforward&quot; IIR comb filter of delay formula_120 is:

:formula_121

where formula_81 is the input at time formula_114, formula_124 is the output at time formula_114, and formula_126 controls how much of the delayed signal is fed back into the output. From this we can see that

:formula_127
:formula_128

etc.

===Economics===

Recurrence relations, especially linear recurrence relations, are used extensively in both theoretical and empirical economics. In particular, in macroeconomics one might develop a model of various broad sectors of the economy (the financial sector, the goods sector, the labor market, etc.) in which some agents&#x27; actions depend on lagged variables. The model would then be solved for current values of key variables (interest rate, real GDP, etc.) in terms of past and current values of other variables.

<text>Non-lethal weapons, also called nonlethal weapons, less-lethal weapons, less-than-lethal weapons, non-deadly weapons, compliance weapons, or pain-inducing weapons are weapons intended to be less likely to kill a living target than conventional weapons such as knives and firearms with live ammunition. It is often understood that unintended or incidental casualties are risked wherever force is applied; however, non-lethal weapons minimise the risk of casualties (e.g. serious/permanent injuries or death) as much as possible. Non-lethal weapons are used in policing and combat situations to limit the escalation of conflict where employment of lethal force is prohibited or undesirable, where rules of engagement require minimum casualties, or where policy restricts the use of conventional force. However, these weapons occasionally cause serious injuries or death due to allergic reactions, improper use and/or other factors; for this reason the term &quot;less-lethal&quot; has been preferred by some organizations as it describes the risks of death more accurately than the term &quot;non-lethal&quot;, which some have argued is a misnomer.

Non-lethal weapons may be used by conventional military in a range of missions across the force continuum. They may also be used by military police, by United Nations forces, and by occupation forces for peacekeeping and stability operations. Non-lethal weapons may also be used to channelize a battlefield, control the movement of civilian populations, or to limit civilian access to restricted areas (as they were utilized by the USMC&#x27;s 1st Marine Expeditionary Force in Somalia in 1995). Similar weapons, tactics, techniques and procedures are employed by police forces domestically in riot control, prisoner control, crowd control, refugee control, and self-defense, where the terminology of &quot;less-than-lethal&quot; is often used.

==History==
===Military===
In the past, military and police faced with undesirable escalation of conflict had few acceptable options. Military personnel guarding embassies often found themselves restricted to carrying unloaded weapons. National guards or policing forces charged with quelling riots were able to use only batons or similar club-like weapons, or bayonet or sword charges, or fire live ammunition at crowds. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Non-lethality Policy Review Group at U.S. Global Strategy Council in Washington and other independent think tanks around the world called for a concerted effort to develop weapons that were more life-conserving, environmentally friendly, and fiscally responsible than weapons available at that time. The U.S. Congress and other governments agreed and began an organized development of non-lethal weapons to provide a range of options between talking and shooting.

Recognizing the need to limit the escalation of force, research and development of a range of non-lethal weapons has since been undertaken internationally by governments and weapons manufacturers to fill the need for such weapons. Some non-lethal weapons may provide more effective riot control than firearms, truncheons or bayonets with less risk of loss of life or serious injury. Before the general availability of early military non-lethal weapons in the mid 1990s, war-fighters had few or no casualty-limiting options for the employment of scalable force and were continually at risk whenever lethal force was prohibited during sensitive missions.

In 2001, the United States Marine Corps revealed its development of a less-than-lethal energy weapon called the Active Denial System, a focused high frequency microwave device said to be capable of heating all living matter in the target area rapidly and continuously for the duration of the beam, causing transient intolerable pain but no lasting damage. The skin temperature of a person subjected to this weapon can jump to approximately in as little as 2 seconds depending on the skin&#x27;s starting temperature. The system is nonlethal (the penetration of the beam into human skin is only a few millimeters).

In 2004, author Jon Ronson cited an unclassified military report titled &quot;Non-Lethal Weapons: Terms and References&quot; 21 acoustic weapons were listed, in various stages of development, including the Infrasound (&quot;Very low-frequency sound which can travel long distances and easily penetrate most buildings and vehicles ... biophysical effects are projected to be: nausea, loss of bowels, disorientation, vomiting, potential internal organ damage or death may occur. Superior to ultrasound...)&quot;, however no such effects had been achieved .

In 2010, the &quot;Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate Non-Lethal Weapons Reference Book&quot; was created. The weapons in this book are currently in development.

===Police===

Until the development of non-lethal weapons, police officers around the world had few if any non-lethal options for riot control. Common tactics used by police that were intended to be non-lethal or less lethal included a slowly advancing wall of men with batons, officers on horses trained to deal with policing situations, or a charge into a riot using the flats of sabers. Other reasonably successful approaches included shotguns with lower-powered cartridges, &quot;salt shells&quot;, using bean-bag rounds and ricocheting shots off of the ground. In the mid-20th century, with the integration of fire-control systems into major cities, police found that high-pressure fire hoses could be effective in dispersing a crowd (the use of water cannons and fire trucks has remained an effective non-lethal tactic to disperse riots). Trained police dogs were also commonly used to scare and disperse rioters and apprehend individuals. In the 1980s the development of high-tensile plastics like Kevlar and Lexan revolutionized personal armor and shields, and led to new tactics for riot squads and other special-purpose teams. Officers could now stand up against violent rioters throwing dangerous projectiles without having to resort to lethal methods to quickly disperse the danger. Coupled with the introduction of effective non-lethal chemical agents such as tear gas and offensive-odor canisters, and non-lethal impact rounds such as rubber bullets and &quot;bean bag&quot; flexible baton rounds, riot tactics were modified to rely less on violent response to attacking rioters than on a return to the slowly advancing wall, with supporting officers firing non-lethal ordnance into the crowd to discourage advance.

Police officers on patrol were traditionally armed with batons or pistols or both, and non-lethal methods of subduing an attacker centered on hand-fighting techniques such as jujutsu and baton use. In the 1980s and 1990s officers began deploying non-lethal personal sidearms such as pepper sprays, and eventually electroshock weapons such as tasers, which were developed for use by police and also found a market in self-defense by private citizens. However, these weapons were developed for non-lethal resolution of one-on-one conflicts.

During the 1990s and early 2000s (decade), interest in various other forms of less-than-lethal weapons for military and police use rose. Amongst other factors, the use of less-than-lethal weapons may be legal under international law and treaty in situations where weapons such as aerosol sprays or gases defined as chemical are not.

Between the years of 1987–1990, after a three-year field study by the FBI&#x27;s Firearms Training Unit; In 1990, the use of oleoresin capsicum was approved and used by the FBI, the first official law enforcement agency to do so.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade), police began to adopt a new pepper spray delivery system based on the equipment used in paintball. A specialized paintball, called a &quot;pepperball&quot;, is filled with liquid or powdered capsaicin, the active ingredient in pepper spray, and is propelled by compressed gas using a paintball marker similar to those used for the sport but operating at a higher pressure. The impact of the capsule is immediately painful (a pepperball&#x27;s shell is thicker than a standard paintball and is fired at a higher velocity), and it breaks open on impact, dispersing the capsaicin with similar effect to aerosol-delivered pepper spray. However, to be most effective, pepper spray must contact the eyes, nose, or mouth of the target; pepper spray on clothing or tougher skin has a much reduced effect.

==Effects==

Non-lethal weapons have a design intent to provide an effect to reliably elicit a degree of incapacitation but without the typically lethal or permanent lasting effects of conventional weapons. This design intent has often made them a weapon of choice for use by law enforcement during civil protests, etc. Effect modalities vary by the technology being employed: kinetic projectiles function by blunt impact which actuate pain receptors to elicit a behavioral change, lights affect visual perception, acoustics affect hearing, etc.

Notwithstanding their design intent, non-lethal weapons can still cause harm. This is particularly true with certain technologies that interact with appropriately vulnerable regions; an example is kinetic munitions on the head, neck, eyes, abdominal and urogenital regions of the body. As a result, some analysts describe &quot;non-lethal&quot; as a misnomer and recommend defining them as &quot;less-lethal&quot;, whereas other sources identify &quot;non-lethal&quot; as representing a goal of minimization of producing fatalities or permanent injuries while not literally requiring minimization to a zero probability thereof.

==Mechanics==

Non-lethal weapons are intended to minimize injury or death. While people are occasionally seriously injured or killed by these weapons, fatalities are relatively infrequent. Causes of death from non-lethal weapons are varied and occasionally uncertain. Misplaced or ricocheting shots, pre-existing medical conditions, inadequate user training, repetitive applications and intentional misuse have been implicated in different cases where death has occurred.

As different parts of the body differ in vulnerability, and because people vary in weight and fitness, any weapon powerful enough to incapacitate may be capable of killing under certain circumstances. Thus, &quot;non-lethal force&quot; does have some risk of causing death: in this context, &quot;non-lethal&quot; means only &quot;not &quot;intended&quot; to kill&quot;.

Several groups maintain there is great room for improvement in non-lethal weapons and procedures for their use. Claims for the relative safety of such weapons are usually contingent on their being used &quot;properly&quot;. For example, the rubber bullets developed during the 1960s were supposed to be fired at the ground and hit the target only after ricochet, and other non-lethal bullets are designed to be fired at the lower body; they can be lethal if fired directly at the head.

==Ammunition==
Non-lethal rounds are firearm rounds which are designed to incapacitate, but not kill, a target. The rounds rely on the transfer of kinetic energy and blunt force trauma to accomplish this incapacitation. Rubber bullets, rubber buckshot, soft polymer rounds, wax bullets, plastic bullets, beanbag rounds, sponge grenades, ring airfoil projectiles (both kinetic and tear gas projectiles) and rubber bullets with electroshock effect (e.g. Taser XREP rounds) are less lethal than conventional metal bullets, and are also propelled at lower speed by using less propellant. &quot;Bean bag&quot; type bullets are sometimes referred to as flexible baton rounds. More recently, high-velocity paintball guns are also used to launch less-lethal rounds, including the FN 303 launcher and PepperBall commercial products. There is also the Variable Velocity Weapon Concept, for which a propulsion energy source may not yet have been clearly established and/or finalized. In any case, all of these technologies apply the same basic mechanism, which is to launch a mass at the target that interacts kinetically.
==Explosives==
Hand grenades come in several less-lethal varieties, such as &quot;flashbang&quot; (stun) grenades, &quot;sting&quot; grenades with rubber shrapnel, and grenades designed to release chemical irritants (described below).

In 1972, stun grenades were used to capture the hijacked Sabena Flight 571, allowing the Israeli forces headed by Ehud Barak and including Benjamin Netanyahu to storm the plane and take it over within 10 minutes while capturing two terrorists and killing Ali Taha, the leader of the terrorist group and his aide, while rescuing all passengers (three were wounded, and one died of her injuries several days later).

A stun grenade was apparently used by members of the IHH against the IDF soldiers during the Gaza flotilla raid at the beginning of the IDF storming of the Mavi Marmara.

In June 2010, in Kenya, a stun grenade was used to draw attention, and then a real grenade along with an explosive package were used, killing many people. In April, during the 2010 Kyrgyzstani uprising, police attempted to use stun grenades to stop a demonstration but the crowd overwhelmed the police. In March stun grenades were used by Belarusian police in Minsk against demonstrators, and in September they were used by Greek police in Athens. In these latter two cases, the demonstrations were dispersed with no injuries.

In February 2011, stun grenades were seen used by Egyptian police against rioters.

==Gases and sprays==
===Water===
Water cannons are commonly used in crowd and riot control, for dispersal or to prevent movement on a particular position. These water cannons are intended to disperse crowds with little risk of harm, but the pressure can still cause eye injuries or even death. Water-filled rounds for small arms are in experimental stages.
Electrified water cannons were in development but was abandoned.

===Scent-based weapons===
Malodorants produce strong odours that cause people to leave the affected area. In 2008, the Israeli Defence Forces began using Skunk for crowd control. It is a form of mist sprayed from a water cannon, which leaves a terrible odor of rot or sewage on whatever it touches, and does not wash off easily.

===Pepper spray===
The active ingredient in pepper spray is oleoresin capsicum (OC), an acrid irritant chemical derived from cayenne pepper plants.

A 1998 estimate by the International Association of Chiefs of Police suggested at least 113 pepper spray-related fatalities had occurred in the United States, all with aggravating factors such as intoxication, pre-existing health problems, or from the police use of airway-restrictive immobilizing holds that can cause positional asphyxia. The Southern California chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union recommends against maximal prone restraint techniques following pepper spray application, and they caution that anyone sprayed should be monitored to ensure effective breathing.

===Tear gas===

The use of chemical weapons such as tear gas (CS) and pepper spray (OC) has come under increasing scrutiny and criticism due to studies showing serious long term side effects. Many police forces are no longer exposing their members to the chemicals during training.

Journalist Rubén Salazar was killed in Los Angeles in 1970 by an errant CS gas canister during the Chicano riots. Other serious injuries and fatalities have occurred from either tear gas itself or the projectiles it is delivered in, including the critical injury of veteran Scott Olsen from a tear gas canister during the 2011 Occupy Oakland protests.

===Psychochemical===

Psychochemical weapons are psychoactive drugs, such as BZ, LSD, Kolokol-1, EA-3167, and 3-Methylamphetamine designed to have a disorienting effect when used during combat or interrogation.

===Sleep gas===
During the 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis, Russian special forces used an unidentified gas (thought to be 3-methylfentanyl or another fentanyl variant dissolved in halothane gas) in an attempt to induce sleep in both hostages and terrorists. Many of the hostages and terrorists (including all of the suicide bombers) were anesthetized, but some terrorists donned gas masks and thus were able to avoid the effects of the gas. Because the agent used was a potent Fentanyl derivative (a synthetic opioid), it causes respiratory depression and ultimately respiratory failure if administered in high enough dosages. The central nervous system effects, such as anesthesia and respiratory depression could have been reversed by an opioid antagonist such as naloxone, which is stocked by hospitals and most ambulances. However, because the Russian authorities did not release any information regarding what type of agent was used, medical professionals were unaware that an opioid had been used during the rescue attempt and thus were unable to administer the antidote which could have saved most hostages. Approximately 700 hostages were rescued, while 130 died from exposure to the gas. All the terrorists were ultimately killed by Russian forces through some combination of gas exposure and gunfire.

===Other chemical agents===

Blister agents, including CR gas, are less often used riot control agents. Other irritants include CS gas and nonivamide (PAVA).

==Sticky foam==

Sticky foam was tried by the U.S. Marine Corps in the peacekeeping Operation United Shield in 1995 with some success, but as a result various complications in its field use were also discovered.

==Area denial==

Area denial weapons work by either incapacitating or deterring the enemy.

===Anti-vehicle===
Vehicle stoppers include a wide range of methods and devices meant to disable a vessel or vehicle to prevent attack by an oncoming vessel or vehicle or to stop that vessel or vehicle for evaluation. Vessel and vehicle stoppers may include kinetic, chemical, or electromagnetic means.

=== Anti-personnel ===
==== Caltrops ====
Simple rows or clusters of sharpened sticks (also known as punji sticks), and the use of small caltrops have been a feature of anti-infantry warfare for centuries. They are known to have been in use since Roman times and may have been used earlier: the concept was familiar to the 4th century BC Greeks, who used rocks, brush, nets and trees placed in the path of enemy conveyances on land or ensnarement devices hidden under water to achieve the same result: stop the enemy or suspected hostile in his tracks for examination or to prevent or limit incursions. Contemporary caltrops look something like large jacks from the childhood game. Placed in the path of oncoming wheeled or tracked vehicles, they are meant to foul wheels, destroy tires and tracks, and incapacitate vehicles.

However, due to the difficulty of mass-producing them in the pre-modern age, they were rarely used except in the defense of limited areas or chokepoints, especially during sieges, where they were used to help seal breaches. Increasing ease of production still did not prevent these methods from slowly falling out of favor from the late Middle Ages onward.
Caltrops are still sometimes used in modern conflicts, such as during the Korean War, where Chinese troops, often wearing only light shoes, were particularly vulnerable. In modern times, special caltrops are also sometimes used against wheeled vehicles with pneumatic tires. Some South American urban guerrillas as the Tupamaros and Montoneros called them &quot;miguelitos&quot; and used these as a tactic to avoid pursuit after ambushes.

==Riot gun==
In current usage a riot gun or less-lethal launcher is a type of firearm that is used to fire &quot;non-lethal&quot; or &quot;less-lethal&quot; ammunition for the purpose of suppressing riots. Less-lethal launchers may be special purpose firearms designed for riot control use, or standard firearms, usually shotguns and grenade launchers, adapted to riot control use with appropriate ammunition. The ammunition is most commonly found in 12 gauge (18.5 mm/.729 inch) shotguns and 37mm (1.46 inch) or 40mm (1.57 inch) grenade launchers.

In the United States, the term riot gun more commonly refers to a riot shotgun.

==Electroshock weapons==
Electroshock weapons are incapacitant weapons used for subduing a person by administering electric shock aimed at disrupting superficial muscle functions. One type is a conductive energy device (CED), an electroshock gun popularly known by the brand name &quot;Taser&quot;, which fires projectiles that administer the shock through a thin, flexible wire. Other electroshock weapons such as stun guns, stun batons, and electroshock belts administer an electric shock by direct contact.

==Directed energy weapons==
Directed energy weapons are weapons that emit energy in an aimed direction without the means of a projectile. They are non-lethal and can immobilize people as well as machines (e.g. vehicles). Directed energy weapons include electromagnetic weapons, (including laser weapons) and microwave weapons, particle beam weapons, sonic weapons and plasma weapons.

===Ultraviolet laser===
HSV Technologies, Inc. (named for its founders, Herr, Schlesinger and Vernon; not to be confused with Holden Special Vehicles), formerly of San Diego, California, USA, then Port Orchard, WA, designed a non-lethal device which was profiled in the 2002 &quot;TIME&quot; magazine article &quot;Beyond the Rubber Bullet&quot;. It is an electrolaser using ultraviolet laser beams of 193 nm, and promises to immobilize living targets at a distance without contact. There is plan for an engine-disabling variation for use against the electronic ignitions of cars using a 248 nm laser. The lead inventor, Eric Herr, died in 2008 and the company appears to have been dissolved, with their website defunct as of September 2017.

===Pulsed energy projectile===
Pulsed energy projectiles or (PEP) is a technology of non-lethal directed energy weaponry currently under development by the US military. It involves the emission of an invisible laser pulse which, upon contact with the target, ablates the surface and creates a small amount of exploding plasma. This produces a pressure wave designed to stun the target and knock them off their feet, and electromagnetic radiation that affects nerve cells causing a painful sensation.

The pulsed energy projectile is intended for riot control and is said to work over distances of up to 2 km. It weighs about 230 kg and will probably be mounted on vehicles. The weight could become lighter as laser production technology improves.

The system was developed by Mission Research Corporation (now owned by Orbital ATK). It uses a chemical deuterium fluoride laser device producing infrared laser pulses. The plasma (produced by the early part of the pulse) explodes because its electrons absorb the energy of the later part of the pulse.

In 2003, a US military review reported that the electromagnetic radiation produced by PEPs had been shown to cause pain and temporary paralysis in animal experiments.

United States Special Operations Command FY 2010 plans included starting developmental work on a counter UAV pulsed energy projectile.

===Active denial system===
An active denial system (ADS) is a dish that projects electromagnetic radiation just powerful enough to penetrate human skin and make the victim feel as though they are on fire, although no physical damage is done.

The ADS is a non-lethal, directed-energy weapon developed by the US military, designed for area denial, perimeter security and crowd control. Informally, the weapon has also been referred to as a &quot;heat ray&quot;, since it works by heating the surface of targets, such as the skin of targeted human subjects.

In 2011, the ADS was redesigned to make it smaller, more reliable, and able to be used on the move. The ADS II is being designed to operate from moving aircraft, as well as moving ground vehicles. The redesign does not address problems in different environmental conditions.

Air Force Special Operations Command is experimenting with mounting an ADS on the AC-130J Ghostrider gunship to target threatening crowds or individuals on the ground. This is to give the gunship a non-lethal option so the crew has more engagement options. Due to the increasing number of engagements in populated areas, the Air Force is aiming to field a system within 10 years to have enough aircraft available with non-lethal systems. The aircraft will apparently use the ADS II version.

=== Dazzler ===
A dazzler is a directed-energy weapon intended to temporarily blind or disorient its target with intense directed radiation. Targets can include sensors or human vision. Dazzlers emit infrared or invisible light against various electronic sensors, and visible light against humans, when they are intended to cause no long-term damage to eyes. The emitters are usually lasers, making what is termed a &quot;laser dazzler&quot;. Most of the contemporary systems are man-portable, and operate in either the red (a laser diode) or green (a diode-pumped solid-state laser, DPSS) areas of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Initially developed for military use, non-military products are becoming available for use in law enforcement and security.

Weapons designed to cause permanent blindness are banned by the 1995 United Nations Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons. The dazzler is a non-lethal weapon intended to cause temporary blindness or disorientation and therefore falls outside this protocol.
The personnel halting and stimulation response rifle (PHASR) is a prototype non-lethal laser dazzler developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory&#x27;s Directed Energy Directorate, U.S. Department of Defense. Its purpose is to temporarily disorient and blind a target. Blinding laser weapons have been tested in the past, but were banned under the 1995 UN Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons, which the United States acceded to on 21 January 2009. The PHASR rifle, a low-intensity laser, is not prohibited under this regulation, as the blinding effect is intended to be temporary. It also uses a two-wavelength laser. The PHASR was tested at Kirtland Air Force Base, part of the Air Force Research Laboratory Directed Energy Directorate in New Mexico.

====Blinding laser weapons====
Several nations developed blinding laser weapons and they were allegedly used during the war in Donbas by Russia.

==== Long Range Acoustic Device ====
The Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) is an acoustic hailing device developed by LRAD Corporation to send messages and warning tones over longer distances or at higher volume than normal loudspeakers. LRAD systems are used for long-range communications in a variety of applications including as a means of non-lethal, non-kinetic crowd control. Though they have been called &quot;sonic weapons&quot;, LRADs are not inherently for military use. The round black devices on top of New York City police Hummers are LRADs.

According to the manufacturer&#x27;s specifications, the systems weigh from and can emit sound in a 30°- 60° beam at 2.5 kHz. The manufacturer also produces systems for public address and mass notification use that broadcast 360°.

===Safety and legal status===
In the United States, the University of Texas-Austin Institute for Advanced Technology (IAT) conducts basic research to advance electrodynamics and hypervelocity physics related to electromagnetic weapons.

Although generally considered &quot;non-lethal weapons&quot;, electromagnetic weapons do pose health threats to humans. In fact, &quot;non-lethal weapons can sometimes be deadly.&quot;

United States Department of Defense policy explicitly states that non-lethal weapons &quot;shall not be required to have a zero probability of producing fatalities or permanent injuries.&quot; Although a Human Effects Advisory Panel was established in 1998 to provide independent assessment on human effects, data, and models for the use of &#x27;non-lethal weapons&#x27; on the general population, the TECOM Technology Symposium in 1997 concluded on non-lethal weapons: &quot;Determining the target effects on personnel is the greatest challenge to the testing community,&quot; primarily because &quot;the potential of injury and death severely limits human tests.&quot; However, &quot;directed energy weapons that target the central nervous system and cause neurophysiological disorders&quot; may violate the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons of 1980. And weapons that go beyond non-lethal intentions and cause &quot;superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering&quot; could violate the Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1977.&quot; Safety and evaluation of the physical and psychological effects of the long-term or repetitive uses of the pain-inducing non-lethal weapons on humans have not been well understood or studied in any great details. Any such studies require explicit consent of all participants so as not to violate the UN Convention against torture and other cruelties.

== Misuse ==
Pepper spray is one non-lethal weapon alleged to have been misused by American police. In two incidents in California in 1997, police swabbed pepper spray directly into the eyes of protesters. Amnesty International condemned these actions, and claimed that they were likely a violation of the 1984 United Nations Convention Against Torture.

==Terrorism concerns==
Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute in Virginia states that: &quot;The relevant (electromagnetic weapon) technology is well within the grasp of some countries and transnational terrorist groups&quot;, and further states that U.S. hardware is susceptible to microwave and other directed-energy weapons.

Suitable materials and tools to create electromagnetic weapons are commonly available. &quot;The threat of electromagnetic bomb proliferation is very real.&quot;
