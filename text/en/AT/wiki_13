<text>Ione is a town in Pend Oreille County, Washington, United States. The population was 428 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Ione was first settled in 1894 by homesteader Elmer Hall. Ione was officially incorporated on January 3, 1910.

The timber industry played a major role in Ione&#x27;s history. In the early 1900&#x27;s, Frederick A. Blackwell&#x27;s Panhandle Lumber Company opened the inland northwest&#x27;s first all-electric sawmill in Ione. The timber-based economy persisted for nearly 100 years in Ione, lasting until 1995 when the Vaagen Brothers&#x27; sawmill, the last major sawmill in the country, closed down.

The railroad reached Ione in 1910 when Blackwell built the Idaho &amp; Washington Northern Railroad, connecting Ione with Metaline Falls in the north and Newport in the south.

When Pend Oreille County was established in 1911, Ione was one of four towns vying to land the county seat, along with Newport, Cusick, and Usk, with the honors being awarded to Newport in 1912.

==Geography==
Ione is situated on the west bank of the Pend Oreille River as it flows north towards Canada. Big Muddy Creek, Little Muddy Creek and Cedar Creek, from south to north, join the river in Ione. State Route 31 passes through town. Ione Bridge, on the southern edge of town, is the only road crossing of the Pend Oreille between Metaline Falls to the north and Usk to the south. Being located in the Selkirk Mountains, the area immediately surrounding Ione is of high topographic relief. The town itself is on a relatively flat area along the river at an elevation of 2,090 feet above sea level, but the mountains rise dramatically both sides of the Pend Oreille. Cement Mountain, with its peak roughly a mile immediately north of town, rises to 3,003 feet. Molybdenite Mountain, across the river from Ione, rises even higher to 6,788 feet.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

<text>Metaline Falls is a town in Pend Oreille County, Washington, United States. The population was 272 at the 2020 census.

==History==
By 1810, European fur traders were crossing the area. The settlement of Metaline Falls was founded in 1900, with most of its residents then employed by the Mammoth and Morning lead-zinc mines. Metaline Falls was officially incorporated on May 3, 1911.

The name Metaline comes from the abundance of lead ore, galena, found in the region. Though these lead deposits were known since 1869, mining did not commence until 1886. Then in 1910, Metaline Falls was connected with the Idaho and Washington Northern Railroad. The Lehigh Portland Cement Co. plant was soon built, taking advantage of the region&#x27;s limestone deposits. The Pend Oreille Mine was developed in 1929 by Lewis P. Larsen, and combined with production from the Grandview Mine and the Metaline Mine, the area became the state&#x27;s largest producer of lead and zinc.

In 1942, Executive Order 9066 was issued, resulting in the forced internment of 120,000 Japanese-Americans. George Kubota, Sr., the patriarch of a Japanese-American family who ran a hardware store in town, was arrested and imprisoned by the FBI in Spokane. The editors of the Metaline Falls newspaper and the majority of residents in town protested the arrest, vouching for the Kubota family&#x27;s loyalty. The FBI eventually released Kubota from custody and did not send the family to an internment camp.

<text>Newport is a city in and the county seat of Pend Oreille County, Washington, United States. The population was 2,114 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Newport was given its name in 1890 due to its selection as a landing site for the first steamboat on the Pend Oreille River. Newport was officially incorporated on April 13, 1903. The first river bridge was built in 1906, and was replaced in 1926, and again in 1988.

In 1935, Newport City Marshall George Conniff was killed during a robbery at the Newport Creamery by multiple Spokane police officers. The case went stagnant for decades until Pend Oreille County Sheriff, Tony Bamonte took interest in the 1980s.The weapon believed to have killed Conniff was found in the Spokane River underneath the Post Street Bridge in 1989. A book was published about it in 1992 by Timothy Egan.

Newport began a tourism campaign in 1987 that involved planting hundreds of national, state, and city flags to transform itself into the &quot;City of Flags&quot;. The scheme was abandoned a decade later after issues with theft and maintenance. There are no remaining flag structures in Newport today.

On July 14, 2015, an explosion took place at Zodiac Aerospace. Five people were injured, and people were urged to stay at least 2000 feet from the facility.

==Geography==
Newport is located at an elevation of 2,160 feet (658.5 m) and according to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

The town of Oldtown, Idaho, is just to the east of Newport, and on the Pend Oreille River. There are no natural or physical barriers between the two towns, and it is strictly a political division, separated by the straight-line state boundary.

About one-half mile north of Newport, the Pend Oreille River enters Washington state and flows north to Canada. The watershed of the Pend Oreille in the Newport-Oldtown area west of the river is extremely limited. This is due to a small depression of no more than , which begins about one-half mile from the river. Unable to flow uphill, the waters (from natural springs, rainfall runoff, etc.) eventually form the Little Spokane River, and flow southwest towards Spokane.

Diamond Lake (elevation 2,345 ft.) is about to the southwest, and is also part of the Little Spokane River watershed (outflow only) via a creek runoff from the uninhabited far west end of the lake.

<text>Artondale is a census-designated place (CDP) in Pierce County, Washington, United States. The population was 13,641 at the 2020 census.

==Parks and recreation==
Artondale contains several PenMet Parks. Wollochet Bay Estuary Park is a 20.3-acre park with 854 feet of shoreline located to the east of Wollochet Dr NW. The park contains and protects the saltwater marsh where freshwater from Artondale Creek mixes with saltwater from Wollochet Bay, creating a unique ecosystem important to the area&#x27;s bird population. The park is considered to be &quot;undeveloped&quot;, consisting mainly of an open grassy area with some crabapple trees. Views of the estuary and access to the creek and the bay are limited by trees and other foliage. The park is most easily accessed when heading north on Wollochet Dr NW, where one can make a sharp right curve into the gravel road adjacent to a private driveway. This gravel road is the only parking available. Parking is not usually an issue at this park.

Harbor Family Park, located at the intersection of 70th Ave NW and 32nd St NW, is a relatively recent addition to the park system made up of areas that were once private residences. Now the houses are gone, and only a few concrete foundations and traces of old, dirt driveways remain, though neighboring houses can often be glimpsed through the trees. The park consists of dirt trails that wind their way through 18.7 acres of lush, second-growth forest. The gravel parking lot can be accessed via either 70th Ave NW or 32nd St NW. At the parking lot, a trashcan and entrance sign mark the start of the trails. Trails can also be accessed by foot at several places along 70th Ave NW. The trails are popular with dog-walkers and runners. The trails are unmarked and often diverge and converge unexpectedly, so users unfamiliar with the area may want to stick to the trails close to 70th Ave NW, where the sounds and glimpses of cars keep one from getting lost.

Hales Pass Park is technically a part of the Artondale CDP, though it is traditionally associated with the community of Arletta. The stone building and attached picnic shelter on the site were originally constructed by the Civilian Conservation Core in 1938 to serve as the Arletta School. The building currently houses the Arletta Montessori preschool. Adjacent to the school building is a small baseball field. Tucked away off 36th St NW behind a bus barn are two public tennis courses.

==Education==
Artondale Elementary School is a public school offering kindergarten through fifth grade for youngsters within the Peninsula School District. In addition to providing an education for its &quot;Otters&quot;, the adjacent playing fields and playground equipment function as an additional park for the area. On snowy days, toddlers and teens alike flock to the hills on the playfields to sled, build snowmen, or have snowball fights. In the summertime, neighborhood kids will scramble over the jungle gyms while nearby, community sports teams practice and compete at one of the four baseball diamonds. The Artondale Elementary School Campus also houses several classes of the Gig Harbor Coop preschool.

Voyager Elementary School and Kopachuck Middle School sit near the Western edge of the Artondale CDP. Both schools serve students of the Peninsula School District. Voyager offers grades from kindergarten-5th grade, while Kopachuck offers 6-8th grade. The majority of Kopachuck students are graduates of either Voyager or Artondale, both of which funnel into Kopachuck Middle School. Most students from Kopachuck will go on to Gig Harbor High School for grades 9–12. Voyager&#x27;s mascot is the Vikings, while Kopachuck is the home of the Coyotes. Both schools are across the street from Kopachuck State Park, the only state park on the Gig Harbor Peninsula.

==Notable places==
The Artondale Grange is the most historic building in Artondale. Even as farming has declined in the area, the Grange has remained as a landmark and community center, housing everything from Girl Scout meetings to Haunted Houses.

Artondale also has its own community cemetery, located off of Hunt St NW. This small, historic cemetery offers grassy, shaded plots.

The cowfarm located near where 40th St NW becomes Wollochet Dr NW also serves as an iconic landmark and a reminder of the agrarian roots of the Artondale community.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 13.8 square miles (35.8 km2), of which, 13.6 square miles (35.2 km2) of it is land and 0.25 square miles (0.7 km2) of it (1.82%) is water. The Artondale CDP encompasses parts of other communities not normally considered a part of Artondale by locals, such as parts of Cromwell, Warren and Arletta to the south, Sylvia Lake and Rosedale to the northwest, and Wollochet and Midway to the northeast. The more &quot;traditional&quot; area of Artondale is usually considered to be the portions of the CDP south of Hunt St NW, west of Wollochet Dr NW, north of 32nd St NW, and east of 92nd Ave NW.

Artondale Creek runs through Artondale, before emptying out into Wollochet Bay. Public access to the creek is very limited, though the creek and the opening into Wollochet Bay can be viewed from the pedestrian sidewalk near the intersection of Wollochet Drive NW and Artondale Drive NW, or by exploring through Wollochet Bay Estuary Park. Artondale Creek is known to be a salmon spawning site.

==Climate==
Similar to most of the Puget Sound region, Artondale has a wet and mild climate. Though rainfall per year is only slightly above average (41.67 inches vs. 39.2 in.), this rainfall is spread out, creating a higher average number of days with precipitation (131.5 days compared to the national average of 102 days), and a lower-than-average number of &quot;sunny&quot; days (142 days compared to a national average of 205 days). Many days are both &quot;sunny&quot; and &quot;cloudy&quot;, with clouds moving quickly in and out of the area. The three months with highest rainfall are January, November, and December. Snow is a rare occurrence in Artondale, with an average of less than 2 inches per year. The snow that does fall tends to be very wet, and snowfall often occurs when temperatures are hovering right around freezing, which can lead to the formation of black ice and dangerous driving conditions. This does not mean that below-freezing days are rare. It&#x27;s not uncommon to have week-long spells of winter days with lows in the 20s and highs in the mid-to-low 30s. However, usually when the temperature drops, the clouds break up leading to two common winter weather scenarios: cold and clear, or warm and rainy. The coldest month of the year is December, with an average high of 45 °F and an average low of 36 °F. Windstorms are a fairly regular occurrence, especially from October to January. The main hazards created by windstorms are related to natural debris (such as branches or small trees) falling onto homes, roadways or power lines.

The &quot;dry&quot; season lasts from May to September, with an average of less than 3 inches of rain falling per month. The driest month of the year is July. Though overall precipitation in August is low, this is also the month with the most thunderstorms (both &quot;wet&quot; and &quot;dry&quot;). These storms are often accompanied by sheet lightning; fork lightning is rare. June and early July tend to be cloudy or overcast in the morning, with the cloud cover burning off as the day goes on. The hottest time of the day tends to be in the late afternoon, between 2 and 4 pm. Houses with air-conditioning are few and far between, so on the rare days when the temperature soars above 85 degrees, locals tend to flock to the water or places known to have air-conditioning, such as the movie theater. Kopachuck State Park is an especially popular destination for those with neither air-conditioning, nor waterfront access. The hottest months are July and August, which both have average lows in the mid-50s and an average high of 75 °F.

==Transportation==

Bonney Lake is bisected by State Route 410, which has connections to the rest of the Seattle metropolitan area as well as the northeast side of Mount Rainier. Public transportation service within the city was provided by Pierce Transit until 2012, when Bonney Lake left the transit agency&#x27;s public transportation benefit area. The city&#x27;s local bus service had been cut due to earlier funding shortages and the failure of a countywide sales tax measure to fund operations. A peak-only route that connects to Sumner station, with onward Sounder commuter rail service to Seattle, was discontinued by Pierce Transit in June 2012 and transferred to Sound Transit. Bonney Lake continued to be within the Sound Transit district boundaries; its Pierce Transit-owned park-and-ride lot was acquired by Sound Transit in 2014.

<doc id="138134" wikidata="Q1516263" url="?curid=138134" title="Carbonado, Washington">
<text>Carbonado () is a town in Pierce County, Washington, United States. It is located near the Carbon River in the north of the county, approximately southeast of Seattle. Carbonado is the last town before entering Mount Rainier National Park Carbon River Entrance. The town also served as an important coal mining community in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when the town operated the largest coal mine in Pierce County. The population was 734 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Carbonado was one of several in the Carbon River valley to be settled during an economic boom in the region. The boom was brought on by the demand for raw material in nearby growing cities such as Seattle and Tacoma. Starting with the town of Wilkeson and moving on through Burnett, Carbonado, Montezuma, Fairfax, and finally Manley Moore, these settlements sprawled up the valley to the very boundary of Mount Rainier National Park. Most of these towns were company towns, meaning that they specialized in the harvest of raw materials on the plot of land that the town was situated on ,which was owned by a commercial company. Often – and such was the case of Carbonado – the company owned the houses and energy resources as well. The energy resource in Carbonado was also the raw material that the citizens of the company town were harvesting, coal.

More than 100 miners died in mining accidents in and around Carbonado, including 31 who were killed in an explosion in Carbon Hill Coal Company&#x27;s Mine Number 7 on December 9, 1899.

During the time of the initial boom in the valley, Carbonado grew to rival the size of Tacoma. The railroad, integral to the transportation of people, supplies and exported materials, extended all the way up the valley, servicing the towns and several homesteads. These were settled predominantly by Polish immigrants, and supplied the towns down the valley with fresh milk and eggs. Two survive today, one known as Carbon River Ranch (the main house is the old Fairfax school and can be seen from Washington State Route 165) and the other formerly known as Huckle-Chuck. At Huckle-Chuck, the original house and one of the barns are still used and functional. At the peak of the boom both of these homesteads and the towns which they supplied were quite productive and lively.

However, the boom did not last as the economy suffered a downturn, and with it came the end of the need for the lower-grade coal being mined at Carbonado and the timber being harvested for use in the settlements further up the valley. Since the decline of the mining era, Carbonado has experienced extreme shrinking and small booms ultimately ending with a steady population. All of the current residents work elsewhere and what was once an economic center for the valley is now a residential community. The railroad also pulled out of the town. The Rails to Trails project has most of the actual rail line land in its possession.

The time that Carbonado did spend as a coal mining town is evidenced by the cemetery, abandoned mines, an overgrown coal slag pile, a school, and the company houses left behind. The cemetery holds the memories of older and more recent dead with many of the grave holders&#x27; family still living nearby. Huge concrete monoliths that once held that cables for the mining carts point straight towards the old mine shafts and openings and stand overgrown and now only utilized by the town&#x27;s children. One hill in the town started out as the coal slag pile and now has been carpeted by ivy and trees. The school makes up what is known as the Carbonado Historical School District and grades K-8th still attend there. Many of the houses that the company built and originally owned still line main street. They look very similar to each other as was the style of the company builders at the time. Although many of the miners abandoned the town, the direct descendants of the original miners still live in some of the houses.

Carbonado was officially incorporated on September 13, 1948.

<text>DuPont is a city in Pierce County, Washington, United States. The population was 10,151 at the 2020 census. Originally a company town, the city is named after the DuPont chemical company which operated an explosives manufacturing plant in the area from 1909 to 1975.

==History==
There was a Native American presence in the area for the last 10,000 years. At the time of contact the Nisqually Tribe lived in relative peace and prosperity in their aboriginal homeland of about two million acres (810,000 ha) near the present-day towns of Olympia, Tenino, and DuPont, and extending to Mount Rainier. Tribal life changed radically with the advent of Euro-American settlement about 150 years ago. Forced to compromise its interests and rights over the years, the Tribe always sought to maintain its integrity and dignity. Subsisting on shellfish from the beaches and salmon from Sequalitchew Creek. Captain George Vancouver mapped the area in 1792, and in 1833, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company established a fur trading post at Fort Nisqually as a halfway point between Ft. Vancouver and Ft. Langley. The fort was relocated upstream in 1843. It was relocated to expand on the fort to house more workers and to have better access to fresh water. Charles Wilkes of the United States Exploring Expedition held the first American Independence Day celebration west of the Mississippi River in the present-day DuPont area on July 5, 1841.

The first school in the area was the Nisqually Methodist Mission school, which operated from 1840 through 1842. Chloe A. Clark was appointed teacher at the school. The first public school was established in 1852. By 1869, the Hudson Bay Company had to sell the land to the U.S. government for $650,000.
The Oregon Treaty of 1846 gave the land of the Oregon Territory to the U.S. but still allowed the HBC to continue operating in the area. American farmers in the area resented this decision and pushed out the company by establishing their own market place and squatting on company land. By 1865, there were about 150 illegal squatters on company property who would harass the livestock of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. A few of the farmers urged Congress to remove the fort as well as the Puget Sound Agricultural Company from the Pacific Northwest. These conditions made it hard to continue operations in the region so the fort was closed.

The land was up for grabs once Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company left and many farmers bought the land. In 1906, the DuPont chemical company purchased a area from the farmers for construction of an explosives plant, as the company was in the midst of expanding into the west. The plant was built on the initial 1833 Ft. Nisqually site and was completed in 1909. During its nearly 70-year history, the plant produced dynamite for the U.S. military as well as for the construction of various civilian projects including the Grand Coulee Dam, the Alcan Highway, and the Panama Canal.
A company town was set up about a mile east of the explosives manufacturing facility. By 1909, the village had two houses for the plant managers and 58 houses for the workers, which increased to over 100 houses by the end of 1917. The village was re-designated as the town of DuPont on March 26, 1912, but it was not officially incorporated as a town until 1951, when the company started selling the houses to the employees. The original company town, roughly bounded by Santa Cruz St, Penniman St, Brandywine Ave, and DuPont Ave, was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the DuPont Village Historic District in 1987.

The dynamite plant was shut down in 1975 and the land was subsequently purchased by the Weyerhaeuser company for $12 million. The initial plan was to use the of land to construct a lumber export plant, but the company eventually decided to further develop the town under a New Urbanism model. DuPont, Weyerhaeuser, and the state Department of Ecology began decontamination of the original explosives plant site in 1991, with a golf course being built on the former location of the plant. In recent years, DuPont has undergone a transformation with the realization of the modern planned community of &quot;Northwest Landing&quot;. The city is expected to have a built-out population of more than 12,000.

In 1975, the midden for the Sequalitchew Archeological site was added to the National Register of Historic Places, it being the oldest known midden in Washington.

===Present day===

DuPont remains a growing community. The elementary school in DuPont, Chloe Clark Elementary (which hosted kindergarten through fifth grade), reached capacity in the 2007–2008 school year. As a result, starting from the following school year, Steilacoom Historical School District realigned all three elementary schools. Chloe Clark Elementary and Cherrydale Primary in Steilacoom now only have students from grades K-3. Saltar&#x27;s Point Elementary in Steilacoom now serves 4th and 5th grades. Pioneer Middle School relocated from Steilacoom to DuPont in August 2008. The new school received the LEED award for its &quot;Green&quot; Design elements.

DuPont is divided into several subdivisions, each with its own design style and/or building contractors. Northwest Landing is the most visible due to a sign along the freeway drawing attention to it. Several businesses have opened in the downtown area, but development has slowed in recent years. Hoffman Hill is the largest in area, and houses about 60% of the total population. The Historic Village, a residential area which is on the registry of historic places, is the only part of DuPont that is not a modern planned community. Bell Hill is considered the most expensive area of the city. DuPont features trails and green belts throughout, and is about 95% built-out according to the master plan.

On December 18, 2017, an Amtrak train derailed near DuPont, killing three people and injuring more than 100 others.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Sequalitchew Creek trail and beach===
Within the city limits of DuPont, next to the city hall, lies the Sequalitchew Creek trail which can be accessed by the old narrow gauge railway roadbed which ran from the old Powderworks plant to Puget Sound. The trail leads to Sequalitchew Beach. The creek corridor hosts hundreds of species, including bald eagles, hawks, McKay&#x27;s bunting, song birds, herons, ducks, owls, frogs, salamanders, snakes, beaver, raccoons, coyotes, deer, and rabbits. The waters off Sequalitchew Beach are inhabited by harbor seals, marbled murrelet and gray whales.

===Other trails and wildlife areas===
DuPont&#x27;s other trails and its parks offer similar access to wildlife and exceptional opportunities for outdoor activity. The trail and greenbelt system provides a wide cross-section of DuPont&#x27;s geographic and natural environments, while maintaining an urban feel. Full maps can be obtained from the visitor center, city hall, and the history museum.

<text>Eatonville is a town in Pierce County, Washington, United States. It is south of Tacoma. The population was 2,845 at the 2020 census. The town motto is &quot;Better Together.&quot;

==History==
For centuries, Nisqually people roamed the rivers and streams of the Eatonville area. Leschi, one of the main leaders of Nisqually was born in this area in 1808.

In 1889, Indian Henry was one of the Nisqually who guided the town&#x27;s Euro-American founder, Thomas C. Van Eaton, from Mashell Prairie to the present site of Eatonville. Legend has it that upon arrival Henry declared, &quot;This is a good place. Not much snow.&quot;

Area white settlers and the accompanying Nisqually were in need of goods, which &quot;T.C.&quot; provided at his trading post. Supplies were carried by his stage from Spanaway over a rough trail through dense forest. In 1891, the settlers built the town&#x27;s first school, which is still in use.

For years Eatonville was a waypoint for visitors to Mount Rainier. In 1902, the Tacoma Eastern Railroad arrived, providing freight and passenger service and a vital link to Tacoma. Soon after the railroad&#x27;s arrival, several small mills sprang up in the vicinity. In the 1970s, the Wildlife park of Northwest Trek was opened and it remains one of the most popular tourist attractions in the area, other than Mount Rainier itself.

Eatonville was officially incorporated on October 28, 1909, after the Eatonville Lumber Company brought in more people to work in its mill. The mill closed in 1954.

On April 27, 2014, an EF0 tornado briefly touched down and caused some minor damage near Eatonville.

<doc id="138138" wikidata="Q1508050" url="?curid=138138" title="Edgewood, Washington">
<text>Edgewood is a city in Pierce County, Washington, United States. The population was 12,327 at the 2020 census. Neighboring towns include Fife to the west, Milton to the northwest, Federal Way to the north, Sumner to the east, and Puyallup to the south.

==History==
The history of Edgewood can be traced to the Puyallup Indian tribe that lived along the Puyallup River. Dr. William Tolmie, a Scotsman working for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, passed through Edgewood in 1833 soon after becoming Chief Trader at Fort Nisqually. Tolmie had arrived at Fort Vancouver by ship from Britain in May 1833. Trappers with Native American wives had moved to the area in the 1830s and settlers in the 1850s.

Washington&#x27;s first telegraph line paralleled Military Road that ran through the heart of Edgewood. Approximately 420 Americans (apart from Indians) resided in what is now Pierce County in 1858. By 1862, 681 non-Native Americans were reported to be residents of Pierce County. Evidence indicates that the first building on the North Hill (Surprise Lake) was a one-room log building formed as School District 27 in 1891. One of the first known residents in Edgewood was Peter Nyholm in 1895.

The first official run of the interurban line from Tacoma to Seattle, by the way of the valley, was in October 1902. The State Spiritualists, who had six churches in Western Washington, had a summer camp at Edgewood that was purchased in 1903. Construction of a campground hotel began in 1927, and before completion a fire destroyed it in 1948.

Edgewood was officially incorporated on February 28, 1996.

On April 28, 2010, Edgewood was the site of the murder of James Sanders.

==Geography==
The Edgewood and Milton areas are also known informally as North Hill. This contrasts with the South Hill area on the opposite side of the Puyallup River valley.

<text>Elbe () is a census-designated place (CDP) in Pierce County, Washington, United States. The population was 39 at the 2020 census.

==Etymology==
Known as Brown&#x27;s Junction after the Tacoma &amp; Eastern Railway was built in the region, there are similar but competing theories on the change of the community&#x27;s name to Elbe. When a post office was requested, a shorter name was demanded and a meeting of settlers decided to honor the pioneer settler Henry C. Lutkens who had come from the valley of the Elbe in Germany. Another hypothesis suggests the settlers of the area, whom hailed as a group from the Elbe Valley, derived the moniker based on the similarities of the Elbe and the Nisqually Rivers.

==History==

In 1888 the first settlers came to the forests on the Nisqually River. Some of them were the German emigrants Karl Lütkens and Adam Sachs. Karl Lütkens, who was only 19 at the time, was so enthusiastic about his new home that he persuaded his parents Heinrich and Christina Lütkens to come to America as well. These left their previous home in Todendorf in the district Stormarn in Schleswig-Holstein and arrived in America in 1891. The first settlers in this area also included Ferdinand Selle, Christian Fritz, Louis Schuffenhauer, Christian Kruse, Max Ogans, Hans Bartels, Fred Duke, W. Lawrence, Levi Engel, Vincent Rotter, R. Schmidt, Frank Salzer, Gus Stoll and Christian Weilandt. The small town grew, and on June 4, 1892, a post office was already established here.

The economic development of the place in the following years was good. Nearby Mount Rainier was the destination of many tourists who took a break on their way to Elbe. In 1894 Heinrich Lütkens and his son Karl built a tourist hotel with 48 rooms. Ferdinand Selle had previously built a hotel, but it burned down after a short time. At that time, the village blacksmith Levi Engel was temporarily the editor of a newspaper called &quot;Elbe Union&quot;. With his plate camera, Engel accompanied village life for many years. In 1894 a town hall was also built, in which various events, including dance events, took place.

In 1895 Heinrich Lütkens and his family had a special reunion. From Hamfelde in the district Herzogtum Lauenburg in Schleswig-Holstein was Carl Böttcher, the brother-in-law of Lütkens, emigrated with his family and settled in a neighboring town of Elbe.

The town began to experience an increase in tourism after Elbe was connected to the Tacoma Eastern Railroad rail network in 1904 and the Road to Paradise, which became Washington State Route 706, was completed in 1911. Another large hotel and several restaurants were built. The local co-founder Adam Sachs opened a department store during this time. Two years later, the villagers built a church. The building material and the plot of land were donated by Heinrich Lütkens. Until the opening of the church, the residents of Elbe had celebrated their services in private houses or in the town hall. In 1909 Elbe already had 250 inhabitants and in the course of the 20th century the population rose to 437.

The community is among 8 locations that are part of an EV installation project on the White Pass Scenic Byway. The program will stretch from the White Pass Ski Area to Chehalis and is run in partnership with Lewis County PUD, Twin Transit, state government agencies, and local community efforts. The venture began in 2023 from two grants totaling over $1.8 million.

<text>Fife is a city in Pierce County, Washington, United States and a suburb of Tacoma. The population was 10,999 at the 2020 census. Fife is contained within the Puyallup Indian Reservation and bisected by Interstate 5. It is east of Tacoma and the Port of Tacoma.

==History==
The lower Puyallup basin is the ancestral home of the Puyallup people, who were relocated after the signing of the Medicine Creek Treaty in 1854. The treaty ceded Puyallup lands and created the Puyallup Indian Reservation, which was expanded to include modern-day Fife. The land on which the city sits was lost after the signing of the General Allotment Act in 1887 and other land transfers that were later resolved in a 1990 claims settlement.

The first white settlers arrived in the late 1890s. Fife may have been named for William J. Fife, a prominent Tacoma lawyer, Yukon prospector, once head of the Washington National Guard, and a lieutenant colonel in the field during the Philippine–American War. There is also a historic county of Scotland and former Pictish kingdom called Fife, which could also be a source of the city&#x27;s name.

In 1940, Fife was described as &quot;at a valley crossroads in the midst of a thickly settled berry growing and truck-gardening district is represented by a string of markets, taverns, shops, and a large, balloon-roofed dance hall along the highway.&quot; The 1940 population was 135. It had a large Japanese American population until Executive Order 9066 forced residents into internment camps.

Fife was officially incorporated on February 11, 1957, with approximately 850 residents. The city had been created to prevent the annexation of its business district by Tacoma and to give the area a distinct identity. Joe Vraves was elected as Fife&#x27;s first mayor and served in that position until becoming a Pierce County councilmember in 1981. The Pacific Highway (U.S. Route 99) was replaced by Interstate 5 (I-5), which opened through Fife on October 10, 1962. The freeway&#x27;s opening led to new commercial development in Fife, including those catering towards motorists, that brought high sales tax revenue to the city.

Fife, an eastern suburb of Tacoma, consists primarily of businesses such as car dealerships, warehousing and industrial facilities, motels, drive through smoke shops, quick-dining restaurants as well as a Native American casino and various other highway-side businesses. Its proximity to the Port of Tacoma, Interstate 5, and Highway 167 has contributed to the large number of freight forwarding companies. Fife&#x27;s tax base is made up of sales tax, utility tax, and property tax. Fife Heights, located on a hill beyond the incorporated bounds of the city, is a primarily residential area. Milton is located immediately to the east and Edgewood to the southeast.

<text>Fort Lewis is a United States Army base located south-southwest of Tacoma, Washington. Fort Lewis was merged with McChord Air Force Base on February 1, 2010, to form Joint Base Lewis–McChord.

Fort Lewis, named after Meriwether Lewis of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, was one of the largest and most modern military reservations in the United States, consisting of of prairie land cut from the glacier-flattened Nisqually Plain. It is the premier military installation in the northwest and the most requested duty station in the Army.

Joint Base Lewis-McChord (Fort Lewis) is a major Army installation, with much of the 2nd Infantry Division in residence, along with Headquarters, the 7th Infantry Division, 593rd Expeditionary Sustainment Command, and the 1st Special Forces Group. However, the Headquarters of the 7th Infantry Division is primarily a garrison management body. Fort Lewis&#x27;s geographic location provides rapid access to the deep-water ports of Tacoma, Olympia, and Seattle for deploying equipment. Units can be deployed from McChord Field, and individuals and small groups can also use the nearby Sea-Tac Airport. The strategic location of the base provides Air Force units with the ability to conduct combat and humanitarian airlifts with the C-17 Globemaster III.

==Joint Base Garrison==
The Joint Base Garrison operates the installation on behalf of the warfighting units, families, and extended military community who depend on JBLM for support. The mission of the unit is to provide support to mission commanders and the joint base community, to serve as an enabler to the soldiers as they train and project America&#x27;s combat power, and to make JBLM the station of choice for American soldiers and their families.

With an Army joint base commander and an Air Force deputy joint base commander, the garrison supports the installation through directorates and agencies that provide a full range of city services and quality-of-life functions, everything from facility maintenance, recreation, and family programs to training support and emergency services.

The major organizations that make up the bulk of the Joint Base Garrison include:
* Directorates of Public Works: Logistics
* Family and Morale, Welfare, and Recreation
* Human Resources; Emergency Services
* Plans and Training Security and Plans

Additional staff offices that support the installation mission include the Joint Base Public Affairs Office, the Religious Support Office, the Resource Management Office, the Equal Employment Opportunity Office, the Installation Safety Office, and the Plans, Analysis, and Integration Office. Other partners who work closely with the Joint Base Garrison include the Civilian Personnel Advisory Center, the Mission and Installation Contracting Command, and the Joint Personal Property Shipping Office.

Three military units support the Joint Base Garrison.
* 627th Air Base Group
: Provides command and control and administrative oversight to the Airmen who perform installation support duties on behalf of the garrison.
* Headquarters and Headquarters Company, Joint Base Garrison
: Provides administrative oversight to the Army personnel in the garrison and supports newly arrived soldiers during their in-processing period.

JBLM Soldiers receive medical care through on-base Madigan Healthcare System facilities such as the Madigan Army Medical Center, the Okubo Clinic, and the Nisqually Clinic. JBLM Airmen receive medical care at the McChord Clinic as well as the Madigan Army Medical Center.

===JBLM Main and JBLM North===
JBLM has more than 25,000 soldiers and civilian workers. The post supports over 120,000 military retirees and more than 29,000 family members living both on and off-post. Fort Lewis proper contains , and the Yakima Training Center covers .

JBLM Main &amp; North have abundant, high-quality, close-in training areas, including 115 live fire ranges. Additional training space is available at the Yakima Training Center in eastern Washington, including maneuver areas and additional live fire ranges.

In 2009, the former Fort Lewis Regional Correction Facility was remodeled and renamed the Northwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility (NWJRCF). The facility houses minimum- and medium-security prisoners from all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces.

Also adjacent to the post is Camp Murray (Washington National Guard).

==History==


Fort Lewis was originally established in 1917 with the passage of a Pierce County bond measure to purchase of land to donate to the federal government for permanent use as a military installation. A portion of the initial land was taken from the Nisqually tribe&#x27;s reservation. (The Nisqually people would later petition unsuccessfully for the return of this land.) In 1927, Pierce County passed another bond measure to establish a military airfield just north of Fort Lewis. The airfield, called Tacoma Field, opened in 1930 and was renamed McChord Field in 1940. McChord Field separated from Fort Lewis when the U.S. Air Force was created in 1947 and was subsequently renamed McChord Air Force Base. The two bases operated independently of one another for more than 60 years before merging in 2010.

Fort Lewis began as Camp Lewis in 1917, when the citizens of Pierce County voted by an eight-to-one margin to bond themselves for to buy of land. They donated the land to the federal government for military use. The only stipulation was that the tract be used as a permanent army post. Captain David L. Stone and his staff arrived at the camp site on May 26, 1917, and a few days later the initial construction began. As work on the camp was pushing forward, the War Department named it &quot;Camp Lewis&quot; after Meriwether Lewis of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The entire camp was ready for occupancy a month ahead of schedule. In 90 days, Stone had supervised the construction of a &quot;city&quot; of 757 buildings and 422 other structures, all lighted and heated for 60,000 men. The first recruits moved into their new barracks on September 5, 1917, exactly two months after the post building plan had been handed to the contractors.

When they implemented the auction of the new cantonment, workmen subscribed for $4,000 to build the main gate, which is still standing. The arch was built of fieldstone and squared logs, resembling the old blockhouses that stood in the northwest as forts. Some 60,000 men, including the 13th and 91st Divisions, moved into the hastily constructed cantonment to train for World War I. Recruited largely from the northwest, the 91st was considered &quot;Washington&#x27;s Own.&quot; In 1917, Pierce County, through the process of condemnation proceedings (eminent domain), took of the Nisqually Indian Reservation (14 km2) for the Fort Lewis Military Reserve.

The following two years saw tremendous activity at Camp Lewis as men mobilized and trained for war service. With the conclusion of the war, activities at Lewis ground to a standstill. Camp Lewis passed from the hands of Pierce County and became the property of the federal government when the deed for 62,432 acres (253 km2) was recorded in the county auditor&#x27;s office in Tacoma.

When World War I ended in 1918, the Nisqually people petitioned for their land to be returned to them, but the request was denied by the Secretary of War, Newton Baker.

Brigadier General David L. Stone, who had supervised the original construction of Fort Lewis as a captain, returned as its commanding general in 1936, serving until 1937. The project of constructing an army airfield, which later became McChord Air Force Base, directly north of the Fort Lewis installation, received approval as a WPA project in January 1938, and $61,730 was allocated for construction. The allocation provided for clearing, grading, and leveling a runway long by wide.

From 1942 to 1943, 42 Japanese, German, and Italian Americans were held at Fort Lewis as part of the government&#x27;s &quot;enemy alien&quot; internment program during World War II. The Japanese and Italian internees were transferred to Fort Missoula and the Germans to Fort Lincoln, and the temporary detention facility closed on March 30, 1943. Italian prisoners of war, organized into units, were trained as quartermaster units at Fort Lewis since, after Italy surrendered to the Allies and declared war on Germany, they were not strictly held to the work requirements that prohibited prisoners of war from working on items directly headed for the war or in the war effort.

At the conclusion of World War II, the northwest staging area of Fort Lewis became a separation center and discharged its first soldiers in October 1945. Sometime in the early 1960s, Interstate 5 was built through the fort, separating the northwest corner of the fort and creating &quot;Northfort&quot;. With the departure of the 4th Infantry Division (United States) for Vietnam in 1966, Fort Lewis once again became a personnel transfer and training center. David H. Hackworth described his service commanding a training battalion at the Fort during the Vietnam War in his memoir &quot;About Face&quot;. In 1972, the 9th Infantry Division (United States) was reactivated and trained there until its deactivation in 1991.

The Fort Lewis Military Museum was established in 1972 to preserve and document the post&#x27;s history.

The base received much media attention in the wake of the Kandahar massacre, committed by a Fort Lewis soldier in March 2012.

The 1st Joint Mobilization Brigade disbanded in late May 2014. It previously controlled and provided host unit support for mobilizing, deploying, and demobilizing reserve component units from all the U.S. military services. The unit began as the 2122st Garrison Support Unit (Army Reserve), overseeing the mobilization of about 27,000 Soldiers. The group of fewer than a dozen personnel mobilized about 15,000 soldiers within three weeks at the start of the War in Afghanistan. The unit was redesignated the 654th Area Support Group (Forward) in May 2004 and the 1st JMB in March 2007. Training and mobilization validation moved to individual units (instead of the 1st JMB) in 2011.

===Major units===
The United States Army&#x27;s I Corps commands most Army units at Joint Base Lewis-McChord and conducts planning and liaison with other assigned active and Reserve component units in the continental United States. It is one of the active Army&#x27;s contingency corps. I Corps stays prepared to deploy on short notice worldwide to command up to five divisions or a joint task force.

In 1981, the I Corps was reactivated at Fort Lewis. On October 12, 1999, General Eric K. Shinseki, Chief of Staff of the Army, announced I Corps would lead the acceleration of Army transformation, training, and the initial creation of the first two Stryker Brigade Combat Teams at Fort Lewis. Since September 11, 2001, I Corps and Fort Lewis assets have been active in providing support for Global War on Terrorism operations, including Operation Noble Eagle (Homeland Defense), Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan), and the Iraq War.

On February 5, 2004, Task Force Olympia was activated as a sub-element of I Corps headquarters with the mission to command forward-deployed units in Iraq. This marked the first time that I Corps had forward soldiers in combat since the end of the Korean War. Task Force Olympia included units from all three components of the Army (Active, Reserve, and National Guard) as well as Marine and Australian officers. Task Force Olympia&#x27;s subordinate units included the 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division, which deployed for Iraq on November 8, 2003, and returned to Fort Lewis after one year of combat duty, and the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division, which departed Fort Lewis on September 15, 2004, for one year, and returned in September 2005. On June 1, 2006, the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division, changed its name and became the 2d Cavalry Regiment, Stryker Brigade Combat Team, with its home station in Germany. A new unit then unveiled the colors of its new designation on June 1, 2006: the 4th Brigade, 2d Infantry Division.

Subordinate units assigned to Fort Lewis are:
*7th Infantry Division
** 1st Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division
** 2nd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division

===JBLM Main and JBLM North===
JBLM has more than 25,000 soldiers and civilian workers. The post supports over 120,000 military retirees and more than 29,000 family members living both on and off-post. Fort Lewis proper contains 86,000 acres (350 km2), the Yakima Training Center covers 324,000 acres (1,310 km2).

JBLM Main &amp; North have abundant, high-quality, close-in training areas, including 115 live fire ranges. Additional training space is available at the Yakima Training Center in eastern Washington, including maneuver areas and additional live fire ranges.

In 2009, the former Fort Lewis Regional Correction Facility was remodeled and renamed the Northwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility (NWJRCF). The facility houses minimum- and medium-security prisoners from all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces.

During the summer months (June, July, and August), JBLM North hosts the Leader Development and Assessment Course, a capstone program for the U.S. Army&#x27;s ROTC program.

Also adjacent to the post is Camp Murray (Washington National Guard).

===Yakima Training Center===

The Yakima Training Center is a major sub-installation of JBLM and provides a full range of training lands and ranges to active and reserve component units. Encompassing more than , YTC is a world-class facility.

The training center is in the high desert and is covered with sagebrush, volcanic formations, dry gulches, and large rock outcroppings. YTC has vast flat valleys separated by intervening ridges that are suited to large-scale mechanized or motorized forces. Much of the steeper terrain resembles areas of Afghanistan. Twenty-five ranges, including the state-of-the-art Multi-Purpose Range Complex and Shoot House, are available for individual or collective training.

Prior to 1941, the area consisted of ranches and a few scattered silica mines. Just before World War II, the Army&#x27;s need for a large training and maneuver area became apparent, and the Army negotiated with landowners to lease for the Yakima Anti-Aircraft Artillery Range. Military organizations in the Pacific Northwest used the center for range firing and small unit tests. The first range was constructed in 1942 on Umtanum Ridge, northeast of the present cantonment area.

In 1947, approximately were cleared of unexploded ammunition and returned to the original owners. During 1949 and 1950, the state of Washington used the center for summer training of its National Guard units, and regular Army troops were permanently assigned to the center. At the start of the Korean War, the Army decided to expand the Yakima Training Center. In 1951, the Installation was enlarged to , and construction of the current cantonment area began.

In 1986, a further expansion was initiated, and in 1992, the Army acquired additional land to enlarge YTC to . The Multi-Purpose Range Complex opened in 1989, and the Shoot House and Urban Assault Course opened in 2005. YTC has an AAFES shopette, a recreation center, and a gymnasium available to soldiers and their families. The Firing Point community club, with cafeteria, opened in February 2009.

=== Gray Army Airfield ===
Gray Army Airfield is a military airport located within Fort Lewis. The field is named in honor of Captain Lawrence C. Gray, who died during a free balloon flight at the field on November 4, 1927. The field is now used by Army helicopters.

Helicopters based at the airfield assisted with medical evacuations at Mount Rainier National Park on numerous occasions in the 1970s. Army helicopters were also used to insert search-and-rescue [SAR] teams into inaccessible areas on the east, north, and west sides of the mountain, lowering rangers to the ground by a cable device known as a &quot;jungle penetrator&quot;. Helicopters began assisting with high-altitude (above 10,000 feet) SAR operations in the 1980s. Helicopters were also used for &quot;short haul&quot; rescue operations, in which a ranger and litter were carried in a sling below the helicopter to the scene of the accident.

During World War II, the Air Transport Command&#x27;s 4131st Army Air Force Base Unit used GAAF as the CONUS hub for the Alaskan West Coast Wing, ferrying supplies, equipment, and aircraft to the Eleventh Air Force at Elmendorf Field, near Anchorage. Also used by Air Technical Service Command as an aircraft maintenance and supply depot, primarily to service aircraft being sent to Alaska. The Army Air Force closed its facilities in 1947.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 15.9 square miles (41.2 km2), of which 15.3 square miles (39.6 km2) are land and 0.6 square miles (1.6 km2) are water. The total area is 3.78% water. The military base is, as previously stated, much larger than the CDP defined by the Census Bureau.

Fort Lewis&#x27; terrain is primarily a mixture of dense conifer woods and open Puget prairie-garry oak woodlands. Invasive Scotch Broom has taken over many areas. The landscape is very rocky from glacial meltwater deposits. Poison oak is found in the training areas. Canada Thistle grows thickly in some areas. All trees are to be left standing; post policy prohibits cutting or trimming them.

The temperatures during summer vary from the mid-40s at night to the mid-70s during the day, occasionally peaking over . Although July and August are the driest months.

Fort Lewis, due to its size and reserved land, serves as an important habitat for amphibian development and study.

==Demographics==
The census-designated place (CDP) Fort Lewis is located within the installation&#x27;s area. As of the 2000 census, the CDP, which includes the most densely populated part of the base, had a total population of 19,089.

As of the census of 2000, there were 19,089 people, 3,476 households, and 3,399 families residing on the base. The population density was 1,248.5 people per square mile (482.0/km2).

<text>Fox Island is an island and census-designated place (CDP) in Pierce County, Washington, United States, in Puget Sound. It is located approximately 5 miles (8 km) from Gig Harbor. The island was named Fox by Charles Wilkes during the United States Exploring Expedition, to honor J.L. Fox, an assistant surgeon on the expedition. The population was 3,921 at the 2020 census, up from 3,633 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the census-designated place has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (18.31%) is water.

Fox Island is separated from the mainland by Hale Passage to the north. The Fox Island Bridge crosses that passage to connect the road network to the mainland at Artondale. A small inhabited island named Tanglewood lies just off Fox Island along the Hale Passage; it was included as part of the Fox Island CDP for the 2010 Census. To the southwest, Carr Inlet separates Fox Island from McNeil Island.

==History==
The island was part of the territory of the Steilacoom people, a Coast Salish tribe.

In 1792, during the Vancouver Expedition, Peter Puget led an exploration party through southern Puget Sound. After an encounter with local Native tribes ended with Puget ordering a musket fired as warning, the exploration party retreated to Fox Island, where they made camp for the night.

In 1856, during the Puget Sound War, most of the Puyallup and &quot;non-hostile&quot; Nisqually Indians, totaling about 500 people, were removed from their homelands and displaced to Fox Island. John Swan was assigned to supervise the internment camp and distribute food rations provided by the government (territorial government). On January 5, 1856, Chief Leschi and other &quot;hostile&quot; Indians arrived at Fox Island with a flotilla of canoes. Trusting Swan, they had come to talk about the war and how to resolve it. While the hostile Indians were on Fox Island, Captain Maurice Maloney took the steamship &quot;Beaver&quot; to the island, hoping to rescue Swan, but forgot to bring landing craft and was unable to send men ashore. Before Maloney could figure out what to do, Swan came to the shore and paddled a canoe to the &quot;Beaver&quot;. He told Maloney that there had been no violence, urged him to not come ashore, and said he had promised to return to the island, which he did. Maloney returned to Steilacoom and, along with other military officers, took another steamship, the &quot;USS Active&quot; from Steilacoom to Seattle to get a howitzer (which they failed to acquire), then back to Fox Island, hoping to capture Chief Leschi. But by the time the &quot;Active&quot; returned, more than 30 hours after Leschi had arrived on Fox Island, the hostile Indians had left.

By August 1856 the war was essentially over. Governor Isaac Stevens went to the Indian encampment on Fox Island to renegotiate the 1854 Treaty of Medicine Creek, which had been a major factor in the outbreak of war. Stevens agreed to new, larger reservations for both the Puyallup and Nisqually tribes.

The first non-Indians settled on Fox island in 1856, just after the war ended. One of the first real estate transactions was in 1881 when 56.5 acres (22.6 hectares) were sold for $118. By 1908 there were about 60 homes scattered across the island.

The most important change to this community happened in 1954 when the Fox Island Bridge was completed, connecting Fox Island to the mainland. This allowed easy access to businesses, schools, and medical facilities outside the island. During the construction a historical Indian canoe was found preserved in the mud, which can be visited in the Fox Island history museum. In 1956 the population of the island was 120, by 2000 it had grown to more than 2,800.

Cartoonist Gary Larson visited Fox Island frequently as a child. He has called Fox Island a &quot;wondrous place&quot; and credits the island&#x27;s swamps and wildlife with inspiring his interest in nature.

On April 29, 1988, at 6 PM local time, a nuclear-powered US Navy submarine, the USS Sam Houston (SSBN-609), ran aground on Fox Island while operating in nearby Carr Inlet. The ship remained aground for approximately 10 hours until high tide returned and tugboats were brought in to unstick the ship. No damage was done to the island, and the ship entered a drydock at the Bangor Naval Submarine Base for minor repairs to its hull.

In recent years, Fox Island has become a wealthy exurb of Tacoma, largely because of the amount of waterfront property on the island and because of the island&#x27;s location between the Olympic Mountains and Mount Rainier; a large number of the island&#x27;s residential properties have views. Based on per capita income, one of the more reliable measures of affluence, Fox Island ranks 29th of the 522 ranked areas in the state of Washington.

<text>Gig Harbor () is the name of both a bay on Puget Sound and a city on its shore in Pierce County, Washington. The population was 12,029 at the 2020 census.

Gig Harbor bills itself as &quot;the Maritime City&quot; and maintains a strong connection to its maritime heritage. Due to its close access to several state and city parks, and historic waterfront that includes boutiques and fine dining, it has become a popular tourist destination. Gig Harbor is located along State Route 16, about from its origin at Interstate 5, over the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.

==History==
The S&#x27;Homamish or Homamish (), an ancestral band of the modern-day Puyallup people, have inhabited Gig Harbor, known in Lushootseed as , meaning &quot;place where game exists&quot; for millennia. There was a Puyallup settlement at the mouth of the harbor that included six houses, and a large longhouse. This village existed until the late 19th century, with the longhouse finally being torn down by settlers in 1915. The band was later relocated to the Puyallup Indian Reservation.

During a heavy storm in 1840, Captain Charles Wilkes brought the captain&#x27;s gig (small boat) into the harbor for protection. Later, with the publication of Wilkes&#x27; 1841 map of the Oregon Territory, the sheltered bay was named in English as Gig Harbor by George Sinclair for his boat.

In 1867, fisherman Samuel Jerisich came to the Gig Harbor area, along with many other immigrants from Sweden, Norway, and Croatia. The town was platted in 1888 by Alfred M. Burnham, the owner of a local general store and native of Albert Lea, Minnesota, where he advertised opportunities in Gig Harbor.

Commercial fishing, boat building, and logging dominated the economy of the Gig Harbor area, which developed two business districts in the 1920s on opposite sides of the harbor. Transportation between Gig Harbor and Tacoma was primarily handled by the &quot;Mosquito fleet&quot;, a network of mostly-passenger steamships that traversed various points on Puget Sound. Automobiles were required to drive through Olympia to reach Tacoma; the Washington Navigation Company later launched a Point Defiance–Gig Harbor ferry service in 1927 that could carry 80 vehicles. The first Tacoma Narrows Bridge was completed in July 1940 to replace the ferry crossing, but collapsed a few months later. The ferry service was restored until the modern-day westbound bridge was completed in 1950. A third bridge opened in 2007 to carry eastbound traffic on the expanded State Route 16 freeway.

Gig Harbor was officially incorporated as a town on July 12, 1946, after a previous attempt in September 1945 was rejected by 13 votes. The town had 803 residents in 1950, but soon grew due to the ease of access afforded by the replacement bridge that turned Gig Harbor into a bedroom community for Tacoma workers. Gig Harbor was re-incorporated as a city in 1981. By the 1980s and 1990s, substantial residential and retail development had pushed the city&#x27;s boundaries west to State Route 16, which had been upgraded to a partial freeway. The downtown area shifted towards tourism to compensate for lost business and attract new development. The city&#x27;s historic boat building industry declined, but its facilities remain preserved as historic landmarks. A fleet of commercial fishing boats is based in Gig Harbor and make annual trips to Alaska for the summer season to harvest salmon.

===Skansie shipyard===
In 1905, the Skansie brothers were the first in the area to build a gasoline-powered fishing boat. They did so at first by refitting boats with a gasoline-powered engine. Usually the motors were quite small, between 6 and 8 horsepower; the Skansie brothers originally used a 7-horsepower engine. Although these were powerboats, neither masts nor a turntable to hoist in the nets were used. This work was all done by hand. However, with the introduction of a motor, the boats were not able to go as far as Alaska. Skansie shipyards built fishing vessels from the late 1910s to the early 1950s.

<text>Lakewood is a city in Pierce County, Washington, United States. The population was 63,612 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Lakewood was officially incorporated as a city on February 28, 1996, on the same day as Edgewood. It immediately became the second largest city in Pierce County and among the largest in the state. Three previous attempts to incorporate as a city had been rejected by voters in 1971, 1990, and 1994 before it was approved by a 20-point margin on March 14, 1995, within a smaller area. Historical names include Tacoma/Lakewood Center and Lakes District (this name was used by the U.S. Census in the 1970 and 1980 Census). Lakewood is home to the Clover Park School District, the Lakewood Water District, Fort Steilacoom Park and Western State Hospital, a regional state psychiatric hospital. Thornewood Castle was built in the vicinity of Tacoma in the area that is now Lakewood.

A small community near Arlington in Snohomish County with the name Lakewood had used the name for their post office since 1909, which led to confusion between the two areas. The United States Postal Service suggested that the new city be renamed due to frequent mixups in mail delivery that required the two post offices to forward deliveries with a one-day delay. The Snohomish County post office was renamed to North Lakewood in 1998 by the Postal Service due to the other community&#x27;s unincorporated status.

In 1997, the Seafirst Bank robbery happened in Lakewood.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

There are several lakes within the city limits; the largest in area are American Lake, Lake Steilacoom, Gravelly Lake, Lake Louise, and Waughop Lake. The Waughop Lake is incorporated into the aforementioned Fort Steilacoom Park. A number of small creeks flow through Lakewood, some of which drain into nearby Puget Sound. The largest of these, Chambers Creek, flows from Lake Steilacoom to Chambers Bay between nearby University Place and Steilacoom.

The western terminus of State Route 512 is in Lakewood, at its intersection with Interstate 5. The proposed State Route 704 would be the only other state highway entering the city.

All four officers had served with the department since its inception and died at the scene; two baristas and several customers in the shop were not injured. Clemmons was shot and killed by a Seattle police officer two days later. The shooting is believed to be the most deadly attack on law enforcement in the state of Washington, and among the deadliest attacks on law enforcement in the United States.

==Economy==
Lakewood&#x27;s economy is highly dependent upon on the nearby Joint Base Lewis-McChord. It also boasts one of the few true International Districts in the South Sound along South Tacoma Way and Pacific Highway, with Korean, Vietnamese, Chinese, Latino and other influences (the population of Lakewood&#x27;s Tillicum neighborhood is nearly half non-English speaking).

==Media==
Lakewood&#x27;s news is primarily covered by &quot;The News Tribune&quot; (Tacoma), and sometimes by the media in Seattle. Earlier weekly newspapers for the community were the &quot;Lakewood Log&quot; (circa 1930s), &quot;Suburban Times&quot; (1960s–1982), &quot;Lakewood Press&quot; (1980s), and &quot;Lakewood Journal&quot; (1990s).

KLAY-AM radio provides Lakewood-specific talk radio. KVTI-FM, known as &quot;I-91 FM&quot;, broadcast top 40 music from its Lakewood studio at Clover Park Technical College until 2010, when the college transferred management of the station to Washington State University&#x27;s Northwest Public Radio who discontinued the locally produced programming in favor of a network feed from the University&#x27;s Pullman campus. The Clover Park School District operated KCPQ (thus the call letters) until 1980, when the district sold the station to Kelly Broadcasting.

<text>McChord Field (formerly and still commonly known as McChord Air Force Base) is a United States Air Force base in the northwest United States, in Pierce County, Washington. South of Tacoma, McChord AFB is the home of the 62nd Airlift Wing, Air Mobility Command, the airbase&#x27;s primary mission being worldwide strategic airlift.

The McChord AFB facility was consolidated with the U.S. Army&#x27;s Fort Lewis on 1 February 2010 to become part of the Joint Base Lewis-McChord complex. This initiative was driven by the Base Realignment and Closure Round in 2005 and is designed to combine current infrastructure into one maximizing war fighting capability and efficiency, while saving taxpayer dollars.

== 62nd Airlift Wing ==
The 62nd Airlift Wing (62 AW) is the host unit at McChord AFB. It is assigned to the Eighteenth Air Force and is composed of more than 7,200 active duty military and civilian personnel. It is tasked with supporting worldwide combat and humanitarian airlift contingencies. Aircraft of the 62nd fly around the globe, conducting airdrop training; it also carries out the Antarctic resupply missions.

===Components===
The 62nd Operations Group flies the C-17 Globemaster III transport from McChord Field. It consists of three airlift squadrons and an Operations Support Squadron.
* 4th Airlift Squadron
* 7th Airlift Squadron
* 8th Airlift Squadron

Other wing components are the 62nd Maintenance Group, 62nd Operations Group, 62nd Comptroller Squadron, and 62nd Medical Squadron.

== Tenant units ==
Other major units stationed at McChord Field are:
* 446th Airlift Wing (Air Force Reserve Command)
* Western Air Defense Sector
* 22nd Special Tactics Squadron
* 262nd Cyberspace Operations Squadron
* 361st Recruiting Squadron
* 373d Training Squadron

===McChord Air Museum===
The McChord Air Museum, operated by the McChord Air Museum Foundation, exhibits 17 aircraft as well as artifacts related to the history of the airbase.

==History==

=== Origins ===

In 1917, the citizens of Pierce County, Washington approved a bond measure for to buy of land to be donated to the Federal Government for use as a military reservation. This land became Camp Lewis (and later Fort Lewis). Ten years later, in 1927, another bond measure was passed to establish an airfield just north of the military reservation. The airfield, named Tacoma Field, officially opened 14 March 1930.

On 28 February 1938 the airfield was officially transferred to the federal government. Three years after the transfer, on 3 July 1940, the airfield was renamed McChord Field, in honor of Colonel William Caldwell McChord, who had been killed in an accident near Richmond, Virginia on 18 August 1937. Col. McChord, (1881–1937), rated as a junior military aviator in 1918, died while trying to force-land his Northrop A-17 near Maidens, Virginia. At the time of his death, he was Chief of the Training and Operations Division in HQ Army Air Corps. Tacoma Field was renamed McChord Field, 17 December 1937. Over the subsequent two decades McChord Field grew to roughly , encompassing the northern tip of the Ft. Lewis. It became independent of Ft. Lewis in 1947 following the creation of the Air Force under provisions of the National Security Act of 1947 and was subsequently named McChord AFB.

===World War II===
In 1940, McChord Field became the headquarters of the GHQ Air Force Northwest Air District, with a mission for the defense of the Pacific Northwest and Upper Great Plains regions of the United States. The 17th Bombardment Group was moved to the new airfield from March Field, California and was equipped with the Douglas B-18 Bolo medium bomber.

Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 6 December 1941, the 17th Bombardment Group flew anti-submarine patrols off the West Coast of the United States with the new North American B-25 Mitchell medium bomber. As the first unit to operate the B-25, the 17th achieved another &quot;first&quot; on 24 December 1941 when one of its Mitchells dropped four bombs on a Japanese submarine near the mouth of the Columbia River. The 17th Bomb Group was reassigned in February 1942 to Columbia Army Air Base in South Carolina, where crews from the group were selected to carry out the Doolittle Raid on Japan in April.

With the departure of the 17th Bomb Group, the mission of McChord Field became supporting the Army Air Forces Training Command&#x27;s mission of training of units, crews, and individuals for bombardment, fighter, and reconnaissance operations. Northwest Air Force was re-designated as the Second Air Force, and became the training organization of B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator heavy bombardment groups.

Nearly all new heavy bomb groups organized after Pearl Harbor were organized and trained at Second Air Force Bases, by II Bomber Command operational training units (OTU) then were deployed to combat commands around the world. McChord trained numerous bombardment squadrons during the war, receiving graduates of AAF Training Command&#x27;s flight and technical schools and forming them into operational squadrons which were then sent on to second and third phase training prior to being deployed to the overseas combat air forces.

Starting in mid-1943 the training of B-17 and B-24 replacement crews began to be phased out, as the Second Air Force began ramping up training of B-29 Superfortress Very Heavy bomb groups, destined for Twentieth Air Force. Under the newly organized XX Bomber Command, B-29 aircraft were received from Boeing&#x27;s manufacturing plants at Seattle and Wichita, Kansas and new combat groups were organized and trained, primarily in Kansas and Nebraska.

McChord also had large maintenance facilities for Air Technical Service Command during the war, serving as a P-39 Airacobra modification center April 1944 – May 1945 for lend-lease aircraft being sent to Russia via the Alaska Territory.

Following the end of the war in Europe in May 1945, McChord redeployed thousands of troops arriving from the European theater to the Pacific as part of Air Transport Command in anticipation of invading the Japanese home islands scheduled for November 1. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 forced the surrender of Japan, cancelling the planned operation altogether.

===Cold War===
In 1945 McChord was designated as a permanent station by the Army Air Forces. It was assigned to Continental Air Forces in April 1945, becoming headquarters of the 1st and 2d Bomb Wings after their return from combat in Europe. In 1948, the field was re-designated McChord Air Force Base.

====Air Defense Command====
: &quot;see also: 25th Air Division&quot;

On 1 August 1946, McChord was assigned to the new Air Defense Command, with a mission of air defense of the United States. During the Cold War, numerous fighter-interceptor squadrons were stationed at the base, as well as Radar and Command and Control organizations, the 25th Air Division being headquartered at McChord from 1951 until 1990.

The 325th Fighter Group (All-Weather) operated two squadrons of F-82F Twin Mustangs from McChord between 1948 and 1950, the first postwar fighter optimized for the air defense interceptor mission. Designed for very-long range bomber escort missions in the Pacific during World War II, the design became operational too late to see service and was adapted for the air defense mission.

Other interceptor squadrons stationed at McChord were:
* 64th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron
* 317th Fighter Interceptor Squadron
* 318th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron
* 465th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron
* 498th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron

The base was the location of the first of twenty-eight stations built by ADC as part of the permanent air defense radar network, and was the top-priority site for ADC radars. The 505th Aircraft Control and Warning Group, the first postwar general surveillance radar organization was activated at McChord on 21 May 1947. Defensive warning radars became operational at McChord on 1 June 1950 with World War II-era AN/CPS-4 and AN/CPS-5 radars being operated by the 635th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron. ADC completed installation of two AN/CPS-6B medium-range search and height-finder radars in February 1951. Performance of these new radars was deemed inferior to the World War II vintage models and the calibration process delayed operational readiness at this and other sites. An AN/FPS-6 height-finder radar was installed in the mid-1950s.

In 1958, a Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Data Center (DC-12), and Combat Center (CC-3) was established at McChord. It became operational in 1960. The SAGE system was a network linking Air Force (and later FAA) General Surveillance Radar stations into a centralized center for Air Defense, intended to provide early warning and response for a Soviet nuclear attack. It was initially under the command of the Seattle Air Defense Sector (SeADS), activated on 8 January 1958.

The ADC radar site (P-1) was deactivated 1 April 1960 and repositioned to Fort Lawton AFS (RP-1) where the Air Force consolidated its anti-aircraft radars with the United States Army Seattle Defense Area Army Air-Defense Command Post (AADCP) S-90DC for Nike missile operations.

SeADS was inactivated on 1 April 1966 and the SAGE headquarters combat center came under the 25th Air Division. The Command Center (CC-3) was active until 30 June 1966 when it was inactivated as part of an ADC reorganization. The Data Center (DC-12), with its AN/FSQ-7 computer remained active until 4 August 1983 under the 25th AD when technology advances made the SAGE system obsolete.

Today, the successor organization to the 25th AD, the Western Air Defense Sector (WADS), is a major tenant organization at McChord, being one of two air defense sectors responsible for the security and integrity of continental United States air space. WADS is staffed by members of the Washington Air National Guard (WANG) and the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Operationally, WADS reports to the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) headquartered at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado.

====Military Airlift Command====
In 1947 Tactical Air Command moved the 62nd Troop Carrier Group to McChord Field from Bergstrom Field, Texas. Headquarters Army Air Forces directed each Army Air Force have a tactical group assigned to establish a Wing headquarters. Thus, the 62nd Troop Carrier Wing (TCW), constituted on 28 July 1947, was activated at McChord Field on 15 August. The new Wing was assigned to Twelfth Air Force, with the 62nd Troop Carrier Group becoming one of the Wing&#x27;s subordinate units; its flying arm, being equipped with Curtiss C-46 Commandos. In 1948, 62nd TCW assets were tapped to support the now famous Berlin Airlift. More than 100 men, primarily mechanics, aerial engineers, and truck drivers were identified for a 90-day temporary tour of duty in Europe, to bolster airlift resources.

On 6 October 1949, the 62nd received its first four-engine Douglas C-54 Skymaster transport. By Thanksgiving of that same year, the Wing was equipped entirely with C-54s, and its designation was changed from 62nd Troop Carrier Wing (Medium), to (Heavy). On 1 June 1950, the Wing was inactivated due to budget reductions. However, as a result of the Korean War, on 17 September 1951, the Wing was once again activated at McChord AFB. Shortly thereafter, the Group and its three flying squadrons, the 4th, 7th, and 8th, again assigned to the Wing, returned to McChord. Not two years had passed, however, before the Wing was once again on the move. Now flying the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II.

During 1952 and 1953, the 62nd airlifted troops, blood plasma, aircraft parts, ammunition, medical supplies, and much more, to the Far East, in support of the war in Korea. In April 1954, the 62nd transported a replacement French garrison to Dien Bien Phu, French Indochina. Operation Bali Hai saw the Globemasters fly around the world in a period of 8 to 10 days. By 1955 the Cold War was well under way, and the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) set out to build a chain of radar stations on the northernmost reaches of the continent. This chain of radars, known as the Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line, was to detect incoming Soviet missiles and bombers, and give the U.S. forces enough warning to launch a counterattack, and get the National Command Authorities to safety. Between 1955 and 1957, the 62nd began to fly missions to the Alaskan arctic regions, carrying 13 million pounds of supplies and equipment to build the DEW Line. The resupply of the DEW Line stations kept the Wing occupied until 1969.

The 62nd Troop Carrier Wing (Heavy) was reassigned to the Military Air Transport Service Continental Division on 1 July 1957 as TAC realigned its transport units. Meanwhile, the Air Force reorganized the structure of its wings, and the 62nd Troop Carrier Group, was inactivated 8 January 1960 when squadrons were assigned directly to the wing as part of the Air Force tri-deputate reorganization.

During the International Geophysical Year 1957–1958, and subsequently through 1962 the 62nd TCW supported scientific stations in the Arctic Ocean by airlanding and airdropping supplies on the drifting ice. It helped transport United Nations troops and supplies to the Congo in 1960. In 1963 the wing assumed responsibility for worldwide airlift of nuclear weapons and associated equipment, continuing this mission through early 1971.

In 1968, McChord AFB was relieved of its assignment to the subsequently renamed Aerospace Defense Command and was reassigned to Military Airlift Command (MAC) as one of three MAC bases in the western United States operating the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter. ADC, and later Tactical Air Command (TAC) continued to maintain a fighter alert detachment at McChord with Convair F-106 Delta Dart and later McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle aircraft.

On 18 September 1969 a United States Air Force twin engine Douglas C-47 Skytrain crashed just after takeoff from McChord. It came down in the wooded area just south of the runway. Five men died and seven other men were injured.

In 1975, TAC divested itself of its Lockheed C-130 Hercules tactical airlift fleet, transferring all tactical airlift wings, groups and squadrons to MAC. For the 62 AW, this resulted in a significant increase in the wing&#x27;s total mission capabilities beyond strictly strategic airlift with the arrival of the 36th Tactical Airlift Squadron (36 TAS) and their C-130E aircraft and personnel from Langley Air Force Base, Virginia.

In 1980, following the eruption of Mount St. Helens, a 36 TAS C-130 crew provided communications support during the search for survivors. One week after St. Helen&#x27;s first eruption, a second one occurred. All of the base&#x27;s flyable aircraft were evacuated following reports that ash was drifting northwest toward McChord. In 1988 McChord became involved in combating devastating Yellowstone National Park forest fires, carrying troops from Fort Lewis to the fire areas.

In 1991, Clark Air Base in the Philippines was evacuated due to the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. By 16 June, the evacuation order was issued and the first plane load of evacuees arrived at McChord on the 18th. In 1992, with the disestablishment of Military Airlift Command, McChord became an Air Mobility Command base. In November of that same year, two McChord C-141 Starlifters, participating in an air refueling training mission over north central Montana, collided in mid-air, killing all 13 crewmen.

=== From the 1990s ===
As the C-141 was phased out at McChord during the 1990s, it was replaced with the C-17 Globemaster III. McChord AFB and the 62nd Airlift Wing was the second AMC base to receive this aircraft for active duty, the first having been the 437th Airlift Wing (437 AW) at Charleston AFB, South Carolina.

McChord has been the host base for the Air Mobility Rodeo in 1998, 2005, 2007 and 2009.

On 1 February 2010 it again joined with Fort Lewis to become Joint Base Lewis-McChord, per the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission.

Like most US military installations, McChord is closed to the general public, other than during their annual Open House.

The McChord Field Historic District was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on 12 December 2008.

<text>Midland is a census-designated place (CDP) in Pierce County, Washington. The population was 9,962 at the time of the 2020 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 3.04 square miles (7.9 km2), all of it land.

==History==

The area that we have come to know as Midland in part was often referred to by the pioneers as Puyallup Hill. Taking advantage of the Governments Donation Land Grant of 1850, both Ezra Meeker and his older brother Oliver Meeker settled in the area in 1855. This was after their father, Jacob Meeker came west. Jacob settled in the area of South Tacoma. Not wanting to cross the sound Jacob talked both sons into moving to the mainland from their island home on McNeil Island. With this Ezra and Oliver staked out claims on the mainland next to each other. Ezra located his claim on the north side of Oliver&#x27;s claim. These claims were described as the forest between Nisqually Plain and the Puyallup River.

Hudson Bay employees often referenced the northern end of Nisqually Plain as the Puyallup Plain, which is all of South Tacoma and Lakewood. Just to the east of this was called the Puyallup Swamp, that area to the north of Wapato Lake and south following the base of the Puyallup Hill.

The claims&#x27; combined borders are starting from the north and moving clockwise. The North border is now the 88th hundred block. The East border is now 24th Avenue E. jogging over at 96th to Swan creek, and south to 104th Street E. The South border is now 104th Street E. jogging over at 14th Avenue E to roughly 109th Street E. and west to Golden Given Road E. The West border is now Golden Given Road E. Golden Given Road E is also the east border of the Jessie Dunlap Donation Land Claim with the north and south borders roughly the same as the combined Meeker claims. Ezra talked of how his three closest neighbors were connected by a road and trails. The forest was so tall and thick that it was impossible to see any of the neighbors&#x27; houses. Come night it was impossible to see for the stars and moon could not penetrate the tree canopy.

A few years after the local uprising of the native populace more commonly known as the Indian War of 1855 &amp; 56 and the death of his brother Oliver while on a family business trip in San Francisco, Ezra became disenchanted with his claim and in 1862 moved to Puyallup. Years later with the claims finally secured from the government both by Ezra and Oliver&#x27;s wife Amanda, the claims were then sold.

In September 1888, Joesephus S. Howell and Dr. Charles H. Spinning developed both claims into lots with streets, the Plat of Southeast Tacoma. The water company that served the area for many years prior to Tacoma Power &amp; Water was named after this plat, the Southeast Tacoma Mutual Water Company. 97th Street E, also known in the past as Mount Tacoma Drive, was originally platted as Division Avenue. It was also the dividing line between Ezra&#x27;s and Oliver&#x27;s claims. North from Division the streets that run from east to west were North 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Street. South of Division was South 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Street. Streets that ran from north to south were named after the presidents of the United States, and most of these streets retained their presidents’ names well into the 20th century. The changes to the current numbered streets took place when Pierce County updated its addressing system for the 1982 Enhanced 911 Emergency Dispatch system. Within a year of the Southeast Tacoma Plat, a Railroad and Trolley would come to the area.

The western part of the Washington Territory became the State of Washington on 11 November 1889. One railroad was already here and others wanting to come. Land speculation was riding high and it was no different for the Midland area. In 1889 three Railroads came to this area, well, at least on paper, and they secured their rights of way. This was the Tacoma Puyallup Railway, Tacoma Eastern Railroad, and the Portland &amp; Puget Sound Railroad.

The first was the Tacoma Puyallup Railway incorporated by a man named Randolph Foster Radebaugh. R.F. Radebaugh came to Tacoma from San Francisco in 1880 and was one of Tacoma&#x27;s best promoters from the very start. He was the father of the Daily Ledger, Tacoma&#x27;s first daily newspaper. In 1889 Randolph put together the street car line, named the Tacoma and Fern Hill Railway for the area it served. Later within the same year, that line was extended into Midland and on towards Puyallup. The name was changed to Tacoma Puyallup Railway. If you lived in Tacoma or on the hill, the line was generally referred to as the Puyallup Hill Line. If you lived in Puyallup it was affectionately called the Grapevine Line. Later, Puyallup was served by another railway called the Short Line. The old line then became the Old Grapevine Line.

This streetcar line was initially powered by a steam dummy on a narrow gauge 40 lb. rail. The steam dummy at the time was an eight-ton locomotive that from the outside looked like a coach rail car. In later years, the rail line became part of Tacoma Railway &amp; Power Company. The line was then converted to standard gauge and electrified. Upon completion of the initial line the last spike was driven by the nephew of Ezra Meeker, Frank Oliver Meeker on June 29, 1890. Frank owned the land near the southwest corner of the newly incorporated City of Puyallup and near where the street car line first entered the city limits. This was also the same area where years later in 1919, the rail lines were washed out, never to be replaced. With the Short Line in place and serving Puyallup from the north, the old line was abandoned up to Woodland and the tracks removed. The communities from Woodland to Tacoma would still be served for a few more years by the Puyallup Hill Line.

The second rail line into Midland was that of the Hart brothers’ railroad. Incorporated as Tacoma Eastern Railroad, this was to serve their saw mill operation at 46th St. E. and McKinley. Within a short time it was extended into the forests of the Midland area. On paper the right of way continued out to what is now the 23 hundred block of 112th St. E. This is close to where the Washington State Patrol building is now. Over time the ownership changed and the line was completed to Ashford. By 1905 the line was extended across the river into Lewis County and on into Mineral. Within a few years, the end of the line had reached the logging town of Morton.

The third rail line into the area never got past the surveying of the right of way. This was the Portland and Puget Sound Railroad out of Portland, Oregon. This was a disguised Union Pacific rail line. The Union Pacific had been trying to access the Puget Sound region for a number of years. If people got wind of another major railroad coming to town, land prices would escalate. So, a lot of railroad companies would try to hide the fact that a major railroad was coming in. They would disguise themselves as a newly formed, on a shoestring budget-type railroad. In actuality, by 1889 the Union Pacific Rail Road was having genuine financial difficulties and was on a shoe string budget anyway. In 1890 Jay Gould and John D. Rockefeller pooled their money and gained control of the Union Pacific, halting further progress of the Portland and Puget Sound Rail Road. However, after the death of Jay Gould and some years later, the plans for the Union Pacific to gain access to the Puget Sound Region were revived, under the new name of the Oregon &amp; Washington Rail Road, later changed to the Oregon &amp; Washington Railroad &amp; Navigation Company. In the beginning, with multiple speculated routes, the Union Pacific was serious enough to start digging tunnels in the hills of both major cities: Tacoma and Seattle. Before the tunnels could be finished an agreement was made with Northern Pacific to use the water line route and gain access to Tacoma through the Bennett Tunnel that runs under Pt. Defiance. This, however, did not stop any rumors of the Union Pacific building their shops in the Midland area using the old Portland and Puget Sound right of way.

&quot;Midland&quot; first shows up in writing on the Midland Townsite Plat of 1890, by the Olympic Land Company. The Plat&#x27;s northern border is 104th St. E. from the 14 hundred block on the west to a half block east of 26th Ave. E. This street was named &quot;Achilles&quot; (104th St. E.), and was also the southern border of the Southeast Tacoma Plat from the year before. The north–south street names followed suit with Southeast Tacoma Plat(president&#x27;s names). Where there were extra streets, they were named after trees. The southern border is 112th St E with the 14 hundred block on the west to just past 22nd Ave E, then north to the 107 hundred block, and West to half a block east of 26th Ave. E. This puts Midland Elementary School in the Northeast area of the plat, Ford Middle school in the Northwest corner of the plat and Franklin Pierce High School in the Southwest corner of the plat.

The consensus of the people in the area has always been that Midland was named for the midpoint of the Old Trolley Line. The actual midpoint centers on 97th St E. and Portland Avenue, almost a ½ mile nearer to Tacoma from the townsite plat where Midland school is located. The town site of the Midland Plat was signed and notarized on the 10th of April 1890. Frank Meeker drove the customary last spike on June 29, 1890, making the track still under construction when the plat was signed. Because the Plat of Midland was close to the center of the street car line, it is most likely that the Midland Townsite was named by its planners for the midpoint of the new trolley line. In 1900, the centralized community of Midland was centered on the corner of Achilles (also known as Summit Road) and Van Buren St. known today as 104th St E. and Portland Ave E. The Midland Community of today now centers closer to the actual midpoint of the old trolley Line at 99th St E. and Portland Ave.

<text>Orting is a city in Pierce County, Washington, United States. The population was 9,041 at the 2020 census. It is located between the Puyallup and Carbon rivers in central Pierce County, approximately northwest of Mount Rainier.

==History==

The first recorded claims for land in Orting were made in 1854 by William Henry Whitesell, Thomas Headley, Daniel Lane, and Daniel Varner. Streets in the modern city are named after the four men, and a monument in Orting City Park commemorates them. The area was named Gunson&#x27;s Prairie by early settlers and later known as Carbon. The townsite was renamed Orting by a Northern Pacific Railway superintendent in 1877 during construction of the company&#x27;s railroad to Wilkeson. The name is claimed to be an indigenous word meaning &quot;prairie&quot;. Orting was officially incorporated as a city on April 22, 1889.

Early growth surrounded the area&#x27;s production and logging industries. Later, Christmas tree and flower bulb farms also became part of the local economy. Orting was also a supply town for the coal mining towns Wilkeson and Carbonado . The first railroad in the city was built in 1877 by the Northern Pacific Railway, called &quot;Whitesell&#x27;s Crossing&quot; because it ran right through the Whitesell property. Because railroads eased transportation, Orting&#x27;s population quickly increased. Remaining parts from the railroad are part of the Meeker Southern Railroad, which runs between Puyallup and McMillin.

Orting&#x27;s boundaries remained unchanged until its first annexation was completed in February 1959. The city became a suburban bedroom community for commuters from Tacoma and Seattle in the 2000s; several residential subdivisions were constructed in the areas surrounding Orting&#x27;s historic downtown. In March 2008, the city&#x27;s weekly newspaper, &quot;The Gazette&quot;, ceased publication.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Mount Rainier===

The city sits in a fertile valley between two major rivers, the Carbon and Puyallup. It is built entirely on several layers of lahar deposits. Orting is located about from Mount Rainier. Based on studies of past lahar flow and the mountain&#x27;s structure, Orting has been designated the most at-risk city from Mount Rainier&#x27;s lahar activity; scientists predict that lahar could reach Orting in 30 minutes from the mountain. The Mount Rainier Volcano Lahar Warning System has installed sirens throughout the area, activated by sensors on Mount Rainier. Local schools regularly stage lahar evacuation drills and residents are informed of lahar escape routes. Local citizens are designing the Bridge for Kids, a walking bridge across the Carbon River that could be used for recreation and rapid evacuation toward Cascadia, Washington.

==Demographics==
===2010 census===
The 2010 United States census recorded 6,746 people, 2,184 households and 1,688 families residing in the city. The population density was .

The racial makeup was 87.9% white, 1.5% African American, 1.4% Native American, 1.3% Asian, 0.5% Pacific Islander, 2.4% from other races, and 5.0% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race comprised 7.2% of the population.

Of the 2,184 households, 48.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 59.5% had married couples living together, 11.5% had a female householder with no husband present, 6.3% had a male householder with no wife present, and 22.7% did not have families. Households with only one person made up 16.5% and the total, and those with an individual person 65 years of age or older made up 5.8%. The average household size was 3.01 people and the average family size was 3.34.

The median age was 32.7 years: 30.7% of residents were under the age of 18,; 7.8%, between the ages of 18 and 24, 31.8%, from 25 to 44, 19.5%, 45 to 64 and 10.2% were 65 years of age or older. The sex makeup was 50.7% male and 49.3% female.

===2000 census===
The median household income was $53,464 and the median family income was $55,335. Males had a median income of $41,486 and females $26,438. The per capita income was $18,951. About 4.2% of families and 6.5% of the population had incomes below the poverty line, including 5.2% of those under the age of 18 and 15.8% of those 65 and older.

==Places==
===Washington Soldiers Home===
The Washington Soldiers Home provides nursing care, medical care and support services for veterans and family members. It is located on the Orting Kapowsin Highway southwest of the city. Nearby, the Soldiers Home Cemetery contains 2,265 graves, including four Medal of Honor recipients from the American Civil War.

===Hatcheries===
The Voights Creek Hatchery is located outside Orting, attracting fishermen for its salmon.

===Parks and murals===

Orting has several city parks, including community and neighborhood parks with sportsfields and walking trails. Main City Park in downtown includes a covered gazebo and a memorial wall. Historic murals are scattered on buildings throughout the city.

==Daffodil Parade==
Orting is the fourth and final stop in the annual Daffodil Festival Parade. With the exception of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and 1943-1945 due to the Second World War, the parade has gone through downtown Orting since 1934 and draws over 10,000 people in early April to festivities. The parade can be seen in late afternoon. It also goes through the cities of Tacoma, Puyallup and Sumner. School bands play and the Daffodil Queen appears.

==Public safety==
The Orting Police handle law enforcement within city limits, comprising 11 commissioned officers and one full-time working civilian. Despite large growth in population, the police department&#x27;s staffing levels have experienced little change.

In November 2016, the City of Orting paid $250,000 to a former Orting police officer, Gerry Pickens, to settle a racial discrimation lawsuit. Pickens was the first black officer in the city and was fired a few days before his probationary period was due to end. His personal vehicle was spray-painted with a racial slur and a threat to not sue the police chief. The legal settlement was controversial at the time as it occurred despite the release of an independent investigation into Pickens&#x27; employment with the city revealed numerous reports of his on-duty misconduct, neglect of duty, dishonesty and general incompetence in his role as a police officer.

Orting Valley Fire and Rescue handles all fire and medical aid service needs in the city and the surrounding unincorporated area. It operates three stations.

==Education==
The Orting School District operates four schools:
*Orting Elementary School (grades pre-K–4)
*Ptarmigan Ridge Elementary School (grades K–5)
*Orting Middle School (grades 6–8)
*Orting High School (grades 9–12)

==Transportation==
Orting is close to State Route 162. The closest Sounder commuter rail station is in Sumner, Washington.

===Foothills Trail===
The Pierce County Foothills Trail is a paved trail built on an old railroad bed. It runs through Orting to South Prairie in one direction and to Sumner in the other. Activities allowed on the trail include walking, bicycling, horseback riding, skating, skateboarding and scooter riding. Motorized vehicles are prohibited. Although the trail was built for recreation, many bicycle commuters use it.

The most influential motorway is State Route 7/Pacific Ave, which travels north and south, and leads from Interstate 5 in Tacoma all the way to Mount Rainier. Pacific Ave is also a main commercial corridor through much of the county, including Parkland.

It was given its name by early white settlers for the park-like nature of the vast Garry Oak and blue camas flower prairie, and the many meandering creeks crossing it. In 1890, Norwegian-Americans from the Midwest chose this area as the site of their new college, which is now Pacific Lutheran University, home to 3,500 full-time students and the Lutes varsity sports teams.

<doc id="138155" wikidata="Q179336" url="?curid=138155" title="Puyallup, Washington">
<text>Puyallup ( ) is a city in Pierce County, Washington, United States. It is on the Puyallup River about southeast of Tacoma and south of Seattle. The city had a population of 42,973 at the 2020 census.

The city&#x27;s name comes from the Puyallup tribe of Native Americans and means &quot;the generous people&quot; in Lushootseed. Puyallup is home to the Washington State Fair, the state&#x27;s largest annual fair. The name of the city is also used in mailing addresses for adjacent unincorporated areas, such as the larger-populated South Hill.

==History==
The Puyallup Valley was originally inhabited by the Puyallup people, known in their language as the spuyaləpabš, meaning &quot;generous and welcoming behavior to all people (friends and strangers) who enter our lands.&quot; The first white settlers in the region were part of the first wagon train to cross the Cascade Range at Naches Pass in 1853.

Native Americans numbered about 2,000 in what is now the Puyallup Valley in the 1830s and 1840s. The first European settlers arrived in the 1850s. In 1877, Ezra Meeker platted a townsite and named it Puyallup after the local Puyallup Indian tribes, 11 years after departing from Indiana. The town grew rapidly throughout the 1880s, in large part thanks to Meeker&#x27;s hop farm, which brought in millions of dollars to Puyallup, leading to it eventually being incorporated in 1890, with Ezra Meeker as its first mayor. The turn of the 20th century brought change to the valley with the growth of nearby Tacoma and the interurban rail lines. The Western Washington Fairgrounds were developed giving local farmers a place to exhibit their crops and livestock. During the early part of World War II due to Executive Order 9066, the fairgrounds were part of Camp Harmony, a temporary Japanese American internment camp for more than 7,000 detainees, most of whom were American citizens. Subsequently, they were moved to the Minidoka relocation center near Twin Falls, Idaho.

==Geography==
Puyallup is approximately southeast of Tacoma and south of Seattle. It is situated along the Puyallup River, which flows for from the Puyallup and Tahoma glaciers on Mount Rainier to Commencement Bay in Tacoma. The river drains an area of and was formed approximately 5,600 years before present. The city lies within the Puyallup Valley, an agricultural region that produces berries and daffodils, for which the annual local festival is named.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water, mainly consisting of the Puyallup River estuary. Puyallup is surrounded by unincorporated areas; its closest municipalities include the city of Sumner to the northeast, Fife and Edgewood to the north, Tacoma to the northwest, Summit and Midland to the west, South Hill, Graham and Frederickson to the south, McMillin and Orting to the southeast, and Alderton to the east.

The city includes wildlife habitats for urbanized bird species and small mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. The riparian areas near streams and the Puyallup River host coho salmon, chinook salmon, chum salmon, birds, salamanders, frogs, osprey, ducks, river otters, and beavers.

===Volcanic risk===

Downtown Puyallup and nearby neighborhoods lie within the hazard zone for lahars that could be produced in a moderate or large eruption of nearby Mount Rainier. The city&#x27;s position on the Puyallup River is downstream of the western flank of Mount Rainier, which has the highest potential for producing far-traveled lahars due to the abundance of weakened clay-rich rock at high altitudes. The entire Puyallup Valley is built on deposits of the 5,600-year-old Osceola Mudflow, which deposited as much as of material and was similar to largest lahars Mount Rainier could produce. A 2009 study by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) determined that Puyallup has the highest number of dependent-population facilities, public venues, and overall community assets within lahar hazard zones. The Washington State Department of Natural Resources estimates that the Puyallup Valley could experience $6–12 billion in damage from a major lahar.

To combat lahar danger, Pierce County maintains the Mount Rainier Volcano Lahar Warning System, implemented in 1998 by the USGS. The system includes lahar warning sirens and volcano evacuation route signs. The Puyallup city government and Puyallup School District have also taken part in annual lahar exercises to prepare the community and test warning systems. The 2014 drill included 5,000 students at all schools in the district; Puyallup High School was fully evacuated within four minutes and the first group of students reached a designated high-ground area in nineteen minutes. The March 2024 drill included 45,000 participants across the region and was the largest lahar evacuation drill that the USGS described as the &quot;world&#x27;s largest&quot;.

==History==

Roy was officially incorporated on January 16, 1908. It is a rural city outside Tacoma and primarily features ranch-style homes and farms.

A major fire in 1929 wiped out most of the downtown businesses just before the Depression started. The railroad eventually discontinued using Roy as a main stop. The Army annexed most of the surrounding land to the north and west, limiting expansion and the local tax base, and erasing the nearby community of Loveland.

Major features and/or attractions in Roy and the vicinity include the Roy Pioneer Rodeo, attracting participants and spectators from several states and Canada.

<doc id="138157" wikidata="Q1507715" url="?curid=138157" title="Ruston, Washington">
<text>Ruston is a city in Pierce County, Washington, United States. The population was 1,055 at the 2020 census.

Although it is nearly indistinguishable from the adjacent city of Tacoma, the predominantly residential area still retains its status as a separate municipality long after it ceased to be a company town. The local government opted to reclassify Ruston as a city in late 2012.

==History==
In 1890, industrialist William R. Rust established Tacoma Smelting &amp; Refining Company and a company town named the &quot;Smelter District&quot;. The company took over an existing smelter that had opened two years earlier and began refining lead; it expanded to more than 300 employees by 1905, with most living in the Smelter District. In 1906, Rust proposed the creation of a new city, which residents named &quot;Ruston&quot; in his honor. Ruston was officially incorporated as a city on November 10, 1906, surrounded on one side by Commencement Bay and all other sides the city of Tacoma.

The Tacoma Smelting &amp; Refining Company was acquired by the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO) in 1905 and its Ruston facility was converted for copper smelting. A prominent brick smokestack was constructed in 1917 and originally measured in height and was the tallest in the world until it was reduced to following earthquake damage in 1937. The facility&#x27;s waste slag was dumped into Commencement Bay for land expansion, while the smokestack produced plumes that polluted portions of Pierce County. The smelter closed in 1985 due to a decline in copper prices and new regulations on arsenic pollution; the facility employed 700 people at the time. The smokestack was demolished on January 17, 1993, amid a major environmental cleanup under the Superfund program.

The Superfund cleanup extended to most of the town and required the removal of contaminated soil in and around properties. By 2006, cleanup was largely complete and median home prices had doubled over a three-year period as Ruston became a desirable bedroom community. The Ruston town council passed a measure to become a noncharter code city under Washington law in late 2012. Officials indicated that the &quot;Town of Ruston&quot; moniker would continue to be used. Development of residential and commercial buildings on the smelter site, renamed &quot;Point Ruston&quot;, began in 2013 and the first phase opened the following year. The area, described as an urban village, also includes waterfront parkspace and a multi-use path that connects to Point Defiance Park. The full development of Point Ruston is planned to include 1,200 residential units, a waterfront hotel, and various commercial spaces. The development&#x27;s properties were later placed in receivership due to failed payments to a lender by the new owners of various phases.

==Geography==

Ruston is surrounded on three sides by the city of Tacoma; to the north is Puget Sound.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

<text>South Hill is a census-designated place (CDP) in Pierce County, Washington, immediately south of Puyallup. The population was 64,708 at time of the 2020 census, up from 52,431 in 2010. The area primarily consists of suburban housing and shopping with several retail shopping centers, residential neighborhoods, and apartment/condo complexes throughout. Because South Hill is unincorporated, its addresses are part of the Puyallup &quot;postal city&quot; or ZCTA.

Most commercial areas are located along the main thoroughfare, Meridian Avenue (State Route 161). Major neighborhoods include Manorwood, Sunrise (Sunrise Master Association), Lipoma Firs, Silvercreek, and Gem Heights. There are also a few popular public parks: Bradley Lake Park, South Hill Community Park/Nathan Chapman Memorial Trail and Wildwood Park.

The area was first settled in the 1880s after a military road was built through the area in the 1850s. Several logging camps, farms, and hunting grounds sprouted up as the area was settled. It also was the main route to the towns of Kapowsin and Eatonville (Meridian Avenue or SR 161). Population growth was slow until after World War II, when roads improved and people could commute to nearby Tacoma, Fort Lewis, and Seattle.

Company maps and journals show the company&#x27;s subsidiary, the Pugets Sound Agricultural Company, raised cattle, grain, and sheep at &quot;Spanueh Station&quot; on the south and east shores of &quot;Spanueh Lake.&quot; Spanueh is the Hudson Bay Company&#x27;s spelling of the native Lushootseed &quot;spadue&quot;, which means &quot;dug roots&quot; referring to an area where camas and other edible roots can be found. Lushootseed underwent a loss of nasal consonants in the 1800s, so &quot;Spanueh&quot; simply transcribes an older pronunciation of what is now &quot;Spadue&quot;.

The first white settler to take a donation claim by the lake, Henry de la Bushalier, tried to rename the lake after himself. That faded away with his death one year later. In 1890 the area was renamed &quot;Lake Park&quot; as a planned community by the Lake Park Land, Railway and Improvement Company, which bought all the nearby land east of the lake and built a rail line to its &quot;recreation mecca&quot; on the shore of &quot;Spanaway Lake.&quot; When Mount Rainier National Park was established in 1899, tourists would take the train to its terminus in Lake Park and from there make the two-day journey to Mount Rainier, making Spanaway the original &quot;gateway&quot; to Mount Rainier. The journey was made by stagecoach, with an overnight stop in Eatonville; the route was in operation as early as 1893.

Although the U.S. Board on Geographic Names recognized the community of &quot;Lake Park&quot; in 1897, it had to very belatedly reverse its decision in 1970 to accept common usage: Spanaway (Spanueh).

In the 21st century, several attempts were made to incorporate Spanaway and neighboring communities into a city.

<doc id="138161" wikidata="Q1507851" url="?curid=138161" title="Steilacoom, Washington">
<text>Steilacoom ( ) is a town in Pierce County, Washington, United States. The population was 6,727 at the 2020 census. Steilacoom incorporated in 1854 and became the first incorporated town in what is now the state of Washington. It has also become a bedroom community for service members stationed at Joint Base Lewis–McChord, aka McChord AFB and Fort Lewis.

Based on per capita income, Steilacoom ranks 61st of 522 areas ranked in the state of Washington.

==Name==
The origin of the name &quot;Steilacoom&quot; is unclear. According to the Legacy Washington program, the town&#x27;s name is derived from a Native American word meaning &quot;little pink flower.&quot; Another possibility is that it was named by fur traders with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) and is an adaptation of &quot;Tail-a-Koom,&quot; the name of a Native American chief. In 1824, chief factor John Work called the town &quot;Chilacoom&quot;. Another early spelling was &quot;Chelakom&quot;. The Town of Steilacoom says it was named after the Steilacoom tribe, especially their main village in the Tacoma area, located on Chambers Bay. Robert Hitchman noted in &quot;Place Names of Washington&quot; that Steilacoom Creek, which feeds into Chambers Creek, held the name before the town.

==History==

The Steilacoom people, a Coast Salish tribe, lived in what became the city of Steilacoom. Their main village was called Scht’ləqʷəm, later anglicized as &quot;Steilacoom&quot;. William Bright says the name comes from the Southern Coast Salish subgroup &quot;/č&#x27;tílqʷəbš/&quot;, anglicized as &quot;Steilacoom&quot;.

The United States Army established Fort Steilacoom in August 1849 following attacks on Fort Nisqually. European-American settlement at Steilacoom began with Lafayette Balch, a sea captain from Maine who arrived in 1851. The following year, Balch opened a sawmill to process and export lumber to San Francisco and named the settlement &quot;Port Steilacoom&quot;. An adjacent settlement, Steilacoom City, was founded in June 1851 by John B. Chapman. The two settlements were merged into Steilacoom, which was named the county seat of Pierce County on December 12, 1852, and incorporated on April 22, 1854. Steilacoom was the first town in Washington Territory to be incorporated.

Steilacoom had the first jail in Washington and the first sawmill. It has four individual buildings and sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the oldest Catholic Church in the state, the first Protestant Church north of the Columbia River, as well as the Steilacoom Historic District, with 68 contributing properties. The town remained prominent in the region until the construction of the Northern Pacific Railway, which opened in 1873 with a terminus in Tacoma. The county seat was moved from Steilacoom to Tacoma in 1880; an interurban streetcar was built in 1891 to connect the two cities. Fort Steilacoom was redeveloped into Western State Hospital, a state-run mental health facility that now lies in the adjacent and larger city of Lakewood.

==Geography==
Steilacoom is situated on Puget Sound between the Nisqually River delta and the Tacoma Narrows. It sits across from Anderson and Ketron islands to the west and McNeil Island to the northwest. The city is bordered to the south by Joint Base Lewis–McChord, a major military installation, and to the north by Chambers Bay, a public golf course. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

==Transportation==
There are no state highways in Steilacoom. Drivers can access Interstate 5 or State Route 512 by driving through the adjacent city of Lakewood.

BNSF operates a railroad running along Steilacoom&#x27;s shoreline, with the Union Pacific Railroad having trackage rights on this line as well. However, there is no active station in the city and passenger trains do not stop there. Passenger service to the city ended in 1971. With the November 18, 2021 opening of the Point Defiance bypass route, Amtrak passenger service is now on an inland line from Tacoma through South Tacoma, Lakewood and DuPont, essentially parallel to Interstate 5. With this new route in operation, Steilacoom&#x27;s rail line is now for freight only.

Pierce County maintains a Steilacoom-Anderson Island Ferry which departs from Steilacoom and serves Anderson and Ketron islands.

==Education==
Public schools are operated by the Steilacoom Historical School District #1, which was first established in 1854.

Steilacoom High School is the district&#x27;s comprehensive high school.

<text>Tacoma ( ) is the county seat of Pierce County, Washington, United States. A port city, it is situated along Washington&#x27;s Puget Sound, southwest of Seattle, southwest of Bellevue, northeast of the state capital, Olympia, northwest of Mount Rainier National Park, and east of Olympic National Park. The city&#x27;s population was 219,346 at the time of the 2020 census. Tacoma is the second-largest city in the Puget Sound area and the third-most populous in the state. Tacoma also serves as the center of business activity for the South Sound region, which has a population of about 1 million.

Tacoma adopted its name after the nearby Mount Rainier, called in the Puget Sound Salish dialect, and “Takhoma” in an anglicized version. It is locally known as the &quot;City of Destiny&quot; because the area was chosen to be the western terminus of the Northern Pacific Railroad in the late 19th century. The decision of the railroad was influenced by Tacoma&#x27;s neighboring deep-water harbor, Commencement Bay. By connecting the bay with the railroad, Tacoma&#x27;s motto became &quot;When rails meet sails&quot;. Commencement Bay serves the Port of Tacoma, a center of international trade on the Pacific Coast and Washington&#x27;s largest port. The city gained notoriety in 1940 for the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which earned the nickname &quot;Galloping Gertie&quot; due to the vertical movement of the deck during windy conditions.

Like most industrial cities, Tacoma suffered a prolonged decline in the mid-20th century as a result of suburbanization and divestment. Since the 1990s, downtown Tacoma has experienced a period of revitalization. Developments in the downtown include the University of Washington Tacoma; the T Line (formerly Tacoma Link), the first modern electric light rail service in the state; the state&#x27;s highest density of art and history museums; and a restored urban waterfront, the Thea Foss Waterway.

==History==

===Early history===

The area was inhabited for thousands of years by American Indians, most recently the Puyallup people, who lived in settlements on the delta.

In 1852, a Swede named Nicolas Delin built a water-powered sawmill on a creek near the head of Commencement Bay, but the small settlement that grew around it was abandoned during the Indian War of 1855–56. In 1864, pioneer and postmaster Job Carr, a Civil War veteran and land speculator, built a cabin (which also served as Tacoma&#x27;s first post office; a replica was built in 2000 near the original site in &quot;Old Town&quot;). Carr hoped to profit from the selection of Commencement Bay as the terminus of the Transcontinental Railroad, and sold most of his claim to developer Morton M. McCarver (1807–1875), who named his project Tacoma City, derived from the indigenous name for the mountain.

Tacoma was incorporated on November 12, 1875, following its selection in 1873 as the western terminus of the Northern Pacific Railroad due to lobbying by McCarver, future mayor John Wilson Sprague, and others. However, the railroad built its depot in New Tacoma, two miles (3 km) south of the Carr–McCarver development. The two communities grew together and joined, merging on January 7, 1884. The transcontinental link was effected in 1887, and the population grew from 1,098 in 1880 to 36,006 in 1890. Rudyard Kipling visited Tacoma in 1889 and said it was &quot;literally staggering under a boom of the boomiest&quot;.
George Francis Train was a resident for a few years in the late 19th century. In 1890, he staged a global circumnavigation starting and ending in Tacoma to promote the city. A plaque in downtown Tacoma marks the start and finish line.

In November 1885, white citizens led by then-mayor Jacob Weisbach expelled several hundred Chinese residents peacefully living in the city. As described by the account prepared by the Chinese Reconciliation Project Foundation, on the morning of November 3, &quot;several hundred men, led by the mayor and other city officials, evicted the Chinese from their homes, corralled them at 7th Street and Pacific Avenue, marched them to the railway station at Lakeview and forced them aboard the morning train to Portland, Oregon. The next day two Chinese settlements were burned to the ground.&quot;

The discovery of gold in the Klondike in 1898 led to Tacoma&#x27;s prominence in the region being eclipsed by the development of Seattle.

A major tragedy marred the end of the 19th century, when a streetcar accident resulted in significant loss of life on July 4, 1900.

From May to August 1907, the city was the site of a smelter workers&#x27; strike organized by Local 545 of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), with the goal of a fifty-cent per day pay raise. The strike was strongly opposed by the local business community, and the smelter owners threatened to blacklist organizers and union officials. The IWW opposed this move by trying to persuade inbound workers to avoid Tacoma during the strike. By August, the strike had ended without meeting its demands.

Tacoma was briefly (1915–1922) a major destination for big-time automobile racing, with one of the nation&#x27;s top-rated racing venues just outside the city limits, at the site of today&#x27;s Clover Park Technical College.

In 1924, Tacoma&#x27;s first movie studio, H. C. Weaver Studio, was sited at present-day Titlow Beach. At the time, it was the third-largest freestanding film production space in America, with the two larger facilities being located in Hollywood. The production studio was also the first of its kind in the Pacific Northwest The first film produced in Tacoma was &quot;Hearts and Fists&quot;, which starred John Bowers and premiered at Tacoma&#x27;s Rialto Theater. The studio&#x27;s importance has undergone a revival with the discovery of one of its most famous lost films, &quot;Eyes of the Totem&quot;.
 In 1932, the studios burned to the ground in a mysterious fire, and the production facility was never rebuilt. Several films were destroyed in the fire as old nitrate-based film did not survive.

===The Great Depression===
The 1929 crash of the stock market, resulting in the Great Depression, was only the first event in a series of misfortunes to hit Tacoma in the winter of 1929–30. In one of the coldest winters on record, Tacoma experienced mass power outages and eventually the shutdown of major power supply dams, leaving the city without sufficient power and heat. During the 30-day power shortage in the winter of 1929 and 1930, the engines of the aircraft carrier provided Tacoma with electricity.

A power grid failure paired with a newly rewritten city constitution – put into place to keep political power away from a single entity such as the railroad – created a standstill in the ability to further the local economy. Local businesses were affected as the sudden stop of loans limited progression of expansion and renewal funds for maintenance, leading to foreclosures. Families across the city experienced the fallout of economic depression as breadwinners sought to provide for their families. Shanty-town politics began to develop as the destitute needed some form of leadership to keep the peace.

====Hooverville====
At the intersection of Dock Street EXD and East D Street in the train yard, a shanty town became the solution to the growing scar of the depression. Tacoma&#x27;s Hooverville grew in 1924 as the homeless community settled on the waterfront. In 1927, Tacoma&#x27;s Hooverville was coined &quot;Hollywood&quot; due to the type of crimes at the camp. The population boomed in November 1930 through early 1931 as families from the neighboring McKinley and Hilltop areas were evicted.

Collecting scraps of metal and wood from local lumber stores and recycling centers, families began building shanties (shacks) for shelter. By 1934, alcoholism and suicide were a common event in the Hooverville that eventually led to its nickname of &quot;Hollywood on the Tide Flats&quot;, because of the Hollywood-style crimes and events taking place in the camp.

In 1935, Tacoma received national attention when George Weyerhaeuser, the nine-year-old son of prominent lumber industry executive J.P. Weyerhaeuser, was kidnapped while walking home from school. FBI agents from Portland handled the case, in which a ransom of $200,000 secured the release of the victim. Four persons were apprehended and convicted; the last to be released was paroled from McNeil Island in 1963. George Weyerhaeuser went on to become chairman of the board of the Weyerhaeuser Company.

In 1940, after eviction notices failed, the police department attempted to burn down Hooverville.

In 1956, the last occupant of &quot;Hollywood&quot; was evicted and the police used fire to level the grounds and make room for industrial growth.

===Post-WWII===
In 1951, an investigation by a state legislative committee revealed widespread corruption in Tacoma&#x27;s government, which had been organized commission-style since 1910. Voters approved a mayor and city-manager system in 1952.

Tacoma was featured prominently in the garage rock sound of the mid-1960s with bands including The Wailers and The Sonics. The surf rock band The Ventures were also from Tacoma.

Downtown Tacoma experienced a long decline through the mid-20th century. Harold Moss, later the city&#x27;s mayor, characterized late-1970s Tacoma as looking &quot;bombed out&quot; like &quot;downtown Beirut&quot; (a reference to the Lebanese Civil War that occurred at that time); &quot;Streets were abandoned, storefronts were abandoned and City Hall was the headstone and Union Station the footstone&quot; on the grave of downtown.

The first local referendums in the U.S. on computerized voting occurred in Tacoma in 1982 and 1987. On both occasions, voters rejected the computer voting systems that local officials sought to purchase. The campaigns, organized by Eleanora Ballasiotes, a conservative Republican, focused on the vulnerabilities of computers to fraud.

In 1998, Tacoma installed Click! Network, a high-speed fiber optic network throughout the community. The municipally owned power company, Tacoma Power, wired the city. In response, the State of Washington passed RCW 54.16.330 in 2000, effectively preventing further research and development of Click! Network until its repeal in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, a period of over 20 years.

===Downtown revival===

Beginning in the early 1990s, city residents and planners took steps to revitalize Tacoma, particularly its downtown. Among the projects were the federal courthouse in the former Union Station (1991); Save Our Station community group; Merritt+Pardini Architect (1991); Reed &amp; Stem Architects (1911); the adaptation of a group of century-old brick warehouses into a branch campus of the University of Washington; the numerous privately financed renovation projects near the campus; the Washington State History Museum (1996), echoing the architecture of Union Station; the Museum of Glass (2002); the Tacoma Art Museum (2003); and the region&#x27;s first light-rail line (2003). The glass and steel Greater Tacoma Convention and Trade Center opened in November 2004. America&#x27;s Car Museum was completed in late 2011 near the Tacoma Dome.

The Pantages Theater (first opened in 1918) anchors downtown Tacoma&#x27;s Theatre District. Tacoma Arts Live manages the Pantages, the Rialto Theater, and the Theatre on the Square. Tacoma Little Theatre (opened in 1918) is northwest of downtown in the Stadium District. Other attractions include the Grand Cinema, McMenamins Elks Temple, and the Landmark Temple Theatre.

==Government==
The government of the city of Tacoma operates under a council-manager system. The city council consists of an elected mayor (Victoria Woodards) and eight elected council members: five from individual city council districts and three others from the city at-large. All serve four-year terms and are elected in odd-numbered years. The council adopts and amends city laws, approves a two-year budget, establishes city policy, appoints citizens to boards and commissions, and performs other actions. The council also meets in &quot;standing committees&quot;, which examine the council&#x27;s work in more defined areas, such as &quot;Environment &amp; Public Works&quot;, &quot;Neighborhoods &amp; Housing&quot;, and &quot;Public Safety, Human Services &amp; Education&quot;. The council meets as a whole most Tuesdays at 5:00 p.m. in the council chambers at 747 Market St. Meetings are open to the public and provide for public input.

Victoria Woodards began her term as mayor of the City of Tacoma on January 2, 2018.

Broadnax, who was appointed to the office in January 2012 and left in 2017 to become the city manager of Dallas, Texas.

At the federal level, Tacoma is part of two congressional districts. The western and northern portions of the city are part of the 6th District, represented by Emily Randall. The eastern portion is in the 10th District, represented by former Tacoma mayor Marilyn Strickland.

==Economy==
Tacoma is the home of several international companies, including staffing company True Blue Inc., lumber company Simpson, and the food companies Roman Meal and Brown and Haley.

Frank C. Mars founded Mars, Incorporated, in 1911 in Tacoma.

Beginning in the 1930s, the city became known for the &quot;Tacoma Aroma&quot;, a distinctive, acrid odor produced by pulp and paper manufacturing on the industrial tide flats. In the late 1990s, Simpson Tacoma Kraft reduced total sulfur emissions by 90%. This largely eliminated the problem; where once the odor was ever-present, it is now only noticeable occasionally downtown, primarily when the wind is coming from the east. The mill produces pulpwood and linerboard products; previously owned by St. Regis the mill was sold to RockTenn in 2014. The mill&#x27;s name changed yet again in 2016 to WestRock and closed on September 30, 2023.

U.S. Oil and Refining operates an oil refinery on the tide flats in the Port of Tacoma. Built in Tacoma in 1952, it refines 39,000 barrels of petroleum per day.

The Tacoma Mall is the largest shopping center in Tacoma. It is owned by Simon Property Group. Anchor tenants include JC Penney, Macy&#x27;s, and Nordstrom.

An economic setback for the city occurred in September 2009 when Russell Investments, which has been in downtown Tacoma since its inception in 1936, announced it was moving its headquarters to Seattle along with several hundred white-collar jobs. A large regional office for State Farm occupied the building until 2018 when the building was purchased by the 909 Destiny Fund LLC. The building reopened as a multi-tenant Class A property. The anchor tenant is TOTE Alaska, which announced in 2019 that it would be relocating its Federal Way headquarters to the 909 A Street building&#x27;s top two floors.

Hospitals in Tacoma are operated by MultiCare Health System and Franciscan Health System. Hospitals include MultiCare Tacoma General Hospital, Mary Bridge Children&#x27;s Hospital, MultiCare Allenmore Hospital and St. Joseph Medical Center.

==Parks and recreation==

Parks and recreation services in and around Tacoma are governed by Metro Parks Tacoma, a municipal corporation established as a separate entity from the city government in 1907. Metro Parks maintains over fifty parks and open spaces in Tacoma.

Point Defiance Park, one of the largest urban parks in the country (at 700 acres), is in Tacoma. Scenic Five-Mile Drive allows access to many of the park&#x27;s attractions, such as Owen Beach, Fort Nisqually, old growth forest trails, and the Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium (PDZA). There are many historic structures within the park, including the Pagoda, which was originally built as a streetcar waiting room. It was restored in 1988 and now serves as a rental facility for weddings and private parties. The Pagoda was nearly destroyed by fire on August 15, 2011. Repair work began immediately after the fire and continued until January 2013, at which time the Pagoda was reopened for public use.

Ruston Way is a waterfront area along Commencement Bay north of downtown Tacoma that hosts several public parks connected by a multi-use trail and interspersed with restaurants and other businesses. Public parks along Ruston Way include Jack Hyde Park, Old Town Dock, Hamilton Park, Dickman Mill Park, Les Davis Pier, Marine Park, and Cummings Park. The trail is used by walkers, runners, cyclists, and other recreationalists. There are several beaches along Ruston Way with public access, some of which are also popular for scuba diving.

Titlow Beach, at the end of 6th Avenue, is also a scuba diving area.

Wright Park, near downtown, is a large, English-style park designed in the late 19th century by Edward Otto Schwagerl and Ebenezer Rhys Roberts. It contains Wright Park Arboretum and the W. W. Seymour Botanical Conservatory. This historic park is also the home of local festivals such as Ethnic Fest, Out in the Park (Tacoma&#x27;s Pride festival), and the Tacoma Hempfest (Tacoma&#x27;s annual gathering advocating decriminalization of marijuana).

Jefferson Park in North Tacoma is the location of a new sprayground, an area designed to be a safe and unique play area where water is sprayed from structures or ground sprays and then drained away before it can accumulate.

Frost Park in downtown Tacoma is often utilized for sidewalk chalk contests. Don Pugnetti Park was the site of an Occupy Wall Street encampment.

==Architecture==
Tacoma includes several landmarks and was home to prolific architects, including Everett Phipps Babcock, Frederick Heath, Ambrose J. Russell, and Silas E. Nelsen.

Two suspension bridges span a narrow section of the Puget Sound called the Tacoma Narrows. The Tacoma Narrows Bridges link Tacoma to Gig Harbor and the Kitsap Peninsula. The failure of the first Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which was the third-longest suspension bridge in the world, is a famous case study in architecture textbooks.

===Historic landmarks===

Tacoma has many properties that are listed on the City of Tacoma Register of Historic Places, the Washington State Heritage Register, and the National Register of Historic Places.

The city of Tacoma has an active municipal historic preservation program, which includes 165 individual city landmarks and over 1,000 historic properties included within five locally regulated historic overlay zones.

&quot;Fireboat No. 1&quot; rests on a permanent dry berth at a public beach near Tacoma&#x27;s Old Town neighborhood. It was built in 1929 for the Port of Tacoma by the Coastline Shipbuilding Company, and served for 54 years in waterfront fire protection, harbor security patrols, search and rescue missions, and water pollution control. It is one of only five fireboats designated as a National Historic Landmark. Visitors are able to walk around her exterior, but her interior is closed to the public.

SOTA is a public school, part of the Tacoma Public Schools, and is one of the nation&#x27;s first schools to implement standards-based instruction, influencing the design of many schools in the nation. SOTA is in multiple venues around Downtown Tacoma and uses Community Museums and Universities for instructional space. In 2009, SOTA&#x27;s staff expanded to a second, STEM-based high school located in Point Defiance Park, the Science and Math Institute (SAMI). In 2017, the school district opened a third non-traditional high school in the same vein as SAMI and SOTA, called iDEA (Industrial Design, Engineering, and Art) in south Tacoma. SAMI and SOTA are the only schools in Tacoma to offer University of Washington in the Classroom college credit options from the University of Washington.

==Arts and culture==

The Tacoma city government adopted a percent for art ordinance in 1975 to allocate one percent of construction costs on major projects towards the commissioning or purchase of public artwork. The program was repealed in 1985 following controversy over the use of neon art in the Tacoma Dome. It was managed by the Tacoma Arts Commission and later a combined city–council arts commission, but was not enforced for most of its existence. By 1986, the city had 136 pieces of public artwork. The percent for art program was reinstated in March 2000.

==Mass media==
The city&#x27;s daily newspaper is &quot;The News Tribune&quot;, which has a circulation of about 85,000 (100,000 on Sundays), making it the state&#x27;s third-largest newspaper. &quot;The News Tribune&quot; was first published on June 17, 1918, as the result of a merger between two competing daily newspapers: &quot;The Daily News&quot;, started in 1883; and &quot;The Tacoma Daily Tribune&quot;, started in 1908. The newspaper remained under local ownership until 1986, when it was sold to McClatchy Newspapers. The E. W. Scripps Company published a competing daily, &quot;The Tacoma Times&quot;, from 1903 to 1949. Other local newspapers include the &quot;Tacoma Weekly&quot;, the legal paper &quot;Tacoma Daily Index&quot;, and the alternative newsweekly &quot;Weekly Volcano&quot;. The University of Washington Tacoma is served by &quot;The Ledger&quot;, a weekly student newspaper.

Tacoma&#x27;s media market is shared with Seattle. Four television stations are licensed to the city: KCPQ 13 (Fox), KSTW 11 (Independent), KTBW-TV 20 (TBN), and KWDK 56 (Daystar); with the exception of KSTW, all stations are owned-and-operated by their respective networks. Bates Technical College owns the city&#x27;s PBS member station, KBTC-TV 28, which serves as the market&#x27;s secondary PBS station. The city government also runs its own government-access television station, TV Tacoma, broadcasting its meetings and other local affairs.

Nine radio stations are licensed to Tacoma, with two AM stations and seven FM stations; the latter includes NPR affiliates KNKX and KVTI. KNKX was owned and operated by Pacific Lutheran University as KPLU-FM until 2016, when public outcry over a planned sale of the station to the University of Washington resulted in its transition to a community licensee instead; KVTI, owned by Clover Park Technical College, was run by college students until its operation was outsourced to Northwest Public Broadcasting of Washington State University in 2010. Another station involved in campus radio is KUPS, which is run by students at the University of Puget Sound.

==Sports==
The Tacoma Dome is the city&#x27;s main sports venue and opened in 1983. It hosts traveling sports and other events, such as pro-wrestling, figure-skating tours, and tours by the Harlem Globetrotters. For the 1994–95 season, the Tacoma Dome hosted home games of both the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Seattle SuperSonics (as the Seattle Center Coliseum was under renovation) and the American Professional Soccer League&#x27;s Seattle Sounders. The Tacoma Dome also hosted the 1988 and 1989 Women&#x27;s NCAA Final Four.

The city has hosted several now-defunct minor-league hockey franchises. The original Tacoma Rockets played in the Pacific Coast Hockey League from 1946 to 1953. &lt;section begin=&quot;resurrected_rockets&quot; /&gt;The Rockets were resurrected in the Western Hockey League in 1991 at the Tacoma Dome to record crowds, before moving to Kelowna, British Columbia in 1995. Filling this void, the Tacoma Sabercats formed in the now-defunct West Coast Hockey League in 1997&lt;section end=&quot;resurrected_rockets&quot; /&gt;, winning a title in 1999, and closed their doors in 2002 for financial reasons.

Cheney Stadium is home to the Tacoma Rainiers, a AAA minor league baseball team affiliated with the nearby Seattle Mariners since 1995. Minor-league baseball in the city began with the 1903–05 Tacoma Tigers of the then-independent Pacific Coast League (PCL), who were resurrected in the Western International League and played from 1922 until 1951, winning three titles. Following the construction of Cheney Stadium, the Tacoma Giants returned to the PCL in 1960 and were later renamed to the Rainiers. Both the Tacoma Dome and Cheney Stadium hosted events during the 1990 Goodwill Games, an international multi-sport competition.

Tacoma has also had a long history with soccer. In men&#x27;s outdoor soccer, the city is currently represented in the third-division MLS Next Pro by the Tacoma Defiance, reserve team of MLS&#x27;s Seattle Sounders FC. The Defiance were founded in 2015 in the USL Championship in nearby Tukwila, Washington, but have been operated jointly with the Rainiers out of Cheney Stadium since 2019. The city&#x27;s first professional soccer team were the Tacoma Tides, who played one season in 1976 in the American Soccer League. This team was resurrected in 2006 as the Tacoma Tide in the USL PDL, playing primarily in nearby Sumner, Washington. The Tide were folded into the Sounders organization as their U-23 team in 2012, and played until folding in 2019.

In women&#x27;s outdoor soccer, Reign FC of the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League played their home games at Cheney Stadium during the 2019, 2020, and 2021 seasons. The Reign considered plans to build a soccer-specific stadium in Tacoma, but ultimately returned to Seattle in 2022.

In 1983, Tacoma&#x27;s entry into indoor soccer, the Tacoma Stars, began play in the Tacoma Dome as part of the Major Indoor Soccer League. The original Stars folded in 1992, but were reformed in 2003 in the Professional Arena Soccer League. Since 2015, the new Stars have played in the Major Arena Soccer League at the ShoWare Center in nearby Kent, Washington.

Tacoma is home to the all-female flat track roller derby league Dockyard Derby Dames, which fields an away team. Many golf clubs and courses are located in Tacoma including Lake Spanaway Golf Course.

==Transportation==

Tacoma&#x27;s system of transportation is based primarily on the automobile. The majority of the city has a system of gridded streets oriented in relation to A Street (one block east of Pacific Avenue) and 6th Avenue or Division Avenue, both beginning in downtown Tacoma. Within the city, and with a few exceptions, east-to-west streets are numbered and north-to-south streets are given a name or a letter. Some east-to-west streets are also given names, such as S. Center St. and N. Westgate Blvd. Streets are generally labeled &quot;North&quot;, &quot;South&quot;, &quot;East&quot;, or &quot;North East&quot; according to their relationship with 6th Avenue or Division Avenue (west of &#x27;Division Ave&#x27;, &#x27;6th Avenue&#x27; is the lowest-numbered street, making it the dividing street between &quot;North&quot; and &quot;South&quot;), &#x27;A Street&#x27; (which is the dividing line between &quot;East&quot; and &quot;South&quot;), or 1st Street NE (which is the dividing line between &quot;East&quot; and &quot;North East&quot;). This can lead to confusion, as most named streets intersect streets of the same number in both north and south Tacoma. For example, the intersection of South 11th Street and South Union Avenue is just ten blocks south of North 11th Street and North Union Avenue.

To the east of the Thea Foss waterway and &#x27;A Street&#x27;, streets are similarly divided into &quot;East&quot; and &quot;Northeast&quot;, with 1st Street NE being in-line with the Pierce–King county line. &quot;North East&quot; covers a small wedge of Tacoma and unincorporated Pierce County (around Browns Point and Dash Point) lying on the hill across the tideflats from downtown. Tacoma does have some major roads which do not seem to follow any naming rules. These roads include Schuster Pkwy, Pacific Ave, Puyallup Ave, Tacoma Mall Blvd, Marine View Dr (SR 509), and Northshore Pkwy. Tacoma also has some major roads which appear to change names in different areas (most notable are Tyler St/Stevens St, Oakes St/Pine St/Cedar St/Alder St, and S. 72nd St/S. 74th St). These major arterials actually shift over to align with other roads, which causes them to have the name changed.

This numeric system extends to the furthest reaches of unincorporated Pierce County (with roads outside of the city carrying &quot;East&quot;, &quot;West&quot;, &quot;North West&quot;, and &quot;South West&quot;, except on the Key Peninsula, which retains the north–south streets but chooses the Pierce–Kitsap county line as the zero point for east–west streets. Until 2018, Key Peninsula&#x27;s roads also carried a &quot;KP N&quot; or &quot;KP S&quot; (&quot;Key Peninsula North&quot; or &quot;Key Peninsula South&quot;) designation at the end of the street name. From 2018, these designations have switched to &quot;NW&quot; and &quot;SW&quot; respectively.

In portions of the city dating back to the Tacoma Streetcar Period (1888–1938), denser mixed-use business districts exist alongside single family homes. Twelve such districts have active, city-recognized business associations and hold &quot;small town&quot;-style parades and other festivals. The Proctor District, Tacoma, Old Town, Dome, 6th Avenue, Stadium, Lincoln Business District, and South Tacoma Business Districts are some of the more prominent of these and coordinate their efforts to redevelop urban villages through the Cross District Association of Tacoma. In newer portions of the city to the west and south, residential culs-de-sac, four-lane collector roads and indoor shopping centers are more commonplace.

===Roads and highways===
Seven highways end in or pass through Tacoma: I-5, I-705, SR 7, SR 16, SR 163, SR 167, and SR 509.

The dominant intercity transportation link between Tacoma and other parts of the Puget Sound is Interstate 5, which links Tacoma with Seattle to the north and Portland, Oregon, to the south. It bisects the city for and has several overpasses for pedestrians and cross-traffic. State Route 16 runs along a concrete viaduct through Tacoma&#x27;s Nalley Valley, connecting Interstate 5 with Central and West Tacoma, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, and the Kitsap Peninsula.

===Aviation===
Seattle–Tacoma International Airport lies north, in the city of SeaTac. The city of Tacoma contributed $100,000 to the airport&#x27;s construction, in return for it being constructed at Bow Lake. The other proposed location near Lake Sammamish is much further from Tacoma, while Bow Lake is halfway between Seattle and Tacoma.

A seaplane service with tours of the Tacoma area is operated by Kenmore Air from a dock near Old Town. It was started in August 2023 as part of a partnership with the Puyallup Tribe of Indians; Kenmore also plans to offer flights from the dock to other destinations in the region.

===Public transportation===
Tacoma has a public transportation network that includes buses, commuter rail, light rail, and ferries. Public bus service is primarily provided by Pierce Transit, which serves Tacoma and most of urban Pierce County. Pierce Transit operates 38 bus routes using a fleet of more than 200 buses powered by compressed natural gas, diesel, and electric batteries. Bus service generally operates at 30–60 minute frequencies on weekdays; prior to service cuts in 2021, several trunk routes had service every 15 to 20 minutes on weekdays. The busiest Pierce Transit bus route, serving the Pacific Avenue corridor, was planned to be upgraded into a bus rapid transit line by 2022, at a cost of $150 million. Significant cost increases during the COVID-19 pandemic caused Pierce Transit to pause the construction of the bus rapid transit line, named the Stream Community Line, and instead launch a limited-stop &quot;enhanced bus&quot; on the corridor in 2024.

The city&#x27;s main train and bus station is Tacoma Dome Station, a multimodal hub near the Tacoma Dome southeast of downtown. The station is also served by Sounder commuter rail trains to Seattle and intercity Amtrak trains on both the &quot;Cascades&quot; and &quot;Coast Starlight&quot;. Sound Transit, the regional transit authority, operates Sounder, the T Line (part of the Link light rail system), and daily Sound Transit Express bus service to and from Seattle. The T Line connects Tacoma Dome Station to Downtown Tacoma, the University of Washington campus, and the Hilltop neighborhood. Sound Transit plans to extend the Tacoma Link light rail further west towards Tacoma Community College along South 19th Street by 2039 or 2041.

The Washington State Ferries system, which has a dock at Point Defiance, provides automobile ferry access to Tahlequah at the southern tip of Vashon Island. Proposals for a passenger-only ferry linking Downtown Tacoma to Seattle have been studied since the 2010s but remain unrealized.

==Public utilities==
Tacoma&#x27;s relationship with public utilities extends back to 1893. At that time the city was undergoing a boom in population, causing it to exceed the available amount of fresh water supplied by Charles B. Wright&#x27;s Tacoma Light &amp; Water Company. In response to both this demand and a growing desire to have local public control over the utility system, the city council put up a public vote to acquire and expand the private utility. The measure passed on July 1, 1893, with 3,195 in favor of acquiring the utility system and 1,956 voting against. Since then, Tacoma Public Utilities (TPU) has grown from a small water and light utility to be the largest department in the city&#x27;s government, employing about 1,200 people.

Tacoma Power, a division of TPU, provides residents of Tacoma and several bordering municipalities with electrical power generated by eight hydroelectric dams on the Skokomish River and elsewhere. Environmentalists, fishermen, and the Skokomish Indian Tribe have criticized TPU&#x27;s operation of Cushman Dam on the North Fork of the Skokomish River; the tribe&#x27;s $6 billion claim was denied by the U.S. Supreme court in January 2006. The capacity of Tacoma&#x27;s hydroelectric system as of 2004 was 713,000 kilowatts, or about 50% of the demand made up by TPU&#x27;s customers (the rest is purchased from other utilities). According to TPU, hydroelectricity provides about 87% of Tacoma&#x27;s power; coal 3%; natural gas 1%; nuclear 9%; and biomass and wind at less than 1%. Tacoma Power also operates the Click! Network, a municipally owned cable television and internet service. The residential cost per kilowatt hour of electricity is just over 6 cents.

Tacoma Water provides customers in its service area with water from the Green River Watershed. As of 2004, Tacoma Water provided water services to 93,903 customers. The average annual cost for residential supply was $257.84.

Tacoma Rail, initially a municipally owned street railway line running to the tideflats, was converted to a common-carrier rail switching utility. Tacoma Rail is self-supporting and employs over 90 people.

In addition to municipal garbage collection, Tacoma offers commingled recycling services for paper, cardboard, plastics, and metals.

<text>University Place is a city in Pierce County, Washington, United States. Its population was 34,866 at the 2020 census.

Based on per capita income, University Place ranks 81st of 522 areas in the state of Washington to be ranked.

==History==
University Place received its name in the 1800s when the University of Puget Sound, a private liberal-arts college in North Tacoma, purchased land along the primary north–south route of Grandview Drive. The school sought to build a new campus there, but ended up selling the land back to the city for about $11,000. University Place remained an unincorporated part of Pierce County until the City of University Place was formed on August 31, 1995.

Today, University Place is largely suburban in character and functions as a mixed business and residential area with waterfront on the Puget Sound. The town is home to Curtis Senior High School and Charles Wright Academy.

Chambers Bay golf course opened in 2007 to favorable reviews. A Scottish links-style course, Chambers Bay hosted the 2010 U.S. Amateur and the 2015 U.S. Open.

University Place&#x27;s news is primarily covered by &quot;The News Tribune&quot; (Tacoma), and is also covered by University Place Patch, a hyper-local news website that launched in October 2010, and sometimes by news media in Seattle. Earlier newspapers for the community were the weekly Suburban Times (1970s), published by Dave Sclair (who, starting in 1970, also published Western Flyer); and, in the 1980s, the Lakewood Press, published by Grace T. Eubanks and later Dane S. Claussen, which launched the University Place Press as a monthly and then biweekly before it folded in early 1989.

==History==
Settlers searching for coal arrived in the area that became Wilkeson in the 1870s. By 1877, a Northern Pacific Railway line transported coal to Tacoma. Northern Pacific Railway president Henry Villard hired geologist Bailey Willis to direct field explorations of the coal fields around Wilkeson. Much of the property of Wilkeson was purchased by Northern Pacific Railway, with the remaining part of town known as Hope. In 1885, coke ovens were built by the Wilkeson Coal and Coke Company. In addition to coal, Wilkeson shipped timber and sandstone across Washington.

Wilkeson was officially incorporated on July 18, 1909. The town is named for Samuel Wilkeson, father of journalist and pioneer settler Frank Wilkeson.

Although it was known as a ghost town for a time, people began moving to Wilkeson in the late 20th century, many who commute to Enumclaw, Bellevue, and Seattle for work. Town improvements are paid for by a 160-acre tree farm managed by the town. Its new sewage treatment plant includes 900 feet of sewer lines replaced by volunteers.

<text>Friday Harbor is a town in San Juan County, Washington, United States. The population was 2,613 at the 2020 census. Located on San Juan Island, Friday Harbor is the major commercial center of the San Juan Islands archipelago and is the county seat of San Juan County.

==History==

In 1845 the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company laid claim to San Juan Island. In 1850 they built a salmon curing station. A few years later they started a sheep farm.

The town&#x27;s name originates from Joseph Poalie Friday, a native Hawaiian. Friday worked at the Pugets Sound Agricultural Company&#x27;s Fort Cowlitz, from 1841 to 1859–60 and later moved north to San Juan Island, raising and herding sheep around the harbor.

After the peaceful settlement obtained following the Pig War, the San Juan Islands became a separate county in 1873. Friday Harbor was named the county seat. Friday Harbor was officially incorporated on February 10, 1909. It remains the only incorporated town in the San Juan Islands.

Sailing ships, and later, the steamships of the Puget Sound Mosquito Fleet, visited the harbor on a regular basis hauling passengers, mail and freight. Freight from the island would include apples, pears, cherries, strawberries, peas, cream, eggs, chickens, grain, salmon, and lime. All were produced on or around San Juan Island. The Great Depression, World War II, the pea weevil, and competition from Eastern Washington growers brought about the decline of traditional island industries, diminishing Friday Harbor&#x27;s export trade. The 1970s brought new industries - tourism, retirement, real estate, and construction. Today, Friday Harbor is again busy and prosperous.

Osamu Shimomura harvested jellyfish from the docks of the harbor. Eventually he purified the proteins that allow the jellyfish to fluoresce green when exposed to blue light. One of them, green fluorescent protein, is now widely used as a marker of molecular activity.

==Geography and climate==

Friday Harbor is located on the east side of San Juan Island facing the San Juan Channel. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

<text>Anacortes ( ) is a city in Skagit County, Washington, United States. The name &quot;Anacortes&quot; is an adaptation of the name of Anne Curtis Bowman, who was the wife of early Fidalgo Island settler Amos Bowman. Anacortes&#x27; population was 17,637 at the time of the 2020 census. It is one of two principal cities of and included in the Mount Vernon-Anacortes Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Anacortes is known for the Washington State Ferries dock and terminal serving Lopez Island, Shaw Island, Orcas Island, and San Juan Island. There is also a Skagit County-operated ferry that serves Guemes Island, a residential island located across Guemes Channel, north of Anacortes.

==History==
Anacortes is within the historical territory of the Samish people. Anacortes was officially incorporated on May 19, 1891.

In 1877, railroad surveyor and town founder Amos Bowman moved his family to the northern tip of Fidalgo Island. Bowman began promoting the area as an obvious terminus for the Northern Pacific Railway as it was built through the north Cascades to the Pacific. Bowman established the town&#x27;s first newspaper, The Northwest Enterprise, to promote his vision of the New York of the West.

Seattle and Northern Company began building a rail line from the town in 1888. Real estate and development boomed from 1888 to 1890 as a result of the railroad rumors, and the Oregon Improvement Company posted $15 million in bonds to develop the town.

In 1891, the real estate bubble burst. Speculators lost money and the Oregon Improvement Company could no longer afford to complete tracks over the Cascades. The town failed to become the railroad terminus Bowman had envisioned.

After the bust, the town became prominent for its fishing tradition, thriving canning industry, and timber mills.

==Description==
Anacortes is on Fidalgo Island. Rosario Strait and the San Juan Islands are to the West while to the South, Deception Pass separates Fidalgo and Whidbey Islands. To the East, the Swinomish Channel separates Fidalgo Island from the mainland. The weather is milder than other areas of the Pacific Northwest, because it lies within the Olympic Mountain rain shadow. Fidalgo Island gets 21 inches of rain per year, only half as much as Seattle.

First known as Ship Harbor, Anacortes was established with a name and a post office in 1879 in the vain hope that it would be selected as the western terminus of the transcontinental railroad. The town was officially incorporated in 1891 shortly after the railroad bust, and became a lumber and fishing center.
In the 1950s, oil companies built big refineries near Anacortes. Two of the five refineries operating in Washington are located near the town. One is owned and operated by Marathon Petroleum (opened in 1955, it was originally built and owned by Shell Oil and later operated by Andeavor [formerly Tesoro]), operating as the Marathon Anacortes Refinery, the other was owned and operated by Shell Puget Sound Refinery Company (opening in 1957, and originally built and owned by Texaco). However, HollyFrontier has now bought the refinery. Refining remains the area&#x27;s largest industry, but the economic base now includes yacht construction/shipbuilding, tourism.

==Government==
Anacortes has a mayor–council government with an elected mayor and seven city councilmembers, of whom three are elected from single member wards. The remaining four are elected at-large.

The city government operates a municipal broadband system that began operation as a pilot in late 2019 and will expand to the entire city in 2023.

==Recreation and tourism==

Anacortes is a popular destination for boaters and those traveling on to the San Juan Islands. The city maintains a city park on the northwestern end of Fidalgo Island named &quot;Washington Park&quot;. This park features camping, boat launching, and views of the San Juan Islands. The most prominent view is of Cypress Island.
As a result of Anacortes&#x27; proximity to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the area provides opportunities for whale-watching. The waters off of Anacortes and Fidalgo Island are home to several varieties of marine-life, including three resident Orca pods.

Anacortes Community Forest Lands, with of mountain biking and hiking trails, are a valuable amenity in a city the size of Anacortes. In adjacent Mount Erie Park, a number of rock climbing routes are popular on the cliffs of the south and west faces of Mount Erie. Mount Erie offers scenic vistas from its 1273-foot peak.

Anacortes hosts many long-distance cyclists, as it is the western terminus of the Adventure Cycling Association&#x27;s Northern Tier cross-country bicycle route, which ends in Bar Harbor, Maine.

==Festivals and celebrations==
*&quot;Shipwreck Day&quot; is a single-day, flea market/town garage sale event held annually on the 3rd Saturday in July. City management accommodates the occasion by blocking off several downtown streets.
*What the Heck Fest was an annual festival coinciding with Shipwreck Day. It began in 2001 and held its last festival in 2019. The festival took place at various locations in Anacortes a week in the middle of July. Performers presented music, movies, literature, and art. The thematic center of the festival is the dinner show that includes a full meal along with the concert, an actual community event.
*The first weekend of August hosts the Anacortes Arts Festival. Started in 1962 as the result of the efforts of a group of community arts patrons, the festival is held in the midst of blocked-off downtown main street areas. Vendors, merchants, and artisans present their wares in covered booths while jazz and blues musicians are showcased on four different stages.
*The Oyster Run is an annual one day motorcycle rally held on the fourth Sunday of September. Beginning in 1981, the event has grown into the largest rally in the Pacific Northwest, with an estimated motorcycle count of 15000 bikes, and growing in numbers each year.

<text>Concrete is a town in north-central Skagit County, Washington, United States. It is part of the Mount Vernon-Anacortes, Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area, and had a population of 801 at the 2020 census.

==Early history==

The town of Concrete has undergone several incarnations, the earliest being a settlement at the northwestern junction of the Baker and Skagit Rivers, known as &quot;Minnehaha.&quot; Amasa &quot;Peg-Leg&quot; Everett was one of the earliest settlers and in 1890, the townsite was platted by another settler, Magnus Miller. Shortly thereafter, a post office was established and the town name changed to &quot;Baker.&quot; In 1905, a settlement across the Baker River came into being due to the building of the Washington Portland Cement Company and was named &quot;Cement City.&quot; After the Superior Portland Cement Company plant was built in Baker in 1908, it was decided to merge the two towns. Inhabitants of the new community settled on the name &quot;Concrete&quot; and the town was so christened and officially incorporated on May 8, 1909.

==Notable buildings and landmarks==
Concrete is home to a number of historic buildings and engineering milestones.

===Henry Thompson Bridge===

Built in 1916–1918 and so named for the Scottish immigrant, local settler, and Skagit County Commissioner who promoted its construction. The naming occurred after Henry Thompson was killed by a logging train in 1918. At the time, its graceful arch was the longest single-span reinforced concrete bridge in the world or perhaps just in the West and has been listed on the Washington State and National Historic Register since 1976. Until 1972, when the Washington State Department of Transportation re-routed Highway 20 (then known as Star Route 20) outside the town, the Thompson Bridge was the only connecting thoroughfare across the Baker River and into eastern Skagit County.

The bridge was originally designed by Bowerman and McCloy Consulting Engineers and built by J.R. Wood Contractors (both of Seattle). It underwent a complete rehabilitation in 2003-2004. The engineer for the rehabilitation was Entranco, Inc. of Bellevue (who has since been acquired by AECOM) and the contractor for the rehabilitation was One Way Construction of Sedro-Woolley.

===Concrete High School===

Concrete High School was built in 1952. Constructed with the typical and necessary scholastic appointments and one visible and unusual difference: the central portion of the building was built over the road leading to it. To make the best use of the property, South Superior Avenue passes beneath the building. The building replaced the previous high school building in the center of town. The hallways and the wood shop were used during the filming of the Michael Caton-Jones film, &quot;This Boy&#x27;s Life&quot; in 1993. Concrete High School&#x27;s school colors are purple and gold and their team mascot is the Lion. CHS&#x27;s sports teams participate in the Northwest 1B/2B league under the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association. Concrete&#x27;s Future Business Leaders of America was the fastest growing in the state during the 2012-13 school year.

===&quot;Concrete Herald&quot; building===
Located in the heart of Concrete Town Center on Main Street, the Concrete Herald Building was originally built in 1918 as a Model T Ford garage complete with a gas-station out front. When the building was later converted to be the Brommer Logging facility, a large apartment was added to the upper story. It was shortly after this that &quot;Concrete Herald&quot; owner and editor Charles M. &quot;Chuck&quot; Dwelley took over the building and made it into a modern printing facility and new home of &quot;The Concrete Herald&quot; (established in 1910). When Robert and June Fader purchased the newspaper upon Dwelley&#x27;s retirement in late 1970, the building remained the home for the weekly. When the building and newspaper were sold in 1990, the facility became a printing shop until the current owners turned the first floor into a liquor store franchise through the state liquor control board. The Concrete Herald Building has remained a liquor store to this date. As for &quot;Concrete Herald&quot;, Concrete Mayor Jason Miller has given rebirth to the newspaper after purchasing the &quot;Upriver Community News&quot; from another local resident. As of May 6, 2009, &quot;Concrete Herald&quot; began a monthly publication schedule. The newspaper is sold in various locations throughout Skagit County.

===Town Hall===

Originally built in 1908 as a grade-school, this wooden, clapboard building was originally located on Main Street across from the bank where classes were taught until 1910. When the building was no longer used as a schoolhouse, it was moved to its present location on West Main Street, next to the current post office. In its present location, the building has served alternately as a library, senior-citizen center, the city&#x27;s current town hall with a satellite office for the Skagit County Sheriff&#x27;s Department.

===Concrete Theatre===
Originally built in 1923, the stage of the Concrete Theatre has entertained audiences with vaudeville, boxing matches, silent films and later what were known as &quot;the talkies&quot;. The building is listed on the Washington Heritage Register Over the decades, the theatre changed hands many times but retained its original layout as a one-screen movie theatre. In 2009, it was purchased by new owners and refurbished. The venue now seats 130, has a full stage and dance floor, and a refurbished balcony that seats 8. In 2012, the community helped raise funds to purchase a digital projector to keep the theatre alive. In 2021, the Concrete Theatre expanded by purchasing the building next door. Originally the Monrad Grocery built in 1915, the expanded space now features an ice cream parlor, as well as the theatre box office and an additional meeting/screening room.

===Lower Baker Dam===

At the time Lower Baker Dam was completed in 1925 and two years later raised to , it was the highest hydroelectric dam in the world. It is currently owned, operated, and maintained by Puget Sound Energy.

Author Tobias Wolff spent a large part of his teenage years in the Concrete area. Wolff&#x27;s memoir &quot;This Boy&#x27;s Life&quot; chronicles his early life living in eastern Skagit County and attending Concrete High School (referred to as &quot;Chinook High School&quot; in the novel). In 1993, the novel was also turned into a feature film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Ellen Barkin. The movie&#x27;s exterior scenes of Concrete (as well as some interior scenes) were filmed in the town of Concrete and the surrounding area and a number of local residents were used as extras. In order to fit the &quot;look&quot; of 1950s-era Concrete, the town itself was transformed back in time &quot;Hollywood style&quot; for the weeks that filming took place in 1992.

The socialist colony was established on 280 acres just outside Edison and it engaged in farming and timber milling and included a school as well as blacksmith and copper-working shops. The Edison-based Brotherhood also published a newspaper called &quot;Industrial Freedom&quot; for national circulation to its approximately 3,000 supporters. The socialist community folded shortly after 1903, by which time only about 100 colony members remained.

<text>Hamilton is a town in Skagit County, Washington, United States. The population was 299 at the 2020 census. It is included in the Mount Vernon-Anacortes, Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Hamilton was first settled in 1877 by William Hamilton, and was later named for him when Hamilton was officially incorporated on March 19, 1891.

The town was flooded by the Skagit River in November 2021. The local post office was deemed uninhabitable due to damage from the floods and shut down despite repairs to the building.

===Flooding===

As part of the Skagit River floodway, the town of Hamilton faces significant flooding every few years, most notably in 2003, 2006, 2017, and 2021. The frequent flooding has forced residents to adopt a routine of moving their furniture from the ground floor and evacuating to a local church until the waters recede. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) estimates it has spent $4.6 million in the town over the last several years.

Support has been building for a plan to move the entire town to a nearby hill. The Hamilton Public Development Authority was established in 2004 to purchase the land necessary for moving the town, which was achieved with assistance from conservation group Forterra in 2018. Forterra purchased a farm north of State Route 20, which it aims to develop into a green city with housing for the relocated townspeople.

<text>La Conner is a town in Skagit County, Washington, United States with a population of 965 at the 2020 census. It is included in the Mount Vernon–Anacortes, Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
La Conner was first settled in May 1867 by Alonzo Low and was then known by its post office name, Swinomish. Its location on the Swinomish channel was an ideal safe harbor for ships. In 1869, J.S. Conner bought the settlement&#x27;s trading post and in 1870 had the name changed to honor his wife, Louisa Ann Conner. The French-appearing &quot;La&quot; represented her first and middle initials. When Skagit County was created out of Whatcom County in 1883, La Conner was chosen as the county seat, but would only hold that designation until November 1884 when the seat was moved to Mount Vernon.

In early 2020, nine businesses in downtown La Conner announced their closures—mostly attributed to lost revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic and from the cancellation of the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival.

The Museum of Northwest Art showcases a permanent collection of northwest artists and revolving shows throughout the year. The town is also home to the Skagit Historical Museum, with perhaps the best view in town, and the Quilt Museum, located in one of the oldest homes in town, the Gaches Mansion.

The town of La Conner is home to several fine art galleries, including La Conner Seaside Gallery, Forum Arts, Earthenworks, and Alek&#x27;s Art Studio. Visual artists, painters, and photographers have also worked from spaces in and around La Conner, including Northwest School members Guy Anderson, Morris Graves, and Richard Gilkey. Fishtown, an informal artists&#x27; community housed in a cluster of old cabins and fishing shacks on the north fork of the Skagit River delta, housed many artists from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s.

Also famous for its many feral domestic turkeys, the town named the turkey as their &quot;Official Town Bird in 2005&quot;. On August 8, 2006; however, a debate was heard in town council about whether the birds should be removed because of nuisance complaints about noise, fecal matter, and ingestion of garden materials. As of October 2010, the town council declared the turkeys to be a nuisance and has since taken action to have them removed from the town limits.

La Conner&#x27;s public library, which is run by the town government and serves residents of the local school district, opened on November 26, 1993, at a former storefront. Plans to construct a permanent library were announced in 2012 with a ten-year fundraising campaign. Construction on the new library began in October 2021 and was completed the following year at a cost of $5 million. The building opened on October 18, 2022, and includes community spaces, a rooftop solar array, and signage in English, Spanish, Braille, and Lushootseed.

<text>Mount Vernon is the county seat of and the most populous city in Skagit County, Washington, United States. A central location in the Skagit River Valley, the city is located south of the U.S.–Canada border and north of Seattle. The population was 35,219 at the 2020 census, making it the 35th most-populous city in Washington, with 62,966 people living in its urban area. It is one of two principal cities of and included in the Mount Vernon-Anacortes, Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area, covering most of Skagit County.

Mount Vernon and its surrounding areas is known for its annual Skagit Valley Tulip Festival, which has Mount Vernon host a street fair in downtown once a year, with millions of tulips grown in the Skagit Valley every year. Between the 2000 and 2020 census, Mount Vernon grew by 34.3%, and is a prominent location in Northwestern Washington, connected to neighboring communities via Interstate 5 and Amtrak (with Skagit Station).

==History==

===Early days===

Jasper Gates and Joseph Dwelley first settled on the banks of the Skagit River, where the city of Mount Vernon now lies, in 1870. Later on, Harrison Clothier came to the community in 1877 to teach school and join in business with a former student, E.G. English. They were later recognized as the city&#x27;s founders and pioneer businessmen. A post office was established in November 1877 with Clothier appointed postmaster. The city was named after Mount Vernon, the plantation estate and resting place of George Washington. The two men laid out the city&#x27;s first plan while the area was still heavily timbered.

Mount Vernon&#x27;s first industry was logging; camps were set up to log the townsite. The community grew quickly following the loggers, and hotels and saloons opened up along the Skagit River next to English &amp; Clothiers&#x27; store. While poised to grow, river access to the community was stymied by a massive and ancient log jam in the river which prevented large ships from being able to port. Mail carriers instead had to paddle canoes down-stream to nearby Skagit City which enjoyed a brief period of prosperity thanks to this obstacle. The mining activity at nearby Ruby Creek spurred growth for a short time in 1880, gaining the city a new hotel, but little else was accomplished when the mines proved to be shallow. More logging operations were established but were not profitable due to the low price of logs at the time. By 1881, Mount Vernon&#x27;s permanent population was a modest 75.

Growth in the 1880s was steady. In 1882, the Odd Fellows Lodge was established, followed by the first newspaper in 1884, &quot;The Skagit News&quot;. The first church, Baptist, was also established in 1884 but would not build a permanent building for several years. In November 1884, Mount Vernon&#x27;s future was secured when it was chosen for the new Skagit County seat, taking the designation from La Conner. The Odd fellows building, built the following year, served the county&#x27;s needs until a permanent building was built.

===Railroad and growth into the 20th century===
Mount Vernon&#x27;s growth was helped by its central location in reference to the mining, logging and farming communities of the eastern and central parts of the county as well as its access to Puget Sound. The only thing it was lacking was a railroad connection to the outside world, especially, Everett, Seattle and Vancouver, B.C. A committee was appointed in 1889 to negotiate with railroads on line placement. Their efforts paid off when the Great Northern Railway agreed to lay their line through the city. This was completed in 1891. The city was also in the process of convincing the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway to come to Mt. Vernon. This deal fell through after the railroad was acquired by Northern Pacific Railway who chose to lay tracks further east through Sedro-Woolley in 1896.

The railroad&#x27;s arrival caused great commotion in Mount Vernon, bringing hundreds of new businesses and residents. Mount Vernon was officially incorporated on July 5, 1893. That same year, a large brick courthouse was built on Main street, which still stands today. Due to the area&#x27;s stable economy, Mount Vernon never boomed in the 1890s like many other speculative settlements in the region, all vying for a railroad terminus. The city experienced its first of many fires in 1891 when several blocks along the waterfront were destroyed. The same year the city&#x27;s riverfront eroded taking away Front Street and the west side of Main Street. The boost from the railroad&#x27;s construction quickly replaced these buildings. 1891 also saw the construction of several large civic structures such as a large brick schoolhouse on the hill above the city as well as the Mount Vernon Opera House, designed by Peacock &amp; Dalton.

Growth slowed considerably after the Panic of 1893. Following a large flood in 1894, the first dike was built along the Skagit River. Another great fire in 1900 wiped out all of Mount Vernon&#x27;s original structures including English &amp; Clothiers&#x27; store and the Ruby Hotel. Fire would destroy more downtown businesses in 1903. The city finally received a water system in 1902 after a failed attempt in 1894.

===Later events and transportation===
The city again grew in the 1910s when it became the southern terminus for the Bellingham &amp; Skagit Railway&#x27;s interurban railroad line, which would carry passengers as well as freight between Bellingham and Mount Vernon as well as Burlington and Sedro-Woolley. The line opened on August 31, 1912, with passenger trips to Bellingham every two hours during the day and freight operating at night. Mount Vernon business owners soon began pressuring the railway company, since renamed the Pacific Northwest Traction Company, to extend the rails south to connect with the interurban line in Everett. Plagued by a weakening economy, the onset of America&#x27;s entrance into World War I in 1917, and numerous infrastructure failures that led to line closures for months at a time, extension of the interurban was put off indefinitely. The completion of the Pacific Highway between Seattle and Bellingham in 1920 posed a great threat to the still incomplete interurban line. After a series of accidents and bridge wash outs, passenger service on the money-losing line was permanently suspended in June 1930. In 1969, Interstate 5 was built through downtown, severing it from most of the residential district and opening the farm lands north of the city to urban development, where many of Mount Vernon&#x27;s downtown businesses moved.

==Culture==

The Historic Lincoln Theatre on First Street in downtown Mount Vernon was originally built in 1926 as a vaudeville and silent movie house. Through the early 1980s, the Lincoln was a movie theater showing first-run films and now hosts live theatrical performances and concerts while also showcasing classic, as well as contemporary, movies year-round. The Lincoln is one of only 98 theaters in the United States that still possesses its original Wurlitzer theatre organ, which is often played prior to a show.

In addition, the Skagit Symphony resides in the area.

The city&#x27;s public library was relocated to a new multi-use community center that opened in September 2024 at a cost of $56 million. The Mount Vernon Library Commons includes meeting spaces, a community center with a commercial kitchen, and a three-story parking garage with 275 stalls. The garage includes the largest municipally-owned electric vehicle charging station in the United States with 76 stalls and several charging lockers for electric bicycles.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

===Climate===
Like much of the Pacific Northwest, according to the Köppen climate classification, Mount Vernon falls within a cool dry-summer subtropical zone (Csb), with &quot;cool&quot;-summer Mediterranean characteristics. Other sources classify it as belonging in the marine west coast climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;) zone, with cool, wet winters and warm, distinctly drier summers.
==Flood control and waterfront redevelopment==

Since this city was founded, the downtown area of Mount Vernon bordering the Skagit River has been plagued by flooding, especially during times of heavy rain. Historically, each time the water rose above a certain level, citizens had to work together to build a sandbag wall stretching six city blocks and as high as .

In the spring of 2007, the city council authorized the mayor to purchase a mobile flood wall from Norway-based company AquaFence, the first such flood wall sold in the United States. The flood wall is high and can be assembled in as little as three hours by a handful of volunteers as opposed to the up to 12 hours and hundreds of volunteers required by the traditional sandbag wall.

A permanent flood wall was completed in 2019.

After adequate flood control is in place, a Citizens&#x27; Advisory Committee plans to enhance the city&#x27;s use of the revetment, which is currently used mostly for parking and a seasonal farmer&#x27;s market. Current plans call for a promenade with condos or mixed-use development facing the river. A two- or three-story parking garage is planned to replace the revetment parking lost due to development. During Thanksgiving 2017 the city, as well as Lyman and Hamilton, experienced flooding; and again on November 15, 2021.

==Transportation==
Mount Vernon&#x27;s main transportation hub is Skagit Station, built in 2004, which is served by Amtrak and bus operators. Commuters and travelers can switch between modes of transportation in downtown Mount Vernon. The station offers stops for Skagit Transit buses, Greyhound bus, Amtrak Cascades rail and local taxis. Skagit Transit operates a commuter bus to Everett Station that connects with the Sounder commuter train to Seattle.

Skagit Regional Airport, northwest, fills much of the area&#x27;s general aviation needs. It has service on two cargo airlines. The closest commercial airport with scheduled passenger service is Bellingham International Airport, north.

<text>Sedro-Woolley ( ) is a city in Skagit County, Washington, United States. It is part of the Mount Vernon–Anacortes, Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area and had a population of 12,421 at the 2020 census. The city is home to the administrative offices of North Cascades National Park, which lies east of Sedro-Woolley on State Route 20.

==History==

Incorporated on December 19, 1898, Sedro-Woolley was formed from neighboring rival towns of Sedro (once known as Bug) and Woolley in Skagit County, northwestern Washington, inland from the Puget Sound, south of the border with Canada and north of Seattle.

Four British bachelors, led by David Batey, homesteaded the area in 1878, the time logjam obstructions were cleared downriver at the site of Mount Vernon. In 1884–85, Batey built a store and home for the Mortimer Cook family from Santa Barbara, California where Cook had been mayor for two terms. Cook intended to name his new Pacific Northwest town Bug due to the number of mosquitos present, but his wife protested along with a handful of other local wives. Cook was already the namesake for the town Cook&#x27;s Ferry on the Thompson River in British Columbia. With &quot;Bug&quot; being so unpopular, Cook derived a town name from Spanish; knowing &quot;cedro&quot; was the word for cedar, he replaced one letter to make the name unique, settling on &quot;Sedro&quot;.

Sedro, on the northern banks of the Skagit River, proved susceptible to floods. In 1889, Northern Pacific Railway developer Nelson Bennett began laying track from the town of Fairhaven, northwest on Bellingham Bay, and real estate developer Norman R. Kelley platted a new town of Sedro on high ground a mile northwest of Cook&#x27;s site. The Fairhaven and Southern Railroad arrived in Sedro on Christmas Eve, 1889, in time for Bennett to receive a performance bonus from the towns at both ends, and a month after Washington became the 42nd state in the Union.

Within months, two more railroads crossed the F&amp;S roadbed a half mile north of new Sedro, forming a triangle where 11 trains eventually arrived daily. Railroad developer Philip A. Woolley moved his family from Elgin, Illinois, to Sedro in December 1899 and bought land around the triangle. He built the Skagit River Lumber &amp; Shingle Mill next to where the railroads crossed and he started his namesake company town there that was based on sales of railroad ties to the three rail companies, including the Seattle and Northern Railway (forerunner of the Great Northern Railway) and the Northern Pacific Railroad.
Meanwhile, a fourth town rose nearby when the F&amp;S laid rails on a &quot;wye&quot; that led northeast from Sedro about four and a half miles to coal mines. Bennett bought the mines, along with Montana mining financier Charles X. Larrabee, and they soon sold their interests to James J. Hill, owner of the Great Northern. The resulting ore soon turned out to be more suitable for coking coal and a town began there named Cokedale. Cokedale faded in importance when the mine declined and the other towns all merged on December 19, 1898, as Sedro-Woolley.

On May 15, 1922, a circus elephant known as Tusko rampaged through the town after it escaped from the traveling Al G. Barnes Circus. He was the largest circus elephant in captivity at the time, measuring tall and weighing . Tusko demolished several fences, knocked down telephone poles, and destroyed a Model T. He was chased by local residents for in the surrounding countryside, and was captured the following morning.

After logging and coal-mining declined, the major employers and industries became the nearby Northern State Hospital (a mental-health facility) and Skagit Steel &amp; Iron Works, which rose from the back room of a local hardware store to become a major supplier of implements and parts for logging and railroad customers. The firm manufactured machines and parts for the war effort in World War II and artillery shells, starting in 1953. By 1990, the company was gone and the hospital was closed but new industry, including robotics and aerospace, is developing north of town and on the campus of the old hospital.

==Government==
The City of Sedro-Woolley is a non-charter code city that operates under a Mayor-Council form of government with seven councilmembers. Six councilmembers are elected by wards and one is elected at-large. Each councilmember serves a four-year term. The mayor is elected at-large every four years and is responsible for the executive functions of the city. The mayor appoints a city supervisor, subject to confirmation by the city council, who is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the city and oversees the department directors. The municipal judge is appointed by the mayor, subject to confirmation of the city council, and operates independently of the other branches of government.

Sedro-Woolley is a full-service city with its own police department, fire department, wastewater treatment plan, solid waste operation, storm water division, street department, parks department and administration. The city maintains a large number of public parks and open spaces such as Hammer Heritage Square in downtown Sedro-Woolley. Riverfront Park situated on the north bank of the Skagit River is the signature park. It consists of nearly and includes picnic shelters, baseball fields, RV park, amphitheater, and an off-leash dog park. Every year on the 4th of July the city celebrates with a festive carnival, and hosts the Loggerodeo parade.

The district has one high school (Sedro-Woolley High School), one middle school, seven elementary schools, and several alternative schooling programs. This includes a Job Corps center.

==Culture==
Sedro-Woolley is the home of Loggerodeo, a celebration staged annually since the mid-1930s close to the Fourth of July. The annual event is well known in Western Washington and one of the oldest rural summer celebrations in the state with many of the events dating back more than 100 years. Loggerodeo features a carnival, foot-race, log drive, old-time logging show, championship rodeo, children&#x27;s parade, the annual Fourth of July parade, and an invitation-only chainsaw carving competition. Favorite chainsaw carved log creations from the carving competitions of past years line the downtown Sedro-Woolley area. It is also home to the legendary Hal&#x27;s Drive-In, an institution in the town for decades.

<text>North Bonneville is a city along the Columbia River in Skamania County, Washington, United States. The population was 1,397 at the 2020 census. It lies within the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area on the north side of Bonneville Dam complex. The city was originally developed to house the dam&#x27;s construction workers in the 1930s and later relocated from its original site in the 1970s to accommodate new dam facilities.

==History==

The community of North Bonneville developed as a construction town next to the massive Bonneville Lock, Dam, and powerhouse project begun in late 1933. North Bonneville was officially incorporated on June 25, 1935.

The Columbia&#x27;s north shore where North Bonneville had grown was selected by federal agencies in 1971 as the site for the second Powerhouse. Faced with the prospect of being displaced and disbanded the townspeople determined to relocate as a community. Intense efforts by citizens’ groups and planning assistance from state sources finally led to agreements with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to hire professionals for the design and construction of a new town. Contractors then prepared the chosen town site for the initial community of 600 people as the old town was devoured by the enormous excavation for the new powerhouse.
Federal responsibility for the North Bonneville relocation was expanded in 1974 with enactment of Public Law 93-251, referred to as the McCormack legislation. This law specifically broadened the Corps&#x27; authority and obligation in relocation assistance to North Bonneville . The $35 million relocation project included raising the new town site above the 100-year flood plain, construction of streets, utilities, lighting, sewage system, water supply and sewage treatment plant, flood protection, parks, a central business district and all public buildings. Town sitting required highway and railway relocation. And residents and business were furnished temporary housing until they could build their own permanent homes and facilities. The new town was built to accommodate 1500 residents. A celebration of the successful relocation was held on July 29, 1978.

In October 1991, North Bonneville became the first city in Washington history to declare bankruptcy under Chapter 9. The city government had filed several lawsuits against the Corps of Engineers to resolve disputes related to the 1970s relocation. A lawsuit that alleged a breach of contract was filed in 1980 and was ruled in the Corps&#x27; favor in 1991, which resulted in a $365,000 payment awarded to the Corps. The city government was unable to pay the sum and voted to file for bankruptcy protection.

===Public Development Authority===
Following the legalization of cannabis by a 2012 voter initiative in Washington State, the North Bonneville Public Development Authority was created to manage a city-owned cannabis retail store that opened on March 7, 2015.

Settlers expanded the original dock to serve the daily arrivals of sternwheelers unloading passengers, cargo and loading logs.

In 1893, in a dispute over rental fees, an unknown crew transported the county records from the town of Cascades to Stevenson. Stevenson became the county seat of Skamania overnight. Stevenson was officially incorporated on December 16, 1907. In 1908 the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway arrived, pushing the town up the hill away from the river. Streets were graded, wooden sidewalks constructed and the city asked residents to keep their cows from roaming the streets.

<text>Arlington is a city in northern Snohomish County, Washington, United States, part of the Seattle metropolitan area. The city lies on the Stillaguamish River in the western foothills of the Cascade Range, adjacent to the city of Marysville. It is approximately north of Everett, the county seat, and north of Seattle, the state&#x27;s largest city. As of the 2020 U.S. census, Arlington had a population of 19,868; its estimated population is 20,075 as of 2021.

The city lies in the traditional territory of the Stillaguamish people, an indigenous Coast Salish group. Arlington was established in the 1880s by settlers and the area was platted as two towns, Arlington and Haller City. Haller City was absorbed by the larger Arlington, which was incorporated as a city in 1903. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Arlington area was the site of major projects undertaken for employment under the direction of federal relief agencies, including construction of a municipal airport that would serve as a naval air station during World War II. Arlington began suburbanizing in the 1980s, growing by more than 450 percent by 2000 and annexing the unincorporated area of Smokey Point to the southwest.

The economy of the Arlington area historically relied on timber and agriculture. In the early 21st century, it has transitioned to a service economy, with some aviation industry jobs near the municipal airport. The city is governed by a mayor–council government, electing a mayor and seven city councilmembers. The municipal government maintains the city&#x27;s parks system and water and wastewater utilities. Other services, including public utilities, public transportation, and schools, are contracted to regional or county-level agencies and companies.

==History==

===Pre-incorporation===

The indigenous Coast Salish peoples have inhabited the Puget Sound region since the retreat of the Vashon Glacier approximately 12,000 years ago. Several archeological sites along the Stillaguamish River contain artifacts that are dated to the Olcott Phase, approximately 9,000 years before present. The traditional territory of the Stillaguamish people includes modern-day Arlington and much of the Stillaguamish River basin; they had at least ten known villages along the river and its tributaries, including two in the Arlington area. Among them was (meaning &quot;confluence&quot;; variously anglicized as Skabalko or Skabalco), a settlement with winter longhouses and 200–300 people at the confluence of the two forks of the Stillaguamish River. Other Coast Salish peoples who were intermarried with the Stillaguamish would travel to this village in the summer to follow fish runs. The neighborhood of Kent Prairie () was once a prairie where the Stillaguamish, Sauk, and Snohomish would gather wild crops. In modern Lushootseed, Arlington and the surrounding area is named , meaning &quot;wolf&quot;.

American exploration of the area began in 1851, when prospector Samuel Hancock was led by Indian guides on a canoe up the Stillaguamish River. The area was opened to logging after the signing of the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855 between the federal government and various Puget Sound peoples. The Stillaguamish, one of the signatory tribes, were ordered to travel to the Tulalip Indian Reservation, but many members refused and remained in their ancestral lands. After attempts in the early 20th century, the tribe were granted federal recognition in 1976 and a reservation in 2014.

In 1856, the U.S. Army built a military road connecting Fort Steilacoom to Fort Bellingham, crossing the Stillaguamish River near the confluence. In the 1880s, wagon roads were constructed to this area from the towns of Marysville to the south and Silvana to the west, bringing entrepreneurs to the logging camps, informally named &quot;The Forks&quot;. The area&#x27;s first store was opened in 1888 by Nels K. Tvete and Nils C. Johnson, and was followed by a hotel with lodging and meals for loggers.

Two settlements were established on the south side of the confluence in anticipation of the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway building a track through the area. G. Morris Haller, son of Colonel Granville O. Haller, founded a settlement on the banks of the Stillaguamish River in 1883, naming it &quot;Haller City&quot;.

The Seattle, Lake Shore &amp; Eastern Railroad chose to build its depot on higher ground to the south of Haller City, leading contractors Earl &amp; McLeod to establish a new town at the depot on March 15, 1890. The new town was named &quot;Arlington&quot; after Lord Henry Arlington, member of the cabinet of King Charles II of England. Arlington and Haller City were platted within a month of each other in 1890, quickly developing a rivalry that would continue for several years.

Arlington and Haller City grew rapidly in their first years, reaching a combined population of 500 by 1893, relying on agriculture, dairy farming and the manufacturing of wood shingles as their main sources of income. Both towns established their own schools, post offices, saloons, general stores, churches, social clubs, and hotels. The two towns were separated by a tract claimed by two settlers in 1891, preventing either town from fully absorbing the other. During the late 1890s, the claim dispute was settled and merchants began moving to the larger, more prosperous Arlington, signalling the end for Haller City. Today, Haller City is memorialized in the name of a park in downtown Arlington, as well as a middle school operated by the Arlington School District.

===Incorporation and early 20th century===
Arlington was incorporated as a fourth-class city on May 20, 1903, including the remnants of Haller City (located north of modern-day Division Street). The incorporation came after a referendum on May 5, in which 134 of 173 voters approved the city&#x27;s incorporation. The new city elected shingle mill owner John M. Smith as its first mayor. In the years following incorporation, Arlington gained a local bank, a cooperative creamery, a city park, a library, electricity, and telephone service.

During the early 20th century, Arlington&#x27;s largest employers remained its shingle mills and saw mills. Other industries, including dairy processing, mechanical shops, stores, and factories, became prominent after World War I, during a period of growth for the city. The Great Depression of the 1930s forced all but one of the mills to close, causing unemployment to rise in Arlington and neighboring cities. The federal government established a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp near Darrington to create temporary jobs; the young men built structures and conducted firefighting in the Mount Baker National Forest. The Works Progress Administration and Civil Works Administration funded the construction of the city&#x27;s sidewalks, a high school, and a municipal airport that opened in 1934.

The entry of the United States into World War II brought the U.S. Navy to Arlington, resulting in the conversion of the municipal airport into a naval air station in 1943. The Navy constructed new runways and hangars and, beginning in 1946, the municipal government was allowed to operate civilian and commercial services. Ownership of the airport was formally transferred from the federal government back to the city of Arlington in 1959.

On October 19, 1959, a Boeing 707-227 crashed on the banks of the Stillaguamish River&#x27;s North Fork during a test flight, killing four of eight occupants. The plane, being flown by Boeing test pilots instructing personnel from Braniff International Airways, lost three engines and suffered a fire in the fourth after a dutch roll had been executed beyond maximum bank restrictions. The plane made an emergency landing in the riverbed while unsuccessfully trying to reach a nearby open field.

===Suburbanization and present day===

The completion of Interstate 5 and State Route 9 in the late 1960s brought increased residential development in Arlington, forming a bedroom community for commuters who worked in Everett and Seattle. Despite the influx of commuting residents, Arlington retained its small-town image while unsuccessfully attempting to lure new industries and a state college. Suburban housing developments began construction in the 1980s and 1990s, driving a 450 percent increase in Arlington&#x27;s population to 15,000 by 2007. In 1999, Arlington annexed the community of Smokey Point, located along Interstate 5 to the southwest of the city, after a lengthy court battle with Marysville, which instead was permitted to annex Lakewood to the west. The city began developing a large business park around the municipal airport in the 1990s, bringing the city&#x27;s number of jobs to a total of 11,000 by 2003.

The city of Arlington celebrated its centennial in 2003 with a parade, a festival honoring the city&#x27;s history, sporting events, and musical and theatrical performances. The centennial celebrations culminated in the dedication of the $44 million Arlington High School campus, attended by an all-class reunion of the old school. In 2007, the city of Arlington renovated six blocks of downtown&#x27;s Olympic Avenue at a cost of $4.4 million, widening sidewalks, improving street foliage, and adding new street lights. The project was credited with helping revitalize the city&#x27;s downtown, turning Olympic Avenue into a gathering place for residents and a venue for festivals.

On March 22, 2014, a large landslide near Oso dammed the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River, with mud and debris covering an area of . A total of 43 people were killed and nearly 50 structures destroyed. The landslide closed State Route 530 to Darrington, cutting the town off, leaving Arlington as the center of the coordinated emergency response to the disaster. Arlington was recognized for its role in aiding victims of the disaster and hosted U.S. President Barack Obama during his visit to the site in April.

The city has continued to grow in the late 2010s, with new apartment buildings constructed in Smokey Point, including those designed as retirement communities. The Cascade Industrial Center, located on between Arlington and Marysville, was designated by the Puget Sound Regional Council in 2019 and is planned to house manufacturing and other industrial uses.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Arlington has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The city is in the northwestern part of Snohomish County in Western Washington, and is considered part of the Seattle metropolitan area. It is approximately north of Seattle and north of Everett. Arlington&#x27;s city limits are generally defined to the south by Marysville at State Route 531 (172nd Street NE) and roughly 165th Street NE, to the west by Interstate 5, to the north by the Stillaguamish River valley, and to the east by the Cascade Range foothills. The city&#x27;s urban growth boundary includes within and outside of city limits.

The city lies on a glacial terrace formed during the Pleistocene epoch by the recession of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. Arlington covers a series of hills that sit at an elevation of above sea level. Downtown Arlington is situated on a bluff above the confluence of the Stillaguamish River and its North and South Forks. Most of Arlington sits in the watersheds of the Stillaguamish River, Portage Creek, and Quilceda Creek. From various points in Arlington, the Olympic Mountains,
Mount Pilchuck, and Mount Rainier are visible on the horizon.

The Stillaguamish River valley and floodplain, including Arlington, lies in a lahar hazard zone downstream from Glacier Peak, an active stratovolcano in the eastern part of the county. During an eruption 13,000 years ago, several eruption-generated lahars deposited more than of sediment on modern-day Arlington.

===Subareas and neighborhoods===

The city of Arlington publishes a decennial comprehensive plan, which divides the urban growth area into ten planning subareas, each containing neighborhoods and subdivisions.
* Old Town consists of downtown Arlington and surrounding residential neighborhoods built during the early 20th century. The northern reaches of Old Town include commercial areas developed during the post-war period that are distinct from older buildings along Olympic Avenue.
* Arlington Bluff is a residential area between the Stillaguamish River floodplain and the Arlington Municipal Airport industrial center.
* Kent Prairie, a residential area south of Old Town, was developed in the early post-war period. The subarea also includes retail stores centered around the intersection of State Route 9 and 204th Street NE. The area was once home to a Stillaguamish village, as well as Arlington&#x27;s first schoolhouse, built in 1884.
* The designated Manufacturing Industrial Center is an industrial district southwest of Old Town, surrounding the Arlington Municipal Airport and the city&#x27;s only active railroad.
* Hilltop consists of Arlington&#x27;s largest planned residential subdivisions, including High Clover Park, Gleneagle, Crown Ridge, and the Magnolias. It is south of Kent Prairie on a large terrace on the west side of State Route 9. Gleneagle is Arlington&#x27;s largest single development, with over 1,000 homes and a private golf course.
* The Brekhus/Beach subarea, also known as Burn Hill, is a residential area southeast of Old Town and is centered along Burn Road.

The West Arlington Subarea, designated in 2011, combines several neighborhoods annexed by Arlington in the 1990s and 2000s, including Smokey Point and Island Crossing.
* Smokey Point, annexed by Arlington in 1999, is a major commercial and residential area at the junction of Interstate 5 and State Route 531, southwest of Arlington. Portions of Smokey Point extend south and west into the city of Marysville, which annexed the area in the 2000s.
* Island Crossing, at the junction of Interstate 5 and State Route 530, is a rural community with a cluster of retail stores. It was annexed by Arlington in 2008, and has been re-designated for commercial development.
* The proposed King-Thompson subarea is northwest of Smokey Point and lies outside of Arlington&#x27;s city limits and urban growth boundary. It has been identified as a potential area for extensive residential development. The municipal government applied to annex the area into the city&#x27;s urban growth area in 2013, but withdrew the application in 2016.

===Climate===

Arlington has a general climate similar to most of the Puget Sound lowlands, with dry summers and mild, rainy winters moderated by a marine influence from the Pacific Ocean. The majority of the region&#x27;s precipitation arrives during the winter and early spring, and Arlington averages 181 days of precipitation per year.

Arlington&#x27;s early economy relied heavily on timber harvesting and processing, notably the production of red cedar wood shingles at mills that closed during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Locally, Arlington was known as the &quot;Shingle Capital of the World&quot;, although mills in Everett and Ballard produced more shingles at the time. Agriculture and dairy farming emerged as significant industries to Arlington during the early 20th century, with farms lining the floodplain of the Stillaguamish River. A major cooperative creamery and was established in Arlington during the 1910s, but later moved to Mount Vernon after World War II.

The transformation of Arlington into a bedroom community for Everett and Seattle during the 1980s and 1990s came with it a move towards a service economy. Among the largest employers of Arlington residents are the Boeing Everett Factory and Naval Station Everett. The expansion of the aerospace industry in the Seattle region led Arlington to develop its own municipal airport into an aerospace job center, which includes a high concentration of Boeing subcontractors. , the airport has 130 on-site businesses that employ 590 people, with an annual economic output of $94.5 million. Aircraft manufacturer Glasair Aviation is based in Arlington, and Eviation Aircraft uses its Arlington hangars for assembly and testing of the Eviation Alice, an electric prototype model.

The city of Arlington plans to increase the number of jobs within the city to over 20,000 by 2035, bolstered by the designation of the Cascade Industrial Center by the Puget Sound Regional Council in 2019. The industrial center, located between the two cities near Smokey Point, already included major distribution centers and other light industry in the 2000s. A five-story, $355 million Amazon distribution center opened near the airport in 2023. It is the company&#x27;s largest facility in Washington at and is expected to employ 1,200 workers.

==Government and politics==
Arlington is defined as a non-charter code city and operates under a mayor–council government, with an elected mayor and an elected city council.

A library near downtown Arlington opened on June 28, 1981, and holds over 54,000 items. It was originally owned by the city government and was transferred to Sno-Isle in 2021 as part of preparations for a renovation, which had been planned since the 2000s. Sno-Isle identified the Arlington Library as a top priority for renovation and expansion in 2016, while also emphasizing the need for a new library to serve Smokey Point. A pilot library for Smokey Point opened in January 2018, using a leased retail space. Arlington had a single-screen, 381-seat movie theater, the Olympic Theatre in downtown Arlington, that operated from 1939 to 2014.

==Education==
Public schools in Arlington are operated by the Arlington School District, which covers most of the incorporated city and also includes the outlying areas of Arlington Heights, Bryant, Getchell, and Sisco Heights. The district had an enrollment of approximately 5,528 students in 2014 and has nine total schools, including one high school, two middle schools, four elementary schools, and two alternative learning facilities. In the early 2000s, the school district opened four new schools to replace other facilities as part of a $54 million bond measure passed by Arlington voters in 2000. The Smokey Point neighborhood is served by the Lakewood School District, which is in unincorporated North Lakewood and served the area prior to its annexation by Arlington.

Arlington is located approximately away from the Everett Community College, its nearest post-secondary education institution, situated in northern Everett. The college has offered basic skills and job training courses at Arlington&#x27;s Weston High School since 2016, including a branch of its Advanced Manufacturing Training &amp; Education Center.

In 1966, the Smokey Point area was proposed as the location of a four-year public college, with offered by the city of Arlington to the state government. The Washington State Legislature decided to build the college instead in Olympia, becoming The Evergreen State College. The Smokey Point area was again offered by Arlington and Marysville as the site of a University of Washington branch campus in the 2000s, but the project was put on hold and later declined by the state legislature in favor of a Washington State University branch campus in Everett.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
Downtown Arlington is located near the junction of State Route 9 and State Route 530, which serve as the main highways to the city. From Arlington, State Route 9 travels north into Skagit County and south to Snohomish; and State Route 530 travels west to an interchange with Interstate 5, the main north–south highway between Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia, and east to Darrington. Within the city is an additional state highway, State Route 531, which connects Smokey Point, the municipal airport, and Gleneagle to Interstate 5 and State Route 9 in the southern part of the city. Other major arterial roads include Smokey Point Boulevard and 67th Avenue NE, which serve as north–south thoroughfares within Arlington.

Public transportation in Arlington is provided by Community Transit, a public transit authority that operates in most of Snohomish County. Community Transit runs all-day local bus service on one route from Downtown Arlington to Smokey Point, as well as four other routes to Marysville, Everett, Lake Stevens, Lynnwood, and Stanwood from a transit center in Smokey Point. Community Transit also provides local service from Darrington and express service to Lynnwood City Center station and the Boeing Everett Factory. The agency&#x27;s microtransit service, Zip Shuttle, expanded to Arlington and Smokey Point in December 2024. Arlington has one active railroad, a spur line from Marysville to downtown Arlington operated by BNSF Railway (the successor to Burlington Northern). As part of the development of the Arlington Airport business park, BNSF Railway will build two rail spurs leading to the airport in the near future. Arlington does not have passenger rail service, but is near Amtrak stations in Everett and Stanwood.

Historically, Arlington developed along several railroads that have since been abandoned or re-purposed. The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway, which spurred the establishment of Arlington in the 1880s, ran north–south through Arlington on its main line between Snohomish and the Canada–United States border. In 1892, it was acquired by the Northern Pacific Railway, which was acquired by Burlington Northern in 1970. Burlington Northern abandoned the railroad in 1972, favoring a parallel route to the west through Marysville, and it was converted into the Centennial Trail in the 1990s and 2000s. A Northern Pacific branch to Darrington, following the modern-day State Route 530, was built in 1901 and abandoned in 1990; the county government plans to use the right of way for the Whitehorse Trail, a multi-purpose trail.

The city of Arlington owns the Arlington Municipal Airport, located southwest of downtown Arlington. The airport is primarily used for general aviation and light business, and is home to 475 aircraft, including 10 helicopters, 20 gliders, and 23 ultra-light aircraft. Approximately 130 businesses are located on airport property, of which one-quarter are involved in aviation-related uses directly impacting the airport. In the 1990s, the airport was explored as a candidate for expansion into a regional airport to relieve Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. The plan was ultimately abandoned by 1996, as the Puget Sound Regional Council instead chose to construct a third runway at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport.

===Utilities===

Electric power in Arlington is provided by the Snohomish County Public Utility District (PUD), a consumer-owned public utility that purchases most of its electricity from the federal Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). The BPA operates the region&#x27;s system of electrical transmission lines, including Path 3, a major national transmission corridor running along the eastern side of Arlington towards British Columbia. Cascade Natural Gas and Puget Sound Energy provide natural gas to Arlington residents and businesses north and south of State Route 531, respectively; two major north–south gas pipelines run through Arlington and are maintained by the Olympic Pipeline Company, a subsidiary of BP, and the Northwest Pipeline Company, a subsidiary of Williams Companies. Arlington is served by three telephone companies and internet service providers: Comcast (Xfinity), Frontier Communications (including Verizon FiOS), and Wave Broadband.

The city of Arlington provides water and water treatment to approximately 5,548 customers within a service area within the city limits and some surrounding areas. The city&#x27;s water is sourced from groundwater deposits near Haller Park on the Stillaguamish River and near Arlington Municipal Airport, as well as water purchased from the Snohomish County PUD that is sourced from Spada Lake. The Smokey Point neighborhood is served by the City of Marysville&#x27;s water system.

Wastewater and stormwater are collected and treated by the municipal government before being discharged into the Stillaguamish River basin. Arlington&#x27;s municipal solid waste and single-stream recycling collection and disposal services are contracted by the municipal government to Waste Management; the Snohomish County government and Republic Services also operate a transfer station in Arlington.

===Health care===

Arlington is part of the Snohomish Public Hospital District No. 3, which operates the Cascade Valley Hospital, a 48-bed general hospital. The hospital was established in 1909 and was the last independent hospital in Snohomish County at the time of its acquisition in 2016. The city is also served by community clinics operated by Cascade Valley (and Skagit Regional Health) as well as The Everett Clinic and the Community Health Center of Snohomish County.

<text>Brier is a city in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. It is bordered by Mountlake Terrace to the west, Lynnwood to the north, Bothell to the east, and Lake Forest Park to the south. The population was 6,560 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Brier is located in the traditional territory of several Coast Salish peoples, including the Sammamish, Snohomish, and Suquamish. The area around modern-day Swamp Creek was known as &quot;dxʷɬ(ə)q̓ ab&quot;, meaning &quot;other side of something&quot; and &quot;a wide place&quot;, in the Lushootseed language.

The first European-descendant settlers in the Brier area, the Salty family, arrived from Finland in 1883 and constructed a cabin to establish a Homestead Act claim. They were followed by loggers who cleared land that had already been sold to the founders of the Puget Mill Company. The first area school was built on land donated by the Salty family in September 1896 and later replaced with the Cedar Valley School in 1911. By 1915, much of the forestland around modern-day Brier was cleared.

The Brier area was known for its mink farms and later gave way to suburban ranch houses in the 1950s and 1960s. The Shasta Park subdivision was created in 1924 and further developed into smaller lots by the early 1950s. Brier was named for an existing road that bisected the subdivision where the community was developed in the 1950s.

Brier was officially incorporated as a city on February 11, 1965, after an emergency vote following a proposal from a developer to annex the area into neighboring Mountlake Terrace. Boeing engineer Richard Balser was elected as the city&#x27;s first mayor and the first city hall was in the home of a local resident who rented a room to the city government for $50 per month. Brier gained approximately 1,000 residents within ten years and opened its permanent city hall and public library in 1974; a city park opened in 1976 as part of the national bicentennial celebrations. The area was gradually developed into a more suburban community, growing to over 6,000 people by 1999. Since its incorporation, several elected officials in Brier have been recalled or forced to resign over various misconduct allegations and convictions. A new city hall opened in April 2005, replacing a leased office.

<text>Darrington is a town in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. It is located in a North Cascades mountain valley formed by the Sauk and North Fork Stillaguamish rivers. Darrington is connected to nearby areas by State Route 530, which runs along the two rivers towards the city of Arlington, located to the west, and Rockport. It had a population of 1,347 at the 2010 census.

Non-indigenous settlement in the area began in 1891 at the site of a Skagit campsite between the two rivers, near the traditional home of the Sauk-Suiattle tribe. Prospectors had arrived in the area during the 1880s while looking for gold and other minerals, but were quickly displaced by the logging industry that would come to dominate Darrington for much of the 20th century. The Northern Pacific Railway built a branch line to the town in 1901 and ushered in several years of growth.

During the Great Depression, Darrington hosted a Civilian Conservation Corps camp that improved roads, trails, and firefighting infrastructure in the nearby Mount Baker National Forest. Several waves of Appalachian emigrants arrived in the area from North Carolina, forming a culture that is seen in the town&#x27;s annual bluegrass festival and rodeo.

Darrington was incorporated as a town in 1945, under a mayor–council government. Its economy has transitioned away from logging and towards tourism, particularly outdoor activities such as hiking, mountain climbing, and fishing, due to its proximity to the Mount Baker–Snoqualmie National Forest. The Darrington area is above sea level and receives significantly more precipitation and snowfall than the Puget Sound lowlands.

==History==

===Prehistory and early exploration===

The upper Stillaguamish and Sauk valleys on the Sauk, Suiattle, and White Chuck rivers were historically inhabited by various Native American Coast Salish groups, including the Stillaguamish, the Sauk-Suiattle, and the Upper Skagit. The Sauk-Suiattle maintained a village site and burial ground near modern-day Darrington, while the Skagit used the plain between the Stillaguamish and Sauk rivers as a portage for overland transport of canoes. The portage, Anglicized as Kudsl Kudsl or Kuds-al-kaid, was also used as a transiting point for travelers from Eastern Washington on their way to and from the Puget Sound coast.

The area was known as Burn or Sauk Portage to early surveyors and visitors from towns along the Puget Sound coastline. A group of railroad surveyors for the Northern Pacific Railway arrived in modern-day Darrington in 1870 while plotting the potential route for a railroad crossing the Cascades to Lake Chelan, but ultimately chose Stampede Pass to the south. The North Stillaguamish Valley was nicknamed &quot;Starve Out&quot; by early settlers, who arrived alone and underprepared for the area&#x27;s conditions, leading to several difficult winters. Soldiers sent to the area by the valley settlers threatened to evict the Sauk-Suiattles; this did not occur as the settlers&#x27; claim that the Sauk-Suiattle were hostile and had attacked them was determined to be unfounded. The tribe later hired surveyors to record their claims to the eastern side of the Sauk River, lands that currently comprise their Indian reservation.

The discovery of gold and other valuable minerals in the Monte Cristo area in 1889 lured prospectors into the North Cascades and stimulated the development of the surrounding valleys. A wagon road along the Sauk River connecting Monte Cristo to Sauk Prairie and the settlement of Sauk City on the Skagit River was built in 1891, later forming part of the modern Mountain Loop Highway. It was only used for three years before being replaced by the Everett and Monte Cristo Railway to the south; until that time, the Sauk Prairie at the modern site of Darrington was an overnight camping spot for prospectors. Nearby areas were explored by prospectors who made over a hundred claims to tracts of land in the highlands around the valley, including Gold Hill.

===Establishment and early development===

The Sauk Prairie campsite evolved into a settlement that was known as &quot;The Portage&quot; and developed around several homesteads established between 1888 and 1891. A vote on a name was held by several pioneer residents in July 1891 in advance of the establishment of a post office. The vote was tied between two options, Portage (in some accounts, Norma) and Darrington, the maiden name of settler W. W. Cristopher&#x27;s mother. According to some reports, the name was originally to be &quot;Barrington&quot; but was changed due to a mistake from the Postal Department or by the townspeople to resemble the word &quot;dare&quot;. By the end of the decade, the town had gained a schoolhouse, a general store, a hotel, and a postmaster, Fred Olds, whose horse inspired the naming of Whitehorse Mountain.

Darrington&#x27;s residents lobbied the Seattle and International Railway for the construction of a branch line from Arlington to the town as early as 1895, offering a 15-year contract to ship 75 percent of the area&#x27;s extracted ores. The railroad agreed to the offer and began construction in 1900. It later merged with the Northern Pacific Railway, outpacing Great Northern and their plans to build a railroad to their timber holdings in the Sauk River valley. Railway crews arrived in the Darrington area by the following year and the first train arrived at the town&#x27;s depot in 1901.

Several sawmills and other timber industries began in the years following the railroad&#x27;s completion, as mining fortunes in the surrounding area dwindled. Most of the original prospectors had left the Darrington area during the Klondike gold rush of the late 1890s, while those who remained established a single smelter in the mountains. A Bornite mine was later developed at Long Mountain in hopes of reviving mining in the area, but was abandoned after its mineral deposits were found to be smaller than expected. By 1906, Darrington had more than a hundred residents; a second hotel and the town&#x27;s first social club had been built. The U.S. Lumber Company, which began in 1901 as the Allen Mill, was the largest employer in Darrington during the early 1910s, producing 23,000 board feet (54.28 m) of wood per day.

U.S. Lumber angered the townspeople by hiring 21 Japanese laborers at similar wages to their white counterparts. In June 1910, a mob of white men rioted and drove the Japanese out of town after little resistance, paying for their train fare to Everett after allowing them to retrieve their belongings. A report by Seattle-based vice-consul Kinjiro Hayashi was forwarded to the Japanese ambassador and state government. The company filed for an injunction after rioters had threatened to burn its Darrington mill and other properties should it attempt to return the Japanese laborers. The injunction was denied, but the townspeople relented and allowed 20 Japanese laborers to return to the mill a week later following Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu&#x27;s visit to Seattle.

===Early 20th century===
Darrington&#x27;s residents resisted the county government&#x27;s dry plan to prohibit the sale of alcohol and close the town&#x27;s saloons. They circulated a petition to incorporate Darrington as a fourth-class city in order to continue alcohol sales, but the attempt was thwarted after protests by U.S. Lumber and several civic leaders. On July 5, 1910, the town voted 46–35 in favor of remaining a &quot;wet&quot; settlement, but the countywide plebiscite the same day passed in favor of prohibition.

The town grew substantially in the early 1920s, with new sawmills attracting more residents and businesses. The wagon road along the North Fork Stillaguamish River (now part of State Route 530) was improved. A local improvement club established a fire department, a municipal water supply, and electrical service. Standard Oil built an auxiliary gas station in 1922 to serve the area, and a stagecoach service started at the same time. Darrington gained its first movie theater in 1923, a high school in 1925, and a purpose-built jail that replaced a disused boxcar.

Falling lumber prices during the Great Depression led several small sawmills in the Darrington area to suspend operations for a full year and laying off most of the town&#x27;s workforce in late 1930. The town suffered outbreaks of scarlet fever and smallpox in 1931, followed by winter storms that damaged bridges and roads in the Sauk valley. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) work program established Camp Darrington on May 20, 1933, to provide employment for up to 200 men from northern Snohomish County. The townspeople established a local cooperative association in 1935 to create jobs, including 33 at an independent sawmill, and provide services at a shared cost.

Camp Darrington was primarily used to fight wildfires and develop infrastructure in the Darrington district of the Mount Baker National Forest, including roads, trails, and a series of fire lookout towers atop nearby mountains. Among its projects was the Mountain Loop Highway, which provided connections between ranger stations in Darrington and Granite Falls and also opened up the Cascades backcountry to logging and recreation. The camp employed the first wave of Appalachian emigrants from North Carolina, who would eventually form a majority of the town&#x27;s population. Camp Darrington workers also assisted in the creation of two winter sports areas that were equipped with ski runs, toboggan trails, and a ski jump. The Works Progress Administration, another federal jobs program, provided funds to replace the town&#x27;s overcrowded high school in 1936.

===Incorporation and decline of lumber===

Darrington reached a population of 600 residents in 1945 and was officially incorporated as a fourth-class town on October 15, 1945, following a 96–60 vote in favor. The townspeople celebrated by establishing an annual summer festival, the Timberbowl, which ran until 1967 and was initially used to raise funds for a fire engine and other equipment. A two-story town hall was built in 1947, housing the town council chambers, offices for town officials, the police department, the fire department, and a public library. In 1952, the town built a dedicated community center to serve as a venue for various social functions and a general gymnasium with seating for 1,200 people. A new high school and municipal airport opened in 1958 at opposite ends of the town.

Railroad companies with large timber holdings in the area began to leave in the 1960s, leading to the rise of independent &quot;gyppo&quot; loggers who salvaged discarded timber while under contract to regional paper mills. A large open-pit mine on Miners Ridge planned by Kennecott in the late 1960s was halted after intervention from environmental activists and local politicians. Northern Pacific ended passenger rail service to the Darrington area in the 1960s, and the passenger depot was demolished in 1967. The railroad was eventually abandoned in 1990 and its right-of-way was acquired by the county for conversion into a rail trail.

The gyppo operations gave way to a small local timber company, Summit Timber, which acquired the largest sawmill in Darrington, now the Hampton mill. Several smaller mills in Darrington and surrounding communities, including four for cedar shakes, closed during the 1960s, leading to further population decline. The area&#x27;s timber industry was also adversely affected by tighter logging restrictions on federal lands during the 1980s and 1990s meant to protect the mountain habitats of threatened and endangered species, including the northern spotted owl. In response, Summit transitioned to processing private forests and lands managed by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources, maintaining its position as the town&#x27;s largest employer. The loss of timber-industry jobs led to local protests, part of the &quot;timber wars&quot; that erupted across logging communities in the Pacific Northwest during the 1990s.

===Tourism economy and modern Darrington===
The town government sought to diversify Darrington&#x27;s economy and focus on tourism as an alternate industry, creating new festivals and promoting its existing bluegrass festival and rodeo. It adopted strong land use controls to preserve its rural character in the 1970s, which prevented new development until 2002. Darrington subsequently developed into a bedroom community for commuters working in Everett and Marysville. Opposition from residents forced the town government to drop plans for a 400-bed minimum-security prison work camp in 1990.

The town government unsuccessfully campaigned for a NASCAR racetrack and regional swimming center in the early 2000s, aiming to become an all-year destination for the county. Several major floods in the late 1990s and early 2000s damaged properties along the rivers; in 2003, a flood washed out part of the Mountain Loop Highway. The highway was not restored until 2008, costing Darrington approximately $750,000 in tourist revenue and forcing several businesses to close. Darrington&#x27;s main lumber mill laid off 67 workers in 2011, citing the effects of the Great Recession and declining demand. The town government, running on a small budget of $1.6 million, accepted several grants from the state to upgrade its water system and repair streets during the recession.

On March 22, 2014, a major mudslide on a hillside near Oso, west of Darrington, destroyed dozens of homes and a section of State Route 530, cutting off direct road access between Arlington and Darrington for two months. It killed 43 people, becoming the deadliest landslide in U.S. history and the deadliest natural disaster in state history since the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Darrington was one of the main staging areas for disaster response workers and supplies; the community center was used as an emergency shelter for victims and the rodeo grounds became an animal shelter and housing for workers.

State Route 530 was partially reopened by early June and a permanent replacement was opened in September. The increased costs to local businesses resulting from the long detour via State Route 20 were mitigated with low-interest loans from the Small Business Administration and recovery funds, including $9.5 million in private donations. The tourism industry in Darrington also received a state-funded advertising campaign, keeping revenue and visitation for local events at pre-slide levels. The state government, together with the Economic Alliance Snohomish County and Washington State University, drafted a $65 million economic recovery plan that was put into effect in 2016.

==Geography==
Darrington is located in the northeastern reach of Snohomish County in Western Washington, just south of the Skagit County border. It is east of Arlington, the nearest city, and northeast of Seattle. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

Darrington is situated on a plain between the North Fork Stillaguamish River to the west and the Sauk River to the east. The plain is long and wide, at approximately above sea level in a valley between foothills of the Cascade Mountains, including the Whitehorse Mountain.

The plain was formed by lahar deposits from several eruptions of Glacier Peak, to the southeast. The area remains in the volcano&#x27;s lahar hazard zone and also lies on a fault line that last produced a major earthquake less than 500 years ago. Soil in the Darrington area is primarily composed of glacial sands and gravels that have deposits of various mineral ores, including gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, antimony, arsenic, mercury, and iron.

===Climate=== 

Darrington has a general climate similar to most of the Puget Sound lowlands and the Cascades foothills, with dry summers and mild, rainy winters moderated by a marine influence from the Pacific Ocean. Temperatures in Darrington typically differ by approximately from Everett and other coastal cities in the county, with colder winters and warmer summers. The majority of the region&#x27;s precipitation arrives during the winter and early spring, and Darrington averages 152 days of precipitation annually that totals on average—significantly higher than areas in lowland Snohomish County. Darrington also receives significantly more snowfall than other cities in the county due to being in the mountains, with 10 to 15 days on average and approximately of snowfall annually since 1911.

July is Darrington&#x27;s warmest month, with average high temperatures of , and January is the coolest, at an average high of . The highest recorded temperature, , occurred in July 2007, and the lowest, , in January 1950. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Darrington has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb).

==Economy==
Darrington&#x27;s largest industry remains logging, centered around several small companies and the Hampton sawmill, the town&#x27;s largest employer at 160 jobs. Hampton acquired the disused sawmill from Summit Timber in 2002 and reopened it the following year after $15 million in renovations. The sawmill primarily processes western hemlock and Douglas fir from nearby state and local lands. Other major industries in the town include tourism and outdoor recreation, educational services for the Darrington School District, and forestry management. The town has a grocery store, a bakery, several restaurants, a bookstore, and a microbrewery. The Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe had a small casino and bingo hall that employs 50 people until it closed in 2020.

A 2015 Census Bureau survey estimated that Darrington had a workforce population of 1,138 and an unemployment rate of 9.3 percent. The most common employers for Darrington residents are in manufacturing (23.8 percent), followed by educational and health services (17.6 percent), retail (13.7 percent), and public administration (10.5 percent). Approximately 9.9 percent of Darrington residents also work within the town, while 13 percent commute to Everett, 6.4 percent work in Seattle, and 5.7 percent work in Arlington. The average one-way commute for the town&#x27;s workers is approximately 36.5 minutes; 85.3 percent of commuters drove alone to their workplace, while 6.8 percent carpooled and 6.2 percent walked or used other modes of transport.

==Demographics==
Darrington is the third-smallest incorporated place in Snohomish County, ahead of Woodway and Index, with a population of 1,462 as of the 2020 census. Historically, the Darrington area&#x27;s population peaked at an estimated 3,500 to 4,000 in the early 20th century during the heyday of logging in the area, which also attracted Scandinavian and Western European immigrants. The town saw an influx of Appalachian transplants from North Carolina (particularly the area around Sylva) in the 1940s and 1950s, whose families remain in the Darrington area, influencing traditions and local culture. The town&#x27;s population has remained relatively stable since the 1960s, declining by 230 residents by 1990 and rebounding since then. Darrington predominantly has single-family residences, with only 36 multi-family units reported in 2010.

==Government and politics==

Darrington is an incorporated town that operates under a mayor–council form of government. It is one of two towns within Snohomish County, the other being Index, the only incorporated place in the county with a smaller population than Darrington. The five town council members regularly meet twice per month and are elected to four-year terms alongside the mayor. The current mayor, Dan Rankin, a sawmill owner and former councilmember, was elected in 2011; he has twice been re-elected.

The town government handles and manages public safety, public works, administration, and parks and recreation. It also operates a public cemetery, the municipal airport, and contracts for utility services. The mayor and town council appoint a clerk treasurer and the heads of various government departments.

, the town government employs seven people and has an annual budget of $3 million. The town has an independent fire department with two stations, but contracts with the Snohomish County Sheriff for policing and emergency services. The town also has a public library branch operated by the Sno-Isle Libraries system and located in the town hall complex, which was built in 1990 and expanded in 2008. The town lacks home delivery of mail, requiring residents to use the local post office.

At the federal level, Darrington is part of the 8th congressional district, which encompasses the eastern portions of the Snohomish, King, and Pierce counties as well as the entirety of Chelan and Kittitas counties. The town was part of the 1st congressional district until 2022. At the state level, Darrington shares the 39th legislative district with Lake Stevens, Granite Falls, and eastern Skagit County. The city lies in the Snohomish County Council&#x27;s 1st district, which includes most of the county north of Everett and Lake Stevens.

While Snohomish County as a whole favors the Democratic Party in elections, Darrington has generally supported Republican candidates. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Darrington had the highest percentage of votes in Snohomish County for Republican Donald Trump, at 61 percent compared to 33 percent for Democrat Hillary Clinton, who carried the county. Similarly, in the same year&#x27;s gubernatorial election, 59 percent of Darrington voters preferred Republican Bill Bryant over incumbent Democrat Jay Inslee, who was re-elected. Some Democrats have succeeded in Darrington, however. In the 2012 presidential election, Barack Obama won the town with 52 percent of the vote.

==Culture==

Darrington describes itself as a self-sufficient and tight-knit community, owing to its isolation and small population. Descendants of emigrants from North Carolina, particularly the Sylva area, after World War II, shaped many of the traditions and customs in the Darrington area. The term &quot;going down below&quot; is sometimes used among Darrington residents to refer to trips outside of the town. Memorial dinners and fundraisers during funerals are hosted by its residents, typically attended by up to a fourth of the town&#x27;s population. Darrington also has a strong tradition of volunteerism, which it sometimes relies on in lieu of municipal services.

===Events and festivals===

Darrington has a community events complex and park located west of the town, which is home to several annual events, including a rodeo and a Bluegrass festival. The Darrington Timberbowl Rodeo began in 1964 and typically draws over a thousand spectators during its two-day run in late June. The rodeo was cancelled in 2013 after an inspection found the venue&#x27;s bleachers to be unsafe, but $25,000 in repairs funded by state grants allowed it to resume the following year. The Timberbowl Rodeo is named for a former festival that was held annually in late June from 1946 to 1967, and featured various logging events and competitions in addition to a town parade.

The Darrington Bluegrass Festival is held for three days every July and was started in 1977 by descendants of Appalachian transplants to the area. The festival draws around 10,000 people, including visitors who use an adjacent campground and participate in communal jam sessions. Prominent Bluegrass groups, including Bill Monroe, the Gibson Brothers, and Rural Delivery, have performed at Darrington&#x27;s Whitehorse Mountain Amphitheater. From 2006 to 2019, the amphitheater also hosted the Summer Meltdown jam festival in early August, which attracted a wide variety of musical acts. The four-day event typically drew 4,000 visitors and 40 acts, as well as art pieces that were installed around the campgrounds. Both festivals were cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The town also has several other annual events, including Darrington Day in late May, a Fourth of July parade, and a street fair in July. Darrington formerly hosted an annual wildflower festival and an annual Christian music festival in the 1990s during the transition to a tourism-based economy.

===Media===

With no local newspaper, events in Darrington are covered by Everett&#x27;s daily newspaper, the &quot;Herald&quot;, a daily publication from Everett, and the weekly &quot;Arlington Times&quot;. The town&#x27;s first newspaper, named &quot;The Wrangler&quot;, was published from 1907 to 1915 by the Darrington Literary Society. A second newspaper, &quot;The Darrington News&quot;, was published for two years from 1947 to 1949 and was followed by the &quot;Timber Bowl Tribune&quot;, which was printed in Darrington and Concrete using a plant owned by &quot;The Concrete Herald&quot;. The &quot;Tribune&quot; was active from 1955 to 1958, when it was folded into the &quot;Arlington Times&quot;.

===Parks and recreation===

Darrington is surrounded by the Mount Baker–Snoqualmie National Forest and serves as the headquarters of the Darrington Ranger District, a unit of the U.S. Forest Service. The area includes three designated wilderness areas, Glacier Peak, Henry M. Jackson, and Boulder River, and over of hiking and backcountry trails that are also open to mountain biking and horseback riding. Darrington has several campgrounds, roadside recreational areas, fishing areas, and whitewater rafting courses along the Sauk and Suiattle rivers. The Mountain Loop Highway connects Darrington to various scenic areas, including birdwatching hotspots and the Pacific Crest Trail system.

The town government also maintains several small parks in Darrington, totaling of open space. Old School Park sits within view of Whitehorse Mountain and has a gazebo, a playground, a skate park, and a pump track for bicycles. Harold Engles Park has a disc golf course and a lawn, and Nels Bruseth Memorial Garden has historic exhibits and a rhododendron garden. The Snohomish County government owns and operates Whitehorse Community Park, which includes several baseball and softball fields on north of the town that opened in 2007. Darrington is the only town in the state to have a permanent archery range, which is one of three that regularly hosts events organized by the National Field Archery Association. The archery complex includes six full ranges, trails, concession stands, and of reserved space. The town also has a community center that was built in 1954 and typically functions as a gymnasium and gathering space.

===Historic preservation===

The town has a small historical society that preserves photographs and other documents for research. The Darrington Ranger District has four structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The ranger station in Darrington was listed in 1991, while the fire lookouts on Three Fingers, Miners Ridge, and Green Mountain were listed in 1987 and 1988. The Green Mountain lookout was to be removed since its maintenance requires helicopters and other machinery, until passage of the Green Mountain Lookout Heritage Protection Act by the U.S. Congress in 2014 provided funds for a restoration project.

===Notable people===

==Education==

The Darrington School District operates two public schools in the town that enroll 414 students during the 2016–17 school year. It employs 31 teachers and administrations, and 50 other staff members. The district primarily serves Darrington and areas east of Oso, as well as areas in Skagit County that are near the Sauk-Suiattle Reservation. The town&#x27;s elementary school, serving kindergarten through eight grade, was opened in 1990 and shares its campus with the high school. The mascot for the school is the Darrington Loggers, named after the town&#x27;s historic principal industry. Loggers teams have won state championships in various sports during the 1950s, 1980s, and 1990s.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

Darrington is located along State Route 530, which travels west towards Arlington and north to State Route 20 at Rockport. The highway carries a daily average of approximately 3,300 vehicles west of the town and 2,300 vehicles north of the town towards the Sauk-Suiattle Reservation. Darrington has a third highway connection through the Mountain Loop Highway, a backcountry scenic byway that runs south through the Cascades and west to Granite Falls. It is closed in the winter and is considered unsuitable for commercial traffic, in part due to a dirt and gravel section.

The area is also served by Community Transit, the main public transportation agency for most of Snohomish County. Route 230 connects Darrington to Oso, Arlington, and a transit center in Smokey Point twice a day during rush hour. The agency expanded its Zip Shuttle microtransit service to Darrington and the surrounding area in December 2024. The Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe operates a bus route serving Darrington, its reservation, and Concrete. It has six daily round trips and launched in 2016 with grants from the state and federal governments.

The Whitehorse Trail, a recreational trail for hikers, cyclists, and horseback riders, is being developed by the county government to connect Darrington with Arlington. It follows the Northern Pacific&#x27;s 1901 route, sold to the county in 1993. The town government operates a small airport, Darrington Municipal Airport, which has a single paved runway suitable for general aviation and other activities.

===Utilities===

Electric power for Darrington residents and businesses is provided by the Snohomish County Public Utility District (PUD), a consumer-owned public utility that serves all of Snohomish County. The Hampton mill operates a small biomass cogeneration plant in Darrington that produces electricity from steam power by burning wood from the Hampton Lumber sawmill. The 7 MW plant was installed in 2006 after an earlier proposal by the National Energy Systems Company (NESCO) for a similar plant that would have generated up to 20 MW was rejected. The NESCO proposal was withdrawn in 2004 over local concerns about air pollution and environmental degradation to the nearby National Forest lands. The town lacks natural gas service and relies on wood-burning stoves for building heat, some of which have been replaced by the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency due to their impact on air quality.

Ziply Fiber is the only land-based provider of Internet and telephone service to Darrington, using a fiber-optic cable laid along State Route 530. The state government awarded a $16.5 million grant in 2022 to improve broadband and fiber service in northern Snohomish County, including Darrington. The installation of new fiber-optic lines and connections to 4,000 households along the State Route 530 corridor is scheduled to be completed by 2025. A non-profit internet provider was started by local residents in 2017 to address the lack of broadband service in the area.

The town government provides water from a pair of wells, and water treatment, to 534 structures. Darrington is one of several small communities in Snohomish County without a municipal sewer system, instead relying on septic tanks. The town government has considered installing a sewage system several times in the 1990s and 2000s, but those plans have stalled due to the $6.5 million cost (as estimated in 2000) and the land needed for a treatment plant. Solid waste and recycling collection is contracted out by the town government to Waste Management.

===Health care===

Darrington&#x27;s nearest general hospital is the Cascade Valley Hospital in Arlington. The town also has a medical clinic operated by Skagit Regional Health and staffed by a single doctor. The clinic was established in 1958 and operated by Cascade Valley Hospital until it was absorbed into the Skagit system. The town has periodically gone for years without a doctor, notably substituting a registered nurse to provide the majority of medical care in the early 1970s. Darrington&#x27;s lone pharmacy was established in 1917 and closed in 2023 after its owner was unable to sell the business. The nearest pharmacy is in Arlington, a round trip.
