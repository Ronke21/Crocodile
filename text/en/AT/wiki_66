<doc id="144428" wikidata="Q51368" url="?curid=144428" title="Degenerate matter">
<text>Degenerate matter occurs when the Pauli exclusion principle significantly alters a state of matter at low temperature. The term is used in astrophysics to refer to dense stellar objects such as white dwarfs and neutron stars, where thermal pressure alone is not enough to prevent gravitational collapse. The term also applies to metals in the Fermi gas approximation.

Degenerate matter is usually modelled as an ideal Fermi gas, an ensemble of non-interacting fermions. In a quantum mechanical description, particles limited to a finite volume may take only a discrete set of energies, called quantum states. The Pauli exclusion principle prevents identical fermions from occupying the same quantum state. At lowest total energy (when the thermal energy of the particles is negligible), all the lowest energy quantum states are filled. This state is referred to as full degeneracy. This degeneracy pressure remains non-zero even at absolute zero temperature. Adding particles or reducing the volume forces the particles into higher-energy quantum states. In this situation, a compression force is required, and is made manifest as a resisting pressure. The key feature is that this degeneracy pressure does not depend on the temperature but only on the density of the fermions. Degeneracy pressure keeps dense stars in equilibrium, independent of the thermal structure of the star.

A degenerate mass whose fermions have velocities close to the speed of light (particle kinetic energy larger than its rest mass energy) is called relativistic degenerate matter.
The concept of degenerate stars, stellar objects composed of degenerate matter, was originally developed in a joint effort between Arthur Eddington, Ralph Fowler and Arthur Milne.

== Concept ==

Quantum mechanics uses the word &#x27;degenerate&#x27; in two ways: degenerate energy levels and as the low temperature ground state limit for states of matter. The electron degeneracy pressure occurs in the ground state systems which are non-degenerate in energy levels. The term &quot;degeneracy&quot; derives from work on the specific heat of gases that pre-dates the use of the term in quantum mechanics.

Degenerate matter exhibits quantum mechanical properties when a fermion system temperature approaches absolute zero. These properties result from a combination of the Pauli exclusion principle and quantum confinement. The Pauli principle allows only one fermion in each quantum state and the confinement ensures that energy of these states increases as they are filled. The lowest states fill up and fermions are forced to occupy high energy states even at low temperature. 

While the Pauli principle and Fermi-Dirac distribution applies to all matter, the interesting cases for degenerate matter involve systems of many fermions. These cases can be understood with the help of the Fermi gas model. Examples include electrons in metals and in white dwarf stars and neutrons in neutron stars. The electrons are confined by Coulomb attraction to positive ion cores; the neutrons are confined by gravitation attraction. The fermions, forced in to higher levels by the Pauli principle, exert pressure preventing further compression.

The allocation or distribution of fermions into quantum states ranked by energy is called the Fermi-Dirac distribution. Degenerate matter exhibits the results of Fermi-Dirac distribution.

== Degeneracy pressure ==
Unlike a classical ideal gas, whose pressure is proportional to its temperature
formula_1
where &quot;P&quot; is pressure, &quot;k&quot;B is the Boltzmann constant, &quot;N&quot; is the number of particles (typically atoms or molecules), &quot;T&quot; is temperature, and &quot;V&quot; is the volume, the pressure exerted by degenerate matter depends only weakly on its temperature. In particular, the pressure remains nonzero even at absolute zero temperature. At relatively low densities, the pressure of a fully degenerate gas can be derived by treating the system as an ideal Fermi gas, in this way
formula_2
where &quot;m&quot; is the mass of the individual particles making up the gas. At very high densities, where most of the particles are forced into quantum states with relativistic energies, the pressure is given by
formula_3
where &quot;K&quot; is another proportionality constant depending on the properties of the particles making up the gas.

All matter experiences both normal thermal pressure and degeneracy pressure, but in commonly encountered gases, thermal pressure dominates so much that degeneracy pressure can be ignored. Likewise, degenerate matter still has normal thermal pressure; the degeneracy pressure dominates to the point that temperature has a negligible effect on the total pressure. The adjacent figure shows the thermal pressure (red line) and total pressure (blue line) in a Fermi gas, with the difference between the two being the degeneracy pressure. As the temperature falls, the density and the degeneracy pressure increase, until the degeneracy pressure contributes most of the total pressure.

While degeneracy pressure usually dominates at extremely high densities, it is the ratio between degenerate pressure and thermal pressure which determines degeneracy. Given a sufficiently drastic increase in temperature (such as during a red giant star&#x27;s helium flash), matter can become non-degenerate without reducing its density.

Degeneracy pressure contributes to the pressure of conventional solids, but these are not usually considered to be degenerate matter because a significant contribution to their pressure is provided by electrical repulsion of atomic nuclei and the screening of nuclei from each other by electrons. The free electron model of metals derives their physical properties by considering the conduction electrons alone as a degenerate gas, while the majority of the electrons are regarded as occupying bound quantum states. This solid state contrasts with degenerate matter that forms the body of a white dwarf, where most of the electrons would be treated as occupying free particle momentum states.

Exotic examples of degenerate matter include neutron degenerate matter, strange matter, metallic hydrogen and white dwarf matter.

== Degenerate gases ==
Degenerate gases are gases composed of fermions such as electrons, protons, and neutrons rather than molecules of ordinary matter. The electron gas in ordinary metals and in the interior of white dwarfs are two examples. Following the Pauli exclusion principle, there can be only one fermion occupying each quantum state. In a degenerate gas, all quantum states are filled up to the Fermi energy. Most stars are supported against their own gravitation by normal thermal gas pressure, while in white dwarf stars the supporting force comes from the degeneracy pressure of the electron gas in their interior. In neutron stars, the degenerate particles are neutrons.

A fermion gas in which all quantum states below a given energy level are filled is called a fully degenerate fermion gas. The difference between this energy level and the lowest energy level is known as the Fermi energy.

=== Electron degeneracy ===

In an ordinary fermion gas in which thermal effects dominate, most of the available electron energy levels are unfilled and the electrons are free to move to these states. As particle density is increased, electrons progressively fill the lower energy states and additional electrons are forced to occupy states of higher energy even at low temperatures. Degenerate gases strongly resist further compression because the electrons cannot move to already filled lower energy levels due to the Pauli exclusion principle. Since electrons cannot give up energy by moving to lower energy states, no thermal energy can be extracted. The momentum of the fermions in the fermion gas nevertheless generates pressure, termed &quot;degeneracy pressure&quot;.

Under high densities, matter becomes a degenerate gas when all electrons are stripped from their parent atoms. The core of a star, once hydrogen burning nuclear fusion reactions stops, becomes a collection of positively charged ions, largely helium and carbon nuclei, floating in a sea of electrons, which have been stripped from the nuclei. Degenerate gas is an almost perfect conductor of heat and does not obey ordinary gas laws. White dwarfs are luminous not because they are generating energy but rather because they have trapped a large amount of heat which is gradually radiated away. Normal gas exerts higher pressure when it is heated and expands, but the pressure in a degenerate gas does not depend on the temperature. When gas becomes super-compressed, particles position right up against each other to produce degenerate gas that behaves more like a solid. In degenerate gases the kinetic energies of electrons are quite high and the rate of collision between electrons and other particles is quite low, therefore degenerate electrons can travel great distances at velocities that approach the speed of light. Instead of temperature, the pressure in a degenerate gas depends only on the speed of the degenerate particles; however, adding heat does not increase the speed of most of the electrons, because they are stuck in fully occupied quantum states. Pressure is increased only by the mass of the particles, which increases the gravitational force pulling the particles closer together. Therefore, the phenomenon is the opposite of that normally found in matter where if the mass of the matter is increased, the object becomes bigger. In degenerate gas, when the mass is increased, the particles become spaced closer together due to gravity (and the pressure is increased), so the object becomes smaller. Degenerate gas can be compressed to very high densities, typical values being in the range of 10,000 kilograms per cubic centimeter.

There is an upper limit to the mass of an electron-degenerate object, the Chandrasekhar limit, beyond which electron degeneracy pressure cannot support the object against collapse. The limit is approximately 1.44 solar masses for objects with typical compositions expected for white dwarf stars (carbon and oxygen with two baryons per electron). This mass cut-off is appropriate only for a star supported by ideal electron degeneracy pressure under Newtonian gravity; in general relativity and with realistic Coulomb corrections, the corresponding mass limit is around 1.38 solar masses. The limit may also change with the chemical composition of the object, as it affects the ratio of mass to number of electrons present. The object&#x27;s rotation, which counteracts the gravitational force, also changes the limit for any particular object. Celestial objects below this limit are white dwarf stars, formed by the gradual shrinking of the cores of stars that run out of fuel. During this shrinking, an electron-degenerate gas forms in the core, providing sufficient degeneracy pressure as it is compressed to resist further collapse. Above this mass limit, a neutron star (primarily supported by neutron degeneracy pressure) or a black hole may be formed instead.

=== Neutron degeneracy ===
Neutron degeneracy is analogous to electron degeneracy and exists in neutron stars, which are partially supported by the pressure from a degenerate neutron gas. Neutron stars are formed either directly from the supernova of stars with masses between 10 and 25 &quot;M&quot;☉ (solar masses), or by white dwarfs acquiring a mass in excess of the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.44 &quot;M&quot;☉, usually either as a result of a merger or by feeding off of a close binary partner. Above the Chandrasekhar limit, the gravitational pressure at the core exceeds the electron degeneracy pressure, and electrons begin to combine with protons to produce neutrons (via inverse beta decay, also termed electron capture). The result is an extremely compact star composed of &quot;nuclear matter&quot;, which is predominantly a degenerate neutron gas with a small admixture of degenerate proton and electron gases.

Neutrons in a degenerate neutron gas are spaced much more closely than electrons in an electron-degenerate gas because the more massive neutron has a much shorter wavelength at a given energy. This phenomenon is compounded by the fact that the pressures within neutron stars are much higher than those in white dwarfs. The pressure increase is caused by the fact that the compactness of a neutron star causes gravitational forces to be much higher than in a less compact body with similar mass. The result is a star with a diameter on the order of a thousandth that of a white dwarf.

The properties of neutron matter set an upper limit to the mass of a neutron star, the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, which is analogous to the Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarf stars.

=== Proton degeneracy ===

Sufficiently dense matter containing protons experiences proton degeneracy pressure, in a manner similar to the electron degeneracy pressure in electron-degenerate matter: protons confined to a sufficiently small volume have a large uncertainty in their momentum due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. However, because protons are much more massive than electrons, the same momentum represents a much smaller velocity for protons than for electrons. As a result, in matter with approximately equal numbers of protons and electrons, proton degeneracy pressure is much smaller than electron degeneracy pressure, and proton degeneracy is usually modelled as a correction to the equations of state of electron-degenerate matter.

=== Quark degeneracy ===

At densities greater than those supported by neutron degeneracy, quark matter is expected to occur. Several variations of this hypothesis have been proposed that represent quark-degenerate states. Strange matter is a degenerate gas of quarks that is often assumed to contain strange quarks in addition to the usual up and down quarks. Color superconductor materials are degenerate gases of quarks in which quarks pair up in a manner similar to Cooper pairing in electrical superconductors. The equations of state for the various proposed forms of quark-degenerate matter vary widely, and are usually also poorly defined, due to the difficulty of modelling strong force interactions.

Quark-degenerate matter may occur in the cores of neutron stars, depending on the equations of state of neutron-degenerate matter. It may also occur in hypothetical quark stars, formed by the collapse of objects above the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff mass limit for neutron-degenerate objects. Whether quark-degenerate matter forms at all in these situations depends on the equations of state of both neutron-degenerate matter and quark-degenerate matter, both of which are poorly known. Quark stars are considered to be an intermediate category between neutron stars and black holes.

== History ==

In 1914 Walther Nernst described the reduction of the specific heat of gases at very low temperature as &quot;degeneration&quot;; he attributed this to quantum effects. In subsequent work in various papers on quantum thermodynamics by Albert Einstein, by Max Planck, and by Erwin Schrödinger, the effect at low temperatures came to be called &quot;gas degeneracy&quot;. A fully degenerate gas has no volume dependence on pressure when temperature approaches absolute zero.

Early in 1927 Enrico Fermi and separately Llewellyn Thomas developed a semi-classical model for electrons in a metal. The model treated the electrons as a gas. Later in 1927, Arnold Sommerfeld applied the Pauli principle via Fermi-Dirac statistics to this electron gas model, computing the specific heat of metals; the result became Fermi gas model for metals. Sommerfeld called the low temperature region with quantum effects a &quot;wholly degenerate gas&quot;.

The concept of degenerate stars, stellar objects composed of degenerate matter, was originally developed in a joint effort between Arthur Eddington, Ralph Fowler and Arthur Milne. Eddington had suggested that the atoms in Sirius B were almost completely ionised and closely packed. Fowler described white dwarfs as composed of a gas of particles that became degenerate at low temperature; he also pointed out that ordinary atoms are broadly similar in regards to the filling of energy levels by fermions. In 1926, Milne proposed that degenerate matter is found in core of stars, not only in compact stars.
In 1927 Ralph H. Fowler applied Fermi&#x27;s model to the puzzle of the stability of white dwarf stars. This approach was extended to relativistic models by later studies and with the work of Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar became the accepted model for star stability.

<text>Germaine Tailleferre (; born Marcelle Germaine Taillefesse; 19 April 18927 November 1983) was a French composer and the only female member of the group of composers known as &quot;Les Six&quot;.

==Biography==
Marcelle Germaine Taillefesse was born at Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, Val-de-Marne, France, but as a young woman she changed her last name from &quot;Taillefesse&quot; to &quot;Tailleferre&quot; to spite her father, who had refused to support her musical studies. She studied piano with her mother at home, composing short works of her own, after which she began studying at the Paris Conservatory where she met Louis Durey, Francis Poulenc, Darius Milhaud, Georges Auric, and Arthur Honegger. At the Paris Conservatory her skills were rewarded with prizes in several categories. Most notably, Tailleferre wrote 18 short works in the &quot;Petit livre de harpe de Madame Tardieu&quot; for Caroline Luigini, the Conservatory&#x27;s Assistant Professor of harp.

With her new friends, she soon was associating with the artistic crowd in the Paris districts of Montmartre and Montparnasse, including the sculptor Emmanuel Centore who later married her sister Jeanne. It was in the Montparnasse atelier of one of her painter friends where the initial idea for &quot;Les Six&quot; began. The publication of Jean Cocteau&#x27;s manifesto &quot;Le coq et l&#x27;Arlequin&quot; resulted in Henri Collet&#x27;s media articles that led to instant fame for the group, of which Tailleferre was the only female member.

In 1923, Tailleferre began to spend a great deal of time with Maurice Ravel at his home in Montfort-l&#x27;Amaury. Ravel encouraged her to enter the &quot;Prix de Rome&quot; Competition. In 1926, she married Ralph Barton, an American caricaturist, and moved to Manhattan, New York. Barton, like Tailleferre&#x27;s father, did not support her musical pursuits. In her memoir, Tailleferre mentioned she barely did any composing during the 2 ½ years they were married. She remained in the United States until 1927, when she and her husband returned to France. They divorced shortly thereafter.

Tailleferre wrote many of her most important works during the 1920s, including her &quot;First Piano Concerto&quot;, the &quot;Harp Concertino&quot;, the ballets &quot;Le marchand d&#x27;oiseaux&quot; (the most frequently performed ballet in the repertoire of the Ballets suédois during the 1920s), &quot;La nouvelle Cythère&quot;, which was commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev for the ill-fated 1929 season of the famous Ballets Russes, and &quot;Sous les ramparts d&#x27;Athènes&quot; in collaboration with Paul Claudel, as well as several pioneering film scores, including &quot;B&#x27;anda&quot;, in which she used African themes.

Along with these pieces, Tailleferre also had experience with dance choreography thanks to her work with Jean Borlin on &quot;Le marchand d&#x27;oiseaux&quot;. Jean, the chief dancer and official choreographer of the Ballet Suédois, always encouraged composers of new ballets to add their own ideas to the choreography. She would later reminisce on the event, saying how she would dance and run across the stage in her enthusiasm and recklessness, kicking up dust as she went.

In 1931 she gave birth to her only child, daughter Françoise Lageat, with lawyer Jean Lageat. The couple married one year later and would later divorce in 1955 after years of separation.

The 1930s were even more fruitful, with the &quot;Concerto for Two Pianos, Chorus, Saxophones, and Orchestra&quot;, the &quot;Violin Concerto&quot;, the opera cycle &quot;Du style galant au style méchant&quot;, the operas &quot;Zoulaïna&quot; and &quot;Le marin de Bolivar&quot;, and her masterwork, &quot;La cantate de Narcisse&quot;, in collaboration with Paul Valéry. Her work in film music included &quot;Le petit chose&quot; by Maurice Cloche and a series of documentaries.

At the outbreak of World War II, she was forced to leave the majority of her scores at her home in Grasse, with the exception of her recently completed &quot;Three Études for Piano and Orchestra&quot;. Escaping across Spain to Portugal, she found passage on a boat that took her to the United States, where she lived the war years in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

After the war, in 1946, she returned to her home in France, where she composed orchestral and chamber music, plus numerous other works including the ballets &quot;Paris-Magie&quot; (with Lise Delarme) and &quot;Parisiana&quot; (for the Royal Ballet of Copenhagen), the operas &quot;Il était un petit navire&quot; (with Henri Jeanson), &quot;Dolores&quot;, &quot;La petite sirène&quot; (with Philippe Soupault, based on Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s story &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;), and &quot;Le maître&quot; (to a libretto by Ionesco), the musical comedy &quot;Parfums&quot;, the &quot;Concerto des vaines paroles&quot; for baritone voice, piano, and orchestra, the &quot;Concerto for Soprano and Orchestra&quot;, the &quot;Concertino for Flute, Piano, and Orchestra&quot;, the &quot;Second Piano Concerto&quot;, the &quot;Concerto for Two Guitars and Orchestra&quot;, her &quot;Second Sonata for Violin and Piano&quot;, and the &quot;Sonata for Harp&quot;, as well as an impressive number of film and television scores. The majority of this music was not published until after her death.

In 1976, she accepted the post of accompanist for a children&#x27;s music and movement class at the &quot;École alsacienne&quot;, a private school in Paris. During the last period of her life, she concentrated mainly on smaller forms due to increasing problems with arthritis in her hands. She nevertheless produced the &quot;Sonate champêtre&quot; for oboe, clarinet, bassoon, and piano; the &quot;Sonata for Two Pianos&quot;; &quot;Chorale and Variations for Two Pianos or Orchestra&quot;; a series of children&#x27;s songs (on texts by Jean Tardieu); and pieces for young pianists. Her last major work was the &quot;Concerto de la fidelité&quot; for coloratura soprano and orchestra, which was premièred at the Paris Opera the year before her death.

Germaine Tailleferre continued to compose right up until a few weeks before her death, on 7 November 1983 in Paris. She is buried in Quincy-Voisins, Seine-et-Marne, France.

In Britain, BBC Radio 3 broadcast five hours of biography and critique of Tailleferre&#x27;s works, in one of its series Composer of the Week, including recordings of her works (available as podcasts), in the final week of July 2023.

<text>Carl Wilhelm Wirtz (24 August 1876 in Krefeld – 18 February 1939 in Hamburg) was an astronomer who studied astronomy at Bonn University (1895-1898) obtaining his doctorate there after which he spent his time between the Kiel Observatory in Germany and the Observatory of Strasbourg, France. He is known for statistically showing the existence of a redshift-distance correlation for spiral galaxies.

== Scientific career ==

As already Vesto Slipher in 1912, Wirtz in 1918 observed a systematic redshift of spiral nebulae, which was difficult to interpret in terms of a cosmological model in which the Universe is filled more or less uniformly with stars and nebulae. Wirtz additionally used the equivalent in German of &quot;K correction&quot;. The term continues to be used in present-day observational cosmology, but Wirtz&#x27;s observational evidence that the Universe is expanding is not often mentioned. He wrote:

In 1922, he wrote a paper where he argued that the observational results suggest, that the redshifts of distant galaxies are becoming higher than more closer ones, which he interpreted as an increase of their radial velocities with distance, and that larger masses have smaller redshifts than smaller ones. In another note of the same year, he argued that counter-clockwise spiraling galaxies have smaller redshifts than clockwise spiraling ones. In 1924 he obtained more precise results, and interpreted them both as a confirmation of an increase of radial velocities with distance, but also as confirmation of a de Sitter universe, in which the increase of redshift is seen as caused by an increased time dilation in distant parts of the universe.

In 1936, Wirtz wrote a short paper alluding to the priority for his 1922-conclusion that the radial velocities of galaxies are increasing with their distance.

<text>The Observatory of Strasbourg is an astronomical observatory in Strasbourg, France.

== History ==
This observatory is actually Strasbourg&#x27;s third observatory: the first was built in 1673 on one of the city&#x27;s surrounding towers (the astronomer Julius Reichelt notably played a role in its establishment), and the second in 1828 on the roof of the buildings of the Academy.

Following the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, the city of Strasbourg became part of the German Empire. The University of Strasbourg was refounded in 1872, and a new observatory began construction in 1875, in the Neustadt district. The main instrument was a 50 cm Repsold refractor, which saw first light in 1880 (see Great refractor). At the time this was the largest instrument in the German Empire. In 1881, the ninth General Assembly of the Astronomische Gesellschaft met in Strasbourg to mark the official inauguration.

The observatory site was selected primarily for instruction purposes and political symbolism, rather than the observational qualities. It was a low-lying site that was prone to mists. During the period up until 1914, the staff was too small to work the instruments and so there was little academic research published prior to World War I. The main observations were of comets and variable stars. After 1909, the instruments were also used to observe binary stars and perform photometry of nebulae.

The observatory is currently the home for the Centre de données astronomiques de Strasbourg, a database for the collection and distribution of astronomical information. This includes SIMBAD, a reference database for astronomical objects, VizieR, an astronomical catalogue service and Aladin, an interactive sky atlas. The modern extension of the building used to house the &quot;Planétarium de Strasbourg&quot; until 2023, and the opening of a larger and more modern planetarium in the vicinity. The observatory is surrounded by the Jardin botanique de l&#x27;Université de Strasbourg.
In the vaulted basement below the observatory, a university-administered museum is located. Called &quot;Crypte aux étoiles&quot; (&quot;star crypt&quot;), it displays old telescopes and other antique astronomical devices such as clocks and theodolites.

<doc id="144434" wikidata="Q51717" url="?curid=144434" title="Baldwin I of Jerusalem">
<text>Baldwin I (1060s – 2 April 1118) was the first count of Edessa from 1098 to 1100 and king of Jerusalem from 1100 to his death in 1118. He was the youngest son of Eustace II, Count of Boulogne, and Ida of Lorraine and married a Norman noblewoman, Godehilde of Tosny. He received the County of Verdun in 1096, but he soon joined the crusader army of his brother Godfrey of Bouillon and became one of the most successful commanders of the First Crusade.

While the main crusader army was marching across Asia Minor in 1097, Baldwin and the Norman Tancred launched a separate expedition against Cilicia. Tancred tried to capture Tarsus in September, but Baldwin forced him to leave it, which gave rise to an enduring conflict between them. Baldwin seized important fortresses in the lands to the west of the Euphrates with the assistance of local Armenians. Thoros of Edessa invited him to come to Edessa to fight against the Seljuks. Taking advantage of a riot against Thoros, Baldwin seized the town and established the first Crusader state on 10March 1098. To strengthen his rule, the widowed Baldwin married an Armenian ruler&#x27;s daughter (who is now known as Arda). He supplied the main crusader army with food during the siege of Antioch. He defended Edessa against Kerbogha, the governor of Mosul, for three weeks, preventing him from reaching Antioch before the crusaders captured it.

Godfrey of Bouillon, whom the crusaders had elected their first ruler in Jerusalem, died in 1100. Daimbert, the Latin patriarch, and Tancred offered Jerusalem to Tancred&#x27;s uncle, Bohemond I of Antioch. Godfrey&#x27;s retainers took possession of the town and urged Baldwin to claim Godfrey&#x27;s inheritance. Since a Muslim ruler had captured Bohemond, Baldwin marched to Jerusalem, meeting little resistance. The Patriarch crowned him king in Bethlehem on 25December. He captured Arsuf and Caesarea in 1101, Acre in 1104, Beirut in 1110, and Sidon in 1111, with the assistance of Genoese and Venetian fleets and of several smaller crusader groups, but all his attempts to capture Ascalon and Tyre failed. After his victory at the third battle of Ramla in 1105, the Egyptians launched no further major campaigns against the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

Baldwin helped Bertrand, Count of Toulouse, to capture Tripoli in 1109. Being the only crowned monarch in the Latin East, Baldwin claimed suzerainty over other crusader rulers. Baldwin II of Edessa and Bertrand swore fealty to him. Tancred, who ruled the Principality of Antioch, also obeyed his summons. Baldwin supported Baldwin II and Tancred against Kerbogha&#x27;s successor, Mawdud, who launched a series of campaigns against Edessa and Antioch in the early 1110s. He erected fortresses in Oultrejordain—the territory to the east of the Jordan River—to control the caravan routes between Syria and Egypt. He died during a campaign against Egypt.

==Early life==

Born some time after 1060, Baldwin was the third son of Count Eustace II of Boulogne and Ida of Lorraine. Being his parents&#x27; youngest son, he was intended for a career in the Church. He studied the liberal arts and held prebends in the cathedrals of Cambrai, Rheims and Liège. For reasons that are unknown, and at an unspecified time, he abandoned his church career and became a knight. The historian John France says that Baldwin most probably realised that the Gregorian Reform had diminished his chance to seize rich benefices. Historian Susan B. Edgington, on the other hand, proposes that Baldwin preferred a secular career because his childless brother, Godfrey of Bouillon, duke of Lower Lotharingia, had taken ill suddenly, giving Baldwin a chance to inherit his duchy.

Baldwin married a Norman noblewoman, Godehilde of Tosny, whose family owned land and property in both Normandy and England. Baldwin and his wife most probably settled in the court of his eldest brother, Count Eustace III of Boulogne. Eustace and Baldwin jointly fought for their brother, Godfrey, against Count Albert III of Namur and Bishop Theoderic of Verdun at Stenay in 1086. Godfrey mentioned Baldwin in most of his charters of grant, indicating that Baldwin was regarded as his designated heir. Baldwin regularly visited the fortress of his wife&#x27;s family at Conches-en-Ouche.

==First Crusade==
Pope Urban II proclaimed the First Crusade at the Council of Clermont on 27November 1095. Godfrey of Bouillon decided to join the military campaign and sold or mortgaged his inherited domains to raise funds. One of his domains, the County of Verdun, was seized by Richer, Bishop of Verdun, who soon granted it to Baldwin. The dissolution of Godfrey&#x27;s allodial lands deprived all future dukes of the basis of their authority in Lower Lotharingia, which facilitated Baldwin&#x27;s decision to take the Cross. Eustace III of Boulogne also joined the crusade. According to a letter from Pope Urban, only the army that Peter the Hermit had mustered for the People&#x27;s Crusade outnumbered the three brothers&#x27; force.

Baldwin departed for the crusade with Godfrey&#x27;s army on 15August 1096. His wife and children accompanied him, suggesting that he had decided not to return to his homeland. The crusaders stopped at Tulln an der Donau before reaching the frontier of Hungary in September. Godfrey left Baldwin in charge of his troops during his conference with Coloman of Hungary, to discuss the conditions of the crusaders&#x27; march across the country. He agreed to hand over Baldwin, along with Baldwin&#x27;s wife and retainers, as hostages, to ensure their troops&#x27; good conduct. Baldwin and Godehilde were released soon after the crusaders left Hungary. They entered the Byzantine Empire near Belgrade in late November.

The crusaders reached Constantinople on 23December 1096. The Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos demanded an oath of allegiance from their leaders and imposed a blockade on their camp to enforce it. Baldwin made raids against the districts outside the walls of Constantinople, compelling Alexios to lift the blockade. The Emperor also agreed to hand over his son and heir, John II Comnenus, as a hostage, who was entrusted to Baldwin&#x27;s care.

Since the crusaders continued to resist the emperor&#x27;s demand, the Byzantines reduced the fodder and food supplied to them. Baldwin again attacked the suburbs and killed or captured dozens of Pecheneg guards. The crusaders realised that they could not defeat the imperial army and so yielded to the emperor&#x27;s demand. Their commanders (including Godfrey and Baldwin) swore fealty to Alexios and pledged that they would cede all conquered lands that the Seljuk Turks had seized from the Byzantines to the emperor&#x27;s representatives. The crusaders were transferred to a camp established on the road between Chalcedon and Nicomedia in Asia Minor, but Godfrey and Baldwin soon returned to Constantinople to be present when the commanders of a new crusader army did homage to Alexios. When a knight sat on the emperor&#x27;s throne during the ceremony, Baldwin &quot;took him by the hand and made him rise&quot; and severely reprimanded him.

After the crusaders defeated Kilij Arslan, the Seljuk Sultan of Rûm, in the Battle of Dorylaeum on 1July 1097, Baldwin and the Italo-Norman leader Tancred broke away from the main body of the army. They marched as far as Heraclea, where they again joined their fellows around 15 August. The crusaders became exhausted during their long march across Asia Minor and most of their horses died. To secure a supply of food and forage, Baldwin and Tancred were sent to the fertile plains of Cilicia. There they could count on the support of the local Armenians, especially as Baldwin had already been befriended by an Armenian nobleman, Bagrat.

Baldwin and Tancred led two separate contingents. Tancred was the first to leave Heraclea, accompanied by 100–200 troops; Baldwin and his 300 knights departed around 15September. Tancred arrived at Tarsus—an important center of commerce in Cilicia—on 21September. He persuaded the Seljuk garrison of Tarsus to raise his flag on the citadel, even before his troops were granted access to the town. Baldwin reached Tarsus on the following day. The Turks replaced Tancred&#x27;s banner with Baldwin&#x27;s flag and allowed Baldwin to take possession of two towers. Heavily outnumbered by Baldwin&#x27;s troops, Tancred decided not to fight for the town and rode off. Shortly thereafter, about 300 Norman knights arrived, but Baldwin denied entry to them, which enabled the Turks to attack and murder the Normans during the night. Baldwin&#x27;s own men blamed him for their fate and massacred the remnants of the Seljuk garrison. Fearful of vengeance, Baldwin took shelter in a tower, but finally convinced his soldiers of his innocence. A pirate captain, Guynemer of Boulogne, sailed up the Berdan River to Tarsus and swore fealty to Baldwin. He hired Guynemer&#x27;s men to garrison Tarsus and continued his campaign.

Tancred had meanwhile seized the prosperous town of Mamistra. Baldwin reached the town on around 30September. One of the most prominent Italian Norman crusaders, Richard of Salerno, wanted to take revenge for the Normans who had perished at Tarsus, which caused a skirmish between the soldiers of Baldwin and Tancred. This was the first occasion when crusaders fought against each other. After one or two men were killed and many more were injured or captured on both sides, Baldwin and Tancred made peace and Baldwin left Mamistra. He joined the main army at Marash, but Bagrat persuaded him to launch a campaign towards the River Euphrates across a region densely populated by Armenians. About 80–100 knights accompanied him when he again left the main army on 17October.

==Count of Edessa==
===Establishment===
The Armenians regarded Baldwin as a liberator. Two Armenian chiefs, Fer and Nicusus, joined him soon after he started his campaign. The local population massacred the Seljuk garrisons and officials, or forced them to flee. The Seljuks&#x27; fear of the crusaders contributed to Baldwin&#x27;s success. He seized two important fortresses, Ravendel and Turbessel, without a fight before the end of 1097. He made Bagrat the governor of Ravendel, and appointed Fer to administer Turbessel.

The Armenian lord of Edessa, Thoros, sent envoys—the Armenian bishop of Edessa and twelve leading citizens—to Baldwin in early 1098, seeking his assistance against the nearby Seljuk rulers. Being the first town to convert to Christianity, Edessa had played an important role in Christian history. Before departing for Edessa, Baldwin ordered the arrest of Bagrat, whom Fer had accused of secret correspondence with the Seljuks. Bagrat was tortured and forced to surrender Ravendel. Baldwin left for Edessa in early February, but troops sent by Balduk, the emir of Samosata, or Bagrat prevented him from crossing the Euphrates. His second attempt was successful and he reached Edessa on 20 February. Baldwin did not want to serve Thoros as a mercenary. The Armenian townspeople feared that he was planning to leave the town, so they persuaded Thoros to adopt him. Alone among the contemporary historians of the First Crusade, Albert of Aix claims that the local customs of adoption required Thoros to take Baldwin under his shirt. Strengthened by troops from Edessa, Baldwin raided Balduk&#x27;s territory and placed a garrison in a small fortress near Samosata.


Unlike the majority of the Armenians, Thoros adhered to the Orthodox Church, which made him unpopular among his Miaphysite subjects. Shortly after Baldwin&#x27;s return from campaign, the local nobles started plotting against Thoros, possibly with Baldwin&#x27;s consent (as is stated by contemporary chronicler Matthew of Edessa). According to Albert of Aachen, Constantine of Gargar, one of the conspirators, suggested to replace Thoros with Baldwin. A riot broke out in the town, forcing Thoros to take refuge in the citadel. Baldwin pledged to save his adoptive father, but when the rioters broke into the citadel on 9March and murdered both Thoros and his wife, he did nothing to help them. On the following day, after the townspeople acknowledged Baldwin as their ruler (or &quot;doux&quot;), he assumed the title of Count of Edessa, and so established the first Crusader state.

The Seljuks had captured Edessa from the Byzantines in 1087, but Alexios did not demand that Baldwin hand over the town. Historian Christopher MacEvitt argues that the local population did not regard Baldwin&#x27;s ascension as &quot;a change in regime, but the replacement of one strongman with vague Byzantine ties with another of the same ilk&quot;. The acquisition of Ravendel, Turbessel and Edessa strengthened the position of the main crusader army during the siege of Antioch, which was taking place at the same time. The fertile lands along the Euphrates secured a supply of food for the crusaders. The three fortresses also hindered the movement of the Seljuk troops towards Syria and Palestine.

===Consolidation===
Baldwin had to use his diplomatic skills to secure his rule in Edessa, because his retinue was small. He married the daughter of an Armenian lord named Taftoc (possibly the brother of Constantine of Gargar), according to William of Tyre, and encouraged his retainers to marry local women. Thoros&#x27; rich treasury enabled him to employ mercenaries and to buy Samosata from Balduk. Baldwin and Balduk&#x27;s treaty about the transfer of Samosata was the first friendly arrangement between a crusader leader and a Muslim ruler. Balduk settled in Edessa.

An Artuqid emir, Belek Ghazi, hired Baldwin to suppress a revolt in Saruj. When the Muslim burghers of the town approached Balduk to come to their rescue, Balduk hurried to Saruj, but it soon became apparent that his retinue was too small to resist a siege and both he and the townspeople yielded to Baldwin. Baldwin demanded Balduk&#x27;s wife and children as hostages, but Balduk refused to hand them over to him, for which Baldwin had him captured and executed.

Baldwin granted the &quot;usufruct&quot; of Turbessel and Ravendel to his brother Godfrey, to secure his and his retainers&#x27; accommodation during the siege of Antioch. The continued support that Baldwin provided his brother with increased his brother&#x27;s standing within the crusade army, proofing crucial during the crusade as food was many times scarce. Kerbogha, the governor of Mosul, gathered a large army to relieve the town. During his march towards Antioch, Kerbogha did not wish to risk allowing the crusaders to hold Edessa. He besieged Edessa for three weeks in May, but could not capture it. His delay enabled the crusaders to capture Antioch on 3June 1098. Antioch became the capital of a new Crusader state, the Principality of Antioch, with Tancred&#x27;s uncle, Bohemond of Taranto, as its first prince.

Baldwin levied high taxes, which made him unpopular among his native subjects. He also ignored the local nobles&#x27; advice and granted property to his retainers and other crusaders who moved to Edessa. A dozen Armenian chiefs plotted against Baldwin in December, and approached the nearby Seljuk emirs for assistance, but Baldwin learnt of the conspiracy and ordered the arrest of the conspirators. The two ringleaders were mutilated in accordance with Byzantine laws, but the others were allowed to redeem themselves for large fees. Nevertheless, Baldwin continued to appoint Armenian noblemen to important offices. He made the Armenian Ablgharib the commander of Bijerik, an important fort controlling the road between Edessa and Turbessel.

The main crusader army captured Jerusalem on 15July 1099. A week later, Godfrey of Bouillon was elected ruler of the city, but chose not to be crowned king. Baldwin decided to complete his pilgrimage and left Edessa for Jerusalem in November. At Buluniyas, he joined the pilgrims who had departed Antioch with Bohemond I and the papal legate, Daimbert of Pisa. Attacks by Muslim troops, fatigue and diseases caused heavy casualties during the journey, but most of the pilgrims reached Jerusalem on 21December. Four days later, Daimbert was elected and installed as the new Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. The new patriarch confirmed Godfrey and Bohemond in the possession of their lands, but no similar ceremony was recorded in connection with Baldwin. Baldwin and Bohemond left Jerusalem on 1January 1100. Duqaq, the Seljuk ruler of Damascus, sent forces to attack them, but the crusaders routed the Seljuk troops near Baalbek. Baldwin arrived back in Edessa in February.

Godfrey died unexpectedly on 18July 1100. He had extracted oaths from Daimbert and other leading crusaders that they &quot;would not confer the throne on anyone except his brothers or one of his blood&quot;, according to Albert of Aix. Warner of Grez, Godfrey&#x27;s most influential retainer, took possession of the Tower of David in Jerusalem to secure control of the city. Although Warner soon died, two other members of Godfrey&#x27;s court, Geldemar Carpenel and Arnulf of Chocques, sent a delegation to Baldwin, urging him to come to Jerusalem.

To prevent Baldwin from seizing Godfrey&#x27;s realm, Daimbert and Tancred sought assistance from Bohemond I of Antioch. Daimbert sent a letter to him, stating that Baldwin&#x27;s rule would &quot;bring about the downfall of the church and the destruction of Christianity itself&quot;, according to later chronicler William of Tyre. Bohemond, however, was captured by the Danishmend Gazi Gümüshtigin in the hills near Melitene around 15August. Baldwin hurried to Melitene and pursued the Danishmend for three days, but he was unable to rescue Bohemond. After his return, the Armenian lord of Melitene, Gabriel, swore fealty to him. Baldwin appointed fifty knights to defend the town.

==King of Jerusalem==
===Coronation===

News of Godfrey&#x27;s death reached Edessa shortly after Baldwin&#x27;s return from Melitene. His chaplain, Fulcher of Chartres, noticed that Baldwin &quot;grieved somewhat over the death of his brother, but rejoiced more over his inheritance&quot;. To finance his journey to Jerusalem, Baldwin seized gold and silver from his subjects. He appointed his relative, Baldwin of Le Bourcq, his successor in the county and Le Bourcq swore fealty to him.

About 200 knights and 300–700 foot-soldiers accompanied Baldwin when he left Edessa on 2October 1100. He spent four days in Antioch, but did not accept the local inhabitants&#x27; plea for him to administer the principality during Bohemond&#x27;s captivity. Duqaq of Damascus wanted to ambush him on the narrow road near the mouth of the Nahr al-Kalb River. The qadi of Tripoli secretly warned Baldwin, which enabled him to defeat the attack and rout the Damascene troops. Tancred hurried to Jerusalem to persuade the garrison to surrender the town to him, but he was barred from the town.

Baldwin reached Jerusalem around 9November. Daimbert withdrew to a monastery on Mount Zion, and the townspeople stopped Baldwin outside the walls and ceremoniously accompanied him to the Holy Sepulchre. Albert of Aix&#x27;s sporadic references suggest that Baldwin adopted the title of prince. Baldwin first raided the environs of Ascalon, which was still held by the Egyptians, then launched a punitive expedition against the bandits who had their headquarters in the caves near Jerusalem. He made an incursion across the River Jordan before returning to Jerusalem on 21 December.

Baldwin was reconciled with Daimbert who agreed to anoint and crown him king. The ceremony took place in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem on Christmas Day. Thereafter Baldwin was most frequently styled king. For instance, a charter of grant in 1104 referred to him as &quot;Baldwin, king of Judea and Jerusalem, and defensor of the Holiest Sepulchre of our Lord, Jesus Christ&quot;. In most of his charters, he also emphasised that he was Godfrey&#x27;s lawful heir.

===First successes===

When Geldemar Carpenel laid claim to Haifa, stating that Tancred had arbitrarily seized it, Baldwin summoned Tancred to Jerusalem, but Tancred did not recognise him as the lawful monarch. They agreed to meet at a river near Jaffa, but their meeting did not result in compromise. The conflict was resolved when Tancred was invited to Antioch to administer the principality on Bohemond&#x27;s behalf. Before leaving for Antioch in March, Tancred renounced his domains in Palestine, but also stipulated that the same domains should be granted in fief to him if he were to leave Antioch within fifteen months. Baldwin gave Haifa to Geldemar and the Galilee to Hugh of Fauquembergues.

A new papal legate, Maurice of Porto, came to Jerusalem in early March 1101. After Baldwin accused Daimbert of treachery and convinced Maurice to suspend him on 15April, Daimbert had to bribe Baldwin with 300 bezants to persuade the legate to restore him to his office. The towns along the coast which were still under Egyptian rule—Arsuf, Caesarea, Acre and Tyre—sent gifts to Baldwin to secure his benevolence.

Always in need of funds, Baldwin concluded an alliance with the commanders of a Genoese fleet, offering commercial privileges and booty to them in the towns that he would capture with their support. They first attacked Arsuf, which surrendered without resistance on 29 April, securing a safe passage for the townspeople to Ascalon. The Egyptian garrison at Caesarea resisted, but the town fell on 17May. Baldwin&#x27;s soldiers pillaged Caesarea and massacred the majority of the adult local population. The Genoese received one third of the booty, but Baldwin did not grant areas in the captured towns to them.

===Battles at Ramla===
While Baldwin and the Genoese were besieging Caesarea, the Egyptian vizier, Al-Afdal Shahanshah, started mustering troops at Ascalon. Baldwin moved his headquarters to nearby Jaffa and fortified Ramla to hinder any attempt at a surprise attack against Jerusalem. He demanded more funds from Daimbert to cover the costs of this defense, but the patriarch refused. During a passionate debate in the presence of the papal legate, Daimbert stated that Baldwin should not &quot;presume to make tributary and servant the holy Church&quot;. The legate persuaded Daimbert to promise that he would &quot;maintain thirty soldiers by a money agreement&quot;, but the patriarch failed to raise the promised amount.

The lightly armed and undisciplined Egyptian army approached Ramla in early September. The much smaller, but experienced and well-equipped crusader forces were the first to attack, at dawn on 7September. At least two of the five or six crusader corps were almost annihilated during the first phase of the battle, but Baldwin persuaded the remnants of his army to launch a fresh attack, surprising the Egyptians. After a short resistance, they fled in panic, pursued by the crusaders as far as Ascalon.

Roger Borsa, Duke of Apulia, sent money to Daimbert, partially for the recruitment of soldiers, but Daimbert retained the whole sum. After learning of this embezzlement, Baldwin convinced the papal legate to dismiss Daimbert in late 1101. Daimbert fled first to Jaffa, then to Tancred in Antioch. The vacancy enabled Baldwin to freely use the patriarch&#x27;s rich treasury.

Stephen, Count of Blois, Hugh of Lusignan and other survivors of the catastrophic crusade of the previous year came to celebrate Easter in Jerusalem in 1102. Shortly thereafter, a strong Egyptian army invaded the kingdom. On 17 May, and against all advice, Baldwin and a force of about 500 horsemen that included dozens of new crusaders, rode out to meet the Egyptians. In this second battle fought at Ramla, the Egyptians were the victors, and they forced Baldwin and his men to take refuge in Ramla. Baldwin escaped from the fortress before the Egyptians laid siege to it, leaving his troops to be killed or captured. He fled to Arsuf, after which an English pirate, Godric, took him to Jaffa, although the Egyptian army had blockaded it from the land. He went to Jerusalem to gather new troops and returned to Jaffa with more than 100 horsemen. However, only the arrival of a fleet filled with hundreds of English, French and German pilgrims forced the Egyptians to lift the siege on 27May. Baldwin wrote to Alexios I Komnenos, urging him not to obstruct their journey.

During the siege of Jaffa, Baldwin had sent envoys to Antioch and Edessa, seeking assistance from Tancred and Baldwin II. They arrived only after the Egyptians&#x27; withdrawal. Tancred tried to persuade the new papal legate, Robert of St Eusebio, to restore Daimbert, but Baldwin convinced Robert to discuss the issue with the local bishops and abbots. After the prelates unanimously stated that Daimbert had almost provoked a civil war and had abused his ecclesiastic authority, the legate allowed them to elect a pious priest, Evremar, as patriarch.

Baldwin laid siege to Acre in April 1103, but an Egyptian fleet relieved the town. He launched a raid against the bandits who had settled on Mount Carmel, but he was wounded in the kidneys and did not recover until the end of the year. After a fleet of Genoese and Pisan ships arrived at Haifa in April 1104, Baldwin made an alliance with their commanders and again besieged Acre. The town surrendered on 26May after Baldwin promised a free passage to those who wanted to move to Ascalon, but the Italian sailors plundered the wealthy emigrants and killed many of them. Baldwin wanted to punish the Genoese, but the patriarch mediated a reconciliation and Baldwin had to grant one-third of the town to them. Acre had always been the most important port of trade between Syria and Europe, and the harbour dues generated significant revenues for him.

Duqaq&#x27;s death on 14June led to internal conflict in Damascus. The atabeg (or regent) Toghtekin emerged as the ruler, but faced strong opposition. Baldwin promised to support Duqaq&#x27;s young brother Irtash against Toghtekin. His intervention brought about a rapprochement between the Sunnite Toghtekin and the Shiite Al-Afdal. After Egyptian horsemen and foot soldiers invaded the kingdom from the south, and Syrian mounted archers from the west in August 1105, Baldwin assembled the largest crusader army since the beginning of his reign. At his request, Patriarch Evremar displayed the True Cross before the army to strengthen the crusaders&#x27; self-confidence. They inflicted a decisive defeat on the Egyptian and Syrian armies at Ramla on 27August.

===Expansion===
The Egyptians failed to launch any major military campaigns against the Kingdom of Jerusalem, but they did continually raid Baldwin&#x27;s southern frontier. They massacred hundreds of pilgrims near Jaffa and defeated the governor of the town while Baldwin was fighting against Damascene troops in Galilee in October 1106. In 1107 the Egyptians attacked Hebron, but Baldwin forced them to lift the siege. The Egyptian raids did not prevent Baldwin from pursuing an expansionist policy. He compelled the governor of Sidon to pay a large tribute for a two-year truce in early 1106. Early the following year, he made a raid into Oultrejordain and forced the enemy to destroy a fortress recently built by Damascene troops to control the caravan routes. In August 1108 Baldwin and a band of Italian adventurers laid siege to Sidon, but the arrival of an Egyptian fleet and Turkish horsemen from Damascus forced him to abandon the siege. In late 1108, he concluded a ten-year truce with the Turkoman Emir of Damascus Toghtekin in exchange for one-third of state revenues from the northern regions of Oultrejordain.

Bertrand, Count of Toulouse came to Syria to claim the lands that his father, Raymond of Saint Gilles, had conquered around Tripoli. Bertrand&#x27;s cousin, William Jordan, who had ruled these lands since Raymond&#x27;s death, refused to cede them to him. Bertrand sought Baldwin&#x27;s assistance, while William Jordan secured Tancred&#x27;s support. Tancred had already outraged Baldwin II of Edessa through refusing to abandon Turbessel. Baldwin convoked an assembly to put an end to the crusader leaders&#x27; conflicts. Since neither Tancred nor Jordan were his vassals, he summoned them in the name of the &quot;whole church of Jerusalem&quot; to the castle of Mount Pilgrim near Tripoli. At the assembly in June 1109, Tancred agreed to abandon Turbessel in return for his restoration to his old domains in the Kingdom of Jerusalem (Galilee, Haifa and the Temple of the Lord). Tancred did not take possession of his old domain, which remained under Baldwin&#x27;s control. Raymond&#x27;s inheritance was distributed between Bertrand and Jordan, with Bertrand swearing fealty to Baldwin, and Jordan to Tancred.

The crusader leaders united their forces to complete the conquest of Tripoli begun by Raymond. On 26June, the Egyptian governor, Sharaf ad-Daulah, offered to surrender the town if a safe passage for those who wanted to leave the town was guaranteed. Baldwin accepted the offer, but he could not prevent the Genoese from killing all those inhabitants whom they could capture. Two-thirds of the town was granted to Bertrand of Toulouse who again took an oath of fealty to Baldwin. Baldwin captured Beirut on 13May 1110, with the assistance of Bertrand and a Genoese fleet. He was again unable to prevent a general massacre of the townspeople.

Mawdud, the atabeg of Mosul, and his allies invaded the County of Edessa during the siege of Beirut. After the fall of Beirut, Baldwin and Bertrand hurried to Edessa to fight against the invaders. Baldwin II of Edessa accused Tancred of having incited the Muslim rulers to take actions against him. Regarding himself as the leader of all the Crusaders, Baldwin ordered Tancred to join the campaign and make peace with Baldwin II, otherwise he would declare Tancred the enemy of Christianity. Since most crusaders supported the king, Tancred had no choice but to obey. The incident strengthened Baldwin&#x27;s suzerainty over Edessa. After the new reconciliation, the crusaders pursued Mawdud, but rumours about Muslim attacks against Antioch and Jerusalem forced them to stop the campaign. Before leaving the county, Baldwin suggested that the Christian (mainly Armenian) peasants should be transferred to the lands west of the Euphrates, because the Seljuk rulers had frequently raided the eastern regions. While the peasants were gathering at a ferry on the river, Mawdud made a sudden raid and massacred most of them.

Sigurd I of Norway—the first king to visit the Kingdom of Jerusalem—had meanwhile landed at Acre. Baldwin made an alliance with him and they laid siege to Sidon in October 1110. An Egyptian fleet routed the Norwegians, but the Doge of Venice, Ordelafo Faliero, and his fleet soon joined the crusaders and the town capitulated on 5December. Baldwin spared the lives of the townspeople and many of them moved to Tyre and Damascus. The following year Baldwin marched to Ascalon: to prevent a siege the Egyptian governor of the town, Shams al-Khalīfa, promised to pay 70,000 dinars as a tribute and allowed crusader troops into the citadel. However, the townspeople rose up against al-Khalīfa in July and his Berber guards joined the rioters, murdering him and the crusader troops.

Mawdud launched a new expedition against the northern crusader states in August. At Tancred&#x27;s request, Baldwin mustered his troops and hurried to the North. Bertrand of Tripoli, Baldwin II of Edessa and the Armenian rulers also came to fight against Mawdud, who was compelled to return to Mosul in the autumn. Shortly thereafter, Baldwin attacked a caravan that was travelling from Tyre to Damascus, carrying with it the city&#x27;s most precious possessions, and was able to carry off the rich cargo. In late November, he laid siege to Tyre, although he had no supporting fleet. He was still besieging the town when a Byzantine embassy arrived. The Byzantines tried to persuade him to join a coalition against Tancred, while he wanted to secure their assistance against Tyre. They could not reach a compromise, but Izz al-Mulk, the Egyptian governor of Tyre, persuaded Toghtekin to come to the rescue of the besieged town. Toghtekin compelled Baldwin to lift the siege and withdraw to Acre in April 1112.

Baldwin made an incursion against Damascene territory in 1113. Mawdud and an Artuqid emir, Ayaz, who came to assist Toghtekin against the crusaders, routed Baldwin in the Battle of al-Sannabra in late June, forcing him to seek assistance from the new rulers of Tripoli and Antioch, Pons and Roger. Toghtekin, Mawdud and Ayaz invaded Galilee, but they did not risk attacking Tiberias after the arrival of the troops from Tripoli and Antioch. Toghtekin and Mawdud returned to Damascus where an Assassin murdered Mawdud in late September. The Seljuk sultan, Muhammad I Tapar, sent a large army to northern Syria in spring 1115. In an attempt to maintain the equilibrium in the region, Toghtekin soon sought reconciliation with the crusaders. He made an alliance with the crusader rulers, and their coalition forced the Seljuk troops to withdraw without a fight.

With the pressure on the northern regions diminished, Baldwin was able to again deal with the Egyptians, who had already approached Jerusalem in 1113, and made a fresh attempt to capture Jaffa in 1115. Baldwin led an expedition across the Jordan and ordered the construction of the castle of Montreal in the autumn of 1115. The following year, he returned to the region and marched as far as Akaba on the Red Sea. After the local inhabitants fled from the town, Baldwin constructed castles in the town and on a nearby island and left a garrison in both fortresses. The three strongholds—Montreal, Eilat and Graye—secured the control of the caravan routes between Syria and Egypt. They also enabled Baldwin to continuously survey the movements of the Egyptian troops. From the Red Sea coast, Baldwin hastened to Tyre and began the construction of a new fortress, known as Scandelion Castle, at the Ladder of Tyre, which completed the blockade of the town from the mainland.

==Death==

Baldwin fell seriously ill in late 1116. Thinking that he was dying, he ordered that all his debts be paid off and he started to distribute his money and goods, but he recovered at the start of the following year. To strengthen the defence of the southern frontier, he launched an expedition against Egypt in March 1118. He seized Farama on the Nile Delta without a fight as the townspeople had fled in panic before he reached the town. The late-12th-century Muslim historian Ibn Zafar al Siqilli wrote that Baldwin ordered the mosques in the town to be levelled. Baldwin&#x27;s retainers urged him to attack Cairo, but the old wound that he had received in 1103 suddenly re-opened.

Dying, Baldwin was carried back as far as Al-Arish on the frontier of the Fatimid Empire. On his deathbed, he named Eustace III of Boulogne as his successor, but also authorised the barons to offer the throne to Baldwin of Edessa or &quot;someone else who would rule the Christian people and defend the churches&quot;, if his brother did not accept the crown. Baldwin died on 2April 1118. In accordance with his last wishes, his cook, Addo, removed his intestines and preserved his body in salt, so as to secure a burial in Jerusalem. He was buried in the Calvary Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre next to Godfrey of Bouillon five days later, on Palm Sunday.

==Legacy==
Fulcher of Chartres described Baldwin as his subjects&#x27; &quot;shield, strength and support; their right arm; the terror of his enemies.&quot; The Muslim historian, Ali ibn al-Athir, who completed his chronicle a century after Baldwin&#x27;s death, thought that &quot;al-Bardawil&quot; had started the First Crusade. Presenting a fictional correspondence between Baldwin and Roger I of Sicily, al-Athir claimed that Baldwin had initially wanted to conquer Ifriqiya, but Roger, who wanted to secure the territory for himself, talked him into attacking Jerusalem.

Among modern historians, Thomas Asbridge states that Baldwin was one of the commanders of the First Crusade &quot;whose skill, ambition and devotion drove the enterprise, and by turns threatened to rip it apart.&quot; Christopher Tyerman emphasises that Baldwin was a talented military commander and a clever politician, who &quot;established a stable kingdom with defined and defensible borders.&quot; Amin Maalouf also concludes that Baldwin was the &quot;principal architect of the occupation&quot; of the Holy Land by the crusaders. Maalouf attributes Baldwin&#x27;s success primarily to the &quot;incorrigible fragmentation of the Arab world,&quot; which made the crusaders a &quot;genuine regional power.&quot; Historian Christopher MacEvitt proposes that Baldwin was &quot;adept at navigating the complexities of a world of competing local warlords,&quot; because the &quot;political landscape&quot; of his homeland, with its castellans dominating the countryside, was &quot;not so different.&quot;

Baldwin&#x27;s earliest extant charters were issued in the early 1100s, but the establishment of a chancery took years. Initially, clerics from Baldwin&#x27;s homeland compiled the royal documents. The first chancellor, Pagan, was appointed only in 1115. Pagan had come to the Holy Land in the entourage of Baldwin&#x27;s third wife, Adelaide del Vasto. The Bardawil lagoons are named after Baldwin, who died in nearby El-Arish.

==Family==
Baldwin&#x27;s wife Godehilde, the daughter of Raoul II of Tosny and Isabella of Montfort-l&#x27;Amaury, died during the First Crusade around 15October 1097. Historian Malcolm Barber argues that her death &quot;may have been the decisive event that persuaded&quot; Baldwin &quot;to seek out a lordship in the East&quot;. According to the historians Steven Runciman and Christopher MacEvitt, Baldwin and Godehilde had children who did not long survive her, but historian Alan V. Murray emphasises that no primary source states that Baldwin fathered children. According to Murray, Runciman was wrong when he translated William of Tyre&#x27;s words about Baldwin&#x27;s &quot;familia&quot; as a reference to his family, because William of Tyre was referring to Baldwin&#x27;s household.

Uncertainty surrounds the name and family of his second wife, whom he married in the summer of 1098. Modern historians call her Arda and associate her father with Tathoul of Marash. Her father promised a dowry of 60,000 bezants and also pledged that she would inherit his lands, but he actually paid off only 7,000 bezants to Baldwin. The marriage was childless. Baldwin banished her to the convent of St Anne in Jerusalem before 1109, but she was soon allowed to move to Constantinople. Although they were separated, the marriage was never annulled.

Baldwin&#x27;s third wife, Adelaide, was the wealthy widow of Roger I of Sicily. Her first husband died in 1102 and she acted as regent for their minor sons until the end of 1111. She was more than forty years old when the marriage was proposed in 1112. According to William of Tyre, Baldwin wanted to marry her because he had learnt of her wealth, and even agreed to make her son, Roger II of Sicily, his heir in Jerusalem. She landed at Palestine in August 1113, accompanied by hundreds of soldiers and bringing her rich dowry. Their marriage was bigamous, because Baldwin&#x27;s second wife was still alive. After recovering from a serious illness in late 1116, Baldwin accepted clerical advice and sent an indignant Adelaide home. She sailed for Sicily on 25 April 1117. Her humiliation outraged Roger II so much that he denied all support to the Kingdom of Jerusalem during his lifetime.

Summarising Baldwin&#x27;s marriages, historian Jonathan Phillips concludes that Baldwin &quot;regarded women as useful sources of financial and political advancement but little else&quot;. Decades after Baldwin&#x27;s death, William of Tyre wrote that Baldwin was &quot;said to have struggled with weakness of the flesh&quot;, but only a few of his &quot;body-servants&quot; were aware of this. Historians Hans Eberhard Mayer, Christopher Tyerman and Malcolm Barber agree that William of Tyre most probably referred to Baldwin&#x27;s homosexuality. Tyerman adds that a converted Muslim was one of Baldwin&#x27;s lovers, but he betrayed Baldwin during the siege of Sidon. He proposed that the defenders of the town kill the king, but Baldwin was warned in advance. On the other hand, Susan B. Edgington states that there is &quot;little evidence to support&quot; the theories about Baldwin&#x27;s homosexuality, emphasizing that his contemporaries made no reference to it.

<doc id="144436" wikidata="Q2299139" url="?curid=144436" title="Uncle Ben">
<text>Benjamin Franklin &quot;Ben&quot; Parker, usually referred to as Uncle Ben, is a supporting character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, usually in association with the superhero Spider-Man (Peter Parker). He was the husband of May Parker and the paternal uncle and father figure of Peter Parker. After appearing in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #97 (January 1962), Uncle Ben made his first full appearance in &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 (August 1962), and was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko. He was modeled and named after American founding father Benjamin Franklin.

The character has been an essential part of Spider-Man&#x27;s history. His death at the hands of a petty criminal, whom Spider-Man previously had the chance to apprehend, but chose not to, has been depicted in most versions of the hero&#x27;s origin story, as the main factor that inspired Peter to become Spider-Man. Uncle Ben&#x27;s quote, &quot;With great power there must also come great responsibility&quot; (often paraphrased as &quot;With great power comes great responsibility&quot;), has become Spider-Man&#x27;s &quot;moral guide&quot; and iconic life motto.

The character has been substantially adapted from the comics into various forms of media, including films, animated series, and video games. He was portrayed by Cliff Robertson in Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy (2002–2007) and by Martin Sheen in the film &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; (2012). In December 2021, &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021) screenwriters Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers confirmed that Uncle Ben&#x27;s comic book role as Peter&#x27;s &quot;moral guide&quot; in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)—who tells him his life motto before being killed as a result of his actions—had instead been adapted to his aunt May Parker, portrayed by Marisa Tomei in five films from 2016 to 2021. Adam Scott portrays a younger Ben Parker in the Sony&#x27;s Spider-Man Universe (SSU) film &quot;Madame Web&quot; (2024).

==Publication history==
After first appearing in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #97 (January 1962)—caring for his niece (a mermaid named Linda Brown) with his wife May—Uncle Ben returned in &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 (August 1962)—caring for his nephew (Peter Parker / Spider-Man) with May—and was killed in the same issue. Although his history as a supporting character was very brief, Uncle Ben is an overshadowing figure in Spider-Man&#x27;s life, often appearing in flashbacks.

===Notability of death===
The murder of Uncle Ben is possibly the most notable in comic book history. He is also one of the few comic book deaths that has never been reversed in official continuity. He was a member of the &quot;Big Three&quot;, alongside Jason Todd (an associate of Batman) and Bucky (an associate of Captain America) whose notable deaths, along with Ben&#x27;s, gave rise to the phrase: &quot;No one in comics stays dead except for Bucky, Jason Todd, and Uncle Ben&quot;. Later, the revivals of both Bucky and Jason in 2005 led to the amendment, &quot;No one in comics stays dead except Uncle Ben&quot;. The violent killing of Uncle Ben, done by a common street criminal, also shares multiple similarities to the death of Thomas and Martha Wayne, the parents of Batman, which sometimes is included in the saying.

There have been examples of Uncle Ben remaining alive in alternative timelines, including stories featured in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;What If&quot; (one of which he forces Peter to unmask in front of J. Jonah Jameson), and a storyline of the 1994 &quot;Spider-Man&quot; animated series featured a universe where Uncle Ben had never died, and Peter Parker became a successful industrialist, having never really bothered to use his powers responsibly as everything always seemed to work out for him. This fact is used to defeat the rampaging Spider-Carnage by exposing him to the one person he will trust and listen to: the Uncle Ben of that reality.

A story-line in the official series &quot;Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man&quot; seemingly suggested that Ben may be alive. This Ben, however, was actually from a parallel universe where Aunt May died in a random accident, leaving him to raise Peter. This alternate Ben came to the planet Earth of regular &quot;Marvel&quot; comics (the 616 reality) as part of an evil plan devised by the Hobgoblin of 2211 to defeat the Spider-Men of different eras.

During the &quot;Clone Conspiracy&quot; storyline, when Peter&#x27;s clone Ben Reilly (who had taken Uncle Ben&#x27;s first name, along with Aunt May&#x27;s last, to differentiate himself from Peter) used the Jackal&#x27;s technology to revive several of Peter&#x27;s old enemies and allies, he offered to bring Uncle Ben back to life while trying to win Peter to his point of view. Although tempted at the offer, Peter concluded that the reason Reilly had not brought Uncle Ben back on his own was that he knew that Uncle Ben would disapprove of Reilly&#x27;s actions, as his plan would see everyone on Earth granted immortality, while dependent on him to supply the medication needed to stabilize their cloned bodies.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Ben Parker was born in Brooklyn, New York. He trained to be a military police officer, and also spent time as a singer in a band. He had known his future wife, May Reilly since their high school days, but she, in turn, was naively interested in a boy who was involved in criminal activities. When he came to her one night and proposed to her on the spot, Ben was there to expose him as a murderer, and to comfort the heart-broken May when the boy was arrested. Their relationship evolved into love, and they enjoyed a happily married life together. When Ben&#x27;s younger brother Richard Parker and his wife Mary were killed in a plane crash, Ben and May took in their orphaned son Peter and raised him as their own.

===Raising Peter===
Ben was very protective of Peter, going as far as fighting some of the bullies that tormented young Parker. Peter became friends with Charlie Weiderman in high school, a teen even more unpopular than he was. However, Charlie often provoked the trouble with the other teens. One day, he was chased to the Parker home by a group of bullies led by Rich and Ben intervened. Ben told them that if they wanted Charlie, they would have to go through him. Rich tried to, but was surprised by Ben&#x27;s army training. As soon as the bullies were gone, he told the boy that he was not welcome at the house or with Peter because of his provoking the bullies and not being able to tell the truth.

===Spider-Man and death===
In high school, a radioactive spider bite gave Peter superhuman powers. Creating the costumed identity of Spider-Man for himself, Peter sought first to exploit his newfound powers as a masked wrestler and then as a television star. Coming from a television appearance, Spider-Man saw a burglar being chased by a security guard. The guard called for Spider-Man to stop the robber, but the nascent Spidey refused on the grounds that catching criminals was not his job. The robber got away.

When Peter later returned home, he was informed by a police officer that his Uncle Ben had been killed by a burglar. Outraged, he donned his Spider-Man costume and captured the man only to realize to his horror that it was the same burglar whom he could have effortlessly captured earlier at the studio. As a result, Peter considered himself morally responsible for Ben&#x27;s death and resolved to fight crime as a superhero — realizing that with great power comes great responsibility — and vowing never to let another innocent person come to harm if he could help it.

===Legacy===
Ben&#x27;s death was truly avenged when the burglar returned for the money once more, threatening Aunt May. The burglar died from a heart attack upon beholding his old nemesis Spider-Man once again and learning that Spider-Man and Peter Parker were one and the same person.

In &quot;Amazing Spider-Man Family&quot; #7, May relates to Peter her account of meeting Ben for the first time.

Ben briefly appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #500; after Spider-Man played a vital role in preventing the resurrection of Dormammu, an unidentified higher power provided Doctor Strange with a small box that he felt he had to give to Spider-Man as a reward for his role in events. When Peter opened the box on the roof of his apartment building, it contained a note saying &quot;You have five minutes. Spend them as you will&quot;, followed by Ben appearing on the roof. It was revealed that this Ben – whether a ghost or Ben having been temporally relocated from the moment before his death – remembered being out for the walk that resulted in him getting shot but nothing afterwards, although he concluded that the events leading to him being on that roof were not important. In their talk Ben said that the only thing that would disappoint him about Peter is if Peter ever settled for less because he was afraid of reaching for more. This helps Peter to see that he had a good life for all its hardships, recognizing that he has always used what he has, and Ben assures Peter that he is proud of him before he vanishes.

During the 2008–2009 &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline, Uncle Ben makes an appearance in the Underworld when Hercules attends the trial of Zeus, directing Amadeus Cho as he attempted to find his parents in the afterlife. In the &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; storyline, Ben appears as an apparition to Spider-Man while battling a horde of demons and gargoyles, telling him that his death is not Peter&#x27;s or anyone&#x27;s fault. However, one enemy notices him and attacked only to disappear. This left Spider-Man puzzled if he was imagining Ben or he was really talking to his ghost.

When Ben Reilly adopted the identity of the Jackal and set up an elaborate plan to use Warren&#x27;s new cloning process to make the world immortal, he attempted to win Peter&#x27;s allegiance by showing him Ben&#x27;s coffin and offering to bring Ben back to life. However, although tempted by the idea, Peter realized that Ben never intended to bring &#x27;their&#x27; uncle back to life because he would have done it already, coldly informing his clone that Uncle Ben would tell Reilly that he was wrong, as he has the power without the responsibility. At the conclusion of the crisis, Peter takes a moment beside the coffin containing Ben&#x27;s corpse, acknowledging that Reilly&#x27;s actions were wrong but wishing that Uncle Ben was there regardless.

When Spider-Man finally confronts Kindred during the &quot;Last Remains&quot; arc, he finds that Kindred had dug up the bodies of Uncle Ben, Gwen Stacy, George Stacy, Ned Leeds, J. Jonah Jameson Sr., Jean DeWolff, and Marla Jameson and sat them around a dinner table.

==Other versions==
===Original appearance===
Lee and Ditko introduced the character of &quot;Uncle Ben&quot; alongside &quot;Aunt May&quot; in the June 1962 issue of &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #97, four months before his &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; debut. In the story &quot;Goodbye to Linda Brown,&quot; the characters are given no surname. They care for a young woman named Linda Brown who develops a sleepwalking habit, just like Ben and May used to have. When Linda sleepwalks to the sea in her wheelchair, she becomes a mermaid.

===&quot;Trouble&quot;===
A version of Ben appeared in the Mark Millar, Terry Dodson 2003 limited series, &quot;Trouble&quot;, with his brother Richie, who were involved with teenagers, May and Mary.

None of the characters&#x27; last names were revealed. The story did not become canon because of its negative reception.

===&quot;Bullet Points&quot;===
In this alternate reality, a young Ben Parker is working as a military policeman. He is assigned to security for Doctor Erskine, a scientist for the Captain America program. An assassination attempt on Erskine succeeds, killing Ben in the process. Later on, May still attempts to raise Peter on her own, but without the influence of Ben, Peter grows up to be angry, cynical and mean-spirited, going on to become the Hulk of this reality when he sneaks onto the test site that Rick Jones sneaked onto in the original version of events.

===Derailed Alt-Ben Parker===
In an alternate reality shown in &quot;Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man&quot;, an alternate reality was witnessed where May died in a random accident, prompting Peter to go into show business with Ben as his agent to make money. Peter&#x27;s focus on his career prompts him to eventually leave home, simply paying Ben a percentage out of respect for their old relationship rather than any actual concern. This Ben was eventually &#x27;derailed&#x27; into the 616 reality by the Hobgoblin of 2211 as part of her plan against the Spider-Men of various eras, leaving him shocked when he witnessed his destroyed house and the still-living May Parker. Confronting her, he ended up in a fight with Jarvis, with whom she at the time has a relationship with, but wandered away in confusion. Lacking direction, Ben wandered into an alleyway where he encountered a shadowy figure who offered him a gun, telling Ben that any action he takes would simply create another universe where he took the opposite action, so he might as well do what felt good. After this Hobgoblin was erased from history by a Retcon Bomb of her own invention, the Spider-Man of 2211 met with what he presumed to be the same Ben Parker to take him back to his own timeline. In a surprise twist, deciding he rather wanted to &quot;stick around for a while&quot;, this Ben Parker shoots this future Spider-Man. At the same time, another Ben Parker was shown dead in the alley, meaning one Ben Parker had killed the other and taken his place.

It was revealed that the Ben Parker who had died in the alleyway was the Uncle Ben of the alternate reality, while the Ben Parker who killed Spider-Man 2211 was, in fact, the Chameleon of 2211; the Chameleon had attempted to convince Ben to resort to murder, but Spider-Man correctly guessed that there were no circumstances under which Ben would do such a thing.

===&quot;House of M&quot;===
In the &quot;House of M&quot; reality, Ben Parker is alive and, like the rest of the world, is aware that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. After recovering Peter&#x27;s journal, with entries detailing that the world is not how it should be, Ben discovers that he is killed shortly after Peter gains his powers. He later helps Peter fake his death, photographing Spider-Man apparently hanging himself.

===&quot;Marvel Noir&quot;===
In the &quot;Marvel Noir&quot; reality, Ben Parker is a social activist who was murdered by the cannibalistic Vulture, one of the enforcer of crime lord Norman Osborn. He had previously been a decorated pilot and veteran of World War I, but he did not take pride in his service, believing that no just cause was fought for. His nephew Peter dons his old aviator uniform and wields his service revolver during his activities as Spider-Man.

===&quot;Spider-Verse&quot;===
During the &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; storyline, there are different versions of Uncle Ben that are featured:

* A version of Peter Parker named Patton Parnell lives with his abusive Uncle Ted on an unknown Earth. After the bite of an irradiated spider mutates him into an arachnid monstrosity, Patton infects his Uncle Ted with his offspring while declaring he taught him that &quot;With great power comes a great appetite&quot;.
* An alternate Uncle Ben from an unknown reality appears in a flashback along with his universe&#x27;s version of Aunt May. On Earth-14512, they are portrayed as scientists. They informed their niece Peni Parker that she was the only person able to carry on the project after her father, the original SP//dr, died in battle. She accepted the responsibility, allowing the radioactive spider that formed the other half of SP//dr&#x27;s CPU to bite her. During a fight against the kaiju M.O.R.B.I.U.S., Ben witnesses Addy Brock losing control of VEN#m. After SP//dr defeats VEN#m and finds that Addy and Aunt May aren&#x27;t inside, Ben visits Peni hours later and states that what happened to May and Addy wasn&#x27;t her fault. A portal opens as Spider-Ham requests Peni&#x27;s help. Ben convinces her to go as duty calls.
* In an unknown reality, Uncle Ben and Aunt May are with their nephew Peter at the hospital after he suffers an allergic reaction to the radioactive spider bite, leaving him in a coma. Because of this, they are out of their house when it&#x27;s burgled by the thief that killed Ben in the main universe. Peter transforms into Man-Spider and attacks Uncle Ben and Aunt May, but is thwarted by Spider-Man Noir. Six-Armed Spider-Man creates a cure for Peter, allowing him to live a normal life with Ben and May.
* The Earth-3145 version of Ben Parker was isolated in Ezekiel Sims&#x27;s bunker after Earth is decimated by nuclear fallout. Ben is later found by Silk, Spider-Man, and the other Spider-Men who arrive while fleeing from the Inheritors. They learn that Ben received his powers when he accompanied Peter to the science demonstration and was bitten by the spider instead of his nephew. However, Ben retired out of grief after his foe the Emerald Elf discovered his identity and killed his May and Peter. After entering Ezekiel&#x27;s bunker upon being told of the Inheritors, his Earth was decimated when a nuclear blackmail plot by Otto Octavius went wrong. Although he initially declines to join the other Spiders in their final attack on the Inheritors, Spider-Man and Superior Spider-Man convince him to do so by arguing that he has only failed if he gives up, Peter in particular affirming that the advice of his own Uncle Ben has saved his world and made a difference every day. He subsequently works with Spider-Ham to rescue Benjy Parker – the baby brother of Spider-Girl – and take him to another dimension for safety. When the crisis is averted, Ben accompanies Spider-Girl back to her home dimension, and decides to remain there so he can be the great-uncle that no other Ben Parker has had the chance to become.

===&quot;Spider-Geddon&quot;===
During the &quot;Spider-Geddon&quot; storyline, Earth-91918 has a version of Uncle Ben who is married to a Hispanic version of Aunt May. When he is shot by a mugger, Uncle Ben gains spider powers following a blood transfusion from his nephew. When Ben became a Spider-Man, he was a ruthless hero where he once severely beat up Kraven the Hunter.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The Ultimate Marvel version of Ben Parker differs slightly from the original iteration. Younger than his original counterpart, he is also a former hippie who wears his hair in a ponytail and teaches Peter Parker to be nonviolent. Ben also reminisces about the period he lived on a commune. After Peter went out for a walk, Peter learned from a police officer that Ben was murdered.

===Ultimate Universe===
On Earth-6160, Maker changed the past so that Peter never got his powers as a teenager and Ben was never killed by a mugger. His wife May would be killed as one of the casualties of a false flag attack on New York City orchestrated by The Maker&#x27;s Council. In the present, Ben Parker is still the managing editor of the Daily Bugle and Peter is happily married to Mary Jane Watson with two kids named Richard and May. Ben and his close friend J. Jonah Jameson quit the Bugle upon Wilson Fisk taking it over and interfering with their investigations concerning the attack. At the Bar with No Name, Ben and Jameson talk about starting an independent news company.

One month later, while in a Turkish bath, Ben Parker and J. Jonah Jameson talk about another attempt on Wilson Fisk&#x27;s life and the emergence of Spider-Man, which they consider a distraction used by the media.

Obtaining a lease for their building, Ben Parker and J. Jonah Jameson are visited by Peter Parker who notices their board filled with pictures regarding Wilson Fisk as he also explains that Robbie&#x27;s attempt to publish a story about the Green Goblin has been turned down, enticing their curiosity towards him.

While babysitting Richard and May, Ben Parker and J. Jonah Jameson talk about calling their independent news company &quot;The Paper&quot;. Richard later talks to Ben about May not being on good terms with J. Jonah Jameson.

In a parking garage, Ben Parker and J. Jonah Jameson meet with an informant who turns out to be their former co-worker Robbie Robertson as he gives them a dossier of information that will not be published at the Daily Bugle anyway. Ben and Jameson are told by Robbie that he will help them out while being their inside person.

===&quot;What If?&quot;===
Uncle Ben was featured in various issues of &quot;What If&quot;.

* In the first &quot;What If&quot; story regarding Spider-Man (named &quot;classic&quot;), it was Aunt May who went downstairs after hearing a noise, not wanting to wake up Ben. The same storyline plays out, with the burglar shooting May and Spider-Man apprehending him in the warehouse. In this story, Ben finds out about Peter&#x27;s activities as Spider-Man relatively soon, and talks to him about it. Peter explains to him when he donned the costume and why, even telling him about letting the would-be murderer go that very same night he robbed the wrestling register. Peter breaks down, saying how everything was his fault. Ben responds with anger at himself, being weak in not being able to protect &quot;his May&quot;. After Peter tells him he did not know and could not have possibly done anything, Ben instantly calms down and tells Peter to follow his own advice. He further inspires Peter to keep being Spider-Man, not because of regret or penance, but to protect and help all those who are weak and in need of help. Ben and Peter form an even closer relationship with Ben offering his support in many of Spider-Man&#x27;s future battles. Eventually Ben becomes outraged at Jameson&#x27;s constant smearing of Spider-Man&#x27;s name, considering it an insult to May&#x27;s memory. He eventually lets Jameson in on Spider-Man&#x27;s identity, forcing Jameson in a position he is uncomfortable in as a journalist. He cannot expose Spider-Man without endangering Ben Parker, yet he also does not wish to support vigilantism. Eventually, he finds a middle road and unofficially employs Spider-Man so he can gain inside scoops on crimes being solved in the city. The story eventually ends with Spider-Man saving Bennett Brant and Betty Brant from Doctor Octopus, as well as fighting a Green Goblin who kidnapped Jameson to find out Spider-Man&#x27;s real identity (having correctly surmised there was a reason Jameson had those inside scoops). At the end of it all, Peter and Ben shake hands with Jameson saying they will face all dangers and the future together.

==&quot;With great power, there must also come great responsibility&quot;==

Although it didn&#x27;t originate from any character, the quote &quot;with great power, there must also come great responsibility&quot; (commonly paraphrased as &quot;with great power comes great responsibility&quot; and adapted as such in some media) has been popularized by &quot;Spider-Man&quot; comics, and has become widely recognized as Spider-Man&#x27;s life motto.

* Ben is alluded to in &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;.
* &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; (2017) co-writer John Francis Daley confirmed that Ben exists in the MCU despite never being referenced directly. In an earlier draft of the film, May Parker mentions that Peter Parker&#x27;s wardrobe for his upcoming homecoming dance was Ben&#x27;s, but the scene was cut because the screenwriters did not want Ben&#x27;s death to be a throwaway line.
* An alternate reality variant of Ben is mentioned in the &quot;What If...?&quot; episode &quot;What If... Zombies?!&quot;.
* While developing &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021), writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers realized that May would adopt Ben&#x27;s comic book role as she had served as Peter&#x27;s &quot;moral guide&quot; throughout the MCU. As such, she is killed by the Green Goblin and tells Peter &quot;with great power, there must also come great responsibility&quot; before she dies. In a subsequent interview, McKenna and Sommers indicated that while an MCU Ben Parker had existed, he did not meet the same fate as Aunt May.

===Video games===

==Franklin Richards&#x27;s Uncle Ben==
Franklin Richards of the Fantastic Four often refers to Benjamin Grimm, the Thing, as &quot;Uncle Ben&quot; (Grimm is the best friend of Franklin&#x27;s father Reed Richards). Franklin Richards and Peter Parker also have the same middle name, Benjamin, as the Thing and Ben Parker are their namesakes. Spider-Man is aware of this, and told Franklin, &quot;Uncle Bens are always right.&quot;

==Son of Spider-Man==
In &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #498–500, Spider-Man falls through time, encountering all of his enemies from the past, and sees himself in the future. The future Peter Parker tells him that he should tell Mary Jane Watson and their son that he loves them every day. &quot;Our son is called Ben&quot;, he says, &quot;but it would pretty much have to be, wouldn&#x27;t it?&quot; However, because of the way time-travel in the Marvel universe works, this is only a potential future and not necessarily a definite one (this future being even more unlikely after the events of &quot;One More Day&quot;).

==The Other Uncle Ben==

Like her father, Spider-Girl also has an Uncle Ben. However, unlike her dad, May never knew her uncle: Ben Reilly, Spider-Man&#x27;s clone. If Spider-Girl has any children in the future, they too would have an Uncle Ben – May&#x27;s baby brother. Ironically in the aftermath of &quot;Spider-Verse&quot;, the Earth-3145&#x27;s Ben Parker himself would stay on her world, and has a chance to be his grandfather, something that the other Ben Parkers were unable to achieve on account of their deaths.

<doc id="144439" wikidata="Q45662" url="?curid=144439" title="Klemens von Metternich">
<text>Klemens Wenzel Nepomuk Lothar, Prince of Metternich-Winneburg zu Beilstein ( ; 15 May 1773 – 11 June 1859), known as Klemens von Metternich () or Prince Metternich, was a German statesman and diplomat in the service of the Austrian Empire. A conservative, Metternich was at the center of the European balance of power known as the Concert of Europe for three decades as Austrian foreign minister from 1809 and chancellor from 1821 until the liberal Revolutions of 1848 forced his resignation.

Born into the House of Metternich in 1773 as the son of a diplomat, Metternich received a good education at the universities of Strasbourg and Mainz. Metternich rose through key diplomatic posts, including ambassadorial roles in the Kingdom of Saxony, the Kingdom of Prussia, and especially Napoleonic France. One of his first assignments as Foreign Minister was to engineer a détente with France that included the marriage of Napoleon to the Austrian archduchess Marie Louise. Soon after, he engineered Austria&#x27;s entry into the War of the Sixth Coalition on the Allied side, signed the Treaty of Fontainebleau that sent Napoleon into exile and led the Austrian delegation at the Congress of Vienna that divided post-Napoleonic Europe amongst the major powers. For his service to the Austrian Empire, he was given the title of Prince in October 1813.

Under his guidance, the &quot;Metternich system&quot; of international congresses continued for another decade as Austria aligned itself with Russia and to a lesser extent Prussia. This marked the high point of Austria&#x27;s diplomatic importance and thereafter Metternich slowly slipped into the periphery of international diplomacy. At home, Metternich held the post of Chancellor of State from 1821 until 1848 under both Francis I and his son Ferdinand I. After a brief exile in London, Brighton, and Brussels that lasted until 1851, he returned to the Viennese court, only this time to offer advice to Ferdinand&#x27;s successor, Franz Josef. Having outlived his generation of politicians, Metternich died at the age of 86 in 1859.

A traditional conservative, Metternich was keen to maintain the balance of power, particularly by resisting Russian territorial ambitions in Central Europe and the Ottoman Empire. He disliked liberalism and strove to prevent the breakup of the Austrian Empire, for example, by crushing nationalist revolts in Austrian northern Italy. At home, he pursued a similar policy, using censorship and a wide-ranging spy network to suppress unrest.

Metternich has been both praised and heavily criticized for the policies he pursued. His supporters pointed out that he presided over the &quot;Austrian system&quot; when international diplomacy helped prevent major wars in Europe. His qualities as a diplomat were commended, some noting that his achievements were considerable in light of the weakness of his negotiating position. Meanwhile, his detractors argued that he could have done much to secure Austria&#x27;s future, and he was deemed a stumbling block to reforms in Austria. Metternich was also a supporter of the arts, taking a particular interest in music; he knew some of the most eminent composers in Europe at the time including Haydn, Beethoven, Rossini, Paganini, Liszt, and Strauss.

==Early life==
Klemens Metternich was born into the old Rhenish House of Metternich on 15 May 1773 to Franz Georg Karl Count of Metternich-Winneburg zu Beilstein (1746–1818), a diplomat who had passed from the service of the Electorate of Trier to that of the Imperial court, and his wife Countess Maria Beatrix Aloisia von Kageneck (1755–1828). He was named in honour of Prince Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony, the archbishop-elector of Trier and the past employer of his father. He was the eldest son and had one older sister Pauline (1772–1855), wife of Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of Württemberg. At the time of his birth, the family possessed a ruined keep at Beilstein, a castle at Winneberg, an estate west of Koblenz, and another in Königswart, Bohemia, won during the 17th century. At this time Metternich&#x27;s father, described as &quot;a boring babbler and chronic liar&quot; by a contemporary, was the Austrian ambassador to the courts of the three Rhenish electors (Trier, Cologne and Mainz). Metternich&#x27;s education was handled by his mother, heavily influenced by their proximity to France; Metternich spoke French better than German. As a child he went on official visits with his father and, under the direction of Protestant tutor John Frederick Simon, was tutored in academic subjects, swimming, and horsemanship.

In the summer of 1788, Metternich began studying law at the University of Strasbourg, matriculating on 12 November. While a student he was for some time accommodated by Prince Maximilian of Zweibrücken, the future King of Bavaria. At this time he was described by Simon as &quot;happy, handsome and lovable&quot;, though contemporaries would later recount how he had been a liar and a braggart. Metternich left Strasbourg in September 1790 to attend Leopold II&#x27;s October coronation in Frankfurt, where he performed the largely honorific role of Ceremonial Marshal to the Catholic Bench of the College of the Counts of Westphalia. There, under the wing of his father, he met with the future Francis II.

Between the end of 1790 and summer of 1792 Metternich studied law at the University of Mainz, receiving a more conservative education than at Strasbourg, a city unsafe to return to due to the unfolding French Revolution, which had begun in 1789. In the summers he worked with his father, who had been appointed plenipotentiary and effective ruler of the Austrian Netherlands. In March 1792 Francis succeeded as Holy Roman Emperor and was crowned in July, affording Metternich a reprise of his earlier role of Ceremonial Marshal.

In the meantime France had declared war on Austria, beginning the War of the First Coalition (1792–7) and making Metternich&#x27;s further study in Mainz impossible. Now in the employment of his father, he was sent on a special mission to the front. Here he led the interrogation of the French Minister of War the Marquis de Beurnonville and several accompanying National Convention commissioners. Metternich observed the siege and fall of Valenciennes, later looking back on these as substantial lessons about warfare. In early 1794 he was sent to England, ostensibly on official business helping Viscount Desandrouin, the Treasurer-General of the Austrian Netherlands, to negotiate a loan.

==Marriage and the Congress of Rastatt==
In England, he met King George III on several occasions and dined with a number of influential British politicians, including William Pitt, Charles James Fox and Edmund Burke. He also dined with the renowned composer Joseph Haydn and his impresario Johann Peter Salomon after seeing several of their concerts at Hanover Square. It was at one of these concerts where he recognized his one-time teacher, Andreas Hofmann in the audience who went to spy on England for the French. Metternich was nominated the new Minister Plenipotentiary to the Austrian Netherlands and left England in September 1794. On arrival, he found an exiled and powerless government in a headlong retreat from the latest French advance. In October a revitalised French army swept into Germany and annexed all of the Metternich estates except Königswart. Disappointed, and affected by strong criticism of his father&#x27;s policies, he joined his parents in Vienna in November. On 27 September 1795 he married Countess Eleonore von Kaunitz-Rietberg (1775–1825), daughter of Ernst Christoph, Fürst von Kaunitz-Rietberg (1737–1797) and Princess Maria Leopoldine zu Oettingen-Spielberg (1741–1795), a granddaughter of former Austrian chancellor Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg. The marriage was arranged by Metternich&#x27;s mother and introduced him to Viennese society. This was undoubtedly part of the motivation for Metternich, who demonstrated less affection for her than she for him. Two conditions were imposed by the father of the bride, Prince Kaunitz: first, the still youthful Eleonore was to continue to live at home; and second, Metternich was forbidden from serving as a diplomat as long as the Prince was still alive. Their daughter Maria was born in January 1797.

After Metternich&#x27;s studies in Vienna, the Prince&#x27;s death in September 1797 allowed Metternich to participate in the Congress of Rastatt. Initially his father, who headed the imperial delegation, took him as a secretary while ensuring that, when proceedings officially started in December 1797, he was named the representative of the Catholic Bench of the College of the Counts of Westphalia. A bored Metternich remained at Rastatt in this role until 1799 when the congress was finally wound down. During this period Eleonore had chosen to live with Metternich at Rastatt: and gave birth to sons Francis (February 1798) and, shortly after the end of the Congress, Klemens (June 1799). Much to Metternich&#x27;s anguish, Klemens died after only a few days, and Francis soon contracted a lung infection from which he would never recover.

==Ambassador==

===Dresden and Berlin===
The Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s defeat in the War of the Second Coalition shook up diplomatic circles, and the promising Metternich was now offered a choice between three ministerial positions: to the Imperial Diet at Regensburg; to the Kingdom of Denmark at Copenhagen; or to the Electorate of Saxony at Dresden. He chose Dresden in late January 1801, and his appointment was officially announced in February. Metternich summered in Vienna, where he wrote his &quot;Instructions&quot;, a memorandum showing a much greater understanding of statesmanship than his earlier writing. He visited the Königswart estate in the autumn before taking up his new position on 4 November. The subtleties of the memorandum were lost on the Saxon court, which was headed by the retiring Frederick Augustus I, a man with little political initiative. Despite the boredom of the court, Metternich enjoyed the light-hearted frivolity of the city and took up a mistress, Princess Katharina Bagration-Mukhranska, who bore him a daughter, Marie-Clementine. In January 1803 Metternich and his wife had a child whom they named Viktor. In Dresden Metternich also made a number of important contacts including Friedrich Gentz, a publicist who would serve Metternich as both confidant and critic for the next thirty years. He also established links with important Polish and French political figures.

To compensate for the loss of the Metternich&#x27;s ancestral estates in the Moselle valley when the French Republic annexed the west bank of the Rhine, the Imperial Recess of 1803 brought Metternich&#x27;s family new estates in Ochsenhausen, the title of Prince, and a seat in the Imperial Diet. In the ensuing diplomatic reshuffle Metternich was appointed ambassador to the Kingdom of Prussia, being notified of this in February 1803 and taking his position in November of that year.

He arrived in Prussia at a critical juncture in European diplomacy, soon growing worried about the territorial ambitions of Napoleon Bonaparte, newly the leader of France. This fear was shared by the Russian court under Alexander I, and the Tsar kept Metternich informed of Russian policy. By autumn of 1804 Vienna decided on action entered into in August 1805 when the Austrian Empire (as the Habsburg monarchy was in the process of becoming) began its involvement in the War of the Third Coalition. Metternich&#x27;s now almost impossible task was to convince Prussia to join the coalition against Bonaparte. Their eventual agreement was not due to Metternich, however, and after the coalition&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz, Prussia disregarded the agreement and signed a treaty with the French instead.

===Paris===
In the ensuing reshuffle in Vienna Johann Philipp Stadion, Count von Warthausen became the Foreign Minister of Austrian Empire, freeing Metternich to assume the post of Ambassador to the Russian Empire. He never made it to Russia, as need had arisen for a new Austrian at the French court. Metternich was approved for the post in June 1806. He enjoyed being in demand and was happy to be sent to France on a generous salary of 90,000 florins a year. After an arduous trip he took up residence in August 1806, being briefed by Baron von Vincent and Engelbert von Floret, whom he would retain as a close adviser for two decades. He met French foreign minister Prince Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord on 5 August and Napoleon himself five days later at Château de Saint-Cloud. The War of the Fourth Coalition drew both Talleyrand and Napoleon eastwards.

After the Treaties of Tilsit of July 1807 Metternich saw that Austria&#x27;s position in Europe was much more vulnerable but believed the accord between Russia and France would not last. In the meantime he found the new French Foreign Minister, Jean-Baptiste Champagny unaccommodating and struggled to negotiate a satisfactory settlement over the future of several French forts on the River Inn. Over the following months the reach of Austrian policy, and Metternich&#x27;s own reputation, increased.
In a memorable event, Metternich argued with Napoleon at Napoleon&#x27;s 39th birthday celebrations in August 1808 over the increasingly obvious preparations for war on both sides. Soon after, Napoleon refused Metternich&#x27;s attendance at the Congress of Erfurt. Metternich was later glad to hear from Talleyrand that Napoleon&#x27;s attempts at the Congress to get Russia to invade Austria had proved unsuccessful.

In a report to Stadion, Metternich the ambassador concluded that the House of Hohenzollern had been relegated and that Austria&#x27;s situation had worsened. The Confederation of the Rhine was hostile to Austria and a military conflict with France would have to be fought on two fronts between the Weichsel river and the Inn river. Metternich continued to oppose a war with France and pointed out that the government in Vienna only needed to wait, as Napoleon had no plans for his own succession.

==Foreign minister==

===Détente with France===
Now back in Austria, Metternich witnessed first hand the Austrian army&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Wagram in 1809. Stadion tendered his resignation as Foreign Minister in the aftermath, and the emperor immediately offered the post to Metternich. Metternich, worried that Napoleon would seize on this to demand harsher peace terms, instead agreed to become a minister of state (which he did on 8 July) and to lead negotiations with the French on the understanding that he would replace Stadion as Foreign Minister at a later date. During peace talks at Altenburg, Metternich put forward pro-French proposals to save the Austrian monarchy. Napoleon, however, disliked his position on the future of Poland, and Metternich was gradually displaced from the proceedings by Prince Liechtenstein. He soon regained influence, however, on 8 October, as Foreign Minister (and additionally that of Minister of the Imperial Household). In early 1810 Metternich&#x27;s earlier affair with Junot became public but, because of Eleonore&#x27;s understanding, the scandal was minimal.

One of Metternich&#x27;s first tasks was to push for the marriage of Napoleon to Archduchess Marie Louise rather than to the Tsar&#x27;s youngest sister Anna Pavlovna. Metternich would later seek to distance himself from the marriage by claiming it was Napoleon&#x27;s own idea, but this is improbable; in any case, he was happy to claim responsibility at the time. By 7 February Napoleon had agreed and the pair were married by proxy on 11 March. Marie Louise left for France soon after and Metternich followed by a different route and unofficially. The trip was designed, Metternich explained, to transport his family (stranded in France by the outbreak of war) home and to report to the Austrian Emperor about Marie Louise&#x27;s activities.

Instead, Metternich stayed six months, entrusting his office in Vienna to his father. He set about using the marriage, and flattery, to renegotiate the terms set out in the Treaty of Schönbrunn. The concessions he won were trivial, however: a few trading rights, delay in the payment of the war indemnity, restitution of some estates belonging to Germans in the Austrian service, including the Metternich family&#x27;s, and the lifting of a 150,000-man limit on the Austrian army. The last was particularly welcomed as a sign of increased Austrian independence, although Austria could no longer afford an army greater than the limit prescribed.

====As France&#x27;s ally====
When Metternich returned to Vienna in October 1810, he was no longer as popular. His influence was limited to foreign affairs, and his attempts to get a full Council of State reintroduced had failed. Convinced that a much weakened Austria should avoid another invasion by France, he rejected the advances of Tsar Alexander and instead concluded an alliance with Napoleon on 14 March 1812. He also supported a period of moderate censorship, aimed at preventing provocation of the French. Requiring that only 30,000 Austrian troops fight alongside the French, the alliance treaty was more generous than the one Prussia had signed a month earlier; this allowed Metternich to give both Britain and Russia assurances that Austria remained committed to curbing Napoleonic ambitions. He accompanied his sovereign for a final meeting with Napoleon at Dresden in May 1812 before Napoleon embarked upon the French invasion of Russia.

The Dresden meeting revealed that Austria&#x27;s influence in Europe had reached its lowest point, and Metternich was now bent on re-establishing that influence by using what he considered strong ties with all sides in the war, proposing general peace talks headed by Austria. Over the next three months, he would slowly distance Austria from the French cause, while avoiding alliance with either Prussia or Russia, and remaining open to any proposal that would secure a place for the combined Bonaparte-Habsburg dynasty. This was driven by concern that if Napoleon were defeated, Russia and Prussia would stand to gain too much. Napoleon was intransigent, however, and the fighting (now officially the War of the Sixth Coalition) continued. Austria&#x27;s alliance with France ended in February 1813, and Austria then moved to a position of armed neutrality.

====As a neutral====
Metternich was much less keen on turning against France than many of his contemporaries (though not the Emperor), and he favoured his own plans for a general settlement. In November 1813 he offered Napoleon the Frankfurt proposals, which would allow Napoleon to remain Emperor but would reduce France to its &quot;natural frontiers&quot; and undo its control of most of Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands. Napoleon, victorious at the Battles of Lutzen and Bautzen, delayed too long and lost this opportunity; by December he had been defeated at the Battle of Leipzig and the Allies had withdrawn the offer. By early 1814, as they were closing in on Paris, Napoleon agreed to the Frankfurt proposals, too late, and he rejected the new, harsher terms then proposed.

Nevertheless, the Allies were not faring well, and although a statement of general war aims that included many nods to Austria was secured from Russia, Britain remained distrustful and generally unwilling to give up the military initiative she had fought 20 years to establish. Despite this, Francis created the Austrian Foreign Minister Grand-Chancellor of the Order of Maria Theresa, a post which had been vacant since the time of Kaunitz. Metternich increasingly worried that Napoleon&#x27;s retreat would bring with it disorder that would harm the Habsburgs. A peace had to be concluded soon, he believed. Since Britain could not be coerced, he sent proposals to France and Russia only. These were rejected, though, after the battles of Battle of Lützen (2 May) and Battle of Bautzen (20–21 May), a French-initiated truce was called. Starting in April Metternich began to &quot;slowly and reluctantly&quot; prepare Austria for war with France; the armistice provided Austria time for fuller complete mobilisation.

In June, Metternich left Vienna to personally handle negotiations at Gitschin in Bohemia. When he arrived he benefitted from the hospitality of Princess Wilhelmine, Duchess of Sagan and began an affair with her that lasted several months. No other mistress ever achieved such influence over Metternich as Wilhelmine, and he would continue to write to her after their separation. Meanwhile, French Foreign Minister Hugues-Bernard Maret remained elusive, though Metternich did manage to discuss the state of affairs with the Tsar on 18–19 June at Opotschna. In talks which would later be ratified as the Reichenbach Convention they agreed on general peace demands and set out a process by which Austria could enter the war on the Coalition side. Shortly afterwards Metternich was invited to join Napoleon at Dresden, where he could put the terms directly. Though no reliable record of their meeting on 26 June 1813 exists, it seems it was a stormy but effective meeting. The agreement was finally reached as Metternich was about to leave: peace talks would start in Prague in July and run until 20 August. In agreeing to this Metternich had ignored the Reichenbach Convention, and this angered Austria&#x27;s Coalition allies. The Conference of Prague would never properly meet since Napoleon gave his representatives Armand Caulaincourt and the Count of Narbonne insufficient powers to negotiate. At the informal discussions held in lieu of the conference, Caulaincourt implied that Napoleon would not negotiate until an allied army threatened France itself. This convinced Metternich, and, after an ultimatum Metternich issued to France went unheeded, Austria declared war on 12 August.

====As a coalition partner====
Austria&#x27;s allies saw the declaration as an admission that Austria&#x27;s diplomatic ambitions had failed, but Metternich viewed it as one move in a much longer campaign. For the rest of the war he strove to hold the Coalition together and, as such, to curb Russian momentum in Europe. To this end he won an early victory as an Austrian general, the Prince of Schwarzenberg, was confirmed supreme commander of the Coalition forces rather than Tsar Alexander I. He also succeeded in getting the three allied monarchs (Alexander, Francis and Prussia&#x27;s Frederick William III) to follow him and their armies on campaign. With the Treaty of Töplitz, Metternich allowed Austria to remain uncommitted over the future of France, Italy, and Poland. He was still confined, however, by the British, who were subsidizing Prussia and Russia (in September Metternich requested subsidies for Austria as well). Meanwhile, the Coalition forces took the offensive. On 18 October 1813 Metternich witnessed the successful Battle of Leipzig and, two days later, he was rewarded for his &quot;wise direction&quot; with the rank of prince (). Metternich was delighted when Frankfurt was retaken in early November and, in particular, by the deference the Tsar showed Francis at a ceremony organised there by Metternich. Diplomatically, with the war drawing to a close, he remained determined to prevent the creation of a strong, unified German state, even offering Napoleon generous terms in order to retain him as a counterweight. On 2 December 1813 Napoleon agreed to talk, though these talks were delayed by the need for the participation of a more senior British diplomat, (Viscount Castlereagh).

Before talks could begin, Coalition armies crossed the Rhine on 22 December. Metternich retired from Frankfurt to Breisgau to celebrate Christmas with his wife&#x27;s family before travelling to the new Coalition headquarters at Basel in January 1814. Quarrels with Tsar Alexander, particularly over the fate of France This rivalry intensified in January, prompting Alexander to storm out. He therefore missed the arrival of Castlereagh in mid-January. Metternich and Castlereagh formed a good working relationship and then met with Alexander at Langres. The Tsar remained unaccommodating however, demanding a push into the centre of France; but he was too preoccupied to object to Metternich&#x27;s other ideas, like a final peace conference in Vienna. Metternich did not attend talks with the French at Châtillon, as he wanted to stay with Alexander. The talks stalled, and, after a brief advance, Coalition forces had to retreat after the Battle of Montmirail and Battle of Montereau. This relieved Metternich&#x27;s fears that an overconfident Alexander might act unilaterally.

Metternich continued negotiations with the French envoy Caulaincourt through early to mid March 1814, when victory at the Battle of Laon put the Coalition back on the offensive. By this time Metternich was tiring of trying to hold the Coalition together, and even the British-engineered Treaty of Chaumont did not help. In the absence of the Prussians and Russians the Coalition agreed to the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty. Francis rejected a final plea from Napoleon that he would abdicate in favour of his son with Marie Louise as regent, and Paris fell on 30 March. Military manoeuvres had forced Metternich westward to Dijon on 24 March and now, after a deliberate delay, he left for the French capital on 7 April. On 10 April he found a city at peace and, much to his annoyance, largely in the control of Tsar Alexander. The Austrians disliked the terms of the Treaty of Fontainebleau that Russia had imposed on Napoleon in their absence, but Metternich was reluctant to oppose them and on 11 April signed the treaty. Thereafter he focused on safeguarding Austrian interests in the forthcoming peace; asserting Austria&#x27;s influence in Germany over that of Prussia; and undoing Russian ascendancy. For these reasons he ensured that the Italian provinces of Lombardy and Venetia, lost to French client states in 1805, were duly re-annexed as the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia.

On the division of formerly French-occupied Poland and Germany, Metternich was more confined by the interests of the Allies. After two failed proposals, advanced by the Prussians, the issue was postponed until after a peace treaty had been signed. Elsewhere, Metternich, like many of his counterparts, was anxious to provide the renewed French monarchy with the resources to maintain control. The generous Treaty of Paris was signed on 30 May. Now free, Metternich accompanied Tsar Alexander to England; Wilhelmine, who had followed Metternich to Paris, also made the crossing. A triumphant Metternich filled his four weeks with revelry, re-establishing his reputation and that of Austria; he was also awarded an honorary law degree from the University of Oxford. By contrast and to Metternich&#x27;s pleasure, Alexander was ill-mannered and often insulting. Despite the opportunities, little diplomacy took place; instead, all that was firmly agreed was that proper discussions would take place at Vienna, with a date tentatively set for 15 August. When the Tsar tried to postpone it to October Metternich agreed but effected conditions that prevented Alexander from exercising any advantage due to his de facto control of Poland. Metternich was eventually reunited with his family in Austria in the middle of July 1814, having stopped for a week in France to soothe fears surrounding Napoleon&#x27;s wife Marie Louise, now the Duchess of Parma. His return to Vienna was celebrated by an occasional cantata that included the line &quot;History holds thee up to posterity as a model among great men&quot;.

===Congress of Vienna===


In the autumn of 1814, the heads of the five reigning dynasties and representatives from 216 noble families began gathering in Vienna. Before ministers from the &quot;Big Four&quot; (the Coalition allies of Britain, Austria, Prussia and Russia) arrived, Metternich stayed quietly in Baden bei Wien, two hours to the south. When he heard they had reached Vienna he journeyed to meet them and encouraged them to go with him back to Baden. They declined, and four meetings were held in the city itself. In these, the representatives agreed on how the Congress would operate and, to Metternich&#x27;s delight, named his own aide Friedrich von Gentz secretary to the negotiations of the &quot;Big Six&quot; (the Big Four plus France and Spain). When Talleyrand and Spanish representative Don Pedro Labrador learned of these decisions, they were incensed that agreements were negotiated by the Big Four only. Sweden and Portugal were similarly angered by their exclusion from all but the full Congress, especially since Metternich was determined to give the latter grouping as little power as possible. As a result, the Big Six became the Preliminary Committee of the Eight, whose first decision was that the congress itself be postponed to 1 November. In fact, it would soon be postponed again, with only a minor commission beginning work in November. In the meantime, Metternich organised a controversially vast array of entertainments for the delegates including himself.

Leaving Castlereagh to negotiate on Tsar Alexander&#x27;s behalf, Metternich briefly turned his attention to quelling anti-Habsburg feeling in Italy. Around the same time, he learnt that the Duchess of Sagan was courting the Tsar. Disappointed, and exhausted by social rounds, Metternich let his guard drop, angering Tsar Alexander during negotiations over Poland (then ruled by Napoleon as the Grand Duchy of Warsaw) by implying Austria could match Russia militarily. Despite the blunder, Francis refused to dismiss his foreign minister, and political crisis rocked Vienna throughout November, culminating in a declaration by Tsar Alexander that Russia would not compromise in its claim on Poland as a satellite kingdom. The Coalition rejected this utterly, and the agreement seemed further off than ever. During the stand-off, it seems that Alexander even went as far as to challenge Metternich to a duel. However, Tsar Alexander soon did a rapid &quot;volte face&quot; and agreed to the division of Poland. He also softened in regard to the Germanic Kingdom of Saxony, and for the first time allowed Talleyrand to participate in all Big Four (now Big Five) discussions.

With the new consensus, the major issues concerning Poland and Germany were settled in the second week of February 1815. Austria gained land in the partition of Poland and prevented the Prussian annexation of Saxony, but was forced to accept Russian dominance in Poland and increasing Prussian influence in Germany. Metternich now focused on getting the various German states to cede historic rights to a new Federal Diet that could stand up to Prussia. He also assisted the Swiss Committee and worked on a myriad of smaller issues, like navigation rights on the Rhine. The beginning of Lent on 8 February brought him more time to devote to these congressional issues as well as private discussions about southern Italy, where Joachim Murat was said to be raising a Neapolitan army. On 7 March Metternich was awakened with the news that Napoleon had escaped from his island prison of Elba and within an hour had met with both the Tsar and the King of Prussia. Metternich wanted no rash change of course, and at first, there was little impact on the Congress. Finally, on 13 March the Big Five declared Napoleon an outlaw and the Allies began preparations for renewed fighting. On 25 March they signed a treaty committing each to send 150,000 men with little sign of their prior divisive stances. After the military commanders left, the Vienna Congress settled down to serious work, fixing the boundaries of an independent Netherlands, formalising proposals for a loose confederation of Swiss cantons, and ratifying earlier agreements over Poland. By late April only two major issues remained, the organisation of a new German federation and the problem of Italy.

The latter soon began to come to a head. Austria had solidified its control over Lombardy-Venetia and extended its protection to provinces nominally under the control of Francis&#x27; daughter Marie Louise. On 18 April Metternich announced that Austria was formally at war with Murat&#x27;s Naples. Austria won the Battle of Tolentino on 3 May and captured Naples less than three weeks later. Metternich then was able to delay a decision on the future of the country until after Vienna. Discussions about Germany would drag on until early June when a joint Austrian-Prussian proposition was ratified. It left most constitutional issues to the new diet; its president would be Emperor Francis himself. Despite criticism from within Austria, Metternich was pleased with the outcome and the degree of control it granted Habsburgs, and, through them, himself. Certainly, Metternich was able to use the diet to his own ends on numerous occasions. The arrangement was similarly popular with most German representatives. A summation treaty was signed on 19 June (the Russians signed a week later), bringing the Vienna Congress officially to an end. Metternich himself had left on 13 June for the front line, prepared for a lengthy war against Napoleon. Napoleon, however, was defeated decisively at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June.

===Paris and Italy===
From 1815 onward, statesmen in Europe focused on averting the threat of social revolution because Napoleon had been defeated. Metternich published reform proposals. He envisaged the preservation of the existing social hierarchy and to this end the continuous authority of legitimate sovereigns as well as the rule of law. Metternich rose to become the foremost conservative statesman in Europe, his scrutiny lasted until 1848. The Habsburg rulers of the Austrian Empire bet that the idea of nationality would avert the doom.

Metternich was back with coalition allies in Paris, once more discussing peace terms. After 133 days of negotiations, longer than the Hundred Days turmoil itself, the second Treaty of Paris was concluded on 20 November. Metternich was of the opinion, that France should not be dismembered. He was therefore happy with the result. France lost only a little land along its eastern borders, seven hundred million French francs, and the artworks it had plundered. It also accepted an army of occupation, numbering 150,000. In the meantime a separate treaty, proposed by Alexander and redrafted by Metternich, had been signed on 26 September. This created a new Holy Alliance centered on Russia, Prussia and Austria; it was a document Metternich neither pushed for nor wanted, given its vaguely liberal sentiments

Representatives from most of the European states eventually signed, with the exception of the Papal States (the Pope), the United Kingdom, and the Ottoman Empire. Shortly afterwards, a separate treaty reaffirmed the Quadruple Alliance and established through its sixth article the Congress System of regular diplomatic meetings. With Europe at peace, the Austrian flag now flew over 50 percent more land than when Metternich had become Foreign Minister.

Metternich now returned to the question of Italy, making his first visit to the country in early December 1815. After visiting Venice, his family joined him in Milan on 18 December. For once it was Metternich playing the liberal, vainly urging Francis to give the region some autonomy. Metternich spent four months in Italy, endlessly busy and suffering chronic inflammation of the eyelids. He tried to control Austrian foreign policy from Milan and when there was a serious disagreement between the Empire and the Kingdom of Bavaria, was heavily criticised for his absence. His enemies could not capitalise on this, however. Stadion was occupied by his work as finance minister and the Empress Maria Ludovika of Austria-Este, a fierce critic of Metternich&#x27;s policies, died in April.

The uncharacteristic gap between the views of Metternich and his emperor was eased only by the active compromise of proposals. Metternich returned to Vienna on 28 May 1816 after almost a year&#x27;s absence. Professionally, the rest of 1816 passed quietly for the tired Minister, who was concerned with fiscal policy and monitoring the spread of liberalism in Germany and nationalism in Italy. Personally, he was shaken in November by the death of Julie Zichy-Festetics. Two years later he wrote that his &quot;life ended there,&quot; and his old frivolity took some time to return. The only consolation was July&#x27;s news that Metternich was to receive new estates along the Rhine at Johannisberg, only from his birthplace at Koblenz.

In June 1817 Metternich was required to escort the emperor&#x27;s newlywed daughter Maria Leopoldina to a ship at Livorno. There was delay upon their arrival, and Metternich spent the time travelling around Italy again. He visited Venice, Padua, Ferrara, Pisa, Florence and Lucca. Though alarmed by developments he noted that many of Francis&#x27; concessions were still not in practice. But Metternich was optimistic and made another plea for decentralisation on 29 August. After this failed, Metternich decided to broaden his efforts into general administrative reform to avoid the appearance of favouring the Italians over the rest of the Empire. While working on this, he returned to Vienna on 12 September 1817 to be immediately caught up in the organisation of his daughter Maria&#x27;s marriage to Count Joseph Esterházy just three days later. It proved too much, and Metternich was taken ill. After a delay for recovery, Metternich condensed his proposals for Italy into three documents he submitted to Francis, all dated 27 October 1817. The administration would remain undemocratic, but there would be a new Ministry of Justice and four new chancellors. Each with local remits, including one for &quot;Italy&quot;. Importantly, the divisions would be regional, not national. In the end, Francis accepted the revised proposals, albeit with several alterations and restrictions.

===Aachen, Teplice, Karlsbad, Troppau, and Laibach===
Metternich&#x27;s primary focus remained on preserving unity among the Great Powers of Europe and hence his own power as mediator. He was also concerned by liberal-minded Ioannis Kapodistrias&#x27; increasing influence over Tsar Alexander and the continual threat of Russia annexing large areas of the declining Ottoman Empire (the so-called &quot;Eastern Question&quot;). As he had earlier envisaged, by April 1818 Britain had drawn up, and Metternich pushed through, proposals to have a Congress at Aachen, then a Prussian frontier town, six months later. Meanwhile, Metternich was advised to go to the spa town of Karlsbad to treat the rheumatic tension in his back. It was a pleasant month-long trip, although it was there he received news of the death of his father at the age of 72.

He visited the family estate at Königswart and then Frankfurt in late August to encourage the member states of the German Confederation to agree on procedural issues. Metternich could also now visit Koblenz for the first time in 25 years and his new estate at Johannisberg. Travelling with Emperor Francis, he was warmly greeted by the Catholic towns along the Rhine as he progressed towards Aachen. He had arranged in advance for newspapers to cover the first peacetime congress of its kind. As discussions began, Metternich pushed for the withdrawal of allied troops from France and means for preserving the unity of the European powers. The former was agreed almost immediately, but the latter agreement extended only to maintaining the Quadruple Alliance. Metternich rejected the Tsar&#x27;s idealistic plans for (among other things) a single European army. His own recommendations to the Prussians for greater controls on freedom of speech was equally hard for other powers such as Britain to support openly.

Metternich travelled with Dorothea Lieven to Brussels soon after the congress broke up, and although he could not stay more than a few days, the pair exchanged letters for the next eight years. He arrived in Vienna on 11 December 1818 and was finally able to spend considerable time with his children. He entertained the Tsar during the Christmas season and spent twelve weeks monitoring Italy and Germany before setting off with the Emperor on the third trip to Italy. The trip was cut short by the assassination of the conservative German dramatist August von Kotzebue. After a short delay, Metternich decided that if the German governments would not act against this perceived problem, Austria would have to compel them. He called an informal conference in Karlsbad and sounded out Prussian support beforehand by meeting with Frederick William III of Prussia in Teplice in July. Metternich carried the day, using a recent attempt on the life of the Chief Minister of Nassau, Carl Ibell to win agreement for the conservative program now known as the Convention of Teplitz. The Karlsbad conference opened on 6 August and ran for the rest of the month. Metternich overcame any opposition to his proposed &quot;group of anti-revolutionary measures, correct and preemptory&quot;, although they were condemned by outsiders. Despite censure Metternich was very pleased with the result, known as the Carlsbad Decrees.

At the conference in Vienna later in the year, Metternich found himself constrained by the Kings of Württemberg and Bavaria to abandon his plans to reform the German Confederation. He now regretted having so quickly forced through its original constitution five years before. Nevertheless, he held ground on other issues and the Conference&#x27;s Final Act was highly reactionary, much as Metternich had envisaged it. He remained in Vienna until the close in May 1820, finding the whole affair a bore. On 6 May he heard of the death of his daughter Princess Klementine von Metternich from tuberculosis. Journeying on to Prague, he heard that his eldest daughter Maria had also contracted the disease. He was at her bedside in Baden bei Wien when she died on 20 July. This prompted Eleonore and the remaining children to leave for the cleaner air of France.

The rest of 1820 was filled with liberal revolts to which Metternich was expected to respond. Ultimately, the Austrian Foreign Minister was torn between following through on his conservative pledge (a policy favoured by the Russians) and keeping out of a country in which Austria had no interest (favoured by the British). He chose &quot;sympathetic inactivity&quot; on Spain but, much to his dismay and surprise, Guglielmo Pepe led a revolt in Naples in early July and forced King Ferdinand I to accept a new constitution. Metternich reluctantly agreed to attend the Russian-initiated Congress of Troppau in October to discuss these events. He need not have worried: the Tsar gave way and accepted a compromise proposal of moderate interventionism laid down in the Troppau Protocol. Still worried by Kapodistrias&#x27; influence over the Tsar, he laid down his conservative principles in a long memorandum, including an attack on the free press and the initiative of the middle classes.

The Congress disbanded in the third week of December, and the next step would be a congress at Laibach to discuss intervention with Ferdinand. Metternich found himself able to dominate Laibach more than any other congress, overseeing Ferdinand&#x27;s rejection of the liberal constitution he had agreed to only months before. Austrian armies left for Naples in February and entered the city in March. The Congress was adjourned but, forewarned or by luck, Metternich kept representatives of the powers close at hand until the revolt was put down. As a result, when similar revolts broke out in Piedmont in the middle of March, Metternich had the Tsar at hand, who agreed to send 90,000 men to the frontier in a show of solidarity. Concerns grew in Vienna that Metternich&#x27;s policy was too expensive. He responded that Naples and Piedmont would pay for stability; nonetheless, he, too, was clearly worried for the future of Italy. He was relieved when able to create a Court Chancellor and Chancellor of State on 25 May, a post left vacant since the death of Kaunitz in 1794. He was also pleased at the renewed (if fragile) closeness between Austria, Prussia and Russia; however, it had come at the expense of the Anglo-Austrian entente.

===Hanover, Verona, and Czernowitz===
In 1821, while Metternich was still at Laibach with Tsar Alexander, the revolt of Prince Alexander Ypsilantis threatened to bring the Ottoman Empire to the brink of collapse. Wanting a strong Ottoman Empire to counterbalance Russia, Metternich opposed all forms of Greek nationalism. Before Alexander returned to Russia, Metternich secured his agreement not to act unilaterally and would write to the Tsar, again and again, asking him not to intervene. For extra support he met with Viscount Castlereagh (now also Marquess of Londonderry) and King George IV of the United Kingdom in Hanover in October. The warmness of Metternich&#x27;s welcome was sweetened by his promise to settle in part Austria&#x27;s financial debts to Britain. The earlier Anglo-Austrian entente was thus restored, and the pair agreed that they would support the Austrian position concerning the Balkans. Metternich went away happy, not least because he had met Dorothea Lieven once more.

Over Christmas, the Tsar wavered more than Metternich had expected and sent Dmitry Tatishchev to Vienna in February 1822 for talks with Metternich. Metternich soon convinced the &quot;conceited and ambitious&quot; Russian to let him dictate events. In return Austria promised to support Russia in enforcing its treaties with the Ottomans if the other alliance members would do likewise; Metternich was aware this was politically impossible for the British. Metternich&#x27;s adversary at the Russian court, Kapodistrias, retired from service there; however, by the end of April there was a new threat: Russia now determined to intervene in Spain, action Metternich described as &quot;utter nonsense&quot;. He played for time, convincing his ally Castlereagh to come to Vienna for talks before a scheduled congress in Verona, although Castlereagh died by suicide on 12 August. With Castlereagh dead and relations with the British weakening, Metternich had lost a useful ally. The Congress of Verona was a fine social event but diplomatically less successful. Supposedly concerned with Italy, the Congress had to focus on Spain instead. Austria urged non-intervention, but it was the French that carried the day with their proposal for a joint invasion force. Prussia committed men, and the Tsar pledged 150,000. Metternich worried about the difficulties of transporting such numbers to Spain and about French ambitions, but still pledged (if only moral) support for the joint force.

He lingered in Verona until 18 December, then spending some days in Venice with the Tsar and then by himself in Munich. He returned to Vienna in early January 1823 and remained until September; after Verona, he travelled much less than before, partly because of his new post as Chancellor and partly because of his declining health. He was buoyed by the arrival of his family from Paris in May. He shone once more in Viennese society. Politically, the year was one of disappointments. In March the French crossed the Pyrenees unilaterally, undoing the &quot;moral solidarity&quot; established at Verona. Likewise, Metternich thought the new Pope Leo XII too pro-French, and there was trouble between Austria and several German states over why they had not been included at Verona. Furthermore, Metternich, in discrediting the Russian diplomat Pozzo di Borgo, instead renewed the Tsar&#x27;s former suspicion of him. Worse came in late September: while accompanying the Emperor to a meeting with Alexander at Czernowitz, Metternich fell ill with a fever. He could not continue and had to make do with brief talks with the Russian Foreign Minister, Karl Nesselrode. At the Czernowitz talks, in Metternich&#x27;s absence, an impatient Tsar asked for a congress in the then Russian capital Saint Petersburg to discuss the Eastern Question. Metternich, wary of letting the Russians dominate affairs, could only play for time.

The Tsar&#x27;s dual proposal for the St Petersburg meetings, a settlement of the Eastern Question favourable to Russia and limited autonomy for three Greek principalities, was a pairing unpalatable to the other European powers, and potential attendees like British Foreign Secretary George Canning slowly turned away, much to the annoyance of Alexander. Metternich believed for several months afterward that he had gained a unique level of influence over the Tsar. Meanwhile, he renewed the conservative program he had outlined at Karlsbad five years before and sought to further increase Austrian influence over the German Federal Diet. He also informed the press they could no longer publicise the minutes of Diet meetings, only its rulings. In January 1825 he began to worry about his wife Eleonore&#x27;s health and he reached her sickbed in Paris shortly before her death on 19 March. Mourning sincerely for her, he also took the opportunity to dine with the Paris elite. An aside he made about the Tsar there was reported back and did not enhance his reputation. He left Paris for the last time on 21 April and was joined by the Emperor in Milan after arriving on 7 May. He declined the Pope&#x27;s invitation to become a cardinal of the church. There was also a short trip to Genoa. Early in July the court dispersed and Metternich visited his daughters Leontine (fourteen) and Hermine (nine) in the quiet town of Bad Ischl. Despite the seclusion, he received constant reports, including those of ominous developments in the Ottoman Empire, where the Greek revolt was rapidly being crushed by Ibrahim Ali of Egypt. He also had to deal with the fallout from St. Petersburg where the Tsar, although unable to convene a full congress, had talked with all the major ambassadors. By mid-May it was clear the allies could not decide on a course of action and, as such, the Holy Alliance was no longer a viable political entity.

===Hungarian Diets, Alexander I&#x27;s death, and problems in Italy===
In the early 1820s, Metternich had advised Francis that convening the Hungarian Diet would help get approval for financial reform. In fact, the Diet of 1825 to 1827 saw 300 sessions filled with criticism of how the Empire had eroded the historic rights of the Kingdom of Hungary&#x27;s nobility. Metternich complained that it &quot;interfered with [his] time, [his] customs and [his] daily life&quot;, as he was forced to travel to Bratislava to perform ceremonial duties and to observe. He was alarmed by the growth of Hungarian national sentiment and wary of the growing influence of nationalist István Széchenyi, whom he had met twice in 1825. Back in Vienna, in mid-December, he heard of the death of Tsar Alexander with mixed feelings. He had known the Tsar well and was reminded of his own frailty, although the death potentially wiped the soured diplomatic slate clean. Moreover, he could claim credit for foreseeing the liberal Decembrist revolt the new Tsar Nicholas I had to crush. Now 53, Metternich chose to send Archduke Ferdinand to establish the first contact with Nicholas. Metternich was also friendly with the British envoy (the Duke of Wellington) and enlisted his help to charm Nicholas. Despite this, the first 18 months of Nicholas&#x27; reign did not go well for Metternich: firstly, the British were chosen over the Austrians to oversee Russian-Ottoman talks; and, as a result, Metternich could exercise no influence over the resulting Akkerman Convention. France too began to drift away from Metternich&#x27;s non-interventionist position. In August 1826 Russian Foreign Minister Nesselrode rejected a proposal by Metternich to convene a congress to discuss the events that eventually led to the outbreak of civil war in Portugal. The Austrian Foreign Minister accepted this with &quot;surprising resilience&quot;. On 29 March 1827 Metternich spoke and attended the funeral of Beethoven whom he may have met during the Congress of Vienna.

On 5 November 1827 Baroness Antoinette von Leykam, daughter of diplomat Christoph Ambros Freiherr von Leykam (1777–1830) and his wife, Donna Lucia Antonia Caputo dei Marchesi della Petrella (b.1783), became Metternich&#x27;s second wife. She was only twenty, and their marriage, a small affair at Hetzendorf (a village just outside Vienna), drew considerable criticism considering their difference in status. She belonged to the lower nobility, but Antoinette&#x27;s grace and charm soon won over Viennese society. The same day British, Russian and French forces destroyed the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Navarino. Metternich worried that further intervention would topple the Ottoman Empire, upsetting the balance so carefully created in 1815. To his relief, the new British Prime Minister Wellington and his cabinet were equally fearful of giving Russia the upper hand in the Balkans. After another round of his proposals for congresses was rejected, Metternich stood back from the Eastern Question, watching as the Treaty of Adrianople was signed in September 1829. Though he publicly criticised it for being too harsh on Turkey, privately he was satisfied with its leniency and promise of Greek autonomy, making it a buffer against Russian expansion rather than a Russian satellite state. Metternich&#x27;s private life was filled with grief. In November 1828 his mother died, and in January 1829 Antoinette died, five days after giving birth to their son, Richard von Metternich. After fighting tuberculosis for many months, Metternich&#x27;s son Viktor, then a junior diplomat, died on 30 November 1829. Consequently, he spent Christmas alone and depressed, worried by the draconian methods of some of his fellow conservatives and by the renewed march of liberalism.

In May Metternich took a much-needed holiday on his estate at Johannisberg. He returned to Vienna a month later, still worried by the &quot;chaos in London and Paris&quot; and his declining ability to prevent it. Hearing Nesselrode was due to take the waters at Karlsbad, he met him there in late July. He berated the quiet Nesselrode, but no offence was taken. The two arranged a second meeting in August. In the interim Metternich heard of France&#x27;s July Revolution, which deeply shocked him and theoretically posed the need for a congress of the Quadruple Alliance. Instead, Metternich met with Nesselrode as planned and, while the Russian rejected his plan to restore the old Alliance, the pair agreed on the Chiffon de Karlsbad: that panic was needless unless the new government showed territorial ambitions in Europe. Although pleased by this, Metternich&#x27;s mood was soured by news of unrest in Brussels (then part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands), the resignation of Wellington in London, and calls for constitutionality in Germany. He wrote with sombre and &quot;almost morbid relish&quot; that it was the &quot;beginning of the end&quot; of Old Europe. Nonetheless, he was heartened by the fact that the July Revolution had made a Franco-Russian alliance impossible and that the Netherlands had called an old-style congress of the sort he enjoyed so much. The 1830 convocation of the Hungarian Diet was also more successful than past ones, crowning Archduke Ferdinand as King of Hungary with little dissent. Moreover, by November his betrothal to 25-year-old Countess Melanie Zichy-Ferraris, who came from a Magyar family the Metternichs had long known, was agreed upon. The announcement caused far less consternation in Vienna than Metternich&#x27;s previous bride, and they were married on 30 January 1831.

In February 1831 rebels took the cities of Parma, Modena and Bologna and appealed to France for help. Their former rulers appealed for help from Austria, but Metternich was anxious not to march Austrian troops into the Papal States without authorisation from the new Pope Gregory XVI. He occupied Parma and Modena, however (both ruled by Habsburgs), and eventually did cross into Papal territory. As a result, Italy was pacified by the end of March. He authorised troop withdrawal from the Papal States in July, but by January 1832 they were back to put down a second rebellion. By now Metternich was ageing noticeably: his hair was grey and his face drawn and sunken, although his wife still enjoyed his company. In February 1832 a daughter, also Melanie, was born; in 1833 a son, Klemens, though he died aged two months; in October 1834 a second son, Paul; and in 1837 his third with Melanie, Lothar. Politically, Metternich had a new adversary, Lord Palmerston, who had taken over at the British Foreign Office in 1830. By the end of 1832, they had clashed on virtually every issue. &quot;In short,&quot; Metternich wrote, &quot;Palmerston is wrong about everything&quot;. Mostly, Metternich was annoyed by his insistence that under the 1815 agreements Britain had the right to oppose Austria&#x27;s tightening of university controls in Germany, as Metternich had done again in 1832. Metternich also worried that if future congresses were held in Britain, as Palmerston wanted, his own influence would be significantly reduced.

===Eastern Question revisited and peace in Europe===
In 1831 Egypt invaded the Ottoman Empire. There were fears of the Empire&#x27;s total collapse, by which Austria stood to gain little. Metternich therefore proposed multilateral support for the Ottomans and a Viennese Congress to sort out details, but the French were evasive and the British refused to support any congress held in Vienna. By the summer of 1833 Anglo-Austrian relations had hit a new low. With Russia Metternich was more confident of exerting influence. He was mistaken, however, and left to observe from afar Russian intervention in the region culminating in the Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi. He still arranged to meet with King Frederick William III of Prussia at Teplitz and accompany Francis to meet Tsar Nicholas at Münchengrätz in September 1833. The former meeting went well: Metternich still felt able to dominate the Prussians, despite their rising economic prominence in Europe through the Zollverein. The latter was more strained but, as Nicholas warmed, three Münchengrätz Agreements were reached that shaped a new conservative league to uphold the existing order in Turkey, Poland, and elsewhere. Metternich left happy; his sole disappointment was having to commit to being tougher on Polish nationalists. Almost immediately, he heard of the creation of the Quadruple Alliance of 1834 between Britain, France, Spain and Portugal. This alliance of liberals was such an affront to Austrian values that Palmerston wrote he &quot;should like to see Metternich&#x27;s face when he reads our treaty&quot;. It did indeed draw bitter condemnation, mostly because it provided the occasion for an outbreak of war. Metternich tried two tacks: to intrigue for the removal of the British Foreign Secretary and to attempt (vainly) to build up cross-power bloc agreements. Palmerston did indeed leave office in November, but only temporarily and not by any of Metternich&#x27;s attempts. Large-scale war, however, had been avoided and the Quadruple Alliance was beginning to disintegrate.

On 2 March 1835, Emperor Francis died, succeeded by his epileptic son Ferdinand I. Despite the widespread opinion that Ferdinand was a &quot;ghost of a monarch&quot;, Metternich valued legitimacy highly and worked to keep the government running. He soon accompanied Ferdinand on his first meeting with Tsar Nicholas and the King of Prussia, again at Teplitz. Ferdinand was overwhelmed, especially as the delegations paraded into Prague. Overall, however, it was an untroubled meeting. The next few years passed relatively peacefully for Metternich: diplomatic incident was limited to the occasional angry exchange with Palmerston and Metternich&#x27;s failure to be a mediator between the British and Russians over their Black Sea dispute. He also put effort into bringing new technology like the railways into Austria. The most pressing issue was Hungary, where Metternich remained reluctant to support the centrist (but still nationalist) Széchenyi. His hesitancy is &quot;a sad commentary on his declining powers of political presence&quot;. At court Metternich increasingly lost power to the rising star Franz Anton von Kolowrat-Liebsteinsky, particularly in his proposals to increase military budgets. After his failed attempt in 1836 to force constitutional reform (which would have afforded him greater influence)—largely thwarted by the more liberally minded Archduke John—Metternich was forced to share more power with Kolowrat and Archduke Ludwig as part of Austria&#x27;s Secret State Conference. Decision making ground to a halt. Entertaining and maintaining his estates at Johannisberg, Königswart and Plasy (together with Mariánská Týnice) were consuming much of his resources at a time when he had four young children to support, causing him more stress.

Metternich had long predicted a new crisis in the East, and when the Egyptian-Ottoman War broke out in 1839 he was anxious to re-establish Austria&#x27;s diplomatic credentials. He quickly gathered representatives in Vienna, whence on 27 July they issued a communiqué to Istanbul pledging support. However, Tsar Nicholas sent Metternich a message from St Petersburg challenging Vienna&#x27;s claim to diplomatic centrality. Metternich worked so furiously that he fell ill, spending the next five weeks resting at Johannisberg. The Austrians lost the initiative, and Metternich had to accept that London would be the new centre of negotiations over the Eastern Question. Just three weeks after its creation, Metternich&#x27;s European League of Great Powers (his diplomatic response to aggressive moves by French Prime Minister Adolphe Thiers) had become a mere curiosity. Little, too, was heard of his proposals to hold a congress in Germany. A separate attempt to strengthen the influence of ambassadors stationed in Vienna was also rejected. This set the tone for the rest of Metternich&#x27;s chancellorship. His illness had, it seemed to others, broken his love of being in office. Over the next decade, his wife prepared quietly for his retirement or death in office. Metternich&#x27;s work during the early 1840s was dominated again by Hungary and, more generally, questions of national identity within the diverse Austrian Empire. Here, Metternich &quot;showed [moments of] acute perception&quot;. His Hungarian proposals came far too late, however, as Lajos Kossuth had already led the rise of strong Hungarian nationalism. Metternich&#x27;s support for other nationalities was patchy since he only opposed those that threatened the unity of the Empire.

At the Conference of State Metternich lost his principal ally Count Karl von Clam-Martinic in 1840, which furthered the growing paralysis at the heart of Austrian government. Metternich now struggled to enforce even the level of censorship he desired. There were no major challenges to the regime from outside. Italy was quiet, and neither Metternich&#x27;s attempt to lecture the new Prussian king Frederick William IV nor the boredom of the new British Queen Victoria at their first meeting posed immediate problems. Far more worrying was Tsar Nicholas, whose estimation of the Habsburg dynasty and Austria was low. After an impromptu tour of Italy in 1845, the Tsar unexpectedly stopped in Vienna. Already in a bad mood, he was an awkward guest, though in between criticisms of Austria he reassured Metternich that Russia was not about to invade the Ottoman Empire again. Two months later their countries were required to work together over the Galician slaughter and a declaration of independence by the Free City of Cracow. Metternich authorised the occupation of the city and the use of troops to restore order in surrounding areas, intent on undoing the pseudo-independence that had been granted Kraków in 1815. After months of negotiations with Prussia and Russia, Austria annexed the city in November 1846. Metternich regarded it as a personal victory, but it was an act of dubious utility: not only were Polish dissidents now officially part of Austria, the Europe-wide Polish dissident movement was now worked actively against the &quot;Metternich system&quot; that had overridden the rights enshrined in 1815. Britain and France appeared similarly outraged, although calls for Metternich&#x27;s resignation were ignored. For the next two years, Ferdinand could not abdicate in favour of his nephew without a regency; Metternich believed Austria would need him in the interim to hold the government together.

==Revolution==


Though Metternich was tiring, memoranda kept pouring forth from his chancellery. Despite this, he did not foresee the building crisis. The new Pope Pius IX was gaining a reputation as a liberal nationalist, counterbalancing Metternich and Austria; at the same time, the Empire experienced unemployment and rising prices as a result of poor harvests. Metternich was bemused at the outcry from Italians, the Pope, and Palmerston when he ordered the occupation of Papal-controlled Ferrara in the summer of 1847. Despite securing French agreement for the first time in years from François Guizot over the Swiss Civil War, France and Austria were forced into backing breakaway cantons. The pair proposed a conference, but the government crushed the revolt. It was a major blow to Metternich&#x27;s prestige, and his opponents in Vienna called it evidence of his incompetence. In January 1848 Metternich predicted trouble in Italy during the year ahead. He acted on this by dispatching an envoy, Karl Ludwig von Ficquelmont to Italy; by resurrecting his 1817 plans for an Italian chancellery; and by arranging various contingency plans with the French. In late February Austrian field marshal Joseph Radetsky placed Austrian Italy (Lombardy-Venetia) under martial law as disturbances spread. Despite this and hearing of renewed revolution in France, Metternich was cautious, still thinking domestic revolution unlikely. He was described by a Saxon diplomat as, in the words of biographer Musulin, &quot;having shrunk to a shadow of his former self&quot;.

On 3 March Kossuth gave a fiery speech in the Hungarian Diet, calling for a constitution. It was not until 10 March that Metternich appeared concerned about events in Vienna, where there were now threats and counter-threats flying. Two petitions were organised, calling for greater freedom, transparency, and representation. Students were involved in several demonstrations, culminating on 13 March when they cheered the imperial family but voiced anger at Metternich. After a customary morning, Metternich was called to meet with Archduke Ludwig soon after midday. The Chancellor had troops sent into the streets while also announcing a prearranged and minimal concession. In the afternoon the crowd turned hostile, and a division of troops opened fire on it, killing five. The mob was now truly incited, as the liberals were joined by underprivileged Viennese set on wreaking havoc. The students offered to form a pro-government Academic Legion if their demands were met. Ludwig was eager to accept and told Metternich he must resign, to which he reluctantly agreed. After sleeping in the Chancellery he was advised to either take back his resignation or leave the city. After Ludwig sent him a message to the effect that the government could not guarantee his safety, Metternich left for the house of Count Taaffe and then, with aid from friends Charles von Hügel and Johann Rechberg, reached the family seat of Prince Liechtenstein forty miles away at Feldsberg. Metternich&#x27;s daughter Leontine joined them on 21 March and suggested England as a haven; agreeing, Metternich, Melanie and 19-year-old Richard set out, leaving the younger children with Leontine. Metternich&#x27;s resignation had been met with cheering in Vienna, and even the Viennese commoners welcomed the end of Metternich&#x27;s era of social conservatism.

==Exile, return, and death==

After an anxious journey of nine days during which they were honoured in some towns and refused entry to others, Metternich, his wife, and son Richard arrived in the Dutch city of Arnhem. They stayed until Metternich regained his strength, then reached Amsterdam and The Hague, where they waited to hear the results of a demonstration by English chartists, planned for 10 April. On 20 April they landed at Blackwall in London, where they stayed in the Brunswick Hotel in Hanover Square for a fortnight until they found a permanent residence. Metternich largely enjoyed his time in London: the Duke of Wellington, now nearly eighty, tried to keep him entertained, and there were also visits from Palmerston, Guizot (now also in exile) and Benjamin Disraeli, who enjoyed his political conversation. The sole disappointment was that Victoria herself did not acknowledge his presence in the capital. The trio leased a house, 44 Eaton Square, for four months. The younger children joined them in the summer. He followed events in Austria from afar, famously denying ever having erred; in fact, he declared the turmoil in Europe to be a vindication of his policies. In Vienna, a hostile post-censorship press continued to attack him; in particular, they accused him of embezzlement and accepting bribes, prompting an investigation. Metternich was eventually cleared of the more extreme charges, and searches for evidence of the lesser ones came up empty-handed. (In all likelihood Metternich&#x27;s large expense claims were merely a product of the necessities of early 19th-century diplomacy.) Meanwhile, as he was denied his pension, Metternich was ironically reliant on loans.

In mid-September, the family moved to 42 Brunswick Terrace, Brighton, on the south coast of England where the tranquillity of life contrasted greatly with revolutionary Europe left behind. Parliamentary figures, particularly Disraeli, travelled down to visit them, as did Metternich&#x27;s former friend Dorothea Lieven (Melanie led a reconciliation between the two). Expecting a visit from Metternich&#x27;s daughter Leontine and her own daughter Pauline, the family moved to a suite of rooms at Richmond Palace on 23 April 1849. Visitors included Wellington, who still watched out for Metternich; Johann Strauss, the composer; and Dorothea de Dino, sister of Metternich&#x27;s former lover Wilhemine of Sagan; and former lover Catherine Bagration. Metternich was showing his age, and his frequent fainting was cause for worry. The ex-Chancellor was also depressed by the lack of communication from the new Emperor Franz Joseph I and his government. Leontine wrote to Vienna trying to encourage this contact, and in August Metternich received a warm letter from Franz Joseph; sincere or not, it buoyed Metternich considerably. From mid-August Melanie began to push for a move to Brussels, a city cheaper to live in and closer to continental affairs. They arrived in October, staying overnight in the Hotel Bellevue. With revolution subsiding, Metternich was hopeful they would return to Vienna. Their stay in fact lasted over 18 months while Metternich waited for an opportunity to re-enter Austrian politics. It was a pleasant enough (and cheap) stay, first in the Boulevard de l&#x27;Observatoire and later in the Sablon area—filled with visits from politicians, writers, musicians and scientists. For Metternich, however, the tedium and homesickness only increased. In March 1851 Melanie induced him to write to the new political force in Vienna, Prince Schwarzenberg, to ask if he might return if he promised not to interfere in public affairs. In April he received an affirmative reply, authorised by Franz Joseph.

In May 1851 Metternich left for his Johannisberg estate, which he had last visited in 1845. That summer Metternich enjoyed the company of Prussian representative Otto von Bismarck. He also enjoyed a visit from Frederick William IV, though the King irritated Metternich by appearing to cultivate him as a tool against Schwarzenberg. In September Metternich returned to Vienna, entertained along the way by various German princes keen to entertain the focus of Prussian intrigue. Metternich was reinvigorated, dropped his nostalgia, and lived in the present for the first time in a decade. Franz Josef asked for his advice on numerous issues (though he was too headstrong to be much influenced by it), and both of the two emerging factions in Vienna courted Metternich; even Tsar Nicholas called on him during a state visit. Metternich was not keen on the new Foreign Minister, Karl Ferdinand von Buol, but thought him sufficiently incompetent that he would be impressionable. Metternich&#x27;s advice was of varying quality; nonetheless, some of it was usefully insightful, even in modern issues. Now deaf, Metternich wrote endlessly, particularly for an appreciative Franz Josef. He wanted Austrian neutrality in the Crimean War, though Buol did not. In the meantime Metternich&#x27;s health was slowly failing, and he was a more peripheral figure after the death of his wife Melanie in January 1854. In a brief resurgence of energy in early 1856, he busied himself in arrangements for a marriage between his son Richard and his granddaughter Pauline (Richard&#x27;s step-sister&#x27;s daughter) and undertook more travel. The King of the Belgians came to visit, as did Bismarck, and on 16 August 1857, he entertained the future Edward VII of the United Kingdom. Buol, however, was growing more resentful of Metternich&#x27;s advice, particularly about Italy. In April 1859 Franz Josef came to ask him about what should be done in Italy. According to Pauline, Metternich begged him not to send an ultimatum to Italy, and Franz Josef explained that such an ultimatum had already been sent.

In this way, much to Metternich&#x27;s disappointment and to Franz Josef&#x27;s embarrassment, Austria began the Second Italian War of Independence against the combined forces of Piedmont-Sardinia and its ally France. Though Metternich was able to secure the replacement of Buol with his friend Rechberg, who had helped him so much in 1848, involvement in the war itself was now beyond his capacity. Even a special task given to him by Franz Josef in June 1859—to draw up secret papers addressing the event of Franz Josef&#x27;s death—was now too taxing. Shortly afterwards Metternich died in Vienna on 11 June 1859, aged 86, and the last great figure of his generation. Almost everyone of note in Vienna came to pay tribute; in the foreign press, his death went virtually unnoticed.

==Historians&#x27; assessment==


Historians agree on Metternich&#x27;s skill as a diplomat and his dedication to conservatism. According to Arthur May, he believed that:

the mass of Europeans yearned for security, quiet, and peace, and regarded liberal abstractions as repugnant or were utterly indifferent to them. The best of all patterns of government, he insisted, was autocratic absolutism, upheld by a loyal army, by a submissive, decently efficient bureaucracy and police machine, and by trustworthy churchmen.

Particularly during the remainder of the nineteenth century, Metternich was heavily criticised, decried as the man who prevented Austria and the rest of central Europe from &quot;developing along normal liberal and constitutional lines&quot;. Had Metternich not stood in the way of &quot;progress&quot;, Austria might have reformed, dealt better with its problems of nationality, and the First World War might never have happened. Instead, Metternich chose to fight an overwhelmingly fruitless war against the forces of liberalism and nationalism. Heavy censorship was just one of a range of repressive instruments of state available to him that also included a large spy network. Metternich opposed electoral reform, criticising Britain&#x27;s 1832 Reform Bill. In short, he locked himself into an embittered battle against &quot;the prevailing mood of his age&quot;.

On the other hand, Metternich&#x27;s diplomacy and statesmanship became the focus of praise in the twentieth century from more favourably inclined historians, particularly biographer Heinrich von Srbik. For example, particularly after WWII, historians were more likely to defend Metternich&#x27;s policies as reasonable attempts to achieve his goals, chiefly the balance of power in Europe. Sympathetic historians point out that Metternich correctly foresaw and worked to prevent Russian dominance in Europe, succeeding where his successors would fail 130 years later. As argued by Srbik, Metternich himself pursued legality, cooperation, and dialogue, and therefore helped ensure thirty years of peace, the &quot;Age of Metternich&quot;. Authors like Peter Viereck and Ernst B. Haas also give Metternich credit for his more liberal ideals, even if they weighed relatively little in his overall policies.

Critical views presuppose Metternich had the ability to shape Europe favorably but chose not to. More modern critiques like that of A. J. P. Taylor have questioned how much influence Metternich actually wielded. Robin Okey, a critic of Metternich, noted that even in the realm of foreign affairs Metternich &quot;had only his own persuasiveness to rely on&quot;, and this degraded over time. By this interpretation, his task was to create a &quot;smokescreen&quot; that hid Austria&#x27;s true weakness. When it came to choosing a set of sound principles, wrote Taylor, &quot;most men could do better while shaving.&quot; The result was that Metternich was no captivating diplomat: Taylor described him as &quot;the most boring man in European history&quot;. Not only were his failures limited to foreign affairs, critics argue: at home he was equally powerless, failing to effect even his own proposals for administrative reform. In contrast, those who have attempted to rehabilitate Metternich describe him as &quot;unquestionably [a] master of diplomacy&quot;, someone who perfected and indeed shaped the nature of diplomacy in his era. In a similar vein, Alan Sked argues that Metternich&#x27;s &quot;smokescreen&quot; may well have served a purpose in furthering a relatively coherent set of principles.

<text>S Club, formerly known as S Club 7, are a British pop group formed in 1998 by Simon Fuller after he was fired as manager of the Spice Girls. Original members were Tina Barrett, Paul Cattermole, Jon Lee, Bradley McIntosh, Jo O&#x27;Meara, Hannah Spearritt and Rachel Stevens. Cattermole left the group in 2002; it disbanded in 2003. After the members performed solo and in smaller groups, the group reunited temporarily for a short tour in 2015. In 2023, the group reunited and announced a tour; however, Cattermole died of heart failure and Spearritt withdrew from the group before the tour.

The band has sold more than 10 million albums worldwide. They won Brit Awards in 2000 for British breakthrough act and in 2002 for best British single. In 2001, they earned the Record of the Year award.

The group has released four studio albums: &quot;S Club&quot; (1999), which reached number one in the UK, &quot;7&quot; (2000), &quot;Sunshine&quot; (2001), and &quot;Seeing Double&quot; (2002). They had commercial success with songs including &quot;Bring It All Back&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re My Number One&quot;, &quot;Two in a Million&quot;, &quot;S Club Party&quot;, &quot;Reach&quot;, &quot;Natural&quot;, &quot;Never Had a Dream Come True&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Movin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;You&quot;, &quot;Have You Ever&quot;, &quot;Alive&quot;, and &quot;Love Ain&#x27;t Gonna Wait for You&quot;. In July 2023, S Club released their first new single in more than 20 years, &quot;These Are the Days&quot;, in memory of Cattermole.

According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), the group has been certified for sales of 2.8 million albums and 4.6 million singles in the UK.

==History==

===1997–1998: Formation===
S Club 7 were formed by Simon Fuller, after he was fired as manager of the Spice Girls in November 1997. He described S Club 7 as a continuation of ideas he had had for the Spice Girls, but with a softer, more uplifting image and the same songwriting team was used for both acts.

Fuller placed an advert in &quot;The Stage&quot; and held auditions with more than 10,000 applicants. Both Jo O&#x27;Meara and Paul Cattermole were spotted by producers from Fuller&#x27;s company, 19 Management, and asked to audition. Rachel Stevens was the only member who did not audition; instead, two producers approached her and asked her to record a demo tape. According to journalist Steven Poole, after Fuller&#x27;s disagreements with the Spice Girls, he picked &quot;the blandest, most malleable characters ... nice kids who wouldn&#x27;t answer back&quot;. 

Once the lineup was decided, the members flew to Italy to become acquainted with each other. Stevens remarked that the group &quot;felt comfortable with each other from the beginning&quot;. Several members of the group said that the &quot;S&quot; in S Club 7 stands for Simon, after the group&#x27;s creator, although the official explanation of the meaning has always been ambiguous. At one point they were nearly called &quot;Sugar Club&quot; instead of the name that stuck. Another theory is that the group is so-named because &quot;S&quot; is the first letter of the word &quot;seven&quot;. McIntosh, in a December 2012 interview, said a lot of Fuller&#x27;s success has been based on the number 19 (owning 19 Entertainment); therefore as &quot;S&quot; is the 19th letter of the alphabet, the &quot;S&quot; was put into S Club 7.

=== 1999–2000: Debut and success ===
S Club 7 rose to fame in a children&#x27;s television series, &quot;Miami 7,&quot; first broadcast on CBBC between April and July 1999. The members played fictional versions of themselves and went on adventures and performed a song in each episode. In the US, the show was renamed &quot;S Club 7 in Miami&quot; and broadcast on Fox Family. By 2000, it had been sold to 100 countries and viewed by 90 million people. The use of the television show to publicise the group was likened to the Monkees.

S Club 7 released their debut single, &quot;Bring It All Back&quot;, on 9 June 1999, which &quot;The Guardian&quot; likened to the Jackson 5. It reached number one on the UK Singles Chart and was certified platinum. S Club 7&#x27;s debut album, &quot;S Club&quot;, was released in October 1999. It reached number two in the UK Albums Chart and was certified double platinum. In 2001, the group released a fashion line targeted at teenagers.
In September 1999, &quot;S Club Party&quot; entered the UK charts at number two and number one in New Zealand. The double A-side with the ballad &quot;Two in a Million&quot; and the uptempo &quot;You&#x27;re My Number One&quot;, reached number two in the UK charts in December 1999. 

In February 2000, S Club 7 won for British Breakthrough Act award at the 2000 BRIT Awards. Hasbro announced a licensing deal to create S Club 7 dolls. In April 2000, S Club&#x27;s second television series, &quot;L.A. 7&quot; (renamed &quot;S Club 7 in L.A.&quot; in the US), began airing. Later that year, S Club 7 starred in the television series &quot;S Club 7 Go Wild!&quot;, in which they travelled the world raising awareness of endangered species. &quot;Reach&quot;, another retro-styled uptempo track, was released as a single in May 2000 and reached number two on the UK charts. 

S Club 7&#x27;s second album, &quot;7,&quot; was released on 12 June 2000. It reached number one in the UK charts and was certified triple platinum in the UK and gold in the US. The second single from the album, &quot;Natural&quot;, reached number three in September 2000.
That October, S Club 7 launched the annual Poppy Appeal campaign with Dame Thora Hird. Alongside numerous other artists, they contributed vocals to a cover of the Rolling Stones song &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll&quot; for Children&#x27;s Promise, an alliance of seven children&#x27;s charities. It entered the UK charts at number nineteen. In November 2000, S Club 7 recorded the ballad &quot;Never Had a Dream Come True&quot;, the year&#x27;s official song for the Children in Need charity campaign, which became a number one in the UK and a top-ten hit in the US.

===2001: &quot;Sunshine&quot;===
S Club 7 released their third studio album, &quot;Sunshine&quot;, on 26 November 2001. The lead single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Movin&#x27;&quot;, released in April 2001, marked a more sophisticated sound, likened to the 1983 Michael Jackson song &quot;Billie Jean&quot;. It reached number one, went platinum and became the seventh-best-selling single of 2001. It won The Record of the Year and earned S Club 7 their second BRIT Award, this time for best British single. S Club 7 donated more than £200,000 to Children in Need after it reached number one.
On 20 March 2001, Cattermole, Lee and McIntosh were caught with cannabis in Covent Garden, London. They were cautioned by police at Charing Cross Police Station and released without charge. They released an apology through their publicity firm. BT and Cadbury, who had sponsorship deals with S Club 7, said they were &quot;disappointed&quot; but kept their contracts with the group, while the Quaker Oats Company ended talks with 19 Entertainment. Pepsi signed a sponsorship deal with S Club 7 within a month of the caution. PMS, a merchandising company, sued the group for £800,000, claiming that the drugs scandal ruined its sales.

After spending most of early 2001 rehearsing, the S Club Party 2001 tour began on 19 May 2001. Once the tour was over, the group flew to the United States to film the third series of their television show &quot;Hollywood 7&quot;. The group had to continuously cope with intense schedules and early starts whilst filming for the programme.

Cattermole and Spearritt began dating in 2001 and were in a relationship until 2008. The relationship was kept secret for the first six months. Cattermole later said it had been &quot;forced&quot; by management and did not happen &quot;organically&quot;, as their romance had been written into &quot;Hollywood 7.&quot; &quot;Hollywood 7&quot; aired alongside a new CBBC reality show, &quot;S Club Search&quot;, which invited children to extend the S Club brand and audition to form a younger version of the group. The new group were to be chosen to sing with S Club 7 on Children in Need 2001 and to tour with them on their future &quot;S Club 7 Carnival 2002&quot; tour. The winning children formed a new group, S Club Juniors, and had six top-ten UK hits.

In November, they recorded a second Children in Need single, &quot;Have You Ever&quot;, co-written by Chris Braide and Cathy Dennis. The performance on the night featured many primary school children who had pre-recorded their own versions of the chorus, including the first television appearance by S Club Juniors. The single became the S Club 7&#x27;s fourth number one and the 21st-biggest-selling single of 2001.

=== 2002: Cattermole&#x27;s departure ===
In January 2002, S Club 7 embarked upon their second arena tour.

The third single from &quot;Sunshine&quot;, &quot;You&quot;, reached number two in the UK. The group was disappointed by the choice of single, as they had hoped to continue the more contemporary sound established by &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Movin&#x27;&quot;. Cattermole said later that they had &quot;wanted to be perceived as cool since the very beginning&quot; but that their management had &quot;taken it away&quot;. 

In 2002, Cattermole left S Club 7 to rejoin his school metal band, Skua. He later described frustration with the S Club 7 management, and said that &quot;things were being handled so badly, I had to go&quot;. Cattermole stayed with S Club 7 until June 2002, featuring in four episodes of their final television series, &quot;Viva S Club&quot;. His final concert before his departure was Party at the Palace, part of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Golden Jubilee celebrations. Skua failed to secure a record deal.

After Cattermole&#x27;s departure, the group was renamed S Club. The remaining members re-signed their deal with Fuller and their record company. &quot;Alive&quot;, S Club&#x27;s first single without Cattermole, reached number five on the UK Singles Chart, and their fourth album, &quot;Seeing Double&quot;, reached number 17. O&#x27;Meara announced that she would step back from performing for the remainder of the year due to a back condition.

=== 2003: Film and breakup ===
In April 2003, S Club released their first feature film, &quot;Seeing Double&quot;, a children&#x27;s fantasy, in which the group fought the evil scientist Victor Gaghan in his quest to clone the world&#x27;s pop stars. The film&#x27;s release was marred by rumours that the group were about to split, which they denied.

According to Spearritt, of the €75 million the group had made for Fuller, whilst the members had received €150,000 each a year. The group members travelled economy on flights and prepared their own food and laundry when working abroad. Spearritt&#x27;s parents reportedly hired lawyers to collect payments owed to them by Fuller and his management company.

Ten days after the release of &quot;Seeing Double&quot;, during their &quot;S Club United&quot; tour on 21 April 2003, S Club announced on stage that they were breaking up. They cited a mutual split, saying it was time &quot;to move on and to face new challenges&quot;. Spearritt said that &quot;she and her fellow bandmates wanted to do their own thing&quot;. Fans expressed anger after S Club had denied rumours of a split only weeks prior. Their final single was a double A-side, coupling &quot;Love Ain&#x27;t Gonna Wait for You&quot;, from their fourth album &quot;Seeing Double&quot;, with a new ballad, &quot;Say Goodbye&quot;, released on 26 May, which reached number two in the UK. On 2 June, a greatest hits album, &quot;,&quot; was released, containing the previously unreleased track, &quot;Everybody Get Pumped&quot;. It reached number two in the United Kingdom.

===2003–2008: Solo projects===
In 2003, Stevens signed a £1.5 million four-album deal with Polydor and Fuller. Her debut solo album, &quot;Funky Dory&quot;, reached number nine on the UK Albums Chart and was certified gold.

In 2004, Spearritt acted in the films &quot;Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London&quot; and &quot;Seed of Chucky&quot;, and played the lead role of Abby Maitland for five series of the ITV science fiction series &quot;Primeval&quot;.

In January 2007, O&#x27;Meara joined the fifth series of the British reality television show &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, broadcast on Channel 4. She and other contestants Danielle Lloyd and Jade Goody were accused of making racist and bullying comments about the Indian contestant Shilpa Shetty, including saying that Indians were thin because they were &quot;sick all the time&quot; as a result of undercooking their food. The incident drew record numbers of viewer complaints and international media coverage. After leaving the show, O&#x27;Meara denied that she was racist and said that the show&#x27;s editing had misconstrued her behaviour.

In 2008, O&#x27;Meara, Cattermole and McIntosh began performing at British nightclubs, universities and holiday camps as S Club 3, joined occasionally by other former members. Cattermole later declared bankruptcy and sold his 2000 BRIT Award at auction. He worked various other jobs, such as a community radio manager and as a psychic.

===2014–2015: Reunion===
On 14 November 2014, S Club 7 reunited for a BBC &quot;Children in Need&quot; telethon, performing a medley of &quot;S Club Party&quot;, &quot;Reach&quot;, &quot;Bring It All Back&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Movin&#x27;&quot;.

On 28 April 2015, S Club 7 reissued &quot;Best: The Greatest Hits of S Club 7&quot;, with a previously unreleased song, &quot;Rain&quot;, as well as &quot;Friday Night&quot; from the &quot;S Club&quot; album. In May, S Club 7 performed in UK arenas on the Bring It All Back 2015 tour. By December 2017, the group had reverted to a trio once more and released the single, &quot;Family&quot;.

In 2019, Cattermole said that Fuller, not the group members, had been signed to Polydor as S Club 7. The members were merely affiliates and received &quot;pittance&quot; from merchandise. In January 2023, Spearritt said she had been forced into homelessness, living in four temporary homes over a six-month period. She said that people wrongly assumed the members of S Club 7 were millionaires, and that they had not been on a good wage compared to the modern music industry.

===2023–present: Second reunion and death of Cattermole===
On 13 February 2023, S Club 7 announced on &quot;The One Show&quot; that they would reunite for a two-week 25th-anniversary tour that October. On 6 April, at age 46, Cattermole died of several heart conditions: cardiac arrhythmia, acute myocardial ischemia and severe coronary artery atheroma and intraplaque haemorrhage. Following his death, &quot;Best: The Greatest Hits of S Club 7&quot; reached number seven on the Official Album Downloads Chart Top 100. On 14 May, the group announced they had (for a second time) changed their name to S Club and that Spearritt would not join them on their coming tour, which they would honour as the Good Times Tour as a tribute to Cattermole. Though Lee said Spearritt remained a member of the group, other sources reported that she had left. On 30 June &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Movin&#x27;&quot; entered the vinyl charts at number one.

On 26 July, S Club released their first new single in more than 20 years, &quot;These Are the Days&quot;, in memory of Cattermole. It was written and produced by S Club&#x27;s original songwriting team; Barrett described it as &quot;a nod to our old sound&quot;. Spearritt did not take part, saying she was still too upset by Cattermole&#x27;s death.

The group partnered with the British Heart Foundation to raise awareness of heart conditions and raise funds for research. The Good Times Tour began on 12 October at the Manchester Arena, with the group paying tribute to Cattermole. A review noted that the members may have been lip syncing during some of their UK tour performances. The group also announced their first ever North American tour as a second leg of their Good Times tour.

S Club performed at the 2023 Jingle Bell Ball on 10 December.

On 7 March 2024, a new version of the song, &quot;Good Times&quot; featuring McIntosh and Lee on lead vocals, was released on digital platforms in honour of Cattermole&#x27;s birthday.

==Musical style==
The style of music S Club 7 has is usually pop, or more specifically bubblegum pop. Their first two singles had vocals shared equally amongst the seven members of the group, and it was not until their third single, &quot;Two in a Million&quot;, that O&#x27;Meara became known as their lead vocalist. Although the band were to progressively change their style over the four years they were together, even their first album had many tracks atypical of the pop genre: &quot;You&#x27;re My Number One&quot; and &quot;Everybody Wants Ya&quot; were Motown-driven, whereas &quot;Viva La Fiesta&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Feel Good Thing&quot; were both bouncy, salsa-driven Latino songs. Over the years their style and direction changed progressively with each new album. Their second album &quot;7&quot; had songs with styles that somewhat opposed the traditional pop songs that rival pop bands of the nineties were releasing. With the release of &quot;Natural&quot; in 2000, S Club 7 showcased a new R&amp;B-lite sound. The release of their third album, &quot;Sunshine&quot;, gave audiences their biggest change: the album contained tracks such as the disco-influenced &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Movin&#x27;&quot; and the R&amp;B ballad &quot;Show Me Your Colours&quot;. The album marked a more mature approach for the band. After the departure of Cattermole, S Club released their fourth and final album, &quot;Seeing Double&quot;, including the single &quot;Alive&quot;, which was called a power-packed dance floor filler. The single has a style similar to that of their final single, &quot;Love Ain&#x27;t Gonna Wait for You&quot;. The album contained dance tracks that varied from their original bubblegum pop stylings, such as the sex for the CBBC generation on &quot;Hey Kitty Kitty&quot;.

A reviewer for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, referring to &quot;Gangsta Love&quot;, said &quot;S Club&#x27;s spiritual home is the suburban disco, not urban underground clubs, and their attempt to go garage on &quot;Gangsta Love&quot; ends up amusing rather than authentic&quot;.

<doc id="144453" wikidata="Q467787" url="?curid=144453" title="Lady Ottoline Morrell">
<text>Lady Ottoline Violet Anne Morrell (née Cavendish-Bentinck; 16 June 1873 – 21 April 1938) was an English aristocrat and society hostess. Her patronage was influential in artistic and intellectual circles, where she befriended writers including Aldous Huxley, Siegfried Sassoon, T. S. Eliot and D. H. Lawrence, and artists including Mark Gertler, Dora Carrington and Gilbert Spencer.

== Early life ==
Born Ottoline Violet Anne Cavendish-Bentinck, she was the daughter of Lieutenant-General Arthur Cavendish-Bentinck (son of Lord and Lady Charles Bentinck) and his second wife, the former Augusta Browne, later created Baroness Bolsover. Lady Ottoline&#x27;s great-great-uncle (through her paternal grandmother, Lady Charles Bentinck) was the 1st Duke of Wellington. Through her father, Arthur, she was a first cousin once removed of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, and thus a first cousin twice removed of Queen Elizabeth II, both of whom descended from Arthur&#x27;s brother Charles Cavendish-Bentinck.

Ottoline was granted the rank of a daughter of a duke with the courtesy title of &quot;Lady&quot; soon after her half-brother William succeeded to the Dukedom of Portland in 1879, at which time the family moved into Welbeck Abbey in Nottinghamshire. The dukedom was a title which belonged to the head of the Cavendish-Bentinck family and which passed to Lady Ottoline&#x27;s branch upon the death of their cousin, the 5th Duke of Portland, in December 1879.

In 1899, Ottoline began studying political economy and Roman history as an out-student at Somerville College, Oxford.

== Notable love affairs ==
Morrell was known to have had many lovers. Her first love affair was with an older man, the physician and writer Axel Munthe, but she rejected his impulsive proposal of marriage because her spiritual beliefs were incompatible with his atheism. In February 1902, she married the MP Philip Morrell, with whom she shared a passion for art and a strong interest in Liberal politics. They had what would now be known as an open marriage for the rest of their lives.

Philip&#x27;s extramarital affairs produced several children who were cared for by his wife, who also struggled to conceal evidence of his mental instability. The Morrells themselves had two children (twins): a son, Hugh, who died in infancy; and a daughter, Julian, whose first marriage was to Victor Goodman and second marriage was to Igor Vinogradoff.

Morrell had a long affair with philosopher Bertrand Russell, with whom she exchanged more than 3,500 letters. She also had an affair with Virginia Woolf. 

Her lovers may have included the painters Augustus John and Henry Lamb, the artist Dora Carrington, and the art historian Roger Fry. 

In her later years she had a brief affair with a gardener, Lionel Gomme, who was employed at Garsington. According to some literary critics, the fling of Morrell with &quot;Tiger&quot;, a young stonemason who came to carve plinths for her garden statues, influenced the story in D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s novel &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;.

Her circle of friends included many authors, artists, sculptors, and poets. Her work as a patron was enduring and influential, notably in her contribution to the Contemporary Art Society during its early years.

==Hospitality==

The Morrells maintained a townhouse in Bedford Square in Bloomsbury and also owned a country house at Peppard, near Henley on Thames. Selling the house at Peppard in 1911, they subsequently bought and restored Garsington Manor near Oxford. Morrell delighted in opening both as havens for like-minded people. Of Garsington, she said, &quot;it seemed good to gather round us young and enthusiastic pacifists.&quot; 44 Bedford Square served as her London salon, while Garsington provided a convenient retreat, near enough to London for many of their friends to join them for weekends. She took a keen interest in the work of young contemporary artists, such as Stanley Spencer, and she was particularly close to Mark Gertler and Dora Carrington, who were regular visitors to Garsington during the war. Gilbert Spencer lived for a while in a house on the Garsington estate.

During World War I, the Morrells were pacifists. They invited conscientious objectors such as Duncan Grant, Clive Bell and Lytton Strachey to take refuge at Garsington. Siegfried Sassoon, recuperating there after an injury, was encouraged to go absent without leave as a protest against the war.

The hospitality offered by the Morrells was such that most of their guests had no suspicion that they were in financial difficulties. Many of them assumed that Ottoline was a wealthy woman. This was far from being the case and during 1927, the Morrells were compelled to sell the manor house and its estate, and move to more modest quarters in Gower Street, London. In 1928, she was diagnosed with cancer, which resulted in a long hospitalisation and the removal of her lower teeth and part of her jaw.

== Later life ==
Later, Lady Ottoline remained a regular host to the adherents of the Bloomsbury Group, in particular Virginia Woolf, and to many other artists and authors, who included W. B. Yeats, L. P. Hartley, and T. S. Eliot, and maintained an enduring friendship with Welsh painter Augustus John. She was an influential patron to many of them, and a valued friend, who nevertheless attracted understandable mockery, due to her combination of eccentric attire with an aristocratic manner, extreme shyness and a deep religious faith that set her apart from her times.

In 1912, Lady Ottoline was Vice President of The Eugenics Society, alongside writer and sexologist Henry Havelock Ellis, while Major Leonard Darwin, son of Charles Darwin, was President. 

Her work as a decorator, colourist, and garden designer remains undervalued, but it was for her great gift for friendship that she was mourned when she died in April 1938. She died from an experimental drug given by a doctor.

The novelist Henry Green wrote to Philip Morrell of &quot;her love for all things true and beautiful which she had more than anyone ... no one can ever know the immeasurable good she did&quot;.

Monuments carved by Eric Gill are in St Winifred&#x27;s Church, Holbeck and St Mary&#x27;s Church, Garsington.
A blue plaque in her honour was erected at her London home, 10 Gower Street, by the Greater London Council, in 1986.

==Literary legacy==

Morrell wrote two volumes of memoirs, but these were edited and revised after her death. She also maintained detailed journals, over a period of 20 years, which remain unpublished. But perhaps Lady Ottoline&#x27;s most interesting literary legacy is the wealth of representations of her that appear in 20th-century literature.

She was the inspiration for Mrs Bidlake in Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Point Counter Point&quot;, for Hermione Roddice in D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Women in Love&quot;, for Lady Caroline Bury in Graham Greene&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Battlefield&quot;, and for Lady Sybilline Quarrell in Alan Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Forty Years On&quot;. &quot;The Coming Back&quot; (1933), another novel which portrays her, was written by Constance Malleson, one of Ottoline&#x27;s many rivals for the affection of Bertrand Russell, as was &quot;Pugs and Peacocks&quot; (1921) by Gabriel Cannan. Some critics consider her the inspiration for Lawrence&#x27;s Lady Chatterley.

Huxley&#x27;s &quot;roman à clef&quot; &quot;Crome Yellow&quot; depicts the life at a thinly veiled Garsington, with a caricature of Lady Ottoline Morrell for which she never forgave him. &quot;In Confidence,&quot; a short story by Katherine Mansfield, portrays the &quot;wits of Garsington&quot; some four years in advance of &quot;Crome Yellow&quot;, and with more wit than Huxley, according to Mansfield&#x27;s biographer Antony Alpers. Published in &quot;The New Age&quot; of 24 May 1917, it was not reprinted until 1984 in Alpers&#x27; collection of her short stories.

==Portrayals in the arts==
Non-literary portraits are also part of this interesting legacy, as seen in the artistic photographs of her by Cecil Beaton. There are portraits by Henry Lamb, Duncan Grant, Augustus John, and others.

She is portrayed by Tilda Swinton in Derek Jarman&#x27;s film &quot;Wittgenstein&quot;, by Roberta Taylor in Brian Gilbert&#x27;s film &quot;Tom &amp; Viv&quot;, by Penelope Wilton in Christopher Hampton&#x27;s film &quot;Carrington&quot; and by Suzanne Bertish in Terence Davies&#x27; film &quot;Benediction&quot;.

The first production of a biographical play, &quot;Ottoline&quot; by Janet Bolam, took place in the gardens of Garsington Manor in July 2021.

==Photography==
Morrell took hundreds of photographs of the people in her circle. Carolyn Heilbrun edited &quot;Lady Ottoline&#x27;s Album&quot; (1976), a collection of snapshots and photographic portraits of Morrell and of her famous contemporaries, mostly taken by Morrell.

<text>Beverley is a market town and civil parish in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. It is located north-west of Hull. At the 2021 census the built-up area of the town had a population of 30,930, and the smaller civil parish had a population of 18,014. It is the county town of the East Riding of Yorkshire. 

The town was founded in the seventh century by John of Beverley, who established a church in the area. It was originally named &quot;Inderawuda&quot;, and was part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. The town came under Viking control in the 850s, then became part of the Kingdom of England. John of Beverley was made a saint in 1037, and the town was a place of pilgrimage for the remainder of the Middle Ages. It continued to grow under the Normans, when its trading industry was first established, and eventually became a significant wool-trading town and the tenth-largest settlement in England. After the Reformation, the stature of Beverley was much reduced. 

The town contains several landmarks, including Beverley Minster, Westwood common, North Bar gatehouse, St Mary&#x27;s Church, and Beverley Racecourse. It inspired the naming of the city of Beverly, Massachusetts, which in turn was the indirect source of the name for Beverly Hills, California, which was named after its Beverly Farms neighbourhood.

==History==
===Northumbrian and Viking period===

The origins of Beverley can be traced back to the time of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria in the 7th century. The first structure built in the area, which at the time was known as Inderawuda (meaning &quot;in the wood of the men of Deira&quot;), was a Christian church dedicated to St John the Evangelist. This was founded by the Bishop of York who later became known as John of Beverley, who was believed to have performed miracles during his lifetime, and was later venerated as a saint. Around the 850s, the now developed monastery was abandoned in a hurry; historians presume this was because of the invasion of the so-called Great Heathen Army of Vikings who had invaded England, and established the Kingdom of Jórvík in the Yorkshire area. However, the population was increased during the 10th century, by people who came to venerate Saint John of Beverley.

Before the Battle of Brunanburh, possibly located further north than Beverley, the King of England at the time Athelstan visited Inderawuda, he prayed all night and saw a vision saying he would be victorious: in return he helped the town to grow greatly. The name of the town was changed to Bevreli or &quot;Beverlac&quot;, meaning beaver-clearing or beaver-lake, in the 10th century; a reference to the colonies of beavers in the River Hull at the time. The last three Anglo-Saxon archbishops of York helped Beverley to develop, via the rise in prominence of Beverley Minster and the town in general; along with York itself, Ripon and Southwell, Beverley became one of the most important Christian centres of Northern England. Ealdred was declared by king Edward the Confessor as &quot;sole Lord of the Manor of Beverley&quot;. Beverley developed as a trade centre, producing textiles, leather and objects made out of antler.
Beverley Minster was constructed in 1220 and there were 3 phases to its construction. 1220–1260, 1320–1348 Stopped during the black death and again in 1420–1440 but Beverley Minster is not complete. The chapter house was demolished in 1660 and only the doors remain in the church.

===Normans and the Middle Ages===

After the Norman conquest, many pilgrims flocked to Beverley upon hearing reports of miracles wrought by the town&#x27;s founder, John. However, much of the North of England rejected Norman rule, and sought to reinstate Viking rule. Towns in Yorkshire were obliterated by the Normans in response, with the Harrying of the North; but Beverley itself was spared, upon the Normans hearing about the town&#x27;s saintly history. In 1086, Beverley was recorded in the Domesday Book as comprising around 19 households and lying within the Hundred of Sneculfcros. In the 12th century, Beverley developed from a settlement of several thousand, to an extensive town, stretching from around the North Bar area to the Beck in an elongated pattern, it was granted borough status in 1122 by Thurstan. Industry grew further, Beverley especially traded wool with the cloth making towns of the Low Countries.
The town suffered a large fire in 1188 which destroyed numerous houses, and damaged Beverley Minster. Lady Sybil de Valines gave the Manor of the Holy Trinity on the east side of Beverley to the Knights Hospitallers in 1201, where they established a preceptory; also to be found in Beverley during the 13th century were Dominican friars who were given some land by Henry III upon which they erected buildings. Franciscans were present. A dispute arose between local farmers and the archbishop during the 13th century, about land rights; after the locals demanded a royal inquiry, the archbishop granted the townspeople pasture and pannage in the Westwood and other places.

During the 14th century, England experienced periods of famine caused by poor weather conditions which destroyed crops. There were other nationwide issues to contend with at the time, such as the Black Death, the Hundred Years&#x27; War and the Great Rising. However, Beverley continued to grow: and by 1377, had become the 10th largest town in England.

The earliest surviving secular drama in English, &quot;The Interlude of the Student and the Girl&quot; (), may have originated from Beverley.

===Reformation decline in Tudor times===

Beverley was reliant on pilgrimage, but changes brought about by the Reformation impacted upon this tradition, resulting in a decline in its status. Local Beverley man Cardinal John Fisher was martyred along with Thomas More for refusing to accept the Tudor King Henry VIII as Head of the Church of England. In October 1536, there was a popular rising in Beverley where 500 men in the town gathered at the Westwood under the leadership of a local lawyer named William Stapleton, later becoming part of the larger Pilgrimage of Grace in York and, in turn, part of the 30,000 rebels opposing Henry&#x27;s new religious laws. Henry followed through with the break from Rome and the Dissolution of the Monasteries, dissolving the Dominican Friary in Beverley and taking their land for himself, the Knights Templars in Beverley suffered the same fate in 1540.

As a result of the tensions across the North of England, governance duties were handed over to the Council of the North so the Tudors could control the area at arm&#x27;s length. Beverley was visited by John Leland, the man known as the &quot;father of English local history&quot;, he wrote of the town in some detail, estimating the population of the time at around 5,000. Beverley Minster was threatened with demolition by its new owners who wanted to profit from selling its stone and lead, however the local people led by wealthy merchant Richard Gray saved it from this fate. During the time of Elizabeth I, Beverley was endowed with its own mayor; Edward Ellerker was the first to take this position. The gap between Beverley&#x27;s rich and poor became more pronounced during the Tudor era, due to large unemployment. The substantial drop in pilgrimage to Beverley in honour of its founder John of Beverley affected the jobs of the working class as it was Beverley&#x27;s main industry.

===Civil war and Restoration recovery===

In the early 17th century Beverley was affected by the plague which caused many deaths. Due to the close geographical proximity to Hull, focus on the area became magnified when the people of Hull refused to open the gates to Charles I a couple of months before the fighting began in the English Civil War. After being turned away from Hull, the king spent three weeks as a guest in a house at North Bar in Beverley, where he was openly greeted with the ringing of St Mary&#x27;s Church bells. Beverley was initially royalist: however, it was taken by the parliamentarians of Hull, forcing the king to flee. A royalist army led by William Cavendish defeated Thomas Fairfax to reclaim the town for the royalists; from here they launched another Siege of Hull. Eventually the parliamentarians won the civil war and established the Commonwealth of England, in which alehouses were shut on Sundays and theatres and race meetings abandoned: the Puritans visited the then Church of England houses of worship and destroyed anything they thought to be idolatrous.

Beverley Minster managed to escape this fate, in part due to the prominence of the Percy family and the fact that the church housed memorials to their ancestors. Beverley&#x27;s Quakers were not so fortunate, and were strongly repressed by the Puritans. The English Restoration with Charles II coming to power was generally well received in Beverley, and his royal coat of arms was hung in the Minster and remains there. In terms of trade Beverley was not rich in the 17th century but had improved slightly, the majority were based in agriculture. During the Georgian era, Beverley was the county town of the East Riding of Yorkshire and became the prime market town in the area during the 18th century; competition from Pocklington, Howden and Market Weighton was insufficient. The replacing of old timber buildings with new ones in the Georgian style helped the town recover in prestige, with the religious structures also undergoing restorations. During the Industrial Revolution, Beverley&#x27;s people retained most agricultural jobs, though there was a presence of iron workers within the town.

Beverley had a cattle market for 1300 years, it served as the centre for the region&#x27;s livestock trade until it closed. The site is now the car park for Tesco supermarket which opened in 2002.

===Industrial revolution and military===
The population of the borough and liberties of the town in 1841 was 8,671.

Hodgsons Tannery (1816–1979) was a major employer in the town. The tannery turned animal hides into leather. At the time of closure there were 750 redundancies. After Hodgsons closed, part of the factory site was used by Clairant (chemical production company). However, this had also closed by 2005 with the loss of 120 jobs. Another tannery Melrose Tanners, formerly Cussons, on Keldgate, closed in 1986.

Armstrong Patents Co. Ltd. (1917–1995) was also a well known company and major employer. The factory on East Gate mainly produced Armstrong shock absorbers until it closed in 1981.

Beverley Shipyard opened in 1884 and continued to build ships until the yard closed completely in 1977. From 1905 until 1962 the yard was owned by Cook, Welton &amp; Gemmell Shipbuilders. In 1954 the yard employed 650 people. Ships were launched sideways into the River Hull.

Due to an increase in population, some of the entrances into the town (such as the brick-built Bars) were taken down to accommodate traffic. Although population figures rose steeply, the increase was not as much as in nearby Hull, or most of the rest of England. Beverley&#x27;s religious associations remained during the 19th century: as well as the majority Anglican faith, there were several non-conformist religions practised such as Methodism with John Wesley previously having preached there; with the completion of the Catholic Emancipation and the refoundation of the Catholic hierarchy, the Diocese of Beverley in 1850 was chosen to cover Yorkshire, before being divided into two dioceses.

Communications were improved with the opening of the Beverley railway station in October 1846. In 1884, Andrew Cochrane founded a shipyard at Grovehill on the River Hull. It was purchased by Cook, Welton &amp; Gemmell in 1901. The yard was a leading builder of trawlers for the Hull deep-sea fishing fleet. In both world wars the yard built minesweepers for the Royal Navy. The deep-sea trawler Arctic Corsair now preserved in Hull was built there in 1960. The yard closed for ship construction in 1977 and the site is now used for boat repairs.

A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of Victoria Barracks in 1878. The barracks closed in 1977, and the only army presence in the area is now the Defence School of Transport at Normandy Barracks Leconfield, two miles to the north. In the First World War the Royal Flying Corps had an airfield on the Westwood. The site is now Beverley Racecourse

===World Wars and modern===
The Second World War saw the nearby city of Hull suffer significantly from aerial bombardment: however, Beverley was more fortunate and did not endure such heavy attacks. Since the war, Beverley has gone through some remodelling, and has grown in size. It attracts thousands of tourists each year who come to view the religious buildings and visit Beverley Racecourse. 

In the 1960s, plans to redevelop Armstrong&#x27;s Engineering Works for housing put the Dominican Friary at threat of demolition: the friary building was listed in 1965 and is now in use as a youth hostel. Housing was developed on the former works site in the 1980s on what is now Dominican Walk and its adjacent streets.

In 2007, Beverley was named as the best place to live in the United Kingdom in an &quot;Affordable Affluence&quot; study by the Royal Bank of Scotland.

In late 2015 a new shopping and entertainment complex opened in Flemingate (on the site of the old Hodgsons Tannery). Among the attractions is a six-screen cinema and a Premier Inn hotel. East Riding College (formerly Beverley College of Further Education) also relocated to Flemingate, after the previous site was sold for a housing development.

== Governance ==

During the Middle Ages, Beverley was governed by aldermen known as the twelve keepers, they oversaw the general running of the town and the maintaining of law and order. The borough corporation was reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 and formed the local government of the town until 1974. In 1974, following the Local Government Act 1972, the former area of Beverley borough was merged with Beverley Rural District and Haltemprice Urban District to form an enlarged Beverley borough in the county of Humberside. Since 1996, it has formed part of the East Riding of Yorkshire district and is the county town, as it was before 1974.

Beverley was represented in the Houses of Parliament by the Members of Parliament (MPs) for Yorkshire until Beverley was given parliamentary borough status from 1563. Beverley was able to elect two MPs for its entire time as a parliamentary borough; the right of election was vested not in the population as a whole, but in the . Elections became notoriously corrupt, to the extent that the constituency was abolished in 1870 and incorporated into the East Riding constituency. During the 1950 general election a Beverley county constituency was created, covering half of the East Riding, with Bridlington covering the other half. It became part of the Haltemprice constituency in 1955, until it reverted to the Beverley constituency in 1983. Since 1997 Beverley has been part of the Beverley and Holderness constituency, a Conservative Party stronghold.

In 2019 the Liberal Democrats made huge gains in the local elections, taking out all of the Conservative seats and taking control of the Town Council, whilst also gaining two seats from the Conservatives on East Riding of Yorkshire Council in St Mary&#x27;s Ward. The only Conservative representatives for Beverley are in Minster and Woodmansey Ward, where the Conservatives held all three seats.

==Planned expansion==
In 2014 local authorities planned to build 3,300 new houses in Beverley, which would increase the size of the town by 20%. A spokesperson for East Riding of Yorkshire Council said: &quot;The evidence recognises that the East Riding is generally a high demand area with strong levels of in-migration&quot;. The plans are opposed by some residents, such as those in the North Beverley Action Group.

==Education==

Beverley is home to the oldest state school in England, in the form of Beverley Grammar School. The school was founded in 700 AD by Saint John of Beverley. Several notable alumni have attended the school, including chemist Smithson Tennant, who discovered iridium and osmium, Thomas Percy, who was involved in the Gunpowder Plot and Paul Robinson, a football goalkeeper who has represented England national football team (2003–2009). In the modern day the school hosts around 800 pupils and has received favourable reports from Ofsted, however, in 2013 it was determined as requiring improvement.

There are other schools in Beverley, such as Beverley High School, which is a comprehensive school for girls: it has around 850 pupils, and is well above the national average based on the results of GCSE test performances. Beverley Grammar School and Beverley High School share a common sixth form, called the Beverley Joint Sixth.
Longcroft School is a co-educational school, with around 1,500 pupils consisting of both boys and girls. Longcroft School was founded in 1949 and officially opened in 1951 and is home to the Longcroft Gospel Choir, founded by Jonathan Chapman. The choir comprises pupils from Year 9 and above and several members of Longcroft School staff, and has a large repertoire of music. Over the choir&#x27;s period of existence, the choir has performed at venues such as Disneyland Paris and the Apple Store on Oxford Street, London, have released two of their own albums and have featured on a track by singer-songwriter Henry Priestman. But more recently in May 2015, it was announced that the Longcroft Gospel Choir will be one of twenty choirs in the UK to perform at and open the 2015 Rugby World Cup in London performing for the home team (England).

East Riding College has a campus in Beverley. The college offers various further education courses for school leavers and adults from the town.

==Religion==

Beverley&#x27;s largest religious denomination is Christianity; 79.9% of the people in the area polled as part of the United Kingdom Census 2001 professed the Christian faith, 8% above the national average.
Beverley Minster contains a tomb said to contain the bones of Saint John of Beverley who founded a monastery here and with it the town; another saint from Beverley is Saint John Fisher (born ). The minster was designated a Grade I listed building in 1950 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England.
Adherents of the Church of England are in the majority with three parishes; the ancient Beverley Minster, St Mary&#x27;s Church (designated a Grade I listed building in 1950 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England) and St Nicholas Church. Beverley is a suffragan bishopric of the Diocese of York represented by the Bishop of Beverley, created in 1994 to provide a provincial episcopal visitor for the Province of York. There is one Roman Catholic church in Beverley called St John&#x27;s which belongs to the Diocese of Middlesbrough; when the Catholic Emancipation was complete in 1850 the Diocese of Beverley was established to cover all of Yorkshire, but it was later broken up into two dioceses, Leeds and Middlesbrough. Methodism is represented in Beverley with around three places of worship. Latimer Congregational Church, in the east of Beverley, is affiliated to the Evangelical Fellowship of Congregational Churches.

Since their suppression in the 17th century, Quakers established a meeting house and have worshipped in Beverley ever since. Their present meeting house – the third – in Quaker Lane – was built in 1961.

Missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from the United States first arrived in Beverley in 1850 and quickly established a local congregation. In 1963 a large new chapel on Manor Road was built by local church members. Due to the continued growth of the Beverley congregation both the building and car parks were enlarged in the late 1990s.

==Culture and amenities==

A market day is central to culture in Beverley; a smaller market day is held on Wednesday: however, the main event is on Saturday, with all of the stalls. Throughout each year there are various annual music festivals in the town, catering for different kinds of music. These include the Early Music Festival in May; the Beverley Folk Festival in June, which features three days of folk music, comedy and workshops; the Jazz Festival in August, followed by the Chamber Music Festival in September. Held monthly at the Beverley Memorial Hall is a local music event &quot;Sunday Live&quot;. It is also home to the popular Beverley Male Voice Choir.

Beverley hosts an annual literature festival, kite festival, a biennial puppet festival and Beverley town fair. Since 2006, Beverley Town Council has run an annual food festival in October. Including 70 stalls selling food produced in Beverley and the East Riding of Yorkshire, a 200-seat food theatre marquee, cookery demonstrations from local chefs, and street entertainment, the day-long event is attended by thousands of residents and visitors. In 2012, St Mary&#x27;s Church in Beverley hosted the first real ale and cider festival. Over 2,000 people attended the event. The festival has now moved to the Beverley Memorial Hall and still attracts over 2,500 people.

In terms of sport, the most noted field of participation is horse racing with Beverley Racecourse. The sport has a long history in Beverley, with evidence of a permanent race track reaching back as far as 1690, while its first grandstand was built in 1767. The town is represented in football by Beverley Town F.C., who currently play in the Northern Counties East League Premier Division, the 9th tier of English football.

A weekly 5k parkrun is held at the Westwood at 9:00am every Saturday.

Beverley town has a variety of public houses, some of which have become tourist attractions. Examples include the Sun Inn, the town&#x27;s oldest public house dating back to around 1530. There are over 40 public houses in Beverley – the vast majority have been there for over a century. Beverley is home to one of the last pubs in the world to still use authentic gas lighting; The White Horse Inn (or &quot;Nellie&#x27;s&quot; to the local population) is owned by the Samuel Smith Old Brewery company.

A purpose-built Post Office opened in Register Square in 1905. It continued to be the town&#x27;s Post Office, until being closed in early 2020 as part of a cost cutting exercise. Post Office services are now provided by the nearby WH Smith shop.

Beverley&#x27;s first cinema, the Marble Arch, opened in 1916, located on Butcher Row. It was closed and completely demolished by 1967 having in the last few years been used as a bingo hall. After demolition, the site was used as a supermarket. Originally it was known as Moores, but later it became Prestos, then Jacksons. It is now M&amp;S Food.

The Museum of Army Transport relocated from Leconfield to Beverley in 1983. The museum was housed on part of the former Hodgsons Tannery site. The last surviving Blackburn Beverley aircraft XB259 (named after the town, and built nearby in Brough) was on static display until the museum closed due to a funding shortfall in 2003. This and the neighbouring former Hodgsons Tannery is now occupied by Flemingate – a shopping centre including Dunelm, H&amp;M, Sports Direct, restaurants and cafes, and is also home to a Parkway Cinema and Premier Inn.

The current fire station opened in 1982 when New Walkergate (road) was constructed. The much smaller old fire station is now a GP surgery. 
The police station on Norfolk Street is part of the court complex built in about 1805, including a sessions house and a prison. The former courthouse is now a spa and the octagonal prison is a private home.

Beverley previously had two hospitals serving the town. The Westwood Hospital originally opened as the town&#x27;s Union Workhouse in 1861, but became a hospital in 1939 at the outbreak of World War II. The maternity ward closed in 1997. The hospital closed completely in 2011. The original main building has been converted to apartments. Beverley Cottage Hospital opened in Morton Lane 1885 and had closed by 1996. Beverley Community Hospital opened in 2012 on a new site.

The East Riding Theatre, housed in a former nonconformist chapel originally built in 1910, is a community initiative launched by a group of local volunteers and film and television actor Vincent Regan. First opened to the public in December 2014 and seating 200, it is run as a not-for profit organisation and a registered charity and presents regular drama productions and musical performances.

The Beverley Treasure House contains a library, archives, a museum, and an art gallery.

===Town fair===

Beverley has had a fair since medieval times. In the early days the fairs were places for trading goods and animals, and were useful for meeting people and finding news of what was happening elsewhere in the country. Towns were given the right to hold fairs by Royal charter. In the early 12th century Archbishop Thurstan was granted a charter to hold fairs four times a year, each lasting up to five days. Beverley&#x27;s medieval fairs were:
*Feast of St John of Beverley (7 May)
*Ascension Day (Early summer)
*Feast of St John the Baptist (21–5 June)
*Translation of St John of Beverley (25 October)

The four annual fairs survived until the 20th century, although the dates changed over the years. All these fairs were for the sale of cattle and horses and were held on North Bar Within or Without. One of the two market places, Saturday Market or Wednesday Market, was used at the same time for selling general goods. Another trading area was at Highgate where goods not generally sold on the weekly markets were available, attracting ‘foreigners’ or people from other areas such as York. The great horse fair was on Ascension Day-eve (the Cross Fair). A toll was charged for a horse entering the town and another if it was sold.

By the 20th century, the sale of livestock at fairs had dwindled. In 1928, sheep and cattle were only sold on the Ringing Day fair. The pleasure part of the fair, however, had gained great popularity. These funfairs were held on Saturday Market. As the fairground equipment became larger and heavier and the use of the motor vehicle became more widespread, Saturday Market place was no longer suitable for the purpose.

On 8 September 1958, Minute 581 of the Beverley Town Council states: “It was noted that the agreement between BTC and John Farrar and Joseph Shaw to hold four fairs a year on the Market Place expired after Midsummer Fair 1959”. On 27 October (Minute 694), “It was resolved that the fair should be removed from the Market Place.”
On 7 September 1959, the Town Clerk reported that Mr John Farrar and Joseph Shaw had accepted terms offered for use of space for the four fairs commencing with the October fair. The fair was held four times a year on Morton Lane car park, which also housed the Town’s coach park. In 2002, the East Riding of Yorkshire Council, against the wishes of a large number of the residents sold the Morton Lane car park to Tesco, leaving the Town with nowhere to hold the fair. The council offered space on the Westwood to hold the fair but the organisers together with the solicitors of The Showmen’s Guild demanded that they were allocated a site ‘within the walls of Beverley’ stating that The Royal Charter gave them that right.

In 2003, the Beverley Town Fair was, once again sited in the centre of the town on Saturday Market. The fair is now limited to one week a year starting on August Bank Holiday Sunday.

== Transport ==

The town is served by Beverley railway station on the Hull to Scarborough Line, with services currently run by Northern and a limited service between Beverley and London King&#x27;s Cross provided by Hull Trains. Before the mid-1960s, there was a direct York to Beverley Line via Market Weighton; the &quot;Minsters Rail Campaign&quot; is seeking to reinstate the closed line.

Beverley railway station was opened in October 1846 by the York and North Midland Railway and gained junction status nineteen years later when the North Eastern Railway opened its line to Market Weighton and York. The railway station, designed by George Townsend Andrews, is now a Grade II listed building and has an elegant overall roof.

The £13 million A1079 Beverley Bypass opened in May 1980; the road links York and Hull. East Yorkshire Motor Services provide internal town services, regular bus links with Hull city centre, as well as to local surrounding villages and places such as Hessle, Pocklington, Driffield, Market Weighton, Bridlington, York and Scarborough. The town has its own bus station. Beverley Beck is a canal which gives boats access to the town from the River Hull. The beck is used by fishermen for catching a large variety of fish such as pike, bream and carp. Previously, the Beverley Beck used to form a more significant role in transport as part of the trade industry, where Beverley was a trading post of the Hanseatic League. It remains home to the Beverley Barge Preservation Society in the modern day. Beverley is home to the notorious Grovehill junction which has 42 traffic lights.

==Literature==
Beverley is the main setting for Domini Highsmith&#x27;s &quot;Father Simeon&quot; trilogy: 
&quot;Keeper at the Shrine&quot; (1994), &quot;Guardian at the Gate&quot; (1995) and &quot;Master of the Keys&quot; (1996).

<text>Beverley Minster, otherwise known as the Parish Church of Saint John and Saint Martin, in Beverley, East Riding of Yorkshire, is a parish church in the Church of England. It is one of the largest parish churches in the UK, larger than one-third of all English cathedrals and is regarded as a Gothic masterpiece.

Originally a collegiate church, it was not selected as a bishop&#x27;s seat during the Dissolution of the Monasteries; nevertheless, it survived as a parish church and the chapter house and the attached church of St Martin were the only major parts of the building to be lost. It is part of the Major Churches Network and a Grade I listed building.

==History==
The minster owes its origin and much of its subsequent importance to Saint John of Beverley, Bishop of York (706–714?), who founded a monastery locally and whose remains still lie in a vault beneath the nave. Archaeological excavations in 1979–82 confirmed that a major church stood on or near the present minster site from to . That last date could support a tradition of the sacking of the monastery by Vikings.

Another tradition attributes to King Æthelstan the refoundation of the monastery as a collegiate church of secular canons. The establishment of a major minster and its privileges was more likely a gradual process but, by the early 11th century, Bishop John&#x27;s tomb had become a major pilgrimage centre. He was canonised in 1037, and his cult encouraged the growth of a town around the minster. The archbishops of York, the lords of Beverley throughout the Middle Ages, secured grants for four annual fairs which enhanced the town&#x27;s trading role. From the 12th century Beverley was a major exporter of wool to the Low Countries.

A 12th-century charter indicates substantial rebuilding work following the canonisation of St John of Beverley in 1037. Archbishop Kynesige (1051–60) added a high stone tower; his successor Ealdred (1060–69) expanded the church with a new presbytery. He also installed a painted and gilded ceiling from the presbytery to the tower. Nothing remains of this Anglo-Saxon church, and no records of building work under the Normans survive. However, large quantities of Norman masonry have been found in excavations throughout the town, and four large arches built behind the nave triforium during the 14th century are composed of reused Norman voussoirs.

In 1067/68 Gamel, Sheriff of York was informed in a writ by William the Conqueror that &quot;Archbishop Ealdred should draw up a &quot;privilegium&quot; for the lands belonging to the church of St John of Beverley and that they shall be free from the demands of the king, his reeves, and all his men, except for those of the archbishop and priests of the church.&quot;

Saint Thomas Becket of Canterbury (December 1119 or 20 – December 1170) was named Provost of Beverley in 1154.

===Rebuilding===
A fire in 1188 seriously damaged the minster and the town. Much of the church was damaged and complete rebuilding was required. Money was collected for the work and reconstruction began at the east end soon after the fire. During the construction, a new lantern tower over the eastern crossing designed to illuminate the shrine of St John was under construction, but it collapsed necessitating a partial rebuild of the church. Henry III granted 40 oaks from Sherwood Forest in 1252, and by the retrochoir, choir, chapter house, transepts, and crossing were complete. Filled with light, overwhelmingly tall and spacious, and speaking to the increasing skills of the stonecarvers, this new work was radically different from the old Saxon and Norman structure it replaced. It was the product of the novel structural systems and artistic development that together define the Gothic style, originating in France and brought to England in the late 12th century.

Work did not progress beyond the first bay of the nave. Of this Early Gothic building campaign, only the chapter house has been lost, although its wonderful staircase survives in the north choir aisle. The only major alteration was the insertion of a great Perpendicular east window, for which money was bequeathed in 1416.
A new shrine for St John was ordered from Roger de Faringdon of London in 1292, to which the saint&#x27;s remains were translated on 25 October 1307. Collections for further rebuilding were resumed in 1308, and work on the nave had begun by 1311. The architectural style current in England had developed into something much different from the Early Gothic displayed in the first part of the rebuilding; the new style is referred to as Decorated. More structurally daring, more richly decorated forms merge with the earlier, simpler forms in the nave of Beverley Minster, in an effort both to respect the older work and to bring it up to date. Building on the nave was ongoing in 1334, and may have been halted by the Black Death in 1348 as in many other instances across England.

Work did not resume until later in the century, when the nave was completed and the west front with its two great towers was built, . These towers are a superlative example of the Perpendicular style, and formed the inspiration for the present west towers of Westminster Abbey , designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor. By the early 15th century, with the building of the north porch, the Minster was structurally complete. The great east window (bequeathed in 1416 as previously mentioned), a chapel funded by the Percys (, in the extreme northeast corner of the church), and the choir stalls () were the only major later work.

Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland (1449–1489), was buried in the church after being murdered by his own retainers at Cockslodge near Thirsk, in 1489 during the Yorkshire rebellion over high taxes imposed by King Henry VII.

===English Reformation and beyond===
In 1548, the minster was reduced to the status of a parish church, the college of secular canons established before the Norman Conquest was dissolved (decreasing the minster&#x27;s staff from at least seventy-five to four), and the shrine of St John was dismantled. The chapter house, now unused, was demolished. By the early 17th century the parish church of St Martin, formerly attached to the three southwestern bays of the nave, was also gone.

As with many English churches during the wars of religion in the 16th century, Beverley Minster was not immune to dissension. Church authorities cracked down hard on those they felt were part of the &quot;Popish&quot; conspiracy contrary to royal decrees. &quot;Among those holding traditional beliefs were three of the clergy at the minster, who were charged with Popish practices in 1567; John Levet was a former member of the college and Richard Levet was presumably his brother. Both Levets were suspended from the priesthood for keeping prohibited equipment and books and when restored were ordered not to minister in Beverley or its neighbourhood.&quot;

By the early 18th century the church was in a state of decay. The stone vaulting used in all areas of the Minster called for flying buttresses, which had been constructed everywhere except on the north transept. By 1700, progressive structural failure of this transept over the centuries had almost brought about its collapse and the ruin of the crossing itself, with the transept gable overhanging the base by 4 ft (1.2 m). Restoration continued from 1717 to 1731 under Nicholas Hawksmoor. William Thornton of York, one of the supervisors of the project, devised an ingenious method of levering the wall back into place and securing it with a great wooden frame. The southwestern bays of the nave, where the north wall of St Martin&#x27;s parish church had been, were reconstructed at this time as well to harmonize with the rest of the nave.

== Bells ==
Both west towers contain bells. The south-west tower contains a swinging bourdon bell called Great John. It chimes the hour and it dates from 1901. It weighs over 7 tons and it is over 7 feet in diameter. Despite its name, it is not dedicated to Saint John of Beverley. It reads, &quot;I am called the great bell of Saint John the Evangelist 1901&quot;. Records show that the Minster possessed two bells in 1050. Four bells were installed in 1366, three of which having been recast and are still used in the Minster. The chimes for each quarter are rung on the 10 bells in the north-west tower and the melody was composed by organist John Camidge. There have been two major overhauls of the bells, one in 1896 and the other in 1901 by Taylor of Loughborough.

==Features==


Features of the interior include shafts of Purbeck Marble, stiff-leaf carving and the tomb of Lady Eleanor Percy, dating from around 1340 and covered with a richly decorated canopy, regarded by F. H. Crossley as one of the best surviving examples of Gothic art. A total of 68 16th-century misericords are located in the quire of the minster, and nearby is a sanctuary or frith stool dating back to Anglo-Saxon times.

The misericords were probably carved by the so-called &quot;Ripon school&quot; of carvers and bear a strong family resemblance to those at Manchester Cathedral and Ripon Cathedral.

The church contains one of the few remaining frith stools (also known as frid stools, meaning &quot;peace chairs&quot;) in England. Anyone wanting to claim sanctuary from the law would sit in the chair. The chair dates from Saxon times before 1066.

In the central tower is a massive treadwheel crane which was used to lift building materials to the roof space. It is of medieval origin but has been largely reconstructed.

The organ is mounted above a richly carved wooden screen dating from 1877 to 1880, designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott, and carved by James Elwell of Beverley. There is a staircase in the north aisle which was used in collegiate times to gain access to the chapter house, since demolished.

Improvements to the choir were made during the 16th and 18th centuries, and medieval glass, which was shattered by a storm in 1608, was meticulously collected and installed in the east window in 1725. The Thornton family, great craftsmen of the early 18th century, were responsible for the font cover and the west door, and also for saving the church from being completely ruined by the fall of the north wall of the north transept between 1718 and 1731. Another notable feature is the series of carvings of musicians which adorn the nave, which date to the second quarter of the 14th century.

Location sequences for the film &quot;Lease of Life&quot; (1954), two TV series of &quot;Victoria&quot; in 2016-7 and the BBC dramas &quot;King Charles III&quot; and &quot;Gunpowder&quot; in 2017 were filmed in Beverley Minster.

== In literature==
 is the subject of a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon to a picture by Nathaniel Whittock published in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1836. In a footnote, she remarks &quot;It is said that the two towers on the West Front inspired Westminster Abbey,&quot; the west towers of which are post-medieval structures designed by Nicholas Hawkmoor, mentioned above.

== Organ ==

There is a large, chestnut-coloured organ with bright golden pipes, designed by Arthur Hill in 1916. It houses an original manual from the organ built by John Snetzler in 1769, which has been increased to four manuals since. There have been subsequent rebuilds and restoration by William Hill &amp; Sons in 1884, and by Hill, Norman and Beard in 196263. The specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

<text>Welsh writing in English (Welsh: &quot;Llenyddiaeth Gymreig yn Saesneg&quot;), (previously Anglo-Welsh literature) is a term used to describe works written in the English language by Welsh writers.

The term &#x27;Anglo-Welsh&#x27; replaced an earlier attempt to define this category of writing as &#x27;Anglo-Cymric&#x27;. The form &#x27;Anglo-Welsh&#x27; was used by Idris Bell in 1922 and revived by Raymond Garlick and Roland Mathias when they renamed their literary periodical &quot;Dock Leaves&quot; as &quot;The Anglo-Welsh Review&quot; and later further defined the term in their anthology &quot;Anglo-Welsh Poetry 1480-1980&quot; as denoting a literature in which &quot;the first element of the compound being understood to specify the language and the second the provenance of the writing&quot;.
Although recognised as a distinctive entity only since the 20th century, Garlick and Mathias sought to identify a tradition of writing in English in Wales going back much further. The need for a separate identity for this kind of writing arose because the term &#x27;Welsh Literature&#x27; describes Welsh-language literature which has its own continuous tradition going back to the sixth century poem known as &quot;Y Gododdin&quot;.

==Introduction==
The phrase &quot;Welsh writing in English&quot; has replaced the earlier &quot;Anglo-Welsh literature&quot; because many Welsh writers in English have felt that the latter usage failed to give &quot;Welsh status to Welsh people who, not speaking Cymraeg, nevertheless do not feel at all English&quot;. Welsh writers in English in the early twentieth century favoured poetry and the short story over the novel, with some notable exceptions. This was for two main reasons: in a society lacking sufficient wealth to support professional writers, the amateur writer was able to spare time only for short bursts of creativity and these forms concentrated linguistic delight and exuberance. Since the main market was London publishers, the early short stories tended to focus on the eccentricities – as seen from a metropolitan viewpoint – of Welsh rural life, though later work focused on life in the industrial valleys of South Wales. A genre of poetry also developed which consciously located itself in association with poetry in the Welsh language and this emphasis led some writers to question the term &quot;Anglo-Welsh&quot; and favour the alternative &quot;Welsh Writing in English&quot; as emphasising the Welsh provenance rather than the English language. Recently the more neutral term &quot;Anglophone Writing from Wales&quot; has been employed.

There is no final, clear definition of what constitutes a Welsh writer in English, or Anglo-Welsh author. Obviously it includes Welsh writers whose first language is English, rather than Welsh, such as Swansea born Dylan Thomas (1914–53) and novelist Emyr Humphreys, born in Prestatyn in 1919. But it also includes those born outside Wales with Welsh parentage, who were influenced by their Welsh roots, like London-born poet David Jones (1895–1974). Glyn Jones in &quot;The Dragon Has Two Tongues&quot; defines the Anglo-Welsh as &quot;those Welsh men and women who write in English about Wales&quot;.

In addition, writers born outside Wales, who have both lived in as well as written about Wales, are often included, such as John Cowper Powys (1872–1963), who settled in Wales in 1935 and wrote two major novels, &quot;Owen Glendower&quot; (1941) and &quot;&quot; (1951), that have Welsh subject matter. In addition to using Welsh history and settings, Powys also uses the mythology of &quot;The Mabinogion&quot;. He also studied the Welsh language. Then there is the poet, teacher, and critic Jeremy Hooker (born 1941), who taught at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth from 1965 to 1984 and became deeply involved in writing about and teaching Welsh writing in English during this time, though he wrote only a few poems with Welsh subject matter. The Liverpool-born novelist James Hanley (1897–1985) lived in Wales from 1931 until 1963 and was buried there. Hanley published, &quot;Grey Children: A Study in Humbug and Misery&quot; (1937), a study of unemployment in industrial South Wales and three novels set in Wales. As one writer notes: &quot;a widely debatable area of Anglo-Welsh acceptability exists&quot;. Saunders Lewis, the noted Welsh-language poet, novelist, dramatist, and nationalist, in fact rejected the possibility of Anglo-Welsh literature because English is the official language of the British state, affirming that &#x27;&quot;the literature which people called Anglo-Welsh was indistinguishable from English literature&quot;. Ironically, Saunders Lewis was himself born in Wallasey in England to a Welsh-speaking family.

The problems are perhaps epitomised by Roald Dahl, a writer of short stories and children&#x27;s literature. Dahl was born in Wales, to Norwegian parents, and spent much of his life in England, and the Welsh influence on his work is not always immediately apparent. Thus he might be seen partly as a Welsh analogue to Northern Ireland&#x27;s C.S. Lewis. Peter George is another example of a writer of Welsh origins who rarely wrote about Wales. Conversely, Eric Linklater was born in Penarth, but is generally considered a Scottish writer.

A further challenge for the definition of Welsh literature in English has come with the globalisation of culture. However, modern Welsh literature in English reflects a multicultural experience.

If a Welsh writer chooses to write in English, this does not mean that they are unable to speak Welsh as well. In some cases, such as Jan Morris or Gillian Clarke, English-language writers have chosen to learn Welsh. In others, a native Welsh speaker such as Siân James or Jo Walton may choose to write some, or all of their work in English. Writing for an English-language market does not necessarily mean that they have abandoned a Welsh language audience.

==The beginnings==
While Raymond Garlick discovered sixty-nine Welsh men and women who wrote in English prior to the twentieth century, Dafydd Johnston thinks it &quot;debatable whether such writers belong to a recognisable Anglo-Welsh literature, as opposed to English literature in general&quot;. Well into the nineteenth century English was spoken by relatively few in Wales, and prior to the early twentieth century there are only three major Welsh-born writers who wrote in the English language: George Herbert (1593–1633) from Montgomeryshire, Henry Vaughan (1622–1695) from Brecknockshire, and John Dyer (1699–1757) from Carmarthenshire. While some see them as clearly belonging to the English tradition, Belinda Humphrey believes that both Vaughan and Dyer are Anglo-Welsh poets because, unlike Herbert, they are &quot;rooted creatively in the Welsh countryside of their birth&quot;. Furthermore, she suggests in Vaughan&#x27;s case the possible influence of the tradition of Welsh-language poetry. Writers from medieval Wales such as Geoffrey of Monmouth and Adam of Usk also used Latin and Norman French, in addition to English and Welsh.

Welsh writing in English might be said to begin with the fifteenth-century bard Ieuan ap Hywel Swrdwal (?1430 – ?1480), whose &quot;Hymn to the Virgin&quot; was written at Oxford in England in about 1470 and uses a Welsh poetic form, the &quot;awdl&quot;, and Welsh orthography; for example:

:O mighti ladi, owr leding – tw haf
:::At hefn owr abeiding:
::Yntw ddy ffast eferlasting
::I set a braents ws tw bring.

A rival claim for the first Welsh writer to use English creatively is made for the poet, John Clanvowe (1341–1391). Clanvowe&#x27;s best-known work was &quot;The Book of Cupid, God of Love&quot; or &quot;The Cuckoo and the Nightingale&quot;. which is influenced by Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Parliament of Fowls&quot;. &quot;The Cuckoo and the Nightingale&quot; had previously been attributed to Chaucer but the &quot;Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature&quot; notes the absence of direct evidence of that when linking Clanvowe with the work. The poem is written as a literary dream vision and is an example of medieval debate poetry. A concerto inspired by the poem was composed by Georg Friedrich Handel. It apparently also influenced works by both John Milton and William Wordsworth. Clanvowe also wrote &quot;The Two Ways&quot;, a penitential treatise.

The beginnings of an Anglo-Welsh tradition are found by some in the novels of Allen Raine (Anne Adalisa (Evans) Puddicombe) (1836–1908), from Newcastle Emlyn, Carmarthenshire, whose work, Stephen Thomas Knight proposes, &quot;realised a real, if partial, separate identity and value for a Welsh social culture&quot;. (Other possible precursors are Monmouthshire-born Arthur Machen (1863–1947), and Joseph Keating (1871–1934), who began his working life as a South Wales miner.) However, many see the Carmarthenshire-born satirical short-story writer and novelist Caradoc Evans (1878–1945) as the first—or first modern—Welsh writer in English. His short-story collections &quot;My People&quot; (1915) and &quot;Capel Sion&quot; (1916) were highly controversial, and Roland Mathias bitterly comments that &quot;No other Anglo-Welsh prose writer. .. displayed such ill will to Wales or to Welsh people&quot;. W. H. Davies (1871–1940), born in Newport, became famous principally for his &quot;The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp&quot; which was set mostly in North America. The principal themes in his work are observations about life&#x27;s hardships, the ways in which the human condition is reflected in nature, his own tramping adventures and the various characters he met. In his poetry he was particularly inspired by birds, the weather and the seasons. His prose works were nearly all autobiographical and were sometimes, as with his 1918 &quot;A Poet&#x27;s Pilgrimage (or A Pilgrimage in Wales)&quot;, set in his homeland. (See also Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844–89), Edward Thomas (1878–1917) and Joseph Keating (1871–1934).)

&quot;In Parenthesis&quot;, a modernist epic poem by David Jones (1895–1974) first published in 1937, is probably the best known contribution from Wales to the literature of the First World War.

To a large extent, though not entirely, &quot;The first flowering of Welsh writing in English&quot; was in industrial South Wales and this was linked to the rapid decline in the use of the Welsh language in the twentieth century, especially in this region. David Jones and Dylan Thomas are two writers of the 1930s who do not fit into this paradigm.

===Early drama===

One of the chief impediments to the development of Welsh theatre (in both English and Welsh), throughout much of history, was the lack of major urban centres. With the growth of Swansea and Cardiff, this situation changed, but many churchmen opposed it. The Methodist Convention in 1887 recommended that chapels regard theatrical activity as an immoral practice on a par with gambling. It was not until 1902 when David Lloyd George called for patronage of Welsh drama at the National Eisteddfod that a profile of respectability started to be acquired among devout communities.

The English language classical repertoire was first brought to those who could understand it by travelling troupes such as the Kemble family (Charles Kemble was born at Brecon in 1775). With the advance of the English language, theatre in English developed quickly between 1875 and 1925. By 1912 Wales had 34 theatres and many halls licensed for dramatic performances. However, the arrival of sound cinema in the 1930s led to the closure or transformation of most theatres.

Emlyn Williams (1905–1987) became an overnight star with his thriller &quot;Night Must Fall&quot; (1935), in which he also played the lead role of a psychopathic murderer. The play was noted for its exploration of the killer&#x27;s complex psychological state, a step forward for its genre. It was made into a film in 1937 and has been frequently revived. &quot;The Corn is Green&quot; (1938) was partly based on his own childhood in Wales. He starred as a Welsh schoolboy in the play&#x27;s London premiere. The play came to Broadway in 1940 and was turned into a film. His autobiographical light comedy, &quot;The Druid&#x27;s Rest&quot; was first performed at the St Martin&#x27;s Theatre, London, in 1944. It saw the stage debut of Richard Burton whom Williams had spotted at an audition in Cardiff.

==1930s and wartime: The First Wave==
During the nineteenth century the use of the Welsh language declined generally in Wales, with the development of compulsory education in the English language, but more so in the south because of immigration from England and Ireland as a result of industrialisation. This loss of language was an important factor in the development of Anglo-Welsh writing in South Wales, especially in the mining valleys. While some of these authors came from Welsh-speaking families, they generally tended to associate this language with the repressive religion of Nonconformist chapels.

The Anglo-Welsh writers of the 1930s had to look to London for publication and the possibility of literary success; though gradually, beginning in 1937, Welsh writing in English received encouragement from Welsh-based literary and critical journals, initially &quot;Wales&quot;, published by Keidrych Rhys in three intermittent series between 1937 and 1960. Next came the &quot;Welsh Review&quot;, published by Gwyn Jones, first in 1939 and then between 1944 and 1948. (See also &quot;Life and Letters Today&quot;, which between 1938 and 1950 contained works by and about many Welsh writers in English.)

===Fiction===
An early work of the first wave of Anglo-Welsh writers was &quot;The Withered Root&quot; (1927) by Rhys Davies (1901–78) from the Rhondda Valley. While he probably wrote more fiction about the industrial world of the South Wales Valleys than anyone else, Rhys Davies was in fact a grocer&#x27;s son who was living in London by the time he was twenty. Unlike that of other writers from the mining community, his fiction is more concerned with individuals, in particular women, than with politics. D. H. Lawrence was a major influence on Rhys, though similarities with Caradoc Evans have been noted, and it has been suggested that he had &quot;The tendency to process images of the Welsh valleys for consumption by English audiences&quot;. Another Anglo-Welsh novelist (and playwright) was Jack Jones (1884–1970), a miner&#x27;s son from Merthyr Tydfil who was himself a miner from the age of 12. He was active in the union movement and politics, starting with the Communist Party, but in the course of his life he was involved, to some degree, with all the major British parties. Amongst his novels of working-class life are &quot;Rhondda Roundabout&quot; (1935) and &quot;Bidden to the Feast&quot; (1938). The political development of a young miner is the subject of &quot;Cwmardy&quot; (1937), Lewis Jones&#x27;s (1897–1939) largely autobiographical novel.

Gwyn Thomas (1913–81) was also a coalminer&#x27;s son from the Rhondda, but won a scholarship to Oxford and then became a schoolmaster. He wrote 11 novels as well as short stories, plays, and radio and television scripts, most of which focused on unemployment in the Rhondda Valley in the 1930s. He has been described by Stephen Thomas Knight as &quot;about the most verbally brilliant writer of Welsh fiction in English&quot;. His inaugural novel &quot;Sorrow for Thy Sons&quot; (1937) was rejected by Gollancz and not published until 1986. Thomas&#x27;s first accepted book was a collection of short stories, &quot;Where Did I Put My Pity: Folk-Tales From the Modern Welsh&quot;, which appeared in 1946. He was also known for his negative attitude to the Welsh language, and Glyn Jones sees him as falling &quot;short of being a completely representative figure ... in his attitude to Wales and Welshness,&quot; as Gwyn Thomas &quot;appears in his writing to have little sympathy with the national aspirations and indigenous culture of our country&quot;. Another writer who escaped from his proletarian background was Gwyn Jones (1907–1999). He wrote about this world in novels and short stories, including &quot;Times Like These&quot; (1936) which explores the life of a working-class family during the 1926 miners&#x27; strike. Jones founded &quot;The Welsh Review&quot; in 1939, which he edited until 1948; this journal was important for raising discussion of Welsh issues. What is probably the most famous novel about Wales, Richard Llewellyn&#x27;s &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot;, was published in 1939. It is described by Glyn Jones in &quot;The Dragon Has Two Tongues&quot; as a &quot;staggering and accomplished piece of literary hokum&quot; (p. 51), &quot;a book [that Jones finds] impossible to take seriously, though much of it [he] read with absorption&quot; (p. 53). (See also Margiad Evans [Peggy Eileen Whistler] (1909–58); Richard Hughes (1900–76); Alexander Cordell (1914–97).)

===Poetry===
The mining valleys produced a significant working-class poet in Idris Davies (1905–53), who worked as a coal miner before qualifying as a teacher. He initially wrote in Welsh &quot;but rebellion against chapel religion&quot;, along with the &quot;inspirational influence of English&quot; poets, led him to write in English. &quot;Gwalia Deserta&quot; (1938) is about the Great Depression, while the subject of &quot;The Angry Summer&quot; (1943) is the 1926 miners&#x27; strike.

There are a number of other authors who published before the Second World War but who did not come from the South Wales valleys.

Amongst these was Swansea suburbanite Dylan Thomas (1914–53), whose first collection, &quot;18 Poems&quot;, was published in 1934. Then there is Geraint Goodwin (1903–41) from Newtown in mid-Wales, who, in such works as the novel &quot;The Heyday in the Blood&quot; (1936), wrote about declining rural communities in the border region. David Jones (1895–1974), whose father was from North Wales, was born in a London suburb. His epic poem &quot;In Parenthesis&quot;, which deals with his World War I experiences, was published in 1937. Another Swansea poet Vernon Watkins (1906–67) likewise does not belong with the main group of writers of the so-called First Wave from the South Wales mining communities. Roland Mathias suggests that &quot;his use of Welsh tradition was highly selective – only the ancient custom of the Mari Lwyd and the legend of Taliesin&quot;. Alun Lewis (1915–44), from Cwmaman near Aberdare, published both poetry and short fiction and might well have been a major figure in the decades after the war but for his early death.

== After 1945 ==
The careers of some 1930s writers continued after World War Two, including those of Gwyn Thomas, Vernon Watkins, and Dylan Thomas, whose most famous work &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; was first broadcast in 1954. The critic, novelist, and poet Glyn Jones&#x27;s (1905–1995) career also began in the 1930s, but he belongs more to the later era, and one of his most important works, the novel &quot;The Island of Apples&quot;, was published in 1965. His first language had been Welsh but he chose to write in English. James A. Davies describes him as &quot;a considerable talent in need of the great editor he never managed to find&quot;.

===Poetry===
David Jones also first published in the late 1930s, yet he belongs more to the post-war era. Tony Conran in 2003 suggested that it was not until the late sixties, &quot;with the &#x27;fragments&#x27; that were to be collected in &quot;The Sleeping Lord&quot; (1974), that his work began to enter our bloodstream and be seen as a significant part of the Anglo-Welsh renaissance&quot;.

The attitude of the post-war generation of Welsh writers in English towards Wales differs from the previous generation, in that they were more sympathetic to Welsh nationalism and to the Welsh language. The change can be linked to the nationalist fervour generated by Saunders Lewis and the burning of the Bombing School on the Lleyn Peninsula in 1936, along with a sense of crisis generated by World War II. In poetry R. S. Thomas (1913–2000) was the most important figure throughout the second half of the twentieth century, beginning with &quot;The Stones of the Field&quot; in 1946 and concluding with &quot;No Truce with the Furies&quot; (1995). While he &quot;did not learn the Welsh language until he was 30 and wrote all his poems in English&quot;, he wanted the Welsh language to be made the first language of Wales, and the official policy of bilingualism abolished. He wrote his autobiography in Welsh, but said he lacked the necessary grasp of the language to employ it in his poems. Although an Anglican priest, he was a fervent nationalist and advocated non-violent action against English owners of holiday homes in Wales. As an admirer of Saunders Lewis, Thomas defended his need to use English: &quot;Since there is in Wales a mother tongue that continues to flourish, a proper Welshman can only look on English as a means of rekindling interest in the Welsh language, and of leading people back to the mother tongue.&quot;
===Fiction===
In the field of fiction the major figure in the second half of the twentieth century was Emyr Humphreys (1919). Humphreys&#x27; first novel &quot;The Little Kingdom&quot; was published in 1946; and during his long writing career he has published over twenty novels. These include &quot;A Toy Epic&quot; (1958), &quot;Outside the House of Baal&quot; (1965), and a sequence of seven novels, &quot;The Land of the Living&quot;, which surveys the political and cultural history of twentieth-century Wales. With regard to the fact that he wrote in English, Humphreys refers to &quot;using the language of cultural supremacy to try to express something that comes directly from the suppressed native culture&quot; of Wales. His most recent work is the collection of short stories, &quot;The Woman in the Window&quot; (2009).

Bill Hopkins (1928–2011) was aligned with the existentialist wing of the &quot;angry young men&quot; movement. His only novel, &quot;The Divine and the Decay&quot; (1957), created a scandal with its Nietzschean themes, and the reactions made him abandon what would have been his second novel.

At a local level Fred Hando (1888–1970) chronicled and illustrated the history, character and folklore of Monmouthshire (which he also called Gwent), in a series of over 800 articles and several books published between the 1920s and 1960s.

===Drama===
&quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; is a 1954 radio drama by Dylan Thomas, adapted later as a stage play. The play had its first reading on stage on 14 May 1953, in New York, at The Poetry Center at 92nd Street Y.

==1960s and after==
While the second half of the twentieth century saw the serious decline of Welsh heavy industry, along with serious unemployment and the hardship and suffering that came with it, it also saw significant cultural gains with regard to a separate Welsh identity within the British Isles, starting with the appointing of a Secretary of State for Wales in 1964, and the establishment of a Welsh Office in Cardiff the following year. With these developments came an Arts Council for Wales. For the Welsh-speaking minority there was the Welsh Language Act of 1967, and – from the 1970s – the establishment of more schools using Welsh as their primary means of instruction (see education in Wales). A Welsh-language TV channel was set up in 1982. The culmination of this trend was the creation of a National Assembly for Wales in 1999. The defeat of the first Welsh devolution referendum in 1979 had been a grave disappointment to Welsh nationalists.

The expansion in the publication of Anglo-Welsh writers in Wales in journal and book form was important for the further development of Welsh writing in English. This included &quot;The Welsh Review&quot; (1939–1948), and &quot;Dock Leaves&quot; which later became &quot;The Anglo-Welsh Review&quot; (1949–1987) and continues (from 1988) as the &quot;New Welsh Review&quot;. In 1967 another important Anglo-Welsh journal, &quot;Poetry Wales&quot;, was founded by Meic Stephens, assisted by Harri Webb. Shortly thereafter, in 1970, &quot;Planet&quot; was launched by Ned Thomas and subsequently edited by the poet and essayist John Barnie. In the early 1990s came the yearly &quot;Welsh Writing in English: A Yearbook of Critical Essays&quot; edited by M. Wynn Thomas &amp; Tony Brown.

Amongst book publishers, the University of Wales Press, founded in 1922, has been influential. Poetry Wales became involved with publishing, firstly as Poetry Wales Press, and then, since 1985, as Seren Books. Y Lolfa, founded in the 1960s as a Welsh-language publishing house, later began producing English-language books on subjects of Welsh interest. Gomer Press, based in Llandysul, Carmarthenshire, is another supporter of Welsh writing in English. It was established in 1892 and claims to be &#x27;&quot;the largest publishing house in Wales&quot;. A more recent addition to Welsh publishing in English is Honno Press, which specialises in women writers.

===Fiction===

The problems of post-industrial South Wales of the 1960s and 1970s is the subject for novelists such as Alun Richards (1929–2004) and Ron Berry (1920–97). Both use humour in their bitter description of the spiritual decay of the South Wales Valleys, where the heavy industries of iron and steel and coal have disappeared, to be replaced by high-technology industrial parks. Similar themes are expressed in the novels of a younger generation, as in Christopher Meredith&#x27;s (born 1954) &quot;Shifts&quot; (1988), which deals with the closing of a steel mill, and Duncan Bush&#x27;s (born 1946) grim portrait of urban isolation &quot;Glass Shot&quot; (1991). The body of Meredith&#x27;s fiction, as well as his poetry, ranges much more widely, including historical fiction and bleak comedy.

Another important novelist of the post-Second-World-War era was Raymond Williams (1921–88). Born near Abergavenny, Williams continued the earlier tradition of writing from a left-wing perspective on the Welsh industrial scene in his trilogy &quot;Border Country&quot; (1960), &quot;Second Generation&quot; (1964), and &quot;The Fight for Manod&quot; (1979). He also enjoyed a reputation as a cultural historian. He was an influential figure within the New Left and in wider circles. His writings on politics, the mass media, and literature are a significant contribution to the Marxist critique of culture and the arts. His work laid the foundations for the field of cultural studies and the cultural materialist approach.

The subject matter of the Cardiff-born Booker Prize-winner Bernice Rubens (1928–2004) is quite different. She was a member of Cardiff&#x27;s small Jewish community; and associated themes were a central concern of much of her writing, including &quot;Brothers&quot; (1983), where parallels with her own ancestry are obvious: it follows four generations of a family which flees Russia for South Wales. As only a couple of her 25 novels have a Welsh setting she does not fit the narrower definitions of Welsh writing in English.

===Poetry===
While the Welsh writing in English scene tended to be dominated by fiction in the 1930s, in the latter part of the twentieth century poetry flourished. A landmark event was the 1967 publication of Bryn Griffith&#x27;s anthology &quot;Welsh Voices&quot;, which, in Tony Conran&#x27;s words, was &quot;the most lively and exciting selection of contemporary Anglo-Welsh poetry ever to have appeared&quot;.
Tony Conran (born 1931) is an important figure in this so-called second flowering as critic, poet, and translator of Welsh poetry. His &quot;Penguin Book of Welsh Verse&quot; (1967) has been especially helpful in bridging the gap between the Welsh and English speaking. In his own poetry he makes use of Welsh tradition: for example, his elegy for Welsh soldiers killed in the Falklands War is modelled on Aneirin&#x27;s &quot;Y Gododdin&quot;. Swansea poet Harri Webb&#x27;s (1920–1994) verse, including &quot;The Green Desert&quot; (1969), is marked in its themes by a radical and uncompromising commitment to Welsh nationalist politics. Another important poet of the late twentieth century is Tony Curtis (born 1946) from Carmarthen: he is the author of several collections, most recently &quot;War Voices&quot; (1995), &quot;The Arches&quot; (1998), and &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; (2001). John Tripp (1927–86), a convinced Welsh nationalist, was ironically aware of the fact that, while born in Wales, he had worked outside the Principality until his early forties.
Robert Minhinnick, born in 1952, is a notable writer from the second half of the twentieth century. He has been the winner of a Society of Authors Eric Gregory Award, and has twice won the Forward Prize for best individual poem, while his collections of essays have twice won the Wales Book of the Year Award. Minhinnick edited &quot;Poetry Wales&quot; magazine from 1997 to 2008. His first novel, &quot;Sea Holly&quot; (2007) was shortlisted for the 2008 Royal Society of Literature&#x27;s Ondaatje Prize.

Welsh writing in English tended from the beginning to be dominated by men, but the period after World War II produced some distinguished Welsh women poets, including Ruth Bidgood (born 1922), Gillian Clarke (born 1937), and Sheenagh Pugh (born 1950). Pugh was born in Birmingham, but lived for many years in Cardiff and taught creative writing at the University of Glamorgan until retiring in 2008. Her collection &quot;Stonelight&quot; (1999) won the Wales Book of the Year Award in 2000. She has twice won the Cardiff International Poetry Competition. She has also published novels. She now lives in Shetland.

Although Ruth Bidgood was born near Neath in 1922, her first collection &quot;The Given Time&quot; appeared only in 1972. Gillian Clarke is a poet, playwright, editor, broadcaster, lecturer and translator from Welsh. She was born in Cardiff and raised there, in Penarth, and in Pembrokeshire. Both her parents were native Welsh speakers, yet she was brought up speaking English and learnt Welsh only as an adult. In the mid-1980s she moved to rural Ceredigion, West Wales. She became the third National Poet for Wales in 2008.

Amongst other poets of the second half of the twentieth century, the names of Roland Mathias (1915–2007), Leslie Norris (1921–2006), John Ormond (1923–1990), Dannie Abse (born 1923), Raymond Garlick (born 1926), Peter Finch (born 1947), Tony Curtis (b. 1946), Nigel Jenkins (b. 1949), Mike Jenkins (b. 1953), Paul Henry (b. 1959), Christopher Meredith and Paul Groves (born 1947) have a significant place. With regard to the current situation of Welsh poetry in English, Ian Gregson suggests that &quot;much of the most exciting poetry in Britain is being written in Wales&quot;. He singles out Oliver Reynolds (born 1957), Gwyneth Lewis (born 1959) – who also write in Welsh – and Stephen Knight (born 1960) as having fulfilled &quot;their early promise&quot;.

==21st Century==
=== Fiction ===
Amongst more recent Welsh writers in English, Niall Griffiths is notable for his novels &quot;Grits&quot; (2000) and &quot;Sheepshagger&quot; (2001), which portray a grittier side to Welsh literature; and Malcolm Pryce who has writing a number of humorous send ups of &quot;noir&quot; such as &quot;Aberystwyth Mon Amour&quot; (2001). Both of these writers were born in England, but have Welsh roots and are now Welsh based, and write much on Welsh subject matter. Nikita Lalwani, is originally from Rajasthan in India, but was raised in Wales, and her novel &quot;Gifted&quot; (2007) was nominated for the Man Booker Prize. Trezza Azzopardi&#x27;s debut novel &quot;The Hiding Place&quot; (2000) was also nominated for the Booker Prize, and the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize, winning the latter. It is the story of the Maltese community in Cardiff. Jan Morris is better known as a non-fiction writer, but she has written some fiction too; her novel &quot;Hav&quot; won the 2007 Arthur C. Clarke Award. Brian John came to creative writing late, after a career in university teaching and academic research. His eight-novel Angel Mountain Saga, set in north Pembrokeshire in the Regency and early Victorian period, is effectively a portrayal of &quot;Mother Wales&quot; in the persona of the heroine Martha Morgan. He has also written four volumes of Pembrokeshire folk tales, and two other novels. One of these, written for children, won the Wishing Shelf Award in 2012. John Evans is one of Wales&#x27; most uncompromising writers, a former punk rocker, poet, filmmaker and novelist he has also campaigned against the Badger cull alongside Brian May and other celebrities.

===Poetry===
Current Welsh poets have been surveyed in the University of Aberystwyth project, &quot;Devolved Voices&quot;. This was a three-year research project starting in September 2012 that investigated the state of Welsh poetry in English since the 1997 Welsh devolution referendum. Poets included were: Tiffany Atkinson, Zoe Brigley, Sarah Corbett, Damian Walford Davies, Nia Davies, Jasmine Donahaye, Joe Dunthorne, Jonathan Edwards, Rhian Edwards, Kristian Evans, Matthew Francis, Dai George, Ian Gregson, Philip Gross, Emily Hinshelwood, Meirion Jordan, Anna Lewis, Gwyneth Lewis, Patrick McGuiness, Andrew McNeillie, Kate North, Pascale Petit, clare e. potter, Deryn Rees-Jones, Fiona Sampson, Zoe Skoulding, Katherine Stansfield, Richard Marggraff Turley, Anna Wigley, and Samantha Wynn-Rhydderch.

Poet Mab Jones, the founder and editor of Black Rabbit Press, has won a number of awards, including the John Tripp Spoken Poetry Audience Prize, the Aurora Poetry Award, the Geoff Stevens Memorial Poetry Prize, and the Rabbit Heart Poetry Film Festival Grand Jury Prize. She also received a Creative Wales Award. She has presented two radio programs for the BBC which featured Welsh poetry from the past to the present.

Contemporary poets also include Rhian Edwards, Meirion Jordan (born 1985), Nerys Williams, and Jonathan Edwards (born 1979). Rhian Edwards&#x27; debut collection &quot;Clueless Dogs&quot; was named the Wales Book of the Year in 2013. Jonathan Edwards&#x27; debut collection &quot;My Family and Other Superheroes&quot; won the Costa Book Award for Poetry in 2014. Meirion Jordan, who was born in Swansea, Wales, won the Newdigate Prize in 2007 and Seren has published two collections by him. Nerys Williams is originally from Pen-Y-Bont, Carmarthen in West Wales, and her collection of poetry &quot;Sound Archive&quot; (2011) was published by Seren and &quot;Cabaret&quot; by New Dublin Press in 2017. Williams, a native Welsh speaker, was a recipient of a Fulbright Scholar&#x27;s Award at University of California at Berkeley, and is a recent winner of the Ted McNulty Poetry Prize from Poetry Ireland.

===Drama===
The National Theatre Wales, was founded in 2009, several years after Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru its Welsh language equivalent. As well as non-Welsh productions, it aims to produce original English language works by Welsh playwrights.

<text>Robert Seymour Bridges (23 October 1844 – 21 April 1930) was a British poet who was Poet Laureate from 1913 to 1930. A doctor by training, he achieved literary fame only late in life. His poems reflect a deep Christian faith, and he is the author of many well-known hymns. It was through Bridges&#x27;s efforts that the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins achieved posthumous fame.

==Personal and professional life==
Bridges was born at Walmer, Kent, in England, the son of John Thomas Bridges (died 1853) and his wife Harriett Elizabeth, daughter of the Rev. Sir Robert Affleck, 4th Baronet. He was the fourth son and eighth child. After his father&#x27;s death his mother married again, in 1854, to John Edward Nassau Molesworth, vicar of Rochdale, and the family moved there.

Bridges was educated at Eton College and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He went on to study medicine in London at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, intending to practise until the age of forty and then retire to write poetry. He practised as a casualty physician at his teaching hospital (where he made a series of highly critical remarks about the Victorian medical establishment) and subsequently as a full physician to the Great Northern Central Hospital (1876–85)(later the Royal Northern Hospital). He was also a physician to the Hospital for Sick Children.

Lung disease forced Bridges to retire from his post as physician in 1885, and from that point on he devoted himself to writing and literary research. However, Bridges&#x27;s literary work started long before his retirement, his first collection of poems having been published in 1873. In 1884 he married Mary Monica Waterhouse, daughter of the architect Alfred Waterhouse R.A., and spent the rest of his life in rural seclusion, first at the Manor House Yattendon in Berkshire, then (from 1905) on the Boars Hill ridge above Oxford, where he died.

He was elected to the Fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1900. He was appointed Poet Laureate in 1913, the only medical graduate to have held the office.

He was the father of poet Elizabeth Daryush and of the cabinet secretary Edward Bridges.
==Literary work==
As a poet Bridges stands rather apart from the current of modern English verse, but his work has had great influence in a select circle, by its restraint, purity, precision and delicacy yet strength of expression. It embodies a distinct theory of prosody. Bridges&#x27;s faith underpinned much of his work.

In the book &quot;Milton&#x27;s Prosody&quot;, he took an empirical approach to examining Milton&#x27;s use of blank verse, and developed the controversial theory that Milton&#x27;s practice was essentially syllabic. He considered free verse to be too limiting, and explained his position in the essay &quot;Humdrum and Harum-Scarum&quot;. His own efforts to &quot;free&quot; verse resulted in the poems he called &quot;Neo-Miltonic Syllabics&quot;, which were collected in &quot;New Verse&quot; (1925). The metre of these poems was based on syllables rather than accents, and he used the principle again in the long philosophical poem &quot;The Testament of Beauty&quot; (1929), for which he was appointed to the Order of Merit in that year. His best-known poems, however, are to be found in the two earlier volumes of &quot;Shorter Poems&quot; (1890, 1894). He also wrote verse plays, with limited success, and literary criticism, including a study of the work of John Keats.

Bridges&#x27;s poetry was privately printed in the first instance, and was slow in making its way beyond a comparatively small circle of his admirers. His best work is to be found in his &quot;Shorter Poems&quot; (1890), and a complete edition (to date) of his &quot;Poetical Works&quot; (6 vols.) was published in 1898–1905.

Despite being made poet laureate in 1913, Bridges was never a very well-known poet and only achieved his great popularity shortly before his death with &quot;The Testament of Beauty&quot;. However, his verse evoked response in many great British composers of the time. Among those to set his poems to music were Hubert Parry, Gustav Holst and later Gerald Finzi.

During the First World War, Bridges joined the group of writers assembled by Charles Masterman as part of Britain&#x27;s War Propaganda Bureau at Wellington House.

At Oxford, Bridges befriended Gerard Manley Hopkins, who is now considered a superior poet but who owes his present fame to Bridges&#x27;s efforts in arranging the posthumous publication (1918) of his verse.

Bridges received advice from the young phonetician David Abercrombie on the reformed spelling system he was devising for the publication of his collected essays (later published in seven volumes by Oxford University Press, with the help of the distinguished typographer Stanley Morison, who designed the new letters). Thus Robert Bridges contributed to phonetics and he was also a founder member of the Society for Pure English.

===Hymnody===
Bridges made an important contribution to hymnody with the publication in 1899 of his &quot;Yattendon Hymnal&quot;, which he created specifically for musical reasons. This collection of hymns, although not a financial success, became a bridge between the Victorian hymnody of the last half of the 19th century and the modern hymnody of the early 20th century.
Bridges wrote and also translated historic hymns, and many of these were included in &quot;Songs of Syon&quot; (1904) and the later &quot;English Hymnal&quot; (1906). Several of Bridges&#x27;s hymns and translations are still in use today:

*&quot;Ah, holy Jesu, how hast thou offended&quot; (&quot;Herzliebster Jesu&quot;, Johann Heermann, 1630)
*&quot;All my hope on God is founded&quot; (Joachim Neander, c. 1680)
*&quot;Happy are they, they that love God&quot;
*&quot;Jesu, joy of man&#x27;s desiring&quot; (Martin Jahn, 1661)
*&quot;Love of the Father, Love of God the Son&quot; (&quot;Amor Patris et Filii&quot;, 12th century)
*&quot;O gladsome light, O grace&quot; (Phos Hilaron)
*&quot;O sacred head, sore wounded&quot; (&quot;O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden&quot;, Paul Gerhardt, 1656)
*&quot;O splendour of God&#x27;s glory bright&quot; (Ambrose, 4th century)
*&quot;Rejoice, O land, in God thy might&quot;
**The Baptist Hymn Book, University Press, Oxford 1962
*&quot;The duteous day now closeth&quot; (&quot;Nun ruhen alle Wälder&quot;, Paul Gerhardt, 1647)
*&quot;Thee will I love, my God and King&quot;
*&quot;When morning gilds the skies&quot; (stanza 3; Katholisches Gesangbuch, 1744)

== Phonetic alphabet ==

Robert Bridges developed his own phonetic alphabet for English, with the help of the phonetician David Abercrombie. Bridges, and later his wife, published some volumes of his &quot;Collected Essays, Papers, &amp;tc.&quot; in the alphabet, with characters by Stanley Morison of the Monotype Corporation.

<text>Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry, 1st Baronet (27 February 1848 – 7 October 1918), was an English composer, teacher and historian of music. Born in Richmond Hill, Bournemouth, Parry&#x27;s first major works appeared in 1880. As a composer he is best known for the choral song &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, his 1902 setting for the coronation anthem &quot;I was glad&quot;, the choral and orchestral ode &quot;Blest Pair of Sirens&quot;, and the hymn tune &quot;Repton&quot;, which sets the words &quot;Dear Lord and Father of Mankind&quot;. His orchestral works include five symphonies and a set of Symphonic Variations. He also composed the music for &quot;Ode to Newfoundland&quot;, the Newfoundland and Labrador provincial anthem (and former national anthem).

After early attempts to work in insurance at his father&#x27;s behest, Parry was taken up by George Grove, first as a contributor to Grove&#x27;s massive &quot;Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; in the 1870s and &#x27;80s, and then in 1883 as professor of composition and musical history at the Royal College of Music, of which Grove was the first head. In 1895 Parry succeeded Grove as head of the college, remaining in the post for the rest of his life. He was concurrently Heather Professor of Music at the University of Oxford from 1900 to 1908. He wrote several books about music and music history, the best-known of which is probably his 1909 study of Johann Sebastian Bach.

Both in his lifetime and afterwards, Parry&#x27;s reputation and critical standing have varied. His academic duties were considerable and prevented him from devoting all his energies to composition, but some contemporaries such as Charles Villiers Stanford rated him as the finest English composer since Henry Purcell; others, such as Frederick Delius, did not. Parry&#x27;s influence on later composers, by contrast, is widely recognised. Edward Elgar learned much of his craft from Parry&#x27;s articles in Grove&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot;, and among those who studied under Parry at the Royal College were Ralph Vaughan Williams, Gustav Holst, Frank Bridge and John Ireland.

He was also an enthusiastic cruising sailor and owned successively the yawl &quot;The Latois&quot; and the ketch &quot;The Wanderer&quot;. In 1908 he was elected as a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron, the only composer so honoured.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Hubert Parry was born in Richmond Hill, Bournemouth, the youngest of the six children of Thomas Gambier Parry (1816–1888) and his first wife, Isabella &quot;née&quot; Fynes-Clinton (1816–1848), of Highnam Court, Gloucestershire. Gambier Parry, the son of Richard and Mary Parry, had been orphaned at the age of five and brought up by his maternal family, adopting their name, Gambier, as part of his surname. Having inherited enormous wealth from his grandfather, Thomas Parry (a director of the East India Company who died in 1816), Gambier Parry was able to buy a country seat at Highnam Court, a seventeenth-century house near the River Severn and two miles west from Gloucester.

Gambier Parry was an eminent collector of works of early Italian art at a time well before it was fashionable or widely known, and was also a painter and designer of some talent; he invented &quot;spirit fresco&quot;, a process of mural painting appropriate for the damp English climate, which he used in his private chapel at Highnam as well as in Ely Cathedral. Besides his love of painting, Gambier Parry was himself musical, having studied piano and French horn as well as composition during his education at Eton. However, his advanced taste in the visual arts – he was a friend of John Ruskin and an admirer of Turner – did not transfer to his musical interests, which were highly conventional: Mendelssohn and Spohr were the limit of his appreciation for modern music. Nonetheless, he staunchly supported the Three Choirs Festival, both financially and against the threat of their closure between 1874 and 1875 by the puritanical Dean of Worcester.

Three of Gambier Parry&#x27;s children died in infancy, and Isabella Parry died of consumption, aged 32, twelve days after the birth of Hubert. She was buried in the churchyard of St Peter&#x27;s Church, Bournemouth, where Hubert was baptised two days later. He grew up at Highnam with his surviving siblings, (Charles) Clinton (1840–1883) and Lucy (1841–1861). Gambier Parry remarried in 1851, and had a further six children. Isabella&#x27;s untimely death almost certainly affected her children, most obviously the eldest surviving son, Clinton, who was only seven when she died, and, more subtly, Hubert: according to his daughter Dorothea (1876–1963), his stepmother Ethelinda&#x27;s &quot;love for the young ones&quot;, meaning her own children, gave her little or no time for her stepchildren. Gambier Parry was often absent from home, being either away in London or on the Continent. Hubert&#x27;s early childhood, with Clinton away at school and Lucy seven years his senior, was largely solitary, his only regular companion being a governess.

Clinton learned to play cello and piano, and his considerable musical talent became evident ahead of Hubert&#x27;s. Yet despite their father&#x27;s active interest in music, such activity was seen as a pastime, and was frowned upon as a career as being too uncertain and, unlike painting, a less than professional pursuit unseemly for a gentleman.

From January 1856 to the middle of 1858, Hubert attended a preparatory school in Malvern, from where he moved to Twyford Preparatory School in Hampshire. At Twyford, his interest in music was encouraged by the headmaster, and by two organists, S. S. Wesley at Winchester Cathedral, and Edward Brind, at Highnam church. From Wesley he gained an enduring love of Bach&#x27;s music, which according to &quot;The Times&quot; &quot;ultimately found expression in his most important literary work, &quot;Johann Sebastian Bach, the Story of the Development of a Great Composer&quot; (1909)&quot;.

Brind gave Parry piano and basic harmony lessons, and took him to the Three Choirs Festival in Hereford in 1861. Among the choral works performed at that festival were Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Elijah&quot;, Mozart&#x27;s Requiem, and Handel&#x27;s &quot;Samson&quot; and &quot;Messiah&quot;. Orchestral works included Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Pastoral&quot; and Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Italian&quot; symphonies. The experience left a great impression on Parry, and effectively marked the beginning of his lifelong association with the festival.

===Eton and the youngest Bachelor of Music===
Just as Parry left Twyford for Eton College in 1861, home life was clouded by Clinton&#x27;s disgrace: after a promising start at Oxford, studying history and music, Clinton had been sent down for womanising, drinking and indulging in opium. During Parry&#x27;s first term at Eton, further news came that his sister, Lucy, had died of consumption on 16 November. That Parry was deeply affected by this is evident in his 1864 diary where he confessed a profound sense of loss. Nonetheless, Parry threw himself into life at Eton with characteristic energy, and distinguished himself at sport as well as music, despite early signs of the heart trouble that was to dog him for the rest of his life. Meanwhile, Clinton, despite the intervention of his father to secure his return to Oxford, was sent down a further two times, the last irrevocably for not working; in 1863 Clinton left for Paris under a cloud. Though Parry never mentioned being under family pressure, his biographer, Jeremy Dibble, speculates that since &quot;his interest in music had grown to such a point where it could no longer be ignored or thrown away ... the knowledge of his father’s opposition to a musical career, and having seen how such a denial had contributed to the rebellious nature of his brother&#x27;s character, the burden of expectation must have seemed enormous.&quot;

Eton was not at that time noted for its music, despite the interest of a number of its pupils. As there was no one at the school competent enough to advance Parry&#x27;s studies in composition, he turned to George Elvey, the organist of St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, and began studies with him sometime in 1863. Elvey was musically conservative, preferring Handel to Mendelssohn, and though Parry initially idolised his teacher, he eventually realised how unadventurous he was compared to S. S. Wesley. Parry nonetheless benefited from Elvey&#x27;s tuition and gained the advantage of being able to write anthems for the choir of St George&#x27;s Chapel, which under Elvey&#x27;s direction had reached a standard exceptional in English choral singing of that time. Elvey started his pupil on the contrapuntal disciplines of canon and fugue; recognising his pupil&#x27;s talent, he soon became ambitious to train him to a standard sufficient to earn the music degree at Oxford. He therefore introduced his student to the string quartets of Haydn and Mozart, and ultimately to some of the rudiments of orchestration. Meanwhile, Parry, on his own initiative, explored the orchestral scores of Beethoven, Weber, and his beloved Mendelssohn. While still at Eton, Parry successfully sat the Oxford Bachelor of Music examination, the youngest person who had ever done so. His examination exercise, a cantata, &quot;O Lord, Thou hast cast us out&quot;, &quot;astonished&quot; the Heather Professor of Music, Sir Frederick Ouseley, and was triumphantly performed and published in 1867.

In 1867 Parry left Eton and went up to Exeter College, Oxford. He did not study music, being intended by his father for a commercial career, and instead read Law and Modern History. His musical concerns took second place during his time at Oxford, though during one summer holiday, acting on the advice of Wesley, he went to Stuttgart and studied with Henry Hugh Pierson. As Parry recalled, Pierson&#x27;s prime aim appeared to be &quot;to disabuse me of Bach and Mendelssohn&quot;, and he set Parry the task of re-orchestrating works by Weber, Rossini and Beethoven, as well as some of Parry&#x27;s own works. Parry came back to England much more critical of Mendelssohn&#x27;s music, and discovered more adventurous repertoire through attending concerts at London&#x27;s Crystal Palace: he was particularly taken by Schumann&#x27;s Second Symphony, with its &quot;wildly glorious&quot; Scherzo and the slow movement&#x27;s &quot;delicious&quot; orchestration and &quot;most wonderful ... modulation&quot;. He went into raptures about Beethoven&#x27;s Sixth and Eighth symphonies, confessing in his diary: &quot;I can hardly bear to hear or smell a large work by Mendelssohn in the same week as a great work of dear old Beet.&quot; Yet, as Dibble notes, Mendelssohn&#x27;s influence on Parry&#x27;s own music persisted.

===Double harness===
After leaving Exeter College, Oxford. Parry was an underwriter at Lloyd&#x27;s of London from 1870 to 1877. He found the work uncongenial and wholly contrary to his talents and inclinations, but felt obliged to persevere with it, to satisfy not only his father, but his prospective parents-in-law. In 1872 he married Elizabeth Maude Herbert (1851–1933), second daughter of the politician Sidney Herbert and his wife Elizabeth. His in-laws agreed with his father in preferring a conventional career for him, although Parry proved as unsuccessful in insurance as he was successful in music. He and his wife had two daughters, Dorothea and Gwendolen, named after George Eliot characters.
Parry continued his musical studies alongside his work in insurance. In London he took lessons from William Sterndale Bennett, but finding them insufficiently demanding he sought lessons from Johannes Brahms. Brahms was not available, and Parry was recommended to the pianist Edward Dannreuther, &quot;wisest and most sympathetic of teachers&quot;. Dannreuther started by giving Parry piano lessons, but soon extended their studies to analysis and composition. At this stage in his musical development, Parry moved away from the classical traditions inspired by Mendelssohn. Dannreuther introduced him to the music of Wagner, which influenced his compositions of these years.

At the same time as his compositions were coming to public notice, Parry was taken up as a musical scholar by George Grove, first as his assistant editor for his new &quot;Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, to which post Parry was appointed in 1875 and contributed 123 articles. Among those who benefited from these writings was the young Edward Elgar; he did not attend a music college and, as he said in later life, had been most helped by Parry&#x27;s articles. In 1883, Grove, as the first director of the new Royal College of Music, appointed him as the college&#x27;s professor of composition and musical history.
Parry&#x27;s first major works appeared in 1880: a piano concerto, which Dannreuther premiered, and a choral setting of scenes from Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot;. The first performance of the latter has been held to mark the start of a &quot;renaissance&quot; in English music, but was regarded by many critics as too avant garde. Parry scored a greater contemporary success with the ode &quot;Blest Pair of Sirens&quot; (1887), commissioned by and dedicated to Charles Villiers Stanford, one of the first British musicians to recognise Parry&#x27;s talent. Stanford described Parry as the greatest English composer since Purcell. &quot;Blest Pair of Sirens&quot;, a setting of Milton&#x27;s &quot;At a Solemn Musick&quot;, suggested as a text by Grove, established Parry as the leading English choral composer of his day; this had the drawback of bringing him a series of commissions for conventional oratorios, a genre with which he was not in sympathy.

===Peak years===
Now well established as a composer and scholar, Parry received many commissions. Among them were choral works such as the cantata &quot;Ode on Saint Cecilia&#x27;s Day&quot; (1889), the oratorios &quot;Judith&quot; (1888) and &quot;Job&quot; (1892), the psalm-setting &quot;De Profundis&quot; (1891) and a lighter work, &quot;The Pied Piper of Hamelin&quot; (1905), described later as &quot;a bubbling well of humour.&quot; The biblical oratorios were well received by the public, but Parry&#x27;s lack of sympathy with the form was mocked by Bernard Shaw, then writing musical criticism in London. He denounced &quot;Job&quot; as &quot;the most utter failure ever achieved by a thoroughly respectworthy musician. There is not one bar in it that comes within fifty thousand miles of the tamest line in the poem.&quot; Parry, along with Stanford and Alexander Mackenzie, was regarded by some as joint leader of the &quot;English Musical Renaissance&quot;; Shaw considered them a mutual admiration society, purveying &quot;sham classics&quot;; reviewing &quot;Eden&quot; by Stanford in 1891 he wrote
Contemporary critics generally regarded Parry&#x27;s orchestral music as of secondary importance in his output, but in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries many of Parry&#x27;s orchestral pieces have been revived. These include five symphonies, a set of Symphonic Variations in E minor, the &quot;Overture to an Unwritten Tragedy&quot; (1893) and the &quot;Elegy for Brahms&quot; (1897). In 1883 Parry wrote music to accompany the Cambridge Greek Play &quot;The Birds&quot; by Aristophanes, a production which starred the mediaevalist and ghost-story writer, M. R. James. Parry received an honorary degree from Cambridge University in the same year. Subsequently, he wrote music for Oxford productions of Aristophanes: &quot;The Frogs&quot; (1892), &quot;The Clouds&quot; (1905) and &quot;The Acharnians&quot; (1914). He had also provided elaborate incidental music for a West End production by Beerbohm Tree, &quot;Hypatia&quot; (1893). Among Parry&#x27;s considerable output of music for the theatre, there was only one attempt at opera: &quot;Guenever&quot;, which was turned down by the Carl Rosa Opera Company.
When Grove retired as director of the Royal College of Music, Parry succeeded him from January 1895 and held the post until his death. In 1900 he succeeded John Stainer as Heather Professor. In an obituary tribute in 1918 Robin Legge, music critic of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, lamented these academic calls on Parry&#x27;s time, believing that they got in the way of his principal calling – composition. Ralph Vaughan Williams, who studied at the RCM under Parry, rated him highly as both composer and teacher. Of Parry in the latter capacity he wrote:
As head of the Royal College of Music, Parry numbered among his leading pupils Ralph Vaughan Williams, Gustav Holst, Frank Bridge and John Ireland.

Despite the demands of his academic posts, Parry&#x27;s personal beliefs, which were Darwinian and humanist, led him to compose a series of six &quot;ethical cantatas&quot;, experimental works in which he hoped to supersede the traditional oratorio and cantata forms. They were generally unsuccessful with the public, though Elgar admired &quot;The Vision of Life&quot; (1907), and &quot;The Soul&#x27;s Ransom&quot; (1906) has had several modern performances.

Following the death of his stepmother, Ethelinda Lear Gambier-Parry, in 1896, Parry succeeded to the family estate at Highnam. He was created a Knight Bachelor in 1898. It was announced that he would receive a baronetcy in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902 for the (subsequently postponed) coronation of King Edward VII, and on 24 July 1902 he was created a Baronet, of Highnam Court, in the parish of Highnam, in the county of Gloucester.

===Last years===
Parry resigned his Oxford appointment on medical advice in 1908 and, in the last decade of his life, produced some of his best-known works, including the &quot;Symphonic Fantasia 1912&quot; (also called &quot;Symphony No. 5&quot;), the &quot;Ode on the Nativity&quot; (1912) and the &quot;Songs of Farewell&quot; (1916–1918). The piece by which he is best known, the setting of William Blake&#x27;s poem &quot;And did those feet in ancient time&quot; (1916), was immediately taken up by the suffragist movement, with which both Parry and his wife were strongly in sympathy.

Parry held German music and its traditions to be the pinnacle of music, and was a friend of German culture in general. He was, accordingly, certain that Britain and Germany would never go to war against each other, and was in despair when World War I broke out. In the words of the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;: &quot;During the war he watched a life&#x27;s work of progress and education being wiped away as the male population, particularly the new fertile generation of composing talent—of the Royal College, dwindled.&quot; During the war, he acted as chairman of the Music in Wartime Committee, and did much to relieve the prevailing distress among poorer musicians.

In the autumn of 1918 Parry contracted Spanish flu during the global pandemic and died at Knightscroft, Rustington, West Sussex, on 7 October aged 70. The death certificate says cause of death: 1. Influenza; 2. Septicaemia. His daughter, Gwendoline Maud Greene, was present at his death.At the urging of Stanford, he was buried in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. The site of his birthplace, in Richmond Hill, Bournemouth, next door to the Square, is marked with a blue plaque; there is a memorial tablet, with an inscription by the Poet Laureate, Robert Bridges, in Gloucester Cathedral, unveiled during the Three Choirs Festival of 1922. Parry&#x27;s baronetcy became extinct at his death. Highnam passed to his half-brother, Major Ernest Gambier-Parry.

==Legacy==
In 2015 seventy unpublished works by Parry were discovered, including some which may never have been publicly performed. The manuscripts were sent for auction by Parry&#x27;s descendants but failed to reach their reserve price.

Documentary film about the music and life of Parry &quot;The Prince and the Composer&quot; was broadcast on BBC Four on 27 May 2011. The film was presented by Charles III, the then-Prince of Wales.

===Music===

Parry&#x27;s biographer Jeremy Dibble writes:

Many colleagues and critics have concluded that Parry&#x27;s music is that of a conventional and not strongly creative Englishman. Delius said of him, &quot;How a man rolling in wealth, the lord of many acres &amp; living off the fat of the land can write anything about Job beats me entirely&quot; and in 1948 Bax, who was unaware of Parry&#x27;s radical politics, wrote, &quot;Parry, Stanford, Mackenzie – they were all three solid reputable citizens ... model husbands and fathers without a doubt, respected members of the most irreproachably Conservative clubs, and in Yeats&#x27;s phrase had &#x27;no strange friend&#x27;. Of this I am sure.&quot; The view of Parry taken by Bax and Bernard Shaw was contradicted by his daughter Dorothea in 1956:
In an analysis of Parry&#x27;s compositional process, Michael Allis draws attention to a widely held but inaccurate belief that Parry was a facile composer who dashed off new works without effort. He quotes the mid-20th century critics H. C. Colles and Eric Blom as equating Parry&#x27;s supposed facility with superficiality. Allis also quotes Parry&#x27;s diary, which regularly recorded his difficulties in composition: &quot;struggled along with the Symphony&quot;, &quot;thoroughly terrible and wearing grind over the revisions&quot;, &quot;stuck fast&quot; and so on. Parry himself is partly responsible for another belief about his music, that he was neither interested in nor good at orchestration. In a lecture at the RCM he was censorious of Berlioz who, in Parry&#x27;s view, disguised commonplace musical ideas by glittering orchestration: &quot;When divested of its amazingly variegated colour the ideas themselves do not convince us or exert much fascination.&quot; Bax and others took this to mean that Parry (and Stanford and Mackenzie) &quot;regarded sensuous beauty of orchestral sound as not quite nice&quot;. In 2001, the American writers Nicolas Slonimsky and Laura Kuhn took the view: &quot;In his orchestral music, Parry played a significant role in the fostering of the British symphonic tradition. While his orchestral works owe much to the German Romanticists, particularly Mendelssohn, Schumann, and Brahms, he nevertheless developed a personal style notable for its fine craftsmanship and mastery of diatonic writing. His 5 [symphonies] reveal a growing assurance in handling large forms. He also wrote some effective incidental music and fine chamber pieces.&quot;

The early influence of Wagner on Parry&#x27;s music can be heard in the &quot;Concertstück&quot; for orchestra (1877), the overture &quot;Guillem de Cabestanh&quot; (1878), and especially in &quot;Scenes from Prometheus Unbound&quot; (1880). Dibble notes a more thoroughly absorbed Wagnerian influence in &quot;Blest Pair of Sirens&quot;, and points to the influence of Brahms on such works as the Piano Quartet in A flat (1879) and the Piano Trio in B minor (1884).

===Books on music===
Parry wrote about music throughout his adult life. As well as his 123 articles in Grove&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot;, his publications include &quot;Studies of Great Composers&quot; (1886); &quot;The Art of Music&quot; (1893), enlarged as &quot;The Evolution of the Art of Music&quot; (1896) and described by H. C. Colles as &quot;one of the foundations of English musical literature&quot;; &quot;The Music of the Seventeenth Century&quot; — Volume III of the Oxford History of Music (1902); &quot;Johann Sebastian Bach: the Story of the Development of a Great Personality&quot; (1909), rated by &quot;The Times&quot; as his most important book; and &quot;Style in Musical Art&quot;, collected Oxford lectures (1911).

<text>John Rae (, ; 30 September 1813 – 22 July 1893) was a Scottish surgeon who explored parts of northern Canada. He was a pioneer explorer of the Northwest Passage.

Rae explored the Gulf of Boothia, northwest of the Hudson Bay, from 1846 to 1847, and the Arctic coast near Victoria Island from 1848 to 1851. In 1854, back in the Gulf of Boothia, he obtained credible information from local Inuit peoples about the fate of the Franklin Expedition, which had disappeared in the area in 1848. Rae was noted for his physical stamina, skill at hunting, boat handling, use of native methods, and ability to travel long distances with little equipment while living off the land.

== Early life ==
Rae was born as the sixth of nine children at the Hall of Clestrain in Orkney in the north of Scotland with family ties to Clan MacRae. His father managed up to 300 tenant farmers for a local nobleman, Sir William Honyman, Lord Armadale and worked for many years as the Hudson Bay Company&#x27;s chief representative on the Orkney islands when it came to hiring workers amongst the Orkney men that had a reputation of being hardy and skilled labourers. Already in his childhood the young John Rae learned many skills that would become useful to his later explorations. By the age of fifteen, Rae had become an excellent musket hunter, rock climber and hiker, enjoying hobbies like fishing and boating.

After studying medicine in Edinburgh, he graduated with a degree from the University of Edinburgh and was licensed by the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh at age 19 in 1833. Two months after graduating he accepted a post for a season as the ship&#x27;s surgeon aboard the Prince of Wales, a supply ship for the Hudson Bay fur trading settlements. During his first voyage the ship was kept from its return home to Great Britain by an early winter 1833 and pack ice closing the route. The ship&#x27;s crew had to spend the winter on the deserted Charlton Island. Rae&#x27;s skills as a hunter and doctor, as well as his knowledge about fauna and its pharmaceutical merits managed to keep most men alive throughout the winter and heavy cases of scurvy, that took two lives among the crew.

He went to work for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company as a surgeon, accepting a post at Moose Factory, Ontario, where he remained for ten years. While working for the company, treating both European and indigenous employees, Rae became known for his prodigious stamina and skilled use of snowshoes. He learned to live off the land like a native and, working with the local craftsmen, designed his own snowshoes. This knowledge allowed him to travel great distances with little equipment and few followers, unlike many other explorers of the Victorian era.

== Explorations ==
=== Gulf of Boothia ===

From 1836 to 1839, the Scottish explorer and fur trader Thomas Simpson sailed along much of the northern coast of Canada. His cousin Sir George Simpson proposed to link the furthest-east point Thomas Simpson had reached by sending an overland expedition from Hudson Bay. Rae was chosen because of his well-known skill in overland travel, but he first had to travel to the Red River Colony to learn the art of surveying. On , Rae left Moose Factory, went up the Missinaibi River, and took the usual voyageur route west.

When he reached the Red River Colony on 9 October, he found his instructor seriously ill. After the man died, Rae headed for Sault Ste. Marie in Ontario to find another instructor. The two-month, winter journey was by dog sled along the north shore of Lake Superior. From there, Sir George told him to go to Toronto to study under John Henry Lefroy at the Toronto Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory. Returning from Toronto, he received final instructions at Sault Ste. Marie.

Rae finally departed on the voyage to Simpson&#x27;s furthest-east on 5 August 1845, taking the usual voyageur route via Lake Winnipeg and reaching York Factory on 8 October, where he wintered. On 12 June 1846, he headed north in two boats and reached Repulse Bay at the south end of the Melville Peninsula in July. The local Inuit told him that there was salt water to the northwest, so he chose this as his base. On his first journey, which began on 26 July, he dragged one of his boats northwest to Committee Bay in the south of the Gulf of Boothia. Here he learned from the Inuit that the Gulf of Boothia was a bay and that he would have to cross land to reach Simpson&#x27;s furthest-east.

In 1830, John Ross had also been told that the Gulf of Boothia was a bay. He sailed partway up the east coast of the Gulf, but soon turned back because he needed to make preparations for winter. He became one of the first Europeans to winter in the high Arctic without the aid of a depot ship. By December he had learned how to build igloos, which he later found warmer than European tents.

Rae&#x27;s second journey began on 5 April 1847. He crossed to Committee Bay, travelled up its west coast for four days and then headed west across the base of the Simpson Peninsula to Pelly Bay. He went north and from a hill thought he could see Lord Mayor Bay, on the west side of the Gulf of Boothia, where John Ross had been trapped in ice from 1829 to 1833. He circled much of the coast of the Simpson Peninsula and returned to Repulse Bay. His third journey began on 13 May 1847. He crossed from Repulse Bay to Committee Bay and went up the east coast hoping to reach the Fury and Hecla Strait, which William Edward Parry&#x27;s men had seen in 1822. The weather was bad and they began to run short of food. On 28 May, Rae turned back at a place he called Cape Crozier which he thought was about south of the strait.

He left Repulse Bay on 12 August, when the ice broke up, and reached York Factory on 6 September 1847. He soon left for England and Scotland. Although he had not reached Simpson&#x27;s furthest-east, he had reduced the gap to less than .

=== Arctic coast ===
From 1848 to 1851, Rae made three journeys along the Arctic coast. The first took him from the Mackenzie River to the Coppermine River, which had been done before. On the second he tried to cross to Victoria Island but was blocked by ice. On the third he explored the whole south coast of Victoria Island.
By 1848, it was clear that Sir John Franklin&#x27;s expedition, which had traveled west from the coast of Greenland in 1845, had been lost in the Arctic. Three expeditions were sent to find him: one from the east, one through the Bering Strait, and one overland to the Arctic coast, this last led by Sir John Richardson. Most of the Arctic coast had been traced a decade earlier by Thomas Simpson. North of the coast were two coastlines called Wollaston Land and Victoria Land (Victoria Island). Franklin&#x27;s crew was thought to be somewhere in the unexplored area north of that. The 61-year-old Richardson chose Rae as his second-in-command.

==== First journey ====
The Rae–Richardson Arctic Expedition left Liverpool in March 1848, reached New York, and took the usual voyageur routes west from Montreal. On 15 July 1848, the expedition reached Fort Resolution on Great Slave Lake. John Bell was sent downriver to establish winter quarters at Fort Confidence on the east arm of Great Bear Lake. Richardson and Rae traveled down the Mackenzie River and turned east along the coast.

They hoped to cross north to Wollaston Land, as southern Victoria Island was then known, but ice conditions made this impossible. Through worsening ice, they rounded Cape Krusenstern at the west end of Coronation Gulf (not Cape Krusenstern in Alaska), and turned south. By the first of September it was clear that they had run out of time, so they abandoned their boats and headed overland. They crossed the Rae River and Richardson River and on 15 September reached their winter quarters at Fort Confidence at the northeast end of Great Bear Lake.

==== Second journey ====
In December 1848 and January 1849, Rae made two trips northeast to find a better route to Coronation Gulf. On 7 May, Richardson and Bell left with most of the men. Rae left on 9 June with seven men. Hauling a boat overland they reached the Kendall River on 21 June. The next day they reached the Coppermine River and waited a week for the ice to break up. They descended the Coppermine and waited again for the ice to clear on Coronation Gulf.

It was 30 July before they reached Cape Krusenstern on Coronation Gulf. From here they hoped to cross the Dolphin and Union Strait to Wollaston Land. On 19 August, they made the attempt, but after they were caught in fog and moving ice and spent three hours rowing back to their starting point. Rae waited as long as he could and turned back, reaching Fort Confidence on the first of September. On the return journey their boat was lost at Bloody Falls and Albert One-Eye, the Inuk interpreter, was killed.

==== Third journey ====
They reached Fort Simpson to the west of Yellowknife in late September 1849, where Rae took charge of the Mackenzie River district. A week later William Pullen showed up, having sailed east from the Bering Strait and up the Mackenzie River. In June 1850, Rae and Pullen went east up the Mackenzie with that year&#x27;s furs. On 25 June, just short of Great Slave Lake, he was met by an express canoe. Pullen was promoted to captain and told to go north and try again. Rae received three letters from Sir George Simpson, Francis Beaufort, and Lady Jane Franklin all telling him to return to the Arctic. Simpson promised supplies and left the route to Rae&#x27;s discretion. Pullen left immediately with most of the equipment.

Rae escorted the furs as far as Methye Portage and returned to Fort Simpson in August. En route he wrote Sir George a letter outlining his complex but ultimately successful plan. That winter he would go to Fort Confidence and build two boats and collect supplies. Next spring he would use dog sleds to cross to Wollaston Land and go as far as he could before the ice melt made it impossible to recross the Strait. Meanwhile, his men would have hauled the boats overland to Coronation Gulf. When the ice melted he would follow the coast by boat as long as there was open water. He reached Fort Confidence in September and spent the winter there.

On 25 April 1851, he left the fort. On 2 May he crossed the frozen strait via Douglas Island to Lady Franklin Point, the southwestern-most point on Victoria Island. Heading east he passed and named the Richardson Islands and passed what he thought was the westernmost point reached by Thomas Simpson on his return journey in 1839. Heading west he passed Lady Franklin Point and followed the coast north and west around Simpson Bay, which he named. The coast swung north but it was getting late.

He made a final push, the coast swung to the northeast and on 24 May, he could look north across Prince Albert Sound. Unknown to Rae, just 10 days earlier, a sledge party from Robert McClure&#x27;s expedition had been on the north side of the sound. He turned south, crossed Dolphin and Union Strait safely and on 5 June turned inland. The journey to camp on the Kendall River was the least pleasant part of the journey since he had to travel over melting snow and through meltwater.

On 15 June 1851, two days after the boat arrived, he set off down the Kendall River and Coppermine River with 10 men. He waited several times for the ice to clear and in early July he started east along the south coast of Coronation Gulf. In late July he crossed the mouth of Bathurst Inlet and reached Cape Flinders at the western end of the Kent Peninsula. He reached Cape Alexander at its east end on 24 July, and on 27 July crossed the strait to Victoria Island. He explored Cambridge Bay which he found to be a better harbour than Dease and Simpson had reported.

He left the bay and went east along an unknown coast. The coast swung north and the weather got worse. By August he was in Albert Edward Bay. Blocked by ice, he went north on foot and reached his furthest on 13 August. Returning, he left a cairn which was found by Richard Collinson&#x27;s men two years later. He then made three unsuccessful attempts to cross Victoria Strait east to King William Island. Victoria Strait is nearly always impassable. On 21 August, he found two pieces of wood that had clearly come from a European ship. These were probably from Franklin&#x27;s ship, but Rae chose not to guess.

On 29 August, he reached Lady Franklin Point and crossed to the mainland. He worked his way up the swollen Coppermine and reached Fort Confidence on 10 September. He had traveled on land, by boat, charted of unknown coast, followed the whole south coast of Victoria Island, and proved that Wollaston Land and Victoria Land were part of the same island, but had not found Franklin.

=== Franklin&#x27;s fate ===

Rae headed south to Fort Chipewyan in Alberta, waited for a hard freeze, travelled by snowshoe to Fort Garry in Winnipeg, took the Crow Wing Trail to Saint Paul, Minnesota, and then travelled to Chicago, then Hamilton, Ontario, New York, and London, which he reached in late March 1852. In England he proposed to return to Boothia and complete his attempt to link Hudson Bay to the Arctic coast by dragging a boat to the Back River. He went to New York, Montreal, and then Sault Ste. Marie by steamer, Fort William by canoe, and reached York Factory on 18 June 1853, where he picked up his two boats.

He left on 24 June and reached Chesterfield Inlet on 17 July. Finding a previously unknown river, he followed it for before it became too small to use. Judging that it was too late to drag the boat north to the Back River, he turned back and wintered at his old camp on Repulse Bay. He left Repulse Bay on 31 March 1854. Near Pelly Bay he met some Inuit, one of whom had a gold cap-band. Asked where he got it, he replied that it came from a place 10 to 12 days away where 35 or so &quot;kabloonat&quot; had starved to death. Rae bought the cap-band and said he would buy anything similar.

On 27 April, he reached frozen salt-water south of what is now called Rae Strait. A few miles west, on the south side of the bay, he reached what he believed was the Castor and Pollux River, which Simpson had reached from the west in 1839. He then turned north along the western portion of the Boothia Peninsula, the last uncharted coast of North America, hoping to reach Bellot Strait and so close the last gap in the line from Bering Strait to Hudson Bay. The coast continued north instead of swinging west to form the south shore of King William Land.

On 6 May, he reached his furthest north, which he named Point de la Guiche after an obscure French traveller he had met in New York. It appeared that King William Land was an island and the coast to the north was the same as had been seen by James Clark Ross in 1831. Author Ken McGoogan has claimed that Rae here effectively discovered the final link in the Northwest Passage as followed in the following century by Roald Amundsen, although Arctic historian William Barr has disputed that claim, citing the uncharted between Ross&#x27;s discoveries and the Bellot Strait.

With only two men fit for heavy travel, Rae turned back. Reaching Repulse Bay on 26 May, he found several Inuit families who had come to trade relics. They said that four winters ago some other Inuit had met at least 40 &quot;kabloonat&quot; who were dragging a boat south. Their leader was a tall, stout man with a telescope, thought to be Francis Crozier, Franklin&#x27;s second-in-command. They communicated by gestures that their ships had been crushed by ice and that they were going south to hunt deer. When the Inuit returned the following spring they found about 30 corpses and signs of cannibalism. One of the artefacts Rae bought was a small silver plate. Engraved on the back was &quot;Sir John Franklin, K.C.H&quot;. With this important information, Rae chose not to continue exploring. He left Repulse Bay on 4 August 1854, as soon as the ice cleared.

Upon his return to Britain, Rae made two reports on his findings: one for the public, which omitted any mention of cannibalism, and another for the British Admiralty, which included it. However, the Admiralty mistakenly released the second report to the press, and the reference to cannibalism caused great outcry in Victorian society. Franklin&#x27;s widow Lady Jane enlisted author Charles Dickens, who wrote a tirade against Rae in his magazine &quot;Household Words&quot; deriding the report as &quot;the wild tales of a herd of savages&quot;, and later attacked Rae and the Inuit further in his 1856 play &quot;The Frozen Deep&quot;. Arctic explorer Sir George Richardson joined them, stating that cannibalism could not be the action of Englishmen but surely the Inuit themselves. This campaign likely prevented Rae from receiving a knighthood for his efforts. 20th century archaeology efforts in King William Island later confirmed that Franklin Expedition members had resorted to cannibalism.

=== Later career ===
With the prize money awarded for finding evidence of the fate of Franklin&#x27;s expedition, Rae commissioned the construction of a ship intended for polar exploration, the &quot;Iceberg&quot;. The ship was built at Kingston, Canada West. Rae moved to Hamilton, Canada West, also on Lake Ontario, in 1857, where his two brothers lived and operated a shipping firm on the Great Lakes.

The &quot;Iceberg&quot; was launched in 1857. Rae intended to sail her to England the following year to be outfitted for polar voyages. In the meantime, she was put to use as a cargo ship. She was lost with all seven men on board in 1857, on her first commercial trip, hauling coal from Cleveland, Ohio, to Kingston. The wreck, somewhere in Lake Ontario, has never been located. While in Hamilton, Rae became a founding member of the Hamilton Scientific Association, which became the Hamilton Association for the Advancement of Literature, Science and Art, one of Canada&#x27;s oldest scientific and cultural organizations.

In 1860, Rae worked on the telegraph line to America, visiting Iceland and Greenland. In 1864, he made a further telegraph survey in the west of Canada. In 1884, at age 71, he was again working for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, this time as an explorer of the Red River for a proposed telegraph line from the United States to Russia.

== Death and legacy ==

John Rae died from an aneurysm in Kensington, west London, on 22 July 1893. A week later his body arrived in Orkney. He was buried at St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall, Orkney.

A memorial to Rae, lying as in sleep upon the ground, is inside the cathedral. The memorial by North Ronaldsay sculptor Ian Scott, unveiled at Stromness pierhead in 2013, is a statue of Rae with an inscription describing him as &quot;the discoverer of the final link in the first navigable Northwest Passage.&quot; Rae Strait, Rae Isthmus, Rae River, Mount Rae, Point Rae, and Rae-Edzo were all named for him.

The outcome of Lady Franklin&#x27;s efforts to glorify the dead of the Franklin expedition meant that Rae, who had discovered evidence suggesting a much less noble fate, was shunned somewhat by the British establishment. Although he found the first clue to the fate of Franklin, Rae was never awarded a knighthood, nor was he remembered at the time of his death, dying quietly in London. In comparison, fellow Scot and contemporary explorer David Livingstone was buried with full imperial honours in Westminster Abbey.

Historians have since studied Rae&#x27;s expeditions and his roles in finding the Northwest Passage and learning the fate of Franklin&#x27;s crew. Authors such as Ken McGoogan have noted Rae was willing to adopt and learn the ways of indigenous Arctic peoples, which made him stand out as the foremost specialist of his time in cold-climate survival and travel. Rae also respected Inuit customs, traditions, and skills, which went against the beliefs of many 19th-century Europeans that most native peoples were too primitive to offer anything of educational value.

In July 2004, Orkney and Shetland MP Alistair Carmichael introduced into the UK Parliament a motion proposing, &quot;inter alia&quot;, that the House &quot;regrets that Dr Rae was never awarded the public recognition that was his due&quot;. In March 2009, he introduced a further motion urging Parliament to formally state it &quot;regrets that memorials to Sir John Franklin outside the Admiralty headquarters and inside Westminster Abbey still inaccurately describe Franklin as the first to discover the [North West] passage, and calls on the Ministry of Defence and the Abbey authorities to take the necessary steps to clarify the true position.&quot; In October 2014, a plaque dedicated to Rae was installed at Westminster Abbey.

Rae is depicted in the 2008 movie &quot;Passage&quot; from the National Film Board of Canada.

He is the subject of the song &#x27;John Rae&#x27;s Welcome Home&#x27; by Scottish folksinger Malcolm MacWatt.

In June 2011, a blue plaque was installed by English Heritage on the house where John Rae spent the last years of his life, No. 4 Lower Addison Gardens, in Kensington, west London. After a conference in September 2013 in Stromness, Orkney to celebrate the 200th anniversary of John Rae&#x27;s birth, a statue was erected to Rae at the pierhead. In December 2013, The John Rae Society, a registered charity under Scottish law, was formed in Orkney to promote Rae&#x27;s achievements.

In 2014, Historic Environment Scotland awarded a plaque to commemorate Rae at his birthplace, the Hall of Clestrain. The John Rae Society purchased the Hall in 2016 with the intent of developing a museum to commemorate Rae and his achievements. The Society began its crowdfunding campaign to restore the house in December 2024.

<text>Bellapais is a small village in the Kyrenia District in the northern part of Cyprus, about four miles from the town of Kyrenia. It is under the &quot;de facto&quot; control of Northern Cyprus.

The village was the home for some years of Lawrence Durrell, who wrote about life in Cyprus in his book &quot;Bitter Lemons&quot;. He mentions passing the time drinking coffee under the Tree of Idleness in the village and there are two places which lay claim to being the spot. His book did not identify it completely, and two establishments profit from the name. His house, up a very steep climb, has a plaque on it and one can have the pleasure of returning by a not-quite-so-perpendicular way that passes by old olive presses.

The jewel of the village is Bellapais Abbey or &quot;The Abbey of Peace (from French: &quot;Abbaye de la Belle Paix&quot;). Built by canons regular of the Premonstratensian Order in the 13th century, it is a most imposing ruin in a wonderful position commanding a long view down to Kyrenia and the Mediterranean Sea.

Most of the monastic buildings surround the cloister. In Britain these would normally be built on the south side of the church so to some extent protect the living quarters from the cold air from the north. At Bellapais, the monastic buildings are on the north, probably to be cooler, although occasionally the lay of the land dictated position.

<text>Georges Auric (; 15 February 1899 – 23 July 1983) was a French composer, born in Lodève, Hérault, France. He was considered one of &quot;Les Six&quot;, a group of artists informally associated with Jean Cocteau and Erik Satie. Before he turned 20 he had orchestrated and written incidental music for several ballets and stage productions. He also had a long and distinguished career as a film composer.

==Early life and education==
Georges Auric began his musical career at a young age, performing a piano recital at the Société musicale indépendante at the age of 14. Several songs that he had written were then performed in the following year by Société Nationale de Musique. Along with his early successes professionally, Auric studied music at the Paris Conservatoire, as well as composition with Vincent d&#x27;Indy at the Schola Cantorum de Paris and Albert Roussel. Having gained recognition as a child prodigy both in composition and piano performance, he became a protégé of Erik Satie during the following decade. During the 1910s and 20s, he was a significant contributor of avant-garde music in Paris and was significantly influenced by Cocteau and the other composers of &quot;Les Six&quot;.

==Career==

Auric&#x27;s early compositions were marked by a reaction against the musical establishment and the use of referential material. Because of this and his association with Cocteau and Satie, Auric was grouped into &quot;Les Six&quot; by music critic Henri Collet, and was friends with the artist Jean Hugo. His participation led to writing settings of poetry and other texts as songs and musicals. Along with the other five composers, he contributed a piece to &quot;L&#x27;Album des Six&quot;. In 1921, Cocteau asked him to write the music for his ballet, &quot;Les Mariés de la tour Eiffel&quot;. He found himself short of time, so he asked his fellow composers of &quot;Les Six&quot; to contribute some music. All except Louis Durey agreed. During this time, he wrote his one-act opera &quot;Sous le masque&quot; (1927) (an earlier opera, &quot;La Reine de coeur&quot; (1919), is lost). It was also in 1927 that he contributed the Rondeau for the children&#x27;s ballet &quot;L&#x27;Éventail de Jeanne&quot;, a collaboration between ten French composers. In 1952 he participated in yet another collaboration, the set of orchestral variations &quot;La Guirlande de Campra&quot;. &quot;Les Six&quot;, though an informal and short-lived group, became known for its reaction against the musical establishment of the time and the promotion of absurdism and satire; the group rebelled similarly against Wagner as it did against Debussy. The music of these composers, including Auric, represented the specific cultural scene of Paris at the time and rejected the international styles brought by Russian and German music, as well as the impressionism and symbolism of Debussy. Auric&#x27;s later development as a populist composer was prefigured by many of the techniques and ideals of Les Six, especially the use of popular music and situations. Music of the circus or the dance hall played a significant role in the music of Les Six, especially in their actual collaborations. However, &quot;Les Six&quot; soon drew apart, with Auric and others taking different approaches to their art.

Following his early successes as an avant-garde composer, Auric went through a transitional period during the 1930s. He began writing for film in 1930 and composed the music for &quot;À Nous la Liberté&quot; in 1931, which was well received; there was general approval of Auric&#x27;s score for the film. While he was beginning a successful career as a film composer, his music went through a period of stagnation and change. His Piano Sonata (1931) was poorly received and was followed by a period of five years in which he wrote very little, including his first three film scores. His association with Cocteau continued through this period with his composition of the score to Cocteau&#x27;s &quot;Le Sang d&#x27;un poète&quot;. However, he abandoned the elitist and highly referential attitudes of his earlier years by 1935 in favour of a populist approach. He became associated with leftist groups and publications, including the Association des Ecrivains et des Artistes Révolutionnaires (AEAR), the &quot;Maison de la Culture&quot;, and the Fédération Musicale Populaire. He adopted four strategies to composing; first, to participate in groups with other leftist artists; second, to reach a wider audience by writing in more genres; third, to write music aimed at a younger audience; and fourth, to express his political views more directly in his music.

The films that Auric chose to score in his career as a film composer were influenced by these new-found beliefs, as well as by old associations. He collaborated with Jean Cocteau, his longtime associate from the days of Les Six, on eleven films. He composed music for a large number of films over the years, including films produced in France, England, and America. Among his most popular scores is the score for &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;. The song from that movie, &quot;Where Is Your Heart?&quot;, became very popular. In 1962, he gave up writing for motion pictures when he became director of the Opéra National de Paris and then chairman of SACEM, the French Performing Rights Society. Auric continued to write classical chamber music, especially for winds, right up to his death.

Music criticism was another major facet of Auric&#x27;s career. His criticism was focused on promoting the ideals of Les Six and Cocteau, known as &quot;esprit nouveau&quot;. Specifically, his criticism focused on the perceived pretentiousness of Debussy, Wagner, Saint-Saëns, and Massenet, as well as the music of those who followed their styles. Cocteau, Les Six, and Auric found the music of those composers to be divorced from reality and instead preferred music that was grounded in populism.

==Personal life and politics==
While Auric criticized Satie in the 1920s for joining the French Communist Party, he became associated with several leftist groups and contributed to the communist newspapers &quot;Marianne&quot; and &quot;Paris-Soir&quot; in the 1930s. The Association des Ecrivains et des Artistes Révolutionnaires (AEAR) was dedicated to bringing together Soviet and French communist artists to discuss their goals and approaches for disseminating their ideas to the public. It was through this group that Auric met many other far left artists and thinkers. These ideals transferred into Auric&#x27;s concert music as well as his choices in which movies he scored. In 1930, Auric married the painter Eleanore Vilter, who died in 1982. Auric died in Paris on 23 July 1983 at the age of 84, and was interred at Montparnasse Cemetery, beside his wife.

<doc id="144471" wikidata="Q15529972" url="?curid=144471" title="David Bossie">
<text>David Norman Bossie (born November 1, 1965) is an American political activist. Since 2000, he has been president and chairman of conservative advocacy group Citizens United and in 2016, Bossie was the deputy campaign manager to the Donald Trump presidential campaign.

Subsequently, Bossie had a falling-out with the Trump campaign and administration in May 2019 after Axios reported that Bossie had been accused by the Internal Revenue Service of defrauding political donors by funneling their donations to himself through consultants and book sales. In January 2020 he returned to prominent association with the Trump administration as a strategic ally to help contest the impeachment of Donald Trump based on his past familiarity with impeachment battles.

In 1992, Bossie joined Citizens United as a researcher, during which time Citizens United produced many films promoting Republican perspectives and talking points. Later in the 1990s, Bossie had a troubled turn as congressional investigator. Bossie was hired by the chairman of the House Committee on Government Reform and new Oversight in 1997 as chief investigator to look into possible campaign finance abuses by U.S. President Bill Clinton. In May 1998, bipartisan concern mounted over inappropriate redaction of tapes and transcripts of former U.S. Associate AG Webster Hubbell&#x27;s prison telephone calls omitting some exculpatory passages. Newt Gingrich pressed for Bossie&#x27;s resignation which followed shortly thereafter.

In 2010, Bossie produced the American documentary film &quot;Generation Zero&quot; for Citizens United Productions, written and directed by Steve Bannon, which attributes in some measure the origins of the financial crisis of 2007–2008 to moral failings of the Baby Boom generation, in particular their turning away from parental values during the countercultural 1960s. Bossie has written several books attacking Democratic rivals, including John Kerry, Bill Clinton, and Hillary Clinton, as well as a political memoir co-authored with Corey Lewandowski concerning Donald Trump&#x27;s successful 2016 presidential campaign.

In June 2018, Bossie, a regular guest on Fox News programs, made a statement to a fellow guest which was an insult to African-Americans; he later apologized. Fox News suspended him for two weeks, calling the remarks &quot;deeply offensive and wholly inappropriate.&quot;

==Early life==
Bossie grew up in Massachusetts. He attended Towson State University and the University of Maryland, but dropped out before graduation. When he was 18 years old he volunteered in Ronald Reagan&#x27;s reelection campaign.

==Career==

A volunteer firefighter in his youth, Bossie dropped out of university to pursue politics. Bossie was the youth director of Senator Bob Dole&#x27;s 1988 presidential campaign.

===Congressional investigator===
After the Republicans won control of the United States House of Representatives in the 1994 elections, Dan Burton (R-IN) became chairman of the House Committee on Government Reform and new Oversight. In 1997, he hired Bossie as chief investigator to look into possible campaign finance abuses by U.S. President Bill Clinton.

By May 1998, Burton came under intense partisan pressure; even fellow Republicans complained that committee staff had published redacted tapes and transcripts of former United States Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell&#x27;s prison telephone calls omitting some passages. Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich pressed Burton to seek Bossie&#x27;s resignation. Shortly thereafter, Burton accepted Bossie&#x27;s resignation.

===Citizens United===

During his tenure at Citizens United, which he had joined as a researcher after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, the organization focused increasingly on producing film documentaries through its Citizens United Productions division. Their films have included:
*&quot;Border War: The Battle Over Illegal Immigration&quot;
*&quot;Celsius 41.11&quot;
*&quot;Rediscovering God in America&quot;, hosted by Newt and Callista Gingrich
*&quot;Occupy Unmasked&quot;

Citizens United hoped to begin distribution of the feature film &quot;&quot; in January or February 2008. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 made that an unlawful electioneering communication. They sued, unsuccessfully, for an injunction to prohibit the Federal Election Commission from enforcement of those provisions of BCRA on First Amendment grounds.

In a 2010 landmark decision, the Supreme Court decided &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot; for Citizens United. For-profit corporations and not-for-profit corporations may now advertise and broadcast messages of a political nature without limits on how much they can spend and with few limits on the timing and nature of the messages.

===Trump presidential campaigns===
In September 2016, presidential candidate Donald Trump hired Bossie to be his new deputy campaign manager. In November 2020, following the conclusion of the 2020 presidential election, Trump recruited Bossie again to challenge ballot counting in states with tight margins. On November 9, it was reported that Bossie had tested positive for COVID-19. He had attended Trump&#x27;s Election Night party, as had others who tested positive around the same time, such as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. At this point, Bossie dropped out of the recount effort. In February 2022, Bossie &quot;spearheaded&quot; a Republican National Committee resolution to formally censure Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger for their perceived disloyalty to Trump.

== Publications ==
Bossie is the author of &quot;The Many Faces of John Kerry&quot; (Thomas Nelson, 2004), a hostile look at the Democratic nominee in the 2004 United States presidential election, then-Senator John Kerry. He also wrote &quot;Intelligence Failure&quot; (Thomas Nelson, 2004), a book alleging that failings on the part of the national security apparatus during the Clinton administration led to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Bossie authored the &quot;highly partisan&quot; 2008 publication &quot;Hillary: the Politics of Personal Destruction&quot;, which is credited with delivering, in 2016, an insistent, long-term campaign theme to Trump of &quot;LOCK HER UP!&quot;

At the 2010 Tea Party movement Convention, Bossie debuted the documentary &quot;Generation Zero&quot;, focusing on the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and insinuating that it was caused by the supposed selfishness of the entire Baby Boomer generation. The documentary, produced by Bossie for Citizens United Productions, had been written and directed by Steve Bannon, and was poorly reviewed by historians as &quot;conceit&quot;, &quot;fiction&quot; and &quot;pseudoscience&quot;.

In December 2017, &quot;Let Trump Be Trump&quot;, a memoir co-authored by Bossie and Corey Lewandowski, was published by Center Street. The book chronicles their experiences working on Donald Trump&#x27;s successful 2016 presidential campaign.

==Personal==
David and his wife Susan reside in Montgomery County, Maryland with their four children. He has been a volunteer firefighter there since 1998. 

Bossie received the Ronald Reagan Award from the Conservative Political Action Conference in 1999. He also was ranked number two in &quot;Politico&quot;&#x27;s top 50 most influential people in American politics in 2015, tied with Charlie Spies.

<text>Citizens United is a conservative 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization in the United States founded in 1988. In 2010, the organization won a U.S. Supreme Court case known as &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot;. The Court ruled that corporations and unions could not be prohibited from making independent expenditures in federal elections, citing First Amendment protections of free speech. As of 2025, the organization’s president and chairman is David Bossie.

== Overview ==
Citizens United&#x27;s stated mission is to restore the United States government to &quot;citizens&#x27; control, through a combination of education, advocacy, and grass-roots organization&quot; seeking to &quot;reassert the traditional American values of limited government, freedom of enterprise, strong families, and national sovereignty and security.&quot; Citizens United is a conservative political advocacy group organized under Section 501(c)4 of the federal tax code, meaning that donations are not tax deductible. To fulfill this mission, Citizens United produces television commercials, web advertisements, and documentary films. CU film &quot;Perfect Valor&quot; was named Best Documentary at the GI Film Festival, and &quot;Ronald Reagan: Rendezvous with Destiny&quot; also received a Remi Award at WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival.

David Bossie has been its president since 2000. In 2016 he took a leave of absence to be deputy campaign manager of Donald Trump&#x27;s campaign for President of the United States. Its offices are on Pennsylvania Avenue in the Capitol Hill area of Washington, D.C.

== Leadership ==
The current president, David Bossie, has been president since he served as the chief investigator into then President Bill Clinton&#x27;s possible abuse of finances in 1997, and was later the deputy campaign manager for Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign in 2016. In 2020, he served in executive positions for President Donald Trump&#x27;s and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s reelection campaigns.

==History==

The political action committee Citizens United was founded in 1988 by Floyd Brown, a longtime Washington political consultant. The group promotes free enterprise, socially conservative causes and candidates who advance their mission.

==Positions and advocacy==
Citizens United is known for its support of conservatives in politics. The group produced a television advertisement that reveals several legislative actions taken by John McCain, which aired on Fox News Channel. On October 2, 2006, in reaction to revelations of a cover-up of inappropriate communications between Republican Congressman Mark Foley and House pages, Citizens United president David Bossie called on Dennis Hastert to resign over his role in covering up the scandal.

The group sued and lost a case against New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman over Schneiderman&#x27;s demand that it disclose all its donors.

In 1999, Citizens United wrote and funded a VHS tape produced by The Strategy Group on the Clinton administration&#x27;s relationship with Chinese businessmen called &quot;The Truth Revealed... Confidential Report: Bill Clinton, Al Gore and the Communist Chinese Connection&quot;. It is written and hosted by then company president, Floyd G. Brown.

Citizens United campaigned against Michael Moore&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;, advocating for government limits on how much advertising the film received. It also made advertisements attacking the film, and when the Federal Election Commission held that Moore&#x27;s film was not a violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act, produced its own rebuttal film called &quot;Celsius 41.11.&quot; However, the FEC held that paying to air &quot;Celsius 41.11&quot; would constitute an illegal corporate campaign expenditure.

In 2008, Citizens United produced a documentary film highly critical of Hillary Clinton called &quot;&quot;. Fearing prosecution from the FEC, the organization sought a declaratory judgment in federal court to assure their right to show the movie, leading ultimately to the Supreme Court decision in &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot;. It previously produced and screened advertisements attacking other Democrats, including Bill Clinton, John Kerry, and Al Gore. In the 1988 US presidential election, Citizens United ran an ad that used Willie Horton to attack Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.

The group has produced a film criticizing the United Nations.

== Trump administration ==

In 2016, the Donald Trump presidential campaign enlisted Citizens United President David Bossie as deputy campaign manager. During the campaign, Bossie made regular television appearances on behalf of the Trump campaign. Bossie is a close friend and longtime acquaintance of Trump administration officials Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway, having introduced Bannon to Trump in 2011.

== Documentaries ==
Citizens United has released 25 documentaries including:
* &quot;The Truth Revealed... Confidential Report: Bill Clinton, Al Gore and the Communist Chinese Connection&quot; (1999)
* &quot;Celsius 41.11&quot; (2004)
* &quot;Border War: The Battle Over Illegal Immigration&quot; (2006)
* &quot;&quot; (2008)
* &quot;Rediscovering God in America&quot; (2008)
* &quot;Fire From the Heartland: The Awakening of the Conservative Woman&quot; (2010)
* &quot;Generation Zero&quot; (2010)
* &quot;Nine Days that Changed the World&quot; (2010)
* &quot;Occupy Unmasked&quot; (2012)

== &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot; ==

Citizens United was the plaintiff in a Supreme Court case that began as a challenge to various statutory provisions of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), known as the &quot;McCain-Feingold&quot; law. The case revolved around the documentary &quot;Hillary: The Movie&quot;, which was produced by Citizens United. Under the McCain-Feingold law, a federal court in Washington, D.C., ruled that Citizens United would be barred from advertising its film. The case ([ 08-205], 558 U.S. 50 (2010)) was heard in the United States Supreme Court on March 24, 2009. During oral argument, the government argued that under existing precedents, it had the power under the Constitution to prohibit the publication of books and movies if they were made or sold by corporations. After that hearing, the Court requested re-argument specifically to address whether deciding the case required the Court to reconsider those earlier decisions in &quot;Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce&quot; and &quot;McConnell v. FEC&quot;. The case was re-argued on September 9. On January 21, 2010, the Supreme Court overturned the provision of McCain-Feingold barring corporations and unions from paying for political ads made independently of candidate campaigns. A dissenting opinion by Justice Stevens was joined by Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and Justice Sotomayor.

==Funding==

Citizens United has accepted funding from The Presidential Coalition, LLC (which according to their website is &quot;An Affiliate Of Citizens United&quot;) and the Koch brothers.

<doc id="144475" wikidata="Q275013" url="?curid=144475" title="Austen Henry Layard">
<text>Sir Austen Henry Layard (; 5 March 18175 July 1894) was an English Assyriologist, traveller, cuneiformist, art historian, draughtsman, collector, politician and diplomat. He was born to a mostly English family in Paris and largely raised in Italy. He is best known as the excavator of Nimrud and of Nineveh, where he uncovered a large proportion of the Assyrian palace reliefs known, and in 1851 the library of Ashurbanipal. Most of his finds are now in the British Museum. He made a large amount of money from his best-selling accounts of his excavations.

He had a political career between 1852, when he was elected as a Member of Parliament, and 1869, holding various junior ministerial positions. He was then made ambassador to Madrid, then Constantinople, living much of the time in a palazzo he bought in Venice. During this period he built up a significant collection of paintings, which due to a legal loophole he had as a diplomat, he was able to extricate from Venice and bequeath to the National Gallery (as the Layard Bequest) and other British museums.

==Family==
Layard was born in Paris, France, to a family of Huguenot descent. His father, Henry Peter John Layard, of the Ceylon Civil Service, was the son of Charles Peter Layard, Dean of Bristol, and grandson of Dr Daniel Peter Layard, a physician. His mother, Marianne, daughter of Nathaniel Austen, banker, of Ramsgate, was of partial Spanish descent. His uncle was Benjamin Austen, a London solicitor and close friend of Benjamin Disraeli in the 1820s and 1830s. Edgar Leopold Layard the ornithologist was his brother.

On 9 March 1869, at St. George&#x27;s Church, Hanover Square, Westminster, London, he married his first cousin once removed, Mary Enid Evelyn Guest. Enid, as she was known, was the daughter of Sir Josiah John Guest and Lady Charlotte Elizabeth Bertie. Their marriage was reportedly a happy one, and they never had any children.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Much of Layard&#x27;s boyhood was spent in Italy, where he received part of his schooling, and acquired a taste for the fine arts and a love of travel from his father; but he was at school also in England, France and Switzerland. After spending nearly six years in the office of his uncle, Benjamin Austen, he was tempted to leave England for Sri Lanka (Ceylon) by the prospect of obtaining an appointment in the Civil Service, and he started in 1839 with the intention of making an overland journey across Asia.

After wandering for many months, chiefly in Persia, with Bakhtiari people and having abandoned his intention of proceeding to Ceylon, he returned in 1842 to the Ottoman capital Constantinople where he made the acquaintance of Sir Stratford Canning, the British Ambassador, who employed him in various unofficial diplomatic missions in European Turkey. In 1845, encouraged and assisted by Canning, Layard left Constantinople to make those explorations among the ruins of Assyria with which his name is chiefly associated. This expedition was in fulfilment of a design which he had formed when, during his former travels in the East, his curiosity had been greatly excited by the ruins of Nimrud on the Tigris, and by the great mound of Kuyunjik, near Mosul, already partly excavated by Paul-Émile Botta.

===Excavations and the arts===

Layard remained in the neighbourhood of Mosul, carrying on excavations at Kuyunjik and Nimrud, and investigating the condition of various peoples, until 1847; and, returning to England in 1848, published &quot;Nineveh and Its Remains&quot; (2 vols., 1848–1849).

To illustrate the antiquities described in this work he published a large folio volume of &quot;The Monuments of Nineveh. From Drawings Made on the Spot&quot; (1849). After spending a few months in England, and receiving the degree of D.C.L. from the University of Oxford and the Founder&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society, Layard returned to Constantinople as attaché to the British embassy, and, in August 1849, started on a second expedition, in the course of which he extended his investigations to the ruins of Babylon and the mounds of southern Mesopotamia. He is credited with discovering the Library of Ashurbanipal during this period. His record of this expedition, &quot;Discoveries in the Ruins of Nineveh and Babylon&quot;, which was illustrated by another folio volume, called &quot;A Second Series of the Monuments of Nineveh&quot;, was published in 1853. During these expeditions, often in circumstances of great difficulty, Layard despatched to England the splendid specimens which now form the greater part of the collection of Assyrian antiquities in the British Museum. Layard believed that the native Syriac Christian communities living throughout the Near East were descended from the ancient Assyrians.

Apart from the archaeological value of his work in identifying Kuyunjik as the site of Nineveh, and in providing a great mass of materials for scholars to work upon, these two books of Layard were among the best written books of travel in the English language.

Layard was an important member of the Arundel Society, and in 1866 he was appointed a trustee of the British Museum. In the same year Layard founded &quot;Compagnia Venezia Murano&quot; and opened a venetian glass showroom in London at 431 Oxford Street.
Today Pauly &amp; C. - Compagnia Venezia Murano is one of the most important brands of venetian art glass production.

===Political career===
Layard now turned to politics. Elected as a Liberal member for Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire in 1852, he was for a few weeks Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, but afterwards freely criticised the government, especially in connection with army administration. He was present in the Crimea during the war, and was a member of the committee appointed to inquire into the conduct of the expedition. In 1855 he refused from Lord Palmerston an office not connected with foreign affairs, was elected lord rector of Aberdeen University, and on 15 June moved a resolution in the House of Commons (defeated by a 359–46 majority) declaring that in public appointments merit had been sacrificed to private influence and an adherence to routine. After being defeated at Aylesbury in 1857, he visited India to investigate the causes of the Indian Mutiny. He unsuccessfully contested York in 1859, but was elected for Southwark in 1860, and from 1861 to 1866 was Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs in the successive administrations of Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell. After the Liberals returned to office in 1868 under William Ewart Gladstone, Layard was made First Commissioner of Works and sworn of the Privy Council.

===Diplomatic career===

Layard resigned from office in 1869, on being sent as envoy extraordinary to Madrid. In 1877 he was appointed by Lord Beaconsfield Ambassador at Constantinople, where he remained until Gladstone&#x27;s return to power in 1880, when he finally retired from public life. In 1878, on the occasion of the Berlin Congress, he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath.

===Retirement in Venice===

Layard retired to Venice. There he took up residence in the sixteenth-century palazzo on the grand canal named Ca Cappello, just behind Campo San Polo, and which he had commissioned historian Rawdon Brown, another long-time British resident of Venice, to purchase for him in 1874.
In Venice he devoted much of his time to collecting pictures of the Venetian school, and to writing on Italian art.
On this subject he was a disciple of his friend Giovanni Morelli, whose views he embodied in his revision of Franz Kugler&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of Painting, Italian Schools&quot; (1887). He wrote also an introduction to Constance Jocelyn Ffoulkes&#x27;s translation of Morelli&#x27;s &quot;Italian Painters&quot; (1892–1893), and edited that part of &quot;Murray&#x27;s Handbook of Rome&quot; (1894) which deals with pictures. In 1887 he published, from notes taken at the time, a record of his first journey to the East, entitled &quot;Early Adventures in Persia, Susiana and Babylonia&quot;. The late nineteenth century English novelist George Gissing thought it &#x27;one of the most interesting books&#x27; vowing to &#x27;read it again some day&#x27;. An abbreviation of this work, which as a book of travel is even more delightful than its predecessors, was published in 1894, shortly after the author&#x27;s death, with a brief introductory notice by Lord Aberdare. Layard also from time to time contributed papers to various learned societies, including the Huguenot Society, of which he was first president.

He died on 5 July 1894 at his residence 1 Queen Anne Street, Marylebone, London. After a post mortem autopsy his remains were cremated at the Woking Crematorium in Surrey. His ashes were interred in the cemetery of Canford Magna Parish Church in Dorset, England.

<text>A bullpup firearm is one with its firing grip located in front of the breech of the weapon, instead of behind it. This creates a weapon with a shorter overall length for a given barrel length, and one that is often lighter, more compact, concealable, and more maneuverable than a conventionally configured firearm. Where it is desirable for troops to be issued a more compact weapon, the use of a bullpup configuration allows for barrel length to be retained, thus preserving muzzle velocity, range, and ballistic effectiveness.

The bullpup concept was first tested militarily in 1901 with the British Thorneycroft carbine, but it was not until the Cold War that more successful designs and improvements led to wider adoption. In 1977, the Austrian Army became the first military force in the world to adopt a bullpup rifle, the Steyr AUG, as a principal combat weapon. Since then the militaries in many countries have followed suit with other bullpup designs, such as the Chinese QBZ-95, Israeli IWI Tavor, French FAMAS and British SA80.

==Etymology==
The origin of 
term &quot;bullpup&quot; for this configuration has long been unclear. In 1957, the word was reported to denote a target pistol, particularly one with a fancy stock.

British firearm expert Jonathan Ferguson researched the origin of the term in 2019–2020. He found early references in 1930s firearm magazines implying that &quot;bullpup&quot; is derived from an analogy of such rifles to bulldog puppies (colloquially called &quot;bullpups&quot; in England during the late 19th and the early 20th century), which were considered &quot;squat, ugly but still aggressive and powerful&quot;. The original meaning of the word to describe dogs has since fallen out of use.

==Description==

The bullpup design places the gun&#x27;s action mechanism and magazine behind the trigger, and the receiver functionally serves as the buttstock with usually only a thin endplate, making the gun more of a &quot;stockless&quot; weapon from a pure technical sense. The magazine is also inserted behind the trigger group (technically it only needs the magazine&#x27;s feeding slot to be located behind the trigger for the gun to be classified as a bullpup), but in some designs such as the Heckler &amp; Koch G11, FN P90 and Neostead, the magazine can extend forward beyond the trigger.

===Advantages===
* The primary benefit of a bullpup weapon is that the weapon&#x27;s overall length can be significantly decreased without reducing the barrel length. This allows a bullpup weapon to be more easily maneuvered and concealed than a conventional weapon with a similar barrel length, especially in tight spaces.
* In some designs, the shorter length of stock reduces the weight compared to a conventional rifle with the same action.
* The center of mass of a bullpup weapon is more posterior, thus closer to the shooter&#x27;s core. This means less torque when moved around, making the handling kinematically more comfortable, especially when the shooter is running.
* Due to the shorter distance between the action and the butt plate, the recoil impulse is transmitted more directly into the shooter&#x27;s shoulder, with less leverage to create muzzle rise.

===Disadvantages===
* When using a bullpup weapon, the user&#x27;s face is much closer to the action. This can increase noise issues and cause irritation to the shooter&#x27;s eye and nose from exhaust gas. Spent cartridge cases may be ejected directly into the face of left-handed shooters. It can be difficult for a right-handed shooter to &quot;off-hand&quot; the weapon. For weapons with reciprocating charging handles, there is also the risk of their charging handles striking left-handed users. The process of changing the ejection side varies in complexity depending on the weapon, but as a general rule it requires at least some disassembly and cannot be done &quot;on the fly&quot;, such as when an unusual shooting position might call for the weapon to be used on the other shoulder. On some weapons, such as the SA80, changing the ejection side is simply not possible. As a result, bullpups often require unusual ejection mechanisms to allow easy ambidextrous operation. This is solved on some designs with ejection downward (FN P90, Kel-Tec RDB) or forward (FN F2000, Kel-Tec RFB).
* In case of a catastrophic failure, a bullpup weapon is more dangerous because both the barrel and the action are nearer to the shooter&#x27;s head, neck and torso.
* When using iron sights, bullpup firearms typically have a shorter sight radius than conventional designs of the same barrel length, compromising accuracy.
* Bullpup weapons need a much longer trigger-sear linkage due to the trigger&#x27;s forward position, so they tend to have stiffer, less precise triggers. Trigger pull characteristics are consequently a frequent criticism of bullpup weapons.
* Changing magazines is often less intuitive and ergonomic, and it is very difficult to perform a &quot;drop free&quot; change. This can be particularly problematic when the weapon is equipped with a sling, which attaches nearer to the magazine well in bullpup weapons and can physically interfere with magazine insertion.

==History==

The earliest bullpup firearm known is a heavy bench-rest target rifle made circa 1860 for a Professor Richard Potter by Riviere of London. It weighs more than and features an octagonal barrel of approximately 20 bore (0.60 in) in calibre, with two-groove Brunswick rifling. It is held in the collection of the British National Rifle Association. One of the earliest repeating bullpup designs was patented by William Joseph Curtis in 1866. The concept was later used in bolt-action rifles such as the Thorneycroft carbine of 1901, although the increased distance from hand grip to bolt handle meant the decreased length had to be weighed against the increased time required to fire. It was used in semi-automatic firearms in 1918 (6.5 mm French Faucon-Meunier semi-automatic rifle developed by Lt. Col. Armand-Frédéric Faucon), then in 1936 a bullpup machine pistol was patented by the Frenchman Henri Delacre. The first bullpup design used in combat was the PzB M.SS.41 anti-tank rifle during World War II. It was a Czech weapon used by the SS, produced under German occupation.

After World War II, Western engineers drew inspiration from the German Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifle, which offered a compromise between bolt-action rifles and submachine guns. Among them was Kazimierz Januszewski (also known as Stefan Janson), a Polish engineer who had worked at the Polish national arsenal during the 1930s. After being mobilized during World War II he escaped German and Soviet forces and made his way to England, where he was a part of the &quot;Polish design team&quot; at Enfield Lock&#x27;s Royal Small Arms Factory. The factory was run by lieutenant colonel Edward Kent-Lemon. As Januszewski was developing a new rifle, the &quot;Ideal Calibre Board&quot; was searching for a replacement for the .303 cartridge. The Board decided on an optimal 7 mm cartridge on which Januszewski and the two teams working at Enfield had to base their designs. One design team led by Stanley Thorpe produced a gas-powered rifle with a locking system based on the Sturmgewehr. The design used steel pressings which were difficult to obtain, and so was scrapped. The result of the Polish design team&#x27;s efforts was the EM-2, which broke significant ground.

The EM-2 contained some similarities to the Soviet AK-47, although Januszewski had never seen the Soviet rifle. The first significant bullpup assault rifle came from the British programme to replace the service pistols, sub-machine guns, and rifles. In the two forms of the EM-1 and the EM-2, the new rifle concept was born as a result of the experience with small arms that was gained during the Second World War.

It was obvious that modern warfare would require the infantry to be armed with a light, selective fire weapon, with effective range much longer than that of a submachine gun, but shorter than that of conventional semi-automatic or bolt-action rifles. The bullpup design was deemed necessary to retain the accuracy at range while reducing overall length. The EM-2 was adopted by the UK in 1951 as the world&#x27;s first (limited) service bullpup rifle, but was promptly displaced by the adoption of the 7.62×51mm NATO (0.308 in) cartridge, to which the EM-2 was not easily adapted. The decision was rescinded and a variant of the more conventional FN FAL was adopted in its place.

A 7.62×39mm M43 calibre experimental assault rifle was developed by German A. Korobov in the Soviet Union around 1945, and a further development, the TKB-408 was entered for the 1946–47 assault rifle trials by the Soviet Army, although it was rejected in favour of the more conventional AK-47. The United States briefly experimented in the same year with the integrally-scoped Model 45A bullpup, which never progressed beyond the prototype; John Garand designed the T31 bullpup, which was abandoned after his retirement in 1953.

After these failures of the bullpup design to achieve widespread service, the concept continued to be explored (for example: a second Korobov bullpup, the TKB-022PM).

===Adoption===



The Steyr AUG (selected in 1977) is often cited as the first successful bullpup, in service with the armed forces of over twenty countries, and the primary rifle of Austria and Australia. It was highly advanced for the 1970s, combining in the same weapon the bullpup configuration, extensive use of polymer, dual vertical grips, an optical sight as standard, and a modular design. Highly reliable, light, and accurate, the Steyr AUG showed clearly the potential of the bullpup layout. The arrival of the FAMAS in 1978, and its adoption by France emphasized the slide from traditional to bullpup layouts within rifle designs.

The British resumed their bullpup experiments with the L85, which entered service in 1985. After persistent reliability problems, it was redesigned by the then British-owned Heckler &amp; Koch into the L85A2, to be a fully reliable weapon. As of 2016, it was replaced by the L85A3 which is lighter, more adaptable, and more durable.

Having learned from extensive combat experience, Israel Military Industries developed a bullpup rifle: the Tavor TAR-21. The Tavor is light, accurate, fully ambidextrous and reliable (designed to stringent reliability standards to avoid malfunctioning in desert conditions), and is in increasing demand in other countries, notably India. The Tavor shares many similarities with the SAR 21 and the South African Vektor CR-21.

The Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army adopted the Type 95 gun family in 1997, a family of bullpup firearms sharing a common receiver design, which includes the QBZ-95 standard rifle, a carbine and light support weapon variants. The Islamic Republic of Iran Army has adopted the KH-2002 in limited numbers.

Some sniper rifles such as the American Barrett M95 and XM500, German Walther WA 2000 and DSR-1, Chinese QBU-88, Russian SVU, Polish Bor. It is also used for combat shotgun designs such as the Neostead and Kel-Tec KSG.

<text>Giles Lytton Strachey (; 1 March 1880 – 21 January 1932) was an English writer and critic. A founding member of the Bloomsbury Group and author of &quot;Eminent Victorians&quot;, he established a new form of biography in which psychological insight and sympathy are combined with irreverence and wit. His biography &quot;Queen Victoria&quot; (1921) was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize.

==Early life and education==

=== Youth ===
Strachey was born on 1 March 1880 at Stowey House, Clapham Common, London, the fifth son and 11th child of Lieutenant General Sir Richard Strachey, an officer in the British colonial armed forces, and his second wife, the former Jane Grant, who became a leading supporter of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. He was named Giles Lytton after an early 16th-century Gyles Strachey and the first Earl of Lytton, who had been a friend of Richard Strachey&#x27;s when he was Viceroy of India in the late 1870s. The Earl of Lytton was also Lytton Strachey&#x27;s godfather. The Stracheys had thirteen children in total, ten of whom survived to adulthood, including Lytton&#x27;s sister Dorothy Strachey and youngest brother, the psychoanalyst, James Strachey.

When Lytton was four years old the family moved from Stowey House to 69 Lancaster Gate, north of Kensington Gardens. This was their home until Sir Richard retired 20 years later. Lady Strachey was an enthusiast for languages and literature, making her children perform their own plays and write verse from an early age. She thought that Lytton had the potential to become a great artist so she decided that he would receive the best education possible to be &quot;enlightened.&quot; By 1887 he had begun the study of French, and he was to admire French culture throughout his life.

Strachey was educated at a series of schools, beginning at Parkstone, Dorset. This was a small school with a wide range of after-class activities, where Strachey&#x27;s acting skills exceeded those of other pupils; he was particularly convincing when portraying female parts. He told his mother how much he liked dressing as a woman in real life to confuse and entertain others.

Lady Strachey decided in 1893 that her son should start his more serious education and sent him to Abbotsholme School in Rocester, Derbyshire, where pupils were required to do manual work every day. Strachey, who always had a fragile physique, objected to this requirement and after a few months, he was transferred to Leamington College, where he became a victim of savage bullying. Sir Richard, however, told his son to &quot;grin and bear the petty bullying.&quot; Strachey did eventually adapt to the school and became one of its best pupils. In the 1960s one of the four &#x27;houses&#x27; at the school was named after him. His health also seems to have improved during the three years he spent at Leamington, although various illnesses continued to plague him.

When Strachey turned 17 in 1897, Lady Strachey decided that he was ready to leave school and go to university, but because she thought he was too young for Oxford she decided that he should first attend a smaller institution, the University of Liverpool. There Strachey befriended the professor of modern literature, Walter Raleigh, who, besides being his favourite teacher, also became the most influential figure in his life before he went up to Cambridge. In 1899 Strachey took the Christ Church scholarship examination, wanting to get into Balliol College, Oxford, but the examiners determined that Strachey&#x27;s academic achievements were not remarkable and were struck by his &quot;shyness and nervousness.&quot; They recommended Lincoln College as a more suitable institution, advice that Lady Strachey took as an insult, deciding then that he would attend Trinity College, Cambridge, instead.

=== Cambridge ===
Strachey was admitted as a Pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 30 September 1899. He became an Exhibitioner in 1900 and a Scholar in 1902. He won the Chancellor&#x27;s Medal for English Verse in 1902 and was given a BA degree after he had won a second class in the History Tripos in June 1903. He did not however take leave of Trinity but remained until October 1905 to work on a thesis that he hoped would gain him a fellowship. Strachey was often ill and had to leave Cambridge repeatedly to recover from the palpitations that affected him.

Strachey&#x27;s years at Cambridge were happy and productive. Among the freshers at Trinity, there were three with whom Strachey soon became closely associated: Clive Bell, Leonard Woolf and Saxon Sydney-Turner. With another undergraduate, A. J. Robertson, these students formed a group called the Midnight Society, which, in the opinion of Bell, was the source of the Bloomsbury Group. Other close friends at Cambridge were Thoby Stephen and his sisters Vanessa and Virginia Stephen (later Bell and Woolf respectively).

Strachey also belonged to the Conversazione Society, the Cambridge Apostles to which Tennyson, Hallam, Maurice, and Sterling had once belonged. The Apostles formulated an elitist doctrine of &quot;Higher Sodomy&quot; which differentiated the homosexual acts of the intelligent from those of &quot;ordinary&quot; men. In these years Strachey was highly prolific in writing verse, much of which has been preserved and some of which was published at the time. Strachey also became acquainted with other men who greatly influenced him, including G. Lowes Dickinson, John Maynard Keynes, Walter Lamb (brother of the painter Henry Lamb), George Mallory, Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore. Moore&#x27;s philosophy, with its assumption that the &quot;summum bonum&quot; lies in achieving a high quality of humanity, in experiencing delectable states of mind, and in intensifying experience by contemplating great works of art, was a particularly important influence.

In the summer of 1903, Strachey applied for a position in the education department of the Civil Service. Even though the letters of recommendation written for him by those under whom he had studied showed that he was held in high esteem at Cambridge, he failed to get the appointment and decided to try for a fellowship at Trinity College. From 1903 through 1905 he wrote a 400-page dissertation on Warren Hastings, the 18th-century Indian imperialist, but the work failed to secure Strachey the fellowship and led to his return to London.

==Career==
=== Beginnings ===

After Strachey left Cambridge in 1905, his mother assigned him a bed-sitting room at 69 Lancaster Gate. After the family moved to 67 Belsize Gardens in Hampstead, and later to another house in the same street, he was assigned other bed-sitters. But, as he was about to turn 30, family life started irritating him, and he took to travelling into the country more often, supporting himself by writing reviews and critical articles for &quot;The Spectator&quot; and other periodicals. In 1909 he spent some weeks at a health spa in Saltsjöbaden, near Stockholm in Sweden. In this period he also lived for a while in a cottage on Dartmoor and about 1911–12 spent a whole winter at East Ilsley on the Berkshire Downs. During this time he decided to grow a beard, which became his most characteristic feature. On 9 May 1911 he wrote to his mother:

In 1911 H. A. L. Fisher, a former President of the British Academy and the Board of Education, was in search of someone to write a short one-volume survey of French literature. Fisher had read one of Strachey&#x27;s reviews (&quot;Two Frenchmen,&quot; &quot;Independent Review&quot; (1903)) and asked him to write an outline in 50,000 words, giving him J. W. Mackail&#x27;s &quot;Latin Literature&quot; (1909) as a model. &quot;Landmarks in French Literature&quot;, dedicated to &quot;J[ane] M[aria] S[trachey],&quot; his mother, was published on 12 January 1912. Despite almost a full column of praise in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; of 1 February and sales that by April 1914 had reached nearly 12,000 copies in the British Empire and America, the book brought Strachey neither the fame he craved nor the money he badly needed.

===&quot;Eminent Victorians&quot; and later career===
Soon after the publication of &quot;Landmarks&quot;, Strachey&#x27;s mother and his friend Harry Norton supported him financially. Each provided him with £100, which, together with his earnings from the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; and other periodicals, made it possible for him to rent a small thatched cottage, The Lacket, outside the village of Lockeridge, near Marlborough, Wiltshire. He lived there until 1916 and it was there that he wrote the first three parts of &quot;Eminent Victorians&quot;.

Strachey&#x27;s theory of biography was now fully developed and mature. He was greatly influenced by Dostoyevsky, whose novels he had been reading and reviewing as they appeared in Constance Garnett&#x27;s translations. The influence of Freud was important in Strachey&#x27;s later works, most notably on &quot;Elizabeth and Essex&quot;, but not at this earlier stage.

In 1916 Lytton Strachey was back in London, living with his mother at 6 Belsize Park Gardens, Hampstead, where she had now moved. In the late autumn of 1917, however, his brother Oliver and his friends Harry Norton, John Maynard Keynes, and Saxon Sydney-Turner agreed to pay the rent on the Mill House at Tidmarsh, near Pangbourne, Berkshire.

From 1904 to 1914 Strachey contributed book and theatre reviews to &quot;The Spectator&quot;. Under the pseudonym &quot;Ignotus&quot;, he also published several drama reviews.

During the First World War, Strachey applied for recognition as a conscientious objector, but in the event, he was granted exemption from military service on health grounds. He spent much of the war with like-minded people such as Lady Ottoline Morrell and the Bloomsburys.

His first great success, and his most famous achievement, was &quot;Eminent Victorians&quot; (1918), a collection of four short biographies of Victorian heroes. Unlike any biography of its time, &quot;Eminent Victorians&quot; examines the career and psychology of historical figures by using literary devices such as paradox, antithesis, hyperbole, and irony. This work was followed by another in the same style, &quot;Queen Victoria&quot; (1921).

From then on, Strachey needed no further financial aid. He continued to live at Tidmarsh until 1924 when he moved to Ham Spray House near Marlborough, Wiltshire. This was his home for the rest of his life.

==Death==
Strachey died of stomach cancer on 21 January 1932, aged 51. It is reported that his final words were: &quot;If this is dying, then I don&#x27;t think much of it.&quot;

==Personal life and sexuality==
Strachey spoke openly about his homosexuality with his Bloomsbury friends and had relationships with a variety of men including Ralph Partridge. He had a &quot;passionate love affair&quot; with the economist John Maynard Keynes, another Bloomsbury member, who was bisexual.

Strachey met the painter Dora Carrington during the First World War and they had a strong but platonic relationship thereafter until his death. They eventually established a permanent home together at Ham Spray House, where Carrington would paint and Strachey would educate her in literature. In 1921, Carrington agreed to marry Partridge, not for love but to secure a three-way relationship. Partridge eventually formed a relationship with Frances Marshall, another Bloomsbury member. Shortly after Strachey died, Carrington took her own life. Partridge married Marshall in 1933. Strachey was mainly interested sexually in Partridge, as well as in various other young men, including a secret sadomasochistic relationship with Roger Senhouse, later the head of the publishing house Secker &amp; Warburg. Strachey&#x27;s letters, edited by Paul Levy, were published in 2005.

==In popular culture==
Virginia Woolf&#x27;s husband Leonard Woolf said that in her experimental novel &quot;The Waves&quot;, &quot;there is something of Lytton in Neville&quot;. Lytton is also said to have been the inspiration behind the character of St John Hirst in her novel &quot;The Voyage Out&quot;. Michael Holroyd describes Strachey as the inspiration behind Cedric Furber in Wyndham Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Self-Condemned&quot;. In Lewis&#x27;s novel &quot;The Apes of God&quot; he is seen in the character of Matthew Plunkett, whom Holroyd describes as &quot;a maliciously distorted and hilarious caricature of Lytton&quot;. In the Terminus Note in E. M. Forster&#x27;s &quot;Maurice&quot;, Forster remarks that the Cambridge undergraduate Risley in the novel is based on Strachey.

Strachey was portrayed by Jonathan Pryce in the film &quot;Carrington&quot; (1995), which won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival that year, while Pryce won Best Actor for his performance. In the film &quot;Al sur de Granada&quot; (2003), Strachey was portrayed by James Fleet.

Strachey was portrayed by Ed Birch in the 2015 mini-series &quot;Life in Squares&quot;.

Strachey was portrayed by Nigel Planer as Lytton Scratchy in &quot;Gloomsbury&quot;, by Sue Limb, a parody of the Bloomsbury Group, 5 series, 2012-2018 on BBC Radio 4.

Strachey was portrayed by Simon Russell Beale in the 2020 BBC Radio 3 play &quot;Elizabeth and Essex&quot; by Robin Brooks.

<doc id="144484" wikidata="Q723346" url="?curid=144484" title="Lee–Enfield">
<text>The Lee–Enfield is a bolt-action, magazine-fed repeating rifle that served as the main firearm of the military forces of the British Empire and Commonwealth during the first half of the 20th century, and was the standard service rifle of the British Armed Forces from its official adoption in 1895 until 1957.

A redesign of the Lee–Metford (adopted by the British Army in 1888), the Lee–Enfield superseded it and the earlier Martini–Henry and Martini–Enfield rifles. It featured a ten-round box magazine which was loaded with the .303 British cartridge manually from the top, either one round at a time or by means of five-round chargers. The Lee–Enfield was the standard-issue weapon to rifle companies of the British Army, colonial armies (such as India and parts of Africa), and other Commonwealth nations in both the First and Second World Wars (such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Canada). Although officially replaced in the United Kingdom with the L1A1 SLR in 1957, it remained in widespread British service until the early/mid-1960s and the 7.62 mm L42A1 sniper variant remained in service until the 1990s. As a standard-issue infantry rifle, it is still found in service in the armed forces of some Commonwealth nations, notably with the Bangladesh Police, which makes it the second longest-serving military bolt-action rifle still in official service, after the Mosin–Nagant (Mosin-Nagant receivers are used in the Finnish 7.62 Tkiv 85). Total production of all Lee–Enfields is estimated at over 17 million rifles.

The Lee–Enfield takes its name from the designer of the rifle&#x27;s bolt system—James Paris Lee—and the location where its rifling design was created—the Royal Small Arms Factory in Enfield.

==Design and history==
The Lee–Enfield rifle was derived from the earlier Lee–Metford, a mechanically similar black-powder rifle, which combined James Paris Lee&#x27;s rear-locking bolt system that had a barrel featuring rifling designed by William Ellis Metford. The bolt has a relatively short bolt throw and features rear-mounted lugs, and the bolt operating handle places the bolt knob just rearwards of the trigger at a favourable ergonomic position close to the operator&#x27;s hand. The action features helical locking surfaces (the technical term is interrupted threading). This means that final headspace is not achieved until the bolt handle is turned down all the way. Helical locking lugs were probably used both to allow the chambering of imperfect or dirty ammunition and also so that the closing cam action is distributed over the entire mating faces of both bolt and receiver lugs. This is one reason the bolt closure feels smooth. The rifle was also equipped with a detachable sheet-steel, 10-round, double-column magazine, a very modern development in its day. Originally, the concept of a detachable magazine was opposed in some British Army circles, as some feared that the private soldier might be likely to lose the magazine during field campaigns. Early models of the Lee–Metford and Lee–Enfield even used a short length of chain to secure the magazine to the rifle. To further facilitate rapid aimed fire the rifle can be cycled by most riflemen without loss of sight picture.

These design features facilitate rapid cycling and fire compared to other bolt-action designs like the Mauser. The Lee bolt-action and 10-round magazine capacity enabled a well-trained rifleman to perform the &quot;mad minute&quot; firing 20 to 30 aimed rounds in 60 seconds, making the Lee–Enfield the fastest military bolt-action rifle of the day. The current world record for aimed bolt-action fire was set in 1914 by a musketry instructor in the British Army—Sergeant Instructor Snoxall—who placed 38 rounds into a target at in one minute. Some straight-pull bolt-action rifles were thought faster but lacked the simplicity, reliability, and generous magazine capacity of the Lee–Enfield. Several First World War accounts tell of British troops repelling German attackers who subsequently reported that they had encountered machine guns, when in fact it was simply a group of well-trained riflemen armed with SMLE Mk III rifles.

The Lee–Enfield was adapted to fire the .303 British service cartridge, a rimmed, high-powered rifle round. Experiments with smokeless powder in the existing Lee–Metford cartridge seemed at first to be a simple upgrade, but the greater heat and pressure generated by the new smokeless powder wore away the shallow and rounded Metford rifling after approximately 6,000 rounds. Replacing this with a new square-shaped rifling system designed at the Royal Small Arms Factory (RSAF) Enfield solved the problem, and the Lee–Enfield was born.

===Models/marks of Lee–Enfield rifle and service periods===

==Magazine Lee–Enfield==

The Lee–Enfield rifle was introduced in November 1895 as the &quot;.303 calibre, Rifle, Magazine, Lee–Enfield&quot;, or more commonly &quot;magazine Lee–Enfield&quot;, or &quot;MLE&quot; (sometimes spoken as &quot;emily&quot; instead of M, L, E). The next year, a shorter version was introduced as the &quot;Lee–Enfield cavalry carbine Mk I&quot;, or LEC, with a barrel as opposed to the one in the &quot;long&quot; version. Both underwent a minor upgrade series in 1899 (the omission of the cleaning / clearing rod), becoming the Mk I*. Many LECs (and LMCs in smaller numbers) were converted to special patterns, namely the &quot;New Zealand carbine&quot; and the &quot;Royal Irish Constabulary carbine&quot;, or NZ and RIC carbines, respectively. Some of the MLEs (and MLMs) were converted to load from chargers, and designated &quot;Charger Loading Lee–Enfields&quot;, or &quot;CLLEs&quot;.

==Short magazine Lee–Enfield Mk I==
A shorter and lighter version of the original MLE—the &quot;Rifle, Short, Magazine, Lee–Enfield&quot; or &quot;SMLE&quot; (sometimes spoken as &quot;Smelly&quot;, rather than &quot;S-M-L-E&quot;)—was introduced on 1 January 1904. The barrel was now halfway in length between the original long rifle and the carbine, at 25.2 inches (640 mm). The SMLE&#x27;s visual trademark was its blunt nose, with only the bayonet boss protruding a small fraction of an inch beyond the nosecap, being modelled on the Swedish Model 1894 cavalry carbine. The new rifle also incorporated a charger loading system, another innovation borrowed from the Mauser rifle and notably different from the fixed &quot;bridge&quot; that later became the standard: a charger clip (stripper clip) guide on the face of the bolt head. The shorter length was controversial at the time; many rifle association members and gunsmiths were concerned that the shorter barrel would not be as accurate as the longer MLE barrels, that the recoil would be much greater and the sighting radius would be too short.

==Short magazine Lee–Enfield Mk III==

The best-known Lee–Enfield rifle, the &quot;SMLE Mk III&quot;, was introduced on 26 January 1907, along with a Pattern 1907 bayonet and featured a simplified rear sight arrangement and a fixed, rather than a bolt-head-mounted sliding, charger guide. The design of the handguards and the magazine were also improved and the chamber was adapted to fire the new Mk VII high velocity spitzer .303 ammunition. Many early models, magazine Lee–Enfields (MLEs), magazine Lee–Metfords (MLMs) and SMLEs, were rebuilt to the Mk III standard. These are called &quot;Mk IV Cond.&quot;, with various asterisks denoting subtypes. Another feature present on the No. 1 Mk III as well as many other models of the SMLE was a field cleaning kit enclosed behind a trapdoor in the buttstock which included a barrel pull through with various cloths and an oil bottle enclosed deeper within the compartment.

During the First World War, the SMLE Mk III was found to be too complicated to manufacture (an SMLE Mk III rifle cost the British government £3/15/– = £), and demand outstripped supply; in late 1915 the &quot;Mk III*&quot; was introduced incorporating several changes, the most prominent of which were the deletion of the magazine cut-off mechanism, which when engaged permits the feeding and extraction of single cartridges only while keeping the cartridges in the magazine in reserve, and the long-range volley sights. The windage adjustment of the rear sight was also dispensed with, and the cocking piece was changed from a round knob to a serrated slab. Rifles with some or all of these features present are found, as the changes were implemented at different times in different factories and as stocks of parts were depleted. The magazine cut-off was reinstated after the First World War ended, and not entirely dispensed with in manufacturing until 1933; some rifles with cut-offs remained into the 1960s. One notable later use of the rifles were rifle grenade launcher conversions which involved the attachment of a removable grenade cup which would use the pressure of a blank round to launch a single modified Mills Bomb which had a launching range of about 10 to 200 yards. 

The inability of the principal manufacturers (RSAF Enfield, the Birmingham Small Arms Company Limited and London Small Arms Co. Ltd, Lithgow Arms Australia) to meet military production demands led to the development of the &quot;peddled scheme&quot;, which contracted out the production of whole rifles and rifle components to several shell companies. As a result, the production was quadrupled in the first year of the war from slightly over 100 thousands annually before the war. 

The SMLE Mk III* (renamed Rifle No.1 Mk III* in 1926) saw extensive service throughout the Second World War, especially in the North African, Italian, Pacific and Burmese theatres in the hands of British and Commonwealth forces. Australia and India retained and manufactured the SMLE Mk III* as their standard rifle during the conflict, and the rifle remained in Australian military service through the Korean War, until it was replaced by the L1A1 SLR in the late 1950s. The Lithgow Small Arms Factory finally ceased production of the SMLE Mk III* in 1953.

The Rifle Factory Ishapore at Ishapore in India produced the Mk III* in .303 British, and then the model 2A, with strength increased by heat treatment of the receiver and bolt to fire 7.62×51mm NATO ammunition, retaining the 2,000-yard rear sight as the metric conversion of distance was very close to the flatter trajectory of the new ammunition. The model 2|A1 changed the rear sight to 800 m, and was manufactured until at least the 1980s; a sporting rifle based on the Mk III* action remained in production.

The rifle became known simply as the &quot;three-oh-three&quot;.

===Pattern 1913 Enfield===

Due to the poor performance of the .303 British cartridge during the Second Boer War from 1899 to 1902, the British attempted to replace the round and the Lee–Enfield rifle that fired it. The main deficiency of the rounds at the time was that they used heavy, round-nosed bullets that had low muzzle velocities and poor ballistic performance. The 7×57mm Mauser rounds fired from the Mauser Model 1895 rifle had a higher velocity, flatter trajectory and longer range, making them superior for the open plains of South Africa. Work on a long-range replacement cartridge began in 1910 and resulted in the .276 Enfield in 1912. A new rifle based on the Mauser design was created to fire the round, called the Pattern 1913 Enfield. Although the .276 Enfield had better ballistics, trials by British Army soldiers in 1913 revealed problems including excessive recoil, muzzle flash, barrel wear and overheating. It was hoped that a propellant with a lower burning temperature would be an improvement, but the onset of the First World War in 1914 ended development before a suitable propellant could be found. Wartime demand and the improved Mk VII loading of the .303 round caused the Lee–Enfield to be retained for service. Circa 1914 the Pattern 1913 design was modified as the Pattern 1914 Enfield, mainly to use the .303 British cartridge. This weapon was mainly produced in the United States for British forces during the First World War. Upon the US entry into that war in 1917 the weapon was further redesigned for US service as the M1917 Enfield rifle, using the .30-06 Springfield cartridge.

==Inter-war period==
In 1926, the British Army changed its nomenclature; the SMLE became known as the &quot;Rifle No. 1 Mk III&quot; or &quot;III*&quot;, with the original MLE and LEC becoming obsolete along with the earlier SMLE models. Many Mk III and III* rifles were converted to .22 rimfire calibre training rifles, and designated &quot;Rifle No. 2&quot;, of varying marks. (The Pattern 1914 became the &quot;Rifle No. 3&quot;.)

==Lee–Enfield No. 1 Mk V==

The SMLE design was relatively expensive to manufacture, because of the many forging and machining operations required. In the 1920s, a series of experiments were carried out to help with these problems, resulting in design changes which reduced the number of complex parts and refining manufacturing processes. The &quot;SMLE Mk V&quot; (later &quot;Rifle No. 1 Mk V&quot;), adopted a new receiver-mounted aperture sighting system, which moved the rear sight from its former position on the barrel. The increased gap resulted in an improved sighting radius, improving sighting accuracy and the aperture improved speed of sighting over various distances. In the stowed position, a fixed distance aperture battle sight calibrated for protruded saving further precious seconds when laying the sight to a target. An alternative developed during this period was to be used on the No. 4 variant, a &quot;battle sight&quot; was developed that allowed for two set distances of 300 yards and 600 yards to be quickly deployed and was cheaper to produce than the &quot;ladder sight&quot;. The magazine cutoff was also reintroduced and an additional band was added near the muzzle for additional strength during bayonet use.

Long before the No. 4 Mk I, Britain had settled on the rear aperture sight prior to WWI, with modifications to the SMLE being tested as early as 1911, as well as later on the No. 1 Mk III pattern rifle. These unusual rifles have something of a mysterious service history, but represent a missing link in SMLE development. The primary distinguishing feature of the No. 1 Mk V is the rear aperture sight. Like the No. 1 Mk III* it lacked a volley sight and had the wire loop in place of the sling swivel at the front of the magazine well along with the simplified cocking piece. The Mk V did retain a magazine cut-off, but without a spotting hole, the piling swivel was kept attached to a forward barrel band, which was wrapped over and attached to the rear of the nose cap to reinforce the rifle for use with the standard Pattern 1907 bayonet. Other distinctive features include a nose cap screw was slotted for the width of a coin for easy removal, a safety lever on the left side of the receiver was slightly modified with a unique angular groove pattern, and the two-piece hand guard being extended from the nose cap to the receiver, omitting the barrel mounted leaf sight. The design was found to be even more complicated and expensive to manufacture than the Mk III and was not developed or issued, beyond a trial production of about 20,000 rifles between 1922 and 1924 at RSAF Enfield all of which marked with a &quot;V&quot;.

The &quot;No. 1 Mk VI&quot; also introduced a heavier &quot;floating barrel&quot; that was independent of the forearm, allowing the barrel to expand and contract without contacting the forearm and interfering with the &quot;zero&quot;, the correlation between the alignment of the barrel and the sights. The floating barrel increased the accuracy of the rifle by allowing it to vibrate freely and consistently, whereas wooden forends in contact with barrels, if not properly fitted, affected the harmonic vibrations of the barrel. The receiver-mounted rear sights and magazine cutoff were also present and 1,025 units were produced in the 1930 period.

==Rifle No. 4==

In the early 1930s, a batch of 2,500 No. 4 Mk. I rifles was made for trials. These were similar to the No. 1 Mk. VI but had a flat left side and did away with the chequering on the furniture. Observed examples are dated 1931 and 1933. Roughly 1,400 of these were converted to No. 4 MK. I (T) sniper rifles in 1941–1942 at RSAF Enfield.

By the late 1930s, the need for new rifles grew and the &quot;Rifle, No. 4 Mk I&quot; was officially adopted in 1941. The No. 4 action was similar to the No.1 Mk VI but stronger and easier to mass-produce. Unlike the SMLE, that had a nose cap, the No 4 Lee–Enfield barrel protruded from the end of the forestock. For easier machining, the charger bridge was no longer rounded.
The iron sight line was redesigned and featured a rear receiver aperture battle sight calibrated for with an additional ladder aperture sight that could be flipped up and was calibrated for in increments. This sight, like other aperture sights, proved to be faster and more accurate than the typical mid-barrel open rear sight elements sight lines offered by Mauser, previous Lee–Enfields or the Buffington battle sight of the M1903 Springfield.

The No. 4 rifle was heavier than the No. 1 Mk. III, largely due to its heavier barrel. A new bayonet was designed to go with the rifle: a spike bayonet the No. 4 bayonet, essentially a steel rod with a sharp point, nicknamed &quot;pigsticker&quot; by soldiers. Towards the end of the Second World War, a bladed bayonet was developed for the No.5 Mk.I rifle (&quot;jungle carbine&quot;). Post-war versions were made that would fit No. 4 rifles and were designated No. 7 and No. 9 blade bayonets.

During the course of the Second World War, the No. 4 rifle was further simplified for mass-production with the creation of the &quot;No. 4 Mk I*&quot; in 1942, with the bolt release catch replaced by a simpler notch on the bolt track of the rifle&#x27;s receiver. It was produced only by Small Arms Limited at Long Branch in Canada, and Stevens-Savage Firearms in the US. The No.4 rifle was primarily produced for the United Kingdom, Canada and some other Commonwealth countries including New Zealand. In 1943 it cost £7 15s (£) to produce By comparison, a Sten Mk II submachine gun cost £2 10s (£).

In the years after the Second World War, the British produced the &quot;No. 4 Mk 2&quot; (Arabic numerals replaced Roman numerals in official names in 1944) rifle, a refined and improved No. 4 rifle with the trigger hung forward from the butt collar and not from the trigger guard, beech wood stocks (with the original reinforcing strap and centre piece of wood in the rear of the forestock on the No.4 Mk I/Mk I* being removed in favour of a tie screw and nut) and brass &quot;gunmetal&quot; buttplates (during the war the British, Americans and Canadians replaced the brass buttplates on the No.4 rifles with a zinc alloy (Zamak) type to reduce costs and speed production). Near the end of the war and after, Canada made blued steel buttplates. With the introduction of the No. 4 Mk 2 rifle, the British refurbished many of their No. 4 rifles and brought them up to the same standard as the No. 4 Mk 2. The No. 4 Mk 1 rifles were renamed &quot;No. 4 Mk I/2&quot;, while No. 4 Mk I* rifles that were brought up to Mk 2 standard were renamed &quot;No. 4 Mk I/3&quot;. 

The refurbishment of the No.4 MkIs and No.4 MkI*s to the No.4 Mk2 specifications were done during the 1950s at ROF Fazakerley and BSA Shirley. The No.4 rifles refurbished at ROF Fazakerley were for British military use while No.4 rifles refurbished at BSA Shirley were for commercial sale to various British Commonwealth countries and to civilian rifle shooters in the UK and the Commonwealth.

==Rifle No. 5 Mk I—the &quot;jungle carbine&quot;==
Later in the war, the need for a shorter, lighter rifle forced the development of the &quot;Rifle, No. 5 Mk I&quot; (the &quot;jungle carbine&quot;). With a cut-down stock, a prominent flash hider, and a &quot;lightening-cut&quot; receiver machined to remove all unnecessary metal, reduced barrel length of the No. 5 was shorter and lighter. Despite a rubber butt-pad, the .303 round produced excessive recoil due to the shorter barrel. It was unsuitable for general issue and production ceased in 1947, due to an &quot;inherent fault in the design&quot;, often claimed to be a &quot;wandering zero&quot; and accuracy problems.

The No. 5 iron sight line was similar to the No. 4 Mark I and featured a rear receiver aperture battle sight calibrated for with an additional ladder aperture sight that could be flipped up and was calibrated for in increments. The No. 5 Mk I was popular with soldiers owing to its light weight, portability and shorter length than a standard Lee–Enfield rifle. The No. 5 was first issued to the British 1st Airborne Division and used during its liberation of Denmark and Norway in 1945. BSA-Shirley, Birmingham produced 81,329 rifles and ROF Fazakerley, Liverpool 169,807 rifles. It was equipped with a No. 5 Mk. I blade bayonet which had a large muzzle ring to fit over the flash hider. The No. 7 Mk. I/L bayonet, which has a rotating handle and a large ring on the cross-guard was not for the No. 5 Mk. I rifle as many collectors believe.

An Australian experimental version of the No. 5 Mk I, designated &quot;Rifle, No. 6, Mk I&quot; was also developed, using an SMLE MK III* as a starting point (as opposed to the No. 4 Mk I used to develop the No. 5 Mk I). The Australian military was not permitted to manufacture the No. 4 Mk I, because the Lithgow Small Arms Factory was producing the SMLE Mk III. The No. 6 Mk I never entered full production and examples are rare and valuable to collectors. A &quot;shortened and lightened&quot; version of the SMLE Mk III* rifle was also tested by the Australian military and a very small number were manufactured at SAF Lithgow during the course of the Second World War.

The term &quot;jungle carbine&quot; was popularised in the 1950s by the Santa Fe Arms Corporation, a U.S. importer which refurbished many surplus rifles, converting many of the No. 4 marks, in the hope of increasing sales of a rifle that had little U.S. market penetration. It was never an official military designation but British and Commonwealth troops serving in the Burmese and Pacific theatres during World War II had been known to unofficially refer to the No. 5 Mk I as a &quot;jungle carbine&quot;. The No. 4 and No. 5 rifles served in the Korean War (as did the No.1 Mk III* SMLE and sniper &quot;T&quot; variants, mostly with Australian troops).

==Lee–Enfield conversions and training models==

===Sniper rifles===

During both World Wars and the Korean War, Lee–Enfield rifles were modified for use as sniper rifles. The Australian Army modified 1,612 Lithgow SMLE No. 1 Mk. III* rifles by adding a heavy target barrel, cheek-piece, and a World War I era Pattern 1918 telescope, creating the &quot;SMLE No. 1 Mk. III* (HT)&quot;. (HT standing for &quot;heavy barrel, telescopic sight), which saw service in the Second World War, Korea, and Malaya and was used for sniper training through to the late 1970s.

During the Second World War, standard No. 4 rifles, selected for their accuracy during factory tests, were modified by the addition of a wooden cheek rising-piece, and telescopic sight mounts designed to accept a No. 32 3.5× telescopic sight. The telescopic sight had a field of view of 8 degrees 20 minutes and featured a bullet drop compensation range drum on top of the sight graduated in increments from 0 to . Side adjustments in 2 MOA increments were made by the drum mounted at the side of the sight. These rifles were designated as the No. 4 Mk. I (T). The accuracy requirement was ability to place seven of seven shots in a circle at and six of seven shots in a circle at . The wooden cheek-piece was attached with two screws. The rear &quot;battle sight&quot; was ground off to make room to attach the No. 32 telescope sight to the left side of the receiver. Each No. 32 and its bracket (mount) were matched and serial numbered to a specific rifle.

In British service, the No. 32 telescope progressed through three marks with the Mk. I introduced in 1942, the Mk. II in 1943 which offered side adjustments in finer 1 MOA increments, and finally the Mk. III (Mk. 3) in 1944 which had an improved field of view of 8 degrees 30 minutes. A transitional model the No. 32 Mk. 2/1 was also made. The Canadian scopes made by Research Enterprises Limited and were prefixed with a letter &quot;C&quot; and went through C No. 32 Mk. I, Mk. I A (a transitional model), Mk. II and Mk. 3. Many Mk. 3s and Mk. 2/1s (Mk. 2s Modified to Mk. 3 standard) were later modified for use with the 7.62×51mm NATO L42A1 sniper rifle. They were then known by the designation &quot;Telescope Straight, Sighting L1A1&quot;.

Initial production was 1,403 conversions of 1931–1933 troop trials No. 4 Mk. I rifles at RSAF Enfield and a few others including Stevens-Savage No. 4s. These were converted in late 1941 and into the later part of 1942. Then, the work was assigned to Holland &amp; Holland, the famous British sporting gun manufacturers, which converted about 23,000 No. 4 Mk. I (T) and No. 4 Mk. I* (T) sniper rifles. The Holland &amp; Holland conversions usually have the contractor code &quot;S51&quot; on the underside of the buttstock. BSA Shirley undertook 100 conversions to .22&quot;. James Purdey and Sons fitted special buttstocks later in the war. About 3,000 rifles, mostly Stevens-Savage, appear to have been partially converted by Holland &amp; Holland but never received brackets, scopes of the final &quot;T&quot; mark. Canada converted about 1,588 rifles at Small Arms Limited (to the end of 1945) and, in 1946, at Canadian Arsenals Limited. Both were located at Long Branch, Ontario. Most of the Canadian made No.4 Mk.I* (T) sniper equipments went into British service. The No.4 (T) rifles were extensively employed in various conflicts until the late 1960s.

The British military switched over to the 7.62×51mm NATO round in the 1950s; starting in 1970, over 1,000 of the No. 4 Mk I (T) and No. 4 Mk. I* (T) sniper rifles were converted to this new calibre and designated &quot;L42A1&quot;. The L42A1 sniper rifle continued as the British Army&#x27;s standard sniper weapon being phased out by 1993, and replaced by Accuracy International&#x27;s L96.

===.22 training rifles===

Numbers of Lee–Enfield rifles were converted to .22 calibre training rifles, in order to teach cadets and new recruits the various aspects of shooting, firearms safety, and marksmanship at a markedly reduced cost per round. Initially, rifles were converted from obsolete magazine Lee–Metford and magazine Lee–Enfield rifles but from the First World War onwards SMLE rifles were used instead. These were known as &quot;.22 Pattern 1914 short rifles&quot; during The First World War and &quot;Rifle, No. 2 Mk. IV&quot; from 1921 onwards. They were generally single-shot affairs, originally using Morris tubes chambered for the cheap .22L cartridge and some larger types, circa 1907. Some were later modified with special adaptors to enable magazine loading. In 1914, Enfield produced complete .22 barrels and bolts specifically for converting .303 units, and these soon became the most common conversion. A five-round .22 cal Parker-Hiscock magazine was also developed and in service for a relatively short period during the later period of the First World War, but was subsequently withdrawn from issue due to reliability problems with its quite complicated loading and feeding mechanisms. No. 2 Mk. IV rifles are externally identical to .303 calibre SMLE Mk III* rifles, the only difference being the .22 calibre barrel, empty magazine case, bolthead and extractor which have been modified to fire .22 calibre rimfire cartridges.

After the Second World War, the &quot;Rifle, No. 7&quot;, &quot;Rifle, No. 8&quot; and &quot;Rifle, No. 9&quot;, all .22 rimfire trainers and target rifles based on the Lee action, were adopted or in use with cadet units and target shooters throughout the Commonwealth, the No.8 as of 2017 has been replaced among cadet forces due to obsolescence.

In Britain, a .22RF version of the No.5 rifle was prototyped by BSA and trialled with a view to it becoming the British Service training rifle when the .303&quot; CF No.5 was initially mooted as being a potential replacement for the No.4 rifle.

The &quot;C No.7 22&quot; MK.I rifle&quot; is a .22 single-shot, manually fed, training version of the No.4 Mk I* rifle manufactured at Long Branch. Production of this model was 1944–1946 and a few in 1950 to 1953.

===Muskets and shotguns===
Conversion of rifles to smoothbore guns was carried out in several locations, at various times, for varying reasons.

SAF Lithgow, in Australia, produced shotguns based on the MkIII action under the &quot;Slazenger&quot; name, chambering the common commercial .410 shotgun shell. Commercial gunsmiths in Australia and Britain converted both MkIII and No. 4 rifles to .410 shotguns. These conversions were prompted by firearms legislation that made possession of a rifle chambered in a military cartridge both difficult and expensive. Smoothbore shotguns could be legally held with far less trouble.

RFI, in India, converted a large number of MkIII rifles to single-shot muskets, chambered for the .410 Indian musket cartridge. These conversions were for issue to police and prison guards, to provide a firearm with a much-reduced power and range in comparison to the .303 cartridge. A further likely consideration was the difficulty of obtaining replacement ammunition in the event of the rifle&#x27;s theft or the carrier&#x27;s desertion.

While British and Australian conversions were to the standard commercially available .410 shotgun cartridge (though of varying chamber lengths) the Indian conversions have been the source of considerable confusion. The Indian conversions were originally chambered for the .410 Indian musket cartridge, which is based on the .303 British cartridge, and will not chamber the common .410 shotgun cartridge. Many of these muskets were rechambered, after being sold as surplus, and can now be used with commercially available ammunition. Unmodified muskets require handloading of ammunition, as the .410 Indian Musket cartridge was not commercially distributed and does not appear to have been manufactured since the 1950s.

Numerous attempts have been made to convert the various single-shot .410 shotgun models to a bolt-action repeating model by removing the wooden magazine plug and replacing it with a standard 10-round SMLE magazine. None of these is known to have been successful, though some owners have adapted three-round magazines for Savage and Stevens shotguns to function in a converted SMLE shotgun, or even placing such a magazine inside a gutted SMLE magazine.

===Civilian conversions and variants===
From the late 1940s, legislation in New South Wales, Australia, heavily restricted .303 British calibre (and other &quot;military calibre&quot;) rifles, so large numbers of SMLEs were converted to &quot;wildcat&quot; calibres such as .303/25, .303/22, .303/270 and the popular 7.7×54mm round. 303/25 calibre sporterised SMLEs are very common in Australia today, although ammunition for them has been very scarce since the 1980s. The restrictions placed on &quot;military calibre&quot; rifles in New South Wales were lifted in 1975, and many people who had converted their Lee–Enfields to the &quot;wildcat&quot; rounds converted their rifles back to .303 British. Post-Second World War, SAF Lithgow converted a number of SMLE rifles to commercial sporting rifles- notably the .22 Hornet model- under the &quot;Slazenger&quot; brand.

In the early 1950s Essential Agencies Ltd. (E.A.L.), of Toronto, Ontario, produced a run of several thousand survival rifles based on the No. 4 action, but lightened and shortened, chambered in .303 British. Serial numbers below 6000 were for civilian sale, serial numbers 6000 and higher were built under contract to the Canadian government. The Royal Canadian Air Force also used these as a survival rifle in the remote parts of Canada.

===L59A1 Drill Rifle===

The L59A1 was a conversion of the No. 4 rifle (all marks) to a drill purpose rifle that was incapable of being restored to a firing configuration. It was introduced in service in the 1970s. A conversion specification of No. 1 rifles to L59A2 drill purpose was also prepared but was abandoned due to the greater difficulty of machining involved and the negligible numbers still in the hands of cadet units.

The L59A1 arose from British government concerns over the vulnerability of the Army Cadet Force and school Combined Cadet Forces&#x27; (CCF) stocks of small arms to theft by terrorists, in particular the Irish Republican Army following raids on CCF armouries in the 1950s and 1960s. Previous conversions to drill purpose (DP) of otherwise serviceable rifles were not considered to be sufficiently incapable of restoration to fireable state and were a potential source of reconversion spares.

L59A1 drill rifles were rendered incapable of being fired, and of being restored to a fireable form, by extensive modifications that included the welding of the barrel to the receiver, modifications to the receiver that removed the supporting structures for the bolt&#x27;s locking lugs and blocking the installation of an unaltered bolt, the removal of the striker&#x27;s tip, the blocking of the striker&#x27;s hole in the bolt head and the removal of most of the bolt body&#x27;s locking lugs. Most bolts were copper plated for identification. A plug was welded in place forward of the chamber, and a window was cut in the side of the barrel. The stock and fore end were marked with broad white painted bands (often with red bands, and also rarely seen blue bands or stripes) and the letters &quot;DP&quot; for easy identification.

==Special service Lee–Enfields: Commando and automatic models==

===De Lisle commando carbine===
The commando units of the British military requested a suppressed rifle for killing sentries, guard dogs and other clandestine operational uses during the Second World War. The resulting weapon, designed by Godfray de Lisle, was effectively an SMLE Mk III* receiver redesigned to take a .45 ACP cartridge and associated magazine, with a barrel from a Thompson submachine gun and an integrated suppressor. It was produced in very limited numbers and an experimental folding stock version was made.

===Ekins automatic rifle===
The Ekins automatic rifle was one of the numerous attempts to convert a Lee–Enfield SMLE to an automatic rifle. Similar developments were the South African Rieder automatic rifle and the New Zealand and Australian Charlton automatic rifles.

===Howard Francis carbine===
The Howard Francis self-loading carbine was a conversion of a No. 1 Mk III to the 7.63×25mm Mauser pistol cartridge. It fired in semi-automatic only and suffered some feeding and extraction problems and, despite meeting accuracy and soundness of design concept, never made it past the prototype stage.

===Howell automatic rifle===

The Howell automatic rifle was the first attempt to convert the Lee–Enfield SMLE into a semi-automatic rifle. The weapon was reliable but unergonomic for the user as the force of the recoiling bolt interfered with handling.

===Rieder automatic rifle===

The Rieder automatic rifle was an automatic (full automatic only) Lee–Enfield SMLE rifle of South African origin. The Rieder device could be installed straight away without the use of tools.

=== Turner automatic conversion ===
Long-stroke piston tilting bolt semi automatic conversion developed by Turner Russel, proposed for the Canadian government in 1941 but was rejected.

==Conversion to 7.62×51mm NATO==
In 1954, the War Office adopted the 7.62×51mm NATO-calibre L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle for use by frontline infantry units. While it was intended that rear-echelon and reserve units would continue to use the Lee-Enfield No. 4 in order to avoid the expense of rearming those units with the L1A1 as well, Britain&#x27;s commitments as a NATO member meant that the .303in cartridge could no longer be used; thus, the early 1960s saw the approval of a plan to convert the Lee–Enfield No. 4 to the newer NATO cartridge. Rifles that were thus converted were re-designated as the &quot;L8&quot; series of rifles and refitted with 7.62×51mm NATO barrels, new bolt faces and extractor claws, new rear sights, and 7.62×51mm NATO magazines. The appearance of the L8 series rifles was no different from the original No. 4 rifles, except for the new barrel (which still retained the original No. 4 rifle bayonet lugs) and magazine. The L8 series of rifles consisted of &quot;L8A1&quot; rifles (converted No. 4 Mk2 rifles), &quot;L8A1 (T)&quot; rifles (converted No .4 Mk 1 (T) rifles), &quot;L8A2&quot; rifles (converted No. 4 Mk1/2 rifles), &quot;L8A3&quot; rifles (converted No. 4 Mk1/3 rifles), &quot;L8A4&quot; rifles (converted No. 4 Mk1 rifles), and &quot;L8A5&quot; rifles (converted No. 4 Mk1* rifles).

The results of the trials that were conducted on the L8 series rifles were mixed; the L8A1 (T) rifles fired test groups that bore no relation to those fired while they were still No. 4 Mk 1 (T) rifles nor was there any consistent accuracy between those rifles that had been chosen for conversion, while the regular L8 rifles gave a better performance but with little or no improvement over .303in weapons; consequently, the conversion programme was abandoned and what was now known as the Ministry of Defence was forced to expand the issue of L1A1 rifles to non-frontline units. However, experience from the programme, including the magazine design, was used to aid the later L42A1 conversion programme.

In the late 1960s, RSAF Enfield entered the commercial market by producing No. 4-based 7.62×51mm rifles for sale. The products were marketed under alliterative names e.g. Enfield Envoy, a rifle intended for civilian competition target shooting and Enfield Enforcer, a rifle fitted with a Pecar telescopic sight to suit the requirements of police firearms teams.

Sterling Armaments of Dagenham, Essex, produced a conversion kit comprising a new 7.62 mm barrel, magazine, extractor and ejector for commercial sale. The main difference between the two conversions was in the cartridge ejection arrangement; the Enfield magazine carried a hardened steel projection that struck the rim of the extracted case to eject it, the Sterling system employed a spring-loaded plunger inserted into the receiver wall.

===Ishapore 2A/2A1===


At some point just after the Sino-Indian War of 1962, the Rifle Factory Ishapore in India began producing a new type of rifle known as the &quot;Rifle 7.62 mm 2A&quot;, which was based on the SMLE Mk III* and was slightly redesigned to use the 7.62×51mm NATO round. Externally the new rifle is very similar to the classic Mk III*, with the exception of the buttplate (the buttplate from the 1A SLR is fitted) and magazine, which is more &quot;square&quot; than the SMLE magazine, and usually carries twelve rounds instead of ten, although a number of 2A1s have been noted with 10-round magazines.

Ishapore 2A and Ishapore 2A1 receivers are made with improved (EN) steel (to handle the increased pressures of the 7.62×51mm round) and the extractor is redesigned to suit the rimless cartridge. From 1965 to 1975 (when production is believed to have been discontinued), the sight ranging graduations were changed from 2,000 to 800, and the rifle re-designated &quot;Rifle 7.62 mm 2A1&quot;. The original rear sight arm was found to be suitable for the ballistics of the 7.62×51mm, which is around 10% more powerful and equates to a flatter trajectory than that of the .303 British MkVII ammunition, so it was a simple matter to think of the &quot;2,000&quot; as representing metres rather than yards. It was then decided that the limit of the effective range was a more realistic proposition at 800 m.

The Ishapore 2A and 2A1 rifles are often incorrectly described as &quot;.308 conversions&quot;. The 2A/2A1 rifles are not conversions of .303 calibre SMLE Mk III* rifles. Rather, they are newly manufactured firearms and are not technically chambered for commercial .308 Winchester ammunition. However, many 2A/2A1 owners shoot such ammunition in their rifles with no problems, although some factory loaded .308 Winchester cartridges may appear to generate higher pressures than 7.62×51mm NATO, even though the rounds are otherwise interchangeable – this is due to the different systems of pressure measurement used for NATO and commercial cartridges.

== Manufacturers ==
In total, over 16 million Lee–Enfields had been produced in several factories on different continents when production in Britain ended in 1956 at the Royal Ordnance Factory ROF Fazakerley in Liverpool, after that factory had been plagued with industrial unrest. The machinery from ROF Fazakerley was sold to Pakistan Ordnance Factories (POF) in Rawalpindi where production and repair of the No.4 Mk I started from 1952 till 1957 and then production changed over to No.4 Mk II from 1957. 

Also contributing to the total was the Rifle Factory Ishapore (RFI) at Ishapore in India, which continued to produce the SMLE in both .303 and 7.62×51mm NATO until the 1980s, and is still manufacturing a sporting rifle based on the SMLE Mk III action, chambered for a .315 calibre cartridge, the Birmingham Small Arms Company factory at Shirley near Birmingham, and SAF Lithgow in Australia, who finally discontinued production of the SMLE Mk III* with a final &#x27;machinery proving&#x27; batch of 1000 rifles in early 1956, using 1953-dated receivers. During the First World War alone, 3.8 million SMLE rifles were produced in the UK by RSAF Enfield, BSA, and LSA.

===List of manufacturers===
&quot;SSA&quot; and &quot;NRF&quot; markings are sometimes encountered on First World War-dated SMLE Mk III* rifles. These stand for &quot;Standard Small Arms&quot; and &quot;National Rifle Factory&quot;, respectively. Rifles so marked were assembled using parts from various other manufacturers, as part of a scheme during the First World War to boost rifle production in the UK. Only SMLE Mk III* rifles are known to have been assembled under this program.
GRI stands for &quot;Georgius Rex, Imperator&quot; (Latin for &#x27;King George, Emperor (of India)&#x27;, denoting a rifle made during the British Raj. RFI stands for &quot;Rifle Factory, Ishapore&quot;, denoting a rifle made after the Partition of India in 1947.

Second World War UK production rifles had manufacturer codes for security reasons. For example, BSA Shirley is denoted by M47C, ROF(M) is often simply stamped &quot;M&quot;, and BSA is simply stamped &quot;B&quot;.
Savage-made Lee–Enfield No. 4 Mk I and No. 4 Mk I* rifles are all stamped &quot;US property&quot;. They were supplied to the UK under the Lend-Lease programme during the Second World War. No Savage Lee–Enfields were ever issued to the US military; the markings existed solely to maintain the pretense that American equipment was being lent to the UK rather than permanently sold to them.

====Australian International Arms No. 4 Mk IV====
The Brisbane-based Australian International Arms also manufactured a modern reproduction of the No. 4 Mk II rifle, which they marketed as the &quot;AIA No. 4 Mk IV&quot;. The rifles were manufactured by parts outsourcing and were assembled and finished in Australia, chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO and fed from modified M14 magazines. The No. 4 Mk IV was designed with the modern shooter in mind, and has the ability to mount a telescopic sight without drilling and tapping the receiver. 

AIA also offered the &quot;AIA M10-A1&quot; rifle, a jungle carbine-styled version chambered in 7.62×39mm Russian, which uses AK-47 magazines. Magazine supply and importation (M14 and AK 10 single stack mag) whilst legal in Australia, has been spasmodically curtailed by Australian Federal Customs (for more information, see Gun politics in Australia). It is possible to obtain a 10-round (the maximum allowed by law) M14 magazines for the M10-B2 match rifles in particular, provided an import permit from the appropriate licensing services division can be obtained in some states, yet Australian Federal Customs may still refuse importation on no valid grounds.

===Khyber Pass copies===
A number of British Service Rifles, predominantly the Martini–Henry and Martini–Enfield, but also the various Lee–Enfield rifles, have been produced by small manufacturers in the Khyber Pass region of the Pakistani-Afghan border.

&quot;Khyber Pass copies&quot;, as they are known, tend to be copied exactly from a &quot;master&quot; rifle, which may itself be a Khyber Pass copy, markings and all, which is why it&#x27;s not uncommon to see Khyber Pass rifles with the &quot;N&quot; in &quot;Enfield&quot; reversed, amongst other things.

The quality on such rifles varies from &quot;as good as a factory-produced example&quot; to &quot;dangerously unsafe&quot;, tending towards the latter end of the scale. Khyber Pass copy rifles cannot generally stand up to the pressures generated by modern commercial ammunition, and are generally considered unsafe to fire under any circumstances.

Khyber Pass copies can be recognised by a number of factors, notably:
* Spelling errors in the markings; as noted the most common of which is a reversed &quot;N&quot; in &quot;Enfield&quot;)
* V.R. (Victoria Regina) cyphers dated after 1901; Queen Victoria died in 1901, so any rifles made after 1901 should be stamped &quot;E.R&quot; (&quot;Edwardius Rex&quot;—King Edward VII or King Edward VIII) or &quot;G.R&quot; (&quot;Georgius Rex&quot;—King George V or King George VI).
* Generally inferior workmanship, including weak or soft metal, poorly finished wood, and badly struck markings.

===Armalon===
British company Armalon Ltd developed a number of rifles based on the Lee Enfield No. 4. The PC rifle is a carbine in pistol and revolver calibres, the AL42 is a 5.56 mm rifle and the AL30C, a carbine in .30 carbine.

==Contemporary service==

The Lee–Enfield family of rifles is the second oldest bolt-action rifle design still in official service, after the Mosin–Nagant. Lee–Enfield rifles are used by reserve forces and police forces in many Commonwealth countries, including Malawi. In Canada the .303 and .22 models were being phased out between 2016 and 2019. The Canadian Rangers had been using the .303 model for over 70 years but switched to the Colt Canada C19 due to increasing lack of spare parts. The Indian Army phased them out in 1990–92, replacing them with AKM-type rifles (see Indo-Russia Rifles). Indian police officers carrying SMLE Mk III* and Ishapore 2A1 rifles were a familiar sight throughout railway stations in India after Mumbai train bombings of 2006 and the 2008 Mumbai attacks. They are also still seen in the hands of Pakistani and Bangladeshi second-line police units. However, the Lee–Enfield was mainly replaced in main-line service in the Pakistani Police in the mid-1980s by the AK 47, in response to increasing proliferation of the Kalashnikov in the black market and civilian use. In Jordan, the Lee–Enfield was in use with the police and gendarmerie until 1971, and with the armed forces until 1965. In Iraq and Egypt, the Lee–Enfield was replaced by the Kalashnikov as the standard-issue rifle in the armed forces by the late 1950s, and in police forces by the late 1970s.
In the UK, the single-shot .22 calibre Rifle No. 8 is in regular use with UK Cadet Forces as a light target rifle. Enfields continue to be used as drill weapons by the National Ceremonial Guard of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) as well as the Australian Defence Force Cadets.

Many Afghans resisting the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan were armed with Lee–Enfields. The CIA&#x27;s Operation Cyclone provided hundreds of thousands of Enfields to the Afghan mujahideen, funneling them through Pakistan&#x27;s ISI. CIA officer Gust Avrakotos later arranged for the Egyptian Ministry of Defence to set up production lines of Enfield .303 ammunition specifically for the conflict. Later on when Avrakotos asked Michael Vickers to revamp their strategy, he stopped the Enfield system and, with the large amounts of money available thanks to Charlie Wilson, replaced them with a mix of modern weapons like AK-47s and mortars.
Khyber Pass Copies patterned after the Lee–Enfield are still manufactured in the Khyber Pass region, as bolt-action rifles remain effective weapons in desert and mountain environments where long-range accuracy is more important than rate of fire. Lee–Enfield rifles are still popular in the region, despite the presence and ready availability of more modern weapons such as the SKS-45, the AKM, the Chinese Type 56 assault rifle, and the AK-74. , Lee–Enfield rifles are still being used by the Taliban.

During the recent civil war in Nepal, the government troops were issued Lee–Enfield rifles to fight the Maoist rebels, and the Maoists were also armed with SMLE rifles, amongst other weapons. Nepalese Police constables may also be usually seen equipped with SMLE rifles. Lee–Enfield rifles have also been seen in the hands of both the Naxalites and the Indian police in the ongoing Maoist insurgency in rural India.

Police forces in both the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu continue to operate and maintain stocks of No.4 rifles. The Tongan security forces also retain a substantial number of No.4 rifles donated from New Zealand&#x27;s reserve stocks.

Lee Enfield rifles are used by the Jamaica Constabulary force for training recruits during field-craft exercises and drills.

==Civilian use==
Lee–Enfields are very popular as hunting rifles and target shooting rifles. Many surplus Lee–Enfield rifles were sold in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States after the Second World War, and a fair number have been &#x27;sporterised&#x27;, having had the front furniture reduced or removed and a scope fitted so that they resemble a bolt-action sporting rifle. Top-notch accuracy is difficult to achieve with the Lee–Enfield design, as it was intended to be a battle rifle rather than a sharpshooter&#x27;s weapon, and thus the Enfield is nowadays overshadowed by derivatives of Paul Mauser&#x27;s design as a target shooting arm. They did, however, continue to be used at Bisley up into the 1970s with some success, and continue to perform extremely well at Military Service Rifle Competitions throughout the world.

Many people still hunt with as-issued Lee–Enfield rifles, with commercial .303 British ammunition proving especially effective on medium-sized game. Soft-point .303 ammunition is widely available for hunting purposes, though the Mark 7 military cartridge design often proves adequate because its tail-heavy design makes the bullet yaw violently and deform after hitting the target.

The Lee–Enfield rifle is a popular gun for historic rifle enthusiasts and those who find the 10-round magazine, loading by charger clips, and the rapid bolt-action useful for Practical Rifle events. Since formation in 1998, organisations such as the Lee Enfield Rifle Association have assisted in not just preserving rifles in shooting condition (many Lee–Enfields are being deactivated and sold as &quot;wall-hangers&quot; to collectors who do not hold a Firearms Licence in countries where they are required), but holding events and competitions. Lee–Enfields are also popular with competitors in service rifle competitions in many Commonwealth countries.

The Lee–Enfield series is very popular for service rifle shooting competitions in the UK and Australia due to the prohibitions on the legal ownership of semi-automatic centrefire rifles in Great Britain and restrictions on the legal ownership of semi-automatic centrefire rifles in Australia. (For more information see Gun politics in the United Kingdom and Gun politics in Australia.)

Rhineland Arms produces .45 ACP conversion kits for the Lee–Enfield action using M1911 pistol magazines.

The Lee–Speed Sporter was a higher quality British made version of the Lee–Enfield.

Rifle Factory Ishapore of India still manufactures a sporting/hunting rifle chambered in .315 with a Lee–Enfield action.

<doc id="144485" wikidata="Q7805271" url="?curid=144485" title="Time and frequency transfer">
<text>Time and frequency transfer is a scheme where multiple sites share a precise reference time or frequency. 
The technique is commonly used for creating and distributing standard time scales such as International Atomic Time (TAI).
Time transfer solves problems such as astronomical observatories correlating observed flashes or other phenomena with each other, as well as cell phone towers coordinating handoffs as a phone moves from one cell to another.

Multiple techniques have been developed, often transferring reference clock synchronization from one point to another, often over long distances. Accuracy approaching one nanosecond worldwide is economically practical for many applications. Radio-based navigation systems are frequently used as time transfer systems.

In some cases, multiple measurements are made over a period of time, and exact time synchronization is determined retrospectively. In particular, time synchronization has been accomplished by using pairs of radio telescopes to listen to a pulsar, with the time transfer accomplished by comparing time offsets of the received pulsar signal.

==Examples==
Examples of time and frequency transfer techniques include:

*Simultaneous observation methods:
** Simultaneous carrier phase observation of GNSS signals (such as GPS)
** Time transfer by simultaneous observation of TV transmissions
** Time transfer by simultaneous observation of radio astronomy signals
*Two-way transfer methods:
** Two-way satellite time and frequency transfer
*Network methods:
** Network Time Protocol
** Precision Time Protocol

==One-way==
In a one-way time transfer system, one end transmits its current time over some communication channel to one or more receivers. The receivers will, at reception, decode the message, and either just report the time, or adjust a local clock which can provide hold-over time reports in between the reception of messages. The advantage of one-way systems is that they can be technically simple and serve many receivers, as the transmitter is unaware of the receivers.

The principal drawback of the one-way time transfer system is that propagation delays of the communication channel remain uncompensated except in some advanced systems. Examples of a one-way time transfer system are the clock on a church or town building and the ringing of their time-indication bells; time balls, radio clock signals such as LORAN, DCF77 and MSF; and finally the Global Positioning System which uses multiple one-way time transfers from different satellites, with positional information and other advanced means of delay compensations to allow receiver compensation of time and position information in real time.

==Two-way==
In a two-way time transfer system, the two peers will both transmit and receive each other&#x27;s messages, thus performing two one-way time transfers to determine the difference between the remote clock and the local clock. The sum of these time differences is the round-trip delay between the two nodes. It is often assumed that this delay is evenly distributed between the directions between the peers. Under this assumption, half the round-trip delay is the propagation delay to be compensated. A drawback is that the two-way propagation delay must be measured and used to calculate a delay correction. That function can be implemented in the reference source, in which case the source capacity limits the number of clients that can be served, or by software in each client. The NIST provides a time reference service to computer users on the Internet, based on Java applets loaded by each client. The two-way satellite time and frequency transfer (TWSTFT) system being used in comparison among some time laboratories uses a satellite for a common link between the laboratories. The Network Time Protocol uses packet-based messages over an IP network.

Historically, the telegraphic determination of longitude was an important way to connect two points. It could be used one-way or two-way, with each observatory potentially correcting the other&#x27;s time or position. Telegraphy methods of the 19th century established many of the same techniques used in modern times, including round-trip time delay calculations and time synchronization in the 15 to 25 millisecond range.

==Common view==
The time difference between two clocks may be determined by simultaneously comparing each clock to a common reference signal that may be received at both sites. As long as both end stations receive the same satellite signal at the same time, the accuracy of the signal source is not important. The nature of the received signal is not important, although widely available timing and navigation systems such as GPS or LORAN are convenient.

The accuracy of time transferred in this way is typically 1–10 ns.

==GNSS==
Since the advent of GPS and other satellite navigation systems, highly precise, yet affordable timing is available from many commercial GNSS receivers. Its initial system design expected general timing precision better than 340 nanoseconds using low-grade &quot;coarse mode&quot; and 200 ns in precision mode. A GPS receiver functions by precisely measuring the transit time of signals received from several satellites. These distances combined geometrically with precise orbital information identify the location of the receiver. Precise timing is fundamental to an accurate GPS location. The time from an atomic clock onboard each satellite is encoded into the radio signal; the receiver determines how much later it received the signal than it was sent. To do this, a local clock is corrected to the GPS atomic clock time by solving for three dimensions and time based on four or more satellite signals. Improvements in algorithms lead many modern low-cost GPS receivers to achieve better than 10-meter accuracy, which implies a timing accuracy of about 30 ns. GPS-based laboratory time references routinely achieve 10 ns precision.

<text>Sir Edwin Arnold (10 June 1832 – 24 March 1904) was an English poet and journalist. He is best known for his 1879 work, &quot;The Light of Asia&quot;.

Born in Gravesend, Kent, Arnold&#x27;s early education at King&#x27;s School, Rochester, and later at King&#x27;s College London and University College, Oxford, laid the groundwork for his career. Initially a schoolmaster and later the Principal of the Deccan College in India, Arnold&#x27;s experiences abroad influenced his literary endeavors. He became associated with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, serving as its editor-in-chief, and facilitated H. M. Stanley&#x27;s exploration of Africa. Arnold&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Light of Asia&quot;, an exploration of Buddhist philosophy through the life of Prince Gautama, earned him widespread acclaim. Despite the success of this work, his later attempts to emulate its triumph with &quot;The Light of the World&quot; centered on Jesus Christ, faced mixed reception. Arnold&#x27;s personal life was marked by multiple marriages, including one to a Japanese woman, reflecting his deep engagement with Japanese culture as evidenced in his writings. An advocate for vegetarianism, he played a significant role in the West London Food Reform Society alongside figures like Mahatma Gandhi. Arnold died at the age of 77, in London, in 1904.

==Biography==
Arnold was born at Gravesend, Kent, the second son of a Sussex magistrate, Robert Coles Arnold. He grew up at Southchurch Wick, a farm in Southchurch, Essex, and was educated at King&#x27;s School, Rochester; King&#x27;s College London; and University College, Oxford, where he won the Newdigate prize for poetry on the subject of &quot;The Feast of Belshazzar&quot; in 1852. He became a schoolmaster, at King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham, and in 1856 went to India as Principal of the Deccan College at Poona, a post which he held for seven years, which includes a period during the mutiny of 1857, when he was able to render services for which he was publicly thanked by Lord Elphinstone in the Bombay Council. Here he received the bias towards, and gathered material for, his future works.

Returning to England in 1861 he worked as a journalist on the staff of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, a newspaper with which he continued to be associated as editor for more than forty years, and of which he later became editor-in-chief. It was he who, on behalf of the proprietors of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in conjunction with the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, arranged the journey of H. M. Stanley to Africa to discover the course of the Congo River, and Stanley named after him a mountain to the north-east of Albert Edward Nyanza.

Arnold must also be credited with the first idea of a great trunk line traversing the entire African continent, for in 1874 he first employed the phrase &quot;Cape to Cairo railway&quot; subsequently popularised by Cecil Rhodes.

It was, however, as a poet that he was best known to his contemporaries. The literary task which he set before him was the interpretation in English verse of the life and philosophy of the East. His chief work with this object is &quot;The Light of Asia&quot;, or &quot;The Great Renunciation&quot;, a poem of eight books in blank verse which was translated into various languages such as Hindi (tr. by Acharya Ram Chandra Shukla).

In it, in Arnold&#x27;s own words, he attempted &#x27;by the medium of an imaginary Buddhist votary to depict the life and character and indicate the philosophy of that noble hero and reformer, Prince Gautama of India, founder of Buddhism&#x27;. It appeared in 1879 and was an immediate success, going through numerous editions in England and America, though its permanent place in literature is quite uncertain. It is an Indian epic, dealing with the life and teaching of the Buddha. The poem was subjected to two lines of criticism: it was held by Oriental scholars to give a false impression of Buddhist doctrine; while, on the other, the suggested analogy between Sakyamuni and Jesus offended the taste of some devout Christians.

The latter criticism probably suggested to Arnold the idea of attempting a second narrative poem of which the central figure should be Jesus, the founder of Christianity, as the founder of Buddhism had been that of the first. But though &quot;The Light of the World&quot; (1891), in which this took shape, had considerable poetic merit, it lacked the novelty of theme and setting which had given the earlier poem much of its attractiveness; and it failed to repeat the success gained by &quot;The Light of Asia&quot;. Arnold&#x27;s other principal volumes of poetry were &quot;Indian Song of Songs&quot; (1875), &quot;Pearls of the Faith&quot; (1883), &quot;The Song Celestial&quot; (1885), &quot;With Sa&#x27;di in the Garden&quot; (1888), &quot;Potiphar&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1892), &quot;Adzuma&quot;, or &quot;The Japanese Wife&quot; (1893), and &quot;Indian Poetry&quot; (1904).

In &quot;The Song Celestial&quot; Sir Edwin produced a well-known poetic rendering of the sacred Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita.

==Personal life==

Sir Edwin was married three times. His first wife was Katherine Elizabeth Biddulph, of London, who died in 1864. Next he married Jennie Channing of Boston, who died in 1889. In his later years Arnold resided for some time in Japan, and his third wife, Tama Kurokawa, was Japanese. In &quot;Seas and Lands&quot; (1891) and &quot;Japonica&quot; (1891) he gives an interesting study of Japanese life. He was appointed CSI on the occasion of the proclamation of Queen Victoria as Empress of India in 1877, and was knighted in 1888 (as KCIE). He was also honoured with decorations by the rulers of Japan, Persia, Turkey and Siam. One of his six children was the novelist Edwin Lester Arnold, born in 1857.

He was a founder member, together with Anagarika Dharmapala, of the Mahabodhi Society of India and was a close associate of Weligama Sri Sumangala. A blue plaque unveiled in 1931 commemorates Arnold at 31 Bolton Gardens in South Kensington.

Arnold was a vegetarian. He was vice-president of the West London Food Reform Society, a vegetarian group based in Bayswater, founded in 1891, with Josiah Oldfield as president and Mahatma Gandhi as secretary. The Society was short-lived and dissolved as soon as Gandhi left Bayswater. He also served as vice-president of the London Vegetarian Society, after being invited by Gandhi.

<doc id="144496" wikidata="Q1285498" url="?curid=144496" title="Hormuzd Rassam">
<text>Hormuzd Rassam (; ; 182616 September 1910) was an Assyriologist and author. He is known for making a number of important archaeological discoveries from 1877 to 1882, including the clay tablets that contained the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh,&quot; the world&#x27;s oldest notable literature. He is widely believed to be the first-known Middle Eastern and Assyrian archaeologist from the Ottoman empire. He emigrated to the United Kingdom, where he was naturalized as a British citizen, settling in Brighton. He represented the government as a diplomat, helping to free British diplomats from captivity in Ethiopia.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Hormuzd Rassam was an ethnic Assyrian, born in Mosul in Upper Mesopotamia (now modern northern Iraq), then part of the Ottoman Empire. His father was a member of the Chaldean Catholic Church where his grandfather, Anton Rassam, from Mosul, was the church&#x27;s archdeacon. His mother Theresa was a daughter of Isaak Halabee of Aleppo, also then within the Ottoman Empire. Hormuzd&#x27;s brother was British Vice-Consul in Mosul, which was how he obtained his start with Layard.

===Early archaeological career===
At the age of 20 in 1846, Rassam was hired by British archaeologist Austen Henry Layard as a paymaster at Nimrud, a nearby ancient Assyrian excavation site. Layard, who was in Mosul on his first expedition (1845–47), was impressed by the hardworking Rassam and took him under his wing; they would remain friends for life. Layard provided an opportunity for Rassam to travel to England and study at Magdalen College, Oxford. He studied there for 18 months before accompanying Layard on his second expedition to Iraq (1849–51).

Layard left archeology to begin a political career. Rassam continued field work (1852–54) at Nimrud and Nineveh, where he made a number of important and independent discoveries. These included the clay tablets that would later be deciphered by George Smith as the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, the world&#x27;s oldest written narrative poem. The tablets&#x27; description of a flood myth, written 1000 years prior to the earliest record of the Biblical story of Noah, caused much debate at the time about the Biblical narrative of ancient history.

===Diplomatic career===
Rassam returned to England. With the help of Layard, he began a new career in government with a posting to the British Consulate in Aden, quickly rising to the post of First Political Resident and facilitating a number of agreements between the British and formerly hostile local community leaders. In 1866, an international crisis arose in Ethiopia when British missionaries were taken hostage by Emperor Tewodros II. England decided to send Rassam as an ambassador with a message from Queen Victoria in the hope of resolving the situation peacefully. After being delayed for about a year in Massawa, Rassam at last received permission from the Emperor to enter his realm. Due to rebellions in Tigray Province, Rassam was forced to follow a circuitous route taking him to Kassala, then to Metemma along the western shore of Lake Tana before finally meeting with Emperor Tewodros in northern Gojjam. At first his effort seemed promising, as the Emperor established him at Qorata, a village on the south-eastern shores of Lake Tana, and sent him numerous gifts. The emperor sent the British consul Charles Duncan Cameron, the missionary Henry Aaron Stern, and the other hostages to his encampment.

However, about this time Charles Tilstone Beke arrived at Massawa and forwarded letters from the hostages&#x27; families to Tewodros asking for their release. At the least Beke&#x27;s actions only made Tewodros suspicious. Rassam, writing in his memoirs of the incident, is more direct: &quot;I date the change in the King&#x27;s conduct towards me, and the misfortunes which eventually befell the members of the Mission and the old captives, from this day.&quot; The monarch suddenly changed his mind, and made Rassam a prisoner as well. The British hostages were held for two years until English and Indian troops under Robert Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala in the 1868 British Expedition to Abyssinia resolved the standoff by defeating the warlord and his army. Rassam&#x27;s reputation was damaged in newspaper accounts because he was unfairly portrayed as ineffectual in dealing with the emperor. This reflected Victorian prejudices of the time against &quot;Orientals&quot;. However, Rassam did have supporters, both in the press and especially in government amongst both Liberal and Tory ministers. In 1869, the &quot;London Quarterly Review&quot; received Rassam&#x27;s memoir of the Abyssinian crisis positively, acknowledged Rassam&#x27;s qualifications for the mission and defended his actions under difficult circumstances:
Queen Victoria presented him with a purse of £5,000 for services rendered as her envoy in the crisis.

Rassam resumed his archaeological work, but did undertake other tasks for the British government in later years. During the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78), he undertook a mission of inquiry to report on the condition of the Christians, Armenian and Greek Christian communities of Anatolia and Armenia.

===Later archaeological career===

From 1877 to 1882, while undertaking four expeditions on behalf of the British Museum, Rassam made some important discoveries. Numerous finds of significance were transported to the museum, thanks to an agreement made with the Ottoman Sultan by Rassam&#x27;s old colleague Austen Henry Layard, now Ambassador at Constantinople, allowing Rassam to return and continue their earlier excavations and to &quot;pack and dispatch to England any antiquities [he] found ... provided, however, there were no duplicates.&quot; A representative of the Sultan was instructed to be present at the dig to examine the objects as they were uncovered.

In Assyria his chief finds were the Ashurnasirpal temple in Nimrud (Calah), the cylinder of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh, and two of the unique and historically important bronze strips from the Balawat Gates. He identified the famous Hanging Gardens of Babylon with the mound known as &quot;Babil&quot;. He excavated a palace of Nebuchadnezzar II at Borsippa.

In March 1879 at the site of the Esagila in Babylon, Rassam found the Cyrus Cylinder, the famous declaration of Cyrus the Great that was issued in 539 BCE to commemorate the Achaemenid Empire&#x27;s conquest of Babylonia.

At Abu Habba in 1881, Rassam discovered the temple of the sun at Sippar. There he found a Cylinder of Nabonidus and the stone tablet of Nabu-apla-iddina of Babylon with its ritual bas-relief and inscription. Besides these, he discovered some 50,000 clay tablets containing the temple accounts.

After 1882, Rassam lived mainly in Brighton, England. He wrote about Assyro-Babylonian exploration, the ancient Christian peoples of the Near East, and current religious controversies in England.

===Archaeological reputation===
Rassam&#x27;s discoveries attracted worldwide attention. The Italian Royal Academy of Sciences at Turin awarded him the Brazza prize of 12,000 francs for the four years from 1879 to 1882. He was elected as a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, the Society of Biblical Archaeology, and the Victoria Institute.

Sir Henry Rawlinson, the &quot;Father of Assyriology&quot;, was a linguist who was a key figure in the deciphering of cuneiform, also one of the trustees of the British Museum at the time of Rassam&#x27;s later excavations. He had been British Consul in Baghdad at the time of Rassam&#x27;s original excavations at Nineveh, and had been placed in charge of the British excavations in 1853. Rawlinson alleged that he should receive the credit for the discovery of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s palace himself. Rassam, he wrote, was just a &quot;digger&quot; who had overseen the work. In Rassam&#x27;s defence, Layard wrote that he was, &quot;one of the honestest and most straightforward fellows I ever knew, and one whose services have never been acknowledged&quot;.

Rassam believed that the credit for some of his other discoveries had been taken by senior British Museum staff. In 1893 Rassam had sued the British Museum keeper E. A. Wallis Budge in the British courts for both slander and libel. Budge had written that Rassam had used &quot;his relatives&quot; to smuggle antiquities out of Nineveh and had only sent &quot;rubbish&quot; to the British Museum. The elderly Rassam was upset by these accusations. When he challenged Budge in court, he received a partial apology that a later court considered &quot;ungentlemanly&quot;. Rassam was fully supported by the courts. Later archaeological evidence found in relation to artefacts such as the Balawat Gates at Dur-Sharrukin support Rassam&#x27;s account of the dispute. By the end of his life, Rassam&#x27;s reputation and achievements were once again receiving greater recognition, at least amidst his professional colleagues; in their obituary for Rassam, the Royal Geographical Society wrote: &quot;The death of Mr Hormuzd Rassam... deprives the Royal Geographical Society of one of its older and more distinguished Fellows...&quot;

However, a modern account of the archaeology says that Layard leaving Rassam in charge of his excavations when he left in 1851 was &quot;not perhaps the wisest choice, since Rassam continued, even into the 1880s, an extensive and essentially unrecorded simultaneous looting of a large number of sites not only in Assyria but in Babylonia, at a times when other excavators were beginning to act more responsibly.

==Personal life==
Rassam married Anne Eliza Price, an Englishwoman. They had seven children together. His eldest daughter, Theresa Rassam, born in 1871, became a professional singer who performed with the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company.

He also had a daughter, Annie Ferida Rassam, born in 1878. She gave birth secretly at seven months of pregnancy, on September 10, 1914, to Jeanne Ferida Rassam at the Vercingétorix clinic, 219 rue Vercingétorix, in the 14th arrondissement at Paris. The baby girl&#x27;s alleged father was Sir John Arnold Wallinger, delegate of the secret services. Jeanne was adopted by a French couple, Monsieur and Madame André Courthial. Annie Ferida Rassam returned to Brighton a few months later.
==Death==
Rassam died on September 8, 1910, and was buried in Hove Cemetery. A number of personal effects relating to his career, including the chains he had worn in captivity in Ethiopia, were donated to Hove Museum, and were on display there until the 1950s, according to the recollections of his great-grandson, Cornelius Cavendish. Other items in the museum&#x27;s possession relating to Rassam were at that time requested for the collections of the British Museum.

<text>Lagash (cuneiform: ; Sumerian: &quot;Lagaš&quot;) was an ancient city-state located northwest of the junction of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers and east of Uruk, about east of the modern town of Al-Shatrah, Iraq. Lagash (modern Al-Hiba in Dhi Qar Governorate) was one of the oldest cities of the Ancient Near East. The ancient site of Nina (Tell Zurghul) is around away and marks the southern limit of the state. Nearby Girsu (modern Telloh), about northwest of Lagash, was the religious center of the Lagash state. The Lagash state&#x27;s main temple was the E-ninnu at Girsu, dedicated to the god Ningirsu. The Lagash state incorporated the ancient cities of Lagash, Girsu, Nina.
==History==
Though some Uruk period pottery shards were found in a surface survey, significant occupation at the site of Lagash began early in the 3rd Millennium BC, in the Early Dynastic I period (c. 2900–2600 BC), surface surveys and excavations show that the peak occupation, with an area of about 500 hectares occurred during the Early Dynastic III period (c. 2500–2334 BC). The later corresponds with what is now called the First Dynasty of Lagash. Lagash then came under the control of the Akkadian Empire for several centuries. With the fall of that empire, Lagash had a period of revival as an independent power during the 2nd Dynasty of Lagash before coming under the control of the 3rd Dynasty of Ur. After the fall of Ur, there was some modest occupation in the Isin-Larsa and Old Babylonian periods. Lagash was then largely deserted until a Seleucid era fortress was built there in the 2nd century BC.

===First dynasty of Lagash (c. 2520 – c. 2260 BC)===
The dynasties of Lagash are not found on the &quot;Sumerian King List&quot; (SKL) despite being a power in the Early Dynastic period and a major city in the centuries that followed. One tablet, from the later Old Babylonian period and known as &quot;The Rulers of Lagash&quot;, was described by its translator as &quot;rather fanciful&quot; and is generally considered to be a satirical parody of the SKL. The thirty listed rulers, in the style of the SKL, having improbable reigns, include seven known rulers from the 1st Dynasty of Lagash, including Ur-Nanshe, &quot;Ane-tum&quot;, En-entar-zid, Ur-Ningirsu, Ur-Bau, and Gudea.

Little is known of the first two rulers of Lagash. En-hegal is believed to be the first ruler of Lagash. A tablet with his name describes a business transaction, in which a possible King En-hegal buys land. Both his status and date are disputed. He was followed by Lugalshaengur about whom also little is known. Mesilim, who called himself King of Kish though it is uncertain which city he was from, named Lugalshaengur as an &quot;ensi&quot; of Lagash on a mace head.
====Ur-Nanshe====
While many details like the length of reign are not known for the next ruler, Ur-Nanshe, a number of his inscriptions have been found, most at Lagash with one stele at Ur, which along with Umma, he claimed to have conquered in battle. Almost all deal with the construction of temples, one details how he &quot;built the wester[n] channel at the side of Sa[la]/ channel at the side of S[al] (against) the Amorites&quot;. He is described as the &quot;son of Gu-NI.DU&quot; (occasionally as &quot;son of Gur:SAR&quot;), and his inscriptions list a number of sons and daughters. Several inscription say &quot;He [had the ships of Dil]mun sub[mit] [timber] (to Lagaš) as tribute.&quot; His son Akurgal ruled briefly after him.
====Eannatum====
The next ruler, Eannatum (earlier referred to as &quot;Eannadu&quot;), son of Akurgal and grandson of Ur-Nanshe, turned Lagash into a major power extending throughout large areas of Mesopotamia and to the east as well. In an inscription found at ancient Adab:

Another inscription detail his destruction of &quot;Kiš, Akšak, and Mari at a place named Antasur&quot;. He also claimed to have taken the city of Akshak and killed its king, Zuzu. Eannatum took the city of Uru&#x27;az on the Persian Gulf, and exacted tribute as far as Mari; however, many of the realms he conquered were often in revolt. During his reign, temples and palaces were repaired or erected at Lagash and elsewhere and canals and reservoirs were excavated. During his reign, Dilmun was a major trading partner.

A long running border dispute, dating back at least to the time of Lugalshaengur, existed between the city-states of Umma and Lagash. In the time of Umma ruler Enakalle a formal border was established, mediated by Mesilim, “king of Kish”. Eannatum restored the border, including the boundary markers of Mesilim.


In c. 2450 BC, Lagash and the neighboring city of Umma fell out with each other after a border dispute over the Guʾedena, a fertile area lying between them. As described in Stele of the Vultures, of which only a portion has been found (7 fragments), the current king of Lagash, Eannatum, inspired by the patron god of his city, Ningirsu, set out with his army to defeat the nearby city. According to the Stele&#x27;s engravings, when the two sides met each other in the field, Eannatum dismounted from his chariot and proceeded to direct his men on foot. After lowering their spears, the Lagash army advanced upon the army from Umma in a dense phalanx. After a brief clash, Eannatum and his army had gained victory over the army of Umma. This battle is one of the earliest depicted organised battles known to scholars and historians.

Eannatum was succeeded by his brother, En-anna-tum I. Given the many inscriptions his reign is assumed to be of some length. Most of them detailed the usual temple construction. On long tablet described the continued conflict with Umma:
The conflict from the Umma side of things from its ruler Ur-Lumma:
====Entemena====
The next ruler, Entemena increased the power of Lagash during his rule. A number of inscriptions from his reign are known. He was a contemporary of Lugalkinishedudu of Uruk.

Entemena was succeeded by his brother Enannatum II, with only one known inscription where he &quot;restored for the god Ningirsu his brewery&quot;. He was followed by two more minor rulers, Enentarzi (only one inscription from his 5 year reign, which mentions his daughter Gem[e]-Baba), and Lugalanda (several inscriptions, one mentions his wife Bara-namtara) the son of Enentarzi. The last ruler of Lagash, Urukagina, was known for his judicial, social, and economic reforms, and his may well be the first legal code known to have existed. He was defeated by Lugalzagesi, beginning when Lugalzagesi was ruler of Umma and culminating as ruler of Uruk, bringing an end to the First Dynasty of Lagash. About 1800 cuneiform tablets from the reigns of the last three rulers of Lagash, of an administrative nature, have been found, mostly. The tablets are mostly from the &quot;woman’s quarter&quot; also known as the temple of the goddess Babu. It was under the control of the Queen.
===Under the Akkadian Empire===
In his conquest of Sumer circa 2300 BC, Sargon of Akkad, after conquering and destroying Uruk, then conquered Ur and E-Ninmar and &quot;laid waste&quot; the territory from Lagash to the sea, and from there went on to conquer and destroy Umma, and he collected tribute from Mari and Elam. He triumphed over 34 cities in total.

Sargon&#x27;s son and successor Rimush faced widespread revolts, and had to reconquer the cities of Ur, Umma, Adab, Lagash, Der, and Kazallu from rebellious &quot;ensis&quot;.

Rimush introduced mass slaughter and large scale destruction of the Sumerian city-states, and maintained meticulous records of his destruction. Most of the major Sumerian cities were destroyed, and Sumerian human losses were enormous: for the cities of Ur and Lagash, he records 8,049 killed, 5,460 &quot;captured and enslaved&quot; and 5,985 &quot;expelled and annihilated&quot;.

A Victory Stele in several fragments (three in total, Louvre Museum AO 2678) has been attributed to Rimush on stylistic and epigraphical grounds. One of the fragments mentions Akkad and Lagash. It is thought that the stele represents the defeat of Lagash by the troops of Akkad. The stele was excavated in ancient Girsu, one of the main cities of the territory of Lagash.
===Second dynasty of Lagash (c. 2260 – c. 2023 BC)===

During the reigns of the first two rulers of this dynasty Lugal-ushumgal (under Naram-Sin and Shar-Kali-Sharri) and Puzur-Mama (under Shar-kali-shari), Lagash was still under the control of the Akkadian Empire. It has been suggested that another governor, Ur-e, fell between them. After the death of Shar-Kali-shari Puzur-Mama declared Lagash independent (known from an inscription that may also mention Elamite ruler Kutik-Inshushinak). This independence appears to have been tenuous as Akkadian Empire ruler Dudu reports taking booty from there.

With the fall of Akkad, Lagash achieved full independence under Ur-Ningirsu I (not to be confused with the later Lagash ruler named Ur-Ningirsu, the son of Gudea). Unlike the 1st Dynasty of Lagash, this series of rulers used year names. Two of Ur-Ningirsu are known including &quot;year: Ur-Ningirsu (became) ruler&quot;. His few inscriptions are religious in nature. Almost nothing is known of his son and successor. The next three rulers, Lu-Baba, Lugula, and Kaku are known only from their first year names. The following ruler, Ur-Baba, is notable mainly because three of his daughters married later rulers of Lagash, Gudea, Nam-mahani, and Ur-gar. His inscriptions are all of a religious nature, including building or restoring the &quot;Eninnu, the White Thunderbird&quot;. Five of his year names are known. At this point Lagash is still at best a small local power. In some case the absolute order of rulers is not known with complete certainty.
====Gudea====
While the Gutians had partially filled the power vacuum left by the fall of the Akkadian Empire, under Gudea Lagash entered a period of independence marked by riches and power. Thousands of inscriptions of various sorts have been found from his reign and an untold number of statues of Gudea. A number of cuneiform tablets of an administrative nature, from Gudea&#x27;s rule were found at nearby Girsu. Also found at Girsu were the famous Gudea cylinders which contain the longest known text in the Sumerian language. He was prolific at temple building and restoring. He is known to have conducted some military operations to the east against Anshan and Elam. Twenty of Gudea&#x27;s year names are known. All are of a religious nature except for one that marks the building of a canal and year six &quot;Year in which the city of Anszan was smitten by weapons&quot;. While the conventional view has been that the reign of Gudea fell well before that of Ur-Nammu, ruler of Ur, and during a time of Gutian power, a number of researchers contend that Gudea&#x27;s rule overlaps with that of Ur-Nammu and the Gutians had already been defeated. This view is strengthened by the fact that Ur-Baba appointed Enanepada as high preiestess of Ur while Naram-Sin of Akkad had appointed her predecessor Enmenana and Ur-Namma of Ur appointed her successor Ennirgalana.

Gudea was succeeded by his son Ur-Ningirsu, followed by Ur-gar. Little is known about either aside from an ascension year name each and a small handful of inscriptions. It has been suggested that two other brief rulers fit into the sequence here, Ur-ayabba and Ur-Mama but the evidence for that is thin. Two tablets dated to the reign of Ur-Nammu of Ur refer to Ur-ayabba as &quot;ensi&quot; of Lagash, meaning governor in Ur III terms and king in Lagash.
====Nam-mahani====
Little is known of the next ruler aside from his ascension year name and a handful of religious inscriptions. Nam-mahani is primarily known for being defeated by Ur-Nammu, first ruler of the Ur III empire and being considered the last ruler of the second dynasty of Lagash (often called the Gudean Dynasty). In the prologue of the Code of Ur-Nammu it states &quot;He slew Nam-ha-ni the ensi of Lagash&quot;. A number of his inscriptions were defaced and the statues of Nam-mahani and his wife were beheaded (the head were not found with the statues by Ur-Nammu in what is usually called an act of Damnatio memoriae.
===Under the Ur III Empire===
Under the control of Ur, the Lagash state (Lagash, Girsu, and Nigin) were the largest and most prosperous province of the empire. Such was its importance that the second highest official in the empire, the Grand Vizier, resided there. The name of one governor of Lagash under Ur is known, Ir-Nanna. After the fifth year of the last Ur II ruler, Ibbi-Sin, his year name was no longer used at Lagash, indicating Ur no longer controlled that city.

==Archaeology==
Lagash is one of the largest archaeological sites in the region, measuring roughly 3.5 kilometers north to south and 1.5 kilometers east to west though is relatively low being only 6 meters above the plain level at maximum. Much of the older area is under the current water table and not available for research. A drone survey posited that Lagash developed on four marsh islands some of which were gated, but the notion that the city was marsh-based is in contention. Estimates of its area range from . The site is divided by the bed of a canal/river, which runs diagonally through the mound. The site was first excavated, for six weeks, by Robert Koldewey in 1887.
It was inspected during a survey of the area by Thorkild Jacobsen and Fuad Safar in 1953, finding the first evidence of its identification as Lagash. The major polity in the region of al-Hiba and Tello had formerly been identified as ŠIR.BUR.LA (Shirpurla).
Tell Al-Hiba was again explored in five seasons of excavation between 1968 and 1976 by a team from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University. The team was led by Vaughn E. Crawford, and included Donald P. Hansen and Robert D. Biggs. Twelve archaeological layers were found with the bottom 9 being Early Dynastic and the lowest under the water table. The primary focus was the excavation of the temple Ibgal of Inanna and the temple Bagara of Ningirsu, as well as an associated administrative area. The team returned 12 years later, in 1990, for a sixth and final season of excavation led by D. P. Hansen. The work primarily involved areas adjacent to an, as yet, unexcavated temple Ibgal of the goddess Inanna in the southwest edge of the city. The Bagara temple of Ningirsu was also worked on. Both were built by Early Dynastic III king Eannatum. Temples to the goddesses Gatumdag, Nanshe, and Bau are known to have existed but have not yet been found. A canal linked the E-ninnu temple of Ningirsu at Girsu, the E-sirara temple of Nanshe at Nigin, and the Bagara temple at Lagash, the three cities being part of one large state. In 1984 a surface survey found that most finds were from the Early Dynastic III period. Small amounts of Uruk, Jemdet Nasr, Isin-Larsa, Old Babylonian and Kassite shards were found in isolated areas.
In March–April 2019, field work resumed as the Lagash Archaeological Project under the directorship of Dr. Holly Pittman of the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Penn Museum in collaboration with the University of Cambridge and Sara Pizzimenti of the University of Pisa. A second season ran from October to November in 2021. A third season ran from March 6 to April 10, 2022. The work primarily involved the Early Dynastic Period Area G and Area H locations along with Geophysical Surveying and Geoarchaeology. The focus was on an industrial area and associated streets, residences, and kilns. Aerial mapping of Lagash, both using UAV drone mapping and satellite imagery was performed. In the fall of 2022 a 4th season of excavation resumed. Among the finds were a public eatery with ovens, a refrigeration system, benches, and large numbers of bowls and beakers.
==Archaeological remains==
===Area A (Ibgal of Inanna)===
Though commonly known as Area A or the Ibgal of Inanna, this temple complex was actually named Eanna during the Ur periods, while Inanna’s sanctuary within Eanna was known as Ibgal.
====Level I architecture====

Level I of Area A was occupied from Early Dynastic (ED I) to Ur III. It was used for both daily worship activities and festive celebrations, particularly for the queen of Lagash during the Barley and Malt-eating festivals of Nanše.

Level I consists of an oval wall on the Northeast end, surrounding an extensive courtyard. The fragments, together comparison to another Sumerian temple at Khafajah, show that the wall should originally be approximately 130m long.

For the temple-building, it is connected to the courtyard with steps. Twenty-five rooms have been excavated inside the building, in which the western ones would open up to the outside of the temple with corridors and form a tripartite entrance. Both the temple-building and the oval wall were built with plano-convex mud bricks, which was a very common material up to the late Early Dynastic III period. Additionally, foundations are found under the temple-building. They are composed of rectangular areas of various sizes, some as solid mud bricks and some as cavities of broken pieces of alluvial mud and layers of sand, then capped again with mud bricks.

====Level II and Level III architecture====
Two more levels are present beneath Level I. All of them are similar to each other in terms of layout and construction materials. During the process of building on top of each other, workers at that time would choose to destroy some portions while keeping some others, leading to much open speculation as to the rationales behind.

===Area B (3HB Building and 4HB Building at Bagara of Ningirsu)===
====The 3HB Building====
Three building levels were discovered and 3HB III is the earliest and most well-preserved level. 3HB II and 3HB I shared the same layout with 3HB III. All three levels have a central niched-and-buttressed building which is surrounded by a low enclosure wall with unknown height.

An excavator believes that the 3HB Building was a “kitchen temple” that aimed at meeting some of the god’s demands. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the building was a shrine in the Bagara complex as it shared more similarities with other temples than kitchens in terms of layout, features and contents.
====The 4HB Building====

The excavators discovered five building levels. The layout of 4HB V cannot be obtained due to limited exploration. 4HB IV-4HB I shared the same layout. 4HB IVB was the first level that was exposed completely. 

It has been suggested that the 4HB Building is a brewery as ovens and storage vats and a tablet mentioning “the brewery” and “a brewer” were found. An alternate proposal is that 4HB building is a kitchen as it shared lots of similarities with temple kitchens at Ur and Nippur.
===Area C===
Located 360 meters southeast of Area B. It contains a large Early Dynastic administrative area with two building levels (1A and 1B). In level 1B were found sealing and tablets of Eanatum, Enanatum I, and Enmetena.

===Area G===

Area G is located at the midway of Area B in the North and Area A in the South. First excavated by Dr Donald P. Hansen in season 3H, Area G consists of a building complex and a curving wall which are separated by around 30-40m.
====Western Building Complex====

5 building levels are found in the area. There is little information about Levels I and IIA as they were poorly preserved without sealed floor deposits. In Levels IIB, III and IV, changes can be found in the building complex with reconstructions. In Level III, benches are built near the eastern and northern courtyards. Sealings made in the “piedmont” style which are found in the rooms share a resemblance with the Seal Impression Strata of Ur and sealings from Inanna Temple at Nippur, indicating the administrative nature of the buildings. Apart from institutional objects, fireplaces, bins and pottery were found in the rooms as well.
====Curving Wall (Eastern Zone)====
A 2-m wide wall that runs from the south to the north is found on the eastern part of Area G. The features of the curving wall and the rooms found near it are determined to be different from other oval temples built in the Early Dynastic in other major states. Intrusive vertical drains are found at the base of the plano-convex foundation. Archaeologists excavated further deeper to the water level during season 4H and found extensive Early Dynastic I deposits.
==List of rulers==
Although the first dynasty of Lagash has become well-known based on mentions in inscriptions contemporaneous with other dynasties from the Early Dynastic (ED) III period; it was not inscribed onto the &quot;Sumerian King List (SKL)&quot;. The first dynasty of Lagash preceded the dynasty of Akkad in a time in which Lagash exercised considerable influence in the region. The following list should not be considered complete:

<text>&quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot; (titled onscreen as &quot;&quot;The Simpsons&quot; Christmas Special&quot;) (originally produced as the eighth episode) is the series premiere of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. A Christmas special, the show had a very long delayed release. It first aired on Fox in the United States on December 17, 1989. Introducing the Simpson family into half-hour television in this episode, Bart Simpson disobediently gets a tattoo without the permission of his parents. After Marge spends all the family&#x27;s holiday budget on having it removed, Homer learns that his boss is not giving employees Christmas bonuses, and takes a job as a shopping mall Santa in order to pay for his children&#x27;s Christmas presents.

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; was originally intended to debut earlier in 1989 with &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;, but due to animation problems with that episode, the series debuted with this episode on December 17. &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot; was written by Mimi Pond and directed by David Silverman, and was the only episode of the series to air during the 1980s. Promos for the next episode (&quot;Bart the Genius&quot;) ran during commercial breaks for this episode.

&quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot; was viewed by approximately 13.4 million people in its original airing, and was nominated for two Emmy Awards in 1990. Since its release on home video, the episode has received positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
After attending the Springfield Elementary School Christmas pageant, the Simpsons prepare for the holiday season. Bart and Lisa write letters to Santa; Lisa asks for a pony — which Marge tries to tactfully discourage by claiming that there would not be enough room for one on Santa&#x27;s sleigh — and Bart wants a tattoo, which Marge and Homer forbid him from getting. The next day, Marge takes the kids Christmas shopping at the mall. Bart sneaks away to get a tattoo that reads &quot;Mother&quot; on his arm, thinking that Marge will like it. Before the artist can finish the tattoo, Marge finds Bart and drags him to the dermatologist to have it removed. She is forced to spend the family&#x27;s entire holiday budget on the procedure, believing that Homer&#x27;s Christmas bonus will cover gift expenses.

At the power plant, Mr. Burns cancels this year&#x27;s employee Christmas bonus. When he learns Marge spent the family&#x27;s holiday money on tattoo removal, Homer moonlights as a shopping mall Santa at the suggestion of his friend Barney Gumble. While at the mall on Christmas Eve, Bart removes Santa&#x27;s beard, exposing Homer&#x27;s secret. Bart apologizes for the prank and praises his father for moonlighting to give the family Christmas presents. After Homer&#x27;s Santa gig pays far less than expected due to deductions for training and uniform, he and Bart receive a greyhound racing tip from Barney.

At Springfield Downs, Homer bets all his money on a last-minute entry named Santa&#x27;s Little Helper, a 99–1 long shot. The greyhound unfortunately finishes last. As Homer and Bart leave the track, they see the dog&#x27;s owner yell and abandon him for losing the race. Bart pleads with Homer to keep the dog as a pet. They return home, where Homer&#x27;s confession to not getting his Christmas bonus is interrupted when Bart introduces Santa&#x27;s Little Helper to the others. The family is overjoyed by this gesture, and celebrates by singing &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;.

==Development==

===Origin of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;===

&quot;The Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening conceived of the idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of James L. Brooks&#x27; office. Brooks, the producer of the sketch comedy program &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, wanted to use a series of animated shorts as bumpers between sketches. He had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts, which Groening initially intended to present as his &quot;Life in Hell&quot; series. However, when Groening realized that animating &quot;Life in Hell&quot; would require the rescinding of publication rights for his life&#x27;s work, he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family.

The Simpson family first appeared as shorts in &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; on April 19, 1987. Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes. In 1989, a team of production companies adapted &quot;The Simpsons&quot; into a half-hour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company. Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show&#x27;s content. Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called &quot;the mainstream trash&quot; they were watching. The half-hour series premiered on December 17, 1989, with this episode.

===Production===
&quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot; is the first episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and the Fox network was nervous about the show because they were unsure if it could sustain the audience&#x27;s attention for the duration of the episode. They proposed doing three seven-minute shorts per episode and four specials until the audience adjusted, but in the end, the producers gambled by asking Fox for 13 full-length episodes. The series was originally planned to premiere earlier in the fall of 1989 with the episode &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;, but due to major problems with the animation of that episode, the series began on December 17 with this episode. &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot; instead aired as the season finale. &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;, being the first to air, lacked the opening sequence which was later added in the second episode, &quot;Bart the Genius&quot;, when Groening realized that a longer opening sequence resulted in less animation. Because &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot; was the eighth episode produced, but the first one aired, it has more refined animation than the episodes following it, such as &quot;Bart the Genius&quot; and &quot;Homer&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;. Additionally, the characters&#x27; personalities are more developed.

The &quot;Santas of Many Lands&quot; portion of the Christmas pageant is based on Groening&#x27;s experience in the second grade when he did a report on Christmas in Russia. Groening also used that reference in his comic strip &quot;Life in Hell&quot; when he spoofed himself as a young man, being told that it is too bad his grandmother was from Russia because Christmas was against the law there. Also, Groening claims that this episode has been incorrectly credited with creating the &quot;alternate version&quot; of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; that has become a well-known children&#x27;s playground song. During Lisa&#x27;s performance at the Christmas pageant, she appears to be naked from the waist down. According to David Silverman, this was an animation error and she was intended to be wearing a body stocking, but the Korean animators never colored it in.

Mimi Pond wrote the episode, the only one she wrote for the series, while staff writer Al Jean came up with the title, which alludes to &quot;The Christmas Song&quot;, also known as &quot;Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;. David Silverman directed this episode, while Rich Moore storyboarded it and designed Ned Flanders. Several of the scenes were laid out by Eric Stefani, brother of Gwen Stefani, the lead singer of the rock band No Doubt. In this episode, Barney Gumble has blond hair, which was the same color as his skin, but that was later dropped because of the belief that only the Simpson family should have such hair. Seymour Skinner, Milhouse Van Houten, Ralph Wiggum, Sherri &amp; Terri, Moe Szyslak, Mr. Burns, Barney Gumble, Patty &amp; Selma, Grampa Simpson, Ned &amp; Todd Flanders, Santa&#x27;s Little Helper, Snowball II, Dewey Largo, and Lewis all make their first appearances in this episode. Snowball I is mentioned for the first time, and Waylon Smithers can be heard over the speaker at the power plant, but he is not seen.

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast, &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot; finished in thirtieth place in the weekly ratings for the week of December 11–17, 1989, with a Nielsen rating of 14.5, and was viewed in approximately 13.4 million homes. It was the second-highest-rated show on Fox up to that point.

Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. IGN&#x27;s Robert Canning in a 2008 review of the episode noted, &quot;though not the funniest of episodes, it certainly was groundbreaking. [...] With this episode, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; had its premise down, and it certainly had its edge.&quot; Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot;, said of the episode: &quot;pretty standard early fare, with the series not quite hitting its stride&quot;. They went on to say, &quot;the realism of the first season is much apparent, with only the laser used to remove Bart&#x27;s tattoo hinting at what the series will become.&quot;

In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 3½/5 and commented: &quot;Surprisingly, this early episode has a lot of the zest of the later shows, despite fairly odd-looking art and a very Walter Matthau voice for Homer, still has some laughs.&quot; Colin Jacobson at &quot;DVD Movie Guide&quot; said in a review that the episode &quot;is good but not great early Simpsons&quot; and further commented: &quot;For many years I thought of &#x27;Roasting&#x27; as a terrible episode, but it&#x27;s not. While I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s anything special, it remains a fairly entertaining show that has a few entertaining moments.&quot;

The episode was nominated for two Emmy Awards in 1990: &quot;Outstanding Animated Program&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Editing for a Miniseries or Special&quot;. Because &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot; was considered a separate special, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was nominated twice in the Animated Program category. This episode lost to fellow &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Life on the Fast Lane&quot;.

In 2009, IGN named the episode number4 on its &quot;Top 10 Holiday Specials&quot; list, writing &quot;With the off-beat sense of humor that we have learned to love from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and a story showing the value of family on the Christmas holiday, we can&#x27;t help but watch this great special every year.&quot; Al Jean, the current showrunner, selected the episode as one of five essential episodes in the show&#x27;s history in 2014. In 2020, Jean acknowledged &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot; as an episode many consider to be a favorite.

In a retrospective review in &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; in 2010, Nathan Rabin called the episode &quot;both naughty and nice&quot;, adding that its pace was slower than later episodes and resembled family sitcoms, but &quot;the humor, heart and subversion that would make &quot;The Simpsons&quot; such a towering achievement were evident from the very beginning.&quot;

==Home media==
The special was the subject of the series&#x27; first home video release, &quot;The Simpsons Christmas Special&quot;, released on VHS in 1991. The episode was also included in &quot;The Simpsons – Christmas&quot; (later retitled &quot;Christmas with The Simpsons&quot;), a DVD compilation of the series&#x27; Christmas episodes, produced in 2003. The episode was also included on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; season one DVD set, which was released on September 25, 2001. Groening, Brooks, and Silverman participated in the DVD&#x27;s audio commentary.

Coinciding with the broadcast&#x27;s 35th anniversary on December 17, 2024, Disney+ released the complete episode onto YouTube, preceded by an introductory segment with director Silverman alongside showrunner Matt Selman promoting the new Simpsons Christmas special &quot;O C&#x27;mon All Ye Faithful&quot;.

<text>Laogai (), short for &quot;laodong gaizao&quot; (), which means reform through labor, is a criminal justice system involving the use of penal labor and prison farms in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). &quot;Láogǎi&quot; is different from &quot;láojiào&quot;, or re-education through labor, which was the abolished administrative detention system for people who were not criminals but had committed minor offenses, and was intended to &quot;reform offenders into law-abiding citizens&quot;. Persons who were detained in the &quot;laojiao&quot; were detained in facilities that were separate from those which comprised the general prison system of the &quot;laogai&quot;. Both systems, however, were based on penal labor.

Some writers have likened the &quot;laogai&quot; to slavery.

== History ==

=== Maoist era ===
During the 1950s and 1960s, Chinese prisons, which were similar to organized factories, contained large numbers of people who were considered too critical of the government or &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot;. However, many people arrested for political or religious reasons were released in the late 1970s at the start of the Deng Xiaoping reforms (known as reform and opening).

In the 21st century, critics have said that Chinese prisons produce products for sale in foreign countries, with the profits going to the PRC government. Products include everything from green tea to industrial engines to coal dug from mines. According to James D. Seymour and Richard Anderson, who both teach at Chinese schools, the products made in laogai camps comprise an insignificant amount of mainland China&#x27;s export output and gross domestic product. They argue that the use of prison labor for manufacturing is not in itself a violation of human rights, and that most prisoners in Chinese prisons are serving time for what are generally regarded as crimes in the West. The West&#x27;s criticism of the &quot;laogai&quot; is based not only on the export of products made by forced labor, but also on the claims of detainees being held for political or religious violations, such as leadership of unregistered Chinese House Churches.

=== Market reform era ===
Structural changes following the introduction of market reforms have reduced tax revenue to local governments, increasing pressure for local governments to supplement their income from elsewhere. At the same time, prisoners usually do not make a good workforce. The products manufactured by prison labor in China are of low quality and have become unsalable on the open market in competition with products made by non-imprisoned paid labor.

In 1994 the &quot;laogai&quot; camps were renamed &quot;prisons&quot;. However, Chinese criminal law still stipulates that prisoners able to work shall &quot;accept education and reform through labor&quot;. The existence of an extensive network of forced-labor camps producing consumer goods for export to Europe and the United States became classified. Publication of information about China&#x27;s prison system by Al Jazeera English resulted in its expulsion from China on May 7, 2012.

=== Modern era ===
In 2003, the word &quot;laogai&quot; entered the Oxford English Dictionary. It entered the German &quot;Duden&quot; in 2005, and French and Italian dictionaries in 2006.

Harry Wu has written books, including &quot;Troublemaker&quot; and &quot;Laogai,&quot; that describe the system from the 19(?)0s to the 1990s. Wu spent 19 years, from 1960 to 1979, as a prisoner in these camps, for having criticized the government while he was a young college student. After almost starving to death in the camps, he eventually moved to the United States as a visiting scholar in 1985. In 1992, Wu created the Laogai Research Foundation, a human rights NGO located in Washington, DC. In 2008, Wu opened the Laogai Museum in Washington, D.C., calling it the first ever United States museum to directly address human rights in China. In 2008, the Laogai Research Foundation estimated that approximately 1,045 &quot;laogai&quot; facilities were operating in China, and contained an estimated 500,000 to 2 million detainees.

== Conditions in Laogai camps ==

=== Clothing ===
Unlike Laojiao (re-education through labor) inmates, Laogai criminals are issued clothing. Depending on the locale and its economic situation, the quality of clothing can vary significantly. Some prisoners may receive black or grey while others wear dark red or blue. Also depending on location, the clothing is available in different thicknesses. Commonly stamped on the uniforms are the Chinese characters for &quot;fan&quot; and &quot;lao gai&quot; meaning &quot;criminal&quot; and &quot;reform through labor,&quot; respectively. Also issued to the prisoners are a pair of shoes made of rubber or plastic. These minimums do not meet the needs of the prisoners, who must purchase underclothes, socks, hats, and jackets with their monthly earnings of 2.5–3 yuan (US$0.37–US$0.44 as of April 11, 2009). Jackets were rare in the Mao era and were commonly made from patches of old blankets rather than from original cloth. Washing clothes was also rare, but clothing supplies in prisons have improved since the mid-Deng-Jiang Era.

=== Food ===
Food distribution has varied much through time, similar to its variation across the &quot;over 1,155 documented laogai&quot; camps. One camp near Beijing distributes between 13.5 and 22.5 kg of food per person per month. This is about average. The food consists of sorghum and corn, which are ground into flour and made into bread or gruel. The prisoners of the Beijing camp also receive 3 ounces of cooking oil per month. Every 2 weeks, the prisoners receive &quot;a special meal of pork broth soup and white-flour steamed buns&quot;. Important Chinese holidays, such as New Year&#x27;s, National Day, and the Spring Festival, are celebrated with meat dumplings, an exception in an otherwise meatless diet.

Food is distributed by one person per squad, which consists of about 10 people. This prisoner, called the &quot;zhiban&quot; or &quot;duty prisoner,&quot; delivers the food to the rest of his group in large bowls on a cart. This often involves pushing the cart a great distance to the place where the others are working. Each day prisoners receive gruel, bread, and a watery vegetable soup made from the cheapest vegetables available. Some camps have reported two meals a day, while others allow three. Food is rationed according to rank and productive output, which is believed to provide motivation to work.

During the Mao era, food in prisons was very scarce, not only because of a nationwide famine during the Great Leap Forward (1959–1962), but also because of the harsher rules. Since little food was available, prisoners would scavenge anything they came across while working. Cases were documented of prisoners eating &quot;field mice, crickets, locusts, toads, grapevine worms, grasshoppers, insect larvae and eggs, and venomous snakes&quot;. Also, many inmates would steal produce from the fields they worked on, smuggling vegetables back to their barracks. In Jiabiangou, Gansu, around 2,500 out of 3,000 prisoners died of starvation between 1960 and 1962, with some survivors resorting to cannibalism.

Nutrition in the camps was a big problem, especially during the early 1950s through the 1960s, in the early years of the PRC (People&#x27;s Republic of China). Before the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) took control, hunger was rarely used to control prisoners. Early leaders of the CCP realized the power of withholding food from rebellious prisoners and, until recently, this practice was very common. Since the early 1990s, some camps in the coastal regions of Eastern China have improved the quality and amount of food.

=== Living quarters and sanitation ===
The living quarters, commonly referred to as barracks in most Laogai literature, were relatively primitive. Most had floors made of cement or wood, but some were of only straw and/or earth. The latrine was a bucket, and no furniture was provided. The prisoners slept on the floor in a space 30 cm wide, with 10 people per room. New prisoners were forced to sleep nearest to the latrine while more senior ones slept near the opposite wall.

Baths and showers were very rare and often not mentioned at all in memoirs. The only form of washing was the use of a water basin, which was only slightly less rare. This was ineffective because the entire squad used the same water. Basic essentials, such as a toothbrush and toothpaste, toilet paper, soap, and towels were not provided; prisoners had to spend their wages to acquire them. Prisoners were known to have spread manure, both human and animal, and been required to eat immediately without being able to wash their hands.

The sleeping quarters were surrounded on all sides by a wall. This wall is about 20 feet high and topped with electrical fencing. There were also sentry towers on each corner. Outside this wall was 40 feet of empty space, followed by another wall, similar to the first but larger.

=== Disease and pests ===
The Laogai camps were infested with many types of pests. Bed bugs were so numerous that at night they often moved in swarms. This behavior earned them the Laogai nickname of tanks or &quot;tanke&quot;. They sucked the blood of the prisoners, leaving little red welts all over their bodies. These welts itched, and severe cases led to inmates scratching their skin raw, leading to dangerous infections. Another common pest was lice; some prisoners were known to eat them to supplement their meager diet. No insecticide or pesticides were used in the camps. The prisoner Zhang Xianliang wrote that &quot;the parasites on a single inmate&#x27;s underpants would be as numerous as the words on the front page of a newspaper&quot;. He noted fleas would be so numerous that they would &quot;turn his quilt purplish black with their droppings&quot;. Roundworms were also a common threat to the prisoners&#x27; health, especially in laogai farms, where human excrement was used as fertilizer.

Along with a poor diet came many diet-related diseases: beriberi, edema, scurvy, and pellagra were the most common, due to lack of vitamins. Other health problems caused by the lack of healthy food included severe diarrhea or constipation from the lack of oil and fiber. These two were often left untreated and, added to the continuous strain of 12 hours of manual labor, weakened the immune system. Eventually, death followed many of these conditions. Two diseases rampant among the populations of these camps were tuberculosis and hepatitis. Highly contagious, these were also often left untreated until it was too late. Each morning, the cadre of the camp decided who was sick enough to stay in the barracks and miss the day of work. Many prisoners were forced to work when they were ill. Mental illness used to be very common during the Mao era, when prisoners had to spend 2 hours each evening being indoctrinated. The brainwashing that occurred over the amount of time people were imprisoned could be so intense that they were driven to insanity and, in many cases, suicide.

=== &quot;Reform through labor&quot; ===
Forced labor defines Laogai prison camps, according to Harry Wu, who has characterized the system as:

Prisoners are roused from bed at 5:30 a.m., and at 6:00 a.m. the &quot;zhiban&quot; from the kitchen wheels in a cart with tubs of corn gruel and cornbread ... at 7:00 a.m. the company public security cadre (captain) comes in, gathers all the prisoners together, and authorizes any sick prisoners to remain in the barracks. Once at the worksite, the captain delegates production responsibilities ...
At lunchtime the &quot;zhiban&quot; arrives pulling a handcart with a large tub of vegetable soup, two hunks of cornbread for each prisoner, and a large tube of drinking water ... after about 30 minutes, work is resumed until the company chief announces quitting time in the evening. Generally the prisoners return to the barracks at about 6:30 p.m.
Upon return it is once again a dinner of cornbread, corn gruel, and vegetable soup.
At 7:30 p.m., the 2-hour study period begins...
At 9:30 p.m., no matter what the weather, all prisoners gather together outside the barracks for roll call and a speech from the captain. At around 10:00 p.m., everyone goes to bed.
During the night no lights are allowed and no one is allowed to move about. One must remain in one&#x27;s assigned sleeping place and wait until 5:30 a.m. the next morning before getting up, when the whole cycle begins again.

Quota filling was a big part of the inmates&#x27; lives in Laogai camps. Undershooting or overshooting the target productivity governs their quality of life. Not making the number may result in solitary confinement or loss of food privileges. Generally, food rations are cut by 10–20% if a worker fails to meet the standard. Some prisoners excel and are able to do more than what is required of them. They sometimes receive extra or better quality food. It has been argued that this extra food is not worth the extra calories burned to be more productive, so many prisoners choose to do the minimum with minimum effort, thereby saving as much energy as possible.

Working conditions in Laogai camps are substandard:

Investigators from the Laogai Research Foundation have confirmed sites where prisoners mine asbestos and other toxic chemicals with no protective gear, work with batteries and battery acid with no protection for their hands, tan hides while standing naked in vats filled 3-feet deep with chemicals used for the softening of animal skins, and work in improperly run mining facilities where explosions and other accidents are a common occurrence.

Career preparation has historically been used to justify forced labor prison systems around the world. In China, although this argument was used, career preparation was minimal until recently. Following release, the skills acquired within the Laogai prison (i.e. ditch-digging or manure-spreading) do not often lead to desirable employment. Inmates who entered the Laogai system with marketable skills were often assigned jobs utilizing these skills within the prison complex. Doctors, for example, were doctors within the Laogai camp often receiving preferential treatment, larger amounts of food, similar to the cadre, and a bed. &quot;Inmates rarely leave with any new skills unless the training fits the camp&#x27;s enterprising needs.&quot; More recently however, programs have been introduced to train prisoners in useful trades.

While there are many types of Laogai complexes, most enterprises are farms, mines, or factories. There are, according to the Chinese government, &quot;approximately 200 different kinds of Laogai products that are exported to international markets&quot;. &quot;A quarter of China&#x27;s tea is produced in Laogai camps; 60 percent of China&#x27;s rubber-vulcanizing chemicals are produced in a single Laogai camp in Shengyang ... one of the largest steel-pipe factories in the country is a Laogai camp ... &quot; One camp alone, Ziangride, harvests more than 22,000 metric tons of grain every year. Dulan County prisoners have planted over 400,000 trees.

The conditions in these camps are considered extremely harsh by most of the world&#x27;s cultures. However, the Chinese government considers Laogai to be effective in controlling prisoners and furthering China&#x27;s economy. According to Mao Zedong, &quot;The Laogai facilities are one of the violent component parts of the state machine. Laogai facilities of all levels are established as tools representing the interests of the proletariat and the people&#x27;s masses and exercising dictatorship over a minority of hostile elements originating from exploiter classes.&quot;

== Estimated number of deaths ==
The estimated number of deaths in laogai varies substantially among authors on the subject:

* In 1997, human rights activist and Laogai Research Foundation creator Harry Wu put the death toll from 1949 to 1997 at 15 million.
* In 1991, political scientist Rudolph Rummel puts the number of forced labor &quot;democides&quot; at 15,720,000, excluding &quot;all those collectivized, ill-fed and clothed peasants who would be worked to death in the fields&quot;.
* In 1997, Jean-Louis Margolin estimated in &quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot; that 20 million deaths resulted from high mortality rates in laogai. Margolin&#x27;s calculation assume a yearly imprisoned population of 10 million people and a yearly mortality rate of 5%. If camps operated from roughly 1949 to 1980, that yields about 15.5 million dead.
* In 2005, linguist Jung Chang and historian Jon Halliday estimated in &quot;&quot; that deaths in prisons and labor camps &quot;could well amount to 27 million&quot; during Mao&#x27;s rule. In 2005, Jin Xiaoding negatively described Chang and Halliday&#x27;s logic as a &quot;magic formula&quot; that simply multiplies 27 (years of Mao&#x27;s rule) by 10 million (assumed camp population) by 10% (assumed yearly mortality rate) to obtain 27 million dead, with no discussion of responsibility or other data. Charlie Hore called this method &quot;guessing&quot;. Chang and Halliday say that inmates were subjected to back-breaking labor in the most hostile wastelands, and that executions and suicides by any means (like diving into a wheat chopper) were commonplace.

<text>The Battle of Route Coloniale 4, also called the Autumn-Winter Border Campaign (&quot;Chiến Dịch Biên Giới Thu Đông&quot;) by the Viet Minh, was a battle of the First Indochina War. It took place along Route Coloniale 4 (RC4, also known as Highway 4), a road used to supply the French military base at Cao Bằng. French military traffic along the road had previously been subject to an ongoing series of ambushes during 1947–1949.

The aim of Việt Minh in the 1950 Border Campaign was clearing the way to the Vietnam-China border for the supply flow from the newly formed People&#x27;s Republic of China. In this campaign the Việt Minh also tried to test new tactics and gain new experiences in a large scale battle which the Việt Minh had not previously used.

The battle lasted from 30 September to 18 October 1950 and resulted in a French defeat when the Việt Minh got Chinese help. Several units of the French army, including some battalions of the French Foreign Legion, were devastated by the Việt Minh and essentially ceased to exist as fighting units.

==RC4 in the First Indochina War==
During the French Indochina War (1946–1954), French forces attempted to re-establish colonial control of Vietnam, while the Vietnamese guerrilla forces, the communist Việt Minh, led by Ho Chi Minh fought for independence. Initially the Việt Minh were unsuccessful in dealing with the better -trained and -equipped French forces. Their situation improved in 1949 after the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army of Mao Zedong defeated the Nationalist army led by Chiang Kai-shek. This gave the Việt Minh, now almost completely made up of members of the Vietnam Workers Party, a safe haven for organization and training, as well as an initially sympathetic ally to provide them with arms and logistical support.

Võ Nguyên Giáp, the military leader of the Việt Minh, launched an offensive against the French in early 1950. From February to April, his operation &quot;Le Hong Phong I&quot; developed through the Red River Valley, largely giving the Việt Minh control of northwestern Tonkin, near the Chinese border. The area became a Việt Minh stronghold, except for the RC4 highway.

On 25 May, 2,500 Việt Minh troops overwhelmed the French fortress at Đông Khê, which lay at the strategic center of RC4, thus cutting the supply line between the French positions at Cao Bằng and Lạng Sơn. French paratroops retook Đông Khê on the evening of 27 May and a company of Legionnaires took charge of the fort.

Meanwhile, the Việt Minh regular army grew in size and experience. By the beginning of September, it comprised roughly 100,000 combatants in 70 battalions, with another 33 battalions of regional forces (40,000 men) as well as some 60,000 local support personnel. Giap then began harassing French positions along RC4 in northern Vietnam with mines and ambushes. The French responded by dismantling their small posts along the road and concentrating area forces in the fortified positions at Đông Khê and Cao Bằng. Giap planned to launch another assault on French positions in operation &quot;Le Hong Phong II&quot;.

On 16 September, five Việt Minh infantry and one heavy weapons battalions attacked Đông Khê. It was then garrisoned by some 300 French Foreign Legion troops comprising the 5th and 6th companies of the 2nd battalion of the 3rd Regiment (3rd REI). On 18 September, the fort was overrun after bitter fighting, and only 12 survivors escaped to the nearby post at Thất Khê. 140 Legionnaires had been taken prisoner, the remainder being killed or missing in action.

Thất Khê was quickly reinforced by the Foreign Legion&#x27;s 1st Parachute Battalion (1st BEP), which parachuted in on 17 September. The 1st BEP waited at Thất Khê while a force of French colonial troops, the Moroccan 1st and 11th Tabors, and the 1st Marching Battalion of the 8th Moroccan Tirailleurs Regiment, assembled at Lạng Sơn. Designated &quot;Groupement Bayard&quot; the combined force comprised 3,500 men under the command of Colonel Le Page. The task force launched an intelligence raid, capturing prisoners who said a massive Việt Minh offensive was planned.

Meanwhile, General Marcel Carpentier, the commander in chief of French Indochina, decided to evacuate Cao Bằng. The commander of the Cao Bằng fort, Colonel Charton, was ordered to destroy his heavy equipment and motor transport and evacuate towards Đông Khê. The plan was that Groupement Bayard would fight its way north from Thất Khê and retake Đông Khê, holding it long enough to link up with the Cao Bằng group. This group comprised 2,600 troops and 500 civilians, the latter mostly pro-French Thai partisans and their families.

==Battle of RC4==

On 30 September, Groupement Bayard set out from Thất Khê, led by the 1 BEP. However, Giap had concentrated ten battalions around Đông Khê, reinforced by a complete artillery regiment, together with the remaining forces from Le Hong Phong I. The Việt Minh rebuffed the French forces, which were forced to pull back and wait for air support. Le Page renewed the attack on 2 October, pushing west to bypass Đông Khê as Việt Minh numbers were overwhelming.

Meanwhile, Colonel Charton&#x27;s group, led by the 3rd Battalion, 3rd REI, left Cao Bằng on 1 October; contrary to orders he took with him his heavy equipment. The group&#x27;s movement down RC4 was slowed by Việt Minh ambushes. After bitter fighting, they finally abandoned their heavy equipment and linked up with Groupement Bayard in the hills around Đông Khê on 5 October.

The French forces were driven into the Coc Xa gorge, where they were completely annihilated by 7 October. Martin Windrow notes that &quot;Some 130 of the Legion parachute battalion out of the 500 that had jumped emerged from this breakthrough fight; they had only escaped by clambering down lianas shrouding a 75 ft cliff with their wounded tied on their backs&quot;.

In an attempt to support the embattled troops the 1st BEP Replacement Company (120 men) under Lieutenant Loth had been merged with 268 men from the 3rd Colonial Commando Parachute Battalion (3rd BCCP) under Captain Cazeaux and they were parachuted into Thất Khê on 8 October, but over the course of the next week were destroyed as well. Only 23 survivors of the 1st BEP, led by Captain Jeanpierre, managed to escape to French lines: it became the first French parachute battalion lost in combat, followed by the 3rd BCCP, of which only 14 soldiers returned unscathed.

==Aftermath==
Of the more than 6,000 French soldiers and civilians involved in the operation, only 700 reached French lines. Lạng Sơn, the next French base to the south, was abandoned on 17 October and on 18 October the French command evacuated posts south of Lạng Sơn on RC4. Panic spread in French-controlled Hanoi and there was talk of an evacuation. Ultimately, however, General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny replaced Carpentier as commander in chief of French Indochina in late 1950 and restored French morale.

When the Border Campaign ended, the Việt Minh controlled a large part of the Vietnam-China border. Giáp had called the previous situation, in which the French controlled the Northern border, &quot;fighting under siege&quot;. The &quot;siege&quot; started in 1945 and described how the French Army had encircled the Việt Minh. After the Border Campaign was won, the Việt Minh had greater access through to their socialist allies after lifting the &quot;siege&quot;. Fighting under siege was a phase used after the war to describe the Việt Minh&#x27;s relationship with the Communist Bloc before this victory.
