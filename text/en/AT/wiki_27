<doc id="139993" wikidata="Q207781" url="?curid=139993" title="Economic bubble">
<text>An economic bubble (also called a speculative bubble or a financial bubble) is a period when current asset prices greatly exceed their intrinsic valuation, being the valuation that the underlying long-term fundamentals justify. Bubbles can be caused by overly optimistic projections about the scale and sustainability of growth (e.g. dot-com bubble), and/or by the belief that intrinsic valuation is no longer relevant when making an investment (e.g. Tulip mania). They have appeared in most asset classes, including equities (e.g. Roaring Twenties), commodities (e.g. Uranium bubble), real estate (e.g. 2000s US housing bubble), and even esoteric assets (e.g. Cryptocurrency bubble). Bubbles usually form as a result of either excess liquidity in markets, and/or changed investor psychology. Large multi-asset bubbles (e.g. 1980s Japanese asset bubble and the 2020–21 Everything bubble), are attributed to central banking liquidity (e.g. overuse of the Fed put).

In the early stages of a bubble, many investors do not recognise the bubble for what it is. People notice the prices are going up and often think it is justified. Therefore bubbles are often conclusively identified only in retrospect, after the bubble has already &quot;popped&quot; and prices have crashed.

== Origin of term ==
The term &quot;bubble&quot;, in reference to financial crisis, originated in the 1711–1720 British South Sea Bubble, and originally referred to the companies themselves, and their inflated stock, rather than to the crisis itself. This was one of the earliest modern financial crises; other episodes were referred to as &quot;manias&quot;, as in the Dutch tulip mania. The metaphor indicated that the prices of the stock were inflated and fragile – expanded based on nothing but air, and vulnerable to a sudden burst, as in fact occurred.

Some later commentators have extended the metaphor to emphasize the suddenness, suggesting that economic bubbles end &quot;All at once, and nothing first, / Just as bubbles do when they burst,&quot; though theories of financial crises such as debt deflation and the Financial Instability Hypothesis suggest instead that bubbles burst &quot;progressively,&quot; with the most vulnerable (most highly-leveraged) assets failing first, and then the collapse spreading throughout the economy.

==Types==
There are different types of bubbles, with economists primarily interested in two major types of bubbles: The &quot;equity bubble&quot; and the &quot;debt bubble.&quot;

===Equity bubble===
An equity bubble is characterised by tangible investments and the unsustainable desire to satisfy a legitimate market in high demand. These kind of bubbles are characterised by easy liquidity, tangible and real assets, and an actual innovation that boosts confidence. The injection of funds into the business cycle is capable of accelerating the innovation process and propelling faster productivity growth. Three instances of an equity bubble are the Tulip Mania, Bitcoin, and the dot-com bubble. 

===Debt bubble===
A debt bubble is characterised by intangible or credit based investments with little ability to satisfy growing demand in a non-existent market. These bubbles are not backed by real assets and are based on frivolous lending in the hope of returning a profit or security. These bubbles usually end in debt deflation causing bank runs or a currency crisis when the government can no longer maintain the fiat currency. Examples are the Roaring Twenties stock market bubble (which caused the Great Depression) and the United States housing bubble (which caused the Great Recession).

==Impact==
The impact of economic bubbles is debated within and between schools of economic thought; they are not generally considered beneficial, but it is debated how harmful their formation and bursting is.

Within mainstream economics, many believe that bubbles cannot be identified in advance, cannot be prevented from forming, that attempts to &quot;prick&quot; the bubble may cause financial crisis, and that instead authorities should wait for bubbles to burst of their own accord, dealing with the aftermath via monetary policy and fiscal policy.

Political economist Robert E. Wright argues that bubbles can be identified before the fact with high confidence.

In addition, the crash which usually follows an economic bubble can destroy a large amount of wealth and cause continuing economic malaise; this view is particularly associated with the debt-deflation theory of Irving Fisher, and elaborated within Post-Keynesian economics.

A protracted period of low risk premiums can simply prolong the downturn in asset price deflation, as was the case of the Great Depression in the 1930s for much of the world and the 1990s for Japan. Not only can the aftermath of a crash devastate the economy of a nation, but its effects can also reverberate beyond its borders.

=== Effect upon spending ===
Another important aspect of economic bubbles is their impact on spending habits. Market participants with overvalued assets tend to spend more because they &quot;feel&quot; richer (the wealth effect). Many observers quote the housing market in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Spain and parts of the United States in recent times, as an example of this effect. When the bubble inevitably bursts, those who hold on to these overvalued assets usually experience a feeling of reduced wealth and tend to cut discretionary spending at the same time, hindering economic growth or, worse, exacerbating the economic slowdown.

In an economy with a central bank, the bank may therefore attempt to keep an eye on asset price appreciation and take measures to curb high levels of speculative activity in financial assets. This is usually done by increasing the interest rate (that is, the cost of borrowing money). Historically, this is not the only approach taken by central banks. It has been argued that they should stay out of it and let the bubble, if it is one, take its course.

==In economics==
Investor George Soros, influenced by ideas put forward by his tutor, Karl Popper (1957), has been an active promoter of the relevance of reflexivity to economics, first propounding it publicly in his 1987 book &quot;The alchemy of finance&quot;. He regards his insights into market behaviour from applying the principle as a major factor in the success of his financial career.

Reflexivity is inconsistent with general equilibrium theory, which stipulates that markets move towards equilibrium and that non-equilibrium fluctuations are merely random noise that will soon be corrected. In equilibrium theory, prices in the long run at equilibrium reflect the underlying economic fundamentals, which are unaffected by prices. Reflexivity asserts that prices do in fact influence the fundamentals and that these newly influenced sets of fundamentals then proceed to change expectations, thus influencing prices; the process continues in a self-reinforcing pattern. Because the pattern is self-reinforcing, markets tend towards disequilibrium. Sooner or later they reach a point where the sentiment is reversed and negative expectations become self-reinforcing in the downward direction, thereby explaining the familiar pattern of boom and bust cycles. An example Soros cites is the procyclical nature of lending, that is, the willingness of banks to ease lending standards for real estate loans when prices are rising, then raising standards when real estate prices are falling, reinforcing the boom and bust cycle. He further suggests that property price inflation is essentially a reflexive phenomenon: house prices are influenced by the sums that banks are prepared to advance for their purchase, and these sums are determined by the banks&#x27; estimation of the prices that the property would command.

Soros has often claimed that his grasp of the principle of reflexivity is what has given him his &quot;edge&quot; and that it is the major factor contributing to his successes as a trader. For several decades there was little sign of the principle being accepted in mainstream economic circles, but there has been an increase of interest following the crash of 2008, with academic journals, economists, and investors discussing his theories.

Economist and former columnist of the &quot;Financial Times,&quot; Anatole Kaletsky, argued that Soros&#x27; concept of reflexivity is useful in understanding China&#x27;s economy and how the Chinese government manages it.

Eugene Fama, the Nobel laureate in economics who has often been described as &quot;the father of modern finance&quot;, has expressed skepticism about the notion that economic bubbles can be identified. He argues that for something to be a bubble, its ending needs to be predicted in real time, not just after the fact. He argues that conventional rhetoric about bubbles proposes no testable propositions and no ways to measure a bubble.

==Causes==
It has also been variously suggested that bubbles may be rational, intrinsic, and contagious. To date, there is no widely accepted theory to explain their occurrence. Recent computer-generated agency models suggest excessive leverage could be a key factor in causing financial bubbles.

Puzzlingly for some, bubbles occur even in highly predictable experimental markets, where uncertainty is eliminated and market participants should be able to calculate the intrinsic value of the assets simply by examining the expected stream of dividends. Nevertheless, bubbles have been observed repeatedly in experimental markets, even with participants such as business students, managers, and professional traders. Experimental bubbles have proven robust to a variety of conditions, including short-selling, margin buying, and insider trading.

While there is no clear agreement on what causes bubbles, there is evidence to suggest that they are not caused by bounded rationality or assumptions about the irrationality of others, as assumed by greater fool theory. It has also been shown that bubbles appear even when market participants are well capable of pricing assets correctly. Further, it has been shown that bubbles appear even when speculation is not possible or when over-confidence is absent.

More recent theories of asset bubble formation suggest that they are likely sociologically-driven events, thus explanations that merely involve fundamental factors or snippets of human behavior are incomplete at best. For instance, qualitative researchers Preston Teeter and Jorgen Sandberg argue that market speculation is driven by culturally-situated narratives that are deeply embedded in and supported by the prevailing institutions of the time. They cite factors such as bubbles forming during periods of innovation, easy credit, loose regulations, and internationalized investment as reasons why narratives play such an influential role in the growth of asset bubbles.

===Liquidity===
One possible cause of bubbles is excessive monetary liquidity in the financial system, inducing lax or inappropriate standards of lending by the banks, which makes markets vulnerable to volatile asset price inflation caused by short-term, leveraged speculation. For example, Axel A. Weber, the former president of the Deutsche Bundesbank, has argued that &quot;The past has shown that an overly generous provision of liquidity in global financial markets in connection with a very low level of interest rates promotes the formation of asset-price bubbles.&quot;

According to the explanation, excessive monetary liquidity (easy credit, large disposable incomes) potentially occurs while fractional reserve banks are implementing expansionary monetary policy (i.e. lowering of interest rates and flushing the financial system with money supply); this explanation may differ in certain details according to economic philosophy. Those who believe the money supply is controlled exogenously by a central bank may attribute an &#x27;expansionary monetary policy&#x27; to that bank and (should one exist) a governing body or institution; others who believe that the money supply is created endogenously by the banking sector may attribute such a &#x27;policy&#x27; to the behavior of the financial sector itself, and view the state as a passive or reactive factor. This may determine how central or relatively minor/inconsequential policies like fractional reserve banking and the central bank&#x27;s efforts to raise or lower short-term interest rates are to one&#x27;s view on the creation, inflation and ultimate implosion of an economic bubble. Explanations focusing on interest rates tend to take on a common form, however: when interest rates are set excessively low (regardless of the mechanism by which that is accomplished) investors tend to avoid putting their capital into savings accounts. Instead, investors tend to leverage their capital by borrowing from banks and invest the leveraged capital in financial assets such as stocks and real estate. Risky leveraged behavior like speculation and Ponzi schemes can lead to an increasingly fragile economy, and may also be part of what pushes asset prices artificially upward until the bubble pops.

Economic bubbles often occur when too much money is chasing too few assets, causing both good assets and bad assets to appreciate excessively beyond their fundamentals to an unsustainable level. Once the bubble bursts, the fall in prices causes the collapse of unsustainable investment schemes (especially speculative and/or Ponzi investments, but not exclusively so), which leads to a crisis of consumer (and investor) confidence that may result in a financial panic and/or financial crisis. If there is a monetary authority like a central bank, it may take measures to soak up the liquidity in the financial system in an attempt to prevent a collapse of its currency. This may involve actions like bailouts of the financial system, but also others that reverse the trend of monetary accommodation, commonly termed forms of &#x27;contractionary monetary policy&#x27;.

These measures may include raising interest rates, which tends to make investors become more risk averse and thus avoid leveraged capital because the costs of borrowing may become too expensive. There may also be countermeasures taken pre-emptively during periods of strong economic growth, such as increasing capital reserve requirements and implementing regulation that checks and/or prevents processes leading to over-expansion and excessive leveraging of debt. Ideally, such countermeasures lessen the impact of a downturn by strengthening financial institutions while the economy is strong.

Advocates of perspectives stressing the role of credit money in an economy often refer to (such) bubbles as &quot;credit bubbles&quot;, and look at such measures of financial leverage as debt-to-GDP ratios to identify bubbles. Typically the collapse of any economic bubble results in an economic contraction termed (if less severe) a recession or (if more severe) a depression; what economic policies to follow in reaction to such a contraction is a hotly debated perennial topic of political economy.

===Psychology===

====Greater fool theory====

Greater fool theory states that bubbles are driven by the behavior of perennially optimistic market participants (the fools) who buy overvalued assets in anticipation of selling it to other speculators (the greater fools) at a much higher price. According to this explanation, the bubbles continue as long as the fools can find greater fools to pay up for the overvalued asset. The bubbles will end only when the greater fool becomes the greatest fool who pays the top price for the overvalued asset and can no longer find another buyer to pay for it at a higher price. This theory is popular among laity but has not yet been fully confirmed by empirical research.

====Extrapolation====

Extrapolation is projecting historical data into the future on the same basis; if prices have risen at a certain rate in the past, they will continue to rise at that rate forever. The argument is that investors tend to extrapolate past extraordinary returns on investment of certain assets into the future, causing them to overbid those risky assets in order to attempt to continue to capture those same rates of return.

Overbidding on certain assets will at some point result in uneconomic rates of return for investors; only then the asset price deflation will begin. When investors feel that they are no longer well compensated for holding those risky assets, they will start to demand higher rates of return on their investments.

====Herding====
Another related explanation used in behavioral finance lies in herd behavior, the fact that investors tend to buy or sell in the direction of the market trend. This is sometimes helped by technical analysis that tries precisely to detect those trends and follow them, which creates a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Investment managers, such as stock mutual fund managers, are compensated and retained in part due to their performance relative to peers. Taking a conservative or contrarian position as a bubble builds results in performance unfavorable to peers. This may cause customers to go elsewhere and can affect the investment manager&#x27;s own employment or compensation. The typical short-term focus of U.S. equity markets exacerbates the risk for investment managers that do not participate during the building phase of a bubble, particularly one that builds over a longer period of time. In attempting to maximize returns for clients and maintain their employment, they may rationally participate in a bubble they believe to be forming, as the likely shorter-term benefits of doing so outweigh the likely longer-term risks.

====Moral hazard====
Moral hazard is the prospect that a party insulated from risk may behave differently from the way it would behave if it were fully exposed to the risk. A person&#x27;s belief that they are responsible for the consequences of their own actions is an essential aspect of rational behavior. An investor must balance the possibility of making a return on their investment with the risk of making a loss – the risk-return relationship. A moral hazard can occur when this relationship is interfered with, often via government policy.

A recent example is the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush on 3 October 2008 to provide a government bailout for many financial and non-financial institutions who speculated in high-risk financial instruments during the housing boom condemned by a 2005 story in &quot;The Economist&quot; titled &quot;The worldwide rise in house prices is the biggest bubble in history&quot;. A historical example was intervention by the Dutch Parliament during the great Tulip Mania of 1637.

Other causes of perceived insulation from risk may derive from a given entity&#x27;s predominance in a market relative to other players, and not from state intervention or market regulation. A firm – or several large firms acting in concert (see cartel, oligopoly and collusion) – with very large holdings and capital reserves could instigate a market bubble by investing heavily in a given asset, creating a relative scarcity which drives up that asset&#x27;s price. Because of the signaling power of the large firm or group of colluding firms, the firm&#x27;s smaller competitors will follow suit, similarly investing in the asset due to its price gains.

However, in relation to the party instigating the bubble, these smaller competitors are insufficiently leveraged to withstand a similarly rapid decline in the asset&#x27;s price. When the large firm, cartel or &quot;de facto&quot; collusive body perceives a maximal peak has been reached in the traded asset&#x27;s price, it can then proceed to rapidly sell or &quot;dump&quot; its holdings of this asset on the market, precipitating a price decline that forces its competitors into insolvency, bankruptcy or foreclosure.

The large firm or cartel – which has intentionally leveraged itself to withstand the price decline it engineered – can then acquire the capital of its failing or devalued competitors at a low price as well as capture a greater market share (e.g., via a merger or acquisition which expands the dominant firm&#x27;s distribution chain). If the bubble-instigating party is itself a lending institution, it can combine its knowledge of its borrowers&#x27; leveraging positions with publicly available information on their stock holdings, and strategically shield or expose them to default.

===Other===
Some regard bubbles as related to inflation and thus believe that the causes of inflation are also the causes of bubbles. Others take the view that there is a &quot;fundamental value&quot; to an asset, and that bubbles represent a rise over that fundamental value, which must eventually return to that fundamental value.
There are chaotic theories of bubbles which assert that bubbles come from particular &quot;critical&quot; states in the market based on the communication of economic factors. Finally, others regard bubbles as necessary consequences of irrationally valuing assets solely based upon their returns in the recent past without resorting to a rigorous analysis based on their underlying &quot;fundamentals&quot;.

== Stages ==
According to the economist Charles P. Kindleberger, the basic structure of a speculative bubble can be divided into five phases:
* Displacement: A sufficient external shock to the macroeconomic system, creating new profit opportunities.
* Boom: A rise in asset prices and speculative investments (buy now with sole intention to sell in the future at a higher price and obtain a profit).
* Euphoria: A democratization of speculative investments, and a detachment from real rational valuable objects.
* Financial distress: Prices begin to plateau, investors start considering selling to cover their liabilities.
* Revulsion: prices plummet as investors race to sell first, panic spreads and feeds back on itself.

===Identification===

Economic or asset price bubbles are often characterized by one or more of the following:
# Unusual changes in single measures, or relationships among measures (e.g., ratios) relative to their historical levels. For example, in the housing bubble of the 2000s, the housing prices were unusually high relative to income. For stocks, the price to earnings ratio provides a measure of stock prices relative to corporate earnings; higher readings indicate investors are paying more for each dollar of earnings.
# Elevated usage of debt (leverage) to purchase assets, such as purchasing stocks on margin or homes with a lower down payment.
# Higher risk lending and borrowing behavior, such as originating loans to borrowers with lower credit quality scores (e.g., subprime borrowers), combined with adjustable rate mortgages and &quot;interest-only&quot; loans.
# Rationalizing borrowing, lending, and purchase decisions based on expected future price increases rather than the ability of the borrower to repay.
# Rationalizing asset prices by increasingly weaker arguments, such as &quot;this time it&#x27;s different&quot; or &quot;housing prices only go up.&quot;
# A high presence of marketing or media coverage related to the asset.
# Incentives that place the consequences of bad behavior by one economic actor upon another, such as the origination of mortgages to those with limited ability to repay because the mortgage could be sold or securitized, moving the consequences from the originator to the investor.
# International trade (current account) imbalances, resulting in an excess of savings over investments, increasing the volatility of capital flow among countries. For example, the flow of savings from Asia to the U.S. was one of the drivers of the 2000s housing bubble.
# A lower interest rate environment, which encourages lending and borrowing.

<doc id="140014" wikidata="Q6816492" url="?curid=140014" title="Menasha (town), Wisconsin">
<text>Menasha was a town in Winnebago County, Wisconsin, United States, west of the Fox River across from the city of Menasha, Wisconsin. The population was 18,498 at the 2010 census, making it the second most populous town in the state of Wisconsin at the time of its dissolution. The unincorporated community of Waverly Beach was located partially in the town. In an April 2016 referendum, the portion of the town west of Little Lake Butte des Morts voted to become the village of Fox Crossing. The remaining portions of the town were annexed to Fox Crossing on September 22, 2016, effectively ending the existence of the town.

==History==
The Town of Menasha was officially organized on April 3, 1855, in part from land formerly belonging to the neighboring town of Neenah.

=== Village incorporation ===
Discussion of the Town of Menasha being incorporated into a village began as early as 1979, when the name &quot;Bridgeview&quot; was proposed. A referendum on the matter was brought to residents in 2002 (again with the proposed village name of Bridgeview), which was defeated.

In December 2014, a petition was circulated to incorporate the west side of the town as the Village of Fox Crossing. It needed 50 signatures to file the petition in Winnebago County court; it had received over 200 by March 2015. Town leaders estimate that it would cost $85000 to incorporate and possibly $75000 in legal fees to defend against challenges. An incorporation committee suggested incorporating 10600 residents west of the Fox River followed later by annexing the 7900 residents east of the river.

Incorporation of Fox Crossing as a village, comprising the land west of Little Lake Butte des Morts became final on April 20, 2016. This roughly reduced the area of the Town of Menasha by half. The long term plan after this was finalized was to fold the remaining portions of the Town of Menasha into the new village, assuming there were no objections from remaining town residents.

On August 17, 2016, an agreement was reached between the Village of Fox Crossing and the remaining Town of Menasha to annex all remaining Town of Menasha lands to Fox Crossing. When completed, this would effectively end the existence of the Town of Menasha, on a timeline &quot;on or as soon after the (agreement) as practical&quot;. There were no petitions filed by town residents objecting to this. On September 22, 2016, the Town of Menasha ceased when remaining parts of the town were annexed into Fox Crossing.

==Geography==
The town was located in the northeast corner of Winnebago County and partially surrounds the city of Menasha. It was located at the north end of Lake Winnebago, the outlet of which, the Fox River, flowed through the middle of the town as Little Lake Butte des Morts. The city of Neenah bordered the town to the south, and the town of Clayton lay to the west. To the north and east was Outagamie County, with the city of Appleton to the northeast, and the towns of Grand Chute and Greenville to the north.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town had a total area of , of which was land and , or 12.50%, was water.

==History==
Grand Rapids takes its name from a series of rapids on the Wisconsin River.

The west and north part of what is now Grand Rapids, within three miles of the Wisconsin River, was in the &quot;Indian strip,&quot; sold by the Menominee to the United States government in the 1836 Treaty of the Cedars. As such, it was logged and surveyed early. In the spring of 1840, a crew working for the U.S. government surveyed the section corners of the west and north parts, walking through the woods and crossing the river, measuring with chain and compass. When done, they produced this first description of the area:
&quot;There is hardly any good land in this Township. A succession of Rapids &amp; rocky chutes called the Grand Rapids have two Extensive lumbering Establishments thereon(?) owned by Bloomer Chambalain(?) Adams Strong Hill &amp; others, now in operation - the Hydraulic Power is capable of being increased. Several large Pine Groves are found in this Township.&quot;

In 1851 a different crew surveyed the section corners of the entire town, producing this general description:
&quot;The character of the land varies very considerably in this Town but none of it can rank above thirdrate. The Southern Portion consists of pine barrens, the timber mostly gone &amp; grown up in Blk Oak bushes(?). The timber is principally pine of the variety known as Pitch, Bastard or Blk Pine, of very little use either for fuel or lumber. The north part of the Town is principally Marsh very wet &amp; entirely unfit for cultivation. Large portions of the marshes are covered with Cranberry vines which every alternate year produce large crops.&quot;

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 34.2 square miles (88.7 km2), of which, 34.2 square miles (88.6 km2) is land and 0.03% is water.
Geologists call the prominent range of hills running from Marshfield to Bakerville through Nasonville the &quot;Marshfield moraine&quot;. It is probably a terminal moraine left where a continental glacier stopped advancing long ago. The rest of the town is flatter. The section northwest of the moraine is heavy clay soil on the till plain left by that glacier, with sandstone and granite beneath.

==History==
The six mile square that would become Lincoln was first surveyed in the summer of 1851 by a crew working for the U.S. government.

It is well watered and some of the streams are of sufficient size for Milling purposes The streams are all lined with good W P(?) which is the prevailing Timber. The upland is mostly Sugar &amp; Lind.&quot;

Lincoln Township was originally called &quot;Johnson Township&quot;, and under the latter name was established in March 1868. A few months later, in June 1868, the township was renamed, after President Abraham Lincoln.

When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;This Township is composed of Hardwood Ridges and Hemlock, Tamarac, and Black Ash swamps. All of the swamps are unfit for cultivation although if cleared the Hemlock swamps would produce grass. The surface is level; the Hardwood ridges are but little elevated above the swamps on which the soil is first and second rate. This Township is Heavily timbered chiefly with Hemlock, Yellow Birch, Sugar Maple, Lin(?) and Rock Elm: also considerable White Pine scattered(?) over the Township. There are numerous(?) small creeks in the Township generally lined with alders and some of them have small mashes on them which afford good Hay(?). No improvements in the Township.

<text>Nekoosa is a city in Wood County, Wisconsin, United States. Its name derives from the Ho-Chunk word, &quot;Nįįkuusra&quot;, &quot;Nakrusa&quot;, or &quot;Nįkusara&quot; which translates to &quot;running water&quot;. The population was 2,580 at the 2010 census.

==History==
An article dated March 16, 1916 from the long defunct newspaper &quot;The Nekoosa Tribune&quot; detailing the early history of Nekoosa may be found at the Wisconsin Historical Society web site. It is a letter written by a resident to Nekoosa High School students to support them writing a history term paper.

Point Basse

&quot;Five rapids covering a distance of about three miles in this area were referred to as Nekoosa (swift water) by the Chippewa Indians, who made their campground on high Swallow Rock overlooking the rapids. Wakeley&#x27;s tavern served as a rendezvous and resting place for the river traveler and lumber raftsman. Wakeley&#x27;s was the nucleus for the development of a settlement named Point Basse (low point). The name was later changed to Nekoosa.

The settlement became a key town during the colorful era when lumber was rafted down the river from the pineries of the North to Mississippi River markets.

Daniel Whitney built the first sawmill on the Wisconsin River here at Whitney&#x27;s Rapids in 1831 making Nekoosa the birthplace of Wood County. From this first harnessing of the river&#x27;s power developed scores of power facilities making the Wisconsin River the hardest worked river in the world.&quot; [Point Basse historical marker, erected 1963]

<text>The Town of Remington is located in Wood County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 305 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated community of Babcock is located in the town.

==Geography==

The Town of Remington is a rectangle, 12 miles east to west by 6 miles north to south. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 71.5 square miles (185.3 km2), of which, 69.4 square miles (179.6 km2) of it is land and 2.2 square miles (5.6 km2) of it (3.05%) is water.

==History==

In the spring of 1839 the southern side of the Town of Remington was surveyed, early because it was within three miles of the Wisconsin River, touching the &quot;Indian strip&quot; which was sold by the Menominee to the U.S. government in the 1836 Treaty of the Cedars.

In the winter of 1851–1852 a crew working for the U.S. government surveyed all the section corners of the six mile square that would become the east half of the town, walking through the woods and probably crossing the marshes on the ice, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description of the east half of the town:
&quot;The surface of this Township is level, swamp excepting a narrow strip of land of about 40 Chains in width on either bank of the Yellow river which is gently(?) raised(?), and dry(?) being drained(?) by small Brooks leading from the swamps in the area(?) of River, South of Hemlock Creek, and East of Yellow River the principal part of the land is open Marsh. North of Hemlock Creek, and East of River low and Wet land and might be rendered fit for cultivation, by clearing off the Timber and very thick crop of underbrush. West of Yellow River the land is principally Tamarack swamp and no one section could be made cultivable without draining(?). Timber. North of Hemlock creek and West of Yellow River is principally 2d rate Pine &amp; Tamarack. Stand(?) thick, underbrush, very thick with alders(?), small Pine and Witch-hazel. Wards Mill &amp; improvements near center of Sec. 27.&quot;

The Town of Remington was established in 1868, and named for the now-extinct community called Remington within the town&#x27;s borders.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 305 people, 125 households, and 83 families residing in the town. The population density was 4.4 people per square mile (1.7/km2). There were 179 housing units at an average density of 2.6 per square mile (1.0/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 95.08% White, 1.31% African American, 1.64% Native American, 0.33% Asian, and 1.64% from two or more races.

There were 125 households, out of which 24.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.0% were married couples living together, 7.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.6% were non-families. 28.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.44 and the average family size was 2.99.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 23.0% under the age of 18, 6.9% from 18 to 24, 26.6% from 25 to 44, 26.6% from 45 to 64, and 17.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 41 years. For every 100 females, there were 102.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 106.1 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $37,188, and the median income for a family was $46,250. Males had a median income of $28,750 versus $21,458 for females. The per capita income for the town was $16,571. About 3.9% of families and 7.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including none of those under the age of eighteen and 24.4% of those 65 or over.

<text>The Town of Richfield is located in Wood County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,523 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated community of Bethel is located within the town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 34.8 square miles (90.2 km2), of which, 34.8 square miles (90.1 km2) of it is land and 0.04 square miles (0.1 km2) of it (0.11%) is water.
The Yellow River cuts across the town, heading to join the Wisconsin at Castle Rock Lake. Puff Creek feeds into the Yellow River. Much of the land is fairly low-profile except in the southeast around Bethel.

==History==
Before white contact, the area that would become Richfield lay near the border of Ojibwe, Ho-Chunk and Menominee territory.

The six by six mile square that would become Richfield was first surveyed in the summer of 1851 by a crew working for the U.S. government. In October 1851 a different crew of surveyors marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and swamps, measuring with chain and compass.

An 1858 map of Wood County showed a &quot;County Road&quot; following the future course of U.S. 10 to the northwest corner of what would become Richfield and headed southeast to Grand Rapids. Part way through the town, a predecessor of Puff Creek Boulevard branched off heading south to some mills downstream on the Yellow River, including Pitt&#x27;s Mill - the forerunner of Pittsville.

The Town of Richfield was established in 1881.

By around 1893, parts of the town were filling in with settlers. A predecessor of County A reached from the south end of the town to near the north end, with a predecessor of N heading east to Arpin. A predecessor of EE was in place, and some other segments in the north and west. Settlers were sprinkled along the roads and schools were shown near the future Bethel, a mile south of the future Richfield center, and where EE would meet A and 13. Away from the roads, much of the land was still in large blocks, owned by outfits like Lyman Lumber Co, Necedah Lumber Co, Johnson, Reitbrock &amp; Halsey, and John Arpin Lumber Co.

A map from around 1902 shows the modern road grid largely complete, with only one or two-mile segments missing here and there. These were dusty wagon roads - not the raised, paved roads of today. Settler/farmers were thick in the northwest and in the southeast around Bethel. A post office was marked at Bethel on the plat map, along with Woodland Academy. A town hall was marked at the site of Richfield&#x27;s modern town hall, with a creamery across the road. Another creamery was just outside Richfield at Klondike corners. A church had been added at the junction of the future EE and Washington. Much of the large blocks of land had been divided and sold to farmers, though Reitbrock still held some large chunks. Two railroads crossed the northeast corner of Richfield, running from Wisconsin Rapids to Marshfield: the Wisconsin Central and the Chicago &amp; Northwestern.

The 1909 plat map showed some details of the buildings at Bethel Academy, and noted a blacksmith shop a mile to the east. New schools had appeared where modern 80 meets N and where modern T meets EE.

The 1920 plat map showed more of the same pattern: lots of 80 and 40-acre farms, more roads, and smaller lots around Bethel. The road that would become County N didn&#x27;t cross the Yellow River, and the future T still had a gap north of Bethel.

By the 1956 plat map the modern road grid was complete and the Bethel Academy had been replaced by &quot;Bethel Conv. Home.&quot;

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 1,523 people, 473 households, and 383 families residing in the town. The population density was 43.8 people per square mile (16.9/km2). There were 485 housing units at an average density of 13.9 per square mile (5.4/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 98.03% White, 0.13% African American, 0.13% Native American, 1.64% Asian, and 0.07% from two or more races.

There were 473 households, out of which 41.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 71.7% were married couples living together, 5.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 19.0% were non-families. 14.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.98 and the average family size was 3.26.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 27.8% under the age of 18, 6.5% from 18 to 24, 29.1% from 25 to 44, 21.2% from 45 to 64, and 15.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 100.7 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $47,188, and the median income for a family was $51,765. Males had a median income of $30,338 versus $24,643 for females. The per capita income for the town was $18,775. About 4.5% of families and 8.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 11.1% of those under age 18 and 4.6% of those age 65 or over.

In 1851 a different crew surveyed the section lines. For the six mile square township that now is the western part of the town, see their description under Port Edwards. For the eastern township they gave this general description:

<text>The Town of Seneca is located in Wood County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,202 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 32.4 square miles (84.0 km2), of which, 32.2 square miles (83.5 km2) of it is land and 0.2 square miles (0.5 km2) of it (0.59%) is water.

==History==
The east end of the town, within three miles of the Wisconsin River, was in the &quot;Indian strip,&quot; sold by the Menominee to the U.S. government in the 1836 Treaty of the Cedars. As such, it was logged and surveyed early. In 1839 a crew working for the U.S. government surveyed what would become the east and south edges of the town, walking through the woods and crossing the river, measuring with chain and compass. In 1851 a different crew surveyed the section lines of the town, producing this general description:
&quot;The East &amp; South East portion of this Town consists of alternate ridges of pine barrens and Tamarack Swamps. There is a small portion of land near the river that is tolerably fair but the bottoms on the river are worthless(?) owing to their being overflowed nearly every year. The West &amp; north parts of the Town consist of a portion of the great Cranberry Marsh which extends to &amp; beyond Yellow river. The Marsh is wet &amp; unfit for cultivation &amp; has upon it small Islands (so called) of hard land with a few trees; Scattering Pines, Tamarack &amp; Blk Oak are found nearly all over it so much so that we almost invariably found bearing trees for our corners. The Marsh may be valuable for the Cranberries which it produces abundantly but otherwise is entirely(?) worthless(?).&quot;

The Town of Seneca took its name from the now-extinct hamlet of Seneca, which was located within its borders.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 1,202 people, 408 households, and 330 families residing in the town. The population density was 37.3 people per square mile (14.4/km2).

The racial makeup of the town was 90.68% White, 5.99% Native American, 2.33% Asian, and 1.00% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.92% of the population.

There were 408 households, out of which 38.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 71.1% were married couples living together, 6.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 18.9% were non-families. 14.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.94 and the average family size was 3.27.

<text>The Town of Sherry is located in Wood County, Wisconsin, United States. The population of the town was 809 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated community known as Sherry is located at the junction of County Highways N and F west-southwest of Milladore., within the Town of Sherry.

==History==
In June 1851 the six mile (10 km) square which later became the town of Sherry was surveyed by crews working for the U.S. government. They found the section corners with chain and compass and marked them. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;This Township is heavily Timbered with Maple Oak Birch &amp; Pine Maple Oak &amp; Birch being the prevailing Kinds - along the Border(?) of Mill Creek there is some good scattering Pine - along the Border(?) of the small stream (?) almost invariably(?) find alder thickets caused by Beaver dams. - the streams are fed by the swamp, and are subject to very sudden rise &amp; fall - the soil is a dark loam is well adapted for the purpose of agriculture. the Surface is generally level &amp; is covered with stone the stone being of a reddish color&quot;

In 1880 Henry Sherry and a partner named Briggs started a sawmill on Mill Creek, with a company store, which attracted workers and grew into a community. With various partners, Sherry continued running the sawmill and added a planing mill and a factory that made barrel staves. The community also had a blacksmith in those early years. Sherry&#x27;s first school was started in 1881. A post office called Sherry was established in 1884, and remained in operation until 1968.
Henry Sherry was not a local, but instead lived in Neenah. He was a flour miller&#x27;s son who operated a sawmill there and ended up owning many sawmills in the 1880s along with the one in Sherry: Oshkosh, Fond du Lac, Centralia, Auburndale, Milladore, Vesper, Marshfield, Aniwa, Kent, Mineral Lake, and Park Falls.

The town (6x6 miles) of Sherry was established in 1885, taking its name from the community located within its borders.

The unincorporated community known as Sherry was platted in 1899.

Sherry&#x27;s Presbyterian congregation formed around 1900 and built its brick church in 1903. The German Lutherans built their church one year later. In 1906 some Presbyterians started the Northwest Collegiate Institute, a Christian secondary school, on a 500-acre farm along Mill Creek. The students could work on the farm to pay their tuition. This school ran until 1921.

As of 1923, the village included two general stores, a hotel, a garage, a cheese factory, and a real estate office. A stage ran from Sherry village two miles to the railroad station at Blenker twice a day.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 35.4 square miles (91.6 km2), of which, 35.3 square miles (91.3 km2) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.3 km2) of it (0.34%) is water.

<text>Th Town of Sigel is located in Wood County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,130 at the 2000 census. The unincorporated community of Eight Corners is located in the town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 35.5 square miles (92.0 km2), of which, 35.5 square miles (92.0 km2) of it is land and 0.03% is water.

==History==
In 1839 a crew working for the U.S. government surveyed the south border of the six mile square that would become the town of Sigel. In June 1851 another crew came back and surveyed the east and west sides. That November another crew marked all the section corners, walking through the woods and wading the swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;The character of this Township is good, particularly the North Eastern part there is some good farming Lands the timber being mostly Sugar Elm Ironwood + Birch the Southern + Western part is generally of a 2d rate quality the timber being mostly Birch Pine soft Maple Ash etc the streams are fed by the swamps &amp; are not durable. there is some good scattering Pine mixed in with the Hard wood but no heavy Bodies of Pine were seen in this Township - the surface is generally level &amp; somewhat stony. the stone being of reddish color&quot;

The town of Sigel was established in 1863, and named after Franz Sigel, an officer in the Civil War.

==Demographics==

<text>Vesper is a village in Wood County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 584 at the 2010 census.

==History==

The village of Vesper began to form in the early 1850s with the first settlers. In the 1870&#x27;s, Girard and Drake built a sawmill on Hemlock Creek to process lumber from the surrounding forests. Their firm also started a store and blacksmith shop. A post office opened in 1878. The first postmaster, James Cameron, sent a letter to the federal department naming new towns. A letter came back with the name &quot;Vesper.&quot; The village was named after vesper sparrows native to the area. In 1894 a wildfire swept in from the woods and burned the mill, along with 23 houses on the west side of the creek.

After the fire, the surrounding stump-land was sold to farmers. The village of Vesper was on 100 acres now owned by Benson and Anderton. It was platted in 1897 by . Carsten Otto started a creamery in 1898. In 1902 John Murgatroyd &amp; Sons started the Vesper Brick &amp; Tile Factory, which operated until the start of WWI. A two-room brick school was built in 1906. In 1907 The Vesper Wood Manufacturing Company began making stave silos and watering tanks out of wood. The State Bank of Vesper opened in 1911. The village incorporated in 1948.

<text>Wisconsin Rapids is a city in and the county seat of Wood County, Wisconsin, United States, along the Wisconsin River. The population was 18,877 at the 2020 census. It is a principal city of the Marshfield–Wisconsin Rapids micropolitan statistical area, which includes all of Wood County and had a population of 74,207 in 2020.

The city was established in the late 1830s as the series of rapids along the Wisconsin River provided good sites for water-driven sawmills, and nearby forests held pine lumber to be sawed and floated down the river. After the lumber dwindled, the waterpower drove electric generators and various other enterprises–particularly paper mills.

==History==
===Establishment===
The Menominee claimed the big rapids in the forest prior to European settlement, with Ojibwe and Ho-Chunk lands nearby. They called the place &quot;Ah-dah-wah-gam&quot; meaning &quot;Two-sided Rapids&quot; because the rapids were split by a large chunk of rock. In 1836, the Menominee ceded this land, along with more land to the east, to the U.S. in the Treaty of the Cedars. This particular land cession was a strip spanning three miles on either side of the Wisconsin River, starting at Point Basse and reaching upstream to Big Bull Falls – the future site of Wausau. The U.S. negotiators pressed the Menominee for this strip before the surrounding lands because it held prime pine timber and was within easy reach of the river. 

In 1832, Daniel Whitney had built a sawmill downstream, across from modern Nekoosa. Whitney&#x27;s operation demonstrated the feasibility of rafting lumber to markets downstream. When the treaty of 1836 made the strip along the Wisconsin River available, lumbermen rushed in exploring for mill sites, and by 1839 (when Wisconsin was still a territory) two water-powered sawmills were running at the future Wisconsin Rapids, when a surveyor described the site as a &quot;succession of rapids &amp; chutes called the Grand Rapids&quot;, with two &quot;extensive lumbering establishments thereon owned by Bloomer, Chamberlain, Adams, Strong, Hill &amp; others, now in operation.&quot;

The first house in Rapids was a small log cabin built by H. McCutcheon, a cook for Strong and Bloomer&#x27;s mill. The second came soon after when Nelson Strong built a frame house for himself with boards sawed at his mill - the first frame house in Rapids, built in 1838. Rapids&#x27; first church services were conducted by visiting Catholic priests in 1837. In 1842 a Methodist missionary J.S. Hurlburt began ministering too, visiting homes by foot or horseback. He also started a primary school in a log cabin in the early 1840s. The first hotel came in 1843 and the first blacksmith shop in 1844. A post office named Grand Rapids opened in 1845, with mail carried in once a week. Pioneer J.L. Cotey later wrote an account of the early sawmill town as it stood in 1846. He described a community of &quot;130 males and 17 females,&quot; with businesses along a slough crossed by a temporary slab bridge, frame homes and log houses and barns, picturesque pine trees, a sawmill with two up-and-down saws, boarding houses and saloons for the workers at the mills, and a stopping place for loggers headed upstream. Across the river on the west side was another sawmill, three frame houses for the men who worked in the sawmill, two shingle shanties, and a block house. At that time supplies were hauled overland to Rapids by ox and wagon from Galena, which took three weeks. (The Jones reference gives Cotey&#x27;s full account.)

The business of this ramshackle wilderness outpost was lumber. In the 6-mile strip along the river, lumberjacks working from winter logging camps felled the prized pine trees. They limbed the trees and cut them into 12 to 18-foot logs, then skidded the logs with oxen and horses to rivers and stream banks where they were stored until spring. During spring floods the logs were driven downstream, and, if all went well, captured in booms of the sawmills at Grand Rapids. The sawmills pulled the logs in and sawed them into boards. Some of the boards went into drying piles for local use, but the majority were destined for distant markets like Portage, Dubuque, and St. Louis. These were stacked along the river, then bound into 16 by 16-foot &quot;cribs&quot; of boards. When the river was running well (generally spring) six or seven of these cribs were joined into a &quot;rapids piece&quot; - a 100-foot long, flexible raft suited to running the rocky rapids of the upper Wisconsin River. Of those rapids, Grand Rapids was one of the most dangerous. Before today&#x27;s placid, flat reservoir, the river surged through a series of rapids a mile long, and rafts had to run when the water was high. In early years that passage was aided by wing dams to focus the current; in later years dams across the river provided chutes for the rafts to plunge down, with spectators watching from the bank. The rafts that succeeded in passing the rapids regrouped at Point Basse and joined three of the rapids-piece rafts side by side into a &quot;Wisconsin raft&quot; for the rest of the Wisconsin River, which was less turbulent. Then at the Mississippi the Wisconsin rafts were joined into huge &quot;Mississippi rafts&quot; for the final leg to Dubuque or St. Louis.

In 1848 another treaty with Indians opened most of northern Wisconsin to loggers and settlers, which allowed access to much more timber outside the three-mile strip along the river. In 1856 Grand Rapids became the county seat of the new Wood County when it was split out of Portage County. The town was growing. A promotional booklet in 1857 reported Grand Rapids&#x27; population at about 1,000. It reported eight sawmills from Grand Rapids down to Point Basse, plus six steam-powered mills - all producing 19 million board feet of lumber per year, plus around 42 million shingles. Rapids consisted of 187 buildings including homes and a Catholic church, two public schools, a drug store, five general stores, six variety stores, five taverns (probably meaning inns), two saloons, two lawyers, three blacksmiths, two carpenter shops, two shoe shops, a wagonmakers&#x27; shop, two tailors, a cabinet maker, a bakery, two lawyers and two doctors. In 1857 the first newspaper began publication - the &quot;Wood County Reporter&quot;. Mrs. Clarice Arpin later gave her impression of the town when she arrived about 1859: &quot;a rough lumbering town, filled with lumberjacks who engaged in many drunken brawls, and Indians, who when they had an over-supply of firewater yelled and danced in the middle of the streets.&quot;

The first plat of part of the Rapids had been made in 1847, with others following. Growth slowed during the American Civil War, when some of the workers left to fight in the Union Army. A bad flood in 1864 and a fire in the business district in 1865 were other setbacks. In 1869 Grand Rapids incorporated as a city. Its first order of business was to require a license to sell liquor. Shortly after, city officials were elected, including Dr. G.F. Witter to &quot;doctor city poor for the sum of $75 per year.&quot; A ban on selling liquor on Sunday was passed, and a ban on running hogs loose in the city.

Centralia, a somewhat separate community on the west side of the river, had been developing too. George Kline Sr. had built a sawmill there around 1839. By 1855 Centralia had two sawmills, a gristmill, a general store, a tavern, and houses and shacks. In the 1850s a ferry carried people across the river between Centralia and Grand Rapids. In the 1860s a wooden bridge was added across the river. A &quot;town of Centralia&quot; was formalized in 1856, perhaps to avoid annexation by Grand Rapids. In 1874 Centralia was incorporated as a city.

===Late 19th century===
The railroad boom burst upon Rapids in the 1870s. In 1870 the nearest railroad was at New Lisbon, with mail carried from there daily by evening stage. In 1872 the Green Bay and Lake Pepin Railroad reached Rapids itself, heading west. In 1873 the Wisconsin Valley Railway arrived from Tomah. The Port Edwards, Centralia &amp; Northern was built by local interests in 1890, and the Chicago &amp; Northwestern line to Marshfield in 1901.

With the arrival of the railroads, the transport of lumber from the area began to shift from the unpredictable and dangerous river to more reliable railcars, which could carry the lumber in more directions than downstream. The last rafts of lumber passed through in 1888, from the sawmill at Biron heading downriver for St. Louis.

In June of 1880 an unusually high flood of the river forced many businesses to evacuate their stock to higher ground, and in some cases tie buildings down with ropes. Nevertheless, several buildings were swept into the river and one hardware store partner drowned while trying to save his goods. By that year Grand Rapids had 1,367 people and Centralia 800. As pine timber ran out in the vicinity of Grand Rapids, manufacturers took root in Centralia. Around 1880, the big ones were Robb&#x27;s machine shops, Mackinnon &amp; Griffith&#x27;s hub and spoke factory, Wharton Brothers&#x27; planing mill, Haertel&#x27;s chair factory, Bremmer&#x27;s machine shop and foundry, a flouring mill, Moore&#x27;s wagon works, and Lyon Bros. shingle works. In 1887 the first pulp mill was built, which would develop into Centralia Pulp and Paper.

Paper-making was a big new industry for Rapids. Paper had been made over in the Fox River valley for decades, but not on the Wisconsin River. Around 1885 some of the mills at Rapids - formerly sawmills and gristmills - began converting to pulp-grinding and paper-making. By 1902, after many acquisitions, J.D. Witter and Nels Johnson had organized the many mills and water rights under one corporation - Consolidated Water Power Company. They decided to focus their resources on paper-making. The founders both died shortly after, leaving Witter&#x27;s son-in-law George Mead to manage the new enterprise. The main plant began with 14 pulp-grinders and two papermaking machines, producing 50 tons of paper per day.
Other diversification of the industrial base away from lumber occurred from 1880 to 1920, including the Grand Rapids Brick Company, the Grand Rapids Foundry Co., Wisconsin Ice Machine Co., Prentiss-Wabers Stove Co., Oberback Brothers furniture company, Badger Box &amp; Lumber, Grand Rapids Brewing, Samson Canning, Citizens Factory Company (a pickling co-op), Blommer Ice Cream, and Chambers Creamery. These last four resulted from farmers settling in the surrounding cut-over lands, which were also transitioning from the logging era.

Modern public services began to take shape around the turn of the century. Fire departments were formalized in Centralia in 1887 and in Rapids the following year. At this time that meant a hook-and-ladder, a chemical fire suppression apparatus, and a steam pumping engine. The T.B. Scott Library was started in 1889 with a donation from one of the city&#x27;s pioneers. In 1890 John Arpin installed an electric dynamo in his home - the first electric service in Rapids. In 1894 Mack and Spencer added a generator at their dam which offered electricity to the public. The Wood County Telephone Company was a member-owned cooperative started in 1895. 

===20th century to present===
In 1900 the cities of Grand Rapids and Centralia merged into one city named Grand Rapids. Prior to the merger, Grand Rapids had a population of 1,702 and Centralia 1,425. The name of the merged city was changed in 1920 to &quot;Wisconsin Rapids&quot;, after years of mail and other goods being misdirected to the much better known Grand Rapids, Michigan. In 1904 a small purpose-built hospital opened, to take over from the previous location over the Otto drug store; it was replaced in 1916 by the first Riverside Hospital - a 30-bed brick facility. Parks along the river began development with Lyon Park in 1909. The same year, a private &quot;street railroad&quot; company was organized, which ran a street car line eight miles from the west side of Rapids down to Port Edwards and Nekoosa. To lure riders, it built a dance pavilion north of Nekoosa. A municipal pool was built in 1913, pushed by John Arpin in response to regular drownings of swimmers in the river.

The city added an airport in 1928. During the Great Depression, Consolidated Papers reduced its work week to four days to share existing work across more workers and avoid layoffs. Consolidated also began producing coated papers more efficiently, with their output used to print Life Magazine.

During World War II, many locals volunteered to fight overseas, and some died. Back in Rapids, people grew victory gardens, collected scrap metal for the war effort, and rationed coffee and petroleum. Consolidated adapted to manufacture plastic aircraft materials, and Harvard Clothing made coats for the army.

In the 1970s corner groceries were disappearing, replaced by supermarkets. A number of old properties on the west side were torn down and replaced with the new Rapids Mall. The Riverview Expressway was built.

In the 1980s, Consolidated was the largest producer of enamel papers in the world and a Fortune 500 company. But after those glory years, paper use dropped as TV and computer screens replaced magazines and newspapers. Starting in 2000, Consolidated was bought and then sold by outside companies that eventually filed for bankruptcy, leading to closure of the mill in Rapids in 2020. Remaining large employers are Riverview Hospital and Renaissance Learning.

<text>The Town of Wood is located in Wood County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 786 at the 2000 census.

This town is sometime mistaken for the discontinued post office of Wood, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin (zip code 53193) that served the Veterans Administration Medical Center near Milwaukee (current address 5000 West National Ave. Milwaukee, WI 53295).

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 33.3 square miles (86.4 km2), of which, 33.3 square miles (86.3 km2) of it is land and 0.04 square miles (0.1 km2) of it (0.12%) is water.

==History==
In the summer of 1851 a crew working for the U.S. government surveyed the outline of the six mile square that would become Wood. That November another crew marked all the section corners, walking through the woods and wading the swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;There is very little good land in this Township it may be considered as 2d rate the timber is generall good except the Pine although there is some good Pine along the Banks of Yellow River mixed in with hard timber the surface is generall level &amp; somewhat stony particularly near(?) Yellow River which passes over almost entirely a Bed of Rocks the stone are a Reddish sandstone the timber is of various Kinds, such as Birch Pine Maple Linn Elm Tamarack etc(?) the small streams are fed by the swamp and are not durable the Saw Mills under process of Erection are probably worth $500 each&quot;.

The town of Wood was larger when it was formed in 1874, but the town of Cary was split off in 1901. The town was then called the town of New Wood for a few months until the name was changed back.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 786 people, 285 households, and 222 families residing in the town. The population density was 23.6 people per square mile (9.1/km2). There were 309 housing units at an average density of 9.3 per square mile (3.6/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 99.24% White, 0.13% African American, 0.51% Native American and 0.13% Asian. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.13% of the population.

There were 285 households, out of which 34.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66.3% were married couples living together, 4.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 22.1% were non-families. 16.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 4.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.76 and the average family size was 3.12.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 24.7% under the age of 18, 8.4% from 18 to 24, 27.9% from 25 to 44, 26.1% from 45 to 64, and 13.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females, there were 112.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 116.1 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $44,853, and the median income for a family was $47,955. Males had a median income of $38,333 versus $22,321 for females. The per capita income for the town was $18,534. About 6.4% of families and 6.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 13.4% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.

<text>Centennial is a small mountain-town in Albany County, Wyoming, United States. It serves a fairly large surrounding landscape, along with a few ranches, located along a gently sloping hillside traversed by a highway. Because it has been, since 1980 or later, included in a census-designated place (CDP), bearing the town&#x27;s name, specific demographics characterizing the town itself are not available.

==History==
As the Union Pacific Railroad was pushing west to link up with the Central Pacific Railroad, as part of the First transcontinental railroad, they sent logging crews into the Snowy Range, in the Medicine Bow Mountains, to cut down timber (mainly Lodgepole Pine) for railroad ties. A work camp was built on the site of the town. After they had completed most of their work and the workers started having conflicts with area Native Americans, the crews left the area. After the area was opened to homesteaders a few ranchers returned to the area.

Men working for I. P. Lambing (superintendent at the mine) of Golden, Colorado and Colonel Stephen W. Downey (a lawyer and president of what would become Centennial Gold Mining Company) of Laramie, Wyoming, discovered gold on what would become Centennial Ridge on Centennial Mountain in 1875. As miners and prospectors started coming to the area, to work the Centennial Mine (also called the Downey Lode and Centennial Vein), they reestablished a community on the old work camp site in 1876 and named the town Centennial in honor of the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and founding of the United States. Most of the gold was stripped from the mines by 1877, but the town was now established and merchants who came to serve the miners stayed to serve the nearby ranchers.

On the west side of Centennial Ridge a copper claim was discovered by Jacob Schnitzler in 1896.

Gold had people coming to the area again in 1902, and again in 1923-1924, but no significant amount was ever found. Loggers returned to the area in 1905 to cut timber for a coal mine near Coalmont in Jackson County, Colorado. Acme Consolidated Gold &amp; Mining Company, headed by Isaac Van Horn, bought up timber land around the town, the townsite (Interstate Town Site Company), opened a sawmill, a planing mill and lumber yard, and opened a newspaper, the &quot;Centennial Post&quot;. The partners in Acme Consolidated Gold &amp; Mining Company, Van Horn, Fred A. Miller, and Edward R. Miller, also formed the Laramie, Hahns Peak and Pacific Railway to transport the coal out to eastern markets. The railroad, originating in Laramie, reached Centennial on June 17, 1907 (it would finally reach Coalmont in 1911). That same year a bank was founded.

A. J. Hull, Jesse Northrop, and B. F. Northrop located the Platinum Queen (aka Queen Mine) on September 23, 1923, approximately 2.3 miles southwest of Centennial, on Centennial Ridge. Most activity around the mine area ceased after the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the advent of the Great Depression.

<text>Laramie () is a city in and the county seat of Albany County, Wyoming, United States, known for its high elevation at , railroad history, and is the home of the University of Wyoming. The population was 31,407 at the 2020 census, making it the fourth-most populous city in Wyoming. Located on the Laramie River in southeastern Wyoming, the city is west of Cheyenne and north of the Colorado state line, at the junction of Interstate 80 and U.S. Route 287.

After 12,000 years or more of Indigenous populations living in the area, Laramie was settled by European Americans in 1868 with the completion of the Union Pacific Railroad line to the area, which crosses the Laramie River at Laramie. The river and several creeks fed by freshwater springs made the area an attractive place for settlement. It is home to the University of Wyoming, WyoTech, and a branch of Laramie County Community College. Laramie Regional Airport serves Laramie. The ruins of Fort Sanders, an army fort predating Laramie, lie just south of the city along Route 287. Located in the Laramie Valley between the Snowy Range and the Laramie Range, the city draws outdoor enthusiasts with its abundance of outdoor activities.

== Etymology ==
Laramie is named for Jacques LaRamie, a French or French-Canadian trapper who disappeared in the Laramie Mountains in the early 1820s. He was one of the first Europeans to visit the area. European-American settlers named a river, mountain range, peak, US Army fort, county, and city for him. More Wyoming landmarks are named for him than for any other trapper but Jim Bridger. Because the name was used so frequently, the town was called Laramie City for decades to distinguish it from other uses.

== Founding ==
The city was founded in the mid-1860s as a tent city near the Overland Stage Line route, the Union Pacific portion of the first transcontinental railroad, and just north of Fort Sanders army post. The rails reached Laramie on May 4, 1868, when construction crews worked through town. A few passengers arrived on that same day. The first regular passenger service began on May 10, 1868, by which time entrepreneurs were building more permanent structures. Laramie City (as it was known in early years) soon had stores, houses, a school, and churches. Laramie&#x27;s fame as the western terminal of the Union Pacific Railroad, acquired when the section from North Platte, Nebraska, was opened in May, ended in early August 1868 when a section of track was opened to Benton, east of present-day Sinclair, Wyoming.

The frontier town initially suffered from lawlessness. Its first mayor, M. C. Brown, resigned his office on June 12, 1868, after six turbulent weeks, saying that the other officials elected alongside him on May 2 were guilty of &quot;incapacity and laxity&quot; in dealing with the city&#x27;s problems. This was due to the threat to the community from three half-brothers, early Old West gunman &quot;Big&quot; Steve Long, Con Moyer and Ace Moyer. Long was Laramie&#x27;s first marshal, and with his brothers owned the saloon Bucket of Blood. The three began harassing settlers, forcing them to sign over the deeds to their property to them. Any who refused were killed, usually goaded into a gunfight by Long. By October 1868, Long had killed 13 men.

The first Albany County sheriff, rancher N. K. Boswell, organized a &quot;Vigilance Committee&quot; in response. On October 28, 1868, Boswell led the committee into the Bucket of Blood, overwhelmed the three brothers, and lynched them at an unfinished cabin down the street. Through a series of other lynchings and other forms of intimidation, the vigilantes reduced the &quot;unruly element&quot; and established a semblance of law and order.

By the end of the decade, Laramie became the cultural and economic center of the newly organized Wyoming Territory. In 1869, Wyoming&#x27;s first legislature passed a bill granting equal political rights to women in the territory. In March 1870, five Laramie residents became the first women in the world to serve on a jury. As Laramie was the first town in Wyoming to hold a municipal election, on September 6, 1870, Laramie resident Louisa Swain was the first woman in the United States to cast a legal vote in a general election.

Early businesses included rolling mills, a railroad-tie treatment plant, a brick yard, a slaughterhouse, a brewery, a glass manufacturing plant, and a plaster mill, as well as the railroad yards. In 1886, a plant to produce electricity was built. Several regional railroads were based in Laramie, including the Laramie, North Park and Pacific Railroad and Telegraph Company founded in 1880 and the Laramie, North Park and Western Railroad established in 1901.

Governor Francis E. Warren signed a bill that established the University of Wyoming (UW) in 1886, the only public university in the state. Laramie was chosen as its site, and UW opened there in 1887. Under the terms of the Morrill Act, also known as the Land Grant College Act, in 1891 UW added an agricultural college and experiment station to gain benefits as a land grant college.

===Late 20th century to present===
The city was covered by international media in 1998 after the murder of Matthew Shepard, who was a gay student at the University of Wyoming. His murder generated an international outcry. It became the symbolic focus for a nationwide campaign against gay hate crimes. Federal hate crimes legislation was signed into law in 2009. As of May 2023, Wyoming does not have a hate crimes law, having failed to pass its most recent attempt at a hate crimes law in March 2021. Shepard&#x27;s murder was the subject of the award-winning play, later adapted as a movie, &quot;The Laramie Project&quot;.

In 2004, Laramie became the first city in Wyoming to pass a law to prohibit smoking in enclosed workplaces, including bars, restaurants and private clubs. Opponents of the clean indoor air ordinance, funded in part by the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, immediately petitioned to have the ordinance repealed. However, the voters upheld the ordinance in a citywide referendum which was conducted concurrently with the 2004 general election. The opponents challenged the validity of the election in court, claiming various irregularities. The judge ruled that the opponents had failed to meet their burden of showing significant problems with the election, and the ordinance, which had become effective in April 2005, remained in effect. In August 2005, Laramie&#x27;s City Council defeated an attempt to amend the ordinance to allow smoking in bars and private clubs.

<text>Wright is a town in Campbell County, Wyoming, United States. The population was 1,644 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

Ten thousand years ago, the first people came to the high plains to hunt buffalo and antelope. In more recent times, the Sioux and Crow claimed this area as their hunting grounds. In the 1880s, ranchers came to graze long horn cattle and sheep on the open range. They were followed by homesteaders lured by the promise of free land.

Official settlement began in the area in the early 1900s but boomed in the 1970s, with the creation of the Black Thunder Coal Mine, the largest mine in the Powder River Basin and most productive mine in the United States.

The Wright family homesteaded the area in 1911 creating the Wright Community. Shortly after moving to the area, R. A. Wright opened Wright&#x27;s first Post Office providing mail service to area ranchers. The community became known as Wright, Wyoming.

In 1976, during the economic boom led by Amax Coal, Black Thunder coal mine was developed near town. As with all energy towns, housing, schools, and essential services were needed. And like other coal mining regions, the Atlantic Richfield coal company stepped up and built the newly organized community, developing housing and a company store.

The Town of Wright was incorporated in 1985, making it one of Wyoming&#x27;s newest municipalities with a rich history. By 1990, Wright was a well-established community with a population of 1,236 people.

On August 12, 2005, an F2 rated tornado struck a mobile home park at Wright, destroying 91 homes, damaging others, and killing two people. Around that time, the residents there proposed a split from Campbell County.

==Economy==
Having been established as a mining town, the majority of people living in Wright are employed by the various mines surrounding it. The site for the proposed, but stalled, Two Elk Energy Park is several miles from town. The Two Elk power plant is a planned 300 megawatt power plant which would burn &quot;waste coal&quot; from mines in the area. Waste coal is low-grade coal unsuitable for shipping and sale which would otherwise be reburied. Recent iterations of the plan include using beetle-killed pine as fuel. Only a shed and a partial foundation are at the site. Over 16 years, a series of permit extensions have been issued by Wyoming. Nearly half a billion dollars are available from tax-exempt bonds, but additional investment is required in order to fund the plant.

<text>Encampment (also known as Grand Encampment) is a town in southern Carbon County, Wyoming, United States. The population was 450 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Known also as &quot;Grand Encampment&quot;, this town along the Colorado-Wyoming border was, at the turn of the twentieth century, a booming center of copper mining and smelting. At one point a sixteen-mile tramway was built to carry copper ore from the mountains into the town for smelting. This steam powered tramway was, at the time, the longest in the world. A sharp drop in copper prices and disastrous fires drove the mining company into bankruptcy. Mining operations ceased in the early twentieth century. A large sawmill operated in the town between 1950 and 1998.

The Grand Encampment Museum is located in Encampment. It highlights the copper mining, ranching, logging history in the area. It includes over 15 historic buildings and thousands of interesting objects. A research library is located in the main gallery, the Doc Culleton Interpretive Center.

==Mine accidents==
In June 1903, at 10:30 a.m., an underground explosion occurred in the Hanna No.1 Colliery. The explosion was thought to have originated at the end of the , one and a half miles underground, blocking escape for the majority of workers. Of the 215 men on site, only 46 survived — the majority of victims being Finnish immigrants and black workers. The town&#x27;s original grave site was far too small to handle such a large body count, and the town was forced to establish the Hanna Cemetery to bury the bodies, three miles (5 km) outside of the town. A later disaster at Mine No. 1 occurred on March 28, 1908.

<text>Medicine Bow is a town in Carbon County, Wyoming, United States. Its population was 284 at the 2010 census.

==History==

The community largely owes its existence to the first transcontinental railroad, built through the area in 1868. A post office called Medicine Bow has been in operation since 1869. The community was named after the Medicine Bow River.

Dippy, a well-known dinosaur skeleton, was found in a quarry nearby around 1898. In 1899, fossil hunters for the American Museum of Natural History and the Field Museum stayed in or near the town during their search for large dinosaur skeletons. The town had a railroad and was near the fossilferous sedimentary hills from the Jurassic Morrison Formation, making it an important stopping location for paleontologists, with fossils of &quot;Diplodocus&quot; and &quot;Brontosaurus&quot; found nearby at Como Bluff by the two institutions during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The town was noted to be plagued by crime, with famous bandits such as Butch Cassidy and his Wild Bunch committing the Wilcox Train Robbery only a few miles away from the AMNH&#x27;s fossil localities and Medicine Bow itself.

The Virginian Hotel is a historic hotel located in Medicine Bow. It was built in 1911 by August Grimm, and is believed to be named for the Owen Wister novel, which is set in and around Medicine Bow. The hotel was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

In the 1910s, part of the Lincoln Highway was routed through Medicine Bow until Interstate 80 replaced it in 1970.

<text>Sinclair is a town in Carbon County, Wyoming, United States.

==History==
The town was originally called Parco, after the Producers &amp; Refiners Corporation (or PARCO) which founded the refinery and the company town. It was renamed Sinclair after PARCO was acquired during the Great Depression by Sinclair Consolidated Oil Corporation. The original refinery, located just east of town, remains in use to this day. Sinclair&#x27;s population was 433 at the 2010 census.

The town was built as a planned community in 1924–1925, designed by Denver architects Fisher &amp; Fisher in a Spanish Colonial Revival style. The historic center of town was designated the Parco Historic District in 1987.

Just six miles east of Sinclair is the ghost town site of Benton, Wyoming at milepost 672.1 of the Union Pacific Railroad. As the terminal of the railroad at the time, Benton had a colorful three-month history which ended in September 1868 with a visit from Republican presidential candidate Ulysses S. Grant and the departure of the final overland wagon trains on the Mormon Trail headed for the Salt Lake Valley before completion of the railroad the following year.

Three miles east of the Benton site is Fort Fred Steele State Historic Site. The original Ft. Steele was named for American Civil War Union General Frederick Steele and established June 20, 1868, to protect the Union Pacific Railway as it rapidly expanded west. The fort was deactivated August 7, 1886, and most of the buildings at the fort were sold and moved to the settlement which had grown up around the fort and other locations. The small community continued until 1939 when the Lincoln Highway was paved and rerouted to coincide with what later became Interstate 80. In 1940, following the short-lived Supreme Court decision &quot;Minersville School District v. Gobitis&quot;, residents tarred and feathered the town&#x27;s Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. The Wyoming State Legislature preserved what remained in 1973 with creation of the state historical site.

===Jackalopes===

In 1932, the jackalope legend in the United States was attributed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; to Douglas Herrick (1920−2003) of Douglas, and thus the city was named the &quot;Home of the Jackalope&quot; by the state of Wyoming in 1985. Douglas has issued Jackalope Hunting licenses to tourists. The tags are good for hunting during official Jackalope season, which occurs for only one day, June 31.

According to the Douglas Chamber of Commerce, a 1930s hunting trip for jackrabbits led to the idea of a Jackalope. Herrick and his brother had studied taxidermy by mail order as teenagers. When the brothers returned from a hunting trip, Herrick tossed a jackrabbit carcass into the taxidermy shop, which rested beside a pair of deer antlers. The accidental combination of animal forms sparked Douglas Herrick&#x27;s idea for a jackalope.

<text>Glenrock is a town in Converse County, Wyoming, United States. The population was 2,420 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Glenrock, known as Deer Creek Station, had its beginning as a mail and stage station along the Oregon Trail. The station served as a stopping point along the trail and was a vital supply point for thousands of emigrants as they traveled westward. A significant number of industries were established after 1889 and expanded the growth and economy of many communities like Glenrock in central Wyoming.

===Historical Sites===
Rock in the Glen
* This landmark has been viewed by an estimated 350,000 immigrants that have migrated westward since the mid-1800s. In 1812, it was first discovered by American fur trappers during a creation of a fur trapping route. This trappers trail has known many names depending upon the group traveling upon it. These names include the Oregon, California, and Mormon trails.

Mormon Mines
* On June 10, 1847, the first group of Mormons reached Deer Creek in the Glenrock region. A mere ten days later, a coal mine produced the first recorded coal mined in the Wyoming territory.

Deer Creek Station
* Originally, Deer Creek Station stood as a pioneer and Indian trading post in the 1850s and as a relay terminal for the overland stage line. Ten years later in 1860, it would become a &quot;home station for the pony express.&quot; In 1861, the station became incorporated into the telegraph system. On October 18, 1861, the telegrapher at Deer Creek Station helped to send along the first relayed message to Cleveland, Ohio from the West. As the telegraphy began to replace the pony express, the relationship between Indians and the U.S. Government worsened in the Glenrock region. Over the course of three years, from 1862–1866, Deer Creek Station stood as a military outpost. With few troops stationed in the fort, in 1866, Indians burned it down, this includes the telegraph station located in Deer Creek Station. It was never rebuilt as traffic on the old trails dwindled and it became part of the past.

===Glenrock train wreck===
September 27, 1923 – near Glenrock, Wyoming, soon after the washout of Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad&#x27;s bridge over Cole Creek, a passenger train fell through the washout, killing 30 of the train&#x27;s 66 passengers.

<text>Lost Springs is a town in Converse County, Wyoming, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 6, making it the least populated municipality in Wyoming.

==History==
Lost Springs was first inhabited in the 1880s, when it received its name from railroad workers who could not find the springs shown on survey maps of the area. The town was incorporated in 1911, and it originally had 200 residents, most of whom worked at the nearby Rosin coal mine. After the coal mine closed around 1930, the population of Lost Springs steadily declined.

Edward John Sanmann of York, Nebraska, and his wife, Lauretta Mae (Rogers) of Bloomington, Nebraska, moved to Lost Springs in 1948 where they lived and worked in the general store and assisted with running the town&#x27;s post office. Sanmann was a member of the American Sunday School Union and Bible Class at Shawnee. The couple had a daughter who died in infancy, Virginia Arlene, and an adopted daughter, Louise Marie. Sanmann and his wife died 17 days apart in September 1967.

By 1960, the population of the town had dropped to five. In 1976, both the state of Wyoming and the U.S. Bicentennial Commission designated Lost Springs as the smallest incorporated town in America; its population was then eleven.

In 1983, Lost Springs became involved in a court battle with the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company. The railroad, which ran adjacent to the town, attempted to seize of land to build a railway embankment. Lost Springs Mayor Leda Price alleged that the embankment, which would lie between the town and U.S. Highways 18 and 20, would separate the town from traffic on the highway. A Wyoming district judge ruled in the town&#x27;s favor, and the railroad ultimately agreed to build an unobstructing track bed and use its own land for track.

<doc id="140095" wikidata="Q1003748" url="?curid=140095" title="Dubois, Wyoming">
<text>Dubois is a town in Fremont County, Wyoming, United States. The population was 971 at the 2010 census, but dropped to 911 in the 2020 census. The population nearly doubles in the summer with part-time residents.

While the Town of Dubois includes within the Town Limits which constitutes a population density of 261 people per square mile, the 82513 ZIP Code (&quot;Dubois, Wyoming&quot;) includes and has a total population of 1,549 which is a population density of about 1 person per square mile. For comparison, the Dubois ZIP Code is larger than the entire state of Rhode Island.

==History==
The original residents of Dubois wanted to name the town &quot;Tibo&quot;, after the Shoshone language word for &quot;stranger&quot; or &quot;white man,&quot; which was the Natives&#x27; affectionate name for their Episcopal priest, Father John Roberts. However, the postal service found this name unacceptable, so Governor Joseph M. Carey named the town with the name Dubois after his friend Fred Dubois, an Idaho senator at the time. In protest, the citizens of Dubois rejected the French pronunciation of &quot;deh-bwah&quot;, instead opting for &quot;Du&quot;, with &quot;u&quot; as in &quot;Sue&quot;; &quot;bois&quot;, with &quot;oi&quot; as in &quot;voice&quot;. This local legend is most likely not true as the town in Idaho, named after the same Idaho Senator, is pronounced the same way as the town in Wyoming. The accent is on the first syllable.
The first occupants of the mountains and valleys surrounding what is now Dubois were members of the Sheepeaters, a group of Mountain Shoshone, who included the Wind River area in their regular annual migrations from the Great Plains through the mountains of Yellowstone and beyond. The Wind River Valley surrounding Dubois contains numerous remnants of these people who lived in the area for many hundreds of years before they were relocated into a nearby reservation. Relics of their existence in the mountains and valleys around Dubois include numerous prehistoric petroglyphs, hunting traps and blinds, and stone tepee circles.

The first Europeans to enter the area were trappers Francois and Louis Verendrye in 1742–43. In the years to follow, the Wind River valley was visited regularly by the Astorians and other fur trappers and hunters through the early 19th century. The first homesteaders arrived in the late 1870s.

Butch Cassidy (Robert LeRoy Parker) owned and managed a ranch on the outskirts of Dubois, beginning in 1890. It is said that he was a frequent customer at Welty&#x27;s General Store in Dubois, which is still in operation. A statue erected in the center of Dubois is modeled after Butch Cassidy.
In 1913, the town expanded with the addition of a hotel, a bar, and a general store, anticipating the arrival of Scandinavian lumber workers brought there by the Wyoming Tie and Timber Company the following year. (All of these structures are still standing.)

St. Thomas Episcopal Church was founded in 1910 by Reverend John Roberts, an Episcopal missionary who served the Native American tribes on the Wind River.

Charles Moore built the first of many dude ranches in the area, Ramshorn Ranch and Camp Yellowstone, at the mouth of the DuNoir Creek west of Dubois in 1907.

In the landscape surrounding Dubois are visible the remains of wood flumes constructed by the tie hacks who provided the railroad ties that helped to develop the American West. These Scandinavian immigrants cut logs into ties and sent these via the flumes to the Wind River where they floated to Riverton, about 70 miles east, for processing.

The Dubois Museum preserves and interprets the natural and social history of the Upper Wind River Valley as the National Bighorn Sheep Interpretive Center focuses on public education about the biology and habitat of the Rocky Mountain Bighorn Sheep with focus on the largest herd of Rocky Mountain Bighorn sheep in the coterminous United States that winter in the Whiskey Basin of Whiskey Mountain adjacent to the Fitzpatrick Wilderness in the Shoshone National Forest. The Center preserves and interprets the relationships of the Bighorn sheep.

The town is on U.S. Route 26 and is the beginning of the Wyoming Centennial Scenic Byway, U.S. Route 26 crossing the Continental Divide at Togwotee Pass.

A significant proportion of Dubois residents are writers, artists, photographers, musicians and songwriters, drawn to the remote town in part by its relatively moderate climate and remarkable scenery. Annual cultural events include a national art show and a quilt show, a horseback chariot race, and celebrations during July 4 weekend. During summer months, a square dance and a rodeo including local and regional competitors take place every week.

On December 30, 2014, several businesses burned to the ground in the downtown area. The air temperatures at the time of the blaze were hovering near -35 °F with wind chills in the range of 50 below zero (-50 °F). Firefighters battled freezing equipment and gear throughout the night to get the fire under control. The blaze was ruled accidental. The origin of the fire appeared to be inside the rear of the &quot;Main Street Mart&quot; building in the attic above a wood stove. The fire was most likely caused by charring (pyrolysis) that resulted from the chimney coming into contact with building materials. Approximately half a block of Downtown Dubois was destroyed by the fire. In July 2016, a wildfire on the outskirts of Dubois again prompted evacuations.

In August 2020, the National Museum of Military Vehicles opened southeast of Dubois. The privately funded $100M museum was founded by Dan Starks, a former lawyer and CEO of St. Jude Medical.

<text>Jeffrey City is a former uranium mining boomtown located in Fremont County, in the central part of the U.S. state of Wyoming. The town is known in Wyoming and the American West as symbol of a boomtown that went &quot;bust&quot; very quickly, as the mine was shut down in 1982 and over 95% of the inhabitants left the town within three years. The population was 58 at the 2010 census, far lower than its onetime population of several thousand people. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Jeffrey City as a census-designated place (CDP).

== History ==
Jeffrey City began in 1931 as &quot;Home on the Range&quot;, the homestead of a Nebraska couple named the Petersons, who relocated because Mr. Peterson was sick after having been gassed in World War I. Mrs. Beulah Peterson (later Walker) opened two gasoline pumps when the highway came through, and began cooking for those who stopped. The post office at Split Rock, away, closed in 1943, and Mrs. Peterson took up the task of handling the ranchers&#x27; mail. She canceled the letters with &quot;Home on the Range&quot;. She retired her post office cancellation stamp in 1957 when Home on the Range became Jeffrey City. Her family members are currently restoring the old Home on the Range post office site.

Home on the Range became Jeffrey City when those who came to mine uranium sought to honor Dr. C. W. Jeffrey, a wealthy doctor from Rawlins, Wyoming, who initially financed the costs for prospector and businessman Bob Adams to start the Western Nuclear Corporation mining firm and open a uranium mine near the area in 1957, during the Cold War and the height of uranium demand.

Thousands of people looking for high-paying mining jobs streamed into Jeffrey City, and Western Nuclear designed and financed a company town for the workers and their families. At the height of the boom town optimism, a separate high school building was added and an Olympic-sized swimming pool and third gymnasium was built. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the uranium market collapsed and the mine was forced to close. As was typical of many boom towns, Jeffrey City was singularly dependent on the local mine, and after it closed there was no reason for residents to remain. What was once a thriving local community with shops, schools, library, sheriff, youth hostel, churches, medical clinics and more, became a ghost town as 95% of the residents left the town by 1986. Today, few institutions remain: the First (Southern) Baptist Church (which is still doing well thanks to the area ranchers who attend), a restaurant and bar called the Split Rock Café that caters to the few local residents and those passing through on the highway, and Monk King Bird Pottery, a pottery studio. The Green Mountain Motel provides perhaps the only lodging along the route between Rawlins and Riverton.

==Geography and climate==
Jeffrey City is located in southeastern Fremont County along U.S. Route 287, northwest of Rawlins and Interstate 80, and southeast of Lander, the Fremont County seat. According to the United States Census Bureau, the Jeffrey City CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.56%, is water.

The racial makeup of the CDP was 98.11% White or 104 people, 0.94% or one Indigenous American, and 0.94% or one person from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.89% of the population, or two people.

There were 45 households, out of which 15.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66.7% were married couples living together, 2.2% or one household had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.7% were non-families. 17.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 4.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.36 and the average family size was 2.61.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 14.2% under the age of 18, 8.5% from 18 to 24, 26.4% from 25 to 44, 41.5% from 45 to 64, and 9.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 46 years. For every 100 females, there were 152.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 127.5 males.

<text>Lander is a city and the county seat of Fremont County, Wyoming. It is located in central Wyoming, along the Middle Fork of the Popo Agie River, just south of the Wind River Indian Reservation. It is a tourism center with several nearby guest ranches. Its population was 7,546 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Lander was previously known as Pushroot, Old Camp Brown and Fort Augur. Its present name was chosen in 1875 in reference to General Frederick W. Lander, a transcontinental explorer who surveyed the Oregon Trail&#x27;s Lander Cutoff.

===19th century===
In 1868, the boundaries of the Wind River Indian Reservation were officially established by the Fort Bridger Treaty, setting its southern border along the Sweetwater River. This marked the beginning of increased conflicts between the Shoshone tribe and white settlers, who were illegally encroaching on reservation lands. Additionally, it became evident to the U.S. Government that much of the land east of the Wind River Mountains, considered desirable, was located within the reservation.

In response in 1872 Congress approved negotiations with Shoshone leaders, including Chief Washakie. These negotiations took place at Camp Stambaugh during the summer of 1872 and culminated in the Shoshone&#x27;s agreement to cede the southern part of their reservation. The agreement provided the tribe with $25,000, $5,000 in stock cattle, and an annual salary of $500 for Chief Washakie over five years.

The year 1873 saw The Jones Expedition explore the area around what would become the town of Lander, establishing a route to Yellowstone National Park. This exploration resulted in extensive documentation of natural features, including hot springs, oil reserves, and hieroglyphs. Notably, the Dallas Dome area, situated several miles southeast of the future town-site near today&#x27;s U.S. Route 287, was identified as the site of Wyoming&#x27;s first oil well, completed in 1883. The town of Lander was officially incorporated on July 17, 1890.

===20th century===
On October 1, 1906, Lander became the westward terminus of the &quot;Cowboy Line&quot; of the Chicago and North Western Railway, thus originating the slogan &quot;where rails end and trails begin.&quot; Originally intended to be a transcontinental mainline to Coos Bay, Oregon, or Eureka, California, the line never went further west, and service to Lander was abandoned in 1972. With the arrival of the railroad, Lander&#x27;s population more than doubled between 1900 and 1910. At the turn of the century the town and surrounding valley were promising places for agricultural development due to the area&#x27;s climate and potential for irrigation. At the time there were several new ventures around the town producing wool, wheat, oats, alfalfa, hay, vegetables, small fruit and in some cases orchards. However, a report from the State of Wyoming published in 1907 says agriculture around Lander only supplies local demand.
In 1962 U.S. Steel opened the Atlantic City iron ore and mill, south of Lander near Atlantic City The mine was a significant employer in Lander, but by 1983 it ceased operations.

===21st century===
Lander continues to evolve and faces similar issues as many small towns in the Western U.S. Education and outdoor recreation play a large role in the town&#x27;s economy with the Wyoming Catholic College and National Outdoor Leadership School both based in Lander. Though agriculture and resource extraction no longer play a large role in the town&#x27;s economy, its population has continued to grow since the year 2000.

<text>Riverton is a city in Fremont County, Wyoming, United States. The city&#x27;s population was 10,682 at the 2020 census, making it the most populous city in the county.

==History==
The city, founded in 1906, is an incorporated entity of the state of Wyoming. The community was named Riverton because of the four rivers that meet there. The town was built on land ceded from the Wind River Indian Reservation, a situation that often makes it subject to jurisdictional claims by the nearby Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes.

A legal ruling on November 7, 2017, by the 10th Circuit Court, ruled again in the EPA reservation boundary dispute. Though the decision was complex, the 10th Circuit Court answered plainly. Riverton is not on the reservation. The 10th Circuit&#x27;s decision is now official and final after the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals 2017 ruling. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the EPA, and held that the land had been ceded in 1905 by an Act of Congress. This ruling ends the dispute, bringing the debate and controversy to an end.
Riverton Regional Airport (now Central Wyoming Regional Airport) is home to a National Weather Service Forecast Office and NEXRAD radar site which is responsible to cover all of western and central Wyoming.

The Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway completed an extension of the &quot;Cowboy Line&quot; through to Lander which is roughly 22 miles west of Riverton. Plans were to continue the line west from Lander. In 1972, the end of the line was moved from Lander and the new terminus of the line was in Riverton. Services were then discontinued in Riverton in the mid-1970&#x27;s as the line was slowly dismantled west of Casper.

<doc id="140104" wikidata="Q1029795" url="?curid=140104" title="Shoshoni, Wyoming">
<text>Shoshoni is a town in Fremont County, Wyoming, United States. The population was 471 at the 2020 census, a 27.4% decline from 649 at the 2010 census. The town has gained notoriety as a speed trap due to numerous references citing its aggressive enforcement of traffic laws. According to available data, the town has a 32% ticket to resident rate, suggesting a disproportionate number of traffic tickets issued to drivers passing through the area. This has led to criticism and controversy surrounding the town&#x27;s policing practices.

==History==
The town is named for the Shoshone Indian tribe, most of whom live on the nearby Wind River Indian Reservation. Established as a railroad and mining town, Shoshoni lies at the intersection of U.S. Routes 20 and 26, which together were formerly known as the &quot;Yellowstone Highway&quot;. Shoshoni has a dramatic increase in visitors in the summer, when roads to Yellowstone National Park are open. Visitors also stop to camp and fish at nearby Boysen Reservoir and the surrounding Boysen State Park. Anglers participate in fishing derbies at the reservoir, including an ice fishing derby in the winter.

Ranching is, and has been for decades, the major agricultural endeavor in the nearby area.

Charles Henry King, a prominent millionaire businessman and banker later based in Omaha, Nebraska, built the C.H. King Company and First Union Bank Building, formerly occupied by Yellowstone Drug Store. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. King and his wife Martha were the paternal grandparents of President Gerald Ford, who was born in their Omaha house in July 1913.

In 2004 a water-intensive mushroom processing plant began operation on land that was annexed by the town and put within its limits. At first it was staffed by prison labor, who were paid minimum wage, in a prison industries program. When they had trouble with production, the plant hired skilled labor from Guatemala. This labor practice stopped when a Department of Homeland Security investigation revealed that some of the workers had problems with their immigration histories. More recently, the plant has ensured all migrant workers are legal. During operations, the plant&#x27;s composting bunkers emitted unpleasant odors, resulting in numerous complaints from residents during 2005. The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality investigated the situation and air quality issues. The plant installed a stack and ventilating system in early 2006 to control and disperse odor from the composting bunkers. In 2009, the facility was up put up for sale and purchased in January 2020 by Iglesia Ni Cristo, a Philippines-based religious sect with the intent of using local &quot;honor based&quot; labor to work in the facility. 

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

Shoshoni&#x27;s closest body of water is Boysen Reservoir, which is also the confluence of the Wind River, Badwater Creek and Poison Creek. As the water exits the dam it flows into the Wind River Canyon and joins the Big Horn River at the Wedding of the Waters at the canyon egress.

<doc id="140107" wikidata="Q1942423" url="?curid=140107" title="Huntley, Wyoming">
<text>Huntley is a census-designated place (CDP) in Goshen County, Wyoming, United States. The population was 30 according to the 2010 census.

Former Wyoming Governor Stanley K. Hathaway grew up on a farm here, and graduated from Huntley High School as class valedictorian in 1941. He was the only one in his senior class.

==History==
Around 1900, a fund established by the wealthy European philanthropist Baron Maurice de Hirsch to promote farming in the United States, sponsored about 50 families by supporting them in establishing a new community around what is now Huntley, south of the North Platte River, and west of the Nebraska border.

The new residents came mostly from New York and Pennsylvania, as well as some from Europe. On July 6, 1906, six men from the community first filed claims for homesteads located in and around present-day Huntley. Most of the homesteaders and their families started out there living in sod dugouts that they built for use as dwellings.

Among the challenges for the new residents was that the nearest water was about half a mile away in the Katzer Canal, and obtaining needed supplies was difficult, as the closest general store was in Mitchell, Nebraska, about to the east. Most of the settlers did not originally own horses, and walked to Mitchell to purchase supplies—carrying flour, sugar, beans, rice and salt back to their homesteads in knapsacks. About a year later, however, Baron de Hirsch&#x27;s fund sent $500, a huge sum in those days, to each family. With this financial support from de Hersch, the settlers were then able to purchase horses, wagons, machinery, a milk cow, and tools. Before long, Huntley had a post office, a church, a grocery store, and a lumber yard.

In 1908, de Hirsch sponsored another 40 or 45 more families coming to Wyoming, who settled in an area a few miles northeast of present-day the Huntley, known as the community of Allen, and a school and a synagogue were established.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 0.3 square mile (0.7 km), all land.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 21 people, 9 households, and 6 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 77.3 people per square mile (30.0/km). There were 9 housing units at an average density of 33.1/sq mi (12.9/km). The racial makeup of the CDP was 100.00% White.

Of the 9 households, 33.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66.7% were married couples living together, and 33.3% were non-families. Another 33.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.33 persons, and the average family size was 3.00.

In the CDP, the population consisted of 28.6% under the age of 18, 28.6% from age 25 to 44, 28.6% from age 45 to 64, and 14.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 61.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.5 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $30,625, and the median income for a family was $30,625. Males had a median income of $13,750 versus $0 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $9,688. None of the population or families were below the poverty line.

<doc id="140110" wikidata="Q988195" url="?curid=140110" title="Torrington, Wyoming">
<text>Torrington is a city in and the county seat of Goshen County, Wyoming, United States. The population was 6,119 at the 2020 census, down from 6,501 at the 2010 census.

It is the home of Eastern Wyoming College, and is the surrounding region&#x27;s center of commercial activity. Within this primarily agricultural community, there are several fertilizer plants, a sugar beet factory, and numerous tourist facilities and retail businesses that serve the local and nearby rural populations.

==History==

Situated on the historic Mormon Trail and near the Oregon and California trails along the banks of the North Platte River, Torrington was founded in 1900 by W. G. Curtis (1857–1913), and named by him for his home town of Torrington, Connecticut. Originally a watering and coaling station for the CB&amp;Q Railroad, which began passenger service in 1900, the town was a gathering place for nearby farmers and ranchers. In 1905, the first bridge was constructed over the North Platte River.

A post office called Torrington was established in 1889 on Curtis&#x27; farm three miles west of the future town, with Curtis serving as postmaster and later as mayor. In 1908, the town incorporated in Laramie County. It had a bank, three general stores, a pharmacy with a soda fountain, a land office, and two hotels (for one of which the building, although modified, still exists at 1841 Main Street.) It soon became a central place of trade for Goshen County, and for surrounding areas in eastern Wyoming and western Nebraska.

The town&#x27;s site survey began in April 1900, by Ashland B. Smith of the Lincoln Land Company of Nebraska. The survey and plating was recorded in Cheyenne on June 22, 1900, and individual plots of the land sold to residents for one dollar each by Charles Henry Morrill, President of the Lincoln Land Company. &quot;The Torrington Telegram&quot; (which was still published in 2015) was established in 1911. The 1900 United States Census lists only 71 inhabitants in the Torrington Precinct and does not list it as a town. All residents were stock growers, ranch laborers, cowboys or at school, except for one listed as a hardware clerk.

Also in 1911, Goshen County was organized. The County was created from a portion of the northern end of Laramie County. The towns of Torrington and nearby Lingle—some away—competed for designation as the county seat. Torrington prevailed after Torrington residents raised sufficient funds for a courthouse. The cornerstone for the courthouse was set in 1913, in a ceremony where a band was conducted by Hi Yoder, from whose family the nearby town of Yoder, Wyoming, takes its name.

Around that time, early motor cars started showing up in town, the Goshen County Fair Association was established, and in 1915 Torrington had a population of 443. In 1919, the Trail Hotel building, which still exists at 2001 Main Street, was constructed. In 1925, the Union Pacific Railroad based in Omaha constructed a spur line from Cheyenne to South Torrington, to serve the proposed Holly Sugar Corporation plant, which began operations in 1926.

The Holly Sugar factory, later Western Sugar Cooperative, processed sugar beets since 1923 and closed in early 2019. It was once a major employer for the Torrington area. The preserved historic Union Pacific Depot building now houses the Goshen County Homesteaders Museum.

The Torrington Livestock Commission, established in 1934, still held twice-weekly livestock auctions in 2015.

<text>Thermopolis is the county seat and most populous town in Hot Springs County, Wyoming, United States. As of the 2020 U.S. Census, the town population was 2,725.

Thermopolis, Greek for &quot;hot city&quot;, is home to numerous natural hot springs, in which mineral-laden waters are heated by geothermal processes. The town is named for the hot springs located there.

The town claims the world&#x27;s largest mineral hot spring, appropriately named &quot;The Big Spring&quot;, as part of Hot Springs State Park. The springs are open to the public for free as part of an 1896 treaty signed with the Shoshone and Arapaho Indian tribes.

Dinosaur fossils were found on the Warm Springs Ranch in 1993, and the Wyoming Dinosaur Center was founded soon after.

==Geography==
Thermopolis is located near the northern end of the Wind River Canyon and Wedding of the Waters, where the north-flowing Wind River becomes the Bighorn River. It is an unusual instance of a river changing names at a point other than a confluence of two streams. The dual name is ascribed to the mountain barrier between the Wind River and Bighorn basins, obscuring the fact that the river that drains the two is the same. The term &quot;Wedding of the Waters&quot; dates to at least 1934, when a marker was placed at the location.

Thermopolis is ringed by mountains, with the Big Horn Mountains to the northeast, the Bridger Mountains to the southeast, the Owl Creek Mountains to the southwest and the Absaroka Range to the northwest. Thermopolis is the southernmost municipality in the Big Horn Basin.

<doc id="140119" wikidata="Q1028510" url="?curid=140119" title="Kaycee, Wyoming">
<text>Kaycee is a town in Johnson County, Wyoming, United States. The population was 247 at the 2020 census. It is home to a museum that preserves the cattle ranching heritage of the area, especially the history of the Johnson County War.

Kaycee was incorporated in 1906 after the establishment of a small post office and general store. The town was named after the brand &quot;KC&quot; used by its earliest homesteader, John Nolan. The government required the name to be spelled out resulting in &quot;Kaycee&quot;. The town is now home to three churches, two bars, two restaurants, one store, one museum, one K-12 school, and zero stoplights.

Western music star and rodeo champion Chris LeDoux resided on a ranch near Kaycee, although he was born in Biloxi, Mississippi.

Kaycee is home to former NCAA Division II track and field athlete Dakotah Winsor.

Former NCAA Division III track and field athlete Noah Elm was born and raised in Kaycee.

Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon grew up on the Gordon Ranch near Kaycee. Gordon is owner of the Merlin Ranch east of Buffalo and is affiliated with the 48 Ranch Partnership in Kaycee.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

== History ==
=== The Portuguese Fort ===
In 1834 a band of trappers and traders led by Antonio Montero from Portugal built a trading post east of Kaycee WY.It became known as the “Portuguese Fort.” A unique site, what little remains from the area have been donated to the &quot;Hoofprints of the Past Museum&quot; and includes artefacts including a sword, beads, and clay pipes.

=== The Bozeman Trail ===
The 1860s brought new attention from both whites and Native Americans to the northeast corner of what soon would become Wyoming Territory. First, a gold frenzy in Montana Territory drew miners north from the emigrant road that followed the North Platte River. Mountain man Jim Bridger warned against establishing a trail through the Arapaho and Lakota hunting grounds, urging that another path west of the Bighorns be used instead. But the Powder River Basin route was the most direct and, in 1863, John Bozeman following ancient routes long used by Indians, blazed the Bozeman Trail through the middle of the basin.

The Bozeman Trail ran within four miles of Kaycee, overlaying previous Indian, trader and exploration routes and connecting the Oregon Trail to the gold rush territory in Montana. Its most important period was 1863–1868, and its most significant consequence was the Indian Wars of the Northern Plains. The Hoofprints of the Past Museum displays items relating to this period.

=== Fort Reno and Cantonment Reno ===
During the Indian Wars of the late 1800s, two military posts were built miles apart near the Bozeman Trail crossing of the Powder River: Fort Reno in the 1860s and Cantonment Reno in the 1870s. Historical markers presently mark the spots.

Items donated from the Fort Reno site are on display at the Hoofprints of the Past Museum, as well as a diorama of the fort created by Robert Wilson, an expert in local military forts.

=== Moreton Frewen ===

The Frewen Ranch was located east of present-day Kaycee at the confluence of the North Fork and the Middle Fork of the Powder River. Moreton Frewen was the fifth son of Thomas Frewen, MP for South Leicestershire, and was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he gained his BA in 1877. He emigrated to Wyoming during the cattle boom in the 1870s and 1880s. A charming if financially incompetent adventurer from an English landed gentry family known for reckless financial and political schemes, he managed to marry Clarita &quot;Clara&quot; Jerome (1851–1935) in 1881, daughter of the New York City financier Leonard Jerome, and sister to Lord Randolph Churchill&#x27;s wife Jennie. They settled together on a huge Wyoming ranch, The &quot;Prince of Wales Ranch&quot;, where Frewen built an enormous log lodge/castle later destroyed by fire and ran up ever increasing debt, earning the sobriquets &quot;Mortal Ruin&quot; and &quot;the splendid pauper&quot;. His laterally descended family, the Martins formerly of Charley Hall, Leicestershire, refer to him to this day however not as &quot;Mortal Ruin&quot; but as &quot;Immortal Ruin&quot;, as he ran through two family fortunes before being granted a remittance and &quot;encouraged&quot; by family to emigrate to America.

=== Hole In the Wall ===

Hole-in-the-Wall is located in the foothills of the Big Horn Mountains of Johnson County, Wyoming. The site was used in the late 19th century by the Hole in the Wall Gang, a group of cattle rustlers and other outlaws which included Kid Curry, Black Jack Ketchum, and Butch Cassidy&#x27;s Wild Bunch gang. Cassidy, the Sundance Kid, and other desperados met at a log cabin in the Hole-in-the-Wall country which has been preserved at the Old Trail Town museum in Cody, Wyoming. The cabin was built in 1883 by Alexander Ghent.

=== The Johnson County Cattle War ===
Source:

(see also Johnson County War)

In the early days in Wyoming, most of the land was in the public domain, open both to stockraising as open range and to homesteading. Large numbers of cattle were turned loose on the open range by large ranches, sometimes financed by other investors. In the spring a roundup was held and the cows and the calves belonging to each ranch were separated and the calves branded. Before the roundup, sometimes calves, especially orphan or stray calves, were surreptitiously branded, and thus taken. The large ranches, concerned about this practice, forbade their employees from owning cattle and aggressively defended against rustling.

The situation became steadily worse after the poor winter of 1886. The large companies began to aggressively appropriate land and control the flow and supply of water in this area; they justified these excesses on what was public land by using the catch-all allegation of rustling, and vigorously sought to exclude the smaller ranchers from participation in the annual roundup; apparently agents of the larger ranches killed several alleged rustlers. A number of lynchings of alleged rustlers took place in 1889, including the double lynching of innocent homesteaders and ranchers Ella Watson and Jim Averell.

The large ranches were organized as the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (the WSGA) and gathered socially as the Cheyenne Club in Cheyenne, Wyoming. In April 1892 the WSGA hired killers from Texas; an expedition of 50 men was organized, which proceeded by train from Cheyenne to Casper, Wyoming, then toward Johnson County, intending to eliminate alleged rustlers and also, apparently, to replace the government in Johnson County. Major Frank Wolcott led the Regulators into Johnson County. To prevent an alarm, the telegraph lines out of Buffalo were cut. The expedition was accompanied by two newspaper reporters whose lurid accounts later appeared in the eastern newspapers.

==== Nathan D. Champion ====
The first target of the WSGA was Nate Champion at the &quot;KC Ranch&quot;. Champion was a small rancher who was active in the efforts of small ranchers to organize a competing roundup. Three men besides Champion were at the KC. Two men, evidently trappers, who had taken shelter for the night, were captured as they emerged from the cabin early that morning to collect water at the nearby Powder River, while the third, Nick Ray, was shot while standing inside the doorway of the cabin and died a few hours later. The fourth, Nate Champion, was besieged. Two passers-by noticed the ruckus and rode to Buffalo, where Johnson County Sheriff William &quot;Red&quot; Angus raised a posse of 200 men and set out for the &quot;KC Ranch&quot;.

Champion held out for several hours, killing at least four of the vigilantes, and wounding several others. During the siege, Champion kept a poignant journal which contained a number of notes he wrote to friends while taking cover inside the cabin. &quot;Boys, I feel pretty lonesome just now. I wish there was someone here with me so we could watch all sides at once.&quot; he wrote. The last journal entry read: &quot;Well, they have just got through shelling the house like hail. I heard them splitting wood. I guess they are going to fire the house tonight. I think I will make a break when night comes, if alive. Shooting again. It&#x27;s not night yet. The house is all fired. Goodbye, boys, if I never see you again&quot;.

With the house on fire, Nate Champion signed his journal entry and put the journal in his pocket before he emerged, running from the back door with a Colt Revolver in the left hand and a Winchester rifle in the right. He was gunned down by four men firing simultaneously, hit by 28 bullets. The invaders later pinned a note on Champion&#x27;s bullet-riddled chest that read &quot;Cattle Thieves Beware&quot;. They also carefully removed entries from the diary which named some of the attackers.

==== Jack Flagg ====
&#x27;The Invaders then loaded up the wood on a wagon that was left by Jack Flagg and pushed it towards the cabin. With the house on fire, Nate Champion signed his journal entry and put it in his pocket before running from the back door with a six shooter in one hand and either a knife and a rifle in the other. As he emerged, the Invaders shot him dead. The killers pinned a note on Champion&#x27;s bullet-riddled chest that read, &quot;Cattle Thieves Beware.&quot; Jack Flagg, who after escaping his pursuers, &quot;rode to Buffalo where he reported Champion&#x27;s dilemma to the townsfolk. Sheriff Angus then raised a posse of 200 men over the next 24 hours and set out for the KC on Sunday night, April 10&quot;.

Artifacts from the Johnson County War, including the local KC Fight and Nate Champion related items are on display at the Hoofprints of the Past Museum.
