<text>Thyateira (also Thyatira; ) was the name of an ancient Greek city in Asia Minor, now the modern Turkish city of Akhisar (&quot;white castle&quot;), Manisa Province. The name is probably Lydian. It lies in the far west of Turkey, southwest of Istanbul and east-northeast of Athens. It is about from the Aegean Sea.

==History==
It was an ancient Greek city called Pelopia () and Semiramis (), before it was renamed to Thyateira (Θυάτειρα), during the Hellenistic era in 290 BC, by the King Seleucus I Nicator. He was at war with Lysimachus when he learned that his wife had given birth to a daughter. According to Stephanus of Byzantium, he called this city &quot;Thuateira&quot; from Greek θυγάτηρ, θυγατέρα (&quot;thugatēr&quot;, &quot;thugatera&quot;), meaning &quot;daughter&quot;, although it is likely that it is an older, Lydian name. In classical times, Thyatira stood on the border between Lydia and Mysia. During the Roman era, (1st century AD), it was famous for its dyeing facilities and was a center of the purple cloth trade. Among the ancient ruins of the city, inscriptions have been found relating to the guild of dyers in the city. Indeed, more guilds συντεχνία suntechuia (syndicate) are known in Thyatira than any other contemporary city in the Roman province of Asia (inscriptions mention the following: wool-workers, linen-workers, makers of outer garments, dyers, leather-workers, tanners, potters, bakers, slave-dealers, and bronze-smiths).

In early Christian times, Thyateira was home to a significant Christian church, mentioned as one of the seven Churches of the Book of Revelation in the Book of Revelation. According to Revelation, a woman named Jezebel (who called herself a prophetess) taught and seduced the Christians of Thyateira to commit sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols. However, some commentators such as Benson and Doddridge have concluded that what is being here practised in Thyatira is the same apostasy promoted in Israel by Jezebel as mentioned in the Books of Kings and that use of her name here is a direct reference to such. Indeed, as Doddridge notes, &quot;the resemblance appears so great&quot; that, in his view, it is the &quot;same heresy which is represented&quot;.

The Apostle Paul and Silas might have visited Thyateira during Paul&#x27;s second or third journey, Acts 16:13–16. They visited several small unnamed towns in the general vicinity during the second journey. While in Philippi, Paul and Silas stayed with a woman named Lydia from Thyateira, who continued to help them even after they were jailed and released.

In 366, a battle fought near Thyateira saw the army of Roman emperor Valens defeat Roman usurper Procopius.

==Notable people==
Artemidorus () of Thyateira was an athlete who won the Stadion race in the 193rd Olympiad (8 BC).

Nicander (), also known as Nicander of Thyateira () was an ancient Greek grammarian.

Lydia of Thyatira, businesswoman in the Acts of the Apostles chapter 16 verse 11–40.

==Bishopric==
The city was home to a Christian community from the apostolic period. The community continued until 1922, when the Orthodox Christian population was deported.

In 1922, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople appointed an exarch for Western and Central Europe with the title Archbishop of Thyateira. The current archbishop of Thyateira (since 2019) is Nikitas Lulias. The Archbishop of Thyateira resides in London and has pastoral responsibility for the Greek Orthodox Church in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta.

The see of Thyatira is also included, without archiepiscopal rank, in the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s list of titular sees.

<doc id="143745" wikidata="Q3911" url="?curid=143745" title="Albert II of Belgium">
<text>Albert II (born 6 June 1934) is a member of the Belgian royal family who reigned as King of the Belgians from 9 August 1993 until his abdication on 21 July 2013.

Albert II is the son of King Leopold III and the last living child of Queen Astrid, born a princess of Sweden. He is the younger brother of the late Grand Duchess Joséphine-Charlotte of Luxembourg and King Baudouin, whom he succeeded following Baudouin&#x27;s death in 1993. He married Donna Paola Ruffo di Calabria (now Queen Paola), with whom he had three children. Albert&#x27;s eldest son, Philippe, is the current King of the Belgians.

On 3 July 2013, King Albert II attended a midday session of the Belgian cabinet. He then announced that, on 21 July, Belgian National Day, he would abdicate the throne for health reasons. He was succeeded by his son Philippe on 21 July 2013. In doing so, he was also the second Belgian monarch to abdicate, following his father, Leopold III, who abdicated in 1951, albeit under very different circumstances.

== Early life ==
Prince Albert was born at the Château of Stuyvenberg in Laeken, northern Brussels, as the second son and youngest child of King Leopold III and his first wife, Princess Astrid of Sweden. He was second in line to the throne at birth, and was given the title Prince of Liège. When Prince Albert was one year old, Queen Astrid died in Switzerland in a car accident on 29 August 1935, in which King Leopold, who was driving the vehicle, was lightly injured. The King remarried to Mary Lilian Baels (later became Princess of Réthy) in 1941. The couple produced three children: Prince Alexandre, Princess Marie-Christine and Princess Marie-Esméralda (who is also Albert&#x27;s goddaughter). Albert and his siblings had a close relationship with their stepmother and they called her &quot;Mother&quot;.

During World War II, on 10 May 1940, at the time when Belgium was being invaded, Prince Albert, his elder sister Princess Joséphine-Charlotte and his elder brother Prince Baudouin, left the country for France and later Spain. The Prince and the Princess returned to Belgium on 2 August 1940. They continued their studies until 1944, either at Laeken, or at the Castle of Ciergnon in the Ardennes. In June 1944, at the time of the Allied landings, King Leopold, his wife Princess Lilian and the royal children were deported by the Germans to Hirschstein, Germany, and later to Strobl, Austria, where they were released by the American 106th Cavalry Regiment on 7 May 1945. Owing to the political situation in Belgium, King Leopold and his family moved to the villa &quot;Le Reposoir&quot; in Pregny, Switzerland, when they left Austria in October 1945 and stayed until July 1950. During that time, Prince Albert would continue his education in a secondary school in Geneva. King Leopold III, accompanied by Prince Baudouin and Prince Albert, returned to Belgium on 22 July 1950.

== Marriage and family ==

In 1958, Albert went to the Vatican to witness the coronation of Pope John XXIII. At a reception at the Belgian Embassy, he met Italian Donna Paola Ruffo di Calabria. Prince Albert proposed marriage to her, to which she accepted. Two months after their meeting, the prince introduced his future wife to his family, and four months later to the press. The couple were married on 2 July 1959, one-and-a-half years before Albert&#x27;s older brother, the king, got married (a marriage which would prove childless). Albert and Paola have three children, twelve grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Their children are:

*King Philippe (born 15 April 1960 at the Belvédère Château in Brussels)
*Princess Astrid (born 5 June 1962 at the Belvédère Château in Brussels)
*Prince Laurent (born 19 October 1963 at the Belvédère Château in Brussels)

=== Delphine Boël ===
In 1997, the Belgian satirical magazine &quot;Père Ubu&quot; reported that the Belgian sculptor Delphine Boël (born 22 February 1968) was King Albert II&#x27;s extramarital daughter. It took some years for the Belgian mainstream media to report this news. According to Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, the mother of Delphine, she and Albert shared an 18-year-long relationship into which Delphine was born.

In June 2013, Boël summoned the then King and his two older children (the then Duke of Brabant and the Archduchess of Austria-Este) to appear in court. She hoped to use DNA tests to prove that she is the King&#x27;s daughter. As the King enjoyed complete immunity under the law, Boël decided to summon his elder children as well. The king abdicated the following month, in July 2013. After the King&#x27;s abdication, Boël abandoned her first suit to introduce a second one only against the former King as he was no longer protected by immunity and the first claim would have been judged according to the situation at the time of the introduction of the claim.

In March 2017, the Court ruled that her claim was unfounded, and her lawyers said she would take the claim to appeal. On 25 October 2018, the Court of Appeal decided that Delphine Boël is not a descendant of Jacques Boël, and ordered King Albert to undergo DNA testing. His lawyer announced that he would seek further advice about a possible referral to Belgium&#x27;s Cour de Cassation / Hof van Cassatie. In 2019, the King&#x27;s lawyer confirmed he would not provide a DNA sample in the case.

On 29 May 2019, it was reported by CNN that Albert II had submitted a DNA sample after a Belgian court ruled on 16 May that he would be fined 5,000 euros for each day that he failed to do so, although he would continue to challenge the ruling, according to his attorney, . The results of these DNA samples were released on 27 January 2020 by Alain Berenboom, confirming Delphine Boël as Albert II&#x27;s daughter. Albert II confirmed this on 27 January 2020 in a press release. &quot;The king will treat all his children as equal,&quot; Berenboom said, according to VTM News. &quot;King Albert now has four children.&quot;

While it was proven that Boël was his biological daughter, her legal status as a daughter was not recognized until a 1 October 2020 ruling of the Brussels Court of Appeal, which also recognized Boël as a princess of Belgium and granted her the new surname of Saxe-Coburg.

==Official role==
As the younger brother of the childless King Baudouin, Prince Albert was the heir-presumptive to the throne. Albert&#x27;s son Philippe was groomed to eventually succeed. On Baudouin&#x27;s death, Albert was sworn in before parliament, on 9 August 1993, as King of the Belgians.

As King, Albert&#x27;s duties included representing Belgium at home and abroad on state visits, trade missions, and at high level international meetings as well as taking an interest in Belgian society, culture and enterprise. The King had a constitutional role which came into play in 2010–2011 when Belgium&#x27;s parliament was unable to agree on a government. When the crisis was resolved, Albert swore in the new government.

In 1984, he set up the Prince Albert Foundation, to promote expertise in foreign trade.

Albert sparked controversy in his December 2012 Christmas speech by comparing modern &quot;populist movements&quot; with those of the 1930s. This was seen by several political commentators, as well as many Flemish politicians, as aimed implicitly at the large Flemish nationalist party, the N-VA. Bart De Wever, the party&#x27;s leader, called for the King&#x27;s role in the formation of Belgian governments to be changed in the wake of this comment since he &quot;could no longer see the monarch as playing the constitutional role of referee.&quot;

===Abdication===
On 3 July 2013, 79-year-old King Albert II attended a midday session of the Belgian cabinet, where he revealed his intention to abdicate to Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo and to the deputy prime ministers. This came less than one month after the king and two of his children had been asked to appear in court by the Belgian sculptor Delphine Boël, who was intent on proving that the king was her biological father. According to a letter sent by the King to the Prime Minister and dated 3 July 2013, and which was made public, the King had already broached the topic of his intention to abdicate several times with the Prime Minister, who had asked him to reconsider it. At 6 pm (CET) the King announced in a recorded radio and television speech that on 21 July, Belgium&#x27;s National Day, he would abdicate the throne for health reasons. He was succeeded by his elder son, Philippe.

After his abdication on 21 July 2013 it was decided that he would be styled as &quot;His Majesty&quot; King Albert II, the same form of address granted to his father, Leopold III, after his abdication.

<text>The House of Mussorgsky (), the name of an old Russian noble family, which is one of the branches of rich boyar family of , descendants of princes of Smolensk from Rurikid stock. The family traces its name to Roman Vasilyevich Monastyrev, nicknamed Mussorga (18th generation from Rurik). Peter Ivanovich Mussorgsky governed Staritsa in 1620. One representative of this family is the composer Modest Petrovich Mussorgsky.

== History ==
In the genealogy of the Princes of Smolensk, which is in the Velvet Book and other genealogical works, it is shown that the great-grandson of Great Prince Vladimir Svyatoslavich, Vladimir the Great, who christianized the Rus&#x27; land, the Grand Duke Vladimir Vsevolodovich Monomakh had a son Mstislav, Prince of Smolensk, and this one had a son Rostislav, Prince of Smolensk. The aforementioned Prince Mstislav had a great-grandson, Grand Duke Yuri Svyatoslavich of Smolensk. After the death of his father Yuri, the underaged Prince Alexander was taken by his grandmother – Princess Nastasia – who bought him a votchina (estate) in the White Lakes, became a nun and nursed him in the monastery, from which he was called (), and from him, the Monastyrevs started. Children of Alexander had lost the titles of Princes.

The was the only family of Monastyrevs stock, including the Monastyrevs themselves, to receive a coat of arms from the ruling Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov dynasty. In 1857, Historian Pyotr Dolgorukov did not deny their ancestry but explicitly questioned their future existence, writing only 5 lines about the family, finishing the paragraph with the anti-punctuation [?.] two signs together: &quot;For their origin, see the previous article about the Monastyrevs. Lyapun and Tretyak, the Yakov children, the Musorgskies, were granted estates in the Moscow district on 2 October 1550. Two Mussorgskys owned inhabited estates in 1699. The coat of arms of this family is not in the armorial, and we doubt whether it [the feminine word for &#x27;family&#x27; in Russian is also identical to &#x27;surname&#x27; in English] still exists today?.&quot;

<text>Gidea Park () is a neighbourhood in the east of Romford in the London Borough of Havering, south-east England. Predominantly an affluent and residential area, it was historically located in the county of Essex. It saw significant expansion in the early 20th century, with exhibitions of housing and town planning (the first being known as Romford Garden Suburb) and the construction of a railway station on the main line out from London Liverpool Street station.

==Locale==
Gidea Park is approximately east of Charing Cross and east of Romford town centre.

It is south-west of the Gallows Corner junction where the A12, A127 and A118 roads meet.

Harold Wood is to the east of Gidea Park, Ardleigh Green and Emerson Park are to the south-east, and Hornchurch is to the south.

==History==
===Early history===
Thomas Cooke, a Suffolk man who became London Mayor in 1462, was granted a Royal Charter for Royal Liberty of Havering-atte-Bower, which enabled him to build a country house, which he named &quot;Geddy Hall&quot;. The word &quot;geddy&quot; was so named after the lake and its livestock; &quot;ged&quot; (meaning pike) and &quot;ea&quot; (water). The house remained unfinished for at least a century, because of his numerous incarcerations in the Tower of London for high treason. Upon his death in 1478, the estate was passed down through the Cooke family and eventually to his great-grandson, Anthony Cooke, who was a tutor for Edward VI. After a brief period abroad, Anthony returned to Havering-atte-Bower and completed the building of Geddy Hall, which later became Gidea Hall.
In 1657, the hall and its grounds were sold to Richard Emes, a local businessman, for £9,000. Upon the Restoration, the estate was bought back by the Crown and passed through the ownerships of various nobilities, before eventually being sold through public auction, shortly before the Coronation of Queen Victoria.

===Exhibition houses===

In 1909 Herbert Raphael, John Tudor Walters and Charles McCurdy, three Liberal Members of Parliament (MPs) who had links with the Hampstead Garden Suburb development, formed a company with the objective of building a new garden suburb on the Gidea Hall estate. Raphael also reached agreement with the Great Eastern Railway for a new station on the main line from London Liverpool Street to serve the new suburb.

Romford Garden Suburb was constructed between July 1910 and June 1911 on the Gidea Hall and Balgores estates (respectively north and south of Hare Street, now called Main Road) as an exhibition of town planning. A total of 159 cottages and houses were designed by more than 100 architects, many of them of considerable reputation. Most of the cottages were built in Risebridge Road and Meadway; most of the houses were built in Parkway and Reed Pond Walk. A smaller number of Exhibition houses were also constructed on the Balgores estate, such as in Squirrels Heath Avenue and Balgores Lane.

Competitions were held to select the best town planning scheme for the suburb, and the best designs for houses resulted in those being sold at a well-above average £500 and cottages at £375. Of the 159 properties, 132 were entered into the competitions. The winner of the best designed house was No. 54 Parkway by Geoffry Lucas and the best cottage was No. 36 Meadway, designed by C. M. Crickmer. A competition for the builders for best workmanship was won by Falkner &amp; Son who built No. 35 Meadway and No. 43 Heath Drive.

Known today as the &quot;Exhibition houses&quot;, and set in their garden suburb known as the &quot;Exhibition estate&quot;, the properties are fine examples of the domestic architecture of their time and are a significant feature of the Gidea Park area. Six of them are now listed buildings: Nos. 41 and 43 Heath Drive, Nos. 16 and 27 Meadway and Nos. 36 and 38 Reed Pond Walk.

A further 35 houses, mostly of contemporary flat-roofed design, were built in 1934–35 in Heath Drive, Brook Road, and Eastern Avenue for a Modern Homes Exhibition. One such house, No. 64 Heath Drive, by Berthold Lubetkin&#x27;s Tecton Group architectural group, was the special responsibility of Francis Skinner and is now also a listed structure. The area was provided with a parish church in the form of St Michael&#x27;s Church, Gidea Park in 1931.

The area was designated a conservation area in 1970.

==Society and leisure==
The Royal Liberty School in Upper Brentwood Road was the first school in Britain (and possibly in Europe) to install an electronic computer (an Elliot 903), in 1965.

Romford Hockey Club is based in Gidea Park. It is also the location of Gidea Park Lawn Tennis Club, Romford Golf Club, and two public parks: Lodge Farm and Raphael park. There are also a number of shops, pubs, restaurants and a library.

Essex County Cricket Club played first-class cricket at the Gidea Park Sports Ground between 1950 and 1968.

==Transport==

Gidea Park railway station is on the Great Eastern Main Line; it is served by Elizabeth line trains between , London Liverpool Street, and .

Romford railway station is the next station on the line towards London. It sees additional express and stopping services to and from Liverpool Street, operated by Greater Anglia; it is also the terminus of a branch line to Upminster.

A number of London Bus routes run through Gidea Park towards Romford, Lakeside Shopping Centre, Dagenham, Harold Hill, Harold Wood, Gallows Corner and Brentwood; these are operated by Stagecoach London and Blue Triangle.

<text>The Lake District, also known as &quot;the Lakes&quot; or &quot;Lakeland&quot;, is a mountainous region and national park in Cumbria, North West England. It is famous for its landscape, including its lakes, coast, and mountains, and for its literary associations with Beatrix Potter, John Ruskin, and the Lake Poets.

The Lakeland fells, or mountains, include England&#x27;s highest: Scafell Pike (), Helvellyn () and Skiddaw (). The region also contains sixteen major lakes. They include Windermere, which with a length of and an area of is the longest and largest lake in England, and Wast Water, which at is the deepest lake in England.

The Lake District National Park was established in 1951, and covers an area of , the bulk of the region. It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2017.

== National Park ==

The Lake District National Park includes all of the central Lake District, though the town of Kendal, some coastal areas and the Cartmel and Furness peninsulas are outside the park boundary. The area was designated a national park on 9 May 1951, a month after the Peak District, the first UK national park. It retained its original boundaries until 2016, when it was extended by 3% to the east, in the direction of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, to incorporate areas land of high landscape value around the Lune Valley.

The national park received 18.14 million tourist visitors in 2022. This equates to 29.15 million tourist days, counting visits of greater than three hours. It is the largest of the thirteen national parks in England and Wales and the second largest in the UK after the Cairngorms National Park. Its aim is to protect the landscape by restricting unwelcome change by industry or commerce. The area of the national park, with the exception of the 2016 extension, was designated a World Heritage Site in 2017 as a cultural landscape. This was the fourth attempt to list the park, after two attempts in the 1980s and one in 2012 failed.

The park is governed by the Lake District National Park Authority, which is based at offices in Kendal. It runs a visitor centre on Windermere at a former country house called Brockhole, Coniston Boating Centre, and information centres. The park authority has 20 members: six appointed by Westmorland and Furness Council, four by Cumberland Council, and ten by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs.

== Human geography ==

=== General ===
The precise extent of the Lake District is undefined, but it is sometimes considered to be slightly larger than that of the National Park, whose total area is about . The park extends just over from east to west and nearly from north to south, with areas such as the Lake District Peninsulas to the south lying outside the National Park.

=== Settlement ===
There are only a few major settlements within this mountainous area: the towns of Keswick; Windermere and Bowness-on-Windermere (which are contiguous); and Ambleside, are the three largest. The economies of all these are heavily dependent on tourism. Significant settlements close to the boundary of the national park include Carlisle, Barrow-in-Furness, Kendal, Ulverston, Dalton-in-Furness, Whitehaven, Workington, Cockermouth, Penrith, Millom and Grange-over-Sands; each of these has important economic links with the area. Other villages are Coniston, Threlkeld, Glenridding, Pooley Bridge, Broughton-in-Furness, Grasmere, Newby Bridge, Staveley, Lindale, Gosforth and Hawkshead. Beyond these are a scattering of hamlets and many isolated farmsteads, some of which are still tied to agriculture; others now function as part of the tourist economy.

=== Communications ===

==== Roads ====

The Lake District is very nearly contained within a box of trunk routes and major A roads. It is flanked to the east by the A6 road, which runs from Kendal to Penrith (though the National Park extension approved in 2015 is east of the A6); across its southern fringes by the A590, which connects the M6 to Barrow-in-Furness, and the A5092, and across its northern edge by the A66 trunk road between Penrith and Workington. The A595 (linking the A66 with the A5092) forms the park boundary from Calder Bridge to Holmrook, then crosses the coastal plain of the park until turning inland at the Whicham Valley, forming much of the park boundary again until joining the A5092 at Grizebeck.

Besides these, a few A roads penetrate the area itself, notably the A591 which runs north-westwards from Kendal to Windermere and then on to Keswick. It continues up the east side of Bassenthwaite Lake. &quot;The A591, Grasmere, Lake District&quot; was short-listed in the 2011 Google Street View awards in the Most Romantic Street category. The A593 and A5084 link the Ambleside and Coniston areas with the A590 to the south whilst the A592 and A5074 similarly link Windermere with the A590. The A592 also continues northwards from Windermere to Ullswater and Penrith by way of the Kirkstone Pass.

Some valleys which are not penetrated by A roads are served by B roads. The B5289 serves Lorton Vale and Buttermere and links via the Honister Pass with Borrowdale. The B5292 ascends the Whinlatter Pass from Lorton Vale before dropping down to Braithwaite near Keswick. The B5322 serves the valley of St John&#x27;s in the Vale whilst Great Langdale is served by the B5343. Other valleys such as Little Langdale, Eskdale and Dunnerdale are served by minor roads. The last of these is connected with the first two by the Wrynose and Hardknott passes respectively; both of these passes are known for their steep gradients and are together one of the most popular climbs in the United Kingdom for cycling enthusiasts. A minor road through the Newlands Valley connects via Newlands Hause with the B5289 at Buttermere. Wasdale is served by a cul-de-sac minor road, as is Longsleddale and the valleys at Haweswater and Kentmere. There are networks of minor roads in the lower-lying southern part of the area, connecting numerous communities between Kendal, Windermere, and Coniston.

==== Railways and ferries ====
The West Coast Main Line skirts the eastern edge of the Lake District and the Cumbrian Coast Line passes through the southern and western fringes of the area. A single railway line, the Windermere Branch Line, penetrates from Kendal to Windermere via Staveley. Railways once served Broughton-in-Furness and Coniston (closed to passengers in 1958) and another ran from Penrith to Cockermouth via Keswick (closed west of Keswick in 1966 and completely in 1972). Part of the track of the latter is used by the improved A66 trunk road.

The Cumbrian Coast line has three stations within the boundaries of the national park (and additionally Drigg, about a third of a mile from the park boundary). The line gives railway enthusiasts and others a flavour of a pre-Beeching railway line, with features like manually operated level crossing gates, as well as giving a good connection to the steam railway into Eskdale and providing access for cyclists and serious walkers to the Western Fells.

The narrow gauge Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway runs from Ravenglass on the west coast up Eskdale as far as Dalegarth Station near the hamlet of Boot, catering for tourists. Another heritage railway, the Lakeside and Haverthwaite Railway, runs between Lake Windermere and Haverthwaite, and tourists can connect at Lakeside with the boats up the lake to Bowness.

A vehicle-carrying cable ferry, the Windermere Ferry, runs frequent services across Windermere. There are also seasonal passenger boats on Coniston Water, Derwent Water, and Ullswater.

==== Footpaths and bridleways ====
There are many paths over which the public has a right of way, all of which are signposted at their origin on public roads and at some other points. Within the area of the National Park in 2012 there were of public footpaths,
 of public bridleways,
 of restricted byways and
 of byways open to all traffic. There is also a general &quot;right to roam&quot; in open country, which includes approximately 50% of the national park.

Many of these tracks arose centuries ago and were used either as ridge highways (such as along High Street) or as passes for travelling across the ridges between settlements in the valleys. Historically these paths were not planned for reaching summits, but more recently they are used by fell walkers for that purpose. The Coast to Coast Walk, which crosses the north of England from the Irish Sea to the North Sea, traverses the national park from west to east.

Bridleways are intended for horse riding and walkers, with cyclists also permitted to use them. Cyclists must give way to all other bridleway users. Motor vehicles are only allowed on &quot;byways open to all traffic&quot; (green lanes) but in practice Traffic Regulation Orders have been brought in on several prohibiting motor traffic, although a system of permits operates on Gatescarth Pass.

==== Land ownership ====
Most of the land within the national park is in private ownership, with about 55% registered as agricultural land. Landowners include:

* Individual farmers and other private landowners, with more than half of the agricultural land farmed by the owners.
* The National Trust owns around 25% of the total area (including some lakes and land of significant landscape value).

== Physical geography ==
The Lake District is a roughly circular upland massif, deeply dissected by a broadly radial pattern of major valleys which are largely the result of repeated glaciations over the last 2 million years. The apparent radial pattern is not from a central dome, but from an axial watershed extending from St Bees Head in the west to Shap in the east. Most of these valleys display the U-shaped cross-section characteristic of glacial origin and often contain long narrow lakes in bedrock hollows, with tracts of relatively flat ground at their infilled heads, or where they are divided by lateral tributaries (Buttermere-Crummock Water; Derwent Water-Bassenthwaite Lake). Smaller lakes known as tarns occupy glacial cirques at higher elevations. It is the abundance of both which has led to the area becoming known as the Lake District.

Many of the higher fells are rocky, while moorland predominates lower down. Vegetation cover in better-drained areas includes bracken and heather, although much of the land is boggy, due to the high rainfall. Deciduous native woodland occurs on many of the steeper slopes below the tree line, but with native oak supplemented by extensive conifer plantations in many areas, particularly Grizedale Forest in the generally lower southern part of the area. The Lake District extends to the sea to the west and south.

The highest mountain in England, Scafell Pike (978 m or 3209 feet), has a far-reaching view on a clear day, ranging from the Galloway Hills of Scotland, the Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, and Snowdonia in Wales.


=== Cumbrian Mountains ===

The mountains (or &#x27;fells&#x27;) of the Lake District are known as the &quot;Cumbrian Mountains&quot;, &quot;Cumbrian Fells&quot; or &quot;Lakeland Fells&quot;. The four highest fells exceed . These are:
* Scafell Pike, 
* Scafell, 
* Helvellyn, 
* Skiddaw, 

==== Northern Fells ====
The Northern Fells are a clearly defined range of hills contained within a diameter circle between Keswick in the southwest and Caldbeck in the northeast. They culminate in the peak of Skiddaw. Other notable peaks are Blencathra (also known as Saddleback) () and Carrock Fell. Bassenthwaite Lake occupies the valley between this massif and the North Western Fells.

==== North Western Fells ====
The North Western Fells lie between Borrowdale and Bassenthwaite Lake to the east and Buttermere and Lorton Vale to the west. Their southernmost point is at Honister Pass. This area includes the Derwent Fells above the Newlands Valley and hills to the north amongst which are Dale Head, Robinson. To the north stand Grasmoor, highest in the range at , Grisedale Pike and the hills around the valley of Coledale, and in the far northwest is Thornthwaite Forest and Lord&#x27;s Seat. The fells in this area are rounded Skiddaw slate, with few tarns and relatively few rock faces.

==== Western Fells ====

The Western Fells lie between Buttermere and Wasdale, with Sty Head forming the apex of a large triangle. Ennerdale bisects the area, which consists of the High Stile ridge north of Ennerdale, the Loweswater Fells in the far northwest, the Pillar group in the southwest, and Great Gable () near Sty Head. Other tops include Seatallan, Haystacks and Kirk Fell. This area is craggy and steep, with the impressive pinnacle of Pillar Rock its showpiece. Wastwater, located in this part, is England&#x27;s deepest lake.

==== Central Fells ====
The Central Fells are lower in elevation than surrounding areas of fell, peaking at at High Raise. They take the form of a ridge running between Derwent Water in the west and Thirlmere in the east, from Keswick in the north to Langdale Pikes in the south. A spur extends southeast to Loughrigg Fell above Ambleside. The central ridge running north over High Seat is exceptionally boggy.

==== Eastern Fells ====

The Eastern Fells consist of a long north-to-south ridge, the Helvellyn range, running from Clough Head to Seat Sandal with the Helvellyn at its highest point. The western slopes of these summits tend to be grassy, with rocky corries and crags on the eastern side. The Fairfield group lies to the south of the range and forms a similar pattern with towering rock faces and hidden valleys spilling into the Patterdale valley. It culminates in the height of Red Screes overlooking the Kirkstone Pass.

==== Far Eastern Fells ====

The Far Eastern Fells refers to all of the Lakeland fells to the east of Ullswater and the A592 road running south to Windermere. At , the peak known as High Street is the highest point on a complex ridge that runs broadly north-south and overlooks the hidden valley of Haweswater to its east. In the north of this region are the lower fells of Martindale Common and Bampton Common whilst in the south are the fells overlooking the Kentmere valley. Further to the east, beyond Mardale and Longsleddale is Shap Fell, an extensive area consisting of high moorland, more rolling and Pennine in nature than the mountains to the west.

==== Southern Fells ====

The Southern Fells occupy the southwestern quarter of the Lake District. They can be regarded as comprising a northern grouping between Wasdale, Eskdale, and the two Langdale valleys, a southeastern group east of Dunnerdale and south of Little Langdale, and a southwestern group bounded by Eskdale to the north and Dunnerdale to the east.

The first group includes England&#x27;s highest mountains: Scafell Pike in the centre, at and Scafell to the southwest. Though it is slightly lower, Scafell has a rockface, Scafell Crag, on its northern side. This group also includes the Wastwater Screes overlooking Wasdale, the Glaramara ridge overlooking Borrowdale, the three tops of Crinkle Crags, Bowfell and Esk Pike. The core of the area is drained by the infant River Esk. Collectively these are some of the Lake District&#x27;s most rugged hillsides.

The second group, otherwise known as the Furness Fells or Coniston Fells, have as their northern boundary the steep and narrow Hardknott and Wrynose passes. The highest are Old Man of Coniston and Swirl How which slightly exceed .

The third group to the west of the Duddon includes Harter Fell and the long ridge leading over Whitfell to Black Combe and the sea. The south of this region consists of lower forests and knolls, with Kirkby Moor on the southern boundary. The southwestern Lake District ends near the Furness peninsula and Barrow-in-Furness, a town which many Lake District residents rely on for basic amenities. Miterdale Head Wood is a site of special scientific interest in the region.

==== Southeastern area ====
The southeastern area is the territory between Coniston Water and Windermere and east of Windermere towards Kendal and south to Lindale. There are no high summits in this area which are mainly low hills, knolls and limestone cuestas such as Gummer&#x27;s How and Whitbarrow. Indeed, it rises only as high as at Top o&#x27; Selside east of Coniston Water; the wide expanse of Grizedale Forest stands between the two lakes. Kendal and Morecambe Bay stand at the eastern and southern edges of the area.

=== Valleys ===

The main radial valleys are (clockwise from the south) Dunnerdale, Eskdale, Wasdale, Ennerdale, the Vale of Lorton, and Buttermere valley, the Derwent Valley and Borrowdale, the Ullswater valley, Haweswater valley, Longsleddale, the Kentmere valley, those converging on the head of Windermere - Grasmere, Great Langdale and Little Langdale, and the Coniston Water valley. The valleys break the mountains up into blocks, which have been described by various authors in different ways. The most frequently encountered approach is that made popular by Alfred Wainwright who published seven separate area guides to the Lakeland Fells.

=== Lakes ===

Only one of the lakes in the Lake District is called by that name, Bassenthwaite Lake. All the others such as Windermere, Coniston Water, Ullswater and Buttermere are meres, tarns and waters, with &quot;mere&quot; being the least common and &quot;water&quot; being the most common. The major lakes and reservoirs in the National Park are given below.

*Bassenthwaite Lake
*Brotherswater
*Buttermere
*Coniston Water
*Crummock Water
*Derwent Water
*Devoke Water
*Elter Water
*Ennerdale Water
*Esthwaite Water
*Grasmere
*Haweswater Reservoir
*Hayeswater
*Loweswater
*Rydal Water
*Thirlmere
*Ullswater
*Wast Water
*Windermere
=== Woodlands ===
Below the tree line are wooded areas, including British and European native oak woodlands and introduced softwood plantations. The woodlands provide habitats for native English wildlife. The native red squirrel is found in the Lake District and a few other parts of England. In parts of the Lake District, the rainfall is higher than in any other part of England. This gives Atlantic mosses, ferns, lichen, and liverworts the chance to grow. There is some ancient woodland in the National Park. Management of the woodlands varies: some are coppiced, some pollarded, some left to grow naturally, and some provide grazing and shelter.

===Coast===
The Lake District extends to the coast of the Irish Sea from Drigg in the north to Silecroft in the south, encompassing the estuaries of the Esk and its tributaries, the Irt and the Mite. The intertidal zone of the combined estuaries includes sand, shingle and mudflats, and saltmarsh. The dune systems on either side of the estuary are protected as nature reserves; Drigg Dunes and Gullery to the north and Eskmeals Dunes to the south. South of the estuary, the coast is formed in low cliffs of glacial till, sands, and gravels.

The district also extends to the tidal waters of Morecambe Bay and several of its estuaries alongside the Furness and Cartmel Peninsulas, designated on M6 motorway signposts as the &quot;Lake District Peninsulas&quot;, and the southern portions of which lie outside the park. These are the Duddon Estuary, the Leven Estuary, and the western banks and tidal flats of the Kent Estuary. These areas are each characterised by sand and mudflats of scenic and wildlife interest. The coast is backed by extensive flats of raised marine deposits left when the relative sea level was higher.

== Geology ==

The Lake District&#x27;s geology is very complex but well-studied. A granite batholith beneath the area is responsible for this upland massif, its relatively low density causing the area to be &quot;buoyed up&quot;. The granite can be seen at the surface as the Ennerdale, Skiddaw, Carrock Fell, Eskdale, and Shap granites.

Broadly speaking the area can be divided into three bands, divisions which run southwest to the northeast. Generally speaking, the rocks become younger from the northwest to the southeast. The northwestern band is composed of early to mid-Ordovician sedimentary rocks, largely mudstones and siltstones of marine origin. Together they comprise the Skiddaw Group and include the rocks traditionally known as the Skiddaw Slates. Their friability generally leads to mountains with relatively smooth slopes such as Skiddaw itself.

The central band is a mix of volcanic and sedimentary rocks of mid-to-late Ordovician age comprising the lavas and tuffs of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, erupted as the former Iapetus Ocean was subducted beneath what is now the Scottish border during the Caledonian orogeny. The northern central peaks, such as Great Rigg, were produced by considerable lava flows. These lava eruptions were followed by a series of pyroclastic eruptions which produced a series of calderas, one of which includes present-day Scafell Pike. These pyroclastic rocks give rise to the craggy landscapes typical of the central fells.

The southeastern band comprises the mudstones and wackes of the Windermere Supergroup and which includes (successively) the rocks of the Dent, Stockdale, Tranearth, Coniston, and Kendal groups. These are generally a little less resistant to erosion than the sequence of the rock to the north and underlie much of the lower landscapes around Coniston and Windermere.

Later intrusions have formed individual outcrops of igneous rock in each of these groups.
Around the edges of these Ordovician and Silurian rocks on the northern, eastern, and southern fringes of the area is a semi-continuous outcrop of Carboniferous Limestone seen most spectacularly at places like Whitbarrow Scar and Scout Scar.
== Climate ==
The Lake District&#x27;s location on the northwest coast of England, coupled with its mountainous geography, makes it the wettest part of England. The UK Met Office reports average annual precipitation of more than , but with considerable local variation.

Although the entire region receives above-average rainfall, there is a wide disparity between the amounts of rainfall in the western and eastern lakes, as the Lake District experiences relief rainfall. Seathwaite, Borrowdale is the wettest inhabited place in England with an average of of rain a year, while nearby Sprinkling Tarn is even wetter, recording over per year; by contrast, Keswick, at the lower end of Borrowdale, receives every year, and Penrith (just outside the Lake District) only . March to June tend to be the driest months, with October to January the wettest, but at low levels, there is relatively little difference between months.

Although there are gales in the sheltered valleys on only five days a year on average, the Lake District is generally very windy: the coastal areas have 20 days of gales, and the fell tops around 100 days of gales per year. The maritime climate means that the Lake District has relatively moderate temperature variations throughout the year. The mean temperature in the valleys ranges from about in January to around in July. (By comparison, Moscow, at the same latitude, ranges from .)

The relatively low height of most of the fells means that, while snow is expected during the winter, they can be free of snow at any time of the year. Normally, significant snowfall only occurs between November and April. On average, snow falls on Helvellyn 67 days per year. Snow typically falls on 20 days of the year in the valleys, with a further 200 days with some rain, and 145 completely dry days. Hill fog is common at any time of year, and the fells average only around 2.5 hours of sunshine per day, increasing to around 4.1 hours per day on the coastal plains.

== Wildlife ==
The Lake District is home to a great variety of wildlife, because of its varied topography, lakes, and forests. It provides a home for the red squirrel and colonies of sundew and butterwort, two of the few carnivorous plants native to Britain. The Lake District is a major sanctuary for the red squirrel and has the largest population in England (out of the estimated 140,000 red squirrels in the United Kingdom, compared with about 2.5 million grey squirrels).

The Lake District is home to a range of bird species, and the RSPB maintain a reserve in Haweswater. England&#x27;s last nesting pair of golden eagles was found in the Lake District; the female was last seen in 2004 and the male was last seen in 2015. Following recolonisation attempts, a pair of ospreys nested in the Lake District for the first time in over 150 years near Bassenthwaite Lake during 2001. Ospreys now frequently migrate north from Africa in the spring to nest in the Lake District, and a total of 23 chicks have fledged in the area since 2001. Another raptor that has had recolonisation attempts is the red kite which, as of 2012, has a population of approximately 90 in the dense forest areas near Grizedale and successfully bred in 2014, the first breeding success in Cumbria in over 200 years. Conservationists hope the reintroduction will create a large population in the Lake District and in North West England where red kite numbers are low. Other bird species resident to the Lake District include the buzzard, dipper, peregrine and common raven. Seasonal birds include the ring ouzel and the common redstart.

The lakes of the Lake District support three rare and endangered species of fish. The vendace is found only in Derwent Water and, until 2008, Bassenthwaite Lake. Vendace have struggled in recent years with naturally occurring algae becoming a threat and the lakes gradually getting warmer.
Vendace have been moved to higher lakes on a number of occasions to preserve the species, notably in 2005 and 2011. The Lakes are also home to two other rare species: the schelly, which lives in Brothers Water, Haweswater, Red Tarn and Ullswater, and the Arctic charr, which can be found in Buttermere, Coniston Water, Crummock Water, Ennerdale Water, Haweswater, Loweswater, Thirlmere, Wast Water, and Windermere.
In recent years, important changes have been made to fisheries byelaws covering the northwest region of England, to help protect some of the rarest fish species. In 2002, the Environment Agency introduced a new fisheries byelaw, banning the use of all freshwater fish as live or dead bait in 14 of the lakes in the Lake District: Bassenthwaite Lake, Brothers Water, Buttermere, Coniston Water, Crummock Water, Derwent Water, Ennerdale Water, Haweswater, Loweswater, Red Tarn, Thirlmere, Ullswater, Wast Water, and Windermere. Anglers not complying with the new byelaw can face fines of up to £2,500.

The lakes and waters of the Lake District do not naturally support as many species of fish as other similar habitats in the south of the country and elsewhere in Europe. Some fish that do thrive there are particularly at risk from the introduction of new species. The introduction of non-native fish can lead to the predation of the native fish fauna or competition for food. There is also the risk of disease being introduced, which can further threaten native populations. In some cases, the introduced species can disturb the environment so much that it becomes unsuitable for particular fish. For example, a major problem has been found with ruffe. This non-native fish has now been introduced into several lakes in recent years. It is known that ruffe eats the eggs of vendace, which are particularly vulnerable because of their long incubation period. This means that they are susceptible to predators for up to 120 days. The eggs of other fish, for example roach, are only at risk for as little as three days.

The Lake District supports a distinctive montane lichen flora, with over 55 species recorded from high-level areas. Whilst less diverse than the Scottish Highlands, the region contains several rare species, particularly in areas of base-rich rock. Brown Cove Tarn is of international importance, hosting several species that are rare throughout Europe. The Helvellyn range is particularly significant, with Brown Cove containing the richest lichen assemblages. Key species include &quot;Umbilicaria crustulosa&quot;, which was first discovered in Langdale in 1889. The area&#x27;s lichen communities have been impacted by heavy sheep grazing since the 14th century, resulting in less extensive mats than those found in the Scottish Highlands. The wet climate, with annual precipitation exceeding 4000mm in central areas, combined with acidic rock and intensive grazing, creates challenging conditions for lichen growth. However, some species persist in sheltered locations, particularly in gullies and on boulders around tarns, where they form distinct zonation patterns related to water levels and exposure.

== Economy ==

=== Agriculture and forestry ===
Farming, and in particular sheep farming, has been the major industry in the region since Roman times. The breed most closely associated with the area is the tough Herdwick, with Rough Fell and Swaledale sheep also common. Sheep farming remains important both for the economy of the region and for preserving the landscape which visitors want to see. Features such as dry stone walls, for example, are there as a result of sheep farming. Some land is also used for silage and dairy farming.

The area was badly affected by the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease across the United Kingdom in 2001. The outbreak started in Surrey in February but had spread to Cumbria by end of March. Thousands of sheep, including the native Herdwicks which graze on the fellsides across the district, were destroyed. In replacing the sheep, one problem to overcome was that many of the lost sheep were &quot;heafed&quot;, that is, they knew their part of the unfenced fell and did not stray, with this knowledge being passed between generations. With all the sheep lost at once, this knowledge has to be relearnt and some of the fells have had discreet electric fences strung across them for a period of five years, to allow the sheep to &quot;re-heaf&quot;. At the time of the outbreak, worries existed about the future of certain species of sheep such as Ryeland and Herdwick in the district, however these fears have been allayed and sheep now occupy the district in abundance.

Forestry has also assumed greater importance over the last century with the establishment of extensive conifer plantations around Whinlatter Pass, in Ennerdale, and at Grizedale Forest among other places. There are extensive plantations of non-native pine trees.

=== Industry ===
With its wealth of rock types and their abundance in the landscape, mining and quarrying have long been significant activities in the Lake District economy. In Neolithic times, the Lake District was a major source of stone axes, examples of which have been found all over Britain. The primary site, on the slopes of the Langdale Pikes, is sometimes described as a &quot;stone axe factory&quot; of the Langdale axe industry. Some of the earliest stone circles in Britain are connected with this industry.

Mining, particularly of copper, lead (often associated with quantities of silver), baryte, graphite, and slate, was historically a major Lakeland industry, mainly from the 16th to 19th centuries. Coppiced woodland was used extensively to provide charcoal for smelting. Some mining still takes place today; for example, slate mining continues at the Honister Mines, at the top of Honister Pass. Abandoned mine workings can be found on fellsides throughout the district. The locally mined graphite led to the development of the pencil industry, especially around Keswick.

In the middle of the 19th century, half the world textile industry&#x27;s bobbin supply came from the Lake District area. Over the past century, however, tourism has grown rapidly to become the area&#x27;s primary source of income.

=== Development of tourism ===
====Historical====
Early visitors to the Lake District, who travelled for the education and pleasure of the journey, include Celia Fiennes, who in 1698 undertook a journey the length of England, including riding through Kendal and over Kirkstone Pass into Patterdale. Her experiences and impressions were published in her book &quot;Great Journey to Newcastle and Cornwall&quot;:

As I walked down at this place I was walled on both sides by those inaccessible high rocky barren hills which hang over one&#x27;s head in some places and appear very terrible; and from them springs many little currents of water from the sides and clefts which trickle down to some lower part where it runs swiftly over the stones and shelves in the way, which makes a pleasant rush and murmuring noise and like a snowball is increased by each spring trickling down on either side of those hills, and so descends into the bottoms which are a Moorish ground in which in many places the waters stand, and so form some of those Lakes as it did here.

In 1724, Daniel Defoe published the first volume of &quot;A Tour Thro&#x27; the Whole Island of Great Britain&quot;. He commented on Westmorland that it was:

the wildest, most barren and frightful of any that I have passed over in England, or even Wales itself; the west side, which borders on Cumberland, is indeed bounded by a chain of almost unpassable mountains which, in the language of the country, are called fells.
Towards the end of the 18th century, the area was becoming more popular with travellers. This was partly a result of wars in Continental Europe, restricting the possibility of travel there. In 1778 Thomas West produced &quot;A Guide to the Lakes&quot;, which began the era of modern tourism. West listed &quot;stations&quot;, viewpoints where tourists could enjoy the best views of the landscape, being encouraged to appreciate the formal qualities of the landscape and to apply aesthetic values. At some of these stations, buildings were erected to help this process. The remains of Claife Station (on the western shore Windermere below Claife Heights) can be visited today.

William Wordsworth published his &quot;Guide to the Lakes&quot; in 1810, and by 1835 it had reached its fifth edition, now called &quot;A Guide Through the District of the Lakes in the North of England&quot;. This book was particularly influential in popularising the region. Wordsworth&#x27;s favourite valley was Dunnerdale or the Duddon Valley in the southwest of the Lake District.

The railways led to another expansion in tourism. The Kendal and Windermere Railway was the first to penetrate the Lake District, reaching Kendal in 1846 and Windermere in 1847. The line to Coniston opened in 1848 (although until 1857 this was only linked to the national network by ferries between Fleetwood and Barrow-in-Furness); the line from Penrith through Keswick to Cockermouth in 1865; and the line to Lakeside at the foot of Windermere in 1869. The railways, built with traditional industry in mind, brought with them a huge increase in the number of visitors, thus contributing to the growth of the tourism industry. Railway services were supplemented by steamer boats on the major lakes of Ullswater, Windermere, Coniston Water, and Derwent Water.

The growth in tourist numbers continued into the age of the motor car, when railways began to be closed or run down. The formation of the Lake District National Park in 1951 recognised the need to protect the Lake District environment from excessive commercial or industrial exploitation, preserving that which visitors come to see, without any restriction on the movement of people into and around the district. The M6 Motorway helped bring traffic to the Lake District, passing up its eastern flank.

====Recent====
The narrow roads present a challenge for traffic flow, and since the 1960s certain areas have been very congested. This problem continues, with traffic congestion and parking problems in the towns and villages. Bowness-on-Windermere addressed the parking issue with a new car park at the edge of the community and by extending an existing car park. The Lake District NP publishes a list and map of car parks within its area, allowing tourists to plan their visits accordingly.

Whilst the roads and railways provided easier access to the area, many people were drawn to Lakeland by the publication of the &quot;Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells&quot; by Alfred Wainwright. First published between 1955 and 1966, these books provided detailed information on 214 fells across the region, with carefully hand-drawn maps and panoramas, and also stories and asides which add to the colour of the area. They are still used by many visitors to the area as guides for walking excursions, with the ultimate goal of bagging the complete list of &quot;Wainwrights&quot;. The famous guides were revised by Chris Jesty between 2005 and 2009 to reflect changes, mainly in valley access and paths, and are currently being revised by Clive Hutchby, the author of The Wainwright Companion. The first of the revised volumes, Book One: The Eastern Fells, was published in March 2015; the most recent, Book Six: The North Western Fells, was published in April 2019.

Since the early 1960s, the National Park Authority has employed rangers to help cope with increasing tourism and development, the first being John Wyatt, who has since written several guide books. He was joined two years later by a second, and since then the number of rangers has been rising.

The area has also become associated with the writer Beatrix Potter. Several tourists visit to see her family home, with particularly large numbers coming from Japan.

Tourism has now become the park&#x27;s major industry, with about 12 million visitors each year, mainly from the rest of the UK and from China, Japan, Spain, Germany, and the US. Windermere Lake Steamers are Cumbria&#x27;s most popular charging tourist attraction, with about 1.35 million paying passengers each year, and the local economy is dependent upon tourists. The negative impact of tourism has been seen, however. Soil erosion, caused by walking, is now a significant problem, with millions of pounds being spent to protect overused paths. In 2006, two tourist information centres in the National Park were closed.

Cycling is now popular in the Lake District National Park. A number of long-distance cycle routes go through the Lake District, including coast to coast cycle routes such as the C2C, Hadrian&#x27;s Cycleway, the Reivers Route and the Walney to Wear route. Several towns have also become hubs for road-cycling holidays and cycle touring, such as Keswick and Ambleside. Mountain bikers use the trails constructed at Whinlatter Forest and Grizedale Forest and also have wilder routes available on bridleways.

Cultural tourism is becoming an increasingly important part of the wider tourist industry. The Lake District&#x27;s links with a wealth of artists and writers and its strong history of providing summer theatre performances in the old Blue Box of Century Theatre are strong attractions for visiting tourists. The tradition of theatre is carried on at venues such as Theatre by the Lake in Keswick with its summer season of six plays in repertoire, Christmas and Easter productions, and the many literature, film, mountaineering, jazz, and creative arts festivals, such as the Kendal Mountain Festival and the Keswick Mountain Festival. Two museums, The World of Beatrix Potter and Dove Cottage &amp; The Wordsworth Museum, are also important aspects of the region.

=== Gastronomy ===
Excellent mutton and lamb have been produced locally for generations and traditionally formed the basis of the region&#x27;s many rustic dishes, such as Tatie Pot, a potato-topped mutton casserole. The Traditional Cumberland Sausage is a spiced, unlinked pork sausage with Protected Geographical Status. The Lake District now has a growing reputation for its fine dining although standard pub and café fare continues to dominate. There are 7 Michelin Star restaurants within the World Heritage Site boundaries, with three more less than 5 miles outside (L&#x27;Enclume, Rogan &amp; Co, and Dog and Gun Inn). Those inside the area are: The Cottage in the Wood, Allium at Askham Hall, Old Stamp House, Forest Side, heft, The Samling, and SOURCE, one of the two restaurants at the Gilpin Hotel. Cumbria has many microbreweries and distilleries which distribute local ales, lagers, and craft gin, vodka, and whisky to pubs and restaurants throughout the region.

== Literature and the arts ==

The Lake District has inspired creativity in many fields.
=== Literature ===
The District is intimately associated with English literature of the 18th and 19th centuries. Thomas Gray was the first to bring the region to attention, when he wrote a journal of his Grand Tour in 1769, but it was William Wordsworth whose poems were most famous and influential. Wordsworth&#x27;s poem &quot;I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud&quot;, inspired by the sight of daffodils on the shores of Ullswater, remains one of the most famous in the English language. Out of his long life of eighty years, sixty were spent amid its lakes and mountains, first as a schoolboy at Hawkshead, and afterward living in Grasmere (1799–1813) and Rydal Mount (1813–50). Wordsworth, Coleridge and Southey became known as the Lake Poets.

The poet and his wife are buried in the churchyard of Grasmere; very near to them are the remains of Hartley Coleridge (son of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge), who himself lived for many years in Keswick, Ambleside, and Grasmere. Robert Southey, the Poet Laureate and friend of Wordsworth (who would succeed Southey as Laureate in 1843), was a resident of Keswick for forty years (1803–43), and was buried in Crosthwaite churchyard. Samuel Taylor Coleridge lived for some time in Keswick, and also with the Wordsworths at Grasmere.

The Lake District is mentioned in Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;; Elizabeth Bennet looks forward to a holiday there with her aunt and uncle and is &quot;excessively disappointed&quot; upon learning they cannot travel that far.

The opening of Charlotte Turner Smith&#x27;s novel &quot;Ethelinde&quot; with its atmospheric description of Grasmere, complete with a Gothic abbey, is supposed to have introduced Wordsworth to it as a possible place to live.

From 1807 to 1815 John Wilson lived at Windermere. Thomas de Quincey spent the greater part of the years 1809 to 1828 at Grasmere, in the first cottage which Wordsworth had inhabited. Ambleside, or its environs, was also the place of residence both of Thomas Arnold, who spent holidays there in the last ten years of his life, and of Harriet Martineau, who built herself a house there in 1845. At Keswick, Mrs Lynn Linton (wife of William James Linton) was born in 1822. Brantwood, a house beside Coniston Water, was the home of John Ruskin during the last years of his life. His assistant W. G. Collingwood the author, artist, and antiquarian lived nearby and wrote &quot;Thorstein of the Mere,&quot; set in the Norse period.

In addition to these residents or natives of the Lake District, a variety of other poets and writers made visits to the Lake District or were bound by ties of friendship with those already mentioned above. These include Percy Bysshe Shelley, Sir Walter Scott, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Arthur Hugh Clough, Henry Crabb Robinson, &quot;Conversation&quot; Sharp, Thomas Carlyle, John Keats, Lord Tennyson, Matthew Arnold, Felicia Hemans and Gerald Massey.

Although it is unlikely she ever went there, Letitia Elizabeth Landon produced no fewer than sixteen poems on subjects within the Lake District and its surroundings, all associated with engravings within Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Books, from 1832 to 1838. Also included there (1834) is &quot;Grasmere Lake (A Sketch by a Cockney)&quot;, a skit on becoming a &#x27;lakes poet&#x27;.
During the early 20th century, the children&#x27;s author Beatrix Potter lived at Hill Top Farm; she set many of her famous Peter Rabbit books in the Lake District. Her life was made into a biopic film, starring Renée Zellweger and Ewan McGregor. Children&#x27;s author Arthur Ransome lived in several areas of the Lake District, and set five of his Swallows and Amazons series of books, published between 1930 and 1947, in a fictionalised Lake District setting. So did Geoffrey Trease with his five Black Banner school stories (1949–56), starting with &quot;No Boats on Bannermere&quot;.

The novelist Sir Hugh Walpole lived at &quot;Brackenburn&quot; on the lower slopes of Catbells overlooking Derwent Water from 1924 until he died in 1941. Whilst living at &quot;Brackenburn&quot; he wrote &quot;The Herries Chronicle&quot; detailing the history of a fictional Cumbrian family over two centuries. The noted author and poet Norman Nicholson came from the southwest lakes, living and writing about Millom in the 20th century – he was known as the last of the Lake Poets and came close to becoming the Poet Laureate.

Writer and author Melvyn Bragg was brought up in the region and has used it as the setting for some of his work, such as his novel &quot;A Time to Dance&quot;, which later turned into a television drama.

The Lake District is the setting for the 1977 Richard Adams&#x27; novel &quot;The Plague Dogs&quot;. Adams&#x27; knowledge of the area offers the reader a precise view of the natural beauty of the Lake District. The story is based on a fictionalised version of the remote hill farm of Lawson Park, overlooking Coniston Water.

The Lake District has been the setting for crime novels by Reginald Hill, Val McDermid and Martin Edwards. The region is also a recurring theme in Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s 1926 novella &quot;The Torrents of Spring&quot; and features prominently in Ian McEwan&#x27;s &quot;Amsterdam&quot;, which won the 1998 Booker Prize. The 1996 Eisner Award winning graphic novel &quot;The Tale of One Bad Rat&quot;, by Bryan Talbot, features a young girl&#x27;s journey to and subsequent stay in the Lake District. Also set in the District is Sophie Jackson&#x27;s mystery novel &quot;The Woman Died Thrice&quot;. It was published in 2016 under Jackson&#x27;s pen name Evelyn James.

Memoirist and nature writer James Rebanks has published several books about the Lake District, including two acclaimed books that detail his life as a sheep farmer: &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Life: A Tale of the Lake District&quot; (2015) and &quot;English Pastoral: An Inheritance&quot; (2020).

=== Visual arts ===

The Lakes have been an inspiration for many notable artists. Two of the most famous artists to depict the region in their work were Alfred Heaton Cooper and William Heaton Cooper.

The German artist Kurt Schwitters visited the Lake District while in exile in Great Britain and moved there permanently in June 1945, remaining there for the rest of his life.

Film director Ken Russell lived in the Keswick/Borrowdale area from 1975 to 2007 and used it in films such as &quot;Tommy&quot; and &quot;Mahler&quot;.

The Keswick School of Industrial Art at Keswick was started in 1884 by Canon Rawnsley, a friend of John Ruskin.

The base of contemporary art commissioner and residency base Grizedale Arts since 2007, Lawson Park now hosts artists&#x27; residencies, opens to the public on occasion, and has developed a significant garden that includes artworks alongside extensive plantings. Grizedale Arts has produced many internationally significant cultural projects and has proved instrumental in the careers of several Turner Prize-winning artists, making Laure Provoust&#x27;s winning installation &#x27;Wantee&#x27; at Lawson Park, and bringing the exhibition to Coniston&#x27;s Ruskin Museum in 2013. It also supported the refurbishment of the historic Coniston Institute and developed an Honest Shop there (opening in 2012), an unstaffed shop stocking local crafts and produce.

=== Musicians ===
The English composer Sir Arthur Somervell (1863 – 1937) was born in Windermere.

The 17th track on American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Folklore&quot;, released in 2020 as a bonus track, is titled &quot;The Lakes&quot;, and details Swift&#x27;s experience living in the Lake District. Swift makes reference to the Lake poet William Wordsworth by name.

== Nomenclature ==
Several words and phrases are local to the Lake District and are part of the Cumbrian dialect, though many are shared by other northern dialects. These include:

*Fell – from Old Norse , brought to England by Viking invaders and close to modern Norwegian and Swedish meaning mountain
*Howe – place name from the Old Norse &quot;haugr&quot; meaning hill, knoll, or mound
*Tarn – a word that has been taken to mean a small lake situated in a corrie (the local name for which is &quot;cove&quot; or &quot;comb&quot;), a local phrase for any small pool of water. The word is derived from the Old Norse, Norwegian and Swedish word &quot;tjern/tjärn&quot;, meaning small lake.
*Yan tan tethera – the name for a system of sheep counting which was traditionally used in the Lake District. Though now rare, it is still used by some and taught in local schools.
*Heaf (a variant of ) – the &quot;home territory&quot; of a flock of sheep

<doc id="143758" wikidata="Q2176897" url="?curid=143758" title="Harold Hill">
<text>Harold Hill is a suburban area in the London Borough of Havering, East London. northeast of Charing Cross. It is a district centre in the London Plan. The name refers to King Harold II, who held the manor of Havering-atte-Bower, and who was killed at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. The suburb is peripheral to London, forming an eastern edge of the urban sprawl.

The extensive London County Council housing development of Harold Hill was conceived in the Greater London Plan of 1944 in order to alleviate housing shortages in Inner London. Before construction of the estate, which was completed in 1958, it was the location of Dagnam Park house and grounds, and in the Municipal Borough of Romford and the county of Essex, but was transferred to Greater London in 1965. The first Greater London Council tenant to buy their council house did so here in 1967. The area is part of a long-term regeneration project led by Havering London Borough Council.

==History==
===Local government===
The area that became Harold Hill formed part of the Harold Wood and Noak Hill wards of the parish of Hornchurch; the large ancient parish occupied the same area as the royal manor and liberty of Havering. The boundary between Harold Wood and Noak Hill was formed by a tributary of the River Ingrebourne. In the Harold Hill area the manor was subdivided into Dagnams, Cockerells and Gooshays. The Havering courts and Romford vestry were the principal local government in the area. The Havering liberty was abolished in 1892 and the vestry in 1894. Following the Local Government Act 1894 the area was split between the parishes of Romford Rural (in the west) and Noak Hill (in the east), each with a parish council and within the Romford Rural District. In 1900 the Romford Rural parish was abolished and the area was then split between the Romford Urban District (in the west) and Noak Hill in Romford Rural District (in the east). In 1934 Romford Urban District absorbed Noak Hill, bringing the whole area under the authority of Romford Urban District Council. Romford was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1937 governed by Romford Borough Council, which was the local authority during the construction of the estate. The Municipal Borough of Romford was abolished in 1965 and Harold Hill became part of the London Borough of Havering in Greater London.

===Urban development===
Harold Hill was a planned community, conceived as part of the Greater London Plan in 1944 as a satellite town on the edge of the built up area.

Land for the estate, which consisted of the remaining of Dagnams, was purchased in 1947 by the London County Council. The rest of Dagnams had been sold off in 1919, with the land used for the estate consisting of parkland, woodland, and farmland. The area was within the designated Metropolitan Green Belt, but an exception was made for the development because of the exceptional housing need in London following the Second World War.

Reflecting the urgency of the problem, housing was initially prefabricated. Construction of 7,631 permanent homes, housing 25,000 people, began in 1948 and was complete by 1958. The development is fairly low density with large sections of parkland retained in the centre and edges of the estate. The estate was constructed primarily in brick, with mostly terraces of houses and some flats. Provision was made for community facilities and three shopping areas were planned to break up the size of the development. Some industrial development already existed to the south and adjacent to the A12 road and this was retained.

==Governance==

Harold Hill is located within the Heaton and Gooshays electoral wards, with Heaton covering the west and Gooshays the east. Each ward elects three councillors to Havering London Borough Council. All of Harold Hill is within the Hornchurch and Upminster UK Parliament constituency and the Havering and Redbridge London Assembly constituency.

==Geography==
Harold Hill is situated on the north-eastern edge of London&#x27;s urban sprawl, almost from Charing Cross. The district has clear geographic boundaries formed in the south by the A12 road, in the east by the M25 motorway and in the north where the built up area ends at Noak Hill Road. Large sections of parklands and woodlands are in the middle and on the edges of the estate, including Central Park and Dagnam Park. The land is gently undulating, the most significant feature being a tributary of the River Ingrebourne called Carter&#x27;s Brook and Paine&#x27;s Brook, which runs north to south through the middle of Harold Hill. To the south is Gidea Park, to the north is Noak Hill, to the west is Collier Row and to the east is Great Warley. Harold Hill is part of the Romford post town in the RM3 postcode district, which also includes Harold Wood and Noak Hill. Climate data for Harold Hill is taken from the nearest weather station at Greenwich.


==Transport==
The nearest railway station is at Harold Wood, approximately south of the centre of the estate, and is one of the stations on the Elizabeth line. The nearest London Underground station is at Upminster, approximately to the south. Transport for London provides bus routes 174, 256, 294, 346, 496, 499 and N86.

==Education==

;History
By the early 1960s, Harold Hill had six secondary schools:
* Broxhill Secondary Modern (Mixed), near the corner of Broxhill Road and Noak Hill Road. Amongst its notable former pupils is Dr David Scurry, Dean of Undergraduate Programmes, Oxford Brookes University, 1989–2008.
* Harold Hill Grammar School (Mixed), in Appleby Drive
* Harrowfield Secondary Modern School (Boys), in Settle Road
* Harrowfield Secondary Modern School (Girls), in Settle Road – adjacent, but run separately
* Quarles Secondary Modern School (Boys), in Tring Gardens
* Quarles Secondary Modern School (Girls), in Tring Gardens – adjacent, but run separately

These schools had been built to cope with the post-Second World War &quot;baby-boom&quot;, but because of government education policy, Broxhill and Harold Hill Grammar merged to form Bedfords Park Comprehensive. Then because of demographic changes, Quarles Boys&#x27; and Girls&#x27; Schools later merged with Harrowfield to form the Neave School (later King&#x27;s Wood). 
;Present
After further name changes and closures, Harold Hill now has just one secondary school, Drapers&#x27; Academy, on the site of the former Harrowfield/Neave/King&#x27;s Wood schools.
Havering College, a mixed college of further education, is situated on the site of the former Quarles Secondary Modern Schools, in Tring Gardens.

==Culture and community==
Every year in Harold Hill there is a community festival held in Central Park normally in early July called the Harold Hill Festival.

Ian Dury referenced Harold Hill in self-penned song, &quot;This Is What We Find&quot;: The song set all three of its verses in real places; the others were Turnham Green and Lambeth Walk. In his double CD, &quot;Retrospective Reasons To be Cheerful&quot; produced by Repertoire Records, Dury stated that he never wrote another verse as good as Harold Hill&#x27;s verse.

The area has been covered in relation to various murders and attempted murders. Despite its past, Harold Hill is now one of the fastest improving boroughs since the council built the Myplace centre, a new community and performance space, allowing young people a safe location to spend time with their friends. The Prime Minister said that since Draper&#x27;s Academy opened in Settle Road, it has become one of the fastest improving schools in England helping Harold Hill improve in the future. It has had so much success in the past year that the Queen visited Drapers Academy in October 2012, that being her first visit to Harold Hill.

Bedrock is the local hospital radio service available online to the local area and broadcasting a range of health-related information and locally produced entertainment. Radio Harold Hill which started in 2013 is the local community radio station and broadcasts online on their website and on mobile apps.

==Sport==
The area has its own non league football club, Harold Hill F.C. who currently play in the at the Henderson Sports &amp; social club, Kenilworth Avenue.

<doc id="143759" wikidata="Q23086" url="?curid=143759" title="North Yorkshire">
<text>North Yorkshire is a ceremonial county in the Yorkshire and the Humber and North East regions of England. It borders County Durham to the north, the North Sea to the east, the East Riding of Yorkshire to the south-east, South Yorkshire to the south, West Yorkshire to the south-west, and Cumbria and Lancashire to the west.

The county is the largest in England by land area, at , and had a population of 1,158,816 in 2021. The largest settlements are Middlesbrough (148,215) in the north-east and the city of York (141,685) in the south. Middlesbrough is part of the Teesside built-up area, which extends into County Durham and had a total population of 376,663 in 2011. The remainder of the county is rural, and the largest towns are Harrogate (75,515) in the south and Scarborough (59,505) in the east. For local government purposes the county comprises four unitary authority areas—North Yorkshire, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland, and York—and part of a fifth, Stockton-on-Tees. The local authorities of York and North Yorkshire form a combined authority of the same name, and the local authorities of the other three areas are part of the Tees Valley Combined Authority. The county was historically part of Yorkshire.

The centre of the county contains a wide plain, called the Vale of Mowbray in the north and Vale of York in the south. The North York Moors uplands lie to the east, and south of them the Vale of Pickering is separated from the main plain by the Howardian Hills. Further east, the county has a coastline on the North Sea. The west of the county contains the Yorkshire Dales, an extensive upland area which contains the source of the River Ouse/Ure and many of its tributaries, which together drain most of the county before reaching the Humber estuary in the south. The Dales also contain the county&#x27;s highest point, Whernside, at .

==History==

North Yorkshire non-metropolitan and ceremonial county was formed on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972. It covered most of the North Riding of Yorkshire, as well as northern parts of the West Riding of Yorkshire, northern and eastern East Riding of Yorkshire and the former county borough of York. Northallerton, as the former county town for the North Riding, became North Yorkshire&#x27;s county town. In 1993 the county was placed wholly within the Yorkshire and the Humber region. From 1974 to 1996 the area of the non-metropolitan county was the same as the area of the ceremonial county. The county was divided into eight districts (York, Craven, Hambleton, Harrogate, Richmondshire, Ryedale, Scarborough and Selby).

Some areas which were part of the former North Riding were in the county of Cleveland for twenty-two years (from 1974 to 1996) and were placed in the North East region from 1993. When Cleveland was abolished on 1 April 1996, these areas (Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland and Stockton borough south of the River Tees) became part of the ceremonial county as separate unitary authorities. These areas remain within the North East England region.

Also on 1 April 1996, the City of York district and parts of the three adjoining districts (Haxby and nearby rural areas) became the City of York unitary authority.

On 1 April 2023, the non-metropolitan county became a unitary authority. This abolished the remaining seven district councils and extended the powers of the county council to act as a district council.

The York and North Yorkshire Combined Authority held its first meeting on 22 January 2024, assumed its powers on 1 February 2024 and the first mayor was elected in May 2024.

==Geography==

The geology of North Yorkshire is closely reflected in its landscape. Within the county are the North York Moors and most of the Yorkshire Dales, two of eleven areas in England and Wales to be designated national parks. Between the North York Moors in the east and the Pennine Hills. The highest point is Whernside, on the Cumbrian border, at . A distinctive hill to the far north east of the county is Roseberry Topping.

North Yorkshire contains several major rivers. The River Tees is the most northerly, forming part of the border between North Yorkshire and County Durham in its lower reaches and flowing east through Teesdale before reaching the North Sea near Redcar. The Yorkshire Dales are the source of many of the county&#x27;s major rivers, including the Aire, Lune, Ribble, Swale, Ure, and Wharfe. The Aire, Swale, and Wharfe are tributaries of the Ure/Ouse, which at long is the sixth-longest river in the United Kingdom. The river is called the Ure until it meets Ouse Gill beck just below the village of Great Ouseburn, where it becomes the Ouse and flows south before exiting the county near Goole and entering the Humber estuary. The North York Moors are the catchment for a number of rivers: the Leven which flows north into the Tees between Yarm and Ingleby Barwick; the Esk flows east directly into the North Sea at Whitby as well as the Rye (which later becomes the Derwent at Malton) flows south into the River Ouse at Goole.

The county is less than 10 miles from Morecambe Bay at its closest point.

===Urban to rural Green belt===

North Yorkshire contains a small section of green belt in the south of the county, which surrounds the neighbouring metropolitan area of Leeds along the North and West Yorkshire borders. It extends to the east to cover small communities such as Huby, Kirkby Overblow, and Follifoot before covering the gap between the towns of Harrogate and Knaresborough, helping to keep those towns separate.

The belt adjoins the southernmost part of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, and the Nidderdale AONB. It extends into the western area of Selby district, reaching as far as Tadcaster and Balne. The belt was first drawn up from the 1950s.

The city of York has an independent surrounding belt area affording protections to several outlying settlements such as Haxby and Dunnington, and it too extends into the surrounding districts.

===Climate===
North Yorkshire has a temperate oceanic climate, like most of the UK. There are large climate variations within the county. The upper Pennines border on a Subarctic climate. Overall, with the county being situated in the east, it receives below-average rainfall for the UK. Inside North Yorkshire, the upper Dales of the Pennines are one of the wettest parts of England, where in contrast the driest parts of the Vale of Mowbray are some of the driest areas in the UK.

Summer temperatures are above average, at 22 °C. Highs can regularly reach up to 28 °C, with over 30 °C reached in heat waves. Winter temperatures are below average, with average lows of 1 °C. Snow and Fog can be expected depending on location. The North York Moors and Pennines have snow lying for an average of between 45 and 75 days per year. Sunshine is most plentiful on the coast, receiving an average of 1,650 hours a year. It reduces further west in the county, with the Pennines receiving 1,250 hours a year.

==Governance==
===Local authorities===
====Borders====
The county borders multiple counties and districts:
*County Durham&#x27;s County Durham, Darlington, Stockton (north Tees) and Hartlepool;
*East Riding of Yorkshire&#x27;s East Riding of Yorkshire;
*South Yorkshire&#x27;s City of Doncaster;
*West Yorkshire&#x27;s City of Wakefield, City of Leeds and City of Bradford;
*Lancashire&#x27;s City of Lancaster, Ribble Valley and Pendle

===Combined authorities===
The City of York Council and North Yorkshire Council formed the York and North Yorkshire Combined Authority in February 2024. The elections for the first directly elected mayor will take place in May 2024. Both North Yorkshire Council and the combined authority are governed from County Hall, Northallerton.
The Tees Valley Combined Authority was formed in 2016 by five unitary authorities; Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland Borough both of North Yorkshire, Stockton-on-Tees Borough (Uniquely for England, split between North Yorkshire and County Durham), Hartlepool Borough and Darlington Borough of County Durham.

==Economy==
In large areas of North Yorkshire, agriculture is the primary source of employment. Approximately 85% of the county is considered to be &quot;rural or super sparse&quot;.

Other sectors in 2019 included some manufacturing, the provision of accommodation and meals (primarily for tourists) which accounted for 19 per cent of all jobs. Food manufacturing employed 11 per cent of workers. A few people are involved in forestry and fishing in 2019. The average weekly earnings in 2018 were £531. Some 15% of workers declared themselves as self-employed. One report in late 2020 stated that &quot;North Yorkshire has a relatively healthy and diverse economy which largely mirrors the national picture in terms of productivity and jobs.

Mineral extraction and power generation are also sectors of the economy, as is high technology.

Tourism is a significant contributor to the economy. A study of visitors between 2013 and 2015 indicated that the Borough of Scarborough, including Filey, Whitby and parts of the North York Moors National Park, received 1.4m trips per year on average. A 2016 report by the National Park, states the park area gets 7.93 million visitors annually, generating £647 million and supporting 10,900 full-time equivalent jobs.

The Yorkshire Dales have also attracted many visitors. In 2016, there were 3.8 million visits to the National Park including 0.48 million who stayed at least one night. The parks service estimates that this contributed 
£252 million to the economy and provided 3,583 full-time equivalent jobs. The wider Yorkshire Dales area received 9.7 million visitors who contributed £644 million to the economy. The North York Moors and Yorkshire Dales are among England&#x27;s best known destinations.

York is a popular tourist destination. A 2014 report, based on 2012 data, stated that York alone receives 6.9 million visitors annually; they contribute £564 million to the economy and support over 19,000 jobs. In the 2017 Condé Nast Traveller survey of readers, York rated 12th among The 15 Best Cities in the UK for visitors. In a 2020 Condé Nast Traveller report, York rated as the sixth best among ten &quot;urban destinations [in the UK] that scored the highest marks when it comes to ... nightlife, restaurants and friendliness&quot;.

During February 2020 to January 2021, the average property in North Yorkshire county sold for £240,000, up by £8100 over the previous 12 months. By comparison, the average for England and Wales was £314,000. In certain communities of North Yorkshire, however, house prices were higher than average for the county, as of early 2021: Harrogate (average value: £376,195), Knaresborough (£375,625), Tadcaster (£314,278), Leyburn (£309,165) and Ripon (£299,998), for example.

This is a chart of trend of regional gross value added for North Yorkshire at current basic prices with figures in millions of British pounds sterling.

===Effects of the pandemic===

Unemployment in the county was traditionally low in recent years, but the lockdowns and travel restrictions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative effect on the economy during much of 2020 and into 2021. The UK government said in early February 2021 that it was planning &quot;unprecedented levels of support to help businesses [in the UK] survive the crisis&quot;. A report published on 1 March 2021 stated that the unemployment rate in North Yorkshire had &quot;risen to the highest level in nearly 5 years – with under 25s often bearing the worst of job losses&quot;.

York experienced high unemployment during lockdown periods. One analysis (by the York and North Yorkshire Local Enterprise Partnership) predicted in August 2020 that &quot;as many as 13,835 jobs in York will be lost in the scenario considered most likely, taking the city&#x27;s unemployment rate to 14.5%&quot;. Some critics claimed that part of the problem was caused by &quot;over-reliance on the booming tourism industry at the expense of a long-term economic plan&quot;. A report in mid June 2020 stated that unemployment had risen 114 per cent over the previous year because of restrictions imposed as a result of the pandemic.

Tourism in the county was expected to increase after the restrictions imposed due the pandemic are relaxed. One reason for the expected increase is the airing of &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;, a TV series about the vet James Herriot, based on a successful series of books; it was largely filmed within the Yorkshire Dales National Park. The show aired in the UK in September 2020 and in the US in early 2021. One source stated that visits to Yorkshire websites had increased significantly by late September 2020.

The lockdowns affected traffic volumes across the regions roads, which was also mirrored in road accidents, which totalled 948 in 2020, a drop of 7% on the previous year which had 1,021 accidents. Additionally, miles travelled by all types of vehicle dropped, with cars having the largest drop, LCV and HGV less so, but pedal bicycle usage slightly increased.

Post-pandemic health effects included children worrying more about life and whether a family member would die. A public health report detailed how 76% of children worried daily in 2014, and by 2018, this had dropped to 61%. By 2024, this had risen again to 86%.

== Transport ==
===Bridges===
North Yorkshire has a number of bridge with clusters such as bridges of York or in the Tees Lowlands, over the River Tees. Many are road bridges, railway viaducts or footbridges; such Lendal Bridge in York, Saltburn Viaduct and the Infinity Bridge respectively.

The Tees Transporter Bridge, opened in 1911 is a symbol of Teesside and is one of few surviving transporter bridges worldwide. Further inland, the Tees Barrage complex (which opened in 1995) incorporates a tidal barrier, road bridge, footbridge and barge lock.

Larpool Viaduct near Whitby is a repurposed railway viaduct (footbridge), the viaduct was affected by the Beeching cuts in 1965 with the rail-line connecting to axed. It was opened in 1885, closed in 1965 then repurposed and re-opened in 2000.

Heritage railways within North Yorkshire include: the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, between and , which opened in 1973; the Derwent Valley Light Railway near York; and the Embsay and Bolton Abbey Steam Railway. The Wensleydale Railway, which started operating in 2003, runs services between and along a former freight-only line. The medium-term aim is to operate into Northallerton station on the ECML, once an agreement can be reached with Network Rail. In the longer term, the aim is to reinstate the full line west via to on the Settle-Carlisle line.

<text>Ira Marvin Levin (August 27, 1929 – November 12, 2007) was an American novelist, playwright, and songwriter. His works include the novels &quot;A Kiss Before Dying&quot; (1953), &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1967), &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot; (1972), &quot;This Perfect Day&quot; (1970), &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot; (1976), and &quot;Sliver&quot; (1991). Levin also wrote the play &quot;Deathtrap&quot; (1978). Many of his novels and plays have been adapted into films. He received the Prometheus Hall of Fame Award and several Edgar Awards.

==Early life==
Levin was born on August 27, 1929, in Manhattan, New York City. He grew up in both Manhattan and the Bronx. His father, Charles, was a toy importer. Levin was educated at the private Horace Mann School in New York. During his youth, he was described as &quot;a nice Jewish boy from New York&quot;. He attended Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa from 1946 to 1948 and then New York University, where he majored in philosophy and English. He graduated in 1950. He served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps, during the Korean War, from 1953 to 1955.

==Professional life==

===Scriptwriting===
After college, Levin wrote training films and scripts for radio and television. The first of these was &quot;Leda&#x27;s Portrait&quot;, for &quot;Lights Out&quot; in 1951.

Levin&#x27;s first produced play was &quot;No Time for Sergeants&quot; (adapted from the 1954 Mac Hyman novel), a comedy about a hillbilly drafted into the United States Air Force. It opened on Broadway in 1955 and starred Andy Griffith, whose career it jumpstarted. The play was adapted as a movie of the same name, released in 1958, with Griffith reprising his role and co-starring Nick Adams. Later the concept was developed as a 1964 television comedy series starring Sammy Jackson. &quot;No Time for Sergeants&quot; is generally considered the precursor to &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot;.

Levin&#x27;s best-known play is &quot;Deathtrap&quot; (1978), which holds the record as the longest-running comedy thriller on Broadway. Levin won his second Edgar Award with this play. In 1982, it was adapted into a film of the same name, starring Christopher Reeve and Michael Caine.

Levin&#x27;s first novel, &quot;A Kiss Before Dying&quot; (1953), was well received, and he won the 1954 Edgar Award for Best First Novel. &quot;A Kiss Before Dying&quot; was adapted twice as movies of the same name, first in 1956 and again in 1991.

Levin&#x27;s best-known novel is &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby,&quot; a horror story of modern-day Satanism and other occultisms, set in Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side. In 1968, it was adapted as a film written and directed by Roman Polanski. It starred Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes. Ruth Gordon won an Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her performance. Roman Polanski was nominated for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.

Levin said in 2002, 
&quot;I feel guilty that &#x27;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&#x27; led to &quot;The Exorcist,&quot; &quot;The Omen.&quot; A whole generation has been exposed, has more belief in Satan. I don&#x27;t believe in Satan. And I feel that the strong fundamentalism we have would not be as strong if there hadn&#x27;t been so many of these books [...] Of course, I didn&#x27;t send back any of the royalty checks.&quot;

Other Levin novels that were adapted as films included the satirical &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot; in 1975, again in 2004. &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot; was adapted as a film released in 1978.

In the 1990s, Levin wrote two more bestselling novels: &quot;Sliver&quot; (1991) and &quot;Son of Rosemary&quot; (1997). &quot;Sliver&quot; was adapted as a film in 1993 by Phillip Noyce. It starred Sharon Stone, William Baldwin and Tom Berenger. &quot;Son of Rosemary&quot; (1997) was proposed as a film sequel to &quot;Rosemary’s Baby&quot;. It was never developed into a film.

Stephen King has described Ira Levin as the &quot;Swiss watchmaker&quot; of suspense novels: &quot;Every novel he has ever written has been a marvel of plotting (...) he makes what the rest of us do look like those five-dollar watches you can buy in the discount drug stores.&quot;

==Personal life==
Levin was a Jewish atheist.

Levin was married twice, first to Gabrielle Aronsohn (from 1960 to 1968), with whom he had three sons, Adam, Jared, and Nicholas, and later to Phyllis Sugarman (died 2006). He had four grandchildren.

==Death==
Levin died of a heart attack at his home in Manhattan on November 12, 2007.

<text>Collier Row is a neighbourhood to the north of Romford in East London, England, within the London Borough of Havering. It is a suburban development located northeast of Charing Cross.

==History==
Its name originates from charcoal burners which used to occupy the area.

The area is based on a large housing estate built during the 1930s as part of the inter-war London housing expansion, with shopping facilities around a central crossroads.

Remains of a Roman settlement have been uncovered in the area.

==Transport==
The area is not connected to the London Underground or National Rail networks; however, Hainault and Newbury Park Underground stations (Central line) and Romford railway station are nearby. Transport for London bus routes 103, 175, 247, 252, 294, 365 (24 hour) and 375 and commercial route 575 from Epping to Romford and Lakeside serve the local area, and it is planned that a future extension of the East London Transit could serve the area.

The A12 (Eastern Avenue), which runs through Collier Row at its southern end, leads to London and the east coast of Essex, and crosses the M25 on its eastern section.

==Geography==
Collier Row is located north of Romford within the London Borough of Havering and northeast of Charing Cross in Central London. It includes a town centre with housing extending to the north.

===Nearest places===
*Hainault
*Marks Gate
*Rise Park
*Havering-atte-Bower
*Romford
*Chigwell Row

==Education==

Situated on Havering Road, Parklands School (both primary and junior) opened in 1929–1931. In 1995 the school was given &quot;Beacon Status&quot; due to the high standards of education provided. It is one of the largest primary schools in the area.

<text>Aarhus County or Århus County () is a former county of Denmark (Danish: &quot;amt&quot;) on the Jutland peninsula. It was created in 1970 by a merger of three counties: Århus, Randers and Skanderborg. The county was abolished effective 1 January 2007, when almost all of it merged into Region Midtjylland (i.e. &quot;Region Central Jutland&quot;). A very small portion was merged into Region Nordjylland (&quot;Region North Jutland&quot;). At the time of its abolishment, more than 20,000 people worked for the county.

<text>Ebeltoft is an old port town on the central east coast of Denmark with a population of 7,211 (1 January 2024). It is located in Syddjurs municipality in Region Midtjylland on the larger Djursland peninsula of Jutland.

Ebeltoft is known for its old town center with cobble-stoned streets and centuries-old half-timbered houses. Plans for the conservation of this peculiar environment, was initiated in the 1960s by the city council and the National Museum of Denmark. Apart from this overall old-village charm, Ebeltoft holds several other notable institutions such as Glasmuseet Ebeltoft, one of the world&#x27;s first glass museums, Fregatten Jylland, the longest wooden warship in the world and the European Film College, offering short and long courses in film making, especially for young people.

== Tourism ==
Ebeltoft and the surrounding countryside is one of the tourist centres of Denmark, with many summer houses and rentals, a marina, a golf course and many child-friendly beaches. In spite of its relatively small size, Ebeltoft is quite lively, especially in the summer season. The population soars in June, July, and August - but all year round, there are many more people staying here than the official number of inhabitants suggests. This is due to the Danish phenomenon of &#x27;summer houses&#x27; (holiday homes): most are made of wood but often quite luxurious, and there are several thousand in this area. The tourism, the old traditions of trade in this harbour town, and the international schools in the area probably explain why most people in this small town are open-minded and friendly towards foreigners. The town is, generally speaking, also well-to-do. Quite a few people work in the city of Aarhus, which is only 50 km away by road and so within commuting distance. The Aarhus Airport is just 15 km by road to the north.

Ebeltoft itself offers fewer and fewer opportunities for employment. Several large companies that used to employ unskilled labour are now closed; traditional trades, such as fishing and farming are diminishing rapidly; and the ferry line, Mols-linien, has moved quite a few of its employees to the ferry port of Aarhus. However, the town is popular with artisans, such as glass workers, potters, painters, and jewellery designers. The Glasmuseet Ebeltoft, which shows contemporary glass art from all over the world, was established in 1985 by Ebeltoft glass artists Finn Lynggaard and his wife, Tchai Munch. The many general stores and supermarkets - as well as hotels, restaurants, and bars - offer opportunities to make a living.

== Surroundings ==
Around Ebeltoft lie few small towns such as Fuglsø and Knebel on the Mols Peninsula. Just south of the town is the holiday resort of Øer. In 2009 the large Mols Bjerge National Park was inaugurated and it includes the town of Ebeltoft.

<text>Hawke&#x27;s Bay () is a region on the east coast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. The region is named for Hawke Bay, which was named in honour of Edward Hawke. The region&#x27;s main centres are the cities of Napier and Hastings, while the more rural parts of the region are served by the towns of Waipukurau, Waipawa, and Wairoa.

== Name ==

Hawke&#x27;s Bay is named for the bay to its east, Hawke Bay, which was named in honour of Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke by Captain James Cook during one of his voyages along the coasts of New Zealand.

The Māori language name for Hawke&#x27;s Bay is &quot;Te Matau-a-Māui&quot; ( the fishhook belonging to Māui). This name comes from a traditional story in which Maui lifted the islands of New Zealand from the waters. The story says that Hawke&#x27;s Bay is the fishhook that Māui used, with Portland Island and Cape Kidnappers being the northern and southern barbs of the hook, respectively.

Hawke&#x27;s Bay is one of only two places in New Zealand with a possessive apostrophe in its name, the other being Arthur&#x27;s Pass. Captain Cook originally used an apostrophe in the name for the bay, but was inconsistent and wrote the name without an apostrophe a day later. Many New Zealanders spell the name without an apostrophe.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Bay whaling stations operated on the shores of the bay in the nineteenth century.

Hawke&#x27;s Bay Province was founded in 1858 as a province of New Zealand, after being separated from the Wellington Province following a meeting in Napier in February 1858. The Province was abolished in 1876 along with all other provinces in New Zealand. It was replaced with a Provincial District.

=== 1931 earthquake ===

On February 3, 1931, Napier and Hastings were devastated by New Zealand&#x27;s worst natural disaster, an earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter magnitude scale, which killed 256 people. Napier rebuilt and now the city is world-famous for its Art Deco buildings, and celebrates its heritage each February with the Art Deco Weekend. MTG Hawke&#x27;s Bay, formerly Hawke&#x27;s Bay Museum and Art Gallery, has an exhibition on the earthquake, its causes and impact.

=== Second World War ===
During the Second World War, the German submarine &quot;U-862&quot; entered the waters around Napier undetected, surfacing by the Sound Shell. The submarine fired a torpedo at the &quot;Pukeko&quot;, a steamer leaving the Port of Napier, but narrowly missed.

=== Cyclone Gabrielle ===

On the 13th and 14 February 2023, Cyclone Gabrielle caused extensive damage in Hawke&#x27;s Bay as it passed over the North Island. Power, phone service and internet access was cut to over 16,000 properties when the main Redcliffe substation was damaged in floodwaters after the Tutaekuri River burst its banks. Downstream, 1,000 people were evacuated from low-lying plains surrounding the river, where significant parts of Taradale, Meeanee and Awatoto were submerged.

The floodwaters destroyed 4 bridges, including Redcliffe Bridge, a major crossing just south of Taradale. SH2 and SH51 bridges were heavily damaged, but did not collapse. A span of the Palmerston North-Gisborne Line crossing the Tutaekuri River also collapsed. The Ngaruroro River also breached its banks, flooding the town of Omahu where 20 people required evacuation via helicopter.

In Wairoa, the Wairoa River breached its banks, flooding approximately 15 percent of the town. Access to Wairoa was cut off after extensive damage on SH2&#x27;s Mohaka River Bridge in the south, and landslides also closing SH2 to the north. Water supply in Central Hawke&#x27;s Bay failed, and a mandatory evacuation was ordered for eastern Waipawa after the Waipara river rose to record levels. The total cost and damages are unknown at this time.

== Geography ==
The region is situated on the east coast of the North Island. It bears the former name of what is now Hawke Bay, a large semi-circular bay that extends for 100 kilometres from northeast to southwest from Māhia Peninsula to Cape Kidnappers.

The Hawke&#x27;s Bay Region includes the hilly coastal land around the northern and central bay, the floodplains of the Wairoa River in the north, the wide fertile Heretaunga Plains around Hastings in the south, and a hilly interior stretching up into the Kaweka and Ruahine Ranges. The prominent peak Taraponui is located inland.

Five major rivers flow to the Hawke&#x27;s Bay coast. From north to south, they are the Wairoa River, Mohaka River, Tutaekuri River, Ngaruroro River and Tukituki River. Lake Waikaremoana, situated in northern Hawke&#x27;s Bay, roughly 35 km from the coast, is the largest lake in Hawke&#x27;s Bay, the fourth largest in the North Island and the 16th largest in New Zealand.

The region has a hill with the longest place name in New Zealand, and the longest in the world according to the 2009 Guinness Book of Records. Taumata­whakatangihanga­koauau­o­tamatea­turi­pukakapiki­maunga­horo­nuku­pokai­whenua­kitanatahu is an otherwise unremarkable hill in southern Hawke&#x27;s Bay, not far from Waipukurau.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Air travel ===
Hawke&#x27;s Bay is served by Hawke&#x27;s Bay Airport (also known as Napier Airport). 452,000 travellers passed through the terminal in the 12 months to June 2013. This increased to 652,426 in the 12 months to June 2017.

=== Roads ===
Inter-regional travel into and out of Hawke&#x27;s Bay is served by State Highway 2 and State Highway 5, as well as the Taihape-Napier Road also known as &quot;The Gentle Annie&quot;. State Highway 38 also connects inter-regionally, although it is less used due to being partially unsealed.

State Highway 2 enters the region coming south from Gisborne, connecting the East Cape region to Hawke&#x27;s Bay. It continues through Nūhaka and then Wairoa, crossing over the Mohaka River near the Mohaka Viaduct. It then winds through the hills of northern Hawke&#x27;s Bay, passing by Lake Tūtira. It meets the ocean and then passes through Whirinaki where it intersects with the end of State Highway 5. After cutting by Bay View, it passes by Hawke&#x27;s Bay Airport as it enters Napier next to Pandora Pond. As it goes through Napier it is concurrent with State Highway 50 passing by Taradale. The Hawke&#x27;s Bay Expressway forms the next section of the road as it crosses over the Tutaekuri and Ngaruroro rivers. The road then bisects Hastings and Flaxmere. The road continues through the Heretaunga Plains into Central Hawke&#x27;s Bay, connecting the towns of Ōtāne, Waipawa, and Waipukurau. It then heads towards Takapau where it meets the other end of State Highway 50. After Takapau it heads into the Tararua District and through the towns of Norsewood and Dannevirke. State Highway 2 is the main route heading south from Napier-Hastings to get to major centres such as Palmerston North and Wellington.

State Highway 5 enters Hawke&#x27;s Bay from the north-west as the Napier-Taupo Road. It serves as the main connection between Hawke&#x27;s Bay and the main centres up north – including Auckland, Hamilton, Tauranga, Rotorua, and Taupō. It travels through the hilly interior of the region. It meets up with State Highway 2 after passing through Eskdale.

The Taihape-Napier Road serves as an inland route between Hawke&#x27;s Bay and the Rangitikei and Ruapehu districts, creating a connection to the towns of Taihape, Waiouru, and Ohakune.

State Highway 50 starts in Ahuriri in Napier and after being concurrent with State Highway 2, splits off and connects the more interior sections of the region – including the settlements of Fernhill, Maraekakaho, Tikokino, Ongaonga, and Ashley Clinton. The road terminates at an intersection with State Highway 2 near Takapau.

== Government ==

=== Regional ===

The region is governed by Hawke&#x27;s Bay Regional Council, which has its main office and council chamber in Napier. The council consists of eleven elected members and holds elections every three years. As of 26 October 2022 the councillors are:

==== Proposal for a unitary authority ====
Between 2013 and 2015 the Local Government Commission considered amalgamating Hawke&#x27;s Bay Regional Council, its four constituent territorial authorities (Napier City Council, Central Hawke&#x27;s Bay District Council, Hastings District Council and Wairoa District Council), and the small parts of the Rangitikei District Council (the rural community of Ngamahanga) and Taupo District Council (the rural community of Taharua) that fall within the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Region into a unitary authority that would hold all local decision-making powers for the region. This proposal was initiated by an application from a group called &quot;A Better Hawke&#x27;s Bay&quot; and followed the Government-led amalgamation of eight local authorities into the new Auckland Council in 2010 and a 2012 &quot;prosperity study&quot; that found a similar amalgamation in Hawke&#x27;s Bay could save up to $25m per year. A previous proposal to merge Napier and Hastings, though supported by Hastings residents, was defeated in a public referendum in 1999.

The Local Government Commission released an initial proposal in November 2013. After taking public submissions on the proposal, the Commission issued a final proposal in June 2015. The final proposal was that Hawke&#x27;s Bay would be governed by a unitary council comprising a governing body (one mayor elected at-large and eighteen councillors elected across five wards) with subsidiary decision-making made by five local boards (each with six to nine elected members).

Under the Local Government Act, the public had the right to demand a binding referendum on whether the amalgamation should proceed; such a demand would be valid if it was signed by at least 10% of the affected electors in one of the affected districts. Two days after the final proposal was issued, a valid referendum demand signed by more than 10% of the affected electors in the Rangitikei district was received (there were only twelve affected electors in that district, therefore only two signatures were required to trigger the poll). The referendum was held by post. Voting concluded on Tuesday 15 September 2015. Because 66% of electors opposed the change, the proposal was defeated and did not progress further. Results broken down to the council level showed that only Hastings district electors favoured amalgamation (52% in favour). Napier (84% opposed), Wairoa District (88% opposed) and Central Hawke&#x27;s Bay (58%) were opposed. Only four votes were returned from Rangitikei (two each way); no votes were returned from Taupo district.

=== Sub-regional ===

Government at the level below regional is organised into territorial authorities, consisting of Hastings District, Wairoa District, Central Hawke&#x27;s Bay District, and Napier City. The localities of Taharua in the Taupo District and Ngamatea in the Rangitikei District are also within the boundaries of the region. It does not include the Tararua District, Dannevirke, Woodville or Norsewood, which have been under the Manawatū-Whanganui Regional Council (also known as Horizons Regional Council) since the 1989 local government reforms.
=== National ===

Hawke&#x27;s Bay is covered by five general electorates — namely Napier, Tukituki, Wairarapa, Rangitīkei, and Taupō. The bulk of the region is contained within the Napier and Tukituki electorates, the former comprising most of the northern part of the region (including Napier and Wairoa), whilst the latter comprises much of the central parts of the region and the area around Hastings, including Havelock North and Clive. Wairarapa, which extends across parts of Greater Wellington and Manawatū-Whanganui, includes much of Central Hawke&#x27;s Bay District, including Waipukurau and Waipawa. The Rangitīkei and Taupō electorates do not contain much of any population within the region.

Napier and Tukituki are often called &#x27;bellwether&#x27; electorates. Since the introduction of Mixed-Member Proportional elections in New Zealand, both electorates have been held by both Labour and National members of parliament, often shifting in a way similar to that of the nation as a whole.

Hawke&#x27;s Bay is also covered by three Māori electorates — namely Ikaroa-Rāwhiti, Waiariki, and Te Tai Hauāuru. The vast majority of the population of the region is within the Ikaroa-Rāwhiti electorate.

=== Parks and nature ===
Hawke&#x27;s Bay is home to numerous parks, forests, beaches and various other natural attractions.

Napier and Hastings are home to many parks, with major parks including Cornwall, Frimley, and Windsor Parks in Hastings, and Anderson Park, Park Island, Taradale Park and the Botanical Gardens in Napier.

Located in Windsor Park is Splash Planet, an amusement and water park that is open in the summer.

Cape Kidnappers, a headland at the south-eastern extremity of Hawke Bay, is a popular tourist attraction. The cape has been identified as an Important Bird Area due to being a breeding site for over 6500 pairs of Australasian gannets.

=== Food ===
The Hawke&#x27;s Bay wine region produces some of New Zealand&#x27;s finest wines, celebrated together with local cuisine twice a year with the &quot;Food And Wine Classic&quot; festivals. These take place over several weekends in winter and ten days in summer, attracting thousands of visitors, many from overseas.

=== Music ===
Napier is home to the Mission Concert held early each year since 1993. The event, held at the Mission Estate Winery in Taradale, has attracted performers such as Kenny Rogers, Elton John, Shirley Bassey, Rod Stewart, The B-52&#x27;s, Belinda Carlisle, Ray Charles, and Eric Clapton. The 2009 concert attraction was to be Lionel Richie, but the concert was cancelled because of rain.

UK music artist Tycho Jones was staying in Hastings, Hawkes Bay when he was inspired to write the track Don&#x27;t Be Afraid, produced by Jonathan Quarmby.

=== Sport ===
The Hawke&#x27;s Bay Rugby Union&#x27;s representative team, the Magpies, plays in New Zealand&#x27;s annual professional domestic rugby union competition, the Mitre 10 Cup. The team represents the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Region in provincial representative rugby, and draws its players from the constituent clubs who are affiliated to the provincial union. The team play their home matches in McLean Park in Napier. Players representing Hawke&#x27;s Bay are also eligible to play for the Hurricanes in the annual transnational Super Rugby competition. Hawke&#x27;s Bay has produced a number of All Blacks.

The Hawke&#x27;s Bay Hawks compete in the New Zealand National Basketball League.

== Seismicity ==

Hawke&#x27;s Bay is one of the most seismically active regions in New Zealand and has experienced many large and often damaging earthquakes. More than 50 damaging earthquakes have been recorded in the region since the 1800s.

<text>Dagenham () is a town in East London, England, within the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham. Dagenham is centred east of Charing Cross.

It was historically a rural parish in the Becontree Hundred of Essex, stretching from Hainault Forest in the north to the River Thames in the south. Dagenham remained mostly undeveloped until 1921, when the London County Council began construction of the large Becontree housing estate. The population significantly increased as people moved to the new housing in the early 20th century, with the parish of Dagenham becoming Dagenham Urban District in 1926 and the Municipal Borough of Dagenham in 1938. In 1965 Dagenham became part of Greater London when most of the historic parish become part of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham.

Dagenham was chosen as a location for industrial activity and is perhaps most famous for being the location of the Ford Dagenham motor car plant where the Ford sewing machinists strike of 1968 took place. Following the decline of industry, the southern part of Dagenham adjacent to the River Thames forms part of the London Riverside section of the Thames Gateway redevelopment area, with a new district of Beam Park under construction on the former site of Ford Dagenham.

==History==
===Toponymy===
Dagenham first appeared in a document (as ) in a charter of Barking Abbey dating from 666 AD (though alternative 7th century dates have been suggested for the charter). The name almost certainly originated with a small farmstead, the &quot;ham&quot; or farm of a man called Daecca, as in Old English means &quot;home of a man called Dæcca&quot;. The charter was made to reflect a transfer of land from Aethelred, kinsman of King Saebbi of Essex, to Barking Abbey.

===Manor of Barking===
Dagenham has been historically defined by its ancient parish boundaries. The parish of Dagenham was formed in the medieval period from part of the huge manor of Barking, which was owned by the Nunnery of Barking Abbey. The Barking manor also included Barking and Great Ilford, which reversed the usual situation where a parish would be divided into one or more manors. As with other manors, the area held declined over time, and Barking Abbey was dissolved in 1539. The parish boundaries remained constant and were used to define Dagenham right up until the Municipal Borough of Dagenham was abolished in 1965.

===Pre-urban landscape===
Like most Essex Thames-side parishes, Dagenham was laid out on a N-S axis to give it a share of the marshes by the river, the agricultural land in the centre and the woods and commons on the poorer soils on the high ground in the north. Dagenham included a significant part of the now mostly lost Hainault Forest.

===Dagenham Breach===

South of Dagenham was a low-lying area including the Dagenham levels and Dagenham Marsh, these having been subject to periodic flooding from the Thames, and flood banks were built to protect the farmland, culminating in defences and a flood gate on the River Beam being built in the 17th century by Dutch engineers. In 1707 an exceptionally high tide swept away fourteen feet of embankment and flooded over 1,000 acres of land, the description given by Daniel Defoe when he visited eight years later giving the area inundated as being 5000 acres is today considered an exaggeration. 

The &quot;Dagenham Breach&quot; widened over time to a width of 400 feet, allowing the Thames to strip the top layer of marsh clay from the flood plain and deposited it as a mud bank in the Thames where it became a danger to shipping. Despite various remedies, the breach was not securely filled and a further flood occurred in 1718 after which, under an act of parliament, over £40,000 of public money was spent on successfully closing the breach roughly at the location of Dagenham Dock. The closure of the gap left behind a large lake, also known as &quot;Dagenham Breach&quot; which became a popular spot for anglers. The lake is still there but much of it has silted up or been filled in and is now surrounded by industry, but parts can still be identified as the lakes to the north of Ford&#x27;s plant and also where Breach Lane follows the now lost western outline of the lake.

===Whitebait Dinners===
Dagenham was formerly home to the famous annual whitebait feast. The custom appears to have been started by the King&#x27;s Commissioner of Works to celebrate the closure of the breach in the seawall around 1714–20, and was held every subsequent spring, on or around Trinity Sunday.

Many years later, Sir Robert Preston MP, invited his friend George Rose the Secretary of the Treasury and others to celebrate the feast, and on another occasion Rose invited the Prime Minister, William Pitt. Thereafter it became an obligatory ritual of government for the entire cabinet to come to Dagenham and celebrate the security of the Thames and over time this simple but hearty meal based on Whitebait and local Essex Ale grew more lavish, including turtle, grouse, champagne and a range of other luxury food and drink. Eventually the cabinet tired of the long trip to Dagenham and moved the event to Greenwich.

===Economic development===
In 1931 the Ford Motor Company relocated from Trafford Park in Manchester, to a larger new plant in Dagenham, which was already the location of supplier Briggs Motorway Bodies. A riverside site was developed to become Europe&#x27;s largest car plant, a vast vertically integrated site with its own blast furnaces and power station, importing iron ore and exporting finished vehicles. By the 1950s Ford had taken over Briggs at Dagenham and its other sites at Doncaster, Southampton, Croydon and Romford. At its peak the Dagenham plant had of floor space and employed over 40,000 people, although this number gradually fell during the final three decades of the 20th century as production methods advanced and Ford invested in other European factories as well. Some of Britain&#x27;s best selling cars, including the Fiesta, Escort, Cortina and Sierra, were produced at the plant over the next 71 years.

On 20 February 2002, full production was discontinued due to overcapacity in Europe and the relative difficulty of upgrading the ageing site compared with mostly newer European production facilities such as Almussafes (Valencia, Spain) and Cologne. Other factors leading to the closure of the Auto-assembly line were the need of the site for the new Diesel Centre of Excellence, which produces half of Ford&#x27;s Diesel Engines worldwide, and the UK employment laws when compared to Spanish, German and Belgian laws.

In 2005 Cummins went into a joint venture and offered $15 million (US) to reinstate the factory. Ford and Cummins offered a good redundancy package, billed as one of the best in UK manufacturing. It is the location of the Dagenham wind turbines. Some 4,000 people now work at the Ford plant. The movie &quot;Made in Dagenham&quot; (2010) is a dramatisation of the 1968 Ford sewing machinists strike at the plant, when female workers walked out in protest against sexual discrimination and unequal pay.

Sterling, who manufactured British Army weapons and Jaguar car parts, were also based in Dagenham until they went bankrupt in 1988.

Other industrial names once known worldwide were Ever Ready, whose batteries could be found in shops throughout the Commonwealth, Bergers Paint and the chemical firm of May &amp; Baker who in 1935 revolutionized the production of antibiotics with their synthetic sulfa-drug known as M&amp;B 693. The May &amp; Baker plant, owned and run by Sanofi-Aventis, occupied a 108-acre site in Rainham Road South, near Dagenham East Underground station. It was abandoned in 2013 when the company closed it. BeFirst, a company working on behalf of the council, began to redevelop the site for commercial opportunities. It is now the London East Business and Technical Park. NTT have their London1 data centre on this site, and the Eastbrook Studios is currently under construction.

===Local government===
Dagenham was an ancient, and later civil, parish in the Becontree hundred of Essex. The Metropolitan Police District was extended in 1840 to include Dagenham. The parish formed part of the Romford Rural District from 1894. Dagenham Parish Council offices were located on Bull Street.

The expansion of the Greater London conurbation into the area caused the review of local government structures, and it was suggested in 1920 that the Dagenham parish should be abolished and its area divided between Ilford Urban District and Barking Town Urban District. Separately, the London County Council proposed that its area of responsibility should be expanded beyond the County of London to cover the area. Instead, in 1926 the Dagenham parish was removed from the Romford Rural District and designated as an urban district. In 1938, in further recognition of its development, Dagenham became a municipal borough. In 1965 the Municipal Borough of Dagenham was abolished and its former area became part of the London Borough of Barking, which was renamed Barking and Dagenham in 1980. For elections to the Greater London Council, Dagenham was part of the Barking electoral division until 1973 and then the Dagenham electoral division until 1986.

===Market gardens to suburban estate===
In 1205 Dagenham was large enough to have a chaplain, and the Parish Church of St Peter and St Paul was probably built at around that time. In 1854, the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway was built through the south of Dagenham, near the River Thames. In 1885 a new direct route from Barking to Pitsea, via Upminster, was built with Dagenham station opened just north of the village. Dagenham Dock station opened on the original southern route in 1908. Dagenham was still an undeveloped village, when building of the vast Becontree estate by the London County Council began in the early 1920s. The building of the enormous council estate, which also spread into the neighbouring parishes of Ilford and Barking, caused a rapid increase in population. In 1932 the electrified District line of the London Underground was extended to Upminster through Dagenham with stations opened as &quot;Dagenham&quot; and &quot;Heathway&quot; and today called Dagenham East and Dagenham Heathway. Dagenham East was the location of the Dagenham East rail crash in 1958. Services on the London Tilbury &amp; Southend line at Dagenham East were withdrawn in 1962.

==Governance==
The 2010 wards of Eastbrook, Heath, River, Village and Whalebone are in the Dagenham and Rainham Parliamentary Constituency. The 2010 wards of Alibon, Mayesbrook, Parsloes, Thames and Valence are in the Barking Parliamentary Constituency. Each ward in B&amp;D elects two or three councillors to Barking and Dagenham London Borough Council. The whole area is within the City and East London Assembly Constituency.

==Geography==

Dagenham is located approximately east of Charing Cross in Central London. The Becontree estate is largely in the pre-1965 borough of Dagenham, which also included Becontree Heath, part of Rush Green, Old Dagenham village, and the southern section around Dagenham Dock and adjacent to the River Thames. This southern section, which includes Ford Dagenham, is part of the London Riverside section of the Thames Gateway redevelopment zone. Including new developments of Beam Park and Dagenham Green. 

The Dagenham post town includes the whole of the Becontree estate, including those sections that were in the former (pre 1965) boroughs of Barking and Ilford. Parts of the former borough of Dagenham – part of Chadwell Heath, part of Collier Row and part of Rush Green – are in the Romford Post town. It is adjacent to Barking to the west, Romford to northeast and Hornchurch to the east. Dagenham Dock on the River Thames is to the south.

==Demography==
Dagenham is a working class area. During the 2000s there was a large influx of migrants, in particular Africans. The current population of the former (pre 1965) Borough of Dagenham could be approximated from the population of the current wards which together most closely match the area, but the former boundary between the borough and neighbouring Barking, with which it merged in 1965, no longer corresponds to any ward boundaries.

At the time of the 2011 census, the Alibon ward (north of Heathway station) was 61% White British and 15% Black African. Goresbrook ward (southwest from Heathway) was 57% White British and 17% Black African. River ward (south of Heathway) was 51% White British and 19% Black African. Village ward (east from Heathway) was 58% White British and 19% Black African. Eastbrook ward (around Eastbrookend Country Park) was 69% White British and 11% Black African. Heath ward (north of Heathway) was 60% White British and 17% Black African.

==Economy==
The former May and Baker plant site at Dagenham East is now a centre of film and television production. Called Eastbrook Studios London. 

==Transport==
Dagenham is connected to the London Underground services from three stations, Becontree (in the pre-1965 borough of Barking), Dagenham East and Dagenham Heathway, all on the District line. c2c, part of National Rail operated by Trenitalia since February 2017, runs a train service through Dagenham Dock station. Elizabeth Line services also operate from nearby Chadwell Heath station.

A proposed, and as yet unfunded Docklands Light Railway extension from Gallions Reach to Dagenham Dock. It was anticipated that the project could be completed and open for use by 2017. However the public inquiry has been postponed due to concerns about funding.

Dagenham Heathway is served by the following Transport for London contracted routes: London Buses routes 145, 173, 174, 175 and 364. Routes 145, 173, 174, 175, 287, and EL2 operate in the Dagenham Dock area. Routes 103, 145, and 364 operate in Dagenham East. 

Bus routes 5, 103, 128, 150, 173, 175, 499, and N15, and East London Transit service EL2 operate from Becontree Heath, north of Dagenham. Routes 128 and EL1 run a 24-hour service, while the N15 runs through the night.

== Culture ==
Valence House, in Becontree Avenue, is the only surviving of the five manor houses of Dagenham.
Dating back to the 13th century, it is sited in parkland and there is a moat around part of it. Valence House is the London Borough of Barking &amp; Dagenham&#x27;s local history museum, displaying artifacts and archives that tell the story of the lives of the people of Barking and Dagenham. The collection also includes portraits, family papers and other mementos of the Fanshawe family, who occupied Parsloes Manor, since demolished, from the sixteenth century.
The Fanshawe collection is &quot;one of the best collections of gentry portraits in the country and is of international importance&quot;, according to Valence House.
Among members of the Fanshawe family was the diplomat Sir Richard Fanshawe, 1st Baronet, whose portrait is at Valence House. Nine successive members of the Fanshawe family served as Remembrancer to the Crown, following Henry Fanshawe&#x27;s appointment to the position by Queen Elizabeth I in 1566. The appointment made possible the family&#x27;s rise to prominence.

In the post town of Romford and the pre-1965 borough of Dagenham, on the corner of Whalebone Lane and the Eastern Avenue, diagonally opposite the Moby-Dick public house, is the site of Marks Manor House, a large 15th-century moated building demolished in the early 19th century. During World War II the adjoining fields were used by the Royal Artillery for an anti-aircraft battery; later a prisoner-of-war camp for Germans was erected there. Further south down Whalebone Lane on the corner of the High Road is the Tollgate pub. This stands on the site of the milestone which marked the limit from the City of London and the turnpike toll-gate.

The Roundhouse public house on the junction of Porters Avenue and Lodge Avenue (in the pre-1965 borough of Barking) became eastern Greater London&#x27;s premier rock-music venue between 1969 and 1975, incorporating the &quot;Village Blues Club&quot;. Notable performers at the pub included Jethro Tull, Supertramp, Queen, Pink Floyd, Eric Clapton, Status Quo, and Led Zeppelin (on 5 April 1969). The Eastbrook is a Grade II* listed pub. Given the influence of U.S. blues on the English musicians who played at the Roundhouse, journalist Nik Cohn called the London of the late 1960s and early 1970s the &quot;Dagenham Delta&quot;.

===Media===
The &quot;Barking &amp; Dagenham Post&quot; is printed weekly and also published online.

==Sport==

Greyhound racing and Motorcycle speedway was staged at the Dagenham Greyhound Stadium off Ripple Road, from 1930 to 1965. The speedway club ran various events from 1932 to 1939 and a team called the Dagenham Daggers took part in challenge matches and the Sunday Dirt-Track League.

Dagenham&#x27;s leading cricket club Goresbrook Cricket Club are based at the May &amp; Baker Sports Club in Rainham Road South, in 2011 the club won the Essex County Cricket League for the first time in its history.

Dagenham has a King George&#x27;s Field in memorial to King George V. The park was renamed in 1953 by Queen Elizabeth II. Dagenham also has many other parks such as Valence - and Parsloes (which lies partly in the pre-1965 borough of Barking). Dagenham Crusaders Drum and Bugle Corps, founded by John Johnson, was the first British Drum Corps and performed in the United States for the first time in 1983. In 2010 they reformed to perform for DCUK&#x27;s 30th anniversary, fielding a competitive corps for the first time in 22 years.

== Dagenham Flat Fire ==

In the early hours of 26 August 2024, a fire blazed through the Spectrum Building, a tower block mostly of flats on Freshwater Road, Dagenham. Emergency services received the first report of the fire at 02:44 local time, with the first fire engine arriving at 02:49 local time. More than 100 people were evacuated, at least 20 being rescued by firefighters. 225 firefighters and at least 40 fire engines responded to the incident. 

Four people were treated by ambulances at the scene, of which two were taken to hospital.

At 12:35 local time, Assistant Commissioner Patrick Goulbourne of the London Fire Brigade announced &quot;everyone has been accounted for&quot; and they had &quot;Stood down the Major Incident&quot;

<text>Abraham ben Meir Ibn Ezra (, often abbreviated as ; &quot;Ibrāhim al-Mājid ibn Ezra&quot;; also known as Abenezra or simply Ibn Ezra, 1089 / 1092 – 27 January 1164 / 23 January 1167) was one of the most distinguished Jewish biblical commentators and philosophers of the Middle Ages. He was born in Tudela, Taifa of Zaragoza (present-day Navarre).

==Biography==

Abraham Ibn Ezra was born in Tudela, one of the oldest and most important Jewish communities in Navarre. At the time, the town was under the rule of the emirs of the Muslim Taifa of Zaragoza. However, when he later moved to Córdoba, he claimed it was his birthplace. Ultimately, most scholars agree that his place of birth was Tudela.

From outside sources, little is known of ibn Ezra&#x27;s family; however, he wrote of a marriage to a wife who produced five children. While it is believed four died early, the last-born, Isaac, became an influential poet and a later convert to Islam in 1140. His son&#x27;s conversion was deeply troubling for ibn Ezra, leading him to pen many poems reacting to the event for years afterward.

Ibn Ezra was a close friend of Judah Halevi, who was approximately 14 years older. When ibn Ezra moved to Córdoba as a young man, Halevi followed him. This trend continued when the two began their lives as wanderers in 1137. Halevi died in 1141, but Ibn Ezra continued travelling for three decades, reaching as far as Baghdad. During his travels, he composed secular poetry of the lands he traveled through and rationalist Torah commentaries (for which he would be best remembered).

He appears to have been unrelated to the contemporary scholar Moses ibn Ezra.

== Works ==

In Spain, Ibn Ezra had already gained the reputation of a distinguished poet and thinker. However, apart from his poems, the vast majority of his work was composed after 1140. Written in Hebrew, as opposed to earlier thinkers&#x27; use of Judeo-Arabic, these works covering Hebrew grammar, Biblical exegesis, and scientific theory were tinged with the work of Arab scholars he had studied in Spain.

Beginning many of his writings in Italy, Ibn Ezra also worked extensively to translate the works of grammarian and biblical exegetist Judah ben David Hayyuj from their original Judeo-Arabic to Hebrew. Published as early as 1140, these translations became some of the first expositions of Hebrew grammar to be written in Hebrew.

During his time of publishing translations, Ibn Ezra also began to publish his own biblical commentaries. Making use of many of the techniques outlined by Hayyuj, Ibn Ezra would publish his first biblical commentary, a commentary on Kohelet in 1140. He would continue to publish such commentaries over mostly works from Ketuvim and Nevi&#x27;im throughout his journey, though he would manage to publish a short commentary over the entire Pentateuch while living in Lucca in 1145. This short commentary would be amended into longer portions beginning in 1155 with the publication of his expanded commentary on Genesis.

Besides his commentaries on the Torah, Ibn Ezra would also publish a multitude of works on science in Hebrew. In doing so, he would continue his mission of spreading the knowledge he had gained in Spain to the Jews throughout the areas he visited and lived. This can be seen particularly in the works he published while living in France. Here, many of the works published can be seen as relating to astrology, and use of the astrolabe.

== Influence on biblical criticism and philosophy of religion ==
In his commentary, Ibn Ezra adhered to the literal sense of the texts, avoiding Rabbinic allegory and Kabbalistic interpretation. He exercised an independent criticism that, according to some writers, exhibits a marked tendency toward rationalism. In addition, he sharply criticized those who blended the simplistic and logical explanation with Midrash, maintaining that such interpretations were never intended to supplant the plain understanding.

Indeed, Ibn Ezra is claimed by proponents of higher biblical criticism of the Torah as one of its earliest pioneers. Baruch Spinoza, in concluding that Moses did not author the Torah and that the Torah and other protocanonical books were written or redacted by somebody else, cites Ibn Ezra&#x27;s commentary on Deuteronomy. In his commentary, Ibn Ezra examines Deuteronomy 1:1 and expresses concern over the unusual phrasing that describes Moses as being &quot;beyond the Jordan.&quot; This wording suggests that the writer was situated in the land of Canaan, which is located west of the Jordan River, even though Moses and the Children of Israel had not yet crossed the Jordan at that point in the Biblical narrative. Relating this inconsistency to others in the Torah, Ibn Ezra stated, &quot;If you can grasp the mystery behind the following problematic passages: 1) The final twelve verses of this book [i.e., Deuteronomy 34:1–12, describing the death of Moses], 2) &#x27;Moshe wrote [this song on the same day, and taught it to the children of Israel]&#x27; [Deuteronomy 31:22]; 3) &#x27;At that time, the Canaanites dwelt in the land&#x27; [Genesis 12:6]; 4) &#x27;... In the mountain of God, He will appear&#x27; [Genesis 22:14]; 5) &#x27;behold, his [Og king of Bashan] bed is a bed of iron [is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon?]&#x27; you will understand the truth.&quot;Spinoza concluded that Ibn Ezra&#x27;s reference to &quot;the truth&quot;, and other such references scattered throughout Ibn Ezra&#x27;s commentary in reference to seemingly anachronistic verses, as &quot;a clear indication that it was not Moses who wrote the Pentateuch but someone else who lived long after him, and that it was a different book that Moses wrote&quot;. Spinoza and later scholars were thus able to expand on several of Ibn Ezra&#x27;s references as a means of providing stronger evidence for non-Mosaic authorship.

On the other hand, Orthodox writers have stated that Ibn Ezra&#x27;s commentary can be interpreted as consistent with Jewish tradition, stating that the Torah was divinely dictated to Moses.

Ibn Ezra is also among the first scholars known to have published a text about the division of the Book of Isaiah into at least two distinct parts. In his commentary to Isaiah, he remarked that chapters 1-39 dealt with a different historical period (second half of the 8th century BCE) than chapters 40-66 (later than the last third of the 6th century BCE). This division of the book into First Isaiah and Deutero-Isaiah has been accepted nowadays by all but the most conservative Jews and Christians.

Ibn Ezra&#x27;s commentaries, especially some of the longer excursuses, contain numerous contributions to the philosophy of religion. One work in particular that belongs to this province, &quot;Yesod Mora&quot; (&quot;Foundation of Awe&quot;), on the division and the reasons for the Biblical commandments, he wrote in 1158 for a London-based friend, Joseph ben Jacob. In his philosophical thought, Neoplatonic ideas prevail, and astrology also had a place in his view of the world. He also wrote various works on mathematical and astronomical subjects.

=== Astrology ===
Ibn Ezra composed his first book on astrology in Italy, before his move to France:
* &quot;Mishpetai ha-Mazzelot&quot; (&quot;Judgments of the Zodiacal Signs&quot;), on the general principles of astrology

In seven books written in Béziers in 1147–1148 Ibn Ezra then composed a systematic presentation of astrology, starting with an introduction and a book on general principles, and then five books on particular branches of the subject. The presentation appears to have been planned as an integrated whole, with cross-references throughout, including references to subsequent books in the future tense. Each of the books is known in two versions, so it seems that at some point Ibn Ezra also created a revised edition of the series.
* &quot;Reshit Hokhma&quot; (&quot;The Beginning of Wisdom&quot;), an introduction to astrology, perhaps a revision of his earlier book
* &quot;Sefer ha-Te&#x27;amim&quot; (&quot;Book of Reasons&quot;), an overview of Arabic astrology, giving explanations for the material in the previous book.

* Translation of two works by the astrologer Mashallah ibn Athari: &quot;She&#x27;elot&quot; and &quot;Qadrut&quot;.

=== Poetry ===
There are a great many other poems by Ibn Ezra, some of them religious and some secular – about friendship, wine, didactic or satirical. Like his friend Yehuda Halevi, he used the Arabic poetic form of Muwashshah.

== Legacy ==
The crater Abenezra on the Moon was named in honor of Ibn Ezra.

Robert Browning&#x27;s poem &quot;Rabbi ben Ezra&quot;, beginning &quot;Grow old along with me/The best is yet to be&quot;, is derived from a meditation on Ibn Ezra&#x27;s life and work that appeared in Browning&#x27;s 1864 poetry collection &quot;Dramatis Personæ.&quot;

== Burial ==
According to Jewish tradition, Abraham ibn Ezra was buried in Cabul, alongside Judah Halevi.

<text>Jonathan Archer is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. He is one of the protagonists of the television series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, where he was portrayed by Scott Bakula.

Archer was the commanding officer of the first starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; (NX-01) from 2151 to 2161. Archer also played a major role in the formation of Starfleet and the United Federation of Planets, and was later President of the United Federation of Planets from 2184 to 2192. According to a computer display in the episode &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot;, historian John Gill considered Archer &quot;the greatest explorer of the 22nd century.&quot;

==Biography==
===History===

Archer, the son of famed warp engineer Henry Archer and his wife Sally, was born in 2112 on August 4 in Upstate New York, where he spent most of his formative years; he later claimed to have spent the majority of his life in San Francisco. The second-season episode &quot;First Flight&quot; depicts in flashback that he spent many years as a test pilot in the nascent Starfleet&#x27;s NX program, based in San Francisco. His dreams of exploring started as a boy. As a youth, Archer earned the Eagle Scout Award, along with 26 Merit Badges, from the Boy Scouts of America. (Mentioned in the episode &quot;Rogue Planet&quot;.) He is an avid water polo fan, and often relaxes by watching water polo games.

Archer grew up with a distrust of Vulcans, perceiving them as having held back humanity&#x27;s progress, particularly with regard to his father&#x27;s warp five project. As a commander, Archer served as a test-pilot in the NX warp trials with A.G. Robinson, Duvall and Gardner. (All mentioned in the episode &quot;First Flight&quot;. It is assumed it is this Gardner who becomes Admiral when Maxwell Forrest dies in &quot;The Forge&quot;.) Robinson pushed the limits of a test ship, the NX-Alpha, resulting in its destruction. The Vulcans recommended terminating the warp trials, which Starfleet agreed to, until Charles Tucker III (who would later serve as chief engineer under Archer) fixed the intermix ratios, and Archer and Robinson took the NX-Beta, the second test ship, without clearance to prove its readiness. The suspension of Archer did not completely stop the progress of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s construction, as the program eventually resumed after a six-month halt.

=== Seasons 1 and 2 ===
As a man who loves to travel amongst the stars, Archer learns that being captain is a larger duty than manager and astronomer. He ran into species from all over the quadrant trying to kill him and his crew. Encounters with the Mazarites, Xindi, Tholians, Suliban and Klingons caused Archer to become more of a military commander.

In addition, Archer learns that the duties of captain include being a diplomat. During Seasons 1 and 2, he is somewhat uncomfortable with this role, especially in the episode &quot;A Night in Sickbay&quot; when his pet beagle, Porthos, contracts a deadly illness on an alien world.

While exploring, Archer becomes an enemy of the Klingons. In a dispute with the Klingon Empire in 2152, he is convicted and sentenced to exile on Rura Penthe, even though he is innocent of the charges and despite the Klingons having acknowledged his previous service to the Empire. With his escape, a bounty is put on Archer&#x27;s head and tensions with the Klingon Empire increase.

Also during this period, Archer has the distinction of making Earth&#x27;s official first contact with dozens of alien races, including the Akaali, the Andorians, Axanar, Suliban, Tandarans, Tellarites, Tholians, Xindi and Romulans.

===Temporal Cold War===
Although initially optimistic, Archer becomes involved in his first mission as captain of &quot;Enterprise&quot; in the middle of the Temporal Cold War. The Temporal Cold War begins at the beginning of the pilot episode, &quot;Broken Bow&quot;. In that episode, the audience is introduced to the Suliban and a mysterious being from the future (informally referred to as &quot;Future Guy&quot;) who is guiding them.

As the Temporal Cold War continues, Archer also meets Daniels, whose purpose seemingly is to safeguard Archer in particular and &quot;Enterprise&quot; in general. Daniels&#x27; comments are that Archer will be the man who helps form the United Federation of Planets, and it becomes apparent by the third season that Daniels is representing the Federation throughout the Temporal Cold War.

===Season 3===
In Season 3, he was the military commander in the Expanse. Following the Xindi attack on Earth in 2153, Archer becomes a changed man.No longer a congenial captain, he is now driven and determined to seek out and confront the perpetrators. Archer commits desperate, controversial acts of questionable morality to ensure a future for Earth, including torturing a prisoner, cloning Tucker to harvest body parts to save the chief engineer and thus killing the clone, and stealing a vital warp coil and leaving a ship of aliens stranded in space.

While on his mission to locate the Xindi, Archer is briefly transformed into a member of the extinct Loque&#x27;eque by a mutagenic virus. Later, he is infected by subspace parasites, creating an alternate timeline in which the &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s mission fails and the Xindi succeed in destroying Earth (although the nature of these parasites mean that this timeline is erased when Phlox&#x27;s cure for Archer erases the parasites themselves from history). With the help of Daniels, Archer, along with T&#x27;Pol, travels back in time to the year 2004 to prevent the release of a Xindi-Reptilian bio-weapon.

By the end of the season, Archer is presumed dead when the Xindi superweapon is destroyed, after having convinced three of the five Xindi races that reports of humanity&#x27;s future conflict with them are wrong. However, in reality, he is transported back to the early 1940s during World War II, as is the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

===Season 4===
After returning home in 2154, Archer helps a faction of Vulcans fight an oppressive government on their planet. During this incident, he is the recipient of the &quot;katra&quot;, or living spirit, of the great Vulcan philosopher Surak. The &quot;katra&quot; is later transferred to a Vulcan priest, and Archer is left unharmed. This leads to the reformation of Vulcan society, and explains why the Vulcans of Archer&#x27;s time were so different from the Vulcans of Kirk&#x27;s time. In the process, Archer becomes the first known Human participant in a Vulcan mind meld. Since that experience, he has used that knowledge at least once: To assist T&#x27;Pol with conducting her first mind meld to gain information about who kidnapped Dr. Phlox (the episode &quot;Affliction&quot;).

Archer is also involved in one of the first, and possibly most significant, treaties yet, being asked to escort Gral, the Tellarite ambassador, to the Tellarite-Andorian negotiations. En route, he and his crew run into the Andorian Shran, a long-time friend/enemy/ally. During Shran&#x27;s stay, Romulans attack and cause the fragile alliance to crash to a halt. In the mix-up, a Tellarite kills Shran&#x27;s lover Talas, and Shran avenges her death by demanding the Tellarite who killed her to fight to the death. In an attempt to protect the fragile peace treaty, Archer takes the challenge instead and Shran is incapacitated. The alliance remains intact, and soon evolves into the United Federation of Planets. (&quot;Babel One&quot;, &quot;United&quot;, &quot;The Aenar&quot;, &quot;Demons&quot;, &quot;Terra Prime&quot;, &quot;These Are the Voyages...&quot;).

===Place in history===
The time traveler Daniels revealed that Archer would eventually have a major role in the founding of the United Federation of Planets in 2161. He briefly took Archer ahead in time to the point where Archer is about to sign the Federation accords on Earth, expanded further in the series finale.

Archer&#x27;s fate is revealed in the episode &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly, Part II&quot; when a computer information screen aboard the 23rd century Starfleet vessel USS &quot;Defiant&quot; is briefly visible. According to the computer profile, Archer was an Admiral and Chief of Staff at Starfleet Command at the time of his retirement. He later went on to serve as ambassador to Andoria from 2165 to 2175. From 2175 to 2183, Archer served as a member of the Federation Council, followed by eight years as Federation President (2184–2192). He was also an honorary member of the Andorian Imperial Guard. Historian John Gill considered Archer &quot;the greatest explorer of the 22nd century.&quot; The same computer display states that Archer&#x27;s Planet and Archer IV (mentioned in &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Strange New World&quot; respectively) were named after him.

Unused production artwork would have shown that Archer dies peacefully in his sleep at his home in Upstate New York in 2245, exactly one day after he attends the commissioning ceremony of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (NCC-1701). However, this biographical computer display contained a number of discrepancies, including listing 2160 as the year that Archer&#x27;s captaincy of &quot;Enterprise&quot; came to an end. The series later established that Archer&#x27;s command ended in 2161, as seen in the series finale, &quot;These Are the Voyages...&quot;.

At least three starships were named after him: the &quot;Archer&quot;-class scout ship featured in the tie-in novel series &quot;Star Trek: Vanguard&quot; and its follow-up &quot;Star Trek: Seekers&quot;, an unspecified ship alluded to in &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; and the USS Archer NCC-627 in the pilot episode of &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot;. Archer Spacedock from &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; is also named for Jonathan Archer.

The 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; film briefly references Archer, as Montgomery Scott receives punishment stemming from an incident involving a transporter and &quot;Admiral Archer&#x27;s prized beagle.&quot; There was some confusion as to if this actually referred to Jonathan Archer himself as this would make him 141 years old. &quot;Star Trek&quot; writer Bob Orci went on record to clear up the issue, &quot;Admiral Archer is a reference to the Archer we all know and love, and yes he would be over 100, which is a likely life expectancy in a futuristic space faring race of humans (as depicted by McCoy’s (DeForest Kelley, playing the 137 year old Admiral) appearance in &quot;The Next Generation&quot;.)&quot;

In the &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; episode &quot;Choose Your Pain&quot;, Archer is shown listed on the Starfleet Database as one of Starfleet&#x27;s most decorated Captains as of 2256. Also included in the list are: Robert April, Matthew Decker, Philippa Georgiou, and Christopher Pike.

===Porthos===
Porthos is Archer&#x27;s dog. One of four males born in a litter of English Beagles, Porthos and his brothers, Athos, Aramis and d&#x27;Artagnan, were named after characters from &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; by Alexandre Dumas, père. He has been Archer&#x27;s faithful companion since the age of six weeks, and has remained so for the duration of Archer&#x27;s 10-year assignment as captain of &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

Porthos was portrayed by a male beagle named Prada in Season 1. Afterwards, he was played by a further two female beagles, Breezy and Windy, although the character of Porthos remained male.

Archer would occasionally leave Porthos in the care of Dr. Phlox when he was away or otherwise unavailable.

Archer cares very much for Porthos. In the pilot episode, Travis Mayweather says Archer won&#x27;t use the transporter for himself and certainly not for his dog. In &quot;A Night in Sickbay&quot;, Porthos nearly dies when he contracts a deadly pathogen on the Kreetassan homeworld, but is saved when Phlox transplants a gland from a chameleon-like creature.

In &quot;Similitude&quot;, Archer explains in answer to the question &quot;Can he do any tricks?&quot; that &quot;I haven&#x27;t taught him any, mostly what he does is eat, sleep and not fetch.&quot; He also commented &quot;there&#x27;s nothing Porthos likes more than dinner time&quot;.

Although Porthos is not the first domesticated pet to be featured in a &quot;Star Trek&quot; series (Data owned a cat, Spot, in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and Captain Jean-Luc Picard owned a lionfish named Livingston), Porthos has the distinction of being the first pet to maintain an ongoing presence in the series, and even – as illustrated above – become the focus of an episode.

In the Mirror Universe depicted in &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot;, Porthos is a Rottweiler. According to the episode&#x27;s podcast on Startrek.com, the dog that portrayed the mirror Porthos was known on set as an even bigger &quot;baby&quot; than the dogs which have played the regular Porthos. Episode writer Mike Sussman noted that the animal was &quot;The sweetest dog I have ever met.&quot;

In the episode &quot;Acquisition&quot;, Porthos was interrogated by a group of Ferengi pirates while the rest of the crew were incapacitated, but the aliens&#x27; universal translator could not decipher his barking. The pirates didn&#x27;t know what to make of the dog, even speculating that he was perhaps food. They then decided they could sell him to a zoo.

Brannon Braga&#x27;s nephew had a dog named Porthos, which he thought was good name for a dog and took as inspiration for Archer&#x27;s dog.

==Mirror Universe==
In the Mirror Universe, Jonathan Archer was first officer of the ISS &quot;Enterprise&quot; with the rank of Commander. In this universe, he served under the command of Captain Maximilian Forrest, the alternate version of Admiral Maxwell Forrest. Unlike in the &quot;normal&quot; &quot;Trek&quot; universe, where Forrest and Archer are close friends, the mirror versions of the characters did not get along well at all.

Like most characters in the Terran Empire, the mirror Archer was treacherous, cunning and scheming. He led a mutiny against Forrest and took over &quot;Enterprise&quot;. However, with the help of T&#x27;Pol and other Vulcans, Forrest was freed and retook the ship. Archer surrendered, but had locked the ship&#x27;s navigation controls so its heading could not be altered. His reason for the mutiny was brought to light as he had been informed about a ship that seemed to be from another dimension. With the ship&#x27;s course unable to be changed and Starfleet now intrigued by what Archer had become aware of, Forrest was ordered to investigate, he also had Archer punished in the Agony Booth for a then record of ten hours, giving the Commander only one hour to clean up and get ready for a staff meeting after his release. On arrival, they discovered the USS &quot;Defiant&quot;, a Starfleet ship from 100 years into the future of the &quot;normal&quot; universe.

Archer led an away team to take control of the &quot;Defiant&quot; while the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was destroyed by the Tholians. He and his team, plus survivors from the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, discovered the &quot;Defiant&quot; was not only from another dimension, but the future and that the alternate dimension never had a Terran Empire. After successfully crushing a rebellion against the Empire, Archer attempted to take the futuristic vessel to Earth where he would proclaim himself Emperor. However, before he could do so, he was killed by his universe&#x27;s Hoshi Sato, who poisoned him, took the ship and claimed the Terran throne for herself.

==Reception==
In 2019, &quot;Vulture&quot; ranked Captain Archer as the 8th &quot;Star Trek&quot; captain by their selection criterion, a combination of competency and managerial style. They note Archer as being interested in exploration, but also having a relaxed attitude and that he also enjoys spending times with friends and his pet dog. Space.com rated Archer as the sixth best captain of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ranked Archer as the seventh best Captain of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

&quot;Screen Rant&quot; rated Archer as the fourth best captain, noting that he had to pioneer space without the benefit of the institutions he helped to create, and noted his ability to take on challenges. CBR ranked Archer as the 5th best member of Starfleet 2018, in between Spock (#6) and Captain Janeway (#4) in their ranking.

In 2018, &quot;The Wrap&quot; ranked Archer as the 29th best main cast character of &quot;Star Trek&quot; overall. In 2016, Captain Archer was ranked as the 9th most important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe by &quot;Wired&quot;.

<doc id="143798" wikidata="Q5904981" url="?curid=143798" title="Horrendous Disc">
<text>Horrendous Disc is the third studio album by Christian rock band Daniel Amos. Originally recorded in 1978 for Maranatha! Music, it was not released until 1981 when it was issued by Larry Norman&#x27;s Solid Rock Records, weeks before the release of the band&#x27;s fourth album. The album is noted as a departure from the band&#x27;s early country rock sound.

==Background==
DA had almost completely abandoned the country sound of their first record by late 1977 and early 1978, when this album was recorded with co-producer Mike D. Stone.

The album was dropped by Maranatha! Music after the label decided to quit releasing rock and roll albums and focus on children&#x27;s releases and the new praise style of gospel music. So the band, now without a record contract, began to shop the project around to various labels like Curb/Warner Brothers. Word bought the tapes from Maranatha! and Larry Norman&#x27;s Solid Rock Records, home to such artists as Randy Stonehill, Tom Howard, Mark Heard, and others, leased the recordings from Word. Norman had the album mixed and took photos of the band for the album&#x27;s cover. In July 1979, Norman released a test pressing with a different track listing and slightly different mix. This pressing was distributed to reviewers and extra copies were taken on tour.

Some of the songs from the album, like &quot;Hound of Heaven&quot; were being performed by the band in concert as early as 1977. The album was first heard by the public on the &quot;Rock &amp; Religion Radio Show&quot; on January 20, 1980, when the test pressing was aired. Prior to this broadcast, music from the album was only heard in live performances. Several tracks were played and the band was interviewed about what they had hoped would be their soon-to-be-released album. For reasons that remain a mystery, the album was shelved by Solid Rock until its long overdue release in April 1981, nearly three years after it had been recorded and just weeks before the band&#x27;s follow up on Newpax Records, &quot;¡Alarma!&quot;, hit record stores.

==Reissues==
This album frequently appeared at the top of Christian Music magazine readers polls of the &quot;album that people most wanted to see released on CD,&quot; until its eventual reissue on CD in 2000. It was listed at No. 63 in the book &quot;CCM Presents: The 100 Greatest Albums in Christian Music&quot;.

The CD re-release stirred controversy among Daniel Amos fans by the inclusion of two bonus tracks: Tribute recordings that Norman recorded for the &quot;When Worlds Collide: A Tribute to Daniel Amos&quot; CD that he decided to include at the end of the &quot;Horrendous Disc&quot; CD. The covers sung by Norman were of his favorite Daniel Amos song – &quot;Hound of Heaven&quot;. One recording was a straight-ahead tribute version of the song and the second tribute recording was a version using a very laid–back jazz band. The decision to include these cover tracks on the CD, along with some long, wandering liner notes, bewildered DA fans.

Daniel Amos had approached Norman and Solid Rock Records about putting together a &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; of &quot;Horrendous Disc&quot; in 2006 with the original Horrendous Disc on the first disc and many bonus tracks on the second disc. Norman&#x27;s health delayed the project and he died before it could be finished. In the years that followed Norman&#x27;s death, DA has once again began to work with Solid Rock to create the ultimate &quot;Horrendous Disc&quot; reissue.

Work on the deluxe edition, a collaborative project between Stunt Records and Solid Rock Records, with a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign to generate the production budget, began in 2017. Due to the success of the campaign, what started as a plan to simply re-release the album with one or two bonus discs, grew into a definitive five-CD box set, five-vinyl box set and a book, &quot;The Horrendous Book&quot;. The five-CD box set was released on July 20, 2018.

==Reception==

Upon its release, &quot;CCM&quot; found its sound to be &quot;, &quot; compared to the group&#x27;s other releases. AllMusic gave a positive retrospective review, praising the &quot;blistering riffs&quot; of &quot;I Love You #19&quot;, the &quot;sardonic humor and wit&quot; of &quot;(Nearsighted Girl With Approaching) Tidal Wave&quot;, and the &quot;spooky concept-album-type finish&quot; of the title track, but concluding the entire release to be &quot;A great album all around.&quot;

<doc id="143803" wikidata="Q76469" url="?curid=143803" title="Tears">
<text>Tears are a clear liquid secreted by the lacrimal glands (tear gland) found in the eyes of all land mammals. Tears are made up of water, electrolytes, proteins, lipids, and mucins that form layers on the surface of eyes. The different types of tears—basal, reflex, and emotional—vary significantly in composition. 
 The functions of tears include lubricating the eyes (basal tears), removing irritants (reflex tears), and also aiding the immune system. Tears also occur as a part of the body&#x27;s natural pain response. Emotional secretion of tears may serve a biological function by excreting stress-inducing hormones built up through times of emotional distress. Tears have symbolic significance among humans.

== Physiology ==

=== Chemical composition ===
Tears are made up of three layers: lipid, aqueous, and mucous. Tears are composed of water, salts, antibodies, and lysozymes (antibacterial enzymes); though composition varies among different tear types. The composition of tears caused by an emotional reaction differs from that of tears as a reaction to irritants, such as onion fumes, dust, or allergens. Emotional tears contain higher concentrations of stress hormones such as adrenocorticotropic hormone and leucine enkephalin (a natural pain killer), which suggests that emotional tears play a biological role in balancing stress hormone levels. 
=== Drainage of tear film ===
The lacrimal glands secrete lacrimal fluid, which flows through the main excretory ducts into the space between the eyeball and the lids. When the eyes blink, the lacrimal fluid is spread across the surface of the eye. Lacrimal fluid gathers in the lacrimal lake which is found in the medial part of the eye. The lacrimal papilla is an elevation in the inner side of the eyelid, at the edge of the lacrimal lake. The lacrimal canaliculi open into the papilla. The opening of each canaliculus is the lacrimal punctum. From the punctum, tears will enter the lacrimal sac, then on to the nasolacrimal duct, and finally into the nasal cavity. An excess of tears, as caused by strong emotion, can cause the nose to run. Quality of vision is affected by the stability of the tear film.

=== Types ===
There are three basic types of tears: basal, reflex and emotional.
=== Nictitating membrane ===
Some mammals, such as cats, camels, polar bears, seals and aardvarks, have a full translucent third eyelid called a nictitating membrane, while others have a vestigial nictitating membrane. The membrane works to protect and moisten the eyelid while maintaining visibility. It also contributes to the aqueous portion of the tear film and possibly immunoglobulins. Humans and some primates have a much smaller nictitating membrane; this may be because they do not capture prey or root vegetation with their teeth, so that there is no evolutionary advantage of the third eyelid.

=== Neurology ===
The trigeminal V1 (fifth cranial) nerve bears the sensory pathway of the tear reflexes. When the trigeminal nerve is cut, tears from reflexes will stop, while emotional tears will not. The great (superficial) petrosal nerve from cranial nerve VII provides autonomic innervation to the lacrimal gland. It is responsible for the production of much of the aqueous portion of the tear film.

== Human culture ==
In nearly all human cultures, crying is associated with tears trickling down the cheeks and accompanied by characteristic sobbing sounds. Emotional triggers are most often sadness and grief, but crying can also be triggered by anger, happiness, fear, laughter or humor, frustration, remorse, or other strong, intense emotions. Emotional tears can also be triggered by listening to music or by reading, watching or listening to various forms of media. Crying is often associated with babies and children. Some cultures consider crying to be undignified and infantile, casting aspersions on those who cry publicly, except if it is due to the death of a close friend or relative. In most Western cultures, it is more socially acceptable for women and children to cry than men, reflecting masculine sex-role stereotypes. In some Latin regions, crying among men is more acceptable. There is evidence for an interpersonal function of crying as tears express a need for help and foster willingness to help in an observer.

Some modern psychotherapy movements such as Re-evaluation Counseling encourage crying as beneficial to health and mental well-being. An insincere display of grief or dishonest remorse is sometimes called crocodile tears in reference to an Ancient Greek anecdote that crocodiles would pretend to weep while luring or devouring their prey. In addition, &quot;crocodile tears syndrome&quot; is a colloquialism for Bogorad&#x27;s syndrome, an uncommon consequence of recovery from Bell&#x27;s palsy in which faulty regeneration of the facial nerve causes people to shed tears while eating.

== Pathology ==

=== Bogorad&#x27;s syndrome ===
Bogorad&#x27;s syndrome, also known as &quot;Crocodile Tears Syndrome&quot;, is an uncommon consequence of nerve regeneration subsequent to Bell&#x27;s palsy or other damage to the facial nerve. Efferent fibers from the superior salivary nucleus become improperly connected to nerve axons projecting to the lacrimal glands, causing one to shed tears (lacrimate) on the side of the palsy during salivation while smelling foods or eating. It is presumed that this would cause salivation while crying due to the inverse improper connection of the lacrimal nucleus to the salivary glands, but this would be less noticeable. The condition was first described in 1926 by its namesake, Russian neuropathologist F. A. Bogorad, in an article titled &quot;Syndrome of the Crocodile Tears&quot; (alternatively, &quot;The Symptom of the Crocodile Tears&quot;) that argued the tears were caused by the act of salivation.

=== Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye) ===
Keratoconjunctivitis sicca, known in the vernacular as dry eye, is a very common disorder of the tear film. Despite the eyes being dry, those affected can still experience watering of the eyes, which is, in fact, a response to irritation caused by the original tear film deficiency. Lack of Meibomian gland secretion can mean that the tears are not enveloped in a hydrophobic film coat, leading to tears spilling onto the face.

Treatment for dry eyes to compensate for the loss of tear film include eye-drops composed of methyl cellulose or carboxy- methyl cellulose or hemi-cellulose in strengths of either 0.5% or 1% depending upon the severity of drying up of the cornea.

=== Familial dysautonomia ===
Familial dysautonomia is a genetic condition that can be associated with a lack of overflow tears (Alacrima) during emotional crying.

Obstruction of the punctum, nasolacrimal canal, or nasolacrimal duct can cause even normal levels of the basal tear to overflow onto the face (Epiphora), giving the appearance of constant psychic tearing. This can have significant social consequences.

=== Pseudobulbar affect ===
Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is a condition involving episodic uncontrollable laughter or crying. PBA mostly occurs in people with neurological injuries affecting how the brain controls emotions. Scientists believe PBA results from prefrontal cortex damage. PBA often involves crying. Hence, PBA is mistakable for depression. But PBA is neurological; depression is psychological. Patients with PBA do not experience typical depression symptoms like sleep disturbances or appetite loss.

<doc id="143804" wikidata="Q961029" url="?curid=143804" title="¡Alarma! (album)">
<text>¡Alarma! is the fourth studio album by Christian rock band Daniel Amos, issued on Newpax Records in April 1981. It is the first album in their &quot;¡Alarma! Chronicles&quot; series and one of the earliest records in the Christian alternative rock genre.

==Background==
&quot;¡Alarma!&quot;, released weeks after the band&#x27;s Beatles- and Beach Boys-influenced &quot;Horrendous Disc&quot;, took a decidedly new wave direction along the lines of Elvis Costello or Talking Heads.

Lyrically, the album contains social commentary so harsh that &quot;CCM&quot; described it as &quot;perhaps the most scathing ever put out by a Christian label.&quot; Other critics offered the following assessments: &quot;the most exciting release of the year&quot;; &quot;brash, new and intensely creative&quot; and &quot;possibly the most significant album in the genre of Christian rock&quot;.
&quot;¡Alarma!&quot; was the first of a four-part series of albums by DA entitled &quot;The ¡Alarma! Chronicles&quot;, which also included the albums &quot;Doppelgänger&quot;, &quot;Vox Humana&quot;, and &quot;Fearful Symmetry&quot;. This album, along with the other three albums from the Alarma! Chronicles, was rereleased as part of the &quot;Alarma! Chronicles&quot; book set in 2000. The book set included three CDs and a hardcover book of lyrics, photos, liner notes, essays, interviews and other information that amounted to over 200 printed pages.

Bass guitarist Marty Dieckmeyer left the band before the &quot;¡Alarma! Tour&quot;, and was replaced with bassist Tim Chandler.

This album was listed at No. 62 in the book &quot;CCM Presents: The 100 Greatest Albums in Christian Music&quot; (Harvest House Publishers, 2001).

==Reissue==
In 2013, the album was remastered and repackaged as a two-CD deluxe edition by Stunt Records. Tom Gulotta and Eric Townsend were put in charge of compiling the project - bringing together previously unseen photos, never-before-heard out-takes, mixes and demos, and a reading of the first chapter of the &quot;Alarma Chronicles&quot; by Malcolm Wild.

<text>A doppelgänger ( ), sometimes spelled doppelgaenger or doppelganger, is a ghostly double of a living person, especially one that haunts its own fleshly counterpart.

In fiction and mythology, a doppelgänger is often portrayed as a ghostly or paranormal phenomenon and usually seen as a of bad luck. Other traditions and stories equate a doppelgänger with an evil twin. In modern times, the term twin stranger is occasionally used.

==Spelling==
The word &quot;doppelgänger&quot; is a loanword from the German noun , literally meaning &quot;double-walker&quot;. The singular and plural forms are the same in German, but English writers usually prefer the plural &quot;doppelgängers&quot;. In German, there is also a feminine form, (plural ). The first-known use, in the form , occurs in the novel &quot;Siebenkäs&quot; (1796) by Jean Paul, in which he explains his newly coined word in a footnote; the word also appears in the novel, but with a different meaning.

In German, the word is written (as is usual with German nouns) with an initial capital letter: . In English, the word is generally written with a lower-case letter, and the umlaut on the letter &quot;a&quot; is often dropped, rendering &quot;doppelganger&quot;.

==Mythology and folklore==
English-speakers have only recently applied this German word to a paranormal concept. Francis Grose&#x27;s &quot;Provincial Glossary&quot; of 1787 used the term &quot;fetch&quot; instead, defined as the &quot;apparition of a person living&quot;. Catherine Crowe&#x27;s book on paranormal phenomena, &quot;The Night-Side of Nature&quot; (1848) helped make the German word well known. The concept of alter egos and double spirits has appeared in the folklore, myths, religious concepts and traditions of many cultures throughout human history.

In Ancient Egyptian mythology, a &quot;ka&quot; was a tangible &quot;spirit double&quot; having the same memories and feelings as the person to whom the counterpart belongs. &quot;The Greek Princess&quot; presents an Egyptian view of the Trojan War in which a &quot;ka&quot; of Helen misleads Paris, helping to stop the war. This memic sense also appears in Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Helen&quot;. In Norse mythology, a &quot;vardøger&quot; is a ghostly double who is seen performing the person&#x27;s actions in advance. In Finnish mythology, this pattern is described as having an &quot;etiäinen&quot;, &quot;a firstcomer&quot;.

Many majority Muslim countries have the concept of a karin or qarin, which is a potentially benevolent or harmful spirit double of the same sex, race and parallel temperament as the person it is connected to. It bears children which are the spirit doubles of the person&#x27;s children. In some places the karin is the opposite sex of the person it represents. When malicious, it often tries to persuade the person it is connected to into following their bad whims. Some Sufi mystics pictured the karin as a devil residing in the blood and hearts of humans. It is more popular in some countries than others; for example, it is more popular in Egypt than Sudan.

In Joseph Wright&#x27;s &quot;English Dialect Dictionary&quot;, it was listed as a North Country term and as obsolete.

==Examples==
===John Donne===
Izaak Walton claimed that John Donne, the English metaphysical poet, saw his wife&#x27;s doppelgänger in 1612 in Paris, on the same night as the stillbirth of their daughter. This account first appears in the edition of &quot;Life of Dr. Rizvan Rizing&quot; published in 1675, and is attributed to &quot;a Person of Honour... told with such circumstances, and such asseveration, that... I verily believe he that told it to me, did himself believe it to be true&quot;.

R. C. Bald and R. E. Bennett questioned the veracity of Walton&#x27;s account.

===Percy Bysshe Shelley===
On 8 July 1822, the English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley drowned in the Bay of Spezia near Lerici in Italy. On 15 August, while staying at Pisa, Percy&#x27;s wife Mary Shelley, an author and editor, wrote a letter to Maria Gisborne in which she relayed Percy&#x27;s claims to her that he had met his own doppelgänger. A week after Mary&#x27;s nearly fatal miscarriage, in the early hours of 23 June, Percy had had a nightmare about the house collapsing in a flood, and also

Percy Shelley&#x27;s drama &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; (1820) contains the following passage in Act I: &quot;Ere Babylon was dust, / The Magus Zoroaster, my dead child, / Met his own image walking in the garden. / That apparition, sole of men, he saw. / For know there are two worlds of life and death: / One that which thou beholdest; but the other / Is underneath the grave, where do inhabit / The shadows of all forms that think and live / Till death unite them and they part no more...&quot;

===Johann Wolfgang von Goethe===
Near the end of Book XI of his autobiography, &quot;Dichtung und Wahrheit&quot; (&quot;Poetry and Truth&quot;) (1811–1833), Goethe wrote, almost in passing:
Amid all this pressure and confusion I could not forego seeing Frederica once more. Those were painful days, the memory of which has not remained with me. When I reached her my hand from my horse, the tears stood in her eyes; and I felt very uneasy. I now rode along the foot-path toward Drusenheim, and here one of the most singular forebodings took possession of me. I saw, not with the eyes of the body, but with those of the mind, my own figure coming toward me, on horseback, and on the same road, attired in a dress which I had never worn,—it was pike-gray [&quot;hecht-grau&quot;], with somewhat of gold. As soon as I shook myself out of this dream, the figure had entirely disappeared. It is strange, however, that, eight years afterward, I found myself on the very road, to pay one more visit to Frederica, in the dress of which I had dreamed, and which I wore, not from choice, but by accident. However, it may be with matters of this kind generally, this strange illusion in some measure calmed me at the moment of parting. The pain of quitting for ever noble Alsace, with all I had gained in it, was softened; and, having at last escaped the excitement of a farewell, I, on a peaceful and quiet journey, pretty well regained my self-possession. 

This is an example of a doppelgänger which was perceived by the observer to be both benign and reassuring.

===Émilie Sagée===
Émilie Sagée, a French teacher working in 1845 in a boarding school in what is now Latvia, was alleged to have a doppelgänger which sometimes appeared to those around her, and which would mimic some of her actions. On one occasion her students approached the doppelgänger to touch it, and felt &quot;a slight resistance, which they likened to that which a fabric of fine muslin or crape would offer to the touch&quot;.

The story is reported by Robert Dale Owen.

===George Tryon===
A Victorian age example was the supposed appearance of Vice-Admiral Sir George Tryon. He was said to have walked through the drawing room of his family home in Eaton Square, London, looking straight ahead, without exchanging a word to anyone, in front of several guests at a party being given by his wife on 22 June 1893 while he was supposed to be in a ship of the Mediterranean Fleet, manoeuvring off the coast of Syria. Subsequently, it was reported that he had gone down with his ship, HMS &quot;Victoria&quot;, the very same night, after it collided with HMS &quot;Camperdown&quot; following an unexplained and bizarre order to turn the ship in the direction of the other vessel.

==In fiction==
===Literature===
Lord Byron uses doppelgänger imagery to explore the duality of human nature.

In &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Elixirs&quot; (1815), one of E. T. A. Hoffmann&#x27;s early novels, a man murders the brother and stepmother of his beloved princess, finds his doppelgänger has been sentenced to death for these crimes in his stead, and liberates him, only to have the doppelgänger murder the object of his affection.

In addition to describing the doppelgänger double as a counterpart to the self, Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s drama &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; (1820) makes reference to Zoroaster meeting &quot;his own image walking in the garden&quot;.

In Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s 1839 short story &quot;William Wilson&quot;, the main character is followed by a doppelgänger his whole life, with it troubling him and causing mischief. Eventually the main character kills his doppelgänger, and realizes that the doppelgänger was only mirroring him. First published in 1839, the story was also included in his 1840 &quot;Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque&quot;.

Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x27;s 1846 novel &quot;The Double&quot; presents the doppelgänger as an opposite personality who exploits the character failings of the protagonist to take over his life. Charles Williams&#x27; &quot;Descent into Hell&quot; (1939) has character Pauline Anstruther seeing her own doppelgänger all through her life. Clive Barker&#x27;s story &quot;Human Remains&quot; in his &quot;Books of Blood&quot; is a doppelgänger tale, and the doppelgänger motif is a staple of Gothic fiction.

In Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s 1936 novel &quot;Despair&quot;, the narrator and protagonist, Hermann Karlovich, meets a homeless man in Prague, who he believes is his doppelgänger.

Jorge Luis Borges&#x27; &quot;The Other&quot; (1972) has the author himself find that he&#x27;s sitting on a bench with his older doppelgänger, and the two have a conversation.

In Bret Easton Ellis&#x27;s novel, &quot;Glamorama&quot; (1998), protagonist actor–model Victor Ward ostensibly has a doppelgänger that people mistake for Ward, often claiming to have seen him at parties and events Ward has no recollection of attending. At one point in the novel, Victor heads to Europe but reports of him attending events in the states appear in newspaper headlines. Victor&#x27;s doppelgänger may have been placed by Victor&#x27;s father, a United States senator looking to present a more intelligent and sophisticated replacement for his son that would improve his own image and boost his poll numbers for future elections. While the novel is narrated by Victor, various chapters are ambiguous, leading the reader to wonder if certain chapters are being narrated by the doppelgänger instead.

In Stephen King&#x27;s book &quot;The Outsider&quot; (2018), the antagonist is able to use the DNA of individuals to become their near-perfect match through a science-fictional ability to transform physically. The allusion to it being a doppelgänger is made by the group trying to stop it from killing again. The group also discusses other examples of fictional doppelgängers that supposedly occurred throughout history to provide some context.

==In non-fiction==
The idea of having a doppelganger is central theme in Naomi Klein&#x27;s 2023 memoir and political analysis &quot;&quot;. In it, Klein examines the current climate of political polarization and conspiracy thinking by contrasting Klein&#x27;s worldview with that of Naomi Wolf, for whom Klein is often confused.

==Scientific applications==
Research has found that people who are &quot;true&quot; look-alikes have more similar genes than people who do not look like each other. They share genes affecting not only the face but also some phenotypes of physique and behavior, also indicating that (their) differences in the epigenome and microbiome contribute only modestly to human variability in facial appearance.

Heautoscopy is a term used in psychiatry and neurology for the hallucination of &quot;seeing one&#x27;s own body at a distance&quot;. It can occur as a symptom in schizophrenia and epilepsy, and is considered a possible explanation for doppelgänger phenomena.

Criminologists find a practical application in the concepts of facial familiarity and similarity due to the instances of wrongful convictions based on eyewitness testimony. In one case, a person spent 17 years behind bars persistently denying any involvement with the crime of which he was accused. He was finally released after someone was found who shared a striking resemblance and the same first name.

In 1914, Otto Rank began to study the concept of the Doppelgänger and its potential in psychoanalysis. Later, in 1919, Sigmund Freud would expand on the psychoanalytical value of Doppelgängers in his work &quot;The Uncanny&quot;. Freud explains that the Doppelgänger, or &#x27;the double,&#x27; is an idea rooted in the narcissism of children and is found in mirrors, guardian spirits, souls, and the thoughts of terror associated with death. The double begins as a comforting symbol of immortality, but it soon ends as a bringer of death. The Doppelgänger is also a manifestation of repressed thoughts related to the psychoanalytical concept of negation. The negation involved with the appearance of the Doppelgänger is used as a tool to map out an individual&#x27;s ego.

<doc id="143808" wikidata="Q7777174" url="?curid=143808" title="The whole nine yards">
<text>&quot;The whole nine yards&quot; or &quot;the full nine yards&quot; is a colloquial American English phrase meaning &quot;everything, the whole lot&quot; or, when used as an adjective, &quot;all the way&quot;. Its first usage was the punch line of an 1855 Indiana comedic short story titled &quot;The Judge&#x27;s Big Shirt&quot;.

The earliest known idiomatic use of the phrase is from 1907 in Southern Indiana. The phrase is related to the expression &quot;the whole six yards&quot;, used around the same time in Kentucky and South Carolina. Both phrases are variations on &quot;the whole ball of wax&quot;, first recorded in the 1880s. They are part of a family of expressions in which an odd-sounding item, such as &quot;enchilada&quot;, &quot;shooting match&quot;, &quot;shebang&quot; or &quot;hog&quot;, is substituted for &quot;ball of wax&quot;. The choice of the number nine may be related to the expression &quot;To the nines&quot; (to perfection). Use of the phrase became widespread in the 1980s and 1990s. Much of the interest in the phrase&#x27;s etymology can be attributed to &quot;New York Times&quot; language columnist William Safire, who wrote extensively on this question.

==History of the phrase==

=== Origin ===

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; places the earliest published non-idiomatic use of the phrase in the &quot;New Albany Daily Ledger&quot; (New Albany, Indiana, January 30, 1855) in a comedic short story titled &quot;The Judge&#x27;s Big Shirt.&quot;

The humorous anecdote follows Judge A., who regularly neglected packing a second shirt during his travels. He arrives in Raleigh, North Carolina, as part of a business trip. While hoping to find a shirt to borrow, he hints to his lawyer friend (Mr. C.) that he needs one in order to attend a prominent party the following evening. (The narrator clarifies that ready-made shirts were not purchasable &quot;in those days&quot;, likely setting the story in the early 19th or late 18th century.) To teach Judge A. a lesson, Mr. C. specifically orders a comically large shirt and promises to have it delivered before the party. Minutes before their departure, the shirt arrives; Judge A. initially praises the craftsmanship, then struggles to pull it on, until he &quot;[finds] himself enshrouded in a shirt five yards long and four yards broad&quot;. He is unable to see beyond the collar and expresses his astonishment at the &quot;monstrous shirt&quot;.

At the punch line of the story, Mr. C pretends to be innocent of his prank and exclaims, &quot;What a silly, stupid woman! I told her to get just enough to make three shirts; instead of making three, she has put the whole nine yards into one shirt!&quot; Despite this, the Judge attends the party, stuffing the shirt into his undergarments. He is later forced to explain the story to his wife, after which the lawyer feels at liberty to share the story with friends.

=== Idiomatic usage ===

The first known use of the phrase as an idiom appears in &quot;The Mitchell Commercial&quot;, a newspaper in the small town of Mitchell, Indiana, in its May 2, 1907, edition:

This afternoon at 2:30 will be called one of the baseball games that will be worth going a long way to see. The regular nine is going to play the business men as many innings as they can stand, but we can not promise the full nine yards.

The idiom was used three more times in the &quot;Mitchell Commercial&quot; over the next seven years, in the forms &quot;give him the whole nine yards&quot; (i.e., tell someone a big story), &quot;take the whole nine yards&quot; (i.e., take everything), and &quot;settled the whole nine yards&quot; (i.e., resolved everything).

In other uses from this time period, the phrase was given as &quot;the whole six yards&quot;. In 1912, a local newspaper in Kentucky asked readers to, &quot;Just wait boys until the fix gets to a fever heat and they will tell the whole six yards.&quot; The same newspaper repeated the phrase soon afterward in another issue, stating &quot;As we have been gone for a few days and failed to get all the news for this issue we will give you the whole six yards in our next.&quot; The six-yard form of the phrase also appears in a 1917 Arkansas paper (&quot;...he may write me personally and I&#x27;ll give him the whole six yards.&quot;); a South Carolina newspaper headline;, in a Lawrenceville, Georgia newspaper in 1922, and in the text of a 1927 Missouri paper (&quot;we heard the whole six yards--where did you lose your letter?&quot;).

Post-war usages of &quot;the whole/full nine yards&quot; have been found between 1946 and 1951 in a Lexington, Kentucky newspaper and in a 1956 issue of &quot;Kentucky Happy Hunting Ground&quot;, where it appears in an article on fishing. After describing the contests and prizes, the author writes, &quot;So that&#x27;s the whole nine-yards.&quot; It appeared in an article on hunting the following year, this time unhyphenated.

In a short story published in 1962, the phrase is attributed to &quot;a brush salesman&quot;. A letter published in an auto magazine later that year describes a certain new car as containing &quot;all nine yards of goodies&quot;. In 1964, several newspapers published a syndicated story which explained that &quot;Give &#x27;em the whole nine yards&quot; was NASA talk for an item-by-item report. This early usage can be read as suggesting length, but can also be read as suggesting detailed completeness.

Two 1965 newspaper articles quote U.S. military personnel serving in Vietnam using the phrase. The phrase was explained as something &quot;teenagers say&quot; in a military-oriented magazine in 1965. Citations from 1966 show the phrase was used by a former U.S. Army airman, and also in a publication for military test pilots. It is also recorded in two contemporary novels concerning the U.S. Air Force in Vietnam, Carl Krueger&#x27;s &quot;Wings of a Tiger&quot; (1966), and Elaine Shepard&#x27;s &quot;The Doom Pussy&quot; (1967).

==Research==
William Safire, a language columnist at the &quot;New York Times&quot;, asked listeners for information regarding the origin of the phrase on Larry King&#x27;s radio show in 1982. Safire ended up writing nine columns on this subject and is largely responsible for the interest in it. In 1986, the phrase was added to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; with the earliest citation given as 1970. &quot;The Historical Dictionary of American Slang&quot; (1997) cited Shepard&#x27;s novel, thus pushing the earliest known usage back to 1967. 

Yale University librarian Fred R. Shapiro described it as &quot;the most prominent etymological riddle of our time&quot;. 

Several key discoveries in further antedating the phrase were made by Bonnie Taylor-Blake, a neuroscience researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and an amateur member of the American Dialect Society, an association of professional and amateur linguists whose mailing list often serves as a forum for word and phrase discoveries. In 2012, Taylor-Blake discovered the 1956 and 1957 uses in &quot;Kentucky Happy Hunting Ground&quot;, and later that year she and Fred R. Shapiro found the &quot;whole six yards&quot; examples from the 1912–1921 period, which received substantial publicity. In 2013, Taylor-Blake posted her discovery of the &quot;Mitchell Commercial&quot; uses from the 1907–1914 period.

==Origin==
There is still no consensus on the origin, though many early published quotations are now available for study. A vast number of explanations for this phrase have been suggested; however many of these are no longer viable in light of what is now known about the phrase&#x27;s history. 
* Many of the popular candidates relate to the length of pieces of fabric, or various garments, including Indian saris, Scottish kilts, burial shrouds, or bolts of cloth. No single source verifies that any one of those suggestions was the actual origin. However, an article published in &quot;Comments on Etymology&quot; demonstrates that fabric was routinely sold in standard lengths of nine yards (and other multiples of three yards) during the 1800s and early 1900s. This may explain why so many different types of cloth or garments have been said to have been nine yards long. The phrase &quot;...she has put the whole nine yards into one shirt&quot; appears in 1855.
* One explanation is that World War II (1939–1945) aircraft machine gun belts were nine yards long. There are many versions of this explanation with variations regarding type of plane, nationality of gunner and geographic area. An alternative weapon is the ammunition belt for the British Vickers machine gun, invented and adopted by the British Army before World War I (1914–1918). The standard belt for this gun held 250 rounds of ammunition and was approximately twenty feet (6⅔ yards) in length. However, the Vickers gun as fitted to aircraft during the First World War usually had ammunition containers capable of accommodating linked belts of 350-400 rounds, the average length of such a belt being about nine yards, and it was thought that this may be the origin of the phrase. This theory is no longer considered viable, since the phrase predates World War I.
* Another common explanation is that &quot;nine yards&quot; is a cubic measure and refers to the volume of a concrete mixer. This theory, too, is inconsistent with the phrase&#x27;s history.
* Other proposed sources include the volume of graves; ritual disembowelment; shipyards; and American football. Little documentary evidence has surfaced to support any of these explanations.
* One proposed origin involves the world of full-rigged sailing ships, in which yard is used not as a measure of length or size, but as the name of each horizontal spar on which a sail is hung. All square-rigged sails unfurled, with 3 yards on each of 3 masts, could then be described as &quot;the whole nine yards&quot;, but again no actual documentation has been uncovered to support this explanation, and in any case not all ships had exactly three yards on each mast, even disregarding the fact that by no means all sailing vessels were three-masters.
* Bonnie Taylor-Blake, noting that several early examples are in the form &quot;give&quot; or &quot;tell&quot; the whole nine (or six) yards, has suggested that the idiom likely relied on &quot;yards&quot; as &quot;lengthy or thorough presentation [of news, anecdotes, play-by-play, etc.]&quot;
* Jesse Sheidlower, editor-at-large for the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, and Fred R. Shapiro have argued that the phrase does not have a concrete meaning, pointing to the variance between six and nine yards and comparing it to &quot;the whole shebang&quot;.

<doc id="143809" wikidata="Q106506" url="?curid=143809" title="The Fifth Element">
<text>The Fifth Element is a 1997 English-language French science-fiction action film conceived and directed by Luc Besson, and co-written by Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. It stars Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, Gary Oldman, Ian Holm, and Chris Tucker. Primarily set in the 23rd century, the film&#x27;s central plot involves the survival of planet Earth, which becomes the responsibility of Korben Dallas (Willis), a taxicab driver and former special forces major, after a young woman (Jovovich) falls into his cab. To accomplish this, Dallas joins forces with her to recover four mystical stones essential for the defence of Earth against the impending attack of a malevolent cosmic entity.

Besson started writing the story that was developed as &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; when he was 16 years old; he was 38 when the film opened in cinemas. Besson wanted to shoot the film in France, but suitable facilities could not be found; filming took place in London and Mauritania, instead. He hired comic artists Jean &quot;Moebius&quot; Giraud and Jean-Claude Mézières, whose books inspired parts of the film, for production design. Costume design was by Jean Paul Gaultier.

&quot;The Fifth Element&quot; received mainly positive reviews, although some critics were highly negative. The film won in categories at the British Academy Film Awards, the César Awards, the Cannes Film Festival, and the Lumières Awards, but also received nominations at the Golden Raspberry and Stinkers Bad Movie Awards. &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; was a strong financial success, earning more than US$263million at the box office on a $90-million budget. At the time of its release, it was the most expensive European film ever made, and it remained the highest-grossing French film at the international box office until the release of &quot;The Intouchables&quot; in 2011.

==Plot==
In 1914, aliens known as Mondoshawans meet their contact on Earth, a priest of a secret order, at an ancient Egyptian temple. They take the only weapon capable of defeating a great evil that appears every 5000 years, promising to protect it and return it before the great evil&#x27;s re-emergence. The weapon consists of the four classical elements, as four engraved stones, plus a sarcophagus containing a &quot;fifth element&quot;.

In the 23rd century, the great evil appears in deep space as a giant living fireball. It destroys an armed Earth spaceship as it heads to Earth. The Mondoshawans&#x27; current human contact on Earth, priest Vito Cornelius, informs the president of the Federated Territories of the great evil&#x27;s history and the weapon that can stop it.

On their way to Earth, a Mondoshawan spacecraft carrying the weapon is ambushed and destroyed by a crew of Mangalores, alien mercenaries hired by Earth industrialist Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg, who is working for the great evil. A severed hand in metal armor from the wreckage of the spacecraft is brought to New York City. From this, the government uses biotechnology to recreate the original occupant of the sarcophagus, a humanoid woman named Leeloo, who remembers her previous life. Alarmed by the unfamiliar surroundings and high security, she escapes and jumps off a ledge, crashing into the flying taxicab of Korben Dallas, a former major in Earth&#x27;s special forces.

Dallas delivers Leeloo to Cornelius and his apprentice, David, who recognizes her as the fifth element. As Leeloo recuperates, she tells Cornelius that the stones were not on board the Mondoshawan ship. Simultaneously, the Mondoshawans inform Earth&#x27;s government that the stones were entrusted to an alien opera singer, the diva Plavalaguna. Zorg reneges on his deal with the Mangalores for failing to obtain the stones, and kills some of them. Earth&#x27;s military sends Dallas to meet Plavalaguna; a rigged radio contest provides a cover, awarding Dallas a luxury vacation aboard a flying hotel on planet Fhloston, accompanied by flamboyant talk-show host Ruby Rhod. It includes a concert by Plavalaguna, and learning that Leeloo shares his mission, Dallas lets her accompany him. Cornelius instructs David to prepare the temple, then stows away on the luxury spaceship. The Mangalore crew, pursuing the stones for themselves, also illegally board the ship.

During the concert, the Mangalores attack, and Plavalaguna is killed. Dallas extracts the stones from her body and kills the Mangalore leader, causing the others to surrender. Zorg arrives, shoots Leeloo, and activates a time bomb. He flees with a carrying case he presumes contains the stones, but returns when he discovers it is empty. As Zorg’s bomb causes the hotel’s evacuation, Dallas finds Leeloo traumatized and escapes with her, Cornelius, Rhod, and the stones in Zorg&#x27;s private spaceship. Zorg deactivates his bomb, but a dying Mangalore sets off his own, destroying the hotel and killing Zorg.

As the great evil approaches Earth, the four meet David at the temple. They deploy the stones, but Leeloo, having learned of humanity&#x27;s history of cruelty, has given up on life. Dallas declares his love for her and kisses her. Leeloo combines the power of the stones, emitting divine light onto the great evil and defeating it. Dallas and Leeloo are hailed as heroes, and as dignitaries wait to greet them, the two passionately embrace in a recovery chamber.

==Cast==
==Themes==
In an interview, Besson stated, &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; was not a &quot;big theme movie&quot;, although the film&#x27;s theme was an important one. He wanted viewers to reach the point where Leeloo states, &quot;What&#x27;s the use of saving life when you see what you do with it?&quot; and agree with her. Jay P. Telotte, writing in the book &quot;Science Fiction Film&quot;, credited the film with exploring the theme of political corruption.

Brian Ott and Eric Aoki writing in the feminist journal &quot;Women&#x27;s Studies in Communication&quot; considered gender to be one of the film&#x27;s central themes. The authors criticized the film for erasing women from the introductory scenes, noting that only two appear in the first 20 minutes: an androgynous, mostly speechless presidential aide and Leeloo, undergoing reconstruction. When females appear in the film, they are presented as passive objects, such as the sexualised flight and McDonald&#x27;s attendants, or stripped of their femininity, such as the &quot;butch&quot; Major Iceborg.

Stefan Brandt, in the book &quot;Subverting Masculinity&quot;, also said that the film &quot;echoes stereotypical beliefs about gender&quot; of all females in the film. He said that Leeloo left her passive role only during her fight with the Mangalores. Except for Tiny Lister&#x27;s portrayal of the president, Brandt said that all males in the film were shown as unmanly as possible in various ways, such as Ruby Rhod&#x27;s effeminacy, Vito Cornelius&#x27;s clumsy form of speech, and General Munro&#x27;s stupidity; their purpose was to make Korben&#x27;s masculinity appear &quot;god-like&quot; by comparison.

In the book &quot;The Films of Luc Besson&quot;, Susan Hayward considered &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; to be a classic story of a man &quot;making his break from the tribe, proving his manhood, overthrowing the malevolent forces, and killing the chief, finally to reap the rewards of security and marriage&quot;. Korben&#x27;s journey, however, is threatened not only by the Mangalores and Zorg, but also by Leeloo, who does not relent or help him until the last minute, when she accepts his declaration of love. The love story within &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; was considered one of the main narratives in the film, and it faces the same deadline as the main storyline. Hayward also considered the film to grapple with environmental damage, in so far as waste and pollution are visible throughout the film. Whereas science-fiction films often show a world wherein some new technology or threat either surpasses or fails humanity, &quot;The Films of Luc Besson&quot; included &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; among the minority of science-fiction films that &quot;hold up a mirror&quot; and show humankind as responsible. Hayward said the film was skeptical of capitalist consumerism, in so far as the gadgets Zorg collected in his office suggested that he had an unhealthy obsession for technology. The tension between technology and man is treated as a problem requiring a final resolution.

==Production==
===Development===
As a teenager, Besson envisioned the world of &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; in an attempt to alleviate boredom. He began writing the script when he was 16, originally envisioning the story as a novel, though the film was not released in cinemas until he was 38. The original story was set in the year 2300 and was about a &quot;nobody&quot; named Zaltman Bleros (later renamed Korben Dallas), who wins a trip to the Club Med resort on the planet Fhloston Paradise in the Angel constellation. There, he meets Leeloo, a &quot;sand-girl&quot; who has the &quot;beauty of youth&quot; despite being over 2,000 years old.

Besson continued to work on the story for years. By 1991, when his documentary film &quot;Atlantis&quot; was released, he had a 400-page script. Nicolas Seydoux and Patrice Ledoux from Gaumont were the first people to take on the project. In November 1991, while seeking actors for the film, Besson met French comic creators Jean Giraud and Jean-Claude Mézières and recruited them for the film&#x27;s production design. Giraud and Mézières&#x27;s comics inspired the look that Besson wanted for his futuristic New York City.

===Designs===
Mézières had designed &quot;The Circles of Power&quot; (1994), which contains a character named S&#x27;Traks, who drives a flying taxicab through the congested air of the vast metropolis on the planet Rubanis. Mézières showed images of the flying taxi to Besson, who was inspired to change Korben Dallas&#x27; background from a worker in a rocket-ship factory to a taxi driver who flies his cab around a Rubanis-inspired futuristic New York City. Besson&#x27;s production also hired five other artists for the project. In addition, noted fashion designer Jean Paul Gaultier was hired to create the costumes. The team spent a year creating more than 8,000 drawings.

===Casting===
During this time, Besson approached both Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson for the lead role, and also considered Julia Roberts for Leeloo. Willis expressed interest, though he was reluctant to take on the role as the film was considered risky after his previous two films, &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot; and &quot;Billy Bathgate&quot;, had been poorly received. Gibson eventually turned down the role. While the production team impressed film companies with their designs, they struggled to find one willing to take on a budget approaching nearly $100million. In December 1992, production stopped without any prior warning, and the team disbanded.
Besson wrote and directed the commercially successful &quot;Léon: The Professional&quot; (1994). During that period, he continued to work on the script for &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, shortening it. He reduced the film&#x27;s budget to $90million before again attempting to find a studio willing to produce it. Columbia Pictures, which had a partnership in &quot;Leon&quot;, agreed to finance the film. By this time, Besson had decided to go with a lesser-known lead actor to save on production costs. Besson happened to be in Barry Josephson&#x27;s office when Willis called regarding a different film. Besson asked to speak to Willis &quot;just to say hello&quot; and told him that &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; was finally going ahead, explaining his decision to go with a less-expensive actor. After a short silence, Willis said, &quot;If I like the film, we can always come to an arrangement.&quot; After reading the script, Willis agreed to take on the role.

===Filming===
Production began in early August 1995. Besson traveled to various places for casting, including Paris, London, and Rome. He hired Gary Oldman (who had starred in &quot;Léon&quot;) for the role of Zorg, describing Oldman as &quot;one of the top-five actors in the world&quot;.

For the character Leeloo, Besson chose Milla Jovovich from the 200–300 applicants he met in person. The &quot;Divine Language&quot; spoken by Leeloo is a fictional language of 400 words, invented by Besson. To practice, Jovovich and Besson held conversations and exchanged letters in the language. Besson was then married to Maïwenn le Besco, who played the role of the Diva Plavalaguna when filming began. He left her to take up with Jovovich during filming. Jovovich and Besson later married but divorced two years later in 1999.

Although he wanted to shoot in France, Besson was unable to find suitable facilities, so filmed in London. It was primarily filmed at Pinewood Studios on seven soundstages including the 007 Stage. Construction of sets began in October 1995. The opera scene was filmed at the Royal Opera House. Scenes depicted as being in Egypt were filmed in Mauritania; the first shoot, a background shot of the desert, occurred there on 5 January 1996. Filming with actors began in late January, and was completed 21 weeks later. Willis finished filming on 16 May, while Oldman only commenced filming the following week; the protagonist (Korben) and antagonist (Zorg) never actually share any screen time. Despite being filmed in London, &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; was a French production, the costliest European film ever made at the time.

The New York designs were derived from both metabolist-inspired masses of modular apartments from the 1960s and the futuristic designs of architect Antonio Sant&#x27;Elia in the 1910s. Besson demanded that most of the action shots take place in broad daylight, as he was reportedly tired of the dark spaceship corridors and dimly lit planets common in science-fiction films, and wanted a brighter, &quot;cheerfully crazy&quot; look as opposed to a gloomy, realistic one.

Gaultier designed each of the 900 costumes worn by extras in the Fhloston Paradise scenes and checked each costume every morning. His designs, described as &quot;intellectually transgressive&quot;, were said to challenge sexuality and gender norms. A single jacket he designed cost $5,000. Jovovich&#x27;s costume worn from when her character was first revived was inspired by typical hospital dressing and bandages that provided minimal modesty.

The original name of the character Ruby Rhod was Loc Rhod, which appears both in the original script and in the novel adapted from the film. Hayward speculated that the name change was a play on data in the periodic table. Rubidium is the first of the period 5 elements, and exactly halfway along that row is the element rhodium. Using the first half of each element yields &quot;Rubi Rhod&quot;. Others have speculated this name is a play on the character&#x27;s gender-bending persona, with a feminine first name and phallic surname. Musician Prince was originally cast to portray Rhod, but could not schedule filming around his Jam of the Year World Tour dates. Chris Tucker and Jamie Foxx were each considered for the role; Besson liked Foxx, but felt that Tucker&#x27;s smaller body suited the character better.

===Effects===
Three different teams handled the three different types of special effects used. Nick Allder directed mechanical and pyrotechnical effects, Nick Dudman was placed in charge of &#x27;creature&#x27; effects, and Mark Stetson headed the visual-effects team. Visual effects company Digital Domain was hired, and Karen Goulekas was given the role of digital-effects supervisor. Alias, Autodesk Softimage, Arete, Side Effect&#x27;s Prisms, RenderMan, and in-house software were used by Digital Domain to create effects. Some individual shots used a combination of live action, scale models, computer-generated imagery, and particle systems. The lanes of traffic in the New York City scenes were created with particle systems:
Among the scale models used for filming were the buildings representing New York City. Dozens of apartment blocks and 25 skyscrapers, some high, were constructed in scale. It took a team of 80 workers five months to build all the models. The windows of the buildings were cited by the team as one of the most time-consuming tasks, along with details behind the windows, such as furniture, blinds, lightboxes, and tiny pieces of flat artwork. Virtual sets built within digital environments were created to enhance the use of miniatures. Motion-control cameras moved throughout the scale sets, and the data they collected were exported to track and generate the computer animation and particle systems. Other techniques used included digital matte paintings for backgrounds and the NURBS mathematical model for certain animations, including the sequence in which Leeloo&#x27;s body is reconstructed.

===Music===
In &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, some kind of music is playing during about 90% of the film; Besson&#x27;s films have been described as &quot;intrinsically musical&quot;. The score was composed by Éric Serra. He relies chiefly on the use of orchestral textures, such as the oboe and strings heard as the surgeons prepare to regenerate Leeloo, and the as she is reconstructed. Serra also used many non-French influences, such as the Stalinist fanfare heard before the spaceport sequence, the reggae piece played in preparation for the flight, and the hula music that greets the passengers as they arrive in Fhloston. More conventional scoring techniques are present in the leitmotif that first sounds when Professor Pacoli mentions the fifth element, the militaristic snares as the warship prepares to attack the dark planet, and the Mahlerian funereal piece heard when Leeloo learns about war. The music used for the taxicab chase scene, titled &quot;Alech Taadi&quot; by Algerian performer Khaled, did not appear on the film soundtrack but is available on Khaled&#x27;s album &quot;N&#x27;ssi N&#x27;ssi&quot;.

The Diva Dance opera performance used music from Gaetano Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;: &quot;Il dolce suono&quot;, the mad scene of Act III, Scene 2. It is one of the few pieces of music in the film that is diegetic. It was sung by Albanian soprano Inva Mula. The role of Plavalaguna was played by French actress Maïwenn Le Besco. Part One (titled &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;) and Part Two (titled &quot;The Diva Dance&quot;) of this piece are included as separate tracks on &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; soundtrack, but are sequenced to create the effect of the entire performance seen in the film. The end of Part One blends into the beginning of Part Two, creating a smooth transition between the two tracks.

====Soundtrack====
Released as an album under Virgin Records, the soundtrack peaked at number 99 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 44 in Canada. More than 200,000 copies of the lengthy soundtrack were sold in France alone. Rodney Batdorf of AllMusic gave the album three out of five stars, stating it was &quot;diverse and accomplished, and it is just as effective outside of the film as it is within it.&quot;

==Release and reception==
===Initial screening===
The film premiered on 7 May at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival, where it was selected as the opening film. Gaumont built an area for the screening that was over . Guests were given a &quot;Fifth Element&quot; Swatch, which was used as their ticket for entry. The event included a futuristic ballet, a fashion show by Jean Paul Gaultier, and fireworks. Gaumont spent between $1million and $3million on the event, a record at the time. The film&#x27;s North American release was handled by Sony Pictures Releasing via its Columbia Pictures label.

===Box office===
The film debuted at number one in France, grossing 55 million Francs ($10 million) in its opening week from 527 screens and 1.81 million admissions, setting a record opening for a French film and the second-biggest opening in the country after &quot;Independence Day&quot;. It remained at number one for seven weeks. It also opened at number one in the United States, grossing $17million on its opening weekend and remained there the following weekend. It was a box-office success, grossing over $263million, almost three times its budget of $90million. About 75% of the receipts for &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; were from markets outside the United States, and it was the ninth-highest-grossing film of the year worldwide. It was the highest-grossing film at the box office in France, from 7.7 million admissions, a record it held for 16 years until the release of &quot;The Intouchables&quot; in 2011. In Germany, the film was awarded the Goldene Leinwand, a sales certification award for selling more than three million tickets at the box office.

===Critical response===
Critics were divided in their response to &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the film as an &quot;elaborate, even campy sci-fi extravaganza, which is nearly as hard to follow as last year&#x27;s &quot;.&quot;&quot; He concluded, &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; was &quot;a lot warmer, more fun, and boasts some of the most sophisticated, witty production and costume design you could ever hope to see.&quot; On the American film review &quot;At the Movies&quot;, both Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel gave the film a &quot;thumbs up&quot;. In his separate review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, calling it &quot;one of the great goofy movies&quot; and concluding, &quot;I would not have missed seeing this film, and I recommend it for its richness of imagery. But at 127 minutes, which seems a reasonable length, it plays long.&quot;

The film also received reviews that criticized its overblown style. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;A largely misfired European attempt to make an American-style sci-fi spectacular, &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; consists of a hodgepodge of elements that don&#x27;t comfortably coalesce.&quot; David Edelstein of &quot;Slate&quot; said, &quot;It may or may not be the worst movie ever made, but it is one of the most unhinged.&quot; Bruce Willis dismissed critical reviews of the film, believing they would have no impact on the film&#x27;s success.

Chris Tucker&#x27;s performance as Ruby Rhod also divided critics. He was praised in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;; the latter called him &quot;the summer&#x27;s most outrageous special effect&quot;. Josh Winning of &quot;Total Film&quot; singled out Tucker&#x27;s performance as the low point of the film, ranking it as number 20 on his 2011 list, &quot;50 Performances That Ruined Movies&quot;.

&quot;The Fifth Element&quot; holds a approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on reviews, with an average score of . The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Visually inventive and gleefully over the top, Luc Besson&#x27;s &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; is a fantastic piece of pop sci-fi that never takes itself too seriously.&quot; At Metacritic, it has a weighted score of 52 outof 100 based on reviews from 22 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

===Plagiarism suit===
Alejandro Jodorowsky and Jean Giraud sued Besson after the film was released, claiming &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; had plagiarised their comic &quot;The Incal&quot;. Giraud sued for 13.1million euros for unfair competition, 9million euros in damages and interest, and two to five percent of the net operating revenues of the film. Jodorowsky sued for 700,000 euros. The case was dismissed in 2004 on the grounds that only &quot;tiny fragments&quot; of the comic had been used and Giraud had been hired by Besson to work on the film before the allegations were made.

==Adaptations==
A novel was adapted from the screenplay of &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, written by Terry Bisson and published by HarperPrism in 1997. Rumors arose after the film&#x27;s release that it would be followed by a sequel, tentatively titled &quot;Mr. Shadow&quot;. In 2011, Besson said that he never planned a sequel and has no desire to make one.

Gaumont Multimedia commissioned developer Kalisto Entertainment to develop a video-game adaptation of &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; in 1998 for the PlayStation game console and PC. The PlayStation version generally received negative reviews, but the PC version was better received. Lauren Fielder from &quot;GameSpot&quot; described the PlayStation version as &quot;quite possibly the worst game I&#x27;ve ever played&quot;. Doug Perry from &quot;IGN&quot; wrote: &quot;Take &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, add in Leeloo Multipass and boring puzzles, and you&#x27;ve got &quot;Fifth Element&quot;.&quot;

A racing game based on the film, &quot;New York Race&quot;, was released in 2001. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; gave the game 6 outof 10, concluding: &quot;&quot;New York Race&quot; is a fun little arcade racer, which oozes style, but it&#x27;s something you&#x27;ll grow tired of extremely quickly and as such remains fun only in short bursts.&quot;

==Accolades==
&quot;The Fifth Element&quot; was nominated for Best Sound Editing at the 70th Academy Awards, and for Best Sound Editing at the 1998 Golden Reel Awards, but lost to &quot;Titanic&quot; in both cases. It won the BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects, and the Lumières Award for Best Director. It was nominated for seven César awards, winning three: Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Production Design. It was nominated for Film of the Year at the 1997 European Film Awards, as well as the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, and the Satellite Award for Best Visual Effects. Thierry Arbogast was awarded the Technical Grand Prize at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival for his work on both &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s So Lovely&quot;. The film received four Saturn Award nominations: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Costume, Best Special Effects, and Best Supporting Actress for Milla Jovovich. Jovovich&#x27;s fight against the Mangalores was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Fight, and the actress was also nominated for Best ActressNewcomer at the Blockbuster Entertainment Awards.

Conversely, Jovovich received a Golden Raspberry nomination for Worst Supporting Actress, and Chris Tucker was nominated for Worst New Star for his performances in both &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; and &quot;Money Talks&quot;. The film also received four nominations at the 1997 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards: Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Supporting Actor for Tucker, and Worst Supporting Actress for Jovovich.
==Home media==
The original home video release of &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; took place in North America on 10 December 1997, on VHS, LaserDisc, and DVD. The original DVD presented the film in its original 2.39:1 anamorphic widescreen format, though carried no special features. The film was released in Sony&#x27;s Superbit format in October 2001. In his review, Conrad Jeremy from &quot;IGN&quot; gave the picture quality of the original DVD release 9 outof 10, though awarded the Superbit version a perfect score for picture quality. Overall, the Superbit version was given 8 outof 10; the final score was brought down by the version&#x27;s complete lack of special features.

An &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot; set of two DVDs was released on 11 January 2005. The only difference between the Superbit version and the Ultimate Edition disc one is the addition of a &quot;fact track&quot;, which when turned on displays trivia about the film, cast, and crew as the film plays. The second disc provides various special features, focusing on visual production, special effects, fashion in the film, featurettes, and interviews with Willis, Jovovich, and Tucker, as well as featurettes on the four different alien races in the film and Diva Plavalaguna. Ian Jane of &quot;DVD Talk&quot; praised the Ultimate Edition for its special features.

The first Blu-ray release of the film on 20 June 2006 was criticised as having poor picture quality by Blu-ray standards and for its lack of special features. In what has been called &quot;an extremely rare move&quot;, Sony responded to complaints by making a remastered Blu-ray version available, released on 17 July 2007, and also offered a replacement exchange program for customers unhappy with the original Blu-ray release. Ben Williams from Blu-ray.com stated the remastered version &quot;absolutely&quot; made up for the substandard initial release, and praised its high video and audio quality; however, he criticised the continued lack of special features.

The 20th-anniversary 4K remaster was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on 11 July 2017.

==Legacy==
The film has been described by CBS News, Rotten Tomatoes, and ComingSoon.com as a science-fiction cult classic. In 2007 the Visual Effects Society placed &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; at number 50, tied with &quot;Darby O&#x27;Gill and the Little People,&quot; on their list of the fifty most influential visual effects films of all time. In 2014 &quot;Time Out&quot; listed the film at number 42 on their &quot;100 best sci-fi movies&quot; list.

Film critic Mark Kermode reported that &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; was one of the most divisive films among his readers, regarded as both the best and the worst summer blockbuster of all time. Years later, Kermode recalled: &quot;I remember very clearly being in Cannes when &quot;[The] Fifth Element&quot; was first played, and it &quot;really&quot; divided the audience.&quot; Stephen Cass of &quot;Discover&quot; ranked the film the third-best science-fiction film on subscription service Hulu, writing, &quot;People seem to either like or loathe &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; ... Lavish visuals and entertaining performances from Bruce Willis, Milla Jovovich, and Gary Oldman make this movie worth watching.&quot; In some circles, the film has gained a &quot;so-bad-it&#x27;s-good&quot; status; Meredith Woerner of io9 listed &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; as one of &quot;The 20 Best Worst Science-Fiction Movies of All Time.&quot;

===Cast comments===
Willis spoke favourably of the film in a 1999 interview, concluding: &quot;It was a real fun movie to make.&quot; Tucker and Jovovich also spoke favourably of both their experiences making the film and working with Besson in interviews on the &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot; DVD; Jovovich described Besson as &quot;the first really amazing director I had worked with.&quot; Asked in a 2014 interview if he liked the film, Gary Oldman stated, &quot;Oh no. I can&#x27;t bear it.&quot; He had explained in 2011: &quot;It was me singing for my supper because Luc had come in and partly financed [my film] &quot;Nil by Mouth&quot;.&quot;

<text>César Antonovich Cui (; ; ; 26 March 1918) was a Russian composer and music critic, member of the Belyayev circle and The Five – a group of composers combined by the idea of creating a specifically Russian type of music. As an officer of the Imperial Russian Army, he rose to the rank of Engineer-General (equivalent to full General), taught fortifications in Russian military academies and wrote a number of monographs on the subject.

==Biography==
===Upbringing and career===
Cesarius-Benjaminus Cui was born in Wilno, Vilna Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Vilnius, Lithuania) into a Catholic family of French and Polish–Lithuanian descent, the youngest of five children. The original French spelling of his surname was &quot;Queuille.&quot; His French father, Antoine (Anton Leonardovich) Cui, entered Russia with Napoleon&#x27;s army; in 1812, he was injured during the battle near Smolensk and (following the defeat) would settle in Vilnius. He married local noblewoman Julia Gucewicz; some sources indicate that her father was the Lithuanian architect Laurynas Gucevičius.

The young César grew up learning French, Polish, Russian and Lithuanian. As a secondary school (gymnasium) student in Wilno, he took music lessons with Stanisław Moniuszko in 1850. Later that year, before completing his gymnasium education, Cui was sent to Saint Petersburg to prepare to enter the Chief Engineering School, which he did the following year at age 16. In 1855, he graduated from the academy; following advanced studies at the Nikolaevsky Engineering Academy (now Military Engineering-Technical University), he began his military career in 1857 as an instructor in fortifications. His students over the decades included several members of the Imperial family, most notably Nicholas II. Cui eventually ended up teaching at three of the military academies in Saint Petersburg. Cui&#x27;s study of fortifications gained from a frontline assignment during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 proved important to his career. As an expert on military fortifications, Cui eventually attained the academic rank of professor in 1880 and the military rank of general in 1906. His writings on fortifications included textbooks that were widely used, in several successive editions (see bibliography below).

===A vocational life in music===
Despite his achievements as a professional military academic, Cui is best known in the West for his &#x27;other&#x27; life in music. As a boy in Vilnius, he received piano lessons, studied Chopin&#x27;s works, and began composing little pieces at fourteen years of age. In the few months before he was sent to Petersburg, he managed to have some lessons in music theory with the Polish composer Stanisław Moniuszko, who was residing in Vilnius at the time. Cui&#x27;s musical direction changed in 1856, when he met Mily Balakirev and began to be more seriously involved with music.

Even though he was composing music and writing music criticism in his spare time, Cui turned out to be an extremely prolific composer and feuilletonist. His public &quot;debut&quot; as a composer occurred in 1859 with the performance of his orchestral Scherzo, Op. 1, under the baton of Anton Rubinstein and the auspices of the Russian Musical Society. In 1869, the first public performance of an opera by Cui took place, &quot;William Ratcliff&quot; (based on the tragedy by Heinrich Heine); it did not ultimately have success, partially because of the harshness of his own writings in the music press. All but one of his operas were composed to Russian texts; the one exception, &quot;Le flibustier&quot; (based on a play by Jean Richepin), premiered in 1894 at the Opéra-Comique in Paris (twenty-five years after &quot;Ratcliff&quot;), but it did not succeed either. Cui&#x27;s more successful stage works during his lifetime were the one-act comic opera &quot;The Mandarin&#x27;s Son&quot; (premiered publicly in 1878), the three-act &quot;The Prisoner of the Caucasus&quot; (1883) (based on Pushkin), and the one-act &quot;Mademoiselle Fifi&quot; (1903) (based on Guy de Maupassant). Besides &quot;Flibustier&quot;, the only other operas by Cui performed in his lifetime outside of the Russian Empire were &quot;The Prisoner of the Caucasus&quot; (in Liège, 1886; the first time any opera by The Five was performed outside Russia, but this was also its sole performance outside Russia) and the children&#x27;s opera &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; (in Rome, 1915). 

Cui&#x27;s activities in musical life also included membership on the opera selection committee at the Mariinsky Theatre; this stint ended in 1883, when both he and Rimsky-Korsakov left the committee in protest of its rejection of Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Khovanshchina&quot;. From 1896 to 1904, he was director of the Petersburg branch of the Russian Musical Society.

Among the many musicians Cui knew in his life, Franz Liszt looms large. His book, &quot;La musique en Russie&quot;, and his &quot;Suite pour piano&quot;, Op. 21, are dedicated to the elder composer. Cui&#x27;s &quot;Tarantelle&quot; for orchestra, Op. 12, formed the basis for Liszt&#x27;s last piano transcription. In addition, Liszt valued the music of Russian composers quite highly; for Cui&#x27;s opera &quot;William Ratcliff&quot;, he expressed some of the highest praise.

Two personalities of direct significance for Cui were women who were specially devoted to his music. In Belgium, the Comtesse de Mercy-Argenteau (1837–1890) was most influential in making possible the staging of &quot;The Prisoner of the Caucasus&quot; there in 1885. In Moscow, Mariya Kerzina, with her husband Arkadiy Kerzin, formed a performance society in 1896 called the Circle of Russian Music Lovers, which began in 1898 to give special place to works by Cui (among those of other Russian composers) in its concerts.

Throughout his rather long and active musical life, Cui won many accolades. In the late 1880s and early 1890s, several foreign musical societies honored Cui with memberships. Shortly after the staging of &quot;Le flibustier&quot; in Paris, Cui was elected as a correspondent member of the Académie Française and was awarded the cross of the Légion d&#x27;honneur. In 1896, he was made a member of the Belgian Royal Academy of Literature and Art. In 1909 and 1910, events were held in honor of Cui&#x27;s 50th anniversary as a composer.

===Family===

Cui married Malvina Rafailovna Bamberg ( ) in 1858. He had met her at the home of Alexander Dargomyzhsky, from whom she was taking singing lessons. Among the musical works Cui dedicated to her is the early Scherzo, Op. 1 (1857), which uses themes based on her maiden name (BAmBErG) and his own initials (C. C.), and the comic opera &quot;The Mandarin&#x27;s Son&quot;. César and Malvina had two children, Lidiya and Aleksandr. Lidiya, an amateur singer, married and had a son named Yuri Borisovich Amoretti; in the period before the October Revolution, Aleksandr was a member of the Russian Senate.

===Last years and death===
In 1916, Cui went blind, although he was still able to compose small pieces by means of dictation. He died on 26 March 1918 from cerebral apoplexy and was buried next to his wife Mal&#x27;vina (who had died in 1899) at the Smolensky Lutheran Cemetery in Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg). In 1939, his body was reinterred in Tikhvin Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, to lie beside the other members of The Five.

== Cui as a music critic ==
As a writer on music, Cui contributed almost 800 articles to various newspapers and other publications in Russia and Europe between 1864 and 1918 (he &quot;retired&quot; from regular music criticism in 1900). His wide coverage included concerts, recitals, musical life, new publications of music, and personalities. A significant number of his articles (ca. 300) dealt with opera. Several of his themed sets of articles were reissued as monographs; these covered topics as varied as the original 1876 production of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; in Bayreuth, the development of the Russian romance &quot;art song&quot;, music in Russia, and Anton Rubinstein&#x27;s seminal lectures on the history of piano music of 1888–1889 (see list of writings below). In addition, as indicated above as part of his profession, Cui also published many books and articles about military fortifications.

Because of rules related to his status in the Russian military, in the early years his musico-critical articles had to be published under a pseudonym, which consisted of three asterisks (***); in Petersburg musical circles, however, it became clear who was writing the articles. His musical reviews began in the &quot;St. Petersburg Vedomosti&quot;, expressing disdain for music before Beethoven (such as Mozart) and his advocacy of originality in music. Sarcasm was a regular feature of his feuilletons.

 Cui&#x27;s primary goal as a critic was to promote the music of contemporary Russian composers, especially the works of his now better-known co-members of The Five. Even they, however, were not spared negative reactions from him here and there, especially in his blistering review of the first production of Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; in 1874. Later in life, Cui championed the music of this late colleague of his to the point of making the first completion of Mussorgsky&#x27;s unfinished opera &quot;The Fair at Sorochyntsi&quot;.

Russian composers outside of The Five, however, were often more likely to produce a negative reaction. This derived at least partly from distrust of the Western-style conservatory system in favor of the autodidactic approach that The Five had practiced. For instance, Cui lambasted Tchaikovsky&#x27;s second performed opera, &quot;The Oprichnik&quot;, and his stinging remarks about Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Symphony No.1 are often cited; fortunately, both works have survived their unfavorable premieres for posterity.

Of Western composers, Cui favored Berlioz and Liszt as progressives. He admired Wagner&#x27;s aspirations concerning music drama, but did not agree with that composer&#x27;s methods to achieve them (such as the leitmotif system and the predominance of the orchestra).

Late in life, Cui&#x27;s presumed progressiveness (as espoused in the 1860s and &#x27;70s) faded, and he showed firm hostility towards the younger &quot;modernists&quot; such as Richard Strauss and Vincent d&#x27;Indy. Cui&#x27;s last published articles (from 1917) constituted merciless parodies, including the little song &quot;Hymn to Futurism&quot; and &quot;Concise Directions on How to Become a Modern Composer of Genius without Being a Musician&quot;.

== Cui as a composer ==


Cui composed in almost all genres of his time, with the distinct exceptions of the symphony, symphonic poem and the solo concerto (unlike his compatriots Balakirev, Borodin, Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov). Art songs, including many children&#x27;s songs and some vocal duets, have a prominent place in Cui&#x27;s catalogue. Several of his songs are available also in versions with orchestral accompaniment, including his &quot;Bolero&quot;, Op. 17, which was dedicated to the singer Marcella Sembrich. Some of his most famous art songs include &quot;The Statue at Tsarskoye Selo&quot; (&quot;Царскосельская статyя&quot;) and &quot;The Burnt Letter,&quot; (&quot;Сожжённое письмо&quot;), both based on poems by Cui&#x27;s most valued poet, Alexander Pushkin.

In addition, Cui wrote many works for piano and for chamber groups (including three string quartets), numerous choruses, and several orchestral works, but his most significant efforts are reflected in the operas, of which he composed fifteen of varying proportions. Besides children&#x27;s music (which includes four fairytale operas as well as the aforementioned songs), three other special categories of compositions stand out among his works: pieces inspired by and dedicated to the Comtesse de Mercy-Argenteau (whom the composer knew from 1885 to her death in 1890), works associated with the Circle of Russian Music Lovers (the &quot;Kerzin Circle&quot;), and pieces inspired by the Russo-Japanese War and World War I.

In the last few decades, &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; (from Perrault), one of the four children&#x27;s operas he composed, has gained wide appeal in Germany. Nevertheless, despite the fact that more of Cui&#x27;s music has been made available in recent years, both in recordings and in new printed editions, his status in today&#x27;s repertoire is considerably limited, based (in the West) primarily on some of his piano and chamber music (such as the violin and piano piece &quot;Orientale&quot; (op. 50, No. 9)) and a number of solo songs. His abilities as an orchestrator have been disparaged, notably by his compatriot Rimsky-Korsakov. The received wisdom is that he is not a particularly talented composer, at least for large forms; his strongest talent is said to lie in the crystallization of mood at an instant as captured in his art songs and instrumental miniatures.

Cui&#x27;s works are not so nationalistic as those of the other members of The Five; with the exception of Pushkin, his operas do not display a strong attraction to Russian sources. In the area of art song, however, the vast majority of Cui&#x27;s vocal music is based on Russian texts. Overt attempts at Russian &quot;folk&quot; musical style can be detected in passages from his first act of the collaborative &quot;Mlada&quot; (1872), &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, a couple of his children&#x27;s operas, and a few songs; many other passages in his music reflect the stylistic curiosities associated with Russian art music of the 19th century, such as whole-tone scales and certain harmonic devices. Nevertheless, his style is more often compared to Robert Schumann and to French composers such as Gounod than to Mikhail Glinka or to Cui&#x27;s Russian contemporaries.

<text>Three to Tango is a 1999 romantic comedy film directed by Damon Santostefano, written by Rodney Patrick Vaccaro and Aline Brosh McKenna, and starring Matthew Perry, Neve Campbell, Dylan McDermott and Oliver Platt.

== Plot ==
Architects Oscar Novak and Peter Steinberg have just landed a career-making opportunity to design a multimillion-dollar cultural center for wealthy businessman Charles Newman. In a ploy for publicity, Newman has pitched Oscar and Peter in a neck-and-neck competition with their archrivals and former colleagues, the hugely successful Decker and Strauss. When Newman meets Oscar and Peter, he assumes that they are lovers; Peter is gay, but Oscar is straight. Under the mistaken impression that Oscar is gay, he asks Oscar to keep an eye on his mistress Amy and make sure that she does not talk to his wife Olivia. Oscar falls for Amy virtually on sight, but she also thinks he is gay. He is forced to maintain the charade to avoid getting into trouble with Newman, and losing the commission.

Matters become complicated when a news article about Oscar and Peter&#x27;s supposed relationship is published in a newspaper, leaving Oscar in the increasingly frustrating position of having to fend off advances from various gay men while convincing his friends and family that he is simply &quot;pretending&quot; to be gay. Amy even sets him up on a date with her ex-boyfriend, football player Kevin Cartwright, but Oscar manages to defuse the situation by saying that he is in love with someone else. Despite the embarrassing misconceptions, Oscar forms a close bond with Amy as they continue to spend time together, to the extent that Amy moves in with him after she is kicked out of her apartment. At the final presentation for the cultural center, Oscar and Peter receive the commission, but Oscar is simultaneously told that he has won the award for Gay Professional Man of the Year, with Newman deciding that he will reveal his decision after the ceremony.

After an awkward meeting between Amy and Olivia at the party, she and Oscar go to a bar, Amy uncomfortable after meeting Olivia in person for the first time. Amy leaves in frustration after she nearly kisses him, prompting a brief argument between her and Oscar in which Oscar states that her relationship with Newman has no future; Amy and Newman have never fought only because Newman doesn&#x27;t care enough about Amy to fight with her, but Amy counters that Oscar is hardly in a position to criticise her love life when he hasn&#x27;t been on a date since they met. After spending the day alone, Oscar attends the award ceremony for Gay Professional Man of the Year. Although he initially continues his charade, while looking out at the people before him, he instead makes a passionate speech about how he admires all the men and women here who were able to tell the truth to their families about who they are, ending the speech by &quot;coming out of the closet&quot; as he admits that he is straight and in love with Amy. As he is applauded for having the courage to admit the truth, he runs after Amy, only for her to punch both him and Newman and storming out. Peter then awkwardly accepts the prize that comes with the award: a date with Kevin. However, as Oscar sits in a restaurant where he and Amy ate together on the night they met, Amy comes to see him. After confirming that there are no other lies and he genuinely regrets the deception, she says that she loves him too, and they kiss.

During the credit scene, Olivia convinces Newman to go with Oscar and Peter&#x27;s design, revealing that she knew about him and Amy and informing him bluntly that Oscar and Peter did the better job.

==Production==
In March 1998 it was announced Matthew Perry and Neve Campbell were in talks with Outlaw Productions and Warner Bros. to headline &quot;Three to Tango&quot; written by Rodney Patrick Vaccaro, with rewrites by Aileen Brosh. The film was slated to be the directorial debut of Damon Santostefano following dropping out of directing Tristar&#x27;s &quot;Idle Hands&quot;. &quot;Three to Tango&quot; was co-produced by Warner Bros. and Australia&#x27;s Village Roadshow Pictures Entertainment.

== Reception ==
 Roger Ebert praised Neve Campbell&#x27;s appeal but gave the film one star, saying it had &quot;an Idiot Plot, in which no one ever says what obviously must be said to clear up the confusion.&quot; Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden criticized the film for its predictability and use of gay clichés. &quot;In trying to be both bold and nonthreatening, the movie ends up seeming tame and mildly offensive.&quot;

The film fared poorly with audiences as well as critics. &quot;Three to Tango&quot; opened at #8 at the box office, bringing in $4.4 million on its opening weekend, and earning $10.6 million overall, against a budget of $20 million.

== Filming locations ==
Although &quot;Three to Tango&quot; is set in Chicago, it was filmed in Toronto, Ontario.

==Soundtrack==

A soundtrack of music &quot;from and inspired by&quot; &quot;Three to Tango&quot; was released by Atlantic Records on 26 October 1999. It featured new music by the Brian Setzer Orchestra, Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies, and Mighty Blue Kings, as well as previously released tracks by Squirrel Nut Zippers, Royal Crown Revue, and The Atomic Fireballs.

<text>Fools Rush In is a 1997 American romantic comedy film starring Matthew Perry and Salma Hayek, directed by Andy Tennant.

==Plot==
Alex Whitman, a New York City project manager aka architect, is sent to Las Vegas to supervise the construction of a nightclub that his firm has been hired to build. He is a strait-laced WASP-ish type and meets Isabel Fuentes, a free-spirited Mexican-American photographer. Alex and Isabel are immediately attracted to each other and spend the night together. In the morning, Isabel quietly slips away while Alex is still asleep.

Three months later, Isabel finds Alex to tell him she is pregnant with his child. She has decided to keep and raise the child alone, although it will disappoint her family. Isabel asks Alex to a family dinner so they can meet her baby&#x27;s father at least once. He agrees, and despite some cultural differences, he finds himself more attracted to Isabel. Though Isabel is prepared to say goodbye, Alex suggests they pursue a relationship.

Alex proposes, and they quickly marry at a Las Vegas wedding chapel, complete with an Elvis impersonator serving as a witness. However, they gradually both wonder if they belong together, especially as Alex struggles to balance his New York-based career with Isabel&#x27;s desire to stay in Nevada, near her family. Isabel father disowned her, when he found out Isabel is pregnant and eloped without her family and his consent.

In early June, when Alex is at his company&#x27;s head office, his boss tells him to return on July 1 for a new project and promotion. He secretly agrees to it, although he had promised Isabel they would not go until after the baby is born in October.

The newlyweds fight when Isabel finds out why Alex has been so busy and distant. Isabel suffers from a medical complication. While in the hospital, she lets Alex believe she lost the baby and says they&#x27;re not meant to be together.

Distraught, Alex returns to New York while Isabel, who is still pregnant, goes to Mexico to stay with her great-grandmother. After being served with divorce papers, he sees several &quot;signs&quot; such as a priest telling him to watch carefully for guidance, almost tripping over a chihuahua, seeing a photo of the Grand Canyon and finally a young Hispanic girl named Isabel cannot keep her eyes off him. Alex realizes he loves Isabel and wants her more than his career.

Alex travels to rural Mexico to find Isabel, unaware she is still pregnant. Her great-grandmother, who only speaks Spanish, reveals that Isabel loves Alex and is driving back to Las Vegas to have her baby (which he only understands as she has returned to Las Vegas). He intercepts her at the Hoover Dam and says he loves her, then realizes she is still pregnant.

Isabel suddenly goes into labor and gives birth to a daughter, which coincides with their divorce becoming finalized. Soon after, they remarry with both families present, atop a cliff overlooking the Grand Canyon.

<doc id="143815" wikidata="Q2188666" url="?curid=143815" title="This Perfect Day">
<text>This Perfect Day is a science fiction novel by American writer Ira Levin, about a technocratic dystopia. Levin won a Prometheus Award in 1992 for this novel. &quot;This Perfect Day&quot; is one of two Levin novels yet to be adapted to film (the other being &quot;Son of Rosemary&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;).

== Backstory ==
The world is managed by a central computer called UniComp (referred as just &quot;Uni&quot; in speech), which has been programmed to keep every single human on the surface of the Earth in check. People living under the &quot;Unification&quot; are continually drugged by means of monthly treatments (delivered via transdermal spray or jet injector) so that they will remain satisfied and co-operative &quot;Family members.&quot; They are told where to live, when to eat, whom to marry, when to reproduce, and the job for which they will be trained. Everyone is assigned a counselor, who acts somewhat like a mentor, confessor, and parole agent; violations against &quot;brothers&quot; and &quot;sisters&quot; by themselves and others are expected to be reported at a weekly confession.

Everyone wears a permanent identifying bracelet that interfaces with access points, which act as scanners. Uni uses them to tell &quot;Family members&quot; where they are allowed to go and what they are allowed to do. Around the age of 62, every person is humanely euthanized by Uni with an overdose of the treatment liquids; almost anything in them is poisonous if an excess dose is given. The general population believes that the elderly die of natural causes, and since some die at 61 or 63, no one is too suspicious of the regularity. The few who happen to be resistant to the drugs or purposely change their behavior to avoid strong doses of some of the drugs in the monthly treatment are dealt with by the programmers of UniComp. The long-lived men and women, in their underground hideaway, are the real but invisible world government. They live in absolute luxury and choose their own members through a form of meritocracy. In part, people who choose by evasion and modifying their own behavior to leave the main Family are subtly redirected to &quot;nature preserves&quot; of imperfect life on islands. They, however, have been put in place by the programmers as a place to isolate trouble-making Family members. The top minds in the outcasts are further manipulated into trying to overthrow the &quot;Programmers&quot; and the ones who nearly succeeded are forced to join the programmers to &quot;help them maintain the equilibrium&quot; in the &quot;perfect&quot; world of UniComp and &quot;The Family.&quot;

Despite the name, the &quot;programmers&quot; are not allowed to program Uni since Wei Li Chun, the person who started the Unification, reserves the privilege solely to himself. Instead, they do administrative work.

Even the basic facts of nature are subject to the programmers&#x27; will: men do not grow facial hair, and it rains only at night. Dampers even control the movement of tectonic plates. Reference is made in the story to permanent settlements on Mars, Venus, and the Moon; outposts on Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan and on Mercury; and even to interstellar space exploration. The outposts have their own equivalents of UniComp.

The full rhyme is sung by children bouncing a ball (similar to a clapping game):
:&quot;Christ, Marx, Wood and Wei,&quot;
:&quot;Led us to this perfect day.&quot;
:&quot;Marx, Wood, Wei and Christ,&quot;
:&quot;All but Wei were sacrificed.&quot;
:&quot;Wood, Wei, Christ and Marx,&quot;
:&quot;Gave us lovely schools and parks.&quot;
:&quot;Wei, Christ, Marx and Wood,&quot;
:&quot;Made us humble, made us good.&quot;

Only the programmers and their attendants know that Wei Li Chun remains alive as the leader of the programmers, extending his lifespan by having his head transplanted onto successive youthful bodies.

Bob Wood is mentioned throughout the novel but never discussed in detail. A painting is mentioned depicting Wood presenting the Unification Treaty. In one conversation in which the protagonist discusses his discovery that people once had varying lifespans, one character comments that controlling people&#x27;s lifespans is the ultimate realization of Wei and Wood&#x27;s thinking. The poem also mentions Jesus Christ, the central figure of Christianity, and presents the historical Karl Marx, an ideologue of communism, with the text describing paintings of Jesus attacking the moneychangers in the temple and Marx writing at his desk, both possibly implying an anti-capitalist ideology. These two pillars of the official state ideology are depicted on its coat of arms, with a cross and sickle. &quot;Sacrificed&quot; is a poetic synonym for &quot;dead&quot;.

Uniformity is the defining feature. There is only one language, and all ethnic groups have been eugenically merged into one race, &quot;The Family.&quot; It is so genetically uniform that no transplants are rejected. There are only four personal names for men (&quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Jesus&quot;, &quot;Karl&quot;, and &quot;Li&quot;) and four for women (&quot;Anna&quot;, &quot;Mary&quot;, &quot;Peace&quot;, and &quot;Yin&quot;). Instead of surnames, individuals are distinguished by a nine-character alphanumeric code, their &quot;nameber&quot; (a neologism from &quot;name&quot; and &quot;number&quot;), such as &quot;WL35S7497&quot;. Everyone eats &quot;totalcakes,&quot; drinks &quot;cokes,&quot; wears exactly the same thing, and is satisfied every day.

It is assumed that Uni and the restriction on names were created not very long ago, since Papa Jan was one of the employees who constructed it, and he claims to have remembered when there were many names. However, to make the members genetically uniform, many generations are needed. 

Levin&#x27;s dystopia enjoys some commendable features as well. The Earth and its extra-planetary colonies are free of war, hunger, most diseases, crime, envy, and inter-personal violence. Thanks to rigid population control and a more rational management of the environment, the threat of human extinction has been considerably reduced.

== Plot summary ==
Li RM35M4419, nicknamed &quot;Chip&quot; (as in &quot;chip off the old block&quot;) by his nonconformist grandfather Jan, is a typical child Member, but through a mistake in genetic programming, he has one green eye. Through his grandfather&#x27;s encouragement, he learns how to play a game of &quot;wanting things,&quot; including imagining what career he might pick if he had the choice. Chip is told by his adviser that &quot;deciding&quot; and &quot;picking&quot; are manifestations of selfishness, and he tries to forget his dreams.

As Chip grows up and begins his career, he is mostly a good citizen but commits minor subversive acts, such as procuring art materials for another &quot;nonconformist&quot; member who was denied them. His occasional oddities attract the attention of a secret group of Members of nonconformists, like Chip. There, he meets King, a Medicenter chief who obtains members&#x27; records for potential future recruitment to the group; King&#x27;s beautiful girlfriend, Lilac, a strong-willed and inquisitive woman with unusually dark skin; and Snowflake, a rare albino member. They teach Chip how to get his treatments reduced so that he can feel more and stronger emotions. Chip begins an affair with Snowflake but is really attracted to Lilac.

Chip and Lilac begin to search through old museum maps and soon discover islands around the world that have disappeared from their modern map. They begin to wonder if perhaps other &quot;incurable&quot; members have escaped to the islands. King tells them that the idea is nonsense, but Chip soon learns that King has already interacted with some &quot;incurables&quot; and that they are indeed real. Before he can tell Lilac, Chip&#x27;s ruse is discovered by his adviser. He and all the other members of the group are captured and treated back into docility (except King, who takes his own life before he can be captured).

Some years later, Chip&#x27;s regular treatment is delayed by an earthquake. In the meanwhile, he begins to &quot;wake up&quot; again and remembers Lilac and the islands. He is able to shield his arm from the treatment nozzle and becomes fully awake for the first time. He locates Lilac again and kidnaps her. At first, she fights him, but as she too becomes more &quot;awake,&quot; she remembers the islands and comes willingly. Finding a convenient abandoned boat on the beach, they head for the nearest island of incurables, Majorca. There, they learn that UniComp, as a last resort, has planted failsafes that eventually lead all incurables to the islands, where they will be trapped forever from the treated population. After living &quot;free&quot; on Majorca, Chip and Lilac eventually marry and have a child together.

Chip conceives of a plan to destroy the computer, UniComp, by blowing up its refrigeration system. He recruits other incurables to join him, and they make their way to the mainland. Just as they reach UniComp, one of the incurables, an agent of the programmers, betrays his partners and leads the rest of the group at gunpoint to a secret luxurious underground city beneath UniComp, where they are met by Wei, one of the original planners of the Unification. Wei and the other &quot;programmers&quot; who live in UniComp have arranged the test so that the most daring and resourceful incurables will make their way to UniComp. There, they too will live in luxury as programmers.

After joining the programmers and a few tentative attempts to confide in someone, Chip shares his misgivings with no one, lies low, and dedicates himself to the task of gaining Wei&#x27;s confidence. For example, to deceive Wei, Chip consents to the replacement of his green eye with a brown one even though it involves giving up a cherished part of his identity.

However, nine months later, a new group of incurables arrives, and Chip leaves the welcome party with the intention of using the newcomers&#x27; explosives to blow up the master computer. A physical struggle with Wei, who has the body of a young athlete, results in Wei being shot. Just before he is killed, Wei reveals his true motive in creating the dystopia: &quot;there&#x27;s &quot;joy&quot; in having it, in controlling, in being the only one.&quot; Chip knew all along that it was power hunger, not altruism, that drove Wei to chicanery and murder. Chip succeeds in destroying Uni with the explosives. On his way up from the underground city towards sunlight, Chip tells an angry programmer: &quot;&#x27;There’s joy in having it&#x27;: those were [Wei&#x27;s] last words. Everything else was rationalization. And self-deception.&quot;

The book ends with Chip riding a helicopter toward Majorca, where Lilac, their son, financial sponsors, and friends are hopefully waiting for him. For the first time in his life, he sees raindrops in daytime, nature&#x27;s affirmation that the era of slavery and total control is finally over.

== Reception ==
Cherry Wilder, discussing &quot;This Perfect Day&quot;, stated, &quot;The ideology of the &quot;utopia&quot; is weak, but the quality of the writing and the level of invention are high.&quot; David Pringle gave &quot;This Perfect Day&quot; two stars out of four and described the book as &quot;a slickly-written update of Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot;, lacking in originality but very professionally put together.&quot;

<text>Vortigern (; , ; ; ; Old Breton: &quot;Gurdiern&quot;, &quot;Gurthiern&quot;; ; , , , etc.), also spelled Vortiger, Vortigan, Voertigern and Vortigen, was a 5th-century warlord in Britain, known perhaps as a king of the Britons or at least connoted as such in the writings of Bede and Gildas. His existence is contested by scholars and information about him is obscure.

He may have been the &quot;superbus tyrannus&quot; said to have invited Hengist and Horsa to aid him in fighting the Picts and the Scots, whereupon they revolted, killing his son in the process and forming the Kingdom of Kent. It is said that he took refuge in North Wales, and that his grave was in Dyfed or the Llŷn Peninsula. Gildas later denigrated Vortigern for his misjudgement and also blamed him for the loss of Britain. He is cited at the beginning of the genealogy of the early Kings of Powys.

==Medieval accounts==
===Gildas===
The 6th-century cleric and historian Gildas wrote &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot; () in the first decades of the 6th century. In Chapter 23, he tells how &quot;all the councillors, together with &quot;that proud usurper&quot;&quot; [&quot;omnes consiliarii una cum superbo tyranno&quot;] made the mistake of inviting &quot;the fierce and impious Saxons&quot; to settle in Britain. According to Gildas, apparently, a small group came at first and was settled &quot;on the eastern side of the island, by the invitation of the unlucky [&quot;infaustus&quot;] usurper&quot;. This small group invited more of their countrymen to join them, and the colony grew. Eventually the Saxons demanded that &quot;their monthly allotments&quot; be increased and, when their demands were eventually refused, broke their treaty and plundered the lands of the Romano-British.

It is not clear whether Gildas used the name Vortigern. Most editions published currently omit the name. Two manuscripts name him: &quot;MS. A&quot; (Avranches MS 162, 12th century), refers to &quot;Uortigerno&quot;; and &quot;Mommsen&#x27;s MS. X&quot; (Cambridge University Library MS. Ff. I.27) (13th century) calls him &quot;Gurthigerno&quot;. Gildas never addresses Vortigern as the king of Britain. He is termed a usurper (&quot;tyrannus&quot;), but not solely responsible for inviting the Saxons. To the contrary, he is portrayed as being aided by or aiding a &quot;Council&quot;, which may be a government based on the representatives of all the &quot;cities&quot; (&quot;civitates&quot;) or a part thereof. Gildas also does not consider Vortigern as bad; he simply qualifies him as &quot;unlucky&quot; (&quot;infaustus&quot;) and lacking judgement, which is understandable, as these mercenaries proved to be faithless.

Gildas adds several small details that suggest either he or his source received at least part of the story from the Anglo-Saxons. The first is when he describes the size of the initial party of Saxons, stating that they came in three (or &quot;keels&quot;), &quot;as they call ships of war&quot;. This may be the earliest recovered word of English. The second detail is his repetition that the visiting Saxons were &quot;told by a certain soothsayer among them, that they should occupy the country to which they were sailing three hundred years, and half of that time, a hundred and fifty years, should plunder and despoil the same.&quot; Both of these details are unlikely to have been invented by a Roman or Brittonic source.

Modern scholars have debated the various details of Gildas&#x27; story. One topic of discussion has been about the words Gildas uses to describe the Saxons&#x27; subsidies (&quot;annonas&quot;, &quot;epimenia&quot;) and whether they are legal terms used in a treaty of &quot;foederati&quot;, a late Roman political practice of settling allied barbarian peoples within the boundaries of the empire to furnish troops to aid the defence of the empire. Gildas describes how their raids took them &quot;sea to sea, heaped up by the eastern band of impious men; and as it devastated all the neighbouring cities and lands, did not cease after it had been kindled, until it burnt nearly the whole surface of the island, and licked the western ocean with its red and savage tongue&quot; (chapter 24).

===Bede===
The first extant text considering Gildas&#x27; account is Bede, writing in the early- to mid-8th century. He mostly paraphrases Gildas in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; and &quot;The Reckoning of Time&quot;, adding several details, perhaps most importantly the name of this &quot;proud tyrant&quot;, whom he first calls &quot;Vertigernus&quot; (in his ) and later &quot;Vurtigernus&quot; (in his ). The &quot;Vertigernus&quot; form may reflect an earlier Celtic source or a lost version of Gildas. Bede also gives names in the to the leaders of the Saxons, Hengist and Horsa, specifically identifying their tribes as the Saxons, Angles and Jutes (&quot;H.E.&quot;, 1.14–15). Another significant detail that Bede adds to Gildas&#x27; account is calling Vortigern the king of the British people.

Bede also supplies the date, 449, which was traditionally accepted but has been considered suspect since the late 20th century: &quot;Marcian being made emperor with Valentinian, and the forty-sixth from Augustus, ruled the empire seven years.&quot; Michael Jones notes that there are several arrival dates in Bede. In H.E. 1.15 the arrival occurs within the period 449–455; in 1.23 and 5.23 another date, c. 446, is given; and in 2.14 the same event is dated 446 or 447, suggesting that these dates are calculated approximations.

===&quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;===
The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; (History of the Britons) was attributed until recently to Nennius, a monk from Bangor, Gwynedd, and was probably compiled during the early 9th century. The writer mentions a great number of sources. Nennius wrote more negatively of Vortigern, accusing him of incest (perhaps confusing Vortigern with the Welsh king Vortiporius, accused by Gildas of the same crime), oath-breaking, treason, love for a pagan woman, and lesser vices such as pride.

The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; recounts many details about Vortigern and his sons. Chapters 31–49 tell how Vortigern (Guorthigirn) deals with the Saxons and Saint Germanus of Auxerre. Chapters 50–55 deal with Saint Patrick. Chapter 56 tells about King Arthur and his battles. Chapters 57–65 mention English genealogies, mingled with English and Welsh history. Chapter 66 gives important chronological calculations, mostly on Vortigern and the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain.

Excluding what is taken from Gildas, there are a number of traditions:
* Material quoted from a &quot;Life of Saint Germanus&quot;. These excerpts describe Germanus of Auxerre&#x27;s incident with one Benlli, an inhospitable host seemingly unrelated to Vortigern who comes to an untimely end, but his servant provides hospitality and is made the progenitor of the kings of Powys. They also describe Vortigern&#x27;s son by his own daughter, whom Germanus raises, and Vortigern&#x27;s own end caused by fire from heaven.
It has been suggested that the saint mentioned here may be no more than a local saint or a tale that had to explain all the holy places dedicated to a St. Germanus or a &quot;Garmon&quot;, who may have been a Powys saint or even a bishop from the Isle of Man about the time of writing the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;. The story seems only to be explained as a slur against the rival dynasty of Powys, suggesting that they did not descend from Vortigern but from a mere slave.
* A number of calculations attempting to fix the year when Vortigern invited the Saxons into Britain. These are made by the writer, naming interesting persons and calculating their dates, making several mistakes in the process.
* Genealogical material about Vortigern&#x27;s ancestry, including the names of his four sons (Vortimer, Pascent, Catigern, and Faustus), his father Vitalis, his grandfather Vitalinus, and his great-grandfather Gloui, who is probably just an eponym which associates Vortigern with Glevum, the civitas of Gloucester.
* The story of why Vortigern granted land in Britain to the Saxons, first to Thanet in exchange for service as &quot;foederati&quot; troops, then to the rest of Kent in exchange for marriage to Hengest&#x27;s daughter, then to Essex and Sussex after a banquet where the Saxons treacherously slew all of the leaders of the British but saved Vortigern to extract this ransom.
* The tale of Ambrosius Aurelianus and the two dragons found beneath Dinas Emrys.

The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; relates four battles occurring in Kent, apparently related to material in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (see below). It claims that Vortigern&#x27;s son Vortimer commanded the Britons against Hengest&#x27;s Saxons. Moreover, it claims that the Saxons were driven out of Britain, only to return at Vortigern&#x27;s invitation a few years later, after the death of Vortimer.

The stories preserved in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; reveal an attempt by one or more anonymous British scholars to provide more detail to this story, while struggling to accommodate the facts of the British tradition.

===The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;===
The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; provides dates and locations of four battles which Hengest and his brother Horsa fought against the British in the county of Kent. Vortigern is said to have been the commander of the British for only the first battle; the opponents in the next three battles are variously termed &quot;British&quot; and &quot;Welsh&quot;, which is not unusual for this part of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; locates the Battle of Wippedesfleot as the place where the Saxons first landed, dated 465 in &quot;Wippedsfleot&quot; and thought to be Ebbsfleet near Ramsgate. The year 455 is the last date when Vortigern is mentioned.

The annals for the 5th century in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; were put into their current form during the 9th century, probably during the reign of Alfred the Great. The sources are obscure for the fifth century annals; however, an analysis of the text demonstrates some poetic conventions, so it is probable that they were derived from an oral tradition such as sagas in the form of epic poems.

There is dispute as to when the material was written which comprises the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, and it could be later than the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. Some historians argue that the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; took its material from a source close to the &quot;Chronicle&quot;.

===William of Malmesbury===
Writing soon before Geoffrey of Monmouth, William of Malmesbury added much to the unfavourable assessment of Vortigern:

William does, however, add some detail, no doubt because of a good local knowledge, in &quot;De Gestis Regum Anglorum&quot; book I, chapter 23.

===Geoffrey of Monmouth===
The story of Vortigern adopted its best-known form in Geoffrey&#x27;s pseudohistorical &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. Geoffrey names Constans the older brother of Aurelius Ambrosius and Uther Pendragon. After the death of their father, Constantinus III, Vortigern persuades Constans to leave his monastery and claim the throne. Constans proved a weak and unpopular puppet monarch and Vortigern ruled the country through him until he finally managed Constans&#x27; death by insurgent Picts.

Geoffrey mentions a similar tale just before that episode, however, which may be an unintentional duplication. Just after the Romans leave, the archbishop of London is put forward by the representatives of Britain to organise the island&#x27;s defences. To do so, he arranges for continental soldiers to come to Britain. The name of the bishop is Guitelin, a name similar to the Vitalinus mentioned in the ancestry of Vortigern and to the Vitalinus said to have fought with Ambrosius at the Battle of Guoloph. This Guithelin/Vitalinus disappears from the story as soon as Vortigern arrives. All these coincidences imply that Geoffrey duplicated the story of the invitation of the Saxons, and that the tale of Guithelinus the archbishop might possibly give some insight into the background of Vortigern before his acquisition of power.

Geoffrey identifies Hengest&#x27;s daughter as Rowena. After Vortigern marries her, his sons rebel. Geoffrey adds that Vortigern was succeeded briefly by his son Vortimer, as does the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, only to assume the throne again when Vortimer is killed.

==Pillar of Eliseg==
The inscription on the Pillar of Eliseg, a mid-9th century stone cross in Llangollen, northern Wales, gives the Old Welsh spelling of Vortigern: Guarthi[gern], (the inscription is now damaged and the final letters of the name are missing), believed to be the same person as Gildas&#x27;s &quot;superbus tyrannus&quot;, Vortigern. The pillar also states that he was married to Sevira, the daughter of Magnus Maximus, and gave a line of descent leading to the royal family of Powys, who erected the cross.

==Vortigern as title rather than personal name==
It has occasionally been suggested by scholars that Vortigern might be a royal title, rather than a personal name. The name in Brittonic literally means &quot;Great King&quot; or &quot;Overlord&quot;, composed of the elements *&quot;wor-&quot; &quot;over-, super&quot; and *&quot;tigerno-&quot; &quot;king, lord, chief, ruler&quot; (compare Old Breton , Cornish a type of local ruler - literally &quot;pledge chief&quot;) in medieval Brittany and Cornwall.

However, the element *&quot;tigerno-&quot; was a regular one in Brittonic personal names (compare Kentigern, Catigern, Ritigern, Tigernmaglus, et al.) and, as *&quot;wortigernos&quot; (or derivatives of it) is not attested as a common noun, there is no reason to suppose that it was used as anything other than a personal name. In fact, an Old Irish cognate of it, , was a fairly common personal name in medieval Ireland, further lending credence to the notion that Vortigern was a personal name and not a title.

==Local legends==
A valley on the north coast of the Llŷn Peninsula, known as Nant Gwrtheyrn or &quot;Vortigern&#x27;s Gorge&quot;, is named after Vortigern, and until modern times had a small barrow known locally as &quot;Vortigern&#x27;s Grave&quot;, along with a ruin known as &quot;Vortigern&#x27;s Fort&quot;. However, this conflicts with doubtful reports that he died in his castle on the River Teifi in Dyfed (&quot;Nennius&quot;) or his tower at The Doward in Herefordshire (&quot;Geoffrey of Monmouth&quot;).

Other fortifications associated with Vortigern are at Arfon in Gwynedd, Bradford on Avon in Wiltshire, Carn Fadryn in Gwynedd, Clwyd in Powys, Llandysul in Dyfed, Old Carlisle in Cumberland, Old Sarum in Wiltshire, Rhayader in Powys, Snowdon and Stonehenge in Wiltshire.

==Later portrayals==
Vortigern&#x27;s story remained well known after the Middle Ages, especially in Great Britain. He is a major character in two Jacobean plays, the anonymous &quot;The Birth of Merlin&quot; and Thomas Middleton&#x27;s &quot;Hengist, King of Kent&quot;, first published in 1661. His meeting with Rowena became a popular subject in 17th-century engraving and painting, e.g., William Hamilton&#x27;s 1793 work &quot;Vortigern and Rowena&quot; (above right). He was also featured in literature, such as John Lesslie Hall&#x27;s poems about the beginnings of England.

One of Vortigern&#x27;s most notorious literary appearances is in the play &quot;Vortigern and Rowena&quot;, which was promoted as a lost work of William Shakespeare when it first emerged in 1796. However, it was soon revealed as a literary forgery written by the play&#x27;s purported discoverer, William Henry Ireland, who had previously forged a number of other Shakespearean manuscripts. The play was at first accepted as Shakespeare&#x27;s by some in the literary community, and received a performance at London&#x27;s Drury Lane Theatre on 2 April 1796. The play&#x27;s crude writing, however, exposed it as a forgery, and it was laughed off stage and not performed again. Ireland eventually admitted to the hoax and tried to publish the play by his own name, but had little success.

<doc id="143822" wikidata="Q1572938" url="?curid=143822" title="Supplemental Security Income">
<text>Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a means-tested program that provides cash payments to disabled children, disabled adults, and individuals aged 65 or older who are citizens or nationals of the United States. SSI was created by the Social Security Amendments of 1972 and is incorporated in Title 16 of the Social Security Act. The program is administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and began operations in 1974.

Individuals or their helpers may start the application for SSI benefits by completing a short form on SSA&#x27;s website. SSA staff will schedule an appointment for the individual or helper within one to two weeks and complete the process.

SSI was created to replace federal-state adult assistance programs that served the same purpose, but were administered by the state agencies and received criticism for lacking consistent eligibility criteria. The restructuring of these programs was intended to standardize the eligibility requirements and level of benefits. Although administered by SSA, SSI is funded from the U.S. Treasury general funds, not the Social Security trust fund. As of July 2022, the program provides benefits to approximately five million Americans.

==History==
The legislation creating the program was a result of President Richard Nixon&#x27;s effort to reform the nation&#x27;s welfare programs. At that time, each state had somewhat different programs under the Aid to the Blind, Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled, and Aid to the Elderly. These programs, which received federal funding, were created as part of the original Social Security Act of 1935. The Nixon administration thought these programs should be federalized and run by the Social Security Administration. Thus, SSI was created to eliminate the differences between the states including different disability standards and income and resources requirements, which many perceived as irrational or unfair. President Nixon signed the Social Security Amendments of 1972 on October 30, 1972, which created the SSI Program. The SSI program officially began operations in January 1974 by federalizing states&#x27; programs, designating the Social Security Administration (SSA) to administer the SSI program. SSA was selected because it had been administering a nationwide adult disability program under the Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits (DIB) program since 1956 for workers who are insured through their payroll deduction under the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) programs associated with Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) payroll taxes.

The initial benefit levels for SSI in 1972 were approximately the same as the average monthly benefit as a retired worker under the Social Security retirement benefits program. In August 1974, Congress established legislation to automatically increase SSI benefits by the same percentage and at the same time as Social Security retirement, survivors, and disability benefits. In 2020, the maximum SSI benefit for an individual ($783) was about 52 percent of the average monthly benefit of retired workers ($1,503) in the Social Security retirement benefits program. Although both Social Security and SSI benefits are adjusted for price inflation, initial Social Security benefits are computed by using wage indexing. Because wages tend to grow faster than prices, the maximum SSI benefit will continue to decline relative to benefit levels in the Social Security program.

The maximum SSI benefit in 2020 for an individual ($783) is below the federal poverty standard for an individual in the United States (about $1,084 per month). Because both the SSI amount and the poverty standard are indexed to price inflation, this will continue to be true in the future, in the absence of legislative changes. With SSI income and other sources of family income, about 42 percent of persons on SSI are poor.

Historians Edward D. Berkowitz and Larry DeWitt argue that, while &quot;critics often accused the U.S. social welfare system of skewing benefits toward the middle class, rather than the truly needy&quot;, SSI successfully targeted benefits to economically vulnerable groups such as minorities. In 2020, African Americans made up about 28 percent of the adult SSI population (about 13.4 percent of the overall U.S. population is African American). Among SSI recipients 75 or older, 18 percent are Asian American, 20 percent are African American, and 20 percent are Hispanic.

Disabled children have been categorically eligible for SSI since the program&#x27;s beginning. &quot;Sullivan v. Zebley&quot; was a landmark Supreme Court decision in 1990 that led to additional children qualifying for SSI based on disability. Brian Zebley had brain damage at birth, resulting in mental and physical problems including visual problems and partial paralysis. The Supreme Court found that SSA improperly denied him benefits and concluded that SSA must consider how health impairments affect functioning in children when making disability decisions. A study in 2020 found that, relative to other children, SSI child beneficiaries have &quot;high rates of poverty, near poverty, material hardship, hospitalization, mortality, and adverse schooling outcomes&quot;. A study in 2019 found that infant mortality rates for SSI child applicants are about five times that of all children.

Although there are some exceptions, generally individuals must reside in one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or the Northern Mariana Islands to receive SSI benefits. The Northern Mariana Islands became a U.S. territory in 1976 (after the SSI program began) and the covenant establishing its territorial status included eligibility for SSI. The territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are eligible for federal grants to support the &quot;aged, blind, and disabled&quot; but residents are not eligible for SSI. In April 2022, the Supreme Court ruled (in &quot;United States v. Vaello Madero&quot;) that it is constitutional to exclude residents of Puerto Rico from the SSI program, as the territory does not pay most federal taxes.

For adults who are married, SSA will sometimes pay a benefit based on a couple amount. This would occur if both members of a couple meet the categorical requirements of eligibility (for example, both members of the couple are disabled according to the program&#x27;s definition of disability). In these cases, the benefit payable to a couple is smaller than the combined benefits payable to two individuals in order to take account of the fact that two people living together can live more economically than if each lived alone. However, the reduced SSI couple benefit applies only to those who are legally married, which gives beneficiaries an incentive not to marry.

==Eligibility==
In order to receive SSI benefits, individuals must apply for benefits and meet the following requirements:

* They are 65+ years of age or blind or disabled; and
* They legally reside in one of the fifty states or the District of Columbia or Northern Mariana Islands, are the child of military parents assigned to permanent duty outside of the US, or are a student (certain restrictions apply) temporarily abroad; and
* They have income and resources within certain limits (see subsections).

For eligibility based on age, applicants must establish they are 65 or older. For eligibility based on disability, applicants must provide evidence they meet the Social Security Administration&#x27;s definition of disability. With regard to adult disability cases, the Social Security Administration (SSA) determines whether an individual has a disability that prevents working, at a substantial level, in the national economy. For child disability cases, SSA determines whether the child has &quot;marked&quot; or severe functional limitations. The initial decision as to whether an individual is disabled is made by the various state Disability Determination Services (DDS), which contract with the federal government and must follow federal rules regarding the definition of disability. Individuals denied disability benefits at the initial level have appeal rights. Appealed cases may be heard by administrative law judges, SSA&#x27;s Appeals Council, and the federal courts.

In some cases, individuals may be eligible for Social Security benefits and SSI benefits. For example, a disabled individual who worked in Social Security covered employment and who has limited income and resources may receive a Social Security disability benefit (due to employment prior to disability) and a partial SSI benefit (due to limited income and resources). The Social Security Administration treats an application for SSI to also be an application for any Social Security benefit for which the individual is eligible. In general, however, SSI differs from Social Security because SSI pays benefits to individuals who have limited income and resources. There is no requirement that the individual worked in Social Security covered employment.

===Application for benefits===
An application must be filed with the Social Security Administration before an individual can receive SSI. Individuals or their helpers may start the application for SSI benefits by completing a short form on SSA&#x27;s website. SSA staff will schedule an appointment for the individual or helper within 1–2 weeks and complete the process.

Alternatively, individuals can apply for SSI by:
* Calling SSA&#x27;s national toll-free number (1-800-772-1213)
* Calling a local Social Security office

===Aged, disabled, or blind===
In order to be eligible for SSI, a person must meet the definition of being aged, disabled, or blind.

Aged – Being deemed aged consists of attaining the age of 65 or older. In some cases benefits can be claimed at the age of 62. The Social Security Administration, like the United States Government in general, follows English common law and considers a person to attain an age the day before their birthday.

Disabled – Being deemed disabled consists of meeting the general disability definition used by the Social Security Administration to be eligible for SSDI:

&quot;Disability means inability to engage in any SGA [substantial gainful activity] by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death, or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.&quot;

&quot;The 1967 amendments specified that workers shall be determined to be under a disability only if the physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that the individual is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy. This is regardless of whether any of these are true:

* Such work exists in the immediate area in which the claimant lives.
* A specific job vacancy exists.
* The claimant would be hired if they applied for work.

&quot;The statute also specifies that &#x27;work which exists in the national economy means work which exists in significant numbers either in the region where such individuals live or in several regions of the country.&#x27;&quot;

Substantial gainful activity (SGA), for 2021, is the ability to earn $1,310 gross income in a month&#x27;s period for most disabled individuals. For legally blind individuals, the SGA is $2,190, but applies only to SSDI and not SSI.

In addition, children under the age of 18 can be determined to be disabled for SSI purposes &quot;if the individual has a medically determinable impairment or combination of impairments that causes marked or severe functional limitation(s), and can be expected to result in death, or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.&quot;

Blind – Being deemed blind consists of meeting the following definition:

&quot;central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the use of a correcting lens. An eye which has a limitation in the field of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees should also be considered as having a central visual acuity of 20/200 or less.&quot;

In addition, for SSI purposes, an individual is considered blind regardless of the period of time they are expected to be blind or if they are performing substantial gainful activity.

===Income===
One of the requirements to receive SSI is that the individual&#x27;s income must be below certain limits. These limits may vary based on the state in which the individual lives, living arrangements, the number of people living in the residence, and the type of income. Not all income is counted when determining an individual&#x27;s &quot;countable income&quot; for SSI eligibility purposes. Certain payments such as: grants, scholarships, SNAP benefits, home energy assistance, and small infrequent payments are not included.

===Resources===
Another requirement for SSI is that the individual&#x27;s resources be below a certain limit. This amount is $2,000 for an individual and $3,000 for an individual and their spouse (whether the spouse is eligible for SSI or not), $4,000 for a child applicant with one parent living in the household, and $5,000 for a child applicant with two parents living in the household. However, conditional benefits may be paid if a substantial portion of the resources are considered non-liquid, resources that cannot be sold within 20 working days, if they agree to sell the resources at their current market value within a specified period and repay the money after the non-liquid property is sold. However, not all actual resources are counted in calculating an individual&#x27;s or couple&#x27;s resources for SSI purposes.

The resource limits were originally set at $1,500 for an individual and $2,500 for couples in 1974, and were not linked to inflation. In 1987, the limits were raised to $1,800 and $2,700, in 1988, to $1,900 and $2,850, and, in 1989, to $2,000 and $3,000. Under current law they will remain at present levels indefinitely.

The one exception to the general asset limit is the ABLE account, which was established with the signing into law of the ABLE Act of 2014 (standing for Achieving a Better Life Experience Act) on December 19, 2014, This tax-advantaged account was codified under the newly added Section 529A of the Internal Revenue Code. Details of the accounts, which officially came into effect once the Treasury Department issued enabling regulations and states passed legislation regarding account administration, are:
* Accounts can be established by or on behalf of a disabled person, provided that the beneficiary&#x27;s disability began before age 26.
* Annual contributions to an account are limited to the same amount as the gift tax exclusion for an individual ($15,000 since 2014). The upper limit for lifetime contributions is the same as that for a 529 educational plan in the disabled person&#x27;s state of residence. Contributions are not tax-deductible, but income earned in an account is not subject to tax.
* Tax-free withdrawals can be made for &quot;qualified disability expenses&quot;, including but not limited to education, housing, transportation, employment-related expenses, assistive technology, and healthcare.
* There are special statutory rules regarding the accumulation of ABLE account assets for individuals on SSI and Medicaid. The first $100,000 in an ABLE account is not counted as an asset for purposes of SSI eligibility. Once an ABLE account balance exceeds $100,000, the beneficiary&#x27;s SSI payments are suspended until the account balance drops below $100,000. However, the beneficiary remains covered by Medicaid regardless of the account balance.

===Residency===
SSI benefits are not paid solely to US citizens, but may also be paid to aliens legally residing in the United States. Conversely, citizens may find themselves ineligible because they do not currently reside within the United States; exceptions apply for children of military parents who were born overseas, were disabled or became blind overseas, or first applied for benefits overseas and for students studying abroad who were eligible for SSI in the month prior to leaving the US, whose absence will be for less than one year, and who are studying to enhance their ability to perform substantial gainful activity, sponsored by an educational institution in the US, and would not be available to the individual in the US. Several restrictions apply to the eligibility of aliens however. These include being in a &quot;qualified alien&quot; category and meeting an exception condition.

There are seven categories of qualified aliens based on Department of Homeland Security (DHS) immigration statuses. This includes:
* those admitted as Lawfully admitted for permanent residence (LAPR)
* those granted conditional entry pursuant to section 203(a)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)
* those paroled into the US under section 212(d)(5) of the INA for a period of at least one year
* those who are refugees admitted to the US under section 207 of the INA
* those granted asylum under section 208 of the INA
* those whose deportation is being withheld under sections 243(h) or 241(b)(3) of the INA
* Cuban/Haitian entrants under section 501(e) of the Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980.

There are five exception conditions. These include:
* having already been receiving SSI on August 22, 1996
* having 40 qualifying credits (using SSI as a supplement to Retirement or Disability Insurance Benefits) when in LAPR status
* being a veteran, active-duty member of the U. S. military service, or being the spouse or dependant child of an individual who is
* having been lawfully residing in the US on August 22, 1996, and being blind and disabled (excluding aged individuals)
In order to qualify for SSI, an immigrant must have been a legal resident of the United States before the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 took effect (August 22, 1996). Those who arrived after that date may be denied SSI benefits. However, the regulations governing alien eligibility for SSI are complex and contain many exceptions; for instance, asylees, refugees, spouses of a member of the U.S. military, and some LAPR may be &quot;qualified aliens.&quot; A person who has been in LAPR status for at least five years, has a valid Form I-551 (Green card status) issued by the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration, and has been employed in the United States, may qualify. People wishing to learn whether they might qualify for SSI should contact the Social Security Administration to schedule an appointment for an interview.

A person who is incarcerated for a calendar month is ineligible for benefits. If the person is in a medical facility where at least 50% of their costs are paid by Medicaid, their benefit may be reduced to $30.

===Collateral consequences of warrants, parole, and probation===
Since Congress enacted &quot;fugitive felons&quot; and parole/probation violation provisions in 1996, the Social Security Administration has suspended benefits and charged overpayments to individuals receiving SSI on the basis of outstanding warrants.
Enforcement of the provisions greatly increased in 2000, as SSA reached agreements
with local law enforcement to match databases.

Individuals who are fleeing to avoid prosecution or incarceration for a felony or violating probation or parole are statutorily prohibited from receiving SSI or Title II Social Security benefits.

The Social Security Administration interpreted the statutes broadly to include individuals whose names were matched against a warrant database. Some individuals lost benefits even though the warrant in question was for a different person. For others, the presence of a warrant did not necessarily mean that an individual was &quot;fleeing,&quot; or that the individual had violated probation or parole.

As a result of two legal cases (&quot;Martinez v. Astrue&quot; and &quot;Clark v. Astrue&quot;), the SSA may not suspend benefits based merely on the evidence that a warrant had been issued. Back benefits were owed to hundreds of thousands of recipients.

==Benefit details==

=== Amounts ===
The SSI program (or Title XVI of the Social Security Act 1611) provides monthly federal cash assistance of up to $914 for an individual and $1,371 for a couple (as of 2020) to help meet the costs of basic needs of food, shelter, and clothing.

In most states, SSI eligibility usually assures concurrent access to important medical coverage under the various state Medicaid programs and sometimes access to Section 8 housing benefits. In some states, supplemental payments are made by the state, increasing the cash assistance available through SSI. For example, the state of California (through its State Supplementation Program or SSP) increases the cash assistance, making the total 2020 SSI benefit for an individual $943.72 per month.

Amount calculation

SSI takes the income and resources of the applicant or recipient into consideration when calculating their benefit amount. Resources are determined at the first of the month. If an individual reduces their countable resources below the limit through investing in excluded resources, they will remain eligible. Excluded resources are resources such as: household goods, personal effects, up to one vehicle, and the home the applicant lives in.

An individual&#x27;s monthly benefit will be calculated by subtracting their &quot;countable income&quot; from the maximum benefit amount. &quot;Countable income&quot; is an individual&#x27;s income after applying any appropriate exclusions. It includes earned, unearned, in-kind, and deemed income.
*Earned Income: This is a worker&#x27;s gross income. It includes amounts that have been withheld by employers to pay taxes, health insurance or other payments. Therefore, this may be larger than the amount the individual actually takes home as pay.
*Unearned Income: All income that is not earned income. However, some types of unearned income (e.g., SSI retroactive payments, EITC payments, and state relocation assistance) can be excluded.
**Lump Sums &amp; Court Awards: A lump sum award or a court award, such as from a settlement, are considered unearned income for SSI purposes. Individuals on SSI must report receiving a lump sum or court award to the Social Security Administration by at least 10 days after the month in which the award was received. Any lump sum or court award will reduce the individual&#x27;s benefit award amount correspondingly in the month received. If the award remains unspent, it will count as resources in the following month, impacting eligibility.
*In-Kind Income: Non-cash items such as: real property (including shelter), food, or non-cash wages (e.g., room and board as compensation for employment).
*Deemed Income: When an eligible individual resides in the same household as his/her ineligible spouse or, if a child, with ineligible parent(s), the income of such spouse or parent is considered in determining the individual&#x27;s eligibility and payment amount.

=== Payments ===
Payments for SSI are made on the first day of the month unless that day is on a weekend or legal holiday, in which case the payment is made on the first day prior that is not a weekend or legal holiday. The minimum benefit is one dollar.

When benefits start

Social Security determines the first month of potential eligibility for SSI by the date of the intent to file an application for benefits as expressed to the Social Security Administration, and an application is filed within 60 days of the date of that expressed intention. To begin the process, people wishing to be considered must contact Social Security (there is a toll-free telephone number) to set up a &quot;disability interview.&quot; No online application for SSI is currently available; however, one may apply for Social Security Disability or Retirement benefits online and add the application for SSI via a telephone-scheduled interview. Calls placed on the last day of the month, where the interview is scheduled for the second week of the following month, will result in SSI eligibility being retroactive to the month in which the call was made to set up the appointment, although the first check will not be received until the next month. For example, a person calls on 31 January to set up an appointment for February. January will be the month-of-application for determination purposes, but the first benefit check will be issued in February. Medicaid benefits usually begin the first month in which medical and financial requirements are met.

Eligibility during waiting period

People who have qualified for Social Security disability benefits may receive SSI during the five-month waiting period if they meet the income and resource requirements specified above in the eligibility section.

=== Overpayments, underpayments, and missed benefits ===
The Social Security Administration (SSA) indicates that their &quot;greatest payment accuracy challenges occur within the SSI program.&quot; Further, the agency notes administering &quot;the SSI program is complicated by the statutory requirement for us to determine SSI eligibility and calculate SSI payments on a monthly basis.&quot; Because payment accuracy is sometimes the result of &quot;program requirements themselves&quot;, the agency is seeking ways to simplify the program.

An overpayment occurs when the Social Security Administration pays an individual benefits that they are not eligible for. This may occur if an individual exceeds the income or resource limit for a given month. The overpayment amount is calculated as the difference between the amount that was paid and the amount for which the individual was eligible. To avoid overpayments, individuals should make sure to comply with their reporting responsibilities (e.g., report any new income). Additionally, individuals should be aware of the resource and income thresholds (see above) that determine eligibility. To avoid overpayment, when an individual knows they will surpass a resource or income threshold for a given month, they should proactively report this to the Social Security Administration.

If a beneficiary is not at fault for an overpayment and cannot afford to pay the money back, they can submit a waiver form (SSA-63BK) to prevent overpayment recovery. &quot;Fault&quot; can be the failure to furnish information which the individual knew or should have known was incorrect, making an incorrect statement they knew to be incorrect, or not returning a payment they knew or could have been expected to know was incorrect.

An underpayment occurs when the Social Security Administration pays an individual benefits below the amount they are due. Underpayments in SSI often occur if the agency is unaware of changes in a beneficiary&#x27;s earnings or living arrangements.

Missed benefits occur when an individual is unaware of eligibility for SSI and does not apply. A randomized control trial by SSA found mailing notices to individuals informing them about the SSI program sharply increased applications and benefit awards. Studies have found that &quot;just over 50 percent&quot; of individuals eligible for SSI receive benefits from the program, which can be attributed to lack of awareness, a complex application process, or a desire not to participate in the program.

==Federal living arrangements==
There are four living arrangements for SSI: A, B, C, and D.

===Living arrangement A===
Living arrangement A is for an individual that has rental liability or buys their food separately from the rest of the household.

=== Living arrangement B===
Living arrangement B is for an individual that has no rental liability and does not buy their food separately. This is the most disadvantageous living arrangement. An individual will have a minimum charge of income deducted from their check. This is done because it is considered that an individual is being given income in the form of free housing and food. An individual in living arrangement B will also be subject to more periodic reviews called redeterminations. This is done because it is common for a person in living arrangement B to eventually obtain rental liability or buy their food separately.

===Living arrangement C===
Living arrangement C is for children living with at least one of their parents. In some cases it may be possible that a child has another living arrangement. This happens when the child does not live with either parent.

===Living arrangement D===
Living arrangement D is for individuals in facility where Medicaid pays over fifty percent. A person is only due a check of thirty dollars per month. This is because it considered that the individual has all his basic needs met.

==Beneficiaries by age==
* Age 65 or older – 2,298,228
* Between ages 18–64 – 4,646,559
* Under age 18 – 1,132,080

Total beneficiaries as of 2019: 8,076,867

==Beneficiaries and costs==
==Payee assignment==
Generally, the person qualifying for benefits is determined to be capable of managing their own financial affairs, and the benefits may be disbursed directly to them. In the case of persons who have a diagnosed mental impairment which interferes with their ability to manage their own finances, the Social Security Administration may require that the person assign someone to be their representative payee. This person will receive the benefits on behalf of the disabled individual, and disburse them directly to payors such as landlords, or to the disabled person, while providing money management assistance (help with purchasing items, limiting spending money, etc.). The representative payee generally does not charge a fee for this service, especially if the payee is a friend or relative. Social service agencies who are assigned as payee are prohibited from charging a fee, though some private payee agencies do provide the service for a small fee. Some states and counties have representative payee agencies (also called substitute payee programs) which receive the benefits on behalf of the disabled person&#x27;s social worker, and disburse the benefits per the social worker&#x27;s instructions.

Almost all children eligible for SSI have representative payees (typically a parent or other family member). Among disabled adults receiving SSI, about 34 percent have representative payees. Disabled adults with mental disorders, such as autistic disorders, developmental disorders, and intellectual disabilities, commonly have representative payees. About 10 percent of SSI recipients 65 or older have representative payees.

The Social Security Advisory Board commissioned a study of the Social Security Administration&#x27;s representative payee program and held a policy forum in 2020 on the topic. The study noted the difficulty SSA field staff face in determining the need for representative payees and finding suitable payees particularly when family members are not available. In addition, the large size of the payee program (6 million payees for Social Security and SSI beneficiaries) combined with limited agency resources makes selection and monitoring of payees challenging for SSA. Among its recommendations, the authors of the study concluded SSA needed additional staff to effectively run the payee program. The authors also suggested SSA pilot a program where some field staff specialized in representative payee workloads.

==Benefits in addition to SSI==
Once an individual qualifies for Supplemental Security Income they automatically become eligible for several other assistance programs as allowed by Federal and State law. An SSI recipient can receive benefits from all programs listed and they serve as a safety net for those on the program.

*Medicaid In order to help with the purchase of medicine and hospital care for the aged, blind, and disabled.
*Food Stamps (SNAP) for the purchase of food. Depends on the individual&#x27;s state of residence on how much they may receive in food stamps.
*Housing choice voucher program, more commonly known as HUD Section 8. SSI recipients automatically are entitled to Section 8 Housing as they meet the low income criteria yet they have to be approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
*Ticket to Work All SSI beneficiaries ages 18–64 interested in working are eligible for free employment support services through the Social Security Administration.

In addition, SSI recipients who are eligible for Medicare receive assistance in covering out-of-pocket medical expenses through the Medicare Savings Programs and the Extra Help Program.

==Recent legislative and regulatory proposals==
The Biden administration has proposed legislative changes that would raise the maximum federal benefit under SSI to at least the poverty threshold for the United States (about $1,084 per month in 2020). Under current benefit amounts, about 3.3 million SSI recipients are poor. The administration has also proposed increasing the resource limits in SSI by changes in the price level in the United States. Under current resource limits, to qualify for SSI, individuals must have resources below $2,000 and married couples must have resources below $3,000. These limits have been fixed in dollar amounts since 1989. The administration&#x27;s proposal would increase these to about $4,300 and $8,600 in 2021 (reflecting price growth since 1989 and setting the couple rate at twice that of an individual). Amounts would be automatically increased for future price growth. The Biden administration has further proposed to eliminate benefit reductions due to &quot;in kind&quot; support received by SSI recipients and to set the couple rate under SSI to twice that of the individual rate.

The Trump administration proposed legislative changes to disregard earnings of disabled students for purposes of calculating SSI benefits, which would allow students to increase earnings without a loss in SSI benefits. The Trump administration also proposed legislative changes to reduce total SSI benefits in cases where more than one person in the family qualified for SSI. These proposals were not acted upon by Congress.

A regulation implemented by the Trump administration removed the inability to speak English as an educational factor to be considered in SSI and Social Security disability determination. The regulation is projected to &quot;result in a reduction of about 6,500 OASDI [Social Security] beneficiary awards per year and 4,000 SSI recipient awards per year on average over the period FY 2019-28, with a corresponding reduction of $4.6 billion in OASDI benefit payments and $0.8 billion in Federal SSI payments over the same period.&quot; The Trump administration argued communicating in English is no longer &quot;a reliable indicator of an individual&#x27;s educational attainment or the vocational impact of an individual&#x27;s education.&quot; Disability advocates, however, questioned the validity of this argument and provided comments arguing against the regulation.

The Trump administration proposed a regulation to conduct an additional 1.1 million full disability reviews over the 2020-2029 period of individuals receiving Social Security and SSI disability. The regulation would have terminated Social Security and SSI benefits for a number of individuals and, based on a number of comments in the federal register, was controversial. Trump administration officials argued the rule would encourage labor force reentry among disabled persons. However, organizations expressed concern that many disabled individuals would not have representation when their cases were reviewed and would face onerous administrative challenges that would ultimately prevent them from continuing to receive benefits even though they were still disabled. The proposed regulation was withdrawn by the Biden administration.

In addition, the Trump administration developed a proposal that would have made it more difficult for older workers to qualify for Social Security or SSI disability. The Social Security Act requires SSA to consider a person&#x27;s education and age when making disability decisions. Officials in the Trump administration argued that older workers in the current economy no longer face the same difficulties as in the past with regard to meeting the occupational requirements of work and therefore tighter standards were necessary. Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives strongly opposed the proposal, arguing the disability requirements were already strict and the regulation would prevent severely disabled individuals from receiving benefits. Leaked documents to the press indicated that as many as 500,000 individuals would not receive Social Security or SSI if the regulation was implemented. The Biden administration withdrew consideration of the regulation.

Recent legislative proposals in Congress have included proposed changes to child benefits, eligibility requirements, and benefit amounts.

The School Attendance Improves Lives (SAIL) Act in 2015 proposed reducing SSI benefits for children ages 16–17 if they were not attending school. The goal of the legislation was to increase school attendance among SSI recipients, although the legislation was criticized by some as being unnecessary. The legislation was not enacted.

Some members of the House and Senate, including the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee Ron Wyden, have requested the Biden administration include legislative proposals to increase SSI benefits to the poverty level and to adjust resource limits under SSI as part of the administration&#x27;s &quot;American Families Plan.&quot;

==Improving outcomes for disabled youth==
Disabled youth transitioning to adulthood have been a focus of policymakers. Upon turning 18, a child&#x27;s disability is re-evaluated using SSA&#x27;s definition of disability for adults. In about one-third of the cases, SSI benefits are terminated. Policymakers have been concerned that these youth, who have a history of health problems, are unprepared to support themselves in adulthood. As a result, Congress has created special provisions in the law and funded large-scale research studies to test ways to improve outcomes for youth on SSI. In addition, federal agencies have made some attempts to improve outcomes through better practices.

A special provision of the Social Security Act, called Section 301, allows disabled youth to retain benefits at age 18 so long as they are working in an approved program to prepare for employment in adulthood. For example, youth participating in programs run by state Vocational Rehabilitation agencies may continue to receive benefits even if they do not meet the adult disability definition. Because many families are unaware of the protections under Section 301, SSA began mailing information to families with disabled youth to inform them of this provision and provide other information to help youth successfully transition to adulthood.

Congress has funded two large-scale studies to test ways to improve outcomes among disabled youth on SSI. The Youth Transition Demonstration (YTD) tested service and other interventions in several states. Findings from the demonstration were mixed, with some interventions improving outcomes (employment, lower contact with the juvenile justice system) and some interventions not having statistically significant effects. YTD was followed by the Promoting Readiness in Minors in SSI (PROMISE) demonstration. Interim impact results found positive employment and other outcomes from &quot;case management, employment-promoting services, benefits counseling, financial education, and parent training and information about youth’s disability.&quot;

<text>The Boys from Brazil is a 1976 thriller novel by American writer Ira Levin. It was made into a film of the same title that was released in 1978.

== Plot ==
Yakov Liebermann is a Nazi hunter (loosely based on Simon Wiesenthal) who runs a center in Vienna that documents crimes against humanity, perpetrated during the Holocaust. The waning interest of the Western nations in tracking down Nazi war criminals, and the failure of the bank where he kept his center&#x27;s funds, has forced him to move the center to his own lodgings.

Then, in September 1974, Liebermann receives a phone call from a young man in Brazil who claims he has just finished tape recording a meeting held by the so-called &quot;Angel of Death&quot;, Dr. Josef Mengele, a concentration camp medical doctor who performed horrific experiments on camp victims during World War II. According to the young man, Mengele is activating the ODESSA for a strange assignment: sending out six Nazis (all former SS officers) to kill 94 men living in Western Europe and North America, who share a few common traits. All men are civil servants, and all of them have to be killed on or about particular dates, spread over several years. All will be 65 years old at the time of their killing. Before the young man can finish the conversation, he is killed.

Liebermann is hesitant and wonders if the call was a prank. But he investigates and discovers that the killings the young man spoke of are taking place. As he tries to determine why the seemingly unimportant men are being killed, he discovers by coincidence that the children of two of the men are identical. It eventually transpires each of the 94 targets has a son aged 13, a genetic clone of Adolf Hitler planted by Mengele and, through corrupt adoption agency employees, placed with families that have lives similar to Hitler&#x27;s own upbringing. Mengele wishes to create a new Führer for a revitalized Nazi movement, and is thus trying to ensure that the lives of the clones follow a similar path to Hitler&#x27;s. Each civil servant father is married to a woman about 23 years younger, and their killing is an attempt to mimic the timing of the death of Hitler&#x27;s own father. Liebermann makes sufficient progress in his investigation that the ODESSA ends the operation and recalls the six Nazi operatives sent to kill the men. Infuriated, Mengele resolves to complete as many of the killings as he can on his own and travels to the United States.

Liebermann manages to work out who the next intended target is - a man named Henry Wheelock who lives in Pennsylvania - and travels there to warn Wheelock that his life may be in danger. However, Mengele reaches Wheelock first, kills him, and then encounters Liebermann. Liebermann is shot by Mengele; before Mengele can kill him, Liebermann manages to free the Wheelock family&#x27;s attack dogs, who restrain Mengele. When Wheelock&#x27;s 13-year-old adopted son, Bobby Wheelock, one of the Hitler clones, arrives to this scene, Mengele pleads for him to join Mengele in his plans and tells the boy about his parentage. The boy, deeming him insane, instead orders the family&#x27;s attack dogs to kill him, and makes a deal with the injured Liebermann that he will call for help right away as long as Liebermann promises to never disclose that the boy ordered the dogs to kill Mengele. The plan is thus halted, but 18 Hitler clones have already lost their fathers. 

Liebermann destroys the list of the 94 clones so that a younger Nazi hunter will not be able to kill what may still turn out to be harmless boys, declaring that morality demanded that they not stoop to the Nazis&#x27; level by killing children. However, the book ends with one such cloned boy, an amateur artist, drawing a scene of someone moving large numbers of people much as Hitler had.

==Reviews==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; called it an &quot;appallingly inventive plot.&quot;

In a 2011 review for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Sophia Martelli wrote: &quot;Although the book is now fairly dated, at the time of publication the inclusion of real or near-real characters (Mengele&#x27;s nemesis Liebermann is a conflation of Nazi hunters such as Simon Wiesenthal and Serge Klarsfeld, who attempted to capture Mengele in South America) must have added a chilling dimension. What scares today is Levin&#x27;s premise based on biological engineering: in the 1970s, although scientifically possible, Mengele&#x27;s plan belonged firmly in the realm of fiction; now it&#x27;s not nearly so far-fetched.&quot;

The book became a best seller.

== Adaptation ==
In 1978, the book was adapted into a movie directed by Franklin J. Scaffner, written by Levin and Heywood Gould, with Gregory Peck, Laurence Olivier and James Mason starring. The movie was well-received, and was nominated for three Academy Awards.

<text>The First Opium War (), also known as the Anglo-Chinese War, was a series of military engagements fought between the British Empire and the Qing Dynasty of China between 1839 and 1842. The immediate issue was the Chinese enforcement of their ban on the opium trade by seizing private opium stocks from mainly British merchants at Guangzhou (then named Canton) and threatening to impose the death penalty for future offenders. Despite the opium ban, the British government supported the merchants&#x27; demand for compensation for seized goods, and insisted on the principles of free trade and equal diplomatic recognition with China. Opium was Britain&#x27;s single most profitable commodity trade of the 19th century. After months of tensions between the two states, the Royal Navy launched an expedition in June 1840, which ultimately defeated the Chinese using technologically superior ships and weapons by August 1842. The British then imposed the Treaty of Nanking, which forced China to increase foreign trade, give compensation, and cede Hong Kong Island to the British. Consequently, the opium trade continued in China. Twentieth-century nationalists considered 1839 the start of a century of humiliation, and many historians consider it the beginning of modern Chinese history.

In the 18th century, the European demand for Chinese luxury goods (particularly silk, porcelain, and tea) created a trade imbalance between China and Britain. European silver flowed into China through the Canton System, which confined incoming foreign trade to the southern port city of Guangzhou. To counter this imbalance, the British East India Company began to grow opium in Bengal and allowed private British merchants to sell opium to Chinese smugglers for illegal sale in China. The influx of narcotics reversed the Chinese trade surplus and increased the numbers of opium addicts inside the country, outcomes that seriously worried Chinese officials.

Senior government officials within the country had been shown to be colluding against the imperial ban due to stocks of opium in European warehouses in clear view being ignored. In 1839, the Daoguang Emperor, rejecting proposals to legalise and tax opium, appointed Viceroy of Huguang Lin Zexu to go to Guangzhou to halt the opium trade completely. Lin wrote an open letter to Queen Victoria appealing to her moral responsibility to stop the opium trade, although she never received it. Lin then resorted to using force in the western merchants&#x27; enclave. He arrived in Guangzhou at the end of January 1839 and organized a coastal defence. In March 1839, British opium dealers were forced to hand over 2.37 million pounds of opium. On 3 June 1839, Lin ordered the opium to be destroyed in public on Humen Beach to show the Government&#x27;s determination to ban smoking. All other supplies were confiscated and a blockade of foreign ships on the Pearl River was ordered.

Tensions escalated in July 1839 after drunk British sailors killed a Chinese villager named Lin Weixi; the British official in charge, Admiral Charles Elliot, refused to hand over those accused to Chinese authorities in an attempt to avoid their being killed on the spot, as had happened with British citizens in the &quot;Lady Hughes&quot; Affair of 1784. Later, fighting broke out, with the British navy destroying the Chinese naval blockade, and launching an offensive. In the ensuing conflict, the Royal Navy used its superior naval and gunnery power to inflict a series of decisive defeats on the Chinese Empire. In 1842, the Qing dynasty was forced to sign the Treaty of Nanking—the first of what the Chinese later called the unequal treaties—which granted an indemnity and extraterritoriality to British subjects in China, opened five treaty ports to British merchants, and ceded Hong Kong Island to the British Empire. The failure of the treaty to satisfy British goals of improved trade and diplomatic relations led to the Second Opium War (1856–1860). The resulting social unrest was the background for the Taiping Rebellion, which further weakened the Qing regime.

== Background ==

=== Establishment of trade relations ===
Direct maritime trade between Europe and China began in 1557 when the Portuguese Empire leased an outpost from the Ming dynasty in Macau. Other European nations soon followed the Portuguese lead, inserting themselves into the existing Asian maritime trade network to compete with Arab, Chinese, Indian, and Japanese merchants in intraregional commerce. After the Spanish conquest of the Philippines, the exchange of goods between China and Europe accelerated dramatically. From 1565, the Manila Galleons brought silver into the Asian trade network from mines in South America. China was a primary destination for the precious metal, as the imperial government mandated that Chinese goods could only be exported in exchange for silver bullion.

British ships began to appear sporadically around the coasts of China from 1635 on. Without establishing formal relations through the Chinese tributary system, by which most Asian nations were able to negotiate with China, British merchants were only allowed to trade at the ports of Zhoushan, Xiamen (or Amoy), and Guangzhou. Official British trade was conducted through the auspices of the British East India Company, which held a royal charter for trade with the Far East. The East India Company gradually came to dominate Sino-European trade from its position in India and due to the strength of the Royal Navy.
Trade benefited after the newly risen Qing dynasty relaxed maritime trade restrictions in the 1680s. Formosa (Taiwan) came under Qing control in 1683 and rhetoric regarding the tributary status of Europeans was muted. Guangzhou became the port of preference for incoming foreign trade. Ships did try to call at other ports, but these locations could not match the benefits of Guangzhou&#x27;s geographic position at the mouth of the Pearl River, nor did they have the city&#x27;s long experience in balancing the demands of Beijing with those of Chinese and foreign merchants. From 1700 onward Guangzhou was the centre of maritime trade with China, and this market process was gradually formulated by Qing authorities into the &quot;Canton System&quot;. From the system&#x27;s inception in 1757, trading in China was extremely lucrative for European and Chinese merchants alike as goods such as tea, porcelain, and silk were valued highly enough in Europe to justify the expenses of travelling to Asia. The system was highly regulated by the Qing government. Foreign traders were only permitted to do business through a body of Chinese merchants known as the Cohong and were forbidden to learn Chinese. Foreigners could only live in one of the Thirteen Factories and were not allowed to enter or trade in any other part of China. Only low-level government officials could be dealt with, and the imperial court could not be lobbied for any reason excepting official diplomatic missions. The Imperial laws that upheld the system were collectively known as the Prevention Barbarian Ordinances (). The Cohong were particularly powerful in the Old China Trade, as they were tasked with appraising the value of foreign products, purchasing or rebuffing said imports and charged with selling Chinese exports at an appropriate price. The Cohong was made up of between (depending on the politics of Guangzhou) 6 to 20 merchant families. Most of the merchant houses these families ruled had been established by low-ranking mandarins, but several were Cantonese or Han in origin. Another key function of the Cohong was the traditional bond signed between a Cohong member and a foreign merchant. This bond stated that the receiving Cohong member was responsible for the foreign merchant&#x27;s behavior and cargo while in China. In addition to dealing with the Cohong, European merchants were required to pay customs fees, measurement duties, provide gifts, and hire navigators.

Despite restrictions, silk and porcelain continued to drive trade through their popularity in Europe, and an insatiable demand for Chinese tea existed in Britain. From the mid-17th century onward around 28 million kilograms/61.6 million pounds of silver were received by China, principally from European powers, in exchange for Chinese products.

=== European trade deficits ===
A brisk trade between China and European powers continued for over a century. While this trading heavily favoured the Chinese and resulted in European nations sustaining large trade deficits, the demand for Chinese goods continued to drive commerce. In addition, the colonisation and conquest of the Americas resulted in European nations (namely Spain, Great Britain, and France) gaining access to a cheap supply of silver, resulting in European economies remaining relatively stable despite the trade deficit with China. This silver was also shipped across the Pacific Ocean to China directly, notably through the Spanish-controlled Philippines. In stark contrast to the European situation, Qing China sustained a trade surplus. Foreign silver flooded into China in exchange for Chinese goods, expanding the Chinese economy but also causing inflation and forming a Chinese reliance on European silver.

The continued economic expansion of European economies in 17th and 18th centuries gradually increased the European demand for precious metals, which were used to mint new coins; this increasing need for hard currency to remain in circulation in Europe reduced the supply of bullion available for trade in China, driving up costs and leading to competition between merchants in Europe and European merchants who traded with the Chinese. This market force resulted in a chronic trade deficit for European governments, who were forced to risk silver shortages in their domestic economies to supply the needs of their merchants in Asia (who as private enterprises still turned a profit by selling valuable Chinese goods to consumers in Europe). This gradual effect was greatly exacerbated by a series of large-scale colonial wars between Great Britain and Spain in the mid 18th century; these conflicts disrupted the international silver market and eventually resulted in the independence of powerful new nations, namely the United States and Mexico. Without cheap silver from the colonies to sustain their trade, European merchants who traded with China began to take silver directly out of circulation in the already-weakened economies of Europe to pay for goods in China. This angered governments, who saw their economies shrink as a result, and fostered a great deal of animosity towards the Chinese for their restriction of European trade. The Chinese economy was unaffected by fluctuations in silver prices, as China was able to import Japanese silver to stabilise its money supply. European goods remained in low demand in China, ensuring the longstanding trade surplus with the European nations continued. Despite these tensions, trade between China and Europe grew by an estimated 4% annually in the years leading up to the start of the opium trade.

=== Opium trade ===

Opium as a medicinal ingredient was documented in Chinese texts as early as the Tang dynasty (617–907), but the recreational usage of the drug was limited. As with India, opium (then limited by distance to a dried powder, often drunk with tea or water) was introduced to China and Southeast Asia by Arab merchants. The Ming dynasty banned tobacco as a decadent good in 1640, and opium was seen as a similarly minor issue. The first restrictions on opium were passed by the Qing in 1729 when Madak (a substance made from powdered opium blended with tobacco) was banned. At the time, Madak production used up most of the opium being imported into China, as pure opium was difficult to preserve. Consumption of Javanese opium rose in the 18th century, and after the Napoleonic Wars resulted in the British occupying Java, British merchants became the primary traders in opium. The British realised they could reduce their trade deficit with Chinese manufactories by counter-trading in narcotic opium, and therefore efforts were made to produce more opium in Company-controlled India. Limited British sales of Indian opium began in 1781, with exports to China increasing as the East India Company solidified its control over India.

The British opium was produced in Bengal and the Ganges River Plain, where the British inherited an existing opium industry from the declining Mughal Empire and saw the product as a potentially valuable export. The East India Company commissioned and managed hundreds of thousands of poppy plantations. It took care of the painstaking lancing of individual pods to obtain the raw gum, drying and forming it into cakes, before coating and packaging them for auction in Calcutta. The company tightly controlled the opium industry, and all opium was considered company property until it was sold. From Kolkata, the company&#x27;s Board of Customs, Salt, and Opium concerned itself with quality control by managing the way opium was packaged and shipped. No poppies could be cultivated without the company&#x27;s permission, and the company banned private businesses from refining opium. All opium in India was sold to the company at a fixed rate, and the company hosted a series of public opium auctions every year. The difference of the company-set price of raw opium and the sale price of refined opium at auction (minus expenses) was profit made by the East India Company. In addition to securing poppies cultivated on lands under its direct control, the company&#x27;s board issued licences to the independent princely states of Malwa, where significant quantities of poppies were grown.
By the late 18th century, company and Malwan farmlands (which were traditionally dependent on cotton growing) had been hard hit by the introduction of factory-produced cotton cloth, which used cotton grown in Egypt or the American South. Opium was considered a lucrative replacement, and was soon being auctioned in ever larger amounts in Calcutta. Private merchants who possessed a company charter (to comply with the British royal charter for Asiatic trade) bid on and acquired goods at the Calcutta auction before sailing to Southern China. British ships brought their cargoes to islands off the coast, especially Lintin Island, where Chinese traders with fast and well-armed small boats took the goods inland for distribution, paying for the opium with silver. The Qing administration initially tolerated opium importation because it created an indirect tax on Chinese subjects, as increasing the silver supply available to foreign merchants through the sale of opium encouraged Europeans to spend more money on Chinese goods. This policy provided the funds British merchants needed to then greatly increase tea exports from China to England, delivering further profits to the Qing monopoly on tea exports held by the imperial treasury and its agents in Guangzhou.
However, opium usage continued to grow in China, adversely affecting social stability. From Guangzhou, the habit spread outwards to the North and West, affecting members from every class of Chinese society. By the early 19th century, more and more Chinese were smoking British opium as a recreational drug. For many, what started as recreation soon became a punishing addiction: many people who stopped ingesting opium suffered chills, nausea, and cramps, and sometimes died from withdrawal. Once addicted, people would often do almost anything to continue to get access to the drug. These serious social issues eventually led to the Qing government issuing an edict against the drug in 1780, followed by an outright ban in 1796, and an order from the governor of Guangzhou to stop the trade in 1799. To circumvent the increasingly stringent regulations in Guangzhou, foreign merchants bought older ships and converted them into floating warehouses. These ships were anchored off of the Chinese coast at the mouth of the Pearl River in case the Chinese authorities moved against the opium trade, as the ships of the Chinese navy had difficulty operating in open water. Inbound opium ships would unload a portion of their cargo onto these floating warehouses, where the narcotic was eventually purchased by Chinese opium dealers. By implementing this system of smuggling, foreign merchants could avoid inspection by Chinese officials and prevent retaliation against the trade in legal goods, in which many smugglers also participated.

In the early 19th century, American merchants joined the trade and began to introduce opium from Turkey into the Chinese market—this supply was of lesser quality but cheaper, and the resulting competition among British and American merchants drove down the price of opium, leading to an increase in the availability of the drug for Chinese consumers. The demand for opium rose rapidly and was so profitable in China that Chinese opium dealers (who, unlike European merchants, could legally travel to and sell goods in the Chinese interior) began to seek out more suppliers of the drug. The resulting shortage in supply drew more European merchants into the increasingly lucrative opium trade to meet the Chinese demand. In the words of one trading house agent, &quot;[Opium] it is like gold. I can sell it anytime.&quot; From 1804 to 1820, a period when the Qing treasury needed to finance the suppression of the White Lotus Rebellion and other conflicts, the flow of money gradually reversed, and Chinese merchants were soon exporting silver to pay for opium rather than Europeans paying for Chinese goods with the precious metal. European and American ships were able to arrive in Guangzhou with their holds filled with opium, sell their cargo, use the proceeds to buy Chinese goods, and turn a profit in the form of silver bullion. This silver would then be used to acquire more Chinese goods. While opium remained the most profitable good to trade with China, foreign merchants began to export other cargoes, such as machine-spun cotton cloth, rattan, ginseng, fur, clocks, and steel tools. However, these goods never reached the same level of importance as narcotics, nor were they as lucrative.
The Qing imperial court debated whether or how to end the opium trade, but their efforts to curtail opium abuse were complicated by local officials and the Cohong, who profited greatly from the bribes and taxes involved in the narcotics trade. Efforts by Qing officials to curb opium imports through regulations on consumption resulted in an increase in drug smuggling by European and Chinese traders, and corruption was rampant. In 1810, the Daoguang Emperor issued an edict concerning the opium crisis, declaring,

Nonetheless, by 1831, the annual opium traffic neared 20,000 chests, each with a net weight of around 140 pounds, compared with just about 4,000 chests per year between 1800 and 1818. After the East India Company&#x27;s monopoly on tea ended in 1833 and private merchants began to join in, this quantity would go on to double before the close of the decade.

Bengal and India, under the British Raj, experienced mixed effects from the Britain-China opium trade. On one hand, millions died in Bengal during the famine of 1770 after agricultural land was forcibly converted to poppy cultivation. Small farmers in India&#x27;s Bihar Province were compelled to grow poppies without profit. On the other hand, opium became the main driver of capital accumulation for merchants and bankers in western India. The Indian government&#x27;s revenue from opium trade rose from less than five percent of its total in the early 1800s to nearly 17 percent in 1890. The income helped British rule and the East India Company expand further in the region.

The opium profits of the Royal Dutch Trading Company in the Dutch East Indies financed several enterprises, such as Royal Dutch Shell. A few American merchants also made a fortune from the opium trade and invested their proceeds in railroads, hotel chains, and manufacturing in the United States.

=== Changing trade policy ===
In addition to the start of the opium trade, economic and social innovations led to a change in the parameters of the wider Sino-European trade. The formulation of classical economics by Adam Smith and other economic theorists caused academic belief in mercantilism to decline in Britain. Under the prior system, the Qianlong Emperor restricted trade with foreigners on Chinese soil only for licensed Chinese merchants, while the British government on their part issued a monopoly charter for trade only to the British East India Company. This arrangement was not challenged until the 19th century when the idea of free trade was popularised in the West. Fueled by the Industrial Revolution, Britain began to use its growing naval power to spread a broadly liberal economic model, encompassing open markets and relatively barrier free international trade, a policy in line with the credo of Smithian economics. This stance on trade was intended to open foreign markets to the resources of Britain&#x27;s colonies, as well as provide the British public with greater access to consumer goods such as tea. In Great Britain, the adoption of the gold standard in 1821 resulted in the empire minting standardised silver shillings, further reducing the availability of silver for trade in Asia and spurring the British government to press for more trading rights in China.

In contrast to this new economic model, the Qing dynasty continued to employ a Confucian-Modernist, highly organised economic philosophy that called for strict government intervention in industry for the sake of preserving societal stability. While the Qing government was not explicitly anti-trade, a lack of need for imports and increasingly heavy taxes on luxury goods limited pressure on the government to open further ports to international trade. China&#x27;s rigid merchant hierarchy also blocked efforts to open ports to foreign ships and businesses. Chinese merchants operating in inland China wanted to avoid market fluctuations caused by importing foreign goods that would compete with domestic production, while the Cohong families of Guangzhou profited greatly by keeping their city the only entry point for foreign products.

At the turn of the 19th century, countries such as Great Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Russia, and the United States began to seek additional trading rights in China. Foremost among the concerns of the western nations was the end of the Canton System and the opening of China&#x27;s vast consumer markets to trade. Britain in particular was keenly increasing its exports to China, as the empire&#x27;s implementation of the gold standard forced it to purchase silver and gold from continental Europe and Mexico to further fuel its rapidly industrialising economy. Attempts by a British embassy (led by Macartney in 1793), a Dutch mission (under Jacob Pieter van Braam in 1794), Russia (headed by Yury Golovkin in 1805), and the British again (Earl William Amherst in 1816) to negotiate increased access to the Chinese market were all vetoed by successive Qing emperors. Upon his meeting the Jiaqing Emperor in 1816, Amherst refused to perform the traditional kowtow, an act that the Qing saw as a severe breach of etiquette. Amherst and his party were expelled from China, a diplomatic rebuke that angered the British government.

One major reason was that British consumers had developed a strong liking for Chinese tea, as well as other goods like porcelain and silk. But Chinese consumers had no similar preference for any goods produced in Britain. Because of this trade imbalance, Britain increasingly had to use silver to pay for its expanding purchases of Chinese goods. Britain suffered from a huge trade deficit during the Sino-British trade. Meanwhile, the high tariff made the British government very dissatisfied with the Qing government. The Chinese only allowed silver in exchange for the products they were offering so a significant amount of this commodity was leaving the British Empire.

As its merchants gained increasing influence in China, Great Britain bolstered its military strength in Southern China. Britain began sending warships to combat piracy on the Pearl River, and in 1808 established a permanent garrison of British troops in Macau to defend against French attacks.

=== Foreign merchants in Guangzhou ===
As the opium-fuelled China Trade increased in scope and value, the foreign presence in Guangzhou and Macau grew in size and influence. The Thirteen Factories district of Guangzhou continued to expand, and was labelled the &quot;foreign quarter&quot;. A small population of merchants began to stay in Guangzhou year round (most merchants lived in Macau for the summer months, then moved to Guangzhou in the winter), and a local chamber of commerce was formed. In the first two decades of the 19th century, the increasingly sophisticated (and profitable) trade between Europe and China allowed for a clique of European merchants to rise to positions of great importance in China. The most notable of these figures were William Jardine and James Matheson (who went on to found Jardine Matheson), British merchants who operated a consignment and shipping business in Guangzhou and Macau, with associates such as Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, who became their principal supplier in India. While all three dealt in legal goods, they also profited greatly from selling opium. Jardine in particular was effective in navigating the political environment of Guangzhou to allow for more narcotics to be smuggled into China. He was also contemptuous of the Chinese legal system, and often used his economic influence to subvert Chinese authorities. This included his (with Matheson&#x27;s support) petitioning for the British government to attempt to gain trading rights and political recognition from Imperial China, by force if necessary. In addition to trade, some western missionaries arrived and began to proselytise Christianity to the Chinese. While some officials tolerated this (Macau-based Jesuits had been active in China since the early 17th century), some officials clashed with Chinese Christians, raising tensions between western merchants and Qing officials.

While the foreign community in Guangzhou grew in influence, the local government began to suffer from civil discord inside China. The White Lotus Rebellion (1796–1804) drained the Qing dynasty&#x27;s treasury of silver, forcing the government to levy increasingly heavy taxes on merchants. These taxes did not abate after the rebellion was crushed, as the Chinese government began a massive project to repair state-owned properties on the Yellow River, referred to as the &quot;Yellow River Conservancy&quot;. The merchants of Guangzhou were further expected to make contributions to fight banditry. These taxes weighed heavily on the profits made by the Cohong merchants; by the 1830s, the once-prosperous Cohong had seen their wealth greatly reduced. In addition, the declining value of China&#x27;s domestic currency resulted in many people in Guangzhou using foreign silver coins (Spanish coins were the most valued, followed by American coins) as they contained higher amounts of silver. Using western coins allowed Cantonese coiners to make many Chinese coins from melted-down western coins, greatly increasing the city&#x27;s wealth, and tax revenue while tying much of the economy of the city to the foreign merchants.

A significant development came in 1834 when reformers (some of whom were financially backed by Jardine) in Britain, advocating for free trade, succeeded in ending the monopoly of the British East India Company under the Charter Act of the previous year. This shift in trade policy ended the need for merchants to comply with the royal charter for trade in the far east; with this centuries-old restriction lifted, the British China trade was opened to private entrepreneurs, many of whom joined the highly profitable opium trade.

On the eve of the Qing government&#x27;s crackdown on opium, a Chinese official described the changes in society caused by the drug;

 At the beginning, opium smoking was confined to the fops of wealthy families who took up the habit as a form of conspicuous consumption, even they knew that they should not indulge in it to the greatest extreme. Later, people of all social strata—from government officials and members of the gentry to craftsmen, merchants, entertainers, and servants, and even women, Buddhist monks and nuns, and Taoist priests—took up the habit and openly bought and equipped themselves with smoking instruments. Even in the center of our dynasty—the nation&#x27;s capital and its surrounding areas—some of the inhabitants have also been contaminated by this dreadful poison.

==== Napier Affair ====
In late 1834, to accommodate the revocation of the East India Company&#x27;s monopoly, the British sent William John Napier to Macau along with John Francis Davis and Sir George Robinson, 2nd Baronet, as British superintendents of trade in China. Napier was instructed to obey Chinese regulations, communicate directly with Chinese authorities, superintend trade pertaining to the contraband trade of opium, and to survey China&#x27;s coastline. Upon his arrival in China, Napier tried to circumvent the restrictive system that forbade direct contact with Chinese officials by sending a letter directly to the Viceroy of Liangguang, Lu Kun, requesting a meeting. The Viceroy refused to accept it, and on 2 September of that year an edict was issued that temporarily closed British trade. In response, Napier ordered two Royal Navy vessels to bombard Chinese forts on the Pearl River straight, the &quot;Bocca Tigris&quot;, in a show of force. This command was followed through, but war was avoided due to Napier falling ill with typhus and ordering a retreat. The brief gunnery duel drew condemnation by the Chinese government, as well as criticism from the British government and foreign merchants. Other nationalities, such as the Americans, prospered through their continued peaceful trade with China, but the British were told to leave Guangzhou for either Whampoa or Macau. Lord Napier was forced to return to Macau in September, where he died of typhus a month later, on 11 October.

After Lord Napier&#x27;s death, Captain Charles Elliot received the King&#x27;s Commission as Superintendent of Trade in 1836 to continue Napier&#x27;s work of conciliating the Chinese.

== Escalation of tensions ==

=== Crackdown on opium ===


By 1838, the British were selling roughly of opium per year to China. Legalization of the opium trade was the subject of ongoing debate within the Chinese administration, but a proposal to legalise the narcotic was repeatedly rejected, and in 1838 the government began to actively sentence Chinese drug traffickers to death.

There were also long-term factors that pushed the Chinese government into action. Historian Jonathan D. Spence lists these factors that led to war:
:the social dislocations that began to appear in the Qing world, the spread of addiction, the growth of a hard-line mentality toward foreigners, foreign refusal to accept Chinese legal norms, changes in international trade structures, and the ending of Western intellectuals&#x27; admiration for China... When the tough prohibitions of 1838 began to take effect, the market diminished and dealers found themselves dangerously oversupplied. A second contributing factor was that the new British post of superintendent of foreign trade in China was held by a deputy of the British crown...If the Chinese crossed the superintendent, they would be insulting the British nation rather than the business corporation...[The superintendent could] call directly on the aid of British armed Forces and the Royal Navy in times of serious trouble.

In 1839, the Daoguang Emperor appointed scholar-official Lin Zexu to the post of Special Imperial Commissioner with the task of eradicating the opium trade. Lin&#x27;s famous open &quot;Letter To Queen Victoria&quot; appealed to Queen Victoria&#x27;s moral reasoning. Citing what he mistakenly understood to be a strict prohibition on opium within Great Britain, Lin questioned how Britain could declare itself moral while its merchants profited from the legal sale in China of a drug that was banned in Britain. He wrote: &quot;Your Majesty has not before been thus officially notified, and you may plead ignorance of the severity of our laws, but I now give my assurance that we mean to cut this harmful drug forever.&quot; The letter never reached the Queen, with one source suggesting that it was lost in transit. Lin pledged that nothing would divert him from his mission, &quot;If the traffic in opium were not stopped a few decades from now we shall not only be without soldiers to resist the enemy, but also in want of silver to provide an army.&quot; Lin banned the sale of opium and demanded that all supplies of the drug be surrendered to the Chinese authorities. He also closed the Pearl River Channel, trapping British traders in Guangzhou. As well as seizing opium stockpiles in warehouses and the thirteen factories, Chinese troops boarded British ships in the Pearl River and South China Sea before destroying the opium on board.

The British Superintendent of Trade in China, Charles Elliot, protested the decision to forcibly seize the opium stockpiles. He ordered all ships carrying opium to flee and prepare for battle. Lin responded by besieging the foreign dealers in the foreign quarter of Guangzhou, and kept them from communicating with their ships in port. To defuse the situation, Elliot convinced the British traders to cooperate with Chinese authorities and hand over their opium stockpiles with the promise of eventual compensation for their losses by the British government. While this amounted to a tacit acknowledgment that the British government did not disapprove of the trade, it also placed a huge liability on the exchequer. This promise, and the inability of the British government to pay it without causing a political storm, was used as an important &quot;casus belli&quot; for the subsequent British attack. During April and May 1839, British and American dealers surrendered 20,283 chests and 200 sacks of opium. The stockpile was publicly destroyed on the beach outside Guangzhou.
After the opium was surrendered, trade was restarted on the strict condition that no more opium be shipped into China. Looking for a way to effectively police foreign trade and purge corruption, Lin and his advisers decided to reform the existing bond system. Under this system, a foreign captain and the &quot;Cohong&quot; merchant who had purchased the goods off of his ship swore that the vessel carried no illegal goods. Upon examining the records of the port, Lin was infuriated to find that in the 20 years since opium had been declared illegal, not a single infraction had been reported. As a consequence, Lin demanded that all foreign merchants and Qing officials sign a new bond promising not to deal in opium under penalty of death. The British government opposed their signing of the bond, feeling that it violated the principle of free trade, but some merchants who did not trade in opium (such as Olyphant &amp; Co.) were willing to sign against Elliot&#x27;s orders. Trade in regular goods continued unabated, and the scarcity of opium caused by the seizure of the foreign warehouses caused the black market to flourish. Some newly arrived merchant ships were able to learn of the ban on opium before they entered the Pearl River estuary, and so they unloaded their cargoes at Lintin Island. The opportunity caused by the sharp rise in the price of opium was seized upon by some of the &quot;Cohong&quot; trading houses and smugglers, who were able to evade commissioner Lin&#x27;s efforts and smuggled more opium into China. Superintendent Elliot was aware of the smugglers&#x27; activities on Lintin and was under orders to stop them, but feared that any action by the Royal Navy could spark a war and withheld his ships.

=== Skirmish at Kowloon ===

In early July 1839 a group of British merchant sailors in Kowloon became intoxicated after consuming rice liqueur. Two of the sailors became agitated with and beat to death Lin Weixi, a villager from nearby Tsim Sha Tsui. Superintendent Elliot ordered the arrest of the two men, and paid compensation to Lin&#x27;s family and village. However, he refused a request to turn the sailors over to Chinese authorities, fearing they would be killed in accordance with the Chinese legal code. Commissioner Lin saw this as an obstruction of justice and Chinese sovereignty, therefore he ordered the sailors to be handed over. Elliot instead held a trial for the accused men aboard a warship at sea, with himself serving as the judge and merchant captains serving as jurors. He invited the Qing authorities to observe and comment on the proceedings, but the offer was declined. The naval court convicted 5 sailors of assault and rioting, and sentenced them to fines along with hard labour in Britain (a verdict later overturned in British courts).
Angered by the violation of China&#x27;s sovereignty, Lin recalled Chinese labourers from Macau and issued an edict preventing the sale of food to the British. War Junks were deployed to the mouth of the Pearl River, while signs were placed and rumours spread by the Qing that they had poisoned the freshwater springs traditionally used to restock foreign merchant ships. On 23 August a ship belonging to a prominent opium merchant was attacked by lascar pirates while travelling downriver from Guangzhou to Macau. Rumors spread among the British that it had been Chinese soldiers who had attacked the ship, and Elliot ordered all British ships to leave the coast of China by 24 August. That same day Macau barred British ships from its harbour at the request of Lin. The commissioner travelled in person to the city, where he was welcomed by some of the inhabitants as a hero who had restored law and order. The flight from Macau ensured that by the end of August over 60 British ships and over 2000 people were idling off of the Chinese coast, fast running out of provisions. On 30 August HMS &quot;Volage&quot; arrived to defend the fleet from a potential Chinese attack, and Elliot warned Qing authorities in Kowloon that the embargo on food and water must be ended soon.

Early on 4 September Elliot dispatched an armed schooner and a cutter to Kowloon to buy provisions from Chinese peasants. The two ships approached three Chinese war junks in the harbour and requested permission to land men in order to procure supplies. The British were allowed through and basic necessities were provided to the British by Chinese sailors, but the Chinese commander inside Kowloon fort refused to allow the locals to trade with the British and confined the townspeople inside the settlement. The situation grew more intense as the day went on, and in the afternoon Elliot issued an ultimatum that, if the Chinese refused to allow the British to purchase supplies, they would be fired upon. A 3:00 pm deadline set by Elliot passed and the British ships opened fire on the Chinese vessels. The junks returned fire, and Chinese gunners on land began to fire at the British ships. Nightfall ended the battle, and the Chinese junks withdrew, ending what would be known as the Battle of Kowloon. Many British officers wanted to launch a land attack on Kowloon fort the next day, but Elliot decided against it, stating that such an action would cause &quot;great injury and irritation&quot; to the town&#x27;s inhabitants. After the skirmish, Elliot circulated a paper in Kowloon, reading;

Having driven off the Chinese ships, the British fleet began to purchase provisions from the local villagers, often with the aid of bribed Chinese officials in Kowloon. Lai Enjue, the local commander at Kowloon, declared that a victory had been won against the British. He claimed that a two masted British warship had been sunk, and that 40–50 British had been killed. He also reported that the British had been unable to acquire supplies, and his reports severely understated the strength of the Royal Navy.

=== Battle of Chuenpi ===

In late October 1839, the merchant ship &quot;Thomas Coutts&quot; arrived in China and sailed to Guangzhou. &quot;Thomas Coutts&quot;″s Quaker owners refused on religious grounds to deal in opium, a fact that the Chinese authorities were aware of. The ship&#x27;s captain, Warner, believed Elliot had exceeded his legal authority by banning the signing of the &quot;no opium trade&quot; bond, and negotiated with the governor of Guangzhou. Warner hoped that all British ships not carrying opium could negotiate to legally unload their goods at Chuenpi, an island near Humen.

To prevent other British ships from following &quot;Thomas Coutts&quot;″s precedent, Elliot ordered a blockade of British shipping in the Pearl River. Fighting began on 3 November 1839, when a second British ship, , attempted to sail to Guangzhou. The Royal Navy ships HMS &quot;Volage&quot; and HMS &quot;Hyacinth&quot; fired warning shots at &quot;Royal Saxon&quot;. In response to this commotion, a fleet of Chinese war junks under the command of Guan Tianpei sailed out to protect &quot;Royal Saxon&quot;. The ensuing Battle of Chuenpi resulted in the destruction of 4 Chinese war junks and the withdrawal of both fleets. The Qing navy&#x27;s official report on the Battle of Chuenpi claimed that the navy had protected the British merchant vessel and reported a great victory for the day. In reality, the Chinese had been out-classed by the British vessels and several Chinese ships were disabled. Elliot reported that his squadron was protecting the 29 British ships in Chuenpi, and began to prepare for the Qing reprisal. Fearing that the Chinese would reject any contacts with the British and eventually attack with fire rafts, he ordered all ships to leave Chuenpi and head for Causeway Bay, from Macau, hoping that offshore anchorages would be out of range of Lin. Elliot asked Adrião Acácio da Silveira Pinto, the Portuguese governor of Macau, to let British ships load and unload their goods there in exchange for paying rents and any duties. The governor refused for fear that the Chinese would discontinue supplying food and other necessities to Macau, and on 14 January 1840 the Daoguang Emperor asked all foreign merchants in China to halt material assistance to the British.

=== Reaction in Britain ===

==== Parliamentary debates ====
Following the Chinese crackdown on the opium trade, discussion arose as to how Britain would respond, as the public in the United States and Britain had previously expressed outrage that Britain was supporting the opium trade. The East India and China Association of London argued that the opium trade was directly or indirectly sanctioned by the government, and as such they should compensate them for their losses. Elliot signed certificates guaranteeing payment for the surrendered opium with the assumption that China would pay for it. This provided legal basis for the merchants to demand an indemnity from the British government, which they could either force China to pay or pay for it from the British treasury. As the government had no funds to pay such indemnities, they favoured forcing China to pay since Elliot had provided them with plausible justification for a China Expedition. Many British citizens sympathised with the Chinese and wanted to halt the sale of opium, while others wanted to contain or regulate the international narcotics trade. However, a great deal of anger was expressed over the treatment of British diplomats and towards the protectionist trading policies of Qing China. The Whig controlled government in particular advocated war with China, and the pro-Whig press printed stories about Chinese &quot;despotism and cruelty&quot;. This line of reasoning was primary defence for war with China.
Since August 1839, reports had been published in London newspapers about troubles at Guangzhou and the impending war with China. The Queen&#x27;s Annual Address to the House of Lords on 16 January 1840 expressed the concern that &quot;Events have happened in China which have occasioned an interruption of the commercial intercourse of my subjects with that country. I have given, and shall continue to give, the most serious attention to a matter so deeply affecting the interests of my subjects and the dignity of my Crown.&quot;

The Whig Melbourne Government was then in a weak political situation. It barely survived a motion of non-confidence on 31 January 1840 by a majority of 21. The Tories saw the China Question as an opportunity to beat the Government, and James Graham moved a motion on 7 April 1840 in the House of Commons, censuring the Government&#x27;s &quot;want of foresight and precaution&quot; and &quot;their neglect to furnish the superintendent at Guangzhou with powers and instructions&quot; to deal with the opium trade. This was a deliberate move of the Tories to avoid the sensitive issues of war and opium trade and to obtain maximum support for the motion within the party. Calls for military action were met with mixed responses when the matter went before Parliament. Foreign Secretary Palmerston, a politician known for his aggressive foreign policy and advocacy for free trade, led the pro war camp. Palmerston strongly believed that the destroyed opium should be considered property, not contraband, and as such reparations had to be made for its destruction. He justified military action by saying that no one could &quot;say that he honestly believed the motive of the Chinese Government to have been the promotion of moral habits&quot; and that the war was being fought to stem China&#x27;s balance of payments deficit. After consulting with William Jardine, the foreign secretary drafted a letter to Prime Minister William Melbourne calling for a military response. Other merchants called for an opening of free trade with China, and it was commonly cited that the Chinese consumers were the driving factor of the opium trade. The periodic expulsion of British merchants from Guangzhou and the refusal of the Qing government to treat Britain as a diplomatic equal were seen as a slight to national pride.

Few Tory or liberal politicians supported the war. Sir James Graham, Lord Phillip Stanhope, and William Ewart Gladstone headed the anti-war faction in Britain, and denounced the ethics of the opium trade. After three days of debate, the vote was taken on Graham&#x27;s motion on 9 April 1840, which was defeated by a majority of only 9 votes (262 votes for vs 271 votes against ). The Tories in the House of Commons thus failed to deter the Government from proceeding with the war and stop the British warships already on their way to China. The House of Commons agreed on 27 July 1840 to a resolution of granting £173,442 for the expenses of the expedition to China, long after the war with China had broken out.

==== Cabinet Decision and Palmerston letters ====
Under strong pressure and lobbying from various trade and manufacturer associations, the Whig cabinet under Prime Minister Melbourne decided on 1 October 1839 to send an expedition to China. War preparations then began.

In early November 1839, Palmerston instructed Auckland, Governor General of India, to prepare military forces for deployment in China. On 20 February 1840 Palmerston (who remained unaware of the First Battle of Chuenpi in November 1839) drafted two letters detailing the British response to the situation in China. One letter was addressed to the Elliots, the other to the Daoguang Emperor and the Qing government. The letter to the emperor informed China that Great Britain had sent a military expeditionary force to the Chinese coast. In the letter, Palmerston stated that,

These measures of hostility on the part of Great Britain against China are not only justified, but even rendered absolutely necessary, by the outrages which have been committed by the Chinese Authorities against British officers and Subjects, and these hostilities will not cease, until a satisfactory arrangement shall have been made by the Chinese Government.

In his letter to the Elliots, Palmerston instructed the commanders to set up a blockade of the Pearl River and forward to a Chinese official the letter from Palmerston addressing the Chinese emperor. They were to then capture the Zhoushan Islands, blockade the mouth of the Yangtze River, start negotiations with Qing officials, and finally sail the fleet into the Bohai Sea, where they would send another copy of the aforementioned letter to Beijing. Palmerston also issued a list of objectives that the British government wanted accomplished, with said objectives being:
* Demand to be treated with the respect due to a royal envoy by the Qing authorities.
* Secure the right of the British superintendent to administer justice to British subjects in China.
* Seek recompense for destroyed British property.
* Gain most favoured trading status with the Chinese government.
* Request the right for foreigners to safely inhabit and own private property in China.
* Ensure that, if contraband is seized in accordance with Chinese law, no harm comes to the person(s) of British subjects carrying illicit goods in China.
* End the system by which British merchants are restricted to trading solely in Guangzhou.
* Ask that the cities of Guangzhou, Amoy, Shanghai, Ningbo, and the province of northern Formosa be freely opened to trade from all foreign powers.
* Secure islands along the Chinese coast that can be easily defended and provisioned, or exchange captured islands for favourable trading terms.
Lord Palmerston left it to Superintendent Elliot&#x27;s discretion as to how these objectives would be fulfilled, but noted that while negotiation would be a preferable outcome, he did not trust that diplomacy would succeed, writing;

To sum up in a few words the result of this Instruction, you will see, from what I have stated, that the British Government demands from that of China satisfaction for the past and security for the future; and does not choose to trust to negotiation for obtaining either of these things; but has sent out a Naval and Military Force with orders to begin at once to take the Measures necessary for attaining the object in view.

== War ==

=== Opening moves ===
The Chinese naval forces in Guangzhou were under the command of Admiral Guan Tianpei, who had fought the British at Chuenpi. The Qing southern army and garrisons were under the command of General Yang Fang. Overall command was invested in the Daoguang Emperor and his court. The Chinese government initially believed that, as in the 1834 Napier Affair, the British had been successfully expelled. Few preparations were made for a British reprisal, and the events leading to the eventual outbreak of the Sino-Sikh War in 1841 were seen as a greater cause for concern.

Left without a major base of operations in China, the British withdrew their merchant shipping from the region while maintaining the Royal Navy&#x27;s China squadron in the islands around the mouth of the Pearl River. From London, Palmerston continued to dictate operations in China, ordering the East India Company to divert troops from India in preparation for a limited war against the Chinese. It was decided that the war would not be fought as a full-scale conflict, but rather as a punitive expedition. Superintendent Elliot remained in charge of Britain&#x27;s interests in China, while Commodore Gordon Bremer led the Royal Marines and the China Squadron. Major General Hugh Gough was selected to command the British land forces, and was promoted to overall commander of British forces in China. The cost of the war would be paid by the British Government. Per Lord Palmerston&#x27;s letter, plans were drawn up by the British to launch a series of attacks on Chinese ports and rivers.

British plans to form an expeditionary force were started immediately after the January 1840 vote. Several infantry regiments were raised in the British isles, and the completion of ships already under construction was expedited. To conduct the upcoming war, Britain also began to draw on forces from its overseas empire. British India had been preparing for a war since word had arrived that the opium had been destroyed, and several regiments of Bengali volunteers had been recruited to supplement the regular British Indian Army and East India Company forces. In terms of naval forces, the ships earmarked for the expedition were either posted in remote colonies or under repair, and Oriental Crisis of 1840 (and the resulting risk of war between Britain, France, and the Ottoman Empire over Syria) drew the attention of the Royal Navy&#x27;s European fleets away from China. Orders were dispatched to British South Africa and Australia to send ships to Singapore, the assigned rendezvous point for the expedition. A number of steamers were purchased by the Royal Navy and attached to the expedition as transports. The unseasonable summer weather of India and the Strait of Malacca slowed the British deployment, and a number of accidents decreased the combat readiness of the expedition. Most notably, both of the 74-gun ships of the line that the Royal Navy intended to use against Chinese fortifications were temporarily put out of action by hull damage. Despite these delays, by mid-June 1840 British forces had begun to assemble in Singapore. While they waited for more ships to arrive, the Royal Marines practised amphibious invasions on the beach, first by landing ashore in boats, then forming lines and advancing on mock fortifications.

=== British offensive begins ===
In late June 1840 the first part of the expeditionary force arrived in China aboard 15 barracks ships, four steam-powered gunboats and 25 smaller boats. The flotilla was under the command of Commodore Bremer. The British issued an ultimatum demanding the Qing Government pay compensation for losses suffered from interrupted trade and the destruction of opium, but were rebuffed by the Qing authorities in Guangzhou.

In his letters, Palmerston had instructed the joint plenipotentiaries Elliot and his cousin Admiral George Elliot to acquire the cession of at least one island for trade on the Chinese coast. With the British expeditionary force now in place, a combined naval and ground assault was launched on the Zhoushan (Chusan) Archipelago. Zhoushan Island, the largest and best defended of the islands was the primary target for the attack, as was its vital port of Dinghai. When the British fleet arrived off Zhoushan, Elliot demanded the city surrender. The commander of the Chinese garrison refused the command, stating that he could not surrender and questioning what reason the British had for harassing Dinghai, as they had been driven out of Guangzhou. Fighting began, a fleet of 12 small junks was destroyed by the Royal Navy, and British marines captured the hills to the south of Dinghai.

The British captured the city itself after an intense naval bombardment on 5 July forced the surviving Chinese defenders to withdraw. The British occupied Dinghai harbour and prepared to use it as a staging point for operations in China. In the fall of 1840 disease broke out in the Dinghai garrison, forcing the British to evacuate soldiers to Manila and Kolkata. By the beginning of 1841 only 1900 of the 3300 men who had originally occupied Dinghai were left, with many of those remaining incapable of fighting. An estimated 500 British soldiers died from disease, with the Cameron and Bengali volunteers suffering the most deaths, while the Royal Marines were relatively unscathed.

Having captured Dinghai, the British expedition divided its forces, sending one fleet south to the Pearl River while sending a second fleet north to the Yellow Sea. The northern fleet sailed to the Hai River, where Elliot personally presented Palmerston&#x27;s letter to the emperor to Qing authorities from the capital. Qishan, a high-ranking Manchu official, was selected by the Imperial Court to replace Lin as the Viceroy of Liangguang after the latter was discharged for his failure to resolve the opium situation. Negotiations began between the two sides, with Qishan serving as the primary negotiator for the Qing and Elliot serving as the representative for the British Crown. After a week of negotiations, Qishan and Elliot agreed to relocate to the Pearl River for further negotiations. In return for the courtesy of the British to withdraw from the Yellow Sea, Qishan promised to requisition imperial funds as restitution for British merchants who had suffered damages. The war, however, was not concluded and both sides continued to engage each other. In the late spring of 1841 reinforcements arrived from India in preparation for an offensive against Guangzhou. A flotilla of transports brought 600 men of the professionally trained 37th Madras Native Infantry to Dinghai, where their arrival boosted British morale. Accompanying the fleet as far as Macau was the newly constructed iron steamer HMS &quot;Nemesis&quot;, a weapon to which the Chinese navy had no effective counter. On 19 August three British warships and 380 marines drove the Chinese from the land bridge (known as &quot;The Barrier&quot;) separating Macau from the Chinese mainland. The defeat of the Qing soldiers coupled with the arrival of the &quot;Nemesis&quot; in Macau&#x27;s harbour resulted in a wave of pro-British support in the city, and several Qing officials were driven out or killed. Portugal remained neutral in the conflict, but after the battle was willing to allow British ships to dock in Macau, a decision that granted the British a functioning port in Southern China. With the strategic harbours of Dinghai and Macau secured, the British began to focus on the war on the Pearl River. Five months after the British victory at Chusan, the northern elements of the expedition sailed south to Humen, known to the British as The Bogue. Bremer judged that gaining control of the Pearl River and Guangzhou would put the British in a strong negotiating position with the Qing authorities, as well as allow for the renewal of trade when the war ended.

=== Pearl River campaign ===
While the British campaigned in the north, Qing Admiral Guan Tianpei greatly reinforced the Qing positions in Humen (Bocca Tigris), suspecting that the British would attempt to force their way up the Pearl River to Guangzhou; sources state that Guan had been preparing for an eventual attack on the position since Napier&#x27;s attack in 1835. The Humen forts blocked transit of the river, and were garrisoned with 3000 men and 306 cannons. By the time the British fleet was ready for action, 10,000 Qing soldiers were in position to defend Guangzhou and the surrounding area. The British fleet arrived in early January, and began to bombard the Qing defences at Chuenpi after a group of Chinese fire-rafts were sent drifting towards the Royal navy ships.

On 7 January 1841, the British won a decisive victory in the Second Battle of Chuenpi, destroying 11 Junks of the Chinese southern fleet and capturing the Humen forts. The victory allowed the British to set up a blockade of The Bogue, a blow that forced the Qing navy to retreat upriver.

Knowing the strategic value of Pearl River Delta to China and aware that British naval superiority made a reconquest of the region unlikely, Qishan attempted to prevent the war from widening further by negotiating a peace treaty with Britain. On 21 January Qishan and Elliot drafted the Convention of Chuenpi, a document which both parties hoped would end the war. The convention would establish equal diplomatic rights between Britain and China, exchange Hong Kong Island for Zhoushan, facilitate the release of shipwrecked and kidnapped British citizens held by the Chinese, and reopen trade in Guangzhou by 1 February 1841. China would also pay six million silver dollars as recompense for the opium destroyed at Humen in 1838. However, the legal status of the opium trade was not resolved and instead left open to be discussed at a future date. Despite the success of the negotiations between Qishan and Elliot, both of their respective governments refused to sign the convention. The Daoguang Emperor was infuriated that Qing territory would be given up in a treaty that had been signed without his permission, and ordered Qishan arrested (he was later sentenced to death; the sentence was then commuted to military service.) Lord Palmerston recalled Elliot from his post and refused to sign the convention, wanting more concessions to be forced from the Chinese per his original instructions.

The brief interlude in the fighting ended in the beginning of February after the Chinese refused to reopen Guangzhou to British trade. On 19 February a longboat from HMS &quot;Nemesis&quot; came under fire from a fort on North Wangtong Island, prompting a British response. The British commanders ordered another blockade of the Pearl River and resumed combat operations against the Chinese. The British captured the remaining Bogue forts on 26 February during the Battle of the Bogue and the Battle of First Bar on the following day, allowing the fleet to move further upriver towards Guangzhou. Admiral Tianpei was killed in action during the fighting on 26 February. On 2 March the British destroyed a Qing fort near Pazhou and captured Whampoa, an action that directly threatened Guangzhou&#x27;s east flank. Major General Gough, who had recently arrived from Madras aboard , personally directed the attack on Whampoa. Superintendent Elliot (who was unaware that he had been dismissed), and the Governor-General of Guangzhou declared a 3-day truce on 3 March. Between the 3rd and the 6th the British forces that had evacuated Zhoushan per the Convention of Chuenpi arrived in the Pearl River. The Chinese military was likewise reinforced, and by 16 March General Yang Fang commanded 30,000 men in the area surrounding Guangzhou.

While the main British fleet prepared to sail up the Pearl River to Guangzhou, a group of three warships departed for the Xi River estuary, intending to navigate the waterway between Macau and Guangzhou. The fleet, led by Captain James Scott and Superintendent Elliot, was composed of the frigate and the steamships &quot;HMS Nemesis&quot; and . Although the waterway was in places only 6 feet deep, the shallow drafts of the steamships allowed the British to approach Guangzhou from a direction the Qing believed to be impossible. In a series of engagements along the river from 13 to 15 March, the British captured or destroyed Chinese ships, guns, and military equipment. 9 junks, 6 fortresses, and 105 guns were destroyed or captured in what was known as the Broadway expedition.
With the Pearl River cleared of Chinese defences, the British debated advancing on Guangzhou. Although the truce had ended on 6 March, Superintendent Elliot believed that the British should negotiate with the Qing authorities from their current position of strength rather than risk a battle in Guangzhou. The Qing army made no aggressive moves against the British and instead began to fortify the city. Chinese military engineers began to establish a number of mud earthworks on the riverbank, sank junks to create blockships on the river, and started constructing fire rafts and gunboats. Chinese merchants were ordered to remove all of the silk and tea from Guangzhou to impede trade, and the local populace was barred from selling food to the British ships on the river. On 16 March a British ship approaching a Chinese fort under a flag of truce was fired upon, leading to the British setting the fort on fire with rockets. These actions convinced Elliot that the Chinese were preparing to fight, and following the return of the ships of the Broadway expedition to the fleet, the British attacked Guangzhou on 18 March, taking the Thirteen Factories with very few casualties and raising the Union Jack above the British factory. The city was partially occupied by the British and trade was reopened after negotiation with the &quot;Cohong&quot; merchants. After several days of further military successes, British forces commanded the high ground around Guangzhou. Another truce was declared on 20 March. Against the advice of some of his captains, Elliot withdrew most of the Royal Navy warships downriver to the Bocca Tigris.
In mid-April, Yishan (Qishan&#x27;s replacement as Viceroy of Liangguang and the Daoguang Emperor&#x27;s cousin) arrived in Guangzhou. He declared that trade should continue to remain open, sent emissaries to Elliot, and began to gather military assets outside Guangzhou. The Qing army camped outside of the city soon numbered 50,000, and the money earned from the reopened trade was spent repairing and expanding Guangzhou&#x27;s defences. Concealed artillery batteries were built along the Pearl River, Chinese soldiers were deployed in Whampoa and the Bocca Tigris, and hundreds of small river craft were armed for war. A bulletin sent from the Daoguang Emperor commanded the Qing forces to &quot;Exterminate the rebels at all points&quot;, and orders were given to drive the British from the Pearl River before reclaiming Hong Kong and driving the invaders out of China altogether. This order was leaked and became widely circulated in Guangzhou among foreign merchants, who were already suspicious of Chinese intentions after learning of the Qing military build-up. In May many &quot;Cohong&quot; merchants and their families left the city, raising further concerns about a renewal of hostilities. Rumours spread that Chinese divers were being trained to drill holes in the hulls of British ships, and that fleets of fire rafts were being prepared for deployment against the Royal Navy. During the build-up, the Qing army was weakened by infighting between units and lack of confidence in Yishan, who openly distrusted Cantonese civilians and soldiers, instead choosing to rely on forces drawn from other Chinese provinces. On 20 May, Yishan issued a statement, asking the &quot;people of Canton, and all foreign merchants who are respectfully obedient, not to tremble with alarm and be frightened out of their wits at the military hosts that are gathering around, there being no probability of hostilities.&quot; The next day Elliot requested that all British merchants evacuate the city by sundown, and several warships were recalled to their positions in front of Guangzhou.

On the night of 21 May the Qing launched a coordinated night attack on the British army and navy. Artillery batteries hidden in Guangzhou and on the Pearl River (many of which the British believed they had disabled earlier) opened fire, and Qing soldiers retook the British Factory. A large formation of 200 fire rafts connected by a chain was sent drifting towards the British ships at Guangzhou, and fishing boats armed with matchlocks began to engage the Royal Navy. The British warships were able to evade the attack, and stray rafts set Guangzhou&#x27;s waterfront on fire, illuminating the river and foiling the night attack. Downriver at Whampoa the Chinese attacked the British vessels at anchor there and attempted to prevent ships from reaching Guangzhou. Having suspected an attack, and as a consequence delaying his own offensive, Major General Gough consolidated the British forces at Hong Kong and ordered a rapid advance upriver to Guangzhou. These reinforcements arrived on 25 May, and the British counter-attacked, taking the last four Qing forts above Guangzhou and bombarding the city.

The Qing army fled in panic when the city heights were taken, and the British pursued them into the countryside. On 29 May a crowd of around 20,000 villagers and townspeople attacked and defeated a foraging company of 60 Indian sepoys in what became known as the Sanyuanli Incident, and Gough ordered a retreat back to the river. The fighting subsided on 30 May 1841, and Guangzhou came fully under British occupation. Following the capture of Guangzhou, the British command and the governor-general of Guangzhou agreed to a cease-fire in the region. Under the terms of the limited peace (later widely referred to as &quot;The Ransom of Canton&quot;), the British were paid to withdraw beyond the Bogue forts, an action they completed by 31 May. Elliott signed the peace treaty without consulting the British army or Navy, an act which displeased General Gough.

The defence of Guangzhou was declared a diplomatic success by Yishan. In a letter to the emperor, he wrote that the barbarians had begged &quot;the chief general that he would implore the great emperor in their behalf, that he would have mercy upon them, and cause their debts to be repaid them, and graciously permit them to carry on their commerce, when they would immediately withdraw their ships from the Bocca Tigris, and never dare again to raise any disturbance.&quot; However, General Yang Fang was reprimanded by the emperor for his agreeing to a truce rather than forcefully resisting the British. The emperor was not informed the British expedition had not been defeated and was very much intact. The imperial court continued to debate China&#x27;s next course of action for the war, as the Daoguang Emperor wanted Hong Kong retaken.

=== Central China ===
Following their withdrawal from Guangzhou, the British relocated the expeditionary force to Hong Kong. Just as with the Chinese commanders, the British leaders debated how the war should be continued. Elliot wanted to cease military operations and reopen trade, while Major General Gough wanted to capture the city of Amoy and blockade the Yangtze River. In July, a typhoon struck Hong Kong, damaging British ships in the harbour and destroying some of the facilities the expedition was building on the island. The situation changed when, on 29 July, Elliot was informed that he had been replaced as Superintendent by Henry Pottinger, who arrived in Hong Kong on 10 August to begin his administration. Pottinger wanted to negotiate terms with the Qing for the entire country of China, rather than just the Pearl River, and so he turned away Chinese envoys from Guangzhou and gave permission for the expeditionary force to proceed with its war plans. Admiral William Parker, 1st Baronet of Shenstone also arrived in Hong Kong to replace Humphrey Fleming Senhouse (who had died of a fever on 29 June) as the commander of the British naval forces in China. It was agreed by the British commanders that combat operations should be moved north to put pressure on Peking, and on 21 August the fleet sailed for Amoy. On 25 August, the British fleet entered the Jiulong River estuary and arrived at Amoy. The city was prepared for a naval assault, as Qing military engineers had built several artillery batteries into the granite cliffs overlooking the river. A purely naval assault was considered too risky by Parker, prompting Gough to order a combined naval and ground attack on the defences. On 26 August British marines and regular infantry under the covering fire of the Royal Navy flanked and destroyed the Chinese defences guarding the river. Several large British ships failed to destroy the largest of the Chinese batteries, which withstood over 12,000 cannonballs being fired at it, so the position was scaled and captured by the British infantry. The city of Amoy was abandoned on 27 August, and British soldiers entered the inner town where they blew up the citadel&#x27;s powder magazine. 26 Chinese junks and 128 cannons were captured, with the captured guns being thrown into the river by the British. As Lord Palmerston wanted Amoy to become an international trade port at the end of the war, Gough ordered that no looting be tolerated and had officers enforce the death penalty for anyone found to be plundering. However, many Chinese merchants refused to ask for British protection out of fear of being branded as traitors to the Qing dynasty. The British withdrew to an island on the river, where they established a small garrison and blockaded the Jiulong River. With the city empty of any army, peasants, criminals, and deserters looted the town. The Qing army retook the city and restored order several days later, after which the city governor declared that a victory had been won and 5 British ships sunk.

In Britain, changes in Parliament resulted in Lord Palmerston being removed from his post as Foreign Minister on 30 August. William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne replaced him, and sought a more measured approach to the situation in China. Lamb remained a supporter of the war.

In September 1841, the British transport ship &quot;Nerbudda&quot; was shipwrecked on a reef off the northern coast of Formosa after a brief gunnery duel with a Chinese fort. This sinking was followed by the loss of the brig &quot;Ann&quot; on another reef in March 1842. The survivors of both ships were captured and marched to southern Taiwan, where they were imprisoned. 197 were executed by Qing authorities on 10 August 1842, while an additional 87 died from ill-treatment in captivity. This became known as the Nerbudda incident.
October saw the British solidify their control over the central Chinese coast. Zhoushan had been exchanged for Hong Kong on the authority of Qishan in January 1841, after which the island had been re-garrisoned by the Qing. Fearing that the Chinese would improve the island&#x27;s defences, the British began a military invasion. The British attacked the Qing on 1 October. The battle of the Second Capture of Chusan ensued. The British forces killed 1500 Qing soldiers and captured Zhoushan. The victory reestablished British control over Dinghai&#x27;s important harbour.

On 10 October, a British naval force bombarded and captured a fort on the outskirts of Ningbo in central China. A battle broke out between the British army and a Chinese force of 1500 men on the road between the town of Chinhai and Ningbo, during which the Chinese were routed. Following the defeat, Chinese authorities evacuated Ningbo and the empty city was taken by the British on 13 October. An imperial cannon manufactory in the city was captured by the British, reducing the ability of the Qing to replace their lost equipment, and the fall of the city threatened the nearby Qiantang River. The capture of Ningbo forced the British command to examine their policy towards occupied Chinese territory and prizes of war. Admiral Parker and Superintendent Pottinger wanted a percentage of all captured Chinese property to be turned over to the British as legal prizes of war, while General Gough argued that this would only turn the Chinese population against the British, and that if property had to be seized, it should be public property rather than private. British policy eventually settled that 10% of all property captured by the British expeditionary forces would be seized as war loot in retaliation for injustices done to British merchants. Gough later stated that this edict would compel his men to &quot;punish one set of robbers for the benefit of another.&quot;

Fighting ceased for the winter of 1841 while the British resupplied. False reports sent by Yishan to the emperor in Beijing resulted in the continued British threat being downplayed. In late 1841 the Daoguang Emperor discovered that his officials in Guangzhou and Amoy had been sending him embellished reports. He ordered the governor of Guangxi, Liang Chang-chü, to send him clear accounts of the events in Guangzhou, noting that since Guangxi was a neighbouring province, Liang must be receiving independent accounts. He warned Liang that he would be able to verify his information by obtaining secret inquiries from other places. Yishan was recalled to the capital and faced trial by the imperial court, which removed him from command. Now aware of the severity of the British threat, Chinese towns and cities began to fortify against naval incursions.

In the spring of 1842 the Daoguang Emperor ordered his cousin Yijing to retake the city of Ningbo. In the ensuing Battle of Ningpo on 10 March, the British garrison repelled the assault with rifle fire and naval artillery. At Ningbo the British lured the Qing army into the city streets before opening fire, resulting in heavy Chinese casualties. The British pursued the retreating Chinese army, capturing the nearby city of Cixi on 15 March.

The important harbour of Zhapu was captured on 18 May in the Battle of Chapu. A British fleet bombarded the town, forcing its surrender. A holdout of 300 soldiers of the Eight Banners stalled the advance of British army for several hours, an act of heroism that was commended by Gough.

=== Yangtze campaign ===
With many Chinese ports now blockaded or under British occupation, Major General Gough sought to cripple the finances of the Qing Empire by striking up the Yangtze River. 25 warships and 10,000 men were assembled at Ningbo and Zhapu in May for a planned advance into the Chinese interior. The expedition&#x27;s advance ships sailed up the Yangtze, and captured the emperor&#x27;s tax barges, a devastating blow that slashed the revenue of the imperial court in Beijing to a fraction of what it had been.
On 14 June, the mouth of the Huangpu River was captured by the British fleet. On 16 June, the Battle of Woosung occurred, after which the British captured the towns of Wusong and Baoshan. The undefended outskirts of Shanghai were occupied by the British on 19 June. Following the battle, Shanghai was looted by retreating Qing bannermen, British soldiers, and local civilians. Qing admiral Chen Huacheng was killed while defending a fort in Woosong.

The fall of Shanghai left the vital city of Nanjing vulnerable. The Qing amassed an army of 56,000 Manchu bannermen and Han Green Standards to defend Liangjiang Province, and strengthened their river defences on the Yangtze. However, British naval activity in Northern China led to resources and manpower being withdrawn to defend against a feared attack on Beijing. The Qing commander in Liangjiang Province released 16 British prisoners with the hope that a ceasefire could be reached, but poor communications led both the Qing and the British to reject any overtures at peace. In secret, the Daoguang Emperor considered signing a peace treaty with the British, but only in regards to the Yangtze River and not the war as a whole. Had it been signed, the British forces would have been paid to not enter the Yangtze River.

On 14 July, the British fleet on the Yangtze began to sail up the river. Reconnaissance alerted Gough to the logistical importance of the city of Zhenjiang, and plans were made to capture it. Most of the city&#x27;s guns had been relocated to Wusong and had been captured by the British when said city had been taken. The Qing commanders inside the city were disorganised, with Chinese sources stating that over 100 traitors were executed in Zhenjiang prior to the battle. The British fleet arrived off of the city on the morning of 21 July, and the Chinese forts defending the city were blasted apart. The Chinese defenders initially retreated into the surrounding hills, causing a premature British landing. Fighting erupted when thousands of Chinese soldiers emerged from the city, beginning the Battle of Chinkiang.

British engineers blew open the western gate and stormed into the city, where fierce street to street fighting ensued. Zhenjiang was devastated by the battle, with many Chinese soldiers and their families committing suicide rather than be taken prisoner. The British suffered their highest combat losses of the war (36 killed) taking the city.

After capturing Zhenjiang, the British fleet cut the vital Grand Canal, paralysing the Caoyun system and severely disrupting the Chinese ability to distribute grain throughout the Empire. The British departed Zhenjiang on 3 August, intending to sail to Nanking. They arrived outside the Jiangning District on 9 August, and were in position to assault the city by 11 August. Although explicit permission to negotiate had not yet been granted by the emperor, Qing officials inside the city agreed to a British request to negotiate.

=== Treaty of Nanking ===
On 14 August a Chinese delegation led by the Manchu high court official Keying and Llipu departed Nanking for the British fleet. Negotiations lasted for several weeks as the British delegation insisted the treaty be accepted by the Daoguang Emperor. The court advised the emperor to accept the treaty, and on 21 August the Daoguang Emperor authorised his diplomats to sign the peace treaty with the British. The First Opium war officially ended on 29 August 1842 with the signing of the Treaty of Nanking. The document was signed by officials of the British and Qing empires aboard .
=== Technology and tactics ===

==== British ====
The British military superiority during the conflict drew heavily on the strength of the Royal Navy.

British warships carried more guns than their Chinese opponents and were manoeuvrable enough to evade Chinese boarding actions. Steam ships such as the &quot;Nemesis&quot; were able to move against winds and tides in Chinese rivers, and were armed with heavy guns and Congreve rockets. Several of the larger British warships in China (notably the third-rates HMS &quot;Cornwallis&quot;, HMS &quot;Wellesley&quot;, and HMS &quot;Melville&quot;) carried more guns than entire fleets of Chinese junks. British naval superiority allowed the Royal Navy to attack Chinese forts with very little risk to themselves, as British naval cannons out-ranged the vast majority of the Qing artillery.

British soldiers in China were equipped with Brunswick rifles and rifle-modified Brown Bess muskets, both of which possessed an effective firing range of 200–300 metres. British marines were equipped with percussion caps that greatly reduced weapon misfires and allowed firearms to be used in damp environments. In terms of gunpowder, the British formula was better manufactured and contained more sulphur than the Chinese mixture. This granted British weapons an advantage in terms of range, accuracy and projectile velocity. British artillery was lighter (owing to improved forging methods) and more manoeuvrable than the cannons used by the Chinese. As with the naval artillery, British guns out-ranged the Chinese cannon.

In terms of tactics, the British forces in China followed doctrines established during the Napoleonic Wars that had been adapted during the various colonial wars of the 1820s and 1830s. Many of the British soldiers deployed to China were veterans of colonial wars in India and had experience fighting larger but technologically inferior armies. In battle, the British line infantry would advance towards the enemy in columns, forming ranks once they had closed to firing range. Companies would commence firing volleys into the enemy ranks until they retreated. If a position needed to be taken, an advance or charge with bayonets would be ordered. Light infantry companies screened the line infantry formations, protecting their flanks and utilising skirmishing tactics to disrupt the enemy. British artillery was used to destroy the Qing artillery and break up enemy formations. During the conflict, the British superiority in range, rate of fire, and accuracy allowed the infantry to deal significant damage to their enemy before the Chinese could return fire. The use of naval artillery to support infantry operations allowed the British to take cities and forts with minimal casualties.

The overall strategy of the British during the war was to inhibit the finances of the Qing Empire, with the ultimate goal of acquiring a colonial possession on the Chinese coast. This was accomplished through the capture of Chinese cities and by blockading major river systems. Once a fort or city had been captured, the British would destroy the local arsenal and disable all of the captured guns. They would then move on to the next target, leaving a small garrison behind. This strategy was planned and implemented by Major General Gough, who was able to operate with minimal input from the British government after Superintendent Elliot was recalled in 1841. The large number of private British merchants and East India Company ships deployed in Singapore and the India colonies ensured that the British forces in China were adequately supplied.
==== Qing dynasty ====
China did not have a unified navy, instead allowing individual provinces to manage naval defenses. Although the Qing had invested in naval defences for their adjacent seas in earlier periods, after the death of the Qianlong Emperor in 1799, the navy decayed as more attention was directed to suppressing the Miao Rebellion and White Lotus Rebellion. These conflicts left the Qing treasury bankrupt. The remaining naval forces were badly overstretched, undermanned, underfunded and uncoordinated.

From the onset of the war, the Chinese navy was severely disadvantaged. Chinese war junks were intended for use against pirates or equivalent types of vessels, and were more effective in close range river engagements. Due to their ships&#x27; slow speeds, Qing captains consistently found themselves sailing towards much more manoeuvrable British ships, and as a consequence the Chinese could only use their bow guns. The size of the British ships made traditional boarding tactics useless, and the junks carried smaller numbers of inferior weaponry. In addition, the Chinese ships were poorly armoured; in several battles, British shells and rockets penetrated Chinese magazines and detonated gunpowder stores. Highly manoeuvrable steamships such as HMS &quot;Nemesis&quot; could decimate small fleets of junks, as the junks had little chance of catching up to and engaging the faster British steamers. The only western-style warship in the Qing Navy, the converted East Indiaman &quot;Cambridge&quot;, was destroyed in the Battle of First Bar.

Apparently, the Chinese emperor was aware of this. In an 1842 edict he said:
... the invasion by the rebellious barbarians, they depended upon their strong ships and effective guns to commit outrageous acts on the seas and harm our people, largely because the native war junks are too small to match them. For this reason I, the emperor, repeatedly ordered our generals to resist on land and not to fight on seas ... When the enemy ships come, no resistance can be offered; when they go away no means of pursuit are available ... In my opinion what the rebellious barbarians rely upon is the fact that Chinese war junks are incapable of going out to sea to fight them.
The defensive nature of the conflict resulted in the Chinese relying heavily on an extensive network of fortifications. The Kangxi Emperor (1654–1722) began the construction of river defences to combat pirates, and encouraged the use of western style cannons. By the time of the First Opium War, multiple forts defended most major Chinese cities and waterways. Although the forts were well armed and strategically positioned, the Qing defeat exposed major flaws in their design. The cannons used in the Qing defensive fortifications were a collection of Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, and British pieces. The domestically produced Chinese cannon were crafted using sub-par forging methods, limiting their effectiveness in combat and causing excessive gun barrel wear. The Chinese blend of gunpowder also contained more charcoal than the British mixture did; while this made it more stable and thus easier to store, it also limited its potential as a propellant, decreasing projectile range and accuracy. Overall, Chinese cannon technology was considered to be 200 years behind that of the British.

Chinese forts were unable to withstand attacks by European weaponry, as they were designed without angled glacis and many did not have protected magazines. The limited range of the Qing cannon allowed the British to bombard the Qing defences from a safe distance, then land soldiers to storm them with minimal risk. Many of the larger Chinese guns were built as fixed emplacements and were unable to be maneuvered to fire at British ships. The failure of the Qing fortifications coupled with the Chinese underestimation of the Royal Navy allowed the British to force their way up major rivers and impede Qing logistics. Most notably, the powerful series of forts at Humen were well positioned to stop an invader from proceeding upriver to Guangzhou, but it had not been considered that an enemy would attack and destroy the forts themselves, as the British did during the war.

At the start of the war the Qing army consisted of over 200,000 soldiers, with around 800,000 men being able to be called for war. These forces consisted of Manchu bannermen, the Green Standard Army, provincial militias, and imperial garrisons. The Qing armies were armed with matchlocks and shotguns, which had an effective range of 100 metres. Chinese historians Liu and Zhang note that the Chinese soldiers &quot;were equipped with sixty or seventy percent traditional weapons, of which the most important were the long lance, the side sword, the bow and arrow, and the rattan shield, and only thirty or forty percent [of their armament consisted of] gunpowder weapons, of which the most important were the matchlock musket, the heavy musket, the cannon, the fire arrow, and the earthshaking bomb and such things.&quot; Chinese soldiers were also equipped with halberds, spears, swords, and crossbows. The Qing dynasty also employed large batteries of artillery in battle.

The tactics of the Qing remained consistent with what they had been in previous centuries. Soldiers with firearms would form ranks and fire volleys into the enemy while men armed with spears and pikes would drive the enemy off of the battlefield. Cavalry was used to break infantry formations and pursue routed enemies, while Qing artillery was used to scatter enemy formations and destroy fortifications. During the First Opium War, these tactics were unable to successfully deal with British firepower. Chinese melee formations were decimated by artillery, and Chinese soldiery armed with matchlocks could not effectively exchange fire with British ranks, who greatly outranged them. Most battles of the war were fought in cities or on cliffs and riverbanks, limiting the Qing usage of cavalry. Many Qing cannon were destroyed by British counter-battery fire, and British light infantry companies were consistently able to outflank and capture Chinese artillery batteries. A British officer said of the opposing Qing forces, &quot;The Chinese are robust muscular fellows, and no cowards; the Tartars [i.e. Manchus] desperate; but neither are well commanded nor acquainted with European warfare. Having had, however, experience of three of them, I am inclined to suppose that a Tartar bullet is not a whit softer than a French one.&quot;

The strategy of the Qing dynasty during the war was to prevent the British from seizing Chinese territory. This defensive strategy was hampered by the Qing severely underestimating the capacity of the British military. Qing defences on the Pearl and Yangtze rivers were ineffective in stopping the British push inland, and superior naval artillery prevented the Chinese from retaking cities. The Qing imperial bureaucracy was unable to react quickly to the prodding British attacks, while officials and commanders often reported false, faulty, or incomplete information to their superiors. The Qing military system made it difficult to deploy troops to counter the mobile British forces. In addition, the ongoing conflict with Sikhs on the Qing border with India drew away some of the most experienced Qing units from the war with Britain.

== Aftermath ==
The war ended in the signing of China&#x27;s first unequal treaty, the Treaty of Nanking. In the supplementary Treaty of the Bogue, the Qing empire also recognised Britain as an equal to China and gave British subjects extraterritorial privileges in treaty ports. In 1844, the United States and France concluded similar treaties with China, the Treaty of Wanghia and Treaty of Whampoa, respectively.

In addition to opening China to European opium traders, the European trade in captive Chinese coolie labor boomed. Anglophone capitalists referred to this trade collectively as &quot;poison and pigs.&quot;

China was required to permit foreign missionaries and the unequal treaties gave European powers jurisdiction over missions and some authority over Chinese Christians.

==Legacy==

The opium trade faced intense enmity from later British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone. As a member of Parliament, Gladstone called it &quot;most infamous and atrocious&quot; referring to the opium trade between China and British India in particular. Gladstone was fiercely against both of the Opium Wars Britain waged in China: the First Opium War initiated in 1840 and the Second Opium War initiated in 1857. He denounced British violence against the Chinese and was ardently opposed to the British trade in opium to China. Gladstone lambasted it as &quot;Palmerston&#x27;s Opium War&quot; and said in May 1840 that he felt &quot;in dread of the judgments of God upon England for our national iniquity towards China&quot;. Gladstone made a famous speech in Parliament against the First Opium War, stating, &quot;A war more unjust in its origin, a war more calculated to cover this country with disgrace, I do not know, and I have not read of.&quot; His hostility to opium stemmed from the effects opium brought upon his sister Helen. Due to the First Opium war brought on by Palmerston, there was initial reluctance to join the government of Peel on part of Gladstone before 1841.

The war marked the start of what 20th century Chinese nationalists called the &quot;century of humiliation&quot;. The ease with which the British forces defeated the numerically superior Chinese armies damaged the dynasty&#x27;s prestige. The Treaty of Nanking was a step to opening the lucrative Chinese market to global commerce and the opium trade. The interpretation of the war, which was long the standard in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, was summarised in 1976: The Opium War, &quot;in which the Chinese people fought against British aggression, marked the beginning of modern Chinese history and the start of the Chinese people&#x27;s bourgeois-democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism.&quot;

The Treaty of Nanking, the Supplementary Treaty of the Bogue, and two French and American agreements were all &quot;unequal treaties&quot; signed between 1842 and 1844. The terms of these treaties undermined China&#x27;s traditional mechanisms of foreign relations and methods of controlled trade. Five ports were opened for trade, gunboats, and foreign residence: Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Ningbo, and Shanghai. Hong Kong was seized by the British to become a free and open port. Tariffs were abolished thus preventing the Chinese from raising future duties to protect domestic industries and extraterritorial practices exempted Westerners from Chinese law. This made them subject to their own civil and criminal laws of their home country. Most importantly, the opium problem was never addressed and after the treaty was signed opium addiction doubled. China was forced to pay 21 million silver taels as an indemnity, which was used to pay compensation for the traders&#x27; opium destroyed by Commissioner Lin. A couple of years after the treaties were signed internal rebellion began to threaten foreign trade. Due to the Qing government&#x27;s inability to control collection of taxes on imported goods, the British government convinced the Manchu court to allow Westerners to partake in government official affairs. By the 1850s the Chinese Maritime Customs Service, one of the most important bureaucracies in the Manchu Government, was partially staffed and managed by Western Foreigners. In 1858, opium was legalised, and would remain a problem.

Commissioner Lin, often referred to as &quot;Lin the Clear Sky&quot; for his moral probity, was made a scapegoat. He was blamed for ultimately failing to stem the tide of opium imports and usage as well as for provoking an unwinnable war through his rigidity and lack of understanding of the changing world. Nevertheless, as the Chinese nation formed in the 20th century, Lin became viewed as a hero, and has been immortalised at various locations around China.

The First Opium War both reflected and contributed to a further weakening of the Chinese state&#x27;s power and legitimacy. Anti-Qing sentiment grew in the form of rebellions, such as the Taiping Rebellion, a war lasting from 1850 to 1864 in which at least 20 million Chinese died. The decline of the Qing dynasty was beginning to be felt by much of the Chinese population.

===Revisionist views===
The impact of the opium habit on the Chinese people, and the manner in which the British imposed their power to guarantee the profitable trade, have been staples of Chinese historiography ever since.
The British historian Jasper Ridley concluded:

However, Ridley adds, opposition in Britain was intense:

The American historian John K. Fairbank wrote:
Some historians claim that Lord Palmerston, the British Foreign Secretary, initiated the Opium War to maintain the principle of free trade.
Professor Glenn Melancon, for example, argues that the issue in going to war was not opium but Britain&#x27;s need to uphold its reputation, its honour and its commitment to global free trade. China was pressing Britain just when the British faced serious pressures in the Near East, on the Indian frontier and in Latin America. In the end, says Melancon, the government&#x27;s need to maintain its honour in Britain and prestige abroad forced the decision to go to war. Former American president John Quincy Adams commented that opium was &quot;a mere incident to the dispute ... the cause of the war is the kowtow—the arrogant and insupportable pretensions of China that she will hold commercial intercourse with the rest of mankind not upon terms of equal reciprocity, but upon the insulting and degrading forms of the relations between lord and vassal.&quot;

Ray Huang, in &quot;China: A Macro History&quot;, provides a broader context for understanding the Opium War. He argues that the causes of the conflict cannot be solely reduced to economic factors or immediate diplomatic tensions. Huang emphasizes the deep structural issues within the Qing dynasty, including economic strain, bureaucratic inefficiencies, and social unrest. These issues weakened the Qing state&#x27;s ability to respond effectively to both internal and external pressures. The mounting frustrations of Chinese officials and the social dislocations they faced played a significant role in pushing the government towards harsher policies against the opium trade[4].

The Australian historian Harry G. Gelber argues that opium played a role similar to the tea dumped into the harbour in the Boston Tea Party of 1773 leading to the American Revolutionary War. Gelber argues instead:
Western women were actually not legally permitted to enter Guangzhou although they were permitted to live in Macau.

The Qing government hampered foreign trade and through the Canton System concentrated trade in Guangzhou. That being said, the policy of concentrating trade to a single port was also used in Western countries such as Spain and Portugal. Western merchants could also trade freely and legally with Chinese merchants in Xiamen and Macao or when the trade was conducted through ports outside China such as Manila and Batavia. Furthermore, Macao was restricted to Portuguese traders, and Xiamen the Spanish, who rarely made use of this privilege.

The public in Western countries had earlier condemned the British government for supporting the opium trade. Opium was the most profitable single commodity trade of the 19th century. As Timothy Brook and Bob Wakabayashi write of opium, &quot;The British Empire could not survive were it deprived of its most important source of capital, the substance that could turn any other commodity into silver.&quot; although this thesis is controversial Opium was the most common and the most profitable trade good and comprised 33–54% of all goods shipped from Bengal to the East between 1815 and 1818. Carl Trocki described &quot;the British Empire east of Suez as of 1800 as essentially a drug cartel.&quot; James Bradley states that &quot;between 1814 and 1850, the opium trade sucked out 11 percent of China&#x27;s money supply&quot;.

Although shipping was regulated, the Qianlong emperor&#x27;s administration was diligent in accommodating the requisites of Western merchants. It hired a growing body of Western assistants for the Customs Office to help manage its fellow countrymen. The order to stay in Macao during the winter was lifted; tax was exempted on food, drink, and basic supplies for Western merchants; and protections were granted to Westerners and their property. Qing laws prevented Chinese from pursuing foreigners through the courts. The prohibition mainly dated from the Qianlong Emperor&#x27;s strong conviction that mistreatment of foreigners had been a major cause of the overthrow of several earlier dynasties.

The Qianlong Emperor granted Lord Macartney a golden sceptre, an important symbol of peace and wealth, but that was dismissed by the British, who were unaware of its symbolism. The Qianlong Emperor also dismissed the &quot;lavish&quot; presents that the British gave to facilitate diplomatic relations and concluded that they were no better than other European products. In 1806, Chinese officials compromised with the British on the murder of a Chinese man by British seamen, as Westerners refused to be punished under Chinese law, and local citizens vigorously protested for xenophobic reasons and because of perceived injustice. In 1816, the Jiaqing Emperor dismissed a British embassy for its refusal to kowtow, but he sent them an apologetic letter with gifts, which were later found in the Foreign Office, unread. The British ignored Chinese laws and warnings not to deploy military forces in Chinese waters. The British landed troops in Macao despite a Chinese and Portuguese agreement to bar foreign forces from Macao and then in the War of 1812 attacked American ships deep in the inner harbour of Guangzhou (the Americans had previously robbed British ships in Chinese waters as well). Those, in combination with the British support to Nepal during their invasion of Tibet and later British invasion of Nepal after it became a Chinese tributary state, led the Chinese authorities to become highly suspicious of British intentions. In 1834, when British naval vessels intruded into Chinese waters again, the Daoguang Emperor commented: &quot;How laughable and deplorable is it that we cannot even repel two barbarian ships. Our military had decayed so much. No wonder the barbarians are looking down on us.&quot;

===Question of inevitability===
Historians have often pondered whether the war could have been avoided. One factor was that China rejected diplomatic relations with the British or anyone else, as seen in the rejection of the Macartney mission in 1793. As a result, diplomatic mechanisms for negotiation and resolution were missing. Michael Greenberg locates the inevitable cause in the momentum for more and more overseas trade in Britain&#x27;s expanding modern economy. On the other hand, the economic forces inside Britain that were war hawks, Radicals in Parliament and northern merchants
and manufacturers, were a political minority and needed allies, especially Palmerston, before they could get their war. In Parliament, the Melbourne government faced a host of complex international threats including the Chartist riots at home, bothersome budget deficits, unrest in Ireland, rebellions in Canada and Jamaica, war in Afghanistan, and French threats to British business interests in Mexico and Argentina. The opposition demanded more aggressive answers, and it was Foreign Minister Palmerston who set up an easy war to solve the political crisis. It was not economics, opium sales or expanding trade that caused the British to go to war, Melancon argues, but it was more a matter of upholding aristocratic standards of national honour sullied by Chinese insults.

One historiographical problem is that the emphasis on the British causal factors tends to ignore the Chinese. The Manchu rulers were focused on internal unrest by Chinese elements and paid little attention to the minor issues happening in Guangzhou. The historian James
Polachek argues the reasons for trying to suppress the opium trade had to do with internal factionalism led by a purification-oriented group of literary scholars who paid no attention to the risk of international intervention by much more powerful military forces. Therefore, it was not a matter of inevitable conflict between contrasting worldviews. Lin and the Daoguang Emperor, comments Spence, &quot;seemed to have believed that the citizens of Guangzhou and the foreign traders there had simple, childlike natures that would respond to firm guidance and statements of moral principles set out in simple, clear terms.&quot; Neither considered the possibility that the British government would be committed to protecting the smugglers. Polachek argues, based on records of court debate, that growing court awareness that opium addiction in the Guangdong military garrisons, caused by widespread collusion between British smugglers, Chinese smugglers and Chinese officials, had completely impaired their military effectiveness. That left the entire southern flank of the Qing exposed to military threats and was more important in generating opposition to the drug trade than economic reasons. Polachek shows that Lin Zexu and the hardliners (mistakenly) believed that by arresting drug abusers, confiscating the opium supplies and promising to allow the British to continue trading in other goods, they could persuade the British to give up the drug trade without a war.

<text>In archaeological terminology, a projectile point is an object that was hafted to a weapon that was capable of being thrown or projected, such as a javelin, dart, or arrow. They are thus different from weapons presumed to have been kept in the hand, such as knives, spears, axes, hammers, and maces.

Stone tools, including projectile points, were often lost or discarded and are relatively plentiful, especially at archaeological sites. They provide useful clues to the human past, including prehistoric trade. A distinctive form of point, identified though lithic analysis of the way it was made, is often a key diagnostic factor in identifying an archaeological industry or culture. Scientific techniques exist to track the specific kinds of rock or minerals that were used to make stone tools in various regions back to their original sources.

As well as stone, projectile points were also made of worked wood, bone, antler, horn, or ivory; all of these are less common in the Americas. In regions where metallurgy emerged, projectile points were eventually made from copper, bronze, or iron, though the change was by no means immediate. In North America, some late prehistoric points were fashioned from copper that was mined in the Lake Superior region and elsewhere.

== History in North America ==
A large variety of prehistoric arrowheads, dart points, javelin points, and spear points have been discovered. Chert, obsidian, quartzite, quartz, and many other rocks and minerals were commonly used to make points in North America. The oldest projectile points found in North America were long thought to date from about 13,000 years ago, during the Paleo-Indian period, however recent evidence suggests that North American projectile points may date to as old as 15,500 years. Some of the more famous Paleo-Indian types include Clovis, Folsom and Dalton points.

=== Types ===
Projectile points fall into two general types: dart or javelin points and arrow points. Larger points were used to tip atlatl javelins or darts and spears. Arrow points are smaller and lighter than dart points, and were used to tip arrows. The question of how to distinguish an arrow point from a point used on a larger projectile is non-trivial. According to some investigators, the best indication is the width of the hafting area, which is thought to correlate to the width of the shaft. An alternative approach is to distinguish arrow points by their necessarily smaller size (weight, length, thickness).

Projectile points come in an amazing variety of shapes and styles, which vary according to chronological periods, cultural identities, and intended functions.

Typological studies of projectile points have become more elaborate through the years. For instance, Gregory Perino began his categorical study of projectile point typology in the late 1950s. Collaborating with Robert Bell, he published a set of four volumes defining the known point types of that time. Perino followed this several years later with a three-volume study of &quot;Selected Preforms, Points and Knives of the North American Indians&quot;. Another recent set of typological studies of North American projectile points has been produced by Noel Justice.

<text>Holocaust theology is a body of theological and philosophical debate concerning the role of God in the universe in light of the Holocaust of the late 1930s and early 1940s. Exploration of Holocaust theology is found primarily within Judaism. This focus reflects the cataclysmic devastation wreaked on the European Jewish population as the primary targets of the Holocaust.

Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have traditionally taught that God is omniscient (all-knowing), omnipotent (all-powerful), and omnibenevolent (all-good) in nature. However, according to many believers and unbelievers, these views are in apparent contrast with the injustice and suffering in the world. Monotheists seek to reconcile this view of God with the existence of evil and suffering. In so doing, they are confronting what is known as the problem of evil. One solution to the problem of evil is dualism, which envisions a second God with evil characteristics. Another solution is to propose that God is actually an evil entity with the goal of increasing suffering in the world.

Within all of the monotheistic faiths many answers (theodicies) have been proposed. In light of the magnitude of depravity seen in the Holocaust, many people have also reexamined classical views on this subject. A common question raised in Holocaust theology is &quot;How can people still have any kind of faith after the Holocaust?&quot;

A scholarly literature, including a variety of anthologies and commentaries, has developed that reflects upon Holocaust theology as a religio-cultural phenomenon.

==Orthodox Jewish responses==
===Biblical origin===
Although the risks and obstacles were great, the promise of the covenant, already with the Jewish patriarchs and for the Land of Israel, is held up as eternally sealed in holiness:

&quot;To the point of destroying them&quot;: LeKhaLotam (לכלתם, to destroy them) also implies KhaLah (כלה, desire and yearning); God is saying, &quot;Even though you have sinned, I do not despise you, because you still desire to serve Me&quot; (&quot;Likutey Halakhot V&quot;).

Many have identified Hitler as an Amalekite. According to the Hebrew Bible, Amalek lived in Canaan: &quot;Amalek dwells in the south land&quot; (Numbers 13:29). The Israelites were instructed to kill all those who dwelled in Canaan: &quot;thou shalt save alive nothing that breathes&quot; (Deuteronomy 19:16) otherwise &quot;I shall do to you, as I thought to do to them&quot; (Numbers 33:56). Amalek and Israel were archenemies, their enmity originating from the Battle of Refidim, where the Amalekites targeted and killed weak Israelites. As a result, God decreed Amalek to be obliterated &quot;from beneath the heavens&quot; (Deuteronomy 25:19). The Hebrew Bible connects &quot;Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite&quot; (Esther 3:1), the genocidal antagonist of the Book of Esther, to Agag, king of Amalek, whom the Israelites failed to kill (I Samuel 15:9). According to these verses Hitler may be seen as a result of this failure. However, Hitler could also be seen as a &quot;symbolic&quot; Amalekite.

===Haredi and Hardal===
Satmar leader Joel Teitelbaum writes:Because of our sinfulness we have suffered greatly, suffering as bitter as wormwood, worse than any Israel has known since it became a people... In former times, whenever troubles befell Jacob, the matter was pondered and reasons sought—which sin had brought the troubles about—so that we could make amends and return to the Lord, may He be blessed... But in our generation one need not look far for the sin responsible for our calamity... The heretics have made all kinds of efforts to violate these oaths, to go up by force and to seize sovereignty and freedom by themselves, before the appointed time... [They] have lured the majority of the Jewish people into awful heresy, the likes of which have not been seen since the world was created... And so it is no wonder that the Lord has lashed out in anger... And there were also righteous people who perished because of the iniquity of the sinners and corrupters, so great was the [divine] wrath.

The well-known Lithuanian Jewish leader, Rabbi Elazar Shach taught that the Holocaust was a divine punishment for the sins of the Jewish people, and for the abandoning of religious observance for the enlightenment. He caused outrage in the secular Israeli media when he stated that &quot;the Holy One, blessed be He, kept score for hundreds of years until it added up to six million Jews&quot;. In his defence, Haredi MKs said his comments had been misconstrued, and were not meant to justify Nazi atrocities. Shach believed that the secularism of some Israelis would cause another Holocaust, and he once said that if the Education Ministry were to be placed in the hands of Meretz MK Shulamit Aloni, it would result in &quot;over a million Israeli children being forced into apostasy, and that would be worse than what had happened to Jewish children during the Holocaust&quot;. Wishing to prevent deviation from the established order of prayers, he opposed the composition of new prayers to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust.
There were Messianist Zionists, at the other end of the spectrum, who also saw the Holocaust as a collective punishment for ongoing Jewish unfaithfulness to God. Mordecai Atiyah was a leading advocate of this idea. Zvi Yehuda Kook and his disciples, for their part, avoided this harsh position, but they too theologically related the Holocaust to the Jewish recognition of God&#x27;s divine wrath upon them. Kook writes: &quot;When the end comes and Israel fails to recognize it, there comes a cruel divine operation that removes [the Jewish people] from its exile.

Chaim Ozer Grodzinski, in 1939, stated that the Nazi persecution of the Jews was the fault of non-Orthodox Jews (Achiezer, volume III, Vilna 1939). Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler had similar views.

=== Chabad ===

In 1980, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh Rebbe of Chabad Lubavitch wrote:
&quot;It is clear that &#x27;no evil descends from Above,&#x27; and buried within torment and suffering is a core of exalted spiritual good. Not all human beings are able to perceive it, but it is very much there. So it is not impossible for the physical destruction of the Holocaust to be spiritually beneficial. On the contrary, it is quite possible that physical affliction is good for the spirit&quot; (&quot;Mada Ve&#x27;emuna,&quot; Machon Lubavitch, 1980, Kfar Chabad)
He then went on to compare it to a Surgeon who amputates limbs to save the life of a patient:

&quot;[The limb] is incurably diseased... God, like the professor-surgeon... seeks the good of Israel, and indeed, all He does is done for the good... In the spiritual sense, no harm was done, because the everlasting spirit of the Jewish people was not destroyed.&quot; (&quot;Mada Ve&#x27;emuna,&quot; Machon Lubavitch, 1980, Kfar Chabad)
In later years he would say that no explanation that human reason can provide can afford a satisfactory theodicy of Auschwitz, especially no explanation along the lines of divine punition. In his published discourses, for example, the following critique of any rational Auschwitz theodicy is to be found.

In our own times, the destruction of six million Jews that took place with such great and terrible cruelty—a tremendous desolation the likes of which never was (and never will be, may the Merciful One save us!) throughout all generations—cannot be considered a matter of punishment for transgressions, for even the Satan himself could not configure a calculus of transgressions for that generation which could justify—Heaven forbid!—a punishment so severe. There is no rational explanation and no elucidation based on Torah wisdom whatsoever for the Devastation, nothing but the knowledge that &quot;thus it arises in My [God&#x27;s] Mind!&quot; and &quot;It is a decree before Me.&quot; And even then, it is certainly not in the sense of a divine desire or innermost will of God—Heaven forbid!—for, as it says in Torah, &quot;When man suffers, what does the &quot;Shekhinah&quot; [the Divine Presence] say? &#x27;My head is too heavy for me, etc.&#x27;&quot; [&quot;Sanhedrin&quot; 46a . It is but &quot;for a small moment that have I forsaken thee&quot; Is. 54:7]). And most certainly there is no explanation in terms of punishment for sins. On the contrary, all those who were killed in the Desolation are called &quot;kedoshim&quot; [holy ones] ... because they were killed in sanctification of God&#x27;s Name (on account of being Jews) […]

The same approach, in which all forms of rational theodicy are categorically rejected, is adopted by Schneerson in his correspondence with Elie Wiesel (R. M. M. Schneerson, &quot;Iggerot Hakodesh,&quot; no. 8969, 23:370–371).

 ...it is no mere coincidence that all authentic questioners [like Abraham and Moses] remained by their trust in God. For it could in no way be otherwise. Why so? If only the problem is meant with truth, and it is the expression and product of a true feeling of justice and uprightness, then it is logical that such a deep feeling can only come from being convinced that true justice is the justice that stems from a super-human source, that is, from something higher than both human intellect and human feeling. [...] after the initial tempestuous assault [on God by the sufferer], he has to see that the entire process of posing the problem and of wishing to understand with the intellect that which is higher than the intellect, is something that cannot take place. Moreover, he must—after a rattling outrage and a thorough grieving—ultimately come to the conclusion: Nevertheless I remain confident [&quot;ani maamin&quot;]. On the contrary: even &quot;more&quot; strongly!

=== Religion in the Holocaust ===

Maintaining a religious lifestyle during the Holocaust required great strength and came at the risk of endangering oneself. At the outbreak of WWII, less than half of European Jews actively practiced a form of Judaism. In concentration camps, Jewish religious practices were banned, so any observances had to be done in secret. Since so many practices required effort and access to specific items, many were unable to follow Judaic laws and traditions.

==Works of Jewish theologians==
===Richard Rubenstein===
Prof. Richard Rubenstein&#x27;s original piece on this issue, &quot;After Auschwitz&quot;, held that the only intellectually honest response to the Holocaust is to reject God, and to recognize that all existence is ultimately meaningless. According to this piece, there is no divine plan or purpose, no God that reveals His will to humankind, and God does not care about the world. Humans must assert and create their own value in life. This view has been rejected by Jews of all religious denominations, but his works were widely read in the Jewish community in the 1970s. Since that time Rubenstein has begun to move away from this view; his later works affirm a form of deism in which one may believe that God may exist as the basis for reality and some also include Kabbalistic notions of the nature of God.

No man can really say that God is dead. How can we know that? Nevertheless, I am compelled to say that we live in the time of the &quot;death of God&quot;. This is more a statement about man and his culture than about God. The death of God is a cultural fact ... When I say we live in the time of the death of God, I mean that the thread uniting God and man, heaven and earth, has been broken ...

===Eliezer Berkovits===
Eliezer Berkovits held that man&#x27;s free will depends on God&#x27;s decision to remain hidden. If God were to reveal himself in history and hold back the hand of tyrants, man&#x27;s free will would be rendered non-existent. This is a view that is loosely based on the kabbalistic concept of &quot;nahama d&#x27;kissufa&quot; (bread of shame) - the idea that greater satisfaction is achieved when one becomes deserving of a blessing rather than when it is given as a gift. Kabbalah teaches that this is one of the reasons God created humans with free will and with obligations, and that in order to maintain that free will, God reduces the extent to which he manifests himself in the world (&quot;tzimtzum&quot;).

===David Weiss Halivni===
David Weiss Halivni, a Holocaust survivor from Hungary, says that the effort to associate the Shoah and sin is morally outrageous. He holds that it is unwarranted on a strict reading of the Tanakh. He claims that it reinforces an alarming tendency among ultra-Orthodox leaders to exploit such arguments on behalf of their own authority. In &quot;Prayer in the Shoah&quot; he gives his response to the idea that the Holocaust was a punishment from God:

What happened in the Shoah is above and beyond measure (l&#x27;miskpat): above and beyond suffering, above and beyond any punishment. There is no transgression that merits such punishment... and it cannot be attributed to sin.&quot;

===Elie Wiesel===
A Romanian Jewish-American writer, professor, political activist, Nobel laureate, and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel was the author of 57 books, including &quot;Night&quot;, a work based on his experiences as a prisoner in the Auschwitz, Buna, and Buchenwald concentration camps. Wiesel&#x27;s 1979 play &quot;The Trial of God&quot; is about a trial in which God is the defendant, and is reportedly based on events that Wiesel himself witnessed as a teenager in Auschwitz. Over the course of the trial, a number of arguments are made, both for and against God&#x27;s guilt. Wiesel&#x27;s theological stance, illustrated through the intuitive possibilities of literature, is a theology of existentialist protest, which neither denies God, nor accepts theodicies. Regarding the theme of protest in particular, Menachem Mendel Schneerson maintained a correspondence with Wiesel, urging him to perceive faith (&quot;emunah&quot;) as the transcendental precondition of authentic protest. In one of his books, Norman Lamm treats Wiesel&#x27;s theological novel, &quot;The Town Beyond the Wall&quot;, to literary, theological and Judaic commentary. The novel&#x27;s protagonists symbolically proceed through a range of theological views, which Wiesel&#x27;s Midrashic-style literature can explore where theodicy fails. The ending sees the hope of renewed mystical reconciliation with God.

==Post-Holocaust and child abuse theology==
David R. Blumenthal, in his book &quot;Facing the Abusing God&quot; (1993), has drawn on data from the field of child abuse and has proposed &quot;worship of God through protest&quot; as a legitimate response of survivors of both the Holocaust and child abuse.

Another writer addressing survivors of the Holocaust and child abuse is John K. Roth, whose essay &quot;A Theodicy of Protest&quot; is included in &quot;Encountering Evil: Live Options in Theodicy&quot; (1982).

== Works of important Christian theologians==
===Jürgen Moltmann===
In &quot;The Crucified God&quot; Jürgen Moltmann speaks of how in a theology after Auschwitz the traditional notion of God needed to be revised:

Shattered and broken, the survivors of my generation were then returning from camps and hospitals to the lecture room. A theology which did not speak of God in the sight of the one who was abandoned and crucified would have had nothing to say to us then.

The traditional notion of an impassible unmoved mover had died in those camps and was no longer tenable. Moltmann proposes instead a crucified God who is both a suffering and protesting God. That is, God is not detached from suffering but willingly enters into human suffering in compassion.

God in Auschwitz and Auschwitz in the crucified God – that is the basis for real hope that both embraces and overcomes the world.

This is in contrast both with the move of theism to justify God&#x27;s actions and the move of atheism to accuse God. Moltmann&#x27;s trinitarian theology of the cross instead says that God is a protesting God who opposes the gods of this world of power and domination by entering into human pain and suffering on the cross and on the gallows of Auschwitz. Moltmann&#x27;s theology of the cross was later developed into liberation theologies from suffering people under Stalinism in Eastern Europe and military dictatorships in South America and South Korea.

===Pope Benedict XVI===
In the address given on the occasion of his visit to the extermination camp of Auschwitz, Pope Benedict XVI suggested a reading of the events of the Holocaust as motivated by a hatred of God himself. The address begins by acknowledging the impossibility of an adequate theological response:
Nonetheless, he proposes that the actions of the Nazis can be seen as having been motivated by a hatred of God and a desire to exalt human power, with the Holocaust serving as a means by which to erase witness to God and his Law:
Most coverage of the address was positive, with praise from Italian and Polish rabbis. The Simon Wiesenthal Center called the visit historic, and the address and prayers &quot;a repudiation of antisemitism and a repudiation of those... who refer to the Holocaust as a myth&quot;.

==Criticisms==
A few Jewish commentators have objected to what they perceive as a desire to Christianize the Holocaust. There is debate as to whether Holocaust theology has contributed to the betterment of Jewish-Christian relations. Certain commentators have also criticized a tendency to historicize and dogmatize certain political or secular events such as the Holocaust, which are not part of theology as traditionally understood, with the effect of attempting both to locate God&#x27;s activity within history, and to embed it within wider political rhetoric.

Yehuda Bauer considered Holocaust theology &quot;fascinating&quot; but a &quot;dead end&quot;.

<text>In archaeology, a grinding slab is a ground stone artifact generally used to grind plant materials into usable size, though some slabs were used to shape other ground stone artifacts. Some grinding stones are portable; others are not and, in fact, may be part of a stone outcropping.

Grinding slabs used for plant processing typically acted as a coarse surface against which plant materials were ground using a portable hand stone, or mano (&quot;hand&quot; in Spanish). Variant grinding slabs are referred to as metates or querns, and have a ground-out bowl. Like all ground stone artifacts, grinding slabs are made of large-grained materials such as granite, basalt, or similar tool stones.

<text>The Boys from Brazil is a 1978 thriller film directed by Franklin J. Schaffner. It stars Gregory Peck and Laurence Olivier, and features James Mason, Lilli Palmer, Uta Hagen, Anne Meara, Denholm Elliott, and Steve Guttenberg in supporting roles. The film is a British-American co-production, based on the 1976 novel of the same title by Ira Levin. It was nominated for three Academy Awards.

==Plot==
Barry Kohler, a young amateur Nazi hunter, spies on a meeting of the fugitive Nazi organisation &quot;Kameraden&quot; in Paraguay. At this meeting Josef Mengele, the infamous Auschwitz doctor, issues instructions for the assassinations of 94 civil servants in Northern Europe and North America, all of them low-ranking and aged around 65, on particular dates over the next two years. Kohler telephones Ezra Lieberman, a famous (but penniless and cynical) Nazi hunter living in Vienna, to inform him of his discovery. However, while still on the phone, he is surprised by the &quot;Kameraden&quot; and killed.

With the help of his sister Esther, British journalist Sidney Beynon and Jewish-American vigilante leader David Bennett, Lieberman begins investigating the deaths of civil servants fitting the profile who die suddenly over the next few months. He is struck by the fact that all of the dead men have sons aged 13 who look exactly alike, with pale skin, dark hair and blue eyes. He discovers that all of the boys were illegally adopted, and that some of the adoptions were facilitated by &quot;Kameraden&quot; member Frieda Maloney, who has since been jailed. Lieberman interviews Maloney, who tells him that the boys were provided by an intermediary in Brazil. She mentions that one of the adoptive fathers she dealt with, American Henry Wheelock, gave her a newborn puppy in exchange for his baby.

Seeking an explanation for the boys&#x27; identical appearance, Lieberman consults the biologist Dr Bruckner, who explains the principles of cloning. Lieberman deduces that the boys are clones of Adolf Hitler, all created from a single DNA sample by Mengele, who has also been seeking to ensure that their childhoods imitate that of the original Hitler by having them adopted by parents who resemble Hitler&#x27;s own abusive father Alois (a civil servant in the Austro-Hungarian Empire) and doting mother Klara, in the hope that their later lives will also follow the same course and that as adults they will establish new Nazi regimes in their respective countries. The murders of the fathers are part of this plan, designed to reflect the death of Alois when Hitler was 13. Based on this revelation, and the age of Maloney&#x27;s dog, Lieberman realises that Henry Wheelock is due to be murdered in just four days&#x27; time.

Alarmed by the progress of Lieberman&#x27;s investigation, and by Mengele&#x27;s increasingly erratic behaviour (he almost beats one of his men to death for killing his target on the wrong date), the &quot;Kameraden&quot; leadership attempts to shut down the project, but Mengele escapes.

Lieberman travels to rural Pennsylvania to warn Henry Wheelock, but, by the time that he arrives, Wheelock has already been murdered by Mengele, who pretended to be Lieberman. The doctor also shoots Lieberman, badly wounding him, but is then attacked and cornered by the family&#x27;s vicious Doberman Pinschers (Mengele fears dogs). When Wheelock&#x27;s son Bobby arrives home from school, Mengele attempts to tell him about his real origins. He makes no attempt to deny killing Wheelock, telling Bobby that he must rise above his worthless adoptive family and embrace his destiny. This enrages the boy, who orders the dogs to kill Mengele. Lieberman recovers a list from Mengele&#x27;s pocket detailing the identities of all 94 clones, but then collapses from blood loss.

As Lieberman recuperates in hospital, he is visited by Bennett, who asks him to hand over the list so that his vigilante group can eliminate the clones. Lieberman refuses and instead burns the list, declaring that they are innocent children who may yet grow up to be harmless. However, the final scene shows Bobby Wheelock gazing in fascination at photographs he took of Mengele&#x27;s mauled corpse.

==Production==
===Development===
The book came out in 1976 and was a best seller. In August 1976 it was announced the Producers Group (Robert Fryer, Martin Richards, Mary Lee Johnson and James Cresson) had optioned the film rights to the novel and would make the movie in association with Lew Grade. Fryer had just made &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; for Grade. According to producer Martin Richards, Robert Mulligan was the original director.

In May 1977, it was announced Laurence Olivier would star. By this stage Franklin Schaffner was attached to direct. Gregory Peck joined the film in July. Olivier had recently been ill and was taking as many well-paying movie jobs as he could get in order to provide for his wife and children after his death. Peck agreed to portray Mengele only because he wanted to work with Olivier. Mason initially expressed interest in playing either Mengele or Lieberman. Lilli Palmer also accepted a small role just to work with Olivier. To prepare for the roles of the European clones, Jeremy Black was sent to a speech studio in New York City by 20th Century Fox to learn how to speak with both an English and a German accent.

&quot;The emphasis of the film is not on Nazis,&quot; said producer Fryer. &quot;It is really about cloning, a logical extension of existing facts. And it&#x27;s about the hatred that two men have for each other.&quot;

=== Filming ===
Although the bulk of the film is set in South America, Fryer says actually filming on that continent was &quot;logistically impossible&quot; so the decision was made to shoot it in Lisbon, Portugal. Filming started in Portugal in October 1977, with additional filming in London, Vienna, the Kölnbrein Dam in Austria, and Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The scenes that were set in Massachusetts were shot in London.

The altercation between Lieberman and Mengele took about three or four days to film due to Olivier&#x27;s ailing health at the time. Peck recalled that he and Olivier &quot;were lying around on the floor&quot; laughing at the absurdity of having to film such a fight scene at their advanced ages.

===Extended ending===
A brief end segment with Bobby Wheelock in a darkroom was restored to some versions in later years. In this alternative ending, after Lieberman burns the list in his hospital bed, the scene transitions to Bobby in a darkroom developing photographs of Lieberman and Mengele, with a piercing glare coming from his steely-blue eyes as he focuses on Mengele&#x27;s jaguar claw bracelet before fading to the end credits.

==Release==
The film had 25 minutes cut when released in West Germany, theatrical as well as all subsequent TV, video and some DVD releases. In 1999, by Artisan Entertainment, and 2009 by Lionsgate Home Entertainment, the film was released uncut on DVD in the U.S. and uncut in Germany on its DVDs.

Lew Grade, who partly financed the film, was not happy with the final result, feeling that the ending was too gory. He says he protested but Franklin J. Schaffner, who had final cut rights, overruled him.

In 2015, Shout! Factory released the film on Blu-ray.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 70% based on 33 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Its story takes some dubious turns, but a high-caliber cast and a gripping pace fashion &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot; into an effective thriller.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 40 out of 100 based on reviews from 7 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews.

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote &quot;With two excellent antagonists in Gregory Peck and Lord Laurence Olivier, &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot; presents a gripping, suspenseful drama for nearly all of its two hours — then lets go at the end and falls into a heap.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars and called it &quot;old-fashioned filmmaking at its worst,&quot; with &quot;one of the phoniest stories you can imagine.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote &quot;It is penny-dreadful stuff, sumptuously executed but still as shallow as a Saturday serial. One exasperation of &quot;The Boys From Brazil&quot; is that, even accepting the biological possibility of the premise, the script by Heywood Gould never confronts any of the interesting questions raised.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;admirably crafted and surprisingly effective,&quot; and &quot;a snazzy pop entertainment synthesis of accumulating suspense, detective work, pseudoscientific speculation and historical wish fulfillment.&quot; Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote &quot;If the film wants to be taken as a cautionary fable—another one!—about the ever-present dangers of Nazism, then it should leave viewers with a sense of menace that Mengele&#x27;s &#x27;boys from Brazil&#x27; constitute. Instead, we get Lieberman&#x27;s fuddy-duddy humanism and vague assurances that the boys are not really dangerous. And this is supposed to be a movie.&quot; Jack Kroll of &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote that &quot;the thoughts aren&#x27;t quite deep enough even for a thriller...Heywood Gould&#x27;s reasonably suspenseful screenplay blows it by suddenly turning Lieberman into a kindly old Jewish uncle instead of a man who is willing to face the tough paradoxes of good and evil.&quot;

Scholars have used the film&#x27;s idea of controlling an individual&#x27;s genetics and upbringing to illustrate the difficulties of reconciling traditional views of free will with modern neuroscience.

<text>&quot;A Descent into the Maelström&quot; is an 1841 short story by American writer Edgar Allan Poe. In the tale, a man recounts how he survived a shipwreck and a whirlpool. It has been grouped with Poe&#x27;s tales of and also labeled an early form of science fiction.

==Plot==
Inspired by the Moskstraumen, it is couched as a story within a story, a tale told at the summit of a mountain climb in Lofoten, Norway. The story is told by an old man who reveals that he only appears old—&quot;You suppose me a &quot;very&quot; old man,&quot; he says, &quot;but I am not. It took less than a single day to change these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weaken my limbs, and to unstring my nerves.&quot; The narrator, convinced by the power of the whirlpools he sees in the ocean beyond, is then told of the &quot;old&quot; man&#x27;s fishing trip with his two brothers a few years ago.

Driven by &quot;the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the heavens&quot;, their ship was caught in the vortex. One brother was pulled into the waves; the other was driven mad by the horror of the spectacle, and drowned as the ship was pulled under. At first the narrator only saw hideous terror in the spectacle. In a moment of revelation, he saw that the Maelström is a beautiful and awesome creation. Observing how objects around him were attracted and pulled into it, he deduced that &quot;the larger the bodies, the more rapid their descent&quot; and that spherical-shaped objects were pulled in the fastest. Unlike his brother, he abandoned ship and held on to a cylindrical barrel until he was saved several hours later when the whirlpool temporarily subsided, and he was rescued by some fishermen. The &quot;old&quot; man tells the story to the narrator without any hope that the narrator will believe it.

==Publication history==

The story first appeared in the May 1841 edition of &quot;Graham&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, published in April. Poe rushed to complete the story in time and later admitted that the conclusion was imperfect. Shortly after Poe&#x27;s story &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; was translated into French without acknowledgment, French readers sought out other works by Poe, of which &quot;A Descent into the Maelström&quot; was amongst the earliest translated. 

Like his other sea adventure works &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot; and &quot;The Journal of Julius Rodman&quot;, &quot;A Descent into the Maelström&quot; was believed by readers to be true. One passage was reprinted in the ninth edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;—but it was based on a passage that Poe had lifted from an earlier edition of that same encyclopedia. In June 1845, &quot;A Descent into the Maelström&quot; was collected for the first time in Poe&#x27;s &quot;Tales&quot;, published by G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons Wiley &amp; Putnam.

==Analysis==
The story&#x27;s opening bears a similarity to Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; (1798): in both, an excited old man tells his story of shipwreck and survival. The tale is one of sensation, emphasizing the narrator&#x27;s thoughts and feelings, especially his terror of being killed in the whirlpool. The narrator uses his reasoning skills to survive and the story is considered one of Poe&#x27;s early examples of science fiction.

===Major themes===
* Ratiocination (see also &quot;The Mystery of Marie Rogêt&quot;, &quot;The Purloined Letter&quot;, C. Auguste Dupin)
* Sea tale (see also &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot;, &quot;MS. Found in a Bottle&quot;, &quot;The Oblong Box&quot;)
* Story within a story (see also &quot;The Oval Portrait&quot;)

===Allusions===
The story mentions Jonas Danilssønn Ramus, a man from Norway who wrote about a famous maelström at Saltstraumen. The opening epigraph is quoted from an essay by Joseph Glanvill called &quot;Against Confidence in Philosophy and Matters of Speculation&quot; (1676), though Poe altered the wording significantly.

==Critical response==
Shortly after its publication, the April 28 issue of the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; included the notice &quot;The &#x27;Descent into the Maelstroom&#x27; by Edgar A. Poe, Esq., is unworthy of the pen of one whose talents allow him a wider and more ample range.&quot; Mordecai M. Noah in &quot;Evening Star&quot;, however, said the tale &quot;appears to be equal in interest with the powerful article from his pen in the last number, &#x27;The Murder in the Rue Morgue&#x27;&quot;. In 1911, Richmond professor Robert Armistead Stewart said the story was &quot;the most enthralling of that trio of tales of pseudo-science that demonstrate Poe&#x27;s wizard power&quot; along with &quot;MS. Found in a Bottle&quot; and &quot;The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall&quot;.

==Adaptations==
In 1953, pianist Lennie Tristano recorded &quot;Descent into the Maelstrom&quot;, inspired by the short story. It was an improvised solo piano piece that used multitracking and had no preconceived harmonic structure, being based instead on the development of motifs.

In 1968, Editora Taika (Brazil) published a comic adaptation by Francisco De Assis, with art by Edegar and Ignacio Justo, entitled &quot;Descida No Maelstrom!&quot; in &quot;Album Classicos De Terror #7&quot;. It was reprinted in &quot;Zarapelho #3&quot; in 1976.

In 1974, Skywald published a comic adaptation by Al Hewetson in &quot;Psycho #18&quot; with art by Cesar Lopez Vera. It was reprinted by Ibero Mundial De Ediciones (Spain) in &quot;Dossier Negro #66&quot; (1974) and by Eternity Comics in &quot;Edgar Allan Poe: The Pit and the Pendulum and Other Stories #1&quot; in 1988.

In 1975, Warren Publishing released a comic adaptation by Richard Margopoulos, with art by Adolpho Usero Abellan, in &quot;Creepy #70&quot;. This version has been reprinted multiple times.

In 1979, Crack released their first and only album, &quot;Si Todo Hiciera Crack&quot;, which included &quot;Descenso en el Maelström,&quot; an instrumental track based on the short story.

In 1986, American composer Philip Glass was commissioned by the Australian Dance Theatre to write a piece inspired by the story.

In 1993, Novedades Editores (Mexico) published a comic adaptation in &quot;Clasicos De Terror #4&quot;, &quot;Cayendo En El Maestrom&quot;. Adapter and artist are unknown.

==References in literary works==
In 1962, British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke wrote the short story &quot;Maelstrom II&quot; inspired by Poe&#x27;s story. It was first published by &quot;Playboy&quot; and can also be found in Clarke&#x27;s anthology, &quot;The Wind from the Sun&quot;. The story is set in the orbit of the Moon rather than at sea.

In 1970, Czechoslovakian writer Ludvík Vaculík made many references to &quot;A Descent into the Maelström&quot; as well as &quot;The Black Cat&quot; in his novel &quot;The Guinea Pigs&quot;. 
In Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Player Piano&quot;, Paul Proteus thinks to himself &quot;Descent into the Maelstrom&quot; as he succumbs to the will of his wife. 
In Liu Cixin&#x27;s &quot;Death&#x27;s End&quot;, Poe and this short story are both referenced, and some of the characters visit Moskstraumen.

<doc id="143837" wikidata="Q6928495" url="?curid=143837" title="Mr. Buechner's Dream">
<text>Mr Buechner&#x27;s Dream is the thirteenth studio album by Christian alternative rock band Daniel Amos, issued in 2001 by Stunt Records. It was the band&#x27;s first album in six years - and last for twelve years - and the only double album in their catalog.

==Background==
Although the album includes over 30 songs, the band did not set out to record a double album. &quot;I think Chris Colbert (the band&#x27;s engineer) thought we were a little crazy. It’s my sense that the sheer joy of being together again in a creative setting after a seven years absence opened the floodgates of the creativity I believe is unique to Daniel Amos&quot;, explains Taylor, the band&#x27;s lyricist.

Lyrically the album reflected the tumultuous events experienced by members of the band in recent years: the death of two young and very dear friends, including producer and studio owner Gene Eugene, cancer in Taylor&#x27;s family, and in the families of other close friends.

The &quot;Mr Buechner&quot; referred to in the title is Pulitzer Prize nominated author Frederick Buechner, who has been a major inspiration on the band&#x27;s lyrics for years. The album also pays tribute to authors Walker Percy, T. S. Eliot, G. K. Chesterton, Flannery O&#x27;Connor, Lewis Carroll, and Dorothy L. Sayers.

Some of the studio sessions and rehearsals for the album were filmed by friends of the band. Those films were later edited together to create a &quot;behind the scenes&quot; DVD, appropriately entitled &quot;The Making of Mr. Buechner&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

==Reissue==
For the album&#x27;s tenth anniversary in 2011, Stunt Records rereleased the CD with an expanded booklet and one bonus track - &quot;Nowhere Is Someplace,&quot; a song that was originally only released through the band&#x27;s website in 2001 and on the Making of.. DVD.
