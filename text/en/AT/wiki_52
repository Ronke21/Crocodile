<text>Inverclyde (, , , &quot;mouth of the Clyde&quot;) is one of 32 council areas used for local government in Scotland. Together with the East Renfrewshire and Renfrewshire council areas, Inverclyde forms part of the historic county of Renfrewshire, which currently exists as a registration county and lieutenancy area. Inverclyde is located in the west central Lowlands. It borders the North Ayrshire and Renfrewshire council areas, and is otherwise surrounded by the Firth of Clyde.

Inverclyde was formerly one of nineteen districts within Strathclyde Region, from 1975 until 1996. Prior to 1975, Inverclyde was governed as part of the local government county of Renfrewshire, comprising the burghs of Greenock, Port Glasgow and Gourock, and the former fifth district of the county. Its landward area is bordered by the Kelly, North and South Routen burns to the southwest (separating Wemyss Bay and Skelmorlie, North Ayrshire), part of the River Gryfe and the Finlaystone Burn to the south-east.

It is one of the smallest in terms of area () and population () out of the 32 Scottish unitary authorities. Along with the council areas clustered around Glasgow it is considered part of Greater Glasgow in some definitions, although it is physically separated from the city area by open countryside and does not share a border with the city.

The name derives from the extinct barony of Inverclyde (1897) conferred upon Sir John Burns of Wemyss Bay and his heirs.

==Council==

==History==
Inverclyde was created as a district in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which established a two-tier structure of local government across mainland Scotland comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Inverclyde was one of nineteen districts created within the region of Strathclyde. The district covered the area of four former districts from the historic county of Renfrewshire, all of which were abolished at the same time:
*Greenock Burgh
*Gourock Burgh
*Port Glasgow Burgh
*Fifth District, being the landward (outside a burgh) parts of the parishes of Greenock, Inverkip, Port Glasgow, and Kilmacolm.

The new district was named Inverclyde, meaning &quot;mouth of the River Clyde&quot;, a name which had been coined in 1897 for the title of Baron Inverclyde which was conferred upon John Burns of Castle Wemyss, a large house at Wemyss Bay. The remaining parts of Renfrewshire were divided between the Eastwood and Renfrew districts. The three districts together formed a single lieutenancy area.

In 1996 the districts and regions were replaced with unitary council areas under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994. In the debates leading up to that act, the government initially proposed replacing these three districts with two council areas: &quot;West Renfrewshire&quot;, covering Inverclyde district and the western parts of Renfrew district, and &quot;East Renfrewshire&quot;, covering Eastwood district and the eastern parts of Renfrew district. The proposals were not supported locally, with Inverclyde successfully campaigning to be allowed to form its own council area. The new council areas came into effect on 1 April 1996.

==National voting==
In the 2014 independence referendum, the &quot;No&quot; vote won in Inverclyde by just 86 votes and a margin of 0.2%. By either measure, this was the narrowest result of any of the 32 council areas. In the 2016 EU Referendum, Inverclyde posted a &quot;Remain&quot; vote of almost 64%.

==Education==
Inverclyde has twenty primary schools serving all areas of its settlements. These are:
* Aileymill Primary School, Greenock (merger of Larkfield and Ravenscraig primaries)

==Demography==
The average life expectancy for Inverclyde male residents (2013–2015) is 75.4 years, to rank 28th out of the 32 areas in Scotland. The average Inverclyde female lives for 80.4 years, to rank 26th out 32. There are large health disparities between settlements in Inverclyde with many health indicators being above the Scottish average in certain areas, whilst considerably below in others.

In 2019, the Inverclyde Council Area was rated as the most deprived in Scotland by the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD), with Greenock Town Centre the most deprived community. (The term &quot;deprivation&quot; refers not only to low income according to the BBC, but may also include &quot;fewer resources and opportunities, for example in health and education&quot;.) After the announcement, Deputy leader Jim Clocherty said that he hoped that investment money would arrive soon, and that &quot;no part of Scotland wants to be labelled as the &#x27;most deprived&#x27;&quot;. A £3m investment was scheduled for Greenock Town Centre and there was also plan to create a new cruise visitor centre with other investment funds being expected.

<text>Gamaliel Bailey (December 3, 1807June 5, 1859) was an American physician who left that career to become an abolitionist journalist, editor, and publisher, working primarily in Cincinnati, and Washington, D.C. Anti-abolitionist mobs attacked his offices in both cities during the 1840s.

==Biography==
Born and raised in Mount Holly Township, New Jersey, in 1807, Bailey moved with his family to Philadelphia at the age of nine. He was educated at home and in local schools.

Bailey graduated from the Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, in 1827. He moved to Baltimore, where he served as editor of the &quot;Methodist Protestant&quot;, a religious journal.

In 1831, Bailey moved to Cincinnati, where he set up a medical practice. He also lectured on physiology at the Lane Theological Seminary. Attending the Lane Debates on Slavery in February 1834 between pro- and anti-slavery students, he became an ardent abolitionist. The anti-slavery students withdrew from the seminary in protest for its condemnation of abolitionism.

In 1836, Bailey joined James G. Birney in the editorial control of &quot;The Philanthropist&quot;, the official newspaper of the Ohio Anti-Slavery Society. The following year he succeeded Birney as editor. He directed the paper in publishing anti-slavery articles until 1847, in spite of threats and acts of violence — the printing office of &quot;The Philanthropist&quot; was wrecked three times by pro-slavery mobs.

Beginning in 1843, Bailey also edited a daily paper, the &quot;Herald.&quot; In 1847, he assumed control of the new abolitionist publication, &quot;The National Era,&quot; in Washington, D.C. His offices were attacked by pro-slavery mobs; in 1848, he and his printers were under siege for three days as a mob held them hostage. This paper had a considerable circulation nationally. In 1851–1852, it published Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s novel, &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin,&quot; in serial form.

In December 1854, Bailey helped to persuade Montgomery Blair to represent Dred Scott in his Supreme Court case &quot;pro bono&quot;, by agreeing to underwrite his expenses. By May 11, 1857, the Scott case had incurred $63.18 in court costs and $91.50 for the printing of briefs. Bailey asked the 75 Republican members of Congress to contribute $2.00 each and covered the rest himself.

In 1859, Bailey died at the age of 51 at sea, aboard the steamship &quot;Arago&quot;, while en route to Europe. His body was originally buried in Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C. His wife, Margaret Lucy Shands Bailey, died in 1888 and was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery, across the city. Bailey&#x27;s son, Marcellus, had his father&#x27;s remains disinterred and reburied in an unmarked grave next to Margaret.

<text>West Sussex is a ceremonial county in South East England. It is bordered by Surrey to the north, East Sussex to the east, the English Channel to the south, and Hampshire to the west. The largest settlement is Crawley, and the county town is the city of Chichester.

The county has a land area of and a population of . Along the south coast is a near-continuous urban area which includes the towns of Bognor Regis (63,855), Littlehampton (55,706), and Worthing (111,338); the latter two are part of the Brighton and Hove built-up area, which extends into East Sussex and has a total population of 474,485. The interior of the county is generally rural; the largest towns are Crawley (118,493) and Horsham (50,934), both located in the north-east; Chichester is in the south-west and has a population of 26,795. West Sussex contains seven local government districts, which are part of a two-tier non-metropolitan county administered by West Sussex County Council. West Sussex and East Sussex were historically the single county Sussex.

The South Downs are a defining feature of the county, crossing it from east to west and dividing the north and south. The downs are a chalk escarpment which falls away sharply into the Weald to the north and more gently toward the south, where there is a narrow strip of flat land between the hills and the coast. The coastal strip widens to the west, where it is punctuated by Chichester Harbour which is a ria.

The county has a long history of human settlement dating back to the Lower Paleolithic era. During the Roman conquest of Britain, Romans conquered the Atrebates, West Sussex&#x27;s indigenous Britons, and incorporated the area as a Roman province. During the Early Middle Ages, the Saxons settled the area, establishing the Kingdom of Sussex in 477, which lasted until when the kingdom was annexed by Wessex. It has a number of stately homes including Goodwood, Petworth House and Uppark, and castles such as Arundel Castle and Bramber Castle.

==History==
The name Sussex, derived from the Old English &#x27;Sūþseaxe&#x27; (&#x27;South Saxons&#x27;), dates from the Saxon period between AD 477 to 1066, and the history of human habitation in Sussex goes back to the Old Stone Age. The oldest hominin remains known in Britain were found at Eartham Pit, Boxgrove. Prehistoric monuments include the Devil&#x27;s Jumps, a group of Bronze Age burial mounds, and the Iron Age Cissbury Ring and Chanctonbury Ring hill forts on the South Downs.

The Roman period saw the building of Fishbourne Roman Palace and rural villas such as Bignor Roman Villa together with a network of roads including Stane Street, the Chichester to Silchester Way and the Sussex Greensand Way. The Romans used the Weald for iron production on an industrial scale.

The foundation of the Kingdom of Sussex is recorded by the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; for the year AD 477; it says that Ælle arrived at a place called Cymenshore in three ships with his three sons and killed or put to flight the local inhabitants. The foundation story is regarded as somewhat of a myth by most historians, although the archaeology suggests that Saxons did start to settle in the area in the late 5th century. The Kingdom of Sussex was absorbed into Wessex as an earldom and became the county of Sussex.

With its origins in the kingdom of Sussex, the later county of Sussex was traditionally divided into six units known as rapes. By the 16th century, the three western rapes were grouped together informally, having their own separate Quarter Sessions. These were governed by a separate county council from 1888, the county of Sussex being divided into the administrative counties of East and West Sussex. In 1974, West Sussex was made a single ceremonial county with the coming into force of the Local Government Act 1972. At the same time a large part of the eastern rape of Lewes (the Mid Sussex district which includes the towns of Haywards Heath, Burgess Hill and East Grinstead) was transferred into West Sussex.

Until 1834, provision for the poor and destitute in West Sussex was made at parish level. From 1835 until 1948 eleven Poor Law Unions, each catering for several parishes, took on the job.

==Settlements==

Most settlements in West Sussex are either along the south coast or in Mid Sussex, near the Brighton Main Line and M23/A23 corridor. The town of Crawley is the largest in the county with an estimated population of 106,600. The coastal settlement of Worthing closely follows with a population of 104,600. The seaside resort of Bognor Regis and the market town of Horsham are both large towns. Chichester, the county town, has a cathedral and city status, and is situated not far from the border with Hampshire. Other conurbations of a similar size are Burgess Hill, East Grinstead and Haywards Heath in the Mid Sussex district, Littlehampton in the Arun district, and Lancing, Southwick and Shoreham in the Adur district. Much of the coastal town population is part of the
Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton conurbation.

Rustington and Southwater are the next largest settlements in the county. There are several more towns in West Sussex, including Arundel, Midhurst, Petworth, Selsey, Steyning, Henfield, Pulborough and Storrington. Other notable villages include Billingshurst, Copthorne, Crawley Down, Cuckfield, Hassocks, Hurstpierpoint and Lindfield.

==Geography==
===Physical geography===

West Sussex is bordered by Hampshire to the west, Surrey to the north and East Sussex to the east. The English Channel lies to the south. The area has been formed from Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous rock strata, part of the Weald–Artois Anticline. The eastern part of this ridge, the Weald of Kent, Sussex and Surrey has been greatly eroded, with the chalk surface removed to expose older Lower Cretaceous rocks of the Wealden Group. In West Sussex the exposed rock becomes older towards the north of the county with Lower Greensand ridges along the border with Surrey including the highest point of the county at Blackdown. Erosion of softer sand and clay strata has hollowed out the basin of the Weald leaving a north facing scarp slope of the chalk which runs east and west across the whole county, broken only by the valleys of the River Arun and River Adur. In addition to these two rivers which drain most of the county a winterbourne, the River Lavant, flows intermittently from springs on the dip slope of the chalk downs north of Chichester. Some intermittent streams are known in the local dialect as &quot;rifes&quot;.

The county makes up 1.52% of the total land of England, making it the 30th largest county in the country.

===Climate===
West Sussex is the sunniest county in the United Kingdom, according to Met Office records. Over the 29 years to 2011 it averaged 1902 hours of sunshine per year. Sunshine totals are highest near the coast with Bognor Regis often having the highest in mainland England, including a total of 2237 hours in 1990. Mean annual temperature for southern coastal counties is around 11 °C. The coldest month, January, has mean daily minimum temperatures of around 3 °C near the coast and lower inland. July tends to be the warmest month when mean daily maxima tend to be around 20 °C. A maximum temperature of 35.4 °C occurred at North Heath, Pulborough on 26 June 1976. Coastal high temperatures are often moderated by cooler sea breezes.

Monthly rainfall tends to be highest in autumn and early winter and lowest in the summer months, with July often being the driest month. There is less rainfall from summer convective showers and thunderstorms than in inland areas. The county can suffer both from localised flooding caused by heavy rainfall and from water shortages caused by prolonged periods of below average rainfall. Winter rainfall is needed to recharge the chalk aquifers from which much of the water supply is drawn.

==Communications and transport==
The M23 motorway runs from London to the south of Crawley. The A23 and A24 roads run from London to Brighton and Worthing respectively with the A29 a little further west ending in Bognor Regis. Other major roads are the A272 which runs east to west through the middle of the county and the A27 which does the same but closer to the coast. The A259 is a local alternate route to the A27 in the eastern coastal strip.

Gatwick Airport, which handled over 33 million passengers and had over 250,000 aircraft movements in 2011, is located within the borders of Crawley, and is the second largest airport in the United Kingdom. There is also a considerably smaller local airport at Shoreham Airport and a grass airfield handling light aircraft and helicopters at Chichester/Goodwood Airport. There are three main railway routes: the Brighton Main Line, the Arun Valley Line and the West Coastway Line. The Portsmouth Direct Line serves and occasionally enters the westernmost part of West Sussex, although it has no railway stations in the county.

The Cathedral Church of the Holy Trinity, otherwise called Chichester Cathedral, is the seat of the Anglican Bishop of Chichester. It was founded as a cathedral in 1075, when the seat of the bishop was moved from Selsey Abbey. The cathedral has architecture in both the Norman and the Gothic styles, and has been called by the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner &quot;the most typical English Cathedral&quot;. The Cathedral Church of Our Lady and St Philip Howard in Arundel is the Roman Catholic cathedral of the Diocese of Arundel and Brighton. Built in French Gothic style and dedicated in 1873 as the Catholic parish church of Arundel, it was not designated a cathedral until the foundation of the diocese in 1965.

Bosham Church is partly of Saxon construction and is shown on the Bayeux Tapestry as the local church of late Saxon and Danish kings of England.

Viticulture is a part of the economy, with wineries producing mainly sparkling wine of varied quality.

<text>Nathan Bailey (died 27 June 1742), was an English philologist and lexicographer. He was the author of several dictionaries, including his &quot;Universal Etymological Dictionary&quot;, which appeared in some 30 editions between 1721 and 1802. Bailey&#x27;s &quot;Dictionarium Britannicum&quot; (1730 and 1736) was the primary resource mined by Samuel Johnson for his &quot;Dictionary of the English Language&quot; (1755).

==Life==
Bailey was a Seventh Day Baptist, admitted 1691 to a congregation in Whitechapel, London. He was probably excluded from the congregation by 1718. Later he had a school at Stepney. William Thomas Whitley attributes to him a degree of LL.D.

==Works==
Bailey, with John Kersey the younger, was a pioneer of English lexicography, and changed the scope of dictionaries of the language. Greater comprehensivity became the common ambition. Up to the early eighteenth century, English dictionaries had generally focused on &quot;hard words&quot; and their explanation, for example those of Thomas Blount and Edward Phillips in the generation before. With a change of attention, to include more commonplace words and those not of direct interest to scholars, the number of headwords in English dictionaries increased spectacularly. Innovations were in the areas of common words, dialect, technical terms, and vulgarities. Thomas Chatterton, the literary forger, also obtained many sham-antique words from reading Bailey and Kersey.

Bailey&#x27;s &quot;An Universal Etymological English Dictionary&quot;, from its publication in 1721, became the most popular English dictionary of the 18th century, and went through nearly thirty editions. It was a successor to Kersey&#x27;s &quot;A New English Dictionary&quot; (1702), and drew on it. A supplementary volume of his dictionary appeared in 1727, and in 1730 a folio edition, the &quot;Dictionarium Britannicum&quot; containing many technical terms. Bailey had collaborators, for example John Martyn who worked on botanical terms in 1725.

Samuel Johnson made an interleaved copy the foundation of his own &quot;Johnson&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;. The 1755 edition of Bailey&#x27;s dictionary bore the name of Joseph Nicol Scott also; it was published years after Bailey&#x27;s death, but months only after Johnson&#x27;s dictionary appeared. Now often known as the &quot;Scott-Bailey&quot; or &quot;Bailey-Scott&quot; dictionary, it contained relatively slight revisions by Scott, but massive plagiarism from Johnson&#x27;s work. A twentieth-century lexicographer, Philip Babcock Gove, attacked it retrospectively on those grounds. In all, thirty editions of the dictionary appeared, the last at Glasgow in 1802, in reprints and versions by different booksellers.

Bailey&#x27;s dictionary was also the basis of English-German dictionaries. These included those edited by Theodor Arnold (3rd edition, 1761), Anton Ernst Klausing (8th edition, 1792), and Johann Anton Fahrenkrüger (11th edition, 1810).

Bailey also published a spelling-book in 1726; &quot;All the Familiar Colloquies of Erasmus Translated&quot; (1733), of which a new edition appeared in 1878; &#x27;The Antiquities of London and Westminster,&#x27; 1726; &#x27;Dictionarium Domesticum,&#x27; 1736 (which was also a cookbook on recipes, including fried chicken); Selections from Ovid and Phædrus; and &#x27;English and Latin Exercises.&#x27; In 1883 appeared &#x27;English Dialect Words of the Eighteenth Century as shown in the . . . Dictionary of N. Bailey&#x27;, with an introduction by W. E. A. Axon (English Dialect Society), giving biographical and bibliographical details.

<text>Philip James Bailey (22 April 1816 – 6 September 1902) was an English poet, best known as the author of &quot;Festus&quot;.

==Life==
Bailey was born on 22 April 1816, in Nottingham, the only son of Thomas Bailey by his first wife, Mary Taylor. He was brought up on the poetry of Lord Byron. Educated in Nottingham, he was tutored in classics by Benjamin Carpenter, a Unitarian minister. At the age of 15, he matriculated at Glasgow University. Dropping the idea of becoming a Presbyterian minister, he began in 1833 to study law in a solicitor&#x27;s office in London. On 26 April 1834, he entered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and was called to the bar on 7 May 1840, but never practised law.

In 1836, Bailey retired to his father&#x27;s house at Old Basford, near Nottingham, to write. In 1856, he received a civil list pension in recognition of his literary work. In 1864, he moved to Jersey, and travelled. In 1876, he returned to England, settling first at Lee near Ilfracombe, and in 1885 at Blackheath. Finally he retired to Nottingham. In June 1901, he received the honorary Doctor of Laws (DLL) from the University of Glasgow.

Bailey died of influenza on 6 September 1902. He was buried in Nottingham Rock (aka Church) Cemetery after a service at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Nottingham.

== Works ==
Bailey is known almost exclusively by his one voluminous poem, &quot;Festus&quot;, first published anonymously in 1839, and then expanded with a second edition in 1845. A vast pageant of theology and philosophy, it comprised in some twelve divisions an attempt to represent the relation of God to man, and to postulate &quot;a gospel of faith and reason combined.&quot;

Among the admirers of &quot;Festus&quot; was Tennyson. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow imitated it in &quot;The Golden Legend&quot; (1851). Bailey himself described his approach with the neologism &quot;omnist&quot;. Margaret Fuller was an enthusiast for the work, if with critical reservations.

The subsequent poems of Bailey, &quot;The Angel World&quot; (1850), &quot;The Mystic&quot; (1855), &quot;The Age&quot; (1858), and &quot;The Universal Hymn&quot; (1867), were failures. The author then incorporated large extracts of these into the later editions of &quot;Festus&quot;, which ultimately extended to over 40,000 lines when the final edition was published in 1889. At one time his work was immensely popular, admired for its &#x27;fire of imagination&#x27; (Elizabeth Barrett Browning), but, like the other works of the Spasmodic school of which Bailey was considered the father, it is now little read.

In 2021, Edinburgh University Press published a critical edition of &quot;Festus&quot;, edited by Mischa Willett.

<text>A historic house generally meets several criteria before being listed by an official body as &quot;historic.&quot; Generally the building is at least a certain age, depending on the rules for the individual list. A second factor is that the building be in recognizably the same form as when it became historic. Third is a requirement that either an event of historical importance happened at the site, or that a person of historical significance was associated with the site, or that the building itself is important for its architecture or interior. Many historic houses are also considered museums and retain permanent collections that help tell the story of their house and the era.

== Background ==
Houses were first thought of as &quot;historic&quot; rather than just &quot;old&quot; or &quot;interesting&quot;, during the early nineteenth century. Government protection was first given during the late nineteenth century.

Historic homes are often eligible for special grant awards for preservation. What makes a historic home significant is often its architecture or its importance to the culture or history of the area. There are some organizations that offer services to research the history of a home and others that provide repositories for users to document the history of their homes.

Historic homes may still be inhabited, and thus should not be confused with historic house museums.

== Historic houses in the United States ==
Houses are increasingly being designated as historic in the United States as a way to resuscitate neighbourhoods and increase the economic health of surrounding urban areas. Designating a house as historic tends to increase the value of the house as well as others in the same neighbourhood. This can result in increased development of nearby properties, creating a ripple effect that spreads to surrounding neighbourhoods. In some cases, fees are assessed of homeowners during the designation process, so there is not necessarily an economic benefit to doing so.

<text>Samuel Bailey (5 July 1791 – 18 January 1870) was a British philosopher, economist and writer. He was called the &quot;Bentham of Hallamshire&quot;.

==Life==
Bailey was born at Sheffield on 5 July 1791, the son of Joseph Bailey and Mary Eadon. His father was among the first of those Sheffield merchants who went to the United States to establish trade connections. After a few years in his father&#x27;s business, he retired from all business concerns with an ample fortune, although he remained connected with the Sheffield Banking Company, of which he was a founder in 1831 and served as chairman for many years. Although an ardent liberal, he took little part in political affairs. On two occasions, he stood for Sheffield as a &quot;philosophic radical&quot; parliamentary candidate, but without success.

His life is for the most part a history of his numerous and varied publications. He died suddenly on 18 January 1870, leaving over £80,000 to the town trustees of Sheffield for public use.

==Thought==
His first work, &quot;Essays on the Formation and Publication of Opinions&quot;, published anonymously in 1821, attracted more attention than any of his other writings. A sequel to it appeared in 1829, &quot;Essays on the Pursuit of Truth&quot;. Between these two were &quot;Questions in Political Economy, Politics, Morals, &amp;c.&quot; (1823), and a &quot;Critical Dissertation on the Nature, Measure, and Causes of Value&quot; (1825), directed against the opinions of David Ricardo and his school.

His next publications also were on economic or political subjects, &quot;Rationale of Political Representation&quot; (1835), and &quot;Money and its Vicissitudes&quot; (1837) and he has been regarded as one of the main theorists of Free banking. About the same time, there also appeared some of his pamphlets, &quot;Discussion of Parliamentary Reform&quot;, &quot;Right of Primogeniture Examined&quot;, &quot;Defence of Joint-Stock Banks&quot;. In 1842 appeared his &quot;Review of Berkeley&#x27;s Theory of Vision&quot; which called forth rejoinders from John Stuart Mill in the &quot;Westminster Review&quot; and from James Frederick Ferrier in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. Bailey replied to his critics in a &quot;Letter to a Philosopher&quot; (1843), &amp;c.

In 1851 he published &quot;Theory of Reasoning&quot;, a discussion of the nature of inference, and an able criticism of the functions and value of the syllogism. In 1852 he published &quot;Discourses on Various Subjects&quot;; and finally summed up his philosophic views in the &quot;Letters on the Philosophy of the Human Mind&quot; (three series, 1855, 1858, 1863). The &quot;Letters&quot; contain a discussion of many of the principal problems in psychology and ethics. Bailey can hardly be classed as belonging either to the strictly empirical or to the idealist school, but his general tendency is towards the former.

In regard to method, he founds psychology entirely on introspection. He thus, to a certain extent, agrees with the Scottish School, but he differs from them in rejecting altogether the doctrine of mental faculties. What have been designated faculties are, upon his view, merely classified facts or phenomena of consciousness. He criticizes very severely the habitual use of metaphorical language in describing mental operations.

His doctrine of perception, which is, in brief, that &quot;the perception of external things through the organs of sense is a direct mental act or phenomenon of consciousness not susceptible of being resolved into anything else,&quot; and the reality of which can be neither proved nor disproved, is not worked out in detail, but is supported by elaborate and sometimes subtle criticisms of all other theories. With regard to general and abstract ideas and general propositions, his opinions are those of the empirical school, but his analysis frequently puts the matter in a new light.

In the theory of morals, Bailey is an advocate of utilitarianism (though he objects to the term &quot;utility&quot; as being narrow and, to the unthinking, of sordid content), and works out with great skill the steps in the formation of the &quot;complex&quot; mental facts involved in the recognition of duty, obligation, right.

He bases all moral phenomena on five facts:
* Man is susceptible to pleasure (and pain);
* he likes (or dislikes) their causes;
* he desires to reciprocate pleasure and pain received;
* he expects such reciprocation from others;
* he feels more or less sympathy with the same feelings in his fellows (cf. &quot;Letters&quot;, 3rd series).

In 1845 he published &quot;Maro&quot; a poem in four cantos (85 pp., Longmans), containing a description of a young poet who printed 1000 copies of his first poem, of which only 10 were sold. He was a diligent student of Shakespeare, and his last literary work was &quot;On the Received Text of Shakespeare&#x27;s Dramatic Writings and its Improvement&quot; (1862).

<text>Vatnajökull (Icelandic pronunciation: , literally &quot;Glacier of Lakes&quot;; sometimes translated as Vatna Glacier in English) is the largest and most voluminous ice cap in Iceland, and the second largest in area in Europe after the Severny Island ice cap of Novaya Zemlya. It is in the south-east of the island, covering approximately 10% of the country.

==Size==
With an area of 7,700 km2,

Vatnajökull is the second largest ice cap in Europe by volume (about 3,000 km3) and area (after the still larger Severny Island ice cap of Novaya Zemlya, Russia, which is in the extreme northeast of Europe). On 7 June 2008, it became a part of the Vatnajökull National Park.

The average thickness of the ice is , with a maximum thickness of . Iceland&#x27;s highest peak, Hvannadalshnúkur (), as part of the Öræfajökull, is in the southern periphery of Vatnajökull, near Skaftafell.


==Peaks==
Hrútsfjallstindar is a series of Icelandic peaks rising from Vatnajökull between Svínafellsjökull and Skaftafellsjökull, in its southern part. There are four peaks, which range from to high.

==Volcanoes==
Under the ice cap, as under many of the glaciers of Iceland, there are several volcanoes. Eruptions from these volcanoes have led to the development of large pockets of water beneath the ice, which may burst the weakened ice and cause a jökulhlaup (glacial lake outburst flood). During the last ice age, numerous volcanic eruptions occurred under Vatnajökull, creating many subglacial eruptions.

In more modern times, the volcanoes continue to erupt beneath the glaciers, resulting in many documented floods. One jökulhlaup in 1934 caused the release of of water over the course of several days. The volcanic lake Grímsvötn was the source of a large jökulhlaup in 1996. There was also a considerable but short-lived eruption of the volcano under these lakes at the beginning of November 2004. On 21 May 2011 a volcanic eruption started in Grímsvötn in Vatnajökull National Park at around 19:00. The plume reached up to .

==In culture==
An Icelandic older name for Vatnajökull was Klofajökull (Cleft Glacier, due to cuts into the ice several of which can be presumed to be liable for the name), which is known from eighteenth-century sources such as the writings of Eggert Ólafsson and Bjarni Pálsson. In September 1950, a Douglas DC-4 operated by the private airline Loftleiðir crash-landed on the Vatnajökull glacier. The entire six-person crew survived. A rescue operation was launched after the crew managed to send a distress signal on the fourth day. The crew and the rescue team walked the 34 km to safety.

The glacier was used as the setting for the opening sequence (set in Siberia) of the 1985 James Bond film &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, in which Bond (played for the last time by Roger Moore) eliminated a host of armed villains before escaping in a submarine to Alaska. Several other films, including another in the Bond franchise, have been filmed on or using Jökulsárlón, the terminal lake of the Breiðamerkurjökull outlet from Vatnajökull.

In 2004, Vatnajökull was one of several Icelandic settings visited on the first leg of &quot;The Amazing Race 6&quot;.

Westlife&#x27;s official music video for their twenty-fifth single top 10 and #2 UK hit in 2009 &quot;What About Now&quot; is the last film of Vatnajökull Glacier before the subsequent volcanic eruption.

In November 2011, the glacier was used as a shooting location for the second season of the HBO fantasy TV series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

==Outlet glaciers==

Vatnajökull has around 30 outlet glaciers flowing from the ice cap. The Icelandic term for glacier is &quot;jökull&quot;, and so is the term for outlet glacier.

<doc id="143073" wikidata="Q737657" url="?curid=143073" title="Langjökull">
<text>Langjökull (, Icelandic for &quot;long glacier&quot;) is the second largest ice cap in Iceland (), after Vatnajökull. It is situated in the west of the Icelandic interior or Highlands of Iceland and can be seen clearly from Haukadalur. It covers the higher parts of the Langjökull volcanic system.

Its volume is and the ice is up to thick. The highest point of the ice cap (at &quot;Baldjökull&quot; at the northern end of Langjökull) is about above sea level.

In the past, the largest recorded surface area was in 1840.

==Situation and form==
The glacier is roughly parallel to the direction of the country&#x27;s active volcanic zone: north-east to south-west. It is about long and wide, and has a slightly narrower point roughly between the lake Hvítárvatn on the Kjölur mountain road to the east and the Þrístapajökull glacier to the west, near another smaller glacier, Eiríksjökull, which is not quite connected to Langjökull. It is the nearest large glacier to Reykjavík.

The area of the glacier includes some mountains, e.g. &quot;Jarlhettur&quot; (; &quot;The earl&#x27;s hat&quot;) on the east side of Langjökull, a palagonitic mountain range, which originated in a fissure vent under a glacier during the Ice Age.

The mountain &quot;Skríðufell&quot; () is situated on the east, above lake Hvítárvatn. Other mountains on the eastern side of Langjökull are &quot;Fjallkirkja&quot; (), &quot;Þursaborg&quot; () and &quot;Péturshorn&quot; ().

A little to the east of &quot;Fjallkirkja&quot; is the hut of the Icelandic Glacier Research Society (also called Jöklarannsóknarfélag in the ), which includes scientists as well as interested amateurs.

==Glaciers in the area==
A number of outlet glaciers reach down from Langjökull to the valleys and plains below. However various different names exist for these outlet areas and there are outlet areas that do not have glacial names. The outlets include &quot;Norðurjökull&quot; and &quot;Suðurjökull&quot; to the east, separated by the &quot;Skriðufell&quot; glacier outlet area; &quot;Eystri-Hagafellsjökull (Hagafellsjökull eystri)&quot; at the southern end of Langjökull which is separated from &quot;Suðurjökull&quot; by the &quot;Skálpanes&quot; and &quot;Jarlhettur&quot; glacier outlet areas; the mountain &quot;Hagafell&quot; which is also a small outlet area between &quot;Eystri-Hagafellsjökull&quot; and &quot;Vestri-Hagafellsjökull (Hagafellsjökull vestari)&quot; ; &quot;Lónsjökull&quot; (&quot;Lónjökull&quot;) between it and &quot;Geitlandsjökull&quot; () an outpost to the south-west, with its glacier covering a tuya; &quot;Svartárjökull&quot;, &quot;Flosajökull&quot; (&quot;Flosakarðsjöklar&quot; catchment), &quot;Þrístapajökull&quot; and &quot;Baldjökull&quot; to the west. From the north east on the far side of the &quot;Baldjökull&quot; catchment there is &quot;Pjófadalajökull&quot;, &quot;Hengibjörg&quot;, &quot;Leiðarjökull&quot; and &quot;Kirkjujökull&quot; catchments. The old icecap marginal glacier name of Bláfellsjökull for Suðurjökull is no longer used.
Research shows that the outlet glaciers &quot;Norðurjökull&quot; and &quot;Suðurjökull&quot; reached as far as lake Hvítárvatn until about 1900 but have retreated rapidly since then.

==Water flow and development of the glacier==
Despite the size of Langjökull, not many rivers directly originate there. However research has shown that large quantities of water flow in sub-surface streams to lake Þingvallavatn (some to the south and easily accessible to tourists) and reappear in springs in and around the lake, while the same happens on the west side, giving rise to various tributaries of the Hvítá River as well as some rivers flowing north towards Húnaflói. Thus many of the hot springs in the Borgarfjörður region (near the estuary of the Hvítá on the west coast), such as Deildartunguhver, receive ground water from Langjökull.

The same is true for the lake Hvítárvatn to the east: ⅔ of its waters appear to come from Langjökull by underwater channels.

Langjökull is shrinking quite fast, and some researchers believe that it will disappear in about 150 years if climate change continues at its recent pace.
==Volcanism==
Under Langjökull there are volcanoes with several components. The calderas can easily be seen from the air. The best known of these is Hveravellir with its hot spring and high temperature area to the east of the glacier. During an Ice Age some shield volcanoes of this system covered the plains with lava in the region of today&#x27;s Kjölur mountain road: the &quot;Kjalhraun&quot; (; &quot;hraun&quot; means &quot;lava field&quot;). Some of this lava field is about 7,800 years old.

A smaller volcanic system lies to the north-west of the glacier in the , north of the glacier Eiríksjökull. About 1,000 years ago, the craters of this system produced the lava field &quot;Hallmundarhraun&quot; which extends some westward into the valley of the Hvítá, and is traversed by underground streams which emerge at the waterfalls of Hraunfossar not far from Húsafell.

Another volcanic system to the south-west of Langjökull is Presthnúkur, named after its central volcano, a rhyolite dome with a high temperature area at its foot. Its fissures extend under Langjökull.

Volcanically, the region is relatively quiet, compared to other regions in Iceland, with just 32 eruptions in the last 10,000 years.

==Highland roads==

Two highland tracks, open in the summer months, lead alongside this glacier: the Kaldidalur and Kjölur tracks.

The former (road 550) runs along the west of Langjökull, between it and the small Ok glacier. To the south it leads towards Þingvellir and Reykjavík, while to the north it leads to the Hvítá valley which leads down towards Borgarnes. Kaldidalur is no longer classified by the Icelandic road authorities as an F-road. Nevertheless, rental car companies forbid their clients to drive on the road with other cars than four-wheel drives. 
Road F551 goes right to the edge of the glacier from Kaldidalur.

The latter (road F35) runs along the east side of Langjökull, between it and Hofsjökull. It is the main route across the interior between the main population centres in the SW and the N of the country, but nevertheless traffic is extremely sparse.

==Tourism==
Langjökull attracts visitors who are captivated by its immense size and natural beauty. The glacier offers a unique experience for adventure enthusiasts and nature lovers alike. With its easily accessible location in the Icelandic interior, Langjökull provides opportunities for various activities, such as glacier hiking, snowmobiling, monster truck ride, and exploring natural ice caves and man-made tunnels. These experiences provide a different perspective of the glacier and its surroundings, enhancing the overall visit to Langjökull.

Located near popular tourist routes like the Golden Circle, Langjökull holds a prominent position in Iceland&#x27;s tourism industry. Its significant contribution to the surrounding natural wonders, such as Gullfoss waterfall and Geysir&#x27;s geothermal area, adds to its allure. The glacier&#x27;s proximity to these iconic sites makes it a sought-after destination for travelers seeking to witness the awe-inspiring effects of glacial forces on the landscape.

It is important to note the importance of responsible tourism practices to preserve and protect Langjökull. Visitors are encouraged to respect the environment and follow sustainable guidelines to ensure the long-term preservation of this remarkable glacier.
==In popular culture== 
The glacier is featured in the final scene of the 1999 animated film &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;, directed by Brad Bird, where the titular Giant&#x27;s parts, scattered by his destruction at the film&#x27;s climax, converge on his head to begin reassembling him.

The first chapter of “The Last Orphan” by Gregg Hurwitz takes place on top of the glacier.

<text>Abraham &quot;Abe&quot; Benjamin Cunningham (born July 27, 1973) is an American musician, best known as the drummer of the alternative metal band Deftones.

==Early life==
Abe Cunningham was born in Long Beach, California. When he was young, his family moved to Sacramento. He first started drumming in his early teens playing the drums for the band Phallucy in the early 90s. During this time, he also drummed for Deftones on the side, when the band was having problems landing a permanent and dedicated drummer. At the time when he started learning drums, he also learned how to play guitar, but growing up with a stepfather (Neil) who played the drums, he took a deeper passion with the drums. Abe&#x27;s father, Sid, was also a musician and an early influence for Abe before his untimely passing. His influences include Stewart Copeland, Ginger Baker and Mitch Mitchell.

==Artistry==
Cunningham is known for his frantic, pounding rhythms on such songs as &quot;Knife Prty&quot; and clever usage of tempo (&quot;Mein&quot;), while at the same time refusing to indulge in the double bass drum setup of many metal traditionalists. However, he does use a double bass pedal as part of his kit, as seen in various drum magazines. A BBC reviewer has praised his style for displaying &quot;the assured expressiveness of a musician whose abilities stretch further than most metal-scene sticksmen&quot;.

==Other ventures==
Cunningham has been a long time endorser of Tama Drums and Zildjian Cymbals, and for most of his career, has played the same setup. He has been featured in various ads for Tama and Zildjian. He is an endorser of Vater drumsticks, and at the 2017 NAMM Show revealed his new signature Vater drumsticks, the model is called &quot;Cool Breeze&quot; (which is Abe&#x27;s nickname of sorts).

==Personal life==
Cunningham lives in Sacramento, California, with his family. He has two sons, Sidney and Daniel, with his ex-wife, Annalynn Seal. Annalynn made a guest appearance on &quot;MX&quot; singing along with Chino Moreno.

<text>Stephen &quot;Steph&quot; Carpenter ( ; born August 3, 1970) is an American musician, known as the co-founder and lead guitarist of the alternative metal band Deftones.

His guitar technique makes use of both ringing open strings and dissonant chord voicings, as well as stock power chords in polyrhythms. Carpenter began his musical career with Deftones playing the traditional six-string guitar. After becoming influenced by such bands as Fear Factory and Meshuggah, he began playing a seven-string guitar in the late 1990s. After Deftones&#x27; third album &quot;White Pony&quot;, subsequent releases would be written with seven-strings, until 2010&#x27;s &quot;Diamond Eyes&quot; and 2012&#x27;s &quot;Koi No Yokan&quot;, which were written with an eight-string guitar. Starting with 2020&#x27;s &quot;Ohms&quot;, songs have been written with nine-string guitars.
Carpenter was ranked 60th in Guitar World&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists&quot; poll.

==Early life==
Stephen Carpenter was born on August 3, 1970, in Sacramento, California, to an American father and a Mexican mother. He has a sister named Marci. He is first cousin to Testament singer Chuck Billy. He grew up in the Sacramento area and pursued many hobbies, including skateboarding.

When Carpenter was 15 years old, he was hit by a car while skateboarding. He used a wheelchair for several months. It was at this point that he began teaching himself guitar by playing along with the records of bands such as Anthrax, Stormtroopers of Death and Metallica. It has been reported that the driver paid Carpenter a cash settlement that allowed the band to purchase equipment, but drummer Abe Cunningham commented in an interview that this was &quot;a myth about how our band was started.&quot;

Carpenter attended McClatchy High School with future bandmates Chino Moreno and Abe Cunningham. They were childhood friends and remained friends through the skateboarding scene in Sacramento. When Moreno found out Carpenter played guitar, he set up a jam session with Cunningham and the three began playing regularly in Carpenter&#x27;s garage circa 1988.
After playing with several bassists, the band settled on Chi Cheng and within two years the band began playing club shows and later expanded their playing territory to San Francisco and Los Angeles where they played shows alongside bands such as Korn.

==Artistry==
Carpenter has stated that he mostly listens to hip hop, but outside of hip hop, Meshuggah, Fear Factory, Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, and Faith No More are some of his influences. He has also stated that his favorite album of all time is &quot;Chaosphere&quot; by Meshuggah, saying: &quot;The most brutal record I&#x27;ve heard, from second one to second last. It left me wondering where the hell I&#x27;d been the whole time.&quot; While recording Deftones&#x27; &quot;Diamond Eyes&quot;, he claimed that the only artist he listened to was American rapper Tech N9ne.

==Equipment==

Carpenter currently endorses ESP Guitars, Marshall Amplifiers, Engl Amplifiers, GuitarRig and Fishman Fluence Signature pickups. He has been a major endorser of ESP since the mid-1990s with a number of signature six, seven, eight string and baritone models in production.

Carpenter currently uses Dunlop .011-.069 gauge strings. He also uses Dunlop 1 mm Tortex picks which are black with a custom logo. Carpenter&#x27;s current rig consists of only a Fractal Audio Axe-FX II running straight into the venue&#x27;s PA system. He also uses one or two Electro-Harmonix .22 Caliber pedals to power his monitors.

==Other projects==

Carpenter is a member of the underground instrumental project Sol Invicto, formed by producer Richie Londres alongside Technical Itch &amp; Dan Foord &amp; Eric Bobo of Cypress Hill. The band released its debut EP, &quot;Initium&quot; in 2011 for free. The band&#x27;s second EP, &quot;Initium II&quot; was released in 2013 via the band&#x27;s official SoundCloud page. The final installment of the Initium series was released late 2016. The group&#x27;s music was only available to fans via their private mailing list &quot;The Sol Invicto Comiti&quot; until 2024 when they released their first public EP entitled “Loosely Aware” The band are set to release a full debut album in 2025.

Carpenter was involved in the rap metal band Kush, featuring Christian Olde Wolbers and Raymond Herrera of Fear Factory and B-Real of Cypress Hill. The band&#x27;s debut album, which was set to be released in 2003, was never released.

Carpenter also plays drums. In an interview with &quot;Guitar.com&quot; he reported that he likes drums more than he likes guitars, &quot;as far as when it comes to creating the ideas.&quot; Also on his drumming abilities, he said: 

==Personal life==
His relationship with Deftones lead singer and bandmate Chino Moreno has been reported to alternate between cordial and hostile at times. Though their working relationship was known to be friendly at times; the recording of &quot;Saturday Night Wrist&quot; was protracted due to their supposed &quot;warfare&quot;. With regards to musical tastes, &quot;Saturday Night Wrist&quot; being described as &quot;more aggressive&quot; equated to it being &quot;more aggressive for him [Chino]&quot;; Carpenter said he&#x27;d &quot;definitely be glad to take it to the next level, but that&#x27;s asking too much right now&quot;. During a 2016 interview; Moreno revealed the two had engaged into a backstage altercation following a 2001 concert.

In November 2020, Carpenter revealed his belief in various conspiracy theories, including his belief that the Earth is flat and expressing anti-vaccination beliefs, among others. Commenting on this in 2021, Moreno suggested this may be related to Carpenter&#x27;s cannabis smoking or being affected by his attendance of the Bataclan theatre shortly before the November 2015 Paris attacks.

Since 2022, Carpenter has not toured with Deftones internationally due to fear of traveling, which he developed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lance Jackman and Shaun Lopez will be his live fill-in when he is not performing domestically.

<text>Spokane Valley is a city in Spokane County, Washington, United States, and the largest suburb of Spokane. It is located east of Spokane, west of Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho, and surrounds the city of Millwood on three sides. The city incorporated as the City of Spokane Valley on March 31, 2003. The population was 102,976 at the 2020 census, making it the ninth-most populous city in Washington state. Spokane Valley is named after the valley of the Spokane River, in which it is located. The city and the general area is colloquially referred to as &quot;The Valley&quot; by residents of the Spokane–Coeur d&#x27;Alene area.

Spokane Valley hosts a variety of community events such as the Spokane County Interstate Fair, Valleyfest, and the Inland Northwest Craft Beer Festival and is home to the Spokane Valley Heritage Museum and the home ground of the Spokane Indians minor league baseball team.

==History==
The City of Spokane Valley incorporated on March 31, 2003. At its creation, it was the third-largest newly incorporated city in US history (after Centennial, Colorado, which incorporated in 2001; and Miami Gardens, Florida, which incorporated about five weeks before Spokane Valley).

The city formed from combining the urbanized unincorporated areas east of Spokane City, including census-designated places (CDPs) of Dishman, Opportunity, Trentwood, Veradale, part of Greenacres, and East Spokane. The new city boundaries did not include the incorporated areas such as Millwood and Liberty Lake, nor the protected areas such as the Dishman Hills Natural Area. It was initially delayed by a petition from Spokane, because it included the Yardley industrial area, to which Spokane had already extended utilities, and had plans to annex. Prior to the successful vote May 21, 2002, there had been four failed attempts to form a city in the Valley. The main arguments for incorporation centered around increased voice in local governance and the threat of annexation by the City of Spokane. The main arguments against incorporation included contentment with Spokane County provided services and the threat of increased taxes and bureaucracy by the new city. Both sides claimed their opponents&#x27; arguments were entirely untrue scare tactics.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Water features in the city include Shelley Lake, a small lake which is fed by the Saltese Creek.

The City of Spokane Valley lies along the banks of the Spokane River as it flows from its source in Lake Coeur d&#x27;Alene on its way to the Columbia River at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake reservoir. The city lies along both banks of the river, but most of the city lies to the south of the river. To the south of the valley in which the city sits is the southern extent of the Selkirk Mountains, which are most prominent in the area east of Coeur d&#x27;Alene. The valley is within the Northern Rockies Level III ecoregion. The valley exhibits signs of the prehistoric geologic events that shaped the area and region such as the Missoula Floods which ended 12,000 to 15,000 years ago. The Spokane valley was gouged out by repeated failures in the ice dam that held Glacial Lake Missoula.

The city limits are roughly defined to the west and southwest by Havana Street and the Dishman Hills Conservation Area; to the north by Felts Field, the City of Millwood, the Spokane River, and a few minor roads north of the river; to the east by Barker Road; and to the south by the small hills which divide the city from the Palouse region.

The city of Spokane Valley is part of the Spokane–Coeur d&#x27;Alene Combined Statistical Area (CSA) and lies between the two anchor cities, directly east of Spokane and to the west of Coeur d&#x27;Alene. The city is also part of the wider Inland Northwest region, consisting of eastern Washington, northern Idaho, northwestern Montana, and northeastern Oregon.

<text>Frank Delgado (born November 29, 1970) is an American musician, best known as the keyboardist and turntablist for alternative metal band Deftones.

==Musical career==

===Deftones===
Delgado came to the attention of Deftones as a member of the Sacramento-based hip hop group, Socialistik, a frequent opener for Deftones. He appeared as a guest performer on Deftones&#x27; first two albums, &quot;Adrenaline&quot; and &quot;Around the Fur&quot;, and was formally inaugurated into the group before their third release, &quot;White Pony&quot;.

His playing rarely features traditional scratching or beat juggling. Instead, he tends to use turntables as samplers to integrate subtle sounds and textures into the music. He prefers to create his own samples, rather than use prerecorded sample banks or borrow sounds from other artists. 

Starting with the band&#x27;s eponymous fourth album, &quot;Deftones&quot;, Delgado began to put more emphasis on keyboards and synthesizers.

===Other activities===
Delgado is a member of the disc jockey collective Decibel Devils.

<doc id="143082" wikidata="Q55299" url="?curid=143082" title="County Laois">
<text>County Laois ( ; ) is a county in Ireland. It is part of the Eastern and Midland Region and in the province of Leinster. It was known as Queen&#x27;s County from 1556 to 1922. The modern county takes its name from Loígis, a medieval kingdom. Historically, it has also been known as County Leix.

Laois County Council is the local authority for the county, and is based in Portlaoise.

At the 2022 census, the population of the county was 91,657, an increase of 56% since the 2002 census.

==History==
===Prehistoric===
The first people in Laois were bands of hunters and gatherers who passed through the county about 8,500 years ago. They hunted in the forests that covered Laois and fished in its rivers, gathering nuts and berries to supplement their diets.

Next came Ireland&#x27;s first farmers. These people of the Neolithic period (4000 to 2500 BC) cleared forests and planted crops. Their burial mounds remain in Clonaslee and Cuffsborough.

Starting around 2500 BC, the people of the Bronze Age lived in Laois. They produced weapons, tools, and golden objects. Visitors to the county can see a stone circle they left behind at Monamonry, as well as the remains of their hill forts at Clopook and Monelly. Skirk, near Borris-in-Ossory, has a Bronze Age standing stone and ring fort. The body of Cashel Man indicates that ritual killing took place around 2000 BC.

The next stage is known as the pre-Christian Celtic Iron Age. For the first time, iron appeared in Ireland, showing up in the weapons used by factions who fought bloody battles for control of the land. At Ballydavis, archaeologists have discovered ring barrows that date from this time period.

The county name derives from Loígis, of which the modern county is only a part. In the 11th century, its dynastic rulers adopted the surname Ua/Ó Mórdha. They claimed descent from a member of the Red Branch Knights.

By the first century AD, the western third of Laois was part of the Kingdom of Ossory. The eastern part was roughly divided into seven parts, which were ruled by the Seven Septs of Loígis:Ua/Ó Mórdha (O&#x27;More,O&#x27;Moore), O&#x27;Lalor, O&#x27;Doran, O&#x27;Dowling, O&#x27;Devoy (O&#x27;Deevy), O&#x27;Kelly and McEvoy.
===Introduction of Christianity===
When Ireland was Christianised, holy men and women founded religious communities in Loígis. St. Ciarán of Saighir (called &quot;The Elder&quot; to distinguish him from the younger St. Ciarán of Clonmacnoise) founded his monastic habitation in the western Slieve Bloom Mountains as the first bishop of Ossory, reputedly before St. Patrick. His mother Liadán had an early convent nearby at what is now Killyon. Between 550 and 600, St. Canice founded Aghaboe Abbey and St. Mochua founded a religious community at Timahoe. An early Christian community lived at Dun Masc or Masc&#x27;s fort, on the Rock of Dunamase.

The Synod of Rathbreasail that established the Irish dioceses was held near Mountrath in 1111, moving the Church away from its monastic base. As religious orders with strong ties to Rome replaced older religious communities, the wooden buildings of the early Christian churches in Laois gave way to stone monasteries. The Augustinians and Dominicans established themselves at Aghaboe Abbey, while the Cistercians took over an older religious community at Abbeyleix.

===Norman invasion===
The Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169–71 affected Laois as it was a part of the Kingdom of Leinster. In Laois, the fortress on the Rock of Dunamase was part of the dowry of the Irish princess Aoife, who was given in marriage in 1170 to the Norman warrior Strongbow. Advancing Normans surveyed the county from wooden towers built on top of earthen mounds, known as mottes. They also built stone fortresses, such as Lea Castle, just outside Portarlington. Several of the county&#x27;s towns were first established as Norman boroughs, including Castletown, Durrow and Timahoe.

From 1175 until about 1325, Normans controlled the best land in the county, while Gaelic society retreated to the bogs, forests and the Slieve Bloom Mountains. The early 14th century saw a Gaelic revival, as the chieftains of Loígis caused the Normans to withdraw. The Dempseys seized Lea Castle, while Dunamase came into the ownership of the O’Mores. Examples of tower houses built by the Irish Mac Giolla Phádraig chieftains are found at Ballaghmore and Cullahill Castle, both decorated with Sheela na gigs.

In 1548, the English confiscated the lands of the O’Mores and built &quot;Campa&quot;, known as the Fort of Leix, today&#x27;s Portlaoise.

=== 16th century colony and County status===

It was shired in 1556 by Queen Mary as Queen&#x27;s County, covering the &quot;countries&quot; of Leix (Loígis), Slewmarge, Irry, and that part of Glimnaliry on the southwest side of the River Barrow. Laois received its present Irish language name following the Irish War of Independence. Laois was also sometimes spelt &quot;Leix&quot;. Portlaoise (previously Maryborough) is the main town of the county.

Loígis was the subject of two organised plantations or colonisations by the Kingdom of England in 1556 and 1607. During the first plantation, Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex attempted to dispossess the ruling O&#x27;Moore clan, who had been engaging in costly raids on The Pale, and settle the area with English colonists. However, this led to a long drawn-out guerrilla war in the county and left only a small colonist community clustered around garrisons. This initial attempt at plantation is widely regarded as a failure by historians, as occupying the territory was far more costly than the money yielded from it, and the scheme attracted fewer settlers than anticipated.

The second, more successful plantation of the county took place in the aftermath of the Nine Years&#x27; War, and expanded the existing English settlements with more landowners and tenants. In 1659, a group of Quakers led by William Edmundson, settled in Mountmellick, while a group of Huguenots were given refuge in Portarlington in 1696 after their service to William of Orange in the Williamite War in Ireland.

What followed was a period of relative calm. Anglo-Irish landowners enclosed the land and built fine houses, including Durrow Castle, Heywood House and Emo Court. In 1836, a branch of the Grand Canal stretched to Mountmellick, further stimulating industry in that town.

The Great Famine of 1845–49 devastated the county. The county&#x27;s workhouses could not cope with the number of destitute people seeking shelter. By the time the workhouse opened at Donaghmore in 1853, many of the poorest had emigrated or died.

The English language was already dominant in much of Leinster by the time of the famine, but the Irish language was still spoken in Laois as late as the 1870s.

The county was known as Queen&#x27;s County () from 1556 until its name was informally changed on the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922. The county&#x27;s name was formerly spelt as &quot;Laoighis&quot; and &quot;Leix&quot;. In the Local Government Act 2001, it is named in the list of counties as &quot;Laois&quot;, although no legislation was enacted explicitly changing the name from Queen&#x27;s County, the name formally established under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 which continued to have legal effect. When land is sold in the county the relevant title deeds are still updated as being in &quot;Queen&#x27;s County&quot;.

==Geography and subdivisions==
Laois is the 23rd in both in area and population of Ireland&#x27;s 32 counties. It is the seventh-largest of Leinster&#x27;s 12 counties in size and tenth largest in population. The county is landlocked and, uniquely, is doubly landlocked, not bordering any other county which touches the coast.

===Climate===
For climatological information see: durrow.ie for averages and extremes.

The weather station at east Durrow was set up in May 2008. The equipment used is a Davis Vantage Pro II that measures temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall and barometric pressure. This data is transmitted every 2 seconds to a website where the data can be freely accessed. The station also reports to the Irish Weather Network which displays live weather data from similar stations all around Ireland.
In addition, a Met Éireann climatological station (Number: 472) was installed in September 2010 and the data collected is sent to headquarters in Glasnevin, Dublin on a monthly basis. The climatological station measures rainfall in a manual gauge, soil temperatures at 5  cm, 10  cm and 20  cm depths, air temperature including wet-bulb, and daily maximum and daily minimum temperatures. The climatological station is a project that is envisaged to last thirty years and collect a climate profile for Durrow and Laois in general.

==Governance and politics==
===Local government===
Laois County Council is the local authority governing County Laois. It has 19 councillors, and is divided into three local electoral areas, each of which is also a municipal district: Borris-in-Ossory-Mountmellick (6), Graiguecullen-Portarlington (6), and Portlaoise (7).

The council has two representatives on the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly where it is part of the Midland strategic planning area.

==Economy==
Industrial parks are located in Portlaoise, Portarlington and Mountmellick. The county receives EU funding as it is part of the cluster of three regions (Border, Midland and West), colloquially known as &quot;BMW&quot;, that qualifies for special funding aid. 

Agricultural activities occupy approximately 70% of the land area of the county (). However agriculture&#x27;s share of income in the &quot;BMW&quot; region has declined sharply in the past decade, and represented only approximately 3.9% of annual income (GVA) in 2005 Central Statistics Office. The remaining area includes considerable stretches of raised bog and the Slieve Bloom mountains, which are partially covered by coniferous forest.

==Railways==
Iarnród Éireann train services along the Dublin-Cork line connects the county between Heuston station and Cork, Limerick, travel through the county, with railway stations at Portarlington, Portlaoise and Ballybrophy. From Portarlington trains run on the Dublin-Galway/Westport/Ballina line to Athlone as well as Galway, Westport and Ballina. From Ballybrophy trains run on the Ballybrophy line to Nenagh and Limerick direct.

Past Railways

There used to be railway stations at Mountmellick and Abbeyleix which now the station houses have become residences.

Both stations stopped in the 60s.

The line was from Kilkenny city to Abbeyleix to Portlaoise and then on to Mountmellick.It was originally planned that the line would go on to connect Mountmellick to Geashill and with possibility for another line from Geashill to Mullingar but these were never built leaving Mountmellick as a dead end.Mountmellick being a dead end lead to its closure the Portlaoise to Abbeyleix to Kilkenny city line closed as it was not as popular as the Carlow to Kilkenny line.

==Road transport==
The M7 road runs through County Laois. This is one of the busiest roadways in Ireland connecting Dublin and Limerick and acts as part of the route for the M8 which connects Cork to Dublin. The M8 joins the M7 to the south of Portlaoise. Road infrastructure has improved greatly in the county over the past decade. Most major interurban routes through Laois have now been upgraded to motorway standards. All major traffic bottlenecks in Laois such as Abbeyleix and Mountrath have been bypassed following the opening of the M7/M8 tolled motorway project in May 2010. Both towns were major intercity bottlenecks for motorists, especially Abbeyleix where delays of up to 30 minutes or more were common.

Bus Éireann provides regular intercity bus services in the county. The Dublin to Limerick service runs every hour through towns and villages on the old N7 road (now R445) while the Dublin to Cork intercity bus service runs every two hours through towns in the county.

As of 2022, Laois hurlers compete in the Liam MacCarthy Cup, a competition reserved for the premiere hurling counties while the footballers compete in the Sam Maguire Cup.

<doc id="143085" wikidata="Q2613149" url="?curid=143085" title="Adrien Baillet">
<text>Adrien Baillet (13 June 164921 January 1706) was a French scholar and critic. He is now best known as a biographer of René Descartes.

==Life==

He was born in the village of Neuville near Beauvais, in Picardy. His parents could only afford to send him to a small school in the village, but he picked up some Latin from the friars of a neighbouring convent, who brought him under the notice of the bishop of Beauvais. By his kindness Baillet received a thorough education at the theological seminary, and was afterwards appointed to a post as teacher in the college of Beauvais. In 1676 he was ordained priest and was presented to a small vicarage.

He accepted in 1680 the appointment of librarian to François-Chrétien de Lamoignon, advocate-general to the parlement of Paris. He made a &quot;catalogue raisonné&quot; (in 35 vols.) of its library, all written with his own hand.

The remainder of his life was spent in incessant, unremitting labour; so keen was his devotion to study that he allowed himself only five hours a day for rest.

With regard to René Descartes, he is popularly said to have recorded in his biography the three dreams leading up to the Cartesian Cogito.

==Works==

Of his numerous works the following are the most conspicuous:

#&quot;Histoire de Hollande depuis la trève de ióop Jusqu’d 1690&quot; (4 vols. 1693), a continuation of Grotius, and published under the name of La Neuville
#&quot;Les Vies des saints&quot; (4 vols. 1701)
#&quot;Des Satires personnelles&quot;, &quot;traité historique et critique de celles qui portent le litre d’Anti&quot; (2 vols. 1689)
#&quot;La vie de monsieur Descartes&quot; (2 vols. 1691; modern edition in one volume: &quot;La vie de monsieur Descartes&quot;, Paris: Éditions des Malassis, 2012)
#&quot;La vie de mr. Des-Cartes. Réduite en abregé&quot; (1692; modern edition: &quot;Vie de Monsieur Descartes&quot;, Paris, La Table Ronde, 1992)
#&quot;Auteurs déguisés sous des noms étrangers, empruntes, &amp;c.&quot; (1690)
#&quot;Jugemens des savans sur les principaux ouvrages des auteurs&quot; (9 vols. 1685—1686).

The last is the most celebrated and useful of all his works. At the time of his death he was engaged on a &quot;Dictionnaire universelle ecclésiastique&quot;. The praise bestowed on the Jansenists in the &quot;Jugemens des savans&quot; brought down on Baillet the hatred of the Jesuits, and his &quot;Vie des saints&quot;, in which he brought his critical mind to bear on the question of miracles, caused some scandal. His &quot;Vie de Descartes&quot; is a mine of information on the philosopher and his work, derived from numerous unimpeachable authorities.

<doc id="143087" wikidata="Q2636724" url="?curid=143087" title="Alamo Mission">
<text>The Alamo is a historic Spanish mission and fortress compound founded in the 18th century by Roman Catholic missionaries in what is now San Antonio, Texas, United States. It was the site of the Battle of the Alamo in 1836, a pivotal event of the Texas Revolution in which American folk heroes James Bowie and Davy Crockett were killed. Today it is a museum in the Alamo Plaza Historic District and a part of the San Antonio Missions World Heritage Site.

Originally named the Misión San Antonio de Valero, it was one of the early Spanish missions in Texas, built to convert American tribes to Christianity. The mission was secularized in 1793 and then abandoned. Ten years later, it became a fortress housing the Second Flying Company of San Carlos de Parras military unit, who likely gave the mission the name Alamo (&quot;cottonwood trees&quot;). During the Texas Revolution, Mexican General Martín Perfecto de Cos surrendered the fort to the Texian Army in December 1835, following the Siege of Béxar. A relatively small number of Texian soldiers then occupied the compound for several months. The defenders were wiped out at the Battle of the Alamo on March 6, 1836. As the Mexican Army retreated from Texas several months later, they tore down many of the Alamo walls and burned some of the buildings.

For the next five years, the Alamo was periodically used to garrison soldiers, both Texian and Mexican, but was ultimately abandoned. In 1849, several years after Texas was annexed to the United States, the U.S. Army began renting the facility for use as a quartermaster&#x27;s depot, before again abandoning the mission in 1876 after nearby Fort Sam Houston was established. The Alamo chapel was sold to the state of Texas, which conducted occasional tours but made no effort to restore it. The remaining buildings were sold to a mercantile company that operated them as a wholesale grocery store.

The Daughters of the Republic of Texas (DRT) formed in 1891 and began trying to preserve the Alamo. Adina Emilia De Zavala and Clara Driscoll successfully convinced the state legislature in 1905 to purchase the remaining buildings and to name the DRT as the permanent custodian of the site. Over the next century, periodic attempts were made to transfer control of the Alamo from the DRT. In early 2015, Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush officially moved control of the Alamo to the Texas General Land Office. The Alamo and the four missions in the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site on July 5, 2015.

==History==

===As a mission===

In 1716, the Spanish government established several Roman Catholic missions in East Texas. The isolation of the missions—the nearest Spanish settlement, San Juan Bautista, Coahuila was over away—made it difficult to keep them adequately provisioned. To assist the missionaries, the new governor of Spanish Texas, Martín de Alarcón, wished to establish a waystation between the settlements along the Rio Grande and the new missions in East Texas.

In April 1718, Alarcón led an expedition to found a new community in Texas. The group erected a temporary mud, brush, and straw structure near the headwaters of the San Antonio River. This building would serve as a new mission, San Antonio de Valero, named after Saint Anthony of Padua and the viceroy of New Spain, the Marquess of Valero. Alarcón, acting in his capacity as &quot;General of the Provinces of the Kingdom of the New Philippines,&quot; formally entrusted the mission on May 1 to Father Antonio de San Buenaventura y Olivares in a foundation document, still preserved. The mission was located near a community of Coahuiltecans and was initially populated by three to five Indian converts from Mission San Francisco Solano near San Juan Bautista. One mile (two km) north of the mission, Alarcón built a fort, the Presidio San Antonio de Béxar. Close by, he founded the first civilian community in Texas, San Antonio de Béxar, which later developed into the present-day city of San Antonio, Texas.

Within a year, the mission moved to the western bank of the river, where it was less likely to flood. Over the next several years, a chain of missions was established nearby. In 1724, after remnants of a Gulf Coast hurricane destroyed the existing structures at Misión San Antonio de Valero, the mission was moved to its current location. At the time, the new location was just across the San Antonio River from the town of San Antonio de Béxar and just north of a group of huts known as La Villita.

Over the next several decades, the mission complex expanded to cover . The first permanent building was likely the two-story, L-shaped stone residence for the priests. The building served as parts of the west and south edges of an inner courtyard. A series of adobe barracks buildings were constructed to house the mission Indians and a textile workshop was erected. By 1744, over 300 Indian converts resided at San Antonio de Valero. The mission was largely self-sufficient, relying on its 2,000 head of cattle and 1,300 sheep for food and clothing. Each year, the mission&#x27;s farmland produced up to 2,000 bushels of corn and 100 bushels of beans; cotton was also grown.

The first stones were laid for a more permanent church building in 1744, however, the church, its tower, and the sacristy collapsed in the late 1750s. Reconstruction began in 1758, with the new chapel located at the south end of the inner courtyard. Constructed of thick limestone blocks, it was intended to be three stories high and topped by a dome, with bell towers on either side. Its shape was a traditional cross, with a long nave and short transepts. Although the first two levels were completed, the bell towers and third story were never begun. While four stone arches were erected to support the planned dome, the dome itself was never built. As the church was never completed, it is unlikely that it was ever used for religious services.

The chapel was intended to be highly decorated. Niches were carved on either side of the door to hold statues. The lower-level niches displayed Saint Francis and Saint Dominic, while the second-level niches contained statues of Saint Clare and Saint Margaret of Cortona. Carvings were also completed around the chapel&#x27;s door.
Up to 30 adobe or mud buildings were constructed to serve as workrooms, storerooms, and homes for the Indian residents. As the nearby presidio was perpetually understaffed, the mission was built to withstand attacks by Apache and Comanche raiders. In 1745, 100 mission Indians successfully drove off a band of 300 Apaches which had surrounded the presidio. Their actions saved the presidio, the mission, and likely the town from destruction. Walls were erected around the Indian homes in 1758, likely in response to a massacre at the Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá. The convent and church were not fully enclosed within the high walls. The walls were built thick and enclosed an area long (north-south) and wide (east-west). For additional protection, a turret housing three cannon was added near the main gate in 1762. By 1793, an additional one-pounder cannon had been placed on a rampart near the convent.

The population of Indians fluctuated from a high of 328 in 1756 to a low of 44 in 1777. The new commandant general of the interior provinces, Teodoro de Croix, thought the missions were a liability and began taking actions to decrease their influence. In 1778, he ruled that all unbranded cattle belonged to the government. Raiding Apache tribes had stolen most of the mission&#x27;s horses, making it difficult to round up and brand the cattle. As a result, when the ruling took effect, the mission lost a great deal of its wealth and was unable to support a larger population of converts. By 1793, only 12 Indians remained. By this point, few of the hunting and gathering tribes in Texas had not been Christianized. In 1793, Misión San Antonio de Valero was secularized.

Shortly after, the mission was abandoned. Most locals were uninterested in the buildings. Visitors were often more impressed. In 1828, French naturalist Jean Louis Berlandier visited the area. He mentioned the Alamo complex: &quot;An enormous battlement and some barracks are found there, as well as the ruins of a church which could pass for one of the loveliest monuments of the area, even if its architecture is overloaded with ornamentation like all the ecclesiastical buildings of the Spanish colonies.&quot;

===Military===

In the 19th century, the mission complex became known as &quot;the Alamo&quot;. The name may have been derived from a grove of nearby cottonwood trees, known in Spanish as &quot;álamo&quot;. Alternatively, in 1803, the abandoned compound was occupied by the Second Flying Company of San Carlos de Parras, from Álamo de Parras in Coahuila. Locals often called them simply the &quot;Alamo Company&quot;.

During the Mexican War of Independence, parts of the mission frequently served as a political prison. Between 1806 and 1812 it served as San Antonio&#x27;s first hospital. Spanish records indicate that some renovations were made for this purpose, but no details were provided.

The buildings were transferred from Spanish to Mexican control in 1821 after Mexico gained its independence. Soldiers continued to garrison the complex until December 1835, when General Martín Perfecto de Cos surrendered to Texian forces following a two-month siege of San Antonio de Béxar during the Texas Revolution. In the few months that Cos supervised the troops garrisoned in San Antonio, he had ordered many improvements to the Alamo. Cos&#x27;s men likely demolished the four stone arches that were to support a future chapel dome. The debris from these was used to build a ramp to the apse of the chapel building. There, the Mexican soldiers placed three cannon, which could fire over the walls of the roofless building. To close a gap between the church and the barracks (formerly the convent building) and the south wall, the soldiers built a palisade. When Cos retreated, he left behind 19 cannons, including a 16-pounder.

====Battle of the Alamo====

With Cos&#x27;s departure, there was no longer an organized garrison of Mexican troops in Texas, and many Texians believed the war was over. Colonel James C. Neill assumed command of the 100 soldiers who remained. Neill requested that an additional 200 men be sent to fortify the Alamo, and expressed fear that his garrison could be starved out of the Alamo after a four-day siege. However, the Texian government was in turmoil and unable to provide much assistance. Determined to make the best of the situation, Neill and engineer Green B. Jameson began working to fortify the Alamo. Jameson installed the cannons that Cos had left along the walls.

Heeding Neill&#x27;s warnings, General Sam Houston ordered Colonel James Bowie to take 35–50 men to Béxar to help Neill move all of the artillery and destroy the fortress. There were not enough oxen to move the artillery to a safer place, and most of the men believed the complex was of strategic importance to protecting the settlements to the east. On January 26, the Texian soldiers passed a resolution in favor of holding the Alamo. On February 11, Neill went on furlough to pursue additional reinforcements and supplies for the garrison. William Travis and James Bowie agreed to share command of the Alamo.
On February 23, the Mexican Army, under the command of President-General Antonio López de Santa Anna, arrived in San Antonio de Béxar intent on recapturing the city. For the next thirteen days, the Mexican Army laid siege to the Alamo, during which work continued on its interior. After Mexican soldiers tried to block the irrigation ditch leading into the fort, Jameson supervised the digging of a well at the south end of the plaza. Although the men hit the water, they weakened an earth and timber parapet near the barracks, collapsing it and leaving no way to fire safely over that wall.
The siege ended in a fierce battle on March 6. As the Mexican Army overran the walls, most of the Texians fell back to the long barracks (convent) and the chapel. During the siege, Texians had carved holes in many of the walls of these rooms so that they would be able to fire. Each room had only one door which led into the courtyard and which had been &quot;buttressed by semicircular parapets of dirt secured with cowhides&quot;. Some of the rooms even had trenches dug into the floor to provide some cover for the defenders. Mexican soldiers used the abandoned Texian cannon to blow off the doors of the rooms, allowing Mexican soldiers to enter and defeat the Texians.

The last of the Texians to die were the eleven men manning the two cannon in the chapel. The entrance to the church had been barricaded with sandbags, which the Texians were able to fire over. A shot from the cannon destroyed the barricades, and Mexican soldiers entered the building after firing an initial musket volley. With no time to reload, the Texians, including Dickinson, Gregorio Esparza, and Bonham, grabbed rifles and fired before being bayoneted to death. Texian Robert Evans was master of ordnance and had been tasked with keeping the gunpowder from falling into Mexican hands. Wounded, he crawled towards the powder magazine but was killed by a musket ball with his torch only inches from the powder. If he had succeeded, the blast would have destroyed the church.

Santa Anna ordered that the Texian bodies be stacked and burned. All, or almost all, of the Texian defenders were killed in the battle, although some historians believe that at least one Texian, Henry Warnell, successfully escaped. Warnell died several months later of wounds incurred either during the final battle or during his escape. Most Alamo historians agree that 400–600 Mexicans were killed or wounded. This would represent about one-third of the Mexican soldiers involved in the final assault, which historian Terry Todish stated was &quot;a tremendous casualty rate by any standards&quot;.

====Further military use====

Following the battle of the Alamo, one thousand Mexican soldiers, under General Juan Andrade, remained at the mission. For the next two months, they repaired and fortified the complex, however, no records remain of what improvements they made to the structure. After the Mexican army&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of San Jacinto and the capture of Santa Anna, the Mexican army agreed to leave Texas, effectively ending the Texas Revolution. As Andrade and his garrison joined the retreat on May 24, they spiked the cannons, tore down many of the Alamo walls, and set fires throughout the complex. Only a few buildings survived their efforts; the chapel was left in ruins, most of the Long Barracks was still standing, and the building that had contained the south wall gate and several rooms were mostly intact.

The Texians briefly used the Alamo as a fortress in December 1836 and again in January 1839. The Mexican army regained control in March 1841 and September 1842 as they briefly took San Antonio de Bexar. According to historians Roberts and Olson, &quot;both groups carved names in the Alamo&#x27;s walls, dug musket rounds out of the holds, and knocked off stone carvings&quot;. Pieces of the debris were sold to tourists, and in 1840 the San Antonio town council passed a resolution allowing local citizens to take stone from the Alamo at a cost of $5 per wagonload. By the late 1840s, even the four statues located on the front wall of the chapel had been removed.

On January 13, 1841, the Republic of Texas legislature passed an act returning the sanctuary of the Alamo to the Roman Catholic Church. By 1845, when Texas was annexed to the United States, a colony of bats occupied the abandoned complex and weeds and grass covered many of the walls.

As the Mexican–American War loomed in 1846, 2000 United States Army soldiers were sent to San Antonio under Brigadier General John Wool. By the end of the year, they had appropriated part of the Alamo complex for the Quartermaster&#x27;s Department. Within eighteen months, the convent building had been restored to serve as offices and storerooms. The chapel remained vacant, however, as the army, the Roman Catholic Church, and the city of San Antonio bickered over its ownership. An 1855 decision by the Texas Supreme Court reaffirmed that the Catholic Church was the rightful owner of the chapel. While litigation was ongoing, the army rented the chapel from the Catholic Church for $150 per month.

Under the army&#x27;s oversight, the Alamo was greatly repaired. Soldiers cleared the grounds and rebuilt the old convent and the mission walls, primarily from the original stone which was strewn along the ground. During the renovations, a new wooden roof was added to the chapel and the campanulate, or bell-shaped facade, was added to the front wall of the chapel. At the time, reports suggested that the soldiers found several skeletons while clearing the rubble from the chapel floor. The new chapel roof was destroyed in a fire in 1861. The army also cut additional windows into the chapel, adding two on the upper level of the facade as well as additional windows on the other three sides of the building. The complex eventually contained a supply depot, offices, storage facilities, a blacksmith shop, and stables.

During the American Civil War, Texas joined the Confederacy, and the Alamo complex was taken over by the Confederate Army. In February 1861, the Texan Militia, under direction from the Texas Secession Convention and led by Ben McCullough and Sam Maverick, confronted General Twiggs, commander of all US Forces in Texas and headquartered at the Alamo. Twiggs elected to surrender and all supplies were turned over to the Texans. Following the Confederacy&#x27;s defeat, the United States Army again maintained control over the Alamo. Shortly after the war ended, however, the Catholic Church requested that the army vacate the premises so that the Alamo could become a place of worship for local German Catholics. The army refused, and the church made no further attempts at retaking the complex.

===Mercantile===

They abandoned the Alamo in 1876 when Fort Sam Houston was established in San Antonio. About that time, the Church sold the convent to Honore Grenet, who added a new two-story wood building to the complex. Grenet used the convent and the new building for a wholesale grocery business. After Grenet&#x27;s death in 1882, his business was purchased by the mercantile firm, Hugo &amp; Schmeltzer, which continued to operate the store.

San Antonio&#x27;s first rail service began in 1877, and the city&#x27;s tourism industry began to grow. The city heavily advertised the Alamo, using photographs and drawings that showed only the chapel, not the surrounding city. Many of the visitors were disappointed with their visit; in 1877 tourist Harrier P. Spofford wrote that the chapel was &quot;a reproach to all San Antonio. Its wall is overthrown and removed, its dormitories are piled with military stores, its battle-scarred front has been revamped and repainted and market carts roll to and fro on the spot where flames ascended ... over the funeral pyre of heroes&quot;.

===Ownership transfer===
In 1883, the Catholic Church sold the chapel to the State of Texas for $20,000. The state hired Tom Rife to manage the building. He gave tours but did not make any efforts to restore the chapel, to the annoyance of many. In the past decades, soldiers and members of the local Masonic lodge, which had used the building for meetings, had inscribed various graffiti on the walls and statues. In May 1887 a devout Catholic who was incensed that Masonic emblems had been inscribed on a statue of Saint Teresa was arrested after breaking into the building and smashing statues with a sledgehammer.

The 50th anniversary of the fall of the Alamo received little attention. In an editorial after the fact, the &quot;San Antonio Express&quot; called for the formation of a new society that would help recognize important historical events. The Daughters of the Republic of Texas (DRT) organized in 1892 with one of their main goals being to preserve the Alamo. Among its early members was Adina Emilia De Zavala, granddaughter of the Republic of Texas Vice-president Lorenzo de Zavala. Shortly before the turn of the 20th century, Adina de Zavala convinced Gustav Schmeltzer, owner of the convent, to give the DRT first option in purchasing the building if it was ever sold. In 1903, when Schmeltzer wanted to sell the building to a developer, he offered the building first to the DRT for $75,000, which they did not have. During De Zavala&#x27;s attempts to raise the money, she met Clara Driscoll, an heiress who was very interested in Texas history, especially the Alamo.

Shortly thereafter, Driscoll joined the DRT and was appointed chair of the San Antonio chapter&#x27;s fund-raising committee. The DRT negotiated a 30-day option on the property, wherein the group would pay $500 up front, with $4,500 due at the conclusion of the 30 days, with an additional $20,000 due on February 10, 1904, and the remainder paid in five annual installments of $10,000. Driscoll paid the initial $500 deposit out of her personal funds, and when fundraising efforts fell far short (only raising slightly over $1,000 of the needed $4,500), Driscoll paid the balance of the $4,500 from her own pocket.

At the urging of both Driscoll and de Zavala, the Texas Legislature approved $5,000 for the committee to use as part of the next payment. The appropriation was vetoed by Governor S. W. T. Lanham, who said it was &quot;not a justifiable expenditure of the taxpayers&#x27; money&quot;. DRT members set up a collection booth outside the Alamo and held several fundraising activities, collecting $5,662.23. Driscoll agreed to make up the difference, as well as agreeing to pay the final $50,000. After hearing of her generosity, various newspapers in Texas dubbed her the &quot;Savior of the Alamo&quot;. Many groups began to petition the legislature to reimburse Driscoll. In January 1905, de Zavala drafted a bill that was sponsored by representative Samuel Ealy Johnson Jr. (father of future US President Lyndon Baines Johnson), to reimburse Driscoll and name the DRT custodian of the Alamo. The bill passed, and Driscoll received all of her money back.

Driscoll and de Zavala argued over how best to preserve the building. De Zavala wished to restore the exterior of the buildings to a state similar to its 1836 appearance, focusing on the convent (then called the long barracks), while Driscoll wanted to tear down the long barracks and create a monument similar to those she had seen in Europe: &quot;a city center opened by a large plaza and anchored by an ancient chapel&quot;.

Unable to reach an agreement, Driscoll and several other women formed a competing chapter of the DRT named the Alamo Mission chapter. The two chapters argued over which had oversight of the Alamo. Unable to resolve the dispute, in February 1908 the executive committee of the DRT leased out the building. Angry with that decision, de Zavala announced that a syndicate wanted to buy the chapel and tear it down. She then barricaded herself in the Hugo and Schmeltzer building for three days.

In response to de Zavala&#x27;s actions, on February 12, Governor Thomas Mitchell Campbell ordered that the superintendent of public buildings and grounds take control of the property. Eventually, a judge named Driscoll&#x27;s chapter the official custodians of the Alamo. The DRT later expelled de Zavala and her followers.

===Restoration===

Driscoll offered to donate the money required to tear down the convent, build a stone wall around the Alamo complex, and convert the interior into a park. The legislature postponed a decision until after the 1910 elections after which Texas had a new governor, Oscar Branch Colquitt. Both de Zavala and Driscoll spoke, and Colquitt toured the property; three months later, Colquitt removed the DRT as official custodians of the Alamo, citing that they had done nothing to restore the property since gaining control. He also announced an intent to rebuild the convent. Shortly thereafter, the legislature paid to demolish the building that had been added by Hugo and Schmeltzer and authorized $5,000 to restore the rest of the complex. The restorations were begun, but not finished, as the appropriations fell short of the costs.

Driscoll, upset over Colquitt&#x27;s decisions, used her influence as a major donor to the Democratic Party to undermine him. At the time, Colquitt was considered running for U.S. Senate. She told the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; that &quot;the Daughters desire to have a Spanish garden on the site of the old mission, but the governor will not consider it. Therefore, we are going to fight him from the stump. ... We are also going to make speeches in the districts of State Senators who voted against and killed the amendment&quot; to return control of the mission to the DRT. Subsequently, while Colquitt was out of state on a business trip, Lieutenant Governor William Harding Mayes allowed the removal of the upper-story walls of the long barracks from the convent, leaving only the one-story walls of the west and south portions of the building. This conflict became known as the Second Battle of the Alamo. Upon their deaths in 1945 and 1955, Driscoll and de Zavala, respectively, had their bodies laid in state in the Alamo Chapel.

In 1931, Driscoll persuaded the state legislature to purchase two tracts of land between the chapel and Crockett street. In 1935, she convinced the city of San Antonio not to place a fire station in a building near the Alamo; the DRT later purchased that building and made it the DRT Library. During the Great Depression, money from the Works Progress Administration and the National Youth Administration was used to construct a wall around the Alamo and a museum, and to raze several non-historic buildings on the Alamo property.

The Alamo was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 19, 1960, and was documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1961. It was an inaugural listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966 and is a contributing property to the Alamo Plaza Historic District, which was designated in 1977. As San Antonio prepared to host the Hemisfair in 1968, the long barracks were roofed and turned into a museum. Few structural changes have taken place since then.

According to Herbert Malloy Mason&#x27;s &quot;Spanish Missions of Texas&quot;, the Alamo is one of &quot;the finest examples of Spanish ecclesiastical building on the North American continent&quot;. The mission, along with others located in San Antonio, is at risk from environmental factors, however. The limestone used to construct the buildings was taken from the banks of the San Antonio River. It expands when confronted with moisture and then contracts when temperatures drop, shedding small pieces of limestone with each cycle. Measures have been taken to partially combat the problem.

===Ownership dispute===

In 1988, a theater near the Alamo unveiled a new movie, &quot;Alamo ... the Price of Freedom&quot;. The 40-minute-long film would be screened several times each day. The movie attracted many protests from Mexican-American activists, who decried the anti-Mexican comments and complained that it ignored Tejano contributions to the battle. The movie was re-edited in response to the complaints, but the controversy grew to the point that many activists began pressuring the legislature to move control of the Alamo to the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC). In response to pressure from Hispanic groups, state representative Orlando Garcia of San Antonio began legislative hearings into DRT finances. The DRT agreed to make their financial records more open, and the hearings were canceled.

Shortly after that, San Antonio representative Jerry Beauchamp proposed that the Alamo be transferred from the DRT to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. Many minority legislators agreed with him. However, the San Antonio mayor, Henry Cisneros, advocated that control remain with the DRT, and the legislature shelved the bill.

Several years later, Carlos Guerra, a reporter for the &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot;, began writing columns attacking the DRT for its handling of the Alamo. Guerra claimed that the DRT had kept the temperature too low within the chapel, a situation which caused the formation of water vapor, which when mixed with automobile exhaust fumes damaged the limestone walls. These allegations prompted the legislature in 1993 to once more attempt to transfer control of the Alamo to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. At the same time, State Senator Gregory Luna filed a competing bill to transfer oversight of the Alamo to the Texas Historical Commission.

By the following year, some advocacy groups in San Antonio had begun pressing for the mission to be turned into a larger historical park. They wished to restore the chapel to its 18th-century appearance and focus public interpretation of the site on its mission days rather than the activities of the Texas Revolution. The DRT was outraged. The head of the group&#x27;s Alamo Committee, Ana Hartman, claimed that the dispute was gender-based. According to her, &quot;There&#x27;s something macho about it. Some of the men who are attacking us just resent what has been a successful female venture since 1905.&quot;

The dispute was mostly resolved in 1994, when then-Governor George W. Bush vowed to veto any legislation that would displace the DRT as caretakers of the Alamo. Later that year, the DRT erected a marker on the mission grounds recognizing that they had once served as Indian burial grounds.

In 2010, the office of the Texas Attorney General received a complaint that the DRT had been mismanaging not only the site, but the funds allocated for its management, and an investigation was begun. After two years, the Attorney General&#x27;s office concluded that the DRT had indeed mismanaged the Alamo, citing numerous instances of misconduct on the DRT&#x27;s part, including failing to properly maintain the Alamo in good order and repair, mismanagement of state funds, and breach of fiduciary duty.

During the course of the investigation, a state law was passed in 2011 and signed by governor Rick Perry to transfer custodianship of the Alamo from the DRT to the Texas General Land Office (GLO). The transfer was officially enacted in 2015. While the DRT initially objected to the Attorney General&#x27;s report, and even went so far as to file a lawsuit to prevent the transfer, the organization eventually vowed to work with the Texas GLO to preserve the Alamo for generations to come.

===Modern use===
As of 2002, the Alamo welcomed over four million visitors each year, making it one of the most popular historic sites in the United States. Visitors may tour the chapel, as well as the Long Barracks, which contains a small museum with paintings, weapons, and other artifacts from the era of the Texas Revolution. Additional artifacts are displayed in another complex building, alongside a large diorama that recreates the compound as it existed in 1836. A large mural, known as the Wall of History, portrays the history of the Alamo complex from its mission days to modern times.
The site has an annual operating budget of $6 million, primarily funded through sales in the gift store. Under the 2011 law, which placed the Alamo under the care of the General Land Office, Commissioner George P. Bush announced on March 12, 2015, that his office would take charge of the daily operations of the Alamo from the Daughters of the Republic of Texas.

Renewed resistance to the General Land Office&#x27;s master plan for the site, which envisions a quadrupling of the site to include a 100,000-square-foot museum, came from the recent consideration to move the Alamo Cenotaph to a different location. Other concerns expressed include the proposed $450 million cost of the project and any efforts to allow alterations or modifications to the story of the Alamo.

<text>Robert Baillie (30 April 16021662) was a Church of Scotland minister who became famous as an author and a propagandist for the Covenanters.

In Baillie&#x27;s engagement with the theological and liturgical controversies of the mid-Seventeenth Century, Baillie sought to reconcile his strong belief in maintaining Kirk unity with a firm adherence to a Christian doctrine dictated by the divine &#x27;truth&#x27; revealed in Scripture.

Two large volumes of Baillie&#x27;s sermons survive in manuscript. He was also conscientious in ensuring that copies were made of his outgoing correspondence and other documents with a view to creating a body of evidence which could be used to prepare a historical account of the Covenanters. This material remains a valuable source for historians of the period.

==Life==

Baillie was born in the Saltmarket, Glasgow, the eldest son of James Baillie, a merchant and burgess of Glasgow, and his wife, Helen Gibson. He was educated at the High School of Glasgow and the University of Glasgow, graduating with an M.A. in 1620. He was licensed by Archbishop James Law and became a regent of Philosophy in the University, and tutor to the son of Alexander Montgomery, 6th Earl of Eglinton. He was ordained to Kilwinning on 25 May 1631 and admitted burgess of Glasgow 6 July 1631. In 1638 he represented the Presbytery of Irvine at the Glasgow Assembly, when Presbyterianism was re-established in Scotland. In 1639 he accompanied Lord General Alexander Leslie and the Scottish army as chaplain to Lord Eglinton&#x27;s Regiment during the Bishops&#x27; Wars. In 1640 he was appointed by the Covenanters to draw up an accusation against Archbishop Laud. On 11 August 1642 he was translated to the Tron Kirk in Glasgow. In the same year, Baillie was made Professor of Divinity at the University of Glasgow, holding the chair jointly with David Dickson. In 1643 he was selected as one of the five Scottish clergymen who were sent to the Westminster Assembly. In January 1647 he presented the completed Confession of Faith and a version of the Psalms in metre to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.

In 1649, Baillie was one of the commissioners sent to Holland for the purpose of inviting Charles II to Scotland, and of settling the terms of his admission to the government. He continued to take an interest in religious controversies during the Interregnum, but was not active politically. In 1661 he was made Principal of the University of Glasgow in place of Patrick Gillespie. He died the following year, in August 1662.

==Liturgical controversies==

Baillie accepted the liturgical changes introduced by James VI&#x27;s Articles of Perth (1618), even elaborating an exhaustive defence of kneeling at communion in protracted correspondence with David Dickson, the minister for the parish of Irvine. However, he denounced William Laud&#x27;s &quot;Scottish Prayer Book&quot; (1637) as &quot;popish&quot; and &quot;idolatrous&quot;. His critical analysis of the intentions of its Canterburian authors is set out in his and &quot;Ladensium autakakrisis&quot; of 1641.

==Cromwellian invasion==

In the Resolutioner versus Protester schism in the Church of Scotland during the Cromwellian invasion of Scotland, Baillie sided with the Resolutioners. His ecclesiology saw the church as an &quot;ecclesia mixta&quot;, comprising both reprobate and elect. He rejected the Protestors&#x27; more exclusive vision of a church of visible saints in which membership (and by extension the ability to hold church office) should be restricted to godly &quot;true&quot; believers. Baillie&#x27;s concern was to maintain church unity and combat the threat posed by sectarians.

Of the Resolutioners, Robert Douglas was, by head and shoulders, the acknowledged leader. His ministerial supporters included David Dickson, Baillie, and James Wood. Among the Protesters the most outstanding ministers were James Guthrie, Samuel Rutherfurd, Andrew Cant, Patrick Gillespie, and John Livingstone; and, of the elders, Wariston and Sir John Cheisly; the two most strenuous fighters being Guthrie and Wariston.

Baillie&#x27;s mentor Robert Blair urged him to disengage from the Resolutioner – Protestor conflict and concentrate on his academic writing. Accordingly, during the 1650s Baillie immersed himself in his teaching at the University of Glasgow and writing treatises on Hebrew and biblical chronology.

==Restoration==

In correspondence with William Cunningham, 9th Earl of Glencairn, John Maitland, 2nd Earl of Lauderdale and James Sharp after the Restoration, Baillie made it clear that he thought the episcopal settlement Charles II imposed on Scotland was a mistake, but he did not oppose the return of bishops publicly. When, in 1662, he met Andrew Fairfoul, the recently consecrated Archbishop of Glasgow, he greeted him cordially, but made a point of not acknowledging his status.

==Works==
A complete memoir and a full notice of his writings can be found in David Laing&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie&quot; (1637–1662), Bannatyne Club, 3 vols. (Edinburgh, 1841–1842). Among his works are &quot;Ladensium αὐτοκατάκρισις&quot;, an answer to &quot;Lysimachus Nicanor&quot; by John Corbet in the form of an attack on Laud and his system, in reply to a publication which charged the Covenanters with Jesuitry; &quot;Anabaptism, the true Fountain of Independency, Brownisme, Antinomy, Familisme, etc.&quot;, a sermon [in which he criticises the rise of the early Baptist churches in England such as those led by Thomas Lambe]; &quot;An Historical Vindication of the Government of the Church of Scotland&quot;; &quot;The Life of William (Laud) now Lord Archbishop of Canterbury Examined&quot; (London, 1643); &quot;A Parallel of the Liturgy with the Mass Book, the Breviary, the Ceremonial and other Romish Rituals&quot; (London, 1661).

<text>Robert Baillie (known as Baillie of Jerviswood; 24 December 1684) was a Scottish conspirator incriminated in the Rye House Plot against King Charles II. He was executed for treason.

Baillie was the son of George Baillie of St John&#x27;s Kirk, Lanarkshire, who had bought the estate of Jerviswood in 1636 and of Mellerstain in 1643, under Charles I. He incurred the resentment of the Scottish government by rescuing, in June 1676, his brother-in-law James Kirkton, a Presbyterian Church of Scotland minister who had been seized and confined in a house by Carstairs, an informer. He was fined £500, remaining in prison for four months and then being liberated on paying half the fine to Carstairs. In despair at the state of his country, he determined in 1683 to emigrate to South Carolina, but the plan came to nothing.

The same year, Baillie, with some of his friends, went to London and entered into communication with the Duke of Monmouth, Lord Russell, and their party to conspire to bring Monmouth to the throne; and on the discovery of the Rye House Plot, Baillie was arrested. Questioned by King Charles, Baillie denied any knowledge of the conspiracy, but would not deny that he had been consulted with the view of an insurrection in Scotland. He was subsequently put in irons and sent back a prisoner to Scotland. Although no evidence has come to light to support his connection with the plot, he was fined £6,000 and kept in close confinement.

On 23 December 1684, he was brought up again before the High Court on the charge of treason. He was pronounced guilty the next day and hanged the same afternoon at the Mercat Cross at Edinburgh.

Bishop Burnet, who was his cousin, describes him as &quot;in the presbyterian principles but ... a man of great piety and virtue, learned in the law, in mathematics and in languages.&quot; He married a sister of Lord Warriston, and left a son, George, who took refuge in Holland, afterwards returning with William III and being restored to his estates before marrying Lady Grizel Hume.

<text>Jean Sylvain Bailly (; 15 September 1736 – 12 November 1793) was a French astronomer, mathematician, freemason, and political leader of the early part of the French Revolution. He presided over the Tennis Court Oath, served as the mayor of Paris from 1789 to 1791, and was ultimately guillotined during the Reign of Terror.

==Scientific career==
Born in Paris, Bailly was the son of Jacques Bailly, an artist and supervisor of the Louvre, and the grandson of Nicholas Bailly, also an artist and court painter. As a child he originally intended to follow in his family&#x27;s footsteps and pursue a career in the arts. He became deeply attracted to science, however, particularly astronomy, by the influence of Nicolas de Lacaille. An excellent student with a &quot;particularly retentive memory and inexhaustible patience&quot;, he calculated an orbit for the next appearance of Halley&#x27;s Comet (in 1759), and correctly reduced Lacaille&#x27;s observations of 515 stars. He participated in the construction of an observatory at the Louvre. These achievements along with others got him elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 1763. In the years prior to the French Revolution, Bailly&#x27;s distinctive reputation as a French astronomer led to his recognition and admiration by the European scientific community. Due to his popularity amongst the scientific groups, in 1777, Bailly received Benjamin Franklin as a guest in his house in Chaillot.

===Scientific and other writing===
Bailly published his &quot;Essay on The Theory of the Satellites of Jupiter&quot; in 1766. The essay was an expansion of a presentation he had made to the academy in 1763. He later released the noteworthy dissertation O&quot;n the Inequalities of Light of the Satellites of Jupiter&quot; in 1771. In 1778, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Bailly gained a high literary reputation thanks to his &quot;Eulogies&quot; for King Charles V of France, Lacaille, Molière, Pierre Corneille and Gottfried Leibniz, which were issued in collected form in 1770 and 1790. He was admitted to the Académie française on 26 February 1784 and to the Académie des Inscriptions in 1785. From then on, Bailly devoted himself to the history of science. He published &quot;A History of Ancient Astronomy&quot; in 1775, followed by &quot;A History of Modern Astronomy&quot; (3 vols., 1782). Other works include &quot;Discourse on the Origin of the Sciences and the Peoples of Asia&quot; (1777), &quot;Discourse on Plato&#x27;s &#x27;Atlantide&#x27;&quot; (1779), and &quot;A Treatise on Indian and Oriental Astronomy&quot; (1787). Though his works were &quot;universally admired&quot; by contemporaries, later commentators have remarked that &quot;their erudition was... marred by speculative extravagances.&quot;

==During the French Revolution==

In a short period of time, Bailly made his way up the judicial ranks. From being the deputy of Paris, he was elected Estates-General on 20 May 1789. Soon after he was elected inaugural president of the National Assembly (3 June 1789) and led the famous proceedings in the Tennis Court on 20 June, being the first to take the Tennis Court Oath. In the National Assembly (French Revolution) Bailly was one of the deputies who secured the passage of a decree that declared Jews to be French citizens on 17 September 1791. He was met with threats and ridicule for this action. This decree repealed the special taxes that had been imposed on the Jews, as well as all the ordinances existing against them.

Bailly was a member of the &quot;Club de 1789&quot;, one of the best-known societies at the time. Though calls on his time from his mayoral duties restricted his involvement in the group, by May 1790, Bailly had risen to presiding officer of the club. In 1791, Jean Sylvain Bailly joined the Jacobin Club, but took no active role in it.

Shortly after the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, he became the first mayor of Paris under the newly adopted system of the &quot;Commune.&quot;


==Mayor of Paris==
On 15 July 1789, Bailly took office as the mayor of Paris. Two days later he was met by Louis XVI at the Hôtel de Ville who was there to endorse the Revolution. Bailly presented him with the new symbol of the revolution: the cockade of France.

In his function as mayor, he was attacked by Camille Desmoulins and Jean-Paul Marat as too conservative. Bailly continuously sought to promote the authority of the mayor while limiting the power of the General Assembly of the Commune.

=== Maintaining order ===
Jean Sylvain Bailly sought to be in full control of his administration as the mayor of Paris. He envisioned being in a position where all answered to him, and only his orders were to be followed. Creating a centralized government within Paris was his plan, however Parisians were not keen with this vision. His views are depicted in the following passage of his &quot;Mémoires:&quot;

&quot;... in the executive assembly, the mayor who presides over it is a specific officer of the commune. This Assembly possesses the totality of power, but its chief is its agent, its executive authority, who should be charged with the execution of its orders and the maintenance of its regulations. Moreover, since he is at the head of the administration, he understands all of its branches and has all of its strings in his hands. He is in a better position to detect the difficulties and the dangers than the other members who do not have the same information. If the law does not demand it, reason dictates that no important step be taken and no important questions be decided in his absence, unless he be allowed at least to make observations...&quot;

=== Food crisis ===
During the early years of the French Revolution, Paris was going through a major food shortage. Bailly&#x27;s actions to circumvent the situation were of great importance in keeping the revolution alive. Bailly had deputies gather grain that was being hoarded, made the sale of wheat mandatory by farmers, and helped the bakers by making them first in line in the village markets. Convoys that transported grain obtained by deputies were often attacked. To deter these attacks, Bailly signed a decree imposing a fine of five hundred livres on anyone found obstructing such convoys. Not only did the mayor control the supply of grain in the city, but he also imported grain from Africa to increase the city&#x27;s reserve. A provisional regime was established in October, 1789, in order to stabilize the administration of the government. Doing so led to order being established within the different jurisdictions, allowing The Communal Assembly, with the help of Bailly, to gain control of the food crisis. By February, 1790, the situation in Paris had improved.

=== National Guard ===
The National Guard, formed during the revolution by The Communal Assembly, was weak and underfunded. Lafayette, chief of the militia, could only do so much to strengthen this newly formed military. It took persuading to get funding from the Assembly to cover the cost and wages brought on by the troops. Bailly saw the importance of having a military that was well-equipped. In the fall of 1789, Bailly was able to acquire ammunition for the troops. In October 1789, Bailly was involved in the establishment of the National Guard department, whose purpose was to arm the military. The mayor not only played a role in strengthening the National Guard, but also issued orders to Lafayette when trying to maintain civility within the city. Bailly&#x27;s use of troops was to secure the prisons, certify the &quot;droits d&#x27;entrée&quot; would be collected, and to ensure that beggars would not congregate in the city.

=== Church property ===
In an unsuccessful attempt at financial reconstruction, the National Assembly had taken control of church property, making it available to buyers through the issue of non-negotiable bonds known as &quot;assignats&quot;. Bailly, along with the Municipal Bureau, then came up with a proposition on 10 March 1790, asking the government to give the city of Paris 200,000,000 livres worth of church land for it to sell to private investors in a period of three years. For their work in selling the land, Bailly and his administration would retain 50,000,000 livres. The National Assembly agreed to this deal. On 2 August 1790, Bailly was reelected as mayor. He allowed investors to begin the purchasing of church property. Before a year had passed, 28,000,000 livres worth of land had already been sold. Bailly&#x27;s proposal proved successful in generating revenue for Paris and the French state.

===Fall from favour===
After a failed attempt by the royal family to flee the country, Bailly tried to contain the growing republican crowds asking for the King to step down. On the morning of 17 July 1791, tensions were rising as suspicion of treason grew. Citizens suspected of criticising the government or National Guard were being interrogated and detained. Bailly soon heard of a gathering at the Champ de Mars, where citizens were meeting to sign petitions calling for the overthrow of the King. Imposing martial law, he ordered the National Guard to disperse the large riotous assembly that had gathered. A violent response ensued and many people died, for which Bailly, along with Lafayette, was considered responsible. What was to become known as the Champ de Mars Massacre was taken by the revolutionaries as an exemplar for oppression by the government. Having thereby become extremely unpopular, Bailly resigned on 12 November and was replaced four days later by Jerôme Pétion. Bailly moved to Nantes, where he composed his &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;un Témoin&quot; (published in 3 volumes by MM. Berville and Barrière, 1821–1822), an incomplete narrative of the extraordinary events of his public life.

== Execution ==

In July 1793, Bailly left Nantes to join his friend Pierre-Simon Laplace at Melun, but was recognized there and arrested. On 14 October, he was pressed to testify against Marie Antoinette but refused. On 10 November 1793, he was brought before the Revolutionary Tribunal in Paris, speedily tried, and sentenced to death the next day. On 12 November 1793, he was guillotined at the Champ de Mars, a site selected symbolically as the location of his betrayal of the republican movement. The little red flag he had used to give the order to fire on the crowds on the Champs de Mars was tied to the cart that took him to his death, and burned in front of him before he was executed. It was the revival of this event as a part of republican heritage after 10 August 1792, as well as a campaign of municipal persecution led by Marat, that ultimately resulted in Bailly&#x27;s execution, as well as that of &quot;many of his colleagues&quot;. Before his death, he was forced to endure the freezing rain and the insults of a howling mob. When a scoffer shouted, &quot;Tu trembles, Bailly?&quot; (&quot;Do you tremble, Bailly?&quot;), he responded, &quot;Oui, mais c&#x27;est seulement de froid&quot; (&quot;Yes, but it is only the cold&quot;).

<text>Doué-la-Fontaine () is a former commune in the Maine-et-Loire department in western France. On 30 December 2016, it was merged into the new commune Doué-en-Anjou. It is located in the heart of Anjou, a few kilometres from the great châteaux of the Loire Valley.

==Sights==
The town was known as &quot;Vetus Doadum&quot; (&quot;Old Doadum&quot;), &quot;Teotuadum castrum,&quot; in Late Antiquity, identifiable in a document of 631 as &quot;Castrum Doe&quot;. The foundations of a 6th-century circular baptistery beside the natural springs has been uncovered beneath the ruins of the pre-Romanesque church of Saint-Léger, itself destroyed in the 17th century. It was the site of a Gallo-Roman villa that was inherited by the Carolingians. In his villa here, &quot;Theoduadum palatium&quot;, Louis the Pious was informed of the death of his father Charlemagne in 814 and hurried to Aachen to be crowned. The villa was turned into a motte in the 10th century, around which the village developed, in part in excavated troglodyte dwellings. In 1055 the site was identified as &quot;Doedus&quot;, then &quot;Docium&quot; in 1177.
Doué-la-Fontaine is the site of the oldest habitable &quot;donjon&quot; (keep) in France, dating back to c. 950. No traces of Doué&#x27;s medieval fortifications remain, save the names of &quot;gates&quot; given to certain streets. The castle is widely believed to have been the first European castle to be built out of stone (at around 950).

Nearby are the troglodyte dwellings, where the inhabitants took refuge from the Normans, and commercial mushroom-growing caves. The stone of Doué-la-Fontaine was quarried for sarcophagi from the town. The zoo of Doué-la-Fontaine is partly built within the network of the troglodytes sites and dwellings. Recently, a cave containing sarcophagi was unearthed.

In 1793, Doué-la-Fontaine was the site of massacres during the counter-Revolutionary Revolt in the Vendée, suppressed by General Santerre.

==Events==
Doué-la-Fontaine is known as the rose capital of France. A &quot;Festival of the Rose&quot; is held there in July of each year, where in one park alone more than 800 varieties can be seen.

<text>Samuel Conlon Nancarrow (; October 27, 1912 – August 10, 1997) was an American-Mexican composer who lived and worked in Mexico for most of his life. Nancarrow is best remembered for his &quot;Studies for Player Piano&quot;, being one of the first composers to use auto-playing musical instruments, realizing their potential to play far beyond human performance ability. He lived most of his life in relative isolation and did not become widely known until the 1980s.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Nancarrow was born in Texarkana, Arkansas. He played trumpet in a jazz band in his youth before studying music first in Cincinnati, Ohio, and later in Boston, Massachusetts, with Roger Sessions, Walter Piston and Nicolas Slonimsky. He met Arnold Schoenberg during that composer&#x27;s brief stay in Boston in 1933.

In Boston, Nancarrow joined the Communist Party. When the Spanish Civil War broke out, he traveled to Spain to join the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in fighting against Francisco Franco. He was interned by the French at the Gurs internment camp in 1939. Upon his return to the United States in 1939, he learned that his Brigade colleagues were finding it difficult to renew their U.S. passports. After spending some time in New York City, Nancarrow moved in 1940 to Mexico, in order to escape similar harassment.

He visited the United States briefly in 1947 and became a Mexican citizen in 1956. His next appearance in the U.S. was in San Francisco for the New Music America festival in 1981. He traveled regularly in the following years and lived in the current Casa Estudio Conlon Nancarrow (designed by Juan O&#x27;Gorman) at Las Águilas, Mexico City, until his death at 84. He was friends with some Mexican composers but was largely unknown in the local music establishment.

===As a composer===
It was in Mexico that Nancarrow did the work for which he is best known today. He had already written some music in the United States, but the extreme technical demands of his compositions required great proficiency in the performer, which resulted in there being only rare satisfactory performances. That situation did not improve in Mexico&#x27;s musical environment. According to Annette Nancarrow&#x27;s recollections, Nancarrow was frustrated by the &quot;technical difficulties involved with two human hands playing his compositions on a piano,&quot; which he discussed with Arthur Gregor, a friend who was a school principal. After some exploration, they located a shop where Nancarrow was able to purchase a device that could create player piano rolls, and &quot;worked with the owner to learn technical details, such as how to record loud and soft, and different types of notes, and improve the machine.&quot; Taking a suggestion from Henry Cowell&#x27;s book &quot;New Musical Resources&quot;, which he bought in New York in 1939, Nancarrow found the answer in the player piano, with its ability to produce extremely complex rhythmic patterns at a speed far beyond the abilities of humans.

Cowell had suggested that just as there is a scale of pitch frequencies, there might also be a scale of tempi. Nancarrow undertook to create music which would superimpose tempi in cogent pieces and, by his twenty-first composition for player piano, he had begun &quot;sliding&quot; (increasing and decreasing) tempi within strata. (See William Duckworth, &quot;Talking Music&quot;.) Nancarrow later said he had been interested in exploring electronic resources but that the piano rolls ultimately gave him more temporal control over his music.

Temporarily buoyed by an inheritance, Nancarrow traveled to New York City in 1947 and bought a custom-built manual punching machine to enable him to punch the piano rolls. The machine was an adaptation of one used in the commercial production of rolls, and using it was very hard work and very slow. He also adapted the player pianos, increasing their dynamic range by tinkering with their mechanism and covering the hammers with leather (in one player piano) and metal (in the other) so as to produce a more percussive sound. On this trip to New York, he met Cowell and heard a performance of John Cage&#x27;s &quot;Sonatas and Interludes&quot; for prepared piano (also influenced by Cowell&#x27;s aesthetics), which would later lead to Nancarrow&#x27;s modestly experimenting with prepared piano in his Study No. 30.

Nancarrow&#x27;s first pieces combined the harmonic language and melodic motifs of early jazz pianists like Art Tatum with extraordinarily complicated metrical schemes. The first five rolls he made are called the &quot;Boogie-Woogie Suite&quot; (later assigned the name &quot;Study No. 3 a-e&quot;). His later works were abstract, with no obvious references to any music apart from his own.

Many of these later pieces (which he generally called &quot;studies&quot;) are canons in augmentation or diminution (i.e. prolation canons). While most canons using this device, such as those by Johann Sebastian Bach, have the tempos of the various parts in quite simple ratios, such as 2:1, Nancarrow&#x27;s canons are in far more complicated ratios. The Study No. 40, for example, has its parts in the ratio &quot;e&quot;:pi, while the Study No. 37 has twelve individual melodic lines, each one moving at a different tempo.

Having spent many years in obscurity, Nancarrow benefited from the 1969 release of an entire album of his work by Columbia Records as part of a brief flirtation of the label&#x27;s classical division with modern avant-garde music.
===Later life===
In 1976–77, Peter Garland began publishing Nancarrow&#x27;s scores in his &quot;Soundings&quot; journal, and Charles Amirkhanian began releasing recordings of the player piano works on the 1750 Arch label. Thus, at age 65, Nancarrow started coming to wide public attention. He became better known in the 1980s and was lauded by many, including György Ligeti, as one of the most significant composers of the century.

In 1982, he received a MacArthur Award which paid him $300,000 over 5 years. This increased interest in his work prompted him to write for conventional instruments, and he composed several works for small ensembles.

In 1987, a composer and instrument builder named Trimpin would work with Nancarrow to preserve his pieces in an early MIDI format using his piano roll reader. Then, from that data, the music could be converted into relevant mediums such as the cassette tape and the floppy disk.

Nancarrow was married to Annette Margolis Nancarrow (grandmother of the writer Bret Stephens).

On March 2, 1971, Nancarrow married Yoko Sugiura Yamamoto in Mexico City.

Nancarrow died in 1997 in Mexico City. The complete contents of his studio, including the player piano rolls, the instruments, the libraries, and other documents and objects, are now in the Paul Sacher Foundation in Basel.

==Reception==
The composer György Ligeti described the music of Conlon Nancarrow as &quot;the greatest discovery since Webern and Ives ... something great and important for all music history! His music is so utterly original, enjoyable, perfectly constructed, but at the same time emotional ... for me it&#x27;s the best music of any composer living today.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 1995, the composer and critic Kyle Gann published a full-length study of Nancarrow&#x27;s output, &quot;The Music of Conlon Nancarrow&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 1995, 303 pp.). Jürgen Hocker, another Nancarrow specialist, published &quot;Begegnungen mit Nancarrow&quot; (neue Zeitschrift für Musik, Schott Musik International, Mainz 2002, 284 pp.)

Some of Nancarrow&#x27;s studies for player piano have been arranged for musicians to play on other instruments.

The German musician Wolfgang Heisig has long given live performances of Nancarrow&#x27;s rolls, as did Jürgen Hocker until his death in 2012. Both used acoustical instruments similar to Nancarrow&#x27;s.

Other performers of Nancarrow&#x27;s works (often in arrangement for live musicians) include Thomas Adès, Alarm Will Sound, and ensemble Calefax from the Netherlands who also recorded the Studies for player piano, hailed as &#x27;Best CD of 2009&#x27; by Dutch newspaper Het Parool. American clarinetist and composer Evan Ziporyn has adapted a number of Nancarrow&#x27;s player piano studies for the Bang on a Can All-Stars to perform live.

Nancarrow&#x27;s work has also been seen as the analog predecessor to Black MIDI, a genre of electronic music.

Nancarrow was an early inspiration to the American computer scientist and composer Jaron Lanier.

In 2012, Other Minds in collaboration with Cal Performances and the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive held a three-day festival of films and music celebrating Nancarrow&#x27;s centennial in Berkeley, California.

In 2024, composer and sound artist Dario Acuña Fuentes-Berain (&quot;Dario Afb&quot;) used a collection of objects contributed by artist Lenka Clayton to prepare the late Conlon Nancarrow&#x27;s historic piano, then composed and performed a new work on the altered instrument in Nancarrow&#x27;s Mexico City studio.

==Recordings==

Columbia Records MS 7222 (released 1969, deleted 1973) Studies Nos. 2, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 33. Recorded at the composer&#x27;s studio under his supervision. Includes the original version of Study #10.

New World Records &quot;Sound Forms for Piano&quot; (LP released 1976, CD released 1995) includes Studies Nos. 1, 27 and 36, which were recorded at the composer&#x27;s studio in 1973 using his two Ampico player pianos, and recording equipment described as &quot;antiquated but well maintained&quot;.

1750 Arch Records (recorded 1977) produced by Charles Amirkhanian and originally released on 4 LPs between 1977 and 1984. These are the only available recordings using Nancarrow&#x27;s original instruments: two 1927 Ampico player pianos, one with metal-covered felt hammers and the other with leather strips on the hammers, representing the most faithful reproduction of what Nancarrow heard in his own studio.

Nancarrow&#x27;s entire output for player piano has been recorded and released on the German Wergo label in 1989–91.

In 1993, BMG released a CD (090262611802) of works by Nancarrow (Studies for Player Piano, Tango, Toccata, Piece No.2 for Small Orchestra, Trio, Sarabande &amp; Scherzo) played by Ensemble Modern, conducted by Ingo Metzmacher.

In March 2000, Other Minds Records released a CD of largely forgotten works by Nancarrow, &quot;Lost Works, Last Works&quot;, including previously unrecorded works such as &quot;Piece for Tape&quot; and Nancarrow&#x27;s own recording of his study for prepared player piano, in addition to an interview with the composer himself.

In July 2008, Other Minds Records released a newly remastered version of the 1750 Arch Records recordings on 4 CDs. The 4-CD set includes a 52-page booklet with the original liner notes by James Tenney, an essay by producer Charles Amirkhanian and 24 illustrations.

A recording of &quot;Study #7&quot;, arranged for orchestra, was performed by the London Sinfonietta and included on their 2006 CD &quot;Warp Works &amp; Twentieth Century Masters&quot;.

An arrangement of &quot;Player Piano Study #6&quot; for piano and marimba was recorded by Alan Feinberg and Daniel Druckman on Feinberg&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Fascinating Rhythm&quot;. Feinberg also recorded the pre-Player Piano era piece &quot;Prelude&quot; on the 1995 album &quot;The American Innovator&quot; on Argo / Decca.

<text>Montrichard () is a town and former commune in the Loir-et-Cher department, Centre-Val de Loire, France. On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Montrichard Val de Cher.

During the French Revolution, the commune was known as .

==Geography==
The town lies on the north bank of the river Cher. south of Blois, west of Vierzon and east of Tours. The countryside is mainly constituted of vineyard, woods, cattle and cereals.

==Sites and monuments==
* Château de Montrichard, a mediaeval castle.
* Nanteuil Church (12th, 13th, 15th centuries), whose statue of the Virgin Mary is the object of a very ancient pilgrimage on Whit Monday.
* Church of the Holy Cross (&quot;Église Ste-Croix&quot;) has a fine Romanesque doorway and was the site of Joan of France&#x27;s marriage to the future king.
* Château de Pont-Cher, a 15th-century home built into the cliff, containing the René Galloux collection of prehistoric and Gallo-Roman artefacts from excavations in the Cher valley.

==Pronunciation==
 is pronounced , with a T sound, despite its silence in the word and similar place names such as . One of the explanations that may justify the pronunciation of the T is that is derived from the words (mountain, hill), (for three) and (square), because the town is situated on a hill surrounded on three sides by square towers.

==Notable people==
* Joan of France, Duchess of Berry, married the future king of France Louis XII in Montrichard, though the marriage was later annulled.
* André Alerme, a French actor who appeared in more than 70 films, died here in 1960.
* Paulette Abagnale, mother of Frank Abagnale, confidence trickster
* Gaétan Cathelineau, painter of portraits and of historical and genre subjects.
* Eugénie Luce, French educator who lived and worked in Algiers, died in Montrichard in 1882.

==Popular culture==
The town is mentioned in the 2002 film &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;, as the town from which the mother of Frank Abagnale came. Later in the film, Abagnale has set up a high-end printing facility for printing corporate cheques in Montrichard when he is tracked down and arrested by the FBI. The exterior shots of the town, however, were filmed in the Place Royale in the lower town of Quebec City, Canada, which is identifiable by the presence of the Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church.

<text>There are four provinces of Ireland: Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Ulster. The Irish word for this territorial division, , meaning &quot;fifth part&quot;, suggests that there were once five, and at times Meath has been considered to be the fifth province. In the medieval period, however, there were often more than five. The number of provinces and their delimitation fluctuated until 1610, when they were permanently set by the English administration of James I. The provinces of Ireland no longer serve administrative or political purposes but function as historical and cultural entities.

==Etymology==
In modern Irish, the word for province is (pl. ). The modern Irish term derives from the Old Irish (pl. ) which literally meant &quot;a fifth&quot;. This term appears in 8th-century law texts such as and in the legendary tales of the Ulster Cycle where it refers to the five kingdoms of the &quot;Pentarchy&quot;. MacNeill enumerates the five earliest fifths mentioned, these comprising the kingdoms of Ulster, Connacht, Munster, Tara (North Leinster) and Dinn Riogh (South Leinster), located on the Barrow. The earliest hero tales name the Boyne as the dividing boundary between Ulster and Leinster, indicating that no province representative of Meath or Brega was yet in existence. The kings of Tara and Dinn Riogh were said to derive from the same lineage, which ruled all the Laigin. In the 12th century (Book of Rights), the term means province, seemingly having lost its fractional meaning with seven listed. Similarly this seems to be the case in regards to titles with the Annals of Ulster using the term (king of the fifth/province) for certain overkings.

==History==

The origins of the provinces of Ireland can be traced to the medieval (literally &quot;fifths&quot;) or &quot;over-kingdoms&quot; of Ireland. There were theoretically five such over-kingdoms; however, in reality during the historical period there were always more. At the start of the 9th century the following are listed: Airgíalla, Connachta, Laigin, Northern Uí Néill (Ailech), Southern Uí Néill (Mide), Mumu, and Ulaid. These seven over-kingdoms are again listed in the 12th-century .

===Structure===
Each over-kingdom was divided into smaller territorial units, the definition of which, whilst not consistent in Irish law tracts, followed a pattern of different grades. In theory in the early medieval period:
*A province was ruled by a &quot;king of over-kings&quot;, known as a . This was the highest rank allowed for in Irish law tracts despite claims by some dynasties to the symbolic title of (king of Tara), also known as the (High King of Ireland); The term was replaced at a later date by the term , &quot;king of a fifth&quot;.
*Each province was made up of several petty-kingdoms that corresponded roughly to the size of modern Irish counties or dioceses, and were ruled by an overking known as a ;
*Each of these petty-kingdoms was further subdivided into smaller petty-kingdoms known as a (a group of people), equating at their largest to the size of an Irish barony. These túath were ruled by a king, or , and were also known as a , or &quot;king of the people&quot;. By the 10th century the rulers of a were no longer assumed to be kings but became referred to as (a lord) or (a leader) instead.
This pyramid structure, however, by the later medieval period, had little validity.

Paul MacCotter proposes the following structure of lordship in the 12th century: High-king of Ireland; semi-provincial king, such as Connacht, Ulaid, Desmumu; regional king, such as Dál Fiatach and Uí Fhiachrach Aidni; local king or king of a , such as Leth Cathail or Cenél Guaire; and at the bottom.

===Early medieval period===

The kingdom of Osraige, which had its genealogy traced back by early Irish genealogists to the Laigin, was part of Mumu from the 6th to 8th century and ruled by the Corcu Loígde dynasty. By the 7th century Osraige had lost their dependence on the Corcu Loígde, with the restoration of the local Dál Birn dynasty. Osraige remained part of Mumu until 859 when Máel Sechnaill I, king of the Uí Néill, forced Mumu to surrender it to his overlordship. After this situation ended it became an independent kingdom which gradually moved towards the Laigin sphere of influence as they sought to claim the Laigin kingship. It was during the 9th century that Osraige, ruled by Cerball mac Dúnlainge, became a major political player.

Airgíalla had come under the dominance of the Ulaid; however, Niall Caille, the son of Áed Oirdnide, brought it under the hegemony of the Northern Uí Néill after defeating the combined forces of the Airgíalla and Ulaid at the battle of Leth Cam in 827.

===Later medieval period===
After a period of dynastic infighting in the early 12th century, Osraige fragmented and after a heavy defeat at the hands of High-King Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn became part of Laigin. In 1169, the king of Osraige, Domnall Mac Gilla Pátraic, hired the Norman knight Maurice de Prendergast to resist the Laigin king, Diarmait Mac Murchada, who had also recruited Norman aid.

In 1118, the king of Connacht, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair, aided the Mac Cárthaigh of south Munster in a rebellion against the ruling Uí Briain dynasty. This resulted in the division of Mumu into two: (Thomond, meaning &quot;north Munster&quot;) to the north under the Uí Briain; and (Desmond, meaning &quot;south Munster&quot;) to the south under the Mac Cárthaigh. Ua Conchobair would then conquer the heartland of the Uí Briain situated around modern County Clare and make it part of Connacht. This was to force them to accept Cormac Mac Carthaig, king of Desmumu, as the king of Mumu. Despite Ua Conchobair&#x27;s aid, Mac Carthaig and the Uí Briain would form an alliance to campaign against Connacht&#x27;s hegemony, and by 1138 ended the threat from that kingdom. The following decades would see Mumu united and repartitioned several times as the Uí Briain and Mac Cárthaigh vied for complete control. In 1168, the king of Connacht, Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, ensured Mumu remained divided. After Henry II, king of England, landed in Ireland in 1171, the Mac Cárthaigh submitted to him to prevent an Uí Briain invasion. The Uí Briain eventually followed suit in submitting to Henry II. The eagerness of these submissions encouraged Henry II to revive the papal grant, Laudabiliter, for Ireland.

===Norman Ireland===
Osraige would be amongst the first Irish kingdoms to fall following the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1170, and was soon afterwards split from Leinster and made part of the royal demesne lands of Waterford.

In the years following the invasion, the kingdoms of Connacht, Desmumu, Laigin, Mide, Tuadmumu, and Ulaid formed the basis for the Norman liberties of Connacht, Desmond, Leinster, Meath, Thomond and Ulster respectively. These liberties were later subdivided into smaller ones that became the basis for the counties of Ireland.

The Northern Uí Néill remained outside of Norman control, eventually absorbing the greater part of Airgíalla, which had by the end of the 12th century lost its eastern territory (afterwards known as &quot;English Oriel&quot; and later as Louth) to the Normans. Airgíalla would eventually no longer be reckoned an over-kingdom; however, it survived in present-day County Monaghan for as long as the Gaelic order survived, with the last king of Airgíalla being Hugh Roe McMahon, who reigned from 1589 until his execution in September/October 1590.

With the collapse of English control in Ireland following the Bruce campaign in Ireland in 1315, and the subsequent collapse of the Earldom of Ulster, the Gaelic order had a resurgence and the Clandeboye O&#x27;Neills of the Northern Uí Néill stepped into the power vacuum in Ulster bringing it under the sovereignty of the O&#x27;Neills of Tyrone. After this they claimed for the first time the title of , &quot;king of Ulster&quot;, amalgamating their territory into one united province. This reduced the number of provinces to five—Connact, Leinster, Meath, Munster, and Ulster.

===Tudor period===

During the reign of Mary I (1553–1558), the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, sought to divide Ireland into six parts—Connacht, Leinster, Meath, Nether Munster, Ulster, and Upper Munster. His administrative reign in Ireland, however, was cut short; and even with his reappointment by Elizabeth I (1558–1603) this plan was never implemented.

Sir Henry Sidney during his three tenures as Lord Deputy created two presidencies headed by a Lord President to administer Connacht and Munster. In an attempt to reduce the importance of the province of Munster, Sydney, using the River Shannon as a natural boundary took Thomond and made it into the county of Clare as part of the presidency of Connaught in 1569. Around 1600 near the end of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, Clare was made an entirely distinct presidency of its own under the Earls of Thomond and would not return to being part of Munster until after the Restoration in 1660.

The exact boundaries of the provinces of Ireland during the Tudor period changed several times, usually as a result of the creation of new counties:
*County Clare upon its creation in 1569 was transferred from Munster to Connacht, and was only restored to Munster after 1660.
*County Longford upon its creation in 1583 was transferred from Leinster to Connacht.
*County Cavan was created in 1584 and transferred from Connacht to Ulster.
*County Louth, which had long been part of The Pale, was transferred from Ulster to Leinster.

It would not be until the reign of Elizabeth&#x27;s successor, James I, that Meath by 1610 would cease to be considered a province and that the provincial borders would be permanently set.

==Prehistory==
The earliest recorded mention of the major division of Ireland is in the Ulster Cycle of legends, such as the . The is set during the reign of , king of Ulster, and is believed to have happened in the 1st century. In this period Ireland is said to have been divided into five independent over-kingdoms, or whose (kings) were of equal rank, not subject to a central monarchy. Pseudo-historians called this era , which has been translated as: &quot;Time of the Pentarchs&quot;; &quot;Time of the Five Fifths&quot;; and &quot;Time of the provincial kings&quot;. It was also described as &quot;the Pentarchy&quot;.

The five provinces that made up the Pentarchy where:
*, with its royal seat at .
* (Ulster), with its royal seat at .
* (Munster), with its royal seat at .
* (North Leinster), with its royal seat at &quot;Tara&quot; (before it became the seat of the High King).
* (South Leinster), with its royal seat at .

Historians Geoffrey Keating and T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly differ suggesting that it is Munster, not Leinster, that formed two of the fifths. These two fifths were called by Keating: (eastern Munster) and (western Munster), both named after their respective king. Eoin MacNeill discounts this suggestion citing the , which makes mention of as king of all Munster, with simply a &quot;great Munster hero&quot;. He also cites that the makes mention of the four fifths of Ireland that waged war on Ulster, which made reference to only one Munster. Another reason given by MacNeill was a problem made by Keating himself. According to Keating, when the province of was being founded, it was created from portions of each province which all met at the hill of Uisnech. The boundaries given by Keating himself for the five provinces, however, meant that this would have been highly unlikely, with the boundary between his Munster fifths nowhere near this area.

Pseudo-historians list 84 kings of Ireland prior to the formation of the Pentarchy. When this mythical kingship was interrupted is a matter of dispute. The Annals of Tigernach state that Ireland was divided into the five upon the slaying of Conaire Mór; however, it is suggested alternatively that it happened upon the death of Conaire&#x27;s father, Eterscél Mór, the 84th king of Ireland. Keating, however, suggests it occurred in the reign of Eochu Feidlech who was the 82nd king of Ireland.

MacNeill claims that this division of Ireland into five is pre-historic and pre-Gaelic, describing the Pentarchy as &quot;the oldest certain fact in the political history of Ireland&quot;. The notion of Ireland being divided into five permeated itself throughout Irish literature over the centuries despite what the representing no longer existing by the time of Saint Patrick in the 5th century. By then, Ireland had become divided into seven over-kingdoms.

===The Three Collas and the founding of Airgíalla===
The main body of the events in the myth of the Three Collas may have occurred in the late 4th to early 5th century; however, as the centuries passed the myth underwent updating and alteration. The most oft quoted version of their story was written by Geoffrey Keating in the 17th century in his work the , also known as &quot;The History of Ireland&quot;.

In it the Three Collas—Colla Menn, Colla Da Crioch, and Colla Uais—were the sons of Eocaidh Doimlén. It is from them that the Airgíalla are said to descend, branching off from the rest of the Connachta. The Northern and Southern Uí Néill dynasties are claimed to descend from Eocaidh&#x27;s brother, Fiacha Sraibhtine. According to the story the Collas were told by Fiacha&#x27;s son, Muiredach Tirech, the High King of Ireland, to conquer land of their own to pass on to their descendants, directing them to wage war on the Ulaid to avenge a slight against their great-grandfather Cormac mac Airt.

The Collas with their army along with a host from Connacht marched to Achaidh Leithdeircc in Fernmagh, southern Ulaid, and fought the Ulaid in seven battles over the course of seven days. The host from Connacht fought the first six battles, and the Collas fought the seventh. It is after this last battle that the king of Ulaid, Fergus Foga, was killed and his army routed. The Collas then pursued the Ulaid east of the &quot;Glen Righe&quot; (the valley of the Newry River in eastern County Armagh), before returning to loot and burn the Ulaid capital, Emain Macha, after which it never again had a king. They then took possession of central Ulaid spanning the modern counties of Armagh, Fermanagh, Londonderry, Monaghan and Tyrone founding the over-kingdom of Airgíalla.

==Usage==

In modern times the provinces have become associated with groups of counties, although they have no legal status. They are today seen mainly in a sporting context. Ireland&#x27;s four professional rugby teams in the United Rugby Championship play under the names of the provinces. The Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) has separate provincial councils and its county teams contest provincial championships.

Six of the nine Ulster counties form modern-day Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. Many of Northern Ireland&#x27;s unionist political parties use &quot;Ulster&quot; in their names such as the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and the Ulster Democratic Party (UDP). The ITV regional service is known as Ulster Television but generally abbreviated to UTV, while BBC Radio Ulster is the main BBC radio station from BBC Northern Ireland.

In education Munster Technological University and Ulster University both use the provinces in which they are located in their name.

Many hotels also use the name of the province in which they are situated.

In media many local and regional newspapers use their province in their names such as &quot;The Munster Express&quot; in Waterford, &quot;Leinster Leader&quot; in Kildare, &quot;Connacht Tribune&quot; in Galway and &quot;Ulster Herald&quot; in Fermanagh.

In modern times politically the four provinces were referred to in the proposal of (&quot;New Ireland&quot;), which was supported by the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin during the 1970s and early 1980s for a federal United Ireland. The proposal was particularly associated with the Dublin-based leadership group centred on Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and Dáithí Ó Conaill, who were the authors of the policy. envisaged a united Ireland that would be created when the British withdrew from Northern Ireland, and the creation of a federal state with assemblies for each of its four historic provinces.

The song Ireland&#x27;s Call is used as a national anthem for sports teams representing the entire island (e.g. Ireland national rugby union team and Ireland cricket team). The first verse says &quot;We have come to answer our country&#x27;s call from the four proud provinces of Ireland&quot;.

==Coats of arms==
Each province is today represented by its own unique arms and flag. These are joined to represent various All Ireland sports teams and organisations via the Four Provinces Flag of Ireland and a four province Crest of Ireland, with examples including the Ireland national field hockey team, Ireland national rugby league team, Ireland national rugby union team and Irish Amateur Boxing Association.

==Demographics and politics==
==Poetic description==
===Ard Ruide===

The poem named (Ruide Headland) poetically describes the five kingdoms of Ireland. Below is a translation from Old Irish:

===The Táin===
The epic poem, &quot;An Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot; (the Cattle Raid of Cooley) describes a war between Connacht and Ulster, and is perhaps best known for CúChulainn&#x27;s single handed defence of Ulster against the champions of Connacht in turn, while his comrades were disabled by a spell.

<text>Lady Grizel Baillie, &quot;née&quot; Hume, (25 December 1665 – 6 December 1746) was a Scottish gentlewoman and songwriter. Her accounting ledgers, in which she kept details about her household for more than 50 years, provide information about social life in Scotland in the eighteenth century.

== Biography ==

Born at Redbraes Castle, Berwickshire, Grizel Hume was the eldest daughter of Grisell Ker and Sir Patrick Hume (later Earl of Marchmont). When she was twelve years old, she carried letters from her father to a Scottish conspirator in the Rye House Plot, Robert Baillie of Jerviswood, who was then in prison. Hume&#x27;s sympathy for Baillie made him a suspected man and the king&#x27;s troops occupied Redbraes Castle. He remained in hiding for some time in the crypt of Polwarth Church, where his daughter smuggled food to him; but on hearing of the execution of Baillie (1684), he fled to the United Provinces, where his family joined him soon after. They returned to Scotland after the Glorious Revolution.

In 1692, Lady Grizel married George Baillie, son of Robert. The couple had first met when they were twelve and supposedly, fell in love at that point. What is known for certain is that after returning to Scotland, Lady Grizel turned down the offer to be one of Queen Mary&#x27;s maids of honour, and insisted to her parents on marrying Baillie over a more advantageous match. The couple had two daughters: Grizel (1692–1759), who married British Army officer Sir Alexander Murray of Stanhope in 1710; and Rachel (1696–1773), who married Charles Lord Binning in 1717 (and whose son Thomas became the seventh Earl of Haddington). They also had a short-lived son, Robert ().

She died in London on 6 December 1746, and was buried at Mellerstain on 25 December, her eighty-first birthday.

==Works==

===Songs===
Her elder daughter, Lady Grizel Murray of Stanhope, had in her possession a manuscript in prose and verse of her mother&#x27;s songs. Some of them had been printed in Allan Ramsay&#x27;s, &quot;Tea-Table Miscellany&quot;. The most famous of Lady Grizel&#x27;s Scots songs, &quot;And werena my heart light I wad dee&quot;, originally appeared in William Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Orpheus Caledonius, or a Collection of the Best Scotch Songs&quot; (1725).

===Household books===
Lady Grizel Baillie&#x27;s account books, meticulously kept from 1692 to 1746, reveal information about social life in Scotland in the eighteenth century. Her entries begin late into her first year of marriage and end just before her death. They consist of more than a thousand pages of entries. In 1911 the Scottish Historical Society published a 400-page scholarly edition of Lady Grizel Baillie&#x27;s accounts, edited by Robert Scott-Moncrieff. This edition focused mainly on the entries from 1692 to 1718, which give extensive details about the early years of the Baillies’ marriage, the births and upbringing of their children, and the marriages of their daughters. Historians have cited these accounts to demonstrate cost of goods and to provide evidence for the caloric intake of servants during this period.

==Legacy==
A great deal is known about George and Grizel Baillie&#x27;s marriage and family thanks to the biography written by their daughter, Grizel Baillie, Lady Murray. Although not intended for publication, the biography appeared in print in 1809 in &quot;Observations on the Historical Work of the Right Honorable Charles James Fox&quot; under the title, &quot;Lady Murray&#x27;s Narrative&quot;. George Baillie&#x27;s &quot;Correspondence&quot; (1702-1708) was edited by Lord Minto for the Bannatyne Club in 1842.

Lady Grizel also was memorialized by a Scottish poet who claimed to be a distant relative, Joanna Baillie, in a poem first published in 1821 in &quot;Metrical Legends of Exalted Characters&quot;.

<text>According to apocrypha, as well as Christian and Islamic tradition, Saint Anne was the mother of Mary, the wife of Joachim and the maternal grandmother of Jesus. Mary&#x27;s mother is not named in the Bible&#x27;s canonical gospels. In writing, Anne&#x27;s name and that of her husband Joachim come only from New Testament apocrypha, of which the Gospel of James (written perhaps around 150 AD) seems to be the earliest that mentions them. The mother of Mary is mentioned but not named in the Quran.

==Christian tradition==
The story is similar to that of Samuel, whose mother Hannah ( &quot;Ḥannāh&quot; &quot;favour, grace&quot;; etymologically the same name as Anne) had also been childless. The Immaculate Conception was eventually made dogma by the Catholic Church following an increased devotion to Anne in the twelfth century. Dedications to Anne in Eastern Christianity occur as early as the sixth century. In the Eastern Orthodox tradition, Anne and Joachim are ascribed the title &quot;Ancestors of God&quot;, and both the Nativity of Mary and the Presentation of Mary are celebrated as two of the twelve Great Feasts of the Orthodox Church. The is also a minor feast in Eastern Christianity. In Lutheran Protestantism, it is held that Martin Luther chose to enter religious life as an Augustinian friar after invoking St. Anne while endangered by lightning.

==In Islam==
Anne () is also revered in Islam, recognized as a highly spiritual woman and as the mother of Mary. She is not named in the Quran, where she is referred to as &quot;the wife of Imran&quot;. The Quran describes her remaining childless until her old age. One day, Anne saw a bird feeding its young while sitting in the shade of a tree, which awakened her desire to have children of her own. She prayed for a child and eventually conceived; her husband, Imran, died before the child was born. Expecting the child to be male, Anne vowed to dedicate him to isolation and service in the Second Temple; however, Anne bore a daughter instead, and named her Mary. Her words upon delivering Mary reflect her status as a great mystic, realising that while she had wanted a son, this daughter was God&#x27;s gift to her:

==Beliefs==

Although the canonical books of the New Testament never mention the mother of the Virgin Mary, traditions about her family, childhood, education, and eventual betrothal to Joseph developed very early in the history of the church. The oldest and most influential source for these is the apocryphal Gospel of James, first written in Koine Greek around the middle of the second century AD. In the West, the Gospel of James fell under a cloud in the fourth and fifth centuries when it was accused of &quot;absurdities&quot; by Jerome and condemned as untrustworthy by Pope Damasus I, Pope Innocent I, and Pope Gelasius I. However, despite having been condemned by the Church, it was taken over almost &quot;in toto&quot; by another apocryphal work, the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, which popularised most of its stories.

Ancient belief, attested to by a sermon of John of Damascus, was that Anne married once. The sister of Saint Anne was Sobe, mother of Elizabeth. In the fifteenth century, the Catholic cleric Johann Eck related in a sermon that St Anne&#x27;s parents were named Stollanus and Emerentia. Frederick George Holweck, writing in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; (1907) regards this genealogy as spurious.

In the 4th century and then much later in the fifteenth century, a belief arose that Mary was conceived of Anne without original sin. This belief in the Immaculate Conception states that God preserved Mary&#x27;s body and soul intact and sinless from her first moment of existence, through the merits of Jesus Christ. The Immaculate Conception, often confused with the Annunciation of the Incarnation (Mary&#x27;s virgin birth of Jesus), was made dogma in the Catholic church by Pope Pius IX&#x27;s papal bull, &quot;Ineffabilis&quot; &quot;Deus&quot;, in 1854. The 13th century &quot;Speculum Maius&quot; of Vincent of Beauvais incorporates information regarding the life of Saint Anne from an earlier work by Hrotsvitha of Gandersheim Abbey.

==Veneration==
In the Eastern church, the veneration of Anne herself may go back as far as , when Justinian built a church in Constantinople in her honor. The earliest pictorial sign of her veneration in the West is an eighth-century fresco in the church of Santa Maria Antiqua, Rome. The Feast of the Conception of the Virgin Mary had reached southern Italy by the ninth century. In the Latin Church St. Anne was not venerated, except, perhaps, in the south of France, before the thirteenth century. A shrine at Douai, in northern France, was one of the early centers of devotion to St. Anne in the West.

The &quot;Anna Selbdritt&quot; was a type of iconography depicting the three generations of Saint Anne, Mary, and the child Jesus. Emphasizing the humanity of Jesus, it drew on the earlier conventions of the Seat of Wisdom, and was popular in northern Germany in the 1500s. During the High Middle Ages, Saint Anne became increasingly identified as a maritime saint, protecting sailors and fisherman, and invoked against storms.

Two well-known shrines to St. Anne are that of Ste-Anne-d&#x27;Auray in Brittany, France; and that of Ste-Anne-de-Beaupré near the city of Québec. The number of visitors to the Basilica of Ste-Anne-de-Beaupré is greatest on St Anne&#x27;s Feast Day, 26 July, and the Sunday before Nativity of the Virgin Mary, 8 September. In 1892, Pope Leo XIII sent a relic of St Anne to the church.

In the Maltese language, the Milky Way galaxy is called &quot;It-Triq ta&#x27; Sant&#x27;Anna&quot;, literally &quot;The Way of St. Anne&quot;. In the United States, the Daughters of the Holy Spirit named the former Annhurst College in her honor.

==Commemoration==
By the middle of the 7th century, a distinct feast day, the Conception of St. Anne (Maternity of Holy Anna) celebrating the conception of Mary by Saint Anne, was observed at the Monastery of Saint Sabas. It is now known in the Greek Orthodox Church as the feast of &quot;The Conception by St. Anne of the Most Holy Theotokos&quot;, and celebrated on 9 December. In the Roman Catholic Church, the Feast of Saints Anne and Joachim is celebrated on 26 July.

===Relics===

The alleged relics of St. Anne were brought from the Holy Land to Constantinople in 710 and were kept there in the church of St. Sophia as late as 1333. During the 12th and 13th centuries, returning crusaders and pilgrims from the East brought relics of Anne to a number of churches, including most famously those at Apt, in Provence, Ghent, and Chartres. St. Anne&#x27;s relics have been preserved and venerated in the many cathedrals and monasteries dedicated to her name, for example in Austria, Canada, Germany, Italy, and Greece in the semi-autonomous Mount Athos, and the city of Katerini. Medieval and baroque craftsmanship is evidenced in, for example, the metalwork of the life-size reliquaries containing the bones of her forearm. Examples employing folk art techniques are also known. Düren has been the main place of pilgrimage for Anne since 1506, when Pope Julius II decreed that her relics should be kept there.

==Patronage==

The Church of Saint Anne in Beit Guvrin National Park was built by the Byzantines and the Crusaders in the 12th century, known in Arabic as Khirbet (lit. &quot;ruin&quot;) Sandahanna, the mound of Maresha being called Tell Sandahanna. Saint Anne is patroness of unmarried women, housewives, women in labor or who want to be pregnant, grandmothers, mothers and educators. She is also a patroness of horseback riders, cabinet-makers and miners. As the mother of Mary, this devotion to Saint Anne as the patron of miners arises from the medieval comparison between Mary and Christ and the precious metals silver and gold. Anne&#x27;s womb was considered the source from which these precious metals were mined. 

Saint Anne is the patron saint of Brittany (France), Cuenca (Ecuador), Chinandega (Nicaragua), the Mi&#x27;kmaq people of Canada, Castelbuono (Sicily), Quebec (Canada), Santa Ana (California), Norwich (Connecticut), Detroit (Michigan), Adjuntas (Puerto Rico), Santa Ana and Jucuarán (El Salvador), Berlin (New Hampshire), Santa Ana Pueblo, Seama, and Taos (New Mexico), Chiclana de la Frontera, Marsaskala, Tudela and Fasnia (Spain), Town of Sta Ana Province of Pampanga, Molo, Iloilo City, Balasan, Iloilo, Hagonoy, Santa Ana, Taguig City, Saint Anne Shrine, Malicboy, Pagbilao, Quezon and Malinao, Albay (Philippines), Santana (Brazil), Saint Anne (Illinois), Sainte Anne Island, Baie Sainte Anne and Praslin Island (Seychelles), Bukit Mertajam and Port Klang (Malaysia), Kľúčové (Slovakia) and South Vietnam. The parish church of Vatican City is Sant&#x27;Anna dei Palafrenieri. There is a shrine dedicated to Saint Anne in the Woods in Bristol, United Kingdom.

==In art==

===&quot;Christ in the House of His Parents&quot;===
In John Everett Millais&#x27;s 1849–50 work, &quot;Christ in the House of His Parents&quot;, Anne is shown in her son-in-law Joseph&#x27;s carpentry shop caring for a young Jesus who had cut his hand on a nail. She joins her daughter Mary, Joseph, and a young boy who will later become known as John the Baptist in caring for the injured hand of Jesus.

===Iconography===
The subject of Joachim and Anne &quot;The Meeting at the Golden Gate&quot; was a regular component of artistic cycles of the Life of the Virgin. The couple meet at the Golden Gate of Jerusalem and embrace. They are aware of Anne&#x27;s pregnancy, of which they have been separately informed by an archangel. This moment stood for the conception of Mary, and the feast was celebrated on the same day as the Immaculate Conception. Art works representing the Golden Gate and the events leading up to it were influenced by the narrative in the widely read &quot;Golden Legend&quot; of Jacobus de Voragine. The Birth of Mary, the Presentation of Mary and the Marriage of the Virgin were usual components of cycles of the Life of the Virgin in which Anne is normally shown here. Her emblem is a door. She is often portrayed wearing red and green, representing love and life.

Anne is never shown as present at the Nativity of Christ, but is frequently shown with the infant Christ in various subjects. She is sometimes believed to be depicted in scenes of the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple and the Circumcision of Christ, but in the former case, this likely reflects a misidentification through confusion with Anna the Prophetess. There was a tradition that Anne went (separately) to Egypt and rejoined the Holy Family after their Flight to Egypt. Anne is not seen with the adult Christ, so was regarded as having died during the youth of Jesus. Anne is also shown as the matriarch of the Holy Kinship, the extended family of Jesus, a popular subject in late medieval Germany; some versions of these pictorial and sculptural depictions include Emerentia who was reputed in the fifteenth century to be Anne&#x27;s mother. In modern devotions, Anne and her husband are invoked for protection for the unborn.

===Virgin and Child with Saint Anne===
The role of the Messiah&#x27;s grandparents in salvation history was commonly depicted in early medieval devotional art in a vertical double-Madonna arrangement known as the Virgin and Child with Saint Anne. Another typical subject has Anne teaching the Virgin Mary the Scriptures.

<text>Joanna Baillie (11 September 1762 – 23 February 1851) was a Scottish poet and dramatist, known for such works as &quot;Plays on the Passions&quot; (three volumes, 1798–1812) and &quot;Fugitive Verses&quot; (1840). Her work shows an interest in moral philosophy and the Gothic. She was critically acclaimed in her lifetime, and while living in Hampstead, associated with contemporary writers such as Anna Barbauld, Lucy Aikin, and Walter Scott. She died at the age of 88.

==Early life==
===Background===
Baillie was born on 11 September 1762 in Bothwell. Her mother, Dorothea Hunter (c. 1721–1806), was a sister of the Scottish physicians and anatomists William and John Hunter. Her father, Rev. James Baillie (c. 1722–1778), was a Presbyterian minister, and in his last two years Professor of Divinity at the University of Glasgow. Her aunt, Anne Home Hunter, was a poet. The Baillies were an old Scottish family which claimed descent from the Scottish patriot, Sir William Wallace. Wallace is not known to have had any children, however.

Joanna Baillie was the youngest of three children: her twin sister died unnamed as a baby, her surviving sister was Agnes Baillie (1760–1861), who lived to be a centenarian. Their brother, Matthew, became a London physician. Joanna was no dedicated scholar. Her early passions were for the Scottish countryside. She had her own pony and her interest in stories was demonstrated by plays she created and stories she told. At home she was dealt with strictly and displays of anger or glee were discouraged. She was not taken to the theatre. The only drama she saw was a puppet show.

In 1769, the family moved to Hamilton, where her father was appointed to the collegiate church. Baillie did not learn to read until the age of ten, when she attended Miss McDonald&#x27;s Glasgow boarding school, ostensibly known for &quot;transforming healthy little hoydens into perfect little ladies&quot; (Carswell 266). She was said to have had &#x27;an epiphany&#x27; when she first attended a theatre. From then she wrote plays and poems, as well as demonstrated her abilities in mathematics, music and art.

Baillie&#x27;s father died in 1778 and their financial position decreased, although Matthew went on to study medicine at Balliol College, Oxford. The rest of the family retreated to Long Calderwood near East Kilbride. They returned in 1784, as her uncle Dr William Hunter had died the year before and her brother had been left a London house and his collection, which is now the University of Glasgow&#x27;s Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery. Her aunt, Anne Hunter, was a society hostess and a poet, and through her Baillie was introduced to the bluestockings Fanny Burney, Elizabeth Carter, and Elizabeth Montagu. She studied Corneille, Racine, Molière, Voltaire and Shakespeare, and wrote plays and poetry while running their brother&#x27;s household until he married in 1791. Her works were not published until that time, and even then anonymously, after both her father and uncle William had died in 1783.

Joanna and her sister and mother moved houses several times, before settling in Colchester, where she began her &quot;Plays on the Passions&quot;. In 1802 they moved to Hampstead, after her brother had inherited a considerable sum of money, where she would live with her sister for the next half-century. Neither sister married. Her aunt Anne Home Hunter introduced her to London literary society, after in 1800, a re- print of her work revealed her identity. 

In 1806, Mrs Baillie died. Anna Laetitia Barbauld and her niece Lucy Aikin were neighbours and close friends. She wrote letters to Sir Walter Scott and they would visit and stay with each other; he wrote a prologue to her 1810 production of &quot;The Family Legend&quot;.

When she reached her seventies, Baillie experienced a year of ill health, but recovered and returned to writing and correspondence, and included Scottish folk songs in her &quot;Fugitive Verses&quot; written in her eighties (in 1840).

&quot;[Joanna Baillie] was anxious that all her works with the exception of her theological pamphlet (see Religious writing) be collected in a single volume, and had the satisfaction of seeing this &#x27;great monster book&#x27; as she called it, which appeared in 1851, shortly before she died. Though no longer robust — &#x27;Ladies of four score and upwards cannot expect to be robust, and need not be gay. We sit by the fireside with our books&#x27; (Carhart, 62) — she had remained in good health until the end. She died in 1851 in Hampstead, almost 90 years old. Her sister Agnes lived on to be 100. Both sisters were buried alongside their mother in Hampstead parish churchyard, and in 1899 a sixteen-foot-high memorial was erected in Joanna Baillie&#x27;s memory in the churchyard of her birthplace at Bothwell.&quot;
==Literary and dramatic works==
===Poetry===
*1790 Baillie&#x27;s first publication was &quot;Poems: Wherein it is Attempted to Describe Certain Views of Nature and of Rustic Manners&quot;. She later revised a selection of these early poems, which were reprinted in her &quot;Fugitive Verses&quot; (1840). Her first poem, &quot;Winter Day&quot;, evoked winter sights and sounds in the neighbourhood of Long Calderwood.
*1821 Her &quot;Metrical Legends of Exalted Characters&quot; told in verse the heroic stories of such historical figures as William Wallace, Christopher Columbus, and Lady Grizel Baillie. They were inspired in part by the popularity of Walter Scott&#x27;s heroic ballads, her enthusiasm for which had made writing drama &quot;less interesting for a time&quot; (Baillie, &quot;Memoirs&quot;).
*1836 Three volumes of &quot;Dramatic Poetry&quot;
*1840 Encouraged by her old friend, banker-poet Samuel Rogers, Baillie issued a new collection, &quot;Fugitive Verses&quot;, some of which were old and some recently written. It was generally agreed that her popular songs, especially those in Scots, would live on.
*1849 Baillie published the poem &quot;Ahalya Baee&quot; for private circulation. It subsequently appeared as &quot;Allahabad&quot; in 1904.

===Plays===
*1790 A tragedy, &quot;Arnold&quot;, which was never published
*&quot;A serious comedy&quot;, which was later burnt
*&quot;Rayner&quot; was heavily revised before it was published in &quot;Miscellaneous Plays&quot; (1804).
*1791 &quot;Plays on the Passions&quot; first conceived
*1798 The first volume of &quot;Plays on the Passions&quot; was published anonymously as &quot;A Series of Plays&quot;. Volume 1 consisted of &quot;Count Basil,&quot; a tragedy on love, &quot;The Tryal,&quot; a comedy on love, and &quot;De Monfort,&quot; a tragedy on hatred. 
In a long introductory discourse, the author defended and explained her ambitious design to illustrate each of the deepest and strongest passions of the human mind. The plays, the author explained, were part of a still larger design and completely original concept, arising from a particular view of human nature, in which sympathetic curiosity and observation of the movement of feeling in others were paramount. Real passion, &quot;genuine and true to nature&quot;, was to be the subject; each play was to focus on the growth of one master passion. This unusually analytical and arguably artificial approach generated much discussion and controversy, and in &quot;a week or two &quot;Plays on the Passions&quot; was a main topic... in the best literary circles&quot; (Carswell 273). The whole of London was excited to figure out who the author could be. Authorship was attributed to a male until someone pointed out that all of the protagonists were middle-aged women, rarely the muses of male authors (Carswell 274). Baillie finally revealed herself as the author in 1800, in the title-page of the third edition.
*1800 &quot;De Monfort&quot; was produced at Drury Lane with John Kemble and Sarah Siddons in the leading roles. Splendidly staged, the play ran for eight nights, but was not a theatrical success. 
*1802 The second volume of &quot;Plays on the Passions&quot; was published under Joanna Baillie&#x27;s name, with a preface acknowledging the reception given to volume one: &quot;praise mixed with a considerable portion of censure&quot;. Volume 2 consisted of &quot;The Election&quot;, a comedy on hatred, &quot;Ethwald&quot;, a tragedy in two parts on ambition, and &quot;The Second Marriage&quot;, a comedy on ambition. Baillie saw these plays, especially &quot;Ethwald&quot;, as exemplifying her best writing.
*1804 A volume entitled &quot;Miscellaneous Plays&quot;; the tragedies &quot;Rayner&quot; and &quot;Constantine Paleologus&quot;, and a comedy, &quot;The Country Inn&quot;
*1810 The Scottish-themed &quot;The Family Legend&quot;, produced at Edinburgh under the patronage of Sir Walter Scott, had a brief though brilliant success. It included a prologue by Scott and an epilogue by Henry Mackenzie. Its success encouraged the theatre managers to revive &quot;De Monfort&quot;, which was also well received.
*1812 A third and final volume of &quot;Plays on the Passions&quot; consisted of two gothic tragedies, &quot;Orra&quot; and &quot;The Dream&quot;, a comedy, &quot;The Siege&quot;, and a serious musical drama, &quot;The Beacon&quot;. The tragedies and comedy represented the passion of Fear, while the musical drama represented Hope. Introducing what she called &quot;probably the last volume of plays I shall ever publish,&quot; she explained that she intended to complete her project by writing further dramas on the passions of Remorse, Jealousy and Revenge, but did not intend to publish them, as publication had discouraged stage production.
*1815 &quot;The Family Legend&quot;, produced at Drury Lane, London
*1821 &quot;De Monfort&quot; [sic] was produced at Drury Lane, London, with Edmund Kean in the title role. &quot;Constantine Paleologus&quot;, though written with John Kemble and Sarah Siddons in mind, was declined by Drury Lane. It was produced at the Surrey Theatre as a melodrama, &quot;Constantine and Valeria&quot;, and in its original form at Liverpool, Dublin and Edinburgh.
*1836 Three volumes of &quot;Miscellaneous Plays&quot; were published. They included nine new plays, and the continuation of &quot;Plays on the Passions&quot; promised earlier: a tragedy and comedy on jealousy and a tragedy on remorse. Their publication created a stir, and critics were almost all enthusiastic and welcoming. &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot; declared, &quot;Had we heard that a MS play of Shakespeare&#x27;s, or an early, but missing, novel of Scott&#x27;s, had been discovered, and was already in the press, the information could not have been more welcome&quot; (&quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, p. 236).

Baillie&#x27;s reputation does not rest entirely on her dramas; she also authored poems and songs admired for their beauty. Considered the best are the &quot;Lines to Agnes Baillie on her Birthday&quot;, &quot;The Kitten&quot;, &quot;To a Child&quot; and some of her adaptations of Scottish songs, such as &quot;Woo&#x27;d and Married an&#x27;a&quot;. Scattered through the dramas are some lively and beautiful songs: &quot;The Chough&quot; and &quot;The Crow&quot; in &quot;Orra&quot;, and the lover&#x27;s song in &quot;The Phantom&quot;. Her poem &quot;A Mother to her Waking Infant&quot; was thought &#x27;closely observed&#x27; from watching interaction of babies and mothers in her circle.

==Defending her stage plays==
Initially, Baillie was reluctant to publish her works. In a letter to Sir Walter Scott, she wrote, &quot;Were it not that my Brother has expressed a strong wish that I should publish a small vol: of poetry, I should have very little pleasure in the thought.&quot; This shyness is in keeping with her humble, contented disposition. She did not seek acclaim for her poems, but simply wrote them for enjoyment. Ironically, they have become better known than her plays.

However, in an 1804 prefatory address in &quot;Miscellaneous Plays&quot;, Baillie defended her plays as acting plays. The criticism that she had no understanding of practical stagecraft and that her plays were torpid and dull in performance rankled throughout her life, and she was always delighted to hear of a production being mounted, no matter how humble it might be. She believed that critics had unfairly labelled her work as closet drama, partly because she was a woman and partly because they had failed to read her prefaces with care. She pointed also to the conventions of the theatre in her time, when lavish spectacle on huge stages was the order of the day. Her own plays, with their attention to psychological detail, worked best, she argued, in well-lit small theatres where facial expressions could clearly be seen. She wrote, &quot;I have wished to leave behind me in the world a few plays, some of which might have a chance of continuing to be acted even in our canvas theatres and barns.&quot; It is clear that Baillie wanted her plays to be acted, not just read.

==Religious writing==

Growing up as a Presbyterian minister&#x27;s daughter, religion had always been important to Baillie. In 1826 she published &quot;The Martyr&quot;, a tragedy on religion, intended for reading only. In 1831 she entered into public theological debate with a pamphlet, &quot;A view of the general tenour of the New Testament regarding the nature and dignity of Jesus Christ&quot;, where she analysed the doctrines of order in the Trinity, Arianism, and Socinianism. As she mentions in the preface to &quot;The Martyr&quot;, Baillie was concerned about the &quot;many perplexing and contradictory doctrines&quot; that &quot;churchmen&quot; had added to the Bible. Believing that &quot;no Christian — no Protestant Christian, regulates, or at least ought to regulate, his faith by any thing but what appears to him to be really taught in Scripture,” she devoted most of &quot;A view of the general tenour of the New Testament regarding the nature and dignity of Jesus Christ&quot; to presenting relevant passages in the New Testament so that those with &quot;[g]ood intentions [and] a clear common understanding&quot; could make their own decisions regarding the question of Christ&#x27;s divinity. The Unitarian minister Thomas Sadler, who preached her funeral sermon, appreciated not only &quot;her own free and diligent search after revealed truth&quot; but also the way that she &quot;respected the faithful convictions of others in proportion as she valued her own.&quot; 

==Philanthropy and literary advice==
Financially secure herself, Joanna Baillie customarily gave half her earnings from writing to charity, and engaged in many philanthropic activities. In the early 1820s she corresponded with a Sheffield campaigner, James Montgomery, in support of his efforts on behalf of chimney sweeps. She declined to send a poem, fearing that was &quot;just the very way to have the whole matter considered by the sober pot-boilers over the whole kingdom as a fanciful and visionary thing,&quot; whereas &quot;a plain statement of their miserable lot in prose, accompanied with a simple, reasonable plan for sweeping chimneys without them&quot; was far better strategically (letter, 5 Feb 1824).

Where literary matters were concerned, Joanna Baillie had a shrewd understanding of publishing as a trade. She took seriously the influence her eminence gave her, and authors down on their luck, women writers, and working-class poets like the shoemaker poet John Struthers applied to her for assistance. She wrote letters, drew on all her contacts, and used her knowledge of the literary world to advise or to further a less well-connected writer. In 1823, she edited and published by subscription a collection of poems by many leading writers of the day, in support of a widowed old school friend with a family of daughters to support.

Baillie befriended the eccentric American writer, critic and activist John Neal, after reading his article &quot;Men and Women&quot; in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in October 1824. He in turn admired Baillie&#x27;s poems and plays and welcomed the attention from the more established literary figure.

Wordsworth himself considered Baillie the &quot;ideal gentlewoman&quot;, despite the fact that she was Scottish (Zell 19). Her most famous work, &quot;De Monfort&quot;, helped to inspire Lord Byron&#x27;s closet drama &quot;Manford&quot; (Strand 1). Byron went on to value her advice, calling her &quot;the only dramatist since Orwan&quot; (Zell 19). In 1806 Baillie solidified a friendship with Scott and she and her sister would often visit Scotland (Strand 1).

==Reputation and legacy==
American critic and writer John Neal referred to Baillie in an 1866 &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; article as the &quot;female Shakespeare of a later age&quot;.

John Stuart Mill, in his &quot;Autobiography&quot;, recalled that in childhood, Baillie&#x27;s &quot;Constantine Paleologus&quot; seemed to him &quot;one of the most glorious of human compositions&quot; He continued to see it &quot;one of the best dramas of the last two centuries&quot;.

Two &quot;songs&quot; from &quot;Ethwald&quot;, &quot;Hark! the cock crows&quot; and &quot;Once upon my cheek he said the roses grew&quot;, were set to music by the English composer John Wall Callcott. Beethoven also set her poem O Swiftly Glides the Bonny Boat to music in 1815.

One of her few detractors was Francis Jeffrey, who in 1803 published a long condemnatory review of the &quot;Plays on the Passions&quot; in the Edinburgh Review. He attacked the narrow theory, practice and purpose of the plays. Though he praised her &quot;genius&quot;, Baillie marked Jeffrey down as a literary enemy and refused a personal introduction. Not until 1820 would she agreed to meet him; but they then became warm friends. James Hogg referenced their earlier clash in &quot;John Paterson&#x27;s Mare&quot;, his allegorical satire on the Edinburgh publishing scene first published in the &quot;Newcastle Magazine&quot; in 1825, in which Baillie features as &quot;a very interesting Scotch girl&quot;.

Maria Edgeworth, recording a visit in 1818, summed up her appeal for many: &quot;Both Joanna and her sister have most agreeable and new conversation, not old, trumpery literature over again and reviews, but new circumstances worth telling, apropos to every subject that is touched upon; frank observations on character, without either ill-nature or the fear of committing themselves; no blue-stocking tittle-tattle, or habits of worshipping or being worshipped.&quot;

Joanna Baillie offered a new way of looking at drama and poetry. She was revered by poets on both sides of the Atlantic; many of her contemporaries placed her above all women poets except Sappho. According to Harriet Martineau she had &quot;enjoyed a fame almost without parallel, and... been told every day for years, through every possible channel, that she was second only to Shakespeare.&quot; Works of hers were translated into Sinhalese and German, and she was performed widely in both the United States and Britain.

Yet even when Martineau met her in the 1830s, that fame seemed to belong to a bygone era. There were no revivals of her plays in the 19th or 20th century, though her tragedies might seem suited to the intimacy of television or film. Not until the late 20th century did critics began to recognize how her intimate depictions of the human psyche had influenced Romantic literature. Scholars now recognize her importance as a stage innovator and dramatic theorist, and critics and literary historians of the Romantic period concerned with reassessing the place of women writers acknowledge her significance.

Joanna Baillie was great friends with Lady Byron. This friendship led her to be close friends and colleagues with Lord Byron as well. Lord Byron even attempted to get one of her plays to be performed at Drury Lane, sadly to no avail. Their friendship continued until a domestic division arose between Lord and Lady Byron, leaving Baillie to take the side of her friend. After this, she was more critical of Lord Byron and his work, calling his characters &quot;untrue to nature and morally bankrupt&quot; While they were still polite to each other as literary contemporaries, their friendship did not return.

One of those Baillie corresponded with most was Sir Walter Scott. The two wrote enough letters to each other to fill a sizeable volume. Scott appreciated and supported Baillie as a literary contemporary, but their relationship did not stop there. Their letters are full of personal details and conversations about their families. While they both respected each other&#x27;s work, their friendship was deeper than just professional.

On 11 September 2018, to commemorate the 256th anniversary of her birth, Google released a Google Doodle celebrating her, and her work has &#x27;enjoyed a resurgence of popularity&#x27; in recognition of her circumstances.

<text>Edward Hodges Baily (10 March 1788 – 22 May 1867; sometimes misspelled Bailey) was a prolific British sculptor responsible for numerous public monuments, portrait busts, statues and exhibition pieces as well as works in silver. He carved friezes for both the Marble Arch and Buckingham Palace in London. His numerous statues of public figures include that of Horatio Nelson on top of Nelson&#x27;s Column and Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey on Grey&#x27;s Monument in Newcastle upon Tyne. Throughout his career Baily was responsible for creating a number of monuments and memorials for British churches and cathedrals, including several in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

==Biography==
Baily was born on 10 March 1788, at Downend in Gloucestershire, to Martha Hodges (1755–1836) and William Hillier Baily (1763–1834), a woodcutter who specialised in carving ship&#x27;s figureheads. At the age of fourteen he was placed as an accounts clerk in a mercantile house, where he worked for two years, though he continued to produce wax models and busts, his childhood hobby. In 1804, aged sixteen, he abandoned his job and set himself up as a professional wax portraitist. Two Homeric studies, executed for a friend, were shown to the sculptor John Flaxman who was so impressed, that in 1807, he accepted Baily as a pupil in his London studio and subsequently employed him as an assistant. In 1808, Baily won the silver medal of the Society of Arts for a plaster figure of Laocoön and the next year entered the Royal Academy Schools. At the academy he won a silver medal in 1809 and in 1811 he gained their gold medal for a model of &quot;Hercules restoring Alcestis to Admetus&quot;, and soon after exhibited &quot;Apollo discharging his Arrows against the Greeks&quot; and &quot;Hercules casting Lichas into the Sea&quot;. 

From 1816 to 1846, Baily was the Chief Modeller for Rundell, Bridge and Rundell, goldsmiths to the royal family, where he was responsible for creating the Doncaster Cup trophy in 1843 and the Ascot Gold Cup in 1844. Baily also produced designs for the silversmith Paul Storr. For a soup tureen commission in 1821, Baily designed a pair of ornamental handles which became the basis of his large scale marble sculpture &quot;Eve at the Fountain&quot;, which was acquired by the Bristol Literary Institute and is now in the Bristol Museum &amp; Art Gallery. Widely reproduced at reduced sizes in both Parian ware and bronze, the work was among the most popular individual sculptures in Britain at the time. Baily returned to Eve as a subject in 1842 with the work &quot;Eve listening to the Voice&quot;. Baily was elected an Associate member of the Royal Academy in 1817 and, on the strength of &quot;Eve at the Fountain&quot;, a full Academician in 1821.

From the 1820s until 1858, Baily had a series of high-profile public commissions and was also responsible for numerous portrait busts, statues and exhibition pieces. He carved the bas-reliefs on the facade of the Masonic Hall on Park Street in Bristol and those on the south side of the Marble Arch in Hyde Park in 1826. When changes were made to the size and design of the Marble Arch, a number of friezes that Baily had carved were considered surplus to requirements but were installed on the facade of Buckingham Palace. He also designed the models of the stone figures installed on the pediment of Buckingham Palace when the building was enlarged and carved the frieze &quot;Britannia Rewarding Arts and Sciences&quot; for the Palace&#x27;s throne room. He created the prominent statue of Horatio Nelson for the top of Nelson&#x27;s Column, in Trafalgar Square. For the facade of the National Gallery facing onto Trafalgar Square he created a series of statues and friezes.

Baily exhibited at the Royal Academy regularly from 1810 to 1862 and at the British Institution from 1812 to 1840. His exhibition pieces often represented aspects of family life with titles such as &quot;Maternal Affection&quot; and &quot;Mother and Child&quot;. For Saint Stephen&#x27;s Hall in the Palace of Westminster he created statues of Charles James Fox and Lord Mansfield. Subjects of his portrait busts included the Duke of Wellington, his mentor John Flaxman and Lord Byron. Several of his designs for monuments were cast as small scales bronzes for the domestic retail market, notably his equestrian statue of George IV.

Financial insecurity was a recurring theme in Baily&#x27;s life. He was first declared bankrupt in 1831, and again in 1838. On the first occasion questions were asked in Parliament on his behalf because his financial distress had resulted from delays in receiving payment for sculptures at Buckingham Palace. Fortunately his appeals to the Royal Academy for financial assistance, were successful in the 1830s, as again in the 1860s, when they provided him with a pension of £200 a year as an honorary retired Academician. Baily&#x27;s election as a fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) came in 1842. Among his final works was the design for the Turner medal in 1857, the Royal Academy&#x27;s award for landscape painting.

Baily married Elizabeth Wardley (1786–1836) in Bristol during 1806 and the couple had four children. Their daughter, Caroline, married Edgar George Papworth Senior one of Baily&#x27;s assistants. Among his other assistants and pupils were John Henry Foley, Musgrave Watson, Joseph Durham, Edward Bowring Stephens and William Theed. Baily&#x27;s nephew was William Hellier Baily, the paleontologist. 
Baily died at 99 Devonshire Road in Holloway, London, on 22 May 1867, aged 79, and is buried on the western side of Highgate Cemetery.

<text>Francis Baily (28 April 177430 August 1844) was an English astronomer. He is most famous for his observations of &quot;Baily&#x27;s beads&quot; during a total eclipse of the Sun. Baily was also a major figure in the early history of the Royal Astronomical Society, as one of the founders and as the president four times.

==Life==

Baily was born at Newbury in Berkshire in 1774 to Richard Baily. After a tour in the unsettled parts of North America in 1796–1797, his journal of which was edited by Augustus De Morgan in 1856, Baily entered the London Stock Exchange in 1799. The successive publication of &quot;Tables for the Purchasing and Renewing of Leases&quot; (1802), of &quot;The Doctrine of Interest and Annuities&quot; (1808), and &quot;The Doctrine of Life-Annuities and Assurances&quot; (1810), earned him a high reputation as a writer on life-contingencies; he amassed a fortune through diligence and integrity and retired from business in 1825, to devote himself wholly to astronomy.

==Astronomical work==
By 1820, Baily had already taken a leading part in the foundation of the Royal Astronomical Society, and he received its Gold Medal in 1827 for his preparation of the Society&#x27;s &quot;Catalogue of 2881 stars&quot; (&quot;Memoirs R. Astr. Soc.&quot; ii.). Later, in 1843, he would win the Gold Medal again. He was elected as President of the Royal Astronomical Society four times, with two-year terms each (1825–1827, 1833–1835, 1837–1839 and 1843–1845). No other person has served in the position more than Baily&#x27;s four times (a record he shares with George Airy), whilst his eight years in the post are a record.

The reform of the Nautical Almanac in 1829 was set on foot by his protests. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1832. He recommended to the British Association in 1837, and in great part executed, the reduction of Joseph de Lalande&#x27;s and Nicolas de Lacaille&#x27;s catalogues containing about 57,000 stars; he superintended the compilation of the British Association&#x27;s &quot;Catalogue of 8377 stars&quot; (&quot;BAC&quot;, published 1845); and revised the catalogues of Tobias Mayer, Ptolemy, Ulugh Beg, Tycho Brahe, Edmund Halley and Hevelius (&quot;Memoirs R. Astr. Soc.&quot; iv, xiii.).

His observations of &quot;Baily&#x27;s Beads&quot;, during an annular eclipse of the Sun on 15 May 1836, at Inch Bonney in Roxburghshire, started the modern series of eclipse expeditions. The phenomenon, which depends upon the irregular shape of the Moon&#x27;s limb, was so vividly described by him as to attract an unprecedented amount of attention to the total eclipse of 8 July 1842, observed by Baily himself at Pavia.

In other work, he completed and discussed H. Foster&#x27;s pendulum experiments, deducing from them an ellipticity for the Earth of 1/289.48 (Memoirs R. Astr. Soc. vii.). This value was corrected for the length of the seconds-pendulum by introducing a neglected element of reduction, and was used, in 1843, in the reconstruction of the standards of length. His laborious operations for determining the mean density of the Earth, carried out by Henry Cavendish&#x27;s method (1838–1842), yielded the authoritative value of 5.66.

Baily died in London on 30 August 1844 and was buried in the family vault in St Mary&#x27;s Church in Thatcham, Berkshire. His Account of the Rev. John Flamsteed (1835) is of fundamental importance to the scientific history of that time. It included a republication of the British Catalogue.

The lunar crater Baily was named in his honour, as was the rigid and thermally insensitive alloy used to cast the 1855 standard yard (&quot;Baily&#x27;s metal&quot;, 16 parts copper, 2.5 parts tin, 1 part zinc), and a local primary school in the town of Thatcham (Francis Baily CofE Primary School).

<text>William Hellier Baily (7 July 18196 August 1888) was an English palaeontologist. His uncle was E.H. Baily, a sculptor. William Hellier Baily was born at Bristol on 7 July 1819.

From 1837 to 1844 he was Assistant Curator in the Bristol Museum, a post he relinquished to join the staff of the British Geological Survey in London. In 1854 he became assistant naturalist, under Edward Forbes and afterwards under Huxley. In 1857 he was transferred to the Irish branch of the Geological Survey, as acting palaeontologist, and retained this post until the end of his life.
He was the author of many papers on palaeontological subjects, and of notes on fossils in the explanatory memoirs of the &quot;Geological Survey of Ireland&quot;. He published (1867–1875) a useful work entitled &quot;Figures of Characteristic British Fossils, with Descriptive Remarks&quot;, of which only the first volume, dealing with palaeozoic species, was issued. The figures were all drawn on stone by himself. He died at Rathmines near Dublin on 6 August 1888.

<text>Alexander Bain (11 June 1818 – 18 September 1903) was a Scottish philosopher and educationalist in the British school of empiricism and a prominent and innovative figure in the fields of psychology, linguistics, logic, moral philosophy and education reform. He founded &quot;Mind&quot;, the first ever journal of psychology and analytical philosophy, and was the leading figure in establishing and applying the scientific method to psychology. Bain was the inaugural Regius Chair in Logic and Professor of Logic at the University of Aberdeen, where he also held Professorships in Moral Philosophy and English Literature and was twice elected Lord Rector of the University of Aberdeen.

==Early life and education==

Alexander Bain was born in Aberdeen, north Scotland, to George Bain, a weaver and veteran soldier, and Margaret Paul. At age eleven he left school to work as a weaver hence the description of him as Weevir, &quot;rex philosophorum&quot;. He also attended lectures at the Mechanics&#x27; Institutes of Aberdeen and the Aberdeen Public Library.

In 1836 he entered Marischal College where he came under the influence of Professor of Mathematics John Cruickshank, Professor of Chemistry Thomas Clark and Professor of Natural Philosophy William Knight. Towards the end of his undergraduate degree he became a contributor to the &quot;Westminster Review&quot; with his first article entitled &quot;Electrotype and Daguerreotype,&quot; published in September 1840. This was the beginning of his connection with John Stuart Mill, which led to a lifelong friendship. He was awarded the Blue Ribbon and also the Gray Mathematical Bursary. His college career and studies were distinguished especially in mental philosophy, mathematics and physics and he graduated with a Master of Arts with Highest Honours.

In 1841, Bain substituted for Dr. Glennie the Professor of Moral Philosophy, who, due to ill-health, was unable to discharge his academic duties. He continued to do this three successive terms, during which he continued writing for the &quot;Westminster&quot;, and also helped John Stuart Mill with the revision of the manuscript of his &quot;System of Logic&quot; (1842). In 1843 he contributed the first review of the book to the &quot;London and Westminster&quot;.

==Academic career==
In 1845 he was appointed Professor of Mathematics and Natural philosophy at Anderson&#x27;s University in Glasgow. A year later, preferring a wider field, he resigned the position and devoted himself to writing. In 1848 he moved to London to fill a post in the Board of Health under Sir Edwin Chadwick where he worked for social reform and became a prominent member of the intellectual circle which included George Grote and John Stuart Mill. In 1855 he published his first major work, &quot;The Senses and the Intellect&quot;, followed in 1859 by &quot;The Emotions and the Will&quot;. These treatises won him a position among independent thinkers. Bain was also Examiner in Logic and Moral Philosophy from 1857 to 1862 and 1864–1869 for the University of London and also an instructor in moral science for the Indian Civil Service examinations.

In 1860 he was appointed by the British Crown to the inaugural Regius Chair of Logic and the Regius Chair of English Literature at the University of Aberdeen, which was newly formed after the amalgamation of King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen and Marischal College by the Scottish Universities Commission of 1858.

===Linguistics===

Until 1858, neither logic nor English had received adequate attention in Aberdeen, and Bain devoted himself to supplying these deficiencies. He succeeded not only in raising the Standard of Education generally in the North of Scotland, but also in establishing a School of Philosophy at the University of Aberdeen, and in widely influencing the teaching of English grammar and composition in the United Kingdom. His efforts were first directed to the preparation of textbooks: &quot;Higher English Grammar&quot; and &quot;An English Grammar&quot; were both published in 1863, followed in 1866 by the &quot;Manual of Rhetoric&quot;, in 1872 by &quot;A First English Grammar&quot;, and in 1874 by the &quot;Companion to the Higher Grammar&quot;. These works were wide-ranging and their original views and methods met with wide acceptance.

===Philosophy===

Bain&#x27;s philosophical writings already published, especially &quot;The Senses and the Intellect&quot; to which was added in 1861 The &quot;On the Study of Character&quot; including an &quot;Estimate of Phrenology&quot;, were too large for effective use in the classroom. Accordingly, in 1868, he published his &quot;Manual of Mental and Moral Science&quot;, mainly a condensed form of his treatises, with the doctrines re-stated, and in many instances freshly illustrated, and with many important additions. The year 1870 saw the publication of the &quot;Logic&quot;. This, too, was a work designed for the use of students; it was based on John Stuart Mill, but differed from him in many particulars, and was distinctive for its treatment of the doctrine of the conservation of energy in connection with causation and the detailed application of the principles of logic to the various sciences with a section on the classification of all the sciences. Next came two publications in the &quot;International Scientific Series&quot;, namely, &quot;Mind and Body&quot; (1872), and &quot;Education as a Science&quot; (1879). All these works, from the &quot;Higher English Grammar&quot; downwards, were written by Bain during his twenty years as a professor at the University of Aberdeen. He also started the philosophical journal, &quot;Mind&quot;; the first number appeared in January 1876, under the editorship of a former pupil, George Croom Robertson, of University College London. To this journal Bain contributed many important articles and discussions; and in fact he bore the whole expenses of it till Robertson, owing to ill-health, resigned the editorship in 1891 and George Stout took up the baton.

===Psychology===

Although his influence as a logician and linguist in grammar and rhetoric was considerable, his reputation rests on his works in psychology. At one with the German physiologist and comparative anatomist Johannes Peter Müller in the conviction &quot;psychologus nemo nisi physiologus&quot; (one is not a psychologist who is not also a physiologist), he was the first in Great Britain during the 19th century to apply physiology in a thoroughgoing fashion to the elucidation of mental states. In discussing the will, he favoured physiological over metaphysical explanations, pointing to reflexes as evidence that a form of will, independent of consciousness, inheres in a person&#x27;s limbs. He sought to chart physiological correlates of mental states but refused to make any materialistic assumptions. His idea of applying the scientific method of classification to psychical phenomena gave scientific character to his work, the value of which was enhanced by his methodical exposition and his command of illustration. In line with this, too, is his demand that psychology should be cleared of metaphysics; and to his lead is no doubt due in great measure the position that psychology has now acquired as a distinct positive science. Bain established psychology, as influenced by David Hume and Auguste Comte, as a more distinct discipline of science through application of the scientific method. Bain proposed that physiological and psychological processes were linked, and that traditional psychology could be explained in terms of this association. Moreover, he proposed that all knowledge and all mental processes had to be based on actual physical sensations, and not on spontaneous thoughts and ideas, and attempted to identify the link between the mind and the body and to discover the correlations between mental and behavioural phenomena.

William James calls his work the &quot;last word&quot; of the earlier stage of psychology, but he was in reality the pioneer of the new. Subsequent psycho-physical investigations &quot;have all been in&quot; the spirit of his work; and although he consistently advocated the introspective method in psychological investigation, he was among the first to appreciate the help that may be given to it by social psychology, comparative psychology and developmental psychology. He may justly claim the merit of having guided the awakened psychological interest of British thinkers of the second half of the 19th century into fruitful channels. Bain emphasised the importance of our active experiences of movement and effort, and though his theory of a central innervation sense is no longer held as he propounded it, its value as a suggestion to later psychologists is great. His thought that a belief is but a preparation for action is respected by both pragmatism and functionalism.

===Other works===

Bain&#x27;s autobiography, published in 1904, contains a full list of his works, and also the history of the last thirteen years of his life by Professor W. L. Davidson of the University of Aberdeen, who further contributed to &quot;Mind&quot; (April 1904) a review of Bain&#x27;s services to philosophy. Further works include editions with notes of Paley&#x27;s &quot;Moral Philosophy&quot; (1852); &quot;Education as a Science&quot; (1879); &quot;Dissertations&quot; on leading philosophical topics (1903, mainly reprints of papers in &quot;Mind&quot;); he collaborated with JS Mill and Grote in editing James Mill&#x27;s &quot;Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind&quot; (1869), and assisted in editing Grote&#x27;s &quot;Aristotle and Minor Works&quot;; he also wrote a memoir prefixed to G Croom Robertson&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Remains&quot; (1894).

==Social reform==

Bain took a keen interest in social justice and development and was frequently an active part in the political and social movements of the day; after his retirement from the Chair of Logic, he was twice elected Lord Rector of the University of Aberdeen each term of office extending over three years. He was a strenuous advocate of reform, especially in the teaching of sciences, and supported the claims of modern languages to a place in the curriculum. Moreover, he was an avid supporter for student rights and in 1884 the Aberdeen University Debating Society took the first steps towards the introduction of a students&#x27; representative council and later Aberdeen University Students&#x27; Association under his support.

Bain was a member of the Committee of the Aberdeen Public Library throughout his life as well as the School Board of Aberdeen. Furthermore, Professor Bain gave lectures and wrote papers for the Mechanics&#x27; Institutes of Aberdeen and served as the Secretary of its committee.

His services to education and social reform in Scotland were recognised by the conferment of the honorary degree of Doctor of law by the University of Edinburgh in 1871. A marble bust of him stands in the Aberdeen Public Library and his portrait hangs in Marischal College.

==Later life and death==

Bain retired from his chair and Professorship from the University of Aberdeen and was succeeded by William Minto, one of his most brilliant pupils. Nevertheless, his interest in thought, and his desire to complete the scheme of work mapped out in earlier years, remained as keen as ever. Accordingly, in 1882 appeared the &quot;Biography of James Mill&quot;, and accompanying it &quot;John Stuart Mill: a Criticism, with Personal Recollections&quot;. Next came (1884) a collection of articles and papers, most of which had appeared in magazines, under the title of &quot;Practical Essays&quot;. This was succeeded (1887, 1888) by a new edition of the &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, and along with it, a book &quot;On Teaching English&quot;, being an exhaustive application of the principles of rhetoric to the criticism of style, for the use of teachers; and in 1894 he published a revised edition of &quot;The Senses and the Intellect&quot;, which contain his last word on psychology. In 1894 also appeared his last contribution to &quot;Mind&quot;. His last years were spent in privacy at Aberdeen, where he died on 18 September 1903. He married twice but left no children. His last request was that &quot;no stone should be placed upon his grave: his books, he said, would be his monument.&quot;

The University of Aberdeen Philosophy Department established the Bain Medal in 1883. It is awarded annually to the best candidate who gains First Class Honours in Mental philosophy.

As Professor William L. Davidson wrote in Bain&#x27;s obituary in &quot;Mind&quot; &quot;In Dr. Bain&#x27;s death, psychology has sustained a great loss; but so too has education and practical reform. It is rare to find a philosopher who combines philosophical with educational and practical interests, and who is also an active force in the community in which he dwells. Such a combination was here. Let us not fail to appreciate it.&quot;

<doc id="143114" wikidata="Q454200" url="?curid=143114" title="Jackie Gleason">
<text>Herbert John Gleason (February 26, 1916June 24, 1987), known as Jackie Gleason, was an American actor, comedian, writer, and composer also known as &quot;The Great One&quot;. He developed a style and characters from growing up in Brooklyn, New York, and was known for his brash visual and verbal comedy, exemplified by his city bus driver character Ralph Kramden in the television series &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;. He also developed &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, which maintained high ratings from the mid-1950s through 1970. The series originated in New York City, but filming moved to Miami Beach, Florida, in 1964 after Gleason took up permanent residence there.

Among his notable film roles were Minnesota Fats in 1961&#x27;s &quot;The Hustler&quot; (co-starring with Paul Newman) and Buford T. Justice in the &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; trilogy from 1977 to 1983 (co-starring Burt Reynolds).

Gleason enjoyed a prominent secondary music career during the 1950s and 1960s, producing a series of bestselling &quot;mood music&quot; albums. His first album &quot;Music for Lovers Only&quot; still holds the record for the longest stay on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Ten Charts (153 weeks), and his first ten albums sold over a million copies each. His output includes more than 20 singles, nearly 60 long-playing record albums, and more than 40 CDs.

==Early life==
Gleason was born Herbert Walton Gleason Jr. on February 26, 1916, at 364 Chauncey Street in the Stuyvesant Heights (now Bedford–Stuyvesant) section of Brooklyn. He was later baptized as John Herbert Gleason and grew up at 328 Chauncey Street, Apartment 1A (an address he later used for Ralph and Alice Kramden on &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;). His parents were Herbert Walton &quot;Herb&quot; Gleason (1883–1964), born in New York City to an Irish father and an American mother, and Mae Agnes &quot;Maisie&quot; (née Kelly; 1886–1935), an Irish immigrant from Farranree, County Cork. Gleason was the younger of two children; his elder brother, Clement, died from complications of meningitis at age 14 in 1919.

Gleason remembered Clement and his father having &quot;beautiful handwriting&quot;. He watched his father work at the family&#x27;s kitchen table, writing insurance policies in the evenings. On the night of December 14, 1925, Gleason&#x27;s father disposed of any family photos in which he appeared; just after noon on December 15, he collected his hat, coat, and paycheck, and permanently left his family and job at the insurance company. Once it became evident that he was not coming back, Mae went to work as a subway attendant for the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT).

After his father abandoned the family, young Gleason began hanging around with a local gang, hustling pool. He attended P.S. 73 Elementary School in Brooklyn, John Adams High School in Queens, and Bushwick High School in Brooklyn. Gleason became interested in performing after being part of a class play; he quit school before graduating and got a job that paid $4per night () as master of ceremonies at a theater. Other jobs he held at that time included pool hall worker, stunt driver, and carnival barker. Gleason and his friends made the rounds of the local theaters; he put an act together with one of his friends, and the pair performed on an amateur night at the Halsey Theater, where Gleason replaced his friend Sammy Birch as master of ceremonies. He performed the same duties twice a week at the Folly Theater.

Gleason was 19 when his mother died in 1935 from complications of sepsis from a large neck carbuncle that young Jackie had tried to lance. He had nowhere to go and 36 cents to his name. The family of his first girlfriend, Julie Dennehy, offered to take him in; Gleason, however, was headstrong and insisted that he was going into the heart of the city. His friend Birch made room for him in the hotel room he shared with another comedian. Birch also told him of a week-long gig in Reading, Pennsylvania, which would pay $19—more money than Gleason could imagine (). The booking agent advanced his bus fare for the trip against his salary, granting Gleason his first job as a professional comedian. Following this, he would always have regular work in small clubs.

==Career==
Gleason worked his way up to a job at New York&#x27;s Club 18, where insulting its patrons was the order of the day. Gleason greeted noted skater Sonja Henie by handing her an ice cube and saying, &quot;Okay, now do something.&quot; It was here that Jack L. Warner first saw Gleason, signing him to a film contract for $250 a week.

By age 24, Gleason appeared in films: first for Warner Brothers (as Jackie C. Gleason) in such films as &quot;Navy Blues&quot; (1941) with Ann Sheridan and Martha Raye and &quot;All Through the Night&quot; (1941) with Humphrey Bogart; then for Columbia Pictures for the B military comedy &quot;Tramp, Tramp, Tramp&quot;; and finally for Twentieth Century-Fox, where Gleason played Glenn Miller Orchestra bassist Ben Beck in &quot;Orchestra Wives&quot; (1942). He also had a small part as a soda shop clerk in &quot;Larceny, Inc.&quot; (1942), with Edward G. Robinson and a modest part as an actor&#x27;s agent in the 1942 Betty Grable–Harry James musical &quot;Springtime in the Rockies&quot;.

During World War II, Gleason was initially exempt from military service since he was a father of two. However, in 1943, the US started drafting men with children. When Gleason reported to his induction, doctors discovered that his broken left arm had healed crooked (the area between his thumb and forefinger was nerveless and numb), that a pilonidal cyst existed at the end of his coccyx, and that he was 100 pounds overweight. Gleason was, therefore, classified 4-F and rejected for military service.

Gleason did not initially make a strong impression on Hollywood; at the time, he developed a nightclub act that included comedy and music. At the end of 1942, Gleason and Lew Parker led a large cast of entertainers in the road show production of Olsen and Johnson&#x27;s &quot;New 1943 Hellzapoppin&quot;. He also became known for hosting all-night parties in his hotel suite; the hotel soundproofed his suite out of consideration for its other guests. &quot;Anyone who knew Jackie Gleason in the 1940s&quot;, wrote CBS historian Robert Metz, &quot;would tell you The Fat Man would never make it. His pals at Lindy&#x27;s watched him spend money as fast as he soaked up the booze.&quot; Rodney Dangerfield wrote that he witnessed Gleason purchasing marijuana in the 1940s.

Gleason&#x27;s first significant recognition as an entertainer came on Broadway when he appeared in the hit musical &quot;Follow the Girls&quot; (1944). While working in films in California, Gleason also worked at former boxer Maxie Rosenbloom&#x27;s nightclub (Slapsy Maxie&#x27;s, on Wilshire Boulevard).

===Early television===

Gleason&#x27;s big break occurred in 1949 when, while working at Slapsy Maxie&#x27;s and earning the attention of New York City&#x27;s inner circle, he landed work with the fledgling DuMont Television Network. His first role with DuMont was the role of blunt but softhearted aircraft worker Chester A. Riley for the first television version of the radio comedy &quot;The Life of Riley&quot;, replacing William Bendix, who was unable to take the role due to contractual issues. Despite positive reviews, the show was canceled after one year, in part to DuMont&#x27;s substantial disadvantages. (Bendix did resume the role beginning in 1953 for a more successful five-year series.) As Gleason&#x27;s time on &quot;The Life of Riley&quot; ended in 1950, DuMont&#x27;s &quot;Cavalcade of Stars&quot; variety hour in 1950 had an opening when that show&#x27;s host Jerry Lester jumped to NBC to host the first late-night comedy/variety series &quot;Broadway Open House&quot;. Comedy writer Harry Crane, whom Gleason knew from his days as a stand-up comedian in New York, recommended Gleason for the job. The program initially had rotating hosts; Gleason was first offered two weeks at $750 per week. The offer was extended to four weeks when he responded that this arrangement would not be worth the train trip to New York. Gleason returned to New York for the show and soon became permanent host. He framed the acts with splashy dance numbers, developed sketch characters he would refine over the next decade, and became enough of a presence that CBS wooed him to its network in 1952.

Renamed &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, the program became the country&#x27;s second-highest-rated television show during the 1954–55 season. Gleason amplified the show with even splashier opening dance numbers inspired by Busby Berkeley&#x27;s screen dance routines and featuring the precision-choreographed June Taylor Dancers. Following the dance performance, he would do an opening monolog. Then, accompanied by &quot;a little travelin&#x27; music&quot; (&quot;That&#x27;s a Plenty&quot;, a Dixieland classic from 1914), he would shuffle toward the wings, clapping his hands and shouting, &quot;And awaaay we go!&quot; The phrase became one of his trademarks, along with &quot;How sweet it is!&quot; (which he used in reaction to almost anything). Theona Bryant, a former Powers Girl, became Gleason&#x27;s &quot;And awaaay we go&quot; girl. Ray Bloch was Gleason&#x27;s first music director, followed by Sammy Spear, who stayed with him through the 1960s; Gleason often kidded with his music directors during his opening monologs. He continued developing comic characters, including:
* &quot;Reginald Van Gleason III&quot;, a top-hatted millionaire with a taste for both the good life and fantasy;
* &quot;Rudy the Repairman,&quot; boisterous and boorish;
* &quot;Joe the Bartender&quot;, gregarious and with friendly words for the never-seen Mr. Dennehy (who was always the first one at the bar);
* &quot;The Poor Soul&quot;, a silent character who could (and often did) come to grief in the least-expected places (or demonstrated gratitude at such gifts as being allowed to share a newspaper on a subway);
* &quot;Rum Dum&quot;, a character with a brush-like mustache who often stumbled around as though drunk and confused;
* &quot;Fenwick Babbitt&quot;, a friendly, addle-headed young man usually depicted working at various jobs and invariably failing;
* &quot;Charlie Bratton&quot;, a loudmouth who frequently picked on the mild-mannered Clem Finch (portrayed by Art Carney, a future &quot;Honeymooners&quot; co-star);
* &quot;Stanley R. Sogg&quot;, a pitchman who usually appeared on commercials during late-night TV movies, often selling items that came with extras or bonuses (the ultimate inducement was a 10-pound wedge of Facciamara&#x27;s Macaroni cheese); and
* &quot;The Bachelor,&quot; a silent character (accompanied by the song &quot;Somebody Loves Me&quot;) doing everyday things in an unusually lazy (or makeshift) way.

In a 1985 interview, Gleason explained how some of his invented comic characters were associated with his youth in Brooklyn. The Mr. Dennehy whom Joe the Bartender greets is a tribute to Gleason&#x27;s first love, Julie Dennehy. The character of The Poor Soul was drawn from an assistant manager of an outdoor theater he frequented.

Gleason disliked rehearsing. Using photographic memory he read the script once, then watched a rehearsal with his co-stars and stand-in and shot the show later that day. When he made mistakes, he often blamed the cue cards.

====&quot;The Honeymooners&quot;====
Gleason&#x27;s most famous character by far was blustery bus driver Ralph Kramden. Drawn mainly from Gleason&#x27;s harsh Brooklyn childhood, the Ralph Kramden sketches became known as &quot;The Honeymooners.&quot; The show was based on Ralph&#x27;s many get-rich-quick schemes, his ambition, his antics with his best friend and neighbor, scatterbrained sewer worker Ed Norton, and clashes with his sensible wife, Alice, who typically pulled Ralph&#x27;s head down from the clouds.

Gleason developed catchphrases he used on &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, such as threats to Alice: &quot;One of these days, Alice, pow! right in the kisser&quot; and &quot;Bang! Zoom! To the Moon, Alice, to the Moon!&quot;

&quot;The Honeymooners&quot; originated from a sketch Gleason was developing with his show&#x27;s writers. He said he had an idea he wanted to enlarge: a skit with a smart, quiet wife and her very vocal husband. He described that while the couple had their fights, underneath it all, they loved each other. Titles for the sketch were tossed around until someone came up with &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;.

&quot;The Honeymooners&quot; first appeared on &quot;Cavalcade of Stars&quot; on October 5, 1951, with Carney in a guest appearance as a cop (Norton did not appear until a few episodes later) and character actress Pert Kelton as Alice. Darker and fiercer than the milder later version with Audrey Meadows as Alice, the sketches proved popular with critics and viewers. In these early episodes with Kelton playing Alice, Gleason&#x27;s frustrated bus driver character had a battleaxe of a wife, and the arguments between them were harrowingly realistic; when Meadows (who was 15 years younger than Kelton) took over the role after Kelton was blacklisted, the tone of the episodes softened considerably.

When Gleason moved to CBS, Kelton was left behind; her name had been published in &quot;Red Channels&quot;, a book that listed and described reputed communists (and communist sympathizers) who worked in television and radio, and CBS did not want to hire her. Gleason reluctantly let her be removed from the cast; the reason was covered up by telling the media that she had &quot;heart trouble&quot;. At first, Gleason turned down Meadows as Kelton&#x27;s replacement. Meadows wrote in her memoir that after her unsuccessful audition, she frumped herself up and slipped back in to audition again to convince Gleason that she could handle the role of a frustrated (but loving) working-class wife. Rounding out the cast, Joyce Randolph played Trixie, Ed Norton&#x27;s wife. Elaine Stritch had played the role of a tall and attractive blonde in the first sketch but was quickly replaced by Randolph. Comedy writer Leonard Stern always felt &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; was more than sketch material and persuaded Gleason to make it into a full-hour-long episode.

In 1955, Gleason gambled on making it a separate series entirely. The result was the &quot;Classic 39&quot; episodes, which finished 19th in the ratings during their only season. They were filmed with a new DuMont process, Electronicam. Like kinescopes, it preserved a live performance on film; unlike kinescopes (which were screenshots), the film was of higher quality and comparable to a motion picture. Using this higher-quality video process turned out to be Gleason&#x27;s most prescient move. A decade later, he aired the half-hour &quot;Honeymooners&quot; in syndicated reruns that began to build a loyal and growing audience, making the show a television icon. Its popularity was such that in 2000, a life-sized statue of Jackie Gleason, in uniform as bus driver Ralph Kramden, was installed outside the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City.

Gleason returned to a live show format for 1956–57, with short and long versions, including hour-long musicals. Ten years later, these musical presentations were reprised in color, with Sheila MacRae and Jane Keane as Alice and Trixie.

Audrey Meadows reappeared for one black-and-white remake of the &#x27;50s sketch &quot;The Adoption,&quot; telecast January 8, 1966. Ten years later, she rejoined Gleason and Carney (with Jane Kean replacing Joyce Randolph) for several TV specials (one special from 1973 was shelved).

&quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; ended in June 1957. In 1959, Gleason discussed the possibility of bringing back &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; in new episodes; his dream was partially realized with a Kramden-Norton sketch on a CBS variety show in late 1960, and two more sketches on his hour-long CBS show &quot;The American Scene Magazine&quot; in 1962.

===Music===

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Gleason enjoyed a prominent secondary music career, producing a series of bestselling &quot;mood music&quot; albums with jazz overtones for Capitol Records. Gleason believed there was a ready market for romantic instrumentals. His goal was to make &quot;musical wallpaper that should never be intrusive, but conducive&quot;. He recalled seeing Clark Gable play love scenes in movies; the romance was, in his words, &quot;magnified a thousand percent&quot; by background music. Gleason reasoned, &quot;If &quot;Gable&quot; needs strings, what about some poor schmuck from Brooklyn?&quot;

Gleason&#x27;s first album, &quot;Music for Lovers Only&quot;, still holds the record for the longest stay on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Ten Charts (153 weeks), and his first ten albums sold over a million copies each. At one point, Gleason held the record for charting the most number-one albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 without charting any hits on the Top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart.

Gleason could not read or write music; he was said to have conceived melodies in his head and described them vocally to assistants who transcribed them into musical notes. These included the well-remembered themes of both &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; (&quot;Melancholy Serenade&quot;) and &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; (&quot;You&#x27;re My Greatest Love&quot;). In spite of period accounts establishing his direct involvement in musical production, varying opinions have appeared over the years as to how much credit Gleason should have received for the finished products. Biographer William A. Henry wrote in his 1992 book, &quot;The Great One: The Life and Legend of Jackie Gleason&quot;, that beyond the possible conceptualizing of many of the song melodies, Gleason had no direct involvement (such as conducting) in making the recordings. Red Nichols, a jazz great who had fallen on hard times and led one of the group&#x27;s recordings, was not paid as session-leader. Cornetist and trumpeter Bobby Hackett soloed on several of Gleason&#x27;s albums and was leader for seven of them. Asked late in life by musician–journalist Harry Currie in Toronto what Gleason really did at the recording sessions, Hackett replied, &quot;He brought the checks&quot;.

But years earlier Hackett had glowingly told writer James Bacon:

Jackie knows a lot more about music than people give him credit for. I have seen him conduct a 60-piece orchestra and detect one discordant note in the brass section. He would immediately stop the music and locate the wrong note. It always amazed the professional musicians how a guy who technically did not know one note from another could do that. And he was never wrong.

The composer and arranger George Williams has been cited in various biographies as having served as ghostwriter for the majority of arrangements heard on many of Gleason&#x27;s albums of the 1950s and 1960s. Williams was not given credit for his work until the early 1960s, albeit only in small print on the backs of album covers.

Gleason&#x27;s lead role in the musical &quot;Take Me Along&quot; (1959–60) won him a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical.

===Return to television===

In 1956 Gleason revived his original variety hour (including &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;), winning a Peabody Award. He abandoned the show in 1957 when his ratings for the season came in at No. 29 and the network &quot;suggested&quot; he needed a break. He returned in 1958 with a half-hour show featuring Buddy Hackett, which did not catch on.

In addition to his salary and royalties, CBS paid for Gleason&#x27;s Peekskill, New York, mansion &quot;Round Rock Hill&quot;. Set on six acres, the architecturally noteworthy complex included a round main home, guest house, and storage building. It took Gleason two years to design the house, which was completed in 1959. Gleason sold the home when he relocated to Miami.

In October 1960, Gleason and Carney briefly returned for a &quot;Honeymooners&quot; sketch on a TV special. His next foray into television was the game show &quot;You&#x27;re in the Picture&quot;, which was canceled after a disastrously received premiere episode but was followed the next week by a broadcast of Gleason&#x27;s humorous half-hour apology, which was much better appreciated. For the rest of its scheduled run, the game show was replaced by a talk show named &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;.

In 1962, Gleason resurrected his variety show with more splashiness and a new hook: a fictitious general-interest magazine called &quot;The American Scene Magazine&quot;, through which Gleason trotted out his old characters in new scenarios, including two new Honeymooners sketches. He also added another catchphrase to the American vernacular, first uttered in the 1963 film &quot;Papa&#x27;s Delicate Condition&quot;: &quot;How sweet it is!&quot; &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show: The American Scene Magazine&quot; was a hit that continued for four seasons. Each show began with Gleason delivering a monolog and commenting on the attention-getting outfits of band leader Sammy Spear. Then the &quot;magazine&quot; features would be trotted out, from Hollywood gossip (reported by comedian Barbara Heller) to news flashes (played for laughs with a stock company of second bananas, chorus girls and dwarfs). Comedienne Alice Ghostley occasionally appeared as a downtrodden tenement resident sitting on her front step and listening to boorish boyfriend Gleason for several minutes. After the boyfriend took his leave, the smitten Ghostley would exclaim, &quot;I&#x27;m the luckiest girl in the world!&quot; Veteran comics Johnny Morgan, Sid Fields, and Hank Ladd were occasionally seen opposite Gleason in comedy sketches. Helen Curtis played alongside him as a singer and actress, delighting audiences with her &#x27;Madame Plumpadore&#x27; sketches with &#x27;Reginald Van Gleason.&#x27;

The final sketch was always set in Joe the Bartender&#x27;s saloon with Joe singing &quot;My Gal Sal&quot; and greeting his regular customer, the unseen Mr. Dennehy (the TV audience, as Gleason spoke to the camera in this section). During the sketch, Joe would tell Dennehy about an article he had read in the fictitious &quot;American Scene&quot; magazine, holding a copy across the bar. It had two covers: one featured the New York skyline and the other palm trees (after the show moved to Florida). Joe would bring out Frank Fontaine as Crazy Guggenheim, who would regale Joe with the latest adventures of his neighborhood pals and sometimes show Joe his current &quot;Top Cat&quot; comic book. Joe usually asked Crazy to sing—almost always a sentimental ballad in his fine, lilting baritone.
Gleason revived &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;—first with Sue Ane Langdon as Alice and Patricia Wilson as Trixie for two episodes of &quot;The American Scene Magazine&quot;, then with Sheila MacRae as Alice and Jane Kean as Trixie for the 1966 series. By 1964 Gleason had moved the production from New York to Miami Beach, Florida, reportedly because he liked year-round access to the golf course at the nearby Inverrary Country Club in Lauderhill (where he built his final home). His closing line became, almost invariably, &quot;As always, the Miami Beach audience is the greatest audience in the world!&quot; In 1966, he abandoned the &quot;American Scene Magazine&quot; format and converted the show into a standard variety hour with guest performers.

Gleason kicked off the 1966–1967 season with new, color episodes of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;. Carney returned as Ed Norton, with MacRae as Alice and Kean as Trixie. The sketches were remakes of the 1957 world-tour episodes, in which Kramden and Norton win a slogan contest and take their wives to international destinations. Each of the nine episodes was a full-scale musical comedy, with Gleason and company performing original songs by Lyn Duddy and Jerry Bresler. Occasionally Gleason would devote the show to musicals with a single theme, such as college comedy or political satire, with the stars abandoning their &quot;Honeymooners&quot; roles for different character roles. This was the show&#x27;s format until its cancellation in 1970. (The exception was the 1968–1969 season, which had no hour-long &quot;Honeymooners&quot; episodes; that season, &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; was presented only in short sketches.) The musicals pushed Gleason back into the top five in ratings, but audiences soon began to decline. By its final season, Gleason&#x27;s show was no longer in the top 25. In the last original &quot;Honeymooners&quot; episode aired on CBS (&quot;Operation Protest&quot; on February 28, 1970), Ralph encounters the youth-protest movement of the late 1960s, a sign of changing times in both television and society.

Gleason (who had signed a deal in the 1950s that included a guaranteed $100,000 annual payment for 20 years, even if he never went on the air) wanted &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; to be just a portion of his format, but CBS wanted another season of only &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;. The network had canceled a mainstay variety show hosted by Red Skelton and would cancel &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in 1971 because they had become too expensive to produce and attracted, in the executives&#x27; opinion, too old an audience. Gleason simply stopped doing the show in 1970 and left CBS when his contract expired.

====&quot;Honeymooners&quot; revival====
Gleason did two &quot;Jackie Gleason Show&quot; specials for CBS after giving up his regular show in the 1970s, including &quot;Honeymooners&quot; segments and a Reginald Van Gleason III sketch in which the gregarious millionaire was portrayed as a comic drunk. When the CBS deal expired, Gleason signed with NBC. He later did a series of &quot;Honeymooners&quot; specials for ABC. Gleason hosted four ABC specials during the mid-1970s. Gleason and Carney also made a television movie, &quot;Izzy and Moe&quot; (1985), about an unusual pair of historic Federal prohibition agents in New York City who achieved an unbeatable arrest record with highly successful techniques including impersonations and humor, which aired on CBS in 1985.

In April 1974, Gleason revived several of his classic characters (including Ralph Kramden, Joe the Bartender and Reginald Van Gleason III) in a television special with Julie Andrews. In a song-and-dance routine, the two performed &quot;Take Me Along&quot; from Gleason&#x27;s Broadway musical.

In 1985, three decades after the &quot;Classic 39&quot; began filming, Gleason revealed he had carefully preserved kinescopes of his live 1950s programs in a vault for future use (including &quot;Honeymooners&quot; sketches with Pert Kelton as Alice). These &quot;lost episodes&quot; (as they came to be called) were initially previewed at the Museum of Television and Radio in New York City, aired on the Showtime cable network in 1985, and later were added to the &quot;Honeymooners&quot; syndication package.
Some of them include earlier versions of plot lines later used in the &#x27;classic 39&#x27; episodes. One (a Christmas episode duplicated several years later with Meadows as Alice) had all Gleason&#x27;s best-known characters (Ralph Kramden, the Poor Soul, Rudy the Repairman, Reginald Van Gleason, Fenwick Babbitt and Joe the Bartender) featured in and outside of the Kramden apartment. The storyline involved a wild Christmas party hosted by Reginald Van Gleason up the block from the Kramdens&#x27; building at Joe the Bartender&#x27;s place.

===Film===

Gleason did not restrict his acting to comedic roles. He had also earned acclaim for live television drama performances in &quot;The Laugh Maker&quot; (1953) on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Studio One&quot; and William Saroyan&#x27;s &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot; (1958), which was produced as an episode of the anthology series &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;.

He was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his portrayal of pool shark Minnesota Fats in &quot;The Hustler&quot; (1961), starring Paul Newman. Gleason made all his own trick pool shots. In his 1985 appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Gleason told Johnny Carson that he had played pool frequently since childhood, and drew from those experiences in &quot;The Hustler&quot;. He was extremely well-received as a beleaguered boxing manager in the film version of Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight&quot; (1962). Gleason played a world-weary army sergeant in &quot;Soldier in the Rain&quot; (1963), in which he received top billing over Steve McQueen.
Gleason wrote, produced and starred in &quot;Gigot&quot; (1962), in which he played a poor, mute janitor who befriended and rescued a prostitute and her small daughter. It was a box office flop. But the film&#x27;s script was adapted and produced as the television film &quot;The Wool Cap&quot; (2004), starring William H. Macy in the role of the mute janitor; the television film received modestly good reviews.

Gleason played the lead in the Otto Preminger-directed &quot;Skidoo&quot; (1968), considered an all-star failure. In 1969 William Friedkin wanted to cast Gleason as &quot;Popeye&quot; Doyle in &quot;The French Connection&quot; (1971), but because of the poor reception of &quot;Gigot&quot; and &quot;Skidoo,&quot; the studio refused to offer Gleason the lead; he wanted it. Instead, Gleason wound up in &quot;How to Commit Marriage&quot; (1969) with Bob Hope, as well as the movie version of Woody Allen&#x27;s play &quot;Don&#x27;t Drink the Water&quot; (1969). Both were unsuccessful.

Eight years passed before Gleason had another hit film. This role was the cantankerous and cursing Texas sheriff Buford T. Justice in the films &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; (1977), &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot; (1980) and &quot;Smokey and the Bandit Part 3&quot; (1983). He co-starred with Burt Reynolds as the Bandit, Sally Field as Carrie (the Bandit&#x27;s love interest), and Jerry Reed as Cledus &quot;Snowman&quot; Snow, the Bandit&#x27;s truck-driving partner. Former NFL linebacker Mike Henry played his dimwitted son, Junior Justice. Gleason&#x27;s gruff and frustrated demeanor and lines such as &quot;I&#x27;m gonna barbecue yo&#x27; ass in molasses!&quot; made the first &quot;Bandit&quot; movie a hit.

Years later, when interviewed by Larry King, Reynolds said he agreed to do the film only if the studio hired Jackie Gleason to play the part of Sheriff Buford T. Justice (the name of a real Florida highway patrolman, who knew Reynolds&#x27; father). Reynolds said that director Hal Needham gave Gleason free rein to ad-lib a great deal of his dialog and make suggestions for the film; the scene at the &quot;Choke and Puke&quot; was Gleason&#x27;s idea. Reynolds and Needham knew Gleason&#x27;s comic talent would help make the film a success, and Gleason&#x27;s characterization of Sheriff Justice strengthened the film&#x27;s appeal to blue-collar audiences.

During the 1980s, Gleason earned positive reviews playing opposite Laurence Olivier in the HBO dramatic two-man special, &quot;Mr. Halpern and Mr. Johnson&quot; (1983). He also gave a memorable performance as wealthy businessman U.S. Bates in the comedy &quot;The Toy&quot; (1982) opposite Richard Pryor. Although the film was critically panned, Gleason and Pryor&#x27;s performances were praised. His last film performance was opposite Tom Hanks in the Garry Marshall-directed &quot;Nothing in Common&quot; (1986), a success both critically and financially.

==Personal life==
===Fear of flying===
For many years, Gleason traveled only by train; his fear of flying arose from an incident in his early film career when he was flying back and forth to Los Angeles for relatively minor film work. During one flight to New York, two of the plane&#x27;s engines stopped, and the pilot executed an emergency landing in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Gleason borrowed $200 from a Tulsa hardware-store owner to purchase a train passage to New York.

===Interest in the paranormal===

Gleason was interested in the paranormal, reading many books on the topic as well as books on parapsychology and UFOs. During the 1950s, he was a semi-regular guest on a paranormal-themed overnight radio show hosted by John Nebel, and he also wrote the introduction to Donald Bain&#x27;s biography of Nebel. After his death, his large book collection was donated to the library of the University of Miami.

According to writer Larry Holcombe, Gleason&#x27;s interest in UFOs prompted President Richard Nixon to share information with him and to disclose some UFO data publicly.

===Marriages and family===

Gleason met dancer Genevieve Halford when they were working in vaudeville and they were married on September 20, 1936. Halford wanted a quiet home life but Gleason led an active nightlife. Separated for the first time in 1941 and reconciled in 1948, the couple had two daughters, Geraldine ( 1940) and Linda (b. 1942). Gleason and his wife informally separated again in 1951. It was during this period that Gleason had a romantic relationship with his secretary Honey Merrill, who had been a showgirl and Miss Hollywood of 1956.

In early 1954, Gleason suffered a broken leg and ankle on-air during his television show. His injuries sidelined him for several weeks. When Halford went to visit Gleason in the hospital, she discovered that Marilyn Taylor, a dancer from his television show, was also visiting him. Halford filed for a legal separation in April 1954. A devout Catholic, Halford did not grant Gleason a divorce until 1970.

Gleason met his second wife, Beverly McKittrick, at a country club in 1968, where she worked as a secretary. Ten days after his divorce from Halford was final, Gleason and McKittrick were married in Ashford, England on July 4, 1970. The couple divorced in 1975. Gleason reconnected with Taylor and married her in December 1975. They remained married until he died in 1987.

Gleason&#x27;s daughter Linda became an actress and married actor-playwright Jason Miller. Their son is actor Jason Patric.

===Later years, health problems and death===
As early as 1952, when &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; captured Saturday night for CBS, Gleason regularly smoked six packs of cigarettes a day.

Gleason struggled with weight issues throughout much of his life, often weighing close to 300 pounds. His diet primarily consisted of red meat and rich desserts, with little to no vegetables. Additionally, Gleason did not engage in regular exercise and consumed alcohol excessively.

In &quot;The Golden Ham: A Candid Biography of Jackie Gleason&quot;, author Jim Bishop notes that Gleason had three separate wardrobes to accommodate his fluctuating weight, which varied between 185 and 285 pounds.

In 1978, he suffered chest pains while touring in the lead role of Larry Gelbart&#x27;s play &quot;Sly Fox&quot; and later underwent triple-bypass surgery.

Gleason delivered a critically acclaimed performance as an infirm, acerbic, and somewhat Archie Bunker-like character in the Tom Hanks comedy-drama &quot;Nothing in Common&quot; (1986), Gleason&#x27;s final film role. During production, he was diagnosed with colon cancer, which had metastasized to his liver. He was also suffering from phlebitis and diabetes. He kept his medical problems private, although there were rumors that he was seriously ill. On June 24, 1987, he died at age 71 in his Florida home.

After a funeral Mass at the Cathedral of Saint Mary, Gleason was entombed in a sarcophagus in a private outdoor mausoleum at Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Cemetery in Miami. Gleason&#x27;s sister-in-law June Taylor is buried to the left of the mausoleum, next to her husband and attorney, Sol Lerner.

Lynde immediately turned his award over to host Jackie Gleason, citing him as &quot;the funniest man ever.&quot; The unexpected gesture shocked Gleason.
* On June 30, 1988, the Sunset Park MTA, NYCT&#x27;s 5th Avenue Bus Depot in Brooklyn was renamed the Jackie Gleason Depot in honor of the native Brooklynite.
* A statue of Gleason as Ralph Kramden in his bus driver&#x27;s uniform was dedicated in August 2000 in New York City in Manhattan at the 40th Street entrance of the Port Authority Bus Terminal (PABT). The statue was briefly shown in the film &quot;World Trade Center&quot; (2006).
* A city park in Lauderhill, Florida, was named the &quot;Jackie Gleason Park&quot; in his honor; it is located near his former home and features racquetball and basketball courts and a children&#x27;s playground.
* Signs on the Brooklyn Bridge which advise drivers that they are entering Brooklyn have the Gleason phrase &quot;How Sweet It Is!&quot;
* Late in his life actor-playwright Jason Miller, Gleason&#x27;s former son-in-law, was writing a screenplay based on Gleason&#x27;s life. He died before it was completed.
* Gleason was portrayed by Brad Garrett in a 2002 television biopic about his life.

<text>Astrophotography, also known as astronomical imaging, is the photography or imaging of astronomical objects, celestial events, or areas of the night sky. The first photograph of an astronomical object (the Moon) was taken in 1839, but it was not until the late 19th century that advances in technology allowed for detailed stellar photography. Besides being able to record the details of extended objects such as the Moon, Sun, and planets, modern astrophotography has the ability to image objects outside of the visible spectrum of the human eye such as dim stars, nebulae, and galaxies. This is accomplished through long time exposure as both film and digital cameras can accumulate and sum photons over long periods of time or using specialized optical filters which limit the photons to a certain wavelength.

Photography using extended exposure-times revolutionized the field of professional astronomical research, recording hundreds of thousands of new stars, and nebulae invisible to the human eye. Specialized and ever-larger optical telescopes were constructed as essentially big cameras to record images on photographic plates. Astrophotography had an early role in sky surveys and star classification but over time it has used ever more sophisticated image sensors and other equipment and techniques designed for specific fields.

Since almost all observational astronomy today uses photography, the term &quot;astrophotography&quot; usually refers to its use in amateur astronomy, seeking aesthetically pleasing images rather than scientific data. Amateurs use a wide range of special equipment and techniques.

== Methods ==
With a few exceptions, astronomical photography employs long exposures since both film and digital imaging devices can accumulate light photons over long periods of time. The amount of light hitting the film or detector is also increased by increasing the diameter of the primary optics (the objective) being used. Urban areas produce light pollution so equipment and observatories doing astronomical imaging are often located in remote locations to allow long exposures without the film or detectors being swamped with stray light.

Since the Earth is constantly rotating, telescopes and equipment are rotated in the opposite direction to follow the apparent motion of the stars overhead (called diurnal motion). This is accomplished by using either equatorial or computer-controlled altazimuth telescope mounts to keep celestial objects centered while Earth rotates. All telescope mount systems suffer from induced tracking errors due to imperfect motor drives, the mechanical sag of the telescope, and atmospheric refraction. Tracking errors are corrected by keeping a selected aiming point, usually a &quot;guide star&quot;, centered during the entire exposure. Sometimes (as in the case of comets) the object to be imaged is moving, so the telescope has to be kept constantly centered on that object. This guiding is done through a second co-mounted telescope called a &quot;&quot;guide scope&quot; or via some type of &quot;off-axis guider&quot;&quot;, a device with a prism or optical beam splitter that allows the observer to view the same image in the telescope that is taking the picture. Guiding was formerly done manually throughout the exposure with an observer standing at (or riding inside) the telescope making corrections to keep a cross hair on the guide star. Since the advent of computer-controlled systems, this is accomplished by an automated system in professional and even amateur equipment.

Astronomical photography was one of the earliest types of scientific photography and almost from its inception it diversified into subdisciplines that each have a specific goal including star cartography, astrometry, stellar classification, photometry, spectroscopy, polarimetry, and the discovery of astronomical objects such as asteroids, meteors, comets, variable stars, novae, and even unknown planets. These often require specialized equipment such as telescopes designed for precise imaging, for wide field of view (such as Schmidt cameras), or for work at specific wavelengths of light. Astronomical CCD cameras may cool the sensor to reduce thermal noise and to allow the detector to record images in other spectra such as in infrared astronomy. Specialized filters are also used to record images in specific wavelengths.

==History==

The development of astrophotography as a scientific tool was pioneered in the mid-19th century for the most part by experimenters and amateur astronomers, or so-called &quot;gentleman scientists&quot; (although, as in other scientific fields, these were not always men). Because of the very long exposures needed to capture relatively faint astronomical objects, many technological problems had to be overcome. These included making telescopes rigid enough so they would not sag out of focus during the exposure, building clock drives that could rotate the telescope mount at a constant rate, and developing ways to accurately keep a telescope aimed at a fixed point over a long period of time. Early photographic processes also had limitations. The daguerreotype process was far too slow to record anything but the brightest objects, and the wet plate collodion process limited exposures to the time the plate could stay wet.
The first known attempt at astronomical photography was by Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre, inventor of the daguerreotype process which bears his name, who attempted in 1839 to photograph the Moon. Tracking errors in guiding the telescope during the long exposure meant the photograph came out as an indistinct fuzzy spot. John William Draper, New York University Professor of Chemistry, physician and scientific experimenter managed to make the first successful photograph of the Moon a year later on March 23, 1840, taking a 20-minute-long daguerreotype image using a reflecting telescope.

The Sun may have been first photographed in an 1845 daguerreotype by the French physicists Léon Foucault and Hippolyte Fizeau. A failed attempt to obtain a photograph of a Total Eclipse of the Sun was made by the Italian physicist, Gian Alessandro Majocchi during an eclipse of the Sun that took place in his home city of Milan, on July 8, 1842. He later gave an account of his attempt and the Daguerreotype photographs he obtained, in which he wrote:

The Sun&#x27;s solar corona was first successfully imaged during the Solar eclipse of July 28, 1851. Dr. August Ludwig Busch, the Director of the Königsberg Observatory gave instructions for a local daguerreotypist named Johann Julius Friedrich Berkowski to image the eclipse. Busch himself was not present at Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia), but preferred to observe the eclipse from nearby Rixhoft. The telescope used by Berkowski was attached to Königsberg heliometer and had an aperture of only , and a focal length of . Commencing immediately after the beginning of totality, Berkowski exposed a daguerreotype plate for 84 seconds in the focus of the telescope, and on developing an image of the corona was obtained. He also exposed a second plate for about 40 to 45 seconds but was spoiled when the Sun broke out from behind the Moon. More detailed photographic studies of the Sun were made by the British astronomer Warren De la Rue starting in 1861.

The first photograph of a star other than the Sun was a daguerreotype of the star Vega by astronomer William Cranch Bond and daguerreotype photographer and experimenter John Adams Whipple, on July 16 and 17, 1850 with Harvard College Observatory&#x27;s 15 inch Great refractor. In 1863 the English chemist William Allen Miller and English amateur astronomer Sir William Huggins used the wet collodion plate process to obtain the first ever photographic spectrogram of a star, Sirius and Capella. In 1872 American physician Henry Draper, the son of John William Draper, recorded the first spectrogram of a star (Vega) to show absorption lines.
Astronomical photography did not become a serious research tool until the late 19th century, with the introduction of dry plate photography. It was first used by Sir William Huggins and his wife Margaret Lindsay Huggins, in 1876, in their work to record the spectra of astronomical objects. In 1880, Henry Draper used the new dry plate process with photographically corrected refracting telescope made by Alvan Clark to make a 51-minute exposure of the Orion Nebula, the first photograph of a nebula ever made. A breakthrough in astronomical photography came in 1883, when amateur astronomer Andrew Ainslie Common used the dry plate process to record several images of the same nebula in exposures up to 60 minutes with a reflecting telescope that he constructed in the backyard of his home in Ealing, outside London. These images for the first time showed stars too faint to be seen by the human eye.
The first all-sky photographic astrometry project, Astrographic Catalogue and Carte du Ciel, was started in 1887. It was conducted by 20 observatories all using special photographic telescopes with a uniform design called &quot;normal astrographs&quot;, all with an aperture of around and a focal length of , designed to create images with a uniform scale on the photographic plate of approximately 60 arcsecs/mm while covering a 2° × 2° field of view. The attempt was to accurately map the sky down to the 14th magnitude but it was never completed.

The beginning of the 20th century saw the worldwide construction of refracting telescopes and sophisticated large reflecting telescopes specifically designed for photographic imaging. Towards the middle of the century, giant telescopes such as the Hale Telescope and the Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar Observatory were pushing the limits of film photography.

Some progress was made in the field of photographic emulsions and in the techniques of forming gas hypersensitization, cryogenic cooling, and light amplification, but starting in the 1970s after the invention of the CCD, photographic plates were gradually replaced by electronic imaging in professional and amateur observatories. CCD&#x27;s are far more light sensitive, do not drop off in sensitivity over long exposures the way film does (&quot;reciprocity failure&quot;), have the ability to record in a much wider spectral range, and simplify storage of information. Telescopes now use many configurations of CCD sensors including linear arrays and large mosaics of CCD elements equivalent to 100 million pixels, designed to cover the focal plane of telescopes that formerly used photographic plates.

The late 20th century saw advances in astronomical imaging take place in the form of new hardware, with the construction of giant multi-mirror and segmented mirror telescopes. It would also see the introduction of space-based telescopes, such as the Hubble Space Telescope. Operating outside the atmosphere&#x27;s turbulence, scattered ambient light and the vagaries of weather allows the Hubble Space Telescope, with a mirror diameter of , to record stars down to the 30th magnitude, some 100 times dimmer than what the 5-meter Mount Palomar Hale Telescope could record in 1949.

==Amateur astrophotography==

Astrophotography is a popular hobby among photographers and amateur astronomers. Techniques ranges from basic film and digital cameras on tripods up to methods and equipment geared toward advanced imaging. Amateur astronomers and amateur telescope makers also use homemade equipment and modified devices.

=== Media ===
Images are recorded on many types of media and imaging devices including single-lens reflex cameras, 35 mm film, 120 film, digital single-lens reflex cameras, simple amateur-level, and professional-level commercially manufactured astronomical CCD and CMOS cameras, video cameras, and even off-the-shelf webcams used for Lucky imaging.

The conventional over-the-counter film has long been used for astrophotography. Film exposures range from seconds to over an hour. Commercially available color film stock is subject to reciprocity failure over long exposures, in which sensitivity to light of different wavelengths appears to drop off at different rates as the exposure time increases, leading to a color shift in the image and reduced sensitivity over all as a function of time. This is compensated for, or at least reduced, by cooling the film (see Cold camera photography). This can also be compensated for by using the same technique used in professional astronomy of taking photographs at different wavelengths that are then combined to create a correct color image. Since the film is much slower than digital sensors, tiny errors in tracking can be corrected without much noticeable effect on the final image. Film astrophotography is becoming less popular due to the lower ongoing costs, greater sensitivity, and the convenience of digital photography.

Since the late 1990s amateurs have been following the professional observatories in the switch from film to digital CCDs for astronomical imaging. CCDs are more sensitive than film, allowing much shorter exposure times, and have a linear response to light. Images can be captured in many short exposures to create a synthetic long exposure. Digital cameras also have minimal or no moving parts and the ability to be operated remotely via an infrared remote or computer tethering, limiting vibration. Simple digital devices such as webcams can be modified to allow access to the focal plane and even (after the cutting of a few wires), for long exposure photography. Digital video cameras are also used. There are many techniques and pieces of commercially manufactured equipment for attaching digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras and even basic point and shoot cameras to telescopes. Consumer-level digital cameras suffer from image noise over long exposures, so there are many techniques for cooling the camera, including cryogenic cooling. Astronomical equipment companies also now offer a wide range of purpose-built astronomical CCD cameras complete with hardware and processing software. Many commercially available DSLR cameras have the ability to take long time exposures combined with sequential (time-lapse) images allowing the photographer to create a motion picture of the night sky. CMOS cameras are increasingly replacing CCD cameras in the amateur sector. Modern CMOS sensors offer higher quantum efficiency, lower thermal and read noise and faster readout speeds than commercially available CCD sensors.

====Post-processing====
Both digital camera images and scanned film images are usually adjusted in image processing software to improve the image in some way. Images can be brightened and manipulated in a computer to adjust color and increase the contrast. More sophisticated techniques involve capturing multiple images (sometimes thousands) to composite together in an additive process to sharpen images to overcome atmospheric seeing, negating tracking issues, bringing out faint objects with a poor signal-to-noise ratio, and filtering out light pollution. 

Digital camera images may also need further processing to reduce the image noise from long exposures, including subtracting a “dark frame” and a processing called &quot;image stacking&quot; or &quot;Shift-and-add&quot;. Commercial, freeware and free software packages are available specifically for astronomical photographic image manipulation.

&quot;Lucky imaging&quot; is a secondary technique that involves taking a video of an object rather than standard long exposure photos. Software can then select the highest quality images which can then be stacked. 

==== Color and brightness ====
Astronomical pictures, like observational astronomy and photography from space exploration, show astronomical objects and phenomena in different colors and brightness, and often as composite images. This is done to highlight different features or reflect different conditions, and makes the note of these conditions necessary.

Images attempting to reproduce the true color and appearance of an astronomical object or phenomenon need to consider many factors, including how the human eye works. Particularly under different atmospheric conditions images need to evaluate several factors to produce analyzable or representative images, like images of space missions from the surface of Mars, Venus or Titan.
===Hardware===
Astrophotographic hardware among non-professional astronomers varies widely since the photographers themselves range from general photographers shooting some form of aesthetically pleasing images to very serious amateur astronomers collecting data for scientific research. As a hobby, astrophotography has many challenges that have to be overcome that differ from conventional photography and from what is normally encountered in professional astronomy.
Since most people live in urban areas, equipment often needs to be portable so that it can be taken far away from the lights of major cities or towns to avoid urban light pollution. Urban astrophotographers may use special light-pollution or narrow-band filters and advanced computer processing techniques to reduce ambient urban light in the background of their images. They may also stick to imaging bright targets like the Sun, Moon and planets. Another method used by amateurs to avoid light pollution is to set up, or rent time, on a remotely operated telescope at a dark sky location. Other challenges include setup and alignment of portable telescopes for accurate tracking, working within the limitations of “off the shelf” equipment, the endurance of monitoring equipment, and sometimes manually tracking astronomical objects over long exposures in a wide range of weather conditions.

Some camera manufacturers modify their products to be used as astrophotography cameras, such as Canon&#x27;s EOS 60Da, based on the EOS 60D but with a modified infrared filter and a low-noise sensor with heightened hydrogen-alpha sensitivity for improved capture of red hydrogen emission nebulae.

There are also cameras specifically designed for amateur astrophotography based on commercially available imaging sensors. They may also allow the sensor to be cooled to reduce thermal noise in long exposures, provide raw image readout, and to be controlled from a computer for automated imaging. Raw image readout allows later better image processing by retaining all the original image data which along with stacking can assist in imaging faint deep sky objects.

With very low light capability, a few specific models of webcams are popular for solar, lunar, and planetary imaging. Mostly, these are manually focused cameras containing a CCD sensor instead of the more common CMOS. The lenses of these cameras are removed and then these are attached to telescopes to record images, videos, or both. In newer techniques, videos of very faint objects are taken and the sharpest frames of the video are &#x27;stacked&#x27; together to obtain a still image of respectable contrast. The Philips PCVC 740K and SPC 900 are among the few webcams liked by astrophotographers. Any smartphone that allows long exposures can be used for this purpose, but some phones have a specific mode for astrophotography that will stitch together multiple exposures.

====Equipment setups====
;Fixed or tripod
The most basic types of astronomical photographs are made with standard cameras and photographic lenses mounted in a fixed position or on a tripod. Foreground objects or landscapes are sometimes composed in the shot. Objects imaged are constellations, interesting planetary configurations, meteors, and bright comets. Exposure times must be short (under a minute) to avoid having the stars point image become an elongated line due to the Earth&#x27;s rotation. Camera lens focal lengths are usually short, as longer lenses will show image trailing in a matter of seconds. A rule of thumb called the &quot;500 rule&quot; states that, to keep stars point-like,
:Maximum exposure time in seconds = 
regardless of aperture or ISO setting. For example, with a 35 mm lens on an APS-C sensor, the maximum time is ≈ 9.5 s. A more accurate calculation takes into account pixel pitch and declination.

Allowing the stars to intentionally become elongated lines in exposures lasting several minutes or even hours, called “star trails”, is an artistic technique sometimes used.

; Tracking mounts

Telescope mounts that compensate for the Earth&#x27;s rotation are used for longer exposures without objects being blurred. They include commercial equatorial mounts and homemade equatorial devices such as barn door trackers and equatorial platforms. Mounts can suffer from inaccuracies due to backlash in the gears, wind, and imperfect balance, and so a technique called auto guiding is used as a closed feedback system to correct for these inaccuracies.

Tracking mounts can come in two forms; single axis and dual axis. Single axis mounts are often known as star trackers. Star trackers have a single motor which drives the right ascension axis. This allows the mount to compensate for the Earth&#x27;s rotation. Star trackers rely on the user ensuring the mount is polar aligned with high accuracy, as it is unable correct in the secondary declination axis, limiting exposure times. 

Dual axis mounts use two motors to drive both the right ascension and the declination axis together. This mount will compensate for the Earth&#x27;s rotation by driving the right ascension axis, similar to a star tracker. However using an auto-guiding system, the secondary declination axis can also be driven, compensating for errors in polar alignment, allowing for significantly longer exposure times.

; &quot;Piggyback&quot; photography
Piggyback astronomical photography is a method where a camera/lens is mounted on an equatorially mounted astronomical telescope. The telescope is used as a guide scope to keep the field of view centered during the exposure. This allows the camera to use a longer exposure and/or a longer focal length lens or even be attached to some form of photographic telescope co-axial with the main telescope.

; Telescope focal plane photography
In this type of photography, the telescope itself is used as the &quot;lens&quot; collecting light for the film or CCD of the camera. Although this allows for the magnification and light-gathering power of the telescope to be used, it is one of the most difficult astrophotography methods. This is because of the difficulties in centering and focusing sometimes very dim objects in the narrow field of view, contending with magnified vibration and tracking errors, and the added expense of equipment (such as sufficiently sturdy telescope mounts, camera mounts, camera couplers, off-axis guiders, guide scopes, illuminated cross-hairs, or auto-guiders mounted on primary telescope or the guide-scope.) There are several different ways cameras (with removable lenses) are attached to amateur astronomical telescopes including:
* Prime focus – In this method the image produced by the telescope falls directly on the film or CCD with no intervening optics or telescope eyepiece.
* Positive projection – A method in which the telescope eyepiece (&quot;eyepiece projection&quot;) or a positive lens (placed after the focal plane of the telescope objective) is used to project a much more magnified image directly onto the film or CCD. Since the image is magnified with a narrow field of view this method is generally used for lunar and planetary photography.
* Negative projection – This method, like positive projection, produces a magnified image. A negative lens, usually a Barlow or a photographic teleconverter, is placed in the light cone before the focal plane of the telescope objective.
* Compression – Compression uses a positive lens (also called a &quot;focal reducer&quot;), placed in the converging cone of light before the focal plane of the telescope objective, to reduce overall image magnification. It is used on very long focal length telescopes, such as Maksutovs and Schmidt–Cassegrains, to obtain a wider field of view, or to reduce the focal ratio of the setup thereby increasing the speed of the system.
When the camera lens is not removed (or cannot be removed) a common method used is afocal photography, also called &quot;afocal projection&quot;. In this method, both the camera lens and the telescope eyepiece are attached. When both are focused at infinity the light path between them is parallel (afocal), allowing the camera to basically photograph anything the observer can see. This method works well for capturing images of the moon and brighter planets, as well as narrow field images of stars and nebulae. Afocal photography was common with early 20th-century consumer-level cameras since many models had non-removable lenses. It has grown in popularity with the introduction of point and shoot digital cameras since most models also have non-removable lenses.

==== Filters ====

: Filters can be categorised into two classes; broadband and narrowband. Broadband filters allow a wide range of wavelengths to pass through, removing small amounts of light pollution. Narrowband filters only allow light from very specific wavelengths to pass through, blocking out the vast majority of the spectrum.
: Astronomical filters usually come as sets and are manufactured to specific standards, in order to allow different observatories to make observations at the same standard. A common filter standard in the astronomy community is the Johnson Morgan UVB, designed to match a CCD’s color response to that of photographic film. However there are over 200 standards available.

; Remote Telescope

Fast Internet access in the last part of the 20th century, and advances in computer-controlled telescope mounts and CCD cameras, allows use of &#x27;Remote Telescopes&#x27; for amateur astronomers not aligned with major telescope facilities to partake in research and deep-sky imaging. This enables the imager to control a telescope far away in a dark location. The observers can image through the telescopes using CCD cameras.

Imaging can be done regardless of the location of the user or the telescopes they wish to use. The digital data collected by the telescope is then transmitted and displayed to the user by means of the Internet. An example of a digital remote telescope operation for public use via the Internet is The Bareket Observatory.

<text>Gujarati ( ; , ) is an Indo-Aryan language native to the Indian state of Gujarat and spoken predominantly by the Gujarati people. Gujarati is descended from Old Gujarati (). In India, it is one of the 22 scheduled languages of the Union. It is also the official language in the state of Gujarat, as well as an official language in the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu. As of 2011, Gujarati is the 6th most widely spoken language in India by number of native speakers, spoken by 55.5 million speakers which amounts to about 4.5% of the total Indian population. It is the 26th most widely spoken language in the world by number of native speakers as of 2007.

Gujarati, along with Meitei (alias Manipuri), hold the third place among the fastest growing languages of India, following Hindi (first place) and Kashmiri language (second place), according to the 2011 census of India.

Outside of Gujarat, Gujarati is spoken in many other parts of South Asia by Gujarati migrants, especially in Mumbai and Pakistan (mainly in Karachi). Gujarati is also widely spoken in many countries outside South Asia by the Gujarati diaspora. In North America, Gujarati is one of the fastest-growing and most widely spoken Indian languages in the United States and Canada. In Europe, Gujaratis form the second largest of the British South Asian speech communities, and Gujarati is the fourth most commonly spoken language in the UK&#x27;s capital London. Gujarati is also spoken in Southeast Africa, particularly in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and South Africa. Elsewhere, Gujarati is spoken to a lesser extent in Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, and Middle Eastern countries such as Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.

==History==

Gujarati (sometimes spelled &quot;Gujerati&quot;, &quot;Gujarathi&quot;, &quot;Guzratee&quot;, &quot;Guujaratee&quot;, &quot;Gujrathi&quot;, and &quot;Gujerathi&quot;) is a modern Indo-Aryan (IA) language evolved from Sanskrit. The traditional practice is to differentiate the IA languages on the basis of three historical stages:
#Old IA (Vedic and Classical Sanskrit)
#Middle IA (various Prakrits and Apabhramshas)
#New IA (modern languages such as Hindi, Punjabi, Bengali, etc.)
Another view postulates successive family tree splits, in which Gujarati is assumed to have separated from other IA languages in four stages:
#IA languages split into Northern, Eastern, and Western divisions based on the innovate characteristics such as plosives becoming voiced in the Northern (Skt. &quot;danta&quot; &quot;tooth&quot; &gt; Punj. &quot;dānd&quot;) and dental and retroflex sibilants merging with the palatal in the Eastern (Skt. &quot;sandhya&quot; &quot;evening&quot; &gt; Beng. &quot;śājh&quot;).
#Western, into Central and Southern.
#Central, in Gujarati/Rajasthani, Western Hindi, and Punjabi/Lahanda/Sindhi, on the basis of innovation of auxiliary verbs and postpositions in Gujarati/Rajasthani.
#Gujarati/Rajasthani into Gujarati and Rajasthani through development of such characteristics as auxiliary &quot;ch&quot;- and the possessive marker -&quot;n&quot;- during the 15th century.

The principal changes from the Middle Indo-Aryan stage are the following:

=== Phonological changes ===

==== Changes in common with other New Indo-Aryan languages ====
*Reduction of geminates to single consonants with lengthening of previous vowel (sometimes with spontaneous nasalization) (#NIA-1/2)
*Loss of final vowels (#NIA-3)
*Lengthening of vowel in -VNC- sequences and consequent nasalization (#NIA-4)
*Loss of unaccented vowels in non-final positions common (#NIA-5)
*Vowels in direct succession coalesce into long vowels or form diphthongs (#NIA-6)
**Coalescence of vowels of like quality (#NIA-6a)
**With unlike vowels, the first vowel is generally dominant (#NIA-6b)
**aï and aü eventually become ε and ɔ (#NIA-6b-3)
*Retroflextion of lateral approximent: &quot;-l-&quot; &gt; &quot;-ḷ-&quot; (#SD-1c)
*Exception to #NIA-1 when a long vowel follows the geminate and the word is longer than two syllables (#SD-2)
=== Morphology and Syntax ===
*Morphological
**Reduction in the number of compounds
**Merger of the dual with plural
**Replacement of case affixes by postpositions
**Development of periphrastic tense/voice/mood constructions
*Syntax
**Split ergativity
**More complex agreement system
Gujarati is then customarily divided into the following three historical stages:

===Old Gujarati===
Old Gujarātī (; 1200 CE–1500 CE), which descended from prakrit and the ancestor of modern Gujarati and Rajasthani, was spoken by the Gurjars, who were residing and ruling in Gujarat, Punjab, Rajputana, and central India. The language was used as literary language as early as the 12th century. Texts of this era display characteristic Gujarati features such as direct/oblique noun forms, postpositions, and auxiliary verbs. It had three genders, as Gujarati does today, and by around the time of 1300 CE, a fairly standardized form of this language emerged. While generally known as Old Gujarati, some scholars prefer the name Old Western Rajasthani, based upon the argument that Gujarati and Rajasthani were not yet distinct. Factoring into this preference was the belief that modern Rajasthani sporadically expressed a neuter gender, based on the incorrect conclusion that the [ũ] that came to be pronounced in some areas for masculine [o] after a nasal consonant was analogous to Gujarati&#x27;s neuter [ũ]. A formal grammar, &quot;Prakrita Vyakarana&quot;, of the precursor to this language, Gurjar Apabhraṃśa, was written by Jain monk and eminent scholar Acharya Hemachandra Suri in the reign of Chaulukya king Jayasimha Siddharaja of Anhilwara (Patan).

=== Middle Gujarati ===
MIddle Gujarati (AD 1500–1800) split off from Rajasthani, and developed the phonemes ɛ and ɔ, the auxiliary stem &quot;ch&quot;-, and the possessive marker -&quot;n&quot;-. Major phonological changes characteristic of the transition between Old and Middle Gujarati are:

* i, u develop to ə in open syllables
* diphthongs əi, əu change to ɛ and ɔ in initial syllables and to e and o elsewhere
* əũ develops to ɔ̃ in initial syllables and to ű in final syllables

These developments would have grammatical consequences. For example, Old Gujarati&#x27;s instrumental-locative singular in -i was leveled and eliminated, having become the same as Old Gujarati&#x27;s nominative/accusative singular in -ə.

===Modern Gujarati (1800–present)===

A major phonological change was the deletion of final &quot;ə&quot;, such that the modern language has consonant-final words. Grammatically, a new plural marker of -&quot;o&quot; developed. In literature, the third quarter of the 19th century saw a series of milestones for Gujarati, which previously had verse as its dominant mode of literary composition. In 1920s, the efforts to standardise Gujarati were carried out.

== Demographics and distribution ==

Of the approximately million speakers of Gujarati in 2022, roughly million resided in India, 250,000 in Tanzania, in Kenya, and some thousands in Pakistan. Many Gujarati speakers in Pakistan are shifting to Urdu; however, some Gujarati community leaders in Pakistan claim that there are 3 million Gujarati speakers in Karachi.

Mahatma Gandhi used Gujarati to serve as a medium of literary expression. He helped to inspire a renewal in its literature, and in 1936 he introduced the current spelling convention at the Gujarati Literary Society&#x27;s 12th meeting.

Some Mauritians and many Réunion islanders are of Gujarati descent and some of them still speak Gujarati.

A considerable Gujarati-speaking population exists in North America, especially in the New York City Metropolitan Area and in the Greater Toronto Area, which have over 100,000 speakers and over 75,000 speakers, respectively, but also throughout the major metropolitan areas of the United States and Canada. According to the 2016 census, Gujarati is the fourth most-spoken South Asian language in Toronto after Hindustani, Punjabi and Tamil.

The UK has over 200,000 speakers, many of them situated in the London area, especially in North West London (in Harrow and Wembley), but also in Birmingham, Manchester, and in Leicester, Coventry, Rugby, Bradford and the former mill towns within Lancashire. A portion of these numbers consists of East African Gujaratis who, under increasing discrimination and policies of Africanisation in their newly independent resident countries (especially Uganda, where Idi Amin expelled 50,000 Asians), were left with uncertain futures and citizenships. Most, with British passports, settled in the UK. Gujarati is offered as a GCSE subject for students in the UK.

Some Gujarati parents in the diaspora are not comfortable with the possibility that their children will not be fluent in the language. In a study, 80% of Malayali parents felt that &quot;Children would be better off with English&quot;, compared to 36% of Kannada parents and only 19% of Gujarati parents.

Besides being spoken by the Gujarati people, many non-Gujarati residents of Gujarat also speak it, among them the Kutchis (as a literary language and the Parsis (adopted as a mother tongue).

=== Official status ===
Gujarati is one of the twenty-two official languages and fourteen regional languages of India. It is officially recognised in the state of Gujarat and the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.

Gujarati is recognised and taught as a minority language in the states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu and the union territory of Delhi.
== Dialects ==
According to British historian and philologist William Tisdall, who was an early scholar of Gujarati grammar, three major varieties of Gujarati exist: a standard &#x27;Hindu&#x27; dialect, a &#x27;Parsi&#x27; dialect and a &#x27;Muslim&#x27; dialect.

However, Gujarati has undergone contemporary reclassification with respect to the widespread regional differences in vocabulary and phrasing; notwithstanding the number of poorly attested dialects and regional variations in naming.

* Standard Gujarati: this forms something of a standardised variant of Gujarati across news, education and government. It is also spoken in pockets of Maharashtra. The varieties of it include Mumbai Gujarati, Nagari.
*Saurashtra: spoken primarily by the Saurashtrians who migrated from the Lata region of present-day Gujarat to Southern India in the Middle Ages. Saurashtra is closely related to Gujarati and the older dialects of Rajasthani and Sindhi. The script of this language is derived from the Devanagari script and shares similarities with modern-day Gujarati.
* Amdawadi Gujarati: spoken primarily in Ahmedabad and the surrounding regions, in addition to Bharuch and Surat, where it is colloquially known as &#x27;Surati&#x27;. The varieties of it include Ahmedabad Gamadia, Anawla, Brathela, Charotari, Eastern Broach Gujarati, Gramya, Patani, Patidari, Surati, Vadodari.
* Kathiawari: a distinctive variant spoken primarily in the Kathiawar region and subject to significant Sindhi influence. The varieties of it include Bhavnagari, Gohilwadi, Holadi/Halari, Jhalawadi, Sorathi.

Kharwa, Kakari and Tarimuki (Ghisadi) are also often cited as additional varieties of Gujarati.

* Parsi: spoken by the Zoroastrian Parsi minority. This highly distinctive variety has been subject to considerable lexical influence by Avestan, the liturgical Zoroastrian language.
* Lisan ud-Dawat: spoken primarily by Gujarati Muslim Bohra communities, it has been subject to greater lexical influence by Arabic and Persian and is written in the Arabic script.

Kutchi is often referred to as a dialect of Gujarati, but most linguists consider it closer to Sindhi. In addition, the Memoni is related to Gujarati, albeit distantly.

Furthermore, words used by the native languages of areas where the Gujarati people have become a diaspora community, such as East Africa (Swahili), have become loanwords in local dialects of Gujarati.

The Linguistic Survey of India noted nearly two dozen dialects of Gujarati: Standard, Old, Standard Ahmedabad, Standard Broach, Nāgarī, Bombay, Suratī, Anāvla or Bhāṭelā, Eastern Broach, Pārsī, Carotarī, Pāṭīdārī, Vaḍodarī, Gāmaḍiā of Ahmedabad, Paṭanī, Thar and Parkar, Cutch, Kāṭhiyāvāḍī, Musalmān (Vhorāsī and Kharwā), Paṭṇulī, Kākarī, and Tārīmukī or Ghisāḍī.

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
===Consonants===
== Writing system ==

Similar to other Nāgarī writing systems, the Gujarati script is an abugida. It is used to write the Gujarati and Kutchi languages. It is a variant of the Devanāgarī script, differentiated by the loss of the characteristic horizontal line running above the letters and by a small number of modifications in the remaining characters.

==Vocabulary==

===Categorisation and sources===
These are the three general categories of words in modern Indo-Aryan: &quot;tadbhav&quot;, &quot;tatsam&quot;, and loanwords.

====Tadbhav====
 &quot;tadbhava&quot;, &quot;of the nature of that&quot;. Gujarati is a modern Indo-Aryan language descended from Sanskrit (old Indo-Aryan), and this category pertains exactly to that: words of Sanskritic origin that have demonstratively undergone change over the ages, ending up characteristic of modern Indo-Aryan languages specifically as well as in general. Thus the &quot;that&quot; in &quot;of the nature of that&quot; refers to Sanskrit. They tend to be non-technical, everyday, crucial words; part of the spoken vernacular. Below is a table of a few Gujarati &quot;tadbhav&quot; words and their Old Indo-Aryan sources:

====Tatsam====
 &quot;tatsama&quot;, &quot;same as that&quot;. While Sanskrit eventually stopped being spoken vernacularly, in that it changed into Middle Indo-Aryan, it was nonetheless standardised and retained as a literary and liturgical language for long after. This category consists of these borrowed words of (more or less) pure Sanskrit character. They serve to enrich Gujarati and modern Indo-Aryan in its formal, technical, and religious vocabulary. They are recognisable by their Sanskrit inflections and markings; they are thus often treated as a separate grammatical category unto themselves.

Many old tatsam words have changed their meanings or have had their meanings adopted for modern times. પ્રસારણ &quot;prasāraṇ&quot; means &quot;spreading&quot;, but now it is used for &quot;broadcasting&quot;. In addition to this are neologisms, often being calques. An example is &quot;telephone&quot;, which is Greek for &quot;far talk&quot;, translated as દુરભાષ &quot;durbhāṣ&quot;. Most people, though, just use ફોન &quot;phon&quot; and thus neo-Sanskrit has varying degrees of acceptance.

So, while having unique &quot;tadbhav&quot; sets, modern IA languages have a common, higher &quot;tatsam&quot; pool. Also, &quot;tatsam&quot;s and their derived &quot;tadbhav&quot;s can also co-exist in a language; sometimes of no consequence and at other times with differences in meaning:
What remains are words of foreign origin (&quot;videśī&quot;), as well as words of local origin that cannot be pegged as belonging to any of the three prior categories (&quot;deśaj&quot;). The former consists mainly of Persian, Arabic, and English, with trace elements of Portuguese and Turkish. While the phenomenon of English loanwords is relatively new, Perso-Arabic has a longer history behind it. Both English and Perso-Arabic influences are quite nationwide phenomena, in a way paralleling &quot;tatsam&quot; as a common vocabulary set or bank. What&#x27;s more is how, beyond a transposition into general Indo-Aryan, the Perso-Arabic set has also been assimilated in a manner characteristic and relevant to the specific Indo-Aryan language it is being used in, bringing to mind &quot;tadbhav&quot;.

====Perso-Arabic====

India was ruled for many centuries by Persian-speaking Muslims, amongst the most notable being the Delhi Sultanate, and the Mughal dynasty. As a consequence Indian languages were changed greatly, with the large scale entry of Persian and its many Arabic loans into the Gujarati lexicon. One fundamental adoption was Persian&#x27;s conjunction &quot;that&quot;, &quot;ke&quot;. Also, while &quot;tatsam&quot; or Sanskrit is etymologically continuous to Gujarati, it is essentially of a differing grammar (or language), and that in comparison while Perso-Arabic is etymologically foreign, it has been in certain instances and to varying degrees grammatically indigenised. Owing to centuries of situation and the end of Persian education and power, (1) Perso-Arabic loans are quite unlikely to be thought of or known as loans, and (2) more importantly, these loans have often been Gujarati-ized. &quot;dāvo&quot; – claim, &quot;fāydo&quot; – benefit, &quot;natījo&quot; – result, and &quot;hamlo&quot; – attack, all carry Gujarati&#x27;s masculine gender marker, &quot;o&quot;. &quot;khānũ&quot; – compartment, has the neuter &quot;ũ&quot;. Aside from easy slotting with the auxiliary &quot;karvũ&quot;, a few words have made a complete transition of verbification: &quot;kabūlvũ&quot; – to admit (fault), &quot;kharīdvũ&quot; – to buy, &quot;kharǎcvũ&quot; – to spend (money), &quot;gujarvũ&quot; – to pass. The last three are definite part and parcel.

Below is a table displaying a number of these loans. Currently some of the etymologies are being referenced to an Urdu dictionary so that Gujarati&#x27;s singular masculine &quot;o&quot; corresponds to Urdu &quot;ā&quot;, neuter &quot;ũ&quot; groups into &quot;ā&quot; as Urdu has no neuter gender, and Urdu&#x27;s Persian &quot;z&quot; is not upheld in Gujarati and corresponds to &quot;j&quot; or &quot;jh&quot;. In contrast to modern Persian, the pronunciation of these loans into Gujarati and other Indo-Aryan languages, as well as that of Indian-recited Persian, seems to be in line with Persian spoken in Afghanistan and Central Asia, perhaps 500 years ago.

Lastly, Persian, being part of the Indo-Iranian language family as Sanskrit and Gujarati are, met up in some instances with its cognates:

Zoroastrian Persian refugees known as Parsis also speak an accordingly Persianized form of Gujarati.

====English====

With the end of Perso-Arabic inflow, English became the current foreign source of new vocabulary. English had and continues to have a considerable influence over Indian languages. Loanwords include new innovations and concepts, first introduced directly through British colonial rule, and then streaming in on the basis of continued Anglophone dominance in the Republic of India. Besides the category of new ideas is the category of English words that already have Gujarati counterparts which end up replaced or existed alongside with. The major driving force behind this latter category has to be the continuing role of English in modern India as a language of education, prestige, and mobility. In this way, Indian speech can be sprinkled with English words and expressions, even switches to whole sentences. &quot;See Hinglish, Code-switching&quot;.

In matters of sound, English alveolar consonants map as retroflexes rather than dentals. Two new characters were created in Gujarati to represent English /æ/&#x27;s and /ɔ/&#x27;s. Levels of Gujarati-ization in sound vary. Some words do not go far beyond this basic transpositional rule, and sound much like their English source, while others differ in ways, one of those ways being the carrying of dentals. &quot;See Indian English&quot;.

As English loanwords are a relatively new phenomenon, they adhere to English grammar, as &quot;tatsam&quot; words adhere to Sanskrit. That is not to say that the most basic changes have been underway: many English words are pluralised with Gujarati &quot;o&quot; over English &quot;s&quot;. Also, with Gujarati having three genders, genderless English words must take one. Though often inexplicable, gender assignment may follow the same basis as it is expressed in Gujarati: vowel type, and the nature of word meaning.

====Portuguese====
The smaller foothold the Portuguese had in wider India had linguistic effects. Gujarati took up a number of words, while elsewhere the influence was great enough to the extent that creole languages came to be (&quot;see Portuguese India, Portuguese-based creole languages in India and Sri Lanka&quot;). Comparatively, the impact of Portuguese has been greater on coastal languages and their loans tend to be closer to the Portuguese originals. The source dialect of these loans imparts an earlier pronunciation of &quot;ch&quot; as an affricate instead of the current standard of .

===Loans into English===
&quot;Bungalow&quot;—
&quot;Coolie&quot;—
&quot;Tank&quot;—
==Grammar==

Gujarati is a head-final, or left-branching language. Adjectives precede nouns, direct objects come before verbs, and there are postpositions. The word order of Gujarati is SOV, and there are three genders and two numbers. There are no definite or indefinite articles. A verb is expressed with its verbal root followed by suffixes marking aspect and agreement in what is called a main form, with a possible proceeding auxiliary form derived from &quot;to be&quot;, marking tense and mood, and also showing agreement. Causatives (up to double) and passives have a morphological basis.

<text>Drum Manor Forest Park is a forest in Northern Ireland, south of the Sperrin Mountains and west of Lough Neagh. It was bought from a private owner in 1964 and opened to the public in 1970. Formally known as the home of the Arcbald family until 1964. The Arcbalds were in decline since 1926, when they sold off their tenet land in Kildress.

<text>Ethylene glycol (IUPAC name: ethane-1,2-diol) is an organic compound (a vicinal diol) with the formula . It is mainly used for two purposes: as a raw material in the manufacture of polyester fibers and for antifreeze formulations. It is an odorless, colorless, flammable, viscous liquid. It has a sweet taste, but is toxic in high concentrations. This molecule has been observed in outer space.

== Production ==
===Industrial routes===
Ethylene glycol is produced from ethylene (ethene), via the intermediate ethylene oxide. Ethylene oxide reacts with water to produce ethylene glycol according to the chemical equation

This reaction can be catalyzed by either acids or bases, or can occur at neutral pH under elevated temperatures. The highest yields of ethylene glycol occur at acidic or neutral pH with a large excess of water. Under these conditions, ethylene glycol yields of 90% can be achieved. The major byproducts are the oligomers diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, and tetraethylene glycol. The separation of these oligomers and water is energy-intensive. World production of ethylene glycol was ~20 Mt in 2010.

A higher selectivity is achieved by the use of Shell&#x27;s OMEGA process. In the OMEGA process, the ethylene oxide is first converted with carbon dioxide () to ethylene carbonate. This ring is then hydrolyzed with a base catalyst in a second step to produce mono-ethylene glycol in 98% selectivity. The carbon dioxide is released in this step again and can be fed back into the process circuit. The carbon dioxide comes in part from ethylene oxide production, where a part of the ethylene is completely oxidized.

Ethylene glycol is produced from carbon monoxide in countries with large coal reserves and less stringent environmental regulations. The oxidative carbonylation of methanol to dimethyl oxalate provides a promising approach to the production of -based ethylene glycol. Dimethyl oxalate can be converted into ethylene glycol in high yields (94.7%) by hydrogenation with a copper catalyst:

Because the methanol is recycled, only carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and oxygen are consumed. One plant with a production capacity of of ethylene glycol per year is in Inner Mongolia, and a second plant in the Chinese province of Henan with a capacity of was scheduled for 2012. , four plants in China with a capacity of each were operating, with at least 17 more to follow.

===Biological routes===
Ethylene glycol can be produced by recycling its polymeric derivatives such a polyethylene terephthalate.

=== Historical routes ===
According to most sources, French chemist Charles-Adolphe Wurtz (1817–1884) first prepared ethylene glycol in 1856. He first treated &quot;ethylene iodide&quot; (1,2-Diiodoethane) with silver acetate and then hydrolyzed the resultant &quot;ethylene diacetate&quot; with potassium hydroxide. Wurtz named his new compound &quot;glycol&quot; because it shared qualities with both ethyl alcohol (with one hydroxyl group) and glycerin (with three hydroxyl groups). In 1859, Wurtz prepared ethylene glycol via the hydration of ethylene oxide. There appears to have been no commercial manufacture or application of ethylene glycol prior to World War I, when it was synthesized from ethylene dichloride in Germany and used as a substitute for glycerol in the explosives industry.

In the United States, semicommercial production of ethylene glycol via ethylene chlorohydrin started in 1917. The first large-scale commercial glycol plant was erected in 1925 at South Charleston, West Virginia, by Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Co. (now Union Carbide Corp.). By 1929, ethylene glycol was being used by almost all dynamite manufacturers. In 1937, Carbide started up the first plant based on Lefort&#x27;s process for vapor-phase oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide. Carbide maintained a monopoly on the direct oxidation process until 1953 when the Scientific Design process was commercialized and offered for licensing.

== Uses ==
===Coolant and heat-transfer agent===
The major use of ethylene glycol is as an antifreeze agent in the coolant in for example, automobiles and air-conditioning systems that either place the chiller or air handlers outside or must cool below the freezing temperature of water. In geothermal heating/cooling systems, ethylene glycol is the fluid that transports heat through the use of a geothermal heat pump. The ethylene glycol either gains energy from the source (lake, ocean, water well) or dissipates heat to the sink, depending on whether the system is being used for heating or cooling.

Pure ethylene glycol has a specific heat capacity about one half that of water. So, while providing freeze protection and an increased boiling point, ethylene glycol lowers the specific heat capacity of water mixtures relative to pure water. A 1:1 mix by mass has a specific heat capacity of about 3140 J/(kg·°C) (0.75 BTU/(lb·°F)), three quarters that of pure water, thus requiring increased flow rates in same-system comparisons with water.

The mixture of ethylene glycol with water provides additional benefits to coolant and antifreeze solutions, such as preventing corrosion and acid degradation, as well as inhibiting the growth of most microbes and fungi. Mixtures of ethylene glycol and water are sometimes informally referred to in industry as glycol concentrates, compounds, mixtures, or solutions.

Table of thermal and physical properties of saturated liquid ethylene glycol:
===Anti-freeze===
Pure ethylene glycol freezes at about −12 °C (10.4 °F) but, when mixed with water, the mixture freezes at a lower temperature. For example, a mixture of 60% ethylene glycol and 40% water freezes at −45 °C (−49 °F). Diethylene glycol behaves similarly. The freezing point depression of some mixtures can be explained as a colligative property of solutions but, in highly concentrated mixtures such as the example, deviations from ideal solution behavior are expected due to the influence of intermolecular forces. It&#x27;s important to note that though pure and distilled water will have a greater specific heat capacity than any mixture of antifreeze and water, commercial antifreezes also typically contain an anti-corrosive additive to prevent pure water from corroding coolant passages in the engine block, cylinder head(s), water pump and radiator.

There is a difference in the mixing ratio, depending on whether it is ethylene glycol or propylene glycol. For ethylene glycol, the mixing ratios are typically 30/70 and 35/65, whereas the propylene glycol mixing ratios are typically 35/65 and 40/60. It is important that the mixture be frost-proof at the lowest operating temperature.

Because of the depressed freezing temperatures, ethylene glycol is used as a de-icing fluid for windshields and aircraft, as an antifreeze in automobile engines, and as a component of vitrification (anticrystallization) mixtures for low-temperature preservation of biological tissues and organs.

The use of ethylene glycol not only depresses the freezing point of aqueous mixtures, but also elevates their boiling point. This results in the operating temperature range for heat-transfer fluids being broadened on both ends of the temperature scale. The increase in boiling temperature is due to pure ethylene glycol having a much higher boiling point and lower vapor pressure than pure water.

===Precursor to polymers===

In the plastic industry, ethylene glycol is an important precursor to polyester fibers and resins. Polyethylene terephthalate, used to make plastic bottles for soft drinks, is prepared from ethylene glycol.

===Other uses===
====Dehydrating agent====
Ethylene glycol is used in the natural gas industry to remove water vapor from natural gas before further processing, in much the same manner as triethylene glycol (TEG).

====Hydrate inhibition====
Because of its high boiling point and affinity for water, ethylene glycol is a useful desiccant. Ethylene glycol is widely used to inhibit the formation of natural gas clathrates (hydrates) in long multiphase pipelines that convey natural gas from remote gas fields to a gas processing facility. Ethylene glycol can be recovered from the natural gas and reused as an inhibitor after purification treatment that removes water and inorganic salts.

Natural gas is dehydrated by ethylene glycol. In this application, ethylene glycol flows down from the top of a tower and meets a rising mixture of water vapor and hydrocarbon gases. Dry gas exits from the top of the tower. The glycol and water are separated, and the glycol recycled. Instead of removing water, ethylene glycol can also be used to depress the temperature at which hydrates are formed. The purity of glycol used for hydrate suppression (monoethylene glycol) is typically around 80%, whereas the purity of glycol used for dehydration (triethylene glycol) is typically 95 to more than 99%. Moreover, the injection rate for hydrate suppression is much lower than the circulation rate in a glycol dehydration tower.

====Precursor to other chemicals====
Minor uses of ethylene glycol include the manufacture of capacitors, as a chemical intermediate in the manufacture of 1,4-dioxane, as an additive to prevent corrosion in liquid cooling systems for personal computers, and inside the lens devices of cathode-ray tube type of rear projection televisions. Ethylene glycol is also used in the manufacture of some vaccines, but it is not itself present in these injections. It is used as a minor (1–2%) ingredient in shoe polish and also in some inks and dyes. Ethylene glycol has seen some use as a rot and fungal treatment for wood, both as a preventative and a treatment after the fact. It has been used in a few cases to treat partially rotted wooden objects to be displayed in museums. It is one of only a few treatments that are successful in dealing with rot in wooden boats, and is relatively cheap. Ethylene glycol may also be one of the minor ingredients in screen cleaning solutions, along with the main ingredient isopropyl alcohol. Ethylene glycol is commonly used as a preservative for biological specimens, especially in secondary schools during dissection as a safer alternative to formaldehyde. It is also used as part of the water-based hydraulic fluid used to control subsea oil and gas production equipment.

===Organic building block===
Although dwarfed by its use as a precursor to polyesters, ethylene glycol is useful in more specialized areas of organic chemistry. 

It serves as a protecting group in organic synthesis for manipulation of ketones and aldehydes. By reacting with the carbonyl to form and acetal product, it reduces the likelihood of nucleophilic attack at that carbonyl carbon. After the desired reaction is completed, the carbonyl can be regenerated using acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. In one example, isophorone was protected using ethylene glycol:
The glycol-derived dioxalane of ethyl acetoacetate is a commercial fragrance fructone.

==Miscellaneous chemical reactions==
Silicon dioxide dissolves slowly in hot ethylene glycol in the presence of alkali metal base to produce silicates. 

== Toxicity ==

Ethylene glycol has relatively high mammalian toxicity when ingested, roughly on par with methanol, with an oral LDLo = 786 mg/kg for humans. The major danger is due to its sweet taste, which can attract children and animals. Upon ingestion, ethylene glycol is oxidized to glycolic acid, which is, in turn, oxidized to oxalic acid, which is toxic. It and its toxic byproducts first affect the central nervous system, then the heart, and finally the kidneys. Ingestion of sufficient amounts is fatal if untreated. Several deaths are recorded annually in the U.S. alone.

Antifreeze products for automotive use containing propylene glycol in place of ethylene glycol are available. They are generally considered safer to use, as propylene glycol is not as palatable and is converted in the body to lactic acid, a normal product of metabolism and exercise.

Australia, the UK, and seventeen US states (as of 2012) require the addition of a bitter flavoring (denatonium benzoate) to antifreeze. In December 2012, US antifreeze manufacturers agreed voluntarily to add a bitter flavoring to all antifreeze that is sold in the consumer market of the US.

In 2022, several hundred children died of acute kidney failure in Indonesia and The Gambia because the paracetamol syrup made by New Delhi-based Maiden Pharmaceuticals contained ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol, ingredients that have been linked to child deaths from acute kidney injury in The Gambia. In December 2022, Uzbekistan&#x27;s health ministry has said children died as a result of ethylene glycol in cough syrup made by Marion Biotech, which is based at Noida, near New Delhi.

==Environmental effects==

Ethylene glycol is a high-production-volume chemical. It breaks down in air in about 10 days and in water or soil in a few weeks. It enters the environment through the dispersal of ethylene glycol-containing products, especially at airports, where it is used in de-icing agents for runways and airplanes. While prolonged low doses of ethylene glycol show no toxicity, at near lethal doses (≥ 1000 mg/kg per day) ethylene glycol acts as a teratogen. &quot;Based on a rather extensive database, it induces skeletal variations and malformations in rats and mice by all routes of exposure.&quot;

<text>A leprechaun () is a diminutive supernatural being in Irish folklore, classed by some as a type of solitary fairy. They are usually depicted as little bearded men, wearing a coat and hat, who partake in mischief. In later times, they have been depicted as shoe-makers who have a hidden pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

Leprechaun-like creatures rarely appear in Irish mythology and only became prominent in later folklore.

==Etymology==
The Anglo-Irish (Hiberno-English) word &quot;leprechaun&quot; is descended from Old Irish &quot;luchorpán or lupracán&quot;, via various (Middle Irish) forms such as &quot;luchrapán, lupraccán&quot;, (or var. &quot;luchrupán&quot;).

===Modern forms===
The current spelling is used throughout Ireland, but there are numerous regional variants.

John O&#x27;Donovan&#x27;s supplement to O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s &quot;Irish-English Dictionary&quot; defines as &quot;a sprite, a pigmy; a fairy of a diminutive size, who always carries a purse containing a shilling&quot;.

The Irish term &quot;leithbrágan&quot; in O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s Dictionary has also been recognized as an alternative spelling.

Other variant spellings in English have included &quot;lubrican&quot;, &quot;leprehaun&quot;, and &quot;lepreehawn&quot;. Some modern Irish books use the spelling &quot;lioprachán&quot;. The first recorded instance of the word in the English language was in Dekker&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Honest Whore, Part 2&quot; (1604): &quot;As for your Irish lubrican, that spirit / Whom by preposterous charms thy lust hath rais&#x27;d / In a wrong circle.&quot;

===Meanings===
The word may have been coined as a compound of the roots &quot;lú&quot; or &quot;laghu&quot; (from &quot;small&quot;) and &quot;corp&quot; (from &quot;body&quot;), or so it had been suggested by Whitley Stokes. Research published in 2019 suggests the word derives from the &quot;Luperci&quot; and associated Roman festival of Lupercalia.

Folk etymology derives the word from &quot;leith&quot; (half) and &quot;bróg&quot; (brogue), because of the frequent portrayal of the leprechaun as working on a single shoe, as evident in the alternative spelling &quot;leithbrágan&quot;.

==Early attestations==

The earliest known reference to the leprechaun appears in the medieval tale known as the (″&quot;Adventure of Fergus son of Léti&quot;″). The saga exists in two widely divergent versions. The first of these is written in Dublin, Trinity College MS 1337 pp. 363b–365a, better known as H. 3. 18 (CIH iii: 882.4–883.28) and has been dated to the eighth century (Binchy 1952). The second version is a copy of the 8th century text written on a single leaf inserted into London, British Library MS Harley 432 f.5 (CIH ii: 354.28–355.41). The saga was rewritten in the 13th century as a burlesque version. The text contains an episode in which Fergus mac Léti, King of Ulster, falls asleep on the beach and wakes to find himself being dragged into the sea by three &quot;lúchorpáin&quot;. He captures his abductors, who grant him three wishes in exchange for release.

==Folklore==
The leprechaun is said to be a solitary creature, whose principal occupation is making and cobbling shoes, and who enjoys practical jokes. In McAnally&#x27;s 1888 account, the Leprechaun was not a professional cobbler, but was frequently seen mending his own shoes, as &quot;he runs about so much he wears them out&quot; with great frequency. This is, he claims, the perfect opportunity for a human being to capture the Leprechaun, refusing to release him until the Leprechaun gives his captor supernatural wealth.

==Classification==
The leprechaun has been classed as a &quot;solitary fairy&quot; by the writer and amateur folklorist William Butler Yeats. Yeats was part of the revivalist literary movement greatly influential in &quot;calling attention to the leprechaun&quot; in the late 19th century. This classification by Yeats is derived from D. R. McAnally (&quot;Irish Wonders&quot;, 1888) derived in turn from John O&#x27;Hanlon (1870).

It is stressed that the leprechaun, though some may call it fairy, is clearly to be distinguished from the &quot;Aos Sí&quot; (or the &#x27;good people&#x27;) of the fairy mounds (&quot;sidhe&quot;) and raths. Leprachaun being solitary is one distinguishing characteristic, but additionally, the leprachaun is thought to only engage in pranks on the level of mischief, and requiring special caution, but in contrast, the &quot;Aos Sí&quot; may carry out deeds more menacing to humans, e.g., the spiriting away of children.

This identification of leprechaun as a fairy has been consigned to popular notion by modern folklorist Diarmuid Ó Giolláin. Ó Giolláin observes that the dwarf of Teutonic and other traditions, as well as the household familiar, are more amenable to comparison.

According to William Butler Yeats, the great wealth of the leprechauns comes from the &quot;treasure-crocks, buried of old in war-time&quot;, which they have uncovered and appropriated. According to David Russell McAnally, the leprechaun is the son of an &quot;evil spirit&quot; and a &quot;degenerate fairy&quot; and is &quot;not wholly good nor wholly evil&quot;.

===Appearance===

The leprechaun originally had a different appearance depending on where in Ireland he was found. Before the 20th century, it was generally held that the leprechaun wore red, not green. Samuel Lover, writing in 1831, describes the leprechaun as... quite a beau in his dress, notwithstanding, for he wears a red square-cut coat, richly laced with gold, and inexpressible of the same, cocked hat, shoes and buckles.

According to Yeats, the solitary fairies, like the leprechaun, wear red jackets, whereas the &quot;trooping fairies&quot; wear green. Yeats&#x27; leprechaun wore a jacket with seven rows of buttons with seven buttons to each row. Yeats describes that on the western coast, the red jacket is covered by a frieze one, whereas in Ulster the creature wears a cocked hat, and when he is up to anything unusually mischievous, he leaps onto a wall and spins, balancing himself on the point of the hat with his heels in the air.

According to McAnally the universal leprechaun is described as follows:

This dress varied by region. In McAnally&#x27;s account there were differences between leprechauns or Logherymans from different regions:
* The Northern Leprechaun or Logheryman wore a &quot;military red coat and white breeches, with a broad-brimmed, high, pointed hat, on which he would sometimes stand upside down&quot;.
* The Lurigadawne of Tipperary wore an &quot;antique slashed jacket of red, with peaks all round and a jockey cap, also sporting a sword, which he uses as a magic wand&quot;.
* The Luricawne of Kerry was a &quot;fat, pursy little fellow whose jolly round face rivals in redness the cut-a-way jacket he wears, that always has seven rows of seven buttons in each row&quot;.
* The Cluricawne of Monaghan wore &quot;a swallow-tailed evening coat of red with green vest, white breeches, black stockings,&quot; shiny shoes, and a &quot;long cone hat without a brim,&quot; sometimes used as a weapon.

In a poem entitled &quot;The Lepracaun; or, Fairy Shoemaker&quot;, 18th century Irish poet William Allingham describes the appearance of the leprechaun as:
...A wrinkled, wizen&#x27;d, and bearded Elf,
Spectacles stuck on his pointed nose,

Silver buckles to his hose,

Leather apron — shoe in his lap...

The modern image of the leprechaun sitting on a toadstool, having a red beard and green hat, etc. is a more modern invention, or borrowed from other strands of European folklore. The most likely explanation for the modern day Leprechaun appearance is that green is a traditional national Irish color dating back as far as 1642. The hat might be derived from the style of outdated fashion still common in Ireland in the 19th century. This style of fashion was commonly worn by Irish immigrants to the United States, since some Elizabethan era clothes were still common in Ireland in the 19th century long after they were out of fashion, as depicted by the Stage Irish. The buckle shoes and other garments also have their origin in the Elizabethan period in Ireland.
==Similar creatures==
The leprechaun is similar to the &quot;clurichaun&quot; and the &quot;far darrig&quot; in that he is a solitary creature. Some writers even go as far as to replace these second two less well-known spirits with the leprechaun in stories or tales to reach a wider audience. The clurichaun is considered by some to be merely a leprechaun on a drinking spree.

==In politics==
In the politics of the Republic of Ireland, leprechauns have been used to refer to the aspects of the tourism field in Ireland. This can be seen from this example of John A. Costello addressing the Oireachtas in 1963—
For many years, we were afflicted with the miserable trivialities of our tourist advertising. Sometimes it descended to the lowest depths, to the caubeen and the shillelagh, not to speak of the leprechaun.

==Popular culture==

Films, animated cartoons, and advertising have popularised a specific image of leprechauns which bears little resemblance to anything found in the cycles of Irish folklore. Some argue that the popularised image of the leprechaun is little more than a series of stereotypes based on derogatory anti-Irish 19th-century caricatures.

Many Celtic music groups have used the term leprechaun as part of their naming convention or as an album title. Some popular forms of American music, including heavy metal, celtic metal, punk rock, and jazz, have also made use of the mythological character.

Famous leprechaun characters include:

* Lucky, the mascot of Lucky Charms cereal, created by General Mills
* The Notre Dame Leprechaun, official mascot of the Fighting Irish sports teams at the University of Notre Dame
* Lucky the Leprechaun, mascot of the Boston Celtics, who is featured on the team&#x27;s logo
* Hornswoggle, a character created by professional wrestler Dylan Mark Postl, who competed under the persona for the majority of his WWE tenure
* The 1993 American horror slasher-film &quot;Leprechaun&quot; and its sequels feature a killer leprechaun portrayed by Warwick Davis.

Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman coined the term &quot;leprechaun economics&quot; to describe distorted or unsound economic data, which he first used in a tweet on 12 July 2016 in response to the publication by the Irish Central Statistics Office (CSO) that Irish GDP had grown by 26.3%, and Irish GNP had grown by 18.7%, in the 2015 Irish national accounts. The growth was subsequently shown to be due to Apple restructuring its double Irish tax scheme which the EU Commission had fined €13bn in 2004–2014 Irish unpaid taxes, the largest corporate tax fine in history. The term has been used many times since.

In the U.S., Leprechauns are often associated with St. Patrick&#x27;s Day along with the color green and shamrocks.

===Darby O&#x27;Gill===

The Disney film &quot;Darby O&#x27;Gill and the Little People&quot; (1959)—based on Herminie Templeton Kavanagh&#x27;s &quot;Darby O&#x27;Gill&quot; books—which features a leprechaun king, is a work in which Fergus mac Léti was &quot;featured parenthetically&quot;. In the film, the captured leprechaun king grants three wishes, like Fergus in the saga.

While the film project was in development, Walt Disney was in contact with, and consulting Séamus Delargy and the Irish Folklore Commission, but never asked for leprechaun material, even though a large folkloric repository on such subject was housed by the commission.

<doc id="143133" wikidata="Q604830" url="?curid=143133" title="Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)">
<text>In fluid mechanics, the center of pressure is the point on a body where a single force acting at that point can represent the total effect of the pressure field acting on the body.
The total force vector acting at the center of pressure is the surface integral of the pressure vector field across the surface of the body. The resultant force and center of pressure location produce an equivalent force and moment on the body as the original pressure field.

Pressure fields occur in both static and dynamic fluid mechanics. Specification of the center of pressure, the reference point from which the center of pressure is referenced, and the associated force vector allows the moment generated about any point to be computed by a translation from the reference point to the desired new point. It is common for the center of pressure to be located on the body, but in fluid flows it is possible for the pressure field to exert a moment on the body of such magnitude that the center of pressure is located outside the body.

==Hydrostatic example (dam)==
Since the forces of water on a dam are hydrostatic forces, they vary linearly with depth. The total force on the dam is then the integral of the pressure multiplied by the width of the dam as a function of the depth. The center of pressure is located at the centroid of the triangular shaped pressure field formula_1 from the top of the water line. The hydrostatic force and tipping moment on the dam about some point can be computed from the total force and center of pressure location relative to the point of interest.

==Historical usage for sailboats==
Center of pressure is used in sailboat design to represent the position on a sail where the aerodynamic force is concentrated.

The relationship of the aerodynamic center of pressure on the sails to the hydrodynamic center of pressure (referred to as the center of lateral resistance) on the hull determines the behavior of the boat in the wind. This behavior is known as the &quot;helm&quot; and is either a weather helm or lee helm. A slight amount of weather helm is thought by some sailors to be a desirable situation, both from the standpoint of the &quot;feel&quot; of the helm, and the tendency of the boat to head slightly to windward in stronger gusts, to some extent self-feathering the sails. Other sailors disagree and prefer a neutral helm.

The fundamental cause of &quot;helm&quot;, be it weather or lee, is the relationship of the center of pressure of the sail plan to the center of lateral resistance of the hull. If the center of pressure is astern of the center of lateral resistance, a weather helm, the tendency of the vessel is to want to turn into the wind.

If the situation is reversed, with the center of pressure forward of the center of lateral resistance of the hull, a &quot;lee&quot; helm will result, which is generally considered undesirable, if not dangerous. Too much of either helm is not good, since it forces the helmsman to hold the rudder deflected to counter it, thus inducing extra drag beyond what a vessel with neutral or minimal helm would experience.

==Aircraft aerodynamics==
A stable configuration is desirable not only in sailing, but in aircraft design as well. Aircraft design therefore borrowed the term center of pressure. And like a sail, a rigid non-symmetrical airfoil not only produces lift, but a moment.
The center of pressure of an aircraft is the point where all of the aerodynamic pressure field may be represented by a single force vector with no moment. A similar idea is the aerodynamic center which is the point on an airfoil where the pitching moment produced by the aerodynamic forces is constant with angle of attack.

The aerodynamic center plays an important role in analysis of the longitudinal static stability of all flying machines. It is desirable that when the pitch angle and angle of attack of an aircraft are disturbed (by, for example wind shear/vertical gust) that the aircraft returns to its original trimmed pitch angle and angle of attack without a pilot or autopilot changing the control surface deflection. For an aircraft to return towards its trimmed attitude, without input from a pilot or autopilot, it must have positive longitudinal static stability.

==Missile aerodynamics==
Missiles typically do not have a preferred plane or direction of maneuver and thus have symmetric airfoils. Since the center of pressure for symmetric airfoils is relatively constant for small angle of attack, missile engineers typically speak of the complete center of pressure of the entire vehicle for stability and control analysis. In missile analysis, the center of pressure is typically defined as the center of the additional pressure field due to a change in the angle of attack off of the trim angle of attack.

For unguided rockets the trim position is typically zero angle of attack and the center of pressure is defined to be the center of pressure of the resultant flow field on the entire vehicle resulting from a very small angle of attack (that is, the center of pressure is the limit as angle of attack goes to zero). For positive stability in missiles, the total vehicle center of pressure defined as given above must be further from the nose of the vehicle than the center of gravity. In missiles at lower angles of attack, the contributions to the center of pressure are dominated by the nose, wings, and fins. The normalized normal force coefficient derivative with respect to the angle of attack of each component multiplied by the location of the center of pressure can be used to compute a centroid representing the total center of pressure. The center of pressure of the added flow field is behind the center of gravity and the additional force &quot;points&quot; in the direction of the added angle of attack; this produces a moment that pushes the vehicle back to the trim position.

In guided missiles where the fins can be moved to trim the vehicles in different angles of attack, the center of pressure is the center of pressure of the flow field at that angle of attack for the undeflected fin position. This is the center of pressure of any small change in the angle of attack (as defined above). Once again for positive static stability, this definition of center of pressure requires that the center of pressure be further from the nose than the center of gravity. This ensures that any increased forces resulting from increased angle of attack results in increased restoring moment to drive the missile back to the trimmed position. In missile analysis, positive static margin implies that the complete vehicle makes a restoring moment for any angle of attack from the trim position.

== Movement of center of pressure for aerodynamic fields ==
The center of pressure on a symmetric airfoil typically lies close to 25% of the chord length behind the leading edge of the airfoil. (This is called the &quot;quarter-chord point&quot;.) For a symmetric airfoil, as angle of attack and lift coefficient change, the center of pressure does not move. It remains around the quarter-chord point for angles of attack below the stalling angle of attack. The role of center of pressure in the control characterization of aircraft takes a different form than in missiles.

On a cambered airfoil the center of pressure does not occupy a fixed location. For a conventionally cambered airfoil, the center of pressure lies a little behind the quarter-chord point at maximum lift coefficient (large angle of attack), but as lift coefficient reduces (angle of attack reduces) the center of pressure moves toward the rear. When the lift coefficient is zero an airfoil is generating no lift but a conventionally cambered airfoil generates a nose-down pitching moment, so the location of the center of pressure is an infinite distance behind the airfoil.

For a reflex-cambered airfoil, the center of pressure lies a little ahead of the quarter-chord point at maximum lift coefficient (large angle of attack), but as lift coefficient reduces (angle of attack reduces) the center of pressure moves forward. When the lift coefficient is zero an airfoil is generating no lift but a reflex-cambered airfoil generates a nose-up pitching moment, so the location of the center of pressure is an infinite distance ahead of the airfoil. This direction of movement of the center of pressure on a reflex-cambered airfoil has a stabilising effect.

The way the center of pressure moves as lift coefficient changes makes it difficult to use the center of pressure in the mathematical analysis of longitudinal static stability of an aircraft. For this reason, it is much simpler to use the aerodynamic center when carrying out a mathematical analysis. The aerodynamic center occupies a fixed location on an airfoil, typically close to the quarter-chord point.

The aerodynamic center is the conceptual starting point for longitudinal stability. The horizontal stabilizer contributes extra stability and this allows the center of gravity to be a small distance aft of the aerodynamic center without the aircraft reaching neutral stability. The position of the center of gravity at which the aircraft has neutral stability is called the neutral point.

<doc id="143135" wikidata="Q230967" url="?curid=143135" title="Parity (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, parity is the property of an integer of whether it is even or odd. An integer is even if it is divisible by 2, and odd if it is not. For example, −4, 0, and 82 are even numbers, while −3, 5, 7, and 21 are odd numbers.

The above definition of parity applies only to integer numbers, hence it cannot be applied to numbers like 1/2 or 4.201. See the section &quot;Higher mathematics&quot; below for some extensions of the notion of parity to a larger class of &quot;numbers&quot; or in other more general settings.

Even and odd numbers have opposite parities, e.g., 22 (even number) and 13 (odd number) have opposite parities. In particular, the parity of zero is even. Any two consecutive integers have opposite parity. A number (i.e., integer) expressed in the decimal numeral system is even or odd according to whether its last digit is even or odd. That is, if the last digit is 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9, then it is odd; otherwise it is even—as the last digit of any even number is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. The same idea will work using any even base. In particular, a number expressed in the binary numeral system is odd if its last digit is 1; and it is even if its last digit is 0. In an odd base, the number is even according to the sum of its digits—it is even if and only if the sum of its digits is even.

== Definition ==
An even number is an integer of the form
formula_1
where &quot;k&quot; is an integer; an odd number is an integer of the form
formula_2

An equivalent definition is that an even number is divisible by 2:
formula_3
and an odd number is not:
formula_4

The sets of even and odd numbers can be defined as following:
formula_5
formula_6

The set of &quot;even&quot; numbers is a prime ideal of formula_7 and the quotient ring formula_8 is the field with two elements. Parity can then be defined as the unique ring homomorphism from formula_7 to formula_8 where odd numbers are 1 and even numbers are 0. The consequences of this homomorphism are covered below.

== Properties ==
The following laws can be verified using the properties of divisibility. They are a special case of rules in modular arithmetic, and are commonly used to check if an equality is likely to be correct by testing the parity of each side. As with ordinary arithmetic, multiplication and addition are commutative and associative in modulo 2 arithmetic, and multiplication is distributive over addition. However, subtraction in modulo 2 is identical to addition, so subtraction also possesses these properties, which is not true for normal integer arithmetic.

=== Addition and subtraction ===
* even ± even = even;
* even ± odd = odd;
* odd ± odd = even;

===Multiplication===
* even × even = even;
* even × odd = even;
* odd × odd = odd;

By construction in the previous section, the structure ({even, odd}, +, ×) is in fact the field with two elements.

=== Division ===
The division of two whole numbers does not necessarily result in a whole number. For example, 1 divided by 4 equals 1/4, which is neither even &quot;nor&quot; odd, since the concepts of even and odd apply only to integers. But when the quotient is an integer, it will be even if and only if the dividend has more factors of two than the divisor.

==History==
The ancient Greeks considered 1, the monad, to be neither fully odd nor fully even. Some of this sentiment survived into the 19th century: Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel&#x27;s 1826 &quot;The Education of Man&quot; instructs the teacher to drill students with the claim that 1 is neither even nor odd, to which Fröbel attaches the philosophical afterthought,
==Higher mathematics==

===Higher dimensions and more general classes of numbers===

Integer coordinates of points in Euclidean spaces of two or more dimensions also have a parity, usually defined as the parity of the sum of the coordinates. For instance, the face-centered cubic lattice and its higher-dimensional generalizations (the &quot;Dn&quot; lattices) consist of all of the integer points whose coordinates have an even sum. This feature also manifests itself in chess, where the parity of a square is indicated by its color: bishops are constrained to moving between squares of the same parity, whereas knights alternate parity between moves. This form of parity was famously used to solve the mutilated chessboard problem: if two opposite corner squares are removed from a chessboard, then the remaining board cannot be covered by dominoes, because each domino covers one square of each parity and there are two more squares of one parity than of the other.

The parity of an ordinal number may be defined to be even if the number is a limit ordinal, or a limit ordinal plus a finite even number, and odd otherwise.

Let &quot;R&quot; be a commutative ring and let &quot;I&quot; be an ideal of &quot;R&quot; whose index is 2. Elements of the coset formula_11 may be called even, while elements of the coset formula_12 may be called odd.
As an example, let be the localization of Z at the prime ideal (2). Then an element of &quot;R&quot; is even or odd if and only if its numerator is so in Z.

===Number theory===
The even numbers form an ideal in the ring of integers, but the odd numbers do not—this is clear from the fact that the identity element for addition, zero, is an element of the even numbers only. An integer is even if it is congruent to 0 modulo this ideal, in other words if it is congruent to 0 modulo 2, and odd if it is congruent to 1 modulo 2.

All prime numbers are odd, with one exception: the prime number 2. All known perfect numbers are even; it is unknown whether any odd perfect numbers exist.

Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be represented as a sum of two prime numbers. Modern computer calculations have shown this conjecture to be true for integers up to at least 4 × 1018, but still no general proof has been found.

===Group theory===

The parity of a permutation (as defined in abstract algebra) is the parity of the number of transpositions into which the permutation can be decomposed. For example (ABC) to (BCA) is even because it can be done by swapping A and B then C and A (two transpositions). It can be shown that no permutation can be decomposed both in an even and in an odd number of transpositions. Hence the above is a suitable definition. In Rubik&#x27;s Cube, Megaminx, and other twisting puzzles, the moves of the puzzle allow only even permutations of the puzzle pieces, so parity is important in understanding the configuration space of these puzzles.

The Feit–Thompson theorem states that a finite group is always solvable if its order is an odd number. This is an example of odd numbers playing a role in an advanced mathematical theorem where the method of application of the simple hypothesis of &quot;odd order&quot; is far from obvious.

===Analysis===
The parity of a function describes how its values change when its arguments are exchanged with their negations. An even function, such as an even power of a variable, gives the same result for any argument as for its negation. An odd function, such as an odd power of a variable, gives for any argument the negation of its result when given the negation of that argument. It is possible for a function to be neither odd nor even, and for the case &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 0, to be both odd and even. The Taylor series of an even function contains only terms whose exponent is an even number, and the Taylor series of an odd function contains only terms whose exponent is an odd number.

===Combinatorial game theory===
In combinatorial game theory, an &quot;evil number&quot; is a number that has an even number of 1&#x27;s in its binary representation, and an &quot;odious number&quot; is a number that has an odd number of 1&#x27;s in its binary representation; these numbers play an important role in the strategy for the game Kayles. The parity function maps a number to the number of 1&#x27;s in its binary representation, modulo 2, so its value is zero for evil numbers and one for odious numbers. The Thue–Morse sequence, an infinite sequence of 0&#x27;s and 1&#x27;s, has a 0 in position &quot;i&quot; when &quot;i&quot; is evil, and a 1 in that position when &quot;i&quot; is odious.

==Additional applications==
In information theory, a parity bit appended to a binary number provides the simplest form of error detecting code. If a single bit in the resulting value is changed, then it will no longer have the correct parity: changing a bit in the original number gives it a different parity than the recorded one, and changing the parity bit while not changing the number it was derived from again produces an incorrect result. In this way, all single-bit transmission errors may be reliably detected. Some more sophisticated error detecting codes are also based on the use of multiple parity bits for subsets of the bits of the original encoded value.

In wind instruments with a cylindrical bore and in effect closed at one end, such as the clarinet at the mouthpiece, the harmonics produced are odd multiples of the fundamental frequency. (With cylindrical pipes open at both ends, used for example in some organ stops such as the open diapason, the harmonics are even multiples of the same frequency for the given bore length, but this has the effect of the fundamental frequency being doubled and all multiples of this fundamental frequency being produced.) See harmonic series (music).

In some countries, house numberings are chosen so that the houses on one side of a street have even numbers and the houses on the other side have odd numbers. Similarly, among United States numbered highways, even numbers primarily indicate east–west highways while odd numbers primarily indicate north–south highways. Among airline flight numbers, even numbers typically identify eastbound or northbound flights, and odd numbers typically identify westbound or southbound flights.

<doc id="143140" wikidata="Q1051819" url="?curid=143140" title="NCUBE">
<text>nCUBE was a series of parallel computing computers from the company of the same name. Early generations of the hardware used a custom microprocessor. With its final generations of servers, nCUBE no longer designed custom microprocessors for machines, but used server-class chips manufactured by a third party in massively parallel hardware deployments, primarily for the purposes of on-demand video.

== Company history ==
===Founding and early growth ===
nCUBE was founded in 1983 in Beaverton, Oregon, by a group of Intel employees (Steve Colley, Bill Richardson, John Palmer, Doran Wilde, Dave Jurasek) frustrated by Intel&#x27;s reluctance to enter the parallel computing market, though Intel released its iPSC/1 in the same year as the first nCUBE was released. In December 1985, the first generation of nCUBE&#x27;s hypercube machines were released. The second generation (N2) was launched in June 1989. The third generation (N3) was released in 1995. The fourth generation (N4) was released in 1999.

In 1988, Larry Ellison invested heavily in nCUBE and became the company&#x27;s majority shareholder. The company&#x27;s headquarters were relocated to Foster City, California, to be closer to the Oracle Corporation. In 1994, Ronald Dilbeck became CEO and set nCUBE on a fast track to an initial public offering.

=== Pivot to video ===
In 1996, Ellison downsized nCUBE. Dilbeck left and Ellison took over as acting CEO, redirecting the company to become Oracle&#x27;s Network Computer division. After the network computer diversion, nCUBE resumed development on video servers. nCUBE deployed its first VOD video server in Dubai&#x27;s Burj al-Arab hotel.

In 1999, nCUBE announced it was acquiring SkyConnect, a seven-year-old software company based in Louisville, Colorado, which developed digital advertising and VOD software for cable television. In the 1990s, nCUBE shifted its focus from the parallel computing market and, by 1999, had identified itself as a video on demand (VOD) solutions provider, shipping over 100 VOD systems delivering 17,000 streams and establishing a relationship with Microsoft TV. The company was once again on IPO fast-track, only to be halted again after the bursting of dot-com bubble.

=== Lawsuits and dot-com aftermath ===
In 2000, SeaChange International filed a patent infringement suit against nCUBE, alleging its nCUBE MediaCube-4 product infringed on a SeaChange patent. A jury upheld the validity of SeaChange&#x27;s patent and awarded damages. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit subsequently overturned the ruling on June 29, 2005. A separate lawsuit against SeaChange was filed by nCUBE in 2001 after it acquired the patents from Oracle&#x27;s interactive television division. nCUBE claimed that SeaChange&#x27;s video server offering violated its VOD patent on delivery to set-top boxes. nCUBE won the lawsuit and was awarded over $2 million in damages. SeaChange appealed, but the decision was upheld in 2004.

On the business front, the dot-com bubble burst and ensuing recession as well as lawsuits meant that nCUBE was not doing well. In April 2001 nCUBE laid off 17% of its workforce and began closing offices (Foster City in 2002 and Louisville in 2003) to downsize and consolidate the company around its Beaverton manufacturing office. Also in 2002, Ellison stepped down and named former SkyConnect CEO Michael J. Pohl as CEO.

=== Acquired ===
In January 2005, nCUBE was acquired by C-COR for approximately $89.5 million, with an SEC filing for the purchase in October 2004.

In December 2007, C-COR was acquired by ARRIS.

== Computer models ==
=== nCUBE 10 ===
One of the first nCUBE machines to be released was the nCUBE 10 of late 1985. It was originally called NCUBE/ten but the name morphed over time. These were based on a set of custom chips, where each compute node had a processor chip with 32-bit ALU, a 64-bit IEEE 754 FPU, special communication instructions, and 128 KB of RAM. A node delivered 2 MIPS, 500 kiloFLOPS (32-bit single precision), or 300 kiloFLOPS (64-bit double precision). There were 64 nodes per board. The host board, based on an Intel 80286, ran Axis, a custom Unix-like operating system, and each compute node ran a 4 KB kernel, Vertex.

nCUBE 10 referred to the machine&#x27;s ability to build an order-ten hypercube, supporting 1,024 CPUs in a single machine. Some of the modules would be used strictly for input/output, which included the nChannel storage control card, frame buffers, and the InterSystem card that allowed nCUBEs to be attached to each other. At least one host board needed to be installed, acting as the terminal driver. It could also partition the machine into &quot;sub-cubes&quot; and allocate them separately to different users.

=== nCUBE 2 ===

For the second series the naming was changed, and they created the single-chip nCUBE 2 processor. This was otherwise similar to the nCUBE 10&#x27;s CPU, but ran faster, at 25 MHz to provide about 7 MIPS and 3.5 megaFLOPS. This was later improved to 30 MHz in the 2S model. RAM was increased as well, with 4 to 16 MB of RAM on a &quot;single wide&quot; 1 inch x 3.5 inch module, with additional form factors of &quot;double wide&quot; (double modules), and quadruple that in a double wide, double side module. The I/O cards generally had less RAM, with different backend interfaces to support SCSI, HIPPI and other protocols.

Each nCUBE 2 CPU also included 13 I/O channels running at 20 Mbit/s. One of these was dedicated to I/O duties, while the other twelve were used as the interconnect system between CPUs. Each channel used wormhole routing to forward messages. The machines themselves were wired up as order-twelve hypercubes, allowing for up to 4,096 CPUs in a single machine.

Each module ran a 200 KB microkernel called nCX, but the system now used a Sun Microsystems workstation as the front end and no longer needed the Host Controller. nCX included a parallel filesystem that could do 96-way striping for high performance. C and C++ languages are available, as is NQS, Linda, and Parasoft&#x27;s Express. These were supported by an in-house compiler team.

The largest nCUBE 2 system installed was at Sandia National Laboratories, a 1,024-CPU system that reached 1.91 gigaFLOPS in testing. In addition the nCX operating system, it also ran the SUNMOS lightweight kernel for research purposes. Researchers Robert Benner, John Gustafson and Gary Montry of the Parallel Processing Division of Sandia National Laboratory first won the Karp Prize of $100 and then won the first Gordon Bell Prize in 1987 using the nCUBE 10.

===nCUBE-3===
The nCUBE-3 CPU used a 64-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU). Its improvements included a process-shrink to 0.5u, allowing the speed to be increased to 50 MHz (with plans for 66 and 100 MHz). The CPU was also superscalar and included 16 KB instruction and data caches, and a memory management unit for virtual memory support.

Additional I/O links were added, with 2 dedicated to I/O and 16 for interconnects, allowing for up to 65,536 CPUs in the hypercube. The channels operated at 100 Mbit/s, due to use of 2-bit parallel lines, instead of the serial lines used previously. The nCUBE-3 also added fault-tolerant adaptive routing support, in addition to fixed routing, although in retrospect it&#x27;s not entirely clear why.

A fully loaded nCUBE-3 machine can use up to 65,536 processors, for 3 million MIPS and 6.5 teraFLOPS; the maximum memory would be 65 TB, with a network I/O capability of 24 TB/second. Thus, the processor is biased in terms of I/O, which is usually the limitation. The nChannel board provides 16 I/O channels, where each channel can support transfers at 20 MB/s.

A microkernel was developed for the nCUBE-3 machine, but it was never completed, having been abandoned in favor of Plan 9&#x27;s Transit operating system.

===nCUBE-4===
The nCUBE-4 marked the transition to commodity processors, with each node containing an Intel IA32 server-class CPU. The n4 also brought exclusive focus on video streaming rather than scientific applications. Each hub contained one hypercube node, one CPU, a pair of PCI buses, and up to 12 SCSI drives. The n4 was followed by the n4x, the n4x r2, and the n4x r3. These last two were based on the Serverworks chipset rather than the Intel ones. The nCUBE-5 was very similar to the n4 family but incorporated two hypercube nodes in each hub and only supported video streaming over Gigabit Ethernet.

In 1999, nCUBE announced the MediaCUBE 4, which supported 80 simultaneous 3 Mbit/s streams to 44,000 simultaneous VOD streams, in concurrent MPEG-2, MPEG-1 and mid bit-rate encoding protocols.

<doc id="143142" wikidata="Q203198" url="?curid=143142" title="Avitus">
<text>Eparchius Avitus (died 456/7) was Roman emperor of the Western Empire from July 455 to October 456. He was a senator of Gallic extraction and a high-ranking officer both in the civil and military administration, as well as Bishop of Piacenza.

He opposed the reduction of the Western Roman Empire to Italy alone, both politically and from an administrative point of view. For this reason, as Emperor he introduced several Gallic senators in the Imperial administration; this policy, however, was opposed by the senatorial aristocracy and by the people of Rome, who had suffered from the sack of the city by the Vandals in 455.

Avitus had a good relationship with the Visigoths, in particular with their king Theodoric II, who was a friend of his and who acclaimed Avitus Emperor. The possibility of a strong and useful alliance between the Visigoths and Romans faded, however, when Theodoric invaded Hispania at Avitus&#x27; behest, which rendered him unable to help Avitus against the rebel Roman generals who deposed him.

==Origins and early career==

Avitus was born in Clermont to a family of the Gallo-Roman nobility. His father was possibly Agricola, consul in 421. Avitus had two sons, Agricola (fl 455 – living 507, a &quot;vir illustris&quot;) and Ecdicius Avitus (later &quot;patricius&quot; and &quot;magister militum&quot; under Emperor Julius Nepos) and a daughter Papianilla; she married Sidonius Apollinaris, whose letters and panegyrics remain an important source for Avitus&#x27; life and times.

Avitus followed a course of study typical for a young man of his rank, including law. Before 421 he was sent to the powerful &quot;patricius&quot; Flavius Constantius (briefly Emperor in 421) to ask for a tax reduction for his own country; this embassy was successful. His relative Theodorus was held hostage at the court of the King of the Visigoths, Theodoric I. In 425–426, Avitus went and met him and the King, who let Avitus enter his own court. Here, around 439, Avitus met the son of Theodoric, Theodoric II, who later became King. Avitus inspired the young Theodoric to study Latin poets.

He then started a military career serving under the &quot;magister militum&quot; Aetius in his campaign in the Alps against the Juthungi and the Norics (430–431) and against the Burgundians (436). In 437, after being elevated to the rank of &quot;vir illustris&quot;, he returned to Avernia, where he held a high office, probably &quot;magister militum per Gallias&quot;. In the same year, he defeated a group of Hunnic raiders near Clermont and obliged Theodoric to lift the siege of Narbonne. In 439, he became Praetorian prefect of Gaul and renewed the friendship treaty with the Visigoths.

Before the summer of 440, he retired to private life at his estate, Avitacum, near Clermont. Here he lived until 451, when the Huns, led by Attila, invaded the Western Roman Empire; Avitus persuaded Theodoric into an alliance with Rome, and the combined forces of Theodoric and Aetius defeated Attila in the Battle of Châlons; Theodoric died in the battle.

==Rise to the throne==
In the late spring of 455, Avitus was recalled to service by emperor Petronius Maximus and was elevated to the rank of &quot;magister militum&quot;, probably &quot;praesentalis&quot;; Maximus sent Avitus in an embassy to the court of Theodoric II, who had succeeded to his father, at Toulouse. This embassy probably confirmed the new king and his people as &quot;foederati&quot; of the Empire and asked for their support for the new Emperor.

While Avitus was at Theodoric&#x27;s court, news came of the death of Petronius Maximus (31 May) and of the sack of Rome by the Vandals of Gaiseric. Theodoric acclaimed Avitus Emperor in Toulouse; on 9 July, the new Emperor was acclaimed by the Gallic chiefs gathered in Viernum, near Arelate (Arles), and later, around 5 August, before Avitus reached Rome, he received the recognition of the Roman Senate.

Avitus stayed in Gaul for three months, to consolidate his power in the region that was the center of his support, and later went to Italy with a Gallic army, probably reinforced with a Gothic force. He probably travelled to Noricum to restore the imperial authority in that province, and then passed through Ravenna, where he left a Gothic force under the new &quot;patricius&quot; and &quot;magister militum&quot; Remistus, a Visigoth. On 21 September, finally, he entered Rome.

==Consolidation of power==

The effective power of Avitus depended on the support of all the major players in the Western Roman Empire in the mid-5th century. The new Emperor needed the support of both the civil institutions, the Roman Senate and the Eastern Roman Emperor Marcian, as well as that of the army and its commanders (the generals Majorian and Ricimer) and the Vandals of Gaiseric.

On 1 January 456, Avitus took the consulate, as traditionally the Emperors held the consulate in the first year upon assuming the purple. However, his consulate &quot;sine collega&quot; (without a second Consul) was not recognised by the Eastern court, which nominated two consuls, Iohannes and Varanes. The fact that the two courts did not agree on a couple of consuls but each nominated its own means that despite the efforts of Avitus to receive the recognition of the Eastern Emperor, the relationship between the two halves of the Empire was not optimal.

==Foreign policy==
Treaties under Marcian and a treaty of 442 between emperor Valentinian III and the Vandal king Gaiseric had failed to reduce Vandal incursions and raids along the Italian coast. Avitus&#x27; own efforts secured a temporary winter truce with them; but in March 456, Vandals destroyed Capua. Avitus sent Ricimer to defend Sicily, and the Romans defeated the Vandals twice, once in a land battle near Agrigento and another in a naval battle off Corsica.
During the reign of Avitus, the Visigoths expanded into Hispania, nominally under Roman authorisation but actually to promote their own interests. In 455, Avitus had sent an ambassador, &quot;comes&quot; Fronto, to the Suebi and then to Theodoric II to ask them to formally recognise Roman rule. When the Suebi invaded the Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis, the Visigoths attacked and defeated them 5 October 456 at the Campus Paramus, twelve miles from Astorga, on the banks of the Órbigo (Urbicus), subsequently occupying the province as nominal &quot;foederati&quot; of the Empire.

==Fall==

In the meantime, resentment amongst the population of Italy against the &quot;foreigner&quot; Avitus grew. The population of Rome, devastated by the sack of Rome, suffered from food shortages due to the Vandal control of the naval routes, aggravated by the requirements of the foreign troops that had arrived with Avitus. The imperial treasury was almost empty and, after disbanding his Visigoth guard because of popular pressure, Avitus was obliged to pay their huge wages by melting down and selling the bronze of some statues.

Counting on the popular discontent, on the disbandment of the imperial guard, and on the prestige gained through their victories, Ricimer and the &quot;comes domesticorum&quot; Majorian rebelled against Avitus; the Emperor was obliged to leave Rome in early autumn and to move north. Ricimer had the Roman Senate depose Avitus and ordered the murder of the &quot;magister militum&quot; Remistus in the &quot;Palatium&quot; at Classe, on 17 September 456.

Avitus decided to react. First he chose Messianus, one of his collaborators in his embassy to the Visigoths ordered by Petronius Maximus, as the new &quot;magister militum&quot;; then he probably went to Gaul (Hydatius says to Arelate) to collect all the available forces, probably the Visigoth guard he had just disbanded; finally he led his forces against the troops of Ricimer, near Piacenza. The Emperor and his army entered the city and attacked the huge army led by Ricimer, but after a great massacre of his men, including Messianus, Avitus fled on 17 or 18 October 456. In the immediate aftermath Ricimer spared his life, but forced him to become Bishop of Piacenza.

==Death==

Avitus&#x27; Gallic supporters may still have recognised him as emperor, despite his deposition. Sidonius Apollinaris tells of a failed &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in Gaul organised by one Marcellus and probably aimed at bringing Avitus back to the throne. The contemporary historian Hydatius, who lived in Spain, considered the year 457 the third of Avitus&#x27; reign; Avitus&#x27; own intentions are not known, nor are the manner and date of his death, of which there are several versions. In some, he was told that the Roman Senate had condemned him to death, and so he tried to flee to Gaul, officially travelling there to bring donations to the basilica of Saint Julian in Avernia, his homeland; according to Gregory of Tours, he died during this journey. Other sources have him strangled or starved to death, by order of his successor. Avitus died in 457, or late in 456, very soon after his deposition, and was buried at Brioude, next to Saint Julian&#x27;s tomb.

<text>San Giuliano di Puglia is a small town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Campobasso, in the region of Molise, in Italy.

Even though it is now part of Molise, its name still recalls its former administrative and cultural association with the region of Apulia (Puglia).

It is mainly an agricultural centre.

== 2002 earthquake ==

On 31 October 2002, the town was severely damaged by an earthquake.

The event provoked the collapse of the local school, in which 26 of the 51 pupils lost their lives, together with one of their teachers.
None of the 9 boys of the 4th class (born in 1996) survived.

The quake was the first seismic event on this site, and the town was not included in any seismic map for preventive protection purposes.
