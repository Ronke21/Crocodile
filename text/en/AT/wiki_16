<text>Mabton is a city in Yakima County, Washington, United States. The population was 1,959 at the 2020 census. Incorporated during the first few years of the 20th century, it is located at the eastern edge of the Yakama Indian Reservation.

==History==
The Mabton area&#x27;s original inhabitants were the Yakama people, who were forced onto a reservation in 1855. Mabton&#x27;s existence as a town is due to the Northern Pacific Railway, which arrived in the area around 1884 and built a water tower and section house on the site. Nothing else existed at Mabton until 1892 when Sam P. Flower built a store and a warehouse. He soon became the town&#x27;s first postmaster. Mabton was named by Charlie Sandburg, a Swedish railworker, who proposed the name &quot;Mabletown&quot; for the wife (or daughter) of a railroad official who had spoken kind words to track workers during an inspection. By 1895, Mabton had several stores, a hotel, a railroad depot and a schoolhouse. The Mabton Townsite Company, formed by Sam P. Flower and J.A. Humphrey, made the first plat in 1902, and by 1904, it had more than a dozen businesses and a newspaper. The town of Mabton officially incorporated on November 7, 1905.

Today, residents primarily are employed in occupations related to agriculture, especially hop growing and grape growing.

The Mabton School District has been the repeated beneficiary of grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation:
* $558,000 over five years (from 2000 to 2005) to enhance student access to technology;
* In 2001, Mabton High School was one of sixteen high schools chosen to participate in the &quot;Washington State Achievers Program&quot;; the school gets a share proportional to its student population (about 330 students) of more than $9 million to support school improvement and redesign efforts and more than $100 million for college scholarships for its students;
* Over $40,000 over five years (2001–2006) to improve high school education and access to higher education; and
* Over $125,000 over 34 months (2001–2004) to support professional development programs in partnership with Heritage College.

<text>Moxee is a small suburban community southeast of Yakima, Washington. Yakima and Moxee are both north of the Yakama Indian Reservation in Yakima County, Washington, United States. The population of Moxee was 4,326 at the 2020 census.

According to the Washington State Office of Financial Management, Moxee ranked 5th of 279 eligible incorporated communities in population growth between 2000 and 2005.

==History==
Moxee was first settled by Mortimer Thorp and several French-Canadian farmers who arrived in 1867. A warm spring on the Thorp ranch emitted steam year &#x27;round and never froze. It was known as &quot;Moxee&quot; by the native people, a Sahaptin word for an edible root, and was the name was adopted for the settlement. Over time, the community has been variously known as: &quot;Artesian&quot;, &quot;Moksee&quot;, &quot;Moxie&quot;, &quot;Moxee City&quot;, and &quot;Moxee.&quot;

The sandy soil and mild climate of the region were ideal for growing hops used in the brewing of beer, and for growing grapes. By the turn-of-the century, the Northern Pacific Railroad had completed a railway line nearby and irrigation projects were being constructed making rich farmland available to new settlers. This attracted more French and French-Canadian farmers who had first immigrated to northern Minnesota and northern Michigan. A French school was established on La Framboise Road and masses at Holy Rosary Parish were said in French up to World War I.

The town of Moxee City was incorporated on April 27, 1921. Street and road names in the vicinity, such as Charron, Faucher, Rivard, Beaudry, Desmarais, Robillard, Beauchene, Gamache, Champoux, Morrier, and St. Hilaire, continue to reflect Moxee&#x27;s French-Canadian heritage. However, almost one-third of residents are of Hispanic descent today.

In 2016, several homes near Moxie were evacuated because of the Range 12 fire, which ultimately destroyed over tens-of-thousands of acres in Yakima County.

<text>Selah is a city in Yakima County, Washington, United States. It is north of Yakima and part of its metropolitan area. The city&#x27;s population was 8,153 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The name Selah originates from an indigenous word meaning &quot;still water&quot; or &quot;smooth water&quot;.

Selah was incorporated as a city on March 17, 1919. The Tree Top apple processor co-operative (established in 1960) has its headquarters and two processing plants in Selah. In 2004, the Yakama Tribe bought the old Hi-Country juicing plant, which it operated until 2010. Currently, the facility is owned and operated by Sun-Rype, the U.S. arm of Western Canada&#x27;s largest juice and fruit snack distributor. It continues to produce store brand apple juice and other beverages. In addition a number of fruit companies have warehouses there, due to the proximity of fruit orchards in the nearby Wenas Valley and access to regional railroad and roadway systems for shipment to markets. Selah and the Wenas Valley increasingly serve as a &quot;bedroom community&quot; of the larger city of Yakima to the south. Because of the nearby orchards and juice processing plants, Selah is often referred to as &quot;The Apple Juice Capital of the World&quot;

Each Memorial Day weekend, the Washington State chapter of the National Audubon Society holds a campout some 22 miles north of Selah at the Hazel Wolf Bird Sanctuary in the upper Wenas Valley near Wenas, Washington. The upper valley also holds Wenas Lake, an irrigation reservoir. Wenas Creek flows from the reservoir through the agricultural lower Wenas Valley. This is where the Wenas Creek Mammoth was found. The creek is a tributary of the Yakima River.

In July 2020, the city was the subject of a New York Times story examining small town reaction to non-violent protests about racial inequality which noted anecdotal evidence of uneven enforcement of laws and rules to people of color.

<text>Sunnyside is a city in Yakima County, Washington, United States. The population was 16,375 at the 2020 census, making it the second-most populous city in Yakima County.

==History==

Up through the early portion of the 19th century, the portion of the Yakima Valley where Sunnyside is now located was inhabited by the &quot;Taptat-ħlama&quot; (or ″People at the rapids&quot;). These people hunted and fished along Yakima River from the mouth of Satus Creek (contained in present-day Satus immediately southwest of Sunnyside) to present Kiona, with a key fishery at near present-day Prosser.

Several tribes in the region were relocated onto the Yakama Indian Reservation following the 1855 signing of a treaty with the federal government. However, the Yakima War lingered until 1858, with Chief Kamiakin fighting on until the Battle of Four Lakes in 1858.

The modern settlement of Sunnyside was founded by Walter Granger in 1893. The name was coined by a merchant named W. H. Cline. Granger was involved in the financing and construction of the Sunnyside Canal which would have allowed Yakima River water to irrigate the area. However, due to the Panic of 1893, Granger&#x27;s creditors foreclosed on the canal, and the town&#x27;s population dwindled to seven families. By the end of 1901, the population had doubled, finally exceeding 300 people. The site contained &quot;1 bank, 11 stores, 3 hotels, 1 newspaper [the &quot;Sunnyside Sun&quot;, still publishing in 2020], 2 blacksmith shops, 2 livery barns, 3 churches, and a large and growing school&quot;.

On September 16, 1902, residents voted 42–1 to incorporate as the town of Sunnyside. At the time, the town had 314 residents, just over the state minimum for an incorporation referendum. The first mayor of Sunnyside was the town druggist James Henderson.

Sunnyside&#x27;s population increase at this time was stimulated by the immigration of the Dunkards from South Dakota who were moving to the town. The population of Dunkards was of such notable size that, by 1902, it was noted that they had &quot;built a commodious place of worship at Sunnyside&quot; which was the largest church in Yakima County at the time.

The Dunkards, members of the German Baptist Progressive Brethren, relocated to Sunnyside in order to form what they called the Christian Cooperative Colony. They bought the entire town site and were the developers of its first bank, and a telephone system. They enforced clauses prohibiting alcohol, dancing and gambling as a condition on every parcel of land sold. Because of this, old maps of Washington identify the town with a cross or halo symbol.

In the 1930s, refugees from the Dust Bowl also moved to Sunnyside.

Under the leadership of mayor William Bright &quot;Billy&quot; Cloud (1870–1959), Sunnyside initiated a project to pave its dirt streets on June 5, 1917. This project was necessary since years of irrigation had raised the water table to the point that the streets had become unbearably muddy. The cost of the entire project was $62,629.45.

In 1948, Sunnyside became the first city in the state to adopt a council–manager system of government. The system provides for an elected city council which is responsible for policy making, and a professional city manager, appointed by the council, who is responsible for administration. The city manager provides policy advice, directs the daily operations of city government, handles personnel functions (including the power to appoint and remove employees) and is responsible for preparing the city budget. Under the council-manager statutes, the city council is prohibited from interfering with the manager&#x27;s administration. The city manager, however, is directly accountable to and can be removed by a majority vote of the council at any time.

Sunnyside was named an All-America City in 1979.

Usually taking place in early December, the parade includes &quot;farm implements: combines, boom trucks, sprayers, swathers, grape pickers, and all types of tractors&quot; decorated with colorful lights. The 2006 edition of the event had more than 70 parade entrants. The A&amp;E network once named the event one of the &quot;Top 10&quot; such parades in the United States. The parade was the first of its kind in the Yakima Valley.

===Darigold cheese factory===
The &quot;Darigold Dairy Fair&quot; manufactured 150 million pounds of cheese annually but was mostly noted for its colorful facade and circus-like decorations, which included a pair of cows swinging on a flying trapeze. The Dairy Fair Store was shut down in 2012.

===Sunnyside Historical Museum===
Located downtown, the museum houses and displays artifacts and documents with a focus on daily life in Sunnyside during its early years. The building housing the museum was donated to the city by Robert and Martha McIntosh, who had purchased the business from the family of Walter C. Ball &amp; Sons, the local undertaking business. Both were also among the pioneering families that founded Sunnyside. The Sunnyside Memorial Cemetery, founded by the Ball Family, is located north of town. The lone structure at that location was designed by Percy Ball to resemble Chingford Church in Walthamstow, England, where Walter C. Ball and his wife Amelia grew up together. This building was used to house the retort for cremations until it fell into disrepair. The family plots of the Ball family are located on the east side of the structure.

==Schools==
Many of the original school buildings in Sunnyside, and the town of Outlook just northwest of town, have either burned to the ground or been demolished to make way for bigger and better structures. One of the original structures still in use is the Lincoln School Building which sits at the intersection of Lincoln and Sixth Street. Erected in 1927, it is a two-story structure with an adjacent gymnasium attached to the east wing of the building. In 1928, female teachers were not allowed to marry. Doing so would void their contract to teach.

The land on which Lincoln School sits was donated to the school district by H. Lloyd Miller in 1926. He and his wife later donated the land next to it between the school and 9th Ave. to be used for playing fields for the students. Lincoln is still one of the oldest buildings in the school district. It has been remodeled and renovated to accommodate the administrative offices for the district.

Sunnyside High School was named a School of Distinction in 2015 and 2016. According to ESD105, &quot;The Schools of Distinction Award goes to the top 5 percent of Washington schools that have attained the most outstanding levels of sustained improvement in English language arts, math, and graduation rates among their students over the past five years.&quot;

===Libraries===
Sunnyside has one public library. The original public library, a Carnegie Library, was built in 1911. It was replaced in 1964 with the current library building. It is the second largest library in the Yakima Valley Libraries and has one of the largest Spanish language collections in the system.

<doc id="138354" wikidata="Q986202" url="?curid=138354" title="Toppenish, Washington">
<text>Toppenish () is a city in Yakima County, Washington, United States. The population was 8,854 at the 2020 census. It is located within the Yakama Indian Reservation, established in 1855.

Toppenish calls itself the city of Murals, as it has more than 75 murals adorning its buildings. The first, &quot;Clearing the Land&quot;, was painted in 1989, and the city hosts horse-drawn tours and annual art events. All murals are historically accurate and depict scenes of the region from 1840 to 1940.

==History==
All territory set aside for the Yakama Indian Reservation by the Treaty of Washington was held communally in the name of the tribe. None of the land was individually owned. The treaty of 1855, between the United States government, representatives from thirteen other bands, tribes, and Chief Kamiakin, resulted in the Yakama Nation relinquishing of their homeland. Prior to their ceding the land, only Native Americans had lived in the area.

For a time they were not much disturbed, but the railroad was constructed into the area in 1883. More white settlers migrated into the region, looking for farming land, and joined the ranchers in older settlements bordering the Columbia River.

The Dawes Act of 1887 was part of federal legislation designed to force assimilation to European-American ways by Native Americans. Specifically, it was designed to break up the communal tribal land of Native American reservations and allot portions to individual households of tribal members, in order to encourage subsistence farming in the European-American style and familiarity with western conceptions of property. Lands declared excess by the government to this allotment were available for sale to anyone, and European Americans had been demanding more land in the West for years. Under varying conditions, Native American landowners were to be allowed to sell their plots.

Josephine Bowser Lillie was among Native Americans granted an allotment of land within the Yakama Reservation. Of mixed Native American/European ancestry and Yakama identification, she is known as &quot;The Mother of Toppenish.&quot; She platted the north of her land. These tracts became the first deeded land to be sold on the Yakama Nation Reservation.
A driving figure in Toppenish&#x27;s early development was William Leslie Shearer (October 31, 1862 – June 5, 1922). Since Toppenish had no church in 1897 Shearer obtained permission from the Northern Pacific Railroad Company and offered the freight room for religious services. Following this, he helped organize the first Methodist Church and, as trustee, was instrumental in the construction of a building that would house the church and also serve as school classrooms until a separate schoolhouse could be built. The building was completed in time for the 1898-1899 school term.

After leaving the employment of the railroad, Shearer, with Frank J. Lemon as his partner, opened Toppenish&#x27;s first drugstore in 1905. About a year later, Shearer sold out, turning his attention to the newly organized Yakima Produce and Trading company, with George Plank, A.W. McDonald and M. McDonald as partners. The company bought some acreage and leased more sagebrush land to develop the 1700-acre ranch near Satus Station. Shearer had a system of irrigation ditches constructed leading from Satus Creek to the acreage.

Toppenish was officially incorporated on April 29, 1907, and founded by Johnny Barnes. The city lies inside the boundaries of the Yakama Nation&#x27;s Reservation.

==Etymology==
&quot;Tẋápniš&quot; in the Sahaptin language of the Yakama is the likely source of the name Toppenish. The word means ‘protruded, stuck out’ and recalls a landslide that occurred on the ridge south of White Swan, Washington. According to William Bright, the name &quot;Toppenish&quot; comes from the Sahaptin word &quot;/txápniš/&quot;, referring to a landslide, from &quot;/txá-/&quot;, &quot;accidentally&quot;, &quot;/-pni-/&quot;, &quot;to launch, to take forth and out&quot;, and &quot;/-ša/&quot;, &quot;continuative present tense&quot;.

<text>Wapato () is a town in Yakima County, Washington, United States. The population was 4,607 at the 2020 census. It has a Hispanic majority.

==History==
===Origins===
The town was founded in 1885 by Indian Postmaster Alexander McCredy as a railroad stop on the Northern Pacific Railroad as Simcoe, Washington. The Dawes Severalty Act of 1887 allowed the government to subdivide the Yakama Indian Reservation tribal communal landholdings into allotments for Native American heads of families and individuals. The selling of these allotments drew settlers into the area. With the construction of the Irwin Canal in 1896, agriculture became the big business in town. In the early 1900s, McCredy and George Rankin established the Wapato Development Company and laid out the town site. They established the town&#x27;s first bank and began selling lots. In response to persistent confusion with nearby Fort Simcoe, the town changed its name to Wapato in 1903. The 1906 Jones Act further encouraged Anglos to purchase land from the Yakamas. Wapato was officially incorporated on September 16, 1908, with a population of around 300 people.

The name wapato comes from the Chinook Jargon word for an edible root, probably originally derived from the Upper Chinook language.

===Japanese and African American residents===
As early as 1905, many Japanese people also began to migrate to the city, mainly from Hawaii. From 1916 to 1918, &quot;Japanese Town&quot; developed along present-day West 2nd Street. With more than 1,000 Japanese then living in the Yakima Valley, the community soon became a center of Washington&#x27;s Japanese population, second only to Seattle. The Yakima Buddhist Bussei Kaikan (1936–1941), on West 2nd Street, was an architecturally noteworthy building built by members of the congregation.

A mob including police attacked dozens of African Americans at a railroad camp in Wapato on July 9, 1938. African American residents in town were also driven out. After World War II broke out, Wapato&#x27;s Japanese language school (which had about 200 students) and several Japanese residences were burned by arsonists. Executive Order 9066 forced the Japanese to evacuate from Wapato in 1942 and many residents were sent to internment camps.

===World War II===
During World War II, much of the labor in the orchards and fields around Wapato came from either Germans held in a POW camp between Wapato and Toppenish, or from Japanese still being held in internment camps. At the end of the war, a labor shortage created a void readily filled by Hispanic migrant workers, and the Bracero Program (a guest-worker program agreed to by the US and Mexico during World War II). These events significantly changed Wapato&#x27;s cultural history.

===Post war through today===
Through the 1970s and into 1990, Wapato produced some of the largest volume potato and apple crops, as tonnage per acre.

Today, Wapato boasts one of the most Hispanic populations in Washington State (76% in the 2000 census). In recent times both Anglo and Hispanic residents have described Wapato as a &quot;Mexican Town&quot;.

In 2012, Wapato allowed strip clubs into the city, in the words of one resident, &quot;to put Wapato on the map.&quot;

==Geography==

===Climate===

==Demographics==
For decades Wapato attracted Filipino Americans, Hispanic Americans, Japanese Americans, and Native Americans. Older white residents died and entered nursing homes in larger cities, while younger whites moved to attend school and did not return to the community. Hispanic immigrants arrived for agricultural jobs and the small town lifestyle. In 1952, the Filipino community established the Yakima Valley Filipino Community Hall in Wapato, the first facility of its kind in the Western United States. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2024.

<text>White Swan is a census-designated place (CDP) in Yakima County, Washington, United States. The population was 789 at the 2020 census.

==History==
White Swan is an unincorporated community located on the Yakama Indian Reservation, presumably named after Chief White Swan of the Yakamas around the start of the 20th century. The town was on the Mt Adams Highway (an overland road between Yakima and The Dalles beginning in the 1850s) between Union Gap and Fort Simcoe. In September 1921, the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) opened the Yakima Indian Christian Mission. In 1967, the former childcare facilities of the Mission were leased to the Sundown M Corporation. Using the registered cattle brand of the Mission (from the years it owned cattle), the Sundown M Ranch began serving recovering alcoholics in 1968. Pacific Power &amp; Light Company first brought electricity to the community in 1928. The White Swan Library (a branch of the Yakima Valley Regional library) was established in 1947. It was moved to a donated facility in 1969 where it stands today. White Swan is part of the Mt Adams School District #209, and home of White Swan High School. The town has never been formally incorporated.

<text>Zillah is a city in Yakima County, Washington, United States, with a population of 3,179 as of the 2020 census.

==History==

Zillah was founded in 1891 following the completion of the Sunnyside Canal project, an irrigation scheme delivering water from the Yakima River to the arid lower Yakima Valley. Walter Granger, superintendent of the canal company, chose the town site in 1892. The town was named for Zillah Oakes, daughter of Northern Pacific Railway president Thomas Fletcher Oakes, who had financed the canal&#x27;s construction. She was the youngest member of an expedition to scout possible townsites; allegedly, the town was named for Zillah after she had fallen into a stream with the party&#x27;s wagon and had to be consoled by her father. Granger housed the headquarters of the Washington Irrigation Company in Zillah, giving it economical advantages for a time. He also made his residency in Zillah, becoming its mayor after retiring from the irrigation company. Zillah was officially incorporated on January 5, 1911.

<text>Belington is a town in Barbour County, West Virginia, United States, situated along the Tygart Valley River. The population was 1,804 as of the 2020 census.

==History==
Belington was founded in 1766–70. Originally it was known as the Barker Settlement, after Elias Barker, who had settled there with his brother William Barker. About 1785, it was called Yeagers, taking its name from a settler, George Yeager, and his sons. In 1855, it took its current name, Belington, from John Bealin, who had opened up a store there, and who would later move to Kansas.

After the June 3, 1861 Battle of Philippi, the Confederate forces, having been routed by the Union Army in Philippi, retreated south. The Confederates made camp near the Laurel Mountain Road, today, a winding single lane dirt road that crosses the mountain and connects Belington with Elkins.

A bridge spanning the Tygart Valley River at Belington was built in 1886.

In 1891, the West Virginia Central and Pittsburg Railway (later the Western Maryland Railway) was built into Belington. In 1894 the land on the east side of the river was incorporated as Belington, while the west side was incorporated as Alston in 1897. The two towns merged in 1906 to form the present Belington.

The Bernard E. Wilmoth House in Belington is a historic house listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Philippi (&#x27;FILL-uh-pea&#x27;) is a city in and the county seat of Barbour County, West Virginia, United States, along the Tygart Valley River. The population was 2,929 at the 2020 census. In 1861, the city was the site of the Battle of Philippi, known as the &quot;Philippi Races&quot;. Although a minor skirmish, this is considered the earliest notable land action of the American Civil War. The city has a weekly newspaper, &quot;The Barbour Democrat&quot;.

==History==
===Settlement===
The first white settlement in present-day Barbour County was established approximately three miles downriver from the future site of Philippi in 1780, at which time the area was still part of western Virginia and included within Monongalia County. The earliest settlers on the section of bottomland that would one day become Philippi were William Anglin (as early as 1783 or &#x27;84) and Daniel Booth (1787). A ford existed here as early as 1789 which served the road that had recently been surveyed between Beverly and Sandy Creek. Anglin was the original owner of the land upon which Philippi stands, hence the earliest known name for the locality — Anglin&#x27;s Ford. Booth also owned and operated a commercial ferry here in the 1790s, thus the area&#x27;s second popular designation — Booth&#x27;s Ferry. William Friend Wilson married Booth&#x27;s daughter and built a wool and grain mill on the river in 1818.

In 1825, the first post office in the region (that would later become Barbour County) was established by Henson Lewis Hoff (1805-1890), an expeditious young man who had just arrived from Loudoun County. Hoff settled at Cherry Hill, just west of the current city limits of Philippi. After Hoff became the postmaster, the community that would become Philippi was known as &quot;Hoffsville&quot; and remained so until 1841 when the name &quot;Philippa&quot; was first considered.

===Founding and naming===
In March 1843, the vast Harrison and Randolph Counties of western Virginia were carved up into several smaller political units, among them Barbour County, which included Hoffsville. In 1899, Hu Maxwell described the April 1843 founding and official naming of the new county seat:

&quot;The county seat of Barbour was located at the place where Philippi now stands before there was a town and before the place was named. It was then a farm belonging to William F. Wilson, and the locality had long been known as Booth&#x27;s Ferry. The land was first the property of William Anglin, and in succession was owned by John Wilson, Daniel Booth, Ely Butcher, Elmore Hart, Thomas H. Hite and William F. Wilson, who divided it into lots and disposed of the most of it within a few years of the establishing of the county seat. The county was named after [the Virginia lawyer and jurist] Philip P. Barbour, and it was the intention of the county court when it selected a name for the town to honor the given name of Mr. Barbour; giving it the feminine form, however, in conformity with the Latin language. The feminine of Philip is Philippa, and it was meant that such should be the name of the town. But because of misspellings and a misunderstanding of the origin of the name (confounding it with Philippi, an ancient city) the name finally took the form which it now has. On April 5, 1843, the third day of the first county court, it is &#x27;ordered that the county seat of this county be known and called PHILLIPPA&#x27;. Except that the name has too many &#x27;l&#x27;s&#x27; the form was proper, according to what was originally intended. Later the name became Philippi, but even then it was oftener misspelled than spelled correctly.&quot;

As Maxwell implies, St Paul&#x27;s &quot;Epistle to the Philippians&quot; and the ancient Battle of Philippi were no doubt influential in the final form of the name. Philippi was established by charter in 1844.

In 1852 Lemuel Chenoweth, an Appalachian architect and carpenter, built a covered bridge in Philippi to provide a link on the turnpike running between Beverly and Fairmont. The Philippi Covered Bridge spelled the end of the commercial ferry operation and is still the town&#x27;s prominent landmark.

===Civil War===

Philippi was the scene of the first land battle of the American Civil War, on June 3, 1861. The battle was promptly lampooned as the &quot;Philippi Races&quot; because of the hurried retreat by the Confederate troops encamped in the town. (The battle is reenacted every June during the town&#x27;s &#x27;Blue and Gray Reunion.&#x27;)

At daylight on June 3, two columns of Union forces under the command of Col. Benjamin Franklin Kelley and Col. Ebenezer Dumont, with perhaps 3,000 men, arrived from Grafton and attacked about 800 poorly armed Confederate recruits under the command of Col. George A. Porterfield. The Union troops had marched all night through a heavy rain storm to arrive just before daylight. The surprise attack — from the heights of &quot;Battle Hill&quot; to the northwest — awakened the sleeping Confederates. After firing a few shots at the advancing Union troops, the Southerners broke lines and began running frantically to the south, some still in their bed clothes.

The Union victory in a relatively bloodless battle propelled the young Major General George B. McClellan into the national spotlight, and he was soon given command of all Union armies. The battle also inspired more vocal protests in the Western part of Virginia against secession. A few days later in Wheeling, the Wheeling Convention nullified the Virginia ordinance of secession and named Francis H. Pierpont governor. These events eventually resulted in the separate statehood of West Virginia.

===Later history===
Philippi was incorporated by act of the West Virginia Legislature on 1 February 1871. The first railroadthe Grafton and Greenbrier, a narrow-gaugearrived at Philippi on 25 January 1884. Three years later the line was extended to Belington and in 1891 it became a standard gauge when it was acquired by the B&amp;O. In 1904, citizens passed a bond issue permitting the city to begin generating electricity for the first time by gas.

In 1901, Broaddus College (founded in 1871 in Winchester, Virginia and later located in Clarksburg, West Virginia) relocated to &quot;Battle Hill&quot;, overlooking Philippi. In 1932, Broaddus merged with Alderson Academy (itself founded in 1901 in Alderson, West Virginia), whereupon these two Baptist institutions became Alderson–Broaddus College. (The institution changed its name to the current &quot;Alderson Broaddus University&quot; in 2013.)

In 1905 a new Barbour County Courthouse was completed. It was designed by J. Charles Fulton in a monumental Romanesque Revival style. The building contractor was J.P. Conn.

Rail activity at Philippi peaked in the 1920s when as many as six passenger trains, along with mail and freight, transited the town daily. The automobile brought about a decline in the local railroad service, however, and the final passenger train made its last stop in Philippi in 1956.

Throughout its history, Philippi has suffered from floods because of its proximity to the river and the relatively low elevation of most of the town. The most damaging of these came in November 1985. The town has since adopted a flood plain management plan.

On July 31, 2023, the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission revoked Alderson Broaddus University&#x27;s ability to confer degrees after the end of the year, and ordered to it cease admitting students, due to its &quot;rapidly deteriorating financial condition&quot;. On the same day, the university&#x27;s board of trustees voted to close the university.

==Geography==

Philippi is along the Tygart Valley River at (39.151569, -80.043472). It is within Philippi District — one of eight magisterial districts of Barbour County. The town is sub-divided into Wards 1 through 4.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The original settlement that became the town of Philippi was on a section of bottomland at a bend in the river at the mouth of Anglin&#x27;s Run. This area was later designated &quot;Dayton Park&quot;. Opposite this bottomland, at the western landing of &quot;Booth&#x27;s Ferry&quot;, is a sharp ridge which breaks abruptly down to the river and is still known as &quot;Nobusiness Hill&quot;. Most of the town is in the bottomland, but a portion, including the university campus, is on another ridge — &quot;Battle Hill&quot;, also called &quot;Talbott&#x27;s Hill&quot; — overlooking the valley from the northwest. To the south, a third landmark hill — &quot;Grabanickel Hill&quot; — completes the ring of high ground encircling the town.

A railroad line runs through Philippi, now used only by freight trains, passenger rail service having been discontinued in 1956. The historic 1911 passenger station has served as the Barbour County Historical Museum since the station&#x27;s restoration in 1979. The town is served by the small, private Philippi-Barbour County Regional Airport.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Philippi has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

The town&#x27;s major employers now include Battler&#x27;s Knob, on the former campus of Alderson Broaddus University which closed in 2023. and Broaddus Hospital. Many inhabitants work in the service industry, education, and family farming.

The city government provides many services and jobs to stimulate the local economy, including water, electric, garbage collection, and waste water treatment facilities. In addition, a professional police and volunteer fire department are provided. The City of Philippi was voted as a 2004 &quot;All American City&quot;.

<text>Hedgesville is a town in Berkeley County, West Virginia, United States, in the state&#x27;s Eastern Panhandle region. The population was 318 at the 2010 census. The town sits on WV 9, roughly 13 miles east of Berkeley Springs. In addition to its legal definition, Hedgesville has come to be the common name for the large and sparsely inhabited area of West Virginia&#x27;s Eastern Panhandle bordered by the Potomac River to the North and East, a southern border defined roughly by an imaginary line from the city of Martinsburg to the tip of Virginia, and Berkeley Springs to the West.

==History==
Up to the 18th Century, the area was home to the Tuscarora people. The Hedgesville area was subsequently settled by William Snodgrass, who arrived in the American colonies in 1700. William Snodgrass is buried in the cemetery of Tuscarora Presbyterian Church in Berkeley County, West Virginia.

Officially established by an act of the Virginia General Assembly on February 11, 1836, the Town of Hedgesville was laid out in 1832 along the old Warm Springs Road (now West Virginia Route 9) and named for the prominent local Hedges family. In 1854, Hedgesville was officially incorporated by the General Assembly. The act of incorporation provided for a town council consisting of seven trustees, but the act was amended in 1858 so that a mayor could be added to the council. Hedgesville is a National Register Historic District.

==Transportation==

Two primary highways serve Hedgesville. The more prominent of these is West Virginia Route 9. WV 9 travels southeastward to Martinsburg and provides connections to Interstate 81. To the northwest, WV 9 connects to U.S. Route 522 in Berkeley Springs. The other primary highway serving Hedgesville is West Virginia Route 901, which heads east from its western end at WV 9 in Hedgesville to I-81 at Falling Waters.

<text>Inwood is a census-designated place (CDP) in Berkeley County, West Virginia, United States, located south of Martinsburg in the lower Shenandoah Valley. The population was 2,954 at the 2010 census. It is located on U.S. Route 11.

==History==
In the late 1880s, coinciding with the arrival of the Cumberland Valley Railroad (CVRR) extension, a resort that became known as Inwood Park was established on the property of the Strong family of south Berkeley County, West Virginia. On May 5, 1890, the Inwood Post Office opened and the village grew around the Park. From 1892 - 1913, an annual event called the Inwood Fair was held at the Park. This event drew in the range of 7,000 - 12,000 people.

The Cumberland Valley Railroad station in Inwood also included a grain elevator, which ensured that much of the local agricultural products would be brought to Inwood to be shipped elsewhere. Other products shipped from Inwood via the CVRR were wood products, such as bark (for tanning) and railroad ties from the area west of the town. The station at Inwood was one of the most profitable stations on the CVRR line.

The town of Inwood was originally called Gerrard. There are two stories as to how the town got its name. One story is that it was named for the Park located there - Inwood Park, the park &quot;in the woods&quot; - therefore INWOOD park.

The other story is that Inwood&#x27;s name was changed when Jonathan Newton Thatcher, of Gerrard, wanted to open a post office in the town. Washington D.C. post authorities told Thatcher that he would have to rename the town of Gerrard, since it would conflict with mail going to Gerrardstown, a town 4 miles west. When Thatcher&#x27;s cousin from Inwood, California, showed him a letter with his home address on it, he decided to use the name “Inwood” for the town. He wrote to Washington D.C. to get the town&#x27;s name changed from Gerrard to Inwood and to get a post office established there. Jonathan Thatcher was the first postmaster for the new Inwood, West Virginia.

In the early years of the 20th century, a local prominent citizen and politician, Gray Silver, was instrumental in establishing a co-op among the area&#x27;s many orchardists. The principal crop among those orchardists was apples, because they were less likely to be damaged during shipment and the fact that they could last for long periods of time when stored properly. Through federal funds and the influence of Gray Silver, a school where various aspects of growing apples was established at Inwood.

Gray Silver was also instrumental in putting together a group of investors to bring a commercial apple plant to Inwood.

In 1920, the C.H. Musselman Company of Biglerville, Pennsylvania, opened an apple processing plant at Inwood. This was convenient to the many apple orchards of the Shenandoah Valley and the former Cumberland Valley Railroad, by this time part of the Pennsylvania Railroad line. By the late 1920s, the Musselman plant in Inwood exclusively produced apple sauce, the first apple processing plant of its kind.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 2,084 people, 810 households, and 596 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 733.8 people per square mile (283.3/km2). There were 849 housing units at an average density of 299.0/sq mi (115.4/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 94.19% White, 2.64% African American, 0.38% Native American, 0.96% Asian, 0.05% Pacific Islander, 0.48% from other races, and 1.30% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.30% of the population.

The average household size was 2.57 and the average family size was 2.98.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 25.7% under the age of 18, 7.4% from 18 to 24, 33.4% from 25 to 44, 23.1% from 45 to 64, and 10.4% who were 65 years of age or older.

About 2.5% of families and 4.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.1% of those under the age of 18 and 6.7% of those 65 and older.

==Companies and schools==
Inwood is home to Knouse Foods Musselman plant. The plant opened in 1920 after it was located there due to the active pursuance of local investors who contributed money to buy the property where the plant is located. It was part of the old Inwood Park.

The C.H. Musselman Plant, in 1929, became the first apple processing plant to exclusively produce canned apple sauce. It can be said the apple sauce literally put the C.H. Musselman plant and the town of Inwood on the map.

In the 1960s the Musselman company became a part of PET, Inc., and after a series of changes in ownership was bought by Knouse Foods in 1984, who continued to operate the Inwood facility until November 14, 2008.

Musselman High School, located in Inwood, was built in 1949 when the C.H. Musselman Company donated the land, materials and labor as a gift to the community. The high school first opened for the 1949–50 school year. Until the early 1980s, the Musselman Foundation, a philanthropic branch of the company, provided expansions and facilities the school needed whenever possible. The last contribution to the south Berkeley County community being the auditorium. When a new Musselman High School was built in the late 1990s, the original Musselman High School was torn down and Musselman Middle School was built on the same site.

Inwood School, now Inwood Primary School, opened in 1926 and in 1970 became a primary school with the expansion of schools in southern Berkeley County. An earlier school was located west of present-day I-81 near Inwood, and can be seen on the Berkeley County map of 1894.

In the early days of Inwood, there was a cooperage (barrel factory) in the village. East of Inwood, to this day, is a quarrying operation, taking advantage of the limestone below the ground for commercial purposes. Today, Inwood is a high growth area and serves as a bedroom community for the nearby Washington Metropolitan area.

In 2024, Philadelphia-based convenience store chain Wawa broke ground for its first West Virginia location in Inwood.

==South Berkeley Volunteer Fire Department==

The greater Inwood area is serviced by the South Berkeley Volunteer Fire Company also known as Station 20. Located at 7556 Winchester Avenue in Inwood WV, The South Berkeley Volunteer Fire Company was established in 1956 in a building located on True Apple Way by several employees of the Knauss Foods group and members of the community. With the continued growth of their service area, the Fire Company was relocated to a larger building located at 8009 Winchester Avenue. During the time at this location, the Inwood and Bunker Hill areas continued to grow in population and calls for service increased. 

In 2017 The main station was relocated into a new building that was converted from a big box store location into a brand new seven bay firehouse. Housing Two Engines, a Heavy Rescue Squad, Brush Truck, Utility and Mobile unit that is used for EMS calls.

The S.B.V.F.C. Operates in Berkeley County WV as one of five volunteer fire houses, Although as the volunteer staffing has decreased across the country, The Main station is now Staffed part time by paid staffing from Berkeley County Fire during the hours of 06:00-18:00 (6:00 P.M.) M-F.

The South Berkeley Volunteer Fire Company also operates a substation (Station 29) which houses one Engine located at 4172 Winchester Avenue, close to the end of the Runway of the 167th Air National Guard Base. 

The Motto of the South Berkeley Volunteer Fire Company is &quot;It&#x27;s All Good in Inwood&quot;, and &quot; Pride of the Southside&quot;.

<text>Martinsburg is a city in and the county seat of Berkeley County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 18,773 at the 2020 census, making Martinsburg the largest city in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia and the sixth-most populous city in the state. It is a principal city of the Hagerstown–Martinsburg metropolitan area extending into Maryland, which had 293,844 residents in 2020.

==History==
Martinsburg was established by an act of the Virginia General Assembly that was adopted in December 1778 during the American Revolutionary War. Founder Major General Adam Stephen named the gateway town to the Shenandoah Valley along Tuscarora Creek in honor of Colonel Thomas Bryan Martin, a nephew of Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron.

Aspen Hall, a Georgian mansion, is the oldest house in the city. Part was built in 1745 by Edward Beeson, Sr. Aspen Hall, and its wealthy residents had key roles in the agricultural, religious, transportation, and political history of the region. Significant events related to the French and Indian War, the Revolution, and the Civil War took place on the property. Three original buildings are still standing, including the rare blockhouse of Mendenhall&#x27;s Fort.

The first United States post office in what is now West Virginia was established at Martinsburg in 1792. At that time, Martinsburg and the larger territory were still part of Virginia.

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) reached Martinsburg in 1842. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Martinsburg Shops were constructed in 1849 and rebuilt after the American Civil War.

According to William Still, &quot;The Father of the Underground Railroad&quot; and its historian: Mr Robert Brown, alias Thomas Jones, escaped from slavery in Martinsburg on Christmas night in 1856. He rode a horse and had it swim across the freezing Potomac River. After riding forty miles, he walked in cold wet clothes for two days, to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He received assistance there from the Underground Railroad and traveled by train to Philadelphia, and the office of William Still with the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society. Brown&#x27;s wife and four children had been sold; he sought help to find them. He had a likeness of his wife, and locks of hair from each of them. 

===Civil war===
In 1854, ten-year-old Isabelle Boyd, known as &quot;Belle&quot; and later a noted spy for the Confederacy, moved to Martinsburg with her family, where her father Benjamin operated a general merchandise store. After the Civil War began, Benjamin joined the Second Virginia Infantry, which was part of the Stonewall Brigade. His wife Mary was thus in charge of the Boyd home when Union forces under General Robert Patterson took Martinsburg. When a group of Patterson&#x27;s men tried to raise a Union flag over the Boyd home, Mary refused. One of the soldiers, Frederick Martin, threatened Mary, and Belle shot him. She was acquitted.

She soon became involved in espionage, sending information to Confederate generals Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson and J.E.B. &quot;Jeb&quot; Stuart. Often she was helped by Eliza Corsey, a Boyd family slave whom Belle had taught to read and write. In 1863, Belle was arrested in Martinsburg by the Union Army and imprisoned. Boyd&#x27;s Greek Revival home, which he had built in 1853 and sold in 1855, had numerous owners over the decades. In 1992 it was purchased by the Berkeley County Historical Society. The historical society renovated the building and now operates it as the Berkeley County Museum. It is also known as the Belle Boyd House.

===Reconstruction===
Residents of West Virginia were split in their allegiance during the war, with half of its soldiers serving in the Confederate army. The vote to create a new state in western Virginia was very low, but statehood was approved by Congress and President Lincoln, and the new state was admitted to the Union on June 20, 1863.

The city of Martinsburg was incorporated by an act of the new West Virginia Legislature on March 30, 1868.

Martinsburg became a center of the railroad industry and its workers. The Great Railroad Strike of 1877 began July 14, 1877, in this city at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Martinsburg Shops. After several unsuccessful attempts to quell the protests, Governor Henry M. Mathews called for federal troops. By the time these troops had restored order, the protest of the rail company had spread across the country.

Telephone service was established in Martinsburg in 1883. In 1889, electricity began to be furnished to Martinsburg as part of a franchise granted to the United Edison Manufacturing Company of New York.

The Interwoven Mills began operations in Martinsburg in 1891.

Construction of the Apollo Civic Theatre was completed in 1913.

===World War I and beyond===
Over one thousand (1,039) men from Berkeley County participated in World War I. Of these, forty-one were killed, and twenty-one were wounded in battle. A monument to those who fell in battle was erected in Martinsburg in 1925.

During World War II, the Newton D. Baker Hospital in Martinsburg treated thousands of soldiers wounded in the war. In 1946 this military hospital became a part of the Veterans Administration (VA). The VA Medical Center in Martinsburg still provides care to United States veterans.

Due to restructuring beginning in the late 1940s and continuing through the 1970s, many of the mills and factories operating in Martinsburg shut down and went out of business, dealing a major blow to the local economy. Jobs were moved to the Deep South and later offshore.

== Sports ==
Major League Baseball Hall of Famer Hack Wilson began his storied professional career in his adopted hometown with the Martinsburg Blue Sox, a low-level minor-league baseball team. Wilson would go on to set the yet-to-be-broken major league record for RBI in a season (191) with the Chicago Cubs in 1930.

After his playing career ended in 1935, Hack went back home to Martinsburg, played some ball with the town&#x27;s semipro team and opened a recreation and pool hall in town with a partner. He later moved to Baltimore in 1941 where he later died November 23, 1948. Originally scheduled to be interred in Baltimore, Wilson was buried — in a donated plot — in Martinsburg,

<text>Madison is a city and former coal town in Boone County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 2,911 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Boone County.

==History==
Madison was first established as Boone Court House. The town was renamed &quot;circa&quot; 1865, presumably for James Madison, the fourth president of the United States. Other theories hold that it was named for lawyer James Madison Laidley or for William Madison Peyton, a pioneer coal operator, who was a leader in the movement which resulted in the formation of Boone County and for whom Peytona on Big Coal River was also named. Madison was incorporated in 1906.

The first courthouse at Madison, a log structure, was burned by Union troops early in the Civil War. The second courthouse, made of local brick, served until 1913, and a frame building was used by county officials for the next several years. The present Boone County Courthouse, occupied in 1921, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Madison is the &quot;Gateway to the Coalfields,&quot; as it is located on a principal route through the southern coalfields. It occupied a strategic place during the Mine Wars. Miners twice rallied at the town ballpark in August 1921, to consider whether to continue their march to neighboring Logan and Mingo counties. Thousands of armed marchers passed through the town and surrounding region on their way to and from the fighting at Blair Mountain, which is located up Spruce Fork from Madison.

In addition to the Boone County Courthouse, the Madison National Bank building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The WV Coal Festival has taken place in Madison each June since 1994.

==Geography==
Madison is located at (38.061816, -81.818216). The Little Coal River is formed at Madison by the confluence of its Spruce Fork and its Pond Fork.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Later, the line was taken over by Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and Flatwoods was a halfway point on the B&amp;O Railroad&#x27;s Clarksburg-Richwood branch, approximately 62.6 miles from the Clarksburg terminal, and 59.1 miles from the Richwood terminal. The town also served as the origin of West Virginia &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad&#x27;s Sutton Branch.

The community became nationally known for the Flatwoods monster UFO incident which occurred on September 12, 1952.

The town was laid out in 1904, and over the next decade, businesses and infrastructure such as hotels, a bank, stores, schools, a hospital, office buildings and churches appeared to serve the growing population. By 1915, the Coal &amp; Coke Railway Company had completed work on a depot to facilitate passenger service to the town.

<text>Sutton is a town in Braxton County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 876 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Braxton County. Sutton is situated at a center of transportation in West Virginia. Interstate 79, a major north–south route, connects with Appalachian Corridor L (U.S. Route 19), another significant north–south route, passes several miles south of town.

==History==
Sutton was settled in 1792 by Adam O&#x27;Brien, from Bath County, Virginia. In 1809, John D. Sutton settled at the confluence of Granny&#x27;s Creek and the Elk River, at the edge of the present town. The village of Suttonville, formerly known as Newville, was laid out in 1835. When Braxton County was formed in 1836, the first court was held in the home of John D. Sutton.

Sutton was a transportation hub. In addition to the navigable Elk River, the Weston and Gauley Bridge Turnpike connected the Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike to the James River and Kanawha Turnpike, via Sutton. A suspension bridge was constructed on the Weston and Gauley Bridge Turnpike across the Elk River at Sutton in 1853. Railroads also served the town of Sutton, with the Sutton Branch connecting to the West Virginia and Pittsburgh Railroad at Flatwoods, West Virginia via McNutt (near the area now called Laurel Court), a path that would later be used by West Virginia State Route 4. Another branch that ran along the southeastern bank of the Elk River joined the Coal and Coke Railway six miles to the east at Gassaway.

Due to its location, Sutton was embroiled in the American Civil War. On September 5, 1861, the town was occupied by 5,000 Union troops. Later in 1861, General William Rosecrans bivouacked 10,000 Union troops there, including future President William McKinley. On December 29, 1861, Confederate soldiers burned most of the downtown.

Sutton slowly rebuilt but remained small until the local timber industry boomed. The town then became a commercial center, and many of the banks, hotels, shops, and other historic buildings in the Sutton Downtown Historic District date from this 1890–1920 period. After this, Sutton once again slowed in development. Sutton Dam was built on the Elk River upstream from the town in 1961, adding a tourism component to the local economy.

The William Edgar Haymond House and Old Sutton High School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, along with the historic district.

==Geography==
Sutton is located at (38.664437, -80.710172), along the Elk River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The Sutton Lake project was authorized by Congress in the Flood Control Act of 1938. Construction began in October 1949, but was interrupted by the Korean War. Work resumed in 1956 and in the dam was finally completed in 1961. The Dam and lake provide opportunities for boating, picnicking, playgrounds, camping and pavilions available for rent. A handicap-access fishing area was also recently constructed at the Sutton Dam.

The geographic center of West Virginia is located just four miles east of Sutton.

<doc id="138378" wikidata="Q2757856" url="?curid=138378" title="Splitting lemma">
<text>In mathematics, and more specifically in homological algebra, the splitting lemma states that in any abelian category, the following statements are equivalent for a short exact sequence 
: formula_1
If any of these statements holds, the sequence is called a [[split exact sequence]], and the sequence is said to &quot;split&quot;.

In the above short exact sequence, where the sequence splits, it allows one to refine the first isomorphism theorem, which states that:
: (i.e., isomorphic to the coimage of or cokernel of )
to:
where the first isomorphism theorem is then just the projection onto .

It is a categorical generalization of the rank–nullity theorem (in the form in linear algebra.

==Proof for the category of abelian groups==

=== and ===
First, to show that 3. implies both 1. and 2., we assume 3. and take as the natural projection of the direct sum onto , and take as the natural injection of into the direct sum.
To prove that 1. implies 3., first note that any member of &quot;B&quot; is in the set (). This follows since for all in , ; is in , and is in , since 

Next, the intersection of and is 0, since if there exists in such that , and , then ; and therefore, .

This proves that is the direct sum of and . So, for all in , can be uniquely identified by some in , in , such that .

By exactness . The subsequence implies that is onto; therefore for any in there exists some such that . Therefore, for any &quot;c&quot; in &quot;C&quot;, exists &quot;k&quot; in ker &quot;t&quot; such that &quot;c&quot; = &quot;r&quot;(&quot;k&quot;), and &quot;r&quot;(ker &quot;t&quot;) = &quot;C&quot;.

If , then is in ; since the intersection of and , then . Therefore, the restriction is an isomorphism; and is isomorphic to .

Finally, is isomorphic to due to the exactness of ; so &quot;B&quot; is isomorphic to the direct sum of and , which proves (3).
To show that 2. implies 3., we follow a similar argument. Any member of is in the set ; since for all in , , which is in . The intersection of and is , since if and , then .

By exactness, , and since is an injection, is isomorphic to , so is isomorphic to . Since is a bijection, is an injection, and thus is isomorphic to . So is again the direct sum of and .

An alternative &quot;abstract nonsense&quot; proof of the splitting lemma may be formulated entirely in category theoretic terms.

==Non-abelian groups==
In the form stated here, the splitting lemma does not hold in the full category of groups, which is not an abelian category.

===Partially true===
It is partially true: if a short exact sequence of groups is left split or a direct sum (1. or 3.), then all of the conditions hold. For a direct sum this is clear, as one can inject from or project to the summands. For a left split sequence, the map gives an isomorphism, so is a direct sum (3.), and thus inverting the isomorphism and composing with the natural injection gives an injection splitting (2.).

However, if a short exact sequence of groups is right split (2.), then it need not be left split or a direct sum (neither 1. nor 3. follows): the problem is that the image of the right splitting need not be normal. What is true in this case is that is a semidirect product, though not in general a direct product.

===Counterexample===
To form a counterexample, take the smallest non-abelian group , the symmetric group on three letters. Let denote the alternating subgroup, and let }. Let and denote the inclusion map and the sign map respectively, so that

: formula_2

is a short exact sequence. 3. fails, because is not abelian, but 2. holds: we may define by mapping the generator to any two-cycle. Note for completeness that 1. fails: any map must map every two-cycle to the identity because the map has to be a group homomorphism, while the order of a two-cycle is 2 which can not be divided by the order of the elements in &quot;A&quot; other than the identity element, which is 3 as is the alternating subgroup of , or namely the cyclic group of order 3. But every permutation is a product of two-cycles, so is the trivial map, whence is the trivial map, not the identity.

Barboursville is home to the Huntington Mall, which is the largest indoor mall in the state of West Virginia, with more than 1.5 million square feet of retail space. Billy Bob&#x27;s Wonderland is opened on the outskirts of the Mall. Another busy retail area in Barboursville is the Merritt&#x27;s Creek Farm Shopping Center just off I-64 Exit 18.

There have been two recently announced major retail developments for the Barboursville area. In 2015, Interstate Realty of Bristol, Tennessee, announced plans to construct a new retail development named Tanyard Station. The development will be built on a 52-acre site that was formerly a CSX rail yard along US Route 60. It is slated to be one of the largest retail developments ever built in Cabell County with over 400,000 square feet of planned retail space. It will be home to approximately 20 restaurants and retailers, including a grocery store, hotel, bank, gas station, and many others. Since its announcement, the development has been plagued by many delays and setbacks including an endangered bat species being found on the property. To accommodate the development, US Route 60 will be widened and intersection upgrades will be made and will include installation of several new traffic lights and signals. An official groundbreaking for the development was held on October 16, 2017.

The settlement was originally called Lewisport, but Davis later supposedly suggested the name of &quot;West Union&quot;, in deference to a proposed town of Union to be built on the eastern side of Middle Island Creek. (Union has disappeared, if it ever existed.) According to an early resident, A.A. Bee: &quot;The first bridge across Middle Island Creek [at West Union] was of hewed logs with a center abutment of stones. In the great flood of 1835 it was washed away&quot;. In 1842, a contract was awarded to the well-known civil engineer Claudius Crozet to build a new covered bridge at West Union, as part of a series of public works along the Northwestern Turnpike. Ephraim Bee (1802–1888), a local blacksmith (who was also a district officer, magistrate, state legislator, hotelier, and postmaster at various times) made all the bolts and bands for the West Union Covered Bridge which was completed in 1843.

On the night of March 27, 1858, a fire utterly devastated the town of West Union. At the time, many of the citizens were attending the U.S. court at Clarksburg, and so were not available for fire suppression efforts. The fire originated in an upper room of the residence of Lathrop Russell Charter. The flames spread quickly to other buildings: first, a large hotel and store room belonging to James A. Foley. Next came the residence of Ethelbert Bond and a storehouse belonging to Arthur Ingram. Other buildings followed and the next morning the entire settlement appeared a &quot;mass of smoldering ruins&quot;. The Parkersburg and Grafton branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad had just been completed, however, and the town was able to revive economically and structurally fairly quickly.

Nearby Maxwell Ridge — named for the family of Congressman Maxwell — is said to have a cave that was used by the Underground Railroad in the years leading up to the Civil War.

West Union was home to Matthew M. Neely, grandfather of West Virginia&#x27;s 21st governor. Governor Matthew M. Neely, also a US Senator, was born in 1874 just south of the town.

West Union was incorporated on July 20, 1881.

===20th century===
Doddridge County&#x27;s oil and gas industry was a boon to West Union. By 1906, the Ideal Glass Factory opened to take advantage of the abundant gas. It was followed by the Doddridge County Window Glass Company. The two plants employed about 300 people. In later years a garment factory opened, but closed in the 1970s. A long-remembered flood devastated West Union in June 1950, destroying homes and businesses and killing 22 people throughout the county. (One casualty was the 107-year-old covered bridge.)

Today farming, timbering, oil and gas, and the business of county government and public education support the area, and many people commute to jobs in Salem, Clarksburg, and Parkersburg, or to the North Central Regional Jail in Greenwood.

The Lathrop Russell Charter House, Doddridge County Courthouse, Silas P. Smith Opera House, and W. Scott Stuart House are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places. West Union is also home to two nationally recognized historic districts: West Union Downtown Historic District and West Union Residential Historic District.

<text>Ansted is a town in Fayette County in the U.S. state of West Virginia. The population was 1,404 at the 2010 census. It is situated on high bluffs along U.S. Route 60 on a portion of the Midland Trail (a National Scenic Byway) near Hawks Nest overlooking the New River far below.

==History==

===Native Americans, European settlers, Fayette County===
The area of what is now southern West Virginia was long a hunting ground for nomadic tribes of Native-Americans before the arrival of Europeans in the 17th century. Around 1790, the area now known as Ansted was settled by a group of Baptists who did not hold legal title to the land. These people were known as &quot;squatters&quot;, and built the Hopewell Baptist Church nearby. In 1792, a 400-acre (1.6 km2) tract of land in the area was patented to Charles Skaggs.

Named in honor of the Marquis de la Fayette, a major hero of the American Revolutionary War, Fayette County, Virginia was created in 1831. The first county court was held that same year at Miles Manser&#x27;s general store which stood nearby Ansted&#x27;s current location along the James River and Kanawha Turnpike, an early roadway built to connect the canals on the James and Kanawha Rivers. The area was known at that time as Mountain Cove. At various times, it has also been known as Woodville, New Haven, and Westlake.

===American Civil War===

During the American Civil War, Fayette County became strategic for both Union and Confederate efforts. Nearby Gauley Bridge, a covered bridge carrying the James River and Kanawha Turnpike, was taken and retaken three times in 1861 and 1862; its spectacular burning was long-remembered in the community. During the winter of 1861–62, the Union Army&#x27;s Chicago Gray Dragoons (later, Companies H and I of the 12th Illinois Cavalry) made the Halfway House (Tyree Tavern) in what is now Ansted their headquarters. Confederate General Robert E. Lee maintained headquarters on nearby Sewell Mountain, where he first met &quot;Traveller&quot;, whom Lee later purchased, becoming his most famous horse. The Chicago Dragoons had a strong religious orientation and ties to Chicago&#x27;s Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association (YMCA). Many Union troops felt they were fighting the moral issue of slavery, although many Fayette County citizens had Confederate sympathies and so sent no delegate to the Wheeling Convention. Nonetheless, the area became part of the new State of West Virginia when it was formed in 1863. Local lore includes romances between the local girls and the young soldiers from Illinois. Some couples married, built homes and raised families in the Mountain State after hostilities ended.

===Post-war: railroads, coal mining, Ansted laid out===
Around 1872, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway added a new line, on both sides of the narrow New River valley, creating a through route to the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. The final spike in this portion of the C&amp;O was placed at Hawks Nest Station, just below Ansted, on January 29, 1873.
Also in 1873, the town of Ansted was created and named after British scientist and geologist, Dr. David T. Ansted (1814–1880), who in 1853, mapped out the nearby seams of high grade bituminous coal and once owned the land under the town. Former Confederate Colonel George W. Imboden, a wealthy lawyer from Augusta County, Virginia and brother of Confederate General John D. Imboden (under whom George Imboden fought with the 18th Virginia Cavalry) laid out the town. Imboden had begun speculating in coal lands in southern West Virginia after the war&#x27;s end, and attracted British investors. Dr. Ansted, a noted geologist, had been engaged to investigate the region&#x27;s potential for coal deposits, and his report far exceeded Imboden&#x27;s best expectations. Ansted and Imboden bought more than a thousand acres (4 km2) of coal and timber land on Gauley Mountain between Hawks Nest and the town of Westlake. They organized the Gauley-Kanawha Coal Company, Ltd., in 1872 and in 1873 opened a mine about above the river and below the summit of Gauley Mountain. The company changed its name to Hawks Nest Coal Company, Ltd., in 1875, and was reorganized in bankruptcy in 1889 as the Gauley Mountain Coal Company.

Colonel Imboden, who was Ansted&#x27;s first mayor, helped stimulate the growth of the town&#x27;s businesses. His second wife, Angie, renamed their family home &quot;Contentment&quot; because she and her family spent many happy hours there. Contentment had been built about 1830 on the James River and Kanawha Turnpike in the west end of what is now Ansted, and they acquired it in 1872.

Another of the town&#x27;s more well-known residents was William Nelson Page, (1854–1932). A civil engineer, protégé of Dr. Ansted, and mining manager, Page helped develop West Virginia&#x27;s rich bituminous coal fields in the late 19th and early 20th century. Page also was co-founder and builder of the Virginian Railway. In 1898, on a knoll in the middle of town, Page had a palatial mansion built by Gauley Mountain Coal Company carpenters, where he and his wife Emma Gilham Page raised their four children. Like Colonel Imboden, William Page also served as Ansted&#x27;s mayor for 10 years, although his title of &quot;Colonel&quot; was honorific (despite post-war involvement in the West Virginia State Militia). The railroad towns of Page and Pageton in West Virginia were named for him.

===Railroad to tunnel disaster to tourism===
Ansted had railroad service from 1874 until 1972. In 1874, mine owners had a narrow-gauge railroad built from Hawks Nest Station up the ravine of Mill Creek. A saddleback locomotive was used. In 1889, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) purchased the narrow-gauge railroad and contracted with William Page to do the work to upgrade the line to standard gauge, which was completed on August 20, 1890.

The (C&amp;O) operated the new branch line, which was known as the Hawks Nest Subdivision, from 1890 until 1972. It connected with the New River Subdivision main line at Hawks Nest Station and consisted of of line to and beyond the town of Ansted. The line had one of the steepest grades of any C&amp;O branch, a 4.17% grade. C &amp; O did not want to transport passengers on the line, but the State of West Virginia ordered it to do so as a condition of licensing. The company appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which in &quot;Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Company v. Public Service Commission of State of West Virginia&quot;, 242 U.S. 603 (1917), upheld the state&#x27;s authority. Passenger service then began and continued until some time in the 1930s. The branch line&#x27;s freight rail service ended in 1972 and the tracks were removed.

Also in the 1930s, developers of hydroelectric power for the Union Carbide plant at Alloy, West Virginia, the Kanawha and New River Power Company, decided to divert the New River through a three-mile tunnel under Hawks Nest. Many of the 3000 workers building the tunnel were asked to mine the silica they encountered for use in steel production. Never given protective equipment (although managers wore protective breathing apparatus during visits), hundreds developed silicosis, some so severe that they died within a year. After congressional hearings, the Hawks Nest Tunnel Disaster led to recognition of occupational lung disease as well as compensation legislation, as acknowledged by a historical marker on the site. It also became the subject of several books as well as historical fiction.

Today, the Ansted–Hawks Nest Rail Trail follows the route from the Town of Ansted down the steep mountainside to near Hawks Nest Station in the New River Valley. The trail is in length and the aerial tram from Hawks Nest Lodge links to the terminus.

==Historical sites and attractions==

Angie and George Imboden&#x27;s 1830 home, Contentment, has become the Contentment Historical Complex, headquarters for the Fayette County Historical Society. It includes a historical museum and restored one-room schoolhouse, furnished as the mid-nineteenth century.

The mansion of William and Emma Page and their family on the hilltop in Ansted also still stands as evidence of the once-thriving coal business. Later occupied by the family of Dr. Gene Vawter, and still in use as a private residence, the Page-Vawter House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Other historical landmarks include the Halfway House, the former Tyree&#x27;s Tavern which was headquarters of the Chicago Gray Dragoons during the American Civil War, and the African American Heritage Family-Tree Museum, which helps African-Americans trace their roots.

The grave of Julia Neale Jackson, mother of Confederate General Thomas Stonewall Jackson, is located in Westlake Cemetery in Ansted. The marker was placed more than 35 years after her death by Capt. Thomas Davis Ranson, one of the soldiers of the Stonewall Brigade, to mark his troops&#x27; affection for their fallen leader.

Ansted has the distinction of having Hawks Nest State Park located within its borders. The park at Hawks Nest features a small museum and gift shop, an aerial tram ride to the New River Gorge, and spectacular overlooks including the famous &quot;Lover&#x27;s Leap&quot;.

U.S. Route 60 threads through the community as part of the Midland Trail, a National Scenic Byway.

Ansted hosts the Country Roads Festival each September and the Festival of Lights over the Christmas holiday season, a time when the Fayetteville theater produces an annual holiday play. Ansted also hosted annual Street Luge PRO-AM in the late 1990s, a competition on the largest hill in the area, Gauley Mountain. The course was a mile long with a 90 degree turn at the base of the mountain. The Mystery Hole is a attraction where mysterious things are said to happen such as making brooms stand on their bristles year round.

In the early 2000s the county&#x27;s largest flagpole and American Flag was built in the town, which added in 2007 a war memorial through donations, that has the name, rank, and period served of some local military veterans.

<text>Fayetteville is a town in and the county seat of Fayette County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 2,887 at the 2020 census.

Fayetteville lies adjacent to the New River Gorge National Park and Preserve and is directly south of the New River Gorge Bridge. Fayetteville was listed as one of the 2006 &quot;Top 10 Coolest Small Towns in America&quot; by &quot;Budget Travel Magazine&quot;, and as &quot;Best River Town 2013&quot; by &quot;Blue Ridge Outdoors&quot; magazine.

== History ==

Fayetteville was founded as Vandalia by Abraham Vandall, a Revolutionary War veteran and local farmer, on farmland that Vandall owned. In 1837, the county seat of government was moved from New Haven in the Mountain Cove District to Vandalia. Later, the town&#x27;s name was changed to Fayetteville after the Revolutionary War hero, Marquis de Lafayette who toured the US in 1824–25.

During the Civil War, the majority of the people in Fayetteville were in sympathy with the Confederacy. With neighboring counties being predominantly Unionist, however, Fayetteville changed hands several times during the war and was partially destroyed during the fighting.
In 1897, the Fayette County Courthouse was completed on part of the original Vandall farm and was a remarkable example of the Romanesque Revival architectural style. The Altamont Hotel was built the same year. Both are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, along with the E. B. Hawkins House. The Fayetteville Historic District was designated in 1990.
Fayetteville grew rapidly in the late 19th century thanks mainly to the coal industry. The mining industry declined in the late 20th century. Fayetteville&#x27;s economy now is almost completely based on the tourism industry. Popular activities include white water rafting, fishing, mountain biking, and rock climbing in the region. Also, the New River Gorge Bridge hosts the annual celebration, &quot;Bridge Day,&quot; which is held on the third Saturday of October.

The New River Gorge Bridge is the longest arch bridge in the western hemisphere; its creation made traveling on US 19 much easier, turning a 45-minute sojourn from one side of the gorge to the other into a roughly 45-second jaunt. The New River is one of the five oldest major rivers in the world.

==Geography==
Fayetteville is located at (38.051181, -81.106961).

The New River offers Class I-IV whitewater rafting and kayaking. Hiking and biking trails in the area are also available. The New River Gorge National Park and Preserve, managed by the U.S. National Park Service, operates a visitors center and offers many educational programs in the area.

<text>Meadow Bridge is a town in Fayette County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 379 at the 2010 census. The first settler of the area was John Gwin, closely followed by Dan Griffin.

The community took its name from a nearby bridge over Meadow Creek.

==History==

Sometime in 1890, the first Meadow Bridge post office was established, and gave the area the name of Montrode. This was later changed to Clute, after the Virginia lumberman Theodore Clute, who came with the railroad to establish a sawmill in the area. With the help of the Meadow River Lumber company, and Theodore Clute, millions of feet of lumber were cut, and soon a town sprang up with shops and houses.

With industry in Meadow Bridge, on July 26, 1920, it was incorporated into an official town. Although industry came to the small town of Meadow Bridge, progress was slow and arduous. After several years of hard fighting, in 1924, they finally were able to bring a high school to the town, Meadow Bridge High School.

Part of their troubles was that they were isolated from the rest of Fayette County. That changed in 1937, when a seven-mile stretch of road was hard-surfaced, linking Meadow Bridge and the nearby town of Danese. In 1938, a road linking the town of Hinton and Rainelle ran through Meadow Bridge, linking all the towns together and, by extension, to Route 41. This finally gave Meadow Bridge a path to the western part of Fayette County.

==Industry==

In 1908, the Meadow River Lumber Company made a 20-mile stretch of track down to Meadow Bridge. Most say that this was the true beginning of Meadow Bridge becoming a town. After their purchase, the Hutchinson Lumber Company purchased a large tract of timberland in 1913.

<text>Mount Hope is a city in Fayette County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 1,414 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Early settlers came to Mount Hope to begin mining coal. Coal miners in Mount Hope continued to thrive for about 250 years, but ending due to the rise of mining in the Mid-west and closing entirely during the depression. 

Prior to the arrival of Europeans in Mount Hope, the land was used primarily by Native Americans for centuries until William Blake, Sr. became the first white settler in the area. During this time Blake built a Hotel, The Old Blake Inn, in order to house travelers and coal miners on their way through Mount Hope. Between the 1890s and 1930s, Mount Hope&#x27;s population and economy were booming. Until a Tragic fire (The Mount Hope Fire) occurred in 1910, destroying the majority of the town, Including the Old Blake Inn, and leaving only a few buildings standing.

With the help of the town, Mount Hope had been rebuilt, the Old Blake Inn was completely destroyed but another Inn was built in its place and managed to reopen under the name &quot;Hotel Mount Hope&quot; and became a hot spot for the miners in the area. At this time, Mount Hope continued to prosper. But it did not last long. The population of Mount Hope started to decline due to the start of the Great Depression. Unfortunately, The town Mount Hope had a hard time recovering from the Depression. Hotel Mount Hope shut down and opened again as the &quot;New River Hotel&quot;, a hotel for businessmen traveling through the town. The Hotel was completely renovated at this time and opened under yet another name &quot;The Mountainair Hotel&quot;. But inevitably closed again. 

Today, Mount Hope&#x27;s population continues to decline, leaving it much of a ghost town. The Hotel had been left vacant for some time but has since been bought and renamed the &quot;Cottle Mountainair&quot; by Joyce and Harvey Cottle, who have spent their time and dedication to renovate and reopen the Hotel as a space for family and community to come together. Joyce and Harvey currently rent out a room on the First floor to &quot;Heart to Hands The Serendipity Shop&quot;, a local reiki and holistic shop that occasionally hosts events inside of the hotel.
The community took its name from the local Mount Hope School.

<doc id="138395" wikidata="Q3313681" url="?curid=138395" title="Thurmond, West Virginia">
<text>Thurmond is a town in Fayette County, West Virginia, United States, on the New River. The population was five at the 2020 census. During the heyday of coal mining in the New River Gorge, Thurmond was a prosperous town with a number of businesses and facilities for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway.

Most of Thurmond is owned by the National Park Service for the New River Gorge National Park and Preserve. The C&amp;O passenger railway depot in town was renovated in 1995 and now functions as a Park Service visitor center. The entire town is a designated historic district on the National Register of Historic Places.

Thurmond is the least-populous municipality in West Virginia. During the city elections on June 14, 2005, six of the city&#x27;s seven residents sought elected office.

==History==

Thurmond was incorporated in 1900 and was named for Captain W. D. Thurmond, who settled here in 1844. He received the 73-acre site in 1873 as payment for a surveying job. He served in the Confederate Army and died in 1910 at age 90. Thurmond post office was established in 1888 and discontinued in 1995. The community remained small until Thomas G McKell of Glen Jean negotiated with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway for a crossing at Dunloup Creek in 1892.

W. D. Thurmond banned alcohol from his lands, which comprised the originally incorporated portion of the town. The Dun Glen Hotel was just outside the incorporated portion. A district called &quot;Ballyhack&quot; or &quot;Balahack&quot; on the south side near the Dun Glen became notorious as Thurmond&#x27;s red light district.

Two hotels were in the town; one was called the Lafayette (known locally as the &quot;Lay-flat&quot;), which was close to the railroad, and the 100-room Dun Glen, which opened in 1901, became a nationally known resort. It burned down in 1930. The Thurmond National Bank (owned by Thurmond) closed in 1931, and the New River Bank (owned by the McKells) moved to Oak Hill in 1935. The decline continued into the 1950s when locomotives changed from steam to diesel, which could travel much longer distances and did not need to stop for coal and water refilling at Thurmond. The second decline to hit Thurmond was in the late 1980s, when the National Park Service began purchasing homes and properties, voluntarily, with the promise of turning the Town into a living history museum.

==Historic district==
The Thurmond Historic District comprises the entire town and a small portion of the opposite riverbank. Thurmond was accessible solely by rail until 1921. The town occupies a narrow stretch of flat land along the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway track, with no road between the tracks and the town. Instead, a single-lane road crosses the New River on a single-track railroad bridge, crosses the main line, and climbs the hill behind the town so that it parallels the town 150 feet higher on the hill before dropping down next to the tracks. Due to its strategic position on the rail line, the commercial center thrived despite the absence of a road.

In the residential portion of the town, housing types are standardized, with three or four basic types corresponding to different positions in the railroad hierarchy. The commercial district, while lacking a street for much of its history, boasted two hotels, two banks, and a number of other commercial buildings. The railroad station was built in 1888, while a railyard and shops served the extensive branch line network which carried coal out of the hills.

The town once had a population of several hundred, which has dwindled to fewer than a dozen. The railroad depot is now a visitor center for New River Gorge National Park and Preserve.

==Geography==
Thurmond&#x27;s level land is almost entirely consumed by CSX (formerly the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway) operations. Apart from a strip of commercial buildings that front directly onto the train tracks with no intervening street, the remainder of the town climbs the hill behind the bottomland. Thurmond was an important switching center for the C&amp;O, a place where short trains from mines in the area were assembled into longer trains for shipment to markets on the main line.

==Demographics==

==In popular culture==
The town was the filming location for John Sayles&#x27; 1987 movie &quot;Matewan&quot; since it still possesses many of the characteristics of a 1920s Appalachian coal town. The events took place in Matewan, West Virginia, which borders the Kentucky state line about 100 miles away.

W. D. Thurmond banned alcohol from his lands, which comprised the originally incorporated portion of the town. The McKell family, though, had no such scruples, and their Dun Glen Hotel on McKell land just to the east of the Thurmond land became notorious for hosting a 14-year-long card party claimed by &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not&quot; to be the world&#x27;s longest-lasting poker game.

<text>Glenville is a town in and the county seat of Gilmer County, West Virginia, United States, along the Little Kanawha River. The population was 1,128 at the 2020 census. It is the home of Glenville State University.

==History==
In the late 1700s and early 1800s, pioneers began settling in the area they called ‘‘the Ford’’ because it was a place where travelers could cross the river. Later, the community was named Glenville because of its location in a glen. The first grist mill in present-day Gilmer County was constructed there in 1812. The first courthouse was completed in 1850, the second in 1872, and the current courthouse in 1923. Glenville was incorporated in 1856.

Before the 1930s, the Little Kanawha River’s commercial traffic dominated the town’s economy. Road construction contributed to the demise of riverboating by the late 1930s. The natural gas and oil industry rose to prominence after oil was struck in 1875 at nearby Letter Gap. Glenville is now the headquarters of several oil and gas firms. The 1985 flood devastated the downtown, leading many businesses to move to the higher Hays City neighborhood at the main highway intersection.

The Little Kanawha Valley Bank was incorporated in 1901. Its small frame building, covered in pressed metal, is now on the National Register of Historic Places. By 1906, the First National Bank of Glenville and the Glenville Banking and Trust Company had also been created. Glenville is now served by United Bank and a branch of Calhoun Banks of Grantsville.

Early Methodist circuit riders and Baptist missionaries brought their respective forms of worship to Glenville early in the 19th century. The Presbyterian Church was organized in 1847; the First Baptist Church, 1850; and Trinity United Methodist Church, 1896. Several other churches also serve the area today. Glenville has a golf club and recreation center, among several other facilities built at the old county poor farm.

In 1885, the &quot;Glenville Crescent&quot; first published Ellen King’s poem, ‘‘The West Virginia Hills,’’ which later became the official state song. While this newspaper didn&#x27;t survive, the &quot;Glenville Pathfinder&quot; (1892) and the &quot;Glenville Democrat&quot; (1904) have.

The flood of 1985 devastated all of Glenville. A late season tropical storm named Juan moved North leaving abundant moisture over the Southeast. On Sunday, November 3, another storm formed in Southeastern Georgia. This new storm tapped into the moisture left by Juan. By November 4, a large area of rain began to form from the Western North Carolina to Southern West Virginia. The storm&#x27;s center slowly moved north, over central West Virginia. Rainfall rates of 3 to 6 inches in 12 hours were observed over the headwaters of the Potomac, Greenbrier, and Little Kanawha rivers.

On Monday night, November 5, severe flooding took place and by midnight the rain became lighter, but by then flooding had begun. All of downtown Glenville was affected. Stores were closed, and buildings were flooded. Shopkeepers attempted to save their stock by piling sandbags up to stop the water, but to little avail. 47 people died to the 1985 flooding. Most of the deaths were in rural Pendleton County and Grant County, according to the National Weather Service.

On January 22–23, 2016 Glenville was impacted by the January 2016 United States blizzard. The storm dropped a total of 19 inches of snow in the area.

<text>Falling Spring is a town in Greenbrier County, West Virginia, United States. It is also known as Renick from the name of its post office (ZIP Code 24966). The population was 171 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1769, Major William Renick from Augusta County, Virginia, settled on an entry of in the northern area of Greenbrier County, an area north of Lewisburg known as Falling Spring.

Spring Creek Presbyterian Church was established in 1783. The first pastor was Rev. John McCue. The original site of the church was in Spring Creek, about south of Renick.

A school was established in the town in 1796. In 1928 the public school system established Renick High School in what is now the Renick Junior High School building.

The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway was built through the center of town around 1900, following the Greenbrier River. In 1901, Pitts and Colley built a large store next to the railroad depot and many businesses followed. The railroad line is now the Greenbrier River Trail.

The Bank of Renick was established in 1909 with the Rev. J.S. Wickline as the first and only president. The bank at one time was considered one of the best banks in the Greenbrier Valley.

The post office of Falling Spring was established in the early part of the 1800s. The post office&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Renick&quot; in 1913 by the postal service, due to confusion with the mail service with the community of Falling Spring, Virginia. Today, the post office is still in service and delivers mail not only to the town of Falling Spring, but to the surrounding communities of Auto and Friars Hill.

<text>Lewisburg is a city in and the county seat of Greenbrier County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 3,930 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Lewisburg is named after Andrew Lewis. In 1751 Lewis, as a young surveyor, established a camp near the spring behind the present courthouse. This spring has been known as the Lewis Spring since that time. During Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion in 1763, Native Americans completely destroyed two of the early European settlements in Greenbrier County, killing the men and carrying off the women and children. This raid virtually eliminated all of the earliest settlers in the county. The Native Americans were primarily Shawnees, and (according to undocumented tradition) were led by the famous leader &quot;Hokoleskwa&quot;, or Cornstalk.

By 1770 a fortified encampment called Fort Savannah was established at the Lewis Spring. In 1774, Governor Dunmore of Virginia instructed then-Colonel Andrew Lewis to gather &quot;willing and able men&quot; to go to the great Kanawha River and stand against the Native American forces that were attacking the Greenbrier Valley. In what became known as Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War, over 1,490 men were assembled, some at Fort Pitt at present-day Pittsburgh, and others at Fort Union, on the site of present-day Lewisburg. These recruits included Lewis&#x27;s brother Charles, and others which history books refer to as one of the most remarkable assemblages of frontier leaders in American history. Thirteen were men of political and military distinction. Lewis&#x27;s army marched down the New and Kanawha Rivers to the Ohio River, where they intended to cross over and invade the Ohio Country, which was the home of the Shawnees. The Native Americans, led by Cornstalk, attempted to cut them off at the mouth of the Kanawha, where they fought an inconclusive battle that came to be known as the Battle of Point Pleasant.
When the town of Lewisburg was formally laid out in 1780, Matthew Arbuckle, Sr. was the first settler. Among Lewisburg&#x27;s first trustees was Col. John Stuart (1749-1823), a Revolutionary War commander who surveyed and settled the area and is known locally as the “Father of Greenbrier County”. The land on which the first county courthouse, and the Old Stone Church in Lewisburg, are situated was donated by Stuart. Lewisburg was formally established in 1782 by an act of the Virginia General Assembly. The original trustees were Samuel Lewis, James Reid, Samuel Brown, Andrew Donnelly, John Stuart, and Archer Mathews.
To accommodate Virginians west of the mountains, several Virginia courts sat in Lewisburg, where Patrick Henry once successfully defended a client accused of murder. The town and the surrounding farms prospered and a number of spas and resort hotels were established at some of the outlying mineral springs.

During the Civil War a number of engagements were fought in and around Lewisburg, including the 1862 Battle of Lewisburg. Several of the present buildings in town were used as hospitals and barracks by both sides in this conflict, and bullet marks can still be seen in some today. The Virginia Supreme Court library, which was located in Lewisburg and served as the Greenbrier County Library until 2008, was used as a hospital and has preserved a section of wall with soldiers&#x27; graffiti.

In the mid 20th century, the Lewisburg area was home to several children&#x27;s summer camps. Camp Ann Bailey, (named after Revolutionary War scout Anne Bailey) was located on the Greenbrier River. This Girl Scout camp was integrated in the 1950s thanks to the efforts of Charleston civil rights activist Elizabeth Harden Gilmore. The camp operated between 1927 and 1974, when it was closed to permit construction of Interstate 64. A boys&#x27; camp, Camp Shaw-Mi-Del-Eca, founded in 1929, was also located on the river. The two camps held joint activities, such as dances, with another nearby girls&#x27; camp, Camp Alleghany.

In 1978, a area in the heart of Lewisburg was designated a National Register Historic District.

Today, Lewisburg is home to the West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine, one of 29 osteopathic medical schools in the United States and one of three medical schools in West Virginia.

<text>In mathematics, a chain complex is an algebraic structure that consists of a sequence of abelian groups (or modules) and a sequence of homomorphisms between consecutive groups such that the image of each homomorphism is contained in the kernel of the next. Associated to a chain complex is its homology, which is (loosely speaking) a measure of the failure of a chain complex to be exact.

A cochain complex is similar to a chain complex, except that its homomorphisms are in the opposite direction. The homology of a cochain complex is called its cohomology.

In algebraic topology, the singular chain complex of a topological space X is constructed using continuous maps from a simplex to X, and the homomorphisms of the chain complex capture how these maps restrict to the boundary of the simplex. The homology of this chain complex is called the singular homology of X, and is a commonly used invariant of a topological space.

Chain complexes are studied in homological algebra, but are used in several areas of mathematics, including abstract algebra, Galois theory, differential geometry and algebraic geometry. They can be defined more generally in abelian categories.

==Definitions==
A chain complex formula_1 is a sequence of abelian groups or modules ..., &quot;A&quot;0, &quot;A&quot;1, &quot;A&quot;2, &quot;A&quot;3, &quot;A&quot;4, ... connected by homomorphisms (called boundary operators or differentials) , such that the composition of any two consecutive maps is the zero map. Explicitly, the differentials satisfy , or with indices suppressed, . The complex may be written out as follows.

::formula_2

The cochain complex formula_3 is the dual notion to a chain complex. It consists of a sequence of abelian groups or modules ..., &quot;A&quot;0, &quot;A&quot;1, &quot;A&quot;2, &quot;A&quot;3, &quot;A&quot;4, ... connected by homomorphisms satisfying . The cochain complex may be written out in a similar fashion to the chain complex.

::formula_4

The index &quot;n&quot; in either &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; or &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; is referred to as the degree (or dimension). The difference between chain and cochain complexes is that, in chain complexes, the differentials decrease dimension, whereas in cochain complexes they increase dimension. All the concepts and definitions for chain complexes apply to cochain complexes, except that they will follow this different convention for dimension, and often terms will be given the prefix &quot;co-&quot;. In this article, definitions will be given for chain complexes when the distinction is not required.

A bounded chain complex is one in which almost all the &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; are 0; that is, a finite complex extended to the left and right by 0. An example is the chain complex defining the simplicial homology of a finite simplicial complex. A chain complex is bounded above if all modules above some fixed degree &quot;N&quot; are 0, and is bounded below if all modules below some fixed degree are 0. Clearly, a complex is bounded both above and below if and only if the complex is bounded.

The elements of the individual groups of a (co)chain complex are called (co)chains. The elements in the kernel of &quot;d&quot; are called (co)cycles (or closed elements), and the elements in the image of &quot;d&quot; are called (co)boundaries (or exact elements). Right from the definition of the differential, all boundaries are cycles. The &quot;n&quot;-th (co)homology group &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot; (&quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is the group of (co)cycles modulo (co)boundaries in degree &quot;n&quot;, that is,

::formula_5

===Exact sequences===

An exact sequence (or exact complex) is a chain complex whose homology groups are all zero. This means all closed elements in the complex are exact. A short exact sequence is a bounded exact sequence in which only the groups &quot;A&quot;&quot;k&quot;, &quot;A&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1, &quot;A&quot;&quot;k&quot;+2 may be nonzero. For example, the following chain complex is a short exact sequence.
:formula_6
In the middle group, the closed elements are the elements pZ; these are clearly the exact elements in this group.

===Chain maps===
A chain map &quot;f&quot; between two chain complexes formula_7 and formula_8 is a sequence formula_9 of homomorphisms formula_10 for each &quot;n&quot; that commutes with the boundary operators on the two chain complexes, so formula_11. This is written out in the following commutative diagram.

A chain map sends cycles to cycles and boundaries to boundaries, and thus induces a map on homology formula_12.

A continuous map &quot;f&quot; between topological spaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; induces a chain map between the singular chain complexes of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, and hence induces a map &quot;f&quot;* between the singular homology of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; as well. When &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are both equal to the &quot;n&quot;-sphere, the map induced on homology defines the degree of the map &quot;f&quot;.

The concept of chain map reduces to the one of boundary through the construction of the cone of a chain map.

===Chain homotopy===

A chain homotopy offers a way to relate two chain maps that induce the same map on homology groups, even though the maps may be different. Given two chain complexes &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, and two chain maps , a chain homotopy is a sequence of homomorphisms such that . The maps may be written out in a diagram as follows, but this diagram is not commutative.

The map &quot;hd&quot;&quot;A&quot; + &quot;d&quot;&quot;B&quot;&quot;h&quot; is easily verified to induce the zero map on homology, for any &quot;h&quot;. It immediately follows that &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; induce the same map on homology. One says &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are chain homotopic (or simply homotopic), and this property defines an equivalence relation between chain maps.

Let &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; be topological spaces. In the case of singular homology, a homotopy between continuous maps induces a chain homotopy between the chain maps corresponding to &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;. This shows that two homotopic maps induce the same map on singular homology. The name &quot;chain homotopy&quot; is motivated by this example.

==Examples==

===Singular homology===

Let &quot;X&quot; be a topological space. Define &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) for natural &quot;n&quot; to be the free abelian group formally generated by singular n-simplices in &quot;X&quot;, and define the boundary map formula_13 to be

::formula_14

where the hat denotes the omission of a vertex. That is, the boundary of a singular simplex is the alternating sum of restrictions to its faces. It can be shown that ∂2 = 0, so formula_15 is a chain complex; the singular homology formula_16 is the homology of this complex.

Singular homology is a useful invariant of topological spaces up to homotopy equivalence. The degree zero homology group is a free abelian group on the path-components of &quot;X&quot;.

===de Rham cohomology===

The differential &quot;k&quot;-forms on any smooth manifold &quot;M&quot; form a real vector space called Ω&quot;k&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) under addition. 
The exterior derivative &quot;d&quot; maps Ω&quot;k&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) to Ω&quot;k&quot;+1(&quot;M&quot;), and &quot;d&quot; = 0 follows essentially from symmetry of second derivatives, so the vector spaces of &quot;k&quot;-forms along with the exterior derivative are a cochain complex.

:formula_17

The cohomology of this complex is called the de Rham cohomology of &quot;M&quot;. Locally constant functions are designated with its isomorphism formula_18 with c the count of mutually disconnected components of &quot;M&quot;. This way the complex was extended to leave the complex exact at zero-form level using the subset operator.

Smooth maps between manifolds induce chain maps, and smooth homotopies between maps induce chain homotopies.

==Category of chain complexes==
Chain complexes of &quot;K&quot;-modules with chain maps form a category Ch&quot;K&quot;, where &quot;K&quot; is a commutative ring.

If &quot;V&quot; = &quot;V&quot;formula_19 and &quot;W&quot; = &quot;W&quot;formula_19 are chain complexes, their tensor product formula_21 is a chain complex with degree &quot;n&quot; elements given by 
:formula_22

and differential given by 
: formula_23 
where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are any two homogeneous vectors in &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; respectively, and formula_24 denotes the degree of &quot;a&quot;.

This tensor product makes the category Ch&quot;K&quot; into a symmetric monoidal category. The identity object with respect to this monoidal product is the base ring &quot;K&quot; viewed as a chain complex in degree 0. The braiding is given on simple tensors of homogeneous elements by 
:formula_25
The sign is necessary for the braiding to be a chain map.

Moreover, the category of chain complexes of &quot;K&quot;-modules also has internal Hom: given chain complexes &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot;, the internal Hom of &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot;, denoted Hom(&quot;V&quot;,&quot;W&quot;), is the chain complex with degree &quot;n&quot; elements given by formula_26 and differential given by
: formula_27.
We have a natural isomorphism

<text>Rainelle is a town on the western edge of Greenbrier County, West Virginia, United States. It sits at the base of Sewell Mountain and Sims Mountain, and is bisected by the Meadow River. The only means of transportation to and from Rainelle are roads; primarily US 60 and WV 20, which merge on the western end of the town, and the James River and Kanawha Turnpike, which enters from the south. The population was 1,190 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The valley and community that contain and predates Rainelle is named Sewell Valley after Stephen Sewell, a scout that settled in the area in the 1750s. The community west of the Meadow River first applied for the name Raine in honor of the Raine family but was turned down by the Post Office Department. They adopted the name Rainelle in 1909. Thomas W. Raine and his brother John moved to the location from Pennsylvania in 1906 to harvest a large stand of hardwoods for building homes, etc. Their Meadow River Lumber Company operated for 60 years, and at one time was the largest hardwood sawmill in the world. In 1970, the owners sold it to Georgia-Pacific Corporation, which tore it down in 1975.

The town has suffered from several natural disasters in the last decade: most notable of these have been the June 2012 North American derecho, Hurricane Sandy, and the 2016 West Virginia flood. Rebuilding and demolition of structures damaged in the 2016 flood was still in progress in January 2020. Homes rebuilt with funds from the federal Hazard Mitigation Grant program were required to be sited two feet above the 100-year floodplain.

==Geography==

The Meadow River flows through the town in a westerly direction on its way to eventually join the Gauley River.

The Midland Trail, now part of U.S. Route 60, runs through the town.

<text>Ronceverte is a city in Greenbrier County, West Virginia, United States, on the Greenbrier River. The population was 1,572 at the 2020 census.

==Culture and history==
Ronceverte might have been named &quot;Edgar&quot;, for the high number of Edgars who lived in the town, but the name was settled by a leading entrepreneur of the area, Cecil Clay, president of the St. Lawrence Boom and Manufacturing Company. According to Clay, he saw the name on an old Jesuit map from Fort Duquesne. His argument was that the name &quot;looked well in print and was euphonious in sound.&quot; As the owner of the town&#x27;s site, Clay argued he had the right to decide on the name, but the residents could change the name to whatever they wanted once Ronceverte was fully established. That day has never happened. Since April 1, 1882, the town has been Ronceverte.

&quot;Ronceverte&quot; is French for &quot;Bramble Green&quot;, which is the Gallic equivalent for &quot;Greenbrier&quot;. Greenbriers are a common vine (&quot;Smilax rotundifolia&quot;), and a humorous myth has it the surveyors were trapped in a thicket of the painful vines when they discovered the Greenbrier River. French surveyors were likely the first cartographers for the area, although many of the details have been lost to history.

The river is still inseparable from the culture of the town itself, considered one of the earliest significant river ports in the Greenbrier River watershed. Ronceverte has been significantly impacted by the Greenbrier River flooding in 1985, 1996, and 2016.

The Hokes Mill Covered Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. The Ronceverte Historic District was listed in 2005.

==Railroad==

Ronceverte is a proud railroad town, a part of the C&amp;O lines that connected Pocahontas County to Hinton, and to Clifton Forge, Virginia. Ronceverte was part of the &quot;Gravel Girtie&quot; line where Hinton-based train cars were sent to the limestone quarry at Fort Spring and loaded with crushed lime. This cargo was sent to Clifton Forge where it fluxed in the large furnaces.

During World War II the tracks carried German prisoners of war to areas like local farms and projects. One of the depots for the area, the Rockland Depot, has been lost to history and only the name of Rockland Road in Ronceverte remains.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==Demographics==

Ronceverte&#x27;s economic area is in the downtown section, crossed with railroad tracks for the former Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and a large floodplain that causes occasional adjustment for its citizens. Grants from Tony Hawk and the Izaak Walton League have allowed this public area to grow for the health and recreational opportunities for its citizens. A ball field, swimming pool, playground, interpretive walk and walking track appeal to all ages adjacent to a public access point of the Greenbrier River, where picnickers are welcome. The county&#x27;s recycling depot is close by, encouraging further business from a large area. The public access includes a boat launch for swimmers and fishers, and an outdoor amphitheater. Every June this area is inundated with the Ronceverte River Festival, where a unique raffle is held by floating hundreds of small, numbered yellow ducks into the river. The winning duck can be a cash prize or a new truck; runners-up are gifts from local businesses to support county interests.

==Theater and drama==
In the late 1880s, a man was traveling through on the rail and saw a very pretty young woman at the Ronceverte Depot. The incident inspired a song, &quot;The Pretty Girl of Ronceverte&quot;, written by Thomas Thackston and set to music by Charles Pratt. The music is on display at the Ronceverte Public Library.

On September 10–19 the Outdoor Amphitheater stages &quot;Riders of the Flood&quot;, a popular historical drama based on the book by Pocahontas County author W. E. Blackhurst for the Riders of the Flood Outdoor Drama. The play&#x27;s theme is a demonstration of Ronceverte&#x27;s importance in the turn of the 20th century, when its St. Lawrence Boom and Lumber Company was the largest softwood mill in the country, and traces of its industry have sculpted Ronceverte&#x27;s portion of the Greenbrier River to the shape it is today. All proceeds from the play are recycled back into the town of Ronceverte with the intention of improving the community, uplifting its economy, and fostering civic pride. &quot;Riders of the Flood&quot; is a member of West Virginia&#x27;s Institute for Outdoor Drama. At this point, it is a purely volunteer program, as is its sequel, &quot;Big Dreams, Restless Spirit&quot;.

<text>Rupert is a town in Greenbrier County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 881 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Cyrus A. Rupert first came to Greenbrier County, &quot;circa&quot; 1829, when he was seventeen years old. Cyrus, the seventh of eleven children, was born at Point Pleasant on October 7, 1812. His parents were Henry Rupert and Naomi Henkle Rupert. Apparently, Cyrus chose to go to Greenbrier County to be with his brothers, Gideon and Paul, who were running a general store at Clintonville. Cyrus&#x27; father, Henry, died in 1835 and most of the family, including Gideon, then migrated westward to Pekin, Illinois. Paul moved to Louisville, Kentucky, but Cyrus chose to stay in Greenbrier County. Why Cyrus and his brothers came to Greenbrier County is not known. However, there were Henkles in the area and were possibly related to their mother.

Cyrus became friends with Andrew McClung and it is probably through him that Cyrus began to acquire property near the mouth of Big Clear Creek. This property became the basis for a settlement that would later become Rupert, West Virginia.

<text>White Sulphur Springs is a city in Greenbrier County in southeastern West Virginia, United States. The population was 2,231 at the 2020 census. The city emblem consists of five dandelion flowers and the citizens celebrate spring with an annual Dandelion Festival.

== History ==
White Sulphur Springs grew in the first half of the nineteenth century as the southern &quot;Queen of the Watering Places&quot;. The springs resort first became the standard summer destination for wealthy Virginia Low Country residents seeking reprieve from heat, humidity, and disease of the &quot;sickly season&quot;. As its popularity increased and it gained status as a socially exclusive site, the springs attracted elite guests from all over.

<text>Romney is a town in and the county seat of Hampshire County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 1,722 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Winchester, Virginia metropolitan area. The town was established in 1762 along with Shepherdstown; together, they are the two oldest towns in West Virginia.

== History ==
Established by consecutive acts of the Virginia House of Burgesses and approved by the governor on December 23, 1762, Romney and Mecklenburg (later renamed Shepherdstown), in Jefferson County, are the oldest towns in West Virginia. The bill containing the &quot;Act for establishing the town of Romney, in the county of Hampshire, and for other purposes therein-mentioned,&quot; is listed 20th on a list of approved &quot;publick and private bills&quot; and is immediately followed by &quot;An Act for establishing the town of Mecklenburg, in the county of Frederick.&quot; 
Originally settled in 1725 by hunters and traders, Romney was known as Pearsall&#x27;s Flats and was the site of the French and Indian War stockade Fort Pearsall. Named for the Cinque Ports town of Romney, Kent, England, by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, the town still bears place names and symbols from its colonial past such as its Marsham Street, named for Robert Marsham, 2nd Baron Romney. It is also home to the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind and the nation&#x27;s First Confederate Memorial in Indian Mound Cemetery.

Romney Academy was first incorporated by the Virginia General Assembly on January 11, 1814, and was active until 1846 when it was reorganized as the Romney Classical Institute. Romney Academy was one of the earliest institutions for higher learning within the present boundaries of the state of West Virginia. The Romney Classical Institute, a coeducational collegiate preparatory school, survived until 1866. The loss of members due to the American Civil War forced its closure.

The Romney Expedition of the Confederate States Army occurred in the early American Civil War. It was part of the preliminary actions of Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s Valley Campaign as Jackson cleared Union Army troops led by Major General Nathaniel Banks and Brigadier General William S. Rosecrans from the lower Shenandoah Valley and surrounding Allegheny ranges, and then successfully severed the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. His army advanced from Winchester towards Cumberland, Maryland, but withdrew after reaching Romney due to harsh winter conditions. Romney was occupied by both Union and Confederate soldiers multiple times throughout the war.

The West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and the Blind was established in 1870 upon the campus of the Romney Classical Institute.

<doc id="138412" wikidata="Q2456185" url="?curid=138412" title="Chester, West Virginia">
<text>Chester is a city in Hancock County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 2,214 at the 2020 census. It is located along the Ohio River in the state&#x27;s northern panhandle and is the northernmost city in West Virginia. Chester is part of the Weirton–Steubenville metropolitan area and is home to the World&#x27;s Largest Teapot attraction.

==History==
Chester was established in 1896, but not incorporated until 1907. The town was established by East Liverpool, Ohio lawyer J.E. McDonald, and the name may be a transfer from Chester County, Pennsylvania or Chester, England, although its true origin is unknown. It was the home of Rock Springs Park, a small amusement park founded in 1897 by McDonald, home to various rides, a swimming pool, a lake, a small zoo, and live performances. It closed in 1970 for the expansion of U.S. Route 30 through the area.

The town grew in the early 20th century, led primarily by the pottery industry founded in nearby East Liverpool. The Taylor, Smith &amp; Taylor Company was the leading manufacturer in Chester, employing over 800 people at one time. Another large employer was the steel-manufacturing Chester Rolling Mill Company.

The Chester teapot, the town&#x27;s main attraction, was purchased by Wilford Devon in 1938 and moved to Chester from Carnegie, Pennsylvania. It served as a barrel-shaped food stand with soft serve ice cream, hot dogs, and soft drinks until it was moved and remodeled to its current location in 1990 and has been featured in depictions of West Virginia, such as in the video game Fallout 76.

<text>New Cumberland is a city in and the county seat of Hancock County, West Virginia, United States, along the Ohio River. The population was 1,020 as of the 2020 census. It is part of the Weirton–Steubenville metropolitan area and is located near the Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack and Resort.

==History==

Pioneer George Chapman settled in the area of present-day New Cumberland in 1783 or 1784 and founded Fort Chapman. In 1839, John Cuppy laid out a town at the site and named it Vernon, although it was also referred to as Cuppytown. Cuppy changed the name to New Cumberland per the requests of the earliest land buyers, naming it after Cumberland, Maryland. The town was incorporated by the West Virginia Legislature in 1872.

When Hancock County was formed in 1848, New Cumberland competed with New Manchester (at the time Fairview, and later, Pughtown) for the county seat. New Cumberland was chosen by thirteen votes in a referendum, but the already-seated courthouse in New Manchester refused to comply. In 1850, New Cumberland won a second referendum by forty-six votes and the seat was moved, but just two years later yet another referendum resulted in a New Manchester victory. In 1884, a final election resolved the matter, and New Cumberland became the permanent county seat.

Local industry in the past involved the manufacture of fire and paving brick, sewer pipe, glassware, foundry and machine-shop products, and tiling. There were also coal mines and mills for the pulverization of fire clay for use in ironworks. The First National Bank-Graham Building and Marshall House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Newell is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in northern Hancock County, West Virginia, United States, along the Ohio River. The population was 1,203 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Weirton–Steubenville metropolitan area and is best known as the home to the Fiesta Tableware Company.

==History==

William Hamilton laid out Hamilton, a small town across the Ohio River from Wellsville, Ohio, south of the current site of Newell. Hugh Newell, the son of a pioneer from nearby New Manchester (then called Pughtown) became the owner of the site in the 1800s. 

In 1891, an entrepreneurial group from Pittsburgh bought out the farms of John Newell and J. Bentley Newell, descendants of Hugh, as well as William McDonald, the Wells family, and the Moore family, with the intentions of surverying the primarily flat banks for the development of a large industrial complex. The town of Newell was laid out by the North American Manufacturing Company in 1902 after they bought the tract from the United States Steel Corporation, who sat on the land in fear of establishing a steel mill after the Panic of 1893. 

In 1905, the Homer Laughlin China Company, located across the Ohio River in East Liverpool, Ohio, established what would be the largest pottery factory in the world at the time at a site in Newell, and the Newell Toll Bridge was constructed across the river to connect the towns. Throughout the rest of the decade, the town would grow quickly. A school was established in 1907. Other manufacturers, including potteries, tile producers, and refractories were established in the 1910s and 1920s.

Waterford Park and the William E. Wells House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Moorefield is a town in and the county seat of Hardy County, West Virginia, United States. It is located at the confluence of the South Branch Potomac River and the South Fork South Branch Potomac River. Moorefield was originally chartered in 1777; it was named for Conrad Moore, who owned the land upon which the town was laid out. The population was 2,527 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Moorefield is situated in the South Branch Valley along the South Branch of the Potomac River. Native Americans populated this area for thousands of years. For centuries, they farmed along the river and hunted in the surrounding mountains. The historic Shawnee people, who spoke a Central Algonquian language in the same family as other tribes in their region, occupied this area when Anglo-European settlers began arriving in the early 18th century, attracted by the fertile land. This early settlement was centered on the community of Old Fields, referring to former Native American lands. This is located about five miles to the north of present-day Moorefield.

Conflict between the mostly British settlers and Native American peoples broke out during the French and Indian War. The British colonists constructed two fortifications to guard the South Branch Valley in the vicinity of Moorefield. Fort Buttermilk was erected in 1756 and garrisoned by Captain Thomas Waggoner&#x27;s Virginia Regiment Company. A second fortress, Fort Pleasant, situated at Henry Van Meter&#x27;s Farm at Old Fields, guarded the northern side of the valley. It was also garrisoned by Waggoner&#x27;s Virginia Regiment Company. In the spring of 1756, soldiers from Forts Buttermilk and Pleasant clashed with Shawnee warriors under Bemino (also known as Killbuck) at the Battle of the Trough.

Colonist Conrad Moore owned the land on which Moorefield was laid out. In 1777, the Virginia General Assembly chartered the town of Moorefield in what was then Hampshire County, Virginia (today Hardy County, West Virginia). When Hardy County was separated from Hampshire County by act of the Virginia General Assembly in 1785, after the American Revolution, Moorefield was chosen as the county seat. Many of the historic houses in Moorefield date to the last quarter of the 18th century and first quarter of the 19th century; they display vernacular adaptations of Federal and Greek Revival architecture.

During the American Civil War, Moorefield was the site of a cavalry engagement between Union Brigadier General William W. Averell and Confederate Brigadier General John McCausland on August 7, 1864, in which Averell routed McCausland. This was part of the Valley Campaigns of 1864. That summer, Averell was the only Union commander to achieve successes against Confederate forces.

<doc id="138417" wikidata="Q386013" url="?curid=138417" title="Wardensville, West Virginia">
<text>Wardensville is a town in Hardy County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 265 at the 2020 census. Originally named Trout Run, Wardensville was chartered in Virginia in 1832 and incorporated in West Virginia in 1879. Wardensville is located west of the Great North Mountain range, which separates it from the Shenandoah Valley. The town lies on the east bank of the Cacapon River at its confluence with Trout Run. The George Washington and Jefferson National Forests border the town to its east and south.

==History==
The land which Wardensville occupies was originally part of the Northern Neck Proprietary, a 5 million acre tract granted by England&#x27;s King Charles II and formally established after the restoration of the English monarchy in 1660. In 1719, the land was inherited by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron who administered many of the land grants to the early European settlers who began arriving in the Capon Valley in the second quarter of the eighteenth century. William H. Warden is believed to be the first settler within the present town. He received a parcel of land from Thomas Fairfax, reportedly surveyed by George Washington, on November 11, 1749.

During the French and Indian War, hostilities between the English settlers and the Native American populations in the South Branch and Capon Valleys led to the construction of a string of fortified outposts including Fort Warden or &quot;Warden&#x27;s Fort,&quot; erected by William Warden at a place called Trout Run (later the town of Wardensville). According to historian Samuel Kercheval, the fort was attacked in 1758 when it was burned. Warden and a man only known by the name Mr. Taff did not survive the attack.

The town of Wardensville was established in 1832 when the Virginia General Assembly granted a charter declaring &quot;that the town of Wardensville, in the county of Hardy, as the same has been heretofore laid off into lots, streets and alleys, or as the same may be hereafter further laid off and extended into lots, streets and alleys, shall be, and the same is hereby made a town corporate, to be known and distinguished by the name of Wardensville.&quot; The first trustees of the town were James Scanting, Samuel Fry, John Pierce, Simon Switzer, and James W. Baker. The town was incorporated by the West Virginia Legislature in 1879.

In the 1820 United States census, the population center of the United States was recorded as being about 3 miles northeast of the town.

Historic structures in the town include the Cline Blacksmith Shop/Town Jail, a stone structure on Main Street erected around 1830. Two generations of the Cline family operated a blacksmith shop in the structure until 1895. In the earl twentieth century, the structure was converted for use as a town jail. St. Peter&#x27;s Lutheran Church was founded in 1840 by Rev. John Hamilton and erected its first church on the site in 1870. After this building collapsed in 1934, the present stone church, designed by A. Hensel Fink in Gothic Revival style. The Old Presbyterian Church was constructed in the latter half of the nineteenth century and is a rare example of Italianate style in Wardensville. The Odd Fellows Hall was erected in 1856 on the southern edge of town near the intersection of Main Street and Trout Run Road.

Two properties near Wardensville are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the Francis Kotz Farm and the Nicholas Switzer House.

Three highways technically serve Wardensville, though they all run concurrently through the town, which in effect makes them one single highway. U.S. Route 48 is the most prominent of these. Long range plans have this road and its state highway companions, West Virginia Route 55 and West Virginia Route 259, slated for a realignment around Wardensville. At present, however, all three roads run through downtown Wardensville along Main Street. U.S. Route 48 and WV 55 continues west to Moorefield and east to Strasburg. WV 259 heads southwest and northeast, but serves virtually no significant population centers.

<doc id="138419" wikidata="Q2052960" url="?curid=138419" title="Bridgeport, West Virginia">
<text>Bridgeport is a city in eastern Harrison County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 9,325 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Clarksburg micropolitan area in North Central West Virginia.

==History==
Bridgeport had its beginning in pre-American Revolutionary War times. In 1764, John Simpson entered the area and gave his name to Simpson Creek. Bridgeport was chartered in 1816. Bridgeport was first settled between 1771 and 1774 with the establishment of Simpson Creek Baptist Church, one of the first churches west of the Allegheny Mountains, and surrounding log cabins. The town is believed to have been named for a bridge across Simpson Creek, but it is unclear what bridge was the namesake. Future Virginia governor Joseph Johnson was said to have seen the bridge as a port and named the town as such. Others claim that the town name was meant to be &quot;Bridge Fort,&quot; for the two forts built by early settlers, but the name was changed to Bridgeport after a mapmaker mislabeled it. Bridgeport was chartered in 1816 and incorporated in 1887.

The Northwestern Turnpike from Winchester to Clarksburg opened its portion in Bridgeport in 1838; stagecoaches began operating on the line in 1852. During the American Civil War, the town had split loyalties. The Confederate Jones–Imboden Raid of 1863 attacked much of the town&#x27;s businesses and residents. Establishing stockyards in the early century, the arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the 1850s led Bridgeport to be a center of trade for the cattle industry. Manufacturers opened in the town in the early 1900s, including the West Virginia Pottery Company, Bridgeport Lamp Chimney Company, and later the Master Glass Company.

On June 29, 2006, the city became noted as the site of a showdown over the issue of separation of church and state in the United States. A portrait of Jesus originally hung on a wall at Bridgeport High School. Two parents filed suit in federal court to have the portrait removed, after the Harrison County Board of Education deadlocked over whether to remove the portrait. The portrait of Jesus was stolen from Bridgeport High School early in the morning on August 17, 2006 and a mirror was put in its place.

==Geography==
Bridgeport is located at (39.296544, -80.251305), along Simpson Creek.

<text>Clarksburg is a city in and the county seat of Harrison County, West Virginia, United States, in the north-central region of the state. The population of the city was 16,039 at the 2020 census, making it the tenth-most populous city in West Virginia. It is the principal city of the Clarksburg micropolitan area, which had a population of 90,434 in 2020. Clarksburg was named National Small City of the Year in 2011 by the National League of Cities.

==History==
Indigenous peoples have lived in the area for thousands of years. The Oak Mounds outside Clarksburg were created by the Hopewell culture mound builders between A.D. 1 and 1000

The first known European visitor to the area that later became Clarksburg was John Simpson, a trapper, who in 1764 located his camp on the West Fork River opposite the mouth of Elk Creek at approximately (39.28128, -80.35145)

===Settlement and early history===

As early as 1772, settlers began claiming lands near where Clarksburg now stands, and building cabins. In 1773, Major Daniel Davisson (1748–1819) took up , upon which the principal part of the town is now located. By 1774, people settling near present Clarksburg included: Daniel Davisson, Obadiah Davisson (Daniel&#x27;s father), Amaziah Davisson (Daniel&#x27;s uncle), Thomas, John, and Matthew Nutter, Samuel and Andrew Cottrill (brothers), Sotha Hickman, and Samuel Beard. Undoubtedly, others located on these public lands, of which no official records were made.
The Virginia General Assembly authorized the town of Clarksburg in 1785. Now a city, it is named for General George Rogers Clark, a Virginian who conducted many expeditions against the British and Indians during the Indian Wars and the war of the American Revolution, including the strategically critical capture of the Forts of Vincennes, now in the State of Indiana, in 1778.

As now-President George Washington had proposed years earlier, the General Assembly also authorized a road from Winchester, Virginia to Morgantown in 1786, and a branch from this road (which decades later became the Northwestern Turnpike) would soon begin through Clarksburg toward the Little Kanawha River (which flows into the Ohio River at Parkersburg). In 1787, the Virginia General Assembly authorized the Randolph Academy at Clarksburg, a private school led by Rev. George Towers and the first west of the Alleghenies. However, although many here as the 19th century began wanted the National Road westward to follow McCulloch&#x27;s Path (improvements beginning after the Northwestern Turnpike company&#x27;s formal incorporation by the Virginia General Assembly in 1827), Congress instead authorized construction on an easier route (Nemacolin&#x27;s Path) through Maryland and Wheeling, which opened in 1818.

Construction of the first Harrison County courthouse began in Clarksburg in 1787. That building was followed by four increasingly larger courthouses; the most recent one completed in 1932. The first Court House stood on what is now the North East Corner of Second and Main Streets; the jail stood on the opposite side of Main Street near where the Presbyterian church now stands.

Relatively poor transportation slowed northwestern Virginia&#x27;s development, so subscribers in Winchester, Romney, Kingwood, Clarksburg, Parkersburg and other towns en route caused the Northwestern Turnpike to be built. While the toll road increased development around Clarksburg in the 1830s, it also used a relatively anachronistic model. Nonetheless, the Randolph Academy was razed and replaced by the Northwestern Academy in 1841, a year after stage coach service began between Clarksburg and Parkersburg on the Ohio River. Clarksburg&#x27;s development increased more a decade later due to new technology and further subscriptions. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad reached Clarksburg from Grafton in 1856.

Two of the modern city&#x27;s historic buildings date from this prewar era. The Stealey-Goff-Vance House, now owned by the Harrison County Historical Society, was originally constructed in 1807, expanded in 1891 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Waldomore was built beginning in 1839, served as the Clarksburg Public Library from 1931 to 1976 (when a new building was built next door for the majority of the collection), and added to the National Register in 1978.

===Civil War===

During the Virginia Secession Convention of 1861, Harrison county had two delegates, John S. Carlile and Benjamin Wilson. Carlile became a leader of the Wheeling Convention which led to creation of the Restored Government of Virginia during the American Civil War. Carlile was appointed to the U.S. Senate by the convention. Though he had been a strong advocate for statehood for West Virginia he later opposed the bill in the senate. Wilson had abstained in the April 17 vote on Virginia&#x27;s secession ordinance, but signed the ordinance later in April. He was arrested by Union forces in June and later released. In 1862 he named his son after Stonewall Jackson, who had been born in Clarksburg. Wilson later became a U.S. senator from West Virginia.

Clarksburg&#x27;s citizenry also reflected this divide. Union General McClellan established his headquarters near Clarksburg until the First Battle of Bull Run. The B&amp;O line made Clarksburg an important Union supply base throughout the war, with at one point more than 7000 troops in the city. It became a target of Confederate raiders, but none actually reached the city, instead striking surrounding areas with fewer defenders. The closest, most famous (and materially successful) raid, the Jones-Imboden Raid of April and May 1863, was designed to impede recognition of West Virginia (which became the 35th state of the Union anyway in June 1863).

The influx of Union troops and the increased demand for goods and services stimulated the city&#x27;s economy. Many new businesses were established to cater to the needs of the military, and existing businesses experienced a boom in trade. The war also heightened political tensions in the city, as residents debated the issues of slavery and secession.

===Postwar industrialization===
In 1877, Clarksburg became one of three cities from which West Virginia voters would select their new state capital. Despite its relatively central location and an early lead, it came in second; Charleston, West Virginia became and remains the state capital.

Around that time Clarksburg gained some industry and manufacturing, particularly involving glass and coal. The city grew slowly but steadily, and services increased apace. The still-functional Despard Building was built in 1870. Telephone service, the first in the state, began in Clarksburg in the mid-1880s. Native son Edwin Maxwell was the Republican nominee for Governor of West Virginia in the 1884 election, though he lost narrowly to Emanuel Willis Wilson. In 1887, Clarksburg laid its first six miles of water lines; downtown streets were lit by electricity in 1889. Nonetheless, in the late 1890s, a visitor called Clarksburg a &quot;sleepy, moss-covered town.&quot;

Clarksburg&#x27;s boom years began around the turn of the century, as coal and glass production increased. The population grew from 4,050 in 1900 to 27,869 in 1920, partly because in 1917 it annexed the previously independent surrounding communities of Adamston, Stealey, North View and Broad Oaks. The population may have reached 35,000 in 1929, before the Great Depression.
In 1894, the Traders&#x27; Hotel was constructed, the grandest structure to date. Many buildings in the Clarksburg Downtown Historic District date from that era. In 1900, the first sewer lines were installed, and Main and Pike streets were paved with brick. In 1901, the city&#x27;s first trolley opened for business (it would cease operating in 1947). Merchants Smith, Brown and Company built an early department store beginning in 1890. The Northwestern Academy was razed in 1894 and the Towers School erected (which became the city&#x27;s high school). Merchants National Bank built a building in 1894 which later became the Community Bank. Clarksburg&#x27;s oldest bank, the Empire National Bank, built a seven-story headquarters in 1907. Other significant buildings include the Goff Building (1911), Municipal Building (1888), the Waldo Hotel (1901–1904), Robinson Grand (1912, 1940), Harrison County Courthouse (1931–1932), U.S. Post Office (1932), Masonic Temple (1911–1914), First United Presbyterian Church (1894), and First Methodist Church (1909, 1956).

An automobile had reached Clarksburg in 1902, and that technology fostered further development. In 1928, U.S. Route 50 was paved through Clarksburg. U.S. Interstate 79 would open in 1979 and connect Clarksburg with Charleston as well as Pennsylvania. In 1924, Clarksburg hosted a parade for its &quot;native son&quot;, John W. Davis, who had become the &quot;dark horse&quot; Democratic presidential candidate (but lost) to Republican incumbent Calvin Coolidge. The following year, Republican and former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Howard M. Gore, became Governor of West Virginia. During the 1920s, Clarksburg&#x27;s Melville Davisson Post (1869–1930) may have been the country&#x27;s highest paid author, writing 17 novels including the characters of Randolph Mason and Uncle Abner.

As the Great Depression began, the Farmers Bank closed in 1929, and the Bank of West Virginia (which had opened in 1869) failed in 1933. Clarksburg&#x27;s population dropped to 30,579 by 1940, and further as the decade progressed. Former Gov. Gore served as state agricultural commissioner (1931–33) and later as Public Service Commissioner (1941–47).

However, Clarksburg managed to avoid urban blight and preserved much of the architecture it had gained during the &quot;boom years&quot;. It is now West Virginia&#x27;s tenth largest city. The West Virginia Preservation Alliance, the state&#x27;s first, was created in Clarksburg in 1981.

===Mountaineer Militia===
On October 11, 1996, seven men having connections with the Mountaineer Militia, a local anti-government paramilitary group, were arrested on charges of plotting to blow up the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s Criminal Justice Information Services Division complex in Clarksburg. While members of the group had been assembling large quantities of explosives and blasting caps, militia leader Floyd Raymond Looker obtained blueprints of the FBI facility from a Clarksburg firefighter. Plastic explosives were confiscated by law enforcement officials at five locations in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Looker was taken into custody after arranging to sell the blueprints for $50,000 to an undercover FBI agent, whom he believed to be a representative of an international terrorist group. In 1998 Looker was sentenced to 18 years in prison. Two other defendants were sentenced on explosives charges, and the firefighter drew a year in prison for providing blueprints.

==Geography==

Clarksburg is located at , along the West Fork River and Elk Creek.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Clarksburg is located in West Virginia&#x27;s North-Central region. It lies within the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau.

Clarksburg is located at the junction of U.S. 50 and U.S. 19, two miles west of the junction of U.S. 50 with Interstate 79. The city lies at an elevation of 1,007 feet at the junction of Elk Creek and the West Fork River of the Monongahela River.

===Climate===
Clarksburg had a humid continental climate if one considers the 0 °C isotherm. The latest temperature numbers have the climate as humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot;). To the molds of Köppen the climate may be considered the southern boundary of the &quot;Dfb&quot; zone at low altitudes in the North American continent (limit of 39 ° N), although in the immediate vicinity it is &quot;Dfa&quot;. The city still suffers strong influences from the south, especially from the Gulf of Mexico but due to its location has a much more significant influence of the cold air intrusion of Canada, where it is not protected by the Appalachians. The extent further to the south is due to the eastern and southeastern mountain ranges blocking the oceanic influence in part, even if it is minimal anyway by the considerable distance from the coast. At the same time it can be classified as &quot;Cfa&quot; or hybrid of different climatic zones according to the criterion to be surveyed, a situation similar to that of Boston. It is the &quot;Dfb&quot; boundary throughout the northern hemisphere if it is to be disregarded in elevated regions on all continents. The southern record could appear on the Korean peninsula but the dry season defined version (&quot;Dwb&quot;) predominates in these locations. The average temperature is with a high average of and a low average of . It has of rain with peak in May (4.8 inches or 122 mm) and lower value in February with . The amount of total snow is , with highest values between January and February, in total for each month. Since the season of snowfall goes from November to March.

Record temperatures range from on January 19, 1994, up to as recently as September 3 and 4, 1953.

===Belgians===
During the first decade of the 20th century, French was frequently spoken on the West Virginia streets of such communities as South Charleston, the North View section of Clarksburg, and the small town of Salem. These neighborhoods shared a connection to the window-glass industry, and the people speaking French often were Walloons, or French-speaking Belgians. About 1900, changes in window-glass manufacture brought thousands of immigrants from the Charleroi area of Belgium just when the industry was expanding into West Virginia to take advantage of cheap natural gas and large deposits of silica sand. For a generation, window-glass factories, many of which were worker-owned cooperatives, relied heavily on these Belgian immigrants to provide the skills necessary to make West Virginia a national center of production.

West Virginia&#x27;s Belgians came from an area economically similar to West Virginia. The Charleroi basin of the Hainaut province in Belgium was dependent upon coal mining, steel production, and window-glass manufacturing. The Belgians&#x27; new homes in north-central West Virginia and the Kanawha Valley must have felt familiar.

They left Europe because the Belgian glass factories were struggling in the 1880s and 1890s. Equally important, workers had limited opportunities to voice their concerns either politically or economically. Belgian glassworkers found in the United States an effective trade union to represent their workplace concerns and the means to build a vibrant political movement advocating democratic socialism. In fact, some of these Belgian enclaves, including Star City near Morgantown and Adamston (now part of Clarksburg), elected Socialist mayors in the years before World War I. Aside from politics, Belgian ethnic communities also became famous for the cuisine, musical groups, social clubs, and celebrations composing the unique Belgian cultural heritage.

The technological changes that had made skilled Belgian workers so valuable, however, soon gave way to newer technologies that turned window-glass manufacture from a skilled craft to a mass-production industry. By the end of the 1920s, a few large corporations dominated the industry and machines replaced most of the skilled craftsmen. One exception, window-glass cutters, continued to provide opportunities to a new generation of Belgian-Americans. More than 70 years later, the Belgian-American Heritage Society keeps alive the history and culture of this fascinating ethnic group.

==Economy==

The availability of natural resources, coupled with easy access to railroad facilities, attracted industry and manufacturing to Clarksburg, including chemical plants, brickworks, potteries, foundries and machine shops, hardwood and casket companies, glass factories (including the Akro-Agate marble company), and the Jackson (later Phillips) Sheet and Tin Plate Company, the forerunner of Weirton Steel. Economic development brought successive waves of immigrants in the 19th and early 20th centuries, including Irish, Italians, Greeks, French, Belgians, and Spanish.

Early 20th century Clarksburg boasted eight banks, three hospitals, and several fine hotels, including the elegant seven-story Waldo, which opened in 1909. The seven-story Empire Bank building went up in 1907, the nine-story Goff Building in 1911, and the 10-story Union Bank in 1912.

By 1929, Clarksburg had reached its peak population of 35,115. During the Depression the city lost industry and population, but during World War II the railroad again made it a central clearinghouse. New development came with the construction in the 1970s of Interstate 79 and the new four-lane U.S. 50 Appalachian Corridor D connecting I-79 to I-77, but plant closings in the 1980s had a negative impact. New expansion in the government and technology sectors began in the 1990s, including the relocation of the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services Center to Clarksburg and construction of a new federal building and a new building to house Fairmont State University&#x27;s Clarksburg branch.

* In 1975, Clarksburg opened a new public library designed by Marcel Breuer, adding another distinctive element to its architecturally rich downtown.
* The city has a daily newspaper, The Exponent-Telegram, three local television stations, and six radio stations.
* Clarksburg is home to Eastpointe and Newpointe, the largest strip mall in West Virginia, adjacent to Interstate 79. Most of Clarksburg&#x27;s retail has relocated to the strip malls, and downtown is now home to many professional services.[18]

===Akro Agate Company===
The Akro Agate Company of Clarksburg was a world leader in manufacturing glass marbles. Organized in Akron, Ohio, in 1911 the firm relocated to Clarksburg in 1914 because of the availability of glass sand and cheap natural gas for fuel. The Chinese checkers craze of the 1930s and &#x27;40s helped make the marbles very profitable, with more than 2,000,000 made per week. Beginning in the 1930s a line of pressed glass vases, floral ware, and colorful glass containers was produced. Miniature glass children&#x27;s dishes, including tea pots, cups, saucers, and other pieces, were sold as inexpensively boxed sets when World War II limited the availability of metal for toys. The marbles and multicolored pressed articles in similar hues are sought by collectors today. Pressed products can sometimes be identified by the trademark of the letter &quot;A&quot; with a crow flying through it. The firm, located off South Chestnut Street, ceased production in 1951.

===Hazel-Atlas Glass Company===
Hazel-Atlas Glass Company, the glassmaking giant in a state known for glass production, was created in 1902 by the merger of four earlier companies. The largest glass company in the United States from the 1930s until the 1950s, Hazel Atlas was a major producer of inexpensive &quot;depression glass&quot; table sets of pink, green, blue, colorless, and black glass. Hundreds of thousands of glass premiums given away in oats, coffee, and other products were made by Hazel Atlas.

Hazel Atlas glass plants in West Virginia included one along the Tygart River in Grafton (1916–60) that largely produced wide-mouth canning jars, and the world&#x27;s largest tumbler factory in Clarksburg (1902–87). By 1920, the Clarksburg factory had 15 acres of floor space, employed 1,200 people, and shipped all over the world. The company&#x27;s metal factories in Wheeling made lids and closures for glass containers.

===Rolland Glass Company===
The Rolland Glass Plant was a glass manufacturing company founded in 1921 by Albert Rolland in Clarksburg, West Virginia. The company specialized in producing high-quality tableware and stemware, and its products were sold throughout the United States.

The Rolland Glass Plant was a major employer in Clarksburg, and it played an important role in the city&#x27;s economy. At its peak, the plant employed over 1,000 workers. However, the company began to struggle in the late 1960s due to increased foreign competition and rising production costs.

In 1970, the Rolland Glass Plant was acquired by the Fourco Glass Company, which continued to operate the plant until 1979. The plant was then sold to the Hordus Glass Company, which operated it until 1985. The plant was closed permanently in 1985, and the buildings were demolished in 1987.

Today, the site of the Rolland Glass Plant is occupied by the Rolland Glass Museum, which is dedicated to preserving the history of the company and the glass industry in Clarksburg. The museum houses a collection of Rolland Glass products, as well as photographs, documents, and other artifacts.

===Other notable glass companies===
* Clarksburg Glass Company (1893–1921)
* National Bottle Company (1903–1919)
* Diamond Glass Company (1920–1930s)
* West Virginia Glass Specialty Company (1940s–1950s).

===Federal Bureau of Investigation===
In July 1995, the Federal Bureau of Investigation completed construction on its Criminal Justice Information Services Division complex in Clarksburg. The $200 million complex, located on 986 acres, is the national repository for the FBI&#x27;s law enforcement records. The project came about through the efforts of Senator Robert C. Byrd. In 1990, in Byrd&#x27;s second year as head of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the senator worked to fund the center and get it built in West Virginia, not Washington.

==Culture==
Clarksburg is a cultural center of the north-central West Virginia region and hosts many events and festivals. Since 1979 Clarksburg has hosted the annual West Virginia Italian Heritage Festival held during Labor Day weekend. Every September since 1991 the city has been the site of the West Virginia Black Heritage Festival. Since 2006 Clarksburg has hosted the annual Glen Elk Wine, Music and Arts festival. Since 1997 Clarksburg has also hosted the Greater Clarksburg 10K race, the official WV 10K State Championship. In 2007 the race was renamed the Jarvis Greater Clarksburg 10K.

<text>Despard is a census-designated place (CDP) in Harrison County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 1,004 at the 2010 census.

Despard was home to the largest manufacturing enterprise in north central West Virginia in the early 1900s, the Jackson Sheet and Tin Plate Company, after 1905 known as the Phillips Sheet and Tin Plate Company, or simply the &quot;Tin Plate Mill.&quot;

==History==

In July 1901, the Jackson Sheet and Tin Plate Company, capitalized at $300,000, was incorporated by Ingraham Grove of Cleveland; C.C. Moore of Columbus, and T.M. Jackson, C.S. Sands, Fleming Howell and L.S. Hornor of Clarksburg.

It was sold (new, never operated) at bankruptcy auction to Pittsburgh partners, James R. Phillips and Ernest T. Weir, and the name was changed to Phillips Sheet &amp; Tinplate Co.. One month after operations began, senior partner J. R. Phillips was killed in a train wreck, when the Pullman sleeper he was resting in on a siding was struck by a passing train.

<text>Salem is a city in Harrison County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 1,485 at the 2020 census. It is located at the junction of U.S. Route 50 and West Virginia Route 23; the North Bend Rail Trail passes through the city. Salem University is located in Salem.

==Geography==
Salem is located at (39.283411, -80.562731), along Salem Fork, a tributary of Tenmile Creek, in western Harrison County. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==History==

Salem was settled in the summer of 1790 — as &quot;New Salem&quot; — by forty Seventh Day Baptist families from Shrewsbury, New Jersey. Notable settler family names included Lippincott, Maxson, Babcock, Plumer, Davis, and Fitz-Randolph. New Salem was formally chartered and made a town by legislative enactment of the Virginia Assembly on December 19, 1794, on land owned by Samuel Fitz Randolph. John Patterson, John Davis, Samuel Lippincott, James Davis, Zebulon Maxon, Benjamin Thorp, Thomas Clayton, William Davis, Jacob Davis, George Jackson and John Haymond were appointed its first trustees.

By the 1870s, the town was more frequently being called &quot;Salem&quot; than &quot;New Salem&quot;, as the separation of West Virginia from Virginia in 1863 had diminished the need to distinguish it from the town named Salem near Roanoke. The United States Postal Service made the change official in March 1884. Salem was incorporated by the state of West Virginia on 25 February 1905.

As late as 1870, Charles A. Burdick came to town as a Seventh Day Baptist missionary, feeling the need for an educational institution in the area, opened a school, though it operated for only two semesters. In 1888, the Eastern Seventh Day Baptist Association provided for the construction of the Salem Academy, which later became a college in 1890, existing to this day.

Salem has a rich history of large fires. The same full city block has burned down twice in the city&#x27;s history. The north side of Main Street downtown burned once in 1901 and again on March 2, 2006. The more recent fire burned the old city bank building, several store fronts, and several residences; five structures in all were damaged. The fire was determined to have been started by a hot water tank in an apartment. The fire departments&#x27; ability to put out the blaze was hampered by a limited city water supply; they were forced to draw water from the nearby creek.

The Salem College Administration Building and Salem Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Demographics==

== Education ==

Salem University is a private university in the city, founded in 1888 by Seventh Day Baptists, under the name of Salem College. Since then, it has undergone numerous name changes including Salem-Teikyo University, Salem International University, and now Salem University. The Salem College Administration Building was completed in 1910 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.
The Salem College Administration building was later torn down in early 2024 due to it being condemned for many years.

<text>Shinnston is a city and former coal town in Harrison County, West Virginia, United States, along the West Fork River. In 1778, Levi Shinn constructed his log home along what is now Route 19; today it is the oldest standing structure in north-central West Virginia. As of the 2020 census, Shinnston had a population of 2,332.

==History==

The roots of Shinnston date back to 1778, when Levi Shinn constructed his log home. The log house, located along Route 19, is the oldest standing structure in North Central West Virginia. It is maintained by the Shinnston Historical Association, which opens the home for tours by the general public.

In 1815, the town was laid out with three streets, running parallel with the river, and with four crossing streets running at right angles to them. The town was incorporated in 1852 as Shinn&#x27;s Town by an act of the Virginia legislature, as West Virginia did not yet exist as an independent state. Solomon S. Fleming was elected as the first mayor.

A new charter was secured in 1877 and the town&#x27;s name was changed to Shinnston. In 1915, Shinnston&#x27;s charter provided for a Mayor-Council form of government. This model remained in place for over 70 years and in 1998, the citizens voted to revise the charter to adopt a City Manager-Council form of local government. That model was implemented on July 1, 1998 and remains in place today.
Shinnston has enjoyed a history of active commerce, with its beginnings built around both grain mills and saw mills. In its early years, the town saw the development of a tannery, wagon makers, an undertaker, mercantile interests, a pottery, and a local newspaper. The railroad came to the area in 1890, and the first bank opened in 1899. From 1906 to 1947 a trolley operated in the area, offering another form of transportation. As is true for much of West Virginia, energy has been a vital component in the city&#x27;s history. By the early 1900&#x27;s, oil wells and gas wells joined coal as major economic forces. Energy generation continues to be a major source of jobs and economic activity today, as evidenced by the existing mines as well as the nearby Harrison Power Station. The city&#x27;s economy has also seen a shift to service-oriented businesses.

Shinnston has also enjoyed a diverse culture of many faiths and denominations. The first church was organized in 1786 and held meetings and services in several homes until the construction of the first church building in 1835. Area churches have formed a Council of Churches offering shared services with members of several faiths.

By 1813, the first school was organized with classes taught in a small log cabin. In 1860, a larger building was constructed for use as a town hall and academy. This turned into the first public school in 1865. The first grade school was established in 1895, and Shinnston High School was added in 1907. In 1978, Shinnston and Lumberport High Schools were combined to form Lincoln High School.

Over the years residents have been challenged by natural disasters, including the Shinnston tornado, which hit on June 23, 1944. The community has developed the Lowe Public Library, the Clay District Veterans Memorial, the Bice-Ferguson Memorial Museum, and Ferguson Park.

===Shinnston Tornado===

The deadliest tornado in West Virginia&#x27;s history struck Shinnston at 8:30 p.m., June 23, 1944. Sixty-six people died in the town and surrounding area. The total number of people killed by the tornado was 103, with 430 serious injuries. After wreaking havoc in farming communities northwest of Shinnston, the twister hit hardest in a neighborhood known as Pleasant Hill, where no more than 10 houses were left standing. The tornado then continued to Shinns Run and Booths Creek, where it destroyed a large natural gas compressor station, passing on through Marion, Taylor, and Barbour counties before blowing out in Randolph County.

After the initial deaths and maiming, the greatest destruction was to property and the infrastructure. Power lines went down, including a huge tower and high-voltage transmission line near Saltwell. The two hospitals in Clarksburg had to treat victims by candle and flashlight. Phone service, however, was disrupted for only a short time, thanks to wartime emergency backup preparations. Among the many unexpected ways people helped each other were the lending of generators to the hospitals by a traveling circus and grave digging by the prison camp laborers from Gypsy, north of Shinnston. Selfless efforts were also made by elected officials, the National Guard, police, road crews, firefighters, nurses, doctors, and common citizens.

The Shinnston Tornado was part of a broader outbreak of tornadoes and violent weather in the northern Appalachian region during the period of June 22–23, 1944. Tornadoes were reported in Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia, including several tornadoes in a zone from Wellsburg, West Virginia, across southwestern Pennsylvania to Garrett County, Maryland, on June 23. The Shinnston Tornado was the deadliest and most destructive of the June 22–23 tornadoes.

Tornadoes are rare in West Virginia, which has among the nation&#x27;s lowest rates of occurrence for such storms. The Shinnston Tornado was estimated to have been an F-4 tornado, the second highest of the rankings currently assigned to tornadoes. F-4 storms produce winds faster than 206 miles per hour, capable of leveling houses and throwing automobiles.

===Civil War===
The area was heavily Northern in its sentiments during the Civil War, and many local men served in the Union Army. Shinnston was raided by Confederates during the Jones-Imboden raids of 1863.

<doc id="138430" wikidata="Q1818901" url="?curid=138430" title="Ravenswood, West Virginia">
<text>Ravenswood is a city in Jackson County, West Virginia, United States, along the Ohio River. The population was 3,865 at the 2020 census.

==Etymology==
Two differing stories tell of the naming of Ravenswood. One story tells that the town was originally named Ravensworth, after the English relatives of a founding family. But somewhere between the Ohio River wilderness and the mapmaker in Richmond, the name was changed to Ravenswood. The second story says that Henrietta Fitzhugh, wife of one of the town founders, Henry Fitzhugh, named the town after the hero in Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;The Bride of Lammermoor&quot; (1819).

== History==
Ravenswood is sited on land once owned by George Washington. Washington acquired the parcel in 1770, and designated Colonel William Crawford to survey the lands in 1771. A permanent settlement was first established in 1810, and the town streets and lots were laid out in their current pattern by descendants of Washington in 1835. The first town election was held in the home of Bartholomew Fleming in 1840. Ravenswood was incorporated in 1852.

During the American Civil War, the 1863 Battle of Buffington Island took place north of Ravenswood. In 1886, the Ohio River Rail Road reached Ravenswood.

=== Legend of the Devil’s Baby===
In the local cemetery is a gravestone marking the grave of George Elwood Sharp, a two-year-old toddler who died 1917. The ceramic photo plate on the stone was said to be &quot;of a demonical baby, complete with hollow eyes, fangs, and horns. What’s more, the claim is that at night the ceramic picture plate on this tombstone emits an eerie, iridescent glow. Not only that, but if you listen carefully, you may be able to hear the child’s disembodied cry drifting through the air across the cemetery lawn.&quot;

According to researcher Daniel Reed, the three claims made by the legend can easily be explained: the demonical baby depicted in the image plate is simply the result of years of deterioration; the eerie glow is nothing more than a reflection of the setting sun (or reflection from a security light); and the disembodied cry is likely sounds coming from the nearby residential area (along with psychological priming and confirmation bias of ghost hunters).&quot;

== Industry==
In 1931, the Ravenswood Glass Novelty Company (&quot;The Marble Factory&quot;) opened. When Kaiser Aluminum planned a new facility with 12,000 workers, Bill Finley was hired to plan a &quot;company town&quot; of 25,000. He went on to become a planner with the National Capital Planning Commission, and develop the community of Columbia, Maryland, for the Rouse Company. Henry J. Kaiser opened what was then the world&#x27;s largest aluminum refinery six miles south of Ravenswood in 1957. The Kaiser facility is now owned by Constellium and Century Aluminum. John F. Kennedy visited Ravenswood during the 1960 Democratic Party presidential primaries. The Ravenswood exit of Interstate 77 opened in 1964.

In February 2010, &quot;USA Today&quot; referred to Ravenswood as &quot;teetering on a ghost town&quot;. Mayor Lucy Harbert responded by bringing in sponsorships from several Silicon Valley–based companies like ScanCafe.com and StartUps.com. On March 26, 2010, Mike Ruben, a reporter with the &quot;State Journal&quot; newspaper, announced that Ravenswood was &quot;transforming&quot; the town into &quot;Aluminum City, U.S.A.&quot; to help attract local tourism revenue: &quot;L.A. Promoter Plans to Market &#x27;Aluminum City&#x27;.&quot; None of these developments came to fruition.

==Geography==

Ravenswood is located at (38.952922, -81.761357), along the Ohio River at the mouth of Sandy Creek.

<text>Ripley is a city in and the county seat of Jackson County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 3,074 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Ripley was originally owned and settled by William, John, and Lewis Rodgers. They received a grant of in 1768 where &quot;Sycamore Creek joins Big Mill Creek&quot; (the current site of Ripley). The land was later sold to Jacob (and Ann) Starcher, most probably in 1803. Jacob Starcher erected a grist mill in 1824 and laid out the town in 1830, naming it in honor of Harry Ripley, a young minister who was to be married, but drowned in Big Mill Creek, about one and a half miles north of the town, shortly before the ceremony took place.

When Jackson County was formed in 1831, the residents of the county could not decide where to locate the county seat. The people who lived along the Ohio River near the Ravenswood settlement favored that location. The people who lived farther inland objected. The Virginia General Assembly appointed an independent commission to make the final decision which selected Ripley. In 1832, the Starchers donated of land to the county, for the location of the county courthouse and jail, and six for the general use of the new county (a public school and a cemetery were later located on the land). The town was chartered by the Virginia General Assembly in 1832.

The post office was established in 1832 with the name Jackson Court House. The name was shortened in 1893 to Jackson. In 1897, the name became Ripley.

During the American Civil War, Ripley remained under the control of the Union except for a brief incursion by the Confederate General Albert G. Jenkins in September 1862.

The last public hanging in West Virginia took place in Ripley in 1897, when John Morgan was hanged for murder. The spectacle prompted the West Virginia Legislature to ban public executions soon after.

<text>Charles Town is a city in and the county seat of Jefferson County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 6,534 at the 2020 census. The city is named for its founder Charles Washington, youngest brother of President George Washington. It is part of the northwestern fringes of the Washington metropolitan area.

==History==
===18th century===

&quot;Charlestown&quot; was established by an act of the Virginia General Assembly in January 1787. However, for about two decades, confusion arose because the same name was also used for a town established in Ohio County at the mouth of Buffalo Creek, and authorized in the 1791 term of that local court. That area in 1797 became known as Brooke County, with that &quot;Charlestown&quot; as its county seat until a December 27, 1816 act of the Virginia General Assembly changed its name to Wellsburg, to honor a trader and his son.

Charles Washington, the founder of Charles Town, was born in Hunting Creek, now Fairfax County, Virginia, on May 2, 1738. He was the youngest full brother of George Washington. He came to what is today Jefferson County between April and October 1780. The estate of Charles Washington, Happy Retreat, was erected in 1780. In 1786, on 80 acres (320,000 m2) of his adjoining land, Charles laid out the streets of Charles Town, naming many of them after his brothers and one after his wife, Mildred. He donated the four corner lots at the intersection of George and Washington Streets for public buildings of the town and county, provided the town become the seat of the county separated from Berkeley County.

In 1794, James Madison married &quot;Dolly&quot; Todd at Harewood, the home of George Steptoe Washington, son of George Washington&#x27;s brother Colonel Samuel Washington, just outside Charles Town.

===19th century===

Jefferson County was formed in 1801 as Charles Washington had anticipated. The county court house stands on one of the lots he donated, as did the jail until 1919, when it was demolished and replaced by the Post Office.

Charles Washington died sometime between July and September, 1799, only a short while before the death of his brother George. Charles&#x27; and his wife Mildred&#x27;s grave sites near Evitts Run have recently been located and surrounded by a stone wall.

In 1844, the first issue of the &quot;Spirit of Jefferson&quot; newspaper was published in Charles Town by James W. Beller. It is the oldest newspaper in the state still (2020) being published.

On October 16, 1859, abolitionist John Brown and his followers raided the Federal arsenal at nearby Harpers Ferry, east of Charles Town. The insurrection was quickly put down and John Brown and his six captured associates were tried in the Jefferson County Courthouse for treason, murder, and fomenting a slave insurrection; all were found guilty and were hanged at the location occupied today by the Gibson-Todd House. Brown&#x27;s trial and execution brought the national press and many other visitors to Charles Town. During the six weeks between Brown&#x27;s arrest (October 19) and his execution (December 2) Charles Town was an armed military camp; hundreds of soldiers were stationed there to prevent a rescue of Brown, and a cannon was placed in front of the courthouse. See Virginia v. John Brown.

During the first two years of the Civil War, the front lines of the Union and Confederate armies in the area fluctuated and the town frequently changed hands during the military engagements in the surrounding areas, with the town first occupied by Confederate troops, then Union troops, then back to Confederate until 1863 when Union troops occupied the town for the remainder of the war.

In 1883, the Valley Telephone Company was incorporated in West Virginia and began installing telephone lines throughout Jefferson County. The company&#x27;s main office was in Charles Town.

A writer in 1898 commented as follows:

===20th century===

In 1922, Bill Blizzard, a leader of striking coal miners during the Battle of Blair Mountain, was charged with treason and murder for engaging in warfare against state and federal troops in Mingo and Logan Counties. He was tried in the Jefferson County courthouse in Charles Town and was found not guilty.

The Charles Town Race Track first opened in 1933. It was built on land purchased from the Charles Town Horse Show Association. In 1999, the Charles Town Race Track underwent major renovation which included a large addition to house video slot machines. It was renamed Charles Town Races &amp; Slots. It became the Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races on July 2, 2010.

In 1975, the Jefferson Memorial Hospital in neighboring Ranson opened, replacing Charles Town General Hospital. It became part of the West Virginia University Health System and was renamed Jefferson Medical Center in 2013.

===21st century===
Charles Town&#x27;s population has more than doubled since 2000, due in part to annexation of housing subdivisions that have been developed on land around the original city.

<text>Ranson is a city in Jefferson County, West Virginia, United States. The population was 5,433 at the 2020 census. It is part of the northwestern fringes of the Washington metropolitan area.

== History ==
The Charles Town Mining, Manufacturing, and Improvement Company played an instrumental role in creating this new town. In 1890, the company bought adjoining the western and northern corporate limits of Charles Town, and commissioned D.G. Howell, a civil engineer and architect, to lay out the town. The largest tract of land purchased was from the Ranson family. Ranson, in Jefferson County, West Virginia, was officially incorporated in 1910, when residents, by a vote of 67–2, decided to form their own town. It was named in honor of Dr. James Ranson, a dentist and farmer living in the area.

The early growth and development of Ranson reflects the late 19th century boom of the Shenandoah Valley and surrounding areas associated with the rise of the railroads, mining, and manufacturing. Early photographs of Ranson show the offices of the Charles Town Mining, Manufacturing &amp; Improvement Company, and the Hotel Powhatan, along with a few residential structures nearby. The community grew north from Lancaster Circle. Some of the companies that located in Ranson early on included the Hotel Powhatan, the Goetz Saddlery, the Shenandoah Brass and Iron Works, the Elemer E. Beachley Saw and Planing Mill, the John Farrin Boiler and Machine Shop, and the Vulcan Road Machine Company.

One of the most significant structures to be constructed in Ranson was Hotel Powhatan. This four-story frame Queen Anne structure was located on on 3rd Avenue, between Mildred and Preston Streets. The building was designed by &quot;Baldwin and Pennington, Architects&quot;, and was built by local contractor Julius C. Holmes for $46,500. The hotel opened in October, 1891, but in 1900, it had become the Powhatan College for Young Women. In 1913, the college closed, and in 1915 it was re-opened by the Episcopal Diocese, under the direction of Maria Pendleton Duval, as St. Hilda&#x27;s Hall for Girls, a Christian school. In 1921, a dormitory was added on property across the street from the original building. This new structure was known as Peterkin Hall, and currently houses the offices of Amerigas. In 1931, with the stock market crash, the school closed, and was converted into apartments. The original hotel structure burned to the ground on December 11, 1937.

In 1936, the town of Ranson purchased the former Charles Town Mining, Manufacturing &amp; Improvement Company office building from Mr. Getzendauner for $3,000 for the purposes of establishing a town hall. In 2003, the city began a multi-year renovation of the entire building, bringing it into the 21st century. By 1941, Ranson&#x27;s population was 1,171. Ranson continued to grow and by 1950, the population increased to 1,436. By 1970, the population had increased to 2,189. In 2000, Ranson had a population of 2,951. By 2010, the population was at 4,440, an increase of over 50% in just 10 years. In the 2000s, the City Council saw a need to grow its tax and employment base after the unfortunate closings of AB&amp;C Corporation, Dixie Narco, and Badger Powhatan, and took advantage of the commercial development opportunities along the 4-lane stretch of State Route 9 north of Ranson. Thus, the Council annexed several thousand acres, which now host commercial, residential, and agricultural properties.

With the construction and opening of the new $425,000 Charles Town General Hospital on October 3, 1948, at the original location of the Hotel Powhatan on 3rd Avenue, Ranson began to develop a medical community, with many doctors opening offices in and around the hospital. On April 22, 1975, Jefferson Memorial Hospital (now Jefferson Medical Center) opened at its current facility on Preston Street and 4th Avenue, at a cost of $4.5 million. The current facility continues to serve the residents of Jefferson County. Just outside the limits of Ranson, but extremely important to the community&#x27;s economy, is Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races. This facility provides employment to over 1200 individuals, and generates millions of dollars of taxes to Jefferson County and its municipalities for capital improvements. Thanks, in part, to these proceeds, which began flowing in 2004, the city has been able to purchase police cars and equipment, complete the Mildred Street streetscape project in 2007, which added sidewalks, curb, gutter and benches, renovate and construct parks, and renovate City Hall.

<text>Shepherdstown is a town in Jefferson County, West Virginia, United States, located in the lower Shenandoah Valley along the Potomac River. Home to Shepherd University, the town&#x27;s population was 1,531 at the time of the 2020 census. The town was established in 1762 along with Romney; they are the oldest towns in West Virginia.

==History==
===18th century===
Established on December 23, 1762, by consecutive acts passed by the Virginia House of Burgesses and approved by the governor, Mecklenburg (later renamed Shepherdstown), and Romney in Hampshire County are the oldest towns in West Virginia. On a list of more than 30 approved &quot;publick and private bills&quot; of that date, the bill containing &quot;An Act for establishing the town of Mecklenburg, in the county of Frederick&quot; immediately follows &quot;An act for establishing the town of Romney, in the county of Hampshire, and for other purposes therein-mentioned.&quot;

The first British colonial settlers began their migration into the northern end of the Shenandoah Valley in the early 18th century. Many crossed the Potowmack (now Potomac) River at Pack Horse Ford, about down river from the future site of Shepherdstown. The Colony of Virginia began issuing Valley land grants in the 1730s. In 1734, Thomas Shepherd (1705–1776) was granted on the south side of the Potomac, along the Falling Spring Branch (now known as the Town Run). From that tract he selected and laid out a town. Naming his town Mecklenburg, he petitioned the Virginia General Assembly for a charter, which was granted in 1762.

Shepherd was the sole trustee, owning the town and being responsible for its government. More than six natural springs feed Town Run before it enters the south end of town. It never floods, nor runs dry; it meanders through backyards, under houses, across alleys and beneath five streets. This setting was conducive to millers, tanners, potters, smiths and other artisans. As a result, by 1775, the town boasted 1,000 inhabitants. In 1775, General George Washington issued a call for &quot;Virginia Volunteer Riflemen.&quot; Captain Hugh Stephenson filled the ranks of his company here. The troops departed from &quot;Morgan&#x27;s Spring,&quot; about south of the town limits, on July 16, 1775. This famous &quot;Beeline March to Cambridge&quot; covered in 24 days. Thirty-eight Revolutionary veterans are buried in the surrounding area.

On December 3, 1787, James Rumsey conducted a successful trial of his new invention, the steamboat, in the Potomac at the north end of Princess Street. The first newspaper—&quot;The Potomac Guardian and Berkley Advertiser&quot;—and book (&quot;The Christian Panoply&quot;) in what is now West Virginia were published here (1790s). (The Shepherdstown Public Library has a copy of the book.) Shepherdstown was the birthplace of Robert Lucas (1781), the future governor of Ohio and territorial governor of Iowa.

A second charter, which allowed for self-government, was granted by the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1794. In 1798, the corporate limits were extended and the name was changed to Shepherd&#x27;s Town. After the American Civil War, the town&#x27;s name was officially contracted to Shepherdstown. The clay soil in the area was conducive to brick making. By the late 1790s, there were several commercial brickyards, and kilns could be built with little difficulty. In many instances, bricks were &quot;burnt&quot; at the construction sites. They were plentiful and cheaper than nails. Roofing material affected the market value and the insurance premiums of the brick structures. Those covered with tile were much more valuable than those topped with wooden shingles. Fires starting in the shingles destroyed many brick homes, mills, stores and outbuildings.

===19th century===

Running along the Maryland side of the Potomac River, the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&amp;O) Canal reached Shepherdstown in the early 1830s. Lock no. 38—named &quot;Shepherdstown River Lock&quot;—was built across from Shepherdstown at mile 72.7 of the canal. One of only three of its kind on the canal, it allowed canal boats to transfer between the canal and the river to serve industries in Shepherdstown with shipments of cement, coal, flour, corn, wheat, oats, flour, and timothy seed. Shepherdstown is the only town in West Virginia that has a canal lock named for it.

Two free schools were built in the town in 1848. One still stands on the southeast corner of Princess and New Streets. When West Virginia became the 35th state (in 1863), these became the oldest free schoolhouses in the state.

The Hamtramck Guard (The Shepherdstown Light Infantry) was dispatched to nearby Harpers Ferry to subdue John Brown&#x27;s raid on the federal armory (October 1859). At the outbreak of the Civil War, this group became Company B, 2nd Virginia Infantry, Army of Northern Virginia. They became part of the famous &quot;Stonewall Brigade.&quot;

After the nearby Battle of Antietam in Maryland, September 17, 1862, General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s infantry crossed the Potomac at Pack Horse Ford. The town was overwhelmed with 5,000–8,000 casualties from the battle. Every house, building, church, alley, and street was filled with the wounded and dying. The Battle of Shepherdstown (also known as the Battle of Boteler&#x27;s Ford or Cement Mill) occurred on September 20, 1862, during Lee&#x27;s retreat. More than 100 Confederate soldiers died here and were buried in Elmwood Cemetery. Elmwood contains the graves of 285 Confederate veterans.

From 1865 to 1871, Shepherdstown served as the county seat of Jefferson County due to war damage to the courthouse in Charles Town. The Town Hall (northeast corner of German and King streets) housed the courthouse until it was moved back to Charles Town.

In 1872, the Town Hall Building was chartered as a &quot;Classical and Scientific Institute.&quot; The building was then leased to the state and Shepherd College was born. In 2004, the Shepherd College became Shepherd University. The East Campus occupies about one-third of the town proper, and the West Campus occupies a large area just northwest of the corporate limits.

===20th century to present===

The Shepherdstown Historic District was established and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, with a boundary expansion to include the entire town in 1987. Potomac Mills located nearby in Washington County, Maryland, was added in 2014.

<text>Clendenin is a town in Kanawha County, West Virginia, United States, situated along the Elk River. The population was 850 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In the 1800s, Clendenin was a small settlement at the confluence of Big Sandy Creek and the Elk River that eventually became a small village named Chilton. At this time, timber and coal mining were the principal industries in the area. In 1846, one of the first cannel coal veins was discovered at Falling Rock (only a few miles from Chilton/Clendenin) and became a rich source for manufacturing artificial gas. Clendenin was platted in 1877.

In 1893, the Coal and Coke railroad was built running through Clendenin, paralleling the Elk River and allowing the logging industry to set up residence. Along with the drilling of the first gas well in the area in 1900, this allowed the development of one of the largest oil and gas fields in West Virginia. The town was incorporated in 1904 and named after the Clendenin family, an early pioneer family in the Kanawha River Valley. The first petrochemical plant in the world was built in Clendenin in 1920. This plant was the original Union Carbide Corporation facility. Other chief economic staples included timber, coal, gas, oil, and salt. The decades from 1900 to 1930 saw most of the towns growth, and construction of most of the major buildings in town, including the elementary, middle, and high schools, several large churches, three banks, and several blocks of commercial buildings. When Union Carbide moved their production plant from Falling Rock to Charleston, the economy slowed but Clendenin remained a commercial hub for northern Kanawha County, southern Roane County, and western Clay County until Interstate 79 bypassed the town in the 1980s.

Clendenin suffered damage during the 2016 West Virginia flood. Recovery was largely complete by January 2020, although some homes remained in need of demolition or rebuilding.

The current mayor of Clendenin is Kay Summers. Town elections (including the office of mayor and city council) occur every two years. Recent efforts have been made by 25045-A New Clendenin (a non-profit corporation based in Clendenin) and the Business and Industrial Development Corporation (headquartered in Charleston) to enhance economic and cultural development in the town.

<text>Dunbar is a city in Kanawha County, West Virginia, United States, situated along the Kanawha River. The population was 7,479 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Dunbar was incorporated on April 19, 1921, by an Act of the West Virginia Legislature. Dunbar is on land that was originally occupied by Native Americans with 11 mounds identified in the residential areas. The land was granted to George Washington for his military service and was named for Mary Dunbar after she inherited the land from Washington, although other sources say it was named for Dunbar Baines, a prominent area banker.

Dunbar was a farming community until industries began to evolve in the city with the opening of glass and bottling plants in 1912. The Gravely Plow was invented in Dunbar in 1916.

Located at Dunbar is the Dutch Hollow Wine Cellars, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. The park is listed on the Register due to the walk-in wine cellars located within the Park. In the past the area was known for its vineyards and the cellars were used to store wine made from the grapes grown in the vineyards. The cellars were thought to be built around 1860 due to the popularity of wine-making. The wine was then hauled to Charleston and Cincinnati. After the Civil War, wine making was no longer profitable and the vineyards were abandoned. The popularity of wine in neighboring Virginia and Ohio also had an impact on grape growing in West Virginia. The wine cellars are preserved and protected for future generations due to the foresight of Dunbar to develop the area into a City park.

==Geography==
Dunbar is located at (38.364319, -81.739539). Dunbar is served by Interstate 64 and WV 25.
