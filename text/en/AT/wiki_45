<text>Sizergh Castle is a stately home with garden and estate at Helsington in Cumbria, England, about south of Kendal. Located in historic Westmorland, the castle is a Grade I listed building. While remaining the home of the Hornyold-Strickland family, the castle with its garden and estate is in the care of the National Trust.

In 2016 the Sizergh estate was included in the newly extended Lake District National Park.

== Details ==

The earliest part of the building is a tower of fourteenth or fifteenth century date.

=== Woodwork ===

Some of the early furnishings date from the time of Walter Strickland (1516–1569) who married Alice Tempest in 1560. She made inventories of the house after her husband&#x27;s death. These mention three oak armchairs and three chests still in the house.

There are oak-panelled interiors, including the Inlaid Chamber, where the panelling is inlaid with floral and geometric patterns in pale
poplar and dark bog-oak. The contents of the Inlaid Chamber were sold to the Victoria and Albert Museum in the 1890s and it was displayed as a reconstructed period room.
The return of the panelling to its original location at Sizergh was advocated by among others Mark Girouard, an authority on England&#x27;s country houses. The panelling returned in 1999 under a long-term loan. In 2017 it was reported that transfer of ownership to the National Trust had been made formal.

The bargeboards probably date from the seventeenth century.

=== Paintings ===
The Castle contains a variety of paintings, including the following:

* a collection of portraits of the Catholic Royal Stuart family reflects the Strickland family&#x27;s links to the Jacobite court in exile at Saint-Germain-en-Laye. There are portraits by Alexis Simon Belle, painter in ordinary to James VII &amp; II and the Old Pretender, of Queen Mary of Modena and her daughter Princess Louisa Maria.
* Strickland family portraits, including 
**works by local artist George Romney, 
**a portrait of Mrs. Anne Strickland (the artist&#x27;s mother) by Harriet Strickland (1816–1903), and a portrait of Lady Edeline Sackville.

==History==
The Deincourt family owned this land from the 1170s. On the marriage of Elizabeth Deincourt to Sir William de Stirkeland in 1239, the estate passed into the hands of what became the Strickland family, who owned it until it was gifted to the National Trust in 1950 by Lieutenant Commander Thomas Hornyold-Strickland, 7th Count della Catena, R.N., a grandson of the 1st Baron Strickland.

Katherine Parr, the sixth wife of Henry VIII and a relative of the Stricklands, is thought to have lived here after her first husband, Sir Edward Burgh, died in 1533. Katherine&#x27;s second husband, Lord Latymer, was kin to the dowager Lady Strickland, Katherine Neville.

It was extended in Elizabethan times. Sir Thomas Strickland went into exile with King James II and VII.

Around 1770, the great hall was again expanded in the Georgian style.

==Gardens==

The gardens are registered Grade II. There is a lake, a kitchen garden and a rock garden. The rock garden, constructed in the 1920s, is the largest limestone rock garden belonging to the National Trust.

Sizergh houses part of the National Collection of ferns, which are to be seen in the rock garden, the stumpery and the orchard.

==Estate==
In 1336 a grant from Edward III allowed Sir Walter Strickland to enclose the land around Sizergh as his exclusive park.

The estate covers .

===Biodiversity===

There are various types of habitat on the estate. For example, in 2014 it was reported that 35 ha of wetland habitat was being created in the Lyth Valley on the western edge of the estate. The project received funding from Natural England as part of a higher level stewardship scheme. It is hoped to attract bittern and other wildlife.

Sizergh has received support from the Morecambe Bay Nature Improvement Area which was launched in 2012. It received three years of government grant funding (2012–15). Projects continue under the auspices of the Morecambe Bay Partnership, a registered charity.

====Birds====
The Sizergh estate is a good place to see birds. For example, hawfinches are attracted to hornbeam trees around the main car park, and despite being a shy species can often be seen there in the spring.

====Butterflies====
Fritillary butterflies (including pearl-bordered and high brown fritillary) live on the estate.

===Sizergh Fell===
Sizergh Fell is a hill of , about south-west of the castle. It is classified by the Database of British and Irish Hills as a Tump (Thirty and Upwards Metres Prominence). It has been suggested that a group of stones on the fell form the remains of a stone circle.

==Literary and media interest==
The castle was featured in the ITV documentary &quot;Inside the National Trust&quot;.

The room known as the Inlaid Chamber is the subject of Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poetical illustration &quot;The Queen’s Room, Sizergh Hall, Westmorland&quot; to an engraving of a painting by Thomas Allom, published in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1836.

<doc id="142417" wikidata="Q106428" url="?curid=142417" title="Apollo 13 (film)">
<text>Apollo 13 is a 1995 American docudrama film directed by Ron Howard and starring Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris and Kathleen Quinlan. The screenplay by William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert dramatizes the aborted 1970 Apollo 13 lunar mission and is an adaptation of the 1994 book &quot;Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13&quot;, by astronaut Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger.

The film tells the story of astronauts Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise aboard the ill-fated Apollo 13 for the United States&#x27; fifth crewed mission to the Moon, which was intended to be the third to land. En route, an on-board explosion deprives their spacecraft of much of its oxygen supply and electrical power, which forces NASA&#x27;s flight controllers to abandon the Moon landing and improvise scientific and mechanical solutions to get the three astronauts to Earth safely.

Howard went to great lengths to create a technically accurate movie, employing NASA&#x27;s assistance in astronaut and flight-controller training for his cast and obtaining permission to film scenes aboard a reduced-gravity aircraft for realistic depiction of the weightlessness experienced by the astronauts in space.

Released to cinemas in the United States on June 30, 1995, &quot;Apollo 13&quot; received critical acclaim and was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture (winning for Best Film Editing and Best Sound). The film also won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, as well as two British Academy Film Awards. In total, the film grossed over $355 million worldwide during its theatrical releases.
Since then, it is considered to be among the best films of all time.

In 2023, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.&quot;

== Plot ==

On July 20, 1969, astronaut Jim Lovell hosts a party where guests watch Neil Armstrong&#x27;s televised first steps on the Moon from Apollo 11. Lovell, who orbited the Moon on Apollo 8, tells his wife Marilyn that he will return to the Moon to walk on its surface.

Three months later, as Lovell is conducting a VIP tour of NASA&#x27;s Vehicle Assembly Building, his boss Deke Slayton informs him that his crew will fly Apollo 13 instead of 14, swapping flights with Alan Shepard&#x27;s crew. Lovell, Ken Mattingly, and Fred Haise train for their mission. Days before launch in April 1970, Mattingly is exposed to German measles, and the flight surgeon demands his replacement with Mattingly&#x27;s backup, Jack Swigert. Lovell resists breaking up his team, but relents when Slayton threatens to bump his crew to a later mission. As the launch date approaches, Marilyn has a nightmare about her husband dying in space, and tells Lovell she will not go to Kennedy Space Center to see him off for an unprecedented fourth launch. She later changes her mind and surprises him.

On launch day, Flight Director Gene Kranz in Houston&#x27;s Mission Control Center gives the go for launch. As the Saturn V rocket climbs through the atmosphere, a second stage engine cuts off prematurely, but the craft reaches its Earth parking orbit. After the third stage fires again to send Apollo 13 to the Moon, Swigert performs the maneuver to turn the Command Module &quot;Odyssey&quot; around to dock with the Lunar Module &quot;Aquarius&quot; and pull it away from the spent rocket.

Three days into the mission, by order of Mission Control, Swigert turns on the liquid oxygen stirring fans. An electrical short causes a tank to explode, emptying its contents into space and sending the craft tumbling. The other tank is soon found to be leaking. Consumables manager Sy Liebergot convinces Kranz that shutting off two of &quot;Odyssey&quot;″s three fuel cells offers the best chance to stop the leak, but this does not work. With only one fuel cell, mission rules dictate the Moon landing be aborted. Lovell and Haise power up &quot;Aquarius&quot; to use as a &quot;lifeboat&quot;, while Swigert shuts down &quot;Odyssey&quot; to save its battery power for the return to Earth. Kranz charges his team with bringing the astronauts home, declaring &quot;failure is not an option&quot;. Consumables manager John Aaron recruits Mattingly to help him improvise a procedure to restart &quot;Odyssey&quot; for the landing on Earth.

As the crew watches the Moon pass beneath them, Lovell laments his lost dream of walking on its surface, then turns his crew&#x27;s attention to the business of getting home. With &quot;Aquarius&quot; running on minimal electrical power and rationed water supply, the crew suffers from freezing conditions, and Haise develops a urinary tract infection. Swigert suspects Mission Control is concealing the fact they are doomed; Haise angrily blames Swigert&#x27;s inexperience for the accident; but Lovell quashes the argument. As &quot;Aquarius&quot;″s carbon dioxide filters run out, concentration of the gas approaches a dangerous level. Ground control improvises a &quot;Rube Goldberg&quot; device to make the Command Module&#x27;s incompatible filter cartridges work in the Lunar Module. With &quot;Aquarius&quot;″s navigation systems shut down, the crew makes a vital course correction manually by steering the Lunar Module and controlling its engine.

Mattingly and Aaron struggle to find a way to power up the Command Module systems without drawing too much power, and finally read the procedure to Swigert, who restarts &quot;Odyssey&quot; by drawing the extra power from &quot;Aquarius&quot;. When the crew jettisons the Service Module, they are surprised by the extent of the damage, raising the possibility that the ablative heat shield was compromised. As they release &quot;Aquarius&quot; and re-enter the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, no one is sure that &quot;Odyssey&quot;″s heat shield is intact.

The tense period of radio silence due to ionization blackout is longer than normal, but the astronauts report all is well, and the world watches &quot;Odyssey&quot; splash down and celebrates their return. As helicopters bring the crew aboard the USS &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; for a hero&#x27;s welcome, Lovell&#x27;s voice-over describes the cause of the explosion, and the subsequent careers of Haise, Swigert, Mattingly, and Kranz. He wonders if and when mankind will return to the Moon.

== Production ==

=== Development ===
The movie rights to Jim Lovell&#x27;s book &quot;Lost Moon&quot; were being shopped to potential buyers before it was written. He stated that his first reaction was that Kevin Costner would be a good choice to play him.

=== Pre-production ===
The original screenplay by William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert was written with Costner in mind because of his facial similarities with Lovell. By the time Ron Howard acquired the director&#x27;s position, Tom Hanks had expressed interest in doing a film based on Apollo 13. When Hanks&#x27; representative informed him that a script was being passed around he had it sent to him, and Costner&#x27;s name never came up in serious discussion. Hanks was ultimately cast as Lovell because of his knowledge of Apollo and space history.

Because of his interest in aviation, John Travolta asked Howard for the role of Lovell, but was politely turned down. John Cusack was offered the role of Fred Haise but turned it down, and the role went to Bill Paxton. Brad Pitt was offered the role of Jack Swigert, but also turned it down in favor of &quot;Seven&quot;, so the role went to Kevin Bacon. Howard invited Gary Sinise to read for any of the characters, and Sinise chose Ken Mattingly.

After Hanks had been cast and construction of the spacecraft sets had begun, John Sayles rewrote the script. While planning the film, Howard decided that every shot would be original and that no mission footage would be used. The spacecraft interiors were constructed by the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center&#x27;s Space Works, which also restored the Apollo 13 Command Module. Two individual Lunar Modules and two Command Modules were constructed for filming. Composed of some original Apollo materials, they were built so that different sections were removable, which allowed filming to take place inside them. Space Works also built modified Command and Lunar Modules for filming inside a Boeing KC-135 reduced-gravity aircraft, and the pressure suits worn by the actors, which are exact reproductions of those worn by the Apollo astronauts, right down to the detail of being airtight. When suited up with their helmets locked in place, the actors were cooled by and breathed air pumped into the suits, as in actual Apollo suits.

The Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center consisted of two control rooms on the second and third floors of Building 30 at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. NASA offered the use of the control room for filming, but Howard declined, opting instead to make his own replica. Production designer Michael Corenblith and set decorator Merideth Boswell were in charge of the construction of the Mission Control set at Universal Studios. It was equipped with giant rear-screen projection capabilities, and a complex set of computers with individual video feeds to all the flight controller stations. The actors playing the flight controllers could communicate with each other on a private audio loop. The Mission Control room built for the film was on the ground floor. One NASA employee, a consultant for the film, said the set was so realistic that he would leave at the end of the day and look for the elevator before he remembered he was not in Mission Control. The recovery ship USS &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; had been scrapped by the time the film was made, so her sister ship, &quot;New Orleans&quot;, was used instead.

To prepare for their roles in the film, Hanks, Paxton, and Bacon all attended the U.S. Space Camp in Huntsville, Alabama. While there, astronauts Jim Lovell and David Scott, commander of Apollo 15, did actual training exercises with the actors inside a simulated Command Module and Lunar Module. The actors were also taught about each of the 500 buttons, toggles, and switches used to operate the spacecraft. The actors then traveled to Johnson Space Center in Houston where they flew in the KC-135 to simulate weightlessness in outer space.

Each member of the cast performed extensive research for the project to provide an authentic story. Technical adviser Scott was impressed with their efforts, stating that each actor was determined to make every scene technically correct, word for word.

In Los Angeles, Ed Harris and all the actors portraying flight controllers enrolled in a Flight Controller School led by Gerry Griffin, an Apollo 13 flight director, and flight controller Jerry Bostick. The actors studied audiotapes from the mission, reviewed hundreds of pages of NASA transcripts, and attended a crash course in physics.

Reportedly, Pete Conrad expressed interest in appearing in the film.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography for &quot;Apollo 13&quot; started in August 1994.
Howard anticipated difficulty in portraying weightlessness in a realistic manner. He discussed this with Steven Spielberg, who suggested filming aboard the KC-135 airplane, which can be flown in such a way as to create about 23 seconds of weightlessness, a method NASA has always used to train its astronauts for space flight. Howard obtained NASA&#x27;s permission and assistance to obtain three hours and 54 minutes of filming time in 612 zero-g maneuvers. Filming in this environment was a time and cost saver because the stage recreation and computer graphics would have been expensive. The final three weeks of filming took place in the stages on the Universal Studios Lot in Universal City, California, where two life-size replicas of both the command module and the lunar module were built for simultaneous shooting on different soundstages. Air-cooling units lowered the temperatures inside each soundstage to around , to simulate the conditions necessary for condensation and the visibility of the actors&#x27; breath inside the spacecraft. Filming wrapped on February 25, 1995. The final scene to be filmed was the splashdown sequence at the film&#x27;s conclusion, which was shot on a large, artificial lake on the Universal lot.

==== Safety ====
While filming in a 25-second burst of weightlessness was &quot;charged and frenetic&quot;, the cast and crew only suffered from bumps and bruises, and most injuries occurred when they bumped on non-padded items. The cast and crew of &quot;Apollo 13&quot; describe the weightlessness experience as being in a &quot;vomit comet&quot; and &quot;roller coaster ride&quot;, but the motion sickness afflicted only a few members.

During filming of the low-temperature scenes in the Universal stages, signs that explained frostbite symptoms were posted on the stages&#x27; walls, and the crew worked in parkas.

=== Post-production ===
The visual effects supervisor was Robert Legato.
To avoid awkward visible switches to stock news footage in a live action film, he decided to produce the Saturn V launch sequence using miniature models and digital image stitching to create a panoramic background. On Howard&#x27;s request to &quot;shoot it like Martin Scorsese would shoot it&quot;, Legato studied Scorsese&#x27;s scenes of pool games from &quot;The Color of Money&quot;, and copied his technique of creating a sense of rhythm by repeating two or three frames between each cut (just enough to be undetectable) for the engine ignition sequence. Legato says this scene inspired James Horner&#x27;s soundtrack music for the launch. The long-range shot of the vehicle in flight was filmed using a $25 1:144 scale model Revell kit, with the camera realistically shaking, and it was digitized and re-filmed off of a high resolution monitor through a black filter, slightly overexposed to keep it from &quot;looking like a video game&quot;.

The exhaust of the attitude control thrusters was generated with computer-generated imagery (CGI). This was also attempted to show the astronaut&#x27;s urine dump into space, but wasn&#x27;t high enough resolution to look right, so droplets sprayed from an Evian bottle were photographed instead.

The producers wanted to use CGI to render the splashdown, but Legato adamantly insisted this would not look realistic. Real parachutes were used with a prop capsule tossed out of a helicopter.

During weightless filming, all of the dialogue had been rendered unusable by the loudness of the plane. This required Hanks, Bacon and Paxton to attend ADR sessions, where they redubbed all of the lines for the weightless scenes.

== Soundtrack ==

The score to &quot;Apollo 13&quot; was composed and conducted by James Horner. The soundtrack was released in 1995 by MCA Records and has seven tracks of score, eight period songs used in the film, and seven tracks of dialogue by the actors at a total running time of nearly seventy-eight minutes. The music also features solos by vocalist Annie Lennox and Tim Morrison on the trumpet. The score was a critical success and garnered Horner an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score.

== Release ==
=== Theatrical ===
&quot;Apollo 13&quot; was released on June 30, 1995, in North America and on September 22, 1995, in the United Kingdom.

In September 2002, the film was re-released in IMAX. It was the first film to be digitally remastered using IMAX DMR technology.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Apollo 13&quot; was released on VHS on November 21, 1995 and on LaserDisc the following week. On September 9, 1997, the film debuted on a THX certified widescreen VHS release.

A 10th-anniversary DVD of the film was released in 2005; it included both the original theatrical version and the IMAX version, along with several extras. The IMAX version has a 1.66:1 aspect ratio.

In 2006, &quot;Apollo 13&quot; was released on HD DVD and on April 13, 2010, it was released on Blu-ray as the 15th-anniversary edition on the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 13 accident. The film was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray on October 17, 2017.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Apollo 13&quot; earned $25,353,380 from 2,347 theaters during its opening weekend, which made up 14.7% of the total US gross. Upon its opening, it was ranked number one at the box office, beating &quot;Pocahontas&quot;. Additionally, it surpassed &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; for having the largest opening weekend for a Tom Hanks film. Within five days, &quot;Apollo 13&quot; generated $38.5 million, becoming the second-highest five-day opening of all time, behind &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. The film earned $154 million from ticket sales, surpassing the previous record held by the combined Thanksgiving 1992 openings of &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; and &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot;. It would continue to stay in the number one spot for four weeks until it was dethroned by &quot;Waterworld&quot;. Earning $355,237,933, &quot;Apollo 13&quot; was the third-highest-grossing film of 1995, behind &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot; and &quot;Toy Story&quot; (which also starred Hanks).

=== Critical response ===
 Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised the film in his review, saying: &quot;This is a powerful story, one of the year&#x27;s best films, told with great clarity and remarkable technical detail, and acted without pumped-up histrionics.&quot; Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; highly praised the film, saying: &quot;From lift-off to splashdown, &quot;Apollo 13&quot; gives one hell of a ride.&quot; Edward Guthmann of &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; gave a mixed review and wrote: &quot;I just wish that &quot;Apollo 13&quot; worked better as a movie, and that Howard&#x27;s threshold for corn, mush and twinkly sentiment weren&#x27;t so darn wide.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the film and wrote: &quot;Howard lays off the manipulation to tell the true story of the near-fatal 1970 Apollo 13 mission in painstaking and lively detail. It&#x27;s easily Howard&#x27;s best film.&quot;

Janet Maslin made the film an &quot;NYT&quot; Critics&#x27; Pick, calling it an &quot;absolutely thrilling&quot; film that &quot;unfolds with perfect immediacy, drawing viewers into the nail-biting suspense of a spellbinding true story.&quot; According to Maslin, &quot;like &quot;Quiz Show&quot;, &quot;Apollo 13&quot; beautifully evokes recent history in ways that resonate strongly today. Cleverly nostalgic in its visual style (Rita Ryack&#x27;s costumes are especially right), it harks back to movie making without phony heroics and to the strong spirit of community that enveloped the astronauts and their families. Amazingly, this film manages to seem refreshingly honest while still conforming to the three-act dramatic format of a standard Hollywood hit. It is far and away the best thing Mr. Howard has done (and &quot;Far and Away&quot; was one of the other kind).&quot;

The academic critic Raymond Malewitz focuses on the DIY aspects of the &quot;mailbox&quot; filtration system to illustrate the emergence of an unlikely hero in late 20th-century American culture—&quot;the creative, improvisational, but restrained thinker—who replaces the older prodigal cowboy heroes of American mythology and provides the country a better, more frugal example of an appropriate &#x27;husband&#x27;.&quot;

Marilyn Lovell praised Quinlan&#x27;s portrayal of her, stating she felt she could feel what Quinlan&#x27;s character was going through, and remembered how she felt in her mind.

== Accolades ==

== Technical and historical accuracy ==

In the film, Lovell tells his wife he was given command of Apollo 13 instead of 14 because original commander Alan Shepard&#x27;s &quot;ear infection is flaring up again&quot;; in fact, Shepard had no &quot;ear infection&quot;; he had been grounded since 1963 by Ménière&#x27;s disease. This was surgically corrected four years later and he was returned to flight duty in May 1969; Manned Spacecraft Center management felt he needed more training time for a lunar mission.

The film portrays the Saturn V launch vehicle being rolled out to the launch pad two days before launch. In reality, the launch vehicle was rolled out on the Mobile Launcher using the crawler-transporter two months before the launch date.

The film depicts the crew hearing a bang shortly after Swigert followed directions from mission control to stir the oxygen and hydrogen tanks. In reality, the crew heard the bang 95 seconds later.

The film depicts Sy Liebergot suggesting that the oxygen leak was in one or two of &quot;Odyssey&quot;″s fuel cells, and the order to shut them down was passed up to the crew, forcing abort of the lunar landing mission. In reality, Mission Control &quot;did not&quot; order the shutdown; Haise found the cells were already dead, because of starvation due to the damage to the oxygen system.

The film depicts Swigert and Haise arguing about who was at fault. The show &quot;The Real Story: Apollo 13&quot; broadcast on the Smithsonian Channel includes Haise stating that no such argument took place and that there was no way anyone could have foreseen that stirring the tank would cause problems. Similarly on the BBC &quot;13 Minutes to the Moon&quot; program, backup lunar module pilot on the mission Charles Duke says the film portrayed Swigert as unprepared for the flight, but it was untrue and that Swigert was very familiar with the module as he had also long worked on developing it.

The dialogue between ground control and the astronauts was taken nearly verbatim from transcripts and recordings, with the exception of one of the taglines of the film, &quot;Houston, we have a problem.&quot; (This quote was voted #50 on the list &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes&quot;.) According to audio of the air-to-ground communications, the actual words uttered by Swigert were &quot;Okay, Houston, we&#x27;ve had a problem here&quot;. Ground control responded by saying, &quot;This is Houston. Say again, please.&quot; Jim Lovell then repeated, &quot;Houston, we&#x27;ve had a problem.&quot;

One other incorrect dialogue is after the re-entry blackout. In the film, Tom Hanks (as Lovell) says &quot;Hello Houston... this is &quot;Odyssey&quot;... it&#x27;s good to see you again.&quot; In the actual re-entry, the Command Module&#x27;s transmission was finally acquired by a Sikorsky SH-3D Sea King recovery helicopter which then relayed communications to Mission Control. CAPCOM astronaut Joe Kerwin (not Mattingly, who serves as CAPCOM in this scene in the film) then made a call to the spacecraft &quot;Odyssey, Houston standing by. Over.&quot; Swigert, not Lovell, replied &quot;Okay, Joe,&quot; and unlike the film, this was well before the parachutes deployed; the celebrations depicted at Mission Control were triggered by visual confirmation of their deployment.

The tagline &quot;Failure is not an option&quot;, stated in the film by Gene Kranz, also became very popular, but was not taken from the historical transcripts. The following story relates the origin of the phrase, from an e-mail by Apollo 13 Flight Dynamics Officer Jerry Bostick:
As far as the expression &quot;Failure is not an option,&quot; you are correct that Kranz never used that term. In preparation for the movie, the script writers, Al Reinart and Bill Broyles, came down to Clear Lake to interview me on &quot;What are the people in Mission Control really like?&quot; One of their questions was &quot;Weren&#x27;t there times when everybody, or at least a few people, just panicked?&quot; My answer was &quot;No, when bad things happened, we just calmly laid out all the options, and failure was not one of them. We never panicked, and we never gave up on finding a solution.&quot; I immediately sensed that Bill Broyles wanted to leave and assumed that he was bored with the interview. Only months later did I learn that when they got in their car to leave, he started screaming, &quot;That&#x27;s it! That&#x27;s the tag line for the whole movie, Failure is not an option. Now we just have to figure out who to have say it.&quot; Of course, they gave it to the Kranz character, and the rest is history.

In the film, Flight Director Gene Kranz and his White Team are portrayed as managing all of the essential parts of the flight, from liftoff to landing. Consequently, the actual role of the other flight directors and teams, especially Glynn Lunney and his Black Team, were neglected. In fact, it was Flight Director Lunney and his Black Team who got Apollo 13 through its most critical period in the hours immediately after the explosion, including the mid-course correction that sent Apollo 13 on a &quot;free return&quot; trajectory around the Moon and back to the Earth. Astronaut Ken Mattingly, who was replaced as Apollo 13 Command Module Pilot at the last minute by Swigert, later said:
If there was a hero, Glynn Lunney was, by himself, a hero, because when he walked in the room, I guarantee you, nobody knew what the hell was going on. Glynn walked in, took over this mess, and he just brought calm to the situation. I&#x27;ve never seen such an extraordinary example of leadership in my entire career. Absolutely magnificent. No general or admiral in wartime could ever be more magnificent than Glynn was that night. He and he alone brought all of the scared people together. And you&#x27;ve got to remember that the flight controllers in those days were—they were kids in their thirties. They were good, but very few of them had ever run into these kinds of choices in life, and they weren&#x27;t used to that. All of a sudden, their confidence had been shaken. They were faced with things that they didn&#x27;t understand, and Glynn walked in there, and he just kind of took charge.

A DVD commentary track, recorded by Jim and Marilyn Lovell and included with the Signature Laserdisc and later included on both DVD versions, mentions several inaccuracies included in the film, all done for reasons of artistic license:

* In the film, Mattingly plays a key role in solving a power consumption problem that Apollo 13 faced as it approached re-entry. Lovell points out in his commentary that this was actually a composite of several astronauts and engineers—including Charles Duke (whose rubella led to Mattingly&#x27;s grounding)—all of whom worked to solve that problem.
* When Swigert is getting ready to dock with the LM, a concerned NASA technician says: &quot;If Swigert can&#x27;t dock this thing, we don&#x27;t have a mission.&quot; Lovell and Haise also seem worried. In his DVD commentary, the real Jim Lovell says that if Swigert had been unable to dock with the LM, he or Haise could have done it. He also says that Swigert was a well-trained Command Module Pilot, and no one was really worried about whether he was up to the job, but he admitted that it made a nice subplot for the film. What the astronauts were really worried about, Lovell says, was the expected rendezvous between the Lunar Module and the Command Module after Lovell and Haise left the surface of the Moon.
* A scene set the night before the launch, showing the astronauts&#x27; family members saying their goodbyes while separated by a road, to reduce the possibility of any last-minute transmission of disease, depicted a tradition that did not begin until the Space Shuttle program.
* The film depicts Marilyn Lovell accidentally dropping her wedding ring down a shower drain. According to Jim Lovell, this did occur, but the drain trap caught the ring and his wife was able to retrieve it. Lovell has also confirmed that the scene in which his wife had a nightmare about him being &quot;sucked through an open door of a spacecraft into outer space&quot; also occurred, though he believes the nightmare was prompted by her seeing a scene in &quot;Marooned&quot;, a 1969 film they saw three months before Apollo 13 launched.

<doc id="142421" wikidata="Q720724" url="?curid=142421" title="Babe (film)">
<text>Babe is a 1995 comedy-drama film directed by Chris Noonan, produced by George Miller and written by both. It is an adaptation of Dick King-Smith&#x27;s 1983 novel &quot;The Sheep-Pig&quot;, which tells the story of a farm pig who wants to do the work of a sheepdog. The film is narrated by Roscoe Lee Browne and the main animal characters are played by both real animals and animatronic puppets.

&quot;Babe&quot; was filmed in Robertson, New South Wales, in 1994 and released theatrically in the United States and Canada on 4 August 1995, going on to become a critical and commercial success with several Academy Award nominations. 

==Plot==

After being used in a &quot;guess the weight&quot; contest at a county fair, orphaned pig Babe is brought home to the farm of the contest winner, Arthur Hoggett. There he is taken in by Border Collie Fly, her irascible mate Rex and their puppies and befriends a duck named Ferdinand, who wakes people by crowing like a rooster every morning so he will be considered useful and be spared from being eaten. 

Dismayed when the Hoggetts buy an alarm clock, Ferdinand persuades Babe to help him get rid of it. In doing so, they wake Duchess, the Hoggetts&#x27; cat, and wreck the house in the ensuing chaos. Rex sternly instructs Babe to stay away from Ferdinand and the house. Seeing Fly saddened when her puppies are put up for sale, Babe lets her adopt him. With the Hoggett&#x27;s relatives visiting for Christmas, Hoggett decides against choosing Babe for Christmas dinner, and tells his wife Esme that Babe may bring a prize for ham at the next county fair. Ferdinand&#x27;s love interest Rosanna is served instead, prompting Ferdinand to escape the farm. Babe investigates the fields, where he witnesses a pair of sheep rustlers stealing Hoggett&#x27;s sheep and quickly alerts Fly and the farmer, preventing the rustlers from taking the whole flock. 

Impressed after seeing Babe sort hens, separating the brown from the white ones, Hoggett takes him to try and herd the sheep. Encouraged by an elderly ewe named Maa, Babe gets the sheep to cooperate by asking nicely, but Rex perceives Babe&#x27;s actions as an insult to sheepdogs. When Fly stands up for Babe, Rex attacks and injures her and bites Hoggett&#x27;s hand when he tries to intervene. Rex is subsequently chained to the dog house and sedated, leaving the sheep herding job to Babe. One morning, Babe scares off a trio of feral dogs attacking the sheep, but Maa is mortally injured and dies as a result. Hoggett, thinking Babe was responsible, prepares to shoot him, but Fly finds out the truth from the other sheep and distracts Hoggett long enough for Esme to inform him about the dogs&#x27; attacks on neighbouring farms.
When Esme leaves on a trip, Hoggett signs Babe up for a local sheep herding competition. As it is raining the night before, Hoggett lets him and Fly into the house, where he is scratched by Duchess, who in turn is temporarily confined outside as punishment. When she is let back in later, she gets revenge on Babe by revealing that humans consume pigs. After learning from Fly that this is true, Babe runs away and Rex finds him the next morning in a cemetery. Hoggett brings a demoralised Babe home, where he refuses to eat. Hoggett feeds him from a baby bottle, sings &quot;If I Had Words&quot; and dances a jig for him, restoring Babe&#x27;s faith in Hoggett&#x27;s affection.
At the competition, Babe meets the sheep that he will be herding, but they ignore his attempts to speak to them. As Hoggett is criticised by the bemused judges and ridiculed by the public for using a pig instead of a dog, Rex runs back to the farm to ask the sheep what to do. After promising he will treat them better from now on, the sheep disclose to him a secret password. He returns in time to convey the password to Babe, and the sheep now follow his instructions flawlessly. Amid the crowd&#x27;s acclamation, Babe is unanimously given a perfect score. When Babe sits down next to the farmer, Hoggett praises him with the standard command to sheep dogs that their job is done, &quot;That&#x27;ll do, Pig. That&#x27;ll do.&quot;

==Production==
&quot;Babe&quot; is an adaptation of Dick King-Smith&#x27;s 1983 novel &quot;The Sheep-Pig&quot;, also known as &quot;Babe: The Gallant Pig&quot; in the US, which tells the story of a pig raised as livestock who wants to do the work of a sheepdog. The main animal characters are played by a combination of real and animatronic pigs and Border Collies. The breed of pig used was a Large White, which grows rapidly. On account of this, 46 piglets of the required size were used during the course of the filming, as well as the animatronic model for visual effects.

The film is divided into six chapters to preserve the storybook-like feel of the original novel (although none of the film&#x27;s chapters are the same as the book&#x27;s). The film&#x27;s mice characters were subsequently added to read the chapter titles aloud after a test screening in which producer George Miller noted that younger audiences had trouble reading them, needing help from the adults.

After seven years of development, &quot;Babe&quot; was filmed in Robertson, New South Wales, Australia. The talking-animal visual effects were done by Rhythm &amp; Hues Studios (R&amp;H), Animal Logic and Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop.

According to actor James Cromwell, there was tension on the set between producer George Miller and director Chris Noonan. Noonan later complained, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to make a lifelong enemy of George Miller but I thought that he tried to take credit for &quot;Babe&quot;, tried to exclude me from any credit, and it made me very insecure... It was like your guru has told you that you are no good and that is really disconcerting.&quot;

Miller shot back, &quot;Chris said something that is defamatory: that I took his name off the credits on internet sites, which is just absolutely untrue. You know, I&#x27;m sorry but I really have a lot more to do with my life than worry about that... when it comes to &quot;Babe&quot;, the vision was handed to Chris on a plate.&quot;

Interviewed about the movie in 2020, Cromwell admitted he nearly turned it down, as his character only had about 16 lines. He was persuaded by his friend Charles Keating to take it anyway. Keating told him: &quot;it&#x27;s a free ticket to Australia, and if the movie tanks, it&#x27;s not your fault, it&#x27;s the pig&#x27;s fault.&quot; Cromwell said Noonan wanted him for the part, and won out over Miller, who had wanted to cast an Australian actor. Cromwell&#x27;s fee was around $50,000. He asked for an increase when he realised the movie was making millions of dollars, but was turned down. Nevertheless, he said &quot;I got a lot out of that film, and it turned my whole life around. I didn&#x27;t have to audition anymore.&quot;

In 1998, a sequel directed by Miller, &quot;&quot;, was released, but it failed to achieve the same success as the first film. In 2006, a video game based on the original film was published by Mastertronic Group for the PlayStation 2.

==Music==
The musical score for &quot;Babe&quot; was composed by Nigel Westlake and performed by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. Classical orchestral music by 19th-century French composers is used throughout the film, but is disguised in a variety of ways and often integrated by Westlake into his score. The theme song &quot;If I Had Words&quot; (lyrics by Jonathan Hodge), sung by Hoggett near the film&#x27;s conclusion, is an adaptation of the &quot;Maestoso&quot; final movement of the &quot;Organ Symphony&quot; by Camille Saint-Saëns, and was originally performed in 1977 by Scott Fitzgerald and Yvonne Keeley. This tune also recurs throughout the film&#x27;s score.

There are also brief quotations within the score from Edvard Grieg&#x27;s Lyric Pieces, Op.71 No. 1. Other music featured is by Léo Delibes, Richard Rodgers, Gabriel Fauré, and Georges Bizet.

==Reception==
&quot;Babe&quot; was a box office success, grossing A$36.7 million (US$29 million) at the box office in Australia; US$64 million in the United States and Canada; US$34 million in the United Kingdom and over US$254 million worldwide. It was the second highest-grossing Australian film in Australia, behind &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot;. It also received critical acclaim and was ultimately nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor for James Cromwell, Best Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, Best Art Direction and Best Film Editing, winning Best Visual Effects. At the APRA Music Awards of 1996 it won Best Film Score for Westlake&#x27;s work. In 2006, the American Film Institute named &quot;Babe&quot; #80 on its list of America&#x27;s Most Inspiring Movies. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 97% based on 70 reviews, with a rating average of 8.26/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;The rare family-friendly feature with a heart as big as its special effects budget, &quot;Babe&quot; offers timeless entertainment for viewers of all ages.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 83 based on 16 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Because of its subject being a piglet, &quot;Babe&quot; was initially banned from Malaysia in order to avoid upsetting or annoying Muslims (who view pigs as haram). The ruling was overturned almost a year later, and the film was released direct-to-video.

When &quot;Babe&quot; was released in the US, it is reported that &quot;activists around the country staked out movie theaters with flyers documenting the real-life abuses of pigs&quot;. The film had a marked effect on the growth of vegetarianism, particularly among the young. It also promoted a more sympathetic view of the intellectual, emotional and social capacities of animals. James Cromwell became an ethical vegetarian as a result of starring as Farmer Hoggett, saying: &quot;I decided that to be able to talk about this [movie] with conviction, I needed to become a vegetarian.&quot; In 1996, he went on to organise a vegetarian dinner for the Los Angeles homeless at a &quot;Compassionate Christmas&quot; event in order to reverse the barnyard view that &quot;Christmas is carnage&quot;.

<text>Theodore Metochites (; 1270–1332) was a Byzantine Greek statesman, author, gentleman philosopher, and patron of the arts. From c. 1305 to 1328 he held the position of personal adviser (&quot;mesazōn&quot;) to emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos.

== Life ==
Metochites was born in Constantinople as the son of the archdeacon George Metochites, a fervent supporter of the union of the Orthodox and Catholic Churches. After the Council of Blachernae in 1285, his father was condemned and exiled, and Metochites seems to have spent his adolescence in the monastic milieux of Bithynia in Asia Minor. He devoted himself to studies of both secular and religious authors. When Andronicus II visited Nicaea in 1290/91, Metochites made such an impression on him that he was immediately called to the court and made Logothete of the Herds. Little more than a year later, he was appointed a Senator. Besides carrying out his political duties (embassies to Cilicia in 1295 and to Serbia in 1299), Metochites continued to study and to write. In 1312/13, he started learning astronomy from Manuel Bryennios; later he himself became the teacher of Nicephorus Gregoras. He was married with five sons and one daughter, Irene (spouse of John Komnenos Palaiologos).

Metochites&#x27; political career culminated in 1321, when he was invested as Grand Logothete. He was then at the summit of his power, and also one of the richest men of his age. Some of the money was spent on restoring and decorating the church of the Chora monastery in the northwest of Constantinople, where Metochites&#x27; donor portrait can still be seen in a famous mosaic in the narthex, above the entrance to the nave.

Metochites&#x27; fortunes were, however, linked with his emperor&#x27;s. After a few years of intermittent civil war, Andronicus II was overthrown in 1328 by his own grandson, Andronicus III Palaeologus. Metochites went down with him. He was deprived of his possessions and forced into exile in Didymoteichon. In 1330, he was allowed to return to Constantinople. He then withdrew to Chora, where he died on 13 March 1332, having adopted the monastic name Theoleptos.

== Works ==
Metochites&#x27; extant œuvre comprises 20 &quot;Poems&quot; in dactylic hexameter, 18 orations (&quot;Logoi&quot;), &quot;Commentaries&quot; on Aristotle&#x27;s writings on natural philosophy, an introduction to the study of Ptolemaic astronomy (&quot;Stoicheiosis astronomike&quot;), and 120 essays on various subjects, the &quot;Semeioseis gnomikai&quot;. Many of these works are still unedited.

<text>Herpetology (from Greek ἑρπετόν &quot;herpetón&quot;, meaning &quot;reptile&quot; or &quot;creeping animal&quot;) is a branch of zoology concerned with the study of amphibians (including frogs, salamanders, and caecilians (Gymnophiona)) and reptiles (including snakes, lizards, turtles, crocodilians, and tuataras). Birds, which are cladistically included within Reptilia, are traditionally excluded here; the separate scientific study of birds is the subject of ornithology.

The precise definition of herpetology is the study of ectothermic (cold-blooded) tetrapods. This definition of &quot;herps&quot; (otherwise called &quot;herptiles&quot; or &quot;herpetofauna&quot;) excludes fish; however, it is not uncommon for herpetological and ichthyological scientific societies to collaborate. For instance, groups such as the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists have co-published journals and hosted conferences to foster the exchange of ideas between the fields. Herpetological societies are formed to promote interest in reptiles and amphibians, both captive and wild.

Herpetological studies can offer benefits relevant to other fields by providing research on the role of amphibians and reptiles in global ecology. For example, by monitoring amphibians that are very sensitive to environmental changes, herpetologists record visible warnings that significant climate changes are taking place. Although they can be deadly, some toxins and venoms produced by reptiles and amphibians are useful in human medicine. Currently, some snake venom has been used to create anti-coagulants that work to treat strokes and heart attacks.

==Naming and etymology==
The word &quot;herpetology&quot; is from Greek: ἑρπετόν, &quot;herpetón&quot;, &quot;creeping animal&quot; and , &quot;-logia&quot;, &quot;knowledge&quot;. 

&quot;Herp&quot; is a vernacular term for non-avian reptiles and amphibians. It is derived from the archaic term &quot;herpetile&quot;, with roots back to Linnaeus&#x27;s classification of animals, in which he grouped reptiles and amphibians in the same class. There are over 6700 species of amphibians and over 9000 species of reptiles. Despite its modern taxonomic irrelevance, the term has persisted, particularly in the names of herpetology, the scientific study of non-avian reptiles and amphibians, and herpetoculture, the captive care and breeding of reptiles and amphibians.

==Subfields==
The field of herpetology can be divided into areas dealing with particular taxonomic groups such as frogs and other amphibians (batrachology), snakes (ophiology or ophidiology), lizards (saurology) and turtles (cheloniology, chelonology, or testudinology).

More generally, herpetologists work on functional problems in the ecology, evolution, physiology, behavior, taxonomy, or molecular biology of amphibians and reptiles. Amphibians or reptiles can be used as model organisms for specific questions in these fields, such as the role of frogs in the ecology of a wetland. All of these areas are related through their evolutionary history, an example being the evolution of viviparity (including behavior and reproduction).

==Careers==
Career options in the field of herpetology include lab research, field studies and surveys, assistance in veterinary and medical procedures, zoological staff, museum staff, and college teaching.

In modern academic science, it is rare for an individual to solely consider themselves to be a herpetologist. Most individuals focus on a particular field such as ecology, evolution, taxonomy, physiology, or molecular biology, and within that field ask questions pertaining to or best answered by examining reptiles and amphibians. For example, an evolutionary biologist who is also a herpetologist may choose to work on an issue such as the evolution of warning coloration in coral snakes.

Modern herpetological writers include Mark O&#x27;Shea and Philip Purser. Modern herpetological showmen include Jeff Corwin, Steve Irwin (popularly known as the &quot;Crocodile Hunter&quot;), and Austin Stevens, popularly known as &quot;Austin Snakeman&quot; in the TV series &quot;Austin Stevens: Snakemaster&quot;.

Herpetology is an established hobby around the world due to the varied biodiversity in many environments. Many amateur herpetologists coin themselves as &quot;herpers&quot;.

==Study==
Most colleges or universities do not offer a major in herpetology at the undergraduate or the graduate level. Instead, persons interested in herpetology select a major in the biological sciences. The knowledge learned about all aspects of the biology of animals is then applied to an individual study of herpetology.

==Journals==
Herpetology research is published in academic journals including &quot;Ichthyology &amp; Herpetology,&quot; founded in 1913 (under the name &quot;Copeia&quot; in honour of Edward Drinker Cope); &quot;Herpetologica,&quot; founded in 1936; &quot;Reptiles and amphibians&quot;, founded in 1990; and &quot;Contemporary Herpetology,&quot; founded in 1997 and stopped publishing in 2009.

<text>Sense and Sensibility is a 1995 period drama film directed by Ang Lee and based on Jane Austen&#x27;s 1811 novel. Emma Thompson wrote the screenplay and stars as Elinor Dashwood, while Kate Winslet plays Elinor&#x27;s younger sister Marianne. The story follows the Dashwood sisters, members of a wealthy English family of landed gentry, as they must deal with circumstances of sudden destitution. They are forced to seek financial security through marriage. Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman play their respective suitors.

Producer Lindsay Doran, a long time admirer of Austen&#x27;s novel, hired Thompson to write the screenplay. She spent five years drafting numerous revisions, continually working on the script between other films as well as into production of the film itself. Studios were nervous that Thompson—a first-time screenwriter—was the credited writer, but Columbia Pictures agreed to distribute the film. Though initially intending to have another actress portray Elinor, Thompson was persuaded to take the role. Thompson&#x27;s screenplay exaggerated the Dashwood family&#x27;s wealth to make their later scenes of poverty more apparent to modern audiences. It also altered the traits of the male leads to make them more appealing to contemporary viewers. Elinor and Marianne&#x27;s different characteristics were emphasised through imagery and invented scenes. Lee was selected as director, both for his work in the 1993 film &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot; and because Doran believed he would help the film appeal to a wider audience. Lee was given a budget of $16 million.

&quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; was released on 13 December 1995, in the United States. A commercial success, earning $135 million worldwide, the film garnered overwhelmingly positive reviews upon release and received many accolades, including three awards and eleven nominations at the 1995 British Academy Film Awards. It earned seven Academy Awards nominations, including for Best Picture and Best Actress. Thompson received the award for Best Adapted Screenplay, becoming the only person to have won Academy Awards for both acting and screenwriting. &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; contributed to a resurgence in popularity for Austen&#x27;s works, and has led to many more productions in similar genres. It continues to be recognised as one of the best Austen adaptations of all time.

== Plot ==

When Mr. Dashwood dies, his wife and three daughters — Elinor, Marianne and Margaret — are left with an inheritance of only £500 a year. The bulk of his estate, Norland Park, is left to his son, John, from a previous marriage. John and his greedy, snobbish wife Fanny immediately install themselves in the large house; Fanny invites her brother, Edward Ferrars, to stay with them. She frets about the budding friendship between Edward and Elinor, believing he can do better, and does everything she can to prevent it from developing into a romantic attachment.

Sir John Middleton, a cousin of the widowed Mrs. Dashwood, offers her a small cottage house on his estate, Barton Park in Devonshire. She and her daughters move in and are frequent guests at Barton Park. Marianne meets the older Colonel Brandon, who falls in love with her at first sight. Competing for her affections is the dashing John Willoughby, with whom Marianne falls in love. Later one morning she expects him to propose marriage to her, but he instead leaves hurriedly for London.

Sir John&#x27;s mother-in-law, Mrs. Jennings, invites her daughter and son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Palmer, to visit. They bring with them the impoverished Lucy Steele. Lucy confides in Elinor that she and Edward have been engaged secretly for five years, thus dashing Elinor&#x27;s hopes of a future with him. Mrs. Jennings takes Lucy, Elinor, and Marianne to London, where they meet Willoughby at a ball. He barely acknowledges their acquaintance, and they learn he has become engaged to the extremely wealthy Miss Grey. Marianne is inconsolable. Colonel Brandon then reveals that his ward Beth, illegitimate daughter of his former love Eliza, is pregnant with Willoughby&#x27;s child and was abandoned by him; Willoughby&#x27;s aunt, Lady Allen, had disinherited him upon discovering this. The engagement of Edward and Lucy also comes to light. Edward&#x27;s mother demands that he break it off. When he honorably refuses, his fortune is taken from him and given to his younger brother, Robert.

On their way home to Devonshire, Elinor and Marianne stop for the night at the country estate of the Palmers, who live near Willoughby. Marianne cannot resist going to see Willoughby&#x27;s estate and walks a long way in torrential rain to do so. As a result, she becomes seriously ill and is nursed back to health by Elinor after being rescued by Colonel Brandon. Marianne recovers, and the sisters return home. They learn that Miss Steele has become Mrs. Ferrars and assume that she married Edward. However, Edward arrives to explain that Miss Steele has unexpectedly wed Robert Ferrars and Edward is thus released from his engagement. Edward proposes to Elinor and becomes a vicar, while Marianne marries Colonel Brandon.

== Production ==
=== Conception and adaptation ===
In 1989, Lindsay Doran, a producer of production company Mirage Enterprises, was on a company retreat brainstorming potential film ideas when she suggested the Jane Austen novel &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; to her colleagues. It had been adapted twice, most recently in a 1981 television serial. Doran was a longtime fan of the novel, and had vowed in her youth to adapt it if she ever entered the film industry. She chose to adapt this particular Austen work because there were two female leads. Doran stated that &quot;all of [Austen&#x27;s] books are funny and emotional, but &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is the best movie story because it&#x27;s full of twists and turns. Just when you think you know what&#x27;s going on, everything is different. It&#x27;s got real suspense, but it&#x27;s not a thriller. Irresistible.&quot; She also praised the novel for possessing &quot;wonderful characters ... &quot;three&quot; strong love stories, surprising plot twists, good jokes, relevant themes, and a heart-stopping ending.&quot;

Prior to being hired at Mirage, the producer had spent years looking for a suitable screenwriter – someone who was &quot;equally strong in the areas of satire and romance&quot; and could think in Austen&#x27;s language &quot;almost as naturally as he or she could think in the language of the twentieth century&quot;. Doran read screenplays by English and American writers until she came across a series of comedic skits, often in period settings, that actress Emma Thompson had written. Doran believed the humour and style of writing was &quot;exactly what [she&#x27;d] been searching for&quot;. Thompson and Doran were already working together on Mirage&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;Dead Again&quot;. A week after its completion, the producer selected Thompson to adapt &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, although she knew that Thompson had never written a screenplay. Also a fan of Austen, Thompson first suggested they adapt &quot;Persuasion&quot; or &quot;Emma&quot; before agreeing to Doran&#x27;s proposal. The actress found that &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; contained more action than she had remembered and decided it would translate well to drama.

Thompson spent five years writing and revising the screenplay, both during and between shooting other films. Believing the novel&#x27;s language to be &quot;far more arcane than in [Austen&#x27;s] later books,&quot; Thompson sought to simplify the dialogue while retaining the &quot;elegance and wit of the original.&quot; She observed that in a screenwriting process, a first draft often had &quot;a lot of good stuff in it&quot; but needed to be edited, and second drafts would &quot;almost certainly be rubbish ... because you get into a panic&quot;. Thompson credited Doran that she could &quot;help me, nourish me and mentor me through that process ... I learned about screenwriting at her feet&quot;.

Thompson&#x27;s first draft was more than three hundred handwritten pages, which required her to reduce it to a more manageable length. She found the romances to be the most difficult to &quot;juggle&quot;, and her draft received some criticism for the way it presented Willoughby and Edward. Doran later recalled the work was criticized for not getting underway until Willoughby&#x27;s arrival, with Edward side-lined as backstory. Thompson and Doran quickly realised that &quot;if we didn&#x27;t meet Edward and do the work and take that twenty minutes to set up those people ... then it wasn&#x27;t going to work&quot;. At the same time, Thompson wished to avoid depicting &quot;a couple of women waiting around for men&quot;; gradually her screenplay focused as much on the Dashwood sisters&#x27; relationship with each other as it did with their romantic interests.

With the draft screenplay, Doran pitched the idea to various studios in order to finance the film, but found that many were wary of the beginner Thompson as the screenwriter. She was considered a risk, as her experience was as an actress who had never written a film script. Columbia Pictures executive Amy Pascal supported Thompson&#x27;s work and agreed to sign as the producer and distributor.

As Thompson mentioned on the BBC program &quot;QI&quot; in 2009, at one point in the writing process a computer failure almost lost the entire work. In panic Thompson called fellow actor and close friend Stephen Fry, the host of &quot;QI&quot; and a self-professed &quot;geek&quot;. After seven hours, Fry was able to recover the documents from the device while Thompson had tea with Hugh Laurie who was at Fry&#x27;s house at the time.

==== Lee&#x27;s hire ====
Taiwanese director Ang Lee was hired as a result of his work in the 1993 family comedy film &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot;, which he co-wrote, produced, and directed. He was not familiar with Jane Austen. Doran felt that Lee&#x27;s films, which depicted complex family relationships amidst a social comedy context, were a good fit with Austen&#x27;s storylines. She recalled, &quot;The idea of a foreign director was intellectually appealing even though it was very scary to have someone who didn&#x27;t have English as his first language.&quot; The producer sent Lee a copy of Thompson&#x27;s script, to which he replied that he was &quot;cautiously interested&quot;. Fifteen directors were interviewed, but according to Doran, Lee was one of the few who recognised Austen&#x27;s humour. He also told them he wanted the film to &quot;break people&#x27;s hearts so badly that they&#x27;ll still be recovering from it two months later.&quot;

From the beginning, Doran wanted &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; to appeal to both a core audience of Austen aficionados as well as younger viewers attracted to romantic comedy films. She felt that Lee&#x27;s involvement prevented the film from becoming &quot;just some little English movie&quot; that appealed only to local audiences instead of to the wider world. Lee said,
I thought they were crazy: I was brought up in Taiwan, what do I know about 19th-century England? About halfway through the script it started to make sense why they chose me. In my films I&#x27;ve been trying to mix social satire and family drama. I realised that all along I had been trying to do Jane Austen without knowing it. Jane Austen was my destiny. I just had to overcome the cultural barrier.Because Thompson and Doran had worked on the screenplay for so long, Lee described himself at the time as a &quot;director for hire&quot;, as he was unsure of his role and position. He spent six months in England &quot;learn[ing] how to make this movie, how to do a period film, culturally ... and how to adapt to the major league film industry&quot;.

In January 1995, Thompson presented a draft to Lee, Doran, co-producer Laurie Borg, and others working on the production, and spent the next two months editing the screenplay based upon their feedback. Thompson continued making revisions throughout production of the film, including altering scenes to meet budgetary concerns, adding dialogue changes, and changing certain aspects to better fit the actors. Brandon&#x27;s confession scene, for instance, initially included flashbacks and stylised imagery before Thompson decided it was &quot;emotionally more interesting to let Brandon tell the story himself and find it difficult&quot;.

=== Casting ===

Thompson initially hoped that Doran would cast sisters Natasha and Joely Richardson as Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. Lee and Columbia wanted Thompson herself, now a &quot;big-deal movie star&quot; after her critically successful role in the 1992 film &quot;Howards End&quot;, to play Elinor. The actress replied that at the age of thirty-five, she was too old for the nineteen-year-old character. Lee suggested Elinor&#x27;s age be changed to twenty-seven, which would also have made the difficult reality of spinsterhood easier for modern audiences to understand. Thompson agreed, later stating that she was &quot;desperate to get into a corset and act it and stop thinking about it as a script.&quot;

The formal casting process began in February 1995, though some of the actors met with Thompson the previous year to help her conceptualise the script. Lee eventually cast all but one of them: Hugh Grant (as Edward Ferrars), Robert Hardy (as Sir John Middleton), Harriet Walter (as Fanny Ferrars Dashwood), Imelda Staunton (as Charlotte Jennings Palmer), and Hugh Laurie (as Mr. Palmer). Amanda Root had also worked with Thompson on the screenplay, but had already committed to star in the 1995 film &quot;Persuasion&quot;. Commenting on the casting of Laurie, whom she had known for years, Thompson has said, &quot;There is no one [else] on the planet who could capture Mr. Palmer&#x27;s disenchantment and redemption so perfectly, and make it funny.&quot;

Thompson wrote the part of Edward Ferrars with Grant in mind, and he agreed to receive a lower salary in line with the film&#x27;s budget. Grant called her screenplay &quot;genius&quot;, explaining &quot;I&#x27;ve always been a philistine about Jane Austen herself, and I think Emma&#x27;s script is miles better than the book and much more amusing.&quot; Grant&#x27;s casting was criticised by the Jane Austen Society of North America (JASNA), whose representatives said that he was too handsome for the part. Actress Kate Winslet initially intended to audition for the role of Marianne but Lee disliked her work in the 1994 drama film &quot;Heavenly Creatures;&quot; she auditioned for the lesser part of Lucy Steele. Winslet pretended she had heard that the audition was still for Marianne, and won the part based on a single reading. Thompson later said that Winslet, only nineteen years old, approached the part &quot;energised and open, realistic, intelligent, and tremendous fun.&quot; The role helped Winslet become recognised as a significant actress.

Also appearing in the film was Alan Rickman, who portrayed Colonel Brandon. Thompson was pleased that Rickman could express the &quot;extraordinary sweetness [of] his nature,&quot; as he had played &quot;Machiavellian types so effectively&quot; in other films. Greg Wise was cast as Marianne&#x27;s other romantic interest, John Willoughby, his most noted role thus far. Twelve-year-old Emilie François, appearing as Margaret Dashwood, was one of the last people cast in the production; she had no professional acting experience. Thompson praised the young actress in her production diaries, &quot;Emilie has a natural quick intelligence that informs every movement – she creates spontaneity in all of us just by being there.&quot; Other cast members included Gemma Jones as Mrs. Dashwood, James Fleet as John Dashwood, Elizabeth Spriggs as Mrs. Jennings, Imogen Stubbs as Lucy Steele, Richard Lumsden as Robert Ferrars, Tom Wilkinson as Mr. Dashwood, and Lone Vidahl as Miss Grey.

=== Costume design ===
According to Austen scholar Linda Troost, the costumes used in &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; helped emphasise the class and status of the various characters, particularly among the Dashwoods. They were created by Jenny Beavan and John Bright, a team of designers best known for Merchant Ivory films who began working together in 1984. The two attempted to create accurate period dress, and featured the &quot;fuller, classical look and colours of the late 18th century.&quot; They found inspiration in the works of the English artists Thomas Rowlandson, John Hopper, and George Romney, and also reviewed fashion plates stored in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The main costumes and hats were manufactured at Cosprop, a London-based costumer company.

To achieve the tightly wound curls fashionably inspired by Greek art, some of the actresses wore wigs while others employed heated hair twists and slept in pin curls. Fanny, the snobbiest of the characters, possesses the tightest of curls but has less of a Greek silhouette, a reflection of her wealth and silliness. Beavan stated that Fanny and Mrs. Jennings &quot;couldn&#x27;t quite give up the frills,&quot; and instead draped themselves in lace, fur, feathers, jewellery, and rich fabrics. Conversely, sensible Elinor opts for simpler accessories, such as a long gold chain and a straw hat. Fanny&#x27;s shallow personality is also reflected in &quot;flashy, colourful&quot; dresses, while Edward&#x27;s buttoned-up appearance represents his &quot;repressed&quot; personality, with little visible skin. Each of the 100 extras used in the London ballroom scene, depicting &quot;soldiers and lawyers to fops and dowagers,&quot; don visually distinct costumes.

For Brandon&#x27;s costumes, Beavan and Bright consulted with Thompson and Lee and decided to have him project an image of &quot;experienced and dependable masculinity.&quot; Brandon is first seen in black, but later he wears sporting gear in the form of corduroy jackets and shirtsleeves. His rescue of Marianne has him transforming into the &quot;romantic Byronic hero&quot;, sporting an unbuttoned shirt and loose cravat. In conjunction with his tragic backstory, Brandon&#x27;s &quot;flattering&quot; costumes help his appeal to the audience. Beavan and Bright&#x27;s work on the film earned them a nomination for Best Costume Design at the 68th Academy Awards.
=== Filming ===
The film was budgeted at $16 million, the largest Ang Lee had yet received as well as the largest awarded to an Austen film that decade. In the wake of the success of Columbia&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;Little Women&quot;, the American studio authorised Lee&#x27;s &quot;relatively high budget&quot; out of an expectation that it would be another cross-over hit and appeal to multiple audiences, thus yielding high box office returns. Nevertheless, Doran considered it a &quot;low budget film&quot;, and many of the ideas Thompson and Lee came up with – such as an early dramatic scene depicting Mr. Dashwood&#x27;s bloody fall from a horse – were deemed unfilmable from a cost perspective.

According to Thompson, Lee &quot;arrived on set with the whole movie in his head&quot;. Rather than focus on period details, he wanted the film to concentrate on telling a good story. He showed the cast a selection of films adapted from classic novels, including &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; and &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot;, which he believed to be &quot;great movies; everybody worships the art work, [but] it&#x27;s not what we want to do&quot;. Lee criticised the latter film for lacking energy, in contrast to the &quot;passionate tale&quot; of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;.

The cast and crew experienced &quot;slight culture shock&quot; with Lee on a number of occasions. He expected the assistant directors to be the &quot;tough ones&quot; and keep production on schedule, while they expected the same of him; this led to a slower schedule in the early stages of production. Additionally, according to Thompson, the director became &quot;deeply hurt and confused&quot; when she and Grant made suggestions for certain scenes, which was something that was not done in his native country. Lee thought his authority was being undermined and lost sleep, though this was gradually resolved as he became used to their methods. The cast &quot;grew to trust his instincts so completely&quot;, making fewer and fewer suggestions. Co-producer James Schamus stated that Lee also adapted by becoming more verbal and willing to express his opinion.

Lee became known for his &quot;frightening&quot; tendency not to &quot;mince words&quot;. He often had the cast do numerous takes for a scene to get the perfect shot, and was not afraid to call something &quot;boring&quot; if he disliked it. Thompson later recalled that Lee would &quot;always come up to you and say something unexpectedly crushing&quot;, such as asking her not to &quot;look so old&quot;. She also commented, however, that &quot;he doesn&#x27;t indulge us but is always kind when we fail&quot;. Due to Thompson&#x27;s extensive acting experience, Lee encouraged her to practice tai chi to &quot;help her relax [and] make her do things simpler&quot;. Other actors soon joined them in meditating – according to Doran, it &quot;was pretty interesting. There were all these pillows on the floor and these pale-looking actors were saying, &#x27;What have we got ourselves into?&#x27; [Lee] was more focused on body language than any director I&#x27;ve ever seen or heard of.&quot; He suggested Winslet read books of poetry and report back to him to best understand her character. He also had Thompson and Winslet live together to develop their characters&#x27; sisterly bond. Many of the cast took lessons in etiquette and riding side-saddle.

Lee found that in contrast to Chinese cinema, he had to dissuade many of the actors from using a &quot;very stagy, very English tradition. Instead of just being observed like a human being and getting sympathy, they feel they have to do things, they have to carry the movie.&quot; Grant in particular often had to be restrained from giving an &quot;over-the-top&quot; performance; Lee later recalled that the actor is &quot;a show stealer. You can&#x27;t stop that. I let him do, I have to say, less &#x27;star&#x27; stuff, the Hugh Grant thing ... and not [let] the movie serve him, which is probably what he&#x27;s used to now.&quot; For the scene in which Elinor learns Edward is unmarried, Thompson found inspiration from her reaction to her father&#x27;s death. Grant was unaware that Thompson would cry through most of his speech, and the actress attempted to reassure him, &quot;&#x27;There&#x27;s no other way, and I promise you it&#x27;ll work, and it will be funny as well as being touching.&#x27; And he said, &#x27;Oh, all right,&#x27; and he was very good about it.&quot; Lee had one demand for the scene, that Thompson avoid the temptation to turn her head towards the camera.

==== Locations ====
Production of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; was scheduled for fifty-eight days, though this was eventually extended to sixty-five. Filming commenced in mid-April 1995 at a number of locations in Devon, beginning with Saltram House (standing in for Norland Park), where Winslet and Jones shot the first scene of the production: when their characters read about Barton Cottage. As Saltram was a National Trust property, Schamus had to sign a contract before production began, and staff with the organisation remained on set to carefully monitor the filming. Production later returned to shoot several more scenes, finishing there on 29 April. The second location of filming, Flete House, stood in for part of Mrs. Jennings&#x27; London estate, where Edward first sees Elinor with Lucy. Representing Barton Cottage was a Flete Estate stone cottage called Efford House in Holbeton, which Thompson called &quot;one of the most beautiful spots we&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot;

Early May saw production at the &quot;exquisite&quot; St Mary&#x27;s Church in Berry Pomeroy for the final wedding scene. From the tenth to the twelfth of May, Marianne&#x27;s first rescue sequence, depicting her encounter with Willoughby, was shot. Logistics were difficult, as the scene was set upon a hill during a rainy day. Lee shot around fifty takes, with the actors becoming soaked under rain machines; this led to Winslet eventually collapsing from hypothermia. Further problems occurred midway through filming, when Winslet contracted phlebitis in her leg, developed a limp, and sprained her wrist after falling down a staircase.

From May to July, production took place at a number of other National Trust estates and stately homes across England. Trafalgar House and Wilton House in Wiltshire stood in for the grounds of Barton Park and the London Ballroom respectively. Mompesson House, an eighteenth-century townhouse located in Salisbury, represented Mrs. Jennings&#x27; sumptuous townhouse. Sixteenth-century Montacute House in Somerset was the setting for the Palmer estate of Cleveland House. Further scenes were shot at Compton Castle in Devon (Mr Willoughby&#x27;s estate) and at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.

=== Music ===

Composer Patrick Doyle, who had previously worked with his friend Emma Thompson in the films &quot;Henry V&quot;, &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, and &quot;Dead Again&quot;, was hired to produce the music for &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;. Asked by the director to select existing music or compose new &quot;gentle&quot; melodies, Doyle wrote a score that reflected the film&#x27;s events. He explained, &quot;You had this middle-class English motif, and with the music you would have occasional outbursts of emotion.&quot; Doyle explains that the score &quot;becomes a little more grown-up&quot; as the story progresses to one of &quot;maturity and an emotional catharsis.&quot; The score contains romantic elements and has been described by National Public Radio as a &quot;restricted compass ... of emotion&quot; with &quot;instruments [that] blend together in a gentle sort of way&quot;. They also noted that as a reflection of the story, the score is a &quot;little wistful ... and sentimental.&quot;

Two songs are sung by Marianne in the film, with lyrics adapted from seventeenth-century poems. Lee believed that the two songs conveyed the &quot;vision of duality&quot; visible both in the novel and script. In his opinion, the second song expressed Marianne&#x27;s &quot;mature acceptance,&quot; intertwined with a &quot;sense of melancholy&quot;. The melody of &quot;Weep You No More Sad Fountains&quot;, Marianne&#x27;s first song, appears in the opening credits, while her second song&#x27;s melody features again during the ending credits, this time sung by dramatic soprano Jane Eaglen. The songs were written by Doyle before filming began. The composer received his first Academy Award nomination for his score.

=== Editing ===
Thompson and Doran discussed how much of the love stories to depict, as the male characters spend much of the novel away from the Dashwood sisters. The screenwriter had to carefully balance the amount of screentime she gave to the male leads, noting in her film production diary that such a decision would &quot;very much lie in the editing.&quot; Thompson wrote &quot;hundreds of different versions&quot; of romantic storylines. She considered having Edward re-appear midway through the film before deciding that it would not work as &quot;there was nothing for him to do.&quot; Thompson also opted to exclude the duel scene between Brandon and Willoughby, which is described in the novel, because it &quot;only seemed to subtract from the mystery.&quot; She and Doran agonised about when and how to reveal Brandon&#x27;s backstory, as they wanted to prevent viewers from becoming bored. Thompson described the process of reminding audiences of Edward and Brandon as &quot;keeping plates spinning&quot;.

A scene was shot of Brandon finding his ward in a poverty-stricken area in London, but this was excluded from the film. Thompson&#x27;s script included a scene of Elinor and Edward kissing, as the studio &quot;couldn&#x27;t stand the idea of these two people who we&#x27;ve been watching all the way through not kissing.&quot; It was one of the first scenes cut during editing: the original version was over three hours, Lee was less interested in the story&#x27;s romance, and Thompson found a kissing scene to be inappropriate. The scene was included in marketing materials and the film trailer. Thompson and Doran also cut out a scene depicting Willoughby as remorseful when Marianne is sick. Doran said that despite it &quot;being one of the great scenes in book history,&quot; they could not get it to fit into the film.

Tim Squyres edited the film, his fourth collaboration with Ang Lee. He reflected in 2013 about the editing process:
It was the first film that I had done with Ang that was all in English, and it&#x27;s Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman, and Hugh Grant — these great, great actors. When you get footage like that, you realise that your job is really not technical. It was my job to look at something that Emma Thompson had done and say, &quot;Eh, that&#x27;s not good, I&#x27;ll use this other one instead.&quot; And not only was I allowed to pass judgment on these tremendous actors, I was required to.

== Themes and analysis ==
=== Changes from source material ===
Scholar Louise Flavin has noted that Thompson&#x27;s screenplay contains significant alterations to the characters of Elinor and Marianne Dashwood: in the novel, the former embodies &quot;sense&quot;, i.e. &quot;sensible&quot; in our terms, and the latter, &quot;sensibility&quot;, i.e. &quot;sensitivity&quot; in our terms. Audience members are meant to view self-restrained Elinor as the person in need of reform, rather than her impassioned sister. To heighten the contrast between them, Marianne and Willoughby&#x27;s relationship includes an &quot;erotic&quot; invented scene in which the latter requests a lock of her hair – a direct contrast to Elinor&#x27;s &quot;reserved relationship&quot; with Edward. Lee also distinguishes them through imagery – Marianne is often seen with musical instruments, near open windows, and outside, while Elinor is pictured in door frames. Another character altered for modern viewers is Margaret Dashwood, who conveys &quot;the frustrations that a girl of our times might feel at the limitations facing her as a woman in the early nineteenth century.&quot; Thompson uses Margaret for exposition in order to detail contemporary attitudes and customs. For instance, Elinor explains to a curious Margaret – and by extension, the audience – why their half-brother inherits the Dashwood estate. Margaret&#x27;s altered storyline, giving her an interest in fencing and geography, also allows audience members to see the &quot;feminine&quot; side of Edward and Brandon, as they become father or brother figures to her. The film omits the characters of Lady Middleton and her children, as well as that of Ann Steele, Lucy&#x27;s sister.

When adapting the characters for film, Thompson found that in the novel, &quot;Edward and Brandon are quite shadowy and absent for long periods,&quot; and that &quot;making the male characters effective was one of the biggest problems. Willoughby is really the only male who springs out in three dimensions.&quot; Several major male characters in &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; were consequently altered significantly from the novel in an effort to appeal to contemporary audiences. Grant&#x27;s Edward and Rickman&#x27;s Brandon are &quot;ideal&quot; modern males who display an obvious love of children as well as &quot;pleasing manners&quot;, especially when contrasted with Palmer. Thompson&#x27;s script both expanded and omitted scenes from Edward&#x27;s storyline, including the deletion of an early scene in which Elinor assumes that a lock of hair found in Edward&#x27;s possession is hers, when it belongs to Lucy. He was made more fully realised and honourable than in the novel to increase his appeal to viewers. To gradually show viewers why Brandon is worthy of Marianne&#x27;s love, Thompson&#x27;s screenplay has his storyline mirroring Willoughby&#x27;s; they are similar in appearance, share a love of music and poetry, and rescue Marianne in the rain while on horseback.

=== Class ===
Thompson viewed the novel as a story of &quot;love and money,&quot; noting that some people needed one more than the other. During the writing process, executive producer Sydney Pollack stressed that the film be understandable to modern audiences, and that it be made clear why the Dashwood sisters could not just obtain a job. &quot;I&#x27;m from Indiana; if I get it, everyone gets it,&quot; he said. Thompson believed that Austen was just as comprehensible in a different century, &quot;You don&#x27;t think people are still concerned with marriage, money, romance, finding a partner?&quot; She was keen to emphasise the realism of the Dashwoods&#x27; predicament in her screenplay, and inserted scenes to make the differences in wealth more apparent to modern audiences. Thompson made the Dashwood family richer than in the book and added elements to help contrast their early wealth with their later financial predicament; for instance, because it might have been confusing to viewers that one could be poor and still have servants, Elinor is made to address a large group of servants at Norland Park early in the film for viewers to remember when they see their few staff at Barton Cottage. Lee also sought to emphasise social class and the limitations it placed on the protagonists. Lee conveys this in part when Willoughby publicly rejects Marianne; he returns to a more lavishly furnished room, a symbol of the wealth she has lost. &quot;Family dramas,&quot; he stated, &quot;are all about conflict, about family obligations versus free will.&quot;

The film&#x27;s theme of class has attracted much scholarly attention. Carole Dole noted that class constitutes an important element in Austen&#x27;s stories and is &quot;impossible&quot; to avoid when adapting her novels. According to Dole, Lee&#x27;s film contains an &quot;ambiguous treatment of class values&quot; that stresses social differences but &quot;underplays the consequences of the class distinctions so important in the novel&quot;; for instance, Edward&#x27;s story ends upon his proposal to Elinor, with no attention paid to how they will live on his small annual income from the vicarage. Louise Flavin believed that Lee used the houses to represent their occupants&#x27; class and character: the Dashwood sisters&#x27; decline in eligibility is represented through the contrast between the spacious rooms of Norland Park and those of the isolated, cramped Barton Cottage. James Thompson criticised what he described as the anaesthetised &quot;mélange of disconnected picture postcard-gift-calendar-perfect scenes,&quot; in which little connection is made between &quot;individual subjects and the land that supports them.&quot; Andrew Higson argued that while &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; includes commentary on sex and gender, it fails to pursue issues of class. Thompson&#x27;s script, he wrote, displays a &quot;sense of impoverishment [but is] confined to the still privileged lifestyle of the disinherited Dashwoods. The broader class system is pretty much taken for granted.&quot; The ending visual image of flying gold coins, depicted during Marianne&#x27;s wedding, has also drawn attention; Marsha McCreadie noted that it serves as a &quot;visual wrap-up and emblem of the merger between money and marriage.&quot;

=== Gender ===
Gender has been seen as another major theme of the film, often intersecting with class. Penny Gay observed that Elinor&#x27;s early dialogue with Edward about &quot;feel[ing] idle and useless ... [with] no hope whatsoever of any occupation&quot; reflected Thompson&#x27;s background as a &quot;middle class, Cambridge-educated feminist.&quot; Conversely, Dole wrote that Thompson&#x27;s version of Elinor &quot;has a surprising anti-feminist element to it,&quot; as she appears more dependent on men than the original character; the film presents her as repressed, resulting in her emotional breakdown with Edward. Linda Troost opined that Lee&#x27;s production prominently features &quot;radical feminist and economic issues&quot; while &quot;paradoxically endorsing the conservative concept of marriage as a woman&#x27;s goal in life.&quot; Despite this &quot;mixed political agenda,&quot; Troost believed that the film&#x27;s faithfulness to the traditional heritage film genre is evident through its use of locations, costumes, and attention to details, all of which also emphasize class and status. Gay and Julianne Pidduck stated that gender differences are expressed by showing the female characters indoors, while their male counterparts are depicted outside confidently moving throughout the countryside. Nora Stovel observed that Thompson &quot;emphasises Austen&#x27;s feminist satire on Regency gender economics,&quot; drawing attention not only to the financial plight of the Dashwoods but also to eighteenth-century women in general.

== Marketing and release ==
In the United States, Sony and Columbia Pictures released &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; on a slow schedule compared to mainstream films, first premiering it on 13 December 1995. Believing that a limited release would both position the film as an &quot;exclusive quality picture&quot; and increase its chances of winning Academy Awards, Columbia dictated that its first weekend involve only seventy cinemas in the US; it opened in eleventh place in terms of box office takings and earned $721,341. To benefit from the publicity surrounding potential Academy Award candidates and increase its chance of earning nominations, the film was released within &quot;Oscar season&quot;. The number of theatres showing &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; was slowly expanded, with particular surges when its seven Oscar nominations were announced and at the time of the ceremony in late March, until it was present in over one thousand cinemas across the US. By the end of its American release, &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; had been watched by more than eight million people, garnering an &quot;impressive&quot; total domestic gross of $43,182,776.

On the basis of Austen&#x27;s reputation as a serious author, the producers were able to rely on high-brow publications to help market their film. Near the time of its US release, large spreads in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Film Comment&quot;, and other media outlets featured columns on Lee&#x27;s production. In late December, &quot;Time&quot; magazine declared it and &quot;Persuasion&quot; to be the best films of 1995. Andrew Higson referred to all this media exposure as a &quot;marketing coup&quot; because it meant the film &quot;was reaching one of its target audiences.&quot; Meanwhile, most promotional images featured the film as a &quot;sort of chick flick in period garb.&quot; New Market Press published Thompson&#x27;s screenplay and film diary; in its first printing, the hard cover edition sold 28,500 copies in the US. British publisher Bloomsbury released a paperback edition of the novel containing film pictures, same title design, and the cast&#x27;s names on the cover, while Signet Publishing in the US printed 250,000 copies instead of the typical 10,000 a year; actress Julie Christie read the novel in an audiobook released by Penguin Audiobooks. &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; increased dramatically in terms of its book sales, ultimately hitting tenth place on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for paperbacks in February 1996.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; was released on 23 February 1996 in order to &quot;take advantage of the hype from &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;&quot;, another popular Austen adaptation recently broadcast. Columbia Tristar&#x27;s head of UK marketing noted that &quot;if there was any territory this film was going to work, it was in the UK.&quot; After receiving positive responses at previews, marketing strategies focused on selling it as both a costume drama and as a film attractive to mainstream audiences. Attention was also paid to marketing &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; internationally. Because the entire production cycle had consistently emphasised it as being &quot;bigger&quot; than a normal British period drama literary film, distributors avoided labelling it as &quot;just another English period film.&quot; Instead, marketing materials featured quotations from populist newspapers such as the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, which compared the film to &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; (1994). It opened in the UK on 102 screens and grossed £629,152 in its opening weekend, placing fourth at the box office. It went on to gross £13,605,627 in the UK, the seventh highest-grossing film for the year. It was watched by more than ten million viewers in Europe. Worldwide, the film ultimately grossed $134,582,776, a sum that reflected its commercial success. It had the largest box office gross out of the Austen adaptations of the 1990s.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
&quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; received widespread critical acclaim, and was included on more than a hundred top-ten of the year lists. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 97% approval rating based on 64 reviews, with an average rating of 8.00/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is an uncommonly deft, very funny Jane Austen adaptation, marked by Emma Thompson&#x27;s finely tuned performance.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 84 out of 100 based on 21 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A&quot; on scale of A to F.

Writing for &quot;Variety&quot; magazine, Todd McCarthy observed that the film&#x27;s success was assisted by its &quot;highly skilled cast of actors&quot;, as well as its choice of Lee as director. McCarthy clarified, &quot;Although [Lee&#x27;s] previously revealed talents for dramatizing conflicting social and generational traditions will no doubt be noted, Lee&#x27;s achievement here with such foreign material is simply well beyond what anyone could have expected and may well be posited as the cinematic equivalent of Kazuo Ishiguro writing &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;.&quot;

Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; lauded the film for containing a sense of urgency &quot;that keeps the pedestrian problems of an unremarkable 18th century family immediate and personal.&quot; LaSalle concluded that the adaptation has a &quot;right balance of irony and warmth. The result is a film of great understanding and emotional clarity, filmed with an elegance that never calls attention to itself.&quot; Film critic John Simon praised most of the film, particularly focusing on Thompson&#x27;s performance, though he criticised Grant for being &quot;much too adorably bumbling ... he urgently needs to chasten his onscreen persona, and stop hunching his shoulders like a dromedary.&quot; Other major critics such as LaSalle, Roger Ebert, James Berardinelli and Janet Maslin praised Grant&#x27;s performance. Maslin wrote, Grant &quot;rises touchingly to the film&#x27;s most straightforward and meaningful encounters.&quot;

Jay Carr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; thought that Lee &quot;nail[ed] Austen&#x27;s acute social observation and tangy satire,&quot; and viewed Thompson and Winslet&#x27;s age discrepancy as a positive element that helped feed the dichotomy of sense and sensibility. The &quot;Radio Times&quot;″ David Parkinson was equally appreciative of Lee&#x27;s direction, writing that he &quot;avoid[s] the chocolate-box visuals that cheapen so many British costume dramas&quot; and &quot;brings a refreshing period realism to the tale of two sisters that allows Emma Thompson&#x27;s respectful Oscar-winning script to flourish.&quot;

Although as others have pointed out the adaptation is not faithful to Austen&#x27;s novel: &quot;Thompson plays fast and loose with Austen, cutting huge chunks out of the novel, adding whole scenes; a mere six or seven lines from the book actually make it into the film&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
Out of the 1990s Austen adaptations, &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; received the most recognition from Hollywood. It garnered seven nominations at the 68th Academy Awards ceremony, where Thompson received the Award for Best Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, making her the only person to have won an Oscar for both her writing and acting (Thompson won the Best Actress award for &quot;Howards End&quot;, in 1993). The film also was the recipient of twelve nominations at the 49th British Academy Film Awards, including Best Film, Best Actress in a Leading Role (for Thompson), and Best Actress in a Supporting Role (for Winslet). In addition, the film won the Golden Bear at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival, making Lee the first director to win this twice.

Despite the recognition given to the film, Lee was not nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director (though he was nominated for the Golden Globe, the BAFTA and the Directors Guild Award). The scholar Shu-mei Shih and the journalist Clarence Page have attributed this snub to Hollywood&#x27;s racism against Lee, and Chinese cinema in general. Lee sought to avoid turning his omission into a scandal and specifically asked the Taiwan state media not to make it a &quot;national issue&quot;, explaining that he endured more pressure when forced to act as his country&#x27;s representative.

== Legacy and influence ==

Following the theatrical release of &quot;Persuasion&quot; by a few months, &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; was one of the first English-language period adaptations of an Austen novel to be released in cinemas in over fifty years, the previous being the 1940 film &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. The year 1995 saw a resurgence of popularity for Austen&#x27;s works, as &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; and the serial &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; both rocketed to critical and financial success. The two adaptations helped draw more attention to the previously little-known 1995 television film &quot;Persuasion&quot;, and led to additional Austen adaptations in the following years. In 1995 and 1996, six Austen adaptations were released onto film or television. The filming of these productions led to a surge in popularity of many of the landmarks and locations depicted; according to the scholar Sue Parrill, they became &quot;instant meccas for viewers.&quot;

When &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; was released in cinemas in the US, &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; published a six-page article entitled &quot;Jane Austen&#x27;s England&quot;, which focused on the landscape and sites shown in the film. A press book released by the studio, as well as Thompson&#x27;s published screenplay and diaries, listed all the filming locations and helped to boost tourism. Saltram House for instance was carefully promoted during the film&#x27;s release, and saw a 57 percent increase in attendance. In 1996, JASNA&#x27;s membership increased by fifty percent. The popularity of both &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; and &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; led to the BBC and ITV releasing their Austen adaptations from the 1970s and 1980s onto DVD.

As the mid-1990s included adaptations of four Austen novels, there were few of her works to adapt. Andrew Higson argues that this resulted in a &quot;variety of successors&quot; in the genres of romantic comedy and costume drama, as well as with films featuring strong female characters. Cited examples include &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; (1997), &quot;Mrs. Brown&quot; (1997), &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; (1998), and &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; (2001). In 2008, Andrew Davies, the screenwriter of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, adapted &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; for television. As a reaction to what he said was Lee&#x27;s overly &quot;sentimental&quot; film, this production features events found in the novel but excluded from Thompson&#x27;s screenplay, such as Willoughby&#x27;s seduction of Eliza and his duel with Brandon. It also features actors closer to the ages in the source material.

&quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; has maintained its popularity into the twenty-first century. In 2004, Louise Flavin referred to the 1995 film as &quot;the most popular of the Austen film adaptations,&quot; and in 2008, &quot;The Independent&quot; ranked it as the third-best Austen adaptation of all time, opining that Lee &quot;offered an acute outsider&#x27;s insight into Austen in this compelling 1995 interpretation of the book [and] Emma Thompson delivered a charming turn as the older, wiser, Dashwood sister, Elinor.&quot; Journalist Zoe Williams credits Thompson as the person most responsible for Austen&#x27;s popularity, explaining in 2007 that &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; &quot;is the definitive Austen film and that&#x27;s largely down to her.&quot; In 2011, &quot;The Guardian&quot; film critic Paul Laity named it his favourite film of all time, partly because of its &quot;exceptional screenplay, crisply and skilfully done.&quot;. Devoney Looser reflected on the film in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; on the 20th anniversary of its release, arguing that the film served as &quot;a turning point&quot; for &quot;pro-feminist masculinity&quot; in Austen adaptations.

<doc id="142429" wikidata="Q294109" url="?curid=142429" title="Michael Psellos">
<text>Michael Psellos or Psellus (, ) was a Byzantine Greek monk, savant, writer, philosopher, imperial courtier, historian and music theorist. He was born in 1017 or 1018, and is believed to have died in 1078, although it has also been maintained that he remained alive until 1096. He served as a high ranking courtier and advisor to several Byzantine emperors and was instrumental in the re-positioning of power of those emperors. Psellos has made lasting contributions to Byzantine culture by advocating for the revival of Byzantine classical studies, which would later influence the Italian Renaissance, as well as by interpreting Homeric literature and Platonic philosophy as precursors and integral components of Christian doctrine. His texts combined theology, philosophy, and psychology. Among his most famous works are his &quot;Commentary on Plato’s Teachings on the Origin of the Soul&quot;, and the &quot;Chronographia&quot;, a series of biographies from emperor Basil II to Nikephoros III, which serves as a valuable source on the history of the 11th century Byzantine Empire.

==Biography and political career==
The main sources of information about Psellos&#x27; life are his works, which contain extensive autobiographical passages. Michael Psellos was probably born in Constantinople. His family hailed from Nicomedia and, according to his own testimony, counted members of the consular and patrician elite among its ancestors. His baptismal name was Constantine; Michael was the monastic name he chose when he entered a monastery later in life. &quot;Psellos&quot; (&#x27;the stammerer&#x27;) probably was a personal by-name referring to a speech defect.

Michael Psellos was educated in Constantinople. At around the age of ten, he was sent to work outside the capital as a secretary of a provincial judge, to help his family raise the dowry for his sister. When his sister died, he gave up that position and returned to Constantinople to resume his studies. While studying under John Mauropus, he met the later Patriarchs Constantine Leichoudes and John Xiphilinos, and the later emperor Constantine X Doukas. For some time, he worked in the provinces again, now a judge. Some time before 1042 he returned again to Constantinople, where he got a junior position at court as a secretary () in the imperial chancellery and began a rapid ascent at court. He became an influential political advisor to emperor Constantine IX Monomachos (reigned 1042–1055) and became the leading professor at the University of Constantinople, bearing the honorary title of &quot;Chief of the Philosophers&quot; ( &quot;hypatos tōn philosophōn&quot;). Despite his eminence and prowess in learning, his knowledge of Latin was cloudy enough for him to confuse Cicero with Caesar. This is cited as a prime example of how the Eastern Roman Empire had lost nearly all of its connections to its Roman roots by the High Middle Ages. 

Towards the end of Monomachos&#x27; reign, Psellos found himself under political pressure for some reason and decided to leave court, entering the Olympus monastery on Mount Olympus in Bithynia in 1054. After Monomachos&#x27; death he was recalled to court by his successor, Empress Theodora (reigned 1055–1056). Throughout the following years, he remained active in politics, serving as a high-ranking political advisor to successive emperors. He played a decisive political role in the transition of power from Michael VI to Isaac I Komnenos in 1057; then from Isaac Komnenos to Constantine X Doukas (1059), then again from Romanos IV Diogenes to Michael VII Doukas (1071). As Psellos had served as Michael&#x27;s teacher during the reign of Michael&#x27;s father Constantine, and as he had played an important role in helping Michael gain power against his adversary and stepfather Romanos, Psellos probably entertained hopes of an even more influential position as a teacher and advisor under him. Michael seems to have been less inclined towards protecting Psellos and after the mid-1070s there is no more information about any role played by Psellos at court. As his autobiographic accounts cease at this point, there is little reliable information about his later years. Some scholars believe that Psellos had to retreat into a monastery again at some time during the 1070s. Following a remark by Psellos&#x27; fellow historian Joannes Zonaras, it is believed by most scholars that Psellos died soon after the fall of Michael VII in 1078, although some scholars have also proposed later dates. What is known is that Theophylaktos of Bulgaria wrote a letter to Psellos&#x27;s brother comforting him on the death of his brother saying that, &quot;Your brother has not died, but has departed to God released of both a painful life and disease&quot;.

==&quot;Chronographia&quot;== 
The &quot;Chronographia&quot; (), a history of the Byzantine emperors during the 100 years leading up to Psellos&#x27; own time, is probably Psellos&#x27; best known and most accessible work. It covers the reigns of 14 emperors and empresses, beginning with the almost 50-year-long reign of Basil II, the &quot;Bulgar-Slayer&quot; (976–1025), and ending some time during the reign of Michael VII Doukas (1071–1078). It is structured mainly as a series of biographies. Unlike most other historiographical works of the period, it emphasizes the description of characters rather than details of political and military events. It also includes extensive autobiographical elements about Psellos&#x27; political and intellectual development, and it gives far greater weight to those periods when Psellos was active in politics, especially the reign of Constantine IX, giving the whole work almost the character of a political memoir. It is believed to have been written in two parts. The first covers the emperors up to Isaac I Komnenos. The second, which has a much more strongly apologetic tone, is in large parts an encomium on Psellus&#x27; protectors, the emperors of the Doukas dynasty.

Byzantinist historian Judith Herrin said: &quot;This book by Michael Psellus is so fascinating that if you only read one book about Byzantium, by a Byzantine, that would be the one I’d choose&quot;. 
==Other works==
Psellos left many other writings:

#&quot;Historia syntomos&quot;, a shorter, didactic historical text in the form of a world chronicle.
#A large number of scientific, philosophical and religious treatises. He wrote or compiled an important work on philosophy, the &quot;De omnifaria doctrina.&quot; Other works deal with topics such as astronomy, medicine, music, jurisprudence, physics, and laography.
#&quot;De operatione dæmonum (On the Operation of Demons)&quot;, which offered a demonic taxonomy as part of an anti-Manichaean dialogue. He wrote a treatise on alchemy, theurgy (summoning spirits) despite the study being forbidden by the church.
# Various didactic poems on topics such as grammar and rhetorics.
# Three &quot;Epitaphioi&quot; or funeral orations over the patriarchs Michael Keroularios, Constantine III Leichoudes and John Xiphilinos.
#A funeral oration for his mother, including a large amount of autobiographic information.
#Several panegyrics, persuasive speeches (including works against the Bogomils and Euchites) and speeches addressed to his patron emperors at court.
#Several hundred personal letters.
# Rhetorical exercises and essays on set themes.
# Occasional, satirical, and epigrammatic verse.

==Personality==
Psellos was universally educated and had a reputation for being one of the most learned men of his time. He prided himself on having single-handedly reintroduced to Byzantine scholarship a serious study of ancient philosophy, especially of Plato. His predilection for Plato and other pagan (often Neoplatonic) philosophers led to doubts about the orthodoxy of his faith among some of his contemporaries, and at one point he was forced to make a public profession of faith in his defense. He also prided himself on being a master of rhetoric, combining the wisdom of the philosopher and the persuasiveness of the rhetorician. This made him the model of a political leader and advisor. Among modern commentators, Psellos&#x27; penchant for long autobiographical digressions in his works has earned him accusations of vanity and ambition. At the same time, his political career and the contents of his &quot;Chronographia&quot; have led commentators to characterize him as obsequious and opportunistic, because of his ostensibly uncritical stance towards some of the emperors and because of the many shifts in his political loyalty over the course of his life . However, other commentators argue that there is a powerful ironic undercurrent running through his work, especially the &quot;Chronographia&quot;, transmitting highly critical and subversive messages about the emperors portrayed, or even about Byzantine Christian beliefs and morality at large.

As mentioned above, serious questions were raised during Psellos&#x27; lifetime concerning his religious beliefs. For example, according to Byzantinist Anthony Kaldellis, &quot;In 1054 he [Psellos] was accused by his erstwhile friend, the future Patriarch John Xiphilinos, of forsaking Christ to follow Plato.&quot; Even stronger doubts arose concerning Psellos&#x27; student, John Italos, who succeeded Psellos as Chief of the Philosophers. Italos was publicly accused of teaching such &quot;Hellenizing&quot; ideas as metempsychosis and the eternity of the world. Italos faced such accusations twice, and both times he confessed and recanted.

==Pseudo-Psellos==
It was once thought that there was another Byzantine writer of the same name, Michael Psellos the Elder (now also called Pseudo-Psellos), who lived on the island of Andros in the 9th century, and who was a pupil of Photius and teacher of emperor Leo VI the Wise. Michael Psellos was also called &quot;the younger&quot; by some authors. This belief was based on an entry in a medieval chronicle, the , which mentions the name in that context. It is now believed that the inclusion of the name Psellos in this chronicle was the mistake of an ignorant copyist at a later time, and that no &quot;Michael Psellos the elder&quot; existed. The term &quot;Pseudo-Psellos&quot; is also used in modern scholarship to describe the authorship of several later works that are believed to have been falsely ascribed to Psellos in Byzantine times.

==References in literature==
In the gloss of Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s poem &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, there is a reference to &quot;the Platonic Constantinopolitan, Michael Psellus&quot; as an authority on &quot;the invisible inhabitants of this planet, neither departed souls nor angels&quot;.

The British poet Christopher Middleton includes a poem about Psellus in his 1986 collection, &quot;Two Horse Wagon Going By&quot;, &quot;Mezzomephistophelean Scholion&quot;.

Psellos appears also in Tim Severin&#x27;s novel &quot;Viking: King&#x27;s Man&quot;, the final piece of the &quot;Viking trilogy&quot;.

<doc id="142430" wikidata="Q222720" url="?curid=142430" title="Fargo (1996 film)">
<text>Fargo is a 1996 black comedy crime film written, directed, produced and edited by Joel and Ethan Coen. Frances McDormand stars as Marge Gunderson, a pregnant Minnesota police chief investigating a triple homicide that takes place after a desperate car salesman (William H. Macy) hires two dim-witted criminals (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife in order to extort a hefty ransom from her wealthy father (Harve Presnell). The film was an American and British co-production.

Filmed in the United States in late 1995, &quot;Fargo&quot; premiered at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, where Joel Coen won the festival&#x27;s &quot;Prix De La Mise En Scène&quot; (Best Director Award) and the film was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or. The film was both a critical and commercial success, earning particular acclaim for the Coens&#x27; direction and script and the performances of McDormand, Macy and Buscemi. &quot;Fargo&quot; received seven Oscar nominations at the 69th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor for Macy, winning two: Best Actress for McDormand and Best Original Screenplay for the Coens.

In 1998, the American Film Institute named it one of the 100 greatest American films in history (the most recent film on the list up to that point) but it was subsequently de-listed in 2007. In 2006, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; A Coen-produced FX television series of the same name, inspired by the film and taking place in the same fictional universe, premiered in 2014 and received widespread critical acclaim.

==Plot==
In 1987, Jerry Lundegaard is the executive sales manager of a Minneapolis car dealership owned by his father-in-law, Wade Gustafson. Desperate for money, he plans to have his wife Jean kidnapped so he can extort a ransom from Wade. On the recommendation of dealership mechanic and parolee Shep Proudfoot, Jerry meets Gaear Grimsrud and Carl Showalter at a bar in Fargo, North Dakota. Gaear and Carl agree to kidnap Jean in exchange for a new Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera and $40,000 of the ransom, which Jerry tells them would be $80,000.

Believing he has secured a $750,000 loan from Wade for a lucrative real estate deal, Jerry unsuccessfully tries to call off the kidnapping. However, Wade and his accountant Stan Grossman inform Jerry that Wade will handle the deal himself, offering Jerry only a modest finder&#x27;s fee. Carl and Gaear kidnap Jean and transport her to a remote cabin in Moose Lake. A state trooper stops them near Brainerd for not displaying temporary registration tags. The trooper rejects Carl&#x27;s clumsy bribe attempt, and orders Carl out of the car. The trooper hears Jean whimpering in the back seat, so Gaear shoots the trooper dead, then kills two passersby who witnessed the scene.

Brainerd police chief Marge Gunderson, who is pregnant, begins investigating. She correctly deduces that the dead trooper was ticketing a car with dealer plates. She later learns that two men driving a dealership vehicle checked into a nearby motel with two call girls and placed a call to Shep. Marge visits Wade&#x27;s dealership, where Shep feigns ignorance and Jerry nervously insists no cars are missing. While in Minneapolis, Marge reconnects with Mike Yanagita, a high school classmate. Mike awkwardly tries to romance her before breaking down and telling her his wife has died.

Jerry tells Wade the kidnappers have demanded $1 million and will deal only through him. In light of the three murders, Carl demands Jerry hand over the entire $80,000. Shep finds Carl with a call girl in Shep&#x27;s Minneapolis apartment and beats him for bringing Shep to the police&#x27;s attention. Carl angrily calls Jerry and demands that he bring the money immediately. Wade insists on delivering the ransom himself and meets Carl at a parking garage. Wade refuses to hand over the money without seeing his daughter, so Carl shoots him. Wade fires back, wounding Carl in the jaw. Carl kills Wade and a garage attendant, then drives away with the cash.

On the way to Moose Lake, Carl discovers the briefcase contains $1 million. He takes out $80,000 to split with Gaear and buries the rest in the snow alongside the highway. Marge learns from a friend that Yanagita lied; he has no wife and is mentally ill. Reflecting on this, Marge returns to Wade&#x27;s dealership. An agitated Jerry again insists no cars are missing and tells Marge he will double-check the inventory. Marge sees Jerry driving off the lot and calls the state police.

At the cabin, Carl finds that Gaear killed Jean because she would not be quiet. Carl says they should split up and leave immediately, and they argue over who will keep the Ciera. Carl insults Gaear and attempts to leave with the car, but Gaear kills him with an axe. Marge drives to Moose Lake, tipped off by a local bartender who overheard a customer brag about killing someone. She sees the Ciera, then discovers Gaear feeding Carl&#x27;s body into a woodchipper. Gaear attempts to flee, but Marge shoots him in the leg and arrests him. Shortly after, Jerry is arrested at a motel outside Bismarck, North Dakota.

Marge&#x27;s husband Norm tells her the Postal Service has selected his painting of a mallard for a three-cent postage stamp and complains that his friend&#x27;s painting won the competition for a twenty-nine cent stamp. Marge reminds him that smaller denomination stamps are used to make up the difference between the face value of old stamps and the new cost of first-class postage. Norm is reassured, and the couple happily anticipates the birth of their child.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Casting===
The Coens initially considered William H. Macy for a smaller role, but they were so impressed by his reading that they asked him to come back in and read for the role of Jerry. According to Macy, he was very persistent in getting the role, saying: &quot;I found out that they [the Coen brothers] were auditioning in New York still, so I got my jolly, jolly Lutheran ass on an airplane and walked in and said, &#x27;I want to read again because I&#x27;m scared you&#x27;re going to screw this up and hire someone else.&#x27; I actually said that. You know, you can&#x27;t play that card too often as an actor. Sometimes it just blows up in your face, but I said, &#x27;Guys, this is my role. I want this. Ethan Coen later remarked, &quot;I don&#x27;t think either of us [Coen brothers] realised what a tough acting challenge we were handing Bill Macy with this part. Jerry&#x27;s a fascinating mix of the completely ingenuous and the utterly deceitful. Yet he&#x27;s also guileless; even though he set these horrible events in motion, he&#x27;s surprised when they go wrong.&quot;

Frances McDormand learned how to use and fire a gun, spent days talking with a pregnant police officer and developed a backstory for her character along with John Carroll Lynch. After seeing the movie, McDormand noted that much of Marge was modeled on her sister Dorothy, who is a Disciples of Christ minister and chaplain.

===Filming===
&quot;Fargo&quot; was filmed during the winter of 1995, mainly in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area and around Pembina County, North Dakota. Due to unusually low snowfall totals in central and southern Minnesota that winter, scenes requiring snow-covered landscapes had to be shot in northern Minnesota and northeastern North Dakota, though not in or near the actual towns of Fargo and Brainerd. Cinematographer Roger Deakins shot the film on an Arriflex 35 BL-4 camera.
Jerry&#x27;s initial meeting with Carl and Gaear was shot at a pool hall and bar called The King of Clubs in the northeast section of Minneapolis. It was demolished in 2003, along with most other buildings on that block of Central Avenue, and replaced by low-income housing. Wade&#x27;s car dealership was actually Wally McCarthy Oldsmobile in Richfield, Minnesota, a southern suburb of Minneapolis. The site is now occupied by Best Buy&#x27;s national corporate headquarters. The 24-foot Paul Bunyan statue was built for the film (and subsequently dismantled) on Pembina County Highway 1, four miles west of Bathgate, North Dakota, near the Canadian border. The Blue Ox motel/truckstop was Stockmen&#x27;s Truck Stop in South St. Paul, which is still in business. Ember&#x27;s, the restaurant where Jerry discusses the ransom drop with Gustafson, was located in St. Louis Park, the Coens&#x27; hometown; the building now houses a medical outpatient treatment center.

The strip club where Marge interviews the two call girls was two separate locations; its exterior was the Lakeside Club in Mahtomedi, Minnesota, and interior the Loch Ness Lounge in Houlton, Wisconsin. The kidnappers&#x27; Moose Lake hideout actually stood on the shore of Square Lake, near May, Minnesota. The cabin was relocated to Barnes, Wisconsin, in 2002. The Edina police station where the interior police headquarters scenes were filmed is still in operation but has been completely rebuilt. The Carlton Celebrity Room was an actual venue in Bloomington, Minnesota, and José Feliciano did once appear there, but it had been closed for almost ten years when filming began. The Feliciano scene was shot at the Chanhassen Dinner Theatre in Chanhassen, near Minneapolis. The ransom drop was filmed in two adjacent parking garages on South 8th Street in downtown Minneapolis. Scenes in the Lundegaards&#x27; kitchen were shot in a private home on Pillsbury Avenue in Minneapolis, and the house where Mr. Mohra describes the &quot;funny looking little guy&quot; to police is in Hallock, in northwest Minnesota. The motel &quot;outside of Bismarck&quot;, where the police finally catch up with Jerry, is the Hitching Post Motel in Forest Lake, north of Minneapolis.

While none of &quot;Fargo&quot; was actually filmed in Fargo, the Fargo-Moorhead Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau exhibits original script copies and several props used in the film, including the wood chipper prop.

===Music===
As with all the Coen brothers&#x27; films, except &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot;, the score to &quot;Fargo&quot; is by Carter Burwell. The main musical motif is based on a Norwegian folk song, &quot;The Lost Sheep&quot; ().

Other songs featured in the film include: &quot;Big City&quot; by Merle Haggard, heard in the King of Clubs while Jerry meets with Carl and Gaear; &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;&quot; by Boy George, which plays in the garage as Shep works, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Find Each Other Tonight&quot;, a live nightclub performance by José Feliciano that is viewed by Carl and a female escort at such a far distance without a close-up that the viewer might deem it&#x27;s a lip synched stand-in. In the diner, when Jerry is urging Wade not to get police involved in his wife&#x27;s kidnapping, Chuck Mangione&#x27;s &quot;Feels So Good&quot; can be heard faintly in the background. An instrumental version of &quot;Do You Know the Way to San Jose&quot; plays during the scene where Marge and Norm are eating at a buffet. The restaurant scene with Mike Yanagita is accompanied by a piano arrangement of &quot;Sometimes in Winter&quot; by Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears. All the songs heard in the film are featured only as background music, usually on a radio, and do not appear on the soundtrack album.

The soundtrack was released in 1996 on TVT Records, combined with selections from the score to &quot;Barton Fink&quot;.

===Claims of factual basis===
The film opens with the following text:

The Coen brothers said that they based their script on an actual criminal event, but wrote a fictional story around it. &quot;We weren&#x27;t interested in that kind of fidelity&quot;, said Joel Coen. &quot;The basic events are the same as in the real case, but the characterizations are fully imagined ... If an audience believes that something&#x27;s based on a real event, it gives you permission to do things they might otherwise not accept.&quot;

The brothers have modified their explanation more than once. In 1996, Joel Coen told a reporter that—contrary to the opening graphic—the actual murders were not committed in Minnesota. Many Minnesotans speculated that the story was inspired by T. Eugene Thompson, a St. Paul attorney who was convicted of hiring a man to murder his wife in 1963, near the Coens&#x27; hometown of St. Louis Park; but the Coens said that they had never heard of Thompson. After Thompson&#x27;s death in 2015, Joel Coen changed the explanation again: &quot;[The story was] completely made up. Or, as we like to say, the only thing true about it is that it&#x27;s a story.&quot;

The film&#x27;s special edition DVD contains yet another account, that the film was inspired by the 1986 murder of Helle Crafts, a Danish–American flight attendant from Connecticut at the hands of her husband, Richard, who disposed of her body through a wood chipper.

In a 1998 article on the film&#x27;s &quot;true story&quot; claim, the fact-checking website Snopes concluded that it was a prank of the kind the Coen brothers often inserted in their films, without &quot;a word of truth to it.&quot; Snopes said that doubters should note that a fictitious persons disclaimer, used in works of fiction, is at the end of the film.

===Accent===
The film&#x27;s illustrations of &quot;Minnesota nice&quot; and distinctive regional accents and expressions made a lasting impression on audiences; years later, locals reported continuing to field tourist requests to say &quot;Yah, you betcha&quot;, and other tag lines from the movie. Dialect coach Liz Himelstein said that &quot;the accent was another character&quot;. She coached the cast using audiotapes and field trips. Another dialect coach, Larissa Kokernot (who also played one of the prostitutes), noted that the &quot;small-town, Minnesota accent is close to the sound of the Nords and the Swedes&quot;, which is &quot;where the musicality comes from&quot;. She taught McDormand &quot;Minnesota nice&quot; and the characteristic head-nodding to show agreement. The strong accent spoken by Macy&#x27;s and McDormand&#x27;s characters, which was exaggerated for effect, is less common in the Twin Cities area, where over 60% of the state&#x27;s population lives. The Minneapolis and St. Paul dialect is characterized by the Northern Cities Vowel Shift, which is also found in other places in the Northern United States as far east as Rochester, New York.

==Release==
&quot;Fargo&quot; premiered at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, where it was nominated for the competition&#x27;s highest honor, the Palme d&#x27;Or. Joel Coen won the top directorial award, the &quot;Prix de la mise en scène&quot;. Subsequent notable screenings included the Pusan International Film Festival in South Korea, the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech Republic, and the Naples Film Festival. In 2006, the sixth annual Fargo Film Festival marked &quot;Fargo&quot;″s tenth anniversary by projecting the movie on a gigantic screen mounted on the north side of Fargo&#x27;s then tallest building, the Radisson Hotel.

Released theatrically in the United States on March 8, 1996, &quot;Fargo&quot; launched in 36 theaters, and grossed $1,024,137 in its first week. In the film&#x27;s third week, &quot;Fargo&quot; was released in 412 theaters, and accumulated a total box office gross of $5,998,890. Overall it grossed $24,281,860 in the United States and Canada. Internationally, &quot;Fargo&quot; was released in Canada on April 5, 1996; in the United Kingdom on May 31, 1996, grossing $2.3 million; in Australia on June 6, 1996, grossing $1.5 million; in Spain on June 20, 1996, grossing $1.8 million; in France on September 4, 1996, grossing $3.9 million; and in Germany on November 14, 1996, grossing $2.4 million. Overall, the film&#x27;s international gross was an estimated $36 million for a worldwide total of $60.6 million.

== Reception ==
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Fargo&quot; holds an approval rating of 95% based on 104 reviews, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Violent, quirky, and darkly funny, &quot;Fargo&quot; delivers an original crime story and a wonderful performance by McDormand.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 86 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Arnold Wayne Jones, writing for the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot;, called the film an &quot;illuminating amalgam of emotion and thought&quot;, praising the directing and writing from the Coen brothers. From &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Lisa Schwarzbaum lauded the performance from Frances McDormand and stated that the film was &quot;dizzily rich, witty, and satisfying&quot;. In &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Anthony Lane singled out McDormand for praise: &quot;Her character—seven months pregnant, polite to a fault, smart yet slow—is only a breath away from caricature, yet McDormand unearths a surprising decency there, and in the process she pretty well rescues the film.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; journalist Mike Clark also praised the performance of McDormand:

On the other side of the spectrum, &quot;Time&quot; magazine film critic Richard Corliss criticized &quot;Fargo&quot; for its use of Minnesota nice, the accent used in the film. In his review, Corliss stated that &quot;After some superb mannerist films, the Coens are back in the deadpan realist territory of &quot;Blood Simple&quot;, but without the cinematic elan.&quot; (Conversely, Janet Maslin, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, deemed &quot;Fargo&quot; &quot;much more stylish and entertaining&quot; than &quot;Blood Simple&quot;). James Berardinelli, writing for his own website, &quot;ReelThoughts&quot;, gave the film three stars out of five, stating that it was &quot;easy to admire what the Coens are trying to do in &quot;Fargo&quot;, but more difficult to actually like the film.&quot;

John Simon of &quot;The National Review&quot; wrote &quot;The Coen brothers&#x27; &quot;Fargo&quot; is their best film so far, which isn&#x27;t saying very much&quot;. Simon elaborated further that &quot;&quot;Fargo&quot; could have been a nice little film noir if they hadn&#x27;t compounded it with black comedy, absurdism, and folksy farce: Scandinavian–American midwesterners up, or down, to their hickish shenanigans. Some of this surprisingly, works, some of it ranges from the unpalatable to the indigestible&quot;.

Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert both declared &quot;Fargo&quot; as the best film of 1996, with Ebert later ranking it fourth on his list of the best films of the 1990s. &quot;Fargo&quot; was added to the National Film Registry by the National Film Preservation Board on December 27, 2006. In 2010, the Independent Film &amp; Television Alliance selected the film as one of its &quot;30 Most Significant Independent Films&quot; of the last 30 years. The Writers Guild of America ranked the film&#x27;s screenplay the 32nd greatest ever.

Future North Dakota governor Doug Burgum, whose company Great Plains Software had its initial public offering during the film&#x27;s release, recalled that during investor meetings &quot;100 percent of the first question was about the movie. We had no paper shredders in our office, only woodchippers, we&#x27;d answer with a straight face. They&#x27;d say: &#x27;Really?!&#x27;&quot;

===Accolades===
==Home media==
&quot;Fargo&quot; has been released in several formats: VHS, LaserDisc, DVD, Blu-ray, and iTunes download. The first home video release of the film was on October 1, 1996, on a pan and scan cassette. A collector&#x27;s edition widescreen VHS was also released and included a snow globe that depicted the woodchipper scene which, when shaken, stirred up both snow and &quot;blood&quot;. PolyGram Video released &quot;Fargo&quot; on DVD on June 25, 1997. In 2001, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), who acquired the rights to the film through their purchase of PolyGram&#x27;s pre-March 31, 1996, library, released the film on VHS as part of its &quot;Contemporary Classics&quot; series. A &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD was released on September 30, 2003, by MGM Home Entertainment, which featured minor changes to the film, particularly with its subtitles. The opening titles stating &quot;This is a true story&quot; have been changed in this edition from the actual titles on the film print to digitally inserted titles. Also, the subtitle preceding Lundegaard&#x27;s arrest &quot;Outside of Bismarck, North Dakota&quot; has been inserted digitally and moved from the bottom of the screen to the top. The special edition of &quot;Fargo&quot; was repackaged in several Coen brothers box sets and also as a double feature DVD with other MGM releases.

A Blu-ray version was released on May 12, 2009, and later in a DVD combo pack in 2010. On April 1, 2014, in commemoration for the 90th anniversary of MGM, the film was remastered in 4K and reissued again on Blu-ray. On May 3, 2017, Shout! Factory announced a 20th anniversary collector&#x27;s Steelbook edition on Blu-ray, limited to 10,000 copies, which was released on August 8, 2017. On November 7, 2023, Shout! Factory released the film in a 4K Ultra HD and Blu-ray combo pack.

==Television series==
In 1997, a pilot was filmed for an intended television series based on the film. Set in Brainerd shortly after the events of the film, it starred Edie Falco as Marge Gunderson and Bruce Bohne reprising his role as Officer Lou. It was directed by Kathy Bates and featured no involvement from the Coen brothers. The episode aired in 2003 during Trio&#x27;s &quot;Brilliant But Cancelled&quot; series of failed TV shows.

A follow-up TV series inspired by the film, with the Coens as executive producers, debuted on FX in April 2014. The first season received acclaim from both critics and audiences. Existing in the same fictional continuity as the film, each season features a different story, cast, and timespan. The episode &quot;Eating the Blame&quot; from the first season reintroduced the buried ransom money for a minor three-episode subplot.

<doc id="142431" wikidata="Q224180" url="?curid=142431" title="Homology (biology)">
<text>In biology, homology is similarity in anatomical structures or genes between organisms of different taxa due to shared ancestry, &quot;regardless&quot; of current functional differences. Evolutionary biology explains homologous structures as retained heredity from a common ancestor after having been subjected to adaptive modifications for different purposes as the result of natural selection.

The term was first applied to biology in a non-evolutionary context by the anatomist Richard Owen in 1843. Homology was later explained by Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution in 1859, but had been observed before this from Aristotle&#x27;s biology onwards, and it was explicitly analysed by Pierre Belon in 1555. A common example of homologous structures is the forelimbs of vertebrates, where the wings of bats and birds, the arms of primates, the front flippers of whales, and the forelegs of four-legged vertebrates like horses and crocodilians are all derived from the same ancestral tetrapod structure.

In developmental biology, organs that developed in the embryo in the same manner and from similar origins, such as from matching primordia in successive segments of the same animal, are serially homologous. Examples include the legs of a centipede, the maxillary and labial palps of an insect, and the spinous processes of successive vertebrae in a vertebrate&#x27;s backbone. Male and female reproductive organs are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do the ovaries and testicles of mammals, including humans. 

Sequence homology between protein or DNA sequences is similarly defined in terms of shared ancestry. Two segments of DNA can have shared ancestry because of either a speciation event (orthologs) or a duplication event (paralogs). Homology among proteins or DNA is inferred from their sequence similarity. Significant similarity is strong evidence that two sequences are related by divergent evolution from a common ancestor. Alignments of multiple sequences are used to discover the homologous regions.

Homology remains controversial in animal behaviour, but there is suggestive evidence that, for example, dominance hierarchies are homologous across the primates.

==History==
Homology was noticed by Aristotle (c. 350 BC), and was explicitly analysed by Pierre Belon in his 1555 &quot;Book of Birds&quot;, where he systematically compared the skeletons of birds and humans. The pattern of similarity was interpreted as part of the static great chain of being through the mediaeval and early modern periods: it was not then seen as implying evolutionary change. In the German &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot; tradition, homology was of special interest as demonstrating unity in nature. In 1790, Goethe stated his foliar theory in his essay &quot;Metamorphosis of Plants&quot;, showing that flower parts are derived from leaves. The serial homology of limbs was described late in the 18th century. The French zoologist Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire showed in 1818 in his &quot;theorie d&#x27;analogue&quot; (&quot;theory of homologues&quot;) that structures were shared between fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammals. When Geoffroy went further and sought homologies between Georges Cuvier&#x27;s &quot;embranchements&quot;, such as vertebrates and molluscs, his claims triggered the 1830 Cuvier-Geoffroy debate. Geoffroy stated the principle of connections, namely that what is important is the relative position of different structures and their connections to each other. Embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer stated what are now called von Baer&#x27;s laws in 1828, noting that related animals begin their development as similar embryos and then diverge: thus, animals in the same family are more closely related and diverge later than animals which are only in the same order and have fewer homologies. Von Baer&#x27;s theory recognises that each taxon (such as a family) has distinctive shared features, and that embryonic development parallels the taxonomic hierarchy: not the same as recapitulation theory. The term &quot;homology&quot; was first used in biology by the anatomist Richard Owen in 1843 when studying the similarities of vertebrate fins and limbs, defining it as the &quot;same organ in different animals under every variety of form and function&quot;, and contrasting it with the matching term &quot;analogy&quot; which he used to describe different structures with the same function. Owen codified 3 main criteria for determining if features were homologous: position, development, and composition. In 1859, Charles Darwin explained homologous structures as meaning that the organisms concerned shared a body plan from a common ancestor, and that taxa were branches of a single tree of life.

==Definition==
The word homology, coined in about 1656, is derived from the Greek ὁμόλογος from ὁμός &#x27;same&#x27; and λόγος &#x27;relation&#x27;.

Similar biological structures or sequences in different taxa are homologous if they are derived from a common ancestor. Homology thus implies divergent evolution. For example, many insects (such as dragonflies) possess two pairs of flying wings. In beetles, the first pair of wings has evolved into a pair of hard wing covers, while in Dipteran flies the second pair of wings has evolved into small halteres used for balance.

Similarly, the forelimbs of ancestral vertebrates have evolved into the front flippers of whales, the wings of birds, the running forelegs of dogs, deer, and horses, the short forelegs of frogs and lizards, and the grasping hands of primates including humans. The same major forearm bones (humerus, radius, and ulna) are found in fossils of lobe-finned fish such as &quot;Eusthenopteron&quot;.

===Homology vs. analogy===

The opposite of homologous organs are analogous organs which do similar jobs in two taxa that were not present in their most recent common ancestor but rather evolved separately. For example, the wings of insects and birds evolved independently in widely separated groups, and converged functionally to support powered flight, so they are analogous. Similarly, the wings of a sycamore maple seed and the wings of a bird are analogous but not homologous, as they develop from quite different structures. A structure can be homologous at one level, but only analogous at another. Pterosaur, bird and bat wings are analogous as wings, but homologous as forelimbs because the organ served as a forearm (not a wing) in the last common ancestor of tetrapods, and evolved in different ways in the three groups. Thus, in the pterosaurs, the &quot;wing&quot; involves both the forelimb and the hindlimb. Analogy is called homoplasy in cladistics, and convergent or parallel evolution in evolutionary biology.

===In cladistics===

Specialised terms are used in taxonomic research. Primary homology is a researcher&#x27;s initial hypothesis based on similar structure or anatomical connections, suggesting that a character state in two or more taxa share is shared due to common ancestry. Primary homology may be conceptually broken down further: we may consider all of the states of the same character as &quot;homologous&quot; parts of a single, unspecified, transformation series. This has been referred to as topographical correspondence. For example, in an aligned DNA sequence matrix, all of the A, G, C, T or implied gaps at a given nucleotide site are homologous in this way. Character state identity is the hypothesis that the particular condition in two or more taxa is &quot;the same&quot; as far as our character coding scheme is concerned. Thus, two Adenines at the same aligned nucleotide site are hypothesized to be homologous unless that hypothesis is subsequently contradicted by other evidence. Secondary homology is implied by parsimony analysis, where a character state that arises only once on a tree is taken to be homologous. As implied in this definition, many cladists consider secondary homology to be synonymous with synapomorphy, a shared derived character or trait state that distinguishes a clade from other organisms.

Shared ancestral character states, symplesiomorphies, represent either synapomorphies of a more inclusive group, or complementary states (often absences) that unite no natural group of organisms. For example, the presence of wings is a synapomorphy for pterygote insects, but a symplesiomorphy for holometabolous insects. Absence of wings in non-pterygote insects and other organisms is a complementary symplesiomorphy that unites no group (for example, absence of wings provides no evidence of common ancestry of silverfish, spiders and annelid worms). On the other hand, absence (or secondary loss) of wings is a synapomorphy for fleas. Patterns such as these lead many cladists to consider the concept of homology and the concept of synapomorphy to be equivalent. Some cladists follow the pre-cladistic definition of homology of Haas and Simpson, and view both synapomorphies and symplesiomorphies as homologous character states.

==In different taxa==
Homologies provide the fundamental basis for all biological classification, although some may be highly counter-intuitive. For example, deep homologies like the &quot;pax6&quot; genes that control the development of the eyes of vertebrates and arthropods were unexpected, as the organs are anatomically dissimilar and appeared to have evolved entirely independently.

===In arthropods===
The embryonic body segments (somites) of different arthropod taxa have diverged from a simple body plan with many similar appendages which are serially homologous, into a variety of body plans with fewer segments equipped with specialised appendages. The homologies between these have been discovered by comparing genes in evolutionary developmental biology.

Among insects, the stinger of the female honey bee is a modified ovipositor, homologous with ovipositors in other insects such as the Orthoptera, Hemiptera, and those Hymenoptera without stingers.

===In mammals===
The three small bones in the middle ear of mammals including humans, the malleus, incus, and stapes, are today used to transmit sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. The malleus and incus develop in the embryo from structures that form jaw bones (the quadrate and the articular) in lizards, and in fossils of lizard-like ancestors of mammals. Both lines of evidence show that these bones are homologous, sharing a common ancestor.

Among the many homologies in mammal reproductive systems, ovaries and testicles are homologous.

Rudimentary organs such as the human tailbone, now much reduced from their functional state, are readily understood as signs of evolution, the explanation being that they were cut down by natural selection from functioning organs when their functions were no longer needed, but make no sense at all if species are considered to be fixed. The tailbone is homologous to the tails of other primates.

===In plants===
====Leaves, stems, and roots====
In many plants, defensive or storage structures are made by modifications of the development of primary leaves, stems, and roots. Leaves are variously modified from photosynthetic structures to form the insect-trapping pitchers of pitcher plants, the insect-trapping jaws of the Venus flytrap, and the spines of cactuses, all homologous.

Certain compound leaves of flowering plants are partially homologous both to leaves and shoots, because their development has evolved from a genetic mosaic of leaf and shoot development.

====Flower parts====

The four types of flower parts, namely carpels, stamens, petals, and sepals, are homologous with and derived from leaves, as Goethe correctly noted in 1790. The development of these parts through a pattern of gene expression in the growing zones (meristems) is described by the ABC model of flower development. Each of the four types of flower parts is serially repeated in concentric whorls, controlled by a small number of genes acting in various combinations. Thus, A genes working alone result in sepal formation; A and B together produce petals; B and C together create stamens; C alone produces carpels. When none of the genes are active, leaves are formed. Two more groups of genes, D to form ovules and E for the floral whorls, complete the model. The genes are evidently ancient, as old as the flowering plants themselves.

==Developmental biology==
Developmental biology can identify homologous structures that arose from the same tissue in embryogenesis. For example, adult snakes have no legs, but their early embryos have limb-buds for hind legs, which are soon lost as the embryos develop. The implication that the ancestors of snakes had hind legs is confirmed by fossil evidence: the Cretaceous snake &quot;Pachyrhachis problematicus&quot; had hind legs complete with hip bones (ilium, pubis, ischium), thigh bone (femur), leg bones (tibia, fibula) and foot bones (calcaneum, astragalus) as in tetrapods with legs today.

==Sequence homology==

As with anatomical structures, sequence homology between protein or DNA sequences is defined in terms of shared ancestry. Two segments of DNA can have shared ancestry because of either a speciation event (orthologs) or a duplication event (paralogs). Homology among proteins or DNA is typically inferred from their sequence similarity. Significant similarity is strong evidence that two sequences are related by divergent evolution of a common ancestor. Alignments of multiple sequences are used to indicate which regions of each sequence are homologous.

Homologous sequences are orthologous if they are descended from the same ancestral sequence separated by a speciation event: when a species diverges into two separate species, the copies of a single gene in the two resulting species are said to be &quot;orthologous&quot;. The term &quot;ortholog&quot; was coined in 1970 by the molecular evolutionist Walter Fitch.

Homologous sequences are paralogous if they were created by a duplication event within the genome. For gene duplication events, if a gene in an organism is duplicated, the two copies are paralogous. They can shape the structure of whole genomes and thus explain genome evolution to a large extent. Examples include the Homeobox (Hox) genes in animals. These genes not only underwent gene duplications within chromosomes but also whole genome duplications. As a result, Hox genes in most vertebrates are spread across multiple chromosomes: the HoxA–D clusters are the best studied.

Some sequences are homologous, but they have diverged so much that their sequence similarity is not sufficient to establish homology. However, many proteins have retained very similar structures, and structural alignment can be used to demonstrate their homology.

==In behaviour==
It has been suggested that some behaviours might be homologous, based either on sharing across related taxa or on common origins of the behaviour in an individual&#x27;s development; however, the notion of homologous behavior remains controversial, largely because behavior is more prone to multiple realizability than other biological traits. For example, D. W. Rajecki and Randall C. Flanery, using data on humans and on nonhuman primates, argue that patterns of behaviour in dominance hierarchies are homologous across the primates.

As with morphological features or DNA, shared similarity in behavior provides evidence for common ancestry. The hypothesis that a behavioral character is not homologous should be based on an incongruent distribution of that character with respect to other features that are presumed to reflect the true pattern of relationships. This is an application of Willi Hennig&#x27;s auxiliary principle.

<text>In mathematics, the term homology, originally introduced in algebraic topology, has three primary, closely-related usages. The most direct usage of the term is to take the &quot;homology of a chain complex&quot;, resulting in a sequence of abelian groups called &quot;homology groups.&quot; This operation, in turn, allows one to associate various named &quot;homologies&quot; or &quot;homology theories&quot; to various other types of mathematical objects. Lastly, since there are many homology theories for topological spaces that produce the same answer, one also often speaks of the &quot;homology of a topological space&quot;. (This latter notion of homology admits more intuitive descriptions for 1- or 2-dimensional topological spaces, and is sometimes referenced in popular mathematics.) There is also a related notion of the cohomology of a cochain complex, giving rise to various cohomology theories, in addition to the notion of the cohomology of a topological space.

== Homology of chain complexes ==
To take the homology of a chain complex, one starts with a chain complex, which is a sequence formula_1 of abelian groups formula_2 (whose elements are called chains) and group homomorphisms formula_3 (called boundary maps) such that the composition of any two consecutive maps is zero:

: formula_4

The formula_5th homology group formula_6 of this chain complex is then the quotient group formula_7 of cycles modulo boundaries, where the formula_5th group of cycles formula_9 is given by the kernel subgroup formula_10, and the formula_5th group of boundaries formula_12 is given by the image subgroup formula_13. One can optionally endow chain complexes with additional structure, for example by additionally taking the groups formula_14 to be modules over a coefficient ring formula_15, and taking the boundary maps formula_3 to be formula_15-module homomorphisms, resulting in homology groups formula_6 that are also quotient modules. Tools from homological algebra can be used to relate homology groups of different chain complexes.

== Homology theories ==
To associate a &quot;homology theory&quot; to other types of mathematical objects, one first gives a prescription for associating chain complexes to that object, and then takes the homology of such a chain complex. For the homology theory to be valid, all such chain complexes associated to the same mathematical object must have the same homology. The resulting homology theory is often named according to the type of chain complex prescribed. For example, singular homology, Morse homology, Khovanov homology, and Hochschild homology are respectively obtained from singular chain complexes, Morse complexes, Khovanov complexes, and Hochschild complexes. In other cases, such as for group homology, there are multiple common methods to compute the same homology groups.

In the language of category theory, a homology theory is a type of functor from the category of the mathematical object being studied to the category of abelian groups and group homomorphisms, or more generally to the category corresponding to the associated chain complexes. One can also formulate homology theories as derived functors on appropriate abelian categories, measuring the failure of an appropriate functor to be exact. One can describe this latter construction explicitly in terms of resolutions, or more abstractly from the perspective of derived categories or model categories.

Regardless of how they are formulated, homology theories help provide information about the structure of the mathematical objects to which they are associated, and can sometimes help distinguish different objects.

== Homology of a topological space ==
Perhaps the most familiar usage of the term homology is for the &quot;homology of a topological space&quot;. For sufficiently nice topological spaces and compatible choices of coefficient rings, any homology theory satisfying the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms yields the same homology groups as the singular homology (see below) of that topological space, with the consequence that one often simply refers to the &quot;homology&quot; of that space, instead of specifying which homology theory was used to compute the homology groups in question.

For 1-dimensional topological spaces, probably the simplest homology theory to use is graph homology, which could be regarded as a 1-dimensional special case of simplicial homology, the latter of which involves a decomposition of the topological space into simplices. (Simplices are a generalization of triangles to arbitrary dimension; for example, an edge in a graph is homeomorphic to a one-dimensional simplex, and a triangle-based pyramid is a 3-simplex.) Simplicial homology can in turn be generalized to singular homology, which allows more general maps of simplices into the topological space. Replacing simplices with disks of various dimensions results in a related construction called cellular homology.

There are also other ways of computing these homology groups, for example via Morse homology, or by taking the output of the Universal Coefficient Theorem when applied to a cohomology theory such as Čech cohomology or (in the case of real coefficients) De Rham cohomology.

=== Inspirations for homology (informal discussion) ===
One of the ideas that led to the development of homology was the observation that certain low-dimensional shapes can be topologically distinguished by examining their &quot;holes.&quot; For instance, a figure-eight shape has more holes than a circle formula_19, and a 2-torus formula_20 (a 2-dimensional surface shaped like an inner tube) has different holes from a 2-sphere formula_21 (a 2-dimensional surface shaped like a basketball).

Studying topological features such as these led to the notion of the &quot;cycles&quot; that represent homology classes (the elements of homology groups). For example, the two embedded circles in a figure-eight shape provide examples of one-dimensional cycles, or 1-cycles, and the 2-torus formula_20 and 2-sphere formula_21 represent 2-cycles. Cycles form a group under the operation of &quot;formal addition,&quot; which refers to adding cycles symbolically rather than combining them geometrically. Any formal sum of cycles is again called a cycle.

=== Cycles and boundaries (informal discussion) ===
Explicit constructions of homology groups are somewhat technical. As mentioned above, an explicit realization of the homology groups formula_24 of a topological space formula_25 is defined in terms of the &quot;cycles&quot; and &quot;boundaries&quot; of a &quot;chain complex&quot; formula_1 associated to formula_25, where the type of chain complex depends on the choice of homology theory in use. These cycles and boundaries are elements of abelian groups, and are defined in terms of the boundary homomorphisms formula_28 of the chain complex, where each formula_29 is an abelian group, and the formula_3 are group homomorphisms that satisfy formula_31 for all formula_32.

Since such constructions are somewhat technical, informal discussions of homology sometimes focus instead on topological notions that parallel some of the group-theoretic aspects of cycles and boundaries.

For example, in the context of chain complexes, a boundary is any element of the image formula_13 of the boundary homomorphism formula_28, for some formula_32. In topology, the boundary of a space is technically obtained by taking the space&#x27;s closure minus its interior, but it is also a notion familiar from examples, e.g., the boundary of the unit disk is the unit circle, or more topologically, the boundary of formula_36 is formula_19.

Topologically, the boundary of the closed interval formula_38 is given by the disjoint union formula_39, and with respect to suitable orientation conventions, the oriented boundary of formula_38 is given by the union of a positively-oriented formula_41 with a negatively oriented formula_42 The simplicial chain complex analog of this statement is that formula_43. (Since formula_44 is a homomorphism, this implies formula_45 for any integer formula_46.)

In the context of chain complexes, a cycle is any element of the kernelformula_10, for some formula_32. In other words, formula_49 is a cycle if and only if formula_50. The closest topological analog of this idea would be a shape that has &quot;no boundary,&quot; in the sense that its boundary is the empty set. For example, since formula_51, and formula_52 have no boundary, one can associate cycles to each of these spaces. However, the chain complex notion of cycles (elements whose boundary is a &quot;zero chain&quot;) is more general than the topological notion of a shape with no boundary.

It is this topological notion of no boundary that people generally have in mind when they claim that cycles can intuitively be thought of as detecting holes. The idea is that for no-boundary shapes like formula_19, formula_21, and formula_20, it is possible in each case to glue on a larger shape for which the original shape is the boundary. For instance, starting with a circle formula_19, one could glue a 2-dimensional disk formula_36 to that formula_19 such that the formula_19 is the boundary of that formula_36. Similarly, given a two-sphere formula_21, one can glue a ball formula_62 to that formula_21 such that the formula_21 is the boundary of that formula_62. This phenomenon is sometimes described as saying that formula_21 has a formula_62-shaped &quot;hole&quot; or that it could be &quot;filled in&quot; with a formula_62.

More generally, any shape with no boundary can be &quot;filled in&quot; with a cone, since if a given space formula_69 has no boundary, then the boundary of the cone on formula_69 is given by formula_69, and so if one &quot;filled in&quot; formula_69 by gluing the cone on formula_69 onto formula_69, then formula_69 would be the boundary of that cone. (For example, a cone on formula_19 is homeomorphic to a disk formula_36 whose boundary is that formula_19.) However, it is sometimes desirable to restrict to nicer spaces such as manifolds, and not every cone is homeomorphic to a manifold. Embedded representatives of 1-cycles, 3-cycles, and oriented 2-cycles all admit manifold-shaped holes, but for example the real projective plane formula_79 and complex projective plane formula_80 have nontrivial cobordism classes and therefore cannot be &quot;filled in&quot; with manifolds.

On the other hand, the boundaries discussed in the homology of a topological space formula_81 are different from the boundaries of &quot;filled in&quot; holes, because the homology of a topological space formula_81 has to do with the original space formula_81, and not with new shapes built from gluing extra pieces onto formula_81. For example, any embedded circle formula_85 in formula_21 already bounds some embedded disk formula_87 in formula_21, so such formula_85 gives rise to a boundary class in the homology of formula_21. By contrast, no embedding of formula_19 into one of the 2 lobes of the figure-eight shape gives a boundary, despite the fact that it is possible to glue a disk onto a figure-eight lobe.

=== Homology groups ===
Given a sufficiently-nice topological space formula_25, a choice of appropriate homology theory, and a chain complex formula_1 associated to formula_25 that is compatible with that homology theory, the formula_32th homology group formula_24 is then given by the quotient group formula_97 of formula_32-cycles (formula_32-dimensional cycles) modulo formula_32-dimensional boundaries. In other words, the elements of formula_24, called &quot;homology classes&quot;, are equivalence classes whose representatives are formula_32-cycles, and any two cycles are regarded as equal in formula_24 if and only if they differ by the addition of a boundary. This also implies that the &quot;zero&quot; element of formula_24 is given by the group of formula_32-dimensional boundaries, which also includes formal sums of such boundaries.

== Informal examples ==
The homology of a topological space &quot;X&quot; is a set of topological invariants of &quot;X&quot; represented by its &quot;homology groups&quot;
formula_106
where the formula_107 homology group formula_108 describes, informally, the number of holes in &quot;X&quot; with a &quot;k&quot;-dimensional boundary. A 0-dimensional-boundary hole is simply a gap between two components. Consequently, formula_109 describes the path-connected components of &quot;X&quot;.

A one-dimensional sphere formula_19 is a circle. It has a single connected component and a one-dimensional-boundary hole, but no higher-dimensional holes. The corresponding homology groups are given as
formula_111
where formula_112 is the group of integers and formula_113 is the trivial group. The group formula_114 represents a finitely-generated abelian group, with a single generator representing the one-dimensional hole contained in a circle.

A two-dimensional sphere formula_21 has a single connected component, no one-dimensional-boundary holes, a two-dimensional-boundary hole, and no higher-dimensional holes. The corresponding homology groups are
formula_116

In general for an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional sphere formula_117 the homology groups are
formula_118
A two-dimensional ball formula_119 is a solid disc. It has a single path-connected component, but in contrast to the circle, has no higher-dimensional holes. The corresponding homology groups are all trivial except for formula_120. In general, for an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional ball formula_121

formula_122

The torus is defined as a product of two circles formula_123. The torus has a single path-connected component, two independent one-dimensional holes (indicated by circles in red and blue) and one two-dimensional hole as the interior of the torus. The corresponding homology groups are
formula_124

If &quot;n&quot; products of a topological space &quot;X&quot; is written as formula_125, then in general, for an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional torus formula_126,

formula_127

(see Torus#n-dimensional torus and Betti number#More examples for more details).

The two independent 1-dimensional holes form independent generators in a finitely-generated abelian group, expressed as the product group formula_128 

For the projective plane &quot;P&quot;, a simple computation shows (where formula_129 is the cyclic group of order 2):
formula_130

formula_131 corresponds, as in the previous examples, to the fact that there is a single connected component. formula_132 is a new phenomenon: intuitively, it corresponds to the fact that there is a single non-contractible &quot;loop&quot;, but if we do the loop twice, it becomes contractible to zero. This phenomenon is called torsion.

== Construction of homology groups ==
The following text describes a general algorithm for constructing the homology groups. It may be easier for the reader to look at some simple examples first: graph homology and simplicial homology.

The general construction begins with an object such as a topological space &quot;X&quot;, on which one first defines a &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) encoding information about &quot;X&quot;. A chain complex is a sequence of abelian groups or modules formula_133. connected by homomorphisms formula_134 which are called boundary operators. That is,

:formula_135

where 0 denotes the trivial group and formula_136 for &quot;i&quot; &lt; 0. It is also required that the composition of any two consecutive boundary operators be trivial. That is, for all &quot;n&quot;,

:formula_137

i.e., the constant map sending every element of formula_138 to the group identity in formula_139

The statement that the boundary of a boundary is trivial is equivalent to the statement that formula_140, where formula_141 denotes the image of the boundary operator and formula_142 its kernel. Elements of formula_143 are called boundaries and elements of formula_144 are called cycles.

Since each chain group &quot;Cn&quot; is abelian all its subgroups are normal. Then because formula_142 is a subgroup of &quot;Cn&quot;, formula_142 is abelian, and since formula_147 therefore formula_141 is a normal subgroup of formula_142. Then one can create the quotient group

:formula_150

called the n&quot;th homology group of &quot;X. The elements of &quot;Hn&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) are called homology classes. Each homology class is an equivalence class over cycles and two cycles in the same homology class are said to be homologous.

A chain complex is said to be exact if the image of the (&quot;n&quot;+1)th map is always equal to the kernel of the &quot;n&quot;th map. The homology groups of &quot;X&quot; therefore measure &quot;how far&quot; the chain complex associated to &quot;X&quot; is from being exact.

The reduced homology groups of a chain complex &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) are defined as homologies of the augmented chain complex

:formula_151

where the boundary operator formula_152 is

:formula_153

for a combination formula_154 of points formula_155 which are the fixed generators of &quot;C&quot;0. The reduced homology groups formula_156 coincide with formula_157 for formula_158 The extra formula_112 in the chain complex represents the unique map formula_160 from the empty simplex to &quot;X&quot;.

Computing the cycle formula_161 and boundary formula_162 groups is usually rather difficult since they have a very large number of generators. On the other hand, there are tools which make the task easier.

The &quot;simplicial homology&quot; groups &quot;Hn&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) of a &quot;simplicial complex&quot; &quot;X&quot; are defined using the simplicial chain complex &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;), with &quot;Cn&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) the free abelian group generated by the &quot;n&quot;-simplices of &quot;X&quot;. See simplicial homology for details.

The &quot;singular homology&quot; groups &quot;Hn&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) are defined for any topological space &quot;X&quot;, and agree with the simplicial homology groups for a simplicial complex.

Cohomology groups are formally similar to homology groups: one starts with a cochain complex, which is the same as a chain complex but whose arrows, now denoted formula_163 point in the direction of increasing &quot;n&quot; rather than decreasing &quot;n&quot;; then the groups formula_164 of &quot;cocycles&quot; and formula_165 of follow from the same description. The &quot;n&quot;th cohomology group of &quot;X&quot; is then the quotient group

:formula_166

in analogy with the &quot;n&quot;th homology group.

== Homology vs. homotopy ==

The nth homotopy group formula_167 of a topological space formula_25 is the group of homotopy classes of basepoint-preserving maps from the formula_32-sphere formula_170 to formula_25, under the group operation of concatenation. The most fundamental homotopy group is the fundamental group formula_172. For connected formula_25, the Hurewicz theorem describes a homomorphism formula_174 called the Hurewicz homomorphism. For formula_175, this homomorphism can be complicated, but when formula_176, the Hurewicz homomorphism coincides with abelianization. That is, formula_177 is surjective and its kernel is the commutator subgroup of formula_172, with the consequence that formula_179 is isomorphic to the abelianization of formula_172. Higher homotopy groups are sometimes difficult to compute. For instance, the homotopy groups of spheres are poorly understood and are not known in general, in contrast to the straightforward description given above for the homology groups.

For an formula_176 example, suppose formula_25 is the figure eight. As usual, its first homotopy group, or fundamental group, formula_172 is the group of homotopy classes of directed loops starting and ending at a predetermined point (e.g. its center). It is isomorphic to the free group of rank 2, formula_184, which is not commutative: looping around the lefthand cycle and then around the righthand cycle is different from looping around the righthand cycle and then looping around the lefthand cycle. By contrast, the figure eight&#x27;s first homology group formula_185 is abelian. To express this explicitly in terms of homology classes of cycles, one could take the homology class formula_186 of the lefthand cycle and the homology class formula_187 of the righthand cycle as basis elements of formula_179, allowing us to write formula_189.

== Types of homology ==
The different types of homology theory arise from functors mapping from various categories of mathematical objects to the category of chain complexes. In each case the composition of the functor from objects to chain complexes and the functor from chain complexes to homology groups defines the overall homology functor for the theory.

=== Simplicial homology ===
The motivating example comes from algebraic topology: the simplicial homology of a simplicial complex &quot;X&quot;. Here the chain group &quot;Cn&quot; is the free abelian group or free module whose generators are the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional oriented simplexes of &quot;X&quot;. The orientation is captured by ordering the complex&#x27;s vertices and expressing an oriented simplex formula_190 as an &quot;n&quot;-tuple formula_191 of its vertices listed in increasing order (i.e. formula_192 in the complex&#x27;s vertex ordering, where formula_193 is the formula_194th vertex appearing in the tuple). The mapping formula_195 from &quot;Cn&quot; to &quot;Cn−1&quot; is called the and sends the simplex

:formula_196

to the formal sum

:formula_197

which is evaluated as 0 if formula_198 This behavior on the generators induces a homomorphism on all of &quot;Cn&quot; as follows. Given an element formula_49, write it as the sum of generators formula_200 where formula_201 is the set of &quot;n&quot;-simplexes in &quot;X&quot; and the &quot;mi&quot; are coefficients from the ring &quot;Cn&quot; is defined over (usually integers, unless otherwise specified). Then define

:formula_202

The dimension of the &quot;n&quot;-th homology of &quot;X&quot; turns out to be the number of &quot;holes&quot; in &quot;X&quot; at dimension &quot;n&quot;. It may be computed by putting matrix representations of these boundary mappings in Smith normal form.

=== Singular homology ===
Using simplicial homology example as a model, one can define a &quot;singular homology&quot; for any topological space &quot;X&quot;. A chain complex for &quot;X&quot; is defined by taking &quot;Cn&quot; to be the free abelian group (or free module) whose generators are all continuous maps from &quot;n&quot;-dimensional simplices into &quot;X&quot;. The homomorphisms ∂&quot;n&quot; arise from the boundary maps of simplices.

=== Group homology ===
In abstract algebra, one uses homology to define derived functors, for example the Tor functors. Here one starts with some covariant additive functor &quot;F&quot; and some module &quot;X&quot;. The chain complex for &quot;X&quot; is defined as follows: first find a free module formula_203 and a surjective homomorphism formula_204 Then one finds a free module formula_205 and a surjective homomorphism formula_206 Continuing in this fashion, a sequence of free modules formula_207 and homomorphisms formula_208 can be defined. By applying the functor &quot;F&quot; to this sequence, one obtains a chain complex; the homology formula_209 of this complex depends only on &quot;F&quot; and &quot;X&quot; and is, by definition, the &quot;n&quot;-th derived functor of &quot;F&quot;, applied to &quot;X&quot;.

A common use of group (co)homology formula_210 is to classify the possible extension groups &quot;E&quot; which contain a given &quot;G&quot;-module &quot;M&quot; as a normal subgroup and have a given quotient group &quot;G&quot;, so that formula_211

=== Other homology theories ===
* Borel–Moore homology
* Cellular homology
* Cyclic homology
* Hochschild homology
* Floer homology
* Intersection homology
* K-homology
* Khovanov homology
* Morse homology
* Persistent homology
* Steenrod homology
== Homology functors ==
Chain complexes form a category: A morphism from the chain complex (formula_212) to the chain complex (formula_213) is a sequence of homomorphisms formula_214 such that formula_215 for all &quot;n&quot;. The &quot;n&quot;-th homology &quot;Hn&quot; can be viewed as a covariant functor from the category of chain complexes to the category of abelian groups (or modules).

If the chain complex depends on the object &quot;X&quot; in a covariant manner (meaning that any morphism formula_216 induces a morphism from the chain complex of &quot;X&quot; to the chain complex of &quot;Y&quot;), then the &quot;Hn&quot; are covariant functors from the category that &quot;X&quot; belongs to into the category of abelian groups (or modules).

The only difference between homology and cohomology is that in cohomology the chain complexes depend in a &quot;contravariant&quot; manner on &quot;X&quot;, and that therefore the homology groups (which are called &quot;cohomology groups&quot; in this context and denoted by &quot;Hn&quot;) form &quot;contravariant&quot; functors from the category that &quot;X&quot; belongs to into the category of abelian groups or modules.

== Properties ==
If (formula_212) is a chain complex such that all but finitely many &quot;An&quot; are zero, and the others are finitely generated abelian groups (or finite-dimensional vector spaces), then we can define the &quot;Euler characteristic&quot;

:formula_218

(using the rank in the case of abelian groups and the Hamel dimension in the case of vector spaces). It turns out that the Euler characteristic can also be computed on the level of homology:

:formula_219

and, especially in algebraic topology, this provides two ways to compute the important invariant formula_220 for the object &quot;X&quot; which gave rise to the chain complex.

Every short exact sequence

:formula_221

of chain complexes gives rise to a long exact sequence of homology groups

:formula_222

All maps in this long exact sequence are induced by the maps between the chain complexes, except for the maps formula_223 The latter are called and are provided by the zig-zag lemma. This lemma can be applied to homology in numerous ways that aid in calculating homology groups, such as the theories of relative homology and Mayer-Vietoris sequences.

== Applications ==

=== Application in pure mathematics ===
Notable theorems proved using homology include the following:
* The Brouwer fixed point theorem: If &quot;f&quot; is any continuous map from the ball &quot;Bn&quot; to itself, then there is a fixed point formula_224 with formula_225
* Invariance of domain: If &quot;U&quot; is an open subset of formula_226 and formula_227 is an injective continuous map, then formula_228 is open and &quot;f&quot; is a homeomorphism between &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot;.
* The Hairy ball theorem: any continuous vector field on the 2-sphere (or more generally, the 2&quot;k&quot;-sphere for any formula_229) vanishes at some point.
* The Borsuk–Ulam theorem: any continuous function from an &quot;n&quot;-sphere into Euclidean &quot;n&quot;-space maps some pair of antipodal points to the same point. (Two points on a sphere are called antipodal if they are in exactly opposite directions from the sphere&#x27;s center.)
* Invariance of dimension: if non-empty open subsets formula_230 and formula_231 are homeomorphic, then formula_232

=== Application in science and engineering ===

In topological data analysis, data sets are regarded as a point cloud sampling of a manifold or algebraic variety embedded in Euclidean space. By linking nearest neighbor points in the cloud into a triangulation, a simplicial approximation of the manifold is created and its simplicial homology may be calculated. Finding techniques to robustly calculate homology using various triangulation strategies over multiple length scales is the topic of persistent homology.

In sensor networks, sensors may communicate information via an ad-hoc network that dynamically changes in time. To understand the global context of this set of local measurements and communication paths, it is useful to compute the homology of the network topology to evaluate, for instance, holes in coverage.

In dynamical systems theory in physics, Poincaré was one of the first to consider the interplay between the invariant manifold of a dynamical system and its topological invariants. Morse theory relates the dynamics of a gradient flow on a manifold to, for example, its homology. Floer homology extended this to infinite-dimensional manifolds. The KAM theorem established that periodic orbits can follow complex trajectories; in particular, they may form braids that can be investigated using Floer homology.

In one class of finite element methods, boundary-value problems for differential equations involving the Hodge-Laplace operator may need to be solved on topologically nontrivial domains, for example, in electromagnetic simulations. In these simulations, solution is aided by fixing the cohomology class of the solution based on the chosen boundary conditions and the homology of the domain. FEM domains can be triangulated, from which the simplicial homology can be calculated.

== Software ==

Various software packages have been developed for the purposes of computing homology groups of finite cell complexes. Linbox is a C++ library for performing fast matrix operations, including Smith normal form; it interfaces with both Gap and Maple. Chomp, CAPD::Redhom and Perseus are also written in C++. All three implement pre-processing algorithms based on simple-homotopy equivalence and discrete Morse theory to perform homology-preserving reductions of the input cell complexes before resorting to matrix algebra. Kenzo is written in Lisp, and in addition to homology it may also be used to generate presentations of homotopy groups of finite simplicial complexes. Gmsh includes a homology solver for finite element meshes, which can generate Cohomology bases directly usable by finite element software.

== Some non-homology-based discussions of surfaces ==

=== Origins ===
Homology theory can be said to start with the Euler polyhedron formula, or Euler characteristic. This was followed by Riemann&#x27;s definition of genus and &quot;n&quot;-fold connectedness numerical invariants in 1857 and Betti&#x27;s proof in 1871 of the independence of &quot;homology numbers&quot; from the choice of basis.

=== Surfaces ===
On the ordinary sphere formula_21, the curve &quot;b&quot; in the diagram can be shrunk to the pole, and even the equatorial great circle &quot;a&quot; can be shrunk in the same way. The Jordan curve theorem shows that any closed curve such as &quot;c&quot; can be similarly shrunk to a point. This implies that formula_21 has trivial fundamental group, so as a consequence, it also has trivial first homology group.

The torus formula_20 has closed curves which cannot be continuously deformed into each other, for example in the diagram none of the cycles &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; or &quot;c&quot; can be deformed into one another. In particular, cycles &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; cannot be shrunk to a point whereas cycle &quot;c&quot; can.

If the torus surface is cut along both &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, it can be opened out and flattened into a rectangle or, more conveniently, a square. One opposite pair of sides represents the cut along &quot;a&quot;, and the other opposite pair represents the cut along &quot;b&quot;.

The edges of the square may then be glued back together in different ways. The square can be twisted to allow edges to meet in the opposite direction, as shown by the arrows in the diagram. The various ways of gluing the sides yield just four topologically distinct surfaces:

formula_236 is the Klein bottle, which is a torus with a twist in it (In the square diagram, the twist can be seen as the reversal of the bottom arrow). It is a theorem that the re-glued surface must self-intersect (when immersed in Euclidean 3-space). Like the torus, cycles &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; cannot be shrunk while &quot;c&quot; can be. But unlike the torus, following &quot;b&quot; forwards right round and back reverses left and right, because &quot;b&quot; happens to cross over the twist given to one join. If an equidistant cut on one side of &quot;b&quot; is made, it returns on the other side and goes round the surface a second time before returning to its starting point, cutting out a twisted Möbius strip. Because local left and right can be arbitrarily re-oriented in this way, the surface as a whole is said to be non-orientable.

The projective plane formula_237 has both joins twisted. The uncut form, generally represented as the Boy surface, is visually complex, so a hemispherical embedding is shown in the diagram, in which antipodal points around the rim such as &quot;A&quot; and &quot;A′&quot; are identified as the same point. Again, &quot;a&quot; is non-shrinkable while &quot;c&quot; is. If &quot;b&quot; were only wound once, it would also be non-shrinkable and reverse left and right. However it is wound a second time, which swaps right and left back again; it can be shrunk to a point and is homologous to &quot;c&quot;.

Cycles can be joined or added together, as &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; on the torus were when it was cut open and flattened down. In the Klein bottle diagram, &quot;a&quot; goes round one way and −&quot;a&quot; goes round the opposite way. If &quot;a&quot; is thought of as a cut, then −&quot;a&quot; can be thought of as a gluing operation. Making a cut and then re-gluing it does not change the surface, so &quot;a&quot; + (−&quot;a&quot;) = 0.

But now consider two &quot;a&quot;-cycles. Since the Klein bottle is nonorientable, you can transport one of them all the way round the bottle (along the &quot;b&quot;-cycle), and it will come back as −&quot;a&quot;. This is because the Klein bottle is made from a cylinder, whose &quot;a&quot;-cycle ends are glued together with opposite orientations. Hence 2&quot;a&quot; = &quot;a&quot; + &quot;a&quot; = &quot;a&quot; + (−&quot;a&quot;) = 0. This phenomenon is called torsion. Similarly, in the projective plane, following the unshrinkable cycle &quot;b&quot; round twice remarkably creates a trivial cycle which &quot;can&quot; be shrunk to a point; that is, &quot;b&quot; + &quot;b&quot; = 0. Because &quot;b&quot; must be followed around twice to achieve a zero cycle, the surface is said to have a torsion coefficient of 2. However, following a &quot;b&quot;-cycle around twice in the Klein bottle gives simply &quot;b&quot; + &quot;b&quot; = 2&quot;b&quot;, since this cycle lives in a torsion-free homology class. This corresponds to the fact that in the fundamental polygon of the Klein bottle, only one pair of sides is glued with a twist, whereas in the projective plane both sides are twisted.

A square is a contractible topological space, which implies that it has trivial homology. Consequently, additional cuts disconnect it. The square is not the only shape in the plane that can be glued into a surface. Gluing opposite sides of an octagon, for example, produces a surface with two holes. In fact, all closed surfaces can be produced by gluing the sides of some polygon and all even-sided polygons (2&quot;n&quot;-gons) can be glued to make different manifolds. Conversely, a closed surface with &quot;n&quot; non-zero classes can be cut into a 2&quot;n&quot;-gon. Variations are also possible, for example a hexagon may also be glued to form a torus.

The first recognisable theory of homology was published by Henri Poincaré in his seminal paper &quot;Analysis situs&quot;, &quot;J. Ecole polytech.&quot; (2) 1. 1–121 (1895). The paper introduced homology classes and relations. The possible configurations of orientable cycles are classified by the Betti numbers of the manifold (Betti numbers are a refinement of the Euler characteristic). Classifying the non-orientable cycles requires additional information about torsion coefficients.

The complete classification of 1- and 2-manifolds is given in the table.
: Notes
:# For a non-orientable surface, a hole is equivalent to two cross-caps.
:# Any closed 2-manifold can be realised as the connected sum of &quot;g&quot; tori and &quot;c&quot; projective planes, where the 2-sphere formula_21 is regarded as the empty connected sum. Homology is preserved by the operation of connected sum.

In a search for increased rigour, Poincaré went on to develop the simplicial homology of a triangulated manifold and to create what is now called a simplicial chain complex. Chain complexes (since greatly generalized) form the basis for most modern treatments of homology.

Emmy Noether and, independently, Leopold Vietoris and Walther Mayer further developed the theory of algebraic homology groups in the period 1925–28. The new combinatorial topology formally treated topological classes as abelian groups. Homology groups are finitely generated abelian groups, and homology classes are elements of these groups. The Betti numbers of the manifold are the rank of the free part of the homology group, and in the special case of surfaces, the torsion part of the homology group only occurs for non-orientable cycles.

The subsequent spread of homology groups brought a change of terminology and viewpoint from &quot;combinatorial topology&quot; to &quot;algebraic topology&quot;. Algebraic homology remains the primary method of classifying manifolds.

<text>Jerry Maguire is a 1996 American sports comedy-drama film directed and written by Cameron Crowe. It was produced by Crowe and James L. Brooks for Gracie Films and distributed by TriStar Pictures. It stars Tom Cruise as the sports agent Jerry Maguire, alongside Cuba Gooding Jr., Renée Zellweger, Kelly Preston, Jerry O&#x27;Connell, Jay Mohr, Bonnie Hunt and Regina King. It was released in North American theaters on December 13, 1996.

&quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; was inspired by an experience the sports agent Leigh Steinberg, a technical consultant for the film, had with the client Tim McDonald (who makes a cameo appearance in this film) during the 1993 NFL season when free agency was introduced. The film was also partly inspired by a 28-page memo written at Disney in 1991 by Jeffrey Katzenberg.

&quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; received positive reviews for its performances and screenplay. It grossed more than $273 million worldwide against its $50 million budget. It was the ninth-highest-grossing film of 1996. It was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Cruise, with Cuba Gooding Jr. winning Best Supporting Actor. It received nominations for three Golden Globes, with Cruise winning for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, and three Screen Actors Guild Awards, with Gooding winning Best Supporting Actor.

&quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; gained a cult following and has spawned several catchphrases into popular culture, such as &quot;you had me at &#x27;hello&#x27;&quot; and “show me the money”.

== Plot ==

Jerry Maguire is a slick 35-year-old sports agent working for Sports Management International (SMI). After criticism from an injured player&#x27;s son triggers an epiphany, he writes a mission statement about perceived dishonesty in business and his desire to work with fewer clients to produce a better, more caring personal relationship with them.

In response, SMI management sends Bob Sugar, Jerry&#x27;s protégé, to fire him. This spurs both men to race to call every one of Jerry&#x27;s clients to retain them. Jerry speaks to Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Rod Tidwell, one of his smallest clients who is disgruntled with his pay. Rod tests Jerry&#x27;s resolve through a long tirade on his lack of contract extension. By the conclusion of the conversation, Jerry has retained Rod but lost his other clients to Sugar.

Leaving the office, Jerry loudly announces that he will start his own agency and asks if anyone will join him, to which only 26-year-old single mother Dorothy Boyd agrees. Frank &quot;Cush&quot; Cushman, a superstar quarterback prospect who is expected to be the number one pick in the NFL Draft, initially also stays with Jerry after he makes a personal visit to the Cushman home. Frank&#x27;s father insists on a handshake deal based on his word instead of a signed contract, but Jerry eventually realizes that Cush and his racist father have secretly stayed with Sugar after seeing Jerry spend time to introduce Rod to other football executives.

After an argument, Jerry breaks up with his disgruntled fiancée Avery who was emotionally unsupportive. He then turns to Dorothy, becoming closer to her young son, Ray, and eventually starts a romantic relationship with her.

Jerry concentrates all his efforts on Rod, now his only remaining client, who turns out to be difficult to satisfy. In need of money, Jerry calls in a favor to get a contract extension from Rod&#x27;s current team, the Arizona Cardinals, but receives a lowball offer. Rod and his wife decide to pass on the offer despite Jerry&#x27;s warning that if he gets injured, he will receive nothing.

Without any money coming in, Dorothy knows that Jerry is unable to afford payroll, so she decides to move to San Diego for a more secure job offer with health benefits. Afraid of losing her, Jerry proposes marriage to share health benefits, and she is smitten as she agrees.

Over the next several months, Rod and Jerry grow closer through a series of open and difficult conversations as they struggle to secure him a contract; Rod tells Jerry that he wants him to be honest, while Jerry tells Rod, &quot;help me help you,&quot; convincing him to stop complaining and start playing with his heart. Rod takes Jerry&#x27;s advice, playing well and advancing the Cardinals. Jerry&#x27;s marriage with Dorothy struggles however, and Dorothy suggests to Jerry that they amicably separate before losing too much of their lives to each other.

During a Christmas Day &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game between the Cardinals and the Dallas Cowboys, Rod catches a winning touchdown that secures the playoffs for the Cardinals, but appears to receive a serious injury. After a few scary minutes, he regains consciousness and celebrates with a dance for the wildly cheering crowd. After the scare and the widely-televised recovery, Jerry and Rod embrace in front of the media and show how their relationship has progressed from strictly business to a close personal one, which was one of the points Jerry made in his mission statement.

Triggering a realization, Jerry immediately flies home, finding Dorothy in a meeting of her sister&#x27;s divorcee support group. The group watches as Jerry gives an impassioned speech telling Dorothy he needs her and &quot;you complete me,&quot; to which she responds, &quot;shut up… you had me at hello.&quot;

Rod appears on ESPN&#x27;s Up Close with Roy Firestone. On air, he learns Jerry has secured him a massive $11.2 million contract with the Cardinals, allowing him to finish his pro football career in Arizona. Rod breaks down and thanks everyone, extending warm gratitude to Jerry. Jerry and Dorothy celebrate as Jerry is introduced to other pro athletes who have seen his work with Rod.

== Cast ==

As themselves:
Cameron Crowe originally wrote the screenplay for Tom Hanks. Crowe took so long to write the screenplay that by the time the film was ready to be made, he thought Hanks was too old to play the part. Woody Harrelson was offered the role but turned it down. Rod Tidwell was partially modeled after Charley Taylor.

Janet Jackson auditioned and was initially accepted for the role of Marcee Tidwell, though it later went to Regina King, who previously co-starred in Jackson&#x27;s debut film &quot;Poetic Justice&quot;. Jackson is referenced twice in the film, with a Janet poster seen hanging in Teepee&#x27;s room and Cuba Gooding Jr.&#x27;s character Rod Tidwell asking &quot;What Have You Done for Me Lately?&quot;, paying homage to Jackson&#x27;s hit of the same name.

Artie Lange filmed a scene for the movie but it was edited out of the final cut.

Patricia Arquette, Kate Beckinsale, Bridget Fonda, Winona Ryder, Marisa Tomei, Cameron Diaz, Uma Thurman and Jennifer Lopez were all considered for the part of Dorothy. Mira Sorvino was also considered for Dorothy but the producers would not meet her quote. The producers also considered Janeane Garofalo for the role of Dorothy but she was deemed too old for the part. Connie Britton auditioned for the role of Dorothy, and the choice was narrowed down to Zellweger and Britton, with Zellweger winning the part. Damon Wayans and Mykelti Williamson were considered for the role of Rod Tidwell. Jamie Foxx unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of Rod Tidwell. Diane Lane was considered for the role of Avery Bishop; however, the role was eventually given to Kelly Preston. Billy Wilder was considered for the part of Jerry&#x27;s mentor Dicky Fox.

== Soundtrack ==
&quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; was scored by Crowe&#x27;s then-wife, Nancy Wilson, a member of the rock band Heart. Songwriter Aimee Mann recorded a song, &quot;Wise Up&quot;, to be used in the film, but Crowe felt it did not fit. According to Crowe, he had used Mann&#x27;s original version, a simple demo piano, in a scene in which Jerry Maguire is moving through an airport. Mann&#x27;s final version was &quot;larger, more lush, more of a personal epic, and quite incredible... suddenly it was too big for the scene it was meant for.&quot; He said not being able to use it was &quot;heartbreaking&quot;. The song was included on the &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; soundtrack and later used in the 1999 film &quot;Magnolia&quot;.

&quot;Secret Garden&quot;, originally a Bruce Springsteen track from 1995, was re-released in 1997 after its exposure in the film and on the soundtrack, and reached No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

== Product placement ==
TriStar received merchandise and marketing services of over $1.5 million from Reebok in exchange for incorporating a commercial into the film and depicting the Reebok brand within certain agreed-upon standards; when the film was theatrically released, the commercial had been left out and a tirade including &quot;broadsides against Reebok&quot; was included. When the film aired on television, the Reebok commercial had been embedded into the film as originally agreed upon. The &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD release of the film, which has the film&#x27;s theatrical edit, includes the commercial as bonus content.

== Release ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; debuted at number one above &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot;, earning $17,084,296 during its opening weekend. The film would earn the second-highest December opening weekend at the time of its release, behind &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;. It eventually grossed $153,952,592 in North American box office and approximately $119.6 million internationally for a $273,552,592 worldwide total, on a budget of $50 million.
It was the ninth top-grossing film of 1996 and the fourth highest-grossing romantic drama film of all time.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; has an approval rating of 85% based on reviews from 91 critics, with an average score of 7.8/10. Its consensus states: &quot;Anchored by dazzling performances from Tom Cruise, Cuba Gooding Jr., and Renée Zellweger, as well as Cameron Crowe&#x27;s tender direction, &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; meshes romance and sports with panache.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 77 out of 100 based on reviews from 28 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Cuba Gooding Jr. won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Rod Tidwell, the Arizona Cardinals football player who sticks with Maguire. Cruise was also nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role and the movie marked Renée Zellweger&#x27;s breakout role. The film was nominated for Best Picture, and crew members on the film were nominated for Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing awards.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three out of four stars, writing that there &quot;are so many subplots that &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; seems too full&quot; and also commented that the film &quot;starts out looking cynical and quickly becomes a heartwarmer.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote &quot;An exceptionally tasty contempo comedic romance, &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; runs an unusual pattern on its way to scoring an unexpected number of emotional, social and entertaining points. Smartly written and boasting a sensational cast, Cameron Crowe&#x27;s shrewdly observed third feature also gives Tom Cruise one of his very best roles...&quot;

Former Green Bay Packers vice president Andrew Brandt said that the film &quot;accurately portrayed the cutthroat nature of the agent business, especially the lengths to which agents will go to retain or pilfer clients. It also captured the financial, emotional and psychological investment that goes far beyond negotiating contracts.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
The film&#x27;s screenplay was later voted the 66th greatest ever written in a poll by the Writers Guild of America.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; was first released on VHS and LaserDisc on May 29, 1997 by Columbia TriStar Home Video. 

Over 3 million copies were sold during its first week of release. It was re-released on VHS in the late 1990s. In its first week of release on VHS to stores and video stores in 1997, it made $80 million in sales and $7.6 million in rentals. The $80 million was split between video dealers and Columbia TriStar Home Video.

The film was first released onto DVD on June 24, 1997 and around 2002 respectively in both a standard edition and a two-disc &quot;Special Edition&quot;. While the standard edition contains no special features, the two-disc edition primarily includes deleted scenes, commentary tracks, featurettes, and a music video for Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Secret Garden&quot;. The film was later released on Blu-ray on September 9, 2008, with the same special features found on the second disc of the &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD. In 2008, the film was triple-packed with &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; and &quot;&quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;&quot; by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment/Universal Pictures Home Entertainment in the United Kingdom only. The film was double-featured with &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; via DVD in 2008 and also double-featured with &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; via DVD on December 29, 2009. The film was also chosen to be released in 4K as part of the Columbia Classics Collection: Volume 1 4K Ultra HD box set alongside &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;, &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, &quot;Gandhi&quot;, and &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; on June 16, 2020.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; spawned several popular quotations, including &quot;Show me the money!&quot; (shouted repeatedly in a phone exchange between Rod Tidwell and Jerry Maguire), &quot;You complete me&quot; , &quot;Help me help you,&quot; &quot;The key to this business is personal relationships&quot; and &quot;You had me at &#x27;hello&#x27;&quot; (said by Renée Zellweger&#x27;s Dorothy Boyd after a lengthy romantic plea by Jerry Maguire), and &quot;Kwan,&quot; a word used by Cuba Gooding Jr.&#x27;s Tidwell meaning love, respect, community, and money (also spelled &quot;quan&quot; and &quot;quawn&quot;) to illustrate the difference between himself and other football players: &quot;Other football players may have the coin, but they won&#x27;t have the &#x27;Kwan&#x27;.&quot; These lines are largely attributed to Cameron Crowe, director and screenwriter of the film. Zellweger said of filming the famous &quot;hello&quot; line, &quot;Cameron had me say it a few different ways. It&#x27;s so funny, because when I read it, I didn&#x27;t get it–I thought it was a typo somehow. I kept looking at it. It was the one thing in the script that I was looking at going, &#x27;Is that right? Can that be right? How is that right?&#x27; I thought, &#x27;Is there a better way to say that? Am I not getting it? I just don&#x27;t know how to do it.&#x27;&quot; Brandt stated in 2014 that &quot;I definitely noticed an uptick of young people becoming interested in the agent business after &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;&quot;. &quot;Some of what happened to the agent industry would have happened without &#x27;Jerry,&#x27; but definitely not as fast as it did,&quot; noted Peter Schaffer, who has been a sports agent since 1988.
In June 2008, AFI revealed its &quot;Ten Top Ten&quot;—the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; was acknowledged as the tenth best film in the sports genre. It was also voted by AFI as #100 on its list of 100 Passions. The quotes &quot;Show me the money!&quot; and &quot;You had me at &#x27;hello&#x27;&quot; were also ranked by AFI on its list of 100 Movie Quotes, ranked #25 and #52 respectively.

In June 2010, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; one of the 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years.

In 2017, the NFL produced two &quot;A Football Life&quot; mockumentaries to commemorate the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary edition; they portray the careers of Rod Tidwell and Frank Cushman after the events of the film. Beau Bridges, Jay Mohr, Jerry O&#x27;Connell, and Aries Spears reprised their roles from the film, along with Roy Firestone and several real-life sports figures, including Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. According to the fictional history, Cushman retired after only four years due to a severe case of athlete&#x27;s foot, and devoted himself to charity work with children with the same affliction; Tidwell was offered an even more lucrative contract, but declined, declaring that the &quot;quan&quot; was not there, and he preferred to devote more time to his family. The Tidwell mockumentary also features an adult Ray Boyd, inspired by Jerry and Rod to own his own boxing gym.

== Sequel ==
In a February 2021 interview, Crowe said he had considered making a sequel to &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; and that he had been approached several times about making a TV series adaptation of the film. In both cases, he felt that any continuation of the film&#x27;s story should focus on Rod Tidwell and his family life with wife Marcee.

<text>Karl Krumbacher (23 September 1856 – 12 December 1909) was a German scholar who was an expert on Byzantine Greek language, literature, history and culture. He was one of the principal founders of Byzantine Studies as an independent academic discipline in modern universities.

== Life and career ==
Krumbacher was born at Kürnach im Allgäu in the Kingdom of Bavaria. He studied Classical Philology and Indo-European linguistics at the Universities of Munich and Leipzig. In 1879 he passed the State Exam (Staatsexamen) and was thereafter active as a school teacher until 1891. In 1883 he gain his doctorate (Promotion) and in 1885 his Habilitation in Medieval and Modern Greek philology. From 1897 he was professor of Medieval and Modern Greek Language and Literature at the University of Munich and held the newly created Chair of Byzantine Studies, the first professorial chair in this subject in the world. Krumbacher founded the &quot;Byzantinische Zeitschrift&quot; (1892), the oldest academic journal of Byzantine Studies, and the &quot;Byzantinisches Archiv&quot; (1898). His collaborator at the time was Božidar Prokić, the renowned Belgrade Byzantinist. He died in Munich in 1909. His successor as Professor of Byzantine Studies was August Heisenberg, father of physicist Werner Heisenberg.

His most important work is &quot;Geschichte der byzantinischen Litteratur von Justinian bis zum Ende des oströmischen Reiches (527-1453)&quot; (History of Byzantine Literature from Justinian to the Fall of the East Roman Empire) in 1891. A second edition was published in 1897, with the collaboration of Albert Ehrhard (section on theology) and Heinrich Gelzer (general sketch of Byzantine history, AD 395–1453). The value of the work was greatly enhanced by its lengthy bibliographies and it remained a standard textbook for decades.

Krumbacher&#x27;s extensive travels in Greece and the Ottoman Empire became the basis of his &quot;Griechische Reise&quot; (1886). His notable works include studies of the poetry of Michael Glykas (1894) and Kassia (1897) and &quot;Populäre Aufsätze&quot; (1900). In &quot;Das Problem der neugriechischen Schriftsprache&quot; (1902) he strongly opposed the efforts of the Katharevousa purists to introduce the classical style into modern Greek language and literature. A full list of his works was published in the memorial edition of &quot;Byzantinische Zeitschrift&quot;.

<text>Climatology (from Greek , &quot;klima&quot;, &quot;slope&quot;; and , &quot;&quot;) or climate science is the scientific study of Earth&#x27;s climate, typically defined as weather conditions averaged over a period of at least 30 years. Climate concerns the atmospheric condition during an extended to indefinite period of time; weather is the condition of the atmosphere during a relative brief period of time. The main topics of research are the study of climate variability, mechanisms of climate changes and modern climate change. This topic of study is regarded as part of the atmospheric sciences and a subdivision of physical geography, which is one of the Earth sciences. Climatology includes some aspects of oceanography and biogeochemistry.

The main methods employed by climatologists are the analysis of observations and modelling of the physical processes that determine climate. Short term weather forecasting can be interpreted in terms of knowledge of longer-term phenomena of climate, for instance climatic cycles such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO), the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO), the Arctic oscillation (AO), the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). Climate models are used for a variety of purposes from studying the dynamics of the weather and climate system to predictions of future climate.

== History ==

The Greeks began the formal study of climate; in fact, the word &quot;climate&quot; is derived from the Greek word &quot;klima&quot;, meaning &quot;slope&quot;, referring to the slope or inclination of the Earth&#x27;s axis. Arguably the most influential classic text concerning climate was &quot;On Airs, Water and Places&quot; written by Hippocrates about 400 BCE. This work commented on the effect of climate on human health and cultural differences between Asia and Europe. This idea that climate controls which populations excel depending on their climate, or &quot;climatic determinism&quot;, remained influential throughout history. Chinese scientist Shen Kuo (1031–1095) inferred that climates naturally shifted over an enormous span of time, after observing petrified bamboos found underground near Yanzhou (modern Yan&#x27;an, Shaanxi province), a dry-climate area unsuitable at that time for the growth of bamboo.

The invention of thermometers and barometers during the Scientific Revolution allowed for systematic recordkeeping, that began as early as 1640–1642 in England. Early climate researchers include Edmund Halley, who published a map of the trade winds in 1686 after a voyage to the southern hemisphere. Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) first mapped the course of the Gulf Stream for use in sending mail from North America to Europe. Francis Galton (1822–1911) invented the term &quot;anticyclone&quot;. Helmut Landsberg (1906–1985) fostered the use of statistical analysis in climatology.

During the early 20th century, climatology mostly emphasized the description of regional climates. This descriptive climatology was mainly an applied science, giving farmers and other interested people statistics about what the normal weather was and how great chances were of extreme events. To do this, climatologists had to define a &quot;climate normal&quot;, or an average of weather and weather extremes over a period of typically 30 years. While scientists knew of past climate change such as the ice ages, the concept of climate as changing only very gradually was useful for descriptive climatology. This started to change during the decades that followed, and while the history of climate change science started earlier, climate change only became one of the main topics of study for climatologists during the 1970s and afterward.

== Subfields ==
Various subtopics of climatology study different aspects of climate. There are different categorizations of the sub-topics of climatology. The American Meteorological Society for instance identifies descriptive climatology, scientific climatology and applied climatology as the three subcategories of climatology, a categorization based on the complexity and the purpose of the research. Applied climatologists apply their expertise to different industries such as manufacturing and agriculture.

Paleoclimatology is the attempt to reconstruct and understand past climates by examining records such as ice cores and tree rings (dendroclimatology). Paleotempestology uses these same records to help determine hurricane frequency over millennia. Historical climatology is the study of climate as related to human history and is thus concerned mainly with the last few thousand years.

Boundary-layer climatology concerns exchanges in water, energy and momentum near surfaces. Further identified subtopics are physical climatology, dynamic climatology, tornado climatology, regional climatology, bioclimatology, and synoptic climatology. The study of the hydrological cycle over long time scales is sometimes termed hydroclimatology, in particular when studying the effects of climate change on the water cycle.

== Methods ==
The study of contemporary climates incorporates meteorological data accumulated over many years, such as records of rainfall, temperature and atmospheric composition. Knowledge of the atmosphere and its dynamics is also embodied in models, either statistical or mathematical, which help by integrating different observations and testing how well they match. Modeling is used for understanding past, present and potential future climates.

Climate research is made difficult by the large scale, long time periods, and complex processes which govern climate. Climate is governed by physical principles which can be expressed as differential equations. These equations are coupled and nonlinear, so that approximate solutions are obtained by using numerical methods to create global climate models. Climate is sometimes modeled as a stochastic process but this is generally accepted as an approximation to processes that are otherwise too complicated to analyze.

=== Climate data ===
The collection of a long record of climate variables is essential for the study of climate. Climatology deals with the aggregate data that meteorologists have recorded. Scientists use both direct and indirect observations of the climate, from Earth observing satellites and scientific instrumentation such as a global network of thermometers, to prehistoric ice extracted from glaciers. As measuring technology changes over time, records of data often cannot be compared directly. As cities are generally warmer than the areas surrounding, urbanization has made it necessary to constantly correct data for this urban heat island effect.

=== Models ===

Climate models use quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice. They are used for a variety of purposes from study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system to projections of future climate. All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the Earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the Earth. Any unbalance results in a change of the average temperature of the Earth. Most climate models include the radiative effects of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. These models predict a trend of increase of surface temperatures, as well as a more rapid increase of temperature at higher latitudes.

Models can range from relatively simple to complex:
* A simple radiant heat transfer model that treats the Earth as a single point and averages outgoing energy.
* This can be expanded vertically (radiative-convective models), or horizontally.
* Coupled atmosphere–ocean–sea ice global climate models discretise and solve the full equations for mass and energy transfer and radiant exchange.
* Earth system models further include the biosphere.

Additionally, they are available with different resolutions ranging from &gt;100 km to 1 km. High resolutions in global climate models are computational very demanding and only few global datasets exists. Examples are ICON or mechanistically downscaled data such as CHELSA (Climatologies at high resolution for the Earth&#x27;s land surface areas).

== Topics of research ==
Topics that climatologists study comprise three main categories: climate variability, mechanisms of climatic change, and modern changes of climate.

=== Climatological processes ===
Various factors affect the average state of the atmosphere at a particular location. For instance, midlatitudes will have a pronounced seasonal cycle of temperature whereas tropical regions show little variation of temperature over a year. Another major variable of climate is continentality: the distance to major water bodies such as oceans. Oceans act as a moderating factor, so that land close to it has typically less difference of temperature between winter and summer than areas further from it. The atmosphere interacts with other parts of the climate system, with winds generating ocean currents that transport heat around the globe.

=== Climate classification ===
Classification is an important method of simplifying complicated processes. Different climate classifications have been developed over the centuries, with the first ones in Ancient Greece. How climates are classified depends on what the application is. A wind energy producer will require different information (wind) in a classification than someone more interested in agriculture, for whom precipitation and temperature are more important. The most widely used classification, the Köppen climate classification, was developed during the late nineteenth century and is based on vegetation. It uses monthly data concerning temperature and precipitation.

=== Climate variability ===
There are different types of variability: recurring patterns of temperature or other climate variables. They are quantified with different indices. Much in the way the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is based on the stock prices of 30 companies, is used to represent the fluctuations of stock prices in general, climate indices are used to represent the essential elements of climate. Climate indices are generally devised with the twin objectives of simplicity and completeness, and each index typically represents the status and timing of the climate factor it represents. By their very nature, indices are simple, and combine many details into a generalized, overall description of the atmosphere or ocean which can be used to characterize the factors which effect the global climate system.

El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean responsible for much of the global variability of temperature, and has a cycle between two and seven years. The North Atlantic oscillation is a mode of variability that is mainly contained to the lower atmosphere, the troposphere. The layer of atmosphere above, the stratosphere is also capable of creating its own variability, most importantly the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO), which has a cycle of approximately 30 to 60 days. The Interdecadal Pacific oscillation can create changes in the Pacific Ocean and lower atmosphere on decadal time scales.

=== Climate change ===
Climate change occurs when changes of Earth&#x27;s climate system result in new weather patterns that remain for an extended period of time. This duration of time can be as brief as a few decades to as long as millions of years. The climate system receives nearly all of its energy from the sun. The climate system also gives off energy to outer space. The balance of incoming and outgoing energy, and the passage of the energy through the climate system, determines Earth&#x27;s energy budget. When the incoming energy is greater than the outgoing energy, earth&#x27;s energy budget is positive and the climate system is warming. If more energy goes out, the energy budget is negative and earth experiences cooling. Climate change also influences the average sea level.

Modern climate change is caused largely by the human emissions of greenhouse gas from the burning of fossil fuel which increases global mean surface temperatures. Increasing temperature is only one aspect of modern climate change, which also includes observed changes of precipitation, storm tracks and cloudiness. Warmer temperatures are causing further changes of the climate system, such as the widespread melt of glaciers, sea level rise and shifts of flora and fauna.

== Differences with meteorology ==
In contrast to meteorology, which emphasises short term weather systems lasting no more than a few weeks, climatology studies the frequency and trends of those systems. It studies the periodicity of weather events over years to millennia, as well as changes of long-term average weather patterns in relation to atmospheric conditions. Climatologists study both the nature of climates – local, regional or global – and the natural or human-induced factors that cause climates to change. Climatology considers the past and can help predict future climate change.

Phenomena of climatological interest include the atmospheric boundary layer, circulation patterns, heat transfer (radiative, convective and latent), interactions between the atmosphere and the oceans and land surface (particularly vegetation, land use and topography), and the chemical and physical composition of the atmosphere.

== Use in weather forecasting ==

A relative difficult method of forecast, the analog technique requires remembering a previous weather event which is expected to be mimicked by an upcoming event. What makes it a difficult technique is that there is rarely a perfect analog for an event of the future. Some refer to this type of forecasting as pattern recognition, which remains a useful method of estimating rainfall over data voids such as oceans using knowledge of how satellite imagery relates to precipitation rates over land, as well as the forecasting of precipitation amounts and distribution of the future. A variation of this theme, used for medium range forecasting, is known as teleconnections, when systems in other locations are used to help determine the location of a system within the regime surrounding. One method of using teleconnections are by using climate indices such as ENSO-related phenomena.

<text>Shine is a 1996 Australian biographical psychological drama film directed by Scott Hicks from a screenplay by Jan Sardi, based on the life of David Helfgott, a pianist who suffered a mental breakdown and spent years in institutions. The film stars Armin Mueller-Stahl, Noah Taylor, Geoffrey Rush, Lynn Redgrave, Googie Withers, Sonia Todd and John Gielgud.
&quot;Shine&quot; had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 1996, followed by a theatrical release in Australia on August 15. At the 69th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for seven awards including Best Picture, with Rush winning Best Actor.

==Plot==
A man wanders through a heavy rainstorm, finding his way into a nearby restaurant. The restaurant&#x27;s employees try to determine if he needs help. Despite his manic mode of speech being difficult to understand, a waitress, Sylvia, learns that his name is David Helfgott and that he is staying at a local hotel. Sylvia returns him to the hotel, and despite his attempts to impress her with his musical knowledge and ownership of various musical scores, she leaves.

As a child, David is growing up in suburban Adelaide, South Australia, and competing in the musical competition of a local Eisteddfod. Helfgott has been taught to play by his father, Peter, who is obsessed with winning and has no tolerance for imperfection, dishonour and disobedience. While playing at the Eisteddfod, David is noticed by Mr. Rosen, a local piano teacher who, after initial resistance from Peter, takes over David&#x27;s musical instruction.

As a teenager, David wins the state musical championship and is invited by concert violinist Isaac Stern to study in the United States. Plans are made to raise money to send David off to America. Initially, his family is supportive, but then Peter forbids David to leave, thinking his absence would destroy the family. Peter begins physically and mentally abusing David, which upsets the rest of the family.

Crushed, David continues to study and befriends local novelist and co-founder of the Communist Party of Australia, Katharine Susannah Prichard. David is eventually offered a scholarship to the Royal College of Music in London. This time, David is able to break away from his father with the encouragement of Katharine. However, his father issues an ultimatum, effectively banishing David and saying that David will never return home and never be anybody&#x27;s son.

In London, David studies under Dr. Cecil Parkes and enters a music competition, choosing to play Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s demanding 3rd Piano Concerto, a piece he had attempted to learn as a young child to make his father proud.

As David practices, he shows signs of mental stress. David wins the competition, but suffers a mental breakdown and is admitted to a psychiatric hospital where he receives electroshock therapy. David recovers to the point where he is able to return to Adelaide. However, his attempts to reconcile with his father are rebuffed due to the latter&#x27;s belief that David had abandoned his family. This causes David to relapse and he is readmitted to a mental institution.

Years later, a volunteer at the institution recognises David and knows of his musical talent. The woman takes him home but discovers that he is difficult to control, unintentionally destructive, and needs more care than she can offer. As time passes, David has difficulty adjusting to life in broader society again, and often leaves the hotel to stimulate his interests.

The next day, David returns to the restaurant where the patrons are astounded by his skill at the piano. One of the owners befriends David and looks after him. In return, David plays at the restaurant. Through the owner, David is introduced to an employee named Gillian. David and Gillian soon fall in love and marry. With Gillian&#x27;s help and support, David is able to come to terms with his father&#x27;s death and to stage a well-received comeback concert, presaging his return to professional music.

==Cast==


==Production==
Scott Hicks decided to make a film about David Helfgott after seeing him perform in Adelaide in 1985. It took a year for Hicks to persuade Helfgott and his wife Gillian, persevering &quot;because he was so inspired by the pianist’s story.&quot;

Hicks brought on friend and colleague John MacGregor to help with research and interviewing Helfgott’s friends, family, and teachers. Jan Sardi, who had been a script editor on Hicks’ previous feature, &quot;Sebastian and the Sparrow&quot;, was also brought on to work on the final draft of the script, which had materialized by the early 1990s. During the scripting stage, Ronin Films signed on as the Australasian distributor for the film.

Hicks met with Geoffrey Rush in 1992, having been familiar with his work in Adelaide theatre. &quot;He was mesmerising on stage and he had the physiognomy, and physiology and the hands to play David,&quot; said Hicks. However, Hicks faced resistance from investors in his decision to cast Rush, who was then a theatre actor with no major projects to his name. A crucial deal in the film getting made was Pandora Cinema’s acquisition of the international and U.S. distribution rights. &quot;The difference there was the person we were dealing with had seen Geoffrey Rush on stage in Sydney and so knew what I was talking about when I said this actor is extraordinary,&quot; Hicks said.

Geoffrey Rush resumed piano lessons—suspended when he was 14—in order not to require a hand double.

==Reception==

The critical consensus states, &quot;featuring a strong performance from Geoffrey Rush, &quot;Shine&quot; succeeds in telling a compelling, inspirational story without resorting to cheap sentimentality&quot;. On Metacritic, the film holds an 87 rating out of a possible 100 from 27 critic reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Critic Roger Ebert rated the film four out of four stars, stating &quot;There has been much talk in 1996 about films whose filmmakers claim they were based on true stories but were kidding (&quot;Fargo&quot;), and films whose filmmakers claimed they were based on true stories but might have been lying (&quot;Sleepers&quot;). Here is a movie that is based on the truth beneath a true story.&quot;

==Historical accuracy==
Some family members have stated that certain events and relationships in David Helfgott&#x27;s life are portrayed inaccurately in the film. Helfgott&#x27;s sister Margaret Helfgott, in her book &quot;Out of Tune&quot;, states that Helfgott&#x27;s father Peter Helfgott was a loving husband, over-lenient parent and not the abusive tyrant portrayed in &quot;Shine&quot;. She states that Peter Helfgott&#x27;s decision to prevent David from going overseas at the age of 14 was a reasonable judgment that he was not ready for such independence.

Margaret and Les Helfgott (David&#x27;s brother) have stated that &quot;there was no estrangement from members of David&#x27;s family following his return to Australia. On the contrary, he moved straight back into the family home, and was cared for by our family. Dad was not &#x27;overbearing&#x27;, and his main objection to David&#x27;s going abroad was his concern for his son&#x27;s welfare.&quot;

Les Helgott has described the portrayal of their father both in &quot;Shine&quot; and in Gillian Helfgott&#x27;s biography as &quot;all outright lies&quot;. David Helfgott&#x27;s first wife Clare Papp has also said that Peter Helfgott was &quot;quite badly maligned&quot; in the film. Helfgott&#x27;s mother said the film haunted her and that she felt &quot;an evil had been done&quot;.

Scott Hicks has defended the authenticity of the movie&#x27;s portrayal of Helfgott&#x27;s childhood and suggested that David&#x27;s other siblings, Susie and Les, were at odds with Margaret&#x27;s claims and were happy with the movie. John Macgregor—who was involved in the research and wrote an early treatment for &quot;Shine&quot;—claimed that the portrayal of the Helfgotts&#x27; father was supported not only by David but (with the exception of Margaret) by every family member and family friend he and Scott Hicks interviewed, as well as by every interviewee who had a professional or musical connection with David throughout his early life.

=== Pianistic ability ===
The New Zealand philosopher Denis Dutton claims that the film grossly exaggerates Helfgott&#x27;s pianistic ability, drawing public attention away from pianists who are more talented and disciplined.

<text>Dionysus-Osiris, alternatively Osiris-Dionysus, is a deity arising from the syncretism of the Egyptian god Osiris and the Greek god Dionysus.

== Syncretism ==
The two deities had been identified with each other as early as the 5th century BC, as recounted in the &quot;Histories&quot; of Herodotus:
 Other syncretic deities arose from these Egyptian-Greek conflations, including Serapis and Hermanubis. 

Dionysus-Osiris was particularly popular in Ptolemaic Egypt, as the Ptolemies claimed descent from Dionysus, and as pharaohs claimed the lineage of Osiris. This association was most notable during a deification ceremony where Mark Antony became Dionysus-Osiris, alongside Cleopatra as Isis-Aphrodite.

In the controversial book &quot;The Jesus Mysteries&quot;, Osiris-Dionysus is claimed to be the basis of Jesus as a syncretic dying-and-rising god, with early Christianity beginning as a Greco-Roman mystery. The book and its &quot;Jesus Mysteries thesis&quot; have not been accepted by mainstream scholarship, with Bart Ehrman stating that the work is unscholarly.

<doc id="142446" wikidata="Q590871" url="?curid=142446" title="Hypermetamorphosis">
<text>Hypermetamorphosis, or heteromorphosis, is a term used mainly in entomology; it refers to a class of variants of holometabolism, that is to say, complete insect metamorphosis. Hypermetamorphosis is exceptional in that some instars, usually larval instars, are functionally and visibly distinct from the rest. The differences between such instars usually reflect transient stages in the life cycle; for instance, one instar might be mobile while it searches for its food supply, while the following instar immediately sheds its locomotory organs and settles down to feed until it is fully grown and ready to change into the reproductive stage, which in turn, does not have the same nutritional requirements as the larvae.

==Description==

Hypermetamorphosis, as the term normally is used in entomology, refers to a class of variants of holometabolism. In hypermetamorphosis some larval instars are functionally and morphologically distinct from each other.
The general case in holometabolous insects such as flies, moths, or wasps, is that all larval stages look similar, growing larger as the insect matures. In hypermetamorphic insects however, at least one instar, usually the first, differs markedly from the rest. In many hypermetamorphic species, the first instars are numerous, tiny, very mobile larvae that must find their way to a food source. The general term for a mobile first instar is a planidium, from the Greek language &quot;πλάνος&quot; (planos) meaning &quot;roaming&quot;.

In typical examples the first-instar larval morphology is (meaning: elongated, flattened, and active, more or less resembling the morphology of hexapods in the genus &quot;Campodea&quot;). There is however, considerable variety in the forms of planidia that occur in various families and orders; in the beetle family Meloidae, the three-clawed planidium originally was called a triungulin, and similar planidia for example, those of the Strepsiptera, may also be called triungula.

In their planidial form, many species do not feed; they first molt into a form suited to eating rather than seeking out food. The second instar is completely different in appearance and behavior, often becoming grub- or maggot-like in the instars before pupation. As a rule, the instars after the first ecdysis are of more or less constant form and not highly mobile, being specialised for feeding and growth until the final larval instar metamorphoses into the pupal form.

The moth family Gracillariidae is an unusual case of hypermetamorphosis in that its first few larval instars do feed, but differently to later instars. Specifically, early instars feed on plant sap (and for this reason have modified mandibles) while later instars feed on plant tissue. Furthermore, instead of becoming less mobile during the larval stage, larvae become more mobile, with early instars lacking legs while later instars possess legs.

There are examples of holometabolic species in which there are certain striking differences between the earliest instars and the later instars, though &quot;without&quot; their generally being regarded as hypermetamorphic. For example, early instars of many Papilionidae are of a colour, shape and texture that suggest bird droppings; later instars that are larger and would simply stand out in such camouflage, typically become green. The prepupa or last larval instar of insects ceases to feed and (in some cases) searches for a place to pupate, but this also is not considered hypermetamorphosis.

==Various forms of hypermetamorphosis==
Hypermetamorphosis usually occurs as an adaptation of the ontogeny of certain parasitoid insects, notably: 
* the beetle families Meloidae and Ripiphoridae, 
* the order Strepsiptera ,
* the moth family Gracillariidae, 
* flies in the families Acroceridae, Bombyliidae and Nemestrinidae, 
* The Neuropteran family Mantispidae and
* the parasitic wasp family Eucharitidae. 
Technically, the subimago of the Ephemeroptera might be described as a stage in a form of hypermetamorphosis, but that is not common practice.

Examples of hypermetamorphosis in any given insect order are analogous and not homologous to those in any other order; for example, hypermetamorphosis in the Acroceridae was not derived from the Strepsiptera.

<text>As Good as It Gets is a 1997 American romantic comedy film directed by James L. Brooks from a screenplay he co-wrote with Mark Andrus. It stars Jack Nicholson as a misanthropic, bigoted and obsessive–compulsive novelist, Helen Hunt as a single mother with a chronically ill son, and Greg Kinnear as a gay artist.

&quot;As Good as It Gets&quot; premiered at the Regency Village Theatre on December 6, 1997, and was released theatrically in the United States on Christmas Day. A critical and box office hit, it grossed $314.1 million on a $50 million budget. At the 70th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for 7 awards, including Best Picture. Nicholson won for Best Actor and Hunt for Best Actress, making it the most recent film to win both of the lead-acting awards. It is ranked 140th on &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot; list.

==Plot==
Misanthropic New York City best-selling romance novelist Melvin Udall has obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). He uses soap bars only once to wash his hands, uses paper towels to touch public restroom faucets and door handles, avoids stepping on sidewalk cracks, has rituals with switches and locks, sticks to rigid routines and always eats breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant while bringing his own plastic flatware. Carol Connelly is the only server at the restaurant who can tolerate his odd and rude behavior.

Melvin&#x27;s apartment neighbor, gay artist Simon Bishop, starts working with a new model, Vincent Lopiano. Vincent uses the opportunity to case Simon&#x27;s apartment and give entry to his friends, who assault and nearly kill Simon during the robbery. Simon&#x27;s agent, Frank Sachs, intimidates Melvin into caring for Simon&#x27;s pet dog Verdell, a Griffon Bruxellois, while Simon is hospitalized. Although Melvin initially does not enjoy caring for the dog, he becomes emotionally attached to it. When Simon is released from the hospital, Melvin tolerates a neighborly relationship with Simon so he can continue to see Verdell.

Melvin&#x27;s compulsive need for routine and aversion to change is aggravated when Carol decides to work closer to her home in Brooklyn to be more accessible for her acutely asthmatic son, Spencer. Unable to adjust to a different waitress, Melvin arranges to pay for Spencer&#x27;s considerable medical expenses for at-home care―if Carol returns to the restaurant. While Carol is overwhelmed by Melvin’s generosity, thanking him profusely, she is suspicious of his motives, declaring emphatically that she will never have sex with him. A humiliated Melvin admonishes her that she, not he, has made the situation personal.

Meanwhile, Simon’s injuries, lack of medical insurance, and high medical bills cause him to go bankrupt and fall into depression. Frank persuades him to go to Baltimore to ask his estranged parents for money. Bullied by Frank, Melvin reluctantly agrees to take recuperating Simon to Baltimore. Frank lends Melvin his Saab 900 convertible for the trip. Irrationally fearing Simon may make a pass at him (his cover story), Melvin invites Carol along on the trip, reminding her that she owes him a favor, and she reluctantly accepts. Relationships develop among the three on the trip as Simon discusses the root of his estrangement with his parents, who cannot accept his homosexuality; Carol commiserates; and Melvin’s acerbic remarks gradually become more sympathetic.

Once in Baltimore, Carol persuades Melvin to take her out for dinner. Melvin&#x27;s conversation during the dinner initially flatters her—he tells her that her “no sex oath” made him start taking medication to become a better man. When Carol presses Melvin to admit that he invited her on the trip because he had feelings for her, however, an embarrassed and fumbling Melvin again clumsily deflects, awkwardly responding that he invited her along to maybe have sex with Simon to cure his homosexuality. Upset at the implication that her sexual favors are for sale, Carol abruptly leaves. She goes to Simon’s hotel room for consolation, and their emotional intimacy rekindles his creative desire to paint. He sketches Carol, nearly nude, making her feel her femininity appreciated in a nonsexual way. With confidence inspired by Carol, Simon briefly reconnects with his mother, without asking her for money, telling her that he will be fine.

After returning to New York, Carol tells Melvin that he disparages her and she does not want him in her life anymore. Since Simon is still broke and his apartment has been sublet, Melvin arranges for Simon to stay in his spare bedroom. On learning of Melvin’s enormous gesture and sign of growth, Carol regrets her harshness and calls Melvin to apologize. The relationship between Melvin and Carol remains complicated until Simon persuades Melvin to declare his love for her. Melvin goes to see Carol, who hesitantly agrees to try and establish a relationship with him. She is encouraged by her mother, who declares that no relationship is perfect. The film ends with Melvin and Carol walking together. As he opens the door at an early morning pastry shop for Carol, he realizes that he has stepped on a crack in the pavement, but does not seem to mind.

==Cast==
==Production==
In 1996, James L. Brooks flew Geoffrey Rush from Sydney to Los Angeles to audition for the part of Simon Bishop, and offered him the role, but Rush declined it. Betty White was offered a role in the film but she declined, due to a scene in the film where a dog is thrown into a trash chute. Tony Shalhoub vied for the role of Simon Bishop, which eventually went to Greg Kinnear.

Owen Wilson served as associate producer, one of his first jobs in Hollywood.

Jack Nicholson and Brooks clashed on set regarding Nicholson&#x27;s performance of Melvin, leading to a production halt for the two to find the correct tone for the character.

The paintings were created for the film by New York City artist Billy Sullivan.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack features instrumental pieces composed by Hans Zimmer and songs by various artists. Zimmer&#x27;s work was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score – Musical or Comedy.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;As Good as It Gets&quot; was a box office hit, opening at number three at the box office (behind &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;) with $12.6 million, and eventually earning over $148 million domestically and $314 million worldwide. It is Jack Nicholson&#x27;s second-highest-earning film, behind &quot;Batman&quot;.

=== Critical reception ===
&quot;Chicago Reader&quot; film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that what director James L. Brooks &quot;manages to do with [the characters] as they struggle mightily to connect with one another is funny, painful, beautiful, and basically truthful—a triumph for everyone involved.&quot;

Praise for the film was not uniform among critics. While Roger Ebert gave the film three stars (out of four), he called the film a &quot;compromise, a film that forces a smile onto material that doesn&#x27;t wear one easily,&quot; writing that the film drew &quot;back to story formulas,&quot; but had good dialogue and performances. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; critic Desson Howe gave a generally negative review of the film, writing that it &quot;gets bogged down in sentimentality, while its wheels spin futilely in life-solving overdrive.&quot;

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 86% of professional critics gave the film a positive review based on 85 reviews, with an average rating of 7.30/10. The consensus states that &quot;James L. Brooks and Jack Nicholson, doing what they do best, combine smart dialogue and flawless acting to squeeze fresh entertainment value out of the romantic-comedy genre.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 67 out of 100, based on reviews from 30 critics, indicating generally favorable reviews.

==Accolades==
== Home media ==
The film was released on VHS, LaserDisc and DVD on May 19, 1998 by Columbia TriStar Home Video. It was released on Blu-ray in the United States on June 12, 2012, as part of Twilight Time&#x27;s Screen Archives collection. The set was limited to 3,000 units and sold out quickly.

Sony Pictures released the film on 4K UHD Blu-ray on October 25, 2022, as part of its Columbia Classics 4K Ultra HD Collection Volume 3, along with &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, &quot;From Here To Eternity&quot;, &quot;To Sir, With Love&quot;, &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; and &quot;Annie&quot;.

<doc id="142450" wikidata="Q3510895" url="?curid=142450" title="Senate of the Roman Republic">
<text>The Senate was the governing and advisory assembly of the aristocracy in the ancient Roman Republic. It was not an elected body, but one whose members were appointed by the consuls, and later by the censors, which were appointed by the aristocratic Centuriate Assembly. After a Roman magistrate served his term in office, it usually was followed with automatic appointment to the Senate. According to the Greek historian Polybius, the principal source on the Constitution of the Roman Republic, the Roman Senate was the predominant branch of government. Polybius noted that it was the &quot;consuls&quot; (the highest-ranking of the regular magistrates) who led the armies and the civil government in Rome, and it was the &quot;Roman assemblies&quot; which had the ultimate authority over elections, legislation, and criminal trials. However, since the Senate controlled money, administration, and the details of foreign policy, it had the most control over day-to-day life. The power and authority of the Senate derived from precedent, the high caliber and prestige of the senators, and the Senate&#x27;s unbroken lineage, which dated back to the founding of the Republic in 509 BC. It developed from the Senate of the Roman Kingdom, and became the Senate of the Roman Empire.

Originally the chief magistrates, the &quot;consuls&quot;, appointed all new senators. They also had the power to remove individuals from the Senate. Around the year 318 BC, the &quot;Ovinian Plebiscite&quot; (&quot;plebiscitum Ovinium&quot;) gave this power to another Roman magistrate, the &quot;censor&quot;, who retained this power until the end of the Roman Republic. This law also required the censors to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the Senate. Thus, after this point in time, election to magisterial office resulted in automatic Senate membership. The appointment was for life, although the censor could impeach any senator.

The Senate directed the magistrates, especially the consuls, in their prosecution of military conflicts. The Senate also had an enormous degree of power over the civil government in Rome. This was especially the case with regard to its management of state finances, as only it could authorize the disbursal of public monies from the treasury. In addition, the Senate passed decrees called &quot;senatus consulta&quot;, which were official &quot;advice&quot; from the Senate to a magistrate. While technically these decrees did not have to be obeyed, in practice, they usually were. During an emergency, the Senate (and only the Senate) could authorize the appointment of a &quot;dictator&quot;. The last ordinary dictator, however, was appointed in 202 BC. After 202 BC, the Senate responded to emergencies by passing the &quot;senatus consultum ultimum&quot; (&quot;Ultimate Decree of the Senate&quot;), which suspended civil government and declared something analogous to martial law.

==Institution==

==Venue and ethical standards==
The rules and procedures of the Roman Senate were both complex and ancient. Many of these rules and procedures originated in the early years of the Republic, and were upheld over the centuries under the principle of &quot;mos maiorum&quot; (&quot;customs of the ancestors&quot;). While Senate meetings could take place either inside or outside of the formal boundary of the city (the &quot;pomerium&quot;), no meeting could take place more than a mile outside of the &quot;pomerium&quot;. Senate meetings might take place outside of the formal boundary of the city for several reasons. For example, the Senate might wish to meet with an individual, such as a foreign ambassador, whom they did not wish to allow inside the city.

At the beginning of the year, the first Senate meeting always took place at the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. Other venues could include the Temple of Fides or the Temple of Concord, or, if the meeting was outside of the formal boundary of the city, at the Temple of Apollo or (if a war meeting) at the Temple of Bellona. In addition, the Senate operated while under various religious restrictions. For example, before any meeting could begin, a sacrifice to the gods was made, and a search for divine omens (the &quot;auspices&quot;) was taken. The auspices were taken in order to determine whether that particular Senate meeting held favor with the gods. The Senate was only allowed to meet in a building of religious significance, such as the Curia Hostilia.

The ethical requirements of senators were significant. Senators could not engage in banking or any form of public contract without legal approval. They could not own a ship that was large enough to participate in foreign commerce without legal approval, and they could not leave Italy without permission from the Senate. In addition, since they were not paid, individuals usually sought to become a senator only if they were independently wealthy.

The &quot;censors&quot; were the magistrates who enforced the ethical standards of the Senate. Whenever a censor punished a senator, they had to allege some specific failing. Possible reasons for punishing a member included corruption, abuse of capital punishment, or the disregard of a colleague&#x27;s veto, constitutional precedent, or the auspices. Senators who failed to obey various laws could also be punished. While punishment could include impeachment (expulsion) from the Senate, often a punishment was less severe than outright expulsion. While the standard was high for expelling a member from the Senate, it was easier to deny a citizen the right to join the Senate. Various moral failings could result in one not being allowed to join the Senate, including bankruptcy, prostitution, or a prior history of having been a gladiator. One law (the &quot;Lex repetundarum&quot; of 123 BC) made it illegal for a citizen to become a senator if they had been convicted of a criminal offense. Many of these laws were enacted in the last century of the Republic, as public corruption began reaching unprecedented levels.

==Debates==
Meetings usually began at dawn, although occasionally certain events (such as festivals) might delay the beginning of a meeting. A magistrate who wished to summon the Senate had to issue a compulsory order (a &quot;cogere&quot;), and senators could be punished if they failed to appear without reasonable cause. In 44 BC for example, consul Mark Antony threatened to demolish the house of the former consul Cicero for this very reason. The Senate meetings were technically public because the doors were usually left open, which allowed people to look in, but only senators could speak. The Senate was directed by a presiding magistrate, who was usually either a &quot;consul&quot; (the highest-ranking magistrate) or, if the consul was unavailable, a &quot;Praetor&quot; (the second-highest ranking magistrate), usually the urban praetor. By the late Republic, another type of magistrate, a &quot;plebeian tribune&quot;, would sometimes preside.

While in session, the Senate had the power to act on its own, and even against the will of the presiding magistrate if it wished. The presiding magistrate began each meeting with a speech (the &quot;verba fecit&quot;), which was usually brief, but was sometimes a lengthy oration. The presiding magistrate would then begin a discussion by referring an issue to the senators, who would discuss the issue, one at a time, by order of seniority, with the first to speak, the most senior senator, known as the &quot;princeps senatus&quot; (leader of the Senate), who was then followed by ex-consuls (&quot;consulares&quot;), and then the praetors and ex-praetors (&quot;praetorii&quot;). This continued, until the most junior senators had spoken. Senators who had held magisterial office always spoke before those who had not, and if a &quot;patrician&quot; was of equal seniority as a &quot;plebeian&quot;, the patrician would always speak first.

A senator could make a brief statement, discuss the matter in detail, or talk about an unrelated topic. All senators had to speak before a vote could be held, and since all meetings had to end by nightfall, a senator could talk a proposal to death (a filibuster or &quot;diem consumere&quot;) if they could keep the debate going until nightfall. It is known, for example, that the senator Cato the Younger once filibustered in an attempt to prevent the Senate from granting Julius Caesar a law that would have given land to the veterans of Pompey.

==Delaying and obstructive tactics==
Senators had several ways in which they could influence (or frustrate) a presiding magistrate. When a presiding magistrate was proposing a motion, for example, the senators could call &quot;consult&quot; (&quot;consule&quot;), which required the magistrate to ask for the opinions of the senators. Any senator could demand a quorum call (with the cry of &quot;numera&quot;), which required a count of the senators present. Like modern quorum calls, this was usually a delaying tactic. Senators could also demand that a motion be divided into smaller motions. Acts such as applause, booing, or heckling often played a major role in a debate, and, in part because all senators had an absolute right to free speech, any senator could respond at any point if he was attacked personally. Once debates were underway, they were usually difficult for the presiding magistrate to control. The presiding magistrate typically only regained some control once the debating had ended, and a vote was about to be taken.

In the later years of the Republic, attempts were made by the aristocracy to limit the increasing level of chaos associated with the obstructive tendencies and democratic impulses of some of the senators. Laws were enacted to prevent the inclusion of extraneous material in bills before the Senate. Other laws were enacted to outlaw the so-called omnibus bills, which are bills, usually enacted by a single vote, that contain a large volume of often unrelated material.

Laws were also enacted to strengthen the requirement that three days pass between the proposal of a bill, and the vote on that bill. During his term as dictator, Julius Caesar enacted laws that required the publication of Senate resolutions. This publication, called the &quot;acta diurna&quot;, or &quot;daily proceedings&quot;, was meant to increase transparency and minimize the potential for abuse. This publication was posted in the Roman Forum, and then sent by messengers throughout the provinces.

==Votes and the Tribune&#x27;s vote==

When it was time to call a vote, the presiding magistrate could bring up whatever proposals (in whatever order) he wished, and every vote was between a proposal and its negative. Quorums were required for votes to be held, and it is known that in 67 BC the size of a quorum was set at 200 senators (by the &quot;lex Cornelia de privilegiis&quot;). At any point before a motion passed, the proposed motion could be vetoed. Usually, vetoes were handed down by plebeian tribunes. If the Senate proposed a bill that the &quot;plebeian tribune&quot; (the magistrate who was the chief representative of the people) did not agree with, he issued a veto, which was backed by the promise to literally &quot;interpose the sacrosanctity of his person&quot; (or &quot;intercessio&quot;) if the Senate did not comply. If the Senate did not comply, he could physically prevent the Senate from acting, and any resistance could be criminally prosecuted as constituting a violation of his sacrosanctity. If the vetoed motion was proposed the next day, and the plebeian tribune who had vetoed it the day before was not present to interpose himself, the motion could be passed. In general, the plebeian tribune had to physically be present at the Senate meeting, otherwise his physical threat of interposing his person had no meaning. Ultimately, the plebeian tribune&#x27;s veto was based in a promise of physical force.

Once a vote occurred, and a measure passed, he could do nothing, since his promise to physically interpose his person against the senators was now meaningless. In addition, during a couple of instances between the end of the Second Punic War in 201 BC and the beginning of the Social War in 91 BC, although they had no legal power to do so, several Consuls were known to have vetoed acts of the Senate. Ultimately, if there was no veto, and the matter was of minor importance, it could be voted on by a voice vote or by a show of hands. If there was no veto, and the matter was of a significant nature, there was usually a physical division of the house, where senators voted by taking a place on either side of the chamber.

Any motion that had the support of the Senate but was vetoed was recorded in the annals as a &quot;senatus auctoritas&quot;, while any motion that was passed and not vetoed was recorded as a &quot;senatus consultum&quot;. After the vote, each &quot;senatus consultum&quot; and each &quot;senatus auctoritas&quot; was transcribed into a final document by the presiding magistrate. This document included the name of the presiding magistrate, the place of the assembly, the dates involved, the number of senators who were present at time the motion was passed, the names of witnesses to the drafting of the motion, and the substance of the act. In addition, if the motion was a &quot;senatus consultum&quot;, a capital letter &quot;C&quot; was stamped on the document, to verify that the motion had been approved by the Senate.

The document was then deposited in the temple that housed the Treasury (the &quot;aerarium&quot;). While a &quot;senatus auctoritas&quot; (vetoed Senate motion) had no legal value, it did serve to show the opinion of the Senate. If a &quot;senatus consultum&quot; conflicted with a law (&quot;lex&quot;) that was passed by a Roman Assembly, the law overrode the &quot;senatus consultum&quot;, because the &quot;senatus consultum&quot; had its authority based in precedent, and not in law. A &quot;senatus consultum&quot;, however, could serve to interpret a law.

<text>The Full Monty is a 1997 British comedy film directed by Peter Cattaneo, starring Robert Carlyle, Mark Addy, William Snape, Steve Huison, Tom Wilkinson, Paul Barber and Hugo Speer. The screenplay was written by Simon Beaufoy. The film is set in Sheffield in the North of England during the 1990s, and tells the story of six unemployed men, four of them former steel workers, who decide to form a male striptease act (à la Chippendale dancers) in order to make some money and for the main character, Gaz, to be able to see his son. Gaz declares that their show will be much better than the renowned Chippendales dancers because they will go &quot;the full monty&quot;—strip all the way—hence the film&#x27;s title.

Despite being a comedy, the film also touches on serious subjects such as unemployment, fathers&#x27; rights, depression, impotence, homosexuality, body image, working class culture and suicide. &quot;The Full Monty&quot; was a major critical success upon release and an international commercial success, grossing over $250 million from a budget of only $3.5 million. It was the highest-grossing film in the UK until it was outsold by &quot;Titanic&quot;. It won the BAFTA Award and European Film Award for Best Film, and was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Original Musical or Comedy Score, winning the last.

The British Film Institute ranked &quot;The Full Monty&quot; the 25th best British film of the 20th century. The film was adapted into a musical in 2000, a play in 2013 and a television series. A follow-up TV series to the original 1997 film, filmed in and around Sheffield and Manchester in 2022 and early 2023, was released on 14 June 2023 on Disney+ in the UK and Hulu in the US.

==Plot==
In the mid-1990s, the once-successful steel mills of Sheffield, South Yorkshire have shut down and most of the workers have been made redundant. Former steelworkers Gary &quot;Gaz&quot; Schofield and Dave Horsfall have resorted to stealing scrap metal from the abandoned mills to sell in order to make some cash, taking Gaz&#x27;s son Nathan with them for assistance, but a security guard keeps surprising them and locking them inside the steel mill.

Gaz is facing trouble from his former wife Mandy and her boyfriend Barry over child support payments that he has been unable to pay since losing his job. Nathan lives with Mandy and Barry but Gaz has joint custody of him with Mandy. Nathan wishes he and his father Gaz could do more &quot;normal stuff&quot; together. Mandy is seeking a court ruling giving her sole custody of Nathan, whom Gaz loves dearly. Gaz is desperate for money and for Nathan&#x27;s love.

One day, Gaz spots a crowd of women lined up outside a local club to see a Chippendales&#x27; striptease act, and is inspired to form his own striptease group using local men, hoping to make enough money to pay off his child support obligations. The first to join the group is Lomper, a security guard at the steel mill where Dave and Gaz once worked, whose suicide attempt they interrupt. Next, they recruit Gerald Cooper, their former foreman, who is hiding his unemployment from his wife. Gaz and Dave see Gerald and his wife, Linda, at a dance class, and recruit him to teach them some actual dance moves.

Looking for more recruits, the four men hold an open audition and settle on Horse, an older man who is nevertheless a good dancer, and Guy, who can&#x27;t dance at all but proves to be unusually well-endowed. The six men begin to practise their act. Gaz then learns that he has to pay a £100 deposit in order to secure the club for the night. He cannot afford this, but Nathan gets the money out of his savings, saying he trusts Gaz to repay him. When they are greeted by two local women while putting up posters for the show, Gaz boasts that they are better than the real Chippendales because they go &quot;the full monty&quot;. Dave, struggling with his body image, drops out and finds a job as a security guard at Asda. The others publicly rehearse at the mill for some female relatives of Horse, but a passing policeman catches them mid-show, and Gaz, Gerald and Horse are arrested for indecent exposure, costing Gaz the right to see Nathan. Lomper and Guy manage to escape to Lomper&#x27;s house, where they look lovingly at each other, starting a relationship.

Gerald is thrown out by Linda after bailiffs arrive at their house and seize their belongings to pay Gerald&#x27;s debts, resulting in him having to stay with Gaz. Later Gaz goes to Asda and asks Dave if he could &quot;borrow&quot; a jacket for Lomper&#x27;s mother&#x27;s funeral. Dave agrees and also decides to quit his security job. They steal two suit jackets and go to the funeral together.

Soon, the group find the act and their arrest has popularised them. They agree to forgo the plan, until Gaz learns that the show is sold out. He convinces the others to do it just for one night only. Gerald is unsure as he has now got the job that Gaz and Dave earlier tried to sabotage his interview for, but agrees to do it just once. Initially Dave still refuses, but regains his confidence after encouragement from his wife, Jean, and joins the rest of the group minutes before they go on stage. Nathan also arrives with Dave, having secretly come along, and tells Gaz that Mandy is there, but she would not let Barry go with her.

Gaz refuses to do the act because there are men in the audience (including the police officers who watched the footage of the security camera&#x27;s recording of them earlier), when the posters were supposed to say it was for women only. The other five are starting the act when Nathan orders his father to go out on stage. Gaz, proud of his son, joins the others and performs in front of the audience and Mandy, who seems to see him in a new light. The film finishes with the group performing on stage in front of an enthusiastic packed house, stripping to Tom Jones&#x27;s version of &quot;You Can Leave Your Hat On&quot; (their hats being the final item removed) with astounding success.

==Production==
Channel 4 Films paid for the screenplay to be written but then declined to invest any equity in the film. Fox Searchlight ended up financing it for almost £3 million.

The famous &quot;Hot Stuff&quot; scene, in which the characters dance in the queue at the Jobcentre, was originally going to be cut from the final production as it was considered &quot;too unrealistic&quot;.

The cast allegedly agreed that all six of them would really do the &quot;full monty&quot; strip at the end in front of 50 extras, provided they had to do only one take. Hugo Speer told &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2019: &quot;The climactic scene was nuts. It was in a very cold working men&#x27;s club, starting at about midday. The makeup and costume girls knew how we were feeling, so they were thrusting glasses of alcohol into our hands between takes. The extras had smuggled in booze, too. They weren&#x27;t aware we were going to go all the way – that was a bit of smarts on the producers&#x27; part, so it was a completely natural reaction they got at the end.&quot;

The production and shooting was also said to be very challenging, with Robert Carlyle saying: &quot;&quot;The Full Monty&quot; was a tough shoot, it really really was. Horrible.&quot;

===Locations===
The film was shot entirely on location in and around Sheffield in April 1996, except for a couple of locations in Shirebrook, Derbyshire.

===&quot;The Reel Monty&quot;===
The opening sequence of the Sheffield promotion film from 1972 is taken from &quot;City on the Move&quot;, a film commissioned by Peter Wigley, Sheffield&#x27;s first ever publicity officer, to convince people that Sheffield was a centre for tourism and commerce. &quot;City on the Move&quot; was produced and directed by Jim and Marie-Luise Coulthard and showed a modern thriving city that was rapidly developing thanks to the successful steel industry in Sheffield. However, the film went virtually unnoticed until the Coulthards were approached about some of the footage being included in &quot;The Full Monty&quot; for a payment of £400, which they accepted. In 2008, &quot;City on the Move&quot; was released on DVD under the new name &quot;The Reel Monty&quot;.

===Language===

The film features frequent use of British slang, and in particular Sheffielder dialect.

The film&#x27;s title is a phrase generally used in the United Kingdom to mean &quot;the whole lot&quot;, or &quot;the whole hog&quot;; in the film, the characters use it to refer to full nudity — as Horse says, &quot;No one said anything to me about the full monty!&quot; The phrase, whose origin is obscure (a possible meaning relates to a full 3-piece suit by the then popular high street tailor Montague Burton), gained a renewed prominence in British culture following the film.

Other dialect words are used in the film; some such as &quot;nesh&quot; (meaning a person unusually susceptible to cold) are widespread across the North Midlands region. &quot;Jennel&quot; (an alley) is local to Sheffield: it is a variation on the word &quot;ginnel&quot;, which is in full versions of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; and is used in many parts of England.

==Release==

===Critical reception===
The film surprised critics when it was first released, earning near-universal acclaim, and it went on to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

Writing in &quot;Time Out New York&quot; regarding the implications of the film Andrew Johnston stated: &quot;&quot;Monty&quot; is much less ribald than it sounds. The funniest moments are frequently the most subtle, like when five of the strippers, standing in the dole line, find themselves unable to resist dancing in place when Donna Summers&#x27;s &quot;Hot Stuff&quot; comes on the radio. There&#x27;s surprisingly little raunch, in part because the film can&#x27;t stop thinking of women as enemies of a sort (at least &quot;Monty&quot; is less offensive than &quot;Brassed Off&quot; in that department). And refreshingly, its definition of male bonding is broad enough to let two of the lads find love in each other&#x27;s arms.&quot;

Review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively reports that 96% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 55 reviews, with an average score of 7.50/10. The consensus reads, &quot;Cheeky and infectiously good-natured, &quot;The Full Monty&quot; bares its big beating heart with a sly dose of ribald comedy.&quot; On Metacritic, which assesses films with a score out of 100, the film has a score of 75 based on 31 critics&#x27; reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;The Full Monty&quot; opened on six screens in the United States on 13 August 1997 and grossed $244,375 in its first five days, with a per-screen average in its opening weekend of $29,430; the highest for a film that weekend. The film expanded to 10 screens the following weekend and then 36 screens for the Labor Day weekend (29 August – 1 September) where it remained the film with the highest per-screen average gross ($25,344) and grossed a total of $1.7 million in its first 20 days. When the film was released in the United Kingdom on 29 August 1997 on 224 screens, it grossed £1,593,928 in its first 3 days, ranking second at the UK box office behind &quot;Men in Black&quot;, which grossed £1.7 million in its fifth week of release from almost twice the number of screens (411). However, it beat &quot;Men in Black&quot; for the week and took the weekend crown the following weekend and remained number one at the UK box office for the next nine weeks, the longest a film had remained at number one in the UK. It became the highest-grossing British film of all-time in its ninth week of release, surpassing &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;. It was displaced as the weekend number one by &quot;Face/Off&quot; but remained the highest-grosser for the week and returned to spend the next two weekends back at number one. It was the highest-grossing film in the UK for thirteen consecutive weeks and eleven weekends. In the US, it expanded to 387 screens on 12 September and grossed $2.9 million for the weekend to finish in fifth place at the box office. It expanded further to 650 screens the following weekend where it retained its fifth place.

It also opened at number one in Australia where it remained for five weeks. In France, it opened at the same time as &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; and recorded a per screen average of $16,699 compared to the former&#x27;s $19,133, finishing in third place for the week. On 27 January 1998, it surpassed &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; to become the highest-grossing film in the UK and finished with a gross of £52.2 million ($85 million). In the United States and Canada it finished its run with a gross of $46 million. It grossed $127 million in other international markets for a worldwide gross of $258 million.

===Accolades and recognition===
&quot;The Full Monty&quot; won the BAFTA Award for Best Film in 1997, beating presumed frontrunners &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; and Carlyle won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. It was nominated for a total of four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Score and Best Original Screenplay.

In 1997, the Academy Award for Best Original Score was split up into two categories: Dramatic and Musical or Comedy. In light of 1997&#x27;s big winner, &quot;Titanic&quot;, the film won only the Oscar for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score by Anne Dudley, with the Best Picture and Best Director Oscars going to &quot;Titanic&quot; and its director James Cameron and the Best Original Screenplay Oscar going to Ben Affleck and Matt Damon for &quot;Good Will Hunting.&quot; The film was also nominated for the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics.

In 1999, it was ranked #25 on the BFI Top 100 British films list. In 2000, readers of &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine voted &quot;The Full Monty&quot; the 49th greatest comedy film of all time. By that year it earned an estimated £194 million at the box office worldwide.

===Controversy===
New Zealand playwrights Anthony McCarten and Stephen Sinclair filed a £180 million lawsuit against the producers of &quot;The Full Monty&quot; in 1998. They claim that the film blatantly infringed on their play, &quot;Ladies Night&quot;, which toured both Britain and New Zealand. Anthony McCarten and Stephen Sinclair created a website containing their play in response to statements from the producers of &quot;The Full Monty&quot; that claimed the two productions were not alike. The underlying rights were attributed to co-producer, Paul Bucknor, and the lawsuit was settled out of court; as part of the agreement, the website containing &quot;Ladies Night&quot; was shut down.

==Soundtrack==
Anne Dudley&#x27;s Oscar for Best Score was a surprise, and some critics felt undeserved, inasmuch as the award is for original music and most of the film&#x27;s memorable moments had jukebox favourites playing. Dudley composed &quot;about 20 minutes&#x27; worth of music&quot; for the film. Bob Strauss called the Oscar &quot;well-deserved&quot;, while Pauline Reay felt Dudley&#x27;s underscore complemented the familiar hits. Dudley described her score to Steven Poole:
:It was this conglomeration of sounds—baritone sax, acoustic guitar, harmonica [...] The reasoning was that all these six men are different, they come from different backgrounds, but in the final scene it all works. The idea was that the instruments should do that as well—they all come from different places but they actually gel...

The album The Full Monty: Music from the Motion Picture Soundtrack includes two original tracks by Dudley plus the pop hits, including a cover by Tom Jones of &quot;You Can Leave Your Hat On&quot; commissioned and produced by Dudley, who had collaborated with Jones on a 1988 cover of &quot;Kiss&quot;.

==Adaptations==

In 1998, the film was novelized by the British writer Wendy Holden.

The film was adapted into a 2000 Broadway musical of the same name; the characters and setting were Americanized. The musical ran in the West End at the Prince of Wales Theatre in 2002.

It was also adapted into a stage play by the original screenwriter Simon Beaufoy, which opened at the Lyceum Theatre, Sheffield on 2 February 2013, directed by Sheffield Theatres artistic director Daniel Evans, before embarking on a national tour. It opened in the West End at the Noël Coward Theatre on 25 February 2014.

However, despite positive reviews, the show closed on 29 March, rather than the planned 14 June, after a run of just over a month. A Portuguese-language version was adapted for theatrical performance in Brazil by Brazilian journalist Artur Xexéo. This version of the play was directed by Tadeu Aguiar, and debuted in Brazil on 6 October 2015.

In 2017, twenty years after the film&#x27;s release, an ITV Special titled &quot;The Real Full Monty&quot; was announced in order to raise awareness of prostate cancer and testicular cancer. It aired on 15 June 2017 and starred Alexander Armstrong, Ashley Banjo, Danny John-Jules, Dominic Littlewood, Elliott Wright, Harry Judd, Mark Foster, Matthew Wolfenden and Wayne Sleep. The show has returned each year since: &quot;The Real Full Monty&quot; and &quot;The Real Full Monty: Ladies&#x27; Night&quot; (2018), &quot;The All New Monty: Who Bares Wins&quot; (2019), &quot;The Real Full Monty on Ice&quot; (2020), &quot;Strictly The Real Full Monty&quot; (2021). Banjo has starred in every episode. A version of &quot;The Real Full Monty&quot; has been produced for Australian audiences, with the participants being Australian celebrities.

=== Television series ===

In 2023, FX on Hulu and Disney+ released a limited television series based on the film. The series is produced by Searchlight Television, FXP and Little Island Productions. Simon Beaufoy is credited as creator, writer and executive producer. The original cast members, including Carlyle, Wilkinson, and Addy, reprised their roles. On 2 July 2022, Speer was removed from the series due to inappropriate conduct claims. The series premiered on 14 June 2023.

<text>Good Will Hunting is a 1997 American drama film directed by Gus Van Sant and written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. It stars Robin Williams, Damon, Affleck, Stellan Skarsgård and Minnie Driver. The film tells the story of janitor Will Hunting, whose mathematical genius is discovered by a professor at MIT.

The film received acclaim from critics and grossed over $225 million during its theatrical run against a $10 million budget. At the 70th Academy Awards, it received nominations in nine categories, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won in two: Best Supporting Actor for Williams and Best Original Screenplay for Affleck and Damon. In 2014, it was ranked at number 53 in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s &quot;100 Favorite Films&quot; list.

==Plot==
Twenty-year-old Will Hunting of South Boston is a self-taught math genius who was recently paroled after completing a prison term. He works as a janitor at MIT, and spends his free time drinking with his friends Chuckie, Billy and Morgan.

When Professor Gerald Lambeau posts a difficult combinatorial mathematics problem on a blackboard as a challenge for his graduate students, Will solves the problem anonymously, stunning both the students and Lambeau. As a challenge to the unknown genius, Lambeau posts an even more difficult problem. He later catches Will writing the solution on the blackboard late at night, but initially thinks Will is vandalizing it and chases him off. At a bar, Will meets Skylar, an English woman about to graduate from Harvard College, who plans on attending medical school at Stanford.

Meanwhile, Lambeau, realizing Will was not vandalizing the problem but solving it, asks the campus maintenance staff his whereabouts, but is informed he did not turn up for work. Lambeau learns Will was placed at MIT by a parole program, and obtains his parole officer&#x27;s details.

Will and his friends start a fight with a gang that includes a member who used to bully Will as a child. Will is arrested after he attacks a responding police officer. Lambeau sits in on his court appearance and watches Will defend himself. He arranges for Will to avoid jail time if he agrees to study mathematics under Lambeau&#x27;s supervision and participate in psychotherapy sessions. Will agrees but treats his therapists with mockery.

In desperation, Lambeau calls on Dr. Sean Maguire, his college roommate, who now teaches psychology at Bunker Hill Community College. Unlike the other therapists, Sean actually challenges Will&#x27;s defense mechanisms. During the first session, Will insults his deceased wife, and Sean threatens him, but after a few unproductive sessions, Will finally begins to open up.

Will is particularly struck by Sean&#x27;s story of how he met his wife, who later died of cancer, by giving up his ticket to the historic game six of the 1975 World Series after falling in love at first sight. Sean&#x27;s explanation for surrendering his ticket was to &quot;see about a girl&quot;, and he does not regret his decision. This encourages Will to build a relationship with Skylar, though he lies to her about his past and is reluctant to introduce her to his friends or show her his home. Will also challenges Sean to take an objective look at his own life, since Sean cannot move on from his wife&#x27;s death.

Lambeau sets up a number of job interviews for Will, but he scorns them by sending Chuckie as his &quot;chief negotiator&quot;, and by turning down a position at the NSA with a scathing critique of the agency&#x27;s moral position. Skylar asks Will to move to California with her, but he refuses and tells her he is an orphan, and that his foster father physically abused him.

Will breaks up with Skylar and later storms out on Lambeau, dismissing the mathematical research he has been doing. Sean points out to Will that he is so adept at anticipating future failure in his interpersonal relationships that he deliberately sabotages them to avoid emotional pain. Chuckie likewise challenges Will over his resistance to taking any of the positions he interviews for, telling him he owes it to his friends to make the most of opportunities they will never have, even if it means leaving one day. He then tells Will that the best part of his day is the brief moment when he waits at his doorstep, thinking Will has moved on to something greater.

Will walks in on a heated argument between Sean and Lambeau over Will&#x27;s potential. Lambeau leaves, and Sean and Will talk and it comes to light that they were both victims of child abuse. Sean helps him see that he is a victim of his own inner demons and to accept that the abuse he received was not his fault by repeatedly stating, &quot;It&#x27;s not your fault&quot;, causing him to break down in tears in Sean&#x27;s arms. Will accepts one of the job offers arranged by Lambeau. Having helped Will manage his problems, Sean reconciles with Lambeau, deciding to take a sabbatical.

Will&#x27;s friends give him a used car for his 21st birthday so he can commute to work. Later, Chuckie goes to Will&#x27;s to pick him up, only to find that he is not there, much to his happiness, as Will had finally done what Chuckie had been wishing for all these years. Will leaves a note for Sean asking him to tell Lambeau that he had to go &quot;see about a girl&quot;, revealing he passed on the job offer and instead is heading to California to reunite with Skylar.

==Production==
===Development===
Matt Damon started writing the film as a final assignment for a playwriting class that he was taking at Harvard University. Instead of writing a one-act play, Damon submitted a 40-page script. He wrote into his script his then-girlfriend, medical student Skylar Satenstein (credited in the closing credits of the film). Damon said that the only scene from that script to survive verbatim was when Will (Damon) meets his therapist, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), for the first time. Damon asked Ben Affleck to develop the screenplay with him. They completed the script in 1994. At first, it was written as a thriller about a young man in the rough-and-tumble streets of South Boston who possesses a superior intelligence and is targeted by the government with heavy-handed recruitment.

Castle Rock Entertainment bought the script for $675,000 against $775,000, meaning that Damon and Affleck would earn an additional $100,000 if the film was produced, and they retained sole writing credit. Castle Rock Entertainment president Rob Reiner urged them to drop the thriller aspect of the story and to focus on the relationship between Will and his therapist. Terrence Malick told Affleck and Damon over dinner that the film ought to end with Will&#x27;s decision to follow his girlfriend Skylar to California, not them leaving together.

At Reiner&#x27;s request, screenwriter William Goldman read the script. Goldman consistently denied the persistent rumor that he wrote &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; or acted as a script doctor. In his book &quot;Which Lie Did I Tell?&quot;, Goldman jokingly writes, &quot;I did not just doctor it. I wrote the whole thing from scratch,&quot; before dismissing the rumor as false and saying that his only advice was agreeing with Reiner&#x27;s suggestion.

Affleck and Damon proposed to act in the lead roles, but many studio executives said that they wanted Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio. Meanwhile, Kevin Smith was working with Affleck on &quot;Mallrats&quot;, and with both Damon and Affleck on &quot;Chasing Amy.&quot; Castle Rock Entertainment put the script in turnaround and gave Damon and Affleck 30 days to find another buyer for the script who would reimburse Castle Rock Entertainment the money paid; otherwise the script would be reverted to Castle Rock Entertainment, and Damon and Affleck would be out. All of the studios that were involved in the original bidding war for the screenplay turned the pair down, taking meetings with Affleck and Damon only to tell them this to their face.

As a last resort, Affleck passed the script to his &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; director Kevin Smith, who read it and promised to walk the script directly into Harvey Weinstein&#x27;s office at Miramax Films. Weinstein read the script, loved it, and paid Castle Rock Entertainment their due, while also agreeing to let Damon and Affleck star in the film. Weinstein asked that a few scenes be removed, including an out-of-place, mid-script oral sex scene that Damon and Affleck added to trick executives who were not looking closely.

After buying the rights from Castle Rock Entertainment, Miramax Films put the film into production. Several well-known filmmakers were originally considered to direct, including Mel Gibson and Michael Mann. Originally, Affleck asked Kevin Smith whether he was interested in directing. He declined, saying that they needed a &quot;good director&quot;, that he directed only projects that he wrote, and that he was not much of a visual director, but he still served as one of the film&#x27;s co-executive producers. Damon and Affleck chose Gus Van Sant, whose work on previous films, like &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot;, had left a favorable impression on the fledgling screenwriters. Miramax Films was persuaded and hired Van Sant to direct the film.

===Filming===

Filming took place between April and June 1997. Although the story is set in Boston, and many of the scenes were shot on location in the Greater Boston area, many of the interior shots were filmed at locations in Toronto, with the University of Toronto standing in for MIT and Harvard University. The classroom scenes were filmed at McLennan Physical Laboratories (of the University of Toronto) and Central Technical School. Harvard normally disallows filming on its property, but permitted limited filming by the project after intervention by Harvard alumnus John Lithgow. Likewise, only the exterior shots of Bunker Hill Community College were filmed in Boston; however, Sean&#x27;s office was built in Toronto as an exact replica of one at the college.

The interior bar scenes set in &quot;Southie&quot; were shot on location at Woody&#x27;s L Street Tavern. Meanwhile, the homes of Will (190 West 6th Street) and Sean (259 E Street), although portrayed as some distance apart in the film, are actually next door to each other on Bowen Street, the narrow street that Chuckie drives on to walk up to Will&#x27;s back door.

The Bow and Arrow Pub, which was located at the corner of Bow Street and Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge, doubled as the exterior of the Harvard bar in which Will meets Skylar for the first time. The Baskin-Robbins/Dunkin&#x27; Donuts featured in the &quot;How do you like &quot;them&quot; apples?&quot; scene was next door to the pub at the time of the film&#x27;s release. The Harvard Bar interior scenes were filmed at the Upfront Bar and Grill on Front St. E. in Toronto.

The Tasty, at the corner of JFK and Brattle Streets, was the scene of Will and Skylar&#x27;s first kiss. The Au Bon Pain, where Will and Skylar discuss the former&#x27;s photographic memory, was at the corner of Dunster Street and Mass Ave.

The Boston Public Garden bench on which Will and Sean sat for a scene in the film became a temporary shrine after Williams&#x27;s death in 2014.

The film&#x27;s end-credits roll over a since-famous, continuous shot of the car Hunting is driving to California, with the songs &quot;Miss Misery&quot; and &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot; playing on the soundtrack. It was shot on a stretch of the Massachusetts Turnpike. The car eventually disappears down the road after passing under the bridge carrying the West Stockbridge Road.

==Soundtrack==

The musical score for &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; was composed by Danny Elfman, who had previously collaborated with Gus Van Sant on &quot;To Die For&quot; and would go on to score many of Van Sant&#x27;s other films. The film also features many songs written and recorded by singer-songwriter Elliott Smith. His song &quot;Miss Misery&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song but lost to &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; from &quot;Titanic&quot;. Elfman&#x27;s score was also nominated for an Oscar but lost to &quot;Titanic&quot; as well. On September 11, 2006, &quot;The Today Show&quot; used Elfman&#x27;s song &quot;Weepy Donuts&quot; while Matt Lauer spoke during the opening credits.

A soundtrack album for the film was released by Capitol Records on November 18, 1997, although only two of Elfman&#x27;s cues appear on the release.

&quot;Afternoon Delight&quot; by the Starland Vocal Band was featured in the film but did not appear on the soundtrack album.

A limited-edition soundtrack album featuring Elfman&#x27;s complete score from the film was released by Music Box Records on March 3, 2014. The soundtrack, issued in 1500 copies, includes all of Elfman&#x27;s cues (including music not featured on the rare Miramax Academy promo) and contains the songs by Elliott Smith. One of the tracks is Smith&#x27;s songs with Elfman&#x27;s arrangements added to the mix.

==Mathematics==
In an early version of the script, Will Hunting was going to be a physics prodigy, but Nobel Laureate in Physics Sheldon Glashow at Harvard told Damon that the subject should be math instead of physics. Glashow referred Damon to his brother-in-law, Daniel Kleitman, a mathematics professor at MIT. Columbia University physics and math professor Brian Greene at the Tribeca Sloan retrospectively explained that for physics, &quot;Having some deep insight about the universe [⁠ ⁠.⁠ ⁠.⁠ ⁠.⁠ ⁠] typically [⁠ ⁠is ⁠] a group project in the modern era&quot;, while &quot;doing some mathematical theorem is a singular undertaking very often&quot;. Patrick O&#x27;Donnell, professor of physics at the University of Toronto, served as the mathematical consultant for the film. In the spring of 1997, Damon and Affleck asked Kleitman to &quot;speak math to us&quot; for writing realistic dialogue, so Kleitman invited postdoc Tom Bohman to join him, giving them a &quot;quick lecture&quot;. When asked for a problem that Will could solve, Kleitman and Bohman suggested the unsolved computer science P versus NP problem, but the film used other problems. The plot was inspired by George Dantzig&#x27;s real life story.

The main hallway blackboard is used twice to reveal Will&#x27;s talent, first to the audience, and second to Professor Lambeau. Damon based it on his artist brother Kyle visiting MIT&#x27;s Infinite Corridor and writing &quot;an incredibly elaborate, totally fake, version of an equation&quot; on a blackboard, which lasted for months. Kyle returned to Matt, saying that MIT needed those blackboards &quot;because these kids are so smart they just need to, you know, drop everything and solve problems!&quot;.

===The first blackboard problem===
Near the start of the film, Will sets aside his mop to study a difficult problem posed by Lambeau on the blackboard. The problem has to do with intermediate-level graph theory, but Lambeau describes it as an advanced &quot;Fourier system&quot;.

To answer the first part of the question, Will chalks up an adjacency matrix:
:formula_1 
To answer the second part, he determines the number of 3-step walks in the graph, and finds the third power matrix:
:formula_2
The third and fourth parts of the question concern generating functions. The other characters are astounded that a janitor shows such facility with matrices.

===The second blackboard problem===
Lambeau subsequently poses a new challenge on the blackboard: state Cayley&#x27;s formula and &quot;draw all the homeomorphically irreducible trees with formula_3&quot;. Will writes eight of the ten trees correctly before Lambeau interrupts.

==Reception==
===Box office===
In the film&#x27;s opening weekend in limited release, it grossed $272,912. When it opened nationwide in January 1998, it grossed $10,261,471 for the weekend. It went on to gross $138,433,435 in the United States and Canada, surpassing &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; as Miramax&#x27;s highest grossing film in that market at the time. It grossed $225,933,435 worldwide.

===Critical response===
&quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; received widespread acclaim from critics. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97%, based on 91 reviews, with an average rating of 8.10/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;It follows a predictable narrative arc, but &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; adds enough quirks to the journey – and is loaded with enough powerful performances – that it remains an entertaining, emotionally rich drama.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four, writing that while the story is &quot;predictable&quot;, it is &quot;the individual moments, not the payoff, that make it so effective&quot;.

Duane Byrge of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised the performances of the cast, writing, &quot;The acting is brilliant overall, with special praise to Matt Damon for his ragingly tender portrayal of the boy cursed with genius.&quot;

Peter Stack of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; was equally positive, writing, &quot;The glow goes well beyond a radiant performance by Matt Damon ... Intimate, heartfelt and wickedly funny, it&#x27;s a movie whose impact lingers.&quot;

Owen Gleiberman, writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, gave the film a &quot;B&quot;, stating, &quot;&quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; is stuffed – indeed, overstuffed – with heart, soul, audacity, and blarney. You may not believe a minute of it, but you don&#x27;t necessarily want to stop watching.&quot; He also noted Damon&#x27;s and Williams&#x27;s chemistry, describing it as &quot;a quicksilver intercepting each other&#x27;s thoughts&quot;.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the screenplay &quot;smart and touching&quot;, and praised Van Sant for directing with &quot;style, shrewdness and clarity&quot;. She also complimented the production design and cinematography, which were able to effortlessly move the viewer from &quot;classroom to dorm room to neighborhood bar&quot;, in a small setting.

Quentin Curtis of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; opined that Williams&#x27;s performance brought &quot;sharpness and tenderness&quot;, calling the film a &quot;crowd-pleaser, with bags of charm to spare. It doesn&#x27;t bear thinking too much about its message ... Damon and Affleck&#x27;s writing has real wit and vigour, and some depth.&quot;

Andrew O&#x27;Hehir of &quot;Salon&quot; stated that despite the &quot;enjoyable characters&quot;, he thought that the film was somewhat superficial, writing, &quot;there isn&#x27;t a whole lot of movie to take home with you ... many will wake the next morning wondering why, with all that talent on hand, it amounts to so little in the end.&quot;

Writing for the BBC, Nev Pierce gave the film four stars out of five, describing it as &quot;touching, without being sentimental&quot;, although he felt that some scenes were &quot;odd lapses into self-help speak&quot;.

Emanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film a &quot;beautifully realized tale ... engaging and often quite touching&quot;. He felt that the film&#x27;s visual style showcased Van Sant&#x27;s talent, but the plot was &quot;quite predictable&quot;.

===Academic response===
Several scholars have examined the role of class, religion and the cultural geography of Boston in the film. Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera observed that the residual Catholic–Protestant tensions in Boston are an important backdrop in the film, as Irish Catholics from Southie are aligned against ostensibly Protestant characters who are affiliated with Harvard and MIT. Emmett Winn has argued that character interactions show class conflict and stunted social mobility, while, similarly, David Lipset commented that class inequality is a driving subtext.

<doc id="142457" wikidata="Q339876" url="?curid=142457" title="L.A. Confidential (film)">
<text>L.A. Confidential is a 1997 American neo-noir crime thriller film directed, produced, and co-written by Curtis Hanson. The screenplay by Hanson and Brian Helgeland is based on James Ellroy&#x27;s 1990 novel, the third book in his &quot;L.A. Quartet&quot; series. The film tells the story of a group of LAPD officers in 1953, and the intersection of police corruption and Hollywood celebrity. The title refers to the 1950s scandal magazine &quot;Confidential&quot;, portrayed in the film as &quot;Hush-Hush&quot;.

At the time, actors Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe were relatively unknown in North America. One of the film&#x27;s backers, Peter Dennett, was worried about the lack of established stars in the lead roles, but supported Hanson&#x27;s casting decisions, and Hanson had the confidence also to recruit Kevin Spacey, Kim Basinger, and Danny DeVito.

&quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; was a critical and commercial success. It grossed $126 million against a $35 million budget and received critical acclaim for the acting, writing, directing, editing, and Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s musical score. It was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning two: Best Supporting Actress (Basinger) and Best Adapted Screenplay; &quot;Titanic&quot; won in every other category for which &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; was nominated. In 2015, the Library of Congress selected &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1953, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) aims to improve its public image following decades of corruption. Career-focused sergeant Edmund Exley lives in the shadow of his legendary detective father, whose murderer was never identified; Exley names the suspect &quot;Rollo Tomasi,” representing any criminal who escapes justice. Fame-seeking narcotics sergeant Jack Vincennes collaborates with tabloid journalist Sid Hudgens to perform high-profile celebrity arrests, and volatile officer Wendell White uses violence to interrogate and intimidate suspects, particularly women-abusers, because his father murdered his mother.

On Christmas Eve, White encounters high-class prostitutes Lynn Bracken and Susan Lefferts, and former officer Leland Meeks. They work for Pierce Patchett, a millionaire businessman operating &quot;Fleur-de-Lis&quot;, a clandestine prostitution ring hosting women surgically altered to resemble film stars. White begins a relationship with Bracken. Following the &quot;Bloody Christmas&quot; scandal—involving drunken officers beating inmates—Exley is promoted to detective lieutenant after persuading his superiors to save the department&#x27;s reputation by only prosecuting securely pensioned officers. Exley coerces Vincennes to testify, while White refuses to comply and is suspended. White&#x27;s partner Dick Stensland is fired for his involvement, making other officers hostile towards Exley. Following the imprisonment of powerful gangster Mickey Cohen, police captain Dudley Smith recruits White to frighten off criminals attempting to take Cohen&#x27;s place. A spate of murders targeting Cohen&#x27;s underlings leads to the disappearance of of his heroin.

Exley investigates a massacre at the Nite Owl coffee house, with Stensland and Lefferts among the victims. Three African American felons are arrested for the crime, and interrogation reveals the men have been raping a captive woman. White rushes to free the woman and executes her captor, planting evidence to suggest he acted in self-defense. The African-Americans escape the station and are killed by Exley in the ensuing shootout, closing the case and earning him a medal for bravery. However, unable to ignore inconsistencies in the case, Exley and White continue the investigation independently. White interviews Lefferts&#x27;s mother and discovers Meeks&#x27;s body beneath her house. He interrogates Cohen&#x27;s ex-bodyguard, Johnny Stompanato, who reveals Meeks was trying to sell the stolen heroin.

Hudgens and Vincennes orchestrate a homosexual tryst between struggling actor Matt Reynolds and district attorney Ellis Loew to create blackmail photos. However, after Reynolds is found murdered, a guilt-ridden Vincennes joins Exley&#x27;s investigation. Vincennes learns that Meeks and Stensland formerly worked together under Smith, and dropped an investigation into Patchett and Hudgens blackmailing prominent businessmen with photos of their illicit trysts. He then confronts Smith, who shoots him dead. With his last breath, Vincennes says &quot;Rollo Tomasi.&quot;

Exley becomes suspicious when Smith asks him about &quot;Rollo Tomasi&quot;, a name Exley disclosed only to Vincennes. Smith arranges for White to find photos taken by Hudgens of Bracken having sex with Exley. Enraged, White confronts and fights Exley until they realize that their investigations implicate Smith. They deduce that Stensland killed Meeks for the heroin, and Smith orchestrated the Nite Owl massacre to kill Stensland and framed the African-Americans. Exley and White interrogate Loew, discovering Smith and Patchett are taking over Cohen&#x27;s empire and used the photos of him with Reynolds to coerce his cooperation. Exley and White later find Hudgens and Patchett murdered.

Smith lures Exley and White into a remote ambush. Though badly wounded, the pair kill Smith&#x27;s men. Smith offers to mislead the approaching police and further promote Exley, but Exley executes him to prevent him avoiding punishment. Despite Exley&#x27;s evidence, LAPD officials decide to protect the department&#x27;s image by claiming Smith died a hero; Exley agrees to cooperate as a second &quot;hero&quot; for further accolades. Outside city hall, Exley says goodbye to Bracken and White before they leave for Arizona.

===Development===
Curtis Hanson had read half a dozen of James Ellroy&#x27;s books before &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; and was drawn to its characters, not the plot. He said, &quot;What hooked me on them was that, as I met them, one after the other, I didn&#x27;t like them—but as I continued reading, I started to care about them.&quot; Ellroy&#x27;s novel also made Hanson think about Los Angeles and provided him with an opportunity to &quot;set a movie at a point in time when the whole dream of Los Angeles, from that apparently golden era of the &#x27;20s and &#x27;30s, was being bulldozed.&quot;

Screenwriter Brian Helgeland was originally signed to Warner Bros. to write a Viking film with director Uli Edel and then worked on an unproduced modern-day King Arthur story. Helgeland was a longtime fan of Ellroy&#x27;s novels. When he heard that Warner Bros. had acquired the rights to &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; in 1990, he lobbied to script the film, but the studio was then talking only to well-known screenwriters. When he finally got a meeting, it was canceled two days before it was to occur.

Helgeland found that Hanson had been hired to direct and met with him while the filmmaker was making &quot;The River Wild&quot;. They found that they not only shared a love for Ellroy&#x27;s fiction but also agreed on how to adapt &quot;Confidential&quot; into a film. According to Helgeland, they had to &quot;remove every scene from the book that didn&#x27;t have the three main cops in it, and then to work from those scenes out.&quot; According to Hanson, he &quot;wanted the audience to be challenged but at the same time I didn&#x27;t want them to get lost.&quot; They worked on the script together for two years, with Hanson turning down jobs and Helgeland writing seven drafts for free.

The two men also got Ellroy&#x27;s approval. He had seen Hanson&#x27;s films &quot;The Bedroom Window&quot; and &quot;Bad Influence&quot;, and found him &quot;a competent and interesting storyteller&quot;, but was not convinced that his book would be made into a film until he talked to the eventual director. He later said, &quot;They preserved the basic integrity of the book and its main theme. Brian and Curtis took a work of fiction that had eight plotlines, reduced those to three, and retained the dramatic force of three men working out their destiny.&quot;

Warner Bros. executive Bill Gerber showed the script to Michael Nathanson, CEO of New Regency Productions, which had a deal with the studio. Nathanson loved it, but they had to get the approval of New Regency&#x27;s owner, Arnon Milchan. Hanson prepared a presentation that consisted of 15 vintage postcards and pictures of Los Angeles mounted on posterboards, and made his pitch to Milchan. The pictures consisted of orange groves, beaches, tract homes in the San Fernando Valley, and the opening of the Hollywood Freeway to symbolize the image of prosperity sold to the public.

In the pitch, Hanson showed the darker side of Ellroy&#x27;s novel by presenting the cover of scandal rag &quot;Confidential&quot; and the famous shot of Robert Mitchum coming out of jail after his marijuana bust. He also had photographs of jazz musicians Zoot Sims, Gerry Mulligan, and Chet Baker to represent the popular music of the time. Hanson emphasized that the period detail would be in the background and the characters in the foreground. Milchan was impressed with his presentation and agreed to finance it.

===Casting===
Hanson had seen Russell Crowe in &quot;Romper Stomper&quot; and found him &quot;repulsive and scary, but captivating&quot;. The actor had read Ellroy&#x27;s &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot; but not &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;. When he read the script, Crowe was drawn to Bud White&#x27;s &quot;self-righteous moral crusade&quot;. Crowe fit the visual preconception of Bud. Hanson put the actor on tape doing a few scenes from the script and showed it to the film&#x27;s producers, who agreed to cast him as Bud.

Guy Pearce auditioned, and Hanson felt that he &quot;was very much what I had in mind for Ed Exley.&quot; The director purposely did not watch the actor in &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot;, afraid that it might influence his decision. As he did with Crowe, Hanson taped Pearce and showed it to the producers, who agreed he should be cast as Ed. Pearce did not like Ed when he first read the screenplay and remarked, &quot;I was pretty quick to judge him and dislike him for being so self-righteous ... But I liked how honest he became about himself. I knew I could grow to respect and understand him.&quot;

Milchan was against casting &quot;two Australians&quot; in the American period piece (Pearce wryly noted in a later interview that while he and Crowe grew up in Australia, he was born in England to a New Zealand father, while the Māori Crowe is a New Zealander too). Crowe and Pearce were also relative unknowns in North America, and Milchan was equally worried about the lack of film stars in the lead roles. But he supported Hanson&#x27;s casting decisions and this gave the director the confidence to approach Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito and Kevin Spacey. Hanson cast Crowe and Pearce because he wanted to &quot;replicate my experience of the book. You don&#x27;t like any of these characters at first, but the deeper you get into their story, the more you begin to sympathize with them. I didn&#x27;t want actors audiences knew and already liked.&quot;

A third Australian actor unknown to American audiences at the time, Simon Baker, later to star in the television series &quot;The Mentalist&quot;, was cast in the smaller but noteworthy role of Matt Reynolds, a doomed young bisexual actor. He was billed as Simon Baker Denny in the film&#x27;s credits.

Hanson felt that the character of Jack Vincennes was &quot;a movie star among cops&quot;, and thought of Spacey, with his &quot;movie-star charisma,&quot; casting him specifically against type. The director was confident that the actor &quot;could play the man behind that veneer, the man who also lost his soul,&quot; and when he gave him the script, he told him to think of Dean Martin while in the role. Hanson cast Basinger because he felt that she &quot;was the character to me. What beauty today could project the glamor of Hollywood&#x27;s golden age?&quot;

===Pre-production===
To give his cast and crew points and counterpoints to capture Los Angeles in the 1950s, Hanson held a &quot;mini-film festival&quot;, showing one film a week: &quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot;, because it epitomized the glamorous Hollywood look; &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot;, because it revealed the ugly underbelly of Hollywood glamor; Don Siegel&#x27;s &quot;The Lineup&quot; and &quot;Private Hell 36&quot;, &quot;for their lean and efficient style&quot;; and &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot;, because it was &quot;so rooted in the futuristic &#x27;50s: the atomic age.&quot; Hanson and the film&#x27;s cinematographer Dante Spinotti studied Robert Frank&#x27;s 1958 photographic book &quot;The Americans&quot; and felt that the influence of his work was in every aspect of the film&#x27;s visuals. Spinotti wanted to compose the shots of the film as if he was using a still camera and suggested Hanson shoot the film in the Super 35 widescreen format with spherical lenses, which in Spinotti&#x27;s opinion conveyed the feel of a still photo.

Before filming took place, Hanson brought Crowe and Pearce to Los Angeles for two months to immerse them in the city and the time period. He also got them dialect coaches, showed them vintage police training films, and introduced them to real-life cops. Pearce found the contemporary police force had changed too much to be useful for research and disliked the police officer he rode along with because Pearce felt he was racist. He found the police films more valuable because &quot;there was a real sort of stiffness, a woodenness about these people&quot; that he felt Exley had as well. For six weeks, Crowe, Pearce, Hanson and Helgeland conducted rehearsals, which consisted of their discussing each scene in the script. As other actors were cast they would join in the rehearsals.

===Principal photography===

Hanson did not want the film to be an exercise in nostalgia, and so had Spinotti shoot it like a contemporary film, and used more naturalistic lighting than in a classic film noir. He told Spinotti and the film&#x27;s production designer Jeannine Oppewall to pay great attention to period detail, but to then &quot;put it all in the background&quot;. &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; was shot at the Linda Vista Community Hospital in the Los Angeles area. Several famous Hollywood landmarks appropriate to the 1950s were used, including the Formosa Cafe in West Hollywood, the Frolic Room on Hollywood Boulevard, and the Crossroads of the World, an outdoor shopping mall dressed as a movie theatre where the premiere of &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; takes place at the beginning of the film.

Patchett&#x27;s home is the Lovell House, a famous International Style mansion designed by Richard Neutra. Bracken&#x27;s house is at 501 Wilcox Avenue in the affluent Hancock Park neighborhood, overlooking the Wilshire Country Club. The house required a $75,000 renovation to transform it into the Spanish-style home described in the script. Historic Central Los Angeles neighborhoods were used for the scenes in which the police hunt down the Nite Owl suspects, including Angelino Heights, Lincoln Heights, and Koreatown. The Victory Motel was one of the only purpose-built sets, constructed on a flat stretch of the Inglewood Oil Field in Culver City.

===Music===
Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s score for the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Dramatic Score, but lost to James Horner&#x27;s score for &quot;Titanic&quot;.

==Reception==
The film was screened at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival. According to Hanson, Warner Bros. did not want it shown at Cannes because they felt there was an &quot;anti-studio bias ... So why go and come home a loser?&quot; But Hanson wanted to debut the film at a high-profile international venue. He and other producers bypassed the studio and sent a print directly to the festival&#x27;s selection committee, which loved it. Ellroy saw the film and said, &quot;I understood in 40 minutes or so that it is a work of art on its own level. It was amazing to see the physical incarnation of the characters.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; grossed $64.6 million in the United States, and $61.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $126.2 million.

The film was released on September 19, 1997, in 769 theaters, grossing $5.2 million in its opening weekend and finishing fourth behind &quot;In &amp; Out&quot;, &quot;The Game&quot; and &quot;Wishmaster&quot;. It made $4.4 million in its second weekend then expanded to 1,625 theaters and grossed $4.7 million in its third.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; holds an approval rating of 99% and an average rating of 9/10, with 162 out of 163 reviews being positive. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Taut pacing, brilliantly dense writing and Oscar-worthy acting combine to produce a smart, popcorn-friendly thrill ride.&quot; The film later appeared on top of the site&#x27;s list of the &quot;300 Best Movies of All Time&quot;, a synthesis of critic and user reviews. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 90 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and described it as &quot;seductive and beautiful, cynical and twisted, and one of the best films of the year.&quot; He later included it as one of his &quot;Great Movies&quot; and described it as &quot;film noir, and so it is, but it is more: Unusually for a crime film, it deals with the psychology of the characters ... It contains all the elements of police action, but in a sharply clipped, more economical style; the action exists not for itself but to provide an arena for the personalities&quot;.

In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin wrote, &quot;Mr. Spacey is at his insinuating best, languid and debonair, in a much more offbeat performance than this film could have drawn from a more conventional star. And the two Australian actors, tightly wound Mr. Pearce and fiery, brawny Mr. Crowe, qualify as revelations.&quot; Desson Howe&#x27;s review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised the cast: &quot;Pearce makes a wonderful prude who gets progressively tougher and more jaded. New Zealand-born Crowe has a unique and sexy toughness; imagine Mickey Rourke without the attitude. Although she&#x27;s playing a stock character, Basinger exudes a sort of chaste sultriness. Spacey is always enjoyable.&quot;

In his review for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Liam Lacey wrote, &quot;The big star is Los Angeles itself. Like Roman Polanski&#x27;s depiction of Los Angeles in the &#x27;30s in &quot;Chinatown&quot;, the atmosphere and detailed production design are a rich gel where the strands of narrative form.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film three and a half stars out of four, writing, &quot;It appears as if screenwriters Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson have pulled off a miracle in keeping multiple stories straight. Have they ever. Ellroy&#x27;s novel has four extra layers of plot and three times as many characters ... the writers have trimmed unwieldy muscle, not just fat, and gotten away with it.&quot;

In his review for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, David Ansen wrote, &quot;&quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; asks the audience to raise its level a bit, too—you actually have to pay attention to follow the double-crossing intricacies of the plot. The reward for your work is dark and dirty fun.&quot; Richard Schickel, in his review for &quot;Time&quot;, wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s a movie of shadows and half lights, the best approximation of the old black-and-white noir look anyone has yet managed on color stock. But it&#x27;s no idle exercise in style. The film&#x27;s look suggests how deep the tradition of police corruption runs.&quot; Writing in &quot;Time Out New York&quot;, Andrew Johnston observed: &quot;Large chunks of Ellroy&#x27;s brilliant (and often hilarious) dialogue are preserved, and the actors clearly relish the meaty lines. Dante Spinotti&#x27;s lush cinematography and Jeanne Oppewall&#x27;s crisp, meticulous production design produce an eye-popping tableau of &#x27;50s glamour and sleaze.&quot;

In his review for &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, Andrew Sarris wrote, &quot;Mr. Crowe strikes the deepest registers with the tortured character of Bud White, a part that has had less cut out of it from the book than either Mr. Spacey&#x27;s or Mr. Pearce&#x27;s ... but Mr. Crowe at moments reminded me of James Cagney&#x27;s poignant performance in Charles Vidor&#x27;s &quot;Love Me or Leave Me&quot; (1955), and I can think of no higher praise.&quot; Kenneth Turan, in his review for &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, wrote, &quot;The only potential audience drawback &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; has is its reliance on unsettling bursts of violence, both bloody shootings and intense physical beatings that give the picture a palpable air of menace. Overriding that, finally, is the film&#x27;s complete command of its material.&quot; In his review for &quot;The Independent&quot;, Ryan Gilbey wrote, &quot;In fact, it&#x27;s a very well made and intelligent picture, assembled with an attention to detail, both in plot and characterisation, that you might have feared was all but extinct in mainstream American cinema.&quot; Richard Williams, in his review for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, wrote, &quot;&quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; gets just about everything right. The light, the architecture, the slang, the music ... a wonderful Lana Turner joke. A sense, above all, of damaged people arriving to make new lives and getting seduced by the scent of night-blooming jasmine, the perfume of corruption.&quot;

Some authors have described &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; as a neo-noir film.

===Accolades===
&quot;TIME&quot; magazine ranked &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; the best film of 1997. The National Society of Film Critics also ranked it the year&#x27;s best film and Curtis Hanson was voted Best Director. The New York Film Critics Circle also voted &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; the year&#x27;s best film in addition to ranking Hanson best director, and his and Brian Helgeland&#x27;s best screenplay. The Los Angeles Film Critics Association and the National Board of Review also voted &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; the year&#x27;s best film. As a result, it is one of three films in history to sweep the &quot;Big Four&quot; critics&#x27; awards, alongside &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Social Network&quot; (2010).

It was also voted the best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25 years by a group of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writers and editors with two criteria: &quot;The movie had to communicate some inherent truth about the L.A. experience, and only one film per director was allowed on the list.&quot; In 2009, the London Film Critics&#x27; Circle voted &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; one of the best films of the past 30 years.

==Home media==
A VHS and DVD were released on April 14, 1998. In addition to the film, the latter release included two featurettes, an interactive map of Los Angeles, a music-only track, a theatrical trailer, and three TV spots.

The movie was released again as a two-disc Special Edition DVD and Blu-ray on September 23, 2008. Both sets have the same bonus content. In addition to the features from the original DVD, there are four new featurettes, the 1999 pilot of the proposed TV series starring Kiefer Sutherland, and film commentary by writer (novel) James Ellroy, writer (screenplay)/co-producer Brian Helgeland, actors Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito &amp; David Strathairn, production designer Jeannine Oppewall, director of photography Dante Spinotti, costume designer Ruth Myers and American film critic Andrew Sarris. Some sets included a six-song sampler from the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

On September 26, 2017, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, the distributor and part owner of New Regency, rereleased the film on Blu-ray as part of its 20th anniversary with new cover artwork. The disc has the same technical specifications and bonus features as the previous Blu-ray.

==Sequel==
In October 2020, Brian Helgeland confirmed a sequel to &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; had been in development before the death of Chadwick Boseman, who would have played a young cop working for L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley named James Muncie. Crowe and Pearce would have reprised their roles, and the film was to have been set in 1974.

The planned sequel failed to attract interest from studios, with Ellroy and Helgeland revealing that executives from Netflix fell asleep during their pitch.

<text>Elizabeth is a 1998 British biographical historical drama film directed by Shekhar Kapur and written by Michael Hirst. It stars Cate Blanchett in the titular role of Elizabeth I of England, with Geoffrey Rush, Christopher Eccleston, Joseph Fiennes, John Gielgud, and Richard Attenborough in supporting roles. The film is based on the early years of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, where she is elevated to the throne after the death of her half-sister Mary I, who had imprisoned her. As she establishes herself on the throne, she faces plots and threats to take her down.

&quot;Elizabeth&quot; premiered at the 55th Venice International Film Festival on 8 September 1998 and was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 23 October. The film became a critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised Kapur&#x27;s direction, costume design, production values and most notably Blanchett&#x27;s titular performance, bringing her to international recognition, while the film grossed $82 million against its $30 million budget.

The film received three nominations at the 56th Golden Globe Awards, including for the Best Motion Picture – Drama, with Blanchett winning Best Actress. It received twelve nominations at the 52nd British Academy Film Awards, winning five awards, including Outstanding British Film, and Best Actress (for Blanchett). At the 71st Academy Awards, it received seven nominations, including for Best Picture and Best Actress (for Blanchett), winning Best Makeup. In 2007, Blanchett and Rush reprised their roles in Kapur&#x27;s follow-up film &quot;&quot;, which covers the later part of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign.

==Plot==
In 1558, 42-year-old Catholic Queen Mary I of England, the daughter of Henry VIII and his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, dies, presumably from a cancerous tumor in her womb. Mary&#x27;s heir presumptive and 25-year-old half sister, Lady Elizabeth, daughter of Henry and his second wife, Anne Boleyn, was under house arrest for suspected involvement in Thomas Wyatt the Younger&#x27;s rebellion, is now freed from her imprisonment and crowned as Queen of England.

As briefed by her adviser, Sir William Cecil, Elizabeth inherits a distressed England besieged by debts, crumbling infrastructure, hostile neighbors, and treasonous nobles within her administration, chief among them, Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. Cecil tells Elizabeth that she must marry, produce an heir, and secure her rule. Unimpressed with her suitors, Elizabeth delays her decision and continues her affair with Lord Robert Dudley, her childhood friend. Cecil appoints Francis Walsingham, a Protestant exile returned from France, to act as Elizabeth&#x27;s bodyguard and adviser.

Mary of Guise, acting as regent for her young daughter, Mary, Queen of Scots, brings an additional 4,000 French troops to neighboring Scotland. Unfamiliar with military strategy and browbeaten by Norfolk at the war council, Elizabeth orders a military response, which proves disastrous when the professional French soldiers defeat the inexperienced, ill-trained English forces. Walsingham tells Elizabeth that Catholic lords and priests intentionally deprived Elizabeth&#x27;s army of proper soldiers and used their defeat to argue for Elizabeth&#x27;s removal. Realising the depth of the conspiracy against her and her dwindling options, Elizabeth accepts Mary of Guise&#x27;s conditions to consider marrying her nephew Henry, Duke of Anjou.

To stabilise her rule and heal England&#x27;s religious divisions, Elizabeth proposes the Act of Uniformity, which unites English Christians under the Church of England and severs their connection to the Vatican. In response to the Act&#x27;s passage, the Vatican sends a priest to England to aid Norfolk and his cohorts in their growing plot to overthrow Elizabeth. Unaware of the plot, Elizabeth meets Henry of France but ignores his advances in favor of Lord Robert. William Cecil confronts Elizabeth over her indecisiveness about marrying and reveals that Lord Dudley is married. Elizabeth rejects Henry&#x27;s marriage proposal when she discovers he is a cross-dresser and confronts Lord Dudley about his secret, fracturing their affair and banishing him from her private rooms.

Elizabeth survives an assassination attempt, evidence implicating Mary of Guise. Elizabeth sends Walsingham to meet with Mary secretly in Scotland, under the guise of once again planning to marry Henry. Instead, Walsingham assassinates Guise, inciting French enmity against Elizabeth. When William Cecil asks her to solidify relations with the Spanish, Elizabeth dismisses him from her service, choosing instead to follow her own counsel.

Walsingham warns of another plot to kill Elizabeth spearheaded by the Catholic priest carrying letters of conspiracy. Under Elizabeth&#x27;s orders, he apprehends the priest, who divulges the names of the conspirators and a Vatican agreement to elevate Norfolk to the English crown if he weds Mary, Queen of Scots. Walsingham arrests Norfolk and executes him and every conspirator except Lord Robert. Elizabeth grants Lord Robert his life as a reminder to herself how close she came to danger.

Drawing inspiration from the divine, Elizabeth models her appearance after the Virgin Mary. Proclaiming herself to be married to England, she ascends the throne as the &quot;Virgin Queen.&quot;

==Production==
The costuming and shot composition of the coronation scene are based on Elizabeth&#x27;s coronation portrait. Principal photography began on 2 September 1997 and completed on 2 December 1997 

Kapur&#x27;s original choice for the role was Emily Watson, but she turned it down. Cate Blanchett was chosen to play Elizabeth after Kapur saw a trailer of &quot;Oscar and Lucinda&quot;.
According to the director&#x27;s commentary, Kapur mentioned that the role of the Pope (played by Sir John Gielgud) was originally offered to, and accepted by, Marlon Brando. However, plans changed when Kapur noted that many on set would probably be concerned that Brando would be sharing the set with them for two days.

A large proportion of the indoor filming, representing the royal palace, was conducted in various corners of Durham Cathedral; its unique lozenge-carved nave pillars are clearly identifiable.

==Reception==

=== Critical response ===
The film was well received by critics. It holds an approval rating of 84% on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 67 reviews, with an average score of 7.40/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;No mere historical drama, &quot;Elizabeth&quot; is a rich, suspenseful journey into the heart of British Royal politics, and features a typically outstanding performance from Cate Blanchett.&quot; Metacritic reports a score of 75 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

===Historical accuracy===
&quot;Elizabeth&quot; received some criticism for factual liberties it takes and for its distortion of the historical timeline to present events that occurred in the middle to later part of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign as occurring at the beginning. In his entry for Elizabeth I in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, Patrick Collinson described the film &quot;as if the known facts of the reign, plus many hitherto unknown, were shaken up like pieces of a jigsaw and scattered on the table at random.&quot; Carole Levin, reviewing the film in 1999 for &quot;Perspectives on History&quot;, criticised the movie for portraying Elizabeth as &quot;a very weak and flighty character who often showed terrible judgment&quot;, in contrast to historical descriptions of her as a strong, decisive, and intelligent ruler. In particular, Levin described the movie&#x27;s portrayal of Elizabeth as dependent on Walsingham, in addition to the completely inaccurate portrayal of her relationship with Robert Dudley; such instances in the film make her character appear weak and overpowered by the men around her.

===Accusations of anti-Catholicism===
The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights accused the film of anti-Catholicism, stating that the film gives the &quot;impression that the religious strife was all the doing of the Catholic Church&quot;, noting that the review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; considered it &quot;resolutely anti-Catholic&quot; complete with a &quot;scheming pope&quot; and repeating the charge made in the &quot;Buffalo News&quot; that &quot;every single Catholic in the film is dark, cruel and devious.&quot;

<text>Life Is Beautiful (, ) is a 1997 Italian period comedy-drama film directed by and starring Roberto Benigni, who co-wrote the film with Vincenzo Cerami. Benigni plays Guido Orefice, a Jewish Italian bookshop owner, who employs his imagination to shield his son from the horrors of internment in a Nazi concentration camp. The film was partially inspired by the book &quot;In the End, I Beat Hitler&quot; by Rubino Romeo Salmonì and by Benigni&#x27;s father, who spent two years in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp during World War II.

The film was an overwhelming critical and commercial success. Despite some criticisms of using the subject matter for comedic purposes, it received widespread acclaim, with critics praising its story, performances and direction, and the union of drama and comedy. The movie grossed over $230 million worldwide, including $57.6 million in the United States, is the second highest-grossing foreign language film in the U.S. (after &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;) and one of the highest-grossing non-English language movies of all time. The National Board of Review included it in the top five best foreign films of 1998.

The movie won the Grand Prix at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival, nine David di Donatello Awards (including Best Film), five Nastro d&#x27;Argento Awards in Italy, two European Film Awards, and three Academy Awards, including Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actor for Benigni, the first for a male non-English performance.

==Plot==
; Part I
In 1939, in Fascist Italy, Guido Orefice is a young Italian Jewish man who arrives to work in the city of Arezzo, in Tuscany, where his uncle Eliseo works in the restaurant of a hotel. Guido is comical and sharp, and falls in love with a gentile girl named Dora. Later, he sees her again in the city where she is a teacher and set to be engaged to Rodolfo, a rich but arrogant local government official with whom Guido has regular run-ins. Guido sets up many &quot;coincidental&quot; incidents to show his interest in Dora.

Eventually, Dora sees Guido&#x27;s affection and promise and gives in. Guido steals her from her engagement party on Uncle Eliseo&#x27;s horse, Robin Hood, humiliating Dora&#x27;s fiancé and mother. They are later married, have a son, Giosuè, and run a bookstore. Dora&#x27;s mother visits one time to drop off a letter to her daughter, meeting her grandson.

; Part II
At the height of World War II, in 1944, Northern Italy is occupied by Nazi Germany. Guido, his uncle Eliseo, and Giosuè are arrested on Giosuè&#x27;s birthday. They and many other Italian Jews are forced onto a train bound for a concentration camp. After confronting a guard about her husband and son and being told there is no mistake, Dora volunteers to get on the train in order to stay with her family.

However, as men and women are separated in the camp, Dora never sees her family during their internment. Guido pulls off various stunts, such as hijacking the camp&#x27;s loudspeaker to send messages, symbolic or literal, to Dora to assure her that he and their son are safe. Eliseo is murdered in a gas chamber shortly after their arrival. Giosuè narrowly avoids being gassed himself as he hates to take baths and showers, and did not follow the other children when they had been ordered to &quot;take a shower&quot;.

In the camp, Guido consistently hides the true situation from his son. Guido tells Giosuè that the camp is a complicated game in which he must perform the tasks Guido gives him. Each of the tasks will earn them points and whoever gets to one thousand points first will win a tank. He tells him that if he cries, complains that he wants his mother, or says that he is hungry, he will lose points, while quiet boys who hide from the camp guards earn extra points. Giosuè is at times reluctant to go along with the game, but Guido convinces him each time to continue.

At one point, Guido takes advantage of the appearance of visiting German officers and their families to show Giosuè that other children are hiding as part of the game, and tricks a German nanny into thinking Giosuè is one of her charges in order to feed him while Guido serves the German officers to monitor Giosuè. Guido tells Giosuè to stay quiet at all times for this part of the game and simply follow the other children, as Giosuè cannot speak German. Giosuè is almost exposed as a prisoner when Giosuè accidentally says &quot;thank you&quot; in Italian to another server at dinner, but when the server returns with his superior, Guido provides a ruse by teaching all of the German children how to say &quot;thank you&quot; in Italian, saving Giosuè.

Guido maintains this story right until the end when, in the chaos of shutting down the camp as the Allied forces approach, he tells his son to stay in a box until everybody has left, this being the final task in the competition before the promised tank is his. Guido goes to find Dora, but he is caught by a German soldier. An officer orders Guido to be executed and Guido is led off by the soldier. While he is walking to his death, Guido passes by Giosuè one last time and winks, still in character and playing the game. Guido is then shot and left for dead in an alleyway.

The next morning, Giosuè emerges from the sweat-box, just as a U.S. Army unit led by a Sherman tank arrives and the camp is liberated. An overjoyed Giosuè, unaware of his father&#x27;s death, thinks he won the tank, and an American soldier allows Giosuè to ride with him on the tank.

While traveling to safety, Giosuè soon spots Dora in the procession leaving the camp and reunites with his mother. While the young Giosuè excitedly tells his mother about how he had won a tank, just as his father had promised, the adult Giosuè, in an overheard monologue, reveals himself as the movie&#x27;s narrator, reminiscing on the sacrifices his father made for him.

==Cast==
== Production ==

Director Roberto Benigni, who wrote the screenplay with Vincenzo Cerami, was inspired by the story of Rubino Romeo Salmonì and his book &quot;In the End, I Beat Hitler&quot;, which incorporates elements of irony and black comedy. Salmoni was an Italian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz, survived and was reunited with his parents, but found his brothers were murdered. Benigni stated he wished to commemorate Salmoni as a man who wished to live in the right way. He also based the story on that of his father Luigi Benigni, who was a member of the Italian Army after Italy became a co-belligerent of the Allies in 1943. Luigi Benigni spent two years in a Nazi labour camp, and to avoid scaring his children, told about his experiences humorously, finding this helped him cope. Roberto Benigni explained his philosophy, &quot;to laugh and to cry comes from the same point of the soul, no? I&#x27;m a storyteller: the crux of the matter is to reach beauty, poetry, it doesn&#x27;t matter if that is comedy or tragedy. They&#x27;re the same if you reach the beauty.&quot; The names of the protagonists are instead taken from Dora De Giovanni and Guido Vittoriano Basile, uncles of Nicoletta Braschi; Basile, arrested for his anti-fascist activity, died in the Mauthausen concentration camp, a fate similar to that of the protagonist of the film of the same name, a fact that turned Dora&#x27;s life upside down.

His friends advised against making the film, as he is a comedian and not Jewish, and the Holocaust was not of interest to his established audience. Because he is Gentile, Benigni consulted with the Center for Documentation of Contemporary Judaism, based in Milan, throughout production. Benigni incorporated historical inaccuracies in order to distinguish his story from the true Holocaust, about which he said only documentaries interviewing survivors could provide &quot;the truth&quot;.

The film was shot in the &quot;centro storico&quot; (historic centre) of Arezzo, Tuscany. The scene where Benigni falls off a bicycle and lands on Nicoletta Braschi was shot in front of Badia delle Sante Flora e Lucilla in Arezzo. The concentration camp was set in an old abandoned factory near Papigno (Terni) that was converted into a concentration camp for filming. The &quot;prize&quot; tank is an M4 Sherman.

===Music===

The original score to the film was composed by Nicola Piovani, with the exception of a classical piece which figures prominently: the &quot;Barcarolle&quot; by Jacques Offenbach. The soundtrack album won the Academy Award for Best Original Dramatic Score and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media.

==Release==
In Italy, the film was released in 1997 by Cecchi Gori Distribuzione. The film was screened in the Cannes Film Festival in May 1998, where it was a late addition to the selection of films. In the U.S., it was released on 23 October 1998, by Miramax Films. In Germany, it was released on 12 November 1998. In Austria, it was released on 13 November 1998. In the UK, it was released on 12 February 1999. After the Italian, English subtitled version became a hit in English speaking territories, Miramax reissued &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; in an English dubbed version, but it was less successful than the subtitled Italian version.

The film was aired on the Italian television station RAI on 22 October 2001 and was viewed by 16 million people. This made it the most watched Italian film on Italian TV.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; was commercially successful, making 92 billion lire ($48.7 million) in Italy. It was the highest-grossing Italian film in its native country until 2011, when surpassed by Checco Zalone&#x27;s &quot;What a Beautiful Day&quot;.

The film was also successful in the rest of the world, grossing $57.6 million in the United States and Canada and $123.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide gross of $230.1 million. It surpassed fellow Italian film &quot;Il Postino: The Postman&quot; as the highest-grossing foreign language film in the United States until &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; (2000).

===Critical response===
The film was praised by the Italian press, with Benigni treated as a &quot;national hero.&quot; Pope John Paul II, who received a private screening with Benigni, placed it in his top five favourite films. It holds a &quot;Fresh&quot; 81% approval rating on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 93 reviews with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Benigni&#x27;s earnest charm, when not overstepping its bounds into the unnecessarily treacly, offers the possibility of hope in the face of unflinching horror&quot;. Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5/4 stars, stating: &quot;[According to Benigni] the movie has stirred up venomous opposition from the right wing in Italy [and at] Cannes, it offended some left-wing critics with its use of humor in connection with the Holocaust. What may be most offensive to both wings is its sidestepping of politics in favor of simple human ingenuity. The film finds the right notes to negotiate its delicate subject matter ... The movie actually softens the Holocaust slightly, to make the humor possible at all. In the real death camps there would be no role for Guido. But &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; is not about Nazis and Fascists, but about the human spirit. It is about rescuing whatever is good and hopeful from the wreckage of dreams. About hope for the future. About the necessary human conviction, or delusion, that things will be better for our children than they are right now.&quot; Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the movie a score of 100/100, calling it: &quot;A deeply moving blend of cold terror and rapturous hilarity. Lovingly crafted by Italy&#x27;s top comedian and most popular filmmaker, it&#x27;s that rare comedy that takes on a daring and ambitious subject and proves worthy of it.&quot;

Richard Schickel, writing for &quot;Time&quot;, argued, &quot;There are references to mass extermination, but that brutal reality is never vividly presented&quot;. He concluded that &quot;even a hint of the truth about the Holocaust would crush [Benigni]&#x27;s comedy.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a B−, calling it &quot;undeniably some sort of feat—the first feel-good Holocaust weepie. It&#x27;s been a long time coming.&quot; However, Glieberman stated: &quot;There&#x27;s only one problem. As shot, it looks like a game&quot;.

Michael O&#x27;Sullivan, writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, called it &quot;sad, funny and haunting.&quot;

Nell Minow of &quot;Common Sense Media&quot; gave it 5/5 stars, saying: &quot;This magnificent film gives us a glimpse of the Holocaust, but it is really about love, and the indomitability of humanity even in the midst of inhumanity.&quot; Janet Maslin wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the film took &quot;a colossal amount of gall&quot; but &quot;because Mr. Benigni can be heart-rending without a trace of the maudlin, it works.&quot; &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;″s Kenneth Turan noted the film had &quot;some furious opposition&quot; at Cannes, but said &quot;what is surprising about this unlikely film is that it succeeds as well as it does. Its sentiment is inescapable, but genuine poignancy and pathos are also present, and an overarching sincerity is visible too.&quot;

David Rooney of &quot;Variety&quot; said the film had &quot;mixed results,&quot; with &quot;surprising depth and poignancy&quot; in Benigni&#x27;s performance but &quot;visually rather flat&quot; camera work by Tonino Delli Colli. In 2002, BBC critic Tom Dawson wrote &quot;the film is presumably intended as a tribute to the powers of imagination, innocence, and love in the most harrowing of circumstances,&quot; but &quot;Benigni&#x27;s sentimental fantasy diminishes the suffering of Holocaust victims.&quot;

In 2006, Jewish American comedic filmmaker Mel Brooks spoke negatively of the film in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, saying it trivialized the suffering in concentration camps.

By contrast, Nobel Laureate Imre Kertész argues that those who take the film to be a comedy, rather than a tragedy, have missed the point of the film. He draws attention to what he terms &#x27;Holocaust conformism&#x27; in cinema to rebuff detractors of &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot;.

Israeli screenwriter, author and art critic Kobi Niv published the book &quot;Life Is Beautiful, but Not for Jews&quot; (in 2000 in Hebrew and an English translation in 2003), in which he analyzed the movie from a highly critical perspective, suggesting that the film&#x27;s underlining narrative is harmful for Jews.

Another academic analysis of the movie was undertaken by Ilona Klein, who analyzes the film&#x27;s success and refers to the &quot;ambiguous themes hidden within.&quot; Klein suggests that one of the reasons the movie was so successful was its appeal of &quot;sentimental optimism&quot;. At the same time, she points out that &quot;Miramax&#x27;s hype billed this film as a fable about &#x27;love, family, and the power of imagination,&#x27; yet most Jewish victims of the Nazis&#x27; &#x27;Final Solution&#x27; were loving, concerned, devoted parents. No amount of love, family, and power of imagination helped their children survive the gas chambers.&quot;

David Sterritt of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; highlighted that &quot;Enthusiasm for the movie has not been as unanimous as its ad campaign suggests, however, and audiences would do well to ponder its implicit attitudes.&quot; He pointed out that the movie implicitly suggests quick-witted confidence was a match for the terrors of fascist death camps, then added that &quot;[Benigni&#x27;s] fable ultimately obscures the human and historical events it sets out to illuminate.&quot;

The movie also received criticism, for the scene of the US Army Sherman M4 Tank coming to liberate the concentration camp. However, Auschwitz was liberated by the Red Army and Belsen was liberated by the British Army. Although there were Internet users who claimed that this scene was a historical revisionism.

===Accolades===
&quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; was shown at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival, and went on to win the Grand Prix. Upon receiving the award, Benigni kissed the feet of jury president Martin Scorsese.

At the 71st Academy Awards, Benigni won Best Actor for his role, with the film winning two more awards for Best Music, Original Dramatic Score and Best Foreign Language Film. Benigni jumped on top of the seats as he made his way to the stage to accept his first award, and upon accepting his second, said, &quot;This is a terrible mistake because I used up all my English!&quot;

<doc id="142464" wikidata="Q193979" url="?curid=142464" title="Farce">
<text>Farce is a comedy that seeks to entertain an audience through situations that are highly exaggerated, extravagant, ridiculous, absurd, and improbable. Farce is also characterized by heavy use of physical humor; the use of deliberate absurdity or nonsense; satire, parody, and mockery of real-life situations, people, events, and interactions; unlikely and humorous instances of miscommunication; ludicrous, improbable, and exaggerated characters; and broadly stylized performances.

== Genre ==
Despite involving absurd situations and characters, the genre generally maintains at least a slight degree of realism and narrative continuity within the context of the irrational or ludicrous situations, often distinguishing it from completely absurdist or fantastical genres. Farces are often episodic or short in duration, often being set in one specific location where all events occur. Farces have historically been performed for the stage and film.

== Historical context ==
The term &quot;farce&quot; is derived from the French word for &quot;stuffing&quot;, in reference to improvisations applied by actors to medieval religious dramas. Later forms of this drama were performed as comical interludes during the 15th and 16th centuries. The oldest surviving farce may be &quot;Le Garçon et l&#x27;aveugle&quot; (&quot;The Boy and the Blind Man&quot;) from after 1266, although the earliest farces that can be dated come from between 1450 and 1550. The best known farce is &quot;La Farce de maître Pathelin&quot; (&quot;The Farce of Master Pathelin&quot;) from c. 1460. Spoof films such as &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, a comedy based on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies, are farces.

Sir George Grove opined that the &quot;farce&quot; began as a canticle in the common French tongue intermixed with Latin. It became a vehicle for satire and fun, and thus led to the modern Farsa or Farce, a piece in one act, the subject of which is extravagant and the action ludicrous.

<doc id="142465" wikidata="Q221491" url="?curid=142465" title="The Thin Red Line (1998 film)">
<text>The Thin Red Line is a 1998 American epic war film written and directed by Terrence Malick. It is the second film adaptation of the 1962 novel by James Jones, following the 1964 film. Telling a fictionalized version of the Battle of Mount Austen, which was part of the Guadalcanal Campaign in the Pacific Theater of the Second World War, it portrays U.S. soldiers of C Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division, played by Sean Penn, Jim Caviezel, Nick Nolte, Elias Koteas, and Ben Chaplin. The novel&#x27;s title alludes to a line from Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s poem &quot;Tommy&quot;, from &quot;Barrack-Room Ballads&quot;, in which he calls Scottish foot soldiers &quot;the thin red line of heroes&quot;, referring to the stand of the 93rd Regiment in the Battle of Balaclava of the Crimean War.

The film marked Malick&#x27;s return to filmmaking after a 20-year absence. It co-stars Adrien Brody, George Clooney, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Jared Leto, John C. Reilly, and John Travolta. Reportedly, the first assembled cut took seven months to edit and ran five hours. By the final cut, footage of performances by Bill Pullman, Lukas Haas, and Mickey Rourke had been removed (one of Rourke&#x27;s scenes was included in the special features outtakes of the Criterion Blu-ray and DVD release). The film was scored by Hans Zimmer and shot by John Toll. Principal photography took place in Queensland, Australia and in the Solomon Islands.

20th Century Fox released &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; on December 25, 1998, and grossed $98 million against a $52 million budget. Critics gave it a positive reception, praising it for its philosophical depiction of war, Malick&#x27;s direction, musical score, cinematography, screenplay, editing, and performances of the cast. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound. It won the Golden Bear at the 1999 Berlin International Film Festival. Martin Scorsese ranked it as his second-favorite film of the 1990s. On &quot;At the Movies&quot;, Gene Siskel called it &quot;the finest contemporary war film I&#x27;ve seen.&quot;

==Plot==
United States Army Private Witt goes AWOL from his unit in 1942 to live among the carefree Melanesian natives in the South Pacific. He is found and imprisoned on a troopship by First Sergeant Welsh of his company. Witt is not allowed to rejoin his unit, and is instead punitively assigned to act as a stretcher bearer for the upcoming campaign.

The men of C Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division, have been brought to the island of Guadalcanal as reinforcements in the campaign to secure Henderson Field, seize the island from the Japanese, and block off their route to Australia. C Company is commanded by Capt. James Staros. As they wait in the hold of a Navy transport ship, they contemplate their lives and the upcoming invasion.

The company lands on Guadalcanal unopposed. They march into the interior of the island, and along the way encounter natives and evidence of the ongoing Japanese presence. The company soon finds its objective: Hill 210, a key enemy position.

The attack commences at dawn the next day. Charlie Company storms up the hill, but is immediately repelled by heavy machine-gun fire. One group, a squad led by Sergeant Keck, hides behind a knoll safe from enemy fire &quot;to await reinforcements&quot;. When they are fired upon, Keck reaches for a grenade on his belt and accidentally pulls the pin, then throws himself back on the grenade so that he will be the only one killed by the blast. At another point, Sergeant Welsh attempts to rescue a dying soldier, only to provide him with enough morphine to put him out of his misery.

Lt. Col. Gordon Tall orders Staros over the field telephone to capture the bunker by frontal assault, at whatever cost. Staros balks, stating that he will not commit his men to what he sees as a suicide mission. Meanwhile, Pvt. Bell covertly scouts the summit of the hill by himself and assesses the Japanese stronghold.

Furious at Staros&#x27;s refusal to obey his command, Tall ventures up to Charlie Company&#x27;s position, accompanied by his battalion executive officer, Captain John Gaff. When they arrive, they find that the Japanese resistance seems to have lessened, and Tall&#x27;s opinion of Staros is sealed. After being advised of Bell&#x27;s reconnaissance of the Japanese position, Tall suggests a small detachment of men to perform a flanking maneuver on the bunker to capture it. Among the men to volunteer for the mission are Pvts. Witt, Doll, and Bell. Captain Gaff is given command of the detachment, and they proceed up the hill toward the bunker. A fierce battle ensues, but ultimately the American forces are victorious, and the hill is captured.

For their efforts, the men are given a week&#x27;s leave, though they find little joy in the respite in the fighting. While the company is bivouacked, Staros is relieved of his command by Tall, who deems him too soft for the pressures of combat and suggests that he apply for reassignment and become a lawyer in the JAG Corps in Washington, D.C. During this time, Bell receives a letter from his wife, informing him that she has fallen in love with another man and seeks a divorce. Witt, meanwhile, comes across some of the locals and notices that they have grown distant and distrustful of outsiders, and regularly quarrel with each other.

The company is sent on patrol up a river under the command of Lieutenant Band. Witt, along with Cpl. Fife, and Pvt. Coombs, scout upriver and encounter an advancing Japanese column. As they attempt to retreat, Coombs is wounded. Witt draws away the Japanese to buy time for Fife, but Witt is encircled by one of their squads. The Japanese demand Witt surrender, but he raises his rifle and is killed. His body is buried by his squadmates, including a visibly grieving Sgt. Welsh. The company soon receives a new commander, Captain Bosche. They are relieved of duty and evacuated from Guadalcanal by a waiting LCT.

==Cast==


Beyond these numerous top-billed cast, the ensemble included appearances in smaller roles by many other well-known actors, including Kirk Acevedo, Penny Allen, Mark Boone Junior, Matt Doran, Don Harvey, Danny Hoch, Thomas Jane, Miranda Otto, Donal Logue, and Nick Stahl.

Lukas Haas, Bill Pullman and Mickey Rourke were also part of the film, but their scenes were ultimately cut.

==Production==

===Screenplay===
New York-based producer Bobby Geisler first approached Malick in 1978 and asked him to direct a film adaptation of David Rabe&#x27;s play &quot;In the Boom Boom Room&quot;. Malick declined the offer, but instead discussed the idea of a film about the life of Joseph Merrick. Once word got out about David Lynch&#x27;s film of &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, he shelved the idea. In 1988, Geisler and John Roberdeau met with Malick in Paris about writing and directing a movie based on D. M. Thomas&#x27; 1981 novel &quot;The White Hotel&quot;. Malick declined, but told them that he would be willing instead to write either an adaptation of Molière&#x27;s &quot;Tartuffe&quot;, or of James Jones&#x27; &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;. The producers chose the latter and paid Malick $250,000 to write a screenplay.

Malick began adapting &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; on January 1, 1989. Five months later, the producers received his first draft, which was 300 pages long. In 1990, Malick met with James Jones&#x27; widow Gloria and Jones&#x27; daughter Kaylie about adapting &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; into a film. The producers spent a lot of time talking with Malick about his vision of the film. Geisler said,Malick&#x27;s Guadalcanal would be a Paradise Lost, an Eden, raped by the green poison, as Terry used to call it, of war. Much of the violence was to be portrayed indirectly. A soldier is shot, but rather than showing a Spielbergian bloody face we see a tree explode, the shredded vegetation, and a gorgeous bird with a broken wing flying out of a tree.

Malick spent years working on other projects, including a stage production of &quot;Sansho the Bailiff&quot; and a script known as &quot;The English-Speaker&quot;, spending $2 million of the producers&#x27; money, half of which for writing. According to an article in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, the producers gained Malick&#x27;s confidence by &quot;catering to his every whim,&quot; providing him with obscure research material, including a book titled &quot;Reptiles and Amphibians of Australia&quot;, an audiotape of Kodō&#x27;s &quot;Heartbeat Drummers of Japan&quot;, information on the Navajo code talkers recruited by the United States Marine Corps, making his travel plans, and helping the director and his wife Michele get a mortgage for their Paris apartment.

By January 1995, Geisler and Roberdeau were broke and pressured Malick to decide which project he would complete. They approached Malick&#x27;s former agent, Mike Medavoy, who was setting up his own production company, Phoenix Pictures, and he agreed to give them $100,000 to start work on &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;. Medavoy had a deal with Sony Pictures and Malick began scouting locations in Panama and Costa Rica before settling on the rain forests of northern Australia. In April 1997, three months before filming, Sony pulled the plug while crews were building the sets in Queensland, because new studio chairman John Calley did not think Malick could make his movie with the proposed $52 million budget. Malick traveled to Los Angeles with Medavoy to pitch the project to various studios. 20th Century Fox agreed to put up $39 million of the budget with the stipulation that Malick cast five movie stars from a list of 10 who were interested. Pioneer Films, a Japanese company, contributed $8 million to the budget, and Phoenix Pictures added $3 million.

===Casting===

Casting for the film became a hot topic. When Sean Penn met Malick, he told him, &quot;Give me a dollar and tell me where to show up.&quot; Scripts were also sent to Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall and Tom Cruise. In 1995, once word went out that Malick was making another movie after many years, numerous actors approached him, flooding the casting directors until they had to announce they wouldn&#x27;t be accepting more requests. Some A-list actors including Brad Pitt, Al Pacino, Gary Oldman, and George Clooney offered to work for a fraction and some even offered to work for free. Bruce Willis even went as far as offering to pay for first-class tickets for the casting crew, to get a few lines for the movie. At Medavoy&#x27;s home in 1995, Malick staged a reading with Martin Sheen delivering the screen directions, and Kevin Costner, Will Patton, Peter Berg, Lukas Haas, and Dermot Mulroney playing the main roles. In June of that year, a five-day workshop was scheduled at Medavoy&#x27;s with Pitt dropping by, and culminating with Malick putting on the soundtrack of &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; and playing Japanese taiko drums. Malick met with an interested Johnny Depp about the project at the Book Soup Bistro on the Sunset Strip.

Edward Norton flew out to Austin and met Malick, who had been impressed by the actor&#x27;s screen test for &quot;Primal Fear&quot;. Matthew McConaughey reportedly took a day off filming &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; to see Malick. Others followed, including William Baldwin, Edward Burns, Josh Hartnett, Crispin Glover, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Stephen Dorff, and Leonardo DiCaprio; the last of these flew up from the Mexico set of &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; to meet Malick at the American Airlines lounge in the Austin airport. Before the casting was finalized, Nicolas Cage had lunch with Malick in Hollywood in February 1996. Malick went off to scout locations and tried calling Cage that summer only to find out that his phone number had been disconnected. Tom Sizemore, however, was offered a more substantial role in &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and, when he could not contact Malick for several days, decided to do Steven Spielberg&#x27;s film instead. Actors Bill Pullman, Mickey Rourke, and Lukas Haas filmed scenes for the movie but were cut from the final film due to time constraints. Publicity stills of Pullman (as Sgt. MacTae, in a scene opposite Brody and Chaplin) can be seen online, Haas is pictured in the booklet of the CD soundtrack, and one of Rourke&#x27;s scenes was restored for the Criterion Blu-Ray/DVD release of the film. Malick wrote a part specifically for Oldman, but the character was eventually scrapped before production began due to too many characters being in the film. He was later thanked in the credits along with Lukas, Viggo Mortensen, Sheen, Rourke, Pullman and Jason Patric.

James Caviezel, who was cast as Private Witt, credits Malick&#x27;s casting of him as the turning point in his career.

===Principal photography===

Cinematographer John Toll began talking to Malick in August 1996 several times over the phone about the film. Toll met Malick in September of the same year and was asked to do the film in the beginning of 1997. Malick and Toll began location scouting in February 1997 and started principal photography in June of that year.

Pre-production went slowly. Weeks before filming began, Malick told Geisler and Roberdeau not to show up in Australia where the film was being made, ostensibly because George Stevens Jr. would be the on-location producer supporting line producer Grant Hill. Malick told them that they had upset the studio for refusing to give up above-the-title production credit to Stevens. He did not tell them that in 1996 he had a clause inserted in his contract barring the producers from the set. Geisler and Roberdeau were mystified about this behavior; Geisler told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;I didn&#x27;t think he was capable of betrayal of this magnitude.&quot;

Malick and Toll shot for 100 days in Australia using Panavision cameras and lenses, 24 days in the Solomon Islands and three days in the United States. They scouted the historic battlefields on Guadalcanal and shot footage, but health concerns over malaria limited filming to daylight hours only. Logistics were also difficult to shoot the entire film there: As director of photography John Toll put it, &quot;It&#x27;s still a bit difficult to get on and off the island, and we had some scenes that involved 200 or 300 extras. We would have had to bring everybody to Guadalcanal, and financially it just didn&#x27;t make sense.&quot; &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; was filmed predominantly in the Daintree Rainforest and on Bramston Beach, both in north Queensland, Australia. Filming also took place on Dancer Mountain, which had such rough terrain that trailers and production trucks could not make it up the hill. A base camp was set up and roads carved out of the mountain. Transporting 250 actors and 200 crew members up the hill took two hours. Filming took place in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California near Santa Catalina Island.

Malick&#x27;s unconventional filming techniques included shooting part of a scene during a bright, sunny morning only to finish it weeks later at sunset. He made a habit of pointing the camera away during an action sequence and focus on a parrot, a tree branch or other fauna. Malick&#x27;s reputation and working methods commanded great respect among the actors, with both Woody Harrelson and John Savage staying on for an extra month after they finished all of their scenes just to watch him at work.

===Post-production===
Bill Pullman, Lukas Haas and Mickey Rourke performed but their scenes were eventually cut. Billy Bob Thornton recorded narration that was scrapped. Martin Sheen and Viggo Mortensen participated in readthroughs of the script and are thanked in the end credits. Editor Leslie Jones was on location for five months and rarely saw Malick, who left her to her own devices. After principal photography wrapped, she came back with a five-hour first cut and spent seven months editing, with Thornton contributing three hours of narrative voice-over material. It was at this point that editor Billy Weber joined and they spent 13 months in post-production and the last four months mixing the film, using four Avid machines with a fifth added at one point. Malick edited the footage one reel at a time with the sound off while listening to a Green Day CD. There were no preview screenings but several in-house ones, the largest for marketing executives which was attended by 15 people. The editors faced the challenge of blending footage of veteran actors with less-experienced ones, integrating the many cameos, and the voice-overs. According to Jones, &quot;Malick removed scenes with dialogue whenever possible, with the final film varying greatly from the original concept.&quot; Four months after principal photography, Malick invited Toll to a rough-cut screening of the film. In December 1998, Toll did the first color correction at the lab prior to the film&#x27;s release in North America.

The editing resulted in many of the well-known cast members being on screen for only a brief period. John Travolta and George Clooney&#x27;s appearances are little more than cameos, yet Clooney&#x27;s name appears prominently in the marketing of the movie. The unfinished film was screened for the New York press in December 1998 and Adrien Brody attended a screening to find that his originally significant role, &quot;to carry the movie&quot;, as he put it, had been reduced to two lines and approximately five minutes of screen time.

Malick was upset that the studio screened his unfinished version for critics and Penn ended up helping him in the editing room, shaping the final version. Malick spent three more months and cut 45 additional minutes from the film. The director refused to subject his film to test screenings before delivering his final cut. After Geisler and Roberdeau told their story to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine, Medavoy&#x27;s attorneys declared them in breach of contract and threatened to remove their names from the film unless they agreed to do no future interviews until after the Academy Awards.

==Music==


The film score was composed by Hans Zimmer, with additional music from John Powell. The album was nominated for Best Dramatic Score at the 71st Academy Awards. It was Hans Zimmer&#x27;s fifth Oscar nomination as a composer, but he lost out to Roberto Benigni&#x27;s &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot; (music by Nicola Piovani). The album was released by RCA Victor and conducted by Gavin Greenaway. Among the music not written by Zimmer which appears in the film is &quot;In Paradisum&quot; from &quot;Requiem&quot; by Gabriel Fauré and the opening minutes of &quot;The Unanswered Question&quot; by Charles Ives.

Zimmer wrote several hours of music, and an abundance of different themes, before Malick started to shoot the film. The director played the music on the set, while filming, to get himself, and the rest of the crew and actors in the right frame of mind.

The official soundtrack features tracks that were not used on the film and some tracks from the film are not found on the CD.
The film features several pieces of Melanesian choral music sung by the Choir of All Saints in Honiara and the Melanesian Brotherhood in Tabalia, only one of which is featured on the soundtrack. However, another soundtrack was released containing several tracks from the choirs, titled &quot;Melanesian Choirs: The Blessed Islands – Chants from the Thin Red Line&quot;, which has since gone out of circulation. This album was re-released by La-La Land Records as part of a special edition in 2019.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; was given a limited release on December 25, 1998, in five theaters where it grossed $282,534 on its opening weekend. The film was given a wide release on January 15, 1999, in 1,528 theaters where it grossed $9.7 million during its opening weekend. The film earned $98,126,565 at the worldwide box office.

===Critical reception===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; holds an approval rating of 80% based on 107 reviews, and an average rating of 7.3/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; is a daringly philosophical World War II film with an enormous cast of eager stars.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Gene Siskel described &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; as the &quot;finest contemporary war film I&#x27;ve seen, supplanting Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; from earlier this year, or even Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Platoon&quot; from 1986.&quot; A more subdued Roger Ebert gave it three stars out of four, saying that it felt confused and unfinished. He wrote, &quot;The movie&#x27;s schizophrenia keeps it from greatness (this film has no firm idea of what it is about), but doesn&#x27;t make it bad. It is, in fact, sort of fascinating... The battle scenes themselves are masterful, in creating a sense of the geography of a particular hill, the way it is defended by Japanese bunkers, the ways in which the American soldiers attempt to take it ... Actors like Sean Penn, John Cusack, Jim Caviezel and Ben Chaplin find the perfect tone for scenes of a few seconds or a minute, and then are dropped before a rhythm can be established.&quot;

In his review for &quot;Time&quot;, Richard Corliss wrote, &quot;Some films deal in plot truth; this one expresses emotional truth, the heart&#x27;s search for saving wisdom, in some of the most luscious imagery since Malick&#x27;s last film, the 1978 &quot;Days of Heaven&quot;.&quot; Mike Clark of &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film four out of four stars. Michael O&#x27;Sullivan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; is a movie about creation growing out of destruction, about love where you&#x27;d least expect to find it and about angels – especially the fallen kind – who just happen to be men.&quot;

Andrew Johnston of &quot;Time Out New York&quot; wrote: &quot;Like Malick&#x27;s previous efforts – &quot;Badlands (1973)&quot; and &quot;Days of Heaven&quot; (1978) – &quot;Line&quot; is a film of incredible beauty. However, the atmosphere created by John Toll&#x27;s breathtaking cinematography and Hans Zimmer&#x27;s powerful score is occasionally compromised. The parade of cameos (John Travolta, George Clooney, Woody Harrelson and John Cusack briefly appear) is somewhat distracting, and the fact that Bell and Witt both have Appalachian accents sometimes makes the characters hard to differentiate. Yet, even though it&#x27;s confusing at times (and perhaps a little long), &quot;Line&quot; is still a film of rare substance and power.&quot;

Owen Gleiberman gave the film a &quot;B−&quot; in his review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and wrote, &quot;&quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; could, I think, turn out to be this season&#x27;s &quot;Beloved&quot;, a movie too paralyzingly high-minded to connect with audiences.&quot; In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin called it &quot;intermittently brilliant&quot; and wrote, &quot;The heart-piercing moments that punctuate its rambling are glimpses of what a tighter film might have been.&quot;

In a special episode of &quot;Siskel and Ebert&quot;, guest host Martin Scorsese selected &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; as the second best film of the 1990s behind &quot;The Horse Thief&quot;.

===Accolades===
&quot;Time&quot; magazine ranked Malick&#x27;s film #6 on their Best of 1998 Cinema list.

Jonathan Rosenbaum, film critic for the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, ranked Malick&#x27;s film as his second favorite film of 1999.

==Home media==
On September 28, 2010, The Criterion Collection released a special edition of &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; on DVD and Blu-ray with a new, restored 4K digital transfer, supervised and approved by Terrence Malick and cinematographer John Toll.
The release was met with positive reviews.

<text>Redlichiida is an order of trilobites, a group of extinct marine arthropods. Species assigned to the order Redlichiida are among the first trilobites to appear in the fossil record, about halfway during the Lower Cambrian. Due to the difficulty to relate sediments in different areas, there remains some discussion, but among the earliest are &quot;Fallotaspis&quot; (suborder Olenellina), and &quot;Lemdadella&quot; (suborder Redlichiina), both belonging to this order. The first representatives of the orders Corynexochida and Ptychopariida also appear very early on and may prove to be even earlier than any redlichiid species. In terms of anatomical comparison, the earliest redlichiid species are probably ancestral to all other trilobite orders and share many primitive characters. The last redlichiid trilobites died out before the end of the Middle Cambrian.

== Description ==

Most redlichiids are rather flat (or have low dorso–ventral convexity) and their exoskeleton typically has an oval outline, about 1½× longer than wide. Each back edge of the headshield (or cephalon) very often carries a spine, termed a genal spine. The eye lobes are sickle-shaped, long and extend from the frontal lobe of the central raised area of the cephalon (or glabella) curving outward and increasingly backwards and sometimes eventually inwards again. The visual surface, that contains the calcite lenses is surrounded by fracture lines (or circumocular sutures), so that it has most often broken away from the rest of the cephalon. The glabella tapers forward and is relatively long, with the frontal lobe boss-like or pointy, followed by three rings or pairs of lobes (defined by furrows that may or may not cross over the midline), and finally at the back of the cephalon the so-called occipital ring. On the ventral side of the cephalon, the palate (or hypostome) is attached to the part of the calcified exoskeleton that defines the contour at the ventral side (the so-called doublure), a state called conterminant. The hypostomes of redlichiids have narrow borders, are not split into backward pointing forks, and have only small muscle attachment areas (or maculae). The articulate middle part of the exoskeleton (or thorax) is composed of many of segments that often end in a spine at the side of the animal. To each side of the central axis, the third segment from the front may have an exta large and wide rib (a state called macropleural). The tailshield (or pygidium) is small but appears to be composed of more than one segment. In Olenellina the earliest larval stage (called protaspis) has not been found, so it is presumed it was not calcified. The development of &quot;Redlichia&quot; from protaspis to adult was gradual without a metamorphosis at any stage.

Two major Lagerstätten where redlichiids are found are the Emu Bay shales of Southern Australia and the Maotianshan shales near Chengjiang in China. Other regions include Morocco, Labrador, Canada, the western United States, and Bohemia, Czech Republic.

The appendages have been preserved in a few specimens. They follow typical trilobite patterns in terms of the number, placement, and types of legs, antennae, gills, etc.

The order Redlichiida is divided into two suborders: Olenellina and Redlichiina. The main difference between the two groups is the lack of facial sutures in the Olenellina. This absence of the facial sutures is regarded as primitive by most scholars. Opisthoparian facial sutures are a shared character of all Redlichiina. In other trilobites, dorsal sutures may be opisthoparian, gonatoparian, proparian or they may be lost secondarily. The absence in the fossil record of the earliest larval stage, the protaspid, suggests that it may have been uncalcified, which would be a second unique character that distinguishes the Olenellina from all other trilobites.

Fossils of olenellinid trilobites are found in North America, and other associated areas that comprised the Cambrian continent of Laurentia. They are very common and are used to define the extent of Laurentia. Their abrupt disappearance marks the boundary between the Lower and the Middle Cambrian.

Fossils of redlichiinid are associated with Cambrian regions other than Laurentia.

<text>The Insider is a 1999 American biographical drama film directed by Michael Mann and written by Mann and Eric Roth, based on Marie Brenner&#x27;s 1996 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;. The film stars Al Pacino, Russell Crowe, Christopher Plummer, Bruce McGill, Diane Venora and Michael Gambon.

A fictionalized account of a true story, it centers on the controversial &quot;60 Minutes&quot; segment about Jeffrey Wigand, a whistleblower in the tobacco industry, covering his and CBS producer Lowell Bergman&#x27;s struggles as they defend his testimony against efforts to discredit and suppress it by CBS and Wigand&#x27;s former employer.

Although not a box-office success, &quot;The Insider&quot; received acclaim from critics, who praised Crowe&#x27;s portrayal of Wigand and Mann&#x27;s direction. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor in a Leading Role (for Russell Crowe).

==Plot==
CBS producer Lowell Bergman convinces the founder of Hezbollah, Sheikh Fadlallah, to grant an interview to Mike Wallace for &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. Wallace and Bergman firmly stand their ground against the Sheikh&#x27;s armed and hostile bodyguards, who attempt to intimidate and disrupt their interview preparations.

Later, Bergman approaches Jeffrey Wigand—a former executive at the Brown &amp; Williamson tobacco company—for help explaining technical documents. Wigand agrees but intrigues Bergman when he insists that he will not discuss anything else, citing a confidentiality agreement.

Brown &amp; Williamson coerces Wigand into a more restrictive agreement, leading Wigand to accuse Bergman of betraying him. Bergman subsequently visits Wigand to defend himself and investigate the potential story. Although Wigand apparently possesses very damaging information, he hesitates to reveal anything, fearing that it will jeopardize his severance package from Brown &amp; Williamson. Wigand&#x27;s family moves into a more modest house, and Wigand begins working as a teacher. One night, Wigand finds evidence of trespass and receives a sinister phone call.

Meanwhile, Bergman contacts Richard Scruggs, an attorney representing Mississippi in a lawsuit against the tobacco industry. Bergman suggests that if they depose Wigand, making his information public, it can give CBS cover to broadcast the information; Scruggs expresses interest.

Wigand receives an emailed death threat and finds a bullet in his mailbox. He contacts the FBI, but the agents who visit him are hostile and confiscate his computer. Furious, Wigand demands that Bergman arrange an interview, during which Wigand states that he was fired after objecting to Brown &amp; Williamson intentionally making their cigarettes more addictive.

Bergman arranges a security detail for Wigand&#x27;s home, and the Wigands experience marital stress. Wigand testifies in Mississippi, despite attempts of intimidation and legal suppression by Brown &amp; Williamson attorneys. After returning home, he discovers that his wife Liane has left him and taken their daughters.

Eric Kluster, the president of CBS News, decides not to broadcast Wigand&#x27;s interview after CBS legal counsel Helen Caperelli warns that the network is at risk of legal action from Brown &amp; Williamson. Bergman confronts Kluster, accusing him of sacrificing journalistic integrity to protect the impending sale of CBS to Westinghouse, which would enrich both Kluster and Caperelli. Wallace and their executive producer Don Hewitt both side with Kluster. Wigand, learning of this, is appalled and terminates contact with Bergman.

Investigators probe Wigand&#x27;s personal history and publish their findings in a 500-page dossier. Bergman learns that &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; intends to use it in a piece questioning Wigand&#x27;s credibility. He convinces the &quot;Journal&quot;&#x27;s editor to delay publication and assign journalists to investigate the dossier, claiming that it falsely quotes its sources.

After infighting at CBS over the Wigand segment, Bergman is ordered to take a &quot;vacation&quot; as the abridged &quot;60 Minutes&quot; segment airs. Bergman contacts Wigand, who is both dejected and furious, accusing Bergman of manipulating him. Bergman defends himself and praises Wigand and his testimony. Scruggs urges Bergman to air the full segment to draw public support for their lawsuit, which is under threat from a lawsuit by Mississippi&#x27;s governor. Bergman, frozen out, is unable to assist and privately questions his own motives pursuing the story.

Bergman contacts an editor at &quot;The New York Times&quot;, disclosing the full story and events at CBS. The &quot;Times&quot; prints the story on the front page and condemns CBS in a scathing editorial. The &quot;Journal&quot; dismisses the dossier as character assassination and prints Wigand&#x27;s deposition. Hewitt accuses Bergman of betraying CBS, but finds that Wallace now agrees that bowing to corporate pressure was a mistake. &quot;60 Minutes&quot; finally airs the original segment, including the full interview with Wigand. Bergman tells Wallace that he has resigned, believing that &quot;60 Minutes&quot;&#x27;s credibility and integrity are now permanently tarnished.

==Production==
For the scene in which the deposition hearing takes place, the filmmakers used the actual courtroom in Pascagoula, Mississippi, where the deposition was given.

==Accuracy==

&quot;The Insider&quot; is adapted from &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;, an influential article on tobacco industry whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand, written by journalist Marie Brenner for the May 1996 issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;.

Mike Wallace said that two-thirds of the film was quite accurate, but he disagreed with the film&#x27;s portrayal of his role in the events. In particular, he objected to the impression that he would have taken a long time to protest CBS&#x27;s corporate policies.

==Release==

===Box office===
&quot;The Insider&quot; was released in 1,809 theaters on November 5, 1999, where it grossed a total of $6,712,361 on its opening weekend and ranked fourth in the country for that time period. It went on to earn $29.1 million in North America, and $31.2 million in the rest of the world, for a total of $60.3 million worldwide, significantly lower than its $90 million budget. The film was considered to be a commercial disappointment. Disney executives had hoped that Mann&#x27;s film would have the same commercial and critical success as &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;, a film in the same vein.

However, &quot;The Insider&quot; had limited appeal to younger moviegoers—studio executives reportedly said that the prime audience was over age 40—and the subject matter was &quot;not notably dramatic&quot;, according to marketing executives. Then-Disney chairman Joe Roth said, &quot;It&#x27;s like walking up a hill with a refrigerator on your back. The fact of the matter is we&#x27;re really proud we did this movie. People say it&#x27;s the best movie they&#x27;ve seen this year. They say, &#x27;Why don&#x27;t we make more movies like this?

After the film received seven Academy-Award nominations but won none, Joe Roth said, &quot;Everyone is really proud of the movie. But it&#x27;s one of those rare times when adults loved a movie, yet they couldn&#x27;t convince their friends to go see it, any more than we could convince people in marketing the film.&quot;

===Critical reception===
&quot;The Insider&quot; received some of the best reviews of 1999 and of Michael Mann&#x27;s career. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 96% rating, based on 138 reviews, with an average rating of 8.10/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Intelligent, compelling, and packed with strong performances, &quot;The Insider&quot; is a potent corporate thriller.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a score of 84 out of 100, based on reviews from 34 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;A–&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, and praised &quot;its power to absorb, entertain, and anger&quot;.

&quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine&#x27;s David Ansen wrote, &quot;Mann could probably make a movie about needlepoint riveting. Employing a big canvas, a huge cast of superb character actors and his always exquisite eye for composition, he&#x27;s made the kind of current-events epic that Hollywood has largely abandoned to TV—and shows us how movies can do it better.&quot;

In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin praised Russell Crowe as &quot;a subtle powerhouse in his wrenching evocation of Wigand, takes on the thick, stolid look of the man he portrays&quot;, and felt that it was &quot;by far Mann&#x27;s most fully realized and enthralling work&quot;.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Richard Corliss wrote, &quot;When Crowe gets to command the screen, &quot;The Insider&quot; comes to roiled life. It&#x27;s an &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; in which Deep Throat takes center stage, an insider prodded to spill the truth.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Peter Travers wrote, &quot;With its dynamite performances, strafing wit and dramatic provocation, &quot;The Insider&quot; offers Mann at his best—blood up, unsanitized, and unbowed.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;B&quot; rating, and felt that it was &quot;a good but far from great movie because it presents truth telling in America as far more imperiled than it is&quot;.

Director Quentin Tarantino included &quot;The Insider&quot; in his list of top 20 films released since 1992 (the year he became a director).

===Accolades===
In 2006, &quot;Premiere&quot; ranked Crowe&#x27;s performance #23 of the 100 Greatest Performances of All Time. Eric Roth and Michael Mann won the Humanitas Prize in the Feature Film category in 2000.

<text>Chocolat is a 1999 novel by Joanne Harris. It tells the story of Vianne Rocher, a young single mother who arrives in the French village of Lansquenet-sous-Tannes at the beginning of Lent with her six-year-old daughter Anouk. Vianne has arrived to open a chocolaterie&quot;La Céleste Praline&quot;which is on the square opposite the church. During the traditional season of fasting and self-denial she gently changes the lives of the villagers who visit her with a combination of sympathy, subversion and a little magic.

This scandalises Francis Reynaud, the village priest, and his supporters. As tensions run high, the community is increasingly divided. As Easter approaches the ritual of the Church is pitted against the indulgence of chocolate, and Father Reynaud and Vianne Rocher face an inevitable showdown.

Harris has indicated that several of the characters were influenced by individuals in her life: young Anouk and her imaginary rabbit, Pantoufle, were inspired by Harris&#x27;s own four-year-old child, and Harris&#x27; strong-willed and independent great-grandmother influenced her portrayal of both Vianne and the elderly Armande.

&quot;The Lollipop Shoes&quot;, the first sequel, was published in the United Kingdom in 2007 (released in 2008 as &quot;The Girl with No Shadow&quot; in the US) 
and in 2012, the second sequel was published, entitled &quot;Peaches for Monsieur le Curé&quot;. (&quot;Peaches for Father Francis&quot; in the US), followed by &quot;The Strawberry Thief&quot;, in 2019.

==Plot==
Vianne Rocher, with her daughter Anouk, comes to the small French village of Lansquenet-sous-Tannes. They are brought by &quot;the wind&quot; during the last days of Carnival to open a &quot;chocolaterie&quot;, &quot;La Céleste Praline&quot;. The village priest, Francis Reynaud, is mystified by their arrival because Lent has just begun, but his confusion turns rapidly to anger when he understands that Vianne holds dangerous beliefs, does not obey the church and flouts the unspoken rules that he feels should govern his &quot;flock&quot;.

Vianne, we learn from her personal thoughts, is a witch, though she does not use the word. Her mother and she were wanderers, going from one city to another. Her mother strove to inspire the same need for freedom in her daughter, who is more social and passive. They were born with gifts, and used a kind of &quot;domestic magic&quot; to earn their living. Throughout her life, Vianne has been running from the &quot;Black Man&quot;, a recurring motif in her mother&#x27;s folklore. When her mother dies of terminal cancer, Vianne continues on her own, trying to evade the Black Man and the mysterious force of the wind and settle down to a normal life.

The &quot;chocolaterie&quot; is an old dream of hers. She has an innate talent for cooking and a charming personality. She tries to fit in and help her customers. She starts to build a group of regular customers, including Armande, Guillaume and Narcisse, and, to Reynaud&#x27;s dismay, she doesn&#x27;t go out of business. Reynaud attempts to have Vianne run out of town, and he talks about her every Sunday at church. Some people stay away, but not for long. His conflict with her becomes his personal crusade.

Tensions between them increase when a group of about two dozen river gypsies, led by unflinching and stoic Roux, moor their boats on the nearby river and Vianne and several others welcome them, whereas Reynaud is against their &#x27;immoral&#x27; and &#x27;sinful&#x27; way of life. Reynaud manages to convince most businesses in the village to deny the gypsies their service, although Vianne welcomes them and befriends some members of the group, namely Roux, Zezette and Blanche. In return, they invite her to their own celebrations by the river. However, most of them are forced to move up the river when Monsieur Muscat starts a petrol fire, while Roux squats in one of the derelict houses nearby. He continues doing odd jobs for Vianne, Armande and Narcisse and also comes to Armande&#x27;s birthday party with Zezette and Blanche. Armande dies in her sleep later that night, while Vianne and Roux have sex in the garden after everyone else has gone home.

Vianne also spends a lot of time and effort preparing for the &quot;Grand Festival of Chocolate&quot;, to be held on Easter Sunday, with the help of Josephine, who moves in with her after being convinced to leave her abusive husband. The morning the festival is supposed to take place, Reynaud breaks into the shop and vandalizes the window display, but is caught by Vianne before he can reach the gift boxes in the basement. The festival continues with much success.

==Characters==
*Vianne Rocher, single mother of Anouk who arrives at the village of Lasquennet-sous-les-Tannes and opens a &quot;chocolaterie&quot; at the beginning of Lent. She is described as taller than the average woman, with black curly hair, &quot;dark eyes that seem pupilless&quot;, straight brows that would make her face stern if not for the amused quirk of her mouth, a little too big. Her favourite scent is mimosa. She loves Anouk very much, and her greatest fear is that they will be torn apart, mirroring her late mother&#x27;s fear of being torn from Vianne when she was a child. She has a friendly, charming personality, but stubborn too, and she stands up for her beliefs, in a mild yet firm manner. She also has a keen sense of people and great powers of intuition. At the end of the story, she discovers she is pregnant by Roux, although they will not raise the child together.
*Francis Reynaud, village priest who is in his thirties. He tries to make Vianne and her daughter leave as he believes her shop is inappropriate and better suited for the cities. He comes to believe that she is Satan&#x27;s helper. He is fanatical and puritanical in his beliefs, due to the inspiration of Père Michel, his predecessor, and his troubled childhood. He has a strong sense of dignity, which might be mistaken for pride sometimes, an obsession with following the rules and believes himself superior in terms of moral strength and intellect as he observes with chagrined disdain in one of his confessions. 
*Anouk Rocher, Vianne&#x27;s six-year-old daughter. A precocious child with an imaginary animal friend, called &quot;Pantoufle&quot;, that is also seen by her mother. She often plays near the river with the other children.
*Josephine Muscat, the wife of Paul-Marie Muscat. At the beginning of the book she is a silent fearful figure, the result of the incessant brutal treatment received at the hand of her husband. She starts to hope after Vianne offers her friendship, and finally she leaves her husband. Vianne offers her a job and residence at her chocolaterie, arguing that if she leaves the town, she&#x27;ll never stop running. Under her guidance, Josephine transforms, becoming stronger, more self-confident and charming.
*Paul-Marie Muscat, married to Josephine, using her as his servant. He beats her often and he drinks too much. Under his father&#x27;s guidance he developed a cruel personality that, coupled with his need for vengeance, made him incinerate Roux&#x27;s boat.
*Armande Voizin, mother of Caroline Clairmont who is in her early eighties. The first to anticipate the changes Vianne&#x27;s arrival would bring. She believes Vianne is also a witch, though Vianne doesn&#x27;t agree with the word. They become friends, due to a similarity in personalities and the freedom of spirit they both share. Vianne helps Armande reconnect with her grandson, Luc, and Armande helps Vianne after one of Reynaud&#x27;s strong sermons. She has a secret love of underwear and the poetry of Rimbaud. It is revealed that when she was a very good climber, she would often throw things at passers-by from the trees. She has a strong disdain for Reynaud and some of the villagers that follow him blindly, who she calls &#x27;bible groupies&#x27;. She has diabetes, which she refuses to acknowledge and properly treat and, even after almost going into a diabetic coma, continues gorging on chocolate on a daily basis to the point where she develops diabetic retinopathy and requires a cane to walk around. 
*Caroline Clairmont, one of the &#x27;bible groupies&#x27;. Has a poor relationship with her mother, the result of which was banning Luc from seeing his grandmother. She is superficial and spiteful, and she fusses too much over Armande, a fact which the latter hates. She&#x27;s quick to point out everyone else&#x27;s mistakes but not her own and rarely does anything without expecting something in return.
*Luc Clairmont, Caroline Clairmont&#x27;s thirteen-year-old son, whom she raised with obsessive care. Luc has a penchant for the dark and bizarre which he&#x27;s been hiding for fear of upsetting his mother. He has a stutter, although it lessens in the company of his grandmother, and when he&#x27;s drinking at the party.
*Guillaume, elderly gentleman, devoted to his sick dog, Charly.
*Narcisse, local farmer and florist.
*Roux, red-haired river-gypsy and the biological father of Vianne&#x27;s unborn child.
*Zezette and Blanche, river-gypsies.

==Reception==
&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Observer&quot;, &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;Literary Review&quot;, and &quot;Independent&quot; reviews under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Guardian&quot;, and &quot;TLS&quot; reviews under &quot;Pretty Good&quot; and &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot; review under &quot;Ok&quot;.

It won the Creative Freedom Award (2000) and the Whittaker Gold and Platinum Awards (2001, 2012), selling over a million copies in the UK. In 2012 &quot;The Guardian&quot; placed it at number 61 on a list of the &quot;100 bestselling books of all time.&quot;

It was shortlisted for the Whitbread Prize and the Scripter Award (2001).

Writing for the &quot;Literary Review&quot;, Sophia Watson asked: &quot;Is this the best book ever written?&quot; going on to say: &quot;&quot;&quot;This is a truly excellent book, one of the best it has been my pleasure to read in the line of duty for years. Joanne Harris achieves everything a novelist should aim for, with no sense of effort or striving.&quot; Charles de Lint praised the novel, saying &quot;Harris&#x27;s prose is an absolute delight&quot;, and comparing &quot;Chocolat&quot; to &quot;Like Water for Chocolate,&quot; although Kirkus Reviews described it as &quot;cloying.&quot;

==Setting==

The village of Lansquenet-sous-Tannes is a fictional village in the Gers region of South-Western France, featured in the novels of Joanne Harris. Situated on the (imaginary) river Tannes, a tributary of the Garonne, it is described as &quot;a blip on the fast road between Toulouse and Bordeaux&quot;. A small rural community of only a few hundred people, it is the setting of the novel &quot;Chocolat&quot; as well as Harris&#x27; later novels, Blackberry Wine and Peaches for Monsieur le Curé. There seems to be evidence to suggest that Lansquenet-sous-Tannes was based on the town of Nérac, on the river Baïse, where Harris spent some of her childhood holidays, and which is very close to a tiny village called Vianne.

The name of Lansquenet-sous-Tannes is ambiguous. The word &quot;lansquenet&quot; refers to an old card game. Lansquenet is portrayed as an insular, close community, run by gossip and the Church.

Most of the inhabitants are elderly; young people have mostly moved to the towns and cities to find work. It is an old bastide and retains the fortress mentality of its past. Outsiders are not welcome; old grudges linger; the inhabitants of neighbouring villages are seen as traditional enemies. Similarly in &quot;Peaches for Monsieur le Curé&quot;, the presence of a community of Moroccan immigrants, with their new customs and different religious beliefs, causes friction. Lansquenet has acquired a significant following among Harris&#x27; readers. In a piece written for the &quot;Telegraph&quot; in July 2012, she describes her own affection for Lansquenet, as well as that of her readers, many of whom have written to her to say that they have found the place, and therefore know that it exists.

==Film adaptation==
The film adaptation was released in 2000, directed by Lasse Hallström and starring Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina, Lena Olin and Johnny Depp. It was nominated for 8 BAFTAS and 5 Oscars.

<doc id="142473" wikidata="Q188913" url="?curid=142473" title="Plantation">
<text>Plantations are farms specializing in cash crops, usually mainly planting a single crop, with perhaps ancillary areas for vegetables for eating and so on. Plantations, centered on a plantation house, grow crops including cotton, cannabis, coffee, tea, cocoa, sugar cane, opium, sisal, oil seeds, oil palms, fruits, rubber trees and forest trees. Protectionist policies and natural comparative advantage have sometimes contributed to determining where plantations are located.

In modern use, the term usually refers only to large-scale estates. Before about 1860, it was the usual term for a farm of any size in the southern parts of British North America, with, as Noah Webster noted, &quot;farm&quot; becoming the usual term from about Maryland northward. The enslavement of people was the norm in Maryland and states southward. The plantations there were forced-labor farms. The term &quot;plantation&quot; was used in most British colonies but very rarely in the United Kingdom itself in this sense. There it was used mainly for tree plantations, areas artificially planted with trees, whether purely for commercial forestry, or partly for ornamental effect in gardens and parks, when it might also cover plantings of garden shrubs.

Among the earliest examples of plantations were the latifundia of the Roman Empire, which produced large quantities of grain, wine, and olive oil for export. Plantation agriculture proliferated with the increase in international trade and the development of a worldwide economy that followed the expansion of European colonialism.

==By crop==

=== Tree plantations ===
Tree plantations, in the United States often called tree farms, are established for the commercial production of timber or tree products such as palm oil, coffee, or rubber. 

Teak and bamboo plantations in India have given good results and an alternative crop solution to farmers of central India, where conventional farming was widespread. But due to the rising input costs of agriculture, many farmers have done teak and bamboo plantations, which require very little water (only during the first two years). Teak and bamboo have legal protection from theft. Bamboo, once planted, gives output for 50 years till flowering occurs. Teak requires 20 years to grow to full maturity and fetch returns.

These may be established for watershed or soil protection. They are established for erosion control, landslide stabilization, and windbreaks. Such plantations are established to foster native species and promote forest regeneration on degraded lands as a tool of environmental restoration.

===Sugar===

Sugar plantations were highly valued in the Caribbean by the British and French colonists in the 17th and 18th centuries, and the use of sugar in Europe rose during this period. Sugarcane is still an important crop in Cuba. Sugar plantations also arose in countries such as Barbados and Cuba because of the natural endowments that they had. These natural endowments included soil conducive to growing sugar and a high marginal product of labor realized through the increasing number of enslaved people.

===Rubber===

Plantings of the Pará rubber tree (&quot;Hevea brasiliensis&quot;) are usually called anything

===Oil palm plants===
Oil palm agriculture rapidly expands across wet tropical regions and is usually developed at a plantation scale.

===Orchards===
Fruit orchards are plantations of woody trees of fruits or nuts.

===Arable crops===
These include tobacco, sugarcane, pineapple, bell pepper, and cotton, especially in historical usage.

Before the rise of cotton in the American South, indigo and rice were also sometimes called plantation crops.
== Ecological impact ==
Probably the most critical factor a plantation has on the local environment is the site where the plantation is established. In Brazil, coffee plantations would use slash-and-burn agriculture, tearing down rainforests and planting coffee trees that depleted the nutrients in soil. Once the soil had been sapped, growers would move on to another place. If a natural forest is cleared for a planted forest, then a reduction in biodiversity and loss of habitat will likely result. In some cases, their establishment may involve draining wetlands to replace mixed hardwoods that formerly predominated with pine species.
If a plantation is established on abandoned agricultural land or highly degraded land, it can increase both habitat and biodiversity. A planted forest can be profitably established on lands that will not support agriculture or suffer from a lack of natural regeneration.

The tree species used in a plantation are also an important factor. Where non-native varieties or species are grown, few native faunas are adapted to exploit these, and further biodiversity loss occurs. However, even non-native tree species may serve as corridors for wildlife and act as a buffer for native forests, reducing edge effect.

Once a plantation is established, managing it becomes an important environmental factor. The most critical aspect of management is the rotation period. Plantations harvested on more extended rotation periods (30 years or more) can provide similar benefits to a naturally regenerated forest managed for wood production on a similar rotation. This is especially true if native species are used. In the case of exotic species, the habitat can be improved significantly if the impact is mitigated by measures such as leaving blocks of native species in the plantation or retaining corridors of natural forest. In Brazil, similar measures are required by government regulation.

==Slave plantation==

Plantation owners extensively used enslaved Africans to work on early plantations (such as tobacco, rice, cotton, hemp, and sugar plantations) in the American colonies and the United States, throughout the Caribbean, the Americas, and in European-occupied areas of Africa.

In modern times, the low wages typically paid to plantation workers are the basis of plantation profitability in some areas.

In more recent times, overt slavery has been replaced by &quot;para-slavery&quot; or &quot;slavery-in-kind&quot;, including the sharecropping system, and even that has been severely reduced. At its most extreme, workers are in &quot;debt bondage&quot;: they must work to pay off a debt at such punitive interest rates that it may never be paid off. Others work unreasonably long hours and are paid subsistence wages that (in practice) may only be spent in the company store.

In Brazil, a sugarcane plantation was termed an &quot;engenho&quot; (&quot;engine&quot;), and the 17th-century English usage for organized colonial production was &quot;factory.&quot; Such colonial social and economic structures are discussed at Plantation economy.

Sugar workers on plantations in Cuba and elsewhere in the Caribbean lived in company towns known as &quot;bateyes&quot;.

===Fishing===
When Newfoundland was colonized by England in 1610, the original colonists were called &quot;planters&quot;, and their fishing rooms were known as &quot;fishing plantations&quot;. These terms were used well into the 20th century.

The following three plantations are maintained by the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador as provincial heritage sites:
* Sea-Forest Plantation was a 17th-century fishing plantation established at Cuper&#x27;s Cove (present-day Cupids) under a royal charter issued by King James I.
* Mockbeggar Plantation is an 18th-century fishing plantation at Bonavista.
* Pool Plantation a 17th-century fishing plantation maintained by Sir David Kirke and his heirs at Ferryland. The plantation was destroyed by French invaders in 1696.

Other fishing plantations:
* Bristol&#x27;s Hope Plantation, a 17th-century fishing plantation established at Harbour Grace, created by the Bristol Society of Merchant-Adventurers.
* Benger Plantation, an 18th-century fishing plantation maintained by James Benger and his heirs at Ferryland. It was built on the site of a Georgia plantation.
* Piggeon&#x27;s Plantation, an 18th-century fishing plantation maintained by Ellias Piggeon at Ferryland.

<text>Papermaking is the manufacture of paper and cardboard, which are used widely for printing, writing, and packaging, among many other purposes. Today almost all paper is made using industrial machinery, while handmade paper survives as a specialized craft and a medium for artistic expression.

In papermaking, a dilute suspension consisting mostly of separate cellulose fibres in water is drained through a sieve-like screen, so that a mat of randomly interwoven fibres is laid down. Water is further removed from this sheet by pressing, sometimes aided by suction or vacuum, or heating. Once dry, a generally flat, uniform and strong sheet of paper is achieved.

Before the invention and current widespread adoption of automated machinery, all paper was made by hand, formed or laid one sheet at a time by specialized laborers. Even today those who make paper by hand use tools and technologies quite similar to those existing hundreds of years ago, as originally developed in China and other regions of Asia, or those further modified in Europe. Handmade paper is still appreciated for its distinctive uniqueness and the skilled craft involved in making each sheet, in contrast with the higher degree of uniformity and perfection at lower prices achieved among industrial products.

== History ==
The word &quot;paper&quot; is etymologically derived from papyrus, Ancient Greek for the &quot;Cyperus papyrus&quot; plant. Papyrus is a thick, paper-like material produced from the pith of the &quot;Cyperus papyrus&quot; plant which was used in ancient Egypt and other Mediterranean societies for writing long before paper was used in China. Papyrus is prepared by cutting off thin ribbon-like strips of the pith (interior) of the &quot;Cyperus papyrus&quot; plant and then laying out the strips side-by-side to make a sheet. A second layer is then placed on top, with the strips running perpendicular to the first. The two layers are then pounded together using a mallet to make a sheet. The result is very strong, but has an uneven surface, especially at the edges of the strips. When used in scrolls, repeated rolling and unrolling causes the strips to come apart again, typically along vertical lines. This effect can be seen in many ancient papyrus documents.

Hemp paper had been used in China for wrapping and padding since the eighth century BC. Paper with legible Chinese writings on it has been dated to 8 BC.
The traditional inventor attribution is of Cai Lun, an official attached to the Imperial court during the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 CE), said to have invented paper about 105 CE using mulberry and other bast fibres along with fishnets, old rags, and hemp waste. Paper used as a writing medium had become widespread by the 3rd century and, by the 6th century, toilet paper was starting to be used in China as well. During the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE) paper was folded and sewn into square bags to preserve the flavour of tea, while the later Song dynasty (960–1279 CE) was the first government to issue paper-printed money.

In the 8th century, papermaking spread to the Islamic world, where the process was refined, and machinery was designed for bulk manufacturing. Production began in Samarkand, Baghdad, Damascus, Cairo, Morocco, and then Muslim Spain. In Baghdad, papermaking was under the supervision of the Grand Vizier Ja&#x27;far ibn Yahya. Muslims invented a method to make a thicker sheet of paper. This innovation helped transform papermaking from an art into a major industry. The earliest use of water-powered mills in paper production, specifically the use of pulp mills for preparing the pulp for papermaking, dates back to Samarkand in the 8th century. The earliest references to paper mills also come from the medieval Islamic world, where they were first noted in the 9th century by Arabic geographers in Damascus.

Traditional papermaking in Asia uses the inner bark fibers of plants. This fiber is soaked, cooked, rinsed and traditionally hand-beaten to form the paper pulp. The long fibers are layered to form strong, translucent sheets of paper. In Eastern Asia, three traditional fibers are abaca, kōzo and gampi. In the Himalayas, paper is made from the lokta plant. This paper is used for calligraphy, printing, book arts, and three-dimensional work, including origami.

In Europe, papermaking moulds using metallic wire were developed, and features like the watermark were well established by 1300 CE, while hemp and linen rags were the main source of pulp, cotton eventually taking over after Southern plantations made that product in large quantities. Papermaking was originally not popular in Europe due to not having many advantages over papyrus and parchment. It was not until the 15th century with the invention of the movable type of printing and its demand for paper that many paper mills entered production, and papermaking became an industry.

Modern papermaking began in the early 19th century in Europe with the development of the Fourdrinier machine. This machine produces a continuous roll of paper rather than individual sheets. These machines are large. Some produce paper 150 meters in length and 10 meters wide. They can produce paper at a rate of 100 km/h. In 1844, Canadian Charles Fenerty and German Friedrich Gottlob Keller had invented the machine and associated process to make use of wood pulp in papermaking. This innovation ended the nearly 2,000-year use of pulped rags and start a new era for the production of newsprint and eventually almost all paper was made out of pulped wood.

== Manual ==
Papermaking, regardless of the scale on which it is done, involves making a dilute suspension of fibres in water, called &quot;furnish&quot;, and forcing this suspension to drain through a screen, to produce a mat of interwoven fibres. Water is removed from this mat of fibres using a press.

The method of manual papermaking changed very little over time, despite advances in technologies. The process of manufacturing handmade paper can be generalized into five steps:
# Separating the useful fibre from the rest of raw materials. (e.g. cellulose from wood, cotton, etc.)
# Beating down the fibre into pulp
# Adjusting the colour, mechanical, chemical, biological, and other properties of the paper by adding special chemical premixes
# Screening the resulting solution
# Pressing and drying to get the actual paper
Screening the fibre involves using a mesh made from non-corroding and inert material, such as brass, stainless steel or a synthetic fibre, which is stretched in a paper mould, a wooden frame similar to that of a window. The size of the paper is governed by the open area of the frame. The mould is then completely submerged in the furnish, then pulled, shaken and drained, forming a uniform coating on the screen. Excess water is then removed, the wet mat of fibre laid on top of a damp cloth or felt in a process called &quot;couching&quot;. The process is repeated for the required number of sheets. This stack of wet mats is then pressed in a hydraulic press. The fairly damp fibre is then dried using a variety of methods, such as vacuum drying or simply air drying. Sometimes, the individual sheet is rolled to flatten, harden, and refine the surface. Finally, the paper is then cut to the desired shape or the standard shape (A4, letter, legal, etc.) and packed.

The wooden frame is called a &quot;deckle&quot;. The deckle leaves the edges of the paper slightly irregular and wavy, called &quot;deckle edges&quot;, one of the indications that the paper was made by hand. Deckle-edged paper is occasionally mechanically imitated today to create the impression of old-fashioned luxury. The impressions in paper caused by the wires in the screen that run sideways are called &quot;laid lines&quot; and the impressions made, usually from top to bottom, by the wires holding the sideways wires together are called &quot;chain lines&quot;. Watermarks are created by weaving a design into the wires in the mould. Handmade paper generally folds and tears more evenly along the laid lines.

The International Association of Hand Papermakers and Paper Artists (IAPMA) is the world-leading association for handmade paper artists.

Handmade paper is also prepared in laboratories to study papermaking and in paper mills to check the quality of the production process. The &quot;handsheets&quot; made according to TAPPI Standard T 205
 are circular sheets 15.9 cm (6.25 in) in diameter and are tested for paper characteristics such as brightness, strength and degree of sizing.
Paper made from other fibers, cotton being the most common, tends to be valued higher than wood-based paper.

== Industrial ==

A modern paper mill is divided into several sections, roughly corresponding to the processes involved in making handmade paper. Pulp is refined and mixed in water with other additives to make a pulp slurry. The head-box of the paper machine called Fourdrinier machine distributes the slurry onto a moving continuous screen, water drains from the slurry by gravity or under vacuum, the wet paper sheet goes through presses and dries, and finally rolls into large rolls. The outcome often weighs several tons.

Another type of paper machine, invented by John Dickinson in 1809, makes use of a cylinder mould that rotates while partially immersed in a vat of dilute pulp. The pulp is picked up by the wire mesh and covers the mould as it rises out of the vat. A couch roller is pressed against the mould to smooth out the pulp, and picks the wet sheet off the mould.

Papermaking continues to be of concern from an environmental perspective, due to its use of harsh chemicals, its need for large amounts of water, and the resulting contamination risks, as well as the carbon sequestration lost by deforestation caused by clearcutting the trees used as the primary source of wood pulp.

==Notable papermakers==

While papermaking was considered a lifework, exclusive profession for most of its history, the term &quot;notable papermakers&quot; is often not strictly limited to those who actually make paper. Especially in the hand papermaking field there is currently an overlap of certain celebrated paper art practitioners with their other artistic pursuits, while in academia the term may be applied to those conducting research, education, or conservation of books and paper artifacts. In the industrial field it tends to overlap with science, technology and engineering, and often with management of the pulp and paper business itself.

Some well-known and recognized papermakers have found fame in other fields, to the point that their papermaking background is almost forgotten. One of the most notable examples might be that of the first humans that achieved flight, the Montgolfier brothers, where many accounts barely mention the paper mill their family owned, although paper used in their balloons did play a relevant role in their success, as probably did their familiarity with this light and strong material.

Key inventors include James Whatman, Henry Fourdrinier, Heinrich Voelter and Carl Daniel Ekman, among others.

By the mid-19th century, making paper by hand was extinct in the United States. By 1912, fine book printer and publisher, Dard Hunter had reestablished the craft of fine hand paper making but by the 1930s the craft had lapsed in interest again. When artist Douglass Howell returned to New York City after serving in World War II, he established himself as a fine art printmaker and discovered that art paper was in short supply. During the 1940s and 1950s, Howell started reading Hunter&#x27;s books on paper making, as well as he learned about hand paper making history, conducted paper making research, and learned about printed books.

<text>Gosford Park is a 2001 satirical black comedy mystery film directed by Robert Altman and written by Julian Fellowes. The film, which is influenced by Jean Renoir&#x27;s French classic &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot;, follows a party of wealthy Britons plus an American producer, and their servants, who gather for a shooting weekend at Gosford Park, an English country house. A murder occurs after a dinner party, and the film goes on to present the subsequent investigation from the servants&#x27; and guests&#x27; perspectives.

The film stars an ensemble cast, which includes Eileen Atkins, Bob Balaban, Alan Bates, Charles Dance, Stephen Fry, Michael Gambon, Richard E. Grant, Derek Jacobi, Kelly Macdonald, Helen Mirren, Jeremy Northam, Clive Owen, Ryan Phillippe, Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Emily Watson. The film is an international co-production of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Italy.

Development on &quot;Gosford Park&quot; began in 1999, when Bob Balaban asked Altman if they could develop a film together. Balaban suggested an Agatha Christiestyle whodunit and introduced Altman to Julian Fellowes, with whom Balaban had been working on a different project. The film went into production in March 2001, and began filming at Shepperton Studios with a production budget of $19.8 million. &quot;Gosford Park&quot; premiered on 7 November 2001 at the London Film Festival. It received a limited release across cinemas in the United States in December 2001, before being widely released in January 2002 by USA Films. It was released in February 2002 in the United Kingdom.

The film was successful at the box office, grossing over $87 million in cinemas worldwide, making it Altman&#x27;s second-most successful film after &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. Widely acclaimed by critics, &quot;Gosford Park&quot; was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Supporting Actress for both Mirren and Smith, and won Best Original Screenplay; it was also nominated for nine British Academy Film Awards, winning two.

The TV series &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; – written and created by Fellowes – was originally planned as a spin-off of &quot;Gosford Park&quot;, but instead was developed as a standalone property inspired by the film, and set earlier in the 20th century (from 1912 to the mid-1920s).

==Plot==
In 1932, Sir William McCordle, his wife Lady Sylvia, and their daughter Isobel host a shooting party at their country estate, Gosford Park. Among the guests are Sylvia&#x27;s sisters Louisa and Lavinia, and their husbands Lord Stockbridge and Commander Anthony Meredith; her aunt Constance, Countess of Trentham; the Hon. Freddie and Mabel Nesbitt; actor Ivor Novello and American film producer Morris Weissman. Lord Rupert Standish and Jeremy Blond arrive later. 

Mrs Wilson, the housekeeper, assigns the visiting servants to their rooms and overhears Robert Parks, Lord Stockbridge&#x27;s valet, mention being raised in an orphanage. Head housemaid Elsie tutors Lady Trentham&#x27;s inexperienced maid, Mary MacEachran.

Following dinner, a silver carving knife is missing. Henry Denton, Weissman&#x27;s valet, raises the staff&#x27;s suspicions with intrusive questions and a seemingly Scottish accent (which Mary, Scottish herself, sees through). Later that evening, Henry has a tryst with Lady Sylvia. Isobel asks Elsie to speak to Sir William about hiring Freddie, who is blackmailing Isobel over their affair and her aborted pregnancy. Freddie mistreats Mabel, whom he married for her money but overestimated her wealth. Lady Trentham confides to Mary that Sylvia and Louisa cut cards to decide which of them would marry Sir William.

When the men go shooting, a stray shot grazes Sir William&#x27;s ear. The ladies join them for lunch, and Sir William withdraws from Anthony&#x27;s business scheme, leaving him financially ruined. Lady Sylvia informs her aunt Constance that Sir William may halt her allowance.

During dinner, Lady Sylvia berates Sir William and Elsie comes to his defence, inadvertently exposing their affair. After dinner, Sir William retires alone to his study for the rest of the evening, where Mrs Wilson brings him coffee. The guests gather in the drawing room as Novello plays the piano and sings, with the servants listening outside; Freddie, Anthony, Robert, and footman George each slip away. A man, seen only by his trousers, puts on muddy galoshes left by one of the shooting party. The man enters the library with the missing carving knife and, finding Sir William seemingly asleep in his chair, stabs him in the chest.

After the body is discovered, bumbling Inspector Thompson and competent Constable Dexter arrive to investigate. It is discovered that Sir William was poisoned before being stabbed. Mrs Croft, the head cook, tells her staff about Sir William&#x27;s history of seducing his female factory workers; those who became pregnant were forced to give their babies up for adoption or lose their jobs. Isobel gives Freddie a cheque, which he angrily tears up when confronted by Mabel. Inspector Thompson releases the guests without interviewing most of the staff.

Mary deduces that Lord Stockbridge&#x27;s valet is the killer. When she confronts Parks, he reveals that he is the illegitimate son of Sir William and that his mother was one of his factory workers who died soon after Sir William turned him over to an orphanage. It also becomes clear that since Parks did not poison Sir William, he must already have been dead when he was stabbed. Parks tells Mary that he is glad that Sir William is dead and does not care who was responsible.

As the guests and their servants depart, Freddie, his blackmail scheme with Isobel having failed, pursues a partnership with Anthony, whose business venture has been saved by Sir William&#x27;s death. Despite his fondness for her, Rupert&#x27;s courtship of Isobel is abruptly ended when she overhears his conversation with Mr Blond about the limits on her inheritance.

Lady Trentham and Lady Sylvia discuss Mrs Croft and Mrs Wilson&#x27;s long-standing feud, and Lady Sylvia reveals that Mrs Wilson&#x27;s surname used to be Parks. Mary speaks to Mrs Wilson, who admits that she and Mrs Croft are sisters and both had children by Sir William while working at his factory. Mrs Croft kept her baby and lost her job, though the child died in infancy, while Mrs Wilson gave up Robert (Parks). Realizing Parks was her son and that he intended to kill his father, she poisoned Sir William to ensure his only crime would be stabbing a dead body. Mrs Croft comforts Mrs Wilson as Mary says goodbye to Robert, and the last guests leave.

==Themes==
The film is a study of the British class system during the 1930s; Stephen Fry, Inspector Thompson in the film, says that it shows the upper class&#x27;s dependency on a servant class. A number of secondary themes are also explored. For example, the film takes a subtle look at sexual mores during the 1930s. As it is set in 1932, between the world wars, the impact of the First World War is explored in the film&#x27;s screenplay. It mentions the decline of the British Empire and the peerage system. Writing for PopMatters, Cynthia Fuchs described surface appearances, rather than complex interpersonal relationships, as a theme of the film.

Salon.com critic Steven Johnson notes a revival of the manor house mystery style, popularised by the writings of Agatha Christie, in the screenplay for &quot;Gosford Park&quot;. He called it a blend between this literary style and that of the 19th century novel. Bob Balaban, an actor and producer for &quot;Gosford Park&quot;, says that the idea of creating a murder mystery told by the servants in the manor was an interesting one for him and Altman.

Themes from the film were picked up and integrated into the series &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; by Julian Fellowes. Maggie Smith starred again in her role as a dowager countess, this time her title not being &quot;Trentham&quot; but &quot;Grantham&quot;; the family are related to the &quot;Marquess&quot; (rather than the Earl) of Flintshire.

==Production==
===Development and writing===
In 1999, Bob Balaban asked Robert Altman if there were something they could develop together, and Altman suggested a whodunit. Altman wanted to create an Agatha Christielike country house murder mystery that explored that way of life; he called the film a &quot;classic situation: all suspects under one roof&quot;. Altman was also inspired by the 1930s films &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; and &quot;Charlie Chan in London.&quot; Altman chose British actor and writer Julian Fellowes to write the screenplay, because Fellowes knew how country houses operated. Fellowes, who had never written a feature film before, received a telephone call from Altman, who asked him to come up with some characters and stories. Fellowes was given a brief outline of the film: it was to be &quot;set in a country house in the &#x27;30s and to have a murder in there somewhere, but for it to really be an examination of class.&quot; Altman also wanted the film to explore the three groups of people: the family, the guests, and the servants. Of the call, Fellowes said, &quot;All the way through I thought this can&#x27;t be happening—a 50-year-old fat balding actor is phoned up by an American movie director—but I did work as if it was going to happen.&quot;

The original title of the film was &quot;The Other Side of the Tapestry,&quot; but Altman thought it was awkward. Fellowes began looking through some books and came up with &quot;Gosford Park.&quot; Altman said: &quot;Nobody liked it, everyone fought me on it. But when you make a picture using a name, that&#x27;s its name. It&#x27;s not a gripping title. But then &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; wasn&#x27;t either.&quot;

Fellowes says the screenplay was &quot;not an homage to Agatha Christie, but a reworking of that genre.&quot; Fellowes was credited not only as the film&#x27;s writer but as a technical advisor as well, meaning he wrote portions of the film as it was being produced. He notes that in certain large scenes with many characters, the actors were left room to improvise.

Arthur Inch, the retired butler of Sir Richard and Lady Kleinwort, was the consultant on correct procedures and arrangements for dining on the set. Inch is credited as &quot;Butler&quot; immediately before Altman as Director in the final credits. Ruth Mott was the consultant for the kitchen, and Violet Liddle for the parlour maids.

===Casting===
In &quot;Gosford Park&quot;, as in many of his other films, Altman had a list of actors he intended to appear in the film before it was cast formally. The film&#x27;s casting director was Mary Selway, whom producer David Levy described as knowing many British actors. Very few actors who were offered parts did not end up in the film. Jude Law dropped out of the production just before the shoot began, and he was replaced by Ryan Phillippe. Kenneth Branagh and Robert Bathurst were both tied down by scheduling conflicts. Alan Rickman, Joely Richardson and Judi Dench were also considered for roles in the film. The cast is notable for featuring two knights (Michael Gambon and Derek Jacobi) and two dames (Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith). Alan Bates and Stephen Fry would later be knighted and Helen Mirren and Kristin Scott Thomas made dames.

===Filming and editing===

Filming was conducted at Wrotham Park, a country house to the north of London, for the exteriors, staircase, dining room and drawing room, and Syon House in west London for the upstairs bedrooms. The opening sequence outside Lady Trentham&#x27;s home was shot at Hall Barn, near Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, whose grounds were also used as the scene for lunch after the shoot. Sound stages were built to film the scenes of the manor&#x27;s downstairs area. Shepperton Studios was used for off-location filming. Filming began on 19 March 2001. During production, Stephen Frears acted as a standby director, ready to replace Altman in case he was incapacitated, so that the film would receive insurance.

The film was shot with two cameras, both moving perpetually in opposite directions. The cameras pointed toward no specific area, intended to cause the audience to move their eyes throughout the scene. Altman notes that most of the film&#x27;s cast had experience in theatre and in film, meaning they had acted in situations where the view of the audience is not on one specific actor, and each audience member sees a slightly different image of the players on stage. Richard E. Grant commented that having two cameras moving at any one time meant that none of the actors knew when the cameras were focused on them. As a result, the actors had to stay &quot;completely in character, completely in the moment, and interact with everybody in a way that felt as close to real life as you could possibly conjure up.&quot; Andrew Dunn, the film&#x27;s cinematographer, appreciated the co-operative nature of &quot;Gosford Park&quot;″s filming process. He shot the film on Kodak Vision Expression 500T film stock generally with two Panavision cameras, using lighting ranging from relatively dim candles to bright hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide lamps. Editor Tim Squyres described the editing process on &quot;Gosford Park&quot; as an unusual one, as the dual cameras used were generally located in the same areas when filming, instead of the more standard method of setting up a scene directly.

===Soundtrack===

Patrick Doyle composed the film&#x27;s score. Doyle said that it can take him up to six months to create a film score, but Altman asked him to write and compose the music for &quot;Gosford Park&quot; in less than five weeks. Doyle recorded the soundtrack at the London Air-Edel Recording Studios in October 2001. The soundtrack also features six original songs by composer and playwright Ivor Novello. Jeremy Northam, who plays Novello, sings five of the songs and his brother, Christopher, accompanies him on the piano. Christopher also performs one Novello song as a piano solo. The soundtrack was released on 15 January 2002.

==Release==

===Premiere and theatrical release===
&quot;Gosford Park&quot; premiered on 7 November 2001 at the London Film Festival. The film then received a limited release across cinemas in the United States on 26 December 2001, before being widely released in January 2002 by USA Films. It was released on 1 February 2002 in the United Kingdom.

===Home media===
The VHS and region 1 DVD of &quot;Gosford Park&quot; were released on 25 June 2002 by Universal Studios Home Video, with the region 2 release on 3 December 2002. The critic Ed Gonzalez reviewed the DVD negatively, calling the picture quality &quot;atrocious on the small screen&quot;, going on to say that &quot;the image quality of this video transfer is downright lousy from start to finish.&quot; However, reviewer Robert Mack generally wrote favourably of the picture quality, noting excellence in the shots&#x27; detail and sharpness and the lack of compression artefacts, but describing an unfavourable darkness to scenes filmed within the manor house. Both reviewers commented positively on the film&#x27;s score and soundtrack. Gonzalez wrote that &quot;&quot;Gosford Park&quot; sounds amazing for a film so dialogue-dependent&quot; and Mack that &quot;the audio transfer is about as good as it can get on a movie of this style.&quot;

On 26 November 2018, Arrow Films released a newly restored 2K remaster, taken from a 4K print of &quot;Gosford Park&quot;, on Limited Edition Blu-ray in the UK.

==Reception==

===Box office===
In its limited release opening weekend, the film grossed $241,219, hitting No. 23 in the box office that weekend. In its wide release, it grossed $3,395,759; by the end of its run on 6 June 2002, &quot;Gosford Park&quot; grossed $41,308,615 in the domestic box office and a worldwide total of $87,754,044. With that final total, &quot;Gosford Park&quot; became Altman&#x27;s second-most successful film at the box office after his 1970 film &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;.

===Critical response===
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 87% of 165 critics have given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;A mixture of &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;; &quot;Clue&quot;; and perceptive social commentary, &quot;Gosford Park&quot; ranks among director Altman&#x27;s best.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 90 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Roger Ebert awarded it his four out of four stars, describing the story as &quot;such a joyous and audacious achievement it deserves comparison with his [Robert Altman&#x27;s] very best movies.&quot; Ebert specifically noted a quality of the film that many Altman films share: a focus on character rather than plot. Emanuel Levy gave &quot;Gosford Park&quot; an A minus rating, describing one of its themes as &quot;illuminating a society and a way of life on the verge of extinction&quot;, placing the interwar setting as an integral part of the film&#x27;s class study. However, he notes that because Altman is an independent observer of the society he portrays in the film, it does not have the biting qualities of his previous social commentaries such as &quot;Short Cuts&quot;, set in the director&#x27;s home country of the United States. Jonathan Rosenbaum in the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; called it a masterpiece.

&quot;Gosford Park&quot;″s cinematography was a focus of several critics. CNN&#x27;s Paul Clinton praised Andrew Dunn&#x27;s camera work, describing it as &quot;lush and rich; the camera glides up and down the stairs of the grand estate, the period look is beautifully crafted.&quot; Ed Gonzalez of the online publication &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; writes that &quot;Altman&#x27;s camera is the star of &quot;Gosford Park&quot;&quot; and that the film&#x27;s cinematography is used as an aid to its storytelling. Michael Phillips placed &quot;Gosford Park&quot; at number nine on his list of Best Films of the Decade. The film was placed at 82 on Slant Magazine&#x27;s list of best films of the 2000s.

===Accolades and awards===

&quot;Gosford Park&quot; was nominated for 61 different awards following its release, winning 25 of them. There were seven nominations for Academy Awards (including Best Picture and Best Director, both of which it lost to &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;); Fellowes won the Best Original Screenplay. At the 55th British Academy Film Awards, the film was nominated for nine British Academy awards, winning Best British Film and Best Costume Design (Jenny Beavan). Mirren, Smith and Watson were all nominated for Best European Actress at the European Film Awards. The film received five nominations at the 59th Golden Globe Awards; Altman won the Award for &#x27;Best Director&#x27;.

At the 8th Screen Actors Guild Awards Mirren won &#x27;Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role&#x27; and the ensemble cast collectively won &#x27;Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture&#x27;. The film won four more &#x27;Best Cast&#x27; awards from the Broadcast Film Critics Association, Florida Film Critics Circle, and Online Film Critics Society. Fellowes received recognition for the film&#x27;s screenplay from the Writers Guild of America, where he won the Best Original Screenplay award. The film&#x27;s score composer, Patrick Doyle, received two nominations for his work. Doyle was nominated for Composer of the Year from the American Film Institute and he won the award for Soundtrack Composer of the Year from the World Soundtrack Awards.

<text>Massimo Troisi (; 19 February 1953 – 4 June 1994) was an Italian actor, cabaret performer, comedian, screenwriter and film director. He is best known for his works in the films &quot;I&#x27;m Starting back from Three&quot; (1981) and &quot;Il Postino: The Postman&quot; (1994), for which he was posthumously nominated for two Oscars. Nicknamed &quot;the comedian of feelings&quot;, he is considered one of the most important actors of Italian theater and cinema.

== Early years and TV star ==
Troisi was born into a large family in San Giorgio a Cremano, a town near Naples. His father Alfredo was a train engineer. Some of his family experiences were later told in his first films. After secondary school, Troisi wrote some poems inspired by his favourite author, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and, in 1969, started to play in a small local theatre together with some childhood friends (including Lello Arena and Enzo Decaro). The early death of his mother condemned Troisi to a harsh period of activity, which is said to have had a role in the development of his increasingly serious heart problems which were brought on during his teenage years from bouts of rheumatic fever. (In 1976 he had to visit the United States for a heart valve operation, the expenses for which were paid with the help of his friends.)

Troisi started his artistic career as a cabaret showman in 1972, as a member of the comic trio called &quot;I Saraceni&quot; (&quot;The Saracens&quot;) and, later, &quot;La Smorfia&quot; (from the name of the &quot;book of the numbers&quot; traditionally used in Naples for lottery and tombola, but also meaning &quot;the face&quot;, as in &quot;to make a face&quot;). His mates were De Caro and Arena. They gained national fame on the radio and increased it consistently from 1977 onwards eventually becoming TV stars with the shows &quot;Non Stop&quot;, &quot;La sberla&quot; (1978) and &quot;Luna Park&quot; (1979). Troisi soon gained the status of leader of the trio. He was noted for his use of facial mimicry and of apparently confused speech—in these he drew inspiration from such famous figures of Neapolitan comedy as Totò, and Eduardo and Peppino De Filippo.

== Cinema ==
Troisi wrote, directed, and starred in his first film, &quot;Ricomincio da tre&quot; (&quot;I Start Over from Three&quot;) in 1981. He achieved wide success and critical praise, establishing himself as one of the most talented new Italian directors of the 1980s. Like his second film, &quot;Ricomincio da tre&quot; is centered on the troublesome love life of a Neapolitan character, partly inspired by Troisi&#x27;s youth, as well as featuring Lello Arena. &quot;Scusate il ritardo&quot;, similar to the preceding one, was released in 1983, and had Giuliana De Sio as co-star.

Troisi starred opposite Roberto Benigni in &quot;Non ci resta che piangere&quot; (1984), in which they play two friends who are accidentally transported back in time to the 15th century; there they meet Leonardo da Vinci and, upon realising which age they are in, travel to Spain to try to stop Christopher Columbus from discovering the Americas.

After some small acting roles, in 1987 Troisi directed &quot;Le vie del Signore sono finite&quot;, set during the Fascist era. The film won a Silver Ribbon for best screenplay. In the following years, he starred alongside Marcello Mastroianni, in Ettore Scola&#x27;s &quot;Splendor&quot; (1989), &quot;Che ora è?&quot; (1989, who earned him and Mastroianni the Volpi Cup for Best Actor) and &quot;Il viaggio di Capitan Fracassa&quot; (1990). His last film as director (also as screenwriter and actor) was &quot;Pensavo fosse amore, invece era un calesse&quot; (1991), again centering on the everyday difficulties of love between a man and a woman (portrayed by Francesca Neri).

== &quot;Il Postino&quot; and death ==
Troisi came to international fame through the success of &quot;Il Postino: The Postman&quot;, directed by Michael Radford. While working though heart condition, Troisi died in 1994 of a heart attack in his sister&#x27;s house at Infernetto, Rome, 12 hours after the camera stopped working and main filming on &quot;Il Postino&quot; had finished. It was reported that he postponed surgery to complete the film.
Troisi was just 41.

He was posthumously nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor and Best Writing for &quot;Il Postino&quot;, and was the sixth person to be posthumously nominated for an acting Academy Award. (Earlier posthumous nominations were Jeanne Eagels, James Dean [twice], Spencer Tracy, Peter Finch [won] and Sir Ralph Richardson.)

Pino Daniele worked on the soundtracks of most of his films. Eduardo De Filippo, the most prominent Italian dramatist of the 20th century with Luigi Pirandello, said he was &quot;a comedian of the future, rooted in the past&quot;.

<doc id="142481" wikidata="Q193573" url="?curid=142481" title="Moulin Rouge!">
<text>Moulin Rouge! (, ) is a 2001 jukebox musical romantic drama film directed, produced, and co-written by Baz Luhrmann. It follows an English poet, Christian, who falls in love with the star of the Moulin Rouge, cabaret actress and courtesan, Satine. The film uses the musical setting of the Montmartre Quarter of Paris and is the final part of Luhrmann&#x27;s &quot;Red Curtain Trilogy&quot;, following &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; (1992) and &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; (1996). A co-production of Australia and the United States, it features an ensemble cast starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, with Jim Broadbent, Richard Roxburgh, John Leguizamo, Jacek Koman, and Caroline O&#x27;Connor in supporting roles.

&quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or and was released in theaters on 25 May 2001 in Australia and on 1 June 2001 in North America. The film was praised for Luhrmann&#x27;s direction, the performances of the cast, its soundtrack, costume design, and production values. It was also a commercial success, grossing $179.2 million on a $50 million budget. At the 74th Academy Awards, the film received eight nominations, including Best Picture, and won two (Best Production Design and Best Costume Design). Later critical reception for &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; remained positive and has been considered by many to be one of the best films of all time, with it ranking 53rd in the BBC&#x27;s 2016 poll of the 100 greatest films of the 21st century. A stage musical adaptation premiered in 2018.

==Plot==
In 1900 in Paris, Christian, a young writer depressed about the recent death of the woman he loved, begins writing their story on his typewriter.

A year earlier in 1899, he arrives in the Montmartre district of Paris to join the Bohemian movement. He suddenly meets Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and his troupe of performers who are writing a play called &quot;Spectacular Spectacular&quot;. After Christian helps them complete the play, they go to the Moulin Rouge where they hope Christian&#x27;s talents will impress Satine, the star performer and courtesan, who will in turn convince Harold Zidler, the proprietor of the Moulin Rouge, to let Christian write the show. However, Zidler plans to have the wealthy, powerful and unscrupulous Duke of Monroth sleep with Satine in exchange for potential financing to convert the club into a theater.

That night, Satine mistakes Christian for the Duke and attempts to seduce him by dancing with him before retiring to her chamber with him to discuss things privately, but eventually Christian reveals his true identity. After the Duke interrupts them, Satine claims that the two of them and the Bohemians were rehearsing &quot;Spectacular Spectacular&quot;. Aided by Zidler, Christian and the Bohemians improvise a story for the Duke about a beautiful Indian courtesan who falls in love with a poor sitar player she mistook for a wealthy but evil maharaja. Approving the story, the Duke agrees to invest, but only if Satine and the Moulin Rouge are turned over to him. Later, Satine claims not to be in love with Christian, but he eventually wears down her resolve and they kiss.

During construction at the Moulin Rouge, Christian and Satine&#x27;s love deepens while the Duke becomes frustrated with all the time he thinks Satine is spending with Christian working on the play. To calm him, Zidler arranges for Satine to spend the night with the Duke and angrily tells her to end her affair with Christian. She misses the dinner when she falls unconscious, leading a doctor to diagnose a fatal case of consumption. She does try to end things by telling Christian that their relationship is endangering the production, but Christian writes a secret song to include in the show that affirms their unending, passionate love.

At the final rehearsal, Nini, a can-can dancer jealous of Satine&#x27;s popularity, hints to the Duke that the play represents the relationship between him, Christian, and Satine. Enraged, the Duke demands that the show end with the courtesan marrying the maharaja, instead of Christian&#x27;s ending where she marries the sitar player. Satine promises to spend the night with him after which they will decide on the ending. Ultimately, she fails to seduce the Duke due to her feelings for Christian, and Le Chocolat, one of the cabaret dancers, saves her from the Duke&#x27;s attempt to rape her. Christian decides that he and Satine should leave the show behind and run away to be together while the Duke vows to kill Christian.

Zidler finds Satine in her dressing room packing. He tells her that her illness is fatal, that the Duke is planning on murdering Christian, and that if she wants Christian to live, she must cut him off completely and be with the Duke. Mustering all her acting abilities, she complies, leaving Christian devastated.

On the opening night of the show, in front of a full audience, Christian denounces Satine and vows to give her to the Duke before walking off the stage, but Toulouse-Lautrec cries out from the rafters, &quot;The greatest thing you&#x27;ll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.&quot; This spurs Satine to sing their secret song, causing Christian to change his mind. After Zidler and the company thwart several attempts by the Duke and his bodyguard to kill Christian, the show ends with Christian and Satine proclaiming their love as the Duke permanently storms out of the cabaret. The audience erupts in applause, but Satine collapses after the curtains close. Before dying, she tells Christian to write their story so she will always be with him.

In the present, the Moulin Rouge has closed down and is in disrepair; Zidler, the Duke, the Diamond Dogs, and the Bohemians are gone; and Christian overcomes his grief by finishing his and Satine&#x27;s story, declaring their love will live forever.

==Cast==
==Production==

===Writing and inspiration===
&quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; was influenced by an eclectic variety of comic and melodramatic musical sources, including the Hollywood musical, &quot;vaudeville, cabaret culture, stage musicals, and operas.&quot; Its musical elements also allude to Luhrmann&#x27;s earlier film &quot;Strictly Ballroom.&quot;

Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s opera &quot;La bohème&quot;, which Luhrmann directed at the Sydney Opera House in 1993, was a key source of the plot for &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;. Further stylistic inspiration came from Luhrmann&#x27;s encounter with Bollywood films during his visit to India while conducting research for his 1993 production of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s opera &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. According to Luhrmann:
In the DVD&#x27;s audio commentary, Luhrmann revealed that he also drew from the Greek tragedy of Orpheus and Eurydice. The filmmakers projected the Orpheus figure onto Christian by characterizing the latter as a musical genius whose talent surpassed that of everyone else in his world. The film&#x27;s use of songs from the mid- to late 20th century in the 1899 setting makes Christian appear ahead of his time as a musician and writer. &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;′s plot also parallels that of the myth: &quot;McGregor, as a poet who spouts deathless verse . . . , descends into a hellish underworld of prostitution and musical entertainment in order to retrieve Kidman, the singing courtesan who loves him but is enslaved to a diabolical duke. He rescues her but looks back and . . . cue Queen&#x27;s &#x27;The Show Must Go On.&#x27;&quot;

Commentators have also noted the similarities between the film&#x27;s plot and those of the opera &quot;La Traviata&quot; and Émile Zola&#x27;s novel &quot;Nana&quot;. Other cinematic elements appear to have been borrowed from the musical films &quot;Cabaret&quot;, &quot;Folies Bergère de Paris&quot;, and &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;.

The character of Satine was based on the French can-can dancer Jane Avril. The character of Harold Zidler shares his last name with Charles Zidler, one of the owners of the real Moulin Rouge. Satie was loosely based on the French composers Erik Satie and Maurice Ravel. Môme Fromage, Le Pétomane, and Le Chocolat share their names with performers at the actual cabaret. Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo and Rita Hayworth were cited as inspirations for the film&#x27;s &quot;look.&quot;

===Development===
Leonardo DiCaprio, who worked with Luhrmann on &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot;, auditioned for the role of Christian. Ethan Hawke also read for the role. Luhrmann also considered younger actors for the role, including Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, before Ewan McGregor won the part. Courtney Love auditioned for the role of Satine and gave approval for &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; to be used in the film.

===Filming===
Production began on 9 November 1999 and was completed on 13 May 2000, with a budget of $50 million. It was shot on the sound stages at Fox Studios in Sydney. Filming generally went smoothly, but Kidman broke her ribs twice when she was lifted into the air during the dance sequences. She also suffered from a torn knee cartilage resulting from a fall during the &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; production song. Kidman later stated in an interview with Graham Norton that she broke a rib while getting into a corset by tightening it as much as possible to achieve an 18-inch waist, and that she fell down the stairs while dancing in heels. The production overran its shooting schedule and had to be out of the sound stages to make way for &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; (which also starred McGregor). This necessitated the filming of some pick-up shots in Madrid.

In the liner notes to the film&#x27;s Special Edition DVD, Luhrmann writes that &quot;[the] whole stylistic premise has been to decode what the Moulin Rouge was to the audiences of 1899 and express that same thrill and excitement in a way to which contemporary movie-goers can relate.&quot; Both Roger Ebert and &quot;The New York Times&quot; compared the film&#x27;s editing and cinematography to that of a music video and noted its visual homage to early Technicolor films.

===Music===
Marsha Kinder describes &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; as a &quot;brilliant,&quot; &quot;celebratory,&quot; and &quot;humorous&quot; musical and aural pastiche due to its use of diverse songs. &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; takes well-known popular music, mostly drawn from the MTV Generation, and juxtaposes it into a tale set in a turn-of-the-century Paris cabaret. Kinder holds that keeping borrowed lyrics and melodies intact &quot;makes it almost impossible for spectators to miss the poaching [of songs] (even if they cannot name the particular source).&quot;

The film uses so much popular music that it took Luhrmann two and a half years to secure the rights to all of the songs. Some of the songs sampled include &quot;Chamma Chamma&quot; from the Hindi movie &quot;China Gate&quot;, Queen&#x27;s &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; (arranged in operatic format), David Bowie&#x27;s rendition of Nat King Cole&#x27;s &quot;Nature Boy&quot;, &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; by Labelle (in the Christina Aguilera/P!nk/Mýa/Lil&#x27; Kim cover commissioned for the film), Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Material Girl&quot; and &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Your Song&quot;, the titular number of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, &quot;Roxanne&quot; by The Police (in a tango format using the composition &quot;Tanguera&quot; by Mariano Mores), and &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; by Nirvana.

Luhrmann had intended to incorporate songs by The Rolling Stones and Cat Stevens into the film, but could not obtain the necessary rights from these artists. When Stevens denied consent for the use of &quot;Father and Son&quot; due to religious objections to the film&#x27;s content, &quot;Nature Boy&quot; was chosen as its replacement.

==Release and reception==
Originally set for release on Christmas 2000, 20th Century Fox eventually moved the release of &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; to Summer 2001 to allow Luhrmann more time in post-production. &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival on May 9, 2001, as the festival&#x27;s opening title.

&quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; opened in the United States at two theaters in New York and Los Angeles on May 18, 2001. It grossed US$167,540 on its opening weekend. The film then expanded to a national release on June 1, 2001. It generated $14.2 million, ranking in fourth place behind &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, &quot;Shrek&quot; and &quot;The Animal&quot;. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; was the country&#x27;s number one film for two weeks before being displaced by &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot;. During its fifth weekend, it reclaimed the number one spot. The film remained so until it was dethroned by &quot;American Pie 2&quot; in its sixth weekend. &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; has grossed $57,386,369 in the United States and Canada and another $121,813,167 internationally (including $26 million in the United Kingdom and $3,878,504 in Australia).

&quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. Roger Ebert rated the film 3.5 stars out of 4, remarking that &quot;the movie is all color and music, sound and motion, kinetic energy, broad strokes, operatic excess.&quot; &quot;Newsweek&quot; praised McGregor&#x27;s and Kidman&#x27;s performances, stating that &quot;both stars hurl themselves into the movie&#x27;s reckless spirit, unafraid of looking foolish, adroitly attuned to Luhrmann&#x27;s abrupt swings from farce to tragedy. (And both sing well.)&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the film is undeniably rousing, but there is not a single moment of organic excitement because Mr. Luhrmann is so busy splicing bits from other films&quot; but conceded that &quot;there&#x27;s nothing else like it, and young audiences, especially girls, will feel as if they had found a movie that was calling them by name.&quot; &quot;All Things Considered&quot; commented the film was &quot;not gonna be for all tastes&quot; and that &quot;you either surrender to this sort of flamboyance or you experience it as overkill.&quot;

&quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; holds a rating of 66/100 at Metacritic based on 35 reviews. At Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 75% &quot;Fresh&quot; approval rating based on 259 reviews, with an average score of 7.1/10. The website&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus reads: &quot;A love-it-or-hate-it experience, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is all style, all giddy, over-the-top spectacle. But it&#x27;s also daring in its vision and wildly original.&quot; In December 2001, the film was named the best film of the year by viewers of &quot;Film 2001&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked it #6 on its list of the top ten movies of the decade, saying, &quot;Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s trippy pop culture pastiche from 2001 was an aesthetically arresting ode to poetry, passion, and Elton John. It was so good, we&#x27;ll forgive him for &quot;Australia.&quot;&quot; In 2008, &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; was ranked No. 211 on &quot;Empire&#x27;s&quot; 500 Greatest Movies of All Time. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Home Theater Forum rated the DVD release of &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; as the best DVD of 2001. Luhrmann had hand-picked the features and behind-the scenes footage for the two-disc DVD edition.

===Analysis===

====Postmodern====
Scholarly commentators have interpreted &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; as an exemplary postmodern film, citing its methods of aesthetic expression, symbolism, and ties to both fine art and pop culture as evidence. The film&#x27;s music also contributes to its postmodern aesthetic. Notably, &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; combines mid-to-late 20th Century melodies and lyrics with a narrative set in &quot;fin de siècle&quot; France. Scholars Kathryn Conner Bennett and Marsha Kinder have argued that the use of famous popular songs in a new, original context requires audiences to reinterpret their significance within the framework of the narrative and challenge an assumption that music&#x27;s symbolism is static.

&quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; also makes ample use of other postmodern filmmaking techniques, including fragmentation and juxtaposition. As the film&#x27;s protagonist, Christian is the primary source of &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;″s story line and many portions of the story are told from his point of view. However, the narrative is fragmented on several occasions when the film deviates from Christian&#x27;s perspective or integrates a flashback. &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; also juxtaposes a play-within-a-film (&quot;Spectacular Spectacular&quot;) with the film&#x27;s events themselves to draw parallels between the plot of the play and the characters&#x27; lives. This culminates in the &quot;Come What May&quot; sequence, which reveals the development of Christian and Satine&#x27;s relationship alongside the progression of &quot;Spectacular Spectacular&quot;″s rehearsals.

Postmodernism is also evident in &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;″s homage to Western musicals, Bollywood masala films, and music videos, as well as Luhrmann&#x27;s film &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot;.

==Accolades==
&quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; received eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actress (Nicole Kidman), winning in two categories for Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design. It became the first musical film to receive a coveted Best Picture nomination since &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991). Despite the film&#x27;s overwhelming success, Baz Luhrmann was notably excluded from the Best Director lineup; commenting on this during the Oscar ceremony, host Whoopi Goldberg remarked, &quot;I guess &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; just directed itself.&quot; Additionally, the only original tune in the film, &quot;Come What May&quot; was disqualified from the Best Original Song consideration because it was originally intended, although unused, for Luhrmann&#x27;s previous film &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; and not written expressly for &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;. It tied with &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; for leading twelve nominations at the 55th British Academy Film Awards and resulted in three wins, including Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Jim Broadbent). The musical also led the 59th Golden Globe Awards, alongside the drama &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, each receiving six nominations; it won three, including Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.

Other notable ceremonies where it received much recognition included the American Film Institute Awards, the Australian Film Institute Awards, and the Satellite Awards. Various prestigious award bodies, such as the National Board of Review and the PGA Awards named it the best film of the year. It was the last musical film to win NBR&#x27;s Best Film award until &quot;Wicked&quot; in 2024.

Two soundtrack albums were released, with the second coming after the first one&#x27;s massive success. The first volume featured the smash hit single &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;, performed by Christina Aguilera, Lil&#x27; Kim, Mýa and Pink. The first soundtrack, &quot;Moulin Rouge! Music from Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s Film&quot;, was released on 8 May 2001, with the second, &quot;Moulin Rouge! Music from Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s Film, Vol. 2&quot;, following on 26 February 2002.

==Stage adaptation==

As early as November 2002, Luhrmann revealed that he intended to adapt &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; into a stage musical. A Las Vegas casino was the reputed site of the proposed show. Luhrmann was said to have asked both Kidman and McGregor to reprise their starring roles in the potential stage version.

In 2008, a stage adaptation entitled &quot;La Belle Bizarre du Moulin Rouge&quot; (&quot;The Bizarre Beauty of the Moulin Rouge&quot;) toured Germany and produced a cast recording.

In 2016, it was announced that Global Creatures was developing &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; into a stage musical. Alex Timbers was slated to direct the production, and John Logan was tapped to write the book. &quot;Moulin Rouge!: The Musical&quot;, starring Aaron Tveit as Christian and Karen Olivo as Satine, premiered on 10 July 2018 at the Colonial Theatre in Boston. The Broadway production opened at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre on 25 July 2019. In February 2024, Boy George, Derek Klena, and Courtney Reed were playing the roles of Zidler, Christian, and Satine, respectively.

==In popular culture==
The 2002 made-for-television movie, &quot;It&#x27;s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie&quot;, features a Christmas-themed parody entitled &quot;Moulin Scrooge&quot;, in which various scenes and musical numbers are re-enacted by Muppets. In &quot;Moulin Scrooge&quot;, Christian is played by Kermit the Frog, Satine (named Saltine) by Miss Piggy, Toulouse-Lautrec by Gonzo and Zidler by Fozzie Bear.

The music video for Mr. Brightside was inspired by the film.

In the 2017–18 figure skating season, at the 2018 Winter Olympics, Canadian skaters Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir performed two selections from &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;, interpreting the story of Christian and Satine through &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, &quot;El Tango de Roxanne&quot;, and &quot;Come What May&quot;. Their performance won the gold medal in the team and the individual events. At this event, Virtue and Moir became the most decorated skaters of all time.

<text>Cries and Whispers () is a 1972 Swedish period drama film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman and starring Harriet Andersson, Kari Sylwan, Ingrid Thulin and Liv Ullmann. The film, set in a mansion at the end of the 19th century, is about three sisters and a servant who struggle with the terminal cancer of one of the sisters (Andersson). The servant (Sylwan) is close to her, while the other two sisters (Ullmann and Thulin) confront their emotional distance from each other.

Inspired by Bergman&#x27;s mother, Karin Åkerblom, and his vision of four women in a red room, &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; was filmed at Taxinge-Näsby Castle in 1971. Its themes include faith, the female psyche and the search for meaning in suffering, and academics have found Biblical allusions. Unlike previous Bergman films, it uses saturated colour, crimson in particular.

After its premiere in the United States, distributed by Roger Corman and New World Pictures, the film was released in Sweden and screened out of competition at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival. Following two unsuccessful films by Bergman, &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; was a critical and commercial success. It received five Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Picture (rare for a foreign-language film). Cinematographer Sven Nykvist won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, and &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; won the Guldbagge Award for Best Film and other honours.

The film inspired stage adaptations by Ivo van Hove and Andrei Șerban and influenced later cinema. It was commemorated on Swedish postage stamps referring to a scene in which Andersson and Sylwan replicate the &quot;Pietà&quot;.

==Plot==
In a large 19th-century mansion with red walls and carpets, Agnes is dying of uterine cancer. Her sisters, Maria and Karin, arrive at their childhood home and take turns with the maid, Anna, watching over Agnes. Anna, more religious than the sisters, prays after she lost her young daughter. When Agnes&#x27;s doctor David visits, he sees his former lover Maria. Maria remembers their affair and her failed marriage with her husband Joakim, who stabbed himself non-fatally in response to the adultery. David tells her that she has become more indifferent. Agnes remembers their mother, who neglected and teased her and favoured Maria, with greater understanding and recalls sharing a moment of sorrow with her. While Agnes&#x27; sisters remain emotionally distant, Anna comforts the suffering Agnes by baring her breasts and holding her at night.

Agnes dies after a long period of suffering, and at her wake the priest says that her faith was stronger than his own. Maria tells Karin that it is unusual for them to avoid touching each other or having a deep conversation. She tries to touch Karin, who recoils at the gesture. Karin recalls an earlier occasion at the mansion, where, struggling with self-harm, she mutilated her genitals with a piece of broken glass to repel her husband Fredrik. Karin later dines with Maria, saying that Anna was devoted to Agnes and probably deserves a memento. She says she resents Anna&#x27;s seeming familiarity with her and Maria, speaks of her own suicidal tendencies, and confesses her hatred of Maria and her flirtatiousness and shallow smiles. The sisters reconcile after the argument, touching each other.

In a dream sequence, Agnes briefly returns to life and asks Karin and then Maria to approach her. Karin, repelled by the invitation, says that she still has life and does not love Agnes enough to join her. Maria approaches the undead Agnes but flees in terror when she grabs her, saying that she cannot leave her husband and children. Anna re-enters the room and takes Agnes back to bed, where she cradles the dead Agnes in her arms.

The family decides to send Anna away at the end of the month, with Fredrik refusing to award her with any additional severance pay, and the maid rejects her promised memento. Maria returns to Joakim, and Karin cannot believe Maria&#x27;s claim that she does not remember their touch. Anna finds Agnes&#x27; diary with an account of a visit with Maria, Karin and Anna, with a shared, nostalgic moment on a swing. Agnes wrote that &quot;come what may, this is happiness.&quot;

==Production==
===Development===

According to Bergman, he conceived the story during a lonely, unhappy time on Fårö when he wrote constantly. He described a recurring dream of four women in white clothing in a red room, whispering to each other. He said that this symbolised his childhood view of the soul as a faceless person who was black on the outside, representing shame, and red on the inside. The persistence of the vision indicated to Bergman that it could be a film, he said, and he planned a &quot;portrait of my mother ... the great beloved of my childhood&quot;. Karin has the same name as Bergman&#x27;s mother, but all four female protagonists are intended to represent aspects of her personality.

A childhood memory of the Sophiahemmet mortuary also influenced the director:
Since Bergman&#x27;s films were difficult to market, foreign capital was unavailable to finance the film. He decided to shoot &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; in Swedish rather than English (as his previous film, &quot;The Touch&quot;, had been) and finance it through his production company, Cinematograph. Although he used 750,000 SEK of his savings and borrowed 200,000 SEK, he also asked the Swedish Film Institute for help with the film&#x27;s 1.5-million SEK budget. This attracted some criticism, since Bergman was not an up-and-coming director in the greatest need of subsidy. To save money, the main actresses and Nykvist returned their salaries as loans and were nominal co-producers.

In his book, &quot;Images&quot;, Bergman wrote: &quot;Today I feel that in &quot;Persona&quot;—and later in &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot;—I had gone as far as I could go. And that in these two instances when working in total freedom, I touched wordless secrets that only the cinema can discover&quot;. In an essay included with the DVD, critic Peter Cowie quoted the director: &quot;All of my films can be thought of in terms of black and white, except &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot;&quot;.

===Casting===

When Bergman wrote the screenplay, he intended from the start to cast Liv Ullmann and Ingrid Thulin. He explained his choice of Harriet Andersson for Agnes: &quot;I would very much like to have Harriet, too, since she belongs to this breed of enigmatic women&quot;. Andersson had not worked with Bergman for years, and he sent her notes rather than a complete screenplay. Ullmann described receiving a 50-page &quot;personal letter&quot; from Bergman describing the story which began, &quot;Dear Friends: We&#x27;re now going to make a film together. It is a sort of a vision that I have and I will try to describe it&quot;. Andersson did not receive a backstory about Agnes; Agnes&#x27; sisters were married with children, but Andersson was uncertain whether Agnes had ever married or became ill at an early age and lived with her mother.

Bergman and Ullmann had a previous romantic relationship, and their daughter Linn Ullmann appears as both Maria&#x27;s daughter and Anna&#x27;s daughter in the picture. Another of Bergman&#x27;s daughters, Lena, also appears as young Maria.

The director initially said that he hoped Mia Farrow would be in the film: &quot;Let&#x27;s see if that works out. It probably will; why shouldn&#x27;t it?&quot; However, Farrow was never cast. Kari Sylwan, a novice in Bergman&#x27;s films, had what would have been Farrow&#x27;s role.

===Pre-production===
Few of Bergman&#x27;s previous films were shot in colour. Red was particularly sensitive, and cinematographer Sven Nykvist made many photography tests to capture balanced combinations of reds, whites and skin colours. To the disappointment of Swedish Film Institute members, Bergman refused to shoot in their new, expensive studios and filmed on location at Taxinge-Näsby Castle. Since the mansion&#x27;s interior was dilapidated, the crew was free to paint and decorate as they saw fit.

===Filming===

Principal photography took place from 9 September to 30 October 1971. Nykvist used Eastmancolor film, which reduced graininess and would be the most sensitive to colours. The final, outdoor swing scene was shot early in production so the filmmakers could have sunlight before the darker season set in. Ullmann said that every scene was shot in natural light, using large windows for indoor scenes.

Andersson described the on-set mood as light, an antidote to the film&#x27;s heavy subject matter. She said that although she usually read the screenplay and went to bed early during a production, the filmmakers kept her awake late to enhance her tired, ill appearance. The actress modeled her death scene on the death of her father, and Bergman directed her deep, violent inhalations.

==Themes and interpretations==
Previous Bergman films had focused on the apparent absence of God, but scholar Julian C. Rice quoted Bergman as saying that he had moved beyond that theme. Rice wrote that &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot;, following &quot;The Silence&quot; (1963) and &quot;Persona&quot; (1966), was based more on psychology and individuation. Academic Eva Rueschmann said that psychoanalysis was an obvious tool with which to study the film, given the subconscious links between its characters.

===Family and detachment===

Professor Egil Törnqvist examined the film&#x27;s title. The young Maria whispers to her mother, and Karin and Maria whisper to each other as they bond. According to Törnqvist, &quot;The cries relate to the opposite emotions: anguish, impotence, loneliness&quot;. Professor Emma Wilson described the family&#x27;s predicament, with Karin feeling endangered by touch and Maria seeking an &quot;erotic&quot; touch. However, Maria is repelled by Agnes&#x27; decay and her dead body. Rueschmann explained Karin&#x27;s repulsion to touch as a result of her degree of isolation and restraint. The scene where Anna cradles Agnes suggests that touch and sensation are soothing, despite the &quot;opaque&quot; question of their relationship, which may be comparable to sisterhood.

The magic lantern show the sisters enjoy is &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, which reveals Agnes&#x27; feelings of abandonment and her mother&#x27;s favouring of Maria; according to Rueschmann, the Brothers Grimm story of sibling unity contrasts the sisters&#x27; estrangement. Cinema historian P. Adams Sitney wrote that Hansel and Gretel&#x27;s parents abandoned them in the forest (symbolism), and Agnes&#x27; cancer is the equivalent of the witch in the Brothers Grimm tale. Karin&#x27;s cutting of her vulva means that her husband will not have sex with her, and the red wine symbolises blood from the womb. Törnqvist wrote that Karin&#x27;s transfer of blood from her vulva to her mouth means that she will neither have sex nor speak, and preventing communication reinforces loneliness. Sitney wrote that the family is most united when reading Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;, which describes &quot;male solidarity and chicanery, threatened by female plots for marriage&quot;. According to Frank Gado, detachment returns after Agnes&#x27; funeral. Anna is dismissed without warmth or sympathy, and the men deny her monetary rewards despite years of service. Maria also rejects &quot;sentimental appeals&quot; from Karin.

Film scholar Marc Gervais wrote that &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; has no definitive solution of whether suffering and death have any meaning, citing the pastor who expresses his own doubts and fears when he eulogises Agnes. Gervais likened this to the protagonist of Bergman&#x27;s earlier &quot;Winter Light&quot;, Bergman&#x27;s own conflicted feelings and his relationship to his father, Erik, a minister of the Church of Sweden. According to Gervais, the ending presents Bergman&#x27;s solution: a touch, on certain occasions, can make life worthwhile. Törnqvist compared the ending to that of Bergman&#x27;s 1957 &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot;; it &quot;points to the past, to a paradisaic existence in &quot;this&quot; life, to the communion inherent in childhood that has later been lost&quot;.

===Sex and gender roles===
Critic Marco Lanzagorta wrote, &quot;Undeniably, &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; is a film about the world of women, and is very open in terms of the gender and sexual politics that it portrays&quot;. The story fits Bergman&#x27;s motif of &quot;warring women&quot;, seen earlier in &quot;The Silence&quot; and &quot;Persona&quot; and later in &quot;Autumn Sonata&quot; (1978). The film inspired essays about Bergman&#x27;s view of women. Patricia Erens wrote, &quot;Bergman&#x27;s women in such films as &quot;Persona&quot; and &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; are not simply objects of abuse, but creatures through whom Bergman can express his own subjective fears, his many frustrations and failures at preserving autonomy of self and control of reality&quot;.

Feminists critiqued the film. In &quot;Film Quarterly&quot;, Joan Mellen acknowledged that Bergman used his female characters as mouthpieces and his women signify &quot;the dilemma of alienated, suffering human beings&quot;. In Bergman&#x27;s films, women and men fail to find answers to their dilemmas; according to Mellen, the men are unanswered or cannot care for anyone but themselves. However, she wrote that Bergman&#x27;s women fail because of their biology and an inability to move past their sexuality: &quot;Bergman insists that because of their physiology, women are trapped in dry and empty lives within which they wither as the lines begin to appear on their faces&quot;. Critic Molly Haskell assigned &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; to Bergman&#x27;s later filmography, which differed from his earlier works in their view of women. Women in his early films lived in harmony with each other and had more-complete lives; Bergman used the women in &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; and his later films as &quot;projections of his soul&quot;, revealing his &quot;sexual vanity&quot;. According to Haskell, Bergman attacked his female characters for the attributes he gave them: Karin&#x27;s repression and Maria&#x27;s sexuality.

Academic Laura Hubner agreed with &quot;CineAction&quot; essayist Varda Burstyn&#x27;s view that &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; depicts the suppression of women, but it does not endorse the suppression and the film opposes patriarchy. Rueschmann traced the emotional estrangement to the women&#x27;s mother, who reacts to the era&#x27;s gender roles with &quot;boredom, anger and frustration&quot;. According to Rueschmann, her daughters assume (or reject) her position and harm themselves in the process. Agnes&#x27; confinement to bed may reflect gender roles and expectations for women about sex, childbirth and death. Author Birgitta Steene disputed what she called Mellen&#x27;s Marxist feminist analysis, cross-referencing Bergman&#x27;s realistic and metaphorical films to say that they are not the product of a sexist outlook.

Rueschmann quoted Bergman as saying his &quot;ceaseless fascination with the whole race of women is one of [his] mainsprings. Obviously such an obsession implies ambivalence; it has something compulsive about it&quot;. However, he doubted that there was much difference between men and women: &quot;I think that if I had made &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; with four men in the leading roles, the story would have been largely the same&quot;.

===Mythical and biblical allusions===

Although Agnes&#x27; apparent resurrection may reflect Anna&#x27;s fear (or desire), Emma Wilson wrote that it blurred the line between life and dream and might involve supernatural activity. Bergman explained the scene:

Törnqvist advised against a literal reading of Agnes rising from the dead, relating it to the sisters&#x27; guilt.

According to Sitney, the statue in the prologue may be Apollo or Orpheus. If the artistic, doomed Agnes matches Orpheus as well as Bergman, Agnes&#x27; mother may correspond to Eurydice (representing &quot;the green world&quot;). P. Adams Sitney concluded that &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; tells of an &quot;Orphic transformation of terror into art, of the loss of the mother into the musical richness of autumnal color&quot;.

The sisters&#x27; Aunt Olga uses the magic lantern to narrate &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, and Sitney connected this with &quot;the gift of fairy tales—and thereby the psychic-defense machinery for exteriorising infantile and Oedipal terrors&quot;. In the folk tale &quot;Cinderella&quot;, the wicked stepsisters&#x27; bleeding feet as a metaphor for menstruation is magnified by Karin&#x27;s cutting of her vulva. Her laugh is reminiscent of the wicked witch in &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, as she reacts to the damage her sexuality has done.

Törnqvist, seeing that Anna prays for her dead daughter while eating an apple, wrote: &quot;The eating of the apple links Anna, whose dead daughter was undoubtedly an illegitimate child, with the Eve of the Fall, with Original Sin&quot;. According to editor Raphael Shargel, Anna seems oblivious to the sacrilege of snacking immediately after worship and that her choice of food is the forbidden fruit.

Törnqvist wrote that Agnes&#x27; prolonged pain and death resemble the Passion of Jesus, and Wilson compared the position of Agnes&#x27; arms and legs to Jesus&#x27; body after his Passion. Gado also saw parallels to the crucifixion of Jesus and flashbacks to Good Friday and a mention of Twelfth Night at the end of the film (which he considered ironic, since Twelfth Night is associated with revelation). The magic-lantern show takes place on Twelfth Night. Sitney, Rueschmann, and Irving Singer described the scene where Anna cradles Agnes as reminiscent of &quot;Pietà&quot;, with Lanzagorta specifying Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Pietà&quot;. According to academic Arthur Gibson, the &quot;Pietà&quot; rite becomes redemption: &quot;Anna is holding in her arms the pain and loneliness and sin of the world caught up in the innocent Divine Sufferer&quot;.

==Style==

In 1972, &quot;Variety&quot; staff defined &quot;Bergman&#x27;s lean style&quot; as including a &quot;use of lingering close-ups, fades to red and a soundtrack echoing with the ticking of clocks, the rustle of dresses and the hushed cries of the lost&quot;. Critic Richard Brody called &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; a period piece in which costumes are prominent. According to Gervais, Bergman had shed his previous austerity in favour of greater aesthetics.

Wilson noted the film&#x27;s red rooms occupied by women in white, and the &quot;azure, Edenic images of the start are gradually engulfed in crimson&quot;. Producer Bruce A. Block described its colour variety as minimal, with an emphasis on &quot;extremely saturated red&quot;. According to Richard Armstrong, the Eastmancolor film added &quot;a livid, slightly oneiric quality&quot;. Two rooms in the first scene (one where Maria is sleeping and the other being Agnes&#x27; room) are joined by the same colours, including &quot;blood red&quot; carpets and drapes and white pillows and nightdresses. Wilson observed that the film has fade-ins and fade-outs in saturated reds. Sitney analysed &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot;″ colour scheme, writing that there are moves from red with white to red with black to orange and ochre (in the final, autumnal outdoor scene). Blood, seen when Maria&#x27;s husband injures himself and Karin cuts her vulva, echoes an earlier view of the mother character holding a red book against her dress. Sitney associates this with menstruation and castration.

Wilson described other uses of imagery: statues filling a garden, decorations, sunlight on a clock and a view of Maria revealing the &quot;texture&quot; of her hair. Images follow one another in the five-minute prologue with no spoken words. The close-ups of Maria in the initial scene are childlike. Agnes is seen with an open mouth and moist eyes, depicting her pain. Her memories of her mother are idealised, with the &quot;flourishing greenery of the Edenic garden&quot;. Surveying the visuals and Bergman&#x27;s depiction of social isolation and mourning, critics Christopher Heathcote and Jai Marshall found parallels in the paintings of Edvard Munch.
Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s sarabande from Cello Suite No. 5 in C minor, performed by Pierre Fournier, is used in the film. Noting its use when the two sisters touch affectionately, critic Robin Wood wrote that it fit Bergman&#x27;s use of Bach to signify &quot;a possible transcendent wholeness&quot;. The score also contains Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s Mazurka in A minor, Op.17/4, performed by Käbi Laretei. According to musicologist Alexis Luko, Bergman&#x27;s use of the mazurka when Anna recalls her deceased daughter communicates &quot;a sensory moment of reminiscence&quot;.

Sounds are used in other ways, with Anna&#x27;s dead daughter apparently audible when Anna is near the cradle following Agnes&#x27; death. The prologue&#x27;s bells and clocks are more audible than the natural sounds preceding them; Agnes&#x27; struggle to breathe soon joins the clocks&#x27; ticking, with editor Ken Dancyger finding &quot;the continuity of time and life&quot;.

==Release==
Every major film-distribution company rejected &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot;, even when Bergman asked for an advance of only $75,000. Its U.S. rights were bought by Roger Corman of New World Pictures (who favored having the studio branch out into arthouse distribution such as with &quot;Amarcord&quot;) for $150,000. Corman spent an additional $80,000 on marketing to go with booking the film on the drive-in circuit. According to the producer, the film made a profit of $1 million and was Bergman&#x27;s biggest success in the U.S. Author Tino Balio reported a U.S. gross of $1.2 million from 803 theatres, and called it Bergman&#x27;s best-performing film since &quot;The Silence&quot;. To qualify for the 46th Academy Awards, distributors hurried to premiere &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; in Los Angeles County (several months before its Swedish release). It premiered in New York City on 21 December 1972.

The film premiered at the Spegeln theatre in Stockholm on 5 March 1973. &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; was later shown out of competition at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival, where Bergman received a strong positive reaction from the audience.

At the 61st Berlin International Film Festival in February 2011 (with Andersson in attendance), &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; was screened in the Retrospective section. In 2015, The Criterion Collection released a 2K restoration on Blu-ray in Region A.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Before the film&#x27;s release, estimations of Bergman were lowered by &quot;The Rite&quot; (1969) and &quot;The Touch&quot; (1971). In Sweden, &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot; critic Åke Janzon and &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; critic Hanserik Hjerten assessed &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; as a poetically-rendered psychological study. Critic O. Foss wrote a less-positive review in &quot;Fant&quot;, calling it &quot;a rhapsody of petrified Bergman themes&quot;. The Swedish cultural magazine &quot;Ord och Bild&quot; considered the film as Bergman’s personal view on women and argued that the film was both static and ahistorical.

The film was generally praised in the United States. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby called it a &quot;magnificent, moving, and very mysterious new film&quot;. He included the film in his list of the &quot;10 Best Films of 1972&quot;. Roger Ebert gave &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; four stars (out of four) in his initial review: &quot;We slip lower in our seats, feeling claustrophobia and sexual disquiet, realizing that we have been surrounded by the vision of a film maker who has absolute mastery of his art&quot;. and named it &quot;the best film of 1973&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; staff praised the direction for &quot;a hypnotic impact&quot;. In &quot;New York&quot;, Judith Crist called it &quot;a work of genius— certainly the most complex, the most perceptive and the most humane of Bergman&#x27;s works to date&quot;. François Truffaut made a theatrical comparison, saying that the film &quot;begins like Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot; and ends like &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; and in between it&#x27;s more like Strindberg&quot;.

&quot;Empire&quot; critic David Parkinson gave &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; five stars in 2000, writing that the film fit a subset of &quot;character study&quot; at which Bergman was adept. Reviewing the DVD in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Richard Brody said that despite its period setting, the emotional drama resonated with modern audiences. Ebert added it to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list in 2002, writing that to watch the film &quot;is to touch the extremes of human feeling. It is so personal, so penetrating of privacy, we almost want to look away&quot;. That year, James Berardinelli praised Andersson&#x27;s performance as &quot;so powerful that we feel like intruders watching it. She screams, whimpers, begs, and cries. She craves death and fears it&quot;. Berardinelli considered Bergman&#x27;s use of crimson effective in creating mood; the &quot;natural associations one makes with this color, especially in a story like this, are of sin and blood&quot;. Zendry Svärdkrona&#x27;s 2003 &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; review called it a masterpiece with wonderful aesthetics but unpleasant subject matter, citing Nykvist and Andersson. Emanuel Levy praised the film&#x27;s cinematography and the performances of the female leads, calling the result a masterpiece in 2008. &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; ranked 154th in the British Film Institute&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll of the greatest films ever made. Leonard Maltin gave the film three stars in his &quot;2014 Movie Guide&quot;, praising its visuals but cautioning viewers about the large amount of dialogue. Reviewing the Blu-ray in 2015, &quot;SF Gate&quot; critic Mick LaSalle called &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; a &quot;masterpiece&quot; in which the colour red had an important effect. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Andy Klein placed the film &quot;solidly in the existential/emotional angst mode of [Bergman&#x27;s] best work&quot;, called it a triumphant comeback from &quot;The Touch&quot;, and joked about the resurrection scene: &quot;Yes, technically this is a zombie film&quot;. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film five stars out of five writing &quot;This film burns, like ice held to the skin.&quot;

Don Druker wrote a negative review in the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, criticising a lack of substance, and &quot;Time Out&quot;″s review called the film a &quot;red herring&quot; compared to Bergman&#x27;s purer psychological dramas.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; has an approval rating of 91% based on 34 reviews, with an average score of 8.50/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Visually stunning and achingly performed, Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s chamber piece is a visceral rumination on death and sisterhood.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; won three categories at the 9th Guldbagge Awards in Sweden, including Best Film. At Cannes, it won the Technical Grand Prize. It was the fourth foreign-language film ever nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, in addition to four other nominations at the 46th Academy Awards; Sven Nykvist won for Best Cinematography.

The film was nominated for, and won, several other awards from critics&#x27; associations and festivals. At the 27th British Academy Film Awards, Sven Nykvist was nominated for Best Cinematography and Ingrid Thulin for Best Supporting Actress; at the 30th Golden Globe Awards, it was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film.

==Legacy==
In 1981, PostNord Sverige issued a postage stamp of the scene where Anna holds Agnes as part of a series commemorating the history of Swedish cinema. Woody Allen&#x27;s later films, including 1978&#x27;s &quot;Interiors&quot; and 1986&#x27;s &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot;, were influenced by &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot;, as was Margarethe von Trotta&#x27;s 1979—1988 trilogy: &quot;Sisters, or the Balance of Happiness&quot;, &quot;Marianne and Juliane&quot; and &quot;Love and Fear&quot;. In 2017, Hallwyl Museum exhibited costumes from &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; and other Bergman films. Robert Eggers cited it as an influence on his version of &quot;Nosferatu&quot;.

It has been adapted for the stage. Andrei Șerban directed &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; in 2010 for the Hungarian Theatre of Cluj, dramatising Bergman&#x27;s story and the film&#x27;s production. Ivo van Hove directed a 2009 adaptation at the Bergman Festival in Sweden&#x27;s Royal Dramatic Theatre, and in 2011 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with Chris Nietvelt as Agnes, moving the story to a contemporary setting, reducing the use of red and replacing the film&#x27;s classical music with modern songs, including Janis Joplin&#x27;s &quot;Cry Baby&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, the harmonic series is the infinite series formed by summing all positive unit fractions:
formula_1

The first formula_2 terms of the series sum to approximately formula_3, where formula_4 is the natural logarithm and formula_5 is the Euler–Mascheroni constant. Because the logarithm has arbitrarily large values, the harmonic series does not have a finite limit: it is a divergent series. Its divergence was proven in the 14th century by Nicole Oresme using a precursor to the Cauchy condensation test for the convergence of infinite series. It can also be proven to diverge by comparing the sum to an integral, according to the integral test for convergence.

Applications of the harmonic series and its partial sums include Euler&#x27;s proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers, the analysis of the coupon collector&#x27;s problem on how many random trials are needed to provide a complete range of responses, the connected components of random graphs, the block-stacking problem on how far over the edge of a table a stack of blocks can be cantilevered, and the average case analysis of the quicksort algorithm.

==History==
The name of the harmonic series derives from the concept of overtones or harmonics in music: the wavelengths of the overtones of a vibrating string are etc., of the string&#x27;s fundamental wavelength. Every term of the harmonic series after the first is the harmonic mean of the neighboring terms, so the terms form a harmonic progression; the phrases &quot;harmonic mean&quot; and &quot;harmonic progression&quot; likewise derive from music.
Beyond music, harmonic sequences have also had a certain popularity with architects. This was so particularly in the Baroque period, when architects used them to establish the proportions of floor plans, of elevations, and to establish harmonic relationships between both interior and exterior architectural details of churches and palaces.

The divergence of the harmonic series was first proven in 1350 by Nicole Oresme. Oresme&#x27;s work, and the contemporaneous work of Richard Swineshead on a different series, marked the first appearance of infinite series other than the geometric series in mathematics. However, this achievement fell into obscurity. Additional proofs were published in the 17th century by Pietro Mengoli and by Jacob Bernoulli. Bernoulli credited his brother Johann Bernoulli for finding the proof, and it was later included in Johann Bernoulli&#x27;s collected works.

The partial sums of the harmonic series were named harmonic numbers, and given their usual notation formula_6, in 1968 by Donald Knuth.

==Definition and divergence==
The harmonic series is the infinite series
formula_7
in which the terms are all of the positive unit fractions. It is a divergent series: as more terms of the series are included in partial sums of the series, the values of these partial sums grow arbitrarily large, beyond any finite limit. Because it is a divergent series, it should be interpreted as a formal sum, an abstract mathematical expression combining the unit fractions, rather than as something that can be evaluated to a numeric value. There are many different proofs of the divergence of the harmonic series, surveyed in a 2006 paper by S. J. Kifowit and T. A. Stamps.
Two of the best-known are listed below.

===Comparison test===

One way to prove divergence is to compare the harmonic series with another divergent series, where each denominator is replaced with the next-largest power of two:
formula_8
Grouping equal terms shows that the second series diverges (because every grouping of convergent series is only convergent):
formula_9
Because each term of the harmonic series is greater than or equal to the corresponding term of the second series (and the terms are all positive), and since the second series diverges, it follows (by the comparison test) that the harmonic series diverges as well. The same argument proves more strongly that, for every positive 
formula_10
This is the original proof given by Nicole Oresme in around 1350. The Cauchy condensation test is a generalization of this argument.

===Integral test===

It is possible to prove that the harmonic series diverges by comparing its sum with an improper integral. Specifically, consider the arrangement of rectangles shown in the figure to the right. Each rectangle is 1 unit wide and formula_11 units high, so if the harmonic series converged then the total area of the rectangles would be the sum of the harmonic series. The curve formula_12 stays entirely below the upper boundary of the rectangles, so the area under the curve (in the range of formula_13 from one to infinity that is covered by rectangles) would be less than the area of the union of the rectangles. However, the area under the curve is given by a divergent improper integral,
formula_14
Because this integral does not converge, the sum cannot converge either.

In the figure to the right, shifting each rectangle to the left by 1 unit, would produce a sequence of rectangles whose boundary lies below the curve rather than above it.
This shows that the partial sums of the harmonic series differ from the integral by an amount that is bounded above and below by the unit area of the first rectangle:
formula_15
Generalizing this argument, any infinite sum of values of a monotone decreasing positive function (like the harmonic series) has partial sums that are within a bounded distance of the values of the corresponding integrals. Therefore, the sum converges if and only if the integral over the same range of the same function converges. When this equivalence is used to check the convergence of a sum by replacing it with an easier integral, it is known as the integral test for convergence.

==Partial sums==

Adding the first formula_2 terms of the harmonic series produces a partial sum, called a harmonic number and 
formula_17

===Growth rate===
These numbers grow very slowly, with logarithmic growth, as can be seen from the integral test. More precisely, by the Euler–Maclaurin formula,
formula_18
where formula_19 is the Euler–Mascheroni constant and formula_20 which approaches 0 as formula_2 goes to infinity.

===Divisibility===
No harmonic numbers are integers except for One way to prove that formula_6 is not an integer is to consider the highest power of two formula_23 in the range from If formula_24 is the least common multiple of the numbers from then
formula_25 can be rewritten as a sum of fractions with equal denominators formula_26
in which only one of the numerators, is odd and the rest are even, and formula_24 is itself even. Therefore, the result is a fraction with an odd numerator and an even denominator, which cannot be an integer. More generally, any sequence of consecutive integers has a unique member divisible by a greater power of two than all the other sequence members, from which it follows by the same argument that no two harmonic numbers differ by an integer.

Another proof that the harmonic numbers are not integers observes that the denominator of formula_6 must be divisible by 
all prime numbers greater than formula_29 and less than or equal to formula_2, and uses Bertrand&#x27;s postulate to prove that this set of primes is non-empty. The same argument implies more strongly that, except for formula_31, formula_32, and formula_33, no harmonic number can have a terminating decimal representation. It has been conjectured that every prime number divides the numerators of only a finite subset of the harmonic numbers, but this remains unproven.

===Interpolation===

The digamma function is defined as the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function
formula_34
Just as the gamma function provides a continuous interpolation of the factorials, the digamma function provides a continuous interpolation of the harmonic numbers, in the sense that 
This equation can be used to extend the definition to harmonic numbers with rational indices.

==Applications==
Many well-known mathematical problems have solutions involving the harmonic series and its partial sums.

===Crossing a desert===
The jeep problem or desert-crossing problem is included in a 9th-century problem collection by Alcuin, &quot;Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes&quot; (formulated in terms of camels rather than jeeps), but with an incorrect solution. The problem asks how far into the desert a jeep can travel and return, starting from a base with formula_2 loads of fuel, by carrying some of the fuel into the desert and leaving it in depots. The optimal solution involves placing depots spaced at distances formula_36 from the starting point and each other, where formula_37 is the range of distance that the jeep can travel with a single load of fuel. On each trip out and back from the base, the jeep places one more depot, refueling at the other depots along the way, and placing as much fuel as it can in the newly placed depot while still leaving enough for itself to return to the previous depots and the base. Therefore, the total distance reached on the formula_2th trip is formula_39
where formula_6 is the harmonic number. The divergence of the harmonic series implies that crossings of any length are possible with enough fuel.

For instance, for Alcuin&#x27;s version of the problem, formula_41: a camel can carry 30 measures of grain and can travel one leuca while eating a single measure, where a leuca is a unit of distance roughly equal to . The problem has formula_42: there are 90 measures of grain, enough to supply three trips. For the standard formulation of the desert-crossing problem, it would be possible for the camel to travel formula_43 leucas and return, by placing a grain storage depot 5 leucas from the base on the first trip and 12.5 leucas from the base on the second trip. However, Alcuin instead asks a slightly different question, how much grain can be transported a distance of 30 leucas without a final return trip, and either strands some camels in the desert or fails to account for the amount of grain consumed by a camel on its return trips.

===Stacking blocks===
In the block-stacking problem, one must place a pile of formula_2 identical rectangular blocks, one per layer, so that they hang as far as possible over the edge of a table without falling. The top block can be placed with formula_45 of its length extending beyond the next lower block. If it is placed in this way, the next block down needs to be placed with at most formula_46 of its length extending beyond the next lower block, so that the center of mass of the top two block is supported and they do not topple. The third block needs to be placed with at most formula_47 of its length extending beyond the next lower block, and so on. In this way, it is possible to place the formula_2 blocks in such a way that they extend formula_49 lengths beyond the table, where formula_6 is the harmonic number. The divergence of the harmonic series implies that there is no limit on how far beyond the table the block stack can extend. For stacks with one block per layer, no better solution is possible, but significantly more overhang can be achieved using stacks with more than one block per layer.

===Counting primes and divisors===

In 1737, Leonhard Euler observed that, as a formal sum, the harmonic series is equal to an Euler product in which each term comes from a prime number: formula_51 where formula_52 denotes the set of prime numbers. The left equality comes from applying the distributive law to the product and recognizing the resulting terms as the prime factorizations of the terms in the harmonic series, and the right equality uses the standard formula for a geometric series. The product is divergent, just like the sum, but if it converged one could take logarithms and obtain formula_53
Here, each logarithm is replaced by its Taylor series, and the constant formula_54 on the right is the evaluation of the convergent series of terms with exponent greater than one. It follows from these manipulations that the sum of reciprocals of primes, on the right hand of this equality, must diverge, for if it converged these steps could be reversed to show that the harmonic series also converges, which it does not. An immediate corollary is that there are infinitely many prime numbers, because a finite sum cannot diverge. Although Euler&#x27;s work is not considered adequately rigorous by the standards of modern mathematics, it can be made rigorous by taking more care with limits and error bounds. Euler&#x27;s conclusion that the partial sums of reciprocals of primes grow as a double logarithm of the number of terms has been confirmed by later mathematicians as one of Mertens&#x27; theorems, and can be seen as a precursor to the prime number theorem.

Another problem in number theory closely related to the harmonic series concerns the average number of divisors of the numbers in a range from 1 to formula_2, formalized as the average order of the divisor function,
formula_56
The operation of rounding each term in the harmonic series to the next smaller integer multiple of formula_11 causes this average to differ from the harmonic numbers by a small constant, and Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet showed more precisely that the average number of divisors is formula_58 (expressed in big O notation). Bounding the final error term more precisely remains an open problem, known as Dirichlet&#x27;s divisor problem.

===Collecting coupons===
Several common games or recreations involve repeating a random selection from a set of items until all possible choices have been selected; these include the collection of trading cards and the completion of parkrun bingo, in which the goal is to obtain all 60 possible numbers of seconds in the times from a sequence of running events. More serious applications of this problem include sampling all variations of a manufactured product for its quality control, and the connectivity of random graphs. In situations of this form, once there are formula_59 items remaining to be collected out of a total of formula_2 equally-likely items, the probability of collecting a new item in a single random choice is formula_61 and the expected number of random choices needed until a new item is collected Summing over all values of formula_59 from formula_2 shows that the total expected number of random choices needed to collect all items where formula_6 is the harmonic number.

===Analyzing algorithms===
The quicksort algorithm for sorting a set of items can be analyzed using the harmonic numbers. The algorithm operates by choosing one item as a &quot;pivot&quot;, comparing it to all the others, and recursively sorting the two subsets of items whose comparison places them before the pivot and after the pivot. In either its average-case complexity (with the assumption that all input permutations are equally likely) or in its expected time analysis of worst-case inputs with a random choice of pivot, all of the items are equally likely to be chosen as the pivot. For such cases, one can compute the probability that two items are ever compared with each other, throughout the recursion, as a function of the number of other items that separate them in the final sorted order. If items formula_13 and formula_66 are separated by formula_59 other items, then the algorithm will make a comparison between formula_13 and formula_66 only when, as the recursion progresses, it picks formula_13 or formula_66 as a pivot before picking any of the other formula_59 items between them. Because each of these formula_73 items is equally likely to be chosen first, this happens with probability formula_74. The total expected number of comparisons, which controls the total running time of the algorithm, can then be calculated by summing these probabilities over all pairs, giving formula_75
The divergence of the harmonic series corresponds in this application to the fact that, in the comparison model of sorting used for quicksort, it is not possible to sort in linear time.

==Related series==
===Alternating harmonic series===
The series
formula_76
is known as the alternating harmonic series. It is conditionally convergent by the alternating series test, but not absolutely convergent. Its sum is the natural logarithm of 2.

More precisely, the asymptotic expansion of the series begins as
formula_77
This results from the equality formula_78 and the Euler–Maclaurin formula.

Using alternating signs with only odd unit fractions produces a related series, the Leibniz formula for
formula_79

===Riemann zeta function===

The Riemann zeta function is defined for real formula_80 by the convergent series
formula_81
which for formula_82 would be the harmonic series. It can be extended by analytic continuation to a holomorphic function on all complex numbers where the extended function has a simple pole. Other important values of the zeta function include the solution to the Basel problem, Apéry&#x27;s constant proved by Roger Apéry to be an irrational number, and the &quot;critical line&quot; of complex numbers with conjectured by the Riemann hypothesis to be the only values other than negative integers where the function can be zero.

===Random harmonic series===

The random harmonic series is
formula_83
where the values formula_84 are independent and identically distributed random variables that take the two values formula_85 and formula_86 with equal It converges with probability 1, as can be seen by using the Kolmogorov three-series theorem or of the closely related Kolmogorov maximal inequality. The sum of the series is a random variable whose probability density function is for values between and decreases to near-zero for values greater or less Intermediate between these ranges, at the the probability density is formula_87 for a nonzero but very small value 

===Depleted harmonic series===

The depleted harmonic series where all of the terms in which the digit 9 appears anywhere in the denominator are removed can be shown to converge to the value . In fact, when all the terms containing any particular string of digits (in any base) are removed, the series converges.

<text>Gershom ben Judah, (c. 960–1040) best known as Rabbeinu Gershom (, &quot;Our teacher Gershom&quot;) and also commonly known to scholars of Rabbinic Judaism by the title &quot;Rabbeinu Gershom Me&#x27;Or Hagolah&quot; (&quot;Our teacher Gershom the light of the exile&quot;), was a famous Talmudist and Halakhist.

Less than a century after Gershom&#x27;s death Rashi said of him, &quot;all members of the Ashkenazi diaspora are students of his.&quot; As early as the 14th century, Asher ben Jehiel wrote that Rabbeinu Gershom&#x27;s writings were &quot;such permanent fixtures that they may well have been handed down on Mount Sinai.&quot;

He is most famous for the synod he called around 1000 CE, in which he instituted various laws and bans, including prohibiting polygamy, requiring the consent of both parties to a divorce, modifying the rules concerning those who became apostates under compulsion, and prohibiting the opening of correspondence addressed to someone else.

== Biography ==

Born in Metz in 960, Gershom was a student of Yehuda HaKohen ben Meir (Sir Léontin), who was one of the greatest authorities of his time. Having lost his first wife, Gershom married a widow named Bonna and settled at Mainz, where he devoted himself to teaching the &quot;Talmud&quot;. During his lifetime Mainz became a center of Torah and Jewish scholarship for many Jewish communities in Europe that had formerly been connected with the Babylonian . He was the spiritual guide of the fledgling Ashkenazic Jewish communities and was very influential in molding them at a time when their population was dwindling.

Students came from all over Europe to enroll in his yeshiva, and later dispersed among various communities in Germany and beyond which helped spread Jewish learning. He had many pupils from different countries, like Eleazar ben Isaac, Jacob ben Yakar, Elijah ben Menahem, and Isaac ben Eliezer Halevi. The fame of his learning eclipsed even that of the heads of the academies of Sura (city) and Pumbedita. His life conformed to his teachings. He had a son, who forsook his religion at the time of the expulsion of the Jews from Mainz in 1012. When his son converted to become a Christian, R. Gershom grieved and observed the strictures of mourning for seven days (and another seven days mourning when his son died). However, he did apparently rule leniently regarding those who had submitted to baptism to escape persecution, and who afterward returned to the Jewish fold. He strictly prohibited reproaching them with infidelity, and even gave those among them who had been slandered an opportunity to publicly pronounce the benediction in the synagogues.

== Works ==
Questions of religious law were addressed to him from all countries, and measures which he authorized had legal force among all the Jews of Europe.

Gershom&#x27;s literary activity was similarly fruitful. He is celebrated for his works in the field of Biblical exegesis, the &quot;Masorah&quot;, and lexicography. His school composed glosses on the text of the &quot;Talmud&quot;, and wrote commentaries on several treatises of the latter which were very popular and gave an impulse to the production of other works of the kind. His were inspired by the bloody persecutions of his time. Gershom also left a large number of rabbinical &quot;responsa,&quot; which are scattered throughout various collections.

He is the author of Seliha 42 – &quot;Zechor Berit Avraham&quot; (&quot;Remember the Covenant of Abraham&quot;), a liturgical poem recited by Ashkenazic Jews during the season of Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur, which includes the following stanza:

== Synod and bans (Herem of Rabbenu Gershom) ==

He is famous for his religious bans within Judaism, which include:
* The prohibition of polygamy;
* The prohibition of divorcing a woman against her will;
* The modification of the rules concerning those who became apostates under compulsion;
* The prohibition of reading another person&#x27;s private mail.
The influence of his ban can be seen in mail from the Middle Ages. A letter would contain the seal &quot;B&#x27;chadrag&quot; which meant that it was forbidden to open except by the recipient under the ban of Rabbeinu Gershom. His religious bans are still in force for Ashkenazi religious Jews and are used for establishment of law in modern Israel.
