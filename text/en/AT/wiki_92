<text>Braceface is a Canadian-Chinese animated series co-produced by Nelvana Limited and Jade Animation (Shenzhen) Company that aired on Teletoon. The show features actress Alicia Silverstone from the movie &quot;Clueless&quot; (who also voiced the titular character for the first two seasons) serving as executive producer. The episodes focus on the misadventures of Sharon Spitz, a high school student who often struggles with an unusual ability occurring in her braces, which often creates mishaps in her daily life. Although considered to be a trademark feature in the series, later episodes began to drop this narrative in favor of tackling real-world issues. Unlike most animated shows which take place in fictional cities or states, etc., this one takes place in the real-life town of Elkford, British Columbia.

==Summary==
The series, set in Elkford, British Columbia, recounts the travails of Sharon Spitz (a play on words, &quot;sharing spit&quot; being a euphemism for kissing), who is a junior high school student with braces that get in the way of leading a normal teenage life. Her braces are somehow electrically charged at all times, giving her strange abilities such as remotely operating machinery, tapping into wireless communication channels, and even discharging electricity directly into what&#x27;s in front of her, though much of these abilities are often outside her control. In the first season, she is enrolled at Mary Pickford Junior High but later on, the show progresses her into attending Elkford High School.

==Episodes==

==Production==
The series was produced by the Canadian animation studio Nelvana and Jade Animation (Shenzhen) in China, with the additional pre-production work done by Studio B Productions and Atomic Cartoons.

==Reception==
Sarah Wenk from &quot;Common Sense Media&quot; rated the series three out of five stars, stating &quot;ultimately it&#x27;s rather lightweight and, well, cartoony. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, but it could use a bit more substance and less silliness.&quot; Nancy Wellons from &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; stated &quot;What could be a wonderful premise about the struggle of adolescents to confirm and yet remain individuals instead turns into a half-hour full of inane jokes, cliched characters and bad dialogue.&quot; Evan Levine from &quot;Newspaper Enterprise Assn.&quot; wrote, &quot;The brace subplot sometimes adds an uneasy note — is it fantasy? — and can be vaguely confusing. But the show holds the possibility of being a clever takeoff of the preteen years, whether you have braces or not.&quot; Jeanne Spreier from Knight Ridder wrote, &quot;&quot;Braceface&quot; takes a refreshingly light look at junior high challenges — boys, braces, friends, popularity, parents, school — without giving in to nastiness, violence, ill-will or dejection.&quot;

In 2004, the episode &quot;Ms. Spitz Goes To Warsch &amp; Stone&quot; won an award at the Environmental Media Awards.

==Telecast and home media==
In the United States, the series originally aired on Fox Family Channel for the first season starting on June 2, 2001, with reruns on its successor ABC Family until May 26, 2003. Disney Channel later aired reruns and premiered new episodes from May 2, 2004 until September 1, 2005, but some episodes were edited for content and time. Four episodes (&quot;The Worst Date Ever. Period&quot;, &quot;Miami Vices&quot;, &quot;Whose Life Is It, Anyway?&quot; and &quot;Grey Matters&quot;) were skipped from Disney Channel airings due to their content. Half of season 2 (episodes 16 through 26) and the entirety of season 3 never aired in the United States until years later when services stream. The opening theme song was also notably shortened during the show&#x27;s USA airings on FOX/ABC Family and Disney Channel. In Canada, it ran on Teletoon from June 30, 2001 to September 1, 2004.

Internationally, the series aired on Fox Kids and Fox8 in Australia, and Channel 5 and Pop Girl in the UK. It also aired on Nickelodeon in Germany and South Africa. In India, the series aired on Star One. It aired in Ireland on RTÉ Two from September 3, 2001 to 2005. In Japan, Braceface was aired on STAR Plus Japan. In the Netherlands, the show aired on Fox Kids/Jetix. In Romania and Hungary, it aired on Minimax.

In Canada, DVD releases of the series were released by KaBOOM! Entertainment, and in the United States, DVDs were released by Funimation Entertainment.

In the UK, Maverick Entertainment released a DVD, titled &quot;Brace Yourself&quot; in 2006, which contains the first four episodes. Fremantle Home Entertainment later released two more DVDs.

Currently, the series is now streaming on both networks, FilmRise Kids and Tubi. The series is also available to stream on Amazon Prime Video, iTunes, Google Play, and episodes 1-13 on YouTube (thru Nelvana&#x27;s Keep It Weird Channel). Nickelodeon Canada aired reruns of the series on weeknights at 4:00 AM from February 28, 2022, to August 26, 2024. YTV also aired reruns for some months in 2024.

==Planned revival==
In a podcast interview with The Relunchables, series creator Melissa Clark revealed that, as early as 2015, she was in talks with Nelvana about a &quot;Braceface&quot; reboot that would be set twenty years after the original series. She said that Nelvana had wanted her to write the pilot and first three episodes, and that they would be in contact to discuss further details, but they never reached back out.

<text>The themes or  (, , , ) were the main military and administrative divisions of the middle Byzantine Empire. They were established in the mid-7th century in the aftermath of the Slavic migrations to Southeastern Europe and Muslim conquests of parts of Byzantine territory, and replaced the earlier provincial system established by Diocletian and Constantine the Great. In their origin, the first themes were created from the areas of encampment of the field armies of the East Roman army, and their names corresponded to the military units that had existed in those areas. The theme system reached its apogee in the 9th and 10th centuries, as older themes were split up and the conquest of territory resulted in the creation of new ones. The original theme system underwent significant changes in the 11th and 12th centuries, but the term remained in use as a provincial and financial circumscription until the very end of the Empire.

==History==
===Background===
During the late 6th and early 7th centuries, the Byzantine Empire was under frequent attack from all sides. The Sassanid Empire was pressing from the east on Syria, Egypt, and Anatolia. Slavs and Avars raided Thrace, Macedonia, Illyricum, and southern Greece and settled in the Balkans. The Lombards occupied northern Italy, largely unopposed. In order to face the mounting pressure, in the more distant provinces of the West, recently regained by Justinian I (r. 527–565), Emperor Maurice (r. 582–602) combined supreme civil and military authority in the person of an &quot;exarch&quot;, a viceroy, forming the exarchates of Ravenna and Africa. These developments overturned the strict division of civil and military offices, which had been one of the cornerstones of the reforms of Diocletian (r. 284–305). Said administrative restructurings also found a precedent in Justinian&#x27;s broad reorganization in the western conquests, denoting combined powers to the newly established Praetorian prefects of Africa (&quot;Eparchos tes Afrikís&quot;) and Italy (&quot;Eparchos tes Italías&quot;) respectively.

Justinian also endowed governors (&quot;eparchs&quot;, &quot;stratelates&quot;) of the eastern provinces plagued by brigandage and foreign invasions with military and administrative powers, formally abolishing the empire&#x27;s dioceses, Diocletian&#x27;s main administrative structure, but more importantly, he had also created the exceptional combined military-civilian circumscription of the and following the norm, abolished the Diocese of Egypt putting a (Greek: &quot;stratelates&quot;) with combined authority at the head of each of its old provinces instead. The empire maintained this precedent structure until the 640s, when the eastern part of the Empire faced the onslaught of the Muslim Caliphate. The rapid Muslim conquest of Syria and Egypt and consequent Byzantine losses in manpower and territory meant that the Empire found itself struggling for survival.

In order to respond to this unprecedented crisis, the Empire was drastically reorganized. As established by Hellenistic political practice, philosophies and Orthodox doctrines, power had been concentrated in military leaders &quot;strategoi&quot; who acted as viceroys in their respective &quot;&quot;théma&quot;, being appointed by the emperor alone. Their main function around each was the collection of taxes from the different communities &quot;chora&quot;, &quot;komai&quot; and from the different states &quot;proasteion&quot;&quot; as well as the management of fast and flexible provincial armies. The remaining imperial territory in Asia Minor was divided into four large themes, and although some elements of the earlier civil administration survived, they were subordinated to the governing general or .

===Origins===
The origin and early nature of the themes has been heavily disputed amongst scholars. The very name is of uncertain etymology, but most scholars follow Constantine Porphyrogennetos, who records that it originates from Greek (&quot;placement&quot;). The date of their creation is also uncertain. For most of the 20th century, the establishment of the themes was attributed to the Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–641), during the last of the Byzantine–Sassanid Wars. Most notable amongst the supporters of this thesis was George Ostrogorsky who based this opinion on an extract from the chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor mentioning the arrival of Heraclius &quot;in the lands of the themes&quot; for the year 622. According to Ostrogorsky, this &quot;shows that the process of establishing troops (themes) in specific areas of Asia Minor has already begun at this time.&quot; This view has been objected to by other historians however, and more recent scholarship dates their creation later, to the period from the 640s to the 660s, under Constans II (r. 641–668). It has further been shown that, contrary to Ostrogorsky&#x27;s conception of the being established from the outset as distinct, well-defined regions where a held joint military and civil authority, the term originally seems to have referred exclusively to the armies themselves, and only in the later 7th or early 8th centuries did it come to be transferred to the districts where these armies were encamped as well.

Tied to the question of chronology is also the issue of a corresponding social and military transformation. The traditional view, championed by Ostrogorsky, holds that the establishment of the themes also meant the creation of a new type of army. In his view, instead of the old force, heavily reliant on foreign mercenaries, the new Byzantine army was based on native farmer-soldiers living on state-leased military estates (compare the organization of the Sasanian ). More recent scholars however have posited that the formation of the themes did not constitute a radical break with the past, but rather a logical extension of pre-existing, 6th-century trends, and that its direct social impact was minimal.

=== First themes: 640s–770s ===


What is clear is that at some point in the mid-7th century, probably in the late 630s and 640s, the Empire&#x27;s field armies were withdrawn to Anatolia, the last major contiguous territory remaining to the Empire, and assigned to the districts that became known as the themes. Territorially, each of the new themes encompassed several of the older provinces, and with a few exceptions, seems to have followed the old provincial boundaries. The first four themes were those of the Armeniacs, Anatolics and Thracesians, and the Opsician theme. The Armeniac Theme (, ), first mentioned in 667, was the successor of the Army of Armenia. It occupied the old areas of the Pontus, Armenia Minor and northern Cappadocia, with its capital at Amasea. The Anatolic Theme (, &quot;&quot;), first mentioned in 669, was the successor of the Army of the East (, ). It covered southern central Asia Minor, and its capital was Amorium. Together, these two themes formed the first tier of defence of Byzantine Anatolia, bordering Muslim Armenia and Syria respectively. The Thracesian Theme (, ), first mentioned clearly as late as c. 740, was the successor of the Army of Thrace, and covered the central western coast of Asia Minor (Ionia, Lydia and Caria), with its capital most likely at Chonae. The Opsician Theme (, ), first mentioned in 680, was constituted from the imperial retinue (in Latin ). It covered northwestern Asia Minor (Bithynia, Paphlagonia and parts of Galatia), and was based at Nicaea. Uniquely, its commander retained his title of (, &quot;count&quot;).

In addition, the great naval division of the Carabisians or &quot;Karabisianoi&quot; (, &quot;people of the [ships]&quot;), first mentioned in 680, was probably formed of the remains of the Army of the Illyricum or, more likely, the old &quot;quaestura exercitus&quot;. It never formed a theme proper, but occupied parts of the southern coast of Asia Minor and the Aegean Islands, with its seat most likely at Samos. It provided the bulk of the Byzantine navy facing the new Arab fleets, which after the Battle of the Masts contested control of the Mediterranean with the Empire. In the event, the Carabisians would prove unsatisfactory in that role, and by 720 they had been disbanded in favour of a fully fledged naval theme, that of the Cibyrrhaeots (, &quot;Thema Kibyrrhaiotōn&quot;), which encompassed the southern coasts of Asia Minor and the Aegean islands.

The part of the region of Thrace under Byzantine control was probably constituted as a theme at about 680, as a response to the Bulgar threat, although for a time the command over Thrace appears to have been exercised by the Count of the &quot;Opsikion&quot;. Successive campaigns by the emperors of the Heraclian dynasty in Greece also led to the recovery of control of Central Greece from Slavic invaders, and to the establishment of the theme of Hellas there between 687 and 695. Sicily too was formed as a theme by the end of the 7th century, but the imperial possessions in mainland Italy remained under the exarch of Ravenna or the local &quot;doukes&quot;, as did Byzantine Africa until the fall of Carthage in 698. At the same time, Crete and the imperial exclave of Cherson in the Crimea formed independent &quot;archontiai&quot;.

Thus, by the turning of the century, the themes had become the dominant feature of imperial administration. Their large size and power however made their generals prone to revolt, as had been evidenced in the turbulent period 695–715, and would again during the great revolt of Artabasdos in 741–742. The suppression of Artabasdos&#x27; revolt heralded the first significant changes in the Anatolian themes: the over-mighty &quot;Opsikion&quot; was broken up with the creation of two new themes, the Bucellarian Theme and the Optimates, while the role of imperial guard was assumed by a new type of professional force, the imperial &quot;tagmata&quot;.

=== Height of the theme system, 780s–950s ===

Despite the prominence of the themes, it was some time before they became the basic unit of the imperial administrative system. Although they had become associated with specific regions by the early 8th century, it took until the end of the 8th century for the civil fiscal administration to begin being organized around them, instead of following the old provincial system. This process, resulting in unified control over both military and civil affairs of each theme by its &quot;strategos&quot;, was complete by the mid-9th century, and is the &quot;classical&quot; thematic model mentioned in such works as the &quot;Klētorologion&quot; and the &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot;.

At the same time, the need to protect the Anatolian heartland of Byzantium from the Arab raids led to the creation, in the later 8th and early 9th centuries, of a series of small frontier districts, the &quot;kleisourai&quot; or &quot;kleisourarchiai&quot; (&quot;defiles, enclosures&quot;). The term was previously used to signify strategically important, fortified mountain passages, and was now expanded to entire districts which formed separate commands under a &quot;kleisourarchēs&quot;, tasked with guerrilla warfare and locally countering small to mid-scale incursions and raids. Gradually, most of these were elevated to full themes.

=== Decline of the system, 960s–1070s ===
With the beginning of the Byzantine offensives in the East and the Balkans in the 10th century, especially under the warrior-emperors Nikephoros II (r. 963–969), John I Tzimiskes (r. 969–976) and Basil II (r. 976–1025), newly gained territories were also incorporated into themes, although these were generally smaller than the original themes established in the 7th and 8th centuries.
At this time, a new class of themes, the so-called &quot;minor&quot; () or &quot;Armenian&quot; themes () appear, which Byzantine sources clearly differentiate from the traditional &quot;great&quot; or &quot;Roman&quot; themes (). Most consisted merely of a fortress and its surrounding territory, with a junior &quot;stratēgos&quot; (called by the Arabs and by the Armenians) as a commander and about 1,000 men, chiefly infantry, as their garrison. As their name reveals, they were mostly populated by Armenians, either indigenous or settled there by the Byzantine authorities. One of their peculiarities was the extremely large number of officers (the theme of Charpezikion alone counted 22 senior and 47 junior &quot;tourmarchai&quot;).

While well suited for defence, the &quot;Armenian&quot; themes were incapable of responding to major invasions or undertake sustained offensive campaigns on their own. Thus, from the 960s, more and more professional regiments, both from the old &quot;tagmata&quot; and newly raised formations, were stationed along the border. To command them as well as coordinate the forces of the small frontier themes, a number of large regional commands (&quot; or &quot;), under a &quot;doux&quot; or &quot;katepano&quot;, were set up. In the East, the three original such commands, set up by John Tzimiskes, were those of the &quot;doukes&quot; of Antioch, Chaldia and Mesopotamia. As Byzantium expanded into Greater Armenia in the early 11th century, these were complemented or replaced by the commands of Iberia, Vaspurakan, Edessa and Ani. In the same vein, the &quot;Armenian&quot; themes seem to have been placed under a single &quot;strategos&quot; in the mid-11th century.

The series of soldier-emperors culminating in Basil II led to a situation where by 1025 Byzantium was more powerful than any of its enemies. At the same time, the mobile, professional forces of the &quot;tagmata&quot; gained in importance over the old thematic armies (and fleets) of the interior, which soon began to be neglected. Indeed, from the early 11th century military service was increasingly commuted to cash payments. While the frontier ducates were able to meet most local threats, the dissolution of the old theme-based defensive system deprived the Byzantine defensive system of any strategic depth. Coupled with increasing reliance on foreign mercenaries and the forces of allied and vassal states, as well as the revolts and civil wars resulting from the widening rift between the civilian bureaucracy in Constantinople and the land-holding military elites (the &quot;dynatoi&quot;), by the time of the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, the Byzantine army was already undergoing a severe crisis and collapsed completely in the battle&#x27;s aftermath.

=== Change and decline: 11th–12th centuries ===
The Komnenian era saw a brief restoration of the empire&#x27;s fortunes as the force now known as the &#x27;Komnenian army&#x27; was established by Alexios I Komnenos, marking a decisive break with the thematic system. The new army was highly centralized in the person of the emperor and the ruling dynasty, and provided an element of stability which characterized the Komnenian restoration. It was noticeably more reliant on mercenaries such as the Varangian guard than the previous army, reducing the importance of the themes. The &quot;strategoi&quot; increasingly lost power as the empire centralized. The emperors often appointed relatives to the governorships, reducing their autonomous character and solidifying centralized imperial administration.

The Komnenian restoration required a new system to manage the severely weakened themes of Anatolia due to the catastrophe of Manzikert. The themes followed the Kommenian era trend of greater imperial centralization with the governors being members of the imperial family, owing their allegiance solely to the emperor. This eroded the old independent character of the once large Anatolian themes. The new military governors (called Doux or &quot;Katepanos&quot; indiscriminately) assumed strongly centralized roles on the emperor&#x27;s behalf so that the influx of landed &quot;pronoia&quot; foreigners in military service could be regulated and counteracted in cases of uprising. The governorships were specifically reserved for relatives of the Komnenian family alone and though efficient emergency measures, it successfully turned the empire into a dependency on foreign mercenaries, yielding the mass of native Greeks and making it unprecedentedly subordinate to the will of its European counterparts.

Each Theme was overseen by a &quot;Katepanos&quot; or &quot;Doux&quot;, whose authorities was both military and civil, subdivided into &quot;Katepanakias&quot; encompassing the old &quot;Tourmas&quot;, now each ruled by a Praktor instead of a &quot;Tourmarches&quot; fulfilling the same civic and military roles now widely in the hands of &quot;pronoiars&quot;. The pronoiars became the bulk of the imperial tagmata&#x27;s reserves, slowly taking their place side by side with the totally lawless landed monasteries and the &quot;dynatoi,&quot; who after Alexios&#x27;s tax reforms could formalize the various illegally acquired towns and communes as long as they could secure the full taxation of their new domains by the fisc, a process worse fueled by the extensive chrysobulas of different institutions granted by the monarch.

The Byzantine army of the Komnenian era never managed to field the manpower of the themes in their heyday, and the new system proved more expensive to maintain in the long run. It also relied on a succession of strong soldier-emperors to be effective. With the death of Manuel I Komnenos in 1180, a new period of decline set in.

=== Late Byzantine &quot;themata&quot; ===
The neglect under the Angeloi dynasty and the weakening of central authority made the themes increasingly irrelevant in the late 12th century. Regional civil authorities such as the &#x27;despotates&#x27; grew in power as central authority collapsed, rendering the themes moribund by the onset of the Palaiologos dynasty&#x27;s rule.

The now irrelevant micro provinces under imperial control were organized directly into &quot;katepanakias&quot; or &quot;kephalatikion&quot; each also ruled by a &quot;Katepan&quot; or &quot;Kephale&quot; with military and civic powers centered around forts and major passes, relegating all minor tasks to deputies.

==Organization==
The term &quot;thema&quot; was ambiguous, referring both to a form of military tenure and to an administrative division. A theme was an arrangement of plots of land given for farming to the soldiers &quot;stratiotai&quot; coexisting with different villages and towns, &quot;&quot;Komai&quot;,&quot; &quot;&quot;Chora&quot; which were taxed for rapid and continuous revenue for the state with an easy and simple handling for a more direct control of the empire by the emperor alone or his viceroys, which ultimately, was a simplified Hellenistic and fiscal administrative principle adapted for war times. The soldiers were still technically a military unit, under the command of a strategos, they did not own the land they worked as it was still controlled by the state. Therefore, for its use the soldiers&#x27; pay was reduced. By accepting this proposition, the participants agreed that their descendants would also serve in the military and work in a theme, thus simultaneously reducing the need for unpopular conscription as well as cheaply maintaining the military. It also allowed for the settling of conquered lands, as there was always a substantial addition made to public lands &quot;proasteion&quot;&quot; during a conquest.

The commander of a theme, however, did not only command his soldiers. He united the civil and military jurisdictions in the territorial area in question. Thus the division set up by Diocletian between civil governors (&quot;praesides&quot; etc.) and military commanders (&quot;duces&quot; etc.) was abolished, and the Empire returned to a system much more similar to that of the Republic or the Principate and directly linkeable to the system of Eparchies and Strategiai set up in the Hellenistic Seleucid and Mithridatric Kingdoms respectively, which were military in origin and organization as well, where provincial governors had also commanded the armies in their area.

The following table illustrates the thematic structure as found in the Thracesian Theme, c. 902-936:

This list includes the large &quot;traditional&quot; themes established in the period from the inception of the theme system in c. 660 to the beginning of the great conquests in c. 930 and the creation of the new, smaller themes.

Notes:&lt;br&gt;
† naval theme (in Greek , θέμα ναυτικόν)&lt;br&gt;
§ Originally established as a &quot;kleisoura&quot;

==List of new themes, 930s–1060s==
These were the new major or minor themes (provinces), established during the Byzantine conquests, in the East (the so-called &quot;Armenian&quot; themes or generalships, ), in Italy and in the Balkans.

<text>Spider-Man is a 2002 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man. Directed by Sam Raimi from a screenplay by David Koepp, it is the first installment in Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy. Produced by Columbia Pictures and Laura Ziskin Productions in association with Marvel Enterprises, it stars Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and Rosemary Harris. The story follows timid teenager Peter Parker, who gains superhuman abilities after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider. He adopts the masked persona &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and begins to fight crime in New York City, facing the malevolent Green Goblin in the process.

Development of a live-action Spider-Man film began in 1975, but stalled for nearly 25 years due to licensing and financial issues. Columbia Pictures finally licensed the project for a worldwide release in 1999. Koepp was hired to create a working screenplay, which was eventually rewritten by Scott Rosenberg and refined by Alvin Sargent. Various directors were considered before Raimi was hired in 2000. Filming took place in Los Angeles and New York City from January to June 2001. Danny Elfman composed the musical score, while Sony Pictures Imageworks handled the visual effects.

&quot;Spider-Man&quot; premiered at the Mann Village Theater on April 29, 2002, and was released in the United States on May 3, by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised Raimi&#x27;s direction, the story, the performances, visual effects, action sequences, and musical score. It was the first film to reach $100 million in a single weekend, as well as the most successful film based on a comic book at the time. With a box office gross of $826 million worldwide against its $139 million budget, it was the third highest-grossing film of 2002, the highest-grossing superhero film, and the sixth-highest-grossing film overall at the time of release. The film garnered nominations for Best Sound and Best Visual Effects at the 75th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. &quot;Spider-Man&quot; is credited for redefining the modern superhero genre and the summer blockbuster. It was followed by two sequels, both directed by Raimi: &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; (2004) and &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; (2007). Maguire and Dafoe later reprised their roles in &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021), which explores the concept of the multiverse and links the Raimi trilogy to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

==Plot==

On a high school field trip, Peter Parker visits a Columbia University genetics laboratory with his best friend, Harry Osborn, and his love interest, Mary Jane Watson. There, he is bitten by a genetically engineered spider, and falls ill upon returning home. Meanwhile, Harry&#x27;s father Norman tests a performance-enhancing chemical on himself in an attempt to secure a military contract for Oscorp, the company he founded. The chemical causes him to go insane and kill one of his scientists.

The next day, Peter develops spider-like abilities, including enhanced strength, senses, agility and speed, organic webbing in his wrists, and the ability to cling to walls. Hoping to buy a car to impress Mary Jane, Peter enters an underground wrestling event and wins his first match, but is swindled out of his earnings. Soon after, Peter&#x27;s Uncle Ben is killed by a thief who robbed the wrestling event, and whom Peter let escape. Peter pursues the thief, who eventually falls to his death. Meanwhile, a crazed Norman sabotages a product test by an Oscorp rival and kills several people.

Upon graduating, Peter begins using his abilities to fight crime, donning a costume and adopting the alias &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. J. Jonah Jameson, the publisher of the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; newspaper, hires Peter as a freelance photographer, since he can provide high-quality images of Spider-Man. When Oscorp&#x27;s board of directors decides to oust Norman and sell the company, Norman assassinates them while wearing a disguise during the Unity Day festival. Peter fends off Norman and rescues Mary Jane. Afterwards, Jameson bestows the name &quot;the Green Goblin&quot; upon the mysterious masked killer.

Norman offers Peter a place at his side, but Peter refuses. They fight, and Peter flees after being wounded. Peter&#x27;s Aunt May invites Mary Jane, Harry, and Norman over for Thanksgiving dinner. Norman sees Peter&#x27;s injury and realizes that he’s Spider-Man. Later, Norman attacks and injures May, who is hospitalized. Peter is still unaware of the Goblin&#x27;s identity, but realizes that the Goblin is targeting his loved ones. While visiting the hospital, Mary Jane confesses to Peter her infatuation with Spider-Man, who has rescued her twice. Harry, who is dating Mary Jane, sees her holding Peter&#x27;s hand and assumes she has feelings for him. A distraught Harry tells his father that Peter loves Mary Jane, unknowingly revealing Spider-Man&#x27;s biggest weakness.

That night, Norman captures Mary Jane and a tram car full of children. He tells Peter to choose whom to rescue, then drops them both from the Queensboro Bridge. Peter saves everyone, then lowers them to a nearby barge for safety. An enraged Norman throws Peter into an abandoned building, then brutally beats him. After Norman reveals his intentions to kill Mary Jane, Peter finds the strength to fight back. Norman reveals his identity and begs for forgiveness, while discreetly preparing to impale Peter with his glider. Warned by his spider-sense, Peter dodges the attack, and the glider fatally skewers Norman instead. Before dying, Norman begs Peter not to reveal his identity to Harry. Peter takes Norman&#x27;s body to the Osborn house, where he is confronted by Harry, who grabs a gun. Before Harry can fire, Peter escapes.

At Norman&#x27;s funeral, Harry vows revenge on Spider-Man, whom he holds responsible for his father&#x27;s death. Mary Jane then confesses to Peter that she loves him. Peter, however, feels he must protect her from his enemies, so he hides his true feelings and tells her that they can only be friends. As Peter leaves, he recalls Ben&#x27;s words: &quot;With great power comes great responsibility.&quot;

== Production ==

===Development===

Beginning in 1975, Marvel Comics made plans to bring its characters to the big screen. In the early 1980s, following the critical and commercial success of &quot;Superman&quot; (1978), which in turn was based on rival DC Comics’ flagship character Superman, Marvel was in negotiations with film producers to bring their flagship character Spider-Man to the big screen. Producer Roger Corman was the first to hold an option on the Spider-Man property and began to develop the film at Orion Pictures. Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee was brought on to write a screenplay which featured Cold War themes and Doctor Octopus as the primary antagonist. The project did not come into fruition following budgetary disputes between Corman and Lee, as well as the critical and commercial failure of &quot;Superman III&quot; (1983) making film adaptations of comic books a low priority. 

The film rights were then acquired by Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus of The Cannon Group for $225,000 in 1985. The two were not familiar with the character&#x27;s background and mistook Spider-Man for a werewolf-like character. Leslie Stevens, creator of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, was hired to write a screenplay based on this concept. Stevens&#x27; script depicted Peter Parker as a photographer who is subjected to a mad scientist&#x27;s experiment, which transforms him into a human tarantula. Tobe Hooper, who was preparing to shoot &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot; and &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot; for Cannon, signed on to direct. Lee hated the horror route the studio was taking with the character and demanded that a new script be written that was closer to the source material.

By 1985, a new script was being written by Ted Newsom and John Brancato. In this version, Peter Parker receives his spider-like abilities from a cyclotron experiment. Doctor Octopus served as the antagonist and was written as Parker&#x27;s mentor turned enemy. Barney Cohen was brought in to do a rewrite which added humor, additional action scenes, and a supporting villain. Newsom and Brancato had John Cusack in mind for the part of Peter Parker. 

Cannon hired Joseph Zito to direct the film having previously directed the commercially successful &quot;Invasion U.S.A.&quot; for the studio. For the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, the studio considered Tom Cruise while Zito was interested in casting actor and stuntman Scott Leva who had previously done promotional appearances as Spider-Man for Marvel. Bob Hoskins was considered for Doctor Octopus while Lauren Bacall and Katharine Hepburn were considered for Aunt May. The role of Uncle Ben was considered for Gregory Peck and Paul Newman. Lee expressed his desire to make a cameo appearance as J. Jonah Jameson in the film. The project was tentatively titled &quot;Spider-Man: The Movie&quot; and was budgeted between $15–20 million. Following the critical and financial failure of &quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot; and &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot;, both of which were produced by Cannon, the budget for &quot;Spider-Man: The Movie&quot; was cut to $7 million. Joseph Zito was unwilling to compromise and stepped down as director. He was replaced by Albert Pyun who was willing to make the film at a lower budget. The project was cancelled following Cannon&#x27;s acquisition by Pathé and Golan&#x27;s departure from the studio.

Golan extended his option on Spider-Man during his tenure as CEO of 21st Century Film Corporation. By 1989, Golan attempted to revive the project using the original script, budget, and storyboards developed at Cannon. In order to receive production funds, Golan sold the television rights to Viacom, home video rights to Columbia Pictures, and theatrical rights to Carolco Pictures where James Cameron became attached to write and direct the film. Cameron had previously met with Stan Lee to discuss a possible X-Men film until Lee convinced Cameron that he would be a good choice to direct a Spider-Man film. Cameron said superheroes were always fanciful to him. 

James Cameron submitted a treatment to Carolco in 1993, which served as a darker, more mature take on the character&#x27;s mythos. In addition to featuring Spider-Man&#x27;s origin story, it also included reimagined versions of the villains Electro and Sandman; the former was portrayed as a megalomaniacal businessman named Carlton Strand, while the latter was written as Strand&#x27;s personal bodyguard named Boyd. Cameron&#x27;s treatment also featured heavy profanity, and even a sex scene between Spider-Man and Mary Jane Watson atop the Brooklyn Bridge. Carolco set a $50 million budget for &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, but progress stalled when Golan sued Carolco for attempting to make the film without his involvement. At the time, Cameron had recently completed &quot;True Lies&quot; for 20th Century Fox as part of a production deal with the studio. Fox attempted to acquire the film rights to Spider-Man for Cameron but this proved unsuccessful. At this point, James Cameron had abandoned the project and began work on &quot;Titanic&quot; and other things. He would reveal in a 1997 interview on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; that he had &quot;Titanic&quot; star Leonardo DiCaprio in mind for the lead role. 

In 1995, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) acquired 21st Century Film Corporation&#x27;s rights to produce the film, which had given them access to the previous Spider-Man scripts. MGM then sued Viacom, Sony Pictures, and Marvel, who they accused of fraud in the original deal with Cannon. The following year, 21st Century, Carolco, and Marvel would all file for bankruptcy.

No film studio showed interest in a Spider-Man movie following the disastrous reception of &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; in 1997, after which film studios no longer took the superhero genre seriously and had the perception that &quot;comic books were for kids&quot;. However, the release of &quot;Blade&quot; by New Line Cinema in 1998 and the development of &quot;X-Men&quot; by 20th Century Fox convinced some studios that a Marvel character &quot;could carry on&quot; a movie. Marvel would emerge from bankruptcy in 1998 and declare that Menahem Golan&#x27;s option had expired and that the rights had reverted to them. Marvel would then sell the film rights to Sony Pictures Entertainment, Columbia Pictures&#x27; parent company for $7 million. The deal came into effect in March 1999.

In April 1999, although Sony Pictures optioned from MGM all preceding script versions of a &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film, it only exercised the options on &quot;the Cameron material&quot;, which contractually included a multi-author screenplay and a forty-five-page &quot;scriptment&quot; credited only to James Cameron. The studio announced they were not hiring Cameron himself to direct the film nor would they be using his script. 

The studio lined up several potential directors, including Roland Emmerich, Jan de Bont, Chris Columbus, Barry Sonnenfeld, Tim Burton, Michael Bay, Ang Lee, David Fincher, Tony Scott and M. Night Shyamalan. However, most of the directors approached were less interested in the job than in the story itself. Fincher did not want to depict the origin story as he felt it was &quot;dumb&quot;, pitching the film as being based on &quot;The Night Gwen Stacy Died&quot; storyline, but the studio weren&#x27;t interested. Columbus would later turn down the project to direct &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot; instead. Burton expressed a lack of interest by remarking that he was &quot;just a DC guy&quot;, given his previous work on &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, as well as the ill-fated &quot;Superman Lives&quot;. Amy Pascal&#x27;s choice for director was Sam Raimi. Raimi was attached to direct in January 2000, for a summer 2001 release. He had been a fan of the comic book during his youth, and his passion for &quot;Spider-Man&quot; earned him the job. Raimi&#x27;s agent Josh Donen warned him that he was not Sony&#x27;s preferred choice for the job, leading Raimi to cite all his reasons for which he would be the ideal director for the project during a meeting with Pascal, producer Laura Ziskin, Calley, Marvel Studios chief Avi Arad and film executive Matt Tolmach before abruptly ending his pitch after one hour, not wanting to overstay if Sony&#x27;s executives did not want him. 
David Koepp was brought aboard to write the screenplay and Cameron&#x27;s work became the basis of his first draft screenplay, often word for word. Koepp said that Cameron&#x27;s script was &quot;influential&quot;. Koepp pitched the idea of having Peter Parker not getting his Spider-Man suit until after the film&#x27;s first forty five minutes so they could stretch out the origin story and that Peter and Mary Jane would not get together at the end, feeling that them ending apart was romantic. Cameron&#x27;s versions of the Marvel villains Electro and Sandman remained the antagonists. 

Koepp&#x27;s rewrite substituted the Green Goblin as the main antagonist and added Doctor Octopus as the secondary antagonist. Raimi felt the Green Goblin and the surrogate father-son theme between Norman Osborn and Peter Parker would be more interesting, thus, he dropped Doctor Octopus from the film. In June, Columbia hired Scott Rosenberg to rewrite Koepp&#x27;s material. Remaining a constant in all the rewrites was the &quot;organic webshooter&quot; idea from the Cameron &quot;scriptment&quot;. Raimi felt he would stretch the audience&#x27;s suspension of disbelief too far to have Parker invent mechanical webshooters. This decision was controversial with long-time fans.

Rosenberg removed Doctor Octopus and created several new action sequences. Raimi felt adding a third origin story would make the film too complex. Sequences removed from the final film had Spider-Man protecting Maximilian Fargas, the wheelchair-using Oscorp executive, from the Goblin, and Spider-Man defusing a hostage situation on a train. As production neared, Ziskin hired award-winning writer Alvin Sargent, to polish the dialogue, primarily between Parker and Mary Jane. Columbia gave the Writers Guild of America a list of four writers as contributors to the final &quot;Spider-Man&quot; script: Rosenberg, Sargent and James Cameron, all three of whom voluntarily relinquished credit to the fourth, Koepp.

=== Casting ===
For the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, the filmmakers sought an actor who was not excessively tall or handsome, but who had the &quot;heart and soul&quot; for the audience to identify with. The studio expressed interest in Leonardo DiCaprio, Freddie Prinze Jr., Chris O&#x27;Donnell, Jude Law, Chris Klein, Ewan McGregor, Wes Bentley, and Heath Ledger. DiCaprio had been considered for the role in 1995 by James Cameron. Scott Speedman, Jay Rodan and James Franco were also involved in screen tests for the part. Joe Manganiello auditioned, but was cast as the bully Flash instead.

Tobey Maguire was cast as Peter Parker/Spider-Man in July 2000, having been Raimi&#x27;s first choice for the role after he saw Maguire in &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot;. The studio was initially hesitant to cast someone who did not seem to fit the ranks of &quot;adrenaline-pumping, tail-kicking titans&quot;, but Maguire managed to impress studio executives with his audition. The actor signed a deal in the range of $3 to $4million with higher salary options for two sequels. To prepare for the role, Maguire improved his physique over several months by training with a physical trainer, a yoga instructor, a martial arts expert, and a climbing expert. He studied spiders and learned how to perform arachnid-like movements.

Nicolas Cage, Jason Isaacs, John Malkovich and Billy Bob Thornton were considered for the role of Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, but turned it down. Willem Dafoe was selected for the part in November 2000. He was intrigued by the prospect of working with Raimi and by the idea of a film based on comic books. He insisted on wearing the Green Goblin costume himself, as he felt that a stuntman would not convey the character&#x27;s necessary body language. The 580-piece suit took half an hour to put on.

Kate Bosworth, Eliza Dushku, Jaime King and Mena Suvari unsuccessfully auditioned for the role of Mary Jane Watson. Kate Hudson was offered the part but turned it down. Elizabeth Banks auditioned, but was told she was too old; she was cast as Jameson&#x27;s secretary Betty Brant instead. Raimi also considered Alicia Witt for the role. Kirsten Dunst auditioned and earned the role a month before filming began. To create Mary Jane&#x27;s red hair, Dunst&#x27;s hair was dyed in the front and she wore a half-wig. The producers wanted Dunst to get her teeth straightened, but she refused.

Stan Lee was interested in playing J. Jonah Jameson, but the filmmakers felt he was too old to convincingly play the part. Lee was supportive of the eventual casting of J.K. Simmons, feeling that Simmons gave a better performance than he could have achieved. Hugh Jackman was supposed to have a cameo as the X-Men character Wolverine, but the appearance was scrapped after the production team realized they did not have the character&#x27;s costume.

===Design===

The Green Goblin&#x27;s original headgear was an animatronic mask created by Amalgamated Dynamics. Dafoe described it as a &quot;Halloween mask&quot; and &quot;kind of silly-looking&quot;. The designers then created a helmet that Dafoe termed &quot;very angular, very modern ... more like an armor.&quot; Dafoe also wanted the costume to be flexible enough to allow him to do splits.

To create Spider-Man&#x27;s costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit&#x27;s shape. One concept costume designer James Acheson became fond of was the idea of having a red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on the chest and red stripes going down the sides of the legs. In early development, Acheson experimented with a potential helmet-like design for the suit, which was then scrapped. It was designed as a single piece, including the mask. A hard shell was worn underneath the mask to make the shape of the head look better and to keep the mask tight while keeping the wearer comfortable. For scenes in which Spider-Man would take his mask off, there was an alternate suit where the mask was a separate piece. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.

For the spider that gives Peter his abilities, Raimi selected the Steatoda grossa, which was painted with red and blue makeup.

===Filming===
With &quot;Spider-Man&quot; cast, filming was set to begin in November 2000 in New York City and on Sony soundstages. The film&#x27;s release was scheduled for November 2, 2001, but was postponed to May 3, 2002, due to an extended post-production schedule.

Principal photography officially began on January 8, 2001, in Culver City, California. The project&#x27;s cinematographer, Don Burgess, shot the film with Panavision Platinum and Millennium XL cameras with Primo Lenes. After the September 11 attacks, certain sequences were re-filmed, and a shot of the Twin Towers was removed from the film. Sequences in Peter&#x27;s home and in the wrestling arena were filmed on soundstages, as was the Times Square sequence where Spider-Man and the Green Goblin battle for the first time. For this scene, a three-story set with a breakaway balcony piece was built. The scene also required shooting in Downey, California. In March, a construction worker named Tim Holcombe was killed when a forklift modified as a construction crane crashed into the construction basket he was in. The following court case led the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health to fine Sony $58,805.

In one scene in the film, Mary Jane kisses Peter while he is hanging upside down in the rain. During filming, water was pouring into Maguire&#x27;s nose, which made it difficult for him to breathe. Randy Savage insisted on doing his own stunts, one of which resulted in injury. The shot in which Peter catches Mary Jane&#x27;s food tray was achieved without visual effects and with Maguire&#x27;s hand glued to the tray. The shot took 156 takes and 16 hours to accomplish.

In Los Angeles, filming locations included the Natural History Museum (for the Columbia University laboratory where Parker is bitten), the Pacific Electricity Building (the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; offices) and Greystone Mansion (for the interiors of Norman&#x27;s home). On April 4, Spider-Man costumes were stolen, and Sony put up a $25,000 reward for their return. They were recovered after 18 months; a former studio security guard and an accomplice were arrested. Production moved to New York City for two weeks, taking in locations such as the Queensboro Bridge, the exteriors of Columbia University&#x27;s Low Memorial Library and the New York Public Library, Sunnyside, Queens and a rooftop garden in the Rockefeller Center. The crew returned to Los Angeles where production continued, and filming wrapped in June 2001. The Flatiron Building was used for the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;.

===Visual effects===
John Dykstra was hired as the film&#x27;s visual effects supervisor in May 2000. He convinced Raimi to use computer-generated imagery (CGI) for many of the stunts that were physically impossible. Raimi had used more traditional special effects in his previous films. Raimi worked hard to plan all the sequences of Spider-Man swinging from buildings, which he described as, &quot;ballet in the sky.&quot; The complexity of such sequences meant the budget rose from an initially planned $70million to around $100million. Shots were made more complicated because of the main characters&#x27; individual color schemes, so Spider-Man and the Green Goblin had to be shot separately for effects shots: Spider-Man was shot in front of a greenscreen, while the Goblin was shot against bluescreen. Shooting them together would have resulted in one character being erased from a shot.

Dykstra said the biggest difficulty of creating Spider-Man was that as the character was masked, it immediately lost a lot of characterization. Without the context of eyes or mouth, a lot of body language had to be put in so that there would be emotional content. Raimi wanted to convey the essence of Spider-Man as being, &quot;the transition that occurs between him being a young man going through puberty and being a superhero.&quot; Dykstra said his crew of animators had never reached such a level of sophistication to give subtle hints of still making Spider-Man feel like a human being. When two studio executives were shown shots of the computer generated character, they believed it was actually Maguire performing stunts. In addition, Dykstra&#x27;s crew had to composite areas of New York City and replaced every car in shots with digital models. Raimi did not want it to feel entirely like animation, so none of the shots were 100% computer-generated.

==Music==

Danny Elfman composed the musical score for &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. Its soundtrack combines traditional orchestration, ethnic percussion, and electronic elements. Its distinct ethnic characteristics are credited to Elfman, who spent a year in Africa studying its unique percussion.

==Release==
===Marketing===
After the September 11 attacks occurred in 2001, Sony recalled a &quot;Spider-Man&quot; teaser poster and a teaser trailer, both of which depicted the World Trade Center towers. The poster showed a close-up of Spider-Man&#x27;s face with the towers reflected in his eyes, while the trailer showed a helicopter getting caught in a giant spider web spun between the towers. The trailer, which according to Sony did not contain any actual footage from the film, was also removed from the home video release of &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;. Raimi later stated that the helicopter scene was originally in the film, but was removed after the attacks. A new teaser poster featuring Spider-Man and the Green Goblin was unveiled in November 2001. A month later, a new trailer debuted on television and in theaters. An additional trailer was released online and in theaters near the end of March.

To promote the release of the film, Sony partnered with CKE Restaurants to release kids meal toys at Hardee&#x27;s and Carl&#x27;s Jr. restaurants. Beginning in April 2002, the locations offered customers three different &quot;Spider-Man&quot; collector&#x27;s cups and patrons could purchase a Spider-Man figure to attach to their car radio antenna. A month later in May, &quot;Cool Combos for Kids&quot; would feature one of four different toys highlighting Spider-Man or his nemesis, the Green Goblin. KFC would then follow suit, releasing their own &quot;Spider-Man&quot; kids meal toys at their locations in the United Kingdom. Other promotional partners included Dr Pepper, Hershey&#x27;s, Kellogg&#x27;s, and Reebok.

===Theatrical===
In the United States, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; was rated &quot;PG-13&quot; for &quot;stylized violence and action&quot;. Before the film&#x27;s British theatrical release in June 2002, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) gave the film a &quot;12&quot; certificate. Due to &quot;Spider-Man&quot;″s popularity with children as young as two, this prompted much controversy. The BBFC defended its decision, arguing that the film could easily have been rated &quot;15&quot;. Despite this, North Norfolk and Breckland District Councils, in East Anglia, gave it a &quot;PG&quot; rating, and Tameside council, Manchester, rated it &quot;PG-12&quot;. In late August, the BBFC updated the cinema 12 certificate to &quot;12A&quot;, meaning children under 12 could watch a film with this certificate in cinemas if accompanied by an adult, leading Sony to re-release the film.

In March 2024, Sony announced that all of its live-action Spider-Man films would be re-released in theaters as part of Columbia Pictures&#x27; 100th anniversary celebration. &quot;Spider-Man&quot; was re-released on April 15, 2024.

===Box office===
&quot;Spider-Man&quot; was first released in theaters on May 3, 2002 in 18 markets. In the United States and Canada, it opened on 7,500 screens at 3,615 theaters and earned $114.8 million during its opening weekend, establishing a new opening weekend record. The previous record holder was &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot;, which earned $90.3 million when it opened in November 2001. &quot;Spider-Man&quot; also became the first film to gross $100 million in a single weekend (even when adjusting for inflation), and the first film to reach $100 million in three days. Additionally, the film set a record for the highest three-day gross. According to Rick Lyman of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, film industry executives expected &quot;Spider-Man&quot; to have a strong opening. Competition from other films was limited, and polls showed strong interest in Raimi&#x27;s film from every age group. However, neither executives nor polling firms predicted that the film&#x27;s earnings would exceed those of &quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot;. Upon release, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; became the number one film at the box office.

&quot;Spider-Man&quot; earned $39.4 million on its opening day, an average of $10,901 per theater. This opening-day gross was the all-time highest until 2004, when it was surpassed by the $40.4million opening of &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;. During opening weekend, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; grossed an average of $31,769 per theater. According to Box Office Mojo, this was the all-time highest per-theater average for an &quot;ultra-wide release.&quot; On its second day of release, the film set a record for the highest earnings in a single day, with $43.6 million. On its third day, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; earned $31.8 million, the highest gross at the time for a Sunday. Within four days, the film had the biggest non-holiday Monday of all time with $11 million, which increased its total gross to $125.1 million.

&quot;Spider-Man&quot; remained at the top of the box office in its second weekend, dropping 38% and grossing another $71.4 million while averaging $19,756 per theater. At the time, this was the highest-grossing second weekend of any film. &quot;Spider-Man&quot; reached the $200million mark on its ninth day of release, also a record at the time. This made it the fastest film to cross the $200 million mark, surpassing &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. At the end of its second weekend, the film brought in a 10-day total of $223,040,031. It quickly surpassed &quot;Ice Age&quot; to become the highest-grossing film of the year. &quot;Spider-Man&quot; had crossed over 149 spots on the top-grossing film chart, landing in 29th place between &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;.

The film dropped to the second position in its third weekend, behind &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;, but still made $45,036,912, dropping only 37%, averaging $12,458 per theater, and bringing the 17-day tally to $285,573,668. Its third weekend haul set the record for highest-grossing third weekend, which was first surpassed by &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009). &quot;Spider-Man&quot; would beat another record that was previously held by &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, becoming the quickest film to hit $300 million in just 22 days. It stayed at the second position in its fourth weekend, grossing $35,814,844 over the four-day Memorial Day frame, dropping only 21% while expanding to 3,876 theaters, averaging $9,240 over four days, and bringing the 25-day gross to $333,641,492. Within 66 days, it was the fastest film to approach $400 million, tying its record with &quot;Titanic&quot;. Both films held this record for two years before being surpassed by &quot;Shrek 2&quot;.

At the box office, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; became 2002&#x27;s highest-grossing film with $407,774,549 in the U.S. and Canada, defeating &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;. As of 2024, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; ranks as the 77th-highest-grossing film of all time in the U.S. and Canada, not adjusted for inflation. The film also grossed $418,002,176 from its international markets, bringing its worldwide total to $825,802,095 making it 2002&#x27;s third-highest-grossing film behind &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; and the 58th-highest-grossing film of all time, worldwide. Additionally, it was the highest-grossing Sony film of all time, beating out &quot;Men in Black&quot;. &quot;Spider-Man&quot; also surpassed &quot;Batman&quot; to become the highest-grossing superhero film of all time. The film sold an estimated 69,484,700 tickets in the US. It held the record for most tickets sold by a comic book movie until &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; topped it in 2008. As of 2020, it is still the sixth highest grossing comic book movie of all time adjusted for inflation. Only &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, &quot;Black Panther&quot;, &quot;The Avengers&quot; and &quot;&quot; have sold more tickets than &quot;Spider-Man&quot;.

Internationally, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; opened in 17 territories in its first week, earning a total of $13.3 million. It scored the second-highest opening in Iceland, Singapore and South Korea. Plus, Russia and Yugoslavia had the third best all time film opening. &quot;Spider-Man&quot; would score the biggest opening in Switzerland with $1.4 million and 160,000 admissions from 106 screens, surpassing &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;. As for Germany, it had the strongest June opening and the third best debut of any movie, behind &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; and &quot;Ice Age&quot;. Its opening screenings in France were a massive 10,645 admissions from 27 screens, beating out the French film &quot;Asterix &amp; Obelix: Mission Cleopatra&quot;. Additionally, it set the highest opening gross in Spain. Meanwhile, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; would go on to unleash new opening records in the UK during the 2002 FIFA World Cup soccer game. The film made $13.9 million from 509 screens, making it the country&#x27;s fifth biggest movie opening, trailing only behind &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot;, &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;. In addition, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; had the largest opening of any film in the UK with a BBFC certificate higher than a &quot;PG&quot; rating, staying ahead of &quot;Independence Day&quot; and &quot;Hannibal&quot;. Despite lunch matches, it still led the weekend box office to a bigger 110% week-to-week increase and a 130% year-on-year increase when &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; led the chart during its third week. It was the country&#x27;s number one film for three weeks until it was displaced by &quot;Minority Report&quot;. In India, the film was simultaneously released in English and three different languages across 250 screens, becoming the widest reach and return for a Hollywood title since &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; in 2001. It was even Sony&#x27;s first major release in the country since &quot;Godzilla&quot; in 1998. The total number of international markets that generated grosses in excess of $10million include Australia ($16.9million), Brazil ($17.4million), France, Algeria, Monaco, Morocco and Tunisia ($32.9million), Germany ($30.7million), Italy ($20.8million), Japan ($56.2million), Mexico ($31.2million), South Korea ($16.98million), Spain ($23.7million), and the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta ($45.8million).

&quot;Spider-Man&quot; became the highest-grossing superhero film of all time at the time of its release, both domestically and worldwide while surpassing &quot;Batman&quot;. Its domestic gross was eventually topped by &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008). Its worldwide gross was first surpassed by &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; (2007).

The film also held the record as Sony&#x27;s highest-grossing film domestically until 2018, when it was finally surpassed by &quot;&quot; ($404.5million).

==Home media==
&quot;Spider-Man&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on November 1, 2002, in North America and Australia, and on November 25, 2002, in the United Kingdom by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment. It set a record for having the highest single-day DVD sales, surpassing &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; and selling over 7 million DVD copies on its first day of release. The film would hold this record for a year until it was taken by &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; in 2003. As of 2022, it has the single-day record for any live-action film. In just a few days, the DVD release sold more than 11 million copies. While the VHS release sold over 6.5 million copies, the DVD release went on to become one of the best-selling live-action DVD titles of all time with over 19.5 million copies being sold. This two-disc DVD release comes in separate widescreen (1.85:1 aspect ratio) and fullscreen (1.33:1 aspect ratio) versions. Bonus features include commentaries, promotional material, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and other information on both the film and the comic books that inspired it.

Its American VHS revenue by July 2004 was $89.2million.

In the United Kingdom, the film was watched by 700,000 viewers on subscription television channel Sky Movies 1 in 2004, making it the year&#x27;s ninth most-watched film on subscription television.

The film made its Blu-ray debut in 2007 as part of the &quot;Spider-Man Trilogy&quot;. Just three years later, it was released as a separate Blu-ray on November 16, 2010. This was followed by another release on July 5, 2011. &quot;Spider-Man&quot; was also included in the &quot;Spider-Man Legacy Collection&quot;, which includes 5 Spider-Man films in a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray collection, which was released on October 17, 2017. Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy was released on Disney+ on April 21, 2023.

== Reception ==

===Critical response===
 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The casting, mainly Maguire, Dafoe and Simmons, is often cited as one of the film&#x27;s high points. Eric Harrison of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; was initially skeptical of Maguire&#x27;s casting, but later said it was difficult to imagine anyone else in the role. Mike Clark of &quot;USA Today&quot; praised the casting as well. In a positive review, Joe Morgenstern of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; said, &quot;Every action adventure needs a memorable villain, but no movie needs the strident intensity of Mr. Dafoe, who either has no interest in, or no grasp of, the sort of charmingly malign wit that Gene Hackman brought to &quot;Superman&quot; or Jack Nicholson to &quot;Batman&quot;.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; had mixed feelings about Maguire in the title role, writing: &quot;Maguire, winning as he is, never quite gets the chance to bring the two sides of Spidey—the boy and the man, the romantic and the avenger—together.&quot; Kirk Honeycutt of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; applauded the creativity of the opening credits and the upside-down kiss scene.

&quot;LA Weekly&quot; Manohla Dargis wrote, &quot;It isn&#x27;t that Spider-Man is inherently unsuited for live-action translation; it&#x27;s just that he&#x27;s not particularly interesting or, well, animated.&quot; Giving the film two and a half stars out of four, Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; criticized the scene in which Peter is given a choice between saving Mary Jane or a cable car full of children. Ebert said the visuals &quot;could have given an impression of the enormous weights and tensions involved, but instead the scene seems more like a bloodless storyboard.&quot; In a 2007 retrospective on the first two &quot;Spider-Man&quot; films, Richard George of &quot;IGN&quot; called the Green Goblin&#x27;s costume &quot;almost comically bad&quot;. He wrote of the Goblin&#x27;s mask: &quot;Not only is it not frightening, it prohibits expression.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put the upside-down kiss on its 2009 list of the best pop culture creations of the decade, saying: &quot;There&#x27;s a fine line between romantic and corny. And the rain-soaked smooch between Spider-Man and Mary Jane from 2002 tap-dances right on that line. The reason it works? Even if she suspects he&#x27;s Peter Parker, she doesn&#x27;t try to find out. And that&#x27;s sexy.&quot; In 2008, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Spider-Man&quot; 437th on its list of the 500 best films of all time.

==Accolades==

The film won several awards ranging from Teen Choice Awards to the Saturn Awards, and was also nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound (Kevin O&#x27;Connell, Greg P. Russell and Ed Novick), but lost to &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot;, respectively. While only Danny Elfman brought home a Saturn Award, Raimi, Maguire, and Dunst were all nominated for their respective positions. It also took home the People&#x27;s Choice Award for &quot;Favorite Motion Picture.&quot; The film was nominated for Favorite Movie at the Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, but lost to &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot;.
Most notably, the upside down kissing scene won Best Kiss at the MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards in 2003.

== Sequels ==
Two sequels to &quot;Spider-Man&quot; were produced and directed by Raimi. &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; was released on June 30, 2004, while &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; was released on May 4, 2007. A spin-off animated series, &quot;Spider-Man: The New Animated Series&quot;, aired from July to September 2003. It was intended to serve as a continuation of the first film.

==Video game==

A video game based on the film of the same name was released. The game was developed by Treyarch (only for the home consoles) and published by Activision, and released in 2002 for Game Boy Advance, GameCube, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and Xbox. The game has many scenes and villains that did not appear in the film. It was followed by &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; two years later to promote the release of the second film. In 2007, to promote the release of the third film, &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; was released. Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe were the only actors who reprised their roles from the film. &quot;Spider-Man: Friend or Foe&quot; was released in 2007, the games borrow the film characters, and it serves as non-canon plot of the film series.

The critical reviews for the game were positive. By July 2006, the PlayStation 2 version of &quot;Spider-Man&quot; had sold 2.1million copies and earned $74million in the United States. &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the 15th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined sales of &quot;Spider-Man&quot; console games released in the 2000s reached 6 million units in the United States by July 2006.

<doc id="146948" wikidata="Q333735" url="?curid=146948" title="Charles Haughey">
<text>Charles James Haughey (; 16 September 1925 – 13 June 2006) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who led four governments as Taoiseach: December 1979 to June 1981, March to December 1982, March 1987 to June 1989, and June 1989 to February 1992. He served as cabinet minister in various portfolios from 1964 until his dismissal during the Arms Crisis in 1970, and again from 1977 to 1979. He was leader of Fianna Fáil from 1979 to 1992. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1957 to 1992.

Haughey was the dominant Irish politician of his generation, as well as the most controversial. Upon entering government in the early 1960s, Haughey became the symbol of a new vanguard of Irish ministers. As taoiseach, he is credited by some economists with starting the positive transformation of the economy in the late 1980s. However, his career was also marked by several major scandals. Haughey was implicated in the Arms Crisis of 1970, which nearly destroyed his career. His political reputation revived, his tenure as Taoiseach was then damaged by the sensational GUBU Affair in 1982; his party leadership was challenged four times, each time unsuccessfully, earning Haughey the nickname &quot;The Great Houdini&quot;. Revelations about his role in a phone tapping scandal led him to resign as Taoiseach and retire from politics in 1992.

After Haughey&#x27;s retirement, further revelations of political corruption, embezzlement, tax evasion and a 27-year extra-marital affair further tarnished his reputation and legacy in the eyes of some. He died of prostate cancer in 2006, aged 80.
==Early life==
He was born in Castlebar, County Mayo in 1925, the third of seven children, of Seán Haughey and Sarah McWilliams, both natives of Swatragh, County Londonderry. Haughey&#x27;s father was in the Irish Republican Army during the Irish War of Independence, then in the National Army of the Irish Free State. Seán Haughey left the army in 1928 and the family moved to County Meath; he subsequently developed multiple sclerosis and the family moved again to Donnycarney, a northern working-class suburb of Dublin, where Charles Haughey spent his youth.

Haughey was educated by the Christian Brothers at St Joseph&#x27;s secondary school in Fairview, where one of his classmates was George Colley, subsequently his cabinet colleague and rival in Fianna Fáil. In his youth he was an active amateur sportsman, playing Gaelic football with the Parnells GAA Club in Donnycarney; he won a Dublin Senior Football Championship medal in 1945. Haughey studied commerce at University College Dublin (UCD), where he took a first-class Honours degree in 1946. It was at UCD that Haughey became increasingly interested in politics and was elected Auditor of the Commerce &amp; Economics Society. He also met there one of his future political rivals, Garret FitzGerald.

He joined the Local Defence Force during &quot;The Emergency&quot; in 1941 and considered a permanent career in the Army. He continued to serve in the reserve FCÁ force, until entering Dáil Éireann in 1957.

On VE-day Haughey and other UCD students burnt the British Union Jack on College Green, outside Trinity College Dublin, in response to a perceived disrespect afforded the Irish tricolour among the flags hung by the college in celebration of the Allied victory which ended World War II.
Haughey qualified as a chartered accountant. He also attended King&#x27;s Inns and was called to the bar of Ireland. Shortly afterwards, he set up the accountancy firm of Haughey, Boland &amp; Company with Harry Boland, son of Fianna Fáil minister Gerald Boland.

On 18 September 1951, he married Maureen Lemass, the daughter of the Fianna Fáil Minister and future Taoiseach Seán Lemass, having been close to her since their days at UCD, where they first met. They had four children together: Eimear, Conor, Ciarán and Seán.

After selling his house in Raheny in 1969, Haughey bought Abbeville and its estate of approximately , located at Kinsealy, north County Dublin. This historic house, once owned by Anglo-Irish politician John Beresford, had been extensively re-designed by the architect James Gandon in the late 18th century and it became the Haughey family home, where he lived for the rest of his life.

==Early political career==
He started his political career as a local councillor, being a member of Dublin Corporation from 1953 to 1955. Haughey&#x27;s first attempt at election to Dáil Éireann came in June 1951, when he unsuccessfully contested the general election. While living in Raheny, Haughey was first elected to the Dáil as a Fianna Fáil TD at the 1957 general election for the Dublin North-East constituency; it was his fourth attempt.

Haughey was re-elected in every election until 1992, representing Dublin North-East from 1957 to 1977, Dublin Artane from 1977 to 1981, and Dublin North-Central from 1981 until his retirement in 1992 (moving constituencies in line with boundary changes).

In 1959, Haughey obtained his first government position, that of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice, serving under his constituency colleague Oscar Traynor, appointed by the first government of his father-in-law Seán Lemass. It is unclear whether the choice was made by Lemass directly as Taoiseach, or by the cabinet against his wishes. Lemass had advised Haughey;
As Taoiseach it is my duty to offer you the post of parliamentary secretary, and as your father-in-law I am advising you not to take it.
Haughey ignored Lemass&#x27;s advice and accepted the offer. Although officially junior to Traynor, Haughey was the minister, as Traynor, a minister in all Fianna Fáil governments since 1936, was elderly and in poor health, and only nominally running the department.

Haughey came to epitomise the new style of politician – the &quot;men in the mohair suits&quot;. He regularly socialised with other younger cabinet colleagues, such as Donogh O&#x27;Malley and Brian Lenihan.
Haughey&#x27;s status by 1961 was such that James Dillon, the leader of the opposition, complimented him on the floor of the Dáil, remarking on his opponent&#x27;s &quot;skill with which he has had recourse to his brief,&quot; as well as his &quot;extraordinary erudition&quot; and &quot;his exceptional and outstanding ability.&quot;

== Ministerial office ==

===Minister for Justice===
When Traynor retired in 1961, Haughey succeeded him as Minister for Justice. As such, he initiated an extensive scale of legislative reforms. He introduced new legislation including the Adoption Act 1964; the Succession Act 1965, which protected the inheritance rights of wives and children; the Criminal Justice Act 1964, which severely restricted the application of capital punishment; and the Extradition Act 1965, which virtually prevented extradition for IRA offences. Haughey also introduced the Special Military Courts which helped to defeat the Irish Republican Army&#x27;s border campaign.

===Minister for Agriculture: 1966 Farmers&#x27; Strike===
In 1964, Lemass appointed Haughey as Minister for Agriculture. Criticism was voiced from the National Farmers Association (NFA) of the appointment of a non-rural person to the position, and there was increased antagonism from farmers towards the government. Haughey became embroiled in a series of controversies with the NFA and with another organisation, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association (ICMSA). Twenty-seven ICMSA picketers outside Leinster House, were arrested on 27 April 1966 under the Offences Against the State Act, an act originally intended for use against the IRA. 78 were arrested the following day, and 80 a day later as the dispute escalated. Haughey, who did not rely on rural voters, was under intense pressure from fearful members of his party to negotiate a deal and reduce the tension. It was Haughey&#x27;s first alienation of a significant voting block, and probably damaged him electorally in later years as many farmers remembered the events, known in folk memory as the Farmers&#x27; Strike.

===1966 presidential election===

Haughey was appointed by Fianna Fáil to run President Éamon de Valera&#x27;s re-election campaign for the 1966 presidential election. Fine Gael chose a comparatively young TD and barrister, Tom O&#x27;Higgins (nephew of Kevin O&#x27;Higgins), to run against de Valera. By then, de Valera was 84 years old and almost blind. Haughey knew this might compare unfavourably to O&#x27;Higgins, whose campaign drew comparisons with the equally youthful US President John F. Kennedy, and launched what was seen as a political stroke. He insisted that it was beneath the presidency to actively campaign, meaning that de Valera would have a low profile. Therefore, in the interests of fairness, the media was asked to give O&#x27;Higgins an equally low profile, ignoring his speeches and publicity campaign. The print media, both nationally and locally, ignored Haughey&#x27;s suggestion. But the state-run RTÉ, facing criticism from Lemass&#x27;s government for being too radical in other areas, agreed and largely ignored the O&#x27;Higgins campaign.

De Valera got a high media profile from a different source, the fiftieth-anniversary commemoration of the Easter Rising, of which he was the most senior survivor. While O&#x27;Higgins&#x27;s campaign was ignored by RTÉ, de Valera appeared in RTÉ coverage of the Rising events regularly. To add further to de Valera&#x27;s campaign, Haughey as Agriculture Minister arranged for milk price increases to be given to farmers on the eve of polling, as a way of reducing farmer disquiet after they had effectively become an opposition movement to the government.

O&#x27;Higgins came within less than one per cent of winning the vote, with de Valera re-elected by a narrow margin of ten thousand votes out of a total of nearly one million. De Valera came to distrust Haughey; Frank Aiken, Minister for External Affairs under de Valera and his lifelong political confidant, dismissed Haughey&#x27;s political motives as being entirely selfish, and believed he was motivated to hold power for its own sake and not duty.

===Minister for Finance===
In November 1966, the Taoiseach Seán Lemass retired. Haughey declared his candidature to succeed Lemass in the consequent leadership election, and George Colley and Neil Blaney did likewise. As this meant that three strong candidates held strong and divisive views on the future of the party, the party elders sought to find a compromise candidate. Lemass himself encouraged his Minister for Finance Jack Lynch, to contest the party leadership, and encouraged Colley, Haughey and Blaney to withdraw in favour of Lynch, arguing that they would not win a contest against him. However, Colley refused the Taoiseach&#x27;s request and insisted on remaining in the race, but he was defeated by Lynch. Upon Lynch&#x27;s election as Taoiseach, Haughey was appointed Minister for Finance by Lynch, in a cabinet reshuffle, which indicated that Haughey&#x27;s withdrawal was a gain at the expense of Colley. The socially inclusive initiatives that Haughey made caught the public imagination; these included popular decisions to introduce free travel on public transport for pensioners, subsidise electricity for pensioners, the grant special tax concessions for the disabled and tax exemptions for artists. They increased Haughey&#x27;s appeal and his support in the media and artistic community.

As Minister for Finance, Haughey on two occasions arranged foreign currency loans for the government which he then arranged to be left on deposit in foreign countries (Germany and the United States), in the local currencies, instead of immediately changing the loans to Irish pounds and depositing them in the exchequer. These actions were unconstitutional because they effectively meant that the Minister for Finance was making currency speculation against his currency. When this was challenged by the Comptroller and Auditor General Eugene Francis Suttle, Haughey introduced a law to retrospectively legalise his actions. The legislation was passed on 26 November 1969.

===Arms crisis===
The late 1960s saw the old tensions boil over into an eruption of violence in Northern Ireland. Haughey was generally seen as coming from the pragmatist wing of the party and was not believed to have strong opinions on the matter, despite having family links with Derry. Indeed, many presumed that he had a strong antipathy to physical force Irish republicanism; during his period as Minister for Justice, he had followed a tough anti-IRA line, including using internment without trial against the IRA. The in the cabinet were seen as Kevin Boland and Neil Blaney, both sons of founding fathers in the party with strong Old IRA pasts. Blaney was also a TD for Donegal North-East; a staunchly Republican area which bordered Derry. They were opposed by those described as the &quot;doves&quot; of the cabinet; Tánaiste Erskine Childers, George Colley and Patrick Hillery. A fund of £100,000 was set up to give to the Nationalist people in the form of aid. Haughey, as Finance Minister would have a central role in the management of this fund.

There was a general surprise when, in a series of events known as the Arms Crisis, Haughey and Blaney were sacked from Lynch&#x27;s cabinet amid allegations of the use of the funds to import arms for use by the IRA. The Garda Special Branch informed the Minister for Justice Mícheál Ó Móráin and Taoiseach Jack Lynch that a plot to import arms existed and included government members, however Lynch took no action until the Special Branch made Leader of the Opposition Liam Cosgrave aware of the plot. Cosgrave told Lynch he knew of the plot and would announce it in the Dáil the next day if he didn&#x27;t act. Lynch subsequently requested Haughey and Blaney to resign from the cabinet. Both men refused, saying they did nothing illegal. Lynch then asked President de Valera to dismiss Haughey and Blaney from the government, a request that de Valera was required to grant by convention. Boland resigned in sympathy, while Mícheál Ó Móráin was asked to resign one day earlier in a preemptive strike to ensure a subservient Minister for Justice was in place when the crisis broke. Lynch chose government chief whip Desmond O&#x27;Malley for the role. Haughey and Blaney were subsequently tried in court along with an army Officer, Captain James Kelly, and Albert Luykx, a former Flemish National Socialist and businessman, who allegedly used his contacts to buy the arms. All the accused were acquitted. Although cleared of wrongdoing, it looked as if Haughey&#x27;s political career was finished. Blaney and Boland eventually resigned from Fianna Fáil but Haughey remained. He spent his years on the backbenches – the wilderness years – building support within the grassroots of the party; during this time, he remained loyal to the party and served the leader, but after the debacle of the &quot;arms crises&quot; neither man trusted the other.

==Leadership years==
=== Opposition to Jack Lynch ===
In 1975, Fianna Fáil was in opposition and Haughey had achieved enough grassroots support to warrant a recall to Jack Lynch&#x27;s opposition front bench. Haughey was appointed Spokesman on Health and Social Welfare, a fairly minor portfolio at the time, but Haughey formulated innovative and far-reaching policies. Two years later in 1977, Fianna Fáil returned to government with a 20-seat majority in Dáil Éireann, having had a very populist campaign (spearheaded by Colley and O&#x27;Malley) to abolish rates, vehicle tax and other extraordinary concessions, which were short-lived. Haughey returned to the cabinet, after an absence of seven years, as Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare.

In this position he continued the progressive policies he had shown earlier by, among others, beginning the first government anti-smoking campaigns and legalising contraception, previously banned. In &quot;McGee v. The Attorney General&quot; (1973), the Supreme Court held that the use of contraception was protected by a right of marital privacy. Haughey was responsible for the introduction of the Health (Family Planning) Act 1979 which allowed a pharmacist to sell contraceptives on presentation of a medical prescription. Haughey called this bill &quot;an Irish solution to an Irish problem&quot;. It is often stated that the recipient of the prescription had to be married, but the legislation did not include this requirement.

The fallout from the giveaway concessions that had re-elected the government under Lynch, led to a succession race to succeed Lynch. As well as this a group of backbenchers began to lobby in support of Haughey. This group, known as the &quot;gang of five&quot;, consisted of Jackie Fahey, Tom McEllistrim, Seán Doherty, Mark Killilea Jnr and Albert Reynolds. Haughey was also helped by the TD Síle de Valera, who was highly critical of Jack Lynch&#x27;s policy regarding Northern Ireland. In a speech at the Liam Lynch commemoration at Fermoy on 9 September, de Valera made a series of thinly veiled attacks on Lynch. Although Lynch quickly tried to impose party discipline, attempting to discipline her for opposing party policy at a parliamentary party meeting held on 28 September, de Valera correctly pointed out that she had not opposed the party policy regarding Northern Ireland which called for the declaration of the British intent to withdraw from Northern Ireland. Lynch left for a trip to the United States on 7 November. On the same day the government lost two by-elections to Fine Gael in Cork City and in Cork North-East. During the trip Lynch claimed in an interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that a five-kilometer air corridor between the border was agreed upon during the meeting with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to enhance security co-operation. When Lynch returned he was questioned on this by a Clare backbencher Bill Loughnane, along with Tom McEllistrim at a parliamentary party meeting. Lynch stated that the British did not have permission to overfly the border. Afterwards, Loughnane went public with the details of the meeting and accused Lynch of deliberately misleading the party. An attempt to remove the whip from Loughnane failed. At this stage, Lynch&#x27;s position had become untenable, with supporters of Haughey and George Colley caucusing opinion within the party.

In December 1979, Lynch announced his resignation as Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil. The leadership contest that resulted was a two-horse race between Haughey and the Tánaiste, George Colley. Colley had the support of the entire cabinet, except for Michael O&#x27;Kennedy, and felt that this popularity would be reflected within the parliamentary party as a whole.

Haughey on the other hand was distrusted by a number of his cabinet colleagues but was much more respected by new backbenchers who were worried about the safety of their Dáil seats. Haughey emerged as the victor by a margin of 44 votes to 38, a very clear division within the party. On 11 December 1979, Charles Haughey was elected Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil, almost a decade after the Arms Crisis set back his political career. In a conciliatory gesture, Colley was re-appointed as Tánaiste and had a veto over whom Haughey would appoint as Ministers for Justice and for Defence. This was due to his distrust of Haughey on security issues (because of the Arms Crisis). However, he was removed from the senior role of Minister for Finance. In 2010, a founder of the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising firm, said that Haughey had asked for &quot;a new image&quot; similar to the one provided for Margaret Thatcher for the 1979 general election.

===Taoiseach (1979–1981)===
Within days of his becoming Taoiseach, Allied Irish Banks forgave Haughey £400,000 of a £1,000,000 debt. &quot;The Economist&quot; obituary on Haughey (24 June 2006) asserted that he had warned the bank &quot;I can be a very troublesome adversary&quot;. When Haughey came to power, the country was sinking into a deep economic crisis, following the 1979 energy crisis. Haughey effectively acted as his own Minister for Finance, ignoring the views of his Minister. One of his first functions as Taoiseach was a televised address to the nation – only the third such address in the Republic&#x27;s history – in which he outlined the bleak economic picture:

While Haughey had identified the problem with the economy, his actions made the problem worse. He increased public spending, which soon became out of control, and led to increases in borrowing and taxation at an unacceptable level. By 1981, Haughey was still reasonably popular and decided to call a general election. However, the timing of the election was thwarted twice by external events, in particular the hunger strikes of IRA volunteers for political status. The Anti H-Block Committee announced that they would field abstentionist candidates which many predicted correctly would take Republican votes away from Fianna Fáil. This coincided with the Stardust fire, where a fire destroyed a nightclub in Haughey&#x27;s constituency and claimed the lives of 48 young people; these caused Haughey to delay the Ard Fheis and the election. The poll was eventually held in June, much later than Haughey had intended. In the hope of winning an overall Dáil majority, Haughey&#x27;s campaign took a populist line about taxation and spending. The campaign was enhanced and hyped up by a live debate on RTÉ between Haughey and the Leader of the Opposition Garret FitzGerald, of Fine Gael, over the major issues. On the day of the vote, Fianna Fáil won 45.5%, failing to secure a majority in the 166-seat Dáil. A Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition came to office under FitzGerald, and Haughey went into opposition.

===Opposition (1981–1982)===
FitzGerald&#x27;s government lasted until January 1982, when it collapsed due to a budget which proposed the application of value-added tax to children&#x27;s shoes, previously exempt. FitzGerald, no longer having a majority in the Dáil, went to Áras an Uachtaráin, to advise President Hillery to dissolve the Dáil and call a general election. However, the night the government collapsed the Fianna Fáil Front Bench issued a statement encouraging the President not to grant the dissolution and to allow Fianna Fáil to form a government. Phone calls were also made to the President by Brian Lenihan. Haughey, on attempting to contact his former colleague, the President, and on failing to be put through to him, was reported to have threatened the president&#x27;s aide de camp by telling him that he would be Taoiseach one day and when that happened, &quot;I intend to roast your fucking arse if you don&#x27;t put me through immediately&quot;. Hillery considered such pressure to be gross misconduct and granted the dissolution.

A biography of Hillery blames Haughey for the sex scandal rumours which almost destroyed the presidency of Hillery in 1979.

===Second term as Taoiseach (1982)===

After the February 1982 election, when Haughey failed to win an overall majority again, questions were raised about his leadership. Some of Haughey&#x27;s critics in the party suggested that an alternative candidate should stand as the party&#x27;s nominee for taoiseach. Desmond O&#x27;Malley emerged as the likely alternative candidate and was ready to challenge Haughey for the leadership. However, on the day of the vote, O&#x27;Malley withdrew and Haughey went forward as the nominee. He engineered confidence and supply agreements with the Independent Socialist TD, Tony Gregory (in return for £100 million of investment in the Dublin North Inner City; a deal dubbed the Gregory Deal), the Independent Fianna Fáil TD Neil Blaney and three Workers&#x27; Party TDs, which saw him return as taoiseach for a second time.

In August 1982, the Attorney General Patrick Connolly was the subject of controversy when a man in his house was arrested for murder. At a press conference on the affair, Haughey was paraphrased as having described the affair as &quot;grotesque, unbelievable, bizarre and unprecedented&quot;, from which journalist and former politician Conor Cruise O&#x27;Brien coined the term GUBU.

The issue of his leadership cropped up again when in October, Charlie McCreevy, a backbench TD, put down a motion of no-confidence in Haughey. Desmond O&#x27;Malley disagreed with the timing but supported the hasty motion of no confidence. O&#x27;Malley resigned from the cabinet before the vote. A campaign was started by Haughey&#x27;s supporters, with threats made to the careers of those who dissented from the leadership. After a marathon 15-hour party meeting, Haughey, who insisted on a roll-call as opposed to a secret ballot, won the open ballot by 58 votes to 22. Not long after this, Haughey&#x27;s government collapsed when the Workers&#x27; Party TD&#x27;s and Tony Gregory withdrew their support for the government over a Fianna Fáil policy document called &quot;The Way Forward&quot;, which would lead to massive spending cuts. Fianna Fáil lost the November 1982 election and FitzGerald once again returned as taoiseach at the head of a Fine Gael–Labour coalition with a Dáil majority. Haughey found himself back in opposition.

===Return to opposition (1982–1987)===
Haughey&#x27;s leadership came under scrutiny for a third time when a report linked Haughey with the phone tapping of political journalists. Despite huge pressure, Haughey refused to resign and survived yet another vote of no-confidence in early 1983, albeit with a smaller majority. Haughey&#x27;s success was partly due to the death of the Fianna Fáil TD Clement Coughlan, a supporter of O&#x27;Malley. Haughey&#x27;s supporters managed to have the meeting moved to the following week after the funeral, which gave him more time to manoeuvre. Having failed three times to oust Haughey, most of his critics gave up and returned to normal politics.

In May 1984, the New Ireland Forum Report was published. Haughey was involved in the drafting of this at the time he was in office and had agreed to potential scenarios for improving the political situation of Northern Ireland. However, on publication, Haughey rejected it and said the only possible solution was a United Ireland. This statement was criticised by the other leaders who forged the New-Ireland Forum, John Hume, Garret FitzGerald and Dick Spring. Desmond O&#x27;Malley supported the Forum report and criticised Haughey&#x27;s ambiguous position, accusing him of stifling debate. At a Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting to discuss the report, the whip was removed from O&#x27;Malley, which meant he was no longer a Fianna Fáil TD. When Haughey returned to office he embraced the Anglo-Irish Agreement that had developed from the New Ireland Forum Report.

In early 1985, a bill was introduced by the Fine Gael–-Labour government to liberalise the sale of contraceptives in the country. Fianna Fáil in opposition opposed the bill. O&#x27;Malley supported it as a matter of principle rather than a political point to oppose for opposition&#x27;s sake. On the day of the vote, O&#x27;Malley spoke in the Dáil chamber and stated:
He abstained rather than vote with the government. Despite this Haughey moved against O&#x27;Malley and in February 1985, O&#x27;Malley was charged with &quot;conduct unbecoming&quot;. At a party meeting, even though O&#x27;Malley did not have the party whip, he was expelled from the Fianna Fáil organisation by 73 votes to 9 in a roll-call vote. With George Colley dead, O&#x27;Malley expelled and other critics silenced, Haughey was finally in full control of Fianna Fáil. On 21 December 1985, Desmond O&#x27;Malley announced the formation of the Progressive Democrats. Several Fianna Fáil TDs joined including Mary Harney and Bobby Molloy.

In November 1985, the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed between Garret FitzGerald and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The agreement gave Ireland a formal say in Northern Ireland and its affairs. As was the case with the New Ireland Forum Report, the Anglo-Irish Agreement was harshly criticised by Haughey, who said that he would re-negotiate it, if re-elected. 

===Final term as Taoiseach (1987–1992)===

Following the withdrawal of Labour from government, FitzGerald called a general election for February 1987. The campaign was dominated by attacks on the government over severe cuts in the budget and the general mismanagement of the economy. Haughey had failed once again to win an overall majority for Fianna Fáil. When it came to electing a Taoiseach in the Dáil Haughey&#x27;s position was volatile. Independent TD Tony Gregory voted against Fitzgerald but abstained on Haughey, seeing Haughey as the &quot;lesser of two evils&quot; (the reason for this was Gregory&#x27;s opposition to the Anglo-Irish agreement as well as his dislike of Garret FitzGerald and Fine Gael). Haughey was elected Taoiseach on the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle.

Haughey now headed a minority Fianna Fáil government. Fine Gael under leader Alan Dukes, made the unprecedented move, with its Tallaght Strategy, of supporting the government and voting for it when it came to introducing tough economic policies. The national debt had doubled under previous administrations, so the government introduced severe budget cuts in all departments. The taxation system was transformed to encourage enterprise and employment. One of the major schemes put forward, and one which would have enormous economic benefits for the country, was the establishment of the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in Dublin.

In late April 1989, Haughey returned from a trip to Japan, to the news that the government was about to be defeated in a Dáil vote, on a private members&#x27; motion regarding the provision of funds for HIV/AIDS sufferers. The government lost the vote, which was seen as merely embarrassing, but Haughey, buoyed by opinion polls which indicated the possibility of winning an overall majority, called a general election for 15 June. Fianna Fáil however ended up losing four seats and the possibility of forming another minority government looked slim. For the first time in history, a nominee for Taoiseach failed to achieve a majority when a vote was taken in the Dáil, on 29 June 1989. Constitutionally Haughey was obliged to resign, however he refused to, for a short period. He eventually tendered his resignation to President Hillery and remained as taoiseach, albeit in an acting capacity. A full 27 days after the election had taken place a coalition government was formed between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. It was the first time that Fianna Fáil had entered into a coalition, abandoning one of its &quot;core values&quot; in the overwhelming need to form a government.
Haughey in 1990 had more difficulties than successes. The first half of the year saw Haughey in a leading role as a European statesman when Ireland held the presidency of the European Community, which rotated semi-annually between the member states of the European Economic Community. Haughey supported German reunification and during the extraordinary Dublin Summit, which he called for in April, he pressed this viewpoint forward. He believed both Ireland and Germany were similar in that both countries were divided. During a Dáil debate on German reunification, Haughey stated &quot;I have expressed a personal view that coming as we do from a country which is also divided many of us would have sympathy with any wish of the people of the two German States for unification&quot;.

The presidential election was disappointing for Haughey with Brian Lenihan, the Tánaiste, who was nominated as the party&#x27;s candidate, being defeated by Mary Robinson. During the campaign the controversy over the phone calls made to the Áras an Uachtaráin in 1982, urging the then President not to dissolve the Dáil resurfaced. Lenihan was accused of calling and attempting to influence the president, who as head of state is above politics. The Progressive Democrats threatened to pull out of the coalition and support a Fine Gael no-confidence motion unless Haughey forced Lenihan out. Haughey tried to force Lenihan to resign and sacked him when he refused to do so. Lenihan&#x27;s dismissal damaged Haughey&#x27;s standing in the Fianna Fáil organisation.

Haughey&#x27;s grip on political power began to slip in the autumn of 1991. There was a series of resignations by chairmen of semi-state companies, followed by an open declaration by Minister for Finance Albert Reynolds, that he had every intention of standing for the party leadership if Haughey resigned. Following a heated parliamentary party meeting, Seán Power, one of Reynolds&#x27;s supporters, put down a motion of no-confidence in Haughey. Reynolds and his supporters were sacked from the government by Haughey, who went on to win the no-confidence motion by 55 votes to 22.
Haughey&#x27;s victory was short-lived, as a series of political errors would lead to his demise as Taoiseach. Controversy erupted over the attempted appointment of Jim McDaid as Minister for Defence, which saw him withdraw his nomination under pressure from O&#x27;Malley. Worse was to follow when Seán Doherty, who as Minister for Justice had taken the blame for the phone-tapping scandal of the early 1980s, went on RTÉ television, and after ten years of insisting that Haughey knew nothing of the tapping, claimed that Haughey had known and authorised it. Haughey denied this, but the Progressive Democrats members of the government stated that they could no longer continue in government with Haughey as Taoiseach. Haughey told Desmond O&#x27;Malley, the Progressive Democrats leader, that he intended to stand down shortly, but wanted to choose his own time of departure. O&#x27;Malley agreed to this and the government continued.

On 30 January 1992, Haughey resigned as leader of Fianna Fáil at a parliamentary party meeting. He remained as Taoiseach until 11 February 1992, when he was succeeded by the former Finance Minister, Albert Reynolds. During his final address to the Dáil, he quoted Othello, saying &quot;I have done the state some service, they know it, no more of that&quot;. Haughey then returned to the backbenches before retiring from politics at the 1992 general election. His son, Seán Haughey, was elected at the election that followed, in his father&#x27;s old constituency. Seán Haughey was appointed as a Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science in December 2006.

==Retirement, tribunals and scandal==
===Financial scandals===
Haughey&#x27;s personal wealth and extravagant lifestyle (he owned racehorses, a large motor sailing yacht &quot;Celtic Mist&quot;, Inishvickillane island and a Gandon-designed mansion) had long been a point of speculation. He refused throughout his career to answer any questions about how he financed this lifestyle on a government salary. Despite his professed desire to fade from public attention, these questions followed him into retirement, eventually exploding into a series of political, financial and personal scandals that tarnished his image and reputation.

In 1997, the McCracken Tribunal, a government-appointed tribunal led by Judge Brian McCracken, first revealed that Haughey had received substantial monetary gifts from businessmen and that he had held secret offshore bank accounts in the Ansbacher Bank in the Cayman Islands. Haughey faced criminal charges for obstructing the work of the McCracken tribunal. His trial on these charges was postponed indefinitely after the judge in the case found that he would not be able to get a fair trial following prejudicial comments by the Progressive Democrats leader and Tánaiste, Mary Harney.

Also in 1997, the public learned of allegations that Haughey had embezzled money destined for the Fianna Fáil party, taxpayers&#x27; money taken from government funds earmarked for the operation of a political party, and that he had spent large portions of these funds on Charvet shirts and expensive dinners in a top Dublin restaurant while preaching belt-tightening and implementing budget cuts as a national policy.

Moriarty Tribunal, established later in 1997, delved further into Haughey&#x27;s financial dealings. In his main report on Charles Haughey released on 19 December 2006, Judge Moriarty made the following findings:

*Haughey was paid more than IR£8 million between 1979 and 1986 from various benefactors and businessmen, including £1.3 million from the Dunnes Stores supermarket tycoon Ben Dunne. The tribunal described these payments as &quot;unethical&quot;.
*In May 1989 one of Haughey&#x27;s lifelong friends, former government minister Brian Lenihan, underwent a liver transplant which was partly paid for through fundraising by Haughey. The Moriarty tribunal found that of the £270,000 collected in donations for Brian Lenihan, no more than £70,000 ended up being spent on Lenihan&#x27;s medical care. The tribunal identified one specific donation of £20,000 for Lenihan that was surreptitiously appropriated by Haughey, who took steps to conceal this transaction.
*The tribunal found evidence of favours performed in return for money (bribes): Saudi businessman Mahmoud Fustok paid Haughey £50,000 to support applications for Irish citizenship.
* In other evidence of favours performed, the tribunal reported that Haughey arranged meetings between Ben Dunne and civil servant Seamus Pairceir of the Revenue Commissioners. These discussions resulted in an outstanding capital gains tax bill for Dunne being reduced by £22.8 million. Moriarty found that this was &quot;not coincidental&quot;, and that it was a substantial benefit conferred on Dunne by Haughey&#x27;s actions.
*Allied Irish Banks settled a million-pound overdraft with Haughey soon after he became Taoiseach in 1979; the tribunal found that the lenience shown by the bank in this case amounted to an indirect payment by the bank to Haughey.

The tribunal rejected Haughey&#x27;s claims of ignorance of his financial affairs and Haughey was accused by the tribunal of &quot;devaluing democracy&quot;.

Haughey eventually agreed to a settlement with the revenue and paid a total of €6.5 million in back taxes and penalties to the Revenue Commissioners about these donations. In August 2003 Haughey was forced to sell his large estate, Abbeville, in Kinsealy in north County Dublin for €45 million to settle legal fees he had incurred during the tribunals. He continued to live at Abbeville and own the island of Inishvickillane off the coast of County Kerry until his death.

===Terry Keane affair===
In May 1999, Terry Keane, gossip columnist and once wife of former Chief Justice of Ireland Ronan Keane, revealed on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; that she and Haughey had conducted a 27-year extramarital affair. In a move that she subsequently said she deeply regretted, Keane confirmed that the man she had been referring to for years in her newspaper column as &quot;sweetie&quot; was indeed Haughey. The revelation on the television programme shocked at least some of the audience, including Haughey&#x27;s son Seán who was watching the show. Haughey&#x27;s wife Maureen was also said to have been deeply hurt by the circumstances of the revelation.

==Death and funeral==
Haughey&#x27;s attendance before the tribunals had repeatedly been disrupted by illness. He died from prostate cancer, from which he had suffered for a decade, on 13 June 2006, at his home in Kinsealy, County Dublin, aged 80.

Haughey received a state funeral on 16 June 2006. He was buried in St. Fintan&#x27;s Cemetery, Sutton in County Dublin, following mass at Donnycarney. The funeral rites were screened live on RTÉ One and watched by a quarter of a million people. It was attended by President Mary McAleese, members of the Oireachtas, many from the world of politics, industry and business. Taoiseach Bertie Ahern delivered the graveside oration. The chief celebrant was Haughey&#x27;s brother, Father Eoghan Haughey.

==Legacy==
Former Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald said that Haughey had the potential to be one of the best Taoisigh that the country ever had, had his preoccupation with wealth and power not clouded his judgement: 
Several social measures were carried out during Haughey&#x27;s various terms as Taoiseach, including a National Fuel Scheme, a Lone Parent&#x27;s Allowance, a Carer&#x27;s allowance, a Back to School Clothing Scheme, and a Program for Economic and Social Progress (area-based partnerships in 12 pilot areas).

Taoiseach Bertie Ahern said,
Historian Diarmaid Ferriter said, 

Historian John A. Murphy said, 

==Cultural depiction==
Haughey was characterised in a 2012 novel &quot;Ratlines&quot;, by Stuart Neville. A three-part television drama &quot;Charlie&quot;, covering Haughey between 1979 and 1992, débuted on RTÉ in January 2015, with Aidan Gillen in the title role.

==Governments==
The following governments were led by Haughey:
*16th government of Ireland (December 1979 – June 1981)
*18th government of Ireland (March 1982 – December 1982)
*20th government of Ireland (March 1987 – July 1989)
*21st government of Ireland (July 1989 – February 1992)

<text>Seán Francis Lemass (born John Francis Lemass; 15 July 1899 – 11 May 1971) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Taoiseach and Leader of Fianna Fáil from 1959 to 1966. He also served as Tánaiste from 1957 to 1959, 1951 to 1954 and 1945 to 1948, Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1957 to 1959, 1951 to 1954, 1945 to 1949 and 1932 to 1939 and Minister for Supplies from 1939 to 1945. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1924 to 1969.

A veteran of the 1916 Easter Rising, the War of Independence and the Civil War, Lemass was first elected as a Sinn Féin TD for the Dublin South constituency in a by-election on 18 November 1924. Lemass was returned at each election until the constituency was abolished in 1948 when he was re-elected for Dublin South-Central until his retirement in 1969. He was a founder-member of Fianna Fáil in 1926 and served as Minister for Industry and Commerce, Minister for Supplies and Tánaiste in successive Fianna Fáil governments.

Lemass&#x27;s legacy is tied to his efforts in facilitating industrial growth, bringing foreign direct investment into the country, and forging permanent links between Ireland and the European community. One of the most important modernizing reforms during Lemass&#x27;s tenure was the introduction of free secondary education, an initiative that took effect shortly after Lemass retired as Taoiseach.

==Early life and education==
Lemass was born at Norwood Lodge, Ballybrack, Dublin on 15 July 1899, the second of seven children born to John T. Lemass and his wife Frances ( Phelan) Lemass. He was baptised at Ss. Alphonsus and Columba Roman Catholic Church, Killiney, six days later, on 21 July 1899. The family operated a hatter and outfitter business and lived at the premises in Capel Street (in Dublin city centre) where Lemass grew up. He was of distant French Huguenot descent. Within the family his name soon changed to Jack and eventually, after 1916, he himself preferred to be called Seán. He was educated at O&#x27;Connell School, where he was described as studious. He won a first-class honours exhibition in mathematics in 1915.

One of Lemass&#x27;s classmates was the popular Irish comedian Jimmy O&#x27;Dea. Another friend during his youth was Tom Farquharson, who went on to play as a goalkeeper for Cardiff City. In January 1915, Lemass was persuaded to join the Irish Volunteers. His mature looks ensured he would be accepted although he was only fifteen and a half at the time. Lemass became a member of the A Company of the 3rd Battalion of the Dublin Brigade. The battalion adjutant was Éamon de Valera, future Taoiseach and President of Ireland. While out on a journey in the Dublin mountains during Easter 1916, Lemass and his brother Noel met two sons of Professor Eoin MacNeill. They informed the Lemasses of the Easter Rising that was taking place in the city. On Tuesday 25 April, Seán and Noel Lemass were allowed to join the Volunteer garrison at the General Post Office. Lemass was equipped with a shotgun and was positioned on the roof. He also was involved in fighting on Moore Street. However, by Friday the Rising had ended in failure and all involved were imprisoned. Lemass was held for a month in Richmond Barracks, due to his age he was released from the 1,783 that were arrested. Following this, Lemass&#x27;s father wanted his son to continue with his studies and be called to the Irish Bar.

===Deaths of the Lemass brothers===
Three of Lemass&#x27;s brothers died while young. When he was 16, Lemass killed his own baby brother, Herbert, aged twenty-two months, in a domestic shooting accident with a revolver on 28 January 1916. His older brother, Noel, an anti-Treaty officer, was abducted in June 1923 and murdered the following October, when he was 25; the Lemass family believed he was killed by pro-treaty soldier, Emmet Dalton. Another of Lemass&#x27;s brothers, Patrick, died of natural causes at the age of 19 in 1926.

===Alongside &quot;The Twelve Apostles&quot;===
Following the Easter Rising, Lemass remained active in the Irish Volunteers, carrying out raids for arms. Until November 1920, Lemass remained a part-time member of the Volunteers. In that month, during the height of the Irish War of Independence, twelve members of the Dublin Brigade of the IRA took part in an attack on British agents living in Dublin, whose names and addresses had been leaked to Michael Collins by his network of spies. The names of those who carried out Collins&#x27; orders on the morning of 21 November 1920 were not disclosed until author Tim Pat Coogan mentioned them in his book on the history of the IRA, published in 1970. Coogan identified Lemass as taking part in the killing of a British agent as a member of the &quot;Apostles&quot; assassin squad which killed thirteen (and wounded five other) British agents of the Cairo Gang. That day, 21 November 1920, became known as Bloody Sunday.

Lemass was arrested in December 1920 and interned at Ballykinlar Camp, County Down.

===Anti-treaty===
In December 1921, after the signing of Anglo-Irish Treaty, Lemass was released. He became a training officer for a period in Beggars Bush Barracks before the IRA split and was involved in the Belfast Boycott operations (see The Troubles in Ulster (1920–1922)). During the debates of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921, Lemass was one of the minority who opposed it along with de Valera. As a protest, all the anti-Treaty side withdrew from the Dáil. In the Irish Civil War which followed Lemass was adjutant to Rory O&#x27;Connor, when the group seized the Four Courts, the home of the High Court of Ireland. The occupation of the Four Courts eventually resulted in the outbreak of the Civil War, when, under British pressure, the Free State side shelled the building on 28 June 1922. As a result, fighting broke out in Dublin between pro and anti-Treaty factions. The Four Courts surrendered after two days of bombardment, however, Lemass escaped with Ernie O&#x27;Malley and some others to Blessington. Their Flying Column operated in Enniscorthy, Tullow, Ferns, Baltinglass and Borris before the Column was broken up. Lemass and O&#x27;Malley returned to Dublin along with Thomas Derrig as a member of the IRA Eastern Command Headquarters but were later captured in December 1922 and interned in the Curragh Camp.

In June 1923, after the end of the civil war, Seán Lemass&#x27;s brother Noel Lemass, an anti-Treaty IRA officer, was abducted in Dublin by a number of men, believed to be connected to the National Army or the Police CID unit. He was held in secret until October when his mutilated body was found in the Dublin Mountains, (see also Executions during the Irish Civil War). Seán Lemass was released from prison on compassionate grounds following his brother&#x27;s death. On 18 November 1924, Lemass was elected for the first time as a Sinn Féin TD.

== Political foundations and ministerial career ==

In 1926, de Valera, supported by Lemass, sought to convince Sinn Féin to accept the existence of the Irish Free State and the legitimacy of the Dáil, and to abandon its abstentionist intention to refuse to sit in the Dáil if elected. Their effort was unsuccessful, however, and in March 1926 both de Valera and Lemass resigned from the party.

At this point, de Valera contemplated leaving public life, a decision that would have changed the course of Irish history. It was Lemass who encouraged him to stay and form a political party. In May, de Valera, assisted by Gerald Boland and Lemass, began to plan the new party, which became known as Fianna Fáil – The Republican Party. Lemass travelled around the country trying to raise support for Fianna Fáil. The vast majority of Sinn Féin TDs were persuaded to join. The new party was strongly opposed to partition but accepted the &quot;de facto&quot; existence of the Free State, seeking to republicanise it from within. It opposed the controversial Oath of Allegiance and campaigned for its removal.

Due largely to Lemass&#x27; organisational skill, most of Sinn Féin&#x27;s branches defected to Fianna Fáil. This enabled the new party to make a strong showing at the June 1927 election, taking 44 seats while reducing its parent party to only five. More importantly, this was only three seats behind the governing party, Cumann na nGaedheal. Pending the removal of the Oath of Allegiance, the party announced that it would not take up its Dáil seats. A court case was begun in the name of Lemass and others. However, the assassination by the IRA of Kevin O&#x27;Higgins, the Vice-President of the Executive Council (deputy prime minister), led to the passing of a new Act requiring all prospective Dáil candidates to take an oath that, if elected, they would swear the Oath of Allegiance; a refusal to do so would prohibit anyone from candidacy in a general or by-election.

Faced with the threat of legal disqualification from politics, de Valera eventually took the Oath of Allegiance while claiming that he was simply signing a slip of paper to gain a right of participation in the Dáil, not &quot;actually&quot; taking an Oath. On 11 August 1927, having signed the Oath of Allegiance in front of a representative of the Governor-General of the Irish Free State, the TDs from what Lemass described as &quot;a slightly constitutional party&quot; entered the Dáil. The party had another strong showing at a fresh election in September, taking 57 seats.

Lemass was one of the party&#x27;s stronger performers in opposition, attacking Cumann na nGaedheal as being too pro-British. He also attacked the government&#x27;s stewardship of the economy, and was largely responsible for drafting Fianna Fáil&#x27;s economic programme.

===Minister for Industry and Commerce===

In 1932, Fianna Fáil took office in the Irish Free State, remaining in government for 16 uninterrupted years. The party which Lemass had described as only a &quot;slightly constitutional party&quot; in 1929 was now leading the Free State, a state that de Valera and Lemass had fought a civil war to destroy a decade earlier. De Valera appointed Lemass as Minister for Industry and Commerce, one of the more senior cabinet positions in the Executive Council, which he would occupy, with only one short break, in all three of de Valera&#x27;s governments.

Lemass had the two difficult tasks of developing Irish industry behind his new tariff walls, and convincing the conservative Department of Finance to promote state involvement in industry. Against the background of the Great Depression, he and de Valera engaged in the Anglo-Irish Trade War which lasted from 1933 until 1938, causing severe damage and hardship to the Irish economy and the cattle industry. In 1933, Lemass set up the Industrial Credit Corporation to facilitate investment for industrial development; in the climate of the depression, investment had dried up. A number of semi-state companies, modelled on the success of the ESB, were also set up. These included the Irish Sugar Company, to develop the sugar-beet industry, Turf Development Board for turf development, and an Irish airline, Aer Lingus. Years later Lemass described Aer Lingus as his &quot;proudest achievement&quot;.

The Irish market was still too small for multiple companies to exist, so practically all the semi-states had a monopoly on the Irish market. While Lemass concentrated on economic matters, de Valera focused primarily on constitutional affairs, leading to the passage of the new Constitution of Ireland in 1937. De Valera became Taoiseach, while Lemass served in the new Government (the new name for the cabinet) again as Minister for Industry and Commerce.

Subsequently, Irish economic historians have found that many of his decisions on tariffs and licences were made on an ad-hoc basis, with little coherent policy and forward planning.

===Minister for Supplies===
Lemass became Minister for Supplies in 1939, following the outbreak of World War II (known in Ireland as The Emergency). It was a crucial role for Ireland, which maintained official neutrality.

The state had to achieve an unprecedented degree of self-sufficiency and it was Lemass&#x27;s role to ensure this; he had the difficult task of organising what little resources existed. In 1941, the Irish Shipping Company was set up to keep a vital trickle of supplies coming into the country. However, petrol, gas, and some foodstuffs remained in short supply. When Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly was elected president of Ireland in 1945, de Valera chose Lemass over older cabinet colleagues to succeed him as Tánaiste.

===Post-war years===

After World War II Lemass sought help from the Marshall Aid Plan, securing $100m that was mainly spent on the road network. Emigration continued, particularly to Britain. Despite a high birth rate, the Republic&#x27;s population continued to fall until the 1960s (see chart).

In 1948, partly due to its own increasing isolation and also due to a republican backlash against its anti-IRA policies (which during the Emergency had seen the execution of IRA prisoners – in part due to IRA links with the Nazis), which had produced a rival republican party, Clann na Poblachta, Fianna Fáil lost office.

The First Inter-Party government, made up of Fine Gael, the Labour Party, National Labour Party, Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta and Independents, was formed under Fine Gael TD John A. Costello. In opposition, Lemass played a crucial role in re-organising and streamlining Fianna Fáil. As a result of this, and also due to crises within the Inter-Party government over the controversial Mother and Child Scheme, Fianna Fáil were not long out of government.

In 1951, Fianna Fáil returned to office as a minority government. Lemass again returned as Minister for Industry and Commerce. Lemass believed that a new economic policy was needed, however, de Valera disagreed. Seán MacEntee, the Minister for Finance, tried to deal with the crisis in the balance of payments. He was also unsympathetic to a new economic outlook. In 1954, the government fell and was replaced by the Second Inter-Party government.

Lemass was confined to the Opposition benches for another three years. In 1957, de Valera, at the age of seventy-five, announced to Fianna Fáil that he planned to retire. He was persuaded however to become Taoiseach one more time until 1959 when the office of President of Ireland would become vacant. Lemass returned as Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce. In 1958, the first &quot;Programme for Economic Development&quot; was launched. De Valera was elected president in 1959 and retired as Fianna Fáil leader and Taoiseach.

==Taoiseach (1959–1966)==
On 23 June 1959, Seán Lemass was appointed Taoiseach, on the nomination of Dáil Éireann. Many had wondered if Fianna Fáil could survive without de Valera as leader. However, Lemass quickly established his control over the party. Although he was one of the founding members of Fianna Fáil he was still only fifty-nine years old, seventeen years younger than De Valera. 

The change of personnel in Fianna Fáil was also accompanied by a change of personnel in Fine Gael, with James Dillon becoming leader upon Richard Mulcahy&#x27;s retirement in 1959, and Labour, in which Brendan Corish succeeded William Norton in 1960. A generation of leaders who had dominated Irish politics for over three decades had moved off the stage of history – although neither Fine Gael nor Labour&#x27;s new leaders initiated major policy changes on the level of Lemass&#x27;s.

Lemass also initiated several changes in the cabinet. He is credited with providing a transition phase between the old guard and a new generation of professional politicians. Younger men such as Brian Lenihan, Charles Haughey, Patrick Hillery and Donogh O&#x27;Malley were all given their first cabinet portfolios by Lemass, and ministers who joined under de Valera, such as Jack Lynch, Neil Blaney and Kevin Boland were promoted by the new Taoiseach. Similarly, several members of the old guard retired from politics during the Lemass era. By 1965, Frank Aiken was the only de Valera veteran remaining in government, and would become the only founder-member of Fianna Fáil to survive Lemass as a member of the government and the Dáil.

The term &quot;Lemass era&quot; is used by author and academic Brian Girvin to describe the period of economic change between 1959 and 1966. It is so termed because Lemass came from a business background, unlike the more academic and religious de Valera, and this was seen as a factor in the economic turnaround at the time. However, factors other than the leadership of Lemass had a role to play in the change in Ireland at the time – a generation of young politicians born after the Civil War, the presence of T. K. Whitaker in the Department of Finance and the arrival of television all had a role.

During the Lemass era, the IDA greatly refocused its efforts on attracting quality industry, RTÉ was created, whilst population decline and emigration halted somewhat, and the Programme for Economic Expansion was implemented.

The period also saw the destruction of much of Georgian Dublin to make way for modern buildings, and the resettlement of inner-city Dublin communities in new developments such as Ballymun and Tallaght.

===Economic programmes===
Lemass summed up his economic philosophy by copying an often-quoted phrase: &quot;A rising tide lifts all boats&quot;. By this, he meant that an upsurge in the Irish economy would benefit both the richest and the poorest.

====First Programme for Economic Expansion====

Although the White Paper entitled &quot;Economic Development&quot; was first introduced in 1958 in de Valera&#x27;s last government, its main recommendations formed the basis for the First Programme for Economic Expansion, which was adopted by Lemass as government policy upon his ascension in 1959.

The programme, which was the brainchild of T. K. Whitaker, involved a move away from the protectionist policies that had been in place since the 1930s. Tax breaks and grants were also to be provided to foreign firms wishing to set up a company in Ireland. The programme also allowed for the spending of P£220 million of state capital in investing in an integrated system of national development.

Following the introduction of this programme the policy of protection was eventually ended and the Control of Manufacturers Act, which had been in place since 1932 and had been introduced by Lemass himself, was also abolished. The implementation of the programme coincided with favourable trading conditions, which contributed to the initiative&#x27;s popularity. However, the government&#x27;s introduction of a 2.5% turnover tax in 1963, badly damaged the political position, with a by-election of that year reducing the government&#x27;s majority to one seat. But by the beginning of 1964, another round of by-elections saw a rebound in the government&#x27;s popularity: in the preceding five years, unemployment had fallen by a third; emigration had reduced considerably and the population grew for the first time since the famine. Agriculture was the only sector which failed to respond to the programme.

Professor Tom Garvin has found that the protectionist policies were first suggested to de Valera by Lemass in a paper written in 1929–30, and then adopted following the change of government in 1932. He considers the proposition that Lemass moved the economy away from free trade in the 1930s, and back into it in the 1960s; a costly mistake that affected many thousands of (non-voting) emigrants.

The programme paved the way for free trade. In 1960, Ireland signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a worldwide agreement to reduce tariffs. In 1961, Ireland applied unsuccessfully for membership in the European Economic Community. Ireland&#x27;s failure to join was said to be Lemass&#x27;s biggest regret and disappointment as Taoiseach. Ireland eventually joined in 1973, two years after Lemass&#x27;s death. The 1965 Merger Treaties paved the way for the signing of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement between Lemass&#x27;s government and Harold Wilson&#x27;s Labour government.

====Second Programme for Economic Expansion====
A Second Programme was launched in 1963, with even more ambitious targets. In particular, the policy focused on expenditures for education, with a doubling of expenditures planned, and high production goals for the dairy industry. Agriculture, which had disappointing results in the First Programme, was understated in the second – a clear break in the Lemass policies from de Valera&#x27;s longstanding courting of rural voters.

The Second Programme was discontinued in 1967 after Lemass had left office and the programme&#x27;s goals proved far from completion.

===Social change===
As a result of the economic expansion, there was an increase in industrialisation and urbanisation. An increase in prosperity also led to a move away from insularity and conservatism in Irish life. This was facilitated in no small part by the establishment of the state television service, Raidió Teilifís Éireann on 31 December 1961. Television programmes, such as &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; and imported American and British ones, had a profound effect on a change in attitude. Subjects such as contraception, the Catholic Church and divorce were being discussed openly in a way that previous generations would never have imagined. The pontificate of Pope John XXIII and the Second Vatican Council also had a profound effect on the changing attitudes of Irish Catholics.

In 1963, Ireland saw the first visit of a sitting US President to Ireland, President John F. Kennedy, the great-grandson of an Irish emigrant, came on an official visit. His visit seemed to symbolise a new age for the post-Famine Irish. During his visit Kennedy visited distant relatives in County Wexford, as well as visiting Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick. Kennedy later said that his four-day visit to Ireland was one of his most enjoyable. Kennedy later personally invited Lemass back to Washington in October of the same year. One month later the young President Kennedy would be assassinated.

In 1965, a report titled &quot;Investment in Education&quot; was published. After over forty years of independence, the report painted a depressing picture of a system where no changes had taken place. Lemass appointed several young and intelligent men to the post of Minister for Education, including Patrick Hillery and George Colley. Under these people, a slow process of change eventually began to take place.

The most innovative change in education came in 1966 when Donogh O&#x27;Malley was appointed Minister. Shortly after taking over O&#x27;Malley announced that from 1969 all schools up to Intermediate level would be free and free buses would provide transport for the students. This plan had the backing of Lemass; O&#x27;Malley, however, never discussed this hugely innovative and expensive plan with any other cabinet ministers, least of all the Minister for Finance Jack Lynch. However, the plan was not expensive in the long term and has continued ever since. O&#x27;Malley had died by the time his brainchild came to maturity.

Various improvements in welfare provision were also carried out during the Lemass era. In 1960, old-age pension insurance was introduced for all manual workers and for salaried employees under a certain earnings ceiling, and in 1963, child allowances were extended to the first child. A National Manpower Agency was also established.

===Northern Ireland===
The failure of the IRA border campaign in the 1950s and the accession of Lemass as Taoiseach heralded a new policy towards Northern Ireland. Although he was of the staunch republican tradition that rejected partition, he saw clearly that it was unlikely to end in the foreseeable future and that consequently the Republic was better served by disposing of the matter. The new Taoiseach played down the nationalist and anti-partition rhetoric that had done little to further the situation over the previous forty years. Still, as long as the hardline Basil Brooke was Prime Minister of Northern Ireland there was little hope of a &quot;rapprochement&quot;.

However, in 1963, Terence O&#x27;Neill, a younger man with a more pragmatic outlook, succeeded Brooke as Prime Minister. He had years before told Tony Grey of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; that if he ever succeeded Brooke, he hoped to meet with Lemass. A friendship had developed between O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s secretary, Jim Malley, and the Irish civil servant, T. K. Whitaker. A series of behind-the-scenes negotiations resulted in O&#x27;Neill issuing an invitation to Lemass to visit him at Stormont in Belfast.

On 14 January 1965, Lemass travelled to Belfast in the utmost secrecy. The media and even his own cabinet had not been informed until the very last minute. The meeting got a mixed reaction in the North. In the Republic, however, it was seen as a clear indication that the &quot;Irish Cold War&quot; had ended, or at least that a thaw had set in. Lemass returned the invitation on 9 February of the same year by inviting O&#x27;Neill to Dublin, but he did not want to be seen to be anti-British. The Irish government encouraged overseas developments with the United States, so that they could share in the 50th-anniversary celebrations of the Easter Rising. The two leaders discussed cooperation between the two states on general economic matters; local services such as road systems and sewage facilities; agriculture, including exempting Northern Ireland from Britain&#x27;s quota on butter imports from the Republic; customs; and all-Ireland representation in international sporting events. While in 1966 people began to take notice of Ian Paisley&#x27;s more hard-line speeches, O&#x27;Neill was by Ulster standards a &quot;liberal&quot; (Roy Hattersley MP), and Harold Wilson&#x27;s government decided that there had to be radical change as a consequence of the diplomatic with Lemass. The 50th Anniversary of the Easter Rising was celebrated by Insurrection, a TV mini-series commissioned by RTÉ that was later broadcast on the BBC.

The meetings heralded a new (but short-lived) era of optimism, although, for the most part, it was manifested in the Republic. Hardline Northern unionists led by Ian Paisley continued to oppose any dealings with the Republic, and even moderate unionists felt the 50th-anniversary celebrations of Easter Rising in 1966 were insulting to them. The rise of the civil rights campaign and the unionists&#x27; refusal to acknowledge it ended the optimism with violence in 1969, after Lemass&#x27;s term in office had finished.

===Foreign policy===

The Lemass era saw some significant developments in Irish foreign policy. Frank Aiken served as Minister for External Affairs during the whole of Lemass&#x27;s tenure as Taoiseach. At the United Nations, Aiken took an independent stance and backed the admission of China to the organisation, in spite of huge protests from the United States. Admitted only in 1955, Ireland played a large role at the UN, serving on the Security Council in 1962, condemning Chinese aggression in Tibet and advocating nuclear arms limitation. One of the main areas of foreign policy which emerged during the Lemass years was a debate over Ireland&#x27;s neutrality, a debate that has never been formally resolved, with the de facto policy being to avoid joining military engagements or alliances without neutrality as it&#x27;s traditionally understood.

Lemass was always sceptical about remaining neutral, particularly if Ireland were to join the European Economic Community. Aiken was much more in favour of a neutral, independent stance. In 1960, Irish troops embarked on their first peace-keeping mission in the First Republic of the Congo. Nine soldiers were killed during this mission.

While Aiken was at the UN, Lemass played a major role in pressing for Ireland&#x27;s membership of the EEC which in many ways became the chief foreign policy consideration during the 1960s.

==Personal life==
On 24 August 1924, Lemass married Kathleen Hughes, much to the disapproval of the bride&#x27;s parents. The wedding took place in the Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Name, Ranelagh, Dublin. Jimmy O&#x27;Dea, the well-known comedian, acted as Lemass&#x27;s best man.

Together Seán and Kathleen had four children – Maureen, Peggy (1927–2004), Noel and Sheila (1932–1997). Maureen Lemass would marry Charles Haughey, a successor of Lemass as Fianna Fáil leader and Taoiseach.

===Retirement===
In 1966, Ireland celebrated the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising. Éamon de Valera came within 1% of defeat in that year&#x27;s Irish presidential election, less than two months after the celebrations in which he played such a central part. On 10 November 1966, Lemass announced to the Dáil his decision to retire as Fianna Fáil leader and Taoiseach with his usual penchant for efficiency, &quot;I have resigned&quot;. Lemass retired to the backbenches and remained a TD until 1969.

On the day of Lemass&#x27;s retirement, Jack Lynch became the new leader and became the Taoiseach.

===Death===
During the last few years of his leadership, Lemass&#x27;s health began to deteriorate. He had been a heavy pipe smoker all his life, smoking almost a pound of tobacco a week in later life. At the time of his retirement, it was suspected that Lemass had cancer, but this assumption was later disproved. In February 1971, while attending a rugby game at Lansdowne Road, he became unwell; he was rushed to hospital and was told by his doctor that one of his lungs was about to collapse.

On Tuesday, 11 May 1971, Seán Lemass died in the Mater Hospital in Dublin, aged 71. He was afforded a state funeral and was buried in Deansgrange Cemetery.

==Legacy==

Lemass remains one of the most highly regarded holders of the office of Taoiseach, being described even by later Fine Gael Taoisigh Garret FitzGerald and John Bruton as the best holder of the office, and the man whose cabinet leadership style they wished to follow. Some historians have questioned whether Lemass came to the premiership too late, arguing that had he replaced de Valera as Fianna Fáil leader and Taoiseach in 1951 he could have begun the process of reform of Irish society and the industrialisation of Ireland a decade earlier than 1959 when he eventually achieved the top governmental job. Others speculate whether he had been able to achieve some of his policy reforms he initiated in the 1950s precisely because de Valera was still the leader, his opponents being unwilling to challenge him given that he appeared to have de Valera&#x27;s backing.

What is not in doubt is that Éamon de Valera and Seán Lemass held diametrically different visions of Ireland; de Valera&#x27;s was of a pastoral rural-based society &quot;given to frugal living&quot;, while Lemass had a vision of a modern industrialised society, a member of the European Community. Lemass&#x27;s coolness towards the revival of the Irish language and intellectual agnosticism also contrasted with de Valera&#x27;s passionate Gaelicism and commitment to traditional Catholicism.

===Lemass quotations===
* &#x27;Fianna Fáil is a slightly constitutional party...but before anything we are a republican party.&#x27; (1928)

<text>John Mary Lynch (15 August 1917 – 20 October 1999) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Taoiseach from 1966 to 1973 and 1977 to 1979. He was Leader of Fianna Fáil from 1966 to 1979, Leader of the Opposition from 1973 to 1977, Minister for Finance from 1965 to 1966, Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1959 to 1965, Minister for Education 1957 to 1959, Minister for the Gaeltacht from March 1957 to June 1957, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Parliamentary Secretary to the Government from 1951 to 1954. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1948 to 1981.

Lynch was the third leader of Fianna Fáil from 1966 until 1979, succeeding Seán Lemass. He was the last party leader to secure (in 1977) an overall majority in the Dáil for his party. Historian and journalist T. Ryle Dwyer called him &quot;the most popular Irish politician since Daniel O&#x27;Connell&quot;.

Before his political career Lynch had a successful sporting career as a dual player of Gaelic games. He played hurling with his local club Glen Rovers and with the Cork senior inter-county team from 1936 until 1950. Lynch also played Gaelic football with his local club St Nicholas&#x27; and with the Cork senior inter-county team from 1936 until 1946.

In a senior inter-county hurling career that lasted for fourteen years, he won five All-Ireland titles, seven Munster titles, three National Hurling League titles and seven Railway Cup titles. In a senior inter-county football career that lasted for ten years, Lynch won one All-Ireland title, two Munster titles and one Railway Cup title. Lynch was later named at midfield on the Hurling Team of the Century and the Hurling Team of the Millennium.

==Early and private life==
John Mary Lynch was born on 15 August 1917, in Shandon, on the north side of Cork, and grew up in the nearby area of Blackpool. His father Daniel Lynch was a tailor, and his mother Nora (née O&#x27;Donoghue) was a seamstress. He was the youngest of five boys and fifth of seven children, with four elder brothers and two younger sisters, Jack, as he was known, was generally regarded as the &quot;wild boy&quot; of the family. He was educated at St. Vincent&#x27;s Convent on Peacock Lane, and later at the famous &quot;North Mon&quot;, the North Monastery Christian Brothers School. When Lynch was just thirteen years old his mother died suddenly. His aunt, who herself had a family of six, stepped in to look after the family. Lynch sat his Leaving Certificate in 1936, after which he moved to Dublin and worked with the Dublin District Milk Board, before returning to Cork to take up a position in the Circuit Court Office.

Lynch began working at the Cork Circuit Court as a clerk at the age of nineteen. His work in the court ignited his interest in law and in 1941 he began a night course at University College Cork studying law, where he was a member of the Law Society. After two years in UCC, he moved once again to Dublin to complete his studies at King&#x27;s Inns. While continuing his studies he started work with the Department of Justice. In 1945, Lynch was called to the Bar and had to decide whether to remain in his civil service job or practice as a barrister. Lynch made the decision (literally on the toss of a coin) to move back to Cork and began a private practice on the Cork Circuit.

It was in 1943, while on holidays in Glengariff, County Cork, that Lynch met his future wife, Máirín O&#x27;Connor, the daughter of a naval doctor killed in World War I. The couple were married three years later on 10 August 1946 and had no children. Although she was apprehensive about her husband&#x27;s decision to become active in politics, to become a minister and even to become Taoiseach, she stood by him through it all and helped him make the tough decisions that would affect Lynch&#x27;s life and her own.

== Sporting life ==

From an early age, Lynch showed an enormous interest and great accomplishment as a sportsman. Rugby union, soccer, swimming and handball were all favourite pastimes for Lynch, but it was the sports of Gaelic football and hurling where Lynch showed particular flair.

===Club===
Lynch played his club hurling with the famous Glen Rovers club in Blackpool. He enjoyed much success at underage levels, winning back-to-back minor county championship titles in 1933 and in 1934 as captain. That same year Lynch won his first senior county hurling championship with &quot;the Glen&quot;. It was the first of a record-breaking eight county titles in a row for Glen Rovers and for Lynch, who served as captain of the side on a number of occasions. He finished off his club hurling career by winning a further three county medals in succession in 1948, 1949 and 1950.

Lynch also played club football with &quot;the Glen&#x27;s&quot; sister club St. Nicholas. Once again he enjoyed a successful underage career, winning back-to-back county minor titles in 1932 and 1933. Lynch won an intermediate county title in 1937, before adding a senior county football championship medal to his collection in 1938. Lynch won his second county football medal with &quot;St. Nick&#x27;s&quot; in 1941. While working in Dublin in the mid-1940s, Lynch played club football with the Civil Service GAA team. In 1944 he won a Dublin Senior Football Championship title, alongside fellow Munster native Mick Falvey.

===Inter-county===
By the late 1930s, Lynch was a dual player with the Cork senior hurling and senior football teams. In 1939, he became the only player in history to captain both the inter-county football and hurling teams in the same year. That year he won his first Munster hurling title. However, Kilkenny later accounted for Cork in the famous &quot;thunder and lightning&quot; All-Ireland final. In 1939 and 1940, Lynch guided Cork to back-to-back National Hurling League titles. However, the 1941 championship was severely hampered due to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. Cork only had to play two games to be crowned All-Ireland hurling champions. However, they lost the delayed Munster hurling final to Tipperary.

In 1942, Lynch was selected as Cork hurling captain once again. That year he captured his second set of Munster and All-Ireland medals. The year 1943, proved to be a successful year for Lynch as he won a third Munster hurling medal and a first Munster football medal. While the footballers were later defeated in the All-Ireland semi-final, Lynch&#x27;s hurling team went on to win a third All-Ireland title in a row. In 1944, Lynch captured his fourth Munster hurling title. Later that year Cork created a piece of sporting history by becoming the first team to win four All-Ireland hurling titles in a row. Lynch was one of the heroes of the team who played in all four finals.

In 1945, Cork surrendered their provincial hurling crown, however, Lynch, as a member of the Cork senior football team won his second Munster football title. Cork later defeated Cavan in the All-Ireland final, giving Lynch his first, and only, All-Ireland football medal. In 1946, the Cork hurlers returned to their winning ways and Lynch claimed a fifth provincial hurling title. A fifth All-Ireland hurling medal was later added to his collection following a defeat of old rivals Kilkenny in the final. On that September day in 1946, Lynch made Irish sporting history by becoming the first player to win six consecutive senior All-Ireland medals (five in hurling and one in football).

Lynch captured a sixth Munster hurling medal in 1947, before going on to play in his seventh All-Ireland hurling final in less than a decade. The game itself against Kilkenny has often been described as the greatest All-Ireland final ever played. However, Lynch ended up on the losing side by a single point. There was some consolation at the start of 1948 as Lynch claimed another National Hurling League medal. However, Tipperary quickly became the dominant force in the Munster Championship. Lynch retired from inter-county hurling in 1950. He had retired from inter-county football several years earlier.

===Honours===
Even at the height of his career, Lynch had come to be regarded as one of the all-time greats of Gaelic games. His contribution to the game of hurling was first recognised when he was named as the &quot;Hurling Captain of the Forties&quot;. In the centenary year of the Gaelic Athletic Association in 1984 Lynch was named on the &quot;Hurling Team of the Century&quot;. At the special centenary All-Ireland final in Semple Stadium, he received one of the loudest cheers and rounds of applause when all the former All-Ireland winning hurling captains were introduced to the crowd. Shortly after his death in 1999, Lynch&#x27;s reputation as one of the true greats of the game was further cemented when he was named on the &quot;Hurling Team of the Millennium&quot;.

In 1981, he won an All-Time All Star Award since there was no All Star Awards during his playing days.

==Political life==

===Early career===
In 1946, Lynch had his first involvement in politics when he was asked by his local Fianna Fáil cumann to stand for the Dáil in a by-election. He declined on this occasion, due to his lack of political experience, but indicated that he would be interested in standing in the next general election. In 1947, Lynch refused a similar offer to stand by the new political party Clann na Poblachta. A general election was eventually called for February 1948, Lynch topped the poll for the Cork Borough constituency and became a Fianna Fáil TD in the 13th Dáil. Although Fianna Fáil lost the election and were out of power for the first time in sixteen years, Lynch became speechwriter and research assistant for the party leader, Éamon de Valera.

In 1951, Fianna Fáil were back in power and Lynch was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, with special responsibility for Gaeltacht areas. The party returned to opposition again between 1954 and 1957. During this period Lynch served as Fianna Fáil spokesperson on the Gaeltacht. After the 1957 general election Fianna Fáil returned to office and de Valera headed his last government. Lynch was promoted to cabinet as Minister for Education, as well as holding the Gaeltacht portfolio for a short while. At 39, he was the youngest member of the Government. Lynch introduced innovative legislation, such as raising the school leaving age; reducing school class sizes; removing a ban on married women working as teachers and allowing the Jewish skull cap to be worn but only from the age of 12.

===Minister for Industry and Commerce===
In 1959, Éamon de Valera was elected President of Ireland and Seán Lemass succeeded him as Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader. Lynch was promoted to Lemass&#x27; old portfolio as Minister for Industry and Commerce. In this portfolio, he inherited the most dynamic department in the government. However, having replaced such a political giant, Lynch felt that his own scope for change was severely limited. Lynch was described as not being the most innovative of ministers but was particularly attentive when it came to legislation and detail. It was in this department where Lynch worked closely with Lemass and T. K. Whitaker in generating economic growth and implementing the Programme for Economic Expansion. He was also noted for his astuteness in solving several industrial disputes during his tenure at the department.

===Minister for Finance===
In 1965, Lemass was once again re-elected Taoiseach. The big change was the retirement of such political heavyweights as James Ryan and Seán MacEntee, with Lynch taking over from the former as Minister for Finance. This appointment was particularly significant because Lemass was coming to the end of his premiership and wanted to prepare a successor. As a result, Lynch took charge of the second most important position in the government, gaining widespread experience in a number of affairs, and accompanying Lemass to London to sign one of the most important trade agreements between Ireland and the United Kingdom. One occasion in which Lynch&#x27;s authority was seen to be undermined as Minister for Finance was when the Minister for Education, Donogh O&#x27;Malley, announced that the government would provide free secondary school education for all. This proposal had not been discussed at Cabinet level as would be required to fund such a service. It subsequently transpired that Lemass had previously agreed the decision without cabinet discussion as was required.

===Lemass resignation===
Lemass retired in 1966 after 7 years in the position and a leadership race (the first contested race in the history of the party) threatened to tear Fianna Fáil apart. Lynch, and another favourite of Lemass&#x27;s, Patrick Hillery, ruled themselves out of the leadership election from the very beginning. However, other candidates such as Charles Haughey, George Colley and Neil Blaney threw their hats into the ring immediately. None of the candidates that were being offered to the party seemed particularly appealing and Lemass&#x27; made one last attempt to coax either Hillery or Lynch to join the race as a compromise candidate. Hillery remained adamant that he did not want the leadership and eventually Lynch allowed his name to go forward. Upon hearing this Haughey and Blaney, the latter having never really entered the race in the first place, withdrew and announced their support for Lynch. Colley refused to withdraw and when it was put to a ballot Lynch comfortably defeated him by 52 votes to 19. Lynch was thus elected Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil on 10 November 1966.

The Lynch succession, however, was not a smooth one. Three men had openly expressed ambitions to be Taoiseach, Haughey, Blaney and Colley. Three other cabinet ministers had also contemplated running, these were Brian Lenihan, Kevin Boland and Donogh O&#x27;Malley.

==Taoiseach (1966–1973) ==
Because Lynch was elected as somewhat of a &quot;compromise candidate&quot; it appeared to many that he would only remain as an interim Taoiseach. This thought could not be further from his mind, and he outlined his intentions shortly after coming to power. Lynch took particular exception to the title &quot;Interim Taoiseach&quot; or &quot;Reluctant Taoiseach&quot;. He had no intention of stepping aside after a few years in favour of one of the other candidates who had been unsuccessful against him in 1966. He was, however, reluctant to name his first cabinet. He believed that the existing members of the government owed their positions to Lemass, and so he retained the entire cabinet, albeit with some members moving to different departments. Lynch adopted a chairman-like approach to government allowing his ministers a free run in their respective departments. He continued the modernising and liberal approach that Lemass had begun, albeit at a slower pace. Lynch was lucky in the timing of Lemass&#x27;s resignation. The new Taoiseach now had almost a full Dáil term before the next general election.

===Proportional representation referendum===
With Fianna Fáil having been in power for eleven years by 1968, Lynch was persuaded once again to make an attempt to abolish the proportional representation method of voting in general elections in favour of a first-past-the-post system that was used in the United Kingdom. However, the campaign generated little enthusiasm, even within Fianna Fáil. The main opposition party Fine Gael, along with the Labour Party opposed the referendum when it transpired that Fianna Fáil could win up to 80 or 90 seats in a 144-seat Dáil if the motion was passed. Much like in 1959, when the party tried to make the same referendum, the electorate believed this to be an attempt to institutionalise Fianna Fáil in power, and thus they rejected the motion put to them. This cast doubts on Lynch and his ability to win a general election, however, he proved his critics wrong in the 1969 general election when Fianna Fáil won its first overall majority since Éamon de Valera in 1957, and Lynch proved himself to be a huge electoral asset for the party.

=== Gaeltacht Civil Rights Movement ===
&quot;Gluaiseacht Chearta Sibhialta na Gaeltachta&quot; was a pressure group campaigning for social, economic and cultural rights for native-speakers of Irish living in Gaeltacht areas. It was founded in Connemara in 1969 to highlight the decline of the Irish language and to campaign for greater rights for Irish speaking areas in the area of access to services, broadcasting and ultimately an elected assembly of their own.

The campaign was often of a militant nature, including placing nails under the wheels of the car carrying the Taoiseach Jack Lynch in Galway West during the 1969 general election campaign. Campaigners insisted the Taoiseach answer all of their questions before permitting him to continue on his journey. In that election a member of the campaign, Peadar Mac An Iomaire polled more than 6% of the vote in that constituency.

=== Northern Ireland ===

Northern Ireland, and Lynch&#x27;s attitude to the situation which was about to develop there would come to define his first tenure as Taoiseach. Lynch continued Lemass&#x27;s approach in regard to relations with Northern Ireland. Better relations had been forged between the two parts of Ireland with cooperation between Ministers on several practical issues such as trade, agriculture and tourism. In December 1967, Lynch travelled to Belfast where he met with Prime Minister Terence O&#x27;Neill, for the first time at Stormont. The meeting was arranged in the hope of forming even more links. On 8 January 1968, they met again in Dublin. However, the situation was already beginning to deteriorate in Northern Ireland with civil unrest and the resignation of O&#x27;Neill to come. O&#x27;Neill continued to hold Lynch in high regard stating in the House of Lords in 1972:
Shortly after Lynch&#x27;s election victory in 1969, tensions in Northern Ireland finally spilled over and &quot;The Troubles&quot; began. The sight of refugees from the North teeming across the border turned public opinion in the Republic. The Battle of the Bogside in Derry between the Royal Ulster Constabulary and residents in August 1969, prompted Lynch on 13 August to make what some people consider on RTÉ, commenting on the ever-increasingly violent situation he said:

Lynch&#x27;s statement that the Irish Government could &quot;no longer stand by&quot; was interpreted by some Unionists in Northern Ireland as hinting at military intervention (and was misquoted as a promise not to &quot;stand by&quot;). A minority of ministers – two, according to Desmond O&#x27;Malley – would have favoured such a course, but the Irish Army was completely unprepared for an operation of this kind. The majority of the cabinet opposed military intervention, and Lynch took no such action, though he commissioned a study named &quot;Exercise Armageddon&quot;. As the violence continued, the Minister for External Affairs, Patrick Hillery, met the British Foreign Secretary and also went to the United Nations in a plea to send a peacekeeping force to the North and to highlight the Irish government&#x27;s case. However, little else was achieved from these meetings other than media coverage of the activities in the north. The situation in Northern Ireland continued to deteriorate during Lynch&#x27;s first term. Bloody Sunday (30 January 1972), saw the killing of 14 unarmed civilians by British paratroopers and a backlash of anti-British feeling in all parts of Ireland, including the burning of the British Embassy in Dublin.

Despite the strains in relations between the United Kingdom and Ireland in the wake of those events, the then British Ambassador, Sir John Peck, praised Lynch, of whom he said &quot;all those concerned with, and committed to, peace with justice in the North owe a very great deal to his courage and tenacity&quot;, adding that &quot;I do not think that I ever succeeded in convincing British politicians of how much we owed him at that stage, or what the consequences would have been if he had lost his head&quot;.

===Arms crisis===

Lynch&#x27;s attitude towards the Northern Ireland question and the application of Fianna Fáil party policy to it would eventually come to define his first period as Taoiseach, and would once again show his critics that far from being &quot;reluctant&quot; he was in fact a strong and decisive leader. His strong leadership skills and determination were clearly evident in 1970, when allegations (later disproved in court, though questions since have emerged challenging that verdict in one case), that the hardline republican Minister for Agriculture, Neil Blaney, and the Minister for Finance, Charles Haughey, were involved in an attempt to use £100,000 in aid money to import arms for the Provisional IRA. Both ministers were sacked after some initial procrastination on Lynch&#x27;s part, his innocent Minister for Justice, Mícheál Ó Móráin, retired the day before and a fourth minister, Kevin Boland and his Parliamentary Secretary, resigned in sympathy with Haughey and Blaney. The whole affair, which became known as the Arms Crisis, allowed Lynch to stamp his control on his government, but would eventually lead to deep division in Fianna Fáil for many decades to come. It is now believed by some that Lynch was aware of these activities and acted only when his hand was forced when the Garda Special Branch informed the leader of the opposition and threatened to go to the media.

===EEC membership===

One of the high points of Lynch&#x27;s first term as Taoiseach, and possibly one of the most important events in modern Irish history, was Ireland&#x27;s entry into the European Economic Community. Lynch personally steered the application for membership. Membership was accepted by a five-to-one majority in a referendum. Ireland officially joined, along with its nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom and Denmark, on 1 January 1973. Patrick Hillery became Ireland&#x27;s first European Commissioner. In appointing Hillery Europe was gaining one of Ireland&#x27;s most experienced politicians, while on the other hand, Lynch was losing one of his staunchest allies. The admittance of Ireland was the culmination of a decade of preparation which was begun by Lynch and his predecessor, Seán Lemass, who unfortunately did not live to see what would have been his greatest achievement.

===Social change===

A number of social initiatives were carried out during Lynch&#x27;s two periods as Taoiseach, including the introduction of Occupational Injuries Benefit, Retirement Pension, and Deserted Wife&#x27;s Allowance, and an increase in the single earner&#x27;s unemployment replacement rate. In 1967, a redundancy payments scheme was introduced, and in 1970, various improvements in welfare provision for women were introduced. Maternity insurance was extended to all female employees, a social insurance benefit for deserted wives was introduced, a means-tested allowance for unmarried mothers was established, and an earnings-related component was added to the basic flat-rate maternity benefit. In 1967, free secondary education was introduced, together with free transport to school &quot;for those living more than three miles from the nearest school&quot;. In 1972, entitlement to free travel on public transport was introduced for all persons of pensionable age, while people eligible for free hospital care became entitled to prescription drug reimbursement over a certain amount each month.

==Opposition (1973–1977)==
Lynch&#x27;s government was expected to collapse following the Arms Crisis; however, it survived until 1973. Lynch had wanted to call the general election for the end of 1972, however, events had conspired against him and the date was set for February 1973. Lynch&#x27;s government was defeated by the National Coalition of Fine Gael and the Labour Party at the 1973 general election. Liam Cosgrave was elected Taoiseach and Lynch found himself on the opposition benches for the first time in sixteen years. However, Lynch&#x27;s popularity remained steadfast, so much so that during his tenure as Leader of the Opposition he was frequently referred to as &quot;the Real Taoiseach.&quot;

Lynch had some success while out of power. He had finally gained complete control of the party, having neutralised his rivals for leadership during the Arms Crisis, and initiated Fianna Fáil&#x27;s electoral comeback by securing the election of its candidate, Erskine H. Childers, as President of Ireland in 1973, defeating the odds-on favourite, the National Coalition&#x27;s Tom O&#x27;Higgins of Fine Gael.

In 1975, Lynch allowed Charles Haughey to return to his Front Bench as Spokesperson on Health. There was much media criticism of Lynch for this move. In the same year the Foreign Affairs Spokesperson, Michael O&#x27;Kennedy, published a Fianna Fáil policy document calling for a withdrawal of British forces from Northern Ireland. The document was an echo of Fianna Fáil&#x27;s republican origins, and although Lynch was not happy with it, he did not stop it.

Controversy continued to dog the National Coalition when the President of Ireland, Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh, resigned in 1976, after being called a &quot;thundering disgrace&quot; by the Minister for Defence, Paddy Donegan. Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave refused to sack his Minister and the government&#x27;s popularity took a downturn. A former Fianna Fáil cabinet Minister and a political ally of Lynch, Patrick Hillery, was eventually nominated (without election) as Ó Dálaigh&#x27;s successor and sixth President of Ireland.

In 1977, the government, although reasonably unpopular, felt sure of an election victory and a June date for the poll was fixed. The National Coalition&#x27;s spirits had been buoyed up by the actions of the Minister for Local Government, James Tully. In what became known as the Tullymander (a pun on the word gerrymander) he re-drew every constituency in Ireland (as he had authority to do), apparently favouring Fine Gael and Labour Party candidates. However, when the election took place the coalition was swept out of office by Fianna Fáil which won an unprecedented twenty-seat Dáil majority and over 50% of the first preference votes. Lynch himself received the biggest personal vote in the state. Although the large parliamentary majority seemed to restore Lynch as an electoral asset, the fact that the party was returned with an enormous vote allowed Lynch to be undermined by many new TDs who were not loyal to Lynch and wanted him removed.

==2nd term as Taoiseach (1977–1979) ==
Early on in his second term as Taoiseach, Lynch decided that he would not lead Fianna Fáil into another general election campaign. The date of January 1980 was in his mind as a possible retirement date, however, nothing had been made definite. It was during this time, due to a combination of a large parliamentary majority and the search for a new leader, when party discipline began to break down.

===The economy===

In the party&#x27;s election manifesto in 1977 Fianna Fáil promised a whole range of new economic measures. These measures included the abolition of car tax, rates on houses and a number of other vote-winning &quot;sweeteners&quot;. A new Department of Economic Planning and Development was established to kick-start Ireland&#x27;s flagging economy and to implement these new measures. The government abolished domestic rates on houses and unemployment fell from 106,000 to 90,000 between 1977 and 1979, however, other actions that were taken were not so productive. In 1978, the Irish economy recorded the biggest deficit for an advanced country at 17.6% deficit. The national debt increased by £2 billion in the same period, protest marches by PAYE workers, an increase in electricity charges and the oil crisis of 1979 also caused problems for the government and its economic policy.

===Party discipline===

The year 1978 saw the first open revolt in party discipline. There was an open mutiny by many backbenchers when the Minister for Finance, George Colley, attempted to impose a 2% levy on farmers. Although the levy was widely popular with the electorate, Colley was forced into a humiliating climbdown at the behest of the backbenchers and the authority of the government was shaken – particularly when the levy withdrawal was met with mass protests.

Charles Haughey, the Minister for Health, proposed the Health (Family Planning) Bill 1979, which provided for the availability of contraception with a prescription. Jim Gibbons, the Minister for Agriculture, who was a devout Catholic and had a deep hatred of Haughey, failed to attend and vote for this legislation. It was the only time when a TD, let alone a cabinet Minister, was allowed to flout the party whip in Fianna Fáil and damaged Lynch&#x27;s authority when he failed to dismiss the minister from the government and expel him from the parliamentary party. As well as this, a group of backbench TDs began to lobby other TDs in support of Charles Haughey, should a leadership election arise. This group, known as the &quot;gang of five,&quot; consisted of Jackie Fahey, Tom McEllistrim, Seán Doherty, Mark Killilea and Albert Reynolds.

=== Lynch&#x27;s resignation ===
In June, the first direct elections to the European Parliament took place, with Fianna Fáil polling under 35%. A five-month postal strike also led to deep anger across the country. On 27 August 1979, the Provisional IRA assassinated Lord Mountbatten in County Sligo. On the same day, the IRA killed 18 British soldiers at Warrenpoint in County Down. A radical security review and greater cross-border cooperation were discussed with the new British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. These discussions led Síle de Valera, a backbench TD, to directly challenge the leadership in a speech at the Liam Lynch commemoration at Fermoy, County Cork, on 9 September. Although Lynch quickly tried to impose party discipline, attempting to discipline her for opposing party policy at a parliamentary party meeting held at 28 September, de Valera pointed out that she had not opposed the party policy regarding the North which called for the declaration of the British intent to withdraw from the north. The result was embarrassing for Lynch.

The visit of Pope John Paul II to Ireland in September proved to be a welcome break for Lynch from the day-to-day running of the country. In November, just before Lynch departed on a visit to the United States he decided that he would resign at the end of the year. This would allow him to complete his six-month term as President of the European Community. The defining event which made up his mind was the loss of two by-elections on 7 November by Fianna Fáil in his native Cork (Cork City and Cork North-East). In addition, during the trip, Lynch claimed in an interview with the &quot;Washington Post&quot; that a five-kilometre air corridor between the border was agreed upon during the meeting with Thatcher to enhance security cooperation. This was something highly unsavoury to many in Fianna Fáil. When Lynch returned he was confronted openly by Síle de Valera, Bill Loughnane, a noted hardline Republican backbencher, along with Tom McEllistrim, a member of Haughey&#x27;s gang of five, at a parliamentary party meeting. Lynch stated that the British did not have permission to overfly the border. Afterwards, Loughnane went public with the details of the meeting and accused Lynch of deliberately misleading the party. An attempt to remove the whip from Loughnane failed. At this stage, Lynch&#x27;s position had become untenable, with supporters of Haughey caucusing opinion within the party.

George Colley, the man whom Lynch saw as his successor, went to him and encouraged him to resign sooner. Colley was convinced that he had enough support to defeat the other likely candidate, Charles Haughey, and that Lynch should resign early to catch his opponents off guard. Lynch agreed and resigned as leader of Fianna Fáil on 5 December 1979, assured that Colley had the votes necessary to win. However, Haughey and his supporters had been preparing for months to take over the leadership and Lynch&#x27;s resignation came as no surprise. He narrowly defeated Colley in the leadership contest and succeeded Lynch as Taoiseach.

Lynch remained in the Dáil as a TD until he retired from politics at the 1981 general election.

== Retirement ==

Following Lynch&#x27;s retirement from politics the offers from various companies flooded in. He became a director on the boards of a number of companies, including Irish Distillers, Smurfit and Hibernian Insurance. He also embarked on a good deal of foreign travel. He was conferred with the freedom of his native city of Cork. He continued to speak on political issues, particularly in favour of Desmond O&#x27;Malley at the time of his expulsion from Fianna Fáil. Lynch also declined to accept nominations to become President of Ireland, a position he had little interest in. In 1992, he suffered a severe health setback, and in 1993 suffered a stroke in which he nearly lost his sight. Following this he withdrew from public life, preferring to remain at his home with his wife Máirín where he continued to be dogged by ill health.

Lynch continued to be honoured by, among others, the Gaelic Athletic Association and various other organisations. In 1999, the Jack Lynch Tunnel under the river Lee was named by Cork Corporation in his honour. A plaque was also erected at his childhood home in the Blackpool area of Cork, where a statue of him on a bench was erected after his death.

On 20 October 1999, Lynch died in the Royal Hospital, Donnybrook, Dublin at the age of 82. He was honoured with a state funeral which was attended by the President of Ireland Mary McAleese, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, former Taoisigh John Bruton, Albert Reynolds and Charles Haughey, and various political persons from all parties. The coffin was then flown from Dublin to Cork where a procession through the streets of the city drew some of the biggest crowds in the city&#x27;s history. After the Requiem Mass celebrated in his home parish of the Cathedral of St Mary and St Anne, Lynch&#x27;s friend and political ally, Desmond O&#x27;Malley, delivered the graveside oration, paying tribute to Lynch&#x27;s sense of decency. He is buried in St. Finbarr&#x27;s Cemetery, Cork.

==Legacy==
Jack Lynch has been described as &quot;the most popular Irish politician since Daniel O&#x27;Connell&quot;. This praise did not come from Lynch&#x27;s allies or even his own party, but from the former leader of Fine Gael, Liam Cosgrave, who had succeeded Lynch after his first tenure as Taoiseach. As a sportsman Lynch earned a reputation for decency and fair play, characteristics he brought to political life.

==Governments==
The following governments were led by Jack Lynch:
*12th government of Ireland (November 1966 – July 1969)
*13th government of Ireland (July 1969 – March 1973)
*15th government of Ireland (July 1977 – December 1979)

<text>: &quot;Rapira is also a name for the Soviet 100 mm anti-tank gun T-12&quot;
Rapira (, rapier) is an educational procedural programming language developed in the Soviet Union and implemented on the Agat computer, PDP-11 clones (Electronika, DVK, BK series), and Intel 8080 and Zilog Z80 clones (Korvet). It is interpreted with a dynamic type system and high level constructions. The language originally had a Russian-based set of reserved words (keywords), but English and Romanian were added later. It was considered more elegant and easier to use than Pascal implementations of the time.

Rapira was used to teach computer programming in Soviet schools. The integrated development environment included a text editor and a debugger.

Sample program:
 ПРОЦ СТАРТ()
 ВЫВОД: &#x27;Привет, мир!!!&#x27;
 КОН ПРОЦ

The same, but using the English lexics [sic, from the article referenced below]:
 proc start()
 output: &#x27;Hello, world!!!&#x27;;
 end proc

Rapira&#x27;s ideology was based on languages such as POP-2 and SETL, with strong influences from ALGOL.

Consequently, for example, Rapira implements a very strong, flexible, and interesting data structure, named a &quot;tuple&quot;. in Rapira, these are heterogeneous lists with allowed operations such as indexing, joining, length count, getting of sublist, easy comparison, etc.

<text>Andrey Petrovich Yershov (; 19 April 1931, Moscow – 8 December 1988, Moscow) was a Soviet computer scientist, notable as a pioneer in systems programming and programming language research. 

Donald Knuth considers him to have independently co-discovered the idea of hashing with linear probing. He also created one of the first algorithms for compiling arithmetic expressions.

He was responsible for the languages &quot;ALPHA&quot; and &quot;Rapira&quot;, the first Soviet time-sharing system &quot;AIST-0&quot;, electronic publishing system &quot;RUBIN&quot;, and a multiprocessing workstation &quot;MRAMOR&quot;. He also was the initiator of developing the &quot;Computer Bank of the Russian Language&quot; (Машинный Фонд Русского Языка), the Soviet project for creating a large representative Russian corpus, a project in the 1980s comparable to the Bank of English and British National Corpus. The Russian National Corpus created by the Russian Academy of Sciences in the 2000s is a successor of Yershov&#x27;s project.

From 1959, he worked at the Siberian Division of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union, and helped found both the &quot;Novosibirsk Computer Center&quot; and the &quot;Siberian School of Computer Science&quot;.

He received the Academician A. N. Krylov Prize from the Academy of Sciences, the first programmer to be so recognized. In 1974, he was made a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society.

He was involved with developing international standards in programming and informatics, as a member of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) IFIP Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi, which specified, maintains, and supports the languages ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68. In 1981, he received the IFIP&#x27;s &quot;Silver Core Award&quot;.

To the computer science community, he is mostly known for his speech &quot;Aesthetics and the Human Factor in Programming&quot; presented at the dinner at the AFIPS Spring Joint Computer Conference in 1972 and, due to its importance, republished as an article by the Communications of the ACM.

<text>Johnny Young (born Johnny Benjamin de Jong, 12 March 1947, Rotterdam, Netherlands) is an Australian singer, composer, record producer, disc jockey, television producer and host. He had a number-one hit with the double-A-sided single, &quot;Step Back&quot; and a cover of the Strangeloves&#x27; &quot;Cara-lyn&quot; in 1966. He was concurrently the host of TV pop music program &quot;The Go!! Show&quot;. In the mid-1960s, he toured with the Rolling Stones and supported Roy Orbison.

As a composer, he penned number-one hits, &quot;The Real Thing&quot; and &quot;The Girl That I Love&quot; for Russell Morris, &quot;The Star&quot; for Ross D. Wyllie and &quot;I Thank You&quot; for Lionel Rose. He also wrote a number-two single, &quot;Smiley&quot; for Ronnie Burns. He presented and produced the TV show, &quot;Young Talent Time&quot;, which screened on Network Ten from 1971 to 1988. It launched the careers of several teen pop stars and theatre actors, Danni Minogue, Tina Arena, Jamie Redfern, Jane Scali, Debra Byrne, Sally Boyden and Karen Knowles. Typically each episode closed with a ballad style sing-along rendition of the Beatles&#x27; song, &quot;All My Loving&quot;.

At the Logie Awards of 1990, sponsored by &quot;TV Week&quot;, Young was inducted into the Logies Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2010 by Arena who performed Young&#x27;s song, &quot;The Star&quot;. He is the first person inducted into both halls of fame.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Johnny Young was born as Johnny Benjamin de Jong on 12 March 1947 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.[A] He was conceived as a result of an affair between his mother, Anna Wilhelmina (20 July 1913 – 29 December 1989) and a musician, Johannes. He was raised as the youngest son of Anna and her husband Fokke Jan de Jong (22 March 1914 – 15 July 1989), who was in the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army and served in Indonesia after World War II. His half-siblings are Cornellia (born 13 February 1936), Antonia (born 22 August 1937) and Ferdinand (born 13 November 1944). Their father was still in Indonesia from December 1946 until September 1948 when Young was one-and-a-half years old. The family migrated to Perth, Western Australia, Fokke arrived in July 1953, and they settled in the Perth Hills suburb of Kalamunda, in the 1950s. Fokke worked as a welder on industrial projects including the Kwinana Oil Refinery. His mother was in a choir and inspired his early interest in music. On 25 August 1959 Johnny, Ferdinand and Fokke were naturalised as Australian citizens.

Young&#x27;s mother took him to Saturday morning radio shows for children and he would sing along. He performed solo songs wearing a specially made jacket. After leaving school, he worked as a trainee disc jockey and started singing at local dances. From the age of 14, for 18 months he was lead vocalist of the Nomads, later known as the Strangers (not the Melbourne group called the Strangers), which consisted of Young, John Eddy (guitar), Warwick Findlay (drums), Don Prior (bass guitar) and Tony Summers (guitar).

===Pop singer===
At eighteen-years-old, Young was host of TVW-7 Perth television pop music show &quot;Club Seventeen&quot; in early 1965. As Johnny Young &amp; the Strangers he released two singles, &quot;Club Seventeen&quot;/&quot;Oh Johnny, No&quot; and &quot;No Other Love&quot;/&quot;Heigh Ho&quot;, both on the 7-Teen label. Young then signed with Clarion Records, a Perth-based label run by Martin Clarke. In an interview Clarke said &quot;We just got together and he said he wanted to make a national hit and branch out, he was very ambitious.&quot; Clarke, armed with his recordings of Young, went to Sydney and secured a deal with Festival Records to have the Clarion label manufactured and distributed throughout Australia.

The following year, 1966, he formed Johnny Young &amp; Kompany, As lead vocalist he was backed by Eddy (guitar), Findlay (drums), Summers (guitar) and Jim Griffiths (bass). After performing as supporting act to the Easybeats in early 1966, Young recorded &quot;Step Back&quot;, which was co-written by the Easybeats&#x27; members Stevie Wright and George Young (no relation). The single was released in May 1966 as a double-A-side with his cover version of &quot;Cara-Lyn&quot;, originally by the Strangeloves. The release peaked at number one on the &quot;Go-Set&quot; National Top 40 in November. It was one of the biggest-selling Australian singles of the 1960s, behind Normie Rowe&#x27;s &quot;Que Sera Sera&quot;/&quot;Shakin&#x27; All Over&quot;. In October, his EP &quot;Let It Be Me&quot; went to number four on &quot;Go-Set&quot; National Top 40.

Johnny Young &amp; Kompany moved to Melbourne in mid-1966. Mick Wade (ex-the Vibrants) joined on guitar and organ. Young was interviewed by &quot;Go-Set&quot; writer, Ian &quot;Molly&quot; Meldrum for their 13 July issue. Later that year Young compered the short-lived television pop show &quot;Too Much&quot; and in 1967 he hosted &quot;The Go!! Show&quot;, following the resignation of Ian Turpie. In January the band released covers of the Everly Brothers&#x27; hits &quot;When Will I Be Loved?&quot; /&quot;Kiss Me Now&quot; as another double-A-sided single which peaked at number three. He disbanded Kompany to go solo and supported Roy Orbison, The Walker Brothers, The Mixtures and The Yardbirds at the Festival Hall, Melbourne on Australia Day (26 January). While touring in Brisbane he met Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees and provided Gibb with airfare to Sydney for a television spot. Another hit for Young was his slower version of the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;All My Loving&quot; which reached number four nationally in May; it later became his signature song.

Young won a Logie for &quot;Best Teenage Personality&quot; in 1967 for his work on &quot;The Go!! Show&quot;. On 9 August &quot;Go-Set&quot; published its annual pop poll and Young was voted third &quot;Most Popular Male&quot; behind Ronnie Burns and Rowe. However, the show was axed by mid-year and he relocated to London where he shared a flat with Gibb. In July, he released &quot;Lady&quot;, written by Gibb especially for him, which reached the Top 40. &quot;Craise Finton Kirk&quot;, written by Barry and Robin Gibb, was released in August and peaked at number 14. It was followed by &quot;Every Christian Lion Hearted Man Will Show You&quot;, written by Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb, but did not chart. Young briefly returned to Perth in September and teamed up with drummer Danny Finley (ex-MPD Ltd), they both flew to London to form Danny&#x27;s Word with Rob Alexander on guitar and Pete Friedberg on bass guitar. After four weeks rehearsal in London the band played a residency at the Star Club in Hamburg as a precursor to touring Australia. Due to other commitments the band split on return from Germany when Pete Friedberg left to work with other bands including Ainsley Dunbar&#x27;s Blue Whale and Dusty Springfield. Young returned to Australia in January 1968 with Rod Alexander and recorded &quot;Unconcientious Objector&quot; and his last Top 40 single, &quot;It&#x27;s a Sunny Day&quot;. Subsequent singles did not reach the Top 40. Young became a news and gossip writer for &quot;Go-Set&quot; from December 1968 to August 1969.

===Songwriter===
While sharing a flat with Barry Gibb in London in late 1967, Young was encouraged to write songs. Gibb taught him that &quot;there are no rules in song-writing, there is a structure, but what you need to do is find the &#x27;hook&#x27;, and it could be in the melody, the chorus, the words or even an identifiable riff, and that can be the difference in writing a hit record.&quot; During 1968, back in Australia, Young wrote &quot;The Real Thing&quot; as a reaction against a Coca-Cola jingle, &quot;Coke is the real thing&quot;. Young envisaged the song as a low-key acoustic ballad (in the style of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;) and he originally intended it for his friend and fellow singer Ronnie Burns. Young was practising the song in a dressing room during taping of TV pop music show &quot;Uptight&quot; when pop producer and fellow &quot;Go-Set&quot; writer Ian Meldrum heard it. Meldrum (who was also manager for solo singer Russell Morris (ex-Somebody&#x27;s Image) was greatly impressed by the song and immediately insisted that Young cut a demo of it for Morris. Under Meldrum&#x27;s production and with the collaboration of engineer John L. Sayers the song was radically transformed into a seven-minute psychedelic epic, with an elaborately edited backing track performed by an all-star band including ex-Zoot guitarist Roger Hicks (who composed the acoustic guitar intro), members of Melbourne band The Groop and backing vocalist Maureen Elkner. Reportedly the most expensive single ever recorded in Australia up to that time, it became one of the biggest Australian pop hits of 1969, peaking at number one in May and was number one on &quot;Go-Set&quot; Top Records for the Year of 1969, and made Morris an immediate national star. It was later covered by Kylie Minogue and by Midnight Oil. Young&#x27;s next song for Morris, &quot;The Girl That I Love&quot;, was released as a double-A-side with &quot;Part Three into Paper Walls&quot; (another epic extended production co-written by Morris and Young) which reached number one in October.

TV pop music show, &quot;Uptight&quot;, was hosted by Ross D. Wyllie who recorded the Young-penned, &quot;The Star&quot; – it was later covered by Herman&#x27;s Hermits as &quot;Here Comes the Star&quot; – which replaced &quot;The Girl That I Love&quot; at number one in November. It had been written to describe the loneliness associated with fame in show business. Young also wrote and produced hits for Burns including &quot;Smiley&quot;, which peaked at number two in February 1970. It described their mutual friend, Rowe, who had been conscripted to serve in the Vietnam War. Rowe recorded his own version on &quot;Missing in Action&quot; (2007). Young wrote &quot;I Thank You&quot; for former boxing champion Lionel Rose which reached number one in March. It was used by comedy duo, Roy and HG, for their calls of football grand finals in the 1990s. On 11 July 1970, &quot;Go-Set&quot; pop poll voted Young as most popular &#x27;Composer&#x27; of the year and in 1971 he finished second behind Morris.

===&quot;Young Talent Time&quot;===
In 1970, Young formed a production company with Kevin Lewis (former Festival Records executive), Lewis-Young Productions, which developed the pop music television show &quot;Happening &#x27;70&quot; – hosted by Wyllie – for the ATV-0 channel, it was subsequently followed by &quot;Happening &#x27;71&quot; and &quot;Happening &#x27;72&quot;. Lewis-Young Productions also developed &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; from April 1971, a children&#x27;s variety show and talent quest with Young as host. Regular cast members were known as the Young Talent Team, the show was a launching pad for several Australian performers including Jamie Redfern, Debra Byrne, Dannii Minogue and Tina Arena. The directors were Garry Dunstan and Terry Higgins. Each episode typically ended with Young and the team singing &quot;All My Loving&quot; as a lullaby. Young established the Johnny Young Talent School for performance arts in 1979, some of its students became contestants and regulars on &quot;Young Talent Time&quot;. 2004 &quot;Australian Idol&quot; runner-up Anthony Callea trained with the school, as did the 2008 winner, Wes Carr.

As well as producing the television series, Lewis-Young Productions distributed related merchandise including records on their own label (L&amp;Y), books and magazines, a board game and a set of chewing gum cards. In 1972, &quot;Caravan Holiday&quot;, a short film, featured the original six Young Talent Team members plus two recently recruited new members, Greg Mills (later to be musical director in last years of YTT) and Julie Ryles (who died in early 2011) with cameos by pop star Johnny Farnham and long term judge Evie Hayes. Young was cast in multiple cameo roles as a service station attendant, farmer, speed boat attendant and camping park manager.

In 1989, Ten Network (formerly ATV-0), axed &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; quoting poor ratings against the popular variety series &quot;Hey Hey Its Saturday&quot;. Young had committed to building his own television studios to film &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; and was forced to sell his family home to finance the debts. During the year his stepfather died and, with his mother, he tracked down his biological father. Soon after his mother also died, and his marriage was in trouble. On 9 March 1990, Young was inducted into the &quot;TV Week&quot; Logie Awards&#x27; Hall of Fame for &quot;an outstanding and sustained contribution to Australian television.&quot;

From 24 October 2006, weekly magazine &quot;New Idea&quot; featured articles on Byrne&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Not Quite Ripe&quot;, which alleged that from the age of 12 she was introduced to sex, drugs and alcohol on &quot;Young Talent Time&quot;. The claims were vigorously denied by Young, he stated that Byrne was already 14 when she started and that drugs were not available on set, &quot;Any drug-taking Debra did, she certainly didn&#x27;t do it on our show.&quot; He said no-one on the show was aware of her affair with &quot;Michael&quot;, a boom operator ten years her senior. According to Byrne the pair had run off together for a weekend when she was 15. A producer for the show had &quot;Michael&quot; replaced as boom operator. Byrne also claimed that her parents knew of her relationship with &quot;Michael&quot;.

In 2009, Young indicated that he was in talks with Network Ten to create an updated version of Young Talent Time. The new series aired on Network Ten from 22 January to 4 May 2012 and was hosted by Rob Mills, with Young serving as executive producer and judge.

===Philippines controversy===
In the early 1990s, Young learned that Terry Higgins, a former &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; studio director, had contracted HIV. By 1993, Young had financially supported Higgins, who sought alternative ozone therapy in the Philippines, but the clinic turned out to have a forged license and when it was raided, the Filipino authorities mistook Young for the owner and arrested him under charges of running an illegal AIDS clinic after accompanying Higgins. Young was tested for AIDS and threatened with deportation back to Australia. Subsequently, all charges were dropped, but Young&#x27;s public image was damaged by media coverage of rumours regarding his sexuality. ABC Television produced an episode on &quot;Australian Story&quot; in February 2000 in which he discussed the events and their effect on his life and career. A year after seeking the ozone therapy, Higgins died of AIDS with Young still supporting him.

===Later career===
After &quot;Young Talent Time&quot;, Young continued in entertainment, he worked as a radio disc jockey and occasionally performed live. In 1999 he produced &quot;Cavalcade of Stars&quot; for Foxtel including repackaging segments of &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; and showcasing new Australian bands.

In December 2000, Young relocated to Perth to become the breakfast host on Perth AM station 6IX. During 2001 to 2004, he periodically performed with Rowe, Buddy England (ex-The Seekers, The Mixtures) and Marcie Jones (Marcie and The Cookies) as the &#x27;Legends of Sixties Rock&#x27; at venues across Australia – all four had appeared on &quot;The Go-Show&quot;. While living in Perth, Young established a new outlet for his Johnny Young Talent School franchise. In 2001, the 30th anniversary of &quot;Young Talent Time&quot; was celebrated by Network Ten with a special documentary, &quot;Young Talent Time Tells All&quot;, which was followed on 4 November by a reunion party for former cast members. Young attended with his daughter Anna – who had appeared on the show. Back in Perth, Young hosted &quot;The Pet Show&quot; on ABC Television in 2006.

On 27 October 2010, Johnny Young was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame. On news of his impending induction Young said &quot;I have always felt like the luckiest kid on the block to be able to continue working in the music industry for 50 years in so many areas when basically I am just a rock and roller. To receive this honour is the cherry on an amazing cake. I am very grateful to all those who supported and encouraged me.&quot; Young was inducted by Tina Arena, a former Young Talent Team member, who performed his song, &quot;Here Comes the Star&quot; as a musical tribute. Twenty-first century pop group, Short Stack performed Young&#x27;s version of &quot;Cara-Lyn&quot;. In late September 2021, &quot;Young Talent Time: Unmasked&quot;, a special celebrating the 50th anniversary of &quot;Young Talent Time&quot;, was broadcast, with Young, Dannii Minogue and Arena reminiscing via teleconferencing.

==Personal life==
Young was raised as the son of Fokke Jan de Jong and his wife Anna. They already had three children Cornelia, Antonia and Ferdinand. His mother had an affair while her husband was stationed in Indonesia, and Young&#x27;s biological father was a singer, Johannes. When Young was in his 40s he met Johannes and found that he had three other half-siblings. His first marriage was to Jane, with whom he had his son Craig, but the marriage ended in divorce and Jane died of leukaemia. In the early 1970s, he married his second wife Cathy and they had two daughters Anna and Fleur.

Both his mother and step-father died in 1989 and his marriage to Cathy ended by 1995. Young married Rose McKimmie on 24 December 1999 in Bali and they lived in a battery-operated rural cottage about an hour-and-half from Melbourne. In February 2014 he said the marriage to Rose had been a mistake and lasted only eighteen months. He married Marisha, an economist, in 2002 and they remain together as of 2017.

Young has had three children, Craig (died c. 2014 of pancreatic cancer), Anna and Fleur; nine grandchildren; and one great-grandchild. Anna is a singing and dancing teacher for seniors at The Johnny Young Talent School, after studying at Melbourne Conservatorium of Music and performing in musical theatre. Fleur works in fashion.

<text>Albert Martin Reynolds (3 November 1932 – 21 August 2014) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Taoiseach and Leader of Fianna Fáil from 1992 to 1994. He held cabinet positions between 1979 and 1991, including Minister for Finance from 1988 to 1991. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for Longford–Roscommon from 1977 to 1992, and for Longford–Westmeath from 1992 to 2002. 

During his first term as Taoiseach, he led a Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrats coalition. In his second term, he headed a coalition between Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party.

== Early life ==
Albert Martin Reynolds was born in Kilglas, near Roosky, at the County Roscommon–Leitrim border on 3 November 1932. His father was a carpenter and coachbuilder. Reynolds&#x27;s political enemies would call him a &quot;country bumpkin&quot; due to his background.

In the 1950s, he was educated at Summerhill College, Sligo, and found work as a clerk with CIÉ, the state transport service. Reynolds left what many would consider being a &quot;job for life&quot; in the state company and moved into the showband scene, going on to own several dance halls in his local area. He became wealthy during the 1960s when dance halls proved to be extremely popular. He invested his money in several businesses, including a pet food company, a bacon factory, a fish exporting operation, and a hire purchase company. Reynolds also had business interests in local newspapers and a cinema. He developed a network of business contacts both nationally and internationally.

Although his dance hall empire required late-night work, Reynolds abstained from alcohol. Reynolds married Kathleen Coen (1932–2021) in 1962 and together they had seven children.

== Early political life ==
Reynolds became interested in politics during the Arms Crisis, a controversial episode in which two government ministers, Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries Neil Blaney and Minister for Finance Charles Haughey, were removed from the government over an attempt to send arms to Northern Ireland in 1970. The events caused thousands of Catholic families had been driven out of their homes, of whom 1,000 had fled across the border to the Republic of Ireland. Blaney and Haughey were later acquitted in court.

In the wake of this case, Reynolds launched a political career from his background as a successful West Ireland businessman. However, at 44 years of age when first an electoral candidate, he was considered a late starter. He stood for Fianna Fáil at the 1977 general election for the Longford–Westmeath constituency. The election proved to be a landslide victory for Fianna Fáil, with the party receiving a 20-seat parliamentary majority, resulting in Jack Lynch returning as Taoiseach.

Reynolds remained a backbencher until 1979. That year, pressure mounted on Lynch, the incumbent Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader, to step down. Reynolds became a member of the so-called &quot;gang of five&quot; politicians of a strong rural background, with Jackie Fahey (Tipperary), Mark Killilea Jnr (Galway), Tom McEllistrim (Kerry) and Seán Doherty (Roscommon), which aligned itself to Charles Haughey and supported him in the subsequent leadership contest.

=== Fianna Fáil minister ===
Reynolds was rewarded for his staunch loyalty by joining the newly elected Taoiseach Charles Haughey&#x27;s cabinet as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. He was appointed Minister for Transport, making his brief one of the largest and most wide-ranging in the government. As Minister for Transport, Reynolds was involved in an incident in which an Aer Lingus plane was hijacked by a disturbed former monk, with the hijacker&#x27;s chief demand for the safe return of the aircraft and its passengers being that he should be allowed to reveal a religious secret, the Third Secret of Fatima, which he claimed to have in his briefcase. The incident was resolved in Paris with no injuries.

Fianna Fáil lost power following the 1981 general election but regained it again following the February 1982 general election. Reynolds returned to government as Minister for Industry and Energy. He was responsible for developing the Dublin to Cork gas pipeline. That government fell in late 1982, and Reynolds was back on the opposition benches. During the 1982–83 period, the Fianna Fáil leader, Charles Haughey, faced three no-confidence motions. Reynolds gave him his support at all times, and Haughey stayed in power.

In 1987, Fianna Fáil returned to government, and Reynolds was appointed Minister for Industry and Commerce, one of the most senior positions in the cabinet, especially in a time when the government&#x27;s top priority was economic recovery as the Irish currency was highly overvalued which was compounded by years of unsustainable borrowing and taxation being as high as 60%. In 1988, the Minister for Finance Ray MacSharry became Ireland&#x27;s European Commissioner, and Reynolds succeeded MacSharry in the position.

== Coalition (1989–1992) ==
The 1989 general election resulted in Fianna Fáil taking the unprecedented move of entering into a coalition with the four-year-old free-market-centric Progressive Democrats (PD). Reynolds headed the Fianna Fáil negotiation team with another minister, Bertie Ahern. A programme for government was finally agreed upon almost a month after the general election, and Reynolds returned as Minister for Finance in a coalition government that he described as a &quot;temporary little arrangement&quot;.

The failure of Fianna Fáil candidate Brian Lenihan to be elected as President of Ireland added to the pressure on Haughey&#x27;s leadership. In a speech in County Cork, Reynolds announced that if a vacancy arose in the leadership, he would contest it—a clear and open revolt against Haughey&#x27;s leadership. Several TDs and senators, including some cabinet members, also began to grow disillusioned with Haughey, and they began to look for a successor. Reynolds was the most popular: his profile was enhanced by the so-called &quot;Country &amp; Western&quot; group of TDs (named so because they came from mostly rural counties, as well as Reynolds&#x27;s earlier fortune in the dance hall business) who began to agitate within the party on his behalf. In November 1991, a relatively unknown rural TD, Seán Power, put down a motion of no confidence in Haughey. Reynolds and a staunch supporter, Pádraig Flynn, announced their support for the motion, and Haughey promptly had them sacked from the cabinet. When the vote was taken, the party reaffirmed its support for Haughey by 55 votes to 22. It looked as though Reynolds&#x27;s political career was finished.

Haughey&#x27;s victory was short-lived, as a series of political errors would lead to his demise as Taoiseach. Controversy erupted over the attempted appointment of Jim McDaid as Minister for Defence, and McDaid resigned from the post before he was appointed. Worse was to follow when Seán Doherty, the man who as Minister for Justice had taken the blame for the phone tapping scandal of the early 1980s, went on television on RTÉ to reveal that Haughey had known about and authorised the phone tapping. Haughey denied all charges, but the PD government members stated that they could no longer continue in government with him as Taoiseach. Haughey told Desmond O&#x27;Malley, the PD leader, that he intended to resign shortly but wanted to choose his own time of departure. O&#x27;Malley agreed to this, and the government continued.

== Taoiseach (1992–1994) ==
=== 22nd government of Ireland (1992–1993) ===
On 30 January 1992, Haughey retired as leader of Fianna Fáil at a parliamentary party meeting. Reynolds easily defeated his rivals Mary O&#x27;Rourke and Michael Woods in the party leadership election and succeeded Haughey as Taoiseach on 11 February 1992.

The ministers who had been sacked along with Reynolds at the end of 1991 were all appointed to cabinet, while eight members of Haughey&#x27;s cabinet, including such long-serving Haughey loyalists as Ray Burke, Mary O&#x27;Rourke and Gerry Collins, were left out. Nine of the twelve junior ministers, many of whom were also Haughey supporters, were also dismissed. Reynolds promoted several long-time critics of Haughey, like David Andrews, Séamus Brennan and Charlie McCreevy, to senior ministerial positions. Reynolds also promoted younger TDs from rural constituencies, such as Noel Dempsey and Brian Cowen, to cabinet positions. One of Haughey&#x27;s oldest political allies, Bertie Ahern, remained Minister for Finance, agreeing with Reynolds not to challenge him for the leadership.

==== X Case ====

On Reynolds&#x27;s first day as Taoiseach, he had to deal with the &quot;X Case&quot;, a constitutional case on whether a 14-year-old who had become pregnant as a result of rape could access abortion. The Attorney General, Harry Whelehan, refused to allow the pregnant girl to travel to the United Kingdom for an abortion. The High Court granted the Attorney General&#x27;s injunction, while the Supreme Court found that abortion was permissible where there was a threat to a woman&#x27;s life from suicide. The case strained relations between the coalition parties. Reynolds tried to find a middle ground but alienated both the Catholic Church and those who sought abortion rights. Three amendments to the constitution on abortion were put to referendum. The wording of the constitutional change caused tensions between the two government parties. Still, the government remained intact as the amendments passed through the Oireachtas. They were held on the same date as the 1992 general election. The first proposal was defeated, which would have excluded the risk of suicide from circumstances where abortion was permissible, while proposals to allow travel outside the state and access to information were approved.

==== European Union ====
Reynolds negotiated considerable benefits for Ireland from the European Union regional aid budget in the aftermath of the Danish rejection of the Maastricht Treaty.

==== Beef Tribunal and 1992 election ====
A tribunal of enquiry into irregularities in the beef industry referred to as the &quot;Beef Tribunal&quot;, was established to examine the &quot;unhealthy&quot; relationship between Charles Haughey and beef baron Larry Goodman. This revealed to the public a substantial conflict of opinion between the two party leaders. At the tribunal, Desmond O&#x27;Malley severely criticised Reynolds, in his capacity as Minister for Industry and Commerce, for an export credit scheme. When Reynolds gave evidence, he referred to O&#x27;Malley as &quot;dishonest&quot;. This enraged the Progressive Democrats&#x27; leader; his party called a motion of no confidence, which resulted in the Progressive Democrats withdrawing from government and the collapse of the government. Reynolds then sought a dissolution of the Dáil from the president, Mary Robinson. A general election was then called.

=== 23rd government of Ireland (1993–1994) ===

The 1992 general election campaign was a disaster for Fianna Fáil with many seats lost in the wake of the scandal. The world was in recession, the Haughey era was a recent memory, and the Gulf War dominated international news, The fact that Reynolds seemed prepared to issue risky state-funded export insurance, effectively subsidising the Goodman business empire which now accounted for 12% of national GDP, when the country was in deep recession, shocked the electorate. Support for the party fell by 5%. The Labour Party under Dick Spring ran a campaign independent of its traditional coalition partner Fine Gael. It was Fianna Fáil&#x27;s worst election result since 1927, losing nine seats. Fine Gael lost ten seats, while the Labour Party had its best result, with 33 seats. In January 1993, Fianna Fáil and Labour formed a government with Reynolds as Taoiseach and Spring as Tánaiste.

==== Tensions with Labour ====

In 1993, Reynolds&#x27;s Minister of Finance, Bertie Ahern, issued a tax amnesty for people who had outstanding tax bills unpaid and undeclared, provided they made some declaration of their previous income. This created considerable media disquiet and provoked Spring to make a policy statement. On 9 June 1994, Fianna Fáil lost two seats in the Mayo West by-election and the Dublin South-Central by-election to the opposition Fine Gael and Democratic Left, placing Reynolds under pressure, as he could no longer depend on Spring to remain in government.

The report on the Beef Tribunal was published in July 1994. The Labour Party had threatened to leave the government if Reynolds was criticised. Reynolds was alleged to have juxtaposed and misquoted sections of the report in issuing a rebuttal before the report became public. Spring was furious that the report was not considered by the cabinet first.

==== Northern Ireland and foreign affairs ====
One of Reynolds&#x27;s main achievements during his term as Taoiseach was in the peace process in the long-running conflict in Northern Ireland. Piecemeal negotiations had gone on during 1993 between Reynolds and British prime minister John Major, resulting in the Anglo-Irish agreement of 1993; on 15 December, the Downing Street Declaration was signed in London. Reynolds remained involved in discussions with Northern Ireland&#x27;s nationalist parties and, along with John Hume, persuaded the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) to call a complete ceasefire on 31 August 1994. Major was quoted at the time as saying:
In September 1994, Reynolds was left standing on the tarmac at Shannon Airport by Russian president Boris Yeltsin, who failed to emerge from his plane to meet awaiting Irish dignitaries. Headlines around the world alleged that Yeltsin was too drunk to appear; a Russian official said that he was unwell and aides later suggested that he had had a heart attack. Yeltsin later announced that he had overslept.

==== Whelehan controversy and downfall ====

Reynolds had decided to reappoint Attorney General Harry Whelehan when the government was formed in 1992. When the position of President of the High Court became available, Reynolds proposed Whelehan. At this stage, allegations surfaced that Whelehan had been less than keen to prosecute a serial child abuser priest, Brendan Smyth, due to the implications that such an action concerned the accountability of certain prominent members of the Catholic hierarchy. It was later revealed that Whelehan, in his capacity as Attorney General (AG), had mishandled an attempt to extradite Smyth to Northern Ireland, where he was facing criminal charges. This was covered on the British television station Channel 4, which was seen across most of Ireland. RTÉ stood mute, while Irish newspapers were effectively talking around the issue for fear of action for libel.

Spring led his ministers out of a cabinet meeting to consider the position of the Labour Party. The coalition appeared to be finished, but Reynolds still held out for the chance to patch things up. Reynolds went before the Dáil and said that if he had known &quot;then&quot; what he &quot;knew now&quot; about the incompetent handling of the case by the AG&#x27;s office, he would not have appointed Whelehan to the judicial post.

However, Reynolds was damaged politically, appearing more interested in holding on to power than in the integrity of government actions. Spring decided he could not go back into government with Reynolds, and led the Labour Party out of the coalition on 16 November 1994.

==== Succession ====
It was apparent that Reynolds no longer had enough support to govern, so he resigned as Taoiseach on 17 November 1994.

On 19 November 1994, Reynolds resigned as party leader, and the Minister for Finance Bertie Ahern was unanimously elected the sixth leader of Fianna Fáil. Reynolds&#x27;s favoured successor, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, withdrew from the leadership contest on the morning of the vote. It initially appeared that Labour would rejoin the coalition with Fianna Fáil under Ahern, allowing Ahern to ascend to the position of Taoiseach. Instead, when it emerged that Ahern knew more about another case mishandled by Whelehan than previously known, Spring led Labour into successful coalition negotiations with Fine Gael and Democratic Left, and Fianna Fáil found themselves in opposition against a Rainbow Coalition. Reynolds remained acting Taoiseach until John Bruton took office on 15 December and then returned to the opposition backbenches.

== Post-Taoiseach period ==
On 4 February 1995, Reynolds was interviewed at length by Andrew Neil for his one-on-one interview show &quot;Is This Your Life?&quot;, made by Open Media for Channel 4.

At the beginning of 1997, Bertie Ahern allegedly encouraged Reynolds to run for office in the coming election and offered him the position of &quot;peace envoy&quot; to Northern Ireland and his support as a candidate for the presidency. Fianna Fáil won the election; however, Ahern allegedly reneged on this promise to Reynolds due to poor election results in his constituency and the change in the political situation in Northern Ireland. Reynolds was still interested in being a candidate for the presidency, along with two other Fianna Fáil candidates, Michael O&#x27;Kennedy and Mary McAleese. In a cabinet meeting, the Taoiseach (Ahern) gave a typically ambiguous speech which seemed to encourage his cabinet to support McAleese.

Reynolds won the first round of voting with a comfortable margin. Still, supporters of O&#x27;Kennedy backed McAleese, who was successful and became the Fianna Fáil nominee and the eighth president of Ireland.

Reynolds retired from politics at the 2002 general election, after 25 years as a TD; he was quoted in 2007 to state: &quot;I don&#x27;t bear any grudges over Ahern&quot;.

Reynolds was involved in a long-running libel action against British newspaper &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; over an article published in 1994, which alleged that Reynolds had deliberately and dishonestly misled the Dáil regarding matters in connection with the Brendan Smyth affair that brought down the coalition government. The newspaper claimed a defence of qualified privilege concerning these assertions based on their supposed benefit to the public, but a High Court jury found in favour of Reynolds in 1996. The jury recommended that no compensation be paid to the former Taoiseach. The judge subsequently awarded contemptuous damages of one penny in this action, leaving Reynolds with massive legal costs, estimated at £1 million. A subsequent court of appeal decision in 1998 declared that Reynolds had not received a fair hearing in his High Court action. The case continued to be heard in the House of Lords. This case led to the recognition under British law (and later introduction into Irish law as the &quot;defence of fair and reasonable publication&quot;) of the so-called Reynolds defence of qualified privilege for publishers against whom libel actions regarding defamatory comments made in media publications are being taken.

In 1999, General Pervez Musharraf became President of Pakistan following a military coup. At the time, the White House did not recognise governments that came to power through a coup d&#x27;état. Business associates asked Reynolds to travel to Pakistan and meet Musharraf.

Musharraf asked Reynolds to act as an advisor to him and to contact US president Bill Clinton to reassure the White House as to the intentions of the new government of Pakistan. Reynolds claimed in later interviews that because of the trust built with Musharraf, he would be asked to arrange peace talks between India and Pakistan. These talks started in early 2001 but were interrupted by the 9/11 attacks, after which Musharraf could not contact the White House. He called Reynolds, who called former president Clinton, who quickly reached his successor George W. Bush to communicate the Pakistani position.

=== Mahon Tribunal ===
In 1993, Reynolds and Bertie Ahern, then Minister for Finance, wrote to developer Owen O&#x27;Callaghan seeking a substantial donation. O&#x27;Callaghan was then heavily lobbying for state support for a stadium project at Neilstown, County Dublin. According to the report, O&#x27;Callaghan felt compelled to donate a sum of IR£80,000 to Fianna Fáil to get funding for the stadium. The Mahon Tribunal did not find the payment corrupt. However, the report noted that pressing a businessman to donate money when he was seeking support for a commercial project was &quot;entirely inappropriate, and was an abuse of political power and government authority&quot;.

In November 2007, it was alleged at the Mahon Tribunal that Reynolds, while on government business in New York, collected a substantial sum of money for his Fianna Fáil party that did not get fully credited to the party. On the same trip, it emerged in the tribunal that Reynolds had the government jet make an additional and unscheduled five-hour stopover in the Bahamas.

Reynolds received annual pension payments of €149,740.

In July 2008, it was reported that Reynolds was medically unfit to give evidence at the Mahon Tribunal because of &quot;significant cognitive impairment&quot;. Reynolds had on several previous occasions been due to give evidence concerning payments he allegedly received when he was Taoiseach.

== Illness and death ==
In December 2013, it was revealed by his son that Reynolds was in the last stages of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Reynolds died on 21 August 2014. The last politician to visit him was former British prime minister Sir John Major, a close friend of Reynolds. The serving Taoiseach, Enda Kenny of Fine Gael, said at the time: As Taoiseach he played an important part in bringing together differing strands of political opinion in Northern Ireland and as a consequence made an important contribution to the development of the peace process which eventually lead to the Good Friday Agreement.
The funeral was held at the Church of the Sacred Heart in Donnybrook, on 25 August 2014. It was attended by President Michael D. Higgins, Taoiseach Enda Kenny, former British prime minister John Major, former SDLP leader John Hume, Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams, Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers, former president Mary McAleese, former Taoisigh Liam Cosgrave, John Bruton, Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen, Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin and the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Christy Burke. Other guests included former ministers Charlie McCreevy, Padraig Flynn, Dermot Ahern and Noel Dempsey, fashion designer Louise Kennedy and racehorse owner J. P. McManus. An unexpected visitor from overseas was the frail but vigorous Jean Kennedy Smith, former US ambassador to Ireland, who was the last surviving sibling of John F. Kennedy.
Reynolds was buried at Shanganagh Cemetery with full military honours.

=== Legacy ===

His successor as Fianna Fáil leader, Bertie Ahern, who as Taoiseach was one of the negotiators of peace in Northern Ireland and had long been a political ally and friend, said on Reynolds&#x27;s death: 

The Archbishop of Dublin, who attended the service, commented on Reynolds&#x27;s determined character: 

Former Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader Brian Cowen expressed his sadness at the passing of their &quot;close personal friend&quot;.

Michael O&#x27;Leary, the chief executive officer of Ryanair, said:

<text>A snowball effect is a process that starts from an initial state of small significance and builds upon itself (an exacerbating feedback), becoming larger (graver, more serious), and also perhaps potentially more dangerous or disastrous (a vicious circle), though it might be beneficial instead (a virtuous circle). This is a cliché in cartoons and modern theatrics, and it is also used in psychology. 
The common analogy is with the rolling of a snowball down a snow-covered hillside. As it rolls the ball will pick up more snow, gaining more mass and surface area, and picking up even more snow and momentum as it rolls along.

In aerospace engineering, it is used to describe the multiplication effect in an original weight saving. A reduction in the weight of the fuselage will require less lift, meaning the wings can be smaller. Hence less thrust is required and therefore smaller engines, resulting in a greater weight saving than the original reduction. This iteration can be repeated several times, although the decrease in weight gives diminishing returns.

The startup process of a feedback electronic oscillator, when power to the circuit is switched on, is a technical application of the snowball effect. Electronic noise is amplified by the oscillator circuit and returned to its input filtered to contain primarily the selected (desired) frequency, gradually getting stronger in each cycle, until a steady-state oscillation is established, when the circuit parameters satisfy the Barkhausen stability criterion.

<text>Drum memory was a magnetic data storage device invented by Gustav Tauschek in 1932 in Austria. Drums were widely used in the 1950s and into the 1960s as computer memory.

Many early computers, called drum computers or drum machines, used drum memory as the main working memory of the computer. Some drums were also used as secondary storage as for example various IBM drum storage drives and the UNIVAC FASTRAND series of drums.

Drums were displaced as primary computer memory by magnetic core memory, which offered a better balance of size, speed, cost, reliability and potential for further improvements. Drums were then replaced by hard disk drives for secondary storage, which were both less expensive and offered denser storage. The manufacturing of drums ceased in the 1970s.

== Technical design ==
A drum memory or drum storage unit contained a large metal cylinder, coated on the outside surface with a ferromagnetic recording material. It could be considered the precursor to the hard disk drive (HDD), but in the form of a drum (cylinder) rather than a flat disk. In most designs, one or more rows of fixed read-write heads ran along the long axis of the drum, one for each track. The drum&#x27;s controller simply selected the proper head and waited for the data to appear under it as the drum turned (rotational latency). Not all drum units were designed with each track having its own head. Some, such as the English Electric DEUCE drum and the UNIVAC FASTRAND had multiple heads moving a short distance on the drum in contrast to modern HDDs, which have one head per platter surface.

In November 1953 Hagen published a paper disclosing &quot;air floating&quot; of magnetic heads in an experimental sheet metal drum. A US patent filed in January 1954 by Baumeister of IBM disclosed a &quot;spring loaded and air supported shoe for poising a magnetic head above a rapidly rotating magnetic drum.&quot; Flying heads became standard in drums and hard disk drives.

Magnetic drum units used as primary memory were addressed by word. Drum units used as secondary storage were addressed by block. Several modes of block addressing were possible, depending on the device.
*Blocks took up an entire track and were addressed by track.
*Tracks were divided into fixed length sectors and addressing was by track and sectors.
*Blocks were variable length, and blocks were addressed by track and record number.
*Blocks were variable length with a key, and could be searched by key content.
Some devices were divided into logical cylinders, and addressing by track was actually logical cylinder and track.

The performance of a drum with one head per track is comparable to that of a disk with one head per track and is determined almost entirely by the rotational latency, whereas in an HDD with moving heads its performance includes a rotational latency delay plus the time to position the head over the desired track (seek time). In the era when drums were used as main working memory, programmers often did optimum programming—the programmer—or the assembler, e.g., Symbolic Optimal Assembly Program (SOAP)—positioned code on the drum in such a way as to reduce the amount of time needed for the next instruction to rotate into place under the head. They did this by timing how long it would take after loading an instruction for the computer to be ready to read the next one, then placing that instruction on the drum so that it would arrive under a head just in time. This method of timing-compensation, called the &quot;skip factor&quot; or &quot;interleaving&quot;, was used for many years in storage memory controllers.

== History ==
Tauschek&#x27;s original drum memory (1932) had a capacity of about 500,000 bits (62.5 kilobytes).

One of the earliest functioning computers to employ drum memory was the Atanasoff–Berry computer (1942). It stored 3,000 bits; however, it employed capacitance rather than magnetism to store the information. The outer surface of the drum was lined with electrical contacts leading to capacitors contained within.

Magnetic drums were developed for the U.S. Navy by Engineering Research Associates (ERA) in 1946 and 1947. An experimental ERA study was completed and reported to the Navy on June 19, 1947. Other early drum storage device development occurred at Birkbeck College (University of London), Harvard University, IBM and the University of Manchester. An ERA drum was the internal memory for the ATLAS-I computer delivered to the U.S. Navy in October 1950 and later sold commercially as the ERA 1101 and UNIVAC 1101. Through mergers, ERA became a division of UNIVAC shipping the Series 1100 drum as a part of the UNIVAC File Computer in 1956; each drum stored 180,000 6-bit characters (135 kilobytes).
The first mass-produced computer, the IBM 650 (1954), initially had up to 2,000 10-digit words, about 17.5 kilobytes, of drum memory (later doubled to 4,000 words, about 35 kilobytes, in the Model 4).

In BSD Unix and its descendants, was the name of the default virtual memory (swap) device, deriving from the historical use of drum secondary-storage devices as backup storage for pages in virtual memory.

Magnetic drum memory units were used in the Minuteman ICBM launch control centers from the beginning in the early 1960s until the REACT upgrades in the mid-1990s.

<doc id="146965" wikidata="Q1780501" url="?curid=146965" title="Raffaello (confection)">
<text>Raffaello is a spherical coconut–almond truffle that Italian manufacturer Ferrero brought to the market in 1990. It consists of a spherical wafer which is filled with a white milk cream and white blanched almonds. It is then surrounded by a coconut layer. It does contain lactose, making Raffaello incompatible for consumers with lactose intolerance.

Ferrero factories which manufacture Raffaello include Vladimir, Russia; Brantford, Canada; and Arlon, Belgium. Russia is Ferrero&#x27;s largest market for Raffaello.

== History ==
In 2008, Belgian company Soremartec (part of the Ferrero Group) began legal action against Landrin, a Ukrainian company which began producing a sweet in 2007 similar to Raffaello, called Waferatto. Soremartec filed a claim on the grounds that Landrin had violated Soremartec&#x27;s trademark protecting the appearance of the Raffaello sweets. After a lengthy court battle, the High Commercial Court of Ukraine ruled in favor of Landrin, cancelling the validity of Soremartec&#x27;s trademark.

In 2017, a court in Frankfurt in Germany ruled that Ferrero would have to list the number of Raffaello sweets in each packet sold, rather than simply providing the weight.

<doc id="146969" wikidata="Q229545" url="?curid=146969" title="Raquel Welch">
<text>Jo Raquel Welch (; September 5, 1940 – February 15, 2023) was an American actress. Welch first gained attention for her role in &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; (1966), after which she signed a long-term contract with 20th Century Fox. They lent her contract to the British studio Hammer Film Productions, for whom she made &quot;One Million Years B.C.&quot; (1966). Although Welch had only three lines of dialogue in the film, images of her in the doe-skin bikini became bestselling posters that turned her into an international sex symbol. She later starred in &quot;Bedazzled&quot; (1967), &quot;Bandolero!&quot; (1968), &quot;100 Rifles&quot; (1969), &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot; (1970), &quot;Hannie Caulder&quot; (1971), &quot;Kansas City Bomber&quot; (1972), &quot;The Last of Sheila&quot; (1973), &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1973), &quot;The Wild Party&quot; (1975), and &quot;Mother, Jugs &amp; Speed&quot; (1976). She made several television variety specials.

Through her portrayal of strong female characters, helping her break the mold of the traditional sex symbol, Welch developed a unique film persona that made her an icon of the 1960s and 1970s. Her rise to stardom in the mid-1960s was partly credited with ending Hollywood&#x27;s vigorous promotion of the blonde bombshell. Her love scene with Jim Brown in &quot;100 Rifles&quot; also made cinematic history with their portrayal of interracial intimacy. She won a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Actress in a Musical or Comedy in 1974 for her performance as Constance Bonacieux in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and reprised the role in its sequel the following year. She was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Television Film for her performance in &quot;Right to Die&quot; (1987). Her final film was &quot;How to Be a Latin Lover&quot; (2017). In 1995, Welch was chosen by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine as one of the &quot;100 Sexiest Stars in Film History&quot;. &quot;Playboy&quot; ranked Welch No.3 on their &quot;100 Sexiest Stars of the Twentieth Century&quot; list.

== Early life ==

Welch was born Jo Raquel Tejada on September 5, 1940, in Chicago, Illinois, and moved to San Diego, California, at age two with her family. She was the first child of Josephine Sarah Hall and Armando Carlos Tejada Urquizo. Her mother was of English descent with ancestors tracing back to the Mayflower; she was the daughter of Clara Louise Adams and architect Emery Stanford Hall. Her father was an aeronautical engineer from La Paz, Bolivia, of Spanish descent; he was the son of Raquel Urquizo and Agustin Tejada. Her cousin, Bolivian politician Lidia Gueiler Tejada, became the first female president of Bolivia and the second female non-royal head of state in the Americas. Welch had a younger brother, James &quot;Jim,&quot; and a younger sister, Gayle.

Welch was raised in the Presbyterian religion and attended Pacific Beach Presbyterian Church every Sunday with her family. As a young girl, Welch had the desire to be a performer and entertainer. She began studying ballet at age seven, but after ten years of study, she left the art at seventeen when her instructor told her she did not have the right body type for professional ballet companies. At age 14, she won beauty titles as Miss Photogenic and Miss Contour. While attending La Jolla High School she won the title of Miss La Jolla and the title of Miss San Diegothe Fairest of the Fairat the San Diego County Fair. This long line of beauty contests eventually led to the state title of Maid of California. Her parents divorced when she finished her school years.

Welch graduated with honors from high school in 1958. Seeking an acting career, she entered San Diego State College on a theater arts scholarship, and the following year she married her high school sweetheart, James Welch. She assumed his last name and kept it throughout her life. She won several parts in local theater productions.

In 1960, Welch got a job as a weather presenter at KFMB, a local San Diego television station. Because her family life and television duties were so demanding, she decided to give up her drama classes. After her separation from James Welch, she moved with her two children to Dallas, Texas, where she made a &quot;precarious living&quot; as a model for Neiman Marcus and as a cocktail waitress.

== Career ==

=== 1964–1966: Early works and breakthrough ===

Welch initially intended to move to New York City from Dallas, but moved back to Los Angeles in 1963 and started applying for roles with film studios. During this period, she met a one-time child actor and Hollywood agent Patrick Curtis who became her personal and business manager. They developed a plan to turn Welch into a sex symbol. To avoid typecasting as a Latina, he convinced her to use her ex-husband&#x27;s surname. She was cast in small roles in two films, &quot;A House Is Not a Home&quot; (1964) and the musical &quot;Roustabout&quot; (1964), an Elvis Presley film. She also landed small roles on the television series &quot;Bewitched&quot;, &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; and &quot;The Virginian&quot; and appeared on the weekly variety series &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot; as a billboard girl and presenter. She was one of many actresses who auditioned for the role of Mary Ann Summers on the television series &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;.

Welch&#x27;s first featured role was in the beach film &quot;A Swingin&#x27; Summer&quot; (1965). That same year, she won the Deb Star while her photo in a &quot;Life&quot; magazine layout called &quot;The End of the Great Girl Drought!&quot; created a buzz around town. She was strongly considered for the role of Domino in &quot;Thunderball&quot; and was also noticed by the wife of producer Saul David, who recommended her to 20th Century Fox, where with the help of Curtis she landed a contract. She agreed to a seven-year nonexclusive contract, five pictures over the next five years, and two floaters. Studio executives talked about changing her name to &quot;Debbie&quot;. They thought &quot;Raquel&quot; would be hard to pronounce. She refused their request. She wanted her real name, so she stuck with &quot;Raquel Welch&quot;. After screen testing for Saul David&#x27;s &quot;Our Man Flint&quot;, she was cast in a leading role in David&#x27;s sci-fi film &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; (1966), in which she portrayed a member of a medical team that is miniaturized and injected into the body of an injured scientist with the mission to save his life. The film was a hit and made her a star.
Fox loaned Welch to Hammer Studios in Britain where she starred in the science fiction film &quot;One Million Years B.C.&quot; (1966), a remake of the Hal Roach film &quot;One Million B.C.&quot; (1940). Her only costume was a two-piece deer skin bikini. She was described as &quot;wearing mankind&#x27;s first bikini&quot; and the fur bikini was described as a &quot;definitive look of the 1960s&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; hailed her in its review of the film (which was released in the UK in 1966 and in the U.S. in 1967), &quot;a marvelous breathing monument to womankind&quot;. One author said, &quot;although she had only three lines in the film, her luscious figure in a fur bikini made her a star and the dream girl of millions of young moviegoers&quot;. A publicity still of her in the bikini became a bestselling poster and turned her into an instant pin-up girl. The film raised Welch&#x27;s stature as a leading sex symbol of the era. In 2011, &quot;Time&quot; magazine listed Welch&#x27;s &quot;B.C.&quot; bikini in the &quot;Top Ten Bikinis in Pop Culture&quot;.

In 1966, Welch starred with Marcello Mastroianni in the Italian crime film &quot;Shoot Loud, Louder... I Don&#x27;t Understand&quot; for Joseph E. Levine. The same year, she appeared in the film &quot;Sex Quartet&quot; as Elena in the segment &quot;Fata Elena&quot;. She was the only American in the cast of the anthology comedy film &quot;The Oldest Profession&quot; (1967); her segment was directed by Michael Pfleghar. In Italy, she also appeared in a heist film for MGM, &quot;The Biggest Bundle of Them All&quot; (1968). It co-starred Edward G. Robinson, who said of Welch, &quot;I must say she has quite a body. She has been the product of a good publicity campaign. I hope she lives up to it because a body will only take you so far.&quot;

=== 1967–1979: International stardom ===
Her first starring vehicle, the British Modesty Blaise-style spy film &quot;Fathom&quot; (1967), was filmed in Spain for 20th Century Fox. Second unit director Peter Medak said Welch &quot;was at that time quite inexperienced, exactly like one of those American drum majorettes. But she tried very hard and went to see the rushes each day, gradually improving. &#x27;Who&#x27;s this dumb broad?&#x27; people used to say. But I said: &#x27;You wait. I&#x27;ll bet she makes it.&#x27; I liked her very much because she was such a genuine person. And she had a beautiful body which always helps.&quot; Welch said her role was &quot;a blown up Barbie doll&quot;. Reviewing her performance, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; film critic said that &quot;each new Raquel Welch picture brings further proof that when Maria Montez died they didn&#x27;t break the mold. Like Maria, Raquel can&#x27;t act from here to there, but both ladies seem to have been born to be photographed ... this sappiest of spy pictures.&quot;

At this stage, Welch owed Fox four films, at one a year. She and Curtis also established their own production company, Curtwel. Fox wanted Welch to play Jennifer in their adaptation of &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; but she refused, wanting to play the role of Neely O&#x27;Hara. The studio was not interested, casting Patty Duke; Sharon Tate played Jennifer North.
In England, she appeared as Lust incarnate in the Peter Cook–Dudley Moore comedy, &quot;Bedazzled&quot; (1967), a Swinging Sixties retelling of the Faust legend. It was popular, as was the Western, &quot;Bandolero!&quot; (1968), which was shot in Del Rio, Texas, at the Alamo Village. She co-starred with James Stewart and Dean Martin. &quot;I think she&#x27;s going to stack up all right,&quot; Stewart said of Welch. &quot;No one is going to shout, &#x27;Wow it&#x27;s Anne Bancroft all over again&#x27;,&quot; said Welch of her performance, &quot;but at least I&#x27;m not Miss Sexpot running around half naked all the time.&quot;

In 1968, Welch appeared with Frank Sinatra in the detective film &quot;Lady in Cement&quot;, a sequel to the film &quot;Tony Rome&quot; (1967). She played the socialite Kit Forrest, the romantic interest of Tony Rome. Welch later said wittily that she caught the film from time to time and realized only later that Kit Forrest was an alcoholic: &quot;I&#x27;m watching this movie and I&#x27;m thinking, &#x27;What the hell has she got on?&#x27; At one point, I had this epiphany: &#x27;Oh, she&#x27;s an alcoholic!&#x27; I didn&#x27;t know that. How could I miss that?&quot; She reportedly was so smitten with Sinatra that she forgot to act: &quot;I think I was just so enamored with Frank Sinatra, you know. He&#x27;s hypnotic.&quot;

Welch starred as a freedom fighter leader in &quot;100 Rifles&quot;, a 1969 western directed by Tom Gries and filmed in Almería, Spain. It also starred Jim Brown, Burt Reynolds, and Fernando Lamas. The film provoked publicity and controversy at the time because it included a love scene between Welch and Brown that breached Hollywood&#x27;s taboo against onscreen interracial intimacy. The film is remembered for the spectacular &quot;Shower Scene&quot; in which Welch distracts the soldiers on the train by taking a shower at a water tower along the tracks. The director, Gries, tried hard to convince Welch to do the scene naked, but she refused. It was one of the many instances Welch resisted going nude on-screen and pushed back for years against producers who wanted her to act or pose nude. In 1969, Welch also starred in the thriller &quot;Flareup&quot; and had a supporting role in the dark comedy &quot;The Magic Christian&quot;.

Welch&#x27;s most controversial role came in &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot; (1970). She took the role of the film&#x27;s transsexual heroine in an attempt to be taken seriously as an actress. The production was characterized by animosity between Welch and Mae West, who walked out of the film for three days. The film was based on Gore Vidal&#x27;s controversial bestseller about a man who becomes a woman through surgery. The film&#x27;s producer Robert Fryer stated: &quot;If a man were going to become a woman, he would want to become the most beautiful woman in the world. He would become Raquel Welch&quot;.
Her looks and fame led &quot;Playboy&quot; to dub her the &quot;Most Desired Woman&quot; of the 1970s. Welch presented at the Academy Awards ceremony several times during the 1970s due to her popularity. She accepted the Best Supporting Actress Oscar on behalf of fellow actress Goldie Hawn when Hawn could not be there to accept it.

On April 26, 1970, CBS released her television special &quot;Raquel!&quot; On the day of the premiere, the show received a 51 percent share on the National ARB Ratings and an overnight New York Nielsen rating of 58 percent share. Also that year Welch starred in &quot;The Beloved&quot; with co-star Richard Johnson, which she co-produced and filmed in Cyprus.

In 1971, Welch had the title role in &quot;Hannie Caulder&quot;, a Western produced by Tigon and Curtwel, which was shot in Spain. Welch was one of the few actresses, and one of the earliest, who had a lead role in a Western film. &quot;Hannie Caulder&quot; was a significant influence on later revenge films, with director Quentin Tarantino citing it as an inspiration for his 2003 film, &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1.&quot;
The following year, in 1972, Welch starred in &quot;Kansas City Bomber&quot;, in which she played a hardened derby star and single mother who tries to balance her desire for a happy personal life and her dreams of stardom. &quot;Life&quot; magazine dubbed Welch the &quot;hottest thing on wheels&quot; for her role. The production of the film shut down for six weeks after Welch broke her wrist doing some of her own stunts. In the interim, she flew to Budapest and filmed a cameo in &quot;Bluebeard&quot; opposite Richard Burton, and was photographed at a lavish party thrown by Burton for his then-wife Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s fortieth birthday, even though Taylor had specifically uninvited her. Despite not being considered a critical success, &quot;Kansas City Bomber&quot; was noted for its depiction of gender relations in the early 1970s. In a 2012 interview with &quot;GQ&quot;, Welch reflected on the roller derby world depicted in the film: &quot;You have all those women out there, but the men in the front office are really running it. Which I thought was a really nice metaphor for the way a lot of women felt about their lives at that time.&quot; Also in 1972, Welch reunited with Burt Reynolds for the detective film &quot;Fuzz&quot;.

In 1973, Welch acted in two films: &quot;The Last of Sheila&quot; and &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. The latter – for which she won a Golden Globe as Best Actress in a Comedy – spawned a sequel, &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot; (1974). Welch was offered the title role in &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; (1974), which earned an Oscar for its eventual star Ellen Burstyn; she also turned down the chance to play Honey Bruce in the biographical film &quot;Lenny&quot; (1974), a part that went to Valerie Perrine. In 1975, Welch appeared in &quot;The Wild Party&quot; and also performed a duet with Cher, singing &quot;I&#x27;m a Woman&quot; on an episode of &quot;The Cher Show&quot;. She then co-starred with Bill Cosby and Harvey Keitel in the action comedy &quot;Mother, Jugs &amp; Speed&quot; (1976), directed by Peter Yates. Welch&#x27;s character, promoted from Dispatcher to Emergency Medical Technician after threatening a sexual discrimination lawsuit, is an early example of feminism and equal pay for equal work as she breaks the &quot;glass ceiling&quot; doing a &quot;man&#x27;s work&quot;.

In 1977, Welch acted in the French film &quot;Animal&quot;, co-starring with Jean-Paul Belmondo. She also starred in the British swashbuckling adventure &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;. Welch made a guest appearance on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; in 1978, where she sang &quot;I&#x27;m a Woman&quot; with Miss Piggy. The following year, Welch guest-starred as Captain Nirvana, an alien bounty hunter, in an episode of &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; titled &quot;Mork vs. the Necrotons&quot;.

=== 1980–2017: Subsequent projects and later years ===

==== Television ====

In 1982, Welch starred in the Western &quot;The Legend of Walks Far Woman&quot; for NBC. Billed as her &quot;first TV movie dramatic debut&quot;, Welch played a 19th-century Native American woman in Montana. In the summer of 1982, Welch was among the candidates considered for the role of Alexis Carrington on the ABC primetime drama &quot;Dynasty&quot;, along with Elizabeth Taylor and Sophia Loren, before the producers settled on Joan Collins.
In 1987, Welch starred in the television drama &quot;Right to Die&quot;, an &quot;unglamorous&quot; role in which she portrayed a college professor and mother of two stricken with Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease, and asks to die with dignity. 

Welch starred in the made-for-television films &quot;Scandal in a Small Town&quot; (1988), &quot;Trouble in Paradise&quot; (1989), and &quot;Torch Song&quot; (1993). In 1995, she was a guest star in &quot;Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;. In the Season 2 episode &quot;Top Copy&quot;, Welch played a television reporter and assassin who threatens to expose Clark&#x27;s identity as Superman.

In 1996, Welch joined the cast of the night-time soap opera &quot;Central Park West&quot;, after CBS had already slated it for cancellation, as creator Darren Star made a final attempt to save the show by boosting its ratings late in its first season. She was a guest star on the American comedy series &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot; (1997), playing Sabrina&#x27;s flamboyant Aunt Vesta from the realm called the Pleasuredome.

Welch acted in the Season 8 finale of the comedy series &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, titled &quot;The Summer of George&quot; (1997), playing an exaggerated and highly temperamental version of herself. In the episode, ranked by Zap2it as one of the top 10 episodes of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, series character Kramer is forced to fire Welch from the lead role in a fictional Tony Award-winning musical called &quot;Scarsdale Surprise&quot;, while the character Elaine gets into a &quot;catfight&quot; with her after a chance encounter on the street. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;By delivering a pitch-perfect performance as a fire-breathing prima donna, Welch also poked fun at her reputation (fairly earned or not) for being difficult to work with.&quot;
In 2002, Welch co-starred in the PBS series &quot;American Family&quot;, a story about a Mexican American family in East Los Angeles, with Edward James Olmos. Her role as Aunt Dora, the &quot;drama queen of the family&quot;, marked the first time in her 40-year career that Welch had acknowledged her heritage as a Latina.
In 2008, Welch appeared in &quot;Welcome to The Captain&quot; on CBS, playing a &quot;sultry actress&quot;; according to one critic, she was &quot;spoofing herself&quot;. She guest starred on &quot;&quot; in 2012 and played Aunt Lucia in the 2013 Lifetime original movie &quot;House of Versace&quot;. In 2015, she portrayed Miss Sally May Anderson in the television drama &quot;The Ultimate Legacy&quot;.

Welch played the mother-in-law of Barry Watson&#x27;s character in a Canadian sitcom titled &quot;Date My Dad&quot; (2017) where she reunited with Robert Wagner on screen, five decades after starring together in &quot;The Biggest Bundle of Them All&quot;.

==== Film ====

Welch was due to star in a 1982 adaptation of John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Cannery Row&quot;, but was abruptly fired by the producers a few weeks into production. The studio claimed she was not living up to her contract, by refusing early-morning rehearsals, and was replaced with Debra Winger. Welch sued MGM for breach of contract. Studio executives claimed in testimony the reason Welch was following through with the trial was that she was an actress over 40 and generally actresses in that age range cannot get roles any more. Welch&#x27;s evidence at trial proved there was a conspiracy to falsely blame her for the film&#x27;s budget problems and delays. The jury sided with Welch and she won a $10.8 million verdict against MGM in 1986.

Despite the win, Welch wished the whole episode never had happened. &quot;I just wanted to clear my reputation and get back to my work, my work in movies&quot;, she said. But she was blackballed by the industry and the incident affected her film career on the big screen from that moment on.

In 1994, Welch made a cameo appearance in &quot;Naked Gun : The Final Insult&quot;, in the scene where Leslie Nielsen&#x27;s character crashes the Academy Awards. In 2001, she had a cameo in the comedy film &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; with Reese Witherspoon, playing a wealthy ex-wife in court. Also that year, Welch appeared in &quot;Tortilla Soup&quot;, a family comedy-drama inspired by Ang Lee&#x27;s &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot;, playing Hortensia, a domineering mother determined to marry the master chef who thinks he is losing his sense of smell and taste.

Welch starred in &quot;Forget About It&quot; (2006), a mobster comedy in which Burt Reynolds, Robert Loggia, and Charles Durning competed for her affection. She played a single billionaire grandmother in the romantic comedy &quot;How to Be a Latin Lover&quot; (2017).

==== Stage ====

In December 1972, Welch made her nightclub debut at the Las Vegas Hilton; her act preceded Elvis Presley&#x27;s. Over the next decade, she took her nightclub act to other venues, and starred in television specials featuring her singing and dancing. She released the dance single &quot;This Girl&#x27;s Back In Town&quot;, which peaked at No. 29 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s dance club chart in 1988, along with a music video.

In December 1981, Welch starred on Broadway in &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; for two weeks, filling in for Lauren Bacall in the title role while Bacall was on vacation. Critics were so enthusiastic about Welch&#x27;s performance, she was invited back to perform the role again for six months in 1982.

In 1997, Welch starred on Broadway in &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot;, following Julie Andrews and Liza Minnelli in the title role. Theatre critic Jamie Portman wrote that her glamor made Welch &quot;scarcely believable as the vulnerable Victoria and totally unbelievable as the swaggering tuxedoed Victor&quot;, but that she at least &quot;earns high marks for valor&quot; for attempting to breathe life into &quot;the misbegotten musical version of &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot;&quot;.

== Achievements and awards ==

In 1975, Welch won a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Actress in a Musical or Comedy for &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. She was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for her performance in the television drama &quot;Right to Die&quot; (1987). In 1996, Welch received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard. In 2001, she was awarded the Imagen Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award for her positive promotion of Americans of Latin heritage throughout her career. In 2012, the Film Society of Lincoln Center presented a special retrospective of the films of Welch at the Walter Reade Theater.

== Beauty and business career ==

&quot;The Raquel Welch Total Beauty and Fitness Program&quot; book and videos were first released in 1984. The book, written by Welch with photographs by André Weinfeld, includes a hatha yoga fitness program, her views on healthy living and nutrition, as well as beauty and personal style. The Multi-Platinum collection of Fitness and Yoga videos were produced and directed by André Weinfeld. As a businesswoman, Welch succeeded with her signature line of wigs. She also began a jewelry and skincare line, although neither of those ventures compared to the success of her wig collection &quot;HAIRuWEAR&quot;.

In January 2007, Welch was selected as the newest face of MAC Cosmetics Beauty Icon series. Her line features several limited-edition makeup shades in glossy black and tiger-print packaging. The tiger print motif of the collection celebrates Welch&#x27;s feline and sensuous image: &quot;strong and wild, yet sultry and exotic&quot;.

Her personal beauty regime included abstinence from alcohol and tobacco; daily yoga; and moisturising with Bag Balm.

== Personal life ==

=== Marriages and relationships ===
Welch married her high school sweetheart, James Welch, in Las Vegas on May 8, 1959. They had two children, Damon (born November 6, 1959) and Tahnee (born December 26, 1961). The couple separated in 1962 and divorced in 1964; she retained Welch&#x27;s surname until her death in 2023.

She married publicist Patrick Curtis in Paris on February 14, 1967, and they divorced on January 6, 1972. Curtis later claimed to the tabloids that Welch got an abortion during their marriage. Spanish media reported that during the shooting of &quot;100 Rifles&quot; in Spain in 1968, Welch, while married to Curtis, had a relationship with Spanish actor Sancho Gracia, who had a small role in the film, and that Welch&#x27;s husband, upon finding out about the affair, chased Gracia at gunpoint through the hotel where they were staying in Aguadulce. Subsequent boyfriends included football player Joe Namath, producer Robert Evans and comedian Freddie Prinze.
On July 5, 1980, she married producer André Weinfeld in Cabo San Lucas. In early February 1983, while vacationing in Mustique, Welch suffered a miscarriage three months into her pregnancy. Her marriage to Weinfeld ended in August 1990.

In 1996, after keeping a low romantic profile for several years, she dated former British boxing champion Gary Stretch, who was younger than both of Welch&#x27;s children.

Welch wed Richie Palmer, co-owner of Mulberry Street Pizzeria, on July 17, 1999, at her home in Beverly Hills. Palmer, who had one son from a previous marriage, broke off his engagement with business partner and actress Cathy Moriarty to pursue Welch in October 1997. The pair separated in August 2003 and divorced a year later.

In 2011, Welch told &quot;Elle&quot; magazine she would not remarry. Her last relationship of record, during the early-to-mid-2010s, was with &quot;American Idol&quot; producer Nigel Lythgoe.

=== Religion ===

Welch was Presbyterian, the religion of her childhood, and had said, &quot;I remembered the wonderful sense of peace I&#x27;d felt when sitting under the protection and grace of my mother&#x27;s faith.&quot; She was a faithful member of Calvary Presbyterian Church in Glendale, which she described as a &quot;beautiful little church&quot; where the people &quot;weren&#x27;t Hollywood types. They were modest, unassuming, cheerful and friendly. They welcomed me.&quot; Welch&#x27;s faith helped her after the death of her mother, a devout Presbyterian, and her sister&#x27;s recovery from cancer.

=== Public image ===

While her image in the 1960s was that of a torrid sex temptress, Welch&#x27;s private life was quite different. Welch once famously said, &quot;What I do on the screen is not to be equated with what I do in my private life. Privately, I am understated and dislike any hoopla.&quot; She also admitted, &quot;I was not brought up to be a sex symbol, nor is it in my nature to be one. The fact that I became one is probably the loveliest, most glamorous, and fortunate misunderstanding.&quot;

Welch posed for &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1979, but she never did a fully nude shoot. Hugh Hefner later wrote, &quot;Raquel Welch, one of the last of the classic sex symbols, came from the era when you could be considered the sexiest woman in the world without taking your clothes off. She declined to do complete nudity, and I yielded gracefully. The pictures prove her point.&quot; Welch refused to take all her clothes off on screen or pose naked throughout her career spanning five decades, saying this was the way she was brought up.

=== Political views ===

In 2014, during an appearance on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, Welch described herself as being on the conservative side, attributing it to her upbringing and mother&#x27;s Midwestern values. In 2015 Welch attended a gathering for the Republican Jewish Coalition in Beverly Hills. Welch supported the Vietnam War troops, appearing at United Service Organizations (USO) shows, often with Bob Hope.

== Death ==
Welch died from cardiac arrest on February 15, 2023, at her home in Los Angeles. She was 82. At the time of her death, Welch was also suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

== Legacy ==

Welch helped transform America&#x27;s feminine ideal into its current state. Her beautiful looks and eroticism made her the definitive 1960s and 1970s sex icon, rather than the blonde bombshell of the late 1950s as typified by Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield, and others. Welch became a star in the mid-1960s and was exotic, brunette, and smolderingly sexual. Her countless publicity photos helped to popularize her image, dress style, and 1960s and 1970s fashion trends. Welch and other actresses also made big hair popular.

==In popular culture==

Welch is mentioned in the 1970 song &quot;Raquel Welch&quot; by Shel Silverstein and in the 1971 song, &quot;One&#x27;s on the Way&quot; also written by Silverstein but made popular by Loretta Lynn. Welch is also mentioned in &quot;Unknown Stuntman&quot;, the theme song to &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;, starring Lee Majors, who also recorded the song. She is also mentioned in the Al Jarreau song &quot;Love Is Real&quot; from the Grammy-winning 1980 album &quot;This Time&quot;, where Jarreau sings &quot;Raquel and Redford are the tops&quot;.

In the 1994 film &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, the poster that Andy Dufresne had on his prison cell wall at the time of his escape was the famous pinup image of Welch in &quot;One Million Years B.C.&quot;.

<doc id="146971" wikidata="Q1544592" url="?curid=146971" title="Green Goddess">
<text>The Green Goddess is the colloquial name for the RLHZ Self Propelled Pump manufactured by Bedford Vehicles, a fire engine used originally by the Auxiliary Fire Service (AFS), and latterly held in reserve by the Home Office until 2004, and available when required to deal with exceptional events, including being operated by the British Armed Forces during fire-fighters’ strikes (1977 and 2002). These green-painted vehicles were built between 1953 and 1956 for the AFS. The design was based on a Bedford RL series British military truck.

==Auxiliary Fire Service==
The Auxiliary Fire Service was established as part of civil defence preparations after World War II, and subsequent events such as the Soviet Union detonating an atomic bomb made their presence supporting civilians as part of Britain&#x27;s civil defence an important role. It was thought that a nuclear attack on Britain would cause a large number of fires, which would overwhelm the ordinary fire service, so a large stock of basic fire engines was ordered to form a reserve capacity. They were in continuous use by the AFS, until disbandment in 1968 by the Harold Wilson Government.

The Green Goddess machines were not primarily fire engines (AFS members referred to them as &quot;appliances&quot;); they are more correctly titled &quot;self-propelled pumps&quot;, with some being two-wheel drive (4×2), and others in four-wheel drive (4×4) form. Their main role was to pump huge quantities of water from lakes, rivers, canals and other sources into cities hit by a nuclear attack. The machines could be used in a relay system over a number of miles, with Green Goddesses at regular intervals to boost the water pressure. Firefighting was a secondary role.

==Operational use==

Prior to disbandment, the AFS used the Green Goddess extensively in support of the local fire services throughout the UK. They provided additional water delivery and firefighting capability at times when the regular fire brigades had a major incident to contain. The ability to relay large quantities of water over considerable distances was invaluable in some more remote locations, or where the incident required more water than local water systems could provide. Most UK boroughs had an Auxiliary Fire Service detachment housed alongside the regular brigade equipment.

After 1968, the vehicles were mothballed, but occasionally used by the Armed Forces to provide fire cover in a number of fire strikes, notably in 1977 and 2002 (see 2002-2003 UK firefighter dispute). They were also deployed to pump water in floods and droughts. They were well maintained in storage, and regularly road tested. There was a less significant strike by firefighters in the Winter of Discontent (late 1978 and early 1979), where once again the Green Goddesses were drafted in to cover; it is largely forgotten by many as it occurred at a time when a significant percentage of public sector workers were on strike.

The role of Green Goddesses was superseded by new contingency arrangements. The Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 gave the government the power to instruct fire and rescue authorities to make their own vehicles available in the event of future industrial action. New Incident Response Units introduced after the September 11, 2001 attacks offered high-power pumping ability among a range of other contingency functions.

==Use in Ireland==
35 units were bought by Irish Auxiliary Fire Service and allocated to corporation and county council fire services. 25 were bought new in 1961–1964 and ten more ex-British Government vehicles were bought second hand in 1971. Two more ex-British units were purchased by Dublin Civil Defence in 2005.

==Use in Uruguay, South America==
One unit has been put into operation due to the forest fires of the Uruguayan southern summer 2023, and works daily on the east coast, specifically in the Volunteer Fire Department, in the José Ignacio Spa.
In 2008, the United Kingdom donated for second time, units to the National Directorate of Firefighters of Uruguay to fight Forest Fires.

==Disposal==
In March 2004, the British Government announced that it was conducting a test sale of forty of its remaining fleet of more than nine hundred vehicles, and that it was planning to dispose of the remainder. The sale of the fleet was completed, and most of the vehicles were sold to fire brigades in developing countries, mostly in Africa. Some were donated to museums, including the prototype which was placed in the Museum of RAF Firefighting. Others are in the National Emergency Services Museum, Military Museum Scotland, National Museum of Scotland, Kent Firefighting Museum, Leicester Fire Brigade Museum, Yorkshire Air Museum and Montrose Air Station Heritage Centre. Some were purchased by vehicle restoration trusts and some are privately owned.

==Technical specifications==
Unlike modern engines they have no radio, no cutting equipment, no power steering and only a single ladder, and were relatively slow with a maximum speed of around , a comfortable cruising speed of , and they were sensitive on corners. But one advantage that some Green Goddesses enjoyed over most modern fire appliances was their four-wheel drive. Fuel consumption was between , depending on driving style and quantity of water carried. They also have less water capacity at in 4×2 form – on 4×4 versions – than a modern vehicle, and poorer stability due to a lack of baffle partitions in the water tank.

Some were later modified by the installation of flashing blue lamps and two-tone warning sirens, and alterations to the rear lamps, to bring them into line with then current practice on &quot;regular&quot; emergency appliances. Mechanically, they were designed to be robust and easy to maintain.

The Green Goddess carried a range of equipment from standard hose and branches, through a selection of nozzles to provide different flows and jet patterns, to Light Portable Pumps and Ceiling Arresters. They all carried a extension ladder, together with at least one scaling ladder. Some carried additional equipment, such as hook ladders, radios, large bolt cutters, etc.

===Pumps===
The Sigmund F.N.5 main pump has a capacity of per minute ( on 4×4 versions). Normal fire hoses could be used either from the main pump, which had four outlets, or from normal fire hydrants for which an assortment of connecting branches were carried. In addition, the machines carried a small Coventry Climax pump, with its own petrol engine, which could also draw water from a river or other source, again feeding normal fire hoses, and which provided a separate and self-contained fire fighting capability. A water tank ( on 4×4) was installed, which fed small diameter hoses on each side of the vehicle to give an immediate &quot;first aid&quot; capacity to fight a fire while the main hoses were connected and brought into use. A stirrup pump was also carried, together with a full range of other suitable tools and equipment.

===Crew===
The vehicles were normally crewed by an officer in charge, who sat in the front passenger seat, a driver/pump operator, and four fire fighters seated on the crew bench.
In the mid 1960s, some Territorial artillery regiments were earmarked for a water pumping role, partly because the six man gun crew matched the numbers on the pump units. Training methods and rotation of roles were common factors in gunnery and water pumping.
Artillery regiments undertook a two-week course at Devizes in lieu of their normal annual gunnery training camp.

<text>Croatia Airlines Ltd. is the flag carrier of Croatia. Its headquarters are in Buzin near Zagreb, the capital, and operates domestic and international services mainly to European destinations. Its main hub is Zagreb International Airport with focus cities being Dubrovnik, Split, and Zadar. Since November 2004, the airline has been a member of Star Alliance.

== History ==
===Early years===


The airline was established in June 1991 with no planes and already with poor economic prospects. Later in 1991, Croatia Airlines signed an agreement with Adria Airways which allowed it to lease a McDonnell Douglas MD-82 to commence domestic jet services between Zagreb and Split. Croatia Airlines acquired three Boeing 737s from Lufthansa and became a member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA). As the flag carrier of newly independent Croatia, the airline launched its first international service on 5 April 1992, from Zagreb to Frankfurt.

In 1993, two new ATR 42s and two more 737s joined the fleet and representative offices were opened in several European cities and the company bought the travel agency Obzor to organize travel packages for groups and individuals. By 1994, Croatia Airlines had welcomed its millionth passenger. Later that year, Pope John Paul II flew the airline on a trip to Croatia.

In 1995, another ATR 42 was welcomed, as was the two millionth passenger. In 1996, Croatia Airlines became the first airline to fly to Sarajevo after the Bosnian War. In 1997, the airline&#x27;s first Airbus A320 arrived and was named &quot;Rijeka&quot;. In 1998, another first plane of a new type arrived when the airline&#x27;s first Airbus A319 joined the fleet. This airplane was named &quot;Zadar&quot;. In the same year, Croatia Airlines became a member of the Association of European Airlines (AEA). By 1999, two more Airbus jets had arrived and Croatia Airlines started selling the Boeing part of their fleet. The airline flew its five millionth passenger.

===Development since 2000===
In 2000, two more Airbus planes arrived and an automated ticketing system was inaugurated. In 2001, the airline received maintenance and technical performing certificates from the German aviation authority Luftfahrt-Bundesamt. On 18 November 2004, Croatia Airlines joined Star Alliance.

Airbus and Croatia Airlines announced on 22 October 2008 the order of four additional 132-seat A319 aircraft, to be delivered from 2013. By March 2009, the airline also retired its fleet of three ATR 42 short-haul aircraft, after operating the type since 1993, and replaced it with a fleet of six Bombardier Dash 8 Q400s, the first of which was delivered in May 2008.

The airline carried its 20,000,000th passenger in July 2009, and has carried well over 1 million passengers annually from 2000.

Croatia Airlines and maintenance partner Lufthansa announced on 23 May 2011 the introduction of new slim-line Recaro economy seats to be retrofitted into certain A320 Family aircraft from summer 2012, increasing seating capacity by two rows.

Losses have been made for several years; in November 2012, the government announced that it would provide HRK 800m ($ 136m) for Croatia Airlines to become cost-effective from 2013 on. The government is seeking to restructure the airline, which includes plans to cut its workforce by ten percent within two years and it is also looking for a strategic investor.

In February 2020, Croatia Airlines announced two new seasonal flights to Podgorica and Sofia operated by Bombardier Dash 8 Q400.

In April 2024, Croatia Airlines concluded an agreement on the lease of an Airbus A319 aircraft with the Croatian airline Fly Air41, which is otherwise a sister company to SundAir.

=== Renewal of the fleet ===
In October 2022, Croatia Airlines announced plans to reduce their fleet and replace all current aircraft with six new Airbus A220-300 by 2026. The airline decided against the competing Embraer E2 as it was able to use downpayments for a former and since cancelled order for Airbus A319s nearly 15 years ago. In November 2022, it has been stated that the airline will operate up to 15 A220 with 9 additional aircraft to be leased. In January 2023, a lease was agreed for the first six aircraft of four A220-300 aircraft and two A220-100 aircraft. The lease was concluded with Air Lease Corporation Clover based in the Republic of Ireland as the lessor.

In September 2023, Croatia Airlines sold and leased back its entire Airbus fleet from lessor World Star Aviation. Four Airbus A319 and one Airbus A320 were sold prior to the Airbus A220 delivery. In November 2023, Croatia Airlines has started retiring aircraft prior to its first Airbus A220 deliveries with the first aircraft to leave the fleet being an Airbus A319-100. The arrival of the first aircraft was confirmed for July 2024, while the second new A220 was expected at the end of the same year. The following six aircraft would be delivered in 2025, then four in 2026, and the last three in 2027. On 30 July 2024, first airplane named Zagreb, landed on Zagreb Airport. Second airplane arrived on 20 December 2024 and it was named Split.

<text>8VSB is the modulation method used for broadcast in the ATSC digital television standard. ATSC and 8VSB modulation is used primarily in North America; in contrast, the DVB-T standard uses COFDM.

A modulation method specifies how the radio signal fluctuates to convey information. ATSC and DVB-T specify the modulation used for over-the-air digital television; by comparison, QAM is the modulation method used for cable. The specifications for a cable-ready television, then, might state that it supports 8VSB (for broadcast TV) and QAM (for cable TV).

8VSB is an 8-level vestigial sideband modulation. In essence, it converts a binary stream into an octal representation by amplitude-shift keying a sinusoidal carrier to one of eight levels. 8VSB is capable of transmitting three bits (23=8) per symbol; in ATSC, each symbol includes two bits from the MPEG transport stream which are trellis modulated to produce a three-bit figure. The resulting signal is then band-pass filtered with a Nyquist filter to remove redundancies in the side lobes, and then shifted up to the broadcast frequency.

==Modulation technique==
Vestigial sideband modulation (VSB) is a modulation method which attempts to eliminate the spectral redundancy of pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) signals. Modulating a carrier by a real-valued data sequence results in a sum and a difference frequency, resulting in two symmetrical carrier side-bands. The symmetry means that one of the sidebands is redundant, so removing one sideband still allows for demodulation. As filters with zero transition bandwidth cannot be realized, the filtering implemented leaves a vestige of the redundant sideband, hence the name &quot;VSB&quot;.

==Throughput==
In the 6 MHz (megahertz) channel used for broadcast ATSC, 8VSB carries a symbol rate of 10.76 megabaud, a gross bit rate of 32 Mbit/s, and a net bit rate of 19.39 Mbit/s of usable data. The net bit rate is lower due to the addition of forward error correction codes. The eight signal levels are selected with the use of a trellis encoder. There are also similar modulations 2VSB, 4VSB, and 16VSB. 16VSB was notably intended to be used for ATSC digital cable, but quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) has become the &quot;de facto&quot; industry standard instead as it is cheap and readily available.

==Power saving advantages==

A significant advantage of 8VSB for broadcasters is that it requires much less power to cover an area comparable to that of the earlier NTSC system, and it is reportedly better at this than the most common alternative system, COFDM. Part of the advantage is the lower peak to average power ratio needed compared to COFDM. An 8VSB transmitter needs to have a peak power capability of 6 dB (four times) its average power. 8VSB is also more resistant to impulse noise. Some stations can cover the same area while transmitting at an effective radiated power of approximately 25% of analog broadcast power. While NTSC and most other analog television systems also use a vestigial sideband technique, the unwanted sideband is filtered much more effectively in ATSC 8VSB transmissions. 8VSB uses a Nyquist filter to achieve this. Reed–Solomon error correction is the primary system used to retain data integrity.

In summer of 2005, the ATSC published standards for Enhanced VSB, or E-VSB . Using forward error correction, the E-VSB standard will allow DTV reception on low power handheld receivers with smaller antennas in much the same way DVB-H does in Europe, but still using 8VSB transmission.

==Disputes over ATSC&#x27;s use==
For some period of time, there had been a continuing lobby for changing the modulation for ATSC to COFDM, the way DVB-T is transmitted in Europe, and ISDB-T in Japan. However, the FCC has always held that 8VSB is the better modulation for use in U.S. digital television broadcasting. In a 1999 report, the Commission found that 8VSB has better threshold or carrier-to-noise (C/N) performance, has a higher data rate capability, requires less transmitter power for equivalent coverage, and is more robust to impulse and phase noise. As a result, it denied in 2000 a petition for rulemaking from Sinclair Broadcast Group requesting that broadcasters be allowed to choose between 8VSB or COFDM as is most appropriate for their area of coverage.
The FCC report also acknowledged that COFDM would &quot;generally be expected to perform better in situations where there is dynamic multipath,&quot; such as mobile operation or in the presence of trees that are moving in high winds. However, with the introduction of 5th Generation demodulators in 2005 and subsequent improvements in generations 6 and 7, the equalization span is now about −60 to +75 microseconds (a 135 microsecond spread) and has virtually eliminated multipath, both static and dynamic, in 8VSB reception. In comparison, the equalization span in COFDM is −100 to +100 microseconds (200 microsecond spread), but the application of this much guard band space for COFDM substantially reduces its useful payload. In fact, much of Europe has adopted 1280×720p as its HD standard for DVB-T1 because of its reduced payload capacity. The introduction of DVB-T2 is meant to increase the ability of terrestrial transmissions to carry 1920×1080p content. 1920×1080i has always been part of the 8VSB scheme from its inception, and its improved demodulators have had no effect on its innate payload capacity.

Because of continued adoption of the 8VSB-based ATSC standard in the U.S., and a large growing ATSC receiver population, a switch to COFDM will be challenging. Most analog terrestrial transmissions in the US were turned off in June 2009, and 8VSB tuners are common to all new TVs, further complicating a future transition to COFDM.

However, with the development of ATSC 3.0, an updated version of the American digital television standard designed for mobile reception and better single frequency network performance, the ATSC has decided to make the switch to OFDM with LDPC error correction (essentially COFDM). As a result, ATSC 3.0 will be incompatible with all current ATSC 1.0 receivers, and viewers will need a new TV with a compatible tuner or a converter box. Unlike the previous digital TV transition which was mandated by the FCC, the &quot;transition&quot; to ATSC 3.0 will be completely voluntary. Additionally, the FCC has required that broadcasters who decided to make the switch to ATSC 3.0 continue to make their main channel available through a simulcast agreement with another in-market station (with a similar coverage area) through at least 2022. Sinclair announced an intention to bring ATSC 3.0 to 40 cities by 2020.

== 8VSB vs COFDM ==
The previously cited FCC Report also found that COFDM has better performance in dynamic and high level static multipath situations, and offers advantages for single frequency networks and mobile reception. Nonetheless, in 2001, a technical report compiled by the COFDM Technical Group concluded that COFDM did not offer any significant advantages over 8VSB. The report recommended in conclusion that receivers be linked to outdoor antennas raised to roughly 30 feet (9 m) in height. Neither 8VSB nor COFDM performed acceptably in most indoor test installations.

However, there were questions whether the COFDM receiver selected for these tests − a transmitter monitor lacking normal front end filtering − colored these results. Retests that were performed using the same COFDM receivers with the addition of a front end band pass filter gave much improved results for the DVB-T receiver, but further testing was not pursued.

The debate over 8VSB versus COFDM modulation is still ongoing. Proponents of COFDM argue that it resists multipath far better than 8VSB. This is important property of the modulation for receiving HDTV in e.g. moving vehicles that is not possible with 8VSB. Early 8VSB DTV (digital television) receivers often had difficulty receiving a signal in urban environments. Newer 8VSB receivers, however, are better at dealing with multipath, but a moving receiver can still not receive the signal. Moreover, 8VSB modulation requires less power to transmit a signal the same distance. In less populated areas, 8VSB may outperform COFDM because of this. However, in some urban areas, as well as for mobile use, COFDM may offer better reception than 8VSB. Several &quot;enhanced&quot; VSB systems were in development, most notably E-VSB, A-VSB, and MPH. The deficiencies in 8VSB in regards to multipath reception can be dealt with by using additional forward error-correcting codes which decreases the useful bit rate, such as that used by ATSC-M/H for Mobile/Handheld reception. ATSC 3.0, the next major television standard in the United States, will use COFDM.

The vast majority of U.S. TV stations use COFDM for their studio to transmitter links and news gathering operations. These are point-to-point communication links and not broadcast transmissions.

<text>Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) is a set of international open standards for digital television. DVB standards are maintained by the DVB Project, an international industry consortium, and are published by a Joint Technical Committee (JTC) of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) and European Broadcasting Union (EBU).

==Transmission==
DVB systems distribute data using a variety of approaches, including:
* Satellite: DVB-S, DVB-DSNG, DVB-S2, DVB-S2X and DVB-SH
** DVB-SMATV for distribution via SMATV
* Cable: DVB-C, DVB-C2
* Terrestrial television: DVB-T, DVB-T2
** Digital terrestrial television for handhelds: DVB-H, DVB-SH
* Microwave: using DTT (DVB-MT), the MMDS (DVB-MC), and/or MVDS standards (DVB-MS)

These standards define the physical layer and data link layer of the distribution system. Devices interact with the physical layer via a synchronous parallel interface (SPI), synchronous serial interface (SSI) or asynchronous serial interface (ASI). All data is transmitted in MPEG transport streams with some additional constraints (DVB-MPEG). A standard for temporally-compressed distribution to mobile devices (DVB-H) was published in November 2004.

These distribution systems differ mainly in the modulation schemes used and error correcting codes used, due to the different technical constraints. DVB-S (SHF) uses QPSK, 8-PSK or 16-QAM. DVB-S2 uses QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-APSK or 32-APSK, at the broadcasters decision. QPSK and 8-PSK are the only versions regularly used. DVB-C (VHF/UHF) uses QAM: 16-QAM, 32-QAM, 64-QAM, 128-QAM or 256-QAM. Lastly, DVB-T (VHF/UHF) uses 16-QAM or 64-QAM (or QPSK) in combination with (C)OFDM and can support hierarchical modulation.

The DVB-T2 specification was approved by the DVB Steering Board in June 2008 and sent to ETSI for adoption as a formal standard. ETSI adopted the standard on 9 September 2009. The DVB-T2 standard gives more robust TV reception and increases the possible bit rate by over 30% for single transmitters (as in the UK) and will increase the maximum bit rate by over 50% in large single-frequency networks (as in Germany and Sweden).

DVB has established a 3D TV group (CM-3DTV) to identify &quot;what kind of 3D-TV solution does the market want and need, and how can DVB play an active part in the creation of that solution?&quot; The CM-3DTV group held a DVB 3D-TV Kick-off Workshop in Geneva on 25 January 2010, followed by the first CM-3DTV meeting the next day. DVB now defines a new standard for 3D video broadcast: DVB 3D-TV.

Modes and features of latest DVB-x2 system standards in comparison:
==Content==

Digital video content is encoded using discrete cosine transform (DCT) based video coding standards, such as the H.26x and MPEG formats. Digital audio content is encoded using modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) based audio coding standards, such as Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), Dolby Digital (AC-3) and MP3.

Besides digital audio and digital video transmission, DVB also defines data connections (DVB-DATA - EN 301 192) with return channels (DVB-RC) for several media (DECT, GSM, PSTN/ISDN, satellite etc.) and protocols (DVB-IPTV: Internet Protocol; DVB-NPI: network protocol independent).

Older technologies such as teletext (DVB-TXT) and vertical blanking interval data (DVB-VBI) are also supported by the standards to ease conversion. However, for many applications more advanced alternatives like DVB-SUB for subtitling are available.

==Encryption and metadata==
The conditional access system (DVB-CA) defines a Common Scrambling Algorithm (DVB-CSA) and a physical Common Interface (DVB-CI) for accessing scrambled content. DVB-CA providers develop their wholly proprietary conditional access systems with reference to these specifications. Multiple simultaneous CA systems can be assigned to a scrambled DVB program stream providing operational and commercial flexibility for the service provider.

The DVB Project developed a Content Protection and Copy Management system for protecting content after it has been received (DVB-CPCM), which was intended to allow flexible use of recorded content on a home network or beyond, while preventing unconstrained sharing on the Internet. DVB-CPCM was the source of much controversy in the popular press and it was said that CPCM was the DVB Project&#x27;s answer to the failed American Broadcast Flag. The DVB-CPCM specifications, which were standardized by ETSI as a multipart document (TS 102 825) between 2008 and 2013, were deprecated by the DVB Steering Board in February 2019.

DVB transports include metadata called Service Information (DVB-SI, ETSI EN 300 468, ETSI TR 101 211) that links the various elementary streams into coherent programs and provides human-readable descriptions for electronic program guides as well as for automatic searching and filtering. The dating system used with this metadata suffers from a year 2038 problem in which due to the limited 16 bits and modified Julian day offset used will cause an overflow issue similar to the year 2000 problem. By comparison, the rival DigiCipher 2 based ATSC system will not have this issue until 2048 due in part to 32 bits being used.

DVB adopted a profile of the metadata defined by the TV-Anytime Forum (DVB-TVA, ETSI TS 102323). This is an XML Schema based technology and the DVB profile is tailored for enhanced Personal Digital Recorders. 

In the early 2000s, DVB started an activity to develop specifications for IPTV (DVB-IPI, ETSI TR 102 033, ETSI TS 102 034, ETSI TS 102 814), which also included metadata definitions for a broadband content guide (DVB-BCG, ETSI TS 102 539).

=== DVB-I ===

In October 2017, the DVB Project established a working group to begin the definition of a specification for &quot;standalone TV services over IP, referred to as DVB-I services&quot;. Work on the commercial requirements for DVB-I began in January 2018 and the terms of reference were agreed in March 2018.

The DVB-I specification, titled &quot;Service Discovery and Programme Metadata for DVB-I&quot;, was approved by the DVB Project in November 2019
 and first published as DVB BlueBook A177 in June 2020 and as an ETSI standard TS 103 770 in November 2020.

The DVB-I specification defines ways in which devices and displays connected to the internet can discover and access sets of audiovisual media services. These can include services delivered online through fixed and wireless Internet Protocol connections as well as broadcast radio and television channels received over radio frequency networks using traditional cable, satellite, or terrestrial transmissions.

Tests and pilots of DVB-I services have been undertaken in several countries including Iran, Germany, Italy, Spain and Ireland.

==Software platform==
The DVB Multimedia Home Platform (DVB-MHP) defines a Java-based platform for the development of consumer video system applications. In addition to providing abstractions for many DVB and MPEG-2 concepts, it provides interfaces for other features like network card control, application download, and layered graphics.

==Return channel==
DVB has standardized a number of return channels that work together with DVB(-S/T/C) to create bi-directional communication. RCS is short for Return Channel Satellite, and specifies return channels in C, Ku and Ka frequency bands with return bandwidth of up to 2 Mbit/s. DVB-RCT is short for Return Channel Terrestrial, specified by ETSI EN 301958.

==Service discovery==

The DVB-I standard (ETSI TS 103 770) defines an internet-based request and response mechanism to discover and access audiovisual services delivered over traditional digital broadcast transmissions or Internet Protocol networks and present them in a unified way.

==Adoption==

DVB-S and DVB-C were ratified in 1994. DVB-T was ratified in early 1997. The first commercial DVB-T broadcasts were performed by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Digital TV Group in late 1998. In 2003 Berlin, Germany was the first area to completely stop broadcasting analogue TV signals. Most European countries are fully covered by digital television and many have switched off PAL/SECAM services.

DVB standards are used throughout Europe, as well as in Australia, South Africa and India. They are also used for cable and satellite broadcasting in most Asian, African and many South American countries. Some have chosen ISDB-T instead of DVB-T and a few (United States, Canada, Mexico and South Korea) have chosen ATSC instead of DVB-T.

===Africa===
====Kenya====
DVB-T broadcasts were launched by the President of Kenya, Mwai Kibaki on 9 December 2009. Broadcasts are using H.264, with the University of Nairobi supplying the decoders. Kenya has also been broadcasting DVB-H since July 2009, available on selected Nokia and ZTE handsets on the Safaricom and other GSM networks.

====Madagascar====
Since 2011, the pay TV operator Blueline launched a DVB-T service branded BluelineTV. It supplies both smart cards and set-top-boxes.

====South Africa====
Since 1995, the pay TV operator DStv used the DVB-S standard to broadcast its services. In 2010, it started a DVB over IP service, and in 2011 it started DStv mobile using the DVB-H standard.

In late 2010, the South African cabinet endorsed a decision by a Southern African Development Community (SADC) task team to adopt the DVB-T2 standard.

===Asia===
====Hong Kong====
In Hong Kong, several cable TV operators such as TVB Pay Vision and Cable TV have already started using DVB-S or DVB-C. The government however has adopted the DMB-T/H standard, developed in mainland China, for its digital terrestrial broadcasting services which has started since 31 December 2007.

====Iran====
On 17 March 2009, DVB-H and DVB-T H.264/AAC broadcasting started in Tehran by the IRIB. DVB-T broadcasting is now widely available in other cities such as Isfahan, Mashhad, Shiraz, Qom, Tabriz and Rasht as well.

====Israel====
DVB-T broadcasts using H.264 commenced in Israel on 1 June 2009 with the broadcast trial and the full broadcast began on 2 August 2009. Analog broadcasts were originally planned to end in 18 months after the launch, but analog broadcasts were switched off on 31 March 2011 instead.

During 2010, DVB-T broadcasts have become widely available in most of Israel and an EPG was added to the broadcasts.

====Japan====
With the exception of SKY PerfecTV!, Japan uses different formats in all areas (ISDB), which are however quite similar to their DVB counterparts. SkyPerfect is a satellite provider using DVB on its 124 and 128 degrees east satellites. Its satellite at 110 degrees east does not use DVB, however.

====Malaysia====
In Malaysia, a new pay television station MiTV began service in September 2005 using DVB-IPTV technology while lone satellite programming provider ASTRO has been transmitting in DVB-S since its inception in 1996. Free-to-air DVB-T trials began in late 2006 with a simulcast of both TV1 and TV2 plus a new channel called RTM3/RTMi. In April 2007, RTM announced that the outcome of the test was favourable and that it expected DVB-T to go public by the end of 2007. However, the system did not go public as planned. As of 2008, the trial digital line-up has expanded to include a music television channel called Muzik Aktif, and a sports channel called Arena, with a news channel called Berita Aktif planned for inclusion in the extended trials soon. Also, high definition trials were performed during the Beijing Olympics and the outcome was also favourable. It was announced that the system would go public in 2009.

In 2009, MiTV closed down, changed its name to U-Television and announced that it was changing to scrambled DVB-T upon relaunch instead of the DVB-IPTV system used prior to shutting down. However, RTM&#x27;s digital network again did not go public, although around this time TVs that are first-generation DVB-T capable went on sale. The government has since announced that they will be deploying DVB-T2 instead in stages starting in mid-2015 and analog shutoff has been delayed to April 2019.

====Philippines====
In the Philippines, DVB-S and DVB-S2 are the two broadcast standards currently used by satellite companies, while DVB-C is also used by some cable companies. The government adopted DVB-T in November 2006 for digital terrestrial broadcasting but a year later, it considered other standards to replace DVB-T. The country has chosen the ISDB-T system instead of DVB-T.

====Taiwan====

In Taiwan, some digital cable television systems use DVB-C, though most customers still use analogue NTSC cable television. The government planned adopting ATSC or the Japanese ISDB-T standard as NTSC&#x27;s replacement. However, the country has chosen the European DVB-T system instead. Public Television Service (PTS) and Formosan TV provide high definition television. The former has the channel HiHD; the latter uses its HD channel for broadcasting MLB baseball.

===Europe===
====Cyprus====
Cyprus uses DVB-T with MPEG-4 encoding. Analogue transmission stopped on 1 July 2011 for all channels except CyBC 1.

====Denmark====
In Denmark, DVB-T replaced the analog transmission system for TV on 1 November 2009. Danish national digital TV transmission has been outsourced to the company Boxer TV A/S, acting as gatekeeper organization for terrestrial TV transmission in Denmark. However, there are still several free channels from DR.

====Finland====

DVB-T transmissions were launched on 21 August 2001. The analogue networks continued alongside the digital ones until 1 September 2007, when they were shut down nationwide. Before the analogue switchoff, the terrestrial network had three multiplexes: MUX A, MUX B and MUX C. MUX A contained the channels of the public broadcaster Yleisradio and MUX B was shared between the two commercial broadcasters: MTV3 and Nelonen. MUX C contained channels of various other broadcasters. After the analogue closedown, a fourth multiplex named MUX E was launched. All of the Yleisradio (YLE) channels are broadcast free-to-air, likewise a handful of commercial ones including MTV3, Nelonen, Subtv, Jim, Nelonen Sport, Liv, FOX, TV5 Finland, AVA and Kutonen. There are also several pay channels sold by PlusTV.

====Italy====

In Italy, DVB-S started in 1996 and the final analogue broadcasts were terminated in 2005. The switch-off from analogue terrestrial network to DVB-T started on 15 October 2008. Analogue broadcast was ended on 4 July 2012 after nearly four years of transition in phases.

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, DVB-S broadcasting started on 1 July 1996, satellite provider MultiChoice (now CanalDigitaal) switched off the analogue service shortly after on 18 August 1996. DVB-T broadcasting started April 2003, and terrestrial analog broadcasting was switched off December 2006. It was initially marketed by Digitenne but later by KPN. Multiplex 1 contains the NPO 1, NPO 2 and NPO 3 national TV channels, and a regional channel. Multiplexes 2~5 have the other encrypted commercial and international channels. Multiplex 1 also broadcasts the radio channels Radio 1, Radio 2, 3 FM, Radio 4, Radio 5, Radio 6, Concertzender, FunX and also a regional channel. As of June 2011, the Dutch DVB-T service had 29 TV channels and 20 radio channels (including free to air channels). DVB-T2 will be introduced during 2019/2020.

====Norway====
In Norway, DVB-T broadcasting is marketed under RiksTV (encrypted pay channels) and NRK (unencrypted public channels). DVB-T broadcasting via the terrestrial network began in November 2007, and has subsequently been rolled out one part of the country at a time. The Norwegian implementation of DVB-T is different from most others, as it uses H.264 with HE-AAC audio encoding, while most other countries have adapted the less recent MPEG-2 standard. Notably most DVB software for PC has problems with this, though in late 2007 compatible software was released, like DVBViewer using the libfaad2 library. Sony has released several HDTVs (Bravia W3000, X3000, X3500, E4000, V4500, W4000, W4500, X4500) that support Norway&#x27;s DVB-T implementation without use of a separate set-top box, and Sagem ITD91 HD, Grundig DTR 8720 STBs are others.

====Poland====
Currently, Poland uses the DVB-T2 standard with HEVC encoding. Analogue broadcast switch-off started on 7 November 2012 and was completed on 23 July 2013.

====Portugal====
Portugal follows the DVB-T implementation, using H.264 with AAC audio encoding. It has been live since 29 April 2009 and the switch-off date for all analog signals was on 26 April 2012.

====Romania====
Romania started digital terrestrial broadcasting in 2005 but it was virtually unknown by many people in Romania due to the lack of content, cable TV and satellite TV being far more popular, however it was the first platform to deliver HD content. Today, Romania is using DVB-T2 as terrestrial standard, but also DVB-S/S2, and DVB-C which is extremely popular. The only analogue broadcast remains on cable. Romania adopted the DVB-T2 standard in 2016 after a series of tests with mpeg2, mpeg4 on DVB-T, and has today fully implemented DVB-T2. DVB-C, which was introduced in late 2005, still remains with mpeg2 on SD content and mpeg4 on HD content. DVB-S (introduced in 2004 focus sat being the first such platform) is used in basic packages with standard definition content, while DVB-S2 set top boxes are provided for both SD and HD content.

====Russia====
Fully switched to digital in 2019, Russia uses the DVB-T2 standard for broadcasting 2 channel packs with about ten main national radio and TV channels (Channel One, Rossiya 1/2/K/24, NTV, Radio Mayak, Radio Rossii etc.

====Spain====
Quiero TV started digital terrestrial broadcasting in 2000 as pay television. The platform closed three years later after gaining 200,000 subscribers. The frequencies used by Quiero TV were used from 2005 to simulcast free-to-air analogue broadcast as DVB-T, under the name &quot;TDT&quot;. The service started with 20 free-to-air national TV channels as well as numerous regional and local channels. Analogue broadcast ended on 2010 after getting 100% digital coverage. Some of the analogue frequencies were used to increase the number of channels and simulcast some of them in HD. Since February 14th, 2024, all channels will be required to broadcast exclusively in HD. Frequencies of SD channels will be used to simulcast some of them in 4K using DVB-T2.

====United Kingdom====

In the UK DVB-T has been adopted for broadcast of standard definition terrestrial programming, as well as a single DVB-T2 multiplex for high-definition programming. The UK terminated all analogue terrestrial broadcasts by the end of 2012. The vast majority of channels are available free-to-air through the Freeview service. DVB-T was also used for the now-defunct ONDigital/ITV Digital and Top Up TV service.

All satellite programming (some of which is available free-to-air via Freesat or free-to-view via Freesat from Sky; the remainder requires a subscription to Sky), is broadcast using either DVB-S or DVB-S2.

Subscription-based cable television from Virgin Media uses DVB-C.

===North America===
In North America, DVB-S is often used in encoding and video compression of digital satellite communications alongside Hughes DSS. Unlike Motorola&#x27;s DigiCipher 2 standard, DVB has a wider adoption in terms of the number of manufacturers of receivers. Terrestrial digital television broadcasts in Canada, Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, and the United States use ATSC encoding with 8VSB modulation instead of DVB-T with COFDM. Television newsgathering links from mobile vans to central receive points (often on mountaintops or tall buildings) use DVB-T with COFDM in the 2 GHz frequency band.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
In Australia, DVB broadcasting is marketed under the Freeview brand name, and more recently &#x27;Freeview Plus&#x27;, denoting the integration of online HbbTV and EPG in certain DVB devices. Regular broadcasts began in January 2001 using MPEG 2 video and MPEG 1 audio in SD and HD.

Changes to broadcasting rules have enabled broadcasters to offer multi-channeling, prompting broadcasters to use H.264 video with MPEG 1 or AAC audio encoding for some secondary channels.

Specifications for HD channels now differ depending on the broadcaster. ABC, Nine and Ten use 1920x1080i MPEG 4 video with Dolby Digital audio. Seven and SBS use 1440x1080i MPEG 2 video with Dolby Digital and MPEG 1 respectively.

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, DVB broadcasting is marketed under the Freeview brand name. SD MPEG-2 DVB-S broadcasts via satellite began on 2 May 2007 and DVB-T (terrestrial) broadcasts began April 2008 broadcasting in HD H.264 video with HE-AAC audio.

===South America===
====Colombia====
Since 2008, Colombia has adopted as a public policy the decision to migrate from the analog television implemented in 1954 to Digital Terrestrial Television (DVB-T2). This measure allows the viewers access to the open television (OTA) of public and private channels, with video quality in HD. As planned, analogue television broadcasts will end in 2021.

==DVB compliant products==
Companies that manufacture a product which is compliant to one or more DVB standards have the option of registering a declaration of conformity for that product. Wherever the DVB trademark is used in relation to a product – be it a broadcast, a service, an application or equipment – the product must be registered with the DVB project office.

<text>The Ford Pinto is a subcompact car that was manufactured and marketed by Ford Motor Company in North America from 1970 until 1980. The Pinto was the first subcompact vehicle produced by Ford in North America.

The Pinto was marketed in three body styles throughout its production: a two-door fastback sedan with a trunk, a three-door hatchback, and a two-door station wagon. Mercury offered rebadged versions of the Pinto as the Mercury Bobcat from 1975 until 1980 (1974–1980 in Canada). Over three million Pintos were produced over its ten-year production run, outproducing the combined totals of its domestic rivals, the Chevrolet Vega and the AMC Gremlin. The Pinto and Mercury Bobcat were produced at Edison Assembly in Edison, New Jersey, St. Thomas Assembly in Southwold, Ontario, and San Jose Assembly in Milpitas, California.

Since the 1970s, the safety reputation of the Pinto has generated controversy. Its fuel-tank design attracted both media and government scrutiny after several deadly fires occurred when the tanks ruptured in rear-end collisions. A subsequent analysis of the overall safety of the Pinto suggested it was comparable to other 1970s subcompact cars. The safety issues surrounding the Pinto and the subsequent response by Ford have been cited widely as business ethics and tort reform case studies.

==Background==
American automakers had first countered imports such as the Volkswagen Beetle with compact cars including the Ford Falcon, Ford Maverick, Chevrolet Corvair and Plymouth Valiant, although these cars featured six-cylinder engines and comprised a larger vehicle class. As the popularity of smaller Japanese imports Toyota Corolla and Datsun 510 increased throughout the 1960s, Ford North America responded by introducing the Cortina from Ford of Europe as a captive import. American automakers introduced their subcompacts, led by the AMC Gremlin that arrived six months before the Pinto, and the Chevrolet Vega, introduced the day before the Pinto.

Named after a type of horse with a distinctive coat, the Pinto was introduced on September 11, 1970, using a completely new platform along with a powertrain from the European-specification Escort. Ford Chairman Henry Ford II himself purchased a 1971 Runabout (hatchback) as one of his personal cars.

== Product development ==
Initial planning for the Pinto began in the summer of 1967, was recommended by Ford&#x27;s Product Planning Committee in December 1968, and was approved by Ford&#x27;s board of directors in January 1969. Ford President Lee Iacocca wanted a 1971 model that weighed under and that would be priced at less than US$2,000 ($ in dollars). The Pinto product development, from conception through delivery, was completed in 25 months when the automotive industry average was 43 months, the shortest production planning schedule in automotive history at the time. Some development processes usually conducted sequentially were conducted in parallel. Machine tooling overlapped with product development, which froze the basic design. Decisions that threatened the schedule were discouraged; the attitude of Ford management was to develop the Pinto as quickly as possible. Iacocca ordered a rush project to build the car, and the Pinto became known internally as &quot;Lee&#x27;s car&quot;. The Pinto&#x27;s bodywork was styled by Robert Eidschun.

Offered with an inline-four engine and bucket seats the Pinto&#x27;s mechanical design was conventional, with unibody construction, a longitudinally mounted engine in front driving the rear wheels through either a manual or automatic transmission and live axle rear end. The suspension was by unequal-length control arms with front coil springs while the live rear axle was mounted on leaf springs. The rack and pinion steering optionally had power assist, as did the brakes. Ford had not offered a four-cylinder engine in North America since the cancellation of the Ford Model A engine in 1934 when the Ford Model B was discontinued. The Kent engine was sourced from Ford of England.

==Production history==
On September 11, 1970, Ford introduced the Pinto under the tagline &quot;The Little Carefree Car.&quot;

After structural design on alternate body styles encountered obstacles, Ford offered the Pinto solely as a two-door sedan, with entry-level models priced at $1,850, undercutting GM&#x27;s Chevrolet Vega and directly targeting imported models – which included such new competitors as the Mazda 1200 in 1971, the Subaru DL in 1972, and the Honda Civic in 1973.

The Pinto had sold over 100,000 units by January 1971, and 352,402 for the entire 1971 production run; 1974 saw the most Pintos produced in a single model year, with 544,209 units.

===1971–1973===

The Ford Pinto went on sale on September 11, 1970, in one body style, a fastback sedan with an enclosed trunk. A hatchback became available on February 20, 1971, debuting at the Chicago Auto Show. In 1971, the Pinto brochure came with a paper cutout Pinto that one could fold to make a 3D model. Marketed as the &quot;Runabout,&quot; the hatchback went on sale five days later, priced at $2,062 ($ in dollars ). The hatch itself featured exposed chrome hinges for the liftgate and five decorative chrome strips, sprung scissor struts to assist in opening the hatch, a rear window approximately as large as the sedan&#x27;s, and a fold-down seat – a feature which became simultaneously an option on the sedan. The hatchback model matched the sedan in all other dimensions and offered of cargo space with its seat folded. By 1972, Ford redesigned the hatch itself, with the glass portion of the hatch enlarged to almost the entire size of the hatch itself, ultimately to be supplemented for 1977–1980 with an optional rear hatch that was entirely glass.

On October 30, 1970, less than two months after introduction, 26,000 Pintos were recalled to address a possible problem with the accelerator sticking on once engaged at more than halfway. On March 29, 1971, Ford recalled all 220,000 Pintos manufactured before March 19, 1971, to address a problem with fuel vapors in the engine air filter possibly igniting by a backfire through the carburetor.

On February 24, 1972, the Pinto station wagon debuted with an overall length of and of cargo volume. The first 2-door Ford station wagon since the 1965 Falcon, the Pinto wagon was equipped with flip-open rear quarter windows. Along with front disc brakes, the 2.0L engine was standard equipment. A &quot;Pinto Squire&quot; wagon featured simulated woodgrain trim similar to the full-size Country Squire.

Also in February 1972, the Sprint Decor Group was made available for the Pinto for one model year only. The Sprint Decor Group included white exterior paint with blue accent paint and red pin-striping, a blacked-out grille, color-keyed wheels with bright trim rings and hubcaps, whitewall tires, and color-keyed dual sport mirrors. The interior included red, white, and blue cloth and vinyl bucket seats, full carpeting as well as a deluxe steering wheel. The Sprint Decor Group was offered simultaneously on the Maverick and Mustang.

For the 1973 model year, more appearance options were offered. There was a new Sport Accent Group offered in white exterior paint with a choice of two-tone orange or avocado accent paint, matching vinyl roof, and a deluxe interior with wood-tone trim. There was also a new Luxury Decor Group with bright exterior dress-up mouldings, black bumper rub strips, and a deluxe interior with wood-tone trim. New slotted forged aluminum wheels were offered.

===1974–1978===
In 1974, to meet federal regulations, 5 mph bumpers were added to both the front and rear. Unlike most 1970s cars, the addition of larger bumpers to the Pinto did not necessitate major changes to the bodywork. While the underpowered Kent engine was dropped, the optional OHC engine was expanded to 2.3 L; in various forms, this engine powered a variety of Ford vehicles for 23 years. In 1974, Mercury began selling a rebadged version of the Pinto called Bobcat as a Canada-only model. 544,209 units sold; 1974 became the most popular model year for the Pinto. Steel-belted tires, an anti-theft alarm system, and metallic glow paint were optional.

In 1975, in a move to better compete with the AMC Gremlin, Ford introduced the 2.8 L V6; while far less powerful than the Gremlin&#x27;s standard I6, the V6 gave the Pinto a feature unavailable in the Chevrolet Vega. Sales of the Mercury Bobcat were expanded to Lincoln-Mercury dealers in the United States; it was sold as a hatchback and station wagon.

As a minor styling update for 1976, the Pinto received the egg-crate grille and chrome headlamp bezels recycled from the Canada-only 1974 Mercury Bobcat. For one model year only, two new option packages were offered. One was the sporty new Stallion appearance package with blackout trim and black two-tone accent paint offered in red, yellow, silver, and white body colors. This option package was shared with the Mustang II and Maverick. The other new option package was the Runabout Squire which featured wood-grain vinyl bodysides like the Squire wagon. The interior received the optional Luxury Decor Group which featured new low-back vinyl or plaid cloth bucket seats with matching door trim. A new basic low-cost model was introduced known as the Pinto Pony with less standard equipment and cheaper interior trim. A wagon version of the Pony would later arrive for the 1979 model year.

For the 1977 model year, the Pinto received its first significant styling updates with slanted back urethane headlamp buckets, parking lamps, and grille. The tail lamps were revised except for the wagons. Runabouts offered an optional all-glass rear hatch for the first time. Pinto wagons were given a new option package. Dubbed the &quot;Pinto Cruising Wagon&quot;, it was the sedan delivery version of the Pinto styled to resemble a small conversion van, complete with round side panel &quot;bubble windows&quot; and a choice of optional vinyl graphics.

Ford offered new sporty appearance packages similar to those found on the Chevrolet Vega and AMC Gremlin but were strictly cosmetic upgrades that added nothing to vehicle performance.

In 1978, the Pinto was no longer the smallest Ford sold in the U.S., as the company introduced the Fiesta. Nearly two feet shorter than the Pinto, the German-designed Fiesta was the first front-wheel-drive car sold by Ford in the United States.

===1979–1980===

For the 1979 model year, the Pinto featured rectangular headlamps, inboard vertical parking lamps, and a taller slanted back grille. Except for the wagons, the tail lamps were revised. The interior was updated with a new rectangular instrument cluster and a modified dash-pad for vehicles without the optional sports instrumentation. The variety of sports appearance packages was revised, some with new graphics.

The Pinto ESS (European Sports Sedan) trim package became available in 2-door Sedan and 3-door Runabout body styles featuring black roof drip mouldings, lower back panel, rocker panels, glass surrounds and door frame trims (incl. black tape along lower side window ledges), dual sport mirrors, premium body-side mouldings, and hinges for the standard all-glass third door. The grille and headlamp surrounds were charcoal, the fenders had ESS identification and the styled steel wheels had black wheel trim rings. The Sports Package (front stabilizer bar, sport steering wheel, full instrumentation, optional axle ratio on 2.3L manual cars) was standard.

July 1980 marked the end of the Pinto&#x27;s production run, with a total production run of 3,150,943 cars. Ford&#x27;s designated replacement for the Pinto was the front-wheel drive Ford Escort. For the 1980 model year, the V6 engine was discontinued, leaving the 2.3 L as the sole engine.

==Powertrain==
Except for 1980, the Pinto was available with a choice of two engines. For the first five years of production, only four-cylinder inline engines were offered. Ford changed the power ratings almost every year.

Initial Pinto deliveries in the early years used the English and German engines tuned for performance (see below). The engine used a two-barrel carburetor where just one bore was bigger than that used on the Maverick. With the low weight (not much above ) and the SOHC engine it accelerated from in 10.8 seconds. With the advent of emission control requirements, Ford moved from European-sourced to domestically sourced engines, using new or modified designs. New safety legislation affected bumpers and other parts, adding to the weight of the car and reducing performance. Revised SAE standards in 1972 dropped the Pinto&#x27;s engine to  – and the engine to .

In 1974, the &quot;OHC&quot; I4 engine was introduced. This engine was updated and modified several times, allowing it to remain in production into 1997. Among other Ford vehicles, a turbocharged version of this engine later powered the performance-based Thunderbird Turbo Coupe, Mustang SVO, and the European-built Merkur XR4Ti. Ford introduced the Cologne-built 2.8 litre V-6 engine as an option in 1975.

==Mercury Bobcat (1974–1980)==
Lincoln-Mercury dealers marketed a rebadged variant of the Pinto as the Mercury Bobcat, beginning with the 1974 model year in Canada. It was produced in all of the same body styles and styled with a unique egg-crate grille and chrome headlamp bezels (which were later recycled for a styling update to the 1976 Pinto). The rear featured modified double-width tail lamps for the sedan and Runabout models.

For 1975, the Bobcat was added to the U.S. market and sold initially in upgraded levels of trim as the Runabout hatchback and Villager wagon. Lesser-trimmed versions were offered in subsequent model years. The Bobcat was never offered as a two-door sedan with an enclosed trunk for the U.S. market. The Bobcat was offered as a two-door sedan for a limited number of years in Canada. All Bobcats were restyled with a domed hood and a taller vertical bar grille styled to look like senior Mercury models. Throughout all the model years, Bobcats offered various appearance options that were similar to the Pinto&#x27;s.

For 1979, the Bobcat received a major restyling shared with the Pinto featuring a slanted back front end with rectangular headlamps and inboard vertical parking lamps but distinguished with a large vertical bar grille. Except for the wagons, the tail lamps were revised. The base instrument cluster received a new rectangular design with a modified dash pad.

Production of the Bobcat ended in 1980 to make way for its replacement, the Mercury Lynx. In total, 224,026 Bobcats were produced from 1975 until 1980.

==Reception and criticism==
Upon release, the Pinto was received with both positive and negative reviews. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; listed the Pinto as one of the &quot;runners up&quot; in a test of six subcompact cars—better in overall quality than the AMC Gremlin and about on a par with the Volkswagen Beetle, but inferior to the &quot;three winners&quot; — Datsun 510, Toyota Corona and Chevrolet Vega. &quot; Road &amp; Track&quot; faulted the suspension and standard drum brakes, calling the latter a &quot;serious deficiency&quot;, but praised the proven 1.6 L &quot;Kent&quot; engine, adapted from European Fords. &quot;Super Stock Magazine&quot; found the fit and finish to be &quot;superior&quot; and were impressed with the car overall. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; found the Pinto, when equipped with the larger 2.0L engine and front disc brakes, to be a nimble and powerful commuter car with good visibility and sports-car feel. A review of the 1974 Pinto with an automatic transmission by &quot;Car and Driver&quot; was not as favorable noting significant decreases in mileage and acceleration.

The later controversy surrounding the Pinto resulted in a negative legacy associated with the car and Ford&#x27;s handling of the controversies. In 2004, &quot;Forbes&quot; included the Pinto among its fourteen &quot;Worst Cars of All Time,&quot; noting that its problems helped create an opening in the US market for small cars from Japan. &quot;Time&quot; magazine included the Pinto on lists of &quot;The Fifty Worst Cars of All Time&quot;. &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;, and NBC News have included the car in lists of most significant recalls. The controversy also resulted in movies referencing the vehicle.

== Fuel system fires, recalls, and litigation ==
The safety of the design of the Pinto&#x27;s fuel system led to critical incidents and subsequently resulted in a recall, lawsuits, criminal prosecution, and public controversy. The events surrounding the controversy have been described as a &quot;landmark narrative&quot;. The Ford Pinto has been cited and debated in numerous business ethics as well as tort reform case studies.

The placement of the car&#x27;s fuel tank was the result of both conservative industry practice of the time as well as the uncertain regulatory environment during the development and early sales periods of the car. Ford was accused of knowing the car had an unsafe tank placement and then forgoing design changes based on an internal cost-benefit analysis. Two landmark legal cases, &quot;Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.&quot; and &quot;Indiana v. Ford Motor Co.&quot;, resulted from fatal accidents involving Pintos.

Scholarly work published in the decades after the Pinto&#x27;s release has examined the cases and offered summations of the general understanding of the Pinto and the controversy regarding the car&#x27;s safety performance and risk of fire. These works reviewed misunderstandings related to the actual number of fire-related deaths related to the fuel system design, &quot;wild and unsupported claims asserted in &quot;Pinto Madness&quot; and elsewhere&quot;, the facts of the related legal cases, &quot;Grimshaw vs Ford Motor Company&quot; and &quot;State of Indiana vs Ford Motor Company&quot;, the applicable safety standards at the time of design, and the nature of the NHTSA investigations and subsequent vehicle recalls. One described the Grimshaw case as &quot;mythical&quot; due to several significant factual misconceptions and their effect on the public&#x27;s understanding.

===Fuel system design===
The design of the Pinto fuel system was complicated by the uncertain regulatory environment during the development period. The first federal standard for automotive fuel system safety, passed in 1967, known as Section 301 in the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, initially only considered front impacts. In January 1969, 18 months into the Pinto&#x27;s development cycle, the NHTSA proposed expanding the standard to cover rear-end collisions. The proposed standard was based on a 20 mph moving-barrier rear impact test. Ford publicly announced it supported the standard. In August 1970, the month the Pinto went into production, the NHTSA changed the proposal to a more stringent 20 mph fixed-barrier standard which car companies were to meet in 18 months. The fixed-barrier standard was seen by the auto industry as a significant increase in test severity. At the same time, the NHTSA announced a long-term goal of setting a 30-mph fixed-barrier standard. Due to the confusion related to the various proposed standards and an expectation that the NHTSA would not select the more stringent 30 mph fixed-barrier standard, Ford elected to voluntarily meet the 20 mph moving-barrier standard for all cars by 1973. Ford and other automobile manufacturers objected to the more stringent fuel system safety standard and filed objections during the required comment periods of the proposed regulations.

The Pinto&#x27;s design positioned its fuel tank between the solid live rear axle and the rear bumper, a standard practice in US subcompact cars at the time. The Pinto&#x27;s vulnerability to fuel leakage and fire in a rear-end collision was exacerbated by reduced rear &quot;crush space&quot;, a lack of structural reinforcement in the rear, and an &quot;essentially ornamental&quot; rear bumper (though similar to other manufacturers).

As part of a response to the NHTSA&#x27;s proposed regulations, crash testing conducted in 1970 with modified Ford Mavericks demonstrated vulnerability at fairly low crash speeds. Design changes were made, but post-launch tests showed similar results. These tests were conducted to develop crash testing standards rather than specifically investigating fuel system integrity. Though Ford engineers were not pleased with the car&#x27;s performance, no reports of the time indicate particular concern. The Pinto was tested by rival American Motors (AMC) where in addition to crash-testing, engineers specialized in fuel-system performance because of the potential deadly fires in severe collisions.

Ford also tested several different vehicle modifications that could improve rear impact performance. However, the engineer&#x27;s occupational caution and aversion to &quot;unproven&quot; solutions, as well as a view that the crash test results were inconclusive, resulted in the use of a conventional fuel tank design and placement. The use of an above-the-axle tank location was considered safer by some, but not all, at Ford. This placement was not a viable option for the hatchback and station wagon body styles.

Beginning in 1973, field reports of Ford Pintos consumed by fire after low-speed rear-end collisions were received by Ford&#x27;s recall coordinator office. Based on standard procedures used to evaluate field reports, Ford&#x27;s internal recall evaluation group twice reviewed the field data and found no actionable issue.

=== Cost–benefit analysis, the Pinto Memo ===
In 1973, Ford&#x27;s Environmental and Safety Engineering division developed a cost–benefit analysis entitled &quot;Fatalities Associated with Crash Induced Fuel Leakage and Fires&quot; for submission to the NHTSA in support of Ford&#x27;s objection to proposed stronger fuel system regulation. The document has become known as the &quot;Grush/Saunby Report&quot;, named for its authors, and as the &quot;Pinto Memo&quot;. Cost-benefit analysis was one tool used in the evaluation of safety design decisions accepted by the industry and the NHTSA. The analysis compared the cost of repairs to the societal costs for injuries and deaths related to fires in cases of vehicle rollovers for all cars sold in the US by all manufacturers. The values assigned to serious burn injuries and loss of life were based on values calculated by NHTSA in 1972. In the memo Ford estimated the cost of fuel system modifications to reduce fire risks in rollover events to be $11 per car across 12.5 million cars and light trucks (all manufacturers), for a total of $137 million. The design changes were estimated to save 180 burn deaths and 180 serious injuries per year, a benefit to society of $49.5 million.

In August 1977, having been provided with a copy of the memo by &quot;Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.&quot; plaintiffs before trial, Mark Dowie&#x27;s investigative article &quot;Pinto Madness&quot;, published in &quot;Mother Jones&quot; magazine, emphasized the emotional aspects of the Grush/Saunby Report and implied Ford was callously trading lives for profits. The &quot;Mother Jones&quot; article also erroneously claimed that somewhere between 500 and 900 persons had been killed in fires attributed to the Pinto&#x27;s unique design features.

The public understanding of the cost-benefit analysis has contributed to the mythology of the Ford Pinto case. &quot;Time&quot; magazine said the memo was one of the automotive industry&#x27;s &quot;most notorious paper trails&quot;. A common misconception is that the document considered Ford&#x27;s tort liability costs rather than the generalized cost to society and applied to the annual sales of all passenger cars, not just Ford vehicles. The general misunderstanding of the document, as presented by &quot;Mother Jones,&quot; gave it an operational significance it never had.

=== NHTSA investigation ===
In April 1974, the Center for Auto Safety petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to recall Ford Pintos to address fuel system design defects after reports from attorneys of three deaths and four serious injuries in rear-end collisions at moderate speeds. The NHTSA found there was not enough evidence to warrant a defect investigation. In August 1977, Dowie&#x27;s &quot;Pinto Madness&quot; article was published, leveling a series of accusations against Ford, the Pinto and the NHTSA. These included that Ford knew the Pinto was a &quot;firetrap&quot; and said that Ford did not implement design changes because the company&#x27;s cost-benefit analysis document showed that paying out millions in damages in lawsuits was less expensive than the design changes. The day after the article&#x27;s release consumer advocate Ralph Nader and the author of the &quot;Mother Jones&quot; article held a news conference in Washington DC on the alleged dangers of the Pinto&#x27;s design. On the same day, Nader and the Center for Auto Safety re-submitted their petition to the NHTSA.

Former UCLA law professor Gary T. Schwartz in a &quot;Rutgers Law Review&quot; article said the NHTSA investigation of the Pinto was in response to consumer complaints and noted the &quot;Mother Jones&quot; article included a clip out &quot;coupon&quot; that readers could mail to the NHTSA. Lee and Ermann note that the &quot;Mother Jones&quot; labeling of the Pinto as a &quot;firetrap&quot; and accusations that the NHTSA was buckling to industry pressure as well as the public interest created by sensationalized news stories &quot;forced a second Pinto investigation and guaranteed that the NHTSA would be under the microscope for its duration.&quot;

On August 11, 1977, the day after the Nader and &quot;Mother Jones&quot; press conference, the NHTSA initiated an investigation. On May 8, 1978, the NHTSA informed Ford of their determination that the Pinto fuel system was defective. The NHTSA concluded:

1971–1976 Ford Pintos have experienced moderate speed, rear-end collisions that have resulted in fuel tank damage, fuel leakage, and fire occurrences that have resulted in fatalities and non-fatal burn injuries ... The fuel tank design and structural characteristics of the 1975–1976 Mercury Bobcat which render it identical to contemporary Pinto vehicles, also render it subject to like consequences in rear-impact collisions.

NHTSA scheduled a public hearing for June 1978, and NHTSA negotiated with Ford on the recall. 
Lee and Ermann noted that NHTSA used a worst-case test to justify the recall of the Pinto, rather than the regular 1977 rear-impact crash test. A large and heavy car was used instead of a standard moving barrier. Weights were placed in the nose of the car to help it slide under the Pinto and maximize gas tank contact. The vehicle headlights were turned on to provide a possible ignition source. The fuel tank was completely filled with gasoline rather than partially filled with non-flammable Stoddard fluid as was the normal test procedure. In a later interview, the NHTSA engineer was asked why the NHTSA forced a Pinto recall for failing a 35 mph test given that most small cars of the time would not have passed. &quot;Just because your friends get away with shoplifting, doesn&#x27;t mean you should get away with it too.&quot;

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) ultimately directed Ford to recall the Pinto. Initially, the NHTSA did not feel there was sufficient evidence to demand a recall due to incidents of fire. The NHTSA investigation found that 27 deaths were found to have occurred between 1970 and mid-1977 in rear-impact crashes that resulted in a fire. The NHTSA did not indicate if these impacts would have been survivable absent fire or if the impacts were more severe than even a state-of-the-art (for 1977) fuel system could have withstood. In their analysis of the social factors affecting the NHTSA&#x27;s actions, Lee and Ermann note that 27 is the same number of deaths attributed to a Pinto transmission problem which contributed to collisions after the affected cars stalled. They also note that the NHTSA had two primary incentives in proving a defect existed in the Pinto&#x27;s fuel system design. The administration was pressured by safety advocates (Center for Auto Safety) as well as the public response. It was also being forced into action due to how both the courts and executive branch were limiting the ability of the NHTSA to address systematic auto safety issues.

===Recall===
Though Ford could have proceeded with the formal recall hearing, fearing additional damage to the company&#x27;s public reputation, the company agreed to a &quot;voluntary recall&quot; program. On June 9, 1978, days before the NHTSA was to issue Ford a formal recall order, Ford recalled 1.5 million Ford Pintos and Mercury Bobcats, the largest recall in automotive history at the time. The recall included sedans and hatchbacks, but not the station wagon. Ford disagreed with the NHTSA finding of a defect, and said the recall was to &quot;end public concern that has resulted from criticism of the fuel systems in these vehicles.&quot; The Ford recall placed a polyethylene shield between the tank and likely causes of puncture, lengthened the filler tube, and improved the tank filler seal in the event of a collision.

=== Legal cases ===
Approximately 117 lawsuits were brought against Ford in connection with rear-end accidents in the Pinto. The two most significant cases were &quot;Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Company&quot; and &quot;State of Indiana v. Ford Motor Company&quot;.

==== &quot;Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.&quot; ====
&quot;Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co.&quot;, decided in February 1978, is one of two important Pinto cases. A 1972 Pinto driven by Lily Gray stalled in the center lane of a California freeway. The car was struck from behind by a vehicle initially traveling at 50 mph and impacted at an estimated between 30 and 50 mph, resulting in a fuel tank fire. Gray died at the time of the impact. Richard Grimshaw, the thirteen-year-old passenger, was seriously burned. The plaintiff&#x27;s bar collaborated with &quot;Mother Jones&quot; and The Center for Auto Safety to publicize damning information about Ford prior to trial. The jury awarded $127.8 million in total damages; $125 million in punitive damages and $2,841,000 in compensatory damages to passenger Richard Grimshaw and $665,000 in compensatory damages to the family of the deceased driver, Lily Gray. The jury award was said to be the largest ever in US product liability and personal injury cases. The jury award was the largest against an automaker at the time. The judge reduced the jury&#x27;s punitive damages award to $3.5 million, which he later said was &quot;still larger than any other punitive damage award in the state by a factor of about five.&quot; Ford subsequently decided to settle related cases out of court.

Reaction to the Grimshaw case was mixed. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 2010, the award &quot;signaled to the auto industry that it would be harshly sanctioned for ignoring known defects.&quot; The case has been held up as an example of the disconnection between the use of corporate risk analysis and the tendency of juries to be offended by such analyses. The case is also cited as an example of irrational punitive damage awards. While supporting the finding of liability, Schwartz notes that the punitive damage award is hard to justify.

==== &quot;Indiana v. Ford Motor Co.&quot; ====
On August 10, 1978, three teenage girls of the Ulrich family of Osceola, Indiana, were killed when the 1973 Pinto they were in was involved in a rear-end collision. The driver had stopped in the road to retrieve the car&#x27;s gas cap which had been inadvertently left on the top of the car and subsequently fell onto the road. While stopped the Pinto was struck by a Chevrolet van. Ford sent the Ulrichs a recall notice for the Pinto in 1979. A grand jury indicted Ford on three counts of reckless homicide. &quot;Indiana v. Ford&quot; was a landmark in product liability law as the first time a corporation faced criminal charges for a defective product, and the first time a corporation was charged with homicide. If convicted, Ford faced a maximum fine of $30,000 under Indiana&#x27;s 1978 reckless homicide statute. Ford&#x27;s legal defense was vastly more ambitious than the effort mounted in the Grimshaw case. The effort was led by James F. Neal with a staff of 80 and a budget of about $1 million; the Elkhart County Prosecuting Attorney had a budget of about $20,000 and volunteer law professors and law students. A former head of the NHTSA, testifying on Ford&#x27;s behalf, said the Pinto&#x27;s design was no more or less safe than that of any other car in its class. Further, one of the defense&#x27;s key witnesses, John E. Habberstad, a Spokane-based accident reconstructionist, showed films of test crashes which revealed that, when hit by 1972-model Chevrolet vans, many other cars had similar damage to that which befell the Ford Pinto in which the three girls perished. Involved in the tests, in addition to the Pinto, were a Chevrolet Vega and Impala, American Motors Gremlin, Dodge Colt, and Toyota Corolla. In 1980 Ford was found not guilty. In 1980 a civil suit was settled for $7,500 to each plaintiff.

According to &quot;Automotive News&quot; in 2003, the indictment was a low point in Ford&#x27;s reputation. Some saw the suit as a landmark for taking a corporation to task for their actions while others saw the case as frivolous. In 2002, Malcolm Wheeler, a lawyer working with the Ford defense team, noted that the case was a poor application of criminal law. The case also impacted how Ford handled future product liability cases both legally and in the press.

===Retrospective safety analysis===
A &quot;Rutgers Law Review&quot; article by former UCLA law professor Gary T. Schwartz (see &quot;Section 7.3 NHTSA Investigation&quot; above), examined the fatality rates of the Pinto and several other small cars of the time. He noted that fires, and rear-end fires, in particular, are a very small portion of overall auto fatalities. At the time only 1% of automobile crashes would result in fire and only 4% of fatal accidents involved fire, and only 15% of fatal fire crashes are the result of rear-end collisions. When considering the overall safety of the Pinto, subcompact cars as a class had a generally higher fatality risk. Pintos represented 1.9% of all cars on the road in the 1975–76 period. During that time, the car represented 1.9% of all &quot;fatal accidents accompanied by some fire&quot;. This implies the Pinto was average for all cars and slightly above average for its class. When all types of fatalities are considered, the Pinto was approximately even with the AMC Gremlin, Chevrolet Vega, and Datsun 510. It was significantly better than the Datsun 1200/210, Toyota Corolla, and VW Beetle. The safety record of the car in terms of fire was average or slightly below average for compacts, and all cars respectively. This was considered respectable for a subcompact car. Only when considering the narrow subset of a rear impact, fire fatalities for the car were somewhat worse than the average for subcompact cars. While acknowledging this is an important legal point, Schwartz rejected the portrayal of the car as a firetrap.

<text>The Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (LBA, &quot;Federal Aviation Office&quot;) is the national civil aviation authority of Germany headquartered in Braunschweig.

It maintains regional offices in Düsseldorf, Frankfurt am Main (Raunheim), Hamburg, Munich (Airport), Stuttgart, and Berlin and reports directly to the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure.

The LBA is responsible for developing and maintaining aviation safety standards, as well as certifying airlines, airports, and training devices such a simulators and Flight Training Devices (FTDs). Some of these tasks are fulfilled on behalf of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Investigation of accidents is not a responsibility of the LBA but of the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation.

==History==
In 1918, when the Weimar Republic had been established, matters of aviation were provisionally assigned to the &quot;Reichsamt des Inneren&quot; (Imperial Ministry of the Interior). Later, the &quot;Reichsluftamt&quot; (Imperial Agency of Aviation) was established.

After World War II, matters of aviation were initially handled by the administration of the Allied occupation powers. Some matters of aviation were transferred to the &#x27;&quot;Vorläufige Bundesstelle für Luftfahrtgerät und Flugunfalluntersuchung&#x27;&quot; (Provisional Federal Office for Avionic Devices and Investigation of Aviation Accidents) established on 15 September 1953 in Bonn. Eventually, the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt was established by the &quot;Gesetz über das Luftfahrt-Bundesamt&quot; (Act on the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt) of 30 November 1954 (BGBl. I 354) and commenced operation on 1 February 1955.

In East Germany, the &quot;Hauptverwaltung der Zivilen Luftfahrt&quot; (Central Administration for Civil Aviation) was established on 1 January 1961. It was replaced by the &quot;Staatliche Luftfahrt-Inspektion der DDR&quot; (Public Department of Aviation of the GDR) on 1 January 1968, from which the &quot;Luftfahrt-Bundesamt&quot; took over all operations and most of the staff on 4 October 1990, the day after German re-unification.

On 28 September 2003, substantial competences were formally transferred to the European Aviation Safety Agency established by Regulation (EC) 1592/2002.

<doc id="146980" wikidata="Q7882788" url="?curid=146980" title="Uncle Sam's Curse">
<text>Uncle Sam&#x27;s Curse is the third studio album by the American hip hop group Above the Law. It was released in 1994, the group&#x27;s final record on Ruthless Records. The album peaked at number 15 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and 113 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Uncle Sam&#x27;s Curse&quot; sold over 250,000 copies.

Audio production was handled by A.T.L.&#x27;s Cold 187um with co-producers KM.G and K-oss. The tracks &quot;Return of the Real Shit&quot; and &quot;Black Superman&quot; contain samples from the 1994 film &quot;Against the Wall&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;Cold 187um kicks more good grooves as producer, but he can&#x27;t smooth over the lyrical nonsense.&quot;

In 2016, &quot;LA Weekly&quot; called the album &quot;an hourlong, funk-driven study in urban injustice and middle-American anxiety released halfway through the summer of the Brentwood murders, Newt Gingrich&#x27;s Contract With America and the Major League Baseball strike.&quot;

<doc id="146981" wikidata="Q47120" url="?curid=146981" title="David Oistrakh">
<text>David Fyodorovich Oistrakh (; – 24 October 1974) was a Soviet Russian violinist, violist, and conductor. He was also Professor at the Moscow Conservatory, People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR (1953), and Laureate of the Lenin Prize (1960).

Oistrakh collaborated with major orchestras and musicians from many parts of the world and was the dedicatee of numerous violin works, including both of Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s violin concerti and the violin concerto by Aram Khachaturian. He is considered one of the preeminent violinists of the 20th century.

== Life and career ==

===Early years===
Oistrakh was born to a Jewish family in Odessa, Kherson Governorate, Russian Empire (present day Ukraine). His father was Fischl Eustrach, son of a second guild merchant, and his mother was Beyle Oistrakh. At the age of five, young Oistrakh began his studies of the violin and viola as a pupil of Pyotr Stolyarsky. In his studies with Stolyarsky he became very good friends with Iosif Brodsky, Nathan Milstein and other violinists with whom he collaborated numerous times after achieving fame since their beginnings as fellow students at the Stolyarsky School.

In 1914, at the age of six, Oistrakh performed his debut concert. He entered the Odessa Conservatory in 1923, where he studied until his graduation in 1926. At the conservatory he also studied harmony with the composer Mykola Vilinsky. His 1926 graduation concert consisted of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Chaconne&quot;, Tartini&#x27;s &quot;Devil&#x27;s Trill Sonata&quot;, Rubinstein&#x27;s &quot;Viola Sonata&quot;, and Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Violin Concerto No. 1 in D major&quot;. In 1927, Oistrakh appeared in Kiev as soloist with the Glazunov &quot;Violin Concerto&quot; in a performance conducted by the composer, which earned the violinist an invitation to play the Tchaikovsky &quot;Violin Concerto&quot; in Leningrad with the Philharmonic Orchestra under Nikolai Malko the following year.

===In Moscow===
In 1927, Oistrakh relocated to Moscow, where he gave his first recital and met his future wife: the pianist Tamara Rotareva (1906–1976). They were married a year later and had one child, Igor Oistrakh, who was born in 1931. Igor Oistrakh later followed his father&#x27;s path as a violinist, and eventually performed and recorded side by side with his father, including Bach&#x27;s Double Concerto, which they first recorded in 1951, and Mozart&#x27;s Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra. In at least one of the recordings of Mozart&#x27;s Sinfonia Concertante, Igor Oistrakh played violin, while his father David played viola.

From 1934 onwards, Oistrakh held a position teaching at the Moscow Conservatory, and was later made professor in 1939. Some of his colleagues while teaching at the conservatory included Yuri Yankelevich and Boris Goldstein. Oistrakh taught Oleg Kagan, Valery Klimov (who later succeeded Oistrakh&#x27;s position at the Moscow Conservatory), Emmy Verhey, Oleh Krysa, Gidon Kremer, Yulia Brodskaya (Julia Verba), Eduard Dayan, Zoya Petrosyan, Jean Ter-Merguerian, Victor Danchenko, Victor Pikaizen, Cyrus Forough, Olga Parhomenko, and his son Igor Oistrakh. In the 1950s, David Oistrakh invited Yulia Brodskaya to be his assistant in teaching solo and chamber music and Rosa Fine as his assistant for solo students.

From 1940 to 1963, Oistrakh performed extensively in a trio that also included the cellist Sviatoslav Knushevitsky and the pianist Lev Oborin. It was sometimes called the &quot;Oistrakh Trio&quot;. Oistrakh collaborated extensively with Oborin, as well as Jacques Thibaud, a French violinist.

===During World War II===
During World War II he was active in the Soviet Union, premiering new concerti by Nikolai Miaskovsky and Aram Khachaturian as well as two sonatas by his friend Sergei Prokofiev. He was also awarded the Stalin Prize in 1942. The final years of the war saw the blossoming of a friendship with Shostakovich, which led to the two violin concertos and the sonata, all of which were to be premiered by and become firmly associated with Oistrakh in the following years. Oistrakh&#x27;s career was set from this point, although the Soviet Union was &quot;protective&quot; of its people and refused to let him perform abroad. He continued to teach in the Moscow Conservatory, but when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union, he went to the front lines, playing for soldiers and factory workers under intensely difficult conditions. Arguably one of the most heroic acts in his life was a performance of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Violin Concerto to the end in the central music hall during the Battle of Stalingrad in the winter of 1942 while central Stalingrad was being massively bombed by the German forces. At least one source indicates that Oistrakh performed there that winter.

===International travel===

Oistrakh was allowed to travel after the end of the war. He travelled to the countries in the Soviet bloc and even to the West. His first foreign engagement was to appear at the newly founded &quot;Prague Spring&quot; Festival where he was met with enormous success. In 1949 he gave his first concert in the West – in Helsinki. In 1951, he appeared at the &quot;Maggio Musicale&quot; Festival in Florence, in 1952 he was in East Germany for the Beethoven celebrations, France in 1953, Britain in 1954, and eventually, in 1955, he was allowed to tour the United States. By 1959, he was beginning to establish a second career as a conductor, and in 1960 he was awarded the coveted Lenin Prize. His Moscow conducting debut followed in 1962, and by 1967 he had established a partnership with the celebrated Soviet pianist Sviatoslav Richter.

===Later years===
The year 1968 saw wide celebrations for the violinist&#x27;s sixtieth birthday, which included a celebratory performance in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory of the Tchaikovsky concerto, one of his favourite works, under the baton of Gennady Rozhdestvensky. Oistrakh was now seen as one of the great violinists of his time, alongside fellow Russian Nathan Milstein, Romania&#x27;s George Enescu and Lithuanian-born Jascha Heifetz.
Oistrakh suffered a heart attack in 1964. He survived and continued to work at a furious pace. He had already become one of the principal cultural ambassadors for the Soviet Union to the West in live concerts and recordings. After conducting a cycle of Brahms with the Concertgebouw Orchestra, he died from another heart attack in Amsterdam in 1974. His remains were returned to Moscow, where he was interred in Novodevichy Cemetery.

==Distinctions==
Oistrakh received many awards and distinctions. Within the Soviet Union, David Oistrakh was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1942, the title of People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR in 1953, and the Lenin Prize in 1960. He also won the 1935 Soviet Union Competition. Several reputable works from the standard violin repertoire are dedicated to Oistrakh, including a concerto by Khachaturian, two concerti by Shostakovich, and several other pieces.

Oistrakh&#x27;s fame and success were not limited to the Soviet Union: he was placed second at the Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition in Warsaw, after the 16-year-old prodigy Ginette Neveu, and further improved upon that by winning the grand prize in the Queen Elisabeth Competition in Brussels.

The asteroid 42516 Oistrach is named in honour of him and his son, the violinist Igor Oistrakh.

==Instruments==
Oistrakh is known to have played at least seven Stradivarius violins owned by the Soviet Union. He initially selected the 1702 Conte di Fontana Stradivarius, which he played for 10 years before exchanging it for the 1705 Marsick Stradivarius in June 1966, which he played until his death (Interview included in &quot;The Art of Violin&quot; DVD, NVC Arts, 2000).

Oistrakh used bows by Albert Nürnberger and André Richaume throughout his life.
Up until 1957, he used a Nürnberger bow.
&quot;The André Richaume bow bought by his son Igor Oistrakh in 1957 had filled David with such enthusiasm that Igor made a gift of it.&quot;
Oistrakh had remarked that this (Richaume) bow gave him great satisfaction, so much so that when in Paris he had to meet Richaume in person.

==Chess==
Oistrakh was an avid chess player in the 1930s, when Stalin&#x27;s government was actively encouraging its best minds to pursue chess as a hobby. His 1937 match against the composer Sergei Prokofiev was a widely observed event in the Soviet Union and is seen as an important factor in the game&#x27;s enduring popularity in ex-Soviet nations today. Oistrakh handily defeated Prokofiev in the ten-game match; Prokofiev resigned after seven games. Only one game transcript survives, and it records a draw between the two players.

==Recordings==
Oistrakh made recordings for the state classical music label, Melodiya. These recordings were marketed in the west under EMI Records and in the U.S.A. under Angel Records. He made a few guest recordings with the Philadelphia Orchestra under the direction of Eugene Ormandy. These were issued by Columbia Records. In the 21st century, many of the Melodiya recordings have been reissued by Warner Classics, whose parent company acquired EMI&#x27;s classical catalog.

==Legacy==
There is a yearly music festival, &quot;The David Oistrakh Festival&quot;, from late August to October in Estonia.
Moscow International David Oistrakh Violin Competition is a biennial competition for young violinists held since 2006 in memory of David Oistrakh, organized by the non-profit David Oistrakh Charity Foundation. The competition, supported by Moscow government&#x27;s Department of Culture, the Ministry for Culture of Russia and the Moscow Conservatory, is a member of the European Union of Music Competitions for Youth.

The competition aims to popularize and develop the best traditions of Russian violin performance, and to discover young musicians.

<doc id="146983" wikidata="Q6500960" url="?curid=146983" title="Earth's magnetic field">
<text>Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, also known as the geomagnetic field, is the magnetic field that extends from Earth&#x27;s interior out into space, where it interacts with the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. The magnetic field is generated by electric currents due to the motion of convection currents of a mixture of molten iron and nickel in Earth&#x27;s outer core: these convection currents are caused by heat escaping from the core, a natural process called a geodynamo.

The magnitude of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field at its surface ranges from . As an approximation, it is represented by a field of a magnetic dipole currently tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to Earth&#x27;s rotational axis, as if there were an enormous bar magnet placed at that angle through the center of Earth. The North geomagnetic pole (Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada) actually represents the South pole of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, and conversely the South geomagnetic pole corresponds to the north pole of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field (because opposite magnetic poles attract and the north end of a magnet, like a compass needle, points toward Earth&#x27;s South magnetic field.)

While the North and South magnetic poles are usually located near the geographic poles, they slowly and continuously move over geological time scales, but sufficiently slowly for ordinary compasses to remain useful for navigation. However, at irregular intervals averaging several hundred thousand years, Earth&#x27;s field reverses and the North and South Magnetic Poles abruptly switch places. These reversals of the geomagnetic poles leave a record in rocks that are of value to paleomagnetists in calculating geomagnetic fields in the past. Such information in turn is helpful in studying the motions of continents and ocean floors. The magnetosphere is defined by the extent of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field in space or geospace. It extends above the ionosphere, several tens of thousands of kilometres into space, protecting Earth from the charged particles of the solar wind and cosmic rays that would otherwise strip away the upper atmosphere, including the ozone layer that protects Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.

== Significance ==
Earth&#x27;s magnetic field deflects most of the solar wind, whose charged particles would otherwise strip away the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. One stripping mechanism is for gas to be caught in bubbles of the magnetic field, which are ripped off by solar winds. Calculations of the loss of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of Mars, resulting from scavenging of ions by the solar wind, indicate that the dissipation of the magnetic field of Mars caused a near total loss of its atmosphere.

The study of the past magnetic field of the Earth is known as paleomagnetism. The polarity of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field is recorded in igneous rocks, and reversals of the field are thus detectable as &quot;stripes&quot; centered on mid-ocean ridges where the sea floor is spreading, while the stability of the geomagnetic poles between reversals has allowed paleomagnetism to track the past motion of continents. Reversals also provide the basis for magnetostratigraphy, a way of dating rocks and sediments. The field also magnetizes the crust, and magnetic anomalies can be used to search for deposits of metal ores.

Humans have used compasses for direction finding since the 11th century A.D. and for navigation since the 12th century. Although the magnetic declination does shift with time, this wandering is slow enough that a simple compass can remain useful for navigation. Using magnetoreception, various other organisms, ranging from some types of bacteria to pigeons, use the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field for orientation and navigation.

== Characteristics ==
At any location, the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field can be represented by a three-dimensional vector. A typical procedure for measuring its direction is to use a compass to determine the direction of magnetic North. Its angle relative to true North is the &quot;declination&quot; () or &quot;variation&quot;. Facing magnetic North, the angle the field makes with the horizontal is the &quot;inclination&quot; () or &quot;magnetic dip&quot;. The &quot;intensity&quot; () of the field is proportional to the force it exerts on a magnet. Another common representation is in (North), (East) and (Down) coordinates.
=== Intensity ===
The intensity of the field is often measured in gauss (G), but is generally reported in microteslas (μT), with 1 G = 100 μT. A nanotesla is also referred to as a gamma (γ). The Earth&#x27;s field ranges between approximately . By comparison, a strong refrigerator magnet has a field of about .

A map of intensity contours is called an &quot;isodynamic chart&quot;. As the World Magnetic Model shows, the intensity tends to decrease from the poles to the equator. A minimum intensity occurs in the South Atlantic Anomaly over South America while there are maxima over northern Canada, Siberia, and the coast of Antarctica south of Australia.

The intensity of the magnetic field is subject to change over time. A 2021 paleomagnetic study from the University of Liverpool contributed to a growing body of evidence that the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field cycles with intensity every 200 million years. The lead author stated that &quot;Our findings, when considered alongside the existing datasets, support the existence of an approximately 200-million-year-long cycle in the strength of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field related to deep Earth processes.&quot;

=== Inclination ===

The inclination is given by an angle that can assume values between −90° (up) to 90° (down). In the northern hemisphere, the field points downwards. It is straight down at the North Magnetic Pole and rotates upwards as the latitude decreases until it is horizontal (0°) at the magnetic equator. It continues to rotate upwards until it is straight up at the South Magnetic Pole. Inclination can be measured with a dip circle.

An &quot;isoclinic chart&quot; (map of inclination contours) for the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field is shown below.

=== Declination ===

Declination is positive for an eastward deviation of the field relative to true north. It can be estimated by comparing the magnetic north–south heading on a compass with the direction of a celestial pole. Maps typically include information on the declination as an angle or a small diagram showing the relationship between magnetic north and true north. Information on declination for a region can be represented by a chart with isogonic lines (contour lines with each line representing a fixed declination).

=== Geographical variation ===

=== Dipolar approximation ===
Near the surface of the Earth, its magnetic field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned at the center of the Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth. The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar magnet, with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole. This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth&#x27;s magnet. The dipolar field accounts for 80–90% of the field in most locations.
=== Magnetic poles ===
Historically, the north and south poles of a magnet were first defined by the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, not vice versa, since one of the first uses for a magnet was as a compass needle. A magnet&#x27;s North pole is defined as the pole that is attracted by the Earth&#x27;s North Magnetic Pole, in the arctic region, when the magnet is suspended so it can turn freely. Since opposite poles attract, the North Magnetic Pole of the Earth is really the south pole of its magnetic field (the place where the field is directed downward into the Earth).

The positions of the magnetic poles can be defined in at least two ways: locally or globally. The local definition is the point where the magnetic field is vertical. This can be determined by measuring the inclination. The inclination of the Earth&#x27;s field is 90° (downwards) at the North Magnetic Pole and –90° (upwards) at the South Magnetic Pole. The two poles wander independently of each other and are not directly opposite each other on the globe. Movements of up to per year have been observed for the North Magnetic Pole. Over the last 180 years, the North Magnetic Pole has been migrating northwestward, from Cape Adelaide in the Boothia Peninsula in 1831 to from Resolute Bay in 2001. The &quot;magnetic equator&quot; is the line where the inclination is zero (the magnetic field is horizontal).

The global definition of the Earth&#x27;s field is based on a mathematical model. If a line is drawn through the center of the Earth, parallel to the moment of the best-fitting magnetic dipole, the two positions where it intersects the Earth&#x27;s surface are called the North and South geomagnetic poles. If the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field were perfectly dipolar, the geomagnetic poles and magnetic dip poles would coincide and compasses would point towards them. However, the Earth&#x27;s field has a significant non-dipolar contribution, so the poles do not coincide and compasses do not generally point at either.

== Magnetosphere ==

Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, predominantly dipolar at its surface, is distorted further out by the solar wind. This is a stream of charged particles leaving the Sun&#x27;s corona and accelerating to a speed of 200 to 1000 kilometres per second. They carry with them a magnetic field, the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF).

The solar wind exerts a pressure, and if it could reach Earth&#x27;s atmosphere it would erode it. However, it is kept away by the pressure of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. The magnetopause, the area where the pressures balance, is the boundary of the magnetosphere. Despite its name, the magnetosphere is asymmetric, with the sunward side being about 10 Earth radii out but with the other side stretching out in a magnetotail that extends beyond 200 Earth radii.
Sunward of the magnetopause is the bow shock, the area where the solar wind slows abruptly.

Inside the magnetosphere is the plasmasphere, a donut-shaped region containing low-energy charged particles, or plasma. This region begins at a height of 60 km, extends up to 3 or 4 Earth radii, and includes the ionosphere. This region rotates with the Earth. There are also two concentric tire-shaped regions, called the Van Allen radiation belts, with high-energy ions (energies from 0.1 to 10 MeV). The inner belt is 1–2 Earth radii out while the outer belt is at 4–7 Earth radii. The plasmasphere and Van Allen belts have partial overlap, with the extent of overlap varying greatly with solar activity.

As well as deflecting the solar wind, the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field deflects cosmic rays, high-energy charged particles that are mostly from outside the Solar System. Many cosmic rays are kept out of the Solar System by the Sun&#x27;s magnetosphere, or heliosphere. By contrast, astronauts on the Moon risk exposure to radiation. Anyone who had been on the Moon&#x27;s surface during a particularly violent solar eruption in 2005 would have received a lethal dose.

Some of the charged particles do get into the magnetosphere. These spiral around field lines, bouncing back and forth between the poles several times per second. In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving rise to a ring current. This current reduces the magnetic field at the Earth&#x27;s surface. Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give rise to the lights of the aurorae while also emitting X-rays.

The varying conditions in the magnetosphere, known as space weather, are largely driven by solar activity. If the solar wind is weak, the magnetosphere expands; while if it is strong, it compresses the magnetosphere and more of it gets in. Periods of particularly intense activity, called geomagnetic storms, can occur when a coronal mass ejection erupts above the Sun and sends a shock wave through the Solar System. Such a wave can take just two days to reach the Earth. Geomagnetic storms can cause a lot of disruption; the &quot;Halloween&quot; storm of 2003 damaged more than a third of NASA&#x27;s satellites. The largest documented storm, the Carrington Event, occurred in 1859. It induced currents strong enough to disrupt telegraph lines, and aurorae were reported as far south as Hawaii.

== Time dependence ==
=== Short-term variations ===
The geomagnetic field changes on time scales from milliseconds to millions of years. Shorter time scales mostly arise from currents in the ionosphere (ionospheric dynamo region) and magnetosphere, and some changes can be traced to geomagnetic storms or daily variations in currents. Changes over time scales of a year or more mostly reflect changes in the Earth&#x27;s interior, particularly the iron-rich core.

Frequently, the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere is hit by solar flares causing geomagnetic storms, provoking displays of aurorae. The short-term instability of the magnetic field is measured with the K-index.

Data from THEMIS show that the magnetic field, which interacts with the solar wind, is reduced when the magnetic orientation is aligned between Sun and Earth – opposite to the previous hypothesis. During forthcoming solar storms, this could result in blackouts and disruptions in artificial satellites.

=== Secular variation ===


Changes in Earth&#x27;s magnetic field on a time scale of a year or more are referred to as &quot;secular variation&quot;. Over hundreds of years, magnetic declination is observed to vary over tens of degrees. The animation shows how global declinations have changed over the last few centuries.

The direction and intensity of the dipole change over time. Over the last two centuries the dipole strength has been decreasing at a rate of about 6.3% per century. At this rate of decrease, the field would be negligible in about 1600 years. However, this strength is about average for the last 7 thousand years, and the current rate of change is not unusual.

A prominent feature in the non-dipolar part of the secular variation is a &quot;westward drift&quot; at a rate of about 0.2° per year. This drift is not the same everywhere and has varied over time. The globally averaged drift has been westward since about 1400 AD but eastward between about 1000 AD and 1400 AD.

Changes that predate magnetic observatories are recorded in archaeological and geological materials. Such changes are referred to as &quot;paleomagnetic secular variation&quot; or &quot;paleosecular variation (PSV)&quot;. The records typically include long periods of small change with occasional large changes reflecting geomagnetic excursions and reversals.

A 1995 study of lava flows on Steens Mountain, Oregon appeared to suggest the magnetic field once shifted at a rate of up to 6° per day at some time in Earth&#x27;s history, a surprising result. However, in 2014 one of the original authors published a new study which found the results were actually due to the continuous thermal demagnitization of the lava, not to a shift in the magnetic field.

In July 2020 scientists report that analysis of simulations and a recent observational field model show that maximum rates of directional change of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field reached ~10° per year – almost 100 times faster than current changes and 10 times faster than previously thought.

=== Magnetic field reversals ===

Although generally Earth&#x27;s field is approximately dipolar, with an axis that is nearly aligned with the rotational axis, occasionally the North and South geomagnetic poles trade places. Evidence for these &quot;geomagnetic reversals&quot; can be found in basalts, sediment cores taken from the ocean floors, and seafloor magnetic anomalies. Reversals occur nearly randomly in time, with intervals between reversals ranging from less than 0.1 million years to as much as 50 million years. The most recent geomagnetic reversal, called the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal, occurred about 780,000 years ago. A related phenomenon, a geomagnetic &quot;excursion&quot;, takes the dipole axis across the equator and then back to the original polarity. The Laschamp event is an example of an excursion, occurring during the last ice age (41,000 years ago).

The past magnetic field is recorded mostly by strongly magnetic minerals, particularly iron oxides such as magnetite, that can carry a permanent magnetic moment. This remanent magnetization, or &quot;remanence&quot;, can be acquired in more than one way. In lava flows, the direction of the field is &quot;frozen&quot; in small minerals as they cool, giving rise to a thermoremanent magnetization. In sediments, the orientation of magnetic particles acquires a slight bias towards the magnetic field as they are deposited on an ocean floor or lake bottom. This is called &quot;detrital remanent magnetization&quot;.

Thermoremanent magnetization is the main source of the magnetic anomalies around mid-ocean ridges. As the seafloor spreads, magma wells up from the mantle, cools to form new basaltic crust on both sides of the ridge, and is carried away from it by seafloor spreading. As it cools, it records the direction of the Earth&#x27;s field. When the Earth&#x27;s field reverses, new basalt records the reversed direction. The result is a series of stripes that are symmetric about the ridge. A ship towing a magnetometer on the surface of the ocean can detect these stripes and infer the age of the ocean floor below. This provides information on the rate at which seafloor has spread in the past.

Radiometric dating of lava flows has been used to establish a &quot;geomagnetic polarity time scale&quot;, part of which is shown in the image. This forms the basis of magnetostratigraphy, a geophysical correlation technique that can be used to date both sedimentary and volcanic sequences as well as the seafloor magnetic anomalies.

=== Earliest appearance ===
Paleomagnetic studies of Paleoarchean lava in Australia and conglomerate in South Africa have concluded that the magnetic field has been present since at least about . In 2024 researchers published evidence from Greenland for the existence of the magnetic field as early as 3,700 million years ago.

=== Future ===

Starting in the late 1800s and throughout the 1900s and later, the overall geomagnetic field has become weaker; the present strong deterioration corresponds to a 10–15% decline and has accelerated since 2000; geomagnetic intensity has declined almost continuously from a maximum 35% above the modern value, from circa year 1 AD. The rate of decrease and the current strength are within the normal range of variation, as shown by the record of past magnetic fields recorded in rocks.

The nature of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field is one of heteroscedastic (seemingly random) fluctuation. An instantaneous measurement of it, or several measurements of it across the span of decades or centuries, are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in the field strength. It has gone up and down in the past for unknown reasons. Also, noting the local intensity of the dipole field (or its fluctuation) is insufficient to characterize Earth&#x27;s magnetic field as a whole, as it is not strictly a dipole field. The dipole component of Earth&#x27;s field can diminish even while the total magnetic field remains the same or increases.

The Earth&#x27;s magnetic north pole is drifting from northern Canada towards Siberia with a presently accelerating rate— per year at the beginning of the 1900s, up to per year in 2003, and since then has only accelerated.

== Physical origin ==
=== Earth&#x27;s core and the geodynamo ===
The Earth&#x27;s magnetic field is believed to be generated by electric currents in the conductive iron alloys of its core, created by convection currents due to heat escaping from the core.

The Earth and most of the planets in the Solar System, as well as the Sun and other stars, all generate magnetic fields through the motion of electrically conducting fluids. The Earth&#x27;s field originates in its core. This is a region of iron alloys extending to about 3400 km (the radius of the Earth is 6370 km). It is divided into a solid inner core, with a radius of 1220 km, and a liquid outer core. The motion of the liquid in the outer core is driven by heat flow from the inner core, which is about , to the core-mantle boundary, which is about . The heat is generated by potential energy released by heavier materials sinking toward the core (planetary differentiation, the iron catastrophe) as well as decay of radioactive elements in the interior. The pattern of flow is organized by the rotation of the Earth and the presence of the solid inner core.

The mechanism by which the Earth generates a magnetic field is known as a geodynamo. The magnetic field is generated by a feedback loop: current loops generate magnetic fields (Ampère&#x27;s circuital law); a changing magnetic field generates an electric field (Faraday&#x27;s law); and the electric and magnetic fields exert a force on the charges that are flowing in currents (the Lorentz force). These effects can be combined in a partial differential equation for the magnetic field called the &quot;magnetic induction equation&quot;,

:formula_1

where is the velocity of the fluid; is the magnetic B-field; and is the magnetic diffusivity, which is the reciprocal of the product of the electrical conductivity and the permeability . The term is the partial derivative of the field with respect to time; is the Laplace operator, is the curl operator, and is the vector product.

The first term on the right hand side of the induction equation is a diffusion term. In a stationary fluid, the magnetic field declines and any concentrations of field spread out. If the Earth&#x27;s dynamo shut off, the dipole part would disappear in a few tens of thousands of years.

In a perfect conductor (formula_2), there would be no diffusion. By Lenz&#x27;s law, any change in the magnetic field would be immediately opposed by currents, so the flux through a given volume of fluid could not change. As the fluid moved, the magnetic field would go with it. The theorem describing this effect is called the &quot;frozen-in-field theorem&quot;. Even in a fluid with a finite conductivity, new field is generated by stretching field lines as the fluid moves in ways that deform it. This process could go on generating new field indefinitely, were it not that as the magnetic field increases in strength, it resists fluid motion.

The motion of the fluid is sustained by convection, motion driven by buoyancy. The temperature increases towards the center of the Earth, and the higher temperature of the fluid lower down makes it buoyant. This buoyancy is enhanced by chemical separation: As the core cools, some of the molten iron solidifies and is plated to the inner core. In the process, lighter elements are left behind in the fluid, making it lighter. This is called &quot;compositional convection&quot;. A Coriolis effect, caused by the overall planetary rotation, tends to organize the flow into rolls aligned along the north–south polar axis.

A dynamo can amplify a magnetic field, but it needs a &quot;seed&quot; field to get it started. For the Earth, this could have been an external magnetic field. Early in its history the Sun went through a T-Tauri phase in which the solar wind would have had a magnetic field orders of magnitude larger than the present solar wind. However, much of the field may have been screened out by the Earth&#x27;s mantle. An alternative source is currents in the core-mantle boundary driven by chemical reactions or variations in thermal or electric conductivity. Such effects may still provide a small bias that are part of the boundary conditions for the geodynamo.

The average magnetic field in the Earth&#x27;s outer core was calculated to be 25 gauss, 50 times stronger than the field at the surface.

==== Numerical models ====
Simulating the geodynamo by computer requires numerically solving a set of nonlinear partial differential equations for the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of the Earth&#x27;s interior. Simulation of the MHD equations is performed on a 3D grid of points and the fineness of the grid, which in part determines the realism of the solutions, is limited mainly by computer power. For decades, theorists were confined to creating &quot;kinematic dynamo&quot; computer models in which the fluid motion is chosen in advance and the effect on the magnetic field calculated. Kinematic dynamo theory was mainly a matter of trying different flow geometries and testing whether such geometries could sustain a dynamo.

The first &quot;self-consistent&quot; dynamo models, ones that determine both the fluid motions and the magnetic field, were developed by two groups in 1995, one in Japan and one in the United States. The latter received attention because it successfully reproduced some of the characteristics of the Earth&#x27;s field, including geomagnetic reversals.

=== Effect of ocean tides ===
The oceans contribute to Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Seawater is an electrical conductor, and therefore interacts with the magnetic field. As the tides cycle around the ocean basins, the ocean water essentially tries to pull the geomagnetic field lines along. Because the salty water is only slightly conductive, the interaction is relatively weak: the strongest component is from the regular lunar tide that happens about twice per day (M2). Other contributions come from ocean swell, eddies, and even tsunamis.

The strength of the interaction depends also on the temperature of the ocean water. The entire heat stored in the ocean can now be inferred from observations of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.

=== Currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere ===
Electric currents induced in the ionosphere generate magnetic fields (ionospheric dynamo region). Such a field is always generated near where the atmosphere is closest to the Sun, causing daily alterations that can deflect surface magnetic fields by as much as 1°. Typical daily variations of field strength are about 25 nT (one part in 2000), with variations over a few seconds of typically around 1 nT (one part in 50,000).

== Measurement and analysis ==

=== Detection ===
The Earth&#x27;s magnetic field strength was measured by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1832 and has been repeatedly measured since then, showing a relative decay of about 10% over the last 150 years. The Magsat satellite and later satellites have used 3-axis vector magnetometers to probe the 3-D structure of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. The later Ørsted satellite allowed a comparison indicating a dynamic geodynamo in action that appears to be giving rise to an alternate pole under the Atlantic Ocean west of South Africa.

Governments sometimes operate units that specialize in measurement of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. These are geomagnetic observatories, typically part of a national Geological survey, for example, the British Geological Survey&#x27;s Eskdalemuir Observatory. Such observatories can measure and forecast magnetic conditions such as magnetic storms that sometimes affect communications, electric power, and other human activities.

The International Real-time Magnetic Observatory Network, with over 100 interlinked geomagnetic observatories around the world, has been recording the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field since 1991.

The military determines local geomagnetic field characteristics, in order to detect &quot;anomalies&quot; in the natural background that might be caused by a significant metallic object such as a submerged submarine. Typically, these magnetic anomaly detectors are flown in aircraft like the UK&#x27;s Nimrod or towed as an instrument or an array of instruments from surface ships.

Commercially, geophysical prospecting companies also use magnetic detectors to identify naturally occurring anomalies from ore bodies, such as the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly.

=== Crustal magnetic anomalies ===

Magnetometers detect minute deviations in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field caused by iron artifacts, kilns, some types of stone structures, and even ditches and middens in archaeological geophysics. Using magnetic instruments adapted from airborne magnetic anomaly detectors developed during World War II to detect submarines, the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have been mapped. Basalt — the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor — contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners as early as the late 18th century. More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.

=== Statistical models ===
Each measurement of the magnetic field is at a particular place and time. If an accurate estimate of the field at some other place and time is needed, the measurements must be converted to a model and the model used to make predictions.

==== Spherical harmonics ====


The most common way of analyzing the global variations in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field is to fit the measurements to a set of spherical harmonics. This was first done by Carl Friedrich Gauss. Spherical harmonics are functions that oscillate over the surface of a sphere. They are the product of two functions, one that depends on latitude and one on longitude. The function of longitude is zero along zero or more great circles passing through the North and South Poles; the number of such &quot;nodal lines&quot; is the absolute value of the &quot;order&quot; . The function of latitude is zero along zero or more latitude circles; this plus the order is equal to the &quot;degree&quot; ℓ. Each harmonic is equivalent to a particular arrangement of magnetic charges at the center of the Earth. A &quot;monopole&quot; is an isolated magnetic charge, which has never been observed. A &quot;dipole&quot; is equivalent to two opposing charges brought close together and a &quot;quadrupole&quot; to two dipoles brought together. A quadrupole field is shown in the lower figure on the right.

Spherical harmonics can represent any scalar field (function of position) that satisfies certain properties. A magnetic field is a vector field, but if it is expressed in Cartesian components , each component is the derivative of the same scalar function called the &quot;magnetic potential&quot;. Analyses of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field use a modified version of the usual spherical harmonics that differ by a multiplicative factor. A least-squares fit to the magnetic field measurements gives the Earth&#x27;s field as the sum of spherical harmonics, each multiplied by the best-fitting &quot;Gauss coefficient&quot; or .

The lowest-degree Gauss coefficient, , gives the contribution of an isolated magnetic charge, so it is zero. The next three coefficients – , , and – determine the direction and magnitude of the dipole contribution. The best fitting dipole is tilted at an angle of about 10° with respect to the rotational axis, as described earlier.

==== Radial dependence ====
Spherical harmonic analysis can be used to distinguish internal from external sources if measurements are available at more than one height (for example, ground observatories and satellites). In that case, each term with coefficient or can be split into two terms: one that decreases with radius as and one that &quot;increases&quot; with radius as . The increasing terms fit the external sources (currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere). However, averaged over a few years the external contributions average to zero.

The remaining terms predict that the potential of a dipole source () drops off as . The magnetic field, being a derivative of the potential, drops off as . Quadrupole terms drop off as , and higher order terms drop off increasingly rapidly with the radius. The radius of the outer core is about half of the radius of the Earth. If the field at the core-mantle boundary is fit to spherical harmonics, the dipole part is smaller by a factor of about 8 at the surface, the quadrupole part by a factor of 16, and so on. Thus, only the components with large wavelengths can be noticeable at the surface. From a variety of arguments, it is usually assumed that only terms up to degree or less have their origin in the core. These have wavelengths of about or less. Smaller features are attributed to crustal anomalies.

==== Global models ====
The International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy maintains a standard global field model called the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF). It is updated every five years. The 11th-generation model, IGRF11, was developed using data from satellites (Ørsted, CHAMP and SAC-C) and a world network of geomagnetic observatories. The spherical harmonic expansion was truncated at degree 10, with 120 coefficients, until 2000. Subsequent models are truncated at degree 13 (195 coefficients).

Another global field model, called the World Magnetic Model, is produced jointly by the United States National Centers for Environmental Information (formerly the National Geophysical Data Center) and the British Geological Survey. This model truncates at degree 12 (168 coefficients) with an approximate spatial resolution of 3,000 kilometers. It is the model used by the United States Department of Defense, the Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom), the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the International Hydrographic Organization as well as in many civilian navigation systems.

The above models only take into account the &quot;main field&quot; at the core-mantle boundary. Although generally good enough for navigation, higher-accuracy use cases require smaller-scale magnetic anomalies and other variations to be considered. Some examples are (see geomag.us ref for more):
* The &quot;comprehensive modeling&quot; (CM) approach by the Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA and GSFC) and the Danish Space Research Institute. CM attempts to reconcile data with greatly varying temporal and spatial resolution from ground and satellite sources. The latest version as of 2022 is CM5 of 2016. It provides separate components for main field plus lithosphere (crustal), M2 tidal, and primary/induced magnetosphere/ionosphere variations.
* The US National Centers for Environmental Information developed the Enhanced Magnetic Model (EMM), which extends to degree and order 790 and resolves magnetic anomalies down to a wavelength of 56 kilometers. It was compiled from satellite, marine, aeromagnetic and ground magnetic surveys. , the latest version, EMM2017, includes data from The European Space Agency&#x27;s Swarm satellite mission.

For historical data about the main field, the IGRF may be used back to year 1900. A specialized GUFM1 model estimates back to year 1590 using ship&#x27;s logs. Paleomagnetic research has produced models dating back to 10,000 BCE.

== Biomagnetism ==

Animals, including birds and turtles, can detect the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, and use the field to navigate during migration. Some researchers have found that cows and wild deer tend to align their bodies north–south while relaxing, but not when the animals are under high-voltage power lines, suggesting that magnetism is responsible. Other researchers reported in 2011 that they could not replicate those findings using different Google Earth images.

Very weak electromagnetic fields disrupt the magnetic compass used by European robins and other songbirds, which use the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field to navigate. Neither power lines nor cellphone signals are to blame for the electromagnetic field effect on the birds; instead, the culprits have frequencies between 2 kHz and 5 MHz. These include AM radio signals and ordinary electronic equipment that might be found in businesses or private homes.

<text>A tournament is a competition involving at least three competitors, all participating in a sport or game. More specifically, the term may be used in either of two overlapping senses:
# One or more competitions held at a single venue and concentrated into a relatively short time interval.
# A competition involving a number of matches, each involving a subset of the competitors, with the overall tournament winner determined based on the combined results of these individual matches. These are common in those sports and games where each match must involve a small number of competitors: often precisely two, as in most team sports, racket sports and combat sports, many card games and board games, and many forms of competitive debating. Such tournaments allow large numbers to compete against each other in spite of the restriction on numbers in a single match.

These two senses are distinct. All golf tournaments meet the first definition, but while match play tournaments meet the second, stroke play tournaments do not, since there are no distinct matches within the tournament. In contrast, association football leagues like the Premier League are tournaments in the second sense, but not the first, having matches spread across many venues over a period of up to a season. Many tournaments meet both definitions; for example, the Wimbledon tennis championship. Tournaments &quot;are temporally demarcated events, participation in which confers levels of status and prestige amongst all participating members&quot;.

A tournament-match (or tie or fixture or heat) may involve one or more game-matches (or rubbers or legs) and if necessary one or more tiebreak-matches between the competitors. For example, in the Davis Cup tennis tournament, a tie between two nations involves five rubbers between the nations&#x27; players. The team that wins the most rubbers wins the tie. In the later rounds of UEFA Champions League, each fixture is played over two legs. The scores of each leg are added, and the team with the higher aggregate score wins the fixture, with extra time, and if necessary, a penalty shoot-out used if the scores are level after both matches conclude. In this case, the first tiebreak-match is extra time (modified game-match with reduced duration) and the second tiebreak-match is a penalty shoot-out. 

==Knockout tournaments==
A knockout tournament or elimination tournament is divided into successive rounds; each competitor plays in at least one fixture per round. The top-ranked competitors in each fixture progress to the next round. As rounds progress, the number of competitors and fixtures decreases. The final round, usually known as the final or cup final, consists of just one fixture; the winner of which is the overall champion.
In a single-elimination tournament, only the top-ranked competitors in a fixture progress; in 2-competitor games, only the winner progresses. All other competitors are eliminated. This ensures a winner is decided with the minimum number of fixtures. However, most competitors will be eliminated after relatively few matches; a single bad or unlucky performance can nullify many preceding excellent ones.

A double-elimination tournament may be used in 2-competitor games to allow each competitor a single loss without being eliminated from the tournament. All losers from the main bracket enter a losers&#x27; bracket, the winner of which plays off against the main bracket&#x27;s winner.

A triple-elimination tournament allows a competitor to lose two games and creates a third bracket or fourth bracket which are usually followed by a playoff. It is commonly used in curling tournaments.

Some elimination tournaments are in a best-of-&quot;n&quot; series, requiring a competitor to lose a majority of &quot;n&quot; games (in a series against the same opponent) before being eliminated (e.g. in a best-of-7 games series, the winner must win 4 games).

Some formats use a repechage, allowing losers to play extra rounds before re-entering the main competition in a later round. Rowing regattas often have repechage rounds for the &quot;fastest loser&quot; from the heats. The winners of these progress, but are at a disadvantage in later rounds owing to the extra effort expended during the repechage.

A family of tournament systems that grew from a system devised for the Victorian Football League, the historic predecessor to the Australian Football League (AFL), allow the teams with the best record before the playoffs to lose a game without being eliminated, whereas lesser qualifiers are not. Several of the most prominent leagues in Australia use such a system, such as the AFL and the National Rugby League in rugby league. The A-League of association football also used such a system through its 2011–12 season, but now uses a pure knockout playoff. Similar systems are used in cricket&#x27;s Indian Premier League and most curling tournaments, and were also used by the Super League of European rugby league before being scrapped after the 2014 season.

In athletics meetings, fastest losers may progress in a running event held over several rounds; e.g. the qualifiers for a later round might be the first 4 from each of 6 heats, plus the 8 fastest losers from among the remaining runners.

An extreme form of the knockout tournament is the stepladder format where the strongest team (or individual, depending on the sport) is assured of a berth at the final round while the next strongest teams are given byes according to their strength/seeds; for example, in a four team tournament, the fourth and third seed figure in the first round, then the winner goes to the semifinals against the second seed, while the survivor faces the first seed at the final. Four American sports organizations either currently use this format, or have in the past:
* Since the mid-1960s, most ten-pin bowling events use a stepladder final, usually involving five bowlers.
* Two U.S. college conferences operate a tournament format in basketball that combines two stepladder tournaments into one—that is, both halves of the bracket are organized as stepladder tournaments. When eight teams are involved in the tournament, the bottom four teams play in the first round; the survivors will face the #3 and #4 seeds, and the winners of those matches take on the top two seeds in the semifinals. This format was used by the West Coast Conference (WCC) for its men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tournaments from 2003 through 2013, and has been used by the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) for men since 2011 and women from 2011 through 2014. From 2019 forward, the WCC tournaments will return to the aforementioned format, but add an extra round so that all 10 current conference members will participate (the OVC tournament does not involve all of the league&#x27;s members, currently 12).
* In the Philippines, the UAAP Basketball Championship and the NCAA Basketball Championship both use the stepladder format if a team wins all elimination round (group stage) games. This format has been adopted to other sports in both leagues, and to other leagues. If no team wins all elimination round games, the playoffs remain in the usual two-round playoff format.
* The now-defunct Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer used this format in all of its three seasons of existence. For an example of its playoff system, see 2009 Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer Playoffs.

==Group tournaments==
A group tournament, league, division or conference involves all competitors playing a number of &quot;fixtures&quot; (again, a fixture is one name for a tournament-match that determines who, out of two or three or more, will advance; a fixture may consist of one or more game-matches between competitors). Points are awarded for each fixture, with competitors ranked based either on total number of points or average points per fixture. Usually each competitor plays an equal number of fixtures, in which case rankings by total points and by average points are equivalent. The English County Championship in cricket did not require an equal number of matches prior to 1963.

In a round-robin tournament, each competitor plays all the others an equal number of times, once in a single round-robin tournament and twice in a double round-robin tournament. This is often seen as producing the most reliable rankings. However, for large numbers of competitors it may require an unfeasibly large number of rounds. A Swiss system tournament attempts to determine a winner reliably, based on a smaller number of fixtures. Unlike regular Groups format, fixtures are scheduled one round at a time and depending on the results of the previous one; a competitor will play another who has a similar record in previous rounds of the tournament. This allows the top (and bottom) competitors to be determined with fewer rounds than a round-robin, though the middle rankings are unreliable.

For clarification, this means in hypothesis UEFA adopts a Swiss System for UEFA Champions League, the second matchday in the first stage (today&#x27;s Groups Stage) would depend on the results of the first matchday of the same stage, the third matchday would depend on the results of both the first and the second matchday, and so on, in contrast to the predetermination of all Groups Stage fixtures upon the initial draw.

Another tournament system that attempts to reduce the number of fixtures per competitor is the Pot System. Under that system, competitors are divided to different &quot;pots&quot; based on predetermined ranking and are drawn to play one rival from each pot, including their own pot. For example, in a 36-team World Cup, teams would be divided into 3 pots, with each team playing 3 matches - one against a Pot A team, one against Pot B team, and one against a team from Pot C. All teams are then placed in one general standing the defines qualification to the following stage.

There may be other considerations besides reliability of rankings. In some professional team sports, weaker teams are given an easier slate of fixtures as a form of handicapping. Sometimes schedules are weighted in favour of local derbies or other traditional rivalries. For example, NFL teams play two games against each of the other three teams in their division, one game against six of the other twelve teams in their conference, and one game against five of the sixteen teams in the other conference.

American sports are also unusual in providing fixtures between competitors who are, for ranking purposes, in different groups. Another, systematic, example of this was the 2006 Women&#x27;s Rugby World Cup: each of the teams in Group A played each of the teams in Group B, with the groups ranked separately based on the results. (Groups C and D intertwined similarly.) An elaboration of this system is the Mitchell movement in duplicate bridge, discussed below, where north–south pairs play east–west pairs.
In 2-competitor games where ties are rare or impossible, competitors are typically ranked by number of wins, with ties counting half; each competitors&#x27; listings are usually ordered Wins–Losses(–Ties). Where ties are more common, this may be 2 points for a win and 1 for a tie, which is mathematically equivalent but avoids having too many half-points in the listings, or 3 points for a win and 1 for a tie, which de-emphasizes ties in favor of playing to a decisive result. These are usually ordered Wins–Ties–Losses. If there are more than two competitors per fixture, points may be ordinal (for example, 3 for first, 2 for second, 1 for third).

==General requirements for tournaments==

The primary objective of a tournament is to determine the winner of a competition. Ideally, the tournament should be designed in such a way that all participants have an equal chance to compete and progress, regardless of factors like seeding or scheduling. The influence of luck or chance on the results should be minimised. The tournament should also be an exciting and engaging event for participants and spectators. Hence the following requirements for an ideal tournament:

* The tournament should determine the actually best competitor as the competition winner with the greatest possible probability. The final rankings should also reflect the true strength of the competitors as accurately as possible. (For example, the round-robin tournament is significantly better than the single-elimination tournament in these respects). 

* The tournament should ensure the decisive importance of each match for the final ranking. Meaningless matches for one or both participants, tactical results, collusion at the expense of third parties should be excluded by the rules of the tournament. (This is always fulfilled in the single-elimination tournament, but usually not in the last rounds of the round-robin tournament).

* Other general framework conditions should also be as equal as possible for all competitors. For example, all competitors should have approximately the same regeneration time between matches. As a consequence, both participants playing a match should, as a rule, have played the same number of matches in the tournament so far. (Not fulfilled in the double-elimination tournament)

* Tiebreak criteria should be transparent and based on sporting merit only. (Problematic in the round-robin tournament and in the Swiss system tournament)

* For the spectators, exciting matches between the best pretenders to the championship are desirable. Therefore, the proportion of such games should be as high as possible.

* The winner of the competition is to be determined at the end of the tournament in a final of the two best competitors.

* The tournament should correspond to the sport-specific, organisational and temporal framework conditions of the specific competition, e.g. competition duration, minimum and maximum number of matches in total and individually for each competitor, etc.

==Multi-stage tournaments==

Many tournaments are held in multiple stages, with the top teams in one stage progressing to the next. American professional team sports have a &quot;regular season&quot; (group tournament) acting as qualification for the &quot;post season&quot; or &quot;playoffs&quot; (single-elimination tournament). A group stage (also known as pool play or the pool stage) is a round-robin stage in a multi-stage tournament. The competitors are divided into multiple groups, which play separate round-robins in parallel. Measured by a points-based ranking system, the top competitors in each group qualify for the next stage. In most editions of the FIFA World Cup finals tournament, the first round has been a group stage with groups of four teams, the top two qualifying for the &quot;knockout stage&quot; played as a single-elimination tournament. This format is common in many international team events, such as World Cups or Olympic tournaments. Some tournaments have two group stages, for example the 1982 FIFA World Cup or the 1999–2000 UEFA Champions League. As well as a fixed number of qualifiers from each group, some may be determined by comparing between different groups: at the 1986 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016, the best four of six third-place sides qualified; at the 1999 Rugby World Cup the best one of five third-place sides did so.

Formerly in the Swiss Football League, teams played a double round-robin, at which point they were split into a top &quot;championship&quot; group and a bottom &quot;relegation&quot; group; each played a separate double round-robin, with results of all 32 matches counting for ranking each group. A similar system is also used by the Scottish Premiership and its historic predecessor, the Scottish Premier League, since 2000. After 33 games, when every club has played every other club three times, the division is split into two halves. Clubs play a further five matches, against the teams in their half of the division. This can (and often does) result in the team placed seventh having a higher points total than the team placed sixth (because their final five games are considerably easier), nevertheless, a team in the bottom half never receives a higher final ranking than a team which qualified for the top half.

A multi-stage pool system was implemented by Curling Canada for the Canadian championship curling tournaments (the Scotties Tournament of Hearts for women and the Montana&#x27;s Brier for men) starting in 2018. The change was intended to allow the expansion of the main stage of the tournament from twelve to sixteen teams while keeping the round robin at eleven games. The teams are seeded using a ranking system in which points are calculated based on the teams&#x27; results in all competitive bonspiels using a complicated formula. Seeds 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 16 and placed in Pool A while seeds 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14 and 15 are placed in Pool B. After each team has played seven games, the top four teams from each pool advance to the &quot;Championship Pool&quot;. Carrying over their entire round robin records with them, Championship Pool teams play one game against each of the four teams in the opposite pool, with the top four teams qualifying for the page playoffs. In contrast, teams that fail to qualify for the Championship Pool play only one additional &quot;Placement Round&quot; game against the team that finished in the same position in the opposite pool for the purposes of determining final tournament ranking. For these teams, there is little else to play for since there is no form of relegation (and, with the expansion of the field to sixteen teams, no &quot;pre-qualifying tournament&quot;) and seeding is based solely on the performances of the participating teams and not the past results of the provinces and territories they represent.

The top Slovenian basketball league has a unique system. In its first phase, 12 of the league&#x27;s 13 clubs compete in a full home-and-away season, with the country&#x27;s representative in the Euroleague (an elite pan-European club competition) exempt. The league then splits. The top seven teams are joined by the Euroleague representative for a second home-and-away season, with no results carrying over from the first phase. These eight teams compete for four spots in a final playoff. The bottom five teams play their own home-and-away league, but their previous results &quot;do&quot; carry over. These teams are competing to avoid relegation, with the bottom team automatically relegated and the second-from-bottom team forced to play a mini-league with the second- and third-place teams from the second level for a place in the top league.

=== Super 6s/ Super 8s ===
Sometimes, results from an earlier phase are carried over into a later phase. At the Cricket World Cup, the second stage after group stage, known as Super 6s, features three teams from two preliminary groups, total six teams into one same group. At this stage the qualified teams do not replay the others they have already played, but instead reuse the original results in the new league table, to determine the teams qualified for the knockouts. However, in the T20 World Cup (T20Is; the other format of cricket), the second stage after group stage, is known as Super 8s, which features two teams from four preliminary groups divided into two groups of four which then play a single round-robin in each of the two groups respectively, to progress in the knockout stage.

==Promotion and relegation==

Where the number of competitors is larger than a tournament format permits, there may be multiple tournaments held in parallel, with competitors assigned to a particular tournament based on their ranking. In Chess, Scrabble, and many other individual games, many tournaments over one or more years contribute to a player&#x27;s ranking. However, many team sports involve teams in only one major tournament per year. In European sport, including football, this constitutes the sole ranking for the following season; the top teams from each division of the league are promoted to a higher division, while the bottom teams from a higher division are relegated to a lower one.

This promotion and relegation occurs mainly in league tournaments, but also features in Davis Cup and Fed Cup tennis:
* In the Davis Cup:
** The first-round losers in the top-level World Group compete in playoff ties against the winners of the second-round ties in Group I of the competition&#x27;s three regional zones, with the winners of each playoff tie remaining in or promoted to the World Group.
** In the three regional zones, Group II is conducted in a knockout format. The winner of the knockout tournament is promoted to Group I of its zone. The first-round losers then play relegation ties, with the losers relegated to Group III.
** Groups III and IV in each zone are contested in a round-robin format. The top two teams in each group are promoted, while the bottom two teams are relegated (assuming there is a lower group in their zone).
* In the Fed Cup:
** The four first-round losers in World Group I compete in playoff ties against the four winners in World Group II, with the winners remaining in or promoted to World Group I.
** The losers in World Group II play ties against the four zonal Group I winners (two from Europe/Africa and one each from Asia/Oceania and Americas), with the winners playing in World Group II the following season.
** Groups I and II in all zones, plus Group III in the Europe/Africa Zone only, are conducted in a round-robin format. The bottom two teams in each group are relegated to the next group down, assuming one exists, while the top two teams in Groups II and III are promoted to the next-higher group.

The hierarchy of divisions may be linear, or tree-like, as with the English football league pyramid.

==Bridge tournaments==

In contract bridge a &quot;tournament&quot; is a tournament in the first sense above, composed of multiple &quot;events&quot;, which are tournaments in the second sense. Some events may be single-elimination, double-elimination, or Swiss style. However, &quot;Pair events&quot; are the most widespread. In these events, a number of deals (or &quot;boards&quot;) are each played several times by different players. For each such board the score achieved by each north–south (NS) pair is then measured against all the other NS pairs playing the same board. Thus pairs are rewarded for playing the same cards better than others have played them. There is a predetermined schedule of fixtures depending on the number of pairs and boards to be played, to ensure a good mix of opponents, and that no pair plays the same board or the same opponents twice (see duplicate bridge movements).

==Poker tournaments==
In poker tournaments, as players are eliminated, the number of tables is gradually reduced, with the remaining players redistributed among the remaining tables. Play continues until one player has won all of the chips in play. Finishing order is determined by the order in which players are eliminated: last player remaining gets first place, last player eliminated gets second, previous player eliminated gets third, etc.

In a &quot;shootout&quot; tournament, players do not change tables until every table has been reduced to one player.

==Alternatives to tournament systems==
While tournament structures attempt to provide an objective format for determining the best competitor in a game or sport, other methods exist.

;Challenge: In this format, champions retain their title until they are defeated by an opponent, known as the &quot;challenger&quot;. This system is used in professional boxing (see lineal championship), and the World Chess Championship. The right to become a contender may be awarded through a tournament, as in chess, or through a ranking system: the ranking systems used by boxing&#x27;s governing bodies are controversial and opaque. If the champion retires or dies, then the current top challenger may be declared champion or the title may be vacant until a match between two challengers is held. Prior to 1920, the reigning Wimbledon champion received a bye to the final; the official name of the FA Challenge Cup reflects a similar arrangement which applied only in that tournament&#x27;s very early years. The America&#x27;s Cup is decided between the winners of separate champion and challenger tournaments, respectively for yachts from the country of the reigning champion, and of all other countries. The Ranfurly Shield in New Zealand rugby union is a challenge trophy between provincial teams, in which the holders of the Shield retain it until they are beaten by a challenging province.

;Ladder tournament: The ladder is an extension of the challenge system. All competitors are ranked on a &quot;ladder&quot;. New contestants join the bottom of the ladder. Any contestant can challenge a competitor ranked slightly higher; if the challenger wins the match (or the challenge is refused) they swap places on the ladder. Ladders are common in internal club competitions in individual sports, like squash and pool. Another ladder system is to give competitors a certain number of ranking points at the start. If two competitors play each other, then the winner will gain a percentage of the loser&#x27;s ranking points. In this way competitors that join later will generally start in the middle, since top competitors already have won ranking points and bottom competitors have lost them.

;Selection: A champion may be selected by an authorised or self-appointed group, often after a vote. While common in non-competitive activities, ranging from science fairs to cinema&#x27;s Oscars, this is rarely significant in sports and games. Though unofficial, the polls run by the Associated Press and others were prestigious titles in American college football prior to the creation in 1998 of the Bowl Championship Series, a quasi-official national championship (to this day, the NCAA does not officially award a championship in the top division of college football). From 2005 until the final season of the BCS in 2013, the AP Poll operated independently from the BCS, and two other polls were part of the BCS formula. The BCS was replaced by the College Football Playoff, a four-team tournament whose participants are chosen by a selection committee, in 2014; since then, all polls have operated independently from the CFP.

==Tournaments of value==
Tournaments of value have come to legitimise what are often seen as marginalised practices that sit outside of popular culture. For example, the Grammy Award ceremony helped to shape country music as a viable commercial field, and Booker Prize ceremony helped to create new fields of literary fiction. Tournaments of value go beyond game show and simple contests as the tournament itself emerges as being more significant, bestowing status and prestige on the winner and, in the process, shapes industry practices and acts as institutional mechanisms for shaping social fields.

==Satellite tournament==

A satellite tournament is either a minor tournament or event on a competitive sporting tour or one of a group of such tournaments that form a series played in the same country or region.

===Poker===
A satellite tournament in poker is a qualifying event. Winners of these satellites usually win the buy-in fee to a larger, more prestigious tournament like the World Series of Poker Main Event. Although there are some land-based satellite tournaments (usually for very high-stakes tournaments), most of them are online-based. Some sites, like PokerStars, maintain several tiers of satellites. A player can thus start out at one tier (not necessarily the lowest one) and play their way to a higher tier. The entry fee for each tier is always higher than the fee for the tier below it, with the first tier being the cheapest.

===Tennis===
In professional tennis, satellite circuits were four-week tournaments (five before 1987), typically organised by a country&#x27;s national tennis association and overseen by the International Tennis Federation. They were played by players who were ranked outside the top few hundred by the Association of Tennis Professionals, with openings for unranked players in the qualifying draw. Total prize money ranged from $25,000 to $75,000 per circuit. ATP points were awarded on the basis of a player&#x27;s ranking within the circuit and from 1987 onwards on the basis of the conversion of a player&#x27;s circuit points into ATP points. Players successful at this level of pro tennis would move on to play ATP Challenger Series or even top-flight ATP Tour events. The men&#x27;s satellite tournaments began as early as 1971 such as the Pacific Southwest Satellite played in Inglewood, California was a standalone event won by Mike Estep, and were officially the second tier of tournaments after the main tour and predated the introduction of challenger events in 1978, they then became the third tier of events and were discontinued following the 2006 season as the circuit moved exclusively to one-week Futures tournaments, the modern denomination for a satellite tournament.

===Pinball===
A satellite tournament in pinball is modeled after those in poker. It is a smaller tournament that leads up to a major pinball championship, where participants have the opportunity to win their entry into the larger tournament. Applying the satellite tournament concept to pinball was first done by Northwest Pinball and Arcade Show in 2013 to promote both the show and the tournaments at the show. Since then, some other major tournaments have begun using the concept.

<doc id="147003" wikidata="Q190837" url="?curid=147003" title="Hysteresis">
<text>Hysteresis is the dependence of the state of a system on its history. For example, a magnet may have more than one possible magnetic moment in a given magnetic field, depending on how the field changed in the past. Plots of a single component of the moment often form a loop or hysteresis curve, where there are different values of one variable depending on the direction of change of another variable. This history dependence is the basis of memory in a hard disk drive and the remanence that retains a record of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field magnitude in the past. Hysteresis occurs in ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials, as well as in the deformation of rubber bands and shape-memory alloys and many other natural phenomena. In natural systems, it is often associated with irreversible thermodynamic change such as phase transitions and with internal friction; and dissipation is a common side effect.

Hysteresis can be found in physics, chemistry, engineering, biology, and economics. It is incorporated in many artificial systems: for example, in thermostats and Schmitt triggers, it prevents unwanted frequent switching.

Hysteresis can be a dynamic lag between an input and an output that disappears if the input is varied more slowly; this is known as &quot;rate-dependent&quot; hysteresis. However, phenomena such as the magnetic hysteresis loops are mainly &quot;rate-independent&quot;, which makes a durable memory possible.

Systems with hysteresis are nonlinear, and can be mathematically challenging to model. Some hysteretic models, such as the Preisach model (originally applied to ferromagnetism) and the Bouc–Wen model, attempt to capture general features of hysteresis; and there are also phenomenological models for particular phenomena such as the Jiles–Atherton model for ferromagnetism.

It is difficult to define hysteresis precisely. Isaak D. Mayergoyz wrote &quot;...the very meaning of hysteresis varies from one area to another, from paper to paper and from author to author. As a result, a stringent mathematical definition of hysteresis is needed in order to avoid confusion and ambiguity.&quot;.

==Etymology and history==

The term &quot;hysteresis&quot; is derived from , an Ancient Greek word meaning &quot;deficiency&quot; or &quot;lagging behind&quot;. It was coined in 1881 by Sir James Alfred Ewing to describe the behaviour of magnetic materials.

Some early work on describing hysteresis in mechanical systems was performed by James Clerk Maxwell. Subsequently, hysteretic models have received significant attention in the works of Ferenc Preisach (Preisach model of hysteresis), Louis Néel and Douglas Hugh Everett in connection with magnetism and absorption. A more formal mathematical theory of systems with hysteresis was developed in the 1970s by a group of Russian mathematicians led by Mark Krasnosel&#x27;skii.

==Types==

===Rate-dependent===

One type of hysteresis is a lag between input and output. An example is a sinusoidal input that results in a sinusoidal output , but with a phase lag :
:formula_1
Such behavior can occur in linear systems, and a more general form of response is
:formula_2
where formula_3 is the instantaneous response and formula_4 is the impulse response to an impulse that occurred formula_5 time units in the past. In the frequency domain, input and output are related by a complex &quot;generalized susceptibility&quot; that can be computed from formula_6; it is mathematically equivalent to a transfer function in linear filter theory and analogue signal processing.

This kind of hysteresis is often referred to as &quot;rate-dependent hysteresis&quot;. If the input is reduced to zero, the output continues to respond for a finite time. This constitutes a memory of the past, but a limited one because it disappears as the output decays to zero. The phase lag depends on the frequency of the input, and goes to zero as the frequency decreases.

When rate-dependent hysteresis is due to dissipative effects like friction, it is associated with power loss.

===Rate-independent===

Systems with &quot;rate-independent hysteresis&quot; have a &quot;persistent&quot; memory of the past that remains after the transients have died out. The future development of such a system depends on the history of states visited, but does not fade as the events recede into the past. If an input variable cycles from to and back again, the output may be initially but a different value upon return. The values of depend on the path of values that passes through but not on the speed at which it traverses the path. Many authors restrict the term hysteresis to mean only rate-independent hysteresis. Hysteresis effects can be characterized using the Preisach model and the generalized Prandtl−Ishlinskii model.

==In engineering==

===Control systems===

In control systems, hysteresis can be used to filter signals so that the output reacts less rapidly than it otherwise would by taking recent system history into account. For example, a thermostat controlling a heater may switch the heater on when the temperature drops below A, but not turn it off until the temperature rises above B. (For instance, if one wishes to maintain a temperature of 20 °C then one might set the thermostat to turn the heater on when the temperature drops to below 18 °C and off when the temperature exceeds 22 °C).

Similarly, a pressure switch can be designed to exhibit hysteresis, with pressure set-points substituted for temperature thresholds.

===Electronic circuits===
Often, some amount of hysteresis is intentionally added to an electronic circuit to prevent unwanted rapid switching. This and similar techniques are used to compensate for contact bounce in switches, or noise in an electrical signal.

A Schmitt trigger is a simple electronic circuit that exhibits this property.

A latching relay uses a solenoid to actuate a ratcheting mechanism that keeps the relay closed even if power to the relay is terminated.

Some positive feedback from the output to one input of a comparator can increase the natural hysteresis (a function of its gain) it exhibits.

Hysteresis is essential to the workings of some memristors (circuit components which &quot;remember&quot; changes in the current passing through them by changing their resistance).

Hysteresis can be used when connecting arrays of elements such as nanoelectronics, electrochrome cells and memory effect devices using passive matrix addressing. Shortcuts are made between adjacent components (see crosstalk) and the hysteresis helps to keep the components in a particular state while the other components change states. Thus, all rows can be addressed at the same time instead of individually.

In the field of audio electronics, a noise gate often implements hysteresis intentionally to prevent the gate from &quot;chattering&quot; when signals close to its threshold are applied.

===User interface design===

A hysteresis is sometimes intentionally added to computer algorithms. The field of user interface design has borrowed the term hysteresis to refer to times when the state of the user interface intentionally lags behind the apparent user input. For example, a menu that was drawn in response to a mouse-over event may remain on-screen for a brief moment after the mouse has moved out of the trigger region and the menu region. This allows the user to move the mouse directly to an item on the menu, even if part of that direct mouse path is outside of both the trigger region and the menu region. For instance, right-clicking on the desktop in most Windows interfaces will create a menu that exhibits this behavior.

===Aerodynamics===

In aerodynamics, hysteresis can be observed when decreasing the angle of attack of a wing after stall, regarding the lift and drag coefficients. The angle of attack at which the flow on top of the wing reattaches is generally lower than the angle of attack at which the flow separates during the increase of the angle of attack.

===Hydraulics===
Hysteresis can be observed in the stage-flow relationship of a river during rapidly changing conditions such as passing of a flood wave. It is most pronounced in low gradient streams with steep leading edge hydrographs.

===Backlash===

Moving parts within machines, such as the components of a gear train, normally have a small gap between them, to allow movement and lubrication. As a consequence of this gap, any reversal in direction of a drive part will not be passed on immediately to the driven part. This unwanted delay is normally kept as small as practicable, and is usually called backlash. The amount of backlash will increase with time as the surfaces of moving parts wear.

==In mechanics==

===Elastic hysteresis===

In the elastic hysteresis of rubber, the area in the centre of a hysteresis loop is the energy dissipated due to material internal friction.

Elastic hysteresis was one of the first types of hysteresis to be examined.

The effect can be demonstrated using a rubber band with weights attached to it. If the top of a rubber band is hung on a hook and small weights are attached to the bottom of the band one at a time, it will stretch and get longer. As more weights are &quot;loaded&quot; onto it, the band will continue to stretch because the force the weights are exerting on the band is increasing. When each weight is taken off, or &quot;unloaded&quot;, the band will contract as the force is reduced. As the weights are taken off, each weight that produced a specific length as it was loaded onto the band now contracts less, resulting in a slightly longer length as it is unloaded. This is because the band does not obey Hooke&#x27;s law perfectly. The hysteresis loop of an idealized rubber band is shown in the figure.

In terms of force, the rubber band was harder to stretch when it was being loaded than when it was being unloaded. In terms of time, when the band is unloaded, the effect (the length) lagged behind the cause (the force of the weights) because the length has not yet reached the value it had for the same weight during the loading part of the cycle. In terms of energy, more energy was required during the loading than the unloading, the excess energy being dissipated as thermal energy.

Elastic hysteresis is more pronounced when the loading and unloading is done quickly than when it is done slowly. Some materials such as hard metals don&#x27;t show elastic hysteresis under a moderate load, whereas other hard materials like granite and marble do. Materials such as rubber exhibit a high degree of elastic hysteresis.

When the intrinsic hysteresis of rubber is being measured, the material can be considered to behave like a gas. When a rubber band is stretched, it heats up, and if it is suddenly released, it cools down perceptibly. These effects correspond to a large hysteresis from the thermal exchange with the environment and a smaller hysteresis due to internal friction within the rubber. This proper, intrinsic hysteresis can be measured only if the rubber band is thermally isolated.

Small vehicle suspensions using rubber (or other elastomers) can achieve the dual function of springing and damping because rubber, unlike metal springs, has pronounced hysteresis and does not return all the absorbed compression energy on the rebound. Mountain bikes have made use of elastomer suspension, as did the original Mini car.

The primary cause of rolling resistance when a body (such as a ball, tire, or wheel) rolls on a surface is hysteresis. This is attributed to the viscoelastic characteristics of the material of the rolling body.

===Contact angle hysteresis===
The contact angle formed between a liquid and solid phase will exhibit a range of contact angles that are possible. There are two common methods for measuring this range of contact angles. The first method is referred to as the tilting base method. Once a drop is dispensed on the surface with the surface level, the surface is then tilted from 0° to 90°. As the drop is tilted, the downhill side will be in a state of imminent wetting while the uphill side will be in a state of imminent dewetting. As the tilt increases the downhill contact angle will increase and represents the advancing contact angle while the uphill side will decrease; this is the receding contact angle. The values for these angles just prior to the drop releasing will typically represent the advancing and receding contact angles. The difference between these two angles is the contact angle hysteresis.

The second method is often referred to as the add/remove volume method. When the maximum liquid volume is removed from the drop without the interfacial area decreasing the receding contact angle is thus measured. When volume is added to the maximum before the interfacial area increases, this is the advancing contact angle. As with the tilt method, the difference between the advancing and receding contact angles is the contact angle hysteresis. Most researchers prefer the tilt method; the add/remove method requires that a tip or needle stay embedded in the drop which can affect the accuracy of the values, especially the receding contact angle.

=== Bubble shape hysteresis ===
The equilibrium shapes of bubbles expanding and contracting on capillaries (blunt needles) can exhibit hysteresis depending on the relative magnitude of the maximum capillary pressure to ambient pressure, and the relative magnitude of the bubble volume at the maximum capillary pressure to the dead volume in the system. The bubble shape hysteresis is a consequence of gas compressibility, which causes the bubbles to behave differently across expansion and contraction. During expansion, bubbles undergo large non equilibrium jumps in volume, while during contraction the bubbles are more stable and undergo a relatively smaller jump in volume resulting in an asymmetry across expansion and contraction. The bubble shape hysteresis is qualitatively similar to the adsorption hysteresis, and as in the contact angle hysteresis, the interfacial properties play an important role in bubble shape hysteresis.

The existence of the bubble shape hysteresis has important consequences in interfacial rheology experiments involving bubbles. As a result of the hysteresis, not all sizes of the bubbles can be formed on a capillary. Further the gas compressibility causing the hysteresis leads to unintended complications in the phase relation between the applied changes in interfacial area to the expected interfacial stresses. These difficulties can be avoided by designing experimental systems to avoid the bubble shape hysteresis.

===Adsorption hysteresis===
Hysteresis can also occur during physical adsorption processes. In this type of hysteresis, the quantity adsorbed is different when gas is being added than it is when being removed. The specific causes of adsorption hysteresis are still an active area of research, but it is linked to differences in the nucleation and evaporation mechanisms inside mesopores. These mechanisms are further complicated by effects such as cavitation and pore blocking.

In physical adsorption, hysteresis is evidence of mesoporosity-indeed, the definition of mesopores (2–50 nm) is associated with the appearance (50 nm) and disappearance (2 nm) of mesoporosity in nitrogen adsorption isotherms as a function of Kelvin radius. An adsorption isotherm showing hysteresis is said to be of Type IV (for a wetting adsorbate) or Type V (for a non-wetting adsorbate), and hysteresis loops themselves are classified according to how symmetric the loop is. Adsorption hysteresis loops also have the unusual property that it is possible to scan within a hysteresis loop by reversing the direction of adsorption while on a point on the loop. The resulting scans are called &quot;crossing&quot;, &quot;converging&quot;, or &quot;returning&quot;, depending on the shape of the isotherm at this point.

===Matric potential hysteresis===
The relationship between matric water potential and water content is the basis of the water retention curve. Matric potential measurements (Ψm) are converted to volumetric water content (θ) measurements based on a site or soil specific calibration curve. Hysteresis is a source of water content measurement error. Matric potential hysteresis arises from differences in wetting behaviour causing dry medium to re-wet; that is, it depends on the saturation history of the porous medium. Hysteretic behaviour means that, for example, at a matric potential (Ψm) of , the volumetric water content (θ) of a fine sandy soil matrix could be anything between 8% and 25%.

Tensiometers are directly influenced by this type of hysteresis. Two other types of sensors used to measure soil water matric potential are also influenced by hysteresis effects within the sensor itself. Resistance blocks, both nylon and gypsum based, measure matric potential as a function of electrical resistance. The relation between the sensor&#x27;s electrical resistance and sensor matric potential is hysteretic. Thermocouples measure matric potential as a function of heat dissipation. Hysteresis occurs because measured heat dissipation depends on sensor water content, and the sensor water content–matric potential relationship is hysteretic. , only desorption curves are usually measured during calibration of soil moisture sensors. Despite the fact that it can be a source of significant error, the sensor specific effect of hysteresis is generally ignored.

==In materials==

===Magnetic hysteresis===


When an external magnetic field is applied to a ferromagnetic material such as iron, the atomic domains align themselves with it. Even when the field is removed, part of the alignment will be retained: the material has become &quot;magnetized&quot;. Once magnetized, the magnet will stay magnetized indefinitely. To demagnetize it requires heat or a magnetic field in the opposite direction. This is the effect that provides the element of memory in a hard disk drive.

The relationship between field strength and magnetization is not linear in such materials. If a magnet is demagnetized () and the relationship between and is plotted for increasing levels of field strength, follows the &quot;initial magnetization curve&quot;. This curve increases rapidly at first and then approaches an asymptote called magnetic saturation. If the magnetic field is now reduced monotonically, follows a different curve. At zero field strength, the magnetization is offset from the origin by an amount called the remanence. If the relationship is plotted for all strengths of applied magnetic field the result is a hysteresis loop called the &quot;main loop&quot;. The width of the middle section is twice the coercivity of the material.

A closer look at a magnetization curve generally reveals a series of small, random jumps in magnetization called Barkhausen jumps. This effect is due to crystallographic defects such as dislocations.

Magnetic hysteresis loops are not exclusive to materials with ferromagnetic ordering. Other magnetic orderings, such as spin glass ordering, also exhibit this phenomenon.

====Physical origin====

The phenomenon of hysteresis in ferromagnetic materials is the result of two effects: rotation of magnetization and changes in size or number of magnetic domains. In general, the magnetization varies (in direction but not magnitude) across a magnet, but in sufficiently small magnets, it does not. In these single-domain magnets, the magnetization responds to a magnetic field by rotating. Single-domain magnets are used wherever a strong, stable magnetization is needed (for example, magnetic recording).

Larger magnets are divided into regions called &quot;domains&quot;. Across each domain, the magnetization does not vary; but between domains are relatively thin &quot;domain walls&quot; in which the direction of magnetization rotates from the direction of one domain to another. If the magnetic field changes, the walls move, changing the relative sizes of the domains. Because the domains are not magnetized in the same direction, the magnetic moment per unit volume is smaller than it would be in a single-domain magnet; but domain walls involve rotation of only a small part of the magnetization, so it is much easier to change the magnetic moment. The magnetization can also change by addition or subtraction of domains (called &quot;nucleation&quot; and &quot;denucleation&quot;).

====Magnetic hysteresis models====
The most known empirical models in hysteresis are Preisach and Jiles-Atherton models. These models allow an accurate modeling of the hysteresis loop and are widely used in the industry. However, these models lose the connection with thermodynamics and the energy consistency is not ensured. A more recent model, with a more consistent thermodynamical foundation, is the vectorial incremental nonconservative consistent hysteresis (VINCH) model of Lavet et al. (2011)

====Applications====
There are a great variety of applications of the hysteresis in ferromagnets. Many of these make use of their ability to retain a memory, for example magnetic tape, hard disks, and credit cards. In these applications, &quot;hard&quot; magnets (high coercivity) like iron are desirable, such that as much energy is absorbed as possible during the write operation and the resultant magnetized information is not easily erased.

On the other hand, magnetically &quot;soft&quot; (low coercivity) iron is used for the cores in electromagnets. The low coercivity minimizes the energy loss associated with hysteresis, as the magnetic field periodically reverses in the presence of an alternating current. The low energy loss during a hysteresis loop is the reason why soft iron is used for transformer cores and electric motors.

===Electrical hysteresis===

Electrical hysteresis typically occurs in ferroelectric material, where domains of polarization contribute to the total polarization. Polarization is the electrical dipole moment (either C·m−2 or C·m). The mechanism, an organization of the polarization into domains, is similar to that of magnetic hysteresis.

===Liquid–solid-phase transitions===
Hysteresis manifests itself in state transitions when melting temperature and freezing temperature do not agree. For example, agar melts at and solidifies from . This is to say that once agar is melted at 85 °C, it retains a liquid state until cooled to 40 °C. Therefore, from the temperatures of 40 to 85 °C, agar can be either solid or liquid, depending on which state it was before.

==In biology==

===Cell biology and genetics===

Hysteresis in cell biology often follows bistable systems where the same input state can lead to two different, stable outputs. Where bistability can lead to digital, switch-like outputs from the continuous inputs of chemical concentrations and activities, hysteresis makes these systems more resistant to noise. These systems are often characterized by higher values of the input required to switch into a particular state as compared to the input required to stay in the state, allowing for a transition that is not continuously reversible, and thus less susceptible to noise. 

==== Irreversible Hysteresis ====

In the case of mitosis, irreversibility is essential to maintain the overall integrity of the system such that we have three designated checkpoints to account for this: G1/S, G2/M, and the spindle checkpoint. Irreversible hysteresis in this context ensures that once a cell commits to a specific phase (e.g., entering mitosis or DNA replication), it does not revert to a previous phase, even if conditions or regulatory signals change. Based on the irreversible hysteresis curve, there does exist an input at which the cell jumps to the next stable state, but there is no input that allows the cell to revert to its previous stable state, even when the input is 0, demonstrating irreversibility. Positive feedback is critical for generating hysteresis in the cell cycle. For example: In the G2/M transition, active CDK1 promotes the activation of more CDK1 molecules by inhibiting Wee1 (an inhibitor) and activating Cdc25 (a phosphatase that activates CDK1). These loops lock the cell into its current state and amplify the activation of CDK1. Positive feedback also serves to create a bistable system where CDK1 is either fully inactivated or fully activated. Hysteresis prevents the cell from oscillating between these two states from small perturbations in signal (input).

==== Reversible Hysteresis ====

A biochemical system that is under the control of reversible hysteresis has both forward and reverse trajectories. The system generally requires a higher [input] to proceed forward into the next bistable state then to exit from that stage. For example, cells undergoing cell division exhibit reversible hysteresis in that it takes a higher concentration of cyclins to switch them from G2 phase into mitosis than to stay in mitosis once begun.  Additionally, because the [cyclin] required to reverse the cell back to the G2 phase is much lower than the [cycilin] to enter mitosis, this improved the bistability of mitosis because it is more resistance to weak or transient signals. Small perturbations the [input] will be unable to push the cell out of mitosis so easily.

==== History and Memory ====
In systems with bistability, the same input level can correspond to two distinct stable states (e.g., &quot;low output&quot; and &quot;high output&quot;). The actual state of the system depends on its history whether the input level was increasing (forward trajectory) or decreasing (backward trajectory). Thus, it is difficult to determine which state a cell is in if given only a bistability curve. The cell&#x27;s ability to &quot;remember&quot; its prior state ensures stability and prevents it from switching states unnecessarily due to minor fluctuations in input. This memory is often maintained through molecular feedback loops, such as positive feedback in signaling pathways, or the persistence of regulatory molecules like proteins or phosphorylated components. For example, the refractory period in action potentials is primarily controlled by history. Absolute refraction period prevents a volted-gated sodium channel from activating or refiring after it has just fired. This is because following the absolute refractory period, the neuron is less excitable due to hyperpolarization caused by potassium efflux. This molecular inhibitory feedback creates a memory for the neuron or cell, so that the neuron does not fire too soon. As time passes, the neuron or cell will slowly lose the memory of having fired and will begin to fire again. Thus, memory is time-dependent, which is important in maintaining homeostasis and regulating many different biological processes.

==== Biochemical Systems: Regulating the Cell Cycle in Xenopus Laevis Egg Extracts ====
Cells advancing through the cell cycle must make an irreversible commitment to mitosis, ensuring they do not revert to interphase before successfully segregating their chromosomes. A mathematical model of cell-cycle progression in cell-free egg extracts from frogs suggests that hysteresis in the molecular control system drives these irreversible transitions into and out of mitosis. Here, Cdc2 (Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 or CDK1) is responsible for mitotic entry and exit such that binding of cyclin B forms a complex called Maturation-Promoting Factor (MPF). The activation threshold for mitotic entry was found to be between 32 and 40 nM cyclin B in the frog extracts while the inactivation threshold for exiting mitosis was lower, between 16 and 24 nM cyclin B. The higher threshold for mitotic entry compared to the lower threshold for mitotic exit indicates hysteresis, a hallmark of history-dependent behavior in the system. Concentrations between 24 and 32 nM cyclin B demonstrated bistability, where the system could exist in either interphase or mitosis, depending on its prior state (history). Though, the cell cycle is not completely irreversible, the difference in thresholds is enough for growth and survival of the cells.

Hysteric thresholds in biological systems are not definite and can be recalibrated. For example, unreplicated DNA or chromosomes inhibits Cdc25 phosphatase and maintains Wee1 kinase activity. This prevents the activation of Cyclin B-Cdc2, effectively raising the threshold for mitotic entry. As a result, the cell delays the transition to mitosis until replication is complete, ensuring genomic integrity. Other instances may be DNA damage and unattached chromosomes during the spindle assembly checkpoint.

==== Biochemical Systems: Regulating the Cell Cycle in Yeast ====
Biochemical systems can also show hysteresis-like output when slowly varying states that are not directly monitored are involved, as in the case of the cell cycle arrest in yeast exposed to mating pheromone. The proposed model is that α-factor, a yeast mating pheromone binds to its analog receptor on another yeast cell promoting transcription of Fus3 and promoting mating. Fus3 further promotes Far1 which inhibits Cln1/2, activators of the cell cycle. This is representative of a coherent feedforward loop that can modeled as a hysteresis curve.

Far1 transcription is the primary mechanism responsible for the hysteresis observed in cell-cycle reentry. The history of pheromone exposure influences the accumulation of Far1, which, in turn, determines the delay in cell-cycle reentry. Previous pulse experiments demonstrated that after exposure to high pheromone concentrations, cells enter a stabilized arrested state where reentry thresholds are elevated due to increased Far1-dependent inhibition of CDK activity. Even when pheromone levels drop to concentrations that would allow naive cells to reenter the cell cycle, pre-exposed cells take longer to resume proliferation. This delay reflects the history-dependent nature of hysteresis, where past exposure to high pheromone concentrations influences the current state. Hysteresis ensures that cells make robust and irreversible decisions about mating and proliferation in response to pheromone signals. It allows cells to &quot;remember&quot; high pheromone exposure, and this helps yeast cells adapt and stability their responses to environmental conditions, avoiding fast premature reentry into the cell cycle, the moment that pheromone signal dies down.

Additionally, the duration of cell cycle arrest depends not only on the final level of input Fus3, but also on the previously achieved Fus3 levels. This effect is achieved due to the slower time scales involved in the transcription of intermediate Far1, such that the total Far1 activity reaches its equilibrium value slowly, and for transient changes in Fus3 concentration, the response of the system depends on the Far1 concentration achieved with the transient value. Experiments in this type of hysteresis benefit from the ability to change the concentration of the inputs with time. The mechanisms are often elucidated by allowing independent control of the concentration of the key intermediate, for instance, by using an inducible promoter.

Biochemical systems can also show hysteresis-like output when slowly varying states that are not directly monitored are involved, as in the case of the cell cycle arrest in yeast exposed to mating pheromone. Here, the duration of cell cycle arrest depends not only on the final level of input Fus3, but also on the previously achieved Fus3 levels. This effect is achieved due to the slower time scales involved in the transcription of intermediate Far1, such that the total Far1 activity reaches its equilibrium value slowly, and for transient changes in Fus3 concentration, the response of the system depends on the Far1 concentration achieved with the transient value. Experiments in this type of hysteresis benefit from the ability to change the concentration of the inputs with time. The mechanisms are often elucidated by allowing independent control of the concentration of the key intermediate, for instance, by using an inducible promoter.
Darlington in his classic works on genetics discussed hysteresis of the chromosomes, by which he meant &quot;failure of the external form of the chromosomes to respond immediately to the internal stresses due to changes in their molecular spiral&quot;, as they lie in a somewhat rigid medium in the limited space of the cell nucleus.
In developmental biology, cell type diversity is regulated by long range-acting signaling molecules called morphogens that pattern uniform pools of cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The morphogen sonic hedgehog (Shh), for example, acts on limb bud and neural progenitors to induce expression of a set of homeodomain-containing transcription factors to subdivide these tissues into distinct domains. It has been shown that these tissues have a &#x27;memory&#x27; of previous exposure to Shh.
In neural tissue, this hysteresis is regulated by a homeodomain (HD) feedback circuit that amplifies Shh signaling. In this circuit, expression of Gli transcription factors, the executors of the Shh pathway, is suppressed. Glis are processed to repressor forms (GliR) in the absence of Shh, but in the presence of Shh, a proportion of Glis are maintained as full-length proteins allowed to translocate to the nucleus, where they act as activators (GliA) of transcription. By reducing Gli expression then, the HD transcription factors reduce the total amount of Gli (GliT), so a higher proportion of GliT can be stabilized as GliA for the same concentration of Shh.

===Immunology===

There is some evidence that T cells exhibit hysteresis in that it takes a lower signal threshold to activate T cells that have been previously activated. Ras GTPase activation is required for downstream effector functions of activated T cells. Triggering of the T cell receptor induces high levels of Ras activation, which results in higher levels of GTP-bound (active) Ras at the cell surface. Since higher levels of active Ras have accumulated at the cell surface in T cells that have been previously stimulated by strong engagement of the T cell receptor, weaker subsequent T cell receptor signals received shortly afterwards will deliver the same level of activation due to the presence of higher levels of already activated Ras as compared to a naïve cell.

===Neuroscience===

The property by which some neurons do not return to their basal conditions from a stimulated condition immediately after removal of the stimulus is an example of hysteresis.

===Neuropsychology===
Neuropsychology, in exploring the neural correlates of consciousness, interfaces with neuroscience, although the complexity of the central nervous system is a challenge to its study (that is, its operation resists easy reduction). Context-dependent memory and state-dependent memory show hysteretic aspects of neurocognition.

===Respiratory physiology===
Lung hysteresis is evident when observing the compliance of a lung on inspiration versus expiration. The difference in compliance (Δvolume/Δpressure) is due to the additional energy required to overcome surface tension forces during inspiration to recruit and inflate additional alveoli.

The transpulmonary pressure vs Volume curve of inhalation is different from the Pressure vs Volume curve of exhalation, the difference being described as hysteresis. Lung volume at any given pressure during inhalation is less than the lung volume at any given pressure during exhalation.

=== Voice and speech physiology ===
A hysteresis effect may be observed in voicing onset versus offset. The threshold value of the subglottal pressure required to start the vocal fold vibration is lower than the threshold value at which the vibration stops, when other parameters are kept constant. In utterances of vowel-voiceless consonant-vowel sequences during speech, the intraoral pressure is lower at the voice onset of the second vowel compared to the voice offset of the first vowel, the oral airflow is lower, the transglottal pressure is larger and the glottal width is smaller.

===Ecology and epidemiology===

Hysteresis is a commonly encountered phenomenon in ecology and epidemiology, where the observed equilibrium of a system can not be predicted solely based on environmental variables, but also requires knowledge of the system&#x27;s past history. Notable examples include the theory of spruce budworm outbreaks and behavioral-effects on disease transmission.

It is commonly examined in relation to critical transitions between ecosystem or community types in which dominant competitors or entire landscapes can change in a largely irreversible fashion.

==In ocean and climate science==
Complex ocean and climate models rely on the principle.

==In economics==

Economic systems can exhibit hysteresis. For example, export performance is subject to strong hysteresis effects: because of the fixed transportation costs it may take a big push to start a country&#x27;s exports, but once the transition is made, not much may be required to keep them going.

When some negative shock reduces employment in a company or industry, fewer employed workers then remain. As usually the employed workers have the power to set wages, their reduced number incentivizes them to bargain for higher wages when the economy again gets better instead of letting the wage be at the equilibrium wage level, where the supply and demand of workers would match. This causes hysteresis: the unemployment becomes permanently higher after negative shocks.

===Permanently higher unemployment===

The idea of hysteresis is used extensively in the area of labor economics, specifically with reference to the unemployment rate. According to theories based on hysteresis, severe economic downturns (recession) and/or persistent stagnation (slow demand growth, usually after a recession) cause unemployed individuals to lose their job skills (commonly developed on the job) or to find that their skills have become obsolete, or become demotivated, disillusioned or depressed or lose job-seeking skills. In addition, employers may use time spent in unemployment as a screening tool, i.e., to weed out less desired employees in hiring decisions. Then, in times of an economic upturn, recovery, or &quot;boom&quot;, the affected workers will not share in the prosperity, remaining unemployed for long periods (e.g., over 52 weeks). This makes unemployment &quot;structural&quot;, i.e., extremely difficult to reduce simply by increasing the aggregate demand for products and labor without causing increased inflation. That is, it is possible that a ratchet effect in unemployment rates exists, so a short-term rise in unemployment rates tends to persist. For example, traditional anti-inflationary policy (the use of recession to fight inflation) leads to a permanently higher &quot;natural&quot; rate of unemployment (more scientifically known as the NAIRU). This occurs first because inflationary expectations are &quot;sticky&quot; downward due to wage and price rigidities (and so adapt slowly over time rather than being approximately correct as in theories of rational expectations) and second because labor markets do not clear instantly in response to unemployment.

The existence of hysteresis has been put forward as a possible explanation for the persistently high unemployment of many economies in the 1990s. Hysteresis has been invoked by Olivier Blanchard among others to explain the differences in long run unemployment rates between Europe and the United States. Labor market reform (usually meaning institutional change promoting more flexible wages, firing, and hiring) or strong demand-side economic growth may not therefore reduce this pool of long-term unemployed. Thus, specific targeted training programs are presented as a possible policy solution. However, the hysteresis hypothesis suggests such training programs are aided by persistently high demand for products (perhaps with incomes policies to avoid increased inflation), which reduces the transition costs out of unemployment and into paid employment easier.

==Models==

Hysteretic models are mathematical models capable of simulating complex nonlinear behavior (hysteresis) characterizing mechanical systems and materials used in different fields of engineering, such as aerospace, civil, and mechanical engineering. Some examples of mechanical systems and materials having hysteretic behavior are:
* materials, such as steel, reinforced concrete, wood;
* structural elements, such as steel, reinforced concrete, or wood joints;
* devices, such as seismic isolators and dampers.

Each subject that involves hysteresis has models that are specific to the subject. In addition, there are hysteretic models that capture general features of many systems with hysteresis. An example is the Preisach model of hysteresis, which represents a hysteresis nonlinearity as a linear superposition of square loops called non-ideal relays. Many complex models of hysteresis arise from the simple parallel connection, or superposition, of elementary carriers of hysteresis termed hysterons.

A simple and intuitive parametric description of various hysteresis loops may be found in the Lapshin model. Along with the smooth loops, substitution of trapezoidal, triangular or rectangular pulses instead of the harmonic functions allows piecewise-linear hysteresis loops frequently used in discrete automatics to be built in the model. There are implementations of the hysteresis loop model in Mathcad and in R programming language.

The Bouc–Wen model of hysteresis is often used to describe non-linear hysteretic systems. It was introduced by Bouc and extended by Wen, who demonstrated its versatility by producing a variety of hysteretic patterns. This model is able to capture in analytical form, a range of shapes of hysteretic cycles which match the behaviour of a wide class of hysteretical systems; therefore, given its versability and mathematical tractability, the Bouc–Wen model has quickly gained popularity and has been extended and applied to a wide variety of engineering problems, including multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems, buildings, frames, bidirectional and torsional response of hysteretic systems two- and three-dimensional continua, and soil liquefaction among others. The Bouc–Wen model and its variants/extensions have been used in applications of structural control, in particular in the modeling of the behaviour of magnetorheological dampers, base isolation devices for buildings and other kinds of damping devices; it has also been used in the modelling and analysis of structures built of reinforced concrete, steel, masonry and timber.. The most important extension of Bouc-Wen Model was carried out by Baber and Noori and later by Noori and co-workers. That extended model, named, BWBN, can reproduce the complex shear pinching or slip-lock phenomenon that earlier model could not reproduce. The BWBN model has been widely used in a wide spectrum of applications and implementations are available in software such as OpenSees.

Hysteretic models may have a generalized displacement formula_7 as input variable and a generalized force formula_8 as output variable, or vice versa. In particular, in rate-independent hysteretic models, the output variable does not depend on the rate of variation of the input one.

Rate-independent hysteretic models can be classified into four different categories depending on the type of equation that needs to be solved to compute the output variable:
* algebraic models
* transcendental models
* differential models
* integral models

<text>A human shield is a non-combatant (or a group of non-combatants) who either volunteers or is forced to shield a legitimate military target in order to deter the enemy from attacking it.

The concept of human shields as a resistance measure was created by Mahatma Gandhi as a weapon of resistance. 

==Legal background==

Forcing protected persons to serve as human shields is a war crime according to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions, and the 1998 Rome Statute.

According to law professor Eliav Lieblich, &quot;Armed groups might be responsible for harm that they occasion to civilians under their control. But to argue that this absolves the other party from responsibility is to get both law and morality wrong.&quot;

Law professor Adil Ahmad Haque states that involuntary shields &quot;retain their legal and moral protection from intentional, unnecessary, and disproportionate harm.&quot; He argues against the position of the United States Department of Defense (as well as the United Kingdom and some scholars) that attackers may discount or disregard collateral harm in determining proportionality and states that these views are &quot;legally baseless and morally unsound&quot;.

Authors Neve Gordon and Nicola Perugini, elaborating on their book, &quot;Human Shields: A History of People in the Line of Fire&quot;, discuss &quot;proximate shields&quot;, humans as shields merely due to proximity to belligerents and assert that this type has become &quot;by far the most prominent type of shield in contemporary discourse&quot;. They say that the proximate shielding accusation has been used by States to cover-up war crimes against civilian populations and that human rights organizations frequently fail to question this charge which they claim is being improperly used to justify civilian deaths.

==20th century==
===World War I===
Article 23 of the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) states that &quot;A belligerent is forbidden to compel the nationals of the hostile party to take part in the operations of war directed against their own country&quot;. The 1915 report says &quot;If it be not permissible to compel a man to fire on his fellow citizens, neither can he be forced to protect the enemy and to serve as a living screen&quot;.

===Italian invasion of Ethiopia===
During the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, the army of Fascist Italy systematically bombed medical facilities in Ethiopia operated by various Red Cross societies. Italy accused Ethiopia of using hospitals to hide weapons and fighters.

===1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine===
In the British mandate of Palestine, Arab civilians and rebels who were captured by the British during the Great Arab Revolt were frequently taken and placed on &quot;pony trucks&quot;, &quot;on which hostages could be made to sit&quot;; these were placed at the front of trains to deter other rebels from detonating explosives on the railways. A soldier with the Manchester Regiment described the technique:
They would &quot;go down to Acre jail and borrow say five rebels, three rebels, and you&#x27;d sit them on the bonnet, so the guy up in the hill could see an Arab on the truck so he wouldn&#x27;t blow it… If [the rebel] was unlucky the truck coming up behind would hit him. But nobody bothered to pick the bits up. They were left.&quot;

The practice began on 24 September 1936 when Brigadier J. F. Evetts reacted to Palestinian rebel attacks against British positions in Nablus by forcing the city mayor, Suleiman Abdul Razzaq Tuqan, to sit exposed on the roof of a garrison building under fire, as a &#x27;high-value human shield&#x27;. Tuqan returned his Order of the British Empire commendation in protest.

===World War II===
On 14 August 1937, in what would become the first major battle of World War II in Asia between China and the occupying forces of the Empire of Japan at the Battle of Shanghai, the Imperial Japanese Navy berthed their flagship &quot;Izumo&quot; in front of the Shanghai International Settlement; it is believed in what would become known as &quot;Black Saturday&quot;, Chinese Air Force Gamma 2E bomber pilots targeted the Japanese warship, but had to release the bombs at a much lower altitude than they usually trained for due to low cloud ceiling, and did not properly reset their bomb sights, which resulted in two of the 1,100 lb bombs falling short and landing on the adjacent International Settlement (one failing to explode) and killing at least 950 Chinese civilians, foreigners and refugees.

After World War II, it was claimed by SS general Gottlob Berger that there was a plan, proposed by the Luftwaffe and approved by Adolf Hitler, to set up special POW camps for captured airmen of the Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces in large German cities, to act as human shields against their bombing raids. Berger realized that this would contravene the 1929 Geneva Convention and argued that there was not enough barbed wire—as a result, this plan was not implemented.

Wehrmacht and later SS forces extensively used Polish civilians as human shields during Warsaw Uprising when attacking the insurgents&#x27; positions. In the Wola massacre in Poland on 7 August 1944, the Nazis forced civilian women onto the armored vehicles as human shields to enhance their effectiveness.

In Belgium in May 1940, at least 86 civilians were killed by the German Wehrmacht in an event known as the Vinkt Massacre, when the Germans took 140 civilians and used them as shields to cross a bridge while under fire by Belgian forces. As the battle progressed, German soldiers began executing hostages.

During the Battle of Okinawa and the Battle of Manila, Japanese soldiers often used civilians as human shields against American troops.

When the Japanese were concerned about the incoming Allied air raids on their home islands as they were losing their controlled Pacific islands one by one to the Allies in the Pacific War, they scattered major military installations and factories throughout urban areas. Historians argued that this meant Japan was using its civilians as human shields to protect their legitimate military targets against Allied bombardment. As a result, the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) was unable to strike purely military targets due to the limitations of their bombsight, the mixing of military installations and factories with urban areas, and the widespread cottage industry in Japan&#x27;s cities. This led the USAAF in early 1945 to switch from precision bombing to carpet bombing, which destroyed 67 Japanese cities with incendiary bombs, and ultimately led to the use of atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

===Decolonization of India===
Indian revolutionary Mahatma Gandhi is credited with creating the concept of human shield as a tool of resistance.

===Algerian War===

In 1960s Algeria, during the Algerian War, France used civilians as hostages and human shields in its fight against the National Liberation Army.

===Iraqi–Kurdish conflict===

In 1963, a Ba&#x27;athist tank unit in Kirkuk covered its assault on a Kurdish suburb with a human shield of Kurdish women and children.

===Korean War===
In the Battle of the Notch, North Korean forces were claimed to have used captured U.S. soldiers as human shields while advancing.

===Lebanese Civil War===

In August 1976, at the Siege of Tel al-Zaatar, Christian Lebanese militias alleged that the Palestinians at Tel al-Zaatar were using Lebanese families inside the camp as human shields.

===1982 Lebanon War===
During the 1982 Lebanon War, the Palestinian refugee camp of Ain al-Hilweh was surrounded by Israeli forces as the last stronghold of Palestinian militants in southern Lebanon, but &quot;Soldiers of Allah&quot; militants commanded by the Muslim fundamentalist Haj Ibrahim refused to surrender: Their motto was &quot;Victory or death!&quot; Over a two-day period, Israeli forces under the leadership of Brigadier General Yitzhak Mordechai repeatedly announced &quot;Whoever does not bear arms will not be harmed&quot; and urged civilians in the camp to evacuate, but few did. Three delegations of prominent Sidon figures were sent to persuade Haj Ibrahim&#x27;s fighters that &quot;their cause was hopeless, and whoever was willing to lay down his arms would be allowed to leave the camp unharmed.&quot; None of the delegations were successful; the first was prevented from approaching the fighters by &quot;a spray of bullets&quot;, while the third &quot;returned with the most harrowing tale of all&quot;: &quot;Militiamen were shooting civilians who tried to escape. In one particularly grisly incident, three children were shot because their father had suggested calling an end to the fighting.&quot; After a delegation of Palestinian POWs, &quot;headed by a PLO officer who was prepared to give the defenders his professional assessment of Ein Hilweh&#x27;s grave military situation&quot;, and an offer by Mordechai to &quot;meet personally with&quot; Haj Ibrahim were also rebuffed, &quot;a team of psychologists ... was flown to Sidon to advise the command on how to deal with such irrational behavior.&quot; However, &quot;the best advice the psychologists could offer was to organize yet another but considerably larger delegation comprising some forty or so people and including women and children&quot;; Haj Ibrahim responded to the fifth delegation with &quot;exactly the same three words&quot;; triggering a bloody battle in which Israeli troops finally took the camp.

According to 1982 Newsweek photo, Israeli soldiers were attacked by PLO fighters disguised as hospital patients.

===Bangladesh===
During the Chittagong Hill Tracts conflict in the 1970s, an account tells that throughout the conflict, the military burned the homes of the Jummas, carried out mass killings and rape of Jumma women, and placed Bengali settlers as human shields on the land of the Jummas near the military camps.

===Iraq under Saddam Hussein===

Saddam Hussein systematically used human shields in Iraq. According to a CIA report, he used the tactics at least since 1988.

====Gulf War====
One of the most well-known uses of human shields occurred in Iraq in 1990, following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait that precipitated the Gulf War of 1990–1991. Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government detained hundreds of citizens of Western countries who were in Iraq for use as human shields in an attempt to deter nations from participating in military operations against the country. A number of these hostages were filmed meeting Hussein, and kept with him to deter any targeted attacks, whilst others were held in or near military and industrial targets. He used both Westerners and Iraqi civilians.

In 1991, during the operations in the Gulf War, the U.S. submitted a report to the UN Security Council denouncing Iraq for having &quot;intentionally placed civilians at risk through its behavior&quot;. The report cited the following examples of such behavior:

*The Iraqi government moved significant amounts of military weapons and equipment into civilian areas with the deliberate purpose of using innocent civilians and their homes as shields against attacks on legitimate military targets.
*Iraqi fighter and bomber aircraft were dispersed into villages near the military airfields where they were parked between civilian houses and even placed immediately adjacent to important archaeological sites and historic treasures.
*Coalition aircraft were fired upon by anti-aircraft weapons in residential neighborhoods in various cities. In Baghdad, anti-aircraft sites were located on hotel roofs.
*In one case, military engineering equipment used to traverse rivers, including mobile bridge sections, was located in several villages near an important crossing point. The Iraqis parked each vehicle adjacent to a civilian house.

===Al-Qaeda===
In the aftermath of the 1998 United States embassy bombings, Osama bin Laden stressed that he would have committed the attacks even if his own children were being used as human shields.

===Bosnian War===
Shortly after the cease-fire between Croat and Serb forces, the Army of Republika Srpska launched an assault against the safe area of Goražde, heavily shelling the town and surrounding villages. Protests and exhortations from the UN Security Council were ineffective, and on 10 and 11 April 1994, NATO launched air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions. In retaliation, Bosnian Serb forces captured UN personnel within their areas of operation and used them as human shields at sites expected to be bombed. In a similar situation to what had happened in Sarajevo, an ultimatum was issued, and by the 24th, most of the Serb troops had complied.

==21st century==

===War in Afghanistan===
According to various accounts, including that of the American ambassador to the U.N., the Taliban used women and children from their own population as human shields against coalition forces in 2006, 2007, and 2008, during the war in Afghanistan.

===Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army===
According to Human Rights Watch 2004 report, the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army used children as human shields, porters, and laborers.

===Abu Sayyaf===
In 2018, several Abu Sayyaf militants were arrested in the Philippines, among them being a &quot;key man&quot; of the group. The arrests occurred after clashes in Sabah and Putrajaya, where Abu Sayyaf allegedly used children as human shields against the Philippine army.

===Iran===

====Flight 752====
In the aftermath of Iran&#x27;s shoot down of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 in January 2020, Iran and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were accused of using civilian aircraft and their passengers and crew as human shields.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;They also hoped that the presence of passenger jets could act as a deterrent against an American attack on the airport or the nearby military base, effectively turning planeloads of unsuspecting travelers into human shields.&quot; Canada&#x27;s Minister of Transport Marc Garneau also questioned why Iran let civilian aircraft in its airspace, and suggested Iran intended to use the civilian aircraft as human shields.

===Boko Haram===

In 2015, the Islamist group Boko Haram has abducted some 500 women and children to serve as human shields.

In 2016, it was reported the group kidnapped schoolgirls &quot;used as human shield[s]&quot;.

===Houthis in Yemen===
Houthis have been known to use human shields in their war in Yemen at least since 2016, as from a UN report at the time.

In 2018, the Houthis were accused by the Yemenite government of use of human shields Amnesty International warned that the Houthis are &quot;militarising&quot; hospitals.

In September 2019, UAE media reported that Houthi rebels blocked food from reaching civilians used as human shields.

===Myanmar===
In 2014, a report noted that Myanmar&#x27;s army abducts civilians and forces them to act as guides and human shields.

===Venezuela===
In August 2017, Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro has been accused of turning to civilians for &quot;human shields&quot; against the US. Freddy Guevara, an opposition deputy, branded cowardly the actions of adding civilian personnel and the reserve to carry out military exercises and face a possible US attack.

In April 2020, it was reported that Nicolas Maduro had imprisoned hundreds of opposition members to use as human shields in a potential US invasion.

===Israeli–Palestinian conflict===

Human shields have been used by the Israeli Defense Forces during the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, with instances being widely documented in the Second Intifada, and notably recurring in the 2008–2009 Gaza War, the 2014 Gaza War and the 2023 Israel–Hamas War.

The Israeli use of human shields was formally challenged in September 2004, when Justice Aharon Barak, presiding over the Israeli Supreme Court, issued a demand that the IDF desist from the practice of using Palestinians as human shields, and in October outlawed the procedure. The independent human rights NGOs B&#x27;tselem and Amnesty International have stated that ample evidence exists in conflicts after that date that Israel has employed Palestinians as human shields. According to B&#x27;tselem, the practice goes back to 1967. In 2010, two Israeli soldiers were convicted of using for using a Palestinian boy during the 2008–2009 Gaza War.

The charge has been leveled against Palestinian groups frequently by numerous observers. Neve Gordon has noted how Israel has used the charge as part of its &#x27;infowar&#x27; on social media, to explain the high ratio of civilian vs military casualties in its conflict with Gaza. In Operation Cast Lead 100 Gazans died for every Israeli, and the civilian ratio was 400 Gazans to 1 Israeli. Israeli spokesmen explained the difference by alleging that Hamas used civilians as shields. It has been argued that no evidence has come to light proving these claims. Amnesty International investigated the incidents which resulted in the largest number of civilian casualties, finding that these casualties were not the result of human shielding. During the 2023 Israel–Hamas War, the European Union and US President Joe Biden condemned the use of human shields by organizations such as Hamas. Janina Dill, a laws of war professor at University of Oxford, stated, &quot;Even if Hamas uses civilians as human shields, those civilians are entitled to full protection under international law unless they directly participate in the fighting&quot;.

Amnesty International investigated claims made by Israel in the 2008–2009 Gaza War and the 2014 Gaza War that Hamas employed human shields, and said that &quot;storing munitions in civilian buildings or launching attacks from the vicinity of civilian buildings&quot; and public statements directing civilians to stay at home do not amount to using human shields.

===Iraq War===
During the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, a group of people chose to travel to Iraq to act as human shields. Their purpose was to prevent American-led coalition forces from bombing certain locations. Of about 200 to 500 human shields who traveled to Iraq before hostilities, at least eighty stayed.

U.S. Army Cavalry Scout Scott Ewing, who served in Iraq in the 2005–2006 period, stated that U.S. troops would give candy to Iraqi children so they would stay around their vehicles, thereby making more likely that enemies would not attack them.

===Lebanon War===
An Australian journalist claimed during the 2006 Lebanon War that Hezbollah used Lebanese civilians as human shields to dissuade the IDF from firing at gunmen and rocket launchers. Human Rights Watch conducted its own investigation and reported that Hezbollah did not &quot;deliberately&quot; use civilians as a deterrent from IDF attack. HRW did however conclude Hezbollah stored weapons &quot;in or near civilian homes&quot; and fighters launched rockets within populated areas and near UN observers. HRW also accused Hezbollah of using Lebanese homes as sites for rocket launchers, usually without the homeowner&#x27;s knowledge or permission, putting large numbers of civilians at risk.

On July 25, 2006, Israeli forces attacked and destroyed a UN observer post in southern Lebanon, resulting in four deaths. One of the fatalities, Canadian Major Paeta Derek Hess-von Kruedener, had sent an e‑mail to his former commander, retired Major-General Lewis MacKenzie, several days before his death in which he described the Israeli bombardment, writing &quot;The closest artillery has landed within two meters of our position and the closest 1,000 lb aerial bomb has landed 100 meters from our patrol base. This has not been deliberate targeting, but rather due to tactical necessity&quot;. MacKenzie interpreted this language for a reporter: &quot;What that means is, in plain English, &#x27;We&#x27;ve got Hezbollah fighters running around in our positions, taking our positions here and then using us for shields and then engaging the (Israeli Defence Forces). A senior UN official, replying about Major Hess-von Kruedener&#x27;s e-mail concerning Hezbollah&#x27;s presence in the area of the UN base, said &quot;At the time, there had been no Hezbollah activity reported in the area. So it was quite clear they were not going after other targets; that, for whatever reason, our position was being fired upon.&quot; He went on to claim that the Israelis were told where the UN base was and that it was clearly marked but they bombed it anyway.

===Siege of Lal Masjid===
According to the Pakistan Army spokesman, Islamic militants used girls as human shields in Pakistan during the 2007 Siege of Lal Masjid. The mosque&#x27;s head cleric denied the allegations.

On 4 December 2009, terrorists attacked a Friday prayer ceremony in a mosque in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, where Bilal Riaz, a graduate student, acted as a human shield to save his nephew&#x27;s life.

===Sri Lankan Civil War===

According to a Human Rights Watch report published on 19 February 2009, the LTTE had been preventing Tamil people civilians from fleeing out of rebel held area and using them as human shields against the Sri Lankan Army offensive. The report outlines that according to the NGO&#x27;s own findings, the human rights violations &quot;include deliberate, indiscriminate, and disproportionate attacks on civilians, hostage taking, and use of human shields&quot;. This is concluded in the report&#x27;s own recommendations to the LTTE, stating that the use of human shields as well as the placing of military targets near civilian populations being a war crime as per the International Humanitarian Law found in IHL. Sri Lankan government&#x27;s Maxwell Paranagama Commission stated that the LTTE was principally responsible for the loss of civilian life during the final phase of the armed conflict through their action to use fleeing Tamil civilians as Human Shields clearly differing with the Darusman Report.

===Libyan Civil Wars===

During the First Libyan Civil War, Gaddafi loyalists were acting as human shields in the Libya no-fly zone, to try to protect Gaddafi&#x27;s compound and airports.

In March 2016, during the Second Libyan Civil War, it was reported that two Italians who had been kidnapped in June 2015 were killed while they were used as human shields by Islamic State gunmen in Sorman.

===Syrian Civil War===
During the Syrian Civil War, the Syrian Armed Forces and loyalists were accused by Human Rights Watch of using residents of towns as human shields when advancing on opposition held areas, forcing them to march in front of the army. Witness from different towns across the country said that the army had kidnapped people and forced them to march in front of them when attacking towns and villages. The purpose of this was to protect the army from attack. HRW said &quot;The Syrian army should immediately stop this abhorrent practice.&quot; Witnesses stated that the army forcibly used children and elderly people as well to deter anyone from firing on the soldiers.

====ISIS in Syria====
ISIS has ideologically justified use of Muslims as human shields.

The Islamic State (ISIL) militants, Saudi-supported the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda, and Jaysh al-Islam anti-Assad rebels were accused of using civilian residents of towns, Alawite civilians and captured Syrian soldiers as human shields.

On the use of human shields by ISIS in Syria, most notably was in 2019 as reported by SDF: The jihadists were using the civilians as human shields to block. The civilians were &quot;on the front lines&quot;.

===ISIS in Iraq===
Among publicized examples of Islamic State ISIS militants using human shields in Iraq: In 2016, Islamic State militants rounded up thousands of villagers at gunpoint to use as human shields. And in April 2017 in Mosul.

===Russian invasion of Ukraine===

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian soldiers held over 300 Ukrainian civilians as human shields in the basement of the school of Yahidne, where a Russian military camp was located; dozens of civilians died in the process. BBC found &quot;clear evidence&quot; of Russian troops using Ukrainian civilians as human shields in Obukhovychi, near the Belarusian border, where 150 people were held at the local school. Local residents reported that Russian forces leaving the village of Novyi Bykiv used Ukrainian children as human shields.

===Jammu and Kashmir===

On 9 April 2017, during the Srinagar Lok Sabha by-election, a 26-year-old man captured by the Indian Army was tied to the front of a Jeep belonging to Indian Army as a column of Indian troops was moving through a locality. The man was reportedly tied to the vehicle to dissuade other Kashmiri insurgents from hurling stones at the Indian troops. The man was accused of being involved in throwing stones at Indian troops. The Government of India stated that it would stand by the officer who took the decision to use the insurgent as a human shield. J&amp;K Human Rights Commission asked the Government of Jammu and Kashmir to pay 10 Lakh Rupees as compensation to the man used as human shield. Jammu and Kashmir government refused to pay.

===2023 Israel–Hamas War===

Hamas has been accused of using human shields in the Gaza Strip, purposely attempting to shield itself from Israeli attacks by storing weapons in civilian infrastructure, launching rockets from residential areas, and telling residents to ignore Israeli warnings to flee. Israel has accused Hamas of maintaining command and control bunkers and tunnel infrastructure below hospitals, with some of the accusations being supported by the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations Secretary General. Hamas has denied using civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, as human shields.

Israel has said that Hamas&#x27;s actions have caused Israel to kill civilians as collateral damage. Human rights groups have said that “even if Hamas were using human shields”, Israel must still abide by international law, especially the principle of proportionality.

According to Israeli professor Neve Gordon, co-author of &quot;Human Shields: A History of People in the Line of Fire&quot; there is a double standard, with Israel blaming Hamas for using human shields whereas the Israeli civilians living near military bases, including those in central Tel Aviv and Beer Sheba, are not considered human shields. In November 2023, Cambridge University professor Marc Weller said that &quot;The very fact that we have seen 44 [Israeli] soldiers killed in [the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip] and almost 11,000 [Palestinian] civilians gives an indication that the calculation of proportionality in Gaza has left the bounds of reasonableness.&quot; 

The Israeli Defense Forces have been accused of using Palestinians as human shields. On 17 January 2024, Israeli soldiers were recorded using a Palestinian shop-owner in Dura, Hebron, West Bank, as a human shield. A 21-year-old man from Gaza City stated to &quot;Al Jazeera&quot; that he had been used as a human shield by Israeli forces. According to Haaretz, &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;Washington Post&quot; investigations based on many Israeli soldiers&#x27; testimonies, Palestinian teenagers and adults are regularly used as human shields in exploring the tunnel network in the Gaza Strip. In November 2024, Defence for Children International reported on three separate incidents, during October 15-20, 2024, of families with young children being used as human shields to protect the Israel Defense Forces in attacks at the Jabalia refugee camp and Indonesia Hospital.

==Voluntary human shields==
===Anti-war activists===
In recent years civilians have volunteered to serve as &quot;human shields&quot; to prevent military conflict. In January 2003, anti-war activists organised Human Shield Action to Iraq in advance of the March 2003 invasion. Ultimately, Human Shield Action brought 200 people to Iraq. Many of them left as they ran out of money and the likelihood of war became greater. Several of these human shields had to be rescued by U.S. Marines after Iraqis threatened them for opposing the invasion of their country. 

===Pro-Palestinian activists===
Rabbis for Human Rights agreed to act as &quot;human shields&quot; during the annual olive harvest to protect Palestinian villages from settlers. Rachel Corrie and Tom Hurndall, Western International Solidarity Movement (ISM) volunteers in the Palestinian territories, who died in 2003 and 2004 respectively have been described as &quot;human shields&quot; campaigning against house demolition. ISM, however, strongly takes offence at the use of the term &quot;human shield&quot; to describe their work, preferring it be used only to refer to when armed combatants uses civilians as shields. Not even Amnesty International defines volunteer activist&#x27;s actions or activist&#x27;s actions for non-military property as &quot;human shields&quot;, and regards only the direction of &quot;specific civilians to remain in their homes as &quot;human shields&quot; for fighters, munitions, or military equipment&quot; as &quot;human shields&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MDE 15/017/2014&quot;&gt;&quot;Document - Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories: Israel/Gaza conflict&quot;. Amnesty International. July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 3 definitions in the header of this article the &#x27;volunteers to protect Palestinians&#x27; make them not &quot;human shields outside the battlefield&quot; but protesters or ordinary pro-Palestinian demonstrants.

<text>Koch&#x27;s postulates ( ) are four criteria designed to establish a causal relationship between a microbe and a disease. The postulates were formulated by Robert Koch and Friedrich Loeffler in 1884, based on earlier concepts described by Jakob Henle, and the statements were refined and published by Koch in 1890. Koch applied the postulates to describe the etiology of cholera and tuberculosis, both of which are now ascribed to bacteria. The postulates have been controversially generalized to other diseases. More modern concepts in microbial pathogenesis cannot be examined using Koch&#x27;s postulates, including viruses (which are obligate intracellular parasites) and asymptomatic carriers. They have largely been supplanted by other criteria such as the Bradford Hill criteria for infectious disease causality in modern public health and the Molecular Koch&#x27;s postulates for microbial pathogenesis.

==Postulates==

Koch&#x27;s four postulates are:

# The microorganism must be found in abundance in all organisms suffering from the disease but should not be found in healthy organisms.
# The microorganism must be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure culture.
# The cultured microorganism should cause disease when introduced into a healthy organism.
# The microorganism must be re-isolated from the inoculated, diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the original specific causative agent.

However, Koch later abandoned the universalist requirement of the first postulate when he discovered asymptomatic carriers of cholera and, later, of typhoid fever. Subclinical infections and asymptomatic carriers are now known to be a common feature of many infectious diseases, especially viral diseases such as polio, herpes simplex, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, and COVID-19. For example, poliovirus only causes paralysis in a small percentage of those infected.

The second postulate does not apply to pathogens incapable of growing in pure culture. For example, viruses are dependent on entering and hijacking host cells to use their resources for growth and reproduction, incapable of growing alone.

The third postulate specifies &quot;should&quot;, rather than &quot;must&quot;, because Koch&#x27;s experiments with tuberculosis and cholera showed that not all organisms exposed to an infectious agent will acquire the infection. Some individuals may avoid infection by maintaining their health for proper immune functioning, acquiring immunity from previous exposure or vaccination, or through genetic immunity, such as sickle cell trait conferring resistance to malaria.

Other exceptions to Koch&#x27;s postulates include evidence that some pathogens can cause several diseases, such as the varicella-zoster virus causing chickenpox and shingles. Conversely, diseases like meningitis can be caused by a variety of bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic pathogens.

==History==
Robert Koch developed the postulates based on pathogens that could be isolated using 19th century methods. Nonetheless, Koch was already aware that the causative agent of cholera, &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;, could be found in both sick and healthy people, invalidating his first postulate. Since the 1950s, Koch&#x27;s postulates have been treated as obsolete for epidemiology research, but they are still taught to emphasize historical approaches to determining the microbial causative agents of disease.

Koch formulated his postulates too early in the history of virology to recognize that many viruses do not cause illness in all infected individuals, a requirement of the first postulate. HIV/AIDS denialism includes claims that the viral spread of HIV/AIDS violates Koch&#x27;s second postulate, despite that criticism being applicable to all viruses. Nonetheless, HIV/AIDS fulfills all of the other postulates with all AIDS patients being HIV-positive and laboratory workers exposed to HIV eventually developing the same symptoms of AIDS. Similarly, evidence that some oncovirus infections can contribute to cancers has been unfairly criticized for failing to fulfill criteria developed before viruses were fully understood as host-dependent. 

The bacterial pathogen &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; showcases lethal synergy with the opportunistic fungi &quot;Candida albicans&quot; by using the latter&#x27;s extracellular matrix to protect itself from host immune cells and antibiotic compounds. Biofilm-producing species aim to clump individual cells on solid or liquid surfaces, growing poorly in a pure culture and leaving those that survive potentially too weak to cause disease if transferred to a healthy organism, violating the second and third postulates.

Physicians Barry Marshall and Robin Warren argued that &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; contributes to peptic ulcer disease, but throughout the early 1980s, the scientific community initially rejected their findings because not all &quot;H. pylori&quot; infections cause peptic ulcers, violating the first postulate.

Priority effects are another major concern, as the success of pathogenic bacteria is dependent on the other species already colonizing that habitat, as the earliest resident microbes establish the environmental conditions, providing colonization resistance against certain species.

== Molecular Koch&#x27;s postulates ==
In 1988, microbiologist Stanley Falkow developed a set of three Molecular Koch&#x27;s postulates for identifying the microbial genes encoding virulence factors. First, the phenotype of a disease symptom must be associated with a specific genotype only found in pathogenic strains. Second, that symptom should not be present when the associated gene is inactivated. Third, the symptom should return when the gene is reactivated.

Modern DNA sequencing allows researchers to identify whether the genes of specific pathogens are only present in infected hosts, offering a modified approach for determining correlation between viruses and certain diseases. Since viruses cannot grow in axenic cultures, requiring a host cell to hijack for growth and replication, scientists are limited to analyzing which viral genes contribute to host diseases. Additionally, this method has supported correlations between prions (pathogenic misfolded proteins) and conditions like Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease because Koch&#x27;s postulates are focused on foreign microorganisms, rather than the results of host mutations.

<doc id="147011" wikidata="Q2495802" url="?curid=147011" title="M142 HIMARS">
<text>The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS ) is a light multiple rocket launcher developed in the late 1990s for the United States Army and mounted on a standard U.S. Army Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) M1140 truck frame.

The HIMARS carries one pod with either six Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System rockets or one ATACMS missile. It is based on the U.S. Army&#x27;s FMTV five-ton truck, and is capable of launching all rockets in the Multiple Launch Rocket System Family of Munitions. HIMARS ammunition pods are interchangeable with the M270 MLRS. It has a single pod, as opposed to the standard two for the M270 and its variants.

The launcher can be transported by C-17 Globemaster, C-5 Galaxy, and Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft. The FMTV truck that transports the HIMARS was initially produced by Armor Holdings Aerospace and Defense Group Tactical Vehicle Systems Division, the original equipment manufacturer of the FMTV. It was produced by the Oshkosh Corporation from 2010 to 2017.

== Development ==
The requirement for HIMARS came about in 1982, when the 9th Infantry Division (Motorized) saw the need to acquire a light multiple rocket launcher as a counterfire asset. The requirement failed to gather support from the Field Artillery School and languished for a number of years. The institutional bias at the time was oriented towards heavy forces. With the waning of the Cold War and the growing interest in low-intensity operations, both the Field Artillery School and Missile Command realized that the M270 MLRS was too heavy for rapid deployment and pushed for the funding of HIMARS.

The Gulf War gave new impetus towards fielding a lightweight MLRS, when the M270 proved too costly in airlift assets to deploy in theater and the launchers did not arrive with the initial wave of U.S. troops. In April 1991, the HIMARS concept was tested at White Sands Missile Range, using a modified Honest John launcher.
HIMARS was then developed as a private venture by Loral Vought Systems, later Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, to meet this requirement. The system first appeared publicly in 1993. In 1996, the U.S. Army Missile Command awarded Lockheed Martin a $23.2 million contract to build four prototypes. In April 1998, the vehicles were delivered to the XVIII Airborne Corps for a two-year evaluation with 3rd Battalion, 27th Field Artillery Regiment.

In July 1998, the Army conducted a test firing of the ATACMS. In December 1999, the Aviation and Missile Command awarded Lockheed Martin a $65 million contract for engineering and manufacturing development. Under this contract, Lockheed Martin delivered six HIMARS in late 2001 for Army evaluation. In April 2003, the Army awarded Lockheed Martin a $96 million contract to begin low rate initial production. Around this time, the Marine Corps placed an order for two units for evaluation purposes.

The launcher system and chassis are produced by Lockheed Martin Missiles &amp; Fire Control in Camden, Arkansas as of 2019.

==Design==
The HIMARS is similar in design to the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), with the main exception being that it is a wheeled vehicle as opposed to a tracked vehicle. The HIMARS can carry the same type of pods as the M270, but carries one pod while the M270 carries two pods. The HIMARS windows are made of sheets of sapphire laminated with glass and polycarbonate.

The HIMARS was also tested as a unified launch system for both artillery rockets and the SLAMRAAM surface-launched variant of the AMRAAM anti-aircraft missile.

In October 2017, a Marine Corps HIMARS fired a rocket while at sea against a land target for the first time from the deck of the amphibious transport dock , demonstrating the system&#x27;s ability to operate while on ships to deliver precision fire from a standoff range against shore defenses. The vehicle&#x27;s targeting software was reworked so it can better fire while on a launch platform in motion.

By early 2022, Lockheed Martin was producing HIMARS at a rate of 48 launchers annually, but following the start of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine that rate was increased to 60. In October 2022 the company announced it would boost production to 96 systems annually in response to increased demand caused by the war. Limitations in building new industrial capacity means it will be several months before production can be ramped up from five to eight vehicles monthly.

==Operational history==
HIMARS first entered service in June 2005 with the 27th Field Artillery, 18th Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, in North Carolina.

===Afghanistan and the Middle East===
Three prototype HIMARS launchers were successfully used during the Iraq War. The first US Marine Corps battalion equipped with HIMARS, the 2nd Battalion, 14th Marine Regiment, was deployed to Iraq in July 2007.


In February 2010, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) for Afghanistan indicated in a press release that two rockets fired from a HIMARS were believed to have fallen 300 metres short of their intended target, killing 12 civilians during Operation Moshtarak. ISAF suspended the use of the HIMARS until a full review of the incident was completed. A British officer later said that the rockets were on target, that the target was in use by the Taliban, and that use of the system had been reinstated. Reports indicated that the civilian deaths were due to the Taliban&#x27;s use of human shields. The presence of civilians at that location had not been known to the ISAF forces. A report in the &quot;New York Times&quot; in October 2010 credited the HIMARS with aiding the NATO offensive in Kandahar by targeting Taliban commanders&#x27; hideouts, forcing many to flee to Pakistan, at least temporarily.

In November 2015, the U.S. Army revealed that it had deployed the HIMARS to Iraq, firing at least 400 rockets at Islamic State (ISIL) targets since the beginning of that summer. HIMARS detachments were sent to Al Asad Airbase and Al-Taqaddum Air Base in Al Anbar Governorate. In March 2016, a U.S. Army HIMARS fired rockets into Syria for the first time in support of Syrian rebels fighting ISIL, from launchers based in neighboring Jordan.

In January 2016, Lockheed announced that the HIMARS had reached 1 million operational hours with U.S. forces, achieving a 99 percent operational readiness rate.

In April 2016, it was announced that the U.S. would be deploying the HIMARS in Turkey near the border with Syria as part of the battle with ISIL. In early September, international media and the U.S. State Department reported a newly deployed HIMARS had engaged ISIL targets in Syria near the Turkish border.

In October 2016, HIMARS were stationed at Qayyarah Airfield West, some south of Mosul, taking part in the Battle of Mosul.

In June 2017, a HIMARS was deployed at Al-Tanf, Syria, to support U.S.-backed rebels in the area.

On 24 May 2018, a HIMARS strike killed 50 Taliban fighters and leaders in Musa Qala, Afghanistan. Three rockets struck the building within a 14-second timespan.

In September 2018, US support forces coordinated with Syrian Democratic Forces fighting to defeat ISIS in east Syria in the Deir ez-Zor campaign, sometimes striking ISIS positions with GMLRS rockets 30 times per day. The HIMARS used in this support operation were located in the Omar oilfields, some north of the ISIS-controlled targets.

===Ukraine===
On 1 June 2022, the US announced that it would be supplying four HIMARS to Ukraine with M31 GMLRS unitary rockets. On 23 June, the first HIMARS arrived in Ukraine, according to Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov. On 25 June 2022, Ukraine started deploying the system against Russian forces during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. According to the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, &quot;Artillerymen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine hit ... military targets of the enemy on our, Ukrainian, territory&quot;. The Ukrainian military stated that this first strike, on a Russian base in Izyum, killed over 40 soldiers. The day before, a second batch of four was announced to be delivered in mid-July.

On 1 July, a US defense official told reporters that Ukraine had been using the system to destroy Russian command posts: &quot;selecting targets and then accurately hitting them ... degrading Russian capability&quot;. On 18 July, Zaluzhnyi said: &quot;An important factor contributing to our retention of defensive lines and positions is the timely arrival of M142 HIMARS, which deliver surgical strikes on enemy control posts, ammunition and fuel storage depots.&quot;

Another four HIMARS were announced for delivery on 8 July, the delivery spacing driven by the weeks-long process to train Ukrainian troops on how to use the platform. To avoid escalating the conflict, the US restricted Ukraine from using HIMARS to attack targets on Russian territory. For the same reason, the US had not provided Ukraine with the longer-range ATACMS missile, which could easily engage targets inside of Russia.

A fourth batch of four was announced on 20 July, bringing the total number of HIMARS committed to Ukraine to 16. Ukrainian Defense Minister Reznikov stated that the country needed &quot;at least 100&quot; of the system and that by that point, eight systems had destroyed 30 command stations and ammunition storage facilities, decreasing the intensity of Russian shelling and slowing their advance. In that announcement, it was revealed that the number delivered had reached 12 launchers. That number had increased to 16 by 1 August.

On 30 August 2022, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported on Ukrainian claims to have successfully used decoy HIMARS units made out of wood to draw at least 10 Russian 3M-54 Kalibr cruise missiles. One US diplomat stated that Russian sources had claimed more HIMARS destroyed than the US had sent. A Pentagon official had earlier in the month asserted that no HIMARS had been destroyed at that time. On 8 September, US General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters: &quot;We are seeing real and measurable gains from Ukraine in the use of these systems. For example, the Ukrainians have struck over 400 targets with the HIMARS and they&#x27;ve had devastating effect&quot;.

A further 18 HIMARS were announced on 28 September, as part of an aid package aimed at meeting Ukraine&#x27;s mid- and long-term needs, so deliveries are to begin in six months at the earliest. Ukraine had previously been provided with only M31 Unitary Warhead missiles, which are &quot;not ideal against targets spread over large areas, as the deadly chunks are not designed to fly far.&quot; As of early October they have been granted the M30A1 which uses the Alternative Warhead that can cover up to &quot;half a square mile of land in a single salvo&quot; with 180,000 tungsten steel BB sized balls. The US announced on 4 October that four more HIMARS launchers would be provided from US military stockpiles, to increase the total to 20 HIMARS in Ukrainian service.

HIMARS attacks by Ukraine have been credited with &quot;destroy Russian command nodes, tens of thousands of howitzer artillery rounds and a staggering 20 million small-arms rounds.&quot; As of 11 November 2022, a senior U.S. official stated no HIMARS systems have been destroyed after five months in operational use. As of February 2023, CNN reported that Ukraine had expended approximately 9,500 GMLRS rockets. In response to the effects of HIMARS, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu declared the HIMARS system as a high priority target for Russian troops. Ukrainian officials identified Russia&#x27;s loitering munitions as the biggest threat to the HIMARS.

HIMARS has been used to strike Russian troop concentrations with GMLRS. Groups of Russian troops out in the open have been killed in these strikes, with a strike in February 2024 killing up to 65 Russian soldiers. HIMARS has also been used to strike Russian troop concentrations in hard cover, with a HIMARS strike on a Russian base in Makiivka killing 89 Russian soldiers on the admission of the Russian government, although BBC News Russian claimed at least 139 dead Russian soldiers. On 9 August 2024, HIMARS destroyed a convoy of Russian troops in the Kursk Oblast of Russia in what Russian milbloggers described as one of the bloodiest attacks of the entire war.

On 5 May 2023, it was reported that Russia was able to jam GMLRS rockets&#x27; GPS guidance system, making strikes less precise. In addition to GPS guidance, GMLRS rockets have an inertial navigation system which, by definition, cannot be jammed, but it is less precise alone than when it is coupled with GPS guidance.

On 10 February 2024, two Ukrainian HIMARS systems were seen arriving onboard an Antonov Airlines An-124-100M at Harrisburg International Airport in Pennsylvania. Both systems appeared damaged, with one having cracked windows in the crew compartment, and the other missing its front right wheel.

On 5 March 2024, a Ukrainian HIMARS system was destroyed for the first confirmed time, after being tracked by a Russian drone and targeted with a missile near Nykanorivka, Donetsk Oblast.
On 15 August 2024, the second confirmed loss of a HIMARS system occurred in the Sumy region, making the total loss to two destroyed and two damaged.

In June 2024, after Ukraine was given permission to use GMLRS on internationally recognized Russian territory, HIMARS strikes destroyed and damaged launchers along with other components of the Russian long-range S-300/S-400 surface-to-air missile system in Belgorod region of Russia. On 9 August 2024, HIMARS destroyed a convoy of Russian troops in the Kursk Oblast of Russia, with Russian milbloggers acknowledging the attack and calling for punishment of Russian commanders. Drone video of the HIMARS strike subsequently emerged, showing the Russian convoy being struck with GMLRS, numerous Russian vehicles being destroyed, and Russian troops fleeing the convoy.

== Armament ==
The HIMARS can fire the following rockets and missiles:

=== MLRS ===
MLRS is a series of 227 mm rockets.

&quot;See section in main article M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System for more details on the M26&quot;

==== GMLRS ====
Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) 227 mm rockets have an extended range and add GPS-aided guidance to their Inertial Navigation System. GMLRS rockets were introduced in 2005 and the M30 and M31 rockets are, except for their warheads, identical. 50,000 GMLRS rockets have been produced, with yearly production now exceeding 9,000 rockets. Each rocket pod contains 6 identical rockets. Both Lockheed Martin and the U.S. Army report that the GMLRS has a maximum range of 70+ km (43+ mi). According to a U.S. Department of Defense document the maximum demonstrated performance of a GMLRS is , a figure also reported elsewhere. Another source reports a maximum range of about . In 2009 Lockheed Martin announced that a GMLRS had been successfully test fired .

* M30 rockets carrying 404 DPICM M101 submunitions. Range: . 3,936 produced between 2004 and 2009, production ceased in favor of the M30A1. The remaining M30 rockets are being updated with either the M30A1 or M31A1 warhead.
* M30A1 rockets with Alternative Warhead (AW). Range: . GMLRS rocket that replaces the M30&#x27;s submunitions with approximately 182,000 pre-formed tungsten fragments for area effects without unexploded ordnance. Entered production in 2015. This warhead is superior not just because it does not use cluster munitions but is also superior to a normal high explosive round: &quot;A high explosive round is very impressive because it produces a big bomb and large pieces of shrapnel, but this round is small pellets and covers a much larger area.&quot; The M30A1 uses a proximity sensor fuze mode with a 10 meter burst height.
* M30A2 rockets with Alternative Warhead (AW). Range: . Improved M30A1 with Insensitive Munition Propulsion System (IMPS). Only M30 variant in production since 2019.

==Related developments==
Lockheed Martin UK and INSYS had jointly developed a demonstrator rocket artillery system similar to HIMARS for the British Army&#x27;s &quot;Lightweight Mobile Artillery Weapon System/Rocket&quot; (LIMAWS(R)) program. The system consisted of a single MLRS pod, mounted on a Supacat SPV600 chassis. The LIMAWS(R) program was canceled in September 2007.

Lockheed Martin and Thales Australia are discussing with the Australian government, manufacturing GMLRS rockets in Australia, due in part to concerns of resupply during conflict. Australia has the ability to manufacture the rockets but it depends on the technology, specifically the guidance components, being authorized by the US government. In November 2022, the publication The Strategist, published by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, warned that &quot;acquiring the missile-delivery system without a dedicated surveillance and target acquisition capability means that Australia&#x27;s long-range fires will have no eyes.&quot;

===Autonomous Multi-domain Launcher===
The Autonomous Multi-domain Launcher (AML) is an unmanned variant of the HIMARS. The AML is equipped with remote controlled launcher and fire-control system that ensures compatibility with current munitions used onboard both M270 MLRS and HIMARS. The concept video shows the AML can carry two pods compared to one on HIMARS and is expected to be compatible with munitions from other services or in development.

===Homar-A===
Homar-A (English: Lobster, A for American) is a program by Polish Ministry of National Defense to acquire the M142 HIMARS, and, via technology transfers, integrate the launcher with the domestically produced Jelcz 663.45 6x6 truck chassis, &quot;Topaz&quot; battle management system and communication system. The Armaments Agency of the Polish Ministry of National Defense has signed a framework agreement with Lockheed Martin on September 11, 2023. Under the terms of this agreement, 486 Homar-A vehicles will be assembled in Poland, with first deliveries starting in 2026.

===GMARS===
In 2023, Rheinmetall and Lockheed Martin signed a collaboration agreement for the development of the Global Mobility Artillery System (GMARS) to address the need for future long-range artillery. The GMARS launcher consists of two pods as opposed to HIMARS&#x27; single pod. Current munition options include the MFOM family of munitions such as GMLRS, ER-GMLRS, MGM-140 ATACMS and Precision Strike Missile. Surfaced launched version of AGM-158 JASSM and 122 mm unguided rockets are expected to be integrated later. It was unveiled during the Eurosatrory 2024 and mounted on Rheinmetall&#x27;s HX 8x8 chassis. Both Rheinmetall and Lockheed Martin are actively engaging with European customers for potential sales.

:* Norwegian Army: In August 2024, the US State Department approved the sale of 16 HIMARS launchers, related equipment and munitions for a cost of approximately $580 million.

===Potential operators===
:* Bulgarian Land Forces: The M142 HIMARS is a part of Bulgaria&#x27;s Modernization program and is one of the top priorities for the Bulgarian Land Forces.
:* Philippine Army: The Philippines expressed interest in acquiring the M142 HIMARS for coastal defense, alongside the Indian BrahMos missile. Other options such as the K239 Chunmoo and the Elbit PULS are also being considered.
:* Swedish Army: Sweden has previously shown interest in buying and it is also on the Swedish Army&#x27;s wish list.

===Failed bids===
:* Hungarian Ground Forces: Hungary requested the sale of HIMARS from the US in a letter with a deadline of March 2022. As there was no response from the US, Hungary &quot;considered the matter closed&quot;. In June 2023, U.S. Senator Jim Risch, seated on the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee, revealed however that continued attempts had been made, but he had blocked the sale of up to 24 HIMARS systems to Hungary on grounds that Hungary was refusing to approve Sweden&#x27;s bid to join NATO. The Hungarian Defence Ministry in response stated that it did not intend to procure HIMARS systems.
:* Royal Netherlands Army: In February 2023, the US State Department approved the potential sale of 20 systems to Netherlands at a cost of $650 million. In March 2023, the Netherlands purchased 20 Elbit Systems PULS launchers instead of HIMARS. The value of the contract is $133 million. PULS advantage according to the Ministry of Defence is that it can carry more missiles, better price, means more missiles can be purchased and last but not least Elbit delivers them faster than Lockheed Martin, whose production capacity is booked many years ahead.

<text>Non-combatant is a term of art in the law of war and international humanitarian law to refer to civilians who are not taking a direct part in hostilities. People such as combat medics and military chaplains, who are members of the belligerent armed forces but are protected because of their specific duties (as currently described in Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions, adopted in June 1977); combatants who are placed &quot;hors de combat&quot;; and neutral persons, such as peacekeepers, who are not involved in fighting for one of the belligerents involved in a war. This particular status was first recognized under the Geneva Conventions with the First Geneva Convention of 1864.

Under international humanitarian law, certain non-combatants are classified as protected persons, who are to be protected under laws applicable to international armed conflict at all times.

== History ==
=== Hague Conventions ===
The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 were one of the first multi-country treaties to agree on rights for non-combatants. These meetings occurred in 1899 and 1907. Three treaties were signed and put into effect in 1899, including the treatment of prisoners of war and the protection of hospital ships. In 1907 thirteen additional treaties were signed. These cover regulations concerning the war on land, the declaration of war, the rights and responsibilities of neutral countries, and rights and restrictions during naval war.

Treaty II, Article 3 of the 1899 Convention maintains that surrendering belligerent fighters are to be treated as prisoners of war unless they are out of proper uniforms (i.e. spies). Article 13 of the same section declares that any other non-combatant or civilian affiliated with but not part of the belligerent military, such as reporters and contractors, have the same right to be treated as a prisoner of war.

Article 25 of Treaty II states that undefended communities are protected from any form of attack. In addition to the above, Article 27 states that if any sieges do occur, places devoted to religion, charity or hospitals should be avoided if possible, as long as they have no strategic affiliations.

Article 28 states that even when a village is captured through war, pillaging is not allowed by any party. That is repeated in Article 47, Section III. The articles above were reaffirmed by Convention IV of the 1907 Convention.

Many nations signed, including delegates from the United Kingdom, the United States, Russia, and Japan. Despite many nations signing at the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, a number of the agreements were broken during World War I, including sections from Treaty IV involving poisons and the attacking of undefended towns and villages.

While some Geneva Conventions occurred before the Hague Conventions, none touched on the rights of protected non-combatants in the heat of combat. The Geneva Conventions recognize and expand on many of the treaties signed at the Hague Conventions, particularly those involving the treatment of non-combatants. As a result, the regulations are still in civilian&#x27;s day.

=== Geneva Conventions ===
The Geneva Conventions started on April 21, 1949, and were concluded on August 12. The purpose of the Conventions was to establish protections afforded to protected non-combatants in wartime, including civilians under military occupations and prisoners of war. Article 4 of the Fourth Geneva Convention defines that civilians who &quot;find themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they are not nationals&quot; are protected persons. Not included in the status of protected persons are the belligerent&#x27;s citizens and nationals of a state not party to the Fourth Geneva Convention, and neutral citizens living in a belligerent country and co-belligerent (i.e., allied) persons as long their state of nationality maintains diplomatic relations with a belligerent power.

Article 42 of Protocol I states that aircrews who are parachuting from aircraft in distress cannot be attacked regardless of what territory they are over. If aircrews land in territory controlled by the enemy, they must be allowed to surrender before being attacked unless it is apparent that they are engaging in a hostile act or attempting to escape. Airborne forces who are descending by parachute from an aircraft, whether it is disabled or not, are not given the protection afforded by this Article and, therefore, may be attacked during their descent unless they are &quot;hors de combat&quot;.

Article 50 of Protocol 1 defines a civilian as a person who is not a privileged combatant. Article 51 describes the protection that must be given to civilians (unless they are unprivileged combatants) and civilian populations. Article 54 deals with the Protection of objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population and is categorical that &quot;Starvation of civilians as a method of warfare is prohibited.&quot; Chapter III of Protocol I regulates the targeting of civilian objects. Article 8(2)(b)(i) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court also prohibits attacks directed against civilians.

While not all states have ratified Protocol I or the Rome Statute, these provisions reiterated existing customary laws of war which are binding for all belligerents in an international conflict.

Article 3 in the general section of the Geneva Conventions states that in the case of armed conflict not of an international character (occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties) that each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum, the following provisions to &quot;persons taking no active part in the hostilities&quot; (non-combatants). Such persons shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, with the following prohibitions:
:(a) violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment, and torture
:(b) taking of hostages 
:(c) outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment
:(d) the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.

=== World War II ===
In World War II, non-combatants were more affected than they were in previous wars. Sources claim that over forty-five million civilians and non-combatants lost their lives throughout the war. This number, however, is largely debated. Despite the understanding that over 18 million were killed in the Holocaust and as a result of other Nazi persecution, the exact number will likely never be determined. There is also difficulty of estimating the numbers for events such as the Nanjing massacre, though it is estimated that between 200,000 and 300,000 civilians and prisoners of war were slaughtered. This does not necessarily include military, non-combatant or civilian people killed by radiation, disease, or other means as a result of war. After World War II ended, countries got together with the aim to give rights to non-combatants and created the 1949 Geneva Conventions, built off the 1907 Hague Convention.

=== Vietnam War ===
The Vietnam War was one war in the mid-20th century in which many civilians were killed. Many civilians were not specifically identified as whether they were non-combatants or ordinary civilians, which might have been directly or indirectly killing hundreds and thousands of Vietnamese civilians. However, there is no exact proportion of the number of non-combatants who have or were specified the exact figure, the statistics that have been given were all the estimates on how many civilians and combatants were killed. Most of the recorded numbers of people missing or killed were not specific, but all were casualties, meaning there is/was no exact figure for combatants or non-combatants. Military records in the National Archives do not specify how many non-combatants were killed during the Vietnam War.

Thousands of people were killed: civilians, casualties, combatants and non-combatants and so as ordinary civilians (citizens) in Vietnam but also in Laos and Cambodia. Thus, all figures do not specify how many non-combatants were killed or injured.

== Contemporary warfare and terrorism ==

=== War on Terrorism ===
Although there is no clear definition of terrorism, a terrorist can be explained as an individual who is a non-state actor who engages in armed hostilities toward a state or government during a time of peace. The location an individual is tried in a court of law is the determining factor between combatant and non-combatant terrorists. Individuals like the San Bernardino shooters, the Tsarnaev brothers and the people responsible for the September 11 attacks would be characterized as non-combatant terrorists. Groups like Al-Qaeda are considered combatant terrorists or may also be called unlawful combatants. Non-combatants can also be looked at as radical civilians and combatants can be seen as military soldiers.

As of 2017, there are inconsistent ways in which the prosecutions of terrorists are conducted. Possible solutions would be to take all individuals classified as non-combatants and have them charged as criminals and prosecute the individuals who are considered combatants and engage in warfare attacks under military commissions. Combatant terrorists are captured and detained to put an end to their hostilities and are labeled as prisoners of war, and non-combatants are considered criminals.

Germany&#x27;s Military Manual states that “combatants are persons who may take a direct part in hostilities, i.e., participate in the use of a weapon or a weapon-system in an indispensable function.” Furthermore, it specifies that &quot;persons who are members of the armed forces but do not have any combat mission, such as judges, government officials and blue-collar workers, are non-combatants.&quot;

<text>The Newcomes: Memoirs of a Most Respectable Family is a novel by William Makepeace Thackeray, first published in 1854 and 1855.

==Publication==
&quot;The Newcomes&quot; was published serially over about two years, as Thackeray himself says in one of the novel&#x27;s final chapters. The novel shows its serial origin: it is very long (an undated but clearly very old edition with tiny type fills 551 pages) and its events occur over many years and in several countries before the reader reaches the predictable conclusion. The main part of &quot;The Newcomes&quot; is set a decade or two after the action of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, and some of the characters in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; are mentioned peripherally in &quot;The Newcomes&quot;. The narrator is Arthur Pendennis, the protagonist of &quot;Pendennis&quot;. It was illustrated by Richard Doyle, both in literal renderings of the scenes and in symbolic and fanciful depictions of events and characters.

==Plot==
The novel tells the story of Colonel Thomas Newcome, a virtuous and upstanding character. It is equally the story of Colonel Newcome&#x27;s son, Clive, who studies and travels for the purpose of becoming a painter, although the profession is frowned on by some of his relatives and acquaintances—notably Clive&#x27;s snobbish, backstabbing cousin Barnes Newcome.

Colonel Newcome goes out to India for decades, then returns to England where Clive meets his cousin Ethel. After years in England, the colonel returns to India for another several years and while he is there, Clive travels Europe and his love for Ethel waxes and wanes. Dozens of background characters appear, fade, and reappear.

The colonel and Clive are only the central figures in &quot;The Newcomes&quot;, the action of which begins before the colonel&#x27;s birth. Over several generations the Newcome family rises into wealth and respectability as bankers and begin to marry into the minor aristocracy. A theme that runs throughout the novel is the practice of marrying for money. Herein we find first use of the coined word &quot;capitalism&quot;, as reference to an economic system. Religion is another theme, particularly Methodism.

==Critical commentary==

Perhaps one of the novel&#x27;s greatest strengths is that it contains hundreds of references to the popular and educated culture of the time and thus gives a better idea than most contemporary novels of what it was like to live in England then— almost a miniature education in the Victorian era. Thackeray mentions poets, painters, novelists (some of the characters are reading &quot;Oliver Twist)&quot;, politics, and other people, events and things both familiar and obscure to the 21st-century reader—and does so in a natural way that enhances the story. There are also plenty of Latin, French, Italian and ancient Greek phrases—all untranslated.

Colonel Newcome came to be an emblem of virtue for a period, often referred to at the turn of the 20th century. For example, in his autobiography, Theodore Roosevelt described his uncle, James Dunwoody Bulloch, as &quot;a veritable Colonel Newcome&quot;.

Ethel Barrymore was named after the character in the novel.

<text>The MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS ) is a supersonic tactical ballistic missile designed and manufactured by the US defense company Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV), and later Lockheed Martin through acquisitions.

It uses solid propellant and is long and in diameter, and the longest-range variants can fly up to . The missile can be fired from the tracked M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and the wheeled M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS).

An ATACMS launch container (pod) has one rocket but a lid patterned with six circles like a standard MLRS rocket lid to prevent an enemy from discerning what type of missile is loaded.

==History==
=== Pre-development ===
The concept of a conventional tactical ballistic missile was made possible by the doctrinal shift of the late Cold War, which rejected the indispensability of an early nuclear strike on the Warsaw Pact forces in the event the Cold War went hot. The AirLand Battle and Follow-on Forces Attack doctrines, which emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s, necessitated a conventional-armed (hence much more accurate) missile to strike enemy reserves, so the United States Army Aviation and Missile Command sponsored the Simplified Inertial Guidance Demonstrator (SIG-D) program.

Within this program, Ling-Temco-Vought developed a solid-fuel analog of the MGM-52 Lance missile, designated T-22, with a new RLG-based inertial guidance package, which demonstrated unprecedented accuracy. In 1978, DARPA started the Assault Breaker technology demonstration program to attack armor formations with many mobile hard targets at standoff ranges. It used the T-22 missile and the Patriot-based Martin Marietta T-16 missile with cluster warheads.

In March 1980 the U.S. Army decided to replace the Lance with a similar nuclear, but also chemical or biological, tipped solid-fuel missile with simplified usability dubbed the Corps Support Weapon System (CSWS). In a year, concerned about the fact Army started to develop the weapon with a similar objectives to interdict the second-echelon massed targets to already developing by USAF&#x27;s Conventional Standoff Weapon (CSW) program with only difference of surface/air-launched and both positioned as the part of same Short Range Nuclear Forces of Non-Strategic Nuclear Force Program, the Department of Defense subdued CSWS Project Office (Provisional) to MICOM renaming it to the System Development Office. That new office acquired the Assault Breaker effort thus started to manage the Assault Breaker and CSWS efforts together, that way slowly summing up and moving forward the weapon development progress for the JTACMS program to be сreated.

=== Development ===
Development of the missile now known as ATACMS started in 1980, when the U.S. Army decided to replace the Lance with a similar nuclear, but also chemical or biological, tipped solid-fuel missile dubbed the Corps Support Weapon System (CSWS). Concerned that two branches were developing too many similar missiles with different warheads, the Department of Defense merged the program with DARPA&#x27;s Assault Breaker in 1981, and with United States Air Force (USAF)&#x27;s Conventional Standoff Weapon (CSW) in 1982–1983.

The new missile system, designated Joint Tactical Missile System (JTACMS), soon encountered USAF resistance to the idea of an air-launched ballistic missile. As a result, in 1984 the USAF ended its participation in the non-cruise missile portion of the program, leading to the missile being redesignated as the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS).

==== Detailed ====
In fiscal year 1982, the United States House Committee on Appropriations approved the Corps Support Weapon System (CSWS) program, which was the successor to the US Army Assault Breaker program in cooperation with DARPA, was merged with the Conventional Standoff Weapon (CSW) US Air Force and renamed the Joint Tactical Missile System (JTACMS), the goal of which was to create a weapon that meets the combined requirements of both programs, namely, that it can attack and destroy the second-echelon of enemy forces, in particular armored vehicles, and scatter submunitions against such vehicles. In this project, it was planned to use the technologies of Assault Breaker to develop a surface-to-surface weapon system, which should be used for the so-called &quot;deep interdiction&quot; (some sort of preventive measure, the prototype of which is air interdiction when airforce only have been used) – by which is meant the destruction or causing significant damage by the joint activity of air and ground forces to the specific distant from the front line targets, such as buildings, bridges, oil refineries and other industry, that way slowing down logistics and/or providing and/or supporting and, therefore, advancing enemy troops with the aim of tactical, even albeit short-term, superiority of allied troops, which can significantly affect the military theater in a positive way, – using conventional or nuclear weapons on the battlefield. Although both services were to participate in the development of the weapon, it was the US Army who led the JTACMS program.

As of personalities the program initially was led by Colonel James B. Lincoln, who was a full-time and continuous student at numerous military schools (from 1960, when he graduated from the United States Military Academy, until 1980, when he graduated from Industrial College of the Armed Forces), in 1977 on the basis of Defense Systems Management College graduated with a thesis of &quot;Managing Total Acquisition Time: A New Priority for Major Weapon Systems&quot;, where, in particular, he focused on the significant decrease in the pace of procurement of the main missile complexes compared to 1971 and in 1980, heading the TRADOC program at Fort Sill in the direction of MLRS, spoke rather defiantly about field army systems, where, in particular, he compared the struggle of the US Army for limited resources during the development of new systems with bow wave, which prevents the ship from accelerating, and military projects are either canceled or refinanced by the state, with waves diverging from it, and was noticed by DARCOM. In April 1984, he was transferred to be the head of the TOW project, and in the current project he was replaced by Colonel William J. Fiorentino, who by that time had already been the head of the Pershing Project Manager&#x27;s Office for more than 5 years, which during his leadership developed two-stage solid fuel mobile-launched ballistic missiles with a nuclear warhead both short (Pershing) and medium (Pershing II) ranged. Dr. Billy Tidwell who was program manager during JTACMS while and Acting Program Manager for a short period.

In FY 1984 Congress prohibited the development of a nuclear warhead for JTACMS, despite the Army claiming it could place US forces at a disadvantage if it became necessary to make the system nuclear-capable. In FY 1985 the Army denied having R&amp;D funds programmed for the development of a JTACMS nuclear warhead.

On May, 22th, 1984 the U.S. Army and USAF signed an agreeing on a list of 31 initiatives. Item 18 on that list states about services will develop a different types of same rocket for each of it – preferences for Army was a development of shorter-ranged ground-launched system, for air-force – air-launched system.

JTACMS was intended to be a jointly funded program with NATO allies; the United Kingdom, Federal Republic of Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands and Italy were initially contacted about joining the program, with the British and Germans expressing interest, while the others declined due to lacking adequate funds.

Starting from at least the end of year 1986 ATACMS program was led by Colonel Thomas J. Kunhart.

=== Production ===
In March 1986, Ling-Temco-Vought won the contract for the missile design. The system was assigned the MGM-140 designation. The first test launch came two years later, thanks to earlier experience of the company with previous programs.

In 2007, the U.S. Army terminated the ATACMS program due to cost, ending the ability to replenish stocks. To sustain the remaining inventory, the ATACMS Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) was launched, which refurbishes or replaces propulsion and navigation systems, replaces cluster munition warheads with the unitary blast fragmentation warhead, and adds a proximity fuze option to obtain area effects. Deliveries were projected to start in 2018. The ATACMS SLEP is a bridging initiative to provide time to complete analysis and development of a successor capability to the aging ATACMS stockpile, which could be ready around 2022.

The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 authorized the production and procurement of up to 1,700 additional ATACMS, but this was not funded by the 2023 Defense Appropriations Act.

=== Stockpile upgrades ===

In January 2015, Lockheed Martin received a contract to develop and test new hardware for Block I ATACMS missiles to eliminate the risk of unexploded ordnance by 2016. The first modernized Tactical Missile System (TACMS) was delivered in September 2016 with updated guidance electronics and added capability to defeat area targets using a unitary warhead, without leaving behind unexploded ordnance.
Lockheed was awarded a production contract for launch assemblies as part of the SLEP in August 2017.
In 2021, Lockheed Martin was contracted to upgrade existing M39 munitions to the M57 variant with a WDU-18/B warhead from the Harpoon missile by 2024.

A plan announced in October 2016 to add an existing seeker to enable the ATACMS to strike moving targets on land and at sea was terminated in December 2020 to pursue other missile efforts.

=== Replacement ===
Starting in 2016, in view of some lagging in the world arms race, where ATACMS had become outdated, Long-Range Precision Fires (LRPF) began to be developed, which was later renamed Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), with the idea of replacing ATACMS missiles with the &quot;Increment 1&quot; phase (version) of PrSM.
That exact replacement began to fill the U.S. Army in late 2023.

== Versions ==
* M39 (Block I) – missile with inertial guidance. It carries 950 M74 anti-personnel and anti‑materiel (APAM) bomblets, each about the size of a baseball and weighing , which are dispersed across a circular area approximately in diameter, and effective against parked aircraft, ammunition dumps, air defense systems, and gatherings of personnel, but not against armored vehicles. The size of the affected area can be changed by modifying the height at which the payload is released. Range of Block I is 25–165 km (15-100 mi). The M74 has a reported failure rate of 2%.
* M39A1 (Block IA) – missile with GPS-aided guidance. It carries 300 M74 bomblets. There were 610 produced between 1997 and 2003. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, 74 were expended. As of 2021, the remaining ones were being updated to M57E1 standard. Range: .
* M39A2 (Block II) missile used to dispense Brilliant Anti-armour Technology (BAT) submunitions. Has the same INS/GPS guidance system as the M39A1 and carries 13 BAT submunitions in the enlarged warhead section.
* M48 (Block I/Block 1 Unitary) is a variant of ATACMS Block IA, containing the Quick Reaction Unitary (QRU) warhead. It carries the WDU-18/B penetrating high explosive blast fragmentation warhead of the Harpoon anti-ship missile, which was packaged into the newly designed WAU-23/B warhead section. There were 176 produced between 2001 and 2004, when production ceased in favor of the M57. Operational since 2002. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, 16 were launched, and a further 42 during Operation Enduring Freedom. The remaining ones are in the US Army and US Marine Corps&#x27; arsenal. Range: .
* M57 (Block IA/Block 1A Quick Reaction Unitary, TACMS 2000 or T2K) – is, in fact, same missile as M48, with production costs reduced by up to $100,000 per missile via the &quot;TACMS 2000&quot; program. M39A1-based upgraded missile with GPS-aided guidance. It carries the same WAU-23/B warhead section as the M48. There were 513 produced between 2004 and 2013. Accuracy is CEP (Circular Error Probable). Range: .
* &quot;M57E1&quot; (ATACMS MOD or MOD [modification, modified]) – upgraded M39 and M39A1 with re-grained motor, updated navigation and guidance software and hardware, and a WAU-23/B warhead section instead of the M74 bomblets. This variant includes a proximity sensor for airburst detonation. Production commenced in 2017 with an initial order for 220.
* NATACMS – a ship-launched ATACMS variant for the U.S. Navy, was under development in the 1990s and was tested twice in early 1995: first from the ground at the White Sands Missile Range, and then from the flight deck of using a modified Army M270 tracked vehicle at a target 75 nautical miles (86 mi) distant on San Clemente Island off Southern California. The last testing missile carried 730 Mk 74 (probably meaning M74 munition) submunitions. Despite all test objectives being met, or even exceeded, development was later cancelled for unknown reasons.
* SLATACMS – A projected Sea-Launched ATACMS variant of the Army Block IA missile for undersea operations with a maximum launch depth limit of 175 feet, identical warhead, same diameter and only dimensional changes of length from 156.5&quot; to 199&quot;, for fins to be folded within a smaller envelope and the addition of a fin module, which had to be jettisoned after broach and before motor ignition, behind the boattail for stability during underwater flight, – to fit primarily within the most advanced (688i, FLTIII/Flight III) design of Los Angeles-class submarine vertical launching system (VLS) capsules, having 12 of such ones onboard. Its history began when USN Strategic System Program Office authorized a study in June 1995 to evaluate undersea cold launch capability of MGM-140A from submarines. However, on the Hearings on National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 held on March, 1996, become known that USN plan to use not only APAM but also a BAT (Brilliant Anti-Tank) munitions payload, and when Lockheed Martin presented SLATACMS press-release at August, 1996, there was already described Block IA missile as a base modification specimen for the SLATACMS. Choosing a submarine VLS as the appropriate launcher, that was designed by default for Tomahawk missile, which have ~x1,5 length of SLATACMS, exclusively, had led to the creation of a unique combined missile and launch capsule as an all-up-round (AUR) or SLATACMS AUR, which with SLATACMS inside fits the submarine&#x27;s Tomahawk-designed VLS.

The ATACMS was first used in combat in 1991: 32 were fired from the M270 MLRS during Operation Desert Storm. In 2003, more than 450 were fired in Operation Iraqi Freedom. By early 2015, more than 560 ATACMS missiles had been used in combat.

Starting from October 2023 Ukraine began using the earliest (short-ranged) versions of ATACMS during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These missiles were meant to threaten the Russian-occupied &quot;land corridor&quot; to Crimea in the southern part of Ukraine as well as the vast majority of the Russian-operated air bases in the north of Crimea, which would theoretically complicate Russia&#x27;s use of attack helicopters from those bases against Ukrainian targets.

Starting from 19 February 2024 there were rumors about possible near-future use of later (longer-ranged) versions of ATACMS by Ukraine, which were shortly proven correct, when an ATACMS missile attack on the Russian-occupied Dzhankoi air base, positioned much further from the nearest Ukraine-controlled territory than earlier versions of ATACMS&#x27; strike range, resulting in six main explosions and several reported secondary explosions. It was then officially confirmed when U.S. officials revealed Ukraine had already received and deployed the missiles to a combat-ready status a month prior.

On 23 June 2024 an incident occurred during an attack on Sevastopol, where Russian air defense missiles were fired at multiple ATACMS missiles resulting in explosions that caused 2 to 4 deaths and more than 150 injuries on Uchkiivka Beach, where locals reported that no air raid warning had taken place and therefore people on the beach were not able to evacuate.

In September 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened retaliation for attacks on Russian territory. Experts said Putin&#x27;s threats are aimed at dissuading the United States, the United Kingdom and France from allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied long-range missiles such as the Storm Shadow and ATACMS in strikes against Russia.

On 17 November 2024, the United States changed policy, allowing Ukraine to use ATACMS for military targets inside mainland Russia.

On 19 November 2024, ATACMS were for the first time fired at a target within the internationally recognized borders of Russia. An ammunition storage facility was destroyed in the Bryansk region of Russia, with videos of explosions and fires on the ground at the site emerging.

On 25 November 2024, ATACMS were used to hit a Russian S-400 air defense system at an airbase in the Kursk region of Russia. Video emerged of ATACMS cluster munitions hitting the airbase, and imagery emerged of a destroyed 92N6E radar station of the S-400 system.

=== EW vs usability ===

The ATACMS uses multiple inertial navigation units knitted together with software, so it is reportedly able to maintain accuracy when GPS is lost due to electronic warfare better than other GPS-guided weapons.

=== Reverse engineering ===

On July 1, 2024, Russia claimed to have recovered an ATACMS missile guidance system intact, and stated that Russian officials are studying the guidance system to &quot;identify any weak spots&quot;.

<doc id="147018" wikidata="Q2448030" url="?curid=147018" title="Human wave attack">
<text>A human wave attack, also known as a human sea attack, is an offensive infantry tactic in which an attacker conducts an unprotected frontal assault with densely concentrated infantry formations against the enemy line, intended to overrun and overwhelm the defenders by engaging in melee combat. The name refers to the concept of a coordinated mass of soldiers falling upon an enemy force and sweeping them away with sheer weight and momentum, like an ocean wave breaking on a beach.

==Definition==
According to U.S. Army analyst Edward C. O&#x27;Dowd, the technical definition of a human wave attack tactic is a frontal assault by densely concentrated infantry formations against an enemy line, without any attempts to shield or to mask the attacker&#x27;s movement. The goal of a human wave attack is to maneuver as many people as possible into close range, hoping that the shock from a large mass of attackers engaged in melee combat would force the enemy to disintegrate or fall back.

The human wave attack&#x27;s reliance on melee combat usually makes the organization and the training of the attacking force irrelevant, but it requires either great physical courage, coercion, or morale for the attackers to advance into enemy fire. However, when matched against modern weaponry such as automatic firearms, artillery and aircraft, a human wave attack is an extremely dangerous and costly tactic in the face of devastating firepower. Thus, for a human wave attack to succeed on the modern battlefield, it is imperative for the attackers to charge into the enemy line in the shortest time and in the greatest numbers possible, so that a sufficient mass can be preserved when the attackers reach melee range.

However, this solution usually means that the attackers must sacrifice concealment and cover for numbers and speed. Because of this trade-off, human wave attacks can be used by an attacker which lacks tactical training or one which lacks firepower and the ability to manoeuvre, but which can motivate and control its personnel.

==Use==
Human wave attacks have been used by several armed forces around the world, including European and American armies during the American Civil War and World War I, the Boxers during the Boxer Rebellion, the Spanish Republican Army during the Spanish Civil War, the Red Army, Imperial Japanese Army and the National Revolutionary Army during the World War II, The People&#x27;s Volunteer Army during the Korean War and the People&#x27;s Liberation Army during the Vietnam War and Sino-Vietnamese War, the Iranian Basij during the Iran–Iraq War, and the Russian Ground Forces during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

===Boxer Rebellion===
Human wave attacks were used during the Boxer Rebellion (1899–1901) in China. Boxer rebels performed human wave attacks against Eight-Nation Alliance forces during the Seymour Expedition and the Battle of Langfang where the Eight Nation Alliance was forced to retreat.

On 11 and 14 June 1900, Boxers armed only with bladed melee weapons directly charged the Alliance troops at Langfang armed with rifles and machine guns in human wave attacks and the Boxers also blocked the retreat of the expedition via train by destroying the Tianjin-Langfang railway.

The Boxers and Dong Fuxiang&#x27;s army worked together in the joint ambush with the Boxers relentlessly assaulting the Allies head on with human wave attacks displaying &quot;no fear of death&quot; and engaging the Allies in melee combat and putting the Allied troops under severe mental stress by mimicking vigorous gunfire with firecrackers. The Allies however suffered most of their losses at the hands of General Dong&#x27;s troops, who used their expertise and persistence to engage in &quot;bold and persistent&quot; assaults on the Alliance forces, as remembered by the German Captain Usedom: the right wing of the Germans was almost at the point of collapse under the attack until they were rescued from Langfang by French and British troops; the Allies then retreated from Langfang in trains full of bullet holes.

===Russo-Japanese War===
During the Siege of Port Arthur (1904–1905), human wave attacks were conducted on Russian artillery and machine guns by the Japanese which ended up becoming suicidal. Since the Japanese suffered massive casualties in the attacks, one description of the aftermath was that &quot;a thick, unbroken mass of corpses covered the cold earth like a coverlet.&quot;

===Spanish Republicans===
Human wave attacks have also been deployed by the Republicans in Spain during the Spanish Civil War most notably their defense of Casa de Campo during the Siege of Madrid, particularly the counterattack by the Durruti Column led by Buenaventura Durruti.
Also, as recounted by various former members of the Lincoln Battalion, it was not uncommon for Republican commanders to order units onto attacks that were warned by field officers to be ill-advised or suicidal.

===Soviet Red Army===
There were elements of human waves being utilized in the Russian Civil War recounted by American soldiers in Russia supporting the White Army.

In the Winter War of 1939–1940 the Soviet Red Army used human wave charges repeatedly against fortified Finnish positions, allowing the enemy machine gunners to mow them down, a tactic described as &quot;incomprehensible fatalism&quot; by the Finnish commander Mannerheim. This led to massive losses on the Soviet side and contributed to why the clearly weaker Finnish forces (both in manpower and armament) were able to temporarily resist the Soviet attacks on the Karelian Isthmus. Soviet attacks in other sectors were successfully halted by the Finns.

Richard Overy in his book, &quot;The Oxford History of World War II&quot;, talks about the eventual technological advancement of Soviet spearhead forces, becoming as effective as German forces, however he still acknowledges that elements of &quot;unthinkable self-sacrifice, &#x27;human wave&#x27; tactics, and draconian punishment&quot; existed.

===Imperial Japanese Army===

The Imperial Japanese Army was known for its use of human wave attacks. There were even specialized units who were trained in this type of assault.

The charge was used successfully in the Russo-Japanese War and the Second Sino-Japanese War, where the highly disciplined Japanese soldiers were fighting against enemies with comparatively lower discipline and without many automatic weapons such as machine guns, oftentimes outnumbering them as well. In such instances, a determined charge could break into the enemy lines and win the day. The effectiveness of such strategies in China made them a standard tactic for the Imperial Japanese Army. These tactics became mostly known to Western audiences during the Pacific War, where Japanese forces used this approach against Allied forces. However, Allied forces drastically outnumbered the Japanese, and they were equipped with a very high number of automatic weapons. They also consisted of well-trained forces who would quickly adapt to Japanese charges. If the Allied forces could establish a defensive perimeter, their superior firepower would often result in crippling Japanese casualties and a failure of the attack. The Japanese battle-cry &quot;Banzai&quot; led to this form of charge being called the &quot;Banzai charge&quot; by the Allied forces.

In addition to its strategic use by Japanese military forces, the frequency of its use has been explained, in part, as Japanese troops adhering to their traditional Bushido honor code that viewed surrender as shameful or unacceptable, whereas the bravery of a human wave charge, even if suicidal, was an honorable choice. These banzai charges by Japanese soldiers against Allied troops equipped with machine guns, light mortars, semi-automatic rifles and sub-machine guns were often ineffective in altering the outcome of a battle, but American troops later reported severe psychological pressure from defending against these out-gunned human waves.

===People&#x27;s Volunteer Army===
During the Korean War, the term &quot;human wave attack&quot; was used to describe the Chinese short attack, a combination of infiltration and shock tactics employed by the People&#x27;s Volunteer Army (PVA). According to some accounts, Marshal Peng Dehuai—the overall commander of the PVA forces in Korea—is said to have invented this tactic.

A typical Chinese short attack was carried out at night by numerous fireteams on a narrow front against the weakest point in enemy defenses. The PVA assault team would crawl undetected within grenade range, then launch surprise attacks against the defenders in order to breach the defenses by relying on maximum shock and confusion. If the initial shock failed to breach the defenses, additional fireteams would press on behind them and attack the same point until a breach was created. Once penetration was achieved, the bulk of the Chinese forces would move into the enemy rear and attack from behind. During the attacks, the Chinese assault teams would disperse while masking themselves using the terrain, and this made it difficult for UN defenders to target numerous Chinese troops. Attacks by the successive Chinese fireteams were also carefully timed to minimize casualties. Due to primitive communication systems and tight political controls within the Chinese army, short attacks were often repeated indefinitely until either the defenses were penetrated or the attacker&#x27;s ammunition supply were exhausted, regardless of the chances of success or the human cost.

This persistent attack pattern left a strong impression on UN forces that fought in Korea, giving birth to the description of &quot;human wave.&quot; U.S. Army historian Roy Edgar Appleman observed that the term &quot;human wave&quot; was later used by journalists and military officials to convey the image that the American soldiers were assaulted by overwhelming numbers of Chinese on a broad front. S.L.A. Marshall also commented that the word &quot;mass&quot; was indiscriminately used by the media to describe Chinese infantry tactics, and it is rare for the Chinese to actually use densely concentrated infantry formations to absorb enemy firepower. In response to the media&#x27;s stereotype of Chinese assault troops deployed in vast &quot;human seas&quot;, a joke circulated among the US servicemen was &quot;How many hordes are there in a Chinese platoon?&quot;

In Chinese sources, this tactic is referred to as &quot;three-three fireteams,&quot; after the composition of the attack: three men would form one fireteam, and three fireteams would form one squad. A Chinese platoon, consisting of 33 to 50 soldiers (depending on if they had a heavy weapons team), would form their squads in ranks in a staggered arrowhead formation, which would be employed to attack &quot;one point&quot; from &quot;two sides.&quot;

Although abandoned by the PVA by 1953, outside observers such as Allen S. Whiting expected China to use the tactic if necessary. The Chinese army re-adopted this tactic during the Vietnam War and Sino-Vietnamese War due to the stagnation of the Chinese military modernization programs during the Cultural Revolution. Their use in the Vietnam War and Sino-Vietnamese War is a rare example of an army with superior firepower, in this case the PLA, throwing away its advantage.

===Iran–Iraq War===


During the Iran–Iraq War, some of the attacks conducted by Iranian forces in large operations, were considered to be human wave attacks.

=== Eritrean-Ethiopian War ===
In the Eritrean–Ethiopian War of 1998-2000, the widespread use of trenches has resulted in comparisons of the conflict to the trench warfare of World War I. According to some reports, trench warfare led to the loss of &quot;thousands of young lives in human-wave assaults on Eritrea&#x27;s positions&quot;.

=== Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
==== Russian military ====
During the Russian invasion of Ukraine starting in 2022, the Ukrainian military, Western media and prominent Russian milbloggers have reported that the Russian military uses human wave attacks to overcome Ukrainian defenses.

During the battles of Bakhmut, Vuhledar, and Avdiivka, it was claimed that Russian Army regulars were sent into the battles using human wave tactics to capture the towns. Wagner Group paramilitary units also used &quot;human wave attacks&quot; using convicts recruited from prisons to fight in Ukraine, including those in the Storm-Z and Storm-V units. It was also claimed that the Russian infantry sent in &quot;human wave&quot; attacks are poorly trained and equipped, with minimal or no mechanized or air support. Rear Admiral John Kirby, spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council, claimed that Russia threw &quot;masses of poorly trained soldiers right into the battlefield without proper equipment, and apparently without proper training and preparation.&quot; Russian troops have claimed that they were threatened with being shot by barrier troops if they retreated from attacks.

The term &quot;meat grinder&quot; has been used to describe these tactics used by Russia in attempts to wear down Ukrainian forces and expose their positions to Russian artillery. According to NATO and Western military officials, around 1,200 Russian soldiers were killed or wounded in Ukraine every day on average in May and June 2024, mainly due to the use of Soviet tactics and human wave attacks. These attacks have also been compared to the Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s banzai charges.

==== North Korean military ====

North Korean troops were deployed to Russia in October 2024 to aid Russia in the Ukrainian Kursk offensive, their attacks on Ukrainian positions were described as &quot;human wave attacks&quot; in December 2024 by Kirby, who assessed that the attacks had resulted in over 1,000 killed and wounded North Korean soldiers in one week on the front. He added that it was &quot;clear&quot; that Russian and North Korean military leaders saw the North Koreans as &quot;expendable&quot;.
